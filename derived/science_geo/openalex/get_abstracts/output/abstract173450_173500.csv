https://openalex.org/W2038783205,"Mammalian genetic approaches to study gene function have been hampered by the lack of tools to generate stable loss-of-function phenotypes efficiently. We report here a new vector system, named pSUPER, which directs the synthesis of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in mammalian cells. We show that siRNA expression mediated by this vector causes efficient and specific down-regulation of gene expression, resulting in functional inactivation of the targeted genes. Stable expression of siRNAs using this vector mediates persistent suppression of gene expression, allowing the analysis of loss-of-function phenotypes that develop over longer periods of time. Therefore, the pSUPER vector constitutes a new and powerful system to analyze gene function in a variety of mammalian cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2027745714,"Preserving multicentennial climate variability in long tree-ring records is critically important for reconstructing the full range of temperature variability over the past 1000 years. This allows the putative ""Medieval Warm Period"" (MWP) to be described and to be compared with 20th-century warming in modeling and attribution studies. We demonstrate that carefully selected tree-ring chronologies from 14 sites in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) extratropics can preserve such coherent large-scale, multicentennial temperature trends if proper methods of analysis are used. In addition, we show that the average of these chronologies supports the large-scale occurrence of the MWP over the NH extratropics."

We isolated 155,144 RIKEN Arabidopsis full-length (RAFL) cDNA clones. The 3'-end expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of 155,144 RAFL cDNAs were clustered into 14,668 nonredundant cDNA groups, about 60% of predicted genes. We also obtained 5' ESTs from 14,034 nonredundant cDNA groups and constructed a promoter database. The sequence database of the RAFL cDNAs is useful for promoter analysis and correct annotation of predicted transcription units and gene products. Furthermore, the full-length cDNAs are useful resources for analyses of the expression profiles, functions, and structures of plant proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2060426018,"Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a proinflammatory mediator that exerts its biological functions by binding two TNF receptors (TNF-RI and TNF-RII), which initiate biological responses by interacting with adaptor and signalling proteins. Among the signalling components that associate with TNF receptors are members of the TNF-R-associated factor (TRAF) family. TRAF2 is required for TNF-alpha-mediated activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), contributes to activation of NF-kappaB, and mediates anti-apoptotic signals,. TNF-RI and TNF-RII signalling complexes also contain the anti-apoptotic ('inhibitor of apoptosis') molecules c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 (refs 5, 6), which also have RING domain-dependent ubiquitin protein ligase (E3) activity. The function of IAPs in TNF-R signalling is unknown. Here we show that binding of TNF-alpha to TNF-RII induces ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of TRAF2. Although c-IAP1 bound TRAF2 and TRAF1 in vitro, it ubiquitinated only TRAF2. Expression of wild-type c-IAP1, but not an E3-defective mutant, resulted in TRAF2 ubiquitination and degradation. Moreover, E3-defective c-IAP1 prevented TNF-alpha-induced TRAF2 degradation and inhibited apoptosis. These findings identify a physiologic role for c-IAP1 and define a mechanism by which TNF-RII-regulated ubiquitin protein ligase activity can potentiate TNF-induced apoptosis."

These phosphoantigen-specific γδ T cells displayed major expansion during Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) infection and a clear memory-type response after BCG reinfection. Primary and recall expansions of Vγ2Vδ2 + T cells were also seen during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection of naı̈ve and BCG-vaccinated macaques, respectively. This capacity to rapidly expand coincided with a clearance of BCG bacteremia and immunity to fatal tuberculosis in BCG-vaccinated macaques. Thus, Vγ2Vδ2 + T cells may contribute to adaptive immunity to mycobacterial infections."

https://openalex.org/W2109152856,"We obtained nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of liquids in fields of a few microtesla, using prepolarization in fields of a few millitesla and detection with a dc superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). Because the sensitivity of the SQUID is frequency independent, we enhanced both signal-to-noise ratio and spectral resolution by detecting the NMR signal in extremely low magnetic fields, where the NMR lines become very narrow even for grossly inhomogeneous measurement fields. In the absence of chemical shifts, proton-phosphorous scalar (J) couplings have been detected, indicating the presence of specific covalent bonds. This observation opens the possibility for “pure J spectroscopy” as a diagnostic tool for the detection of molecules in low magnetic fields."
https://openalex.org/W2061547918,"Optical data are reported on a spectral weight transfer over a broad frequency range of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta, when this material became superconducting. Using spectroscopic ellipsometry, we observed the removal of a small amount of spectral weight in a broad frequency band from 10(4) cm(-1) to at least 2 x 10(4) cm(-1), due to the onset of superconductivity. We observed a blue shift of the ab-plane plasma frequency when the material became superconducting, indicating that the spectral weight was transferred to the infrared range. Our observations are in agreement with models in which superconductivity is accompanied by an increased charge carrier spectral weight. The measured spectral weight transfer is large enough to account for the condensation energy in these compounds."

One mechanism of biocontrol is mycoparasitism, and T. virens produces antifungal compounds to assist in killing its fungal targets. Peptide synthetases produce a wide variety of peptide secondary metabolites in bacteria and fungi. Many of these are known to possess antibiotic activities. Peptaibols form a class of antibiotics known for their high α-aminoisobutyric acid content and their synthesis as a mixture of isoforms ranging from 7 to 20 amino acids in length.

Peptaibols, a class of linear peptides of fungal origin with 7–20 residues, have three structural characteristics, (i) a high proportion of α,α-dialkylated amino acids with an abundance of α-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib), 1The abbreviations used are: Aibα-aminoisobutyric acidNRPSnon-ribosomal peptide synthetaseHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyAadenylationCcondensationTthiolationValolamino alcohol of valineIvaisovaline1The abbreviations used are: Aibα-aminoisobutyric acidNRPSnon-ribosomal peptide synthetaseHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyAadenylationCcondensationTthiolationValolamino alcohol of valineIvaisovaline (ii) an N-acyl terminus, usually acetyl, and (iii) a C-terminal amino alcohol, such as phenylalaninol or leucinol. Peptaibols naturally occur as mixtures of isoforms, and more than 250 sequences are now known (public-1.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/peptaibol/search.html). They are divided into three subclasses, which are (i) the long sequence peptaibols with 18–20 amino acid residues exemplified by alamethicins (1Pandey R.C. Cook J.C., Jr. Rinehart K.L., Jr. J. Am.

Peptaibols generally exhibit antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria and fungi (11Jen W.-C. Jones G.A. Brewer D. Parkinson V.O. Taylor A. J. Appl. Bacteriol. 1987; 63: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Their biological activities are thought to arise from their membrane-modifying properties and their ability to form transmembrane voltage-dependent channels (12Sansom M.S.P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1991; 55: 139-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 13Rebuffat S. Duclohier H. Auvin-Guette C. Molle G. Spach G. Bodo B. FEMS Immunol.

The producing fungi, mainly of the genus Trichoderma and related genera such as Emericellopsis and Gliocladium, have antagonistic activity against fungal phytopathogens, which has led to their use as biocontrol agents. Mycoparasitic strains of Trichoderma produce cell wall-hydrolyzing enzymes in addition to antibiotics. Peptaibols are thought to act on the membrane of the target fungus to inhibit membrane-associated enzymes involved in cell wall synthesis. Indeed, peptaibols have been shown to act synergistically with cell wall-degrading enzymes to inhibit the growth of fungal pathogens (14Lorito M. Woo S.L. D'Ambrosio M. Harman G.E. Hayes C.K.

The exogenous application of peptaibols has been shown to trigger a defense response in lima bean and to reduce the susceptibility of tobacco to tobacco mosaic virus (16Engelberth J. Koch T.

With their unusual amino acid content, we expected peptaibols to be the product of non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). These large multifunctional enzymes assemble compounds from a remarkable range of precursors (including nonproteinogenic amino acids and hydroxy or carboxyl acids), which can be N-methylated, acylated, reduced, or epimerized (18Marahiel M.A. Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2651-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 19Zocher R. Keller U. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1997; 38: 85-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NRPSs have a modular structure in which each module is a semiautonomous unit that recognizes, activates, and modifies a single residue of the final peptide (20Marahiel M.A. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 1997; 4: 561-567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Each module can be further partitioned into distinct adenylation (A), thiolation (T), and condensation (C) domains, which together represent a minimal repeating unit of NRPSs (21Stein T. Vater J. Kruft V. Otto A. Wittmann-Liebold B. Franke P. Panico M. McDowell R. Morris H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15428-15435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Analysis of the phenylalanine activation domain of gramicidin synthetase, GrsA, has been used to determine the key residues responsible for A-domain specificity in substrate recognition (22Stachelhaus T.

It is hoped that a sufficiently large collection of verified signature sequence/amino acid substrate combinations will provide an NRPS “codon” table allowing prediction of amino acid substrates based on the signature sequences in uncharacterized NRPSs. Using a PCR-based approach, we identified a peptide synthetase of Trichoderma virens. Here we report the cloning of a gene responsible for the production of peptaibols in T. virens. The predicted open reading frame represents the largest known NRPS and contains modules for the incorporation of 18 amino acids as well as the domain we predict is involved in acetylation of the N terminus and reduction of the C terminus of the peptaibol products. Conidial suspensions of T. virens strains TV29-8, TVP223, and TVP234 were inoculated into 120 Roux flasks, each containing 170 ml of the sterilized synthetic medium having the composition glucose (0.5%), KH2PO4(0.08%), KNO3 (0.07%), Ca(H2PO4)2, (0.02%), MgSO4·7H2O (0.05%), MnSO4·5H2O (0.001%), CuSO4·5H2O (0.0005%), FeSO4·7H2O (0.0001%). Each flask was inoculated with a 2 ml of conidial suspension, and the stationary cultures were incubated at 27 °C for 18 days. The fermentation broth was filtered, and the filtrate was extracted 3 times with n-butyl alcohol, whereas the mycelium was extracted 3 times with methanol, yielding 0.9 and 1.1 g of crude fraction, respectively. These two fractions were subjected to gel filtration over a Sephadex LH 20 column eluted with MeOH to yield crude peptide mixtures in the head fractions. We recovered 512 mg of crude peptide mixtures from the culture filtrate fraction and 12 mg from the mycelial fraction of TV29-8. These peptide mixtures were each chromatographed over a silica gel column (Kieselgel 60 H Merck) by elution with a CH2Cl2:MeOH gradient (from 9:1 to 1:1). Each fraction yielded two groups of peptides, TVA and TVB. The culture filtrate yielded 273 mg of TVA and 120 mg of TVB. Lower amounts of TVA (14 mg) and TVB (19 mg) were obtained from the mycelium. The peptides from the mycelium were not analyzed further. Column chromatographs were monitored by TLC (SiO2, Merck 60 F254; CH2Cl2:MeOH, 7:3) and visualized by spraying with anisaldehyde reagent (p-anisaldehyde:sulfuric acid:acetic acid, 1:1:50) followed by heating. HPLC was performed with a semi-preparative C18 column (Kromasil, 5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm) with MeOH:H2O, 86:14 as the system eluent (flow rate, 1 ml/min) to separate peptaibol subfractions. The peptides (1 mg) were hydrolyzed (HCl 6 n, 110 °C, N2), and the amino acids and amino alcohols were derivatized to produce N-trifluoroacetylisopropyl ester derivatives as previously described (2Bodo B. Rebuffat S., El Hajji M. Davoust D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 6011-6017Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 3El Hajji M. Rebuffat S. Lecommandeur D. Bodo B. Int..J.

The gas-liquid chromatography analyses of the N-trifluoroacetylisopropyl esters were performed with a Girdel 3000 chromatograph on a Chirasil-l-Val (N-propionyl-l-valine tert-butylamide polysiloxane) quartz capillary column (Chrompack, 25-m length, 0.2-mm internal diameter) with He (0.7 bar) as the carrier gas with the following temperature program: 50 to 130 °C, 3 °C min−1 followed by 130 to 190 °C, 10 °C min−1. The separation factors (Rt) were (αl/d for the l and denantiomers): Aib, 10.4; l-Ala, 14.8 (1.16);l-Glu, 33.2 (1.05); Gly, 17.8; l-Leu, 24.2 (1.11); l-Ser, 23.0 (1.05); l-Val, 17.7 (1.08);l-Valol, 18 (0.98). A different temperature program was used for the separation of proline enantiomers: 50 to 110 °C, 3 °C min−1, then a plateau at 110 °C (10 min), followed by 110 to 190 °C, 10 °C min−1; Rt (αL/D):l-Pro, 25.1 (1.02). Positive LSIMS were recorded on a ZAB2-SEQ (VG Analytical, Manchester, UK) mass spectrometer equipped with a standard fast atom bombardment source and a cesium ion gun operating at 35 kV. Peptide methanolic solutions (15–50 mm) were mixed with α-monothioglycerol as a matrix. Methanolic (CD3OH) solutions of the TVB peptides (0.5 ml, 15 mm) in 5-mm tubes were used for the NMR experiments, which were recorded at 298 K on a Bruker AC 300 equipped with an Aspect 300 computer using DISNMR software. Proton chemical shifts were referenced to the central component of the quintet due to the CHD3 of methanol at 3.313 ppm downfield from tetramethylsilane. Growth conditions, gliotoxin extraction conditions, thin layer chromatography, and detection of gliotoxin were performed as described (24Howell C.R. Stipanovic R.D. Lumsden L.D. Biocontrol. Sci. Technol. 1993; 3: 435-441Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar). PCR primers Acv2 (TTCCTRTCCAAYTACGTSTTYGAYTTCTC) and Acv5 (GGSACCATRTAYGIKGGAAG) (where Y = C/T, R = A/G, S = C/G, K = G/T, I = inosine) were designed to amplify a portion of the A domain from NRPSs (22Stachelhaus T. Mootz H. Marahiel M.A. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 1999; 6: 493-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). A single PCR product was obtained and used to probe a cosmid library of T. virens. 2C. M. Kenerley, unpublished information. One cosmid, 40B7, had high sequence similarity to known peptide synthetases. A probe derived from cosmid 40B7 was used to identify a BAC clone, pDXG70, that was used for further analysis (25Grzegorski D. The Construction and Characterization of Three Genomic Libraries of Trichoderma virens Strain Tv29–8.M.Sc. thesis. Texas A&M University, 2001Google Scholar). BamHI fragments of 6.8 and 8.3 kb from cosmid 40B7 were subcloned and sequenced entirely on both strands (Gene Technology Laboratory, Texas A&M). Additional sequences were obtained by direct sequencing from cosmid 40B7 and subclones of bacterial artificial chromosome clone pDXG70. These latter sequences were primarily determined using custom sequencing primers that provided coverage on a single strand. Manual adjustment of the sequences was performed to maintain the reading frame. A vector for gene replacement, pPSK2, was constructed containing 4476- and 2944-bp fragments from cosmid 40B7 that flank the selectable hph (hygromycin phosphotransferase) gene. This plasmid was transformed into TV29-8 as previously described (26Thomas M.D. Kenerley C.M. Curr. Genet. 1989; 15: 415-420Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar) with selection for resistance to hygromycin B. DNA was extracted from 324 transformants as described (27Xu B. Wild J.R. Kenerley C.M. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1996; 81: 473-481Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The 324 transformants were screened by Southern blot analysis to identify strains containing the disruption. Two crude peptaibol fractions (TVA and TVB) from T. virens strain TV29-8 were obtained by extraction from culture filtrates, exclusion chromatography, and silica gel chromatography (“Experimental Procedures”). When analyzed by reverse phase HPLC, the two peptide groups appeared as complex mixtures of isoforms. Six main peaks were observed for the TVB group. The TVB mixture was submitted to semi-preparative HPLC to yield TVB I to VI (Fig. 1 A). Further spectral analysis showed TVB I, II, and IV to be homogeneous, whereas TVB III, V, and VI remained mixtures. The 1H NMR spectra of TVB I, II, and IV were characteristic of peptaibols, showing amide protons between 6.50 and 8.70 ppm, a high proportion of them being singlets, typical of α,α-dialkylated amino acids. Several methyl singlets of Aib between 1.30 and 1.60 ppm and a sharp singlet at 2.05 ppm were assigned to the N-terminal acetyl. The TVA fraction was much more complex, and no pure compound was isolated (Fig. 1 B). The amino acid composition of TVBI was Aib [7] l-Ala [2], Gly [1],l-Gln [2], l-Leu [2], l-Pro [1], l-Ser [1], l-Val [1], and the amino alcohol was l-valinol. Peptide TVB II had an additionall-leucine and no valine, and TVB IV differed from TVB II by the replacement of one Aib by a d-isovaline. When analyzed by (+) liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry, the adduct ions [M+H]+ and [M+Na]+ were observed, allowing the molecular mass to be determined. As generally described for these peptides (7Rebuffat, S., Hlimi, S., Prigent, Y., Goulard, C., and Bodo B. (1996)J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I 2021–2027Google Scholar), fragmentation events leading to acylium ions were detected and, thus, allowed the sequences of TVB I, II, and IV to be determined (Fig. 1 C). The [M+Na]+ ion of TVB I was observed at m/z 1727 (Table I). A main fragmentation at the Aib-Pro amide bond led to the b12 acylium ion, which generated a series of acylium fragments at m/z 1009 (b11), 896 (b10), 809 (b9), 724 (b8), 653 (b7), 568 (b6), 440 (b5), 355 (b4), 256 (b3), 185 (b2), 128 (b1), leading to the sequence Ac-Aib-Gly-Ala-Val-Aib-Gln-Aib-Ala-Aib-Ser-Leu-Aib. An ammonium ion was observed at m/z 612 (y6), which underwent fragmentation, leading to a series of acylium ions at m/z 509, 381, 296, and 211 from which the C-terminal sequence Pro-Leu-Aib-Aib-Gln-Valol was deduced (Table I).

The y6 ion was observed at m/z 612 for the two compounds, and it underwent the same fragmentation, suggesting the 13–18-residue C-terminal sequence to be the same as TVB I, Pro-Leu Aib-Aib-Gln-Valol. The b12 acylium ion was at m/z 1108 for TVB II, and its further acylium fragmentation allowed the sequence Ac-Aib-Gly-Ala-Leu-Aib-Gln-Aib-Ala-Aib-Ser-Leu-Aib to be determined for the 1–12-residue N-terminal moiety. This differs from TVBI by the Val/Leu substitution at position 4. The b12 acylium ion for TVB IV was observed at m/z 1122, yielding acylium fragments giving the sequence Ac-Aib-Gly-Ala-Leu-Aib-Gln-d-Iva-Ala-Aib-Ser-Leu-Aib (Fig. 1 C). Mass spectral analysis of TVB III and V showed they were micro-heterogeneous. The main component of TVB III had the same quasi-molecular ions and fragmentation as TVB II and, therefore, may be an isoform. The pattern for TVB V was most similar to that of TVB IV. Because no pure peptide was obtained from the TVA group, the mixture was analyzed by (+) liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry. Two quasi-molecular [M+Na]+ ions were observed in the high mass region. The more abundant class contained ions at m/z 1183, 1197, 1211, and 1227, suggesting a mixture of 11-residue peptides similar to harzianins HB (5Augeven-Bour, I., Rebuffat, S., Auvin, C., Goulard, C., Prigent, Y., and Bodo, B. (1997) J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I 1587–1594Google Scholar) (Table II). The less abundant class contained ions at m/z1452, 1466, and 1480, suggesting a mixture of 14-residue peptides similar to harzianins HC (6Rebuffat, S., Goulard, C., and Bodo B. (1995) J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I 1849–1855Google Scholar) (Table II). Degenerate primers (“Experimental Procedures”) successfully amplified a single PCR product of 886 bp, and subsequent sequence analysis of this product revealed clear homology to known peptide synthetases. The PCR product was used as a probe to identify a cosmid clone, 40B7, of T. virens genomic DNA. Two adjacent BamHI fragments of 6.8 and 8.3 kb (Fig. 2 B) were sequenced and revealed a continuous 15.1-kb open reading frame with homology to 4 complete and two partial peptide synthetase modules. Sequence analysis of an additional 3.9-kb region in the 5′ direction of the gene revealed that the single open reading frame continued to the end of the cosmid insert. A T. virens bacterial artificial chromosome library was constructed to facilitate cloning of the peptide synthetase (25Grzegorski D. The Construction and Characterization of Three Genomic Libraries of Trichoderma virens Strain Tv29–8.M.Sc. thesis. Texas A&M University, 2001Google Scholar). A bacterial artificial chromosome clone, pDXG70, was identified through Southern hybridization that contains the entire coding sequence for the gene, called texas-1(tex1). From the sequences obtained from subclones of pDXG70, we deduce that the gene encodes a single open reading frame of 18 complete peptide synthetase modules and additional domain homologies at the N and C termini of the predicted protein (Fig. 2 A). An additional 4.5 kb of sequence downstream of tex1 was determined. Within this region, two sequence homologies were identified; one displayed strong homology to a retrograde regulation protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Rtg2p) and the other to a calcium/proton exchanger of Neurospora crassa. The sequence displaying Rtg2p homology (35% identity) is convergent to tex1 beginning 2.2 kb from the 3′ end of tex1 and ending 0.7 kb from tex1. The calcium/proton exchanger homolog (29% identity) is in the same orientation as tex1, beginning 3.25 kb from the end of tex1 and extending to the end of the cosmid insert. Conserved sequences in peptide synthetase modules are involved in ATP binding and amino acid thioesterification and transfer (31Konz D. Marahiel M.A. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 1999; 6: 39-48Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). These conserved domains are present in each of the modules (Fig. 2 A). BLAST alignments comparing the complete modules of tex1 to each other showed 35–58% identity over the entire length of the modules. A comparison of the signature sequence residues showed that all modules have the expected aspartate residue at position 235. Aspartate residues are invariant at this position for modules incorporating amino acids, differing only in modules that incorporate carboxylic acids (32Weber T. Marahiel M.A. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 3-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Modules 6 and 17 have identical residues in the remaining 8 positions (Table III). Modules 1, 5, 9, 12, 15, and 16 share identical residues at positions 236, 239, 299, and 322. These modules also have aromatic residues at position 278. Modules 3 and 8 have identical residues at position 299, 301, 322, and 330 and similar residues at positions 236, 278, and 331. The comparison of signature sequences of the tex1 modules with the sequences of trichorzins TVB I, II, and IV are consistent with the view that the signature sequences determine amino acid specificity.Table IIISignature sequences of putative amino acid activating domains of texIAmino acidModuleSignature sequence position235236239278299301322330331Q6DGGMVGGNYQ17DGGMVGGNYJ/U7DCGWVVGVVU1DLGYLAGVFU9DLGYLAGCFU12DLGYLAGVFU15DLGFLAGVFU16DLGFLAGLFU/A5DLGWLCGVFA3DVGFVAGVLA8DIFVVAGVIL11DFLYFGGVVL/V14DAALIGAVFV4DMGFLGGVCV-OH18DAIIIVGVTG2DIGMVVGVLS10DVGYLAAVYP13DVLFCGLICJ, 2-aminoisobutyric acid; U, isovaline; V-OH, valinol.

We generated mutant alleles of tex1 by replacing a 0.4-kb segment of tex1 with a selectable marker conferring resistance to the antibiotic hygromycin B (Fig. 2 B). The replacement vector (pPSK2) contained 4.5- and 2.6-kb segments of the peptide synthetase gene flanking the resistance marker (Fig. 3 A). The linearized plasmid was used to transform strain TV29-8 and 324 transformants were tested for stable integration of the resistance gene marker (33Baek J.M. Kenerley C.M. Fungal Genet. Biol. 1998; 23: 33-44Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These transformants were screened by Southern blot analysis to verify the disruption at the tex1 locus. Two strains, TVP223 and TVP234, were clearly disrupted for the gene (Fig. 3 B). Both of the transformants with the disrupted copy of the tex1 gene contained at least one additional ectopic copy of pPSK2. As predicted, bands in the mutant strains all hybridize to a probe obtained from the hygromycin cassette (data not shown). The two gene disruption transformants were tested in parallel with TV29-8 for peptaibol production. In contrast to the wild type, TV29-8, no peptaibols were found. Strain TV29-8 produces a second antibiotic, gliotoxin, that is also thought to contribute to mycoparasitic activity. Gliotoxin production was examined in all 324 transformed strains, and all produced wild type levels of gliotoxin. This indicates that disruption of tex1 specifically eliminates peptaibol synthesis and does not cause a general defect in secondary metabolite production. Here we demonstrate that T. virens, widely recognized as a biocontrol agent, produces peptaibol antibiotics. Several classes of peptaibols are produced by T. virens strain TV29-8 including 18-, 14-, and 11-amino acid residue peptides. The sequences of 3 of the 18 amino acid residue peptaibols, trichorzins TVB I, II, and IV, were determined. We have shown here that a large peptide synthetase (2.3 MDa) is responsible for production of all classes of peptaibols in T. virens. The evidence for this is (i) disruption mutants of tex1 failed to make peptaibols, (ii) domain homologies at both the N and C termini are consistent with the predicted functions necessary for acylation and reduction, respectively, and (iii) the gene sequence indicates that tex1 contains modules for the incorporation of 18 amino acid residues. The intron-less gene will encode a mature protein of 20,925 residues (∼2.3 MDa) encoded by a ∼63-kb mRNA. This gene would specify the largest mRNA and the largest continuous coding region known. Given these large sizes (a linear 63-kb mRNA would span 10 μm and exceed the diameter of the cell), it is of interest to understand how such large mRNAs and proteins are processed. For example, it is conceivable that translation of the peptide synthetase could initiate before completion of transcription of the gene. Because genes for secondary metabolite production are often found to be clustered (34Keller N.P. Hohn T.M. Fungal Genet. Biol. 1997; 21: 17-29Crossref Scopus (464) Google Scholar), additional genes required for synthesis or export of a mature peptaibol may be identified by further analysis of the flanking regions. Identification of homologs of a retrograde regulation protein (Rtg2p) and a calcium/proton exchanger downstream of tex1 suggests that a gene cluster for peptaibol production does not extend beyond the 3′ end of tex1. Preliminary sequence in a 2-kb region upstream of tex1 has not revealed homology to known proteins. The A domain of peptide synthetases contains 10 conserved motifs (22Stachelhaus T. Mootz H. Marahiel M.A. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 1999; 6: 493-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar) that are present in each of the modules of tex1. Likewise, the known conserved motifs in the T domains and C domains were also identified within each module. Amino acid residues 16–196 of the tex1 protein aligned over 80% of the length of ketoacyl synthase domains (pfam00109), typically found in polyketide synthases, with BLAST E value of 1e−11 (35Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar). Residues 416–703 aligned over 91% of the length of acyltransferase domains (pfam00698) (E value = 2e−43). We propose that these domains are responsible for the acetylation of the peptaibol N terminus in accordance with the colinearity of the domains with that of their products (32Weber T. Marahiel M.A. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 3-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Amino acid residues 20552–20781 aligned over 51% of the length of the 3 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase family (pfam01073) (E value = 3e−6) and aligns over 88% of the length of alcohol dehydrogenase domains (pfam00106) (E value = 0.003). We propose that this domain plays a role in the reductive cleavage of the final amino acid to generate the C-terminal alcohol. Therefore, the mature peptaibol synthetase may contain all of the enzymatic activities necessary to produce peptaibols. Nine residues in the active site of peptide synthetases have been proposed to play a major role in defining substrate specificity for incorporation of amino acids based on structural data (22Stachelhaus T. Mootz H. Marahiel M.A. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 1999; 6: 493-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). These residues define the signature sequences specifying amino acid incorporation. The signature sequences from the modules of tex1 are unique and do not exactly match the signature sequences found in other characterized NRPSs. Therefore, we could not use the signature sequences to make amino acid substrate assignments for the tex1 modules. However, we noted a very strong pattern in which the signature sequences of the 1st, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 16th modules were very similar (Table III). These may correspond to Aib residues found at positions 1, 9, 12, 15, and 16 of the TVB peptaibols. Modules 6 and 17 have identical residues at all 9 positions, and it is likely that these two modules incorporate the glutamate residues found in positions 6 and 17 in the peptaibols. Peptaibols are among the largest products known that are synthesized by NRPSs, and a tremendous variety of peptaibol sequences has been found. Indeed, T. virens and other peptaibol-producing organisms take advantage of combinatorial chemistry by producing a complex mixture of peptaibol compounds in culture filtrates. This is likely to be a result of the potential of the module to bind multiple substrates. In certain cases, the complexity can be manipulated by supplementing cultures with a specific amino acid (6Rebuffat, S., Goulard, C., and Bodo B. (1995) J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I 1849–1855Google Scholar). This suggests that the incorporation of amino acids into peptaibols reflects the availability of the cognate substrates rather than the existence of multiple NRPSs, each responsible for production of one member of the mixture. Our finding that a single mutation can eliminate all forms of peptaibols confirms this view. A recent publication reported the partial cloning and characterization of a peptide synthetase from T. virens with a sequence identical to the 3′ terminal 5 kb of tex1 (36Wilhite S.E. Lumsden R.D. Straney D.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 5055-5062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of this gene (psy1) was reported to cause partial or complete loss of hydroxymate siderophore production. The authors concluded that psy1 encodes an NRPS responsible for hydroxymate siderophore production. We believe this to be in error for the following reasons. First, the full sequence of the tex1(psy1) gene indicates that it synthesizes an 18-amino acid peptide. This is far larger than expected for an enzyme producing hydroxymate-containing siderophores. Second, Neurospora and Aspergillus species are also known producers of hydroxymate siderophores. The genome sequences of N. crassa and Aspergillus fumigatus are now available, and based on BLAST searches, neither genome contains a NRPS with 18 modules or strong sequence similarity to tex1 (psy1). In addition, preliminary growth experiments with our tex1 gene disruption strains did not reveal significant growth defects or deficiency in siderophore production on iron-deficient medium relative to the growth on iron-sufficient medium (37Schwyn B. Neilands J.B. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 160: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (4257) Google Scholar). Although unlikely, it is possible that certain alleles of tex1 affect siderophore production directly or indirectly. Here we report that peptaibols are produced by a peptide synthetase and the first characterization of a peptaibol synthetase gene. Cloning of additional peptaibol synthetases will facilitate generation of novel peptaibols by precisely replacing modules or making specific changes in the signature sequences. Manipulation of the abundance or sequence of peptaibols and heterologous expression of the T. virens peptaibol synthetase in other biocontrol fungi may prove to be useful tools in enhancing biocontrol activity."
https://openalex.org/W2095004534,"Sex chromosomes are generally believed to have descended from a pair of homologous autosomes. Suppression of recombination between the ancestral sex chromosomes led to the genetic degeneration of the Y chromosome. In response, the X chromosome may become dosage-compensated. Most proposed mechanisms for the degeneration of Y chromosomes involve the rapid fixation of deleterious mutations on the Y. Alternatively, Y-chromosome degeneration might be a response to a slower rate of adaptive evolution, caused by its lack of recombination. Here we report patterns of DNA polymorphism and divergence at four genes located on the neo-sex chromosomes of Drosophila miranda. We show that a higher rate of protein sequence evolution of the neo-X-linked copy of Cyclin B relative to the neo-Y copy is driven by positive selection, which is consistent with the adaptive hypothesis for the evolution of the Y chromosome. In contrast, the neo-Y-linked copies of even-skipped and roundabout show an elevated rate of protein evolution relative to their neo-X homologues, probably reflecting the reduced effectiveness of selection against deleterious mutations in a non-recombining genome. Our results provide evidence for the importance of sexual recombination for increasing and maintaining the level of adaptation of a population."
https://openalex.org/W2279323582,"Previous studies have demonstrated that Ca2+ is released from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in some models of apoptosis, but the mechanisms involved and the functional significance remain obscure. We confirmed that apoptosis induced by some (but not all) proapoptotic stimuli was associated with caspase-independent, BCL-2-sensitive emptying of the ER Ca2+ pool in human PC-3 prostate cancer cells. This mobilization of ER Ca2+ was associated with a concomitant increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ levels, and neither ER Ca2+ mobilization nor mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake occurred in Bax-null DU-145 cells. Importantly, restoration of DU-145 Bax expression via adenoviral gene transfer restored ER Ca2+ release and mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and dramatically accelerated the kinetics of staurosporine-induced cytochrome c release, demonstrating a requirement for Bax expression in this model system. In addition, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (RU-360) attenuated mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, cytochrome c release, and DNA fragmentation, directly implicating the mitochondrial Ca2+ changes in cell death. Together, our data demonstrate that Bax-mediated alterations in ER and mitochondrial Ca2+ levels serve as important upstream signals for cytochrome c release in some examples of apoptosis.

Commitment to cell death via apoptosis appears to require the activation of members of a family of aspartate-directed cysteine proteases known as caspases. Caspase activation is controlled in part by changes within mitochondria that lead to the release of polypeptide factors, including cytochrome c (1Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X.

A subfamily of proapoptotic BCL-2 family polypeptides may in fact be required for cytochrome c release because mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from Bax−/−Bak−/− mice fail to display cytochrome c release or downstream biochemical features of apoptosis after exposure to a variety of death stimuli in vitro (11Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3299) Google Scholar). However, the biochemical mechanisms underlying the effects of BCL-2 family polypeptides on mitochondria are still unclear. Another large body of evidence implicates alterations in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis in the control of apoptosis. We demonstrated in early studies that endogenous endonuclease activation proceeds via a Ca2+-dependent mechanism in thymocytes and certain other cell types exposed to a wide range of stimuli (12McConkey D.J. Orrenius S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). However, more recent studies indicate that alterations in subcellular Ca2+ compartmentalization can be detected in apoptotic cells that do not display global increases in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. Specifically, work by Lam et al. (13Lam M. Dubyak G. Distelhorst C.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 686-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) demonstrated that glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis was associated with early emptying of the endoplasmic reticular Ca2+ pool in W7MG1 mouse lymphoma cells (13Lam M.

Science. 1993; 262: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar), such that ER Ca2+ release leads to rapid Ca2+ accumulation within mitochondria (20Rizzuto R. Pinton P. Carrington W. Fay F.S.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Hajnoczky and co-workers (22Szalai G. Krishnamurthy R. Hajnoczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6349-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 23Pacher P. Hajnoczky G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4107-4121Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) have shown that 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate-mediated ER Ca2+ release results in mitochondrial Ca2+ increases that play an important role in promoting mitochondrial permeability transition and cytochrome c release in cells undergoing apoptosis in response to staurosporine treatment. We recently used adenoviral gene transfer to demonstrate that apoptosis induced by overexpression of Bax (and to a lesser extent, Bak) was associated with alterations in the ER and mitochondrial Ca2+ stores in human PC-3 prostate adenocarcinoma cells (24Nutt L.K.

Inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+uptake attenuated Bax-induced cytochrome c release and DNA fragmentation (24Nutt L.K. Pataer A. Pahler J. Fang B. Roth J. McConkey D.J. Swisher S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9219-9225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that the Ca2+fluxes participated directly in caspase activation and cell death. Whereas our study provided some of the first evidence that Bax and Bak can affect intracellular Ca2+ stores, it did not provide direct evidence that the effects were important for “endogenous” signals for apoptosis, such as staurosporine, Fas engagement, or exposure to DNA-damaging agents. Here we characterized the effects of several well-known proapoptotic stimuli on ER and mitochondrial Ca2+ fluxes in human PC-3 prostate adenocarcinoma cells and investigated whether or not these fluxes played a role in promoting cytochrome c release. In addition, we used another, Bax-deficient human prostate cancer cell line (DU-145) to determine whether or not these Ca2+ fluxes were dependent on cellular Bax expression. The results confirm and extend our previous observations and demonstrate that at least two mechanistically distinct pathways for cytochrome c release can exist within a given cell type, one that is dependent on ER-to-mitochondrial Ca2+ fluxes and another that is not. The esterified peptide caspase inhibitor Z-VAD (O-Me) was purchased from Enzyme System Products, Inc. (Dublin, CA). MG-132 and RU-360 were from Calbiochem. Anti-Fas antibody (CH-11; IgM) was from Kamiya Biomedical (Seattle, WA). Staurosporine, thapsigargin, and all other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. The PC-3 human prostatic adenocarcinoma line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum antibiotics, sodium pyruvate, and 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4). Stable transfectants overexpressing human BCL-2 were generated as described previously (24Nutt L.K. Pataer A. Pahler J. Fang B. Roth J. McConkey D.J. Swisher S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9219-9225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml Geneticin (G418; Invitrogen). Expression of BCL-2 was confirmed by immunoblotting with a monoclonal anti-BCL-2 antibody (6C8; generously provided by Dr. Timothy McDonnell, M. D. Anderson Cancer Center). Resistance to apoptosis was also verified in cells incubated for 24–48 h with staurosporine or thapsigargin. Construction of the Ad/GT-Bax, Ad/GT-LacZ, and Ad/GV16 vectors was reported previously (25Pataer A. Fang B., Yu, R. Kagawa S. Hunt K.K. McDonnell T.J. Roth J.A. Swisher S.G. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 788-792PubMed Google Scholar). The Ad/GT-Bax vector was constructed by placing Bax cDNA downstream of the GAL4/TATA promoter (GT) to generate the shuttle plasmid pAd/GT-Bax. This plasmid was cotransfected into 293 cells along with a 35-kb ClaI fragment purified from human adenoviral type 5 to generate the Ad/GT-Bax vector. Bak or Bax gene expression can then be induced in target tissues by coadministration of the Ad/GT-Bax vector with the second adenoviral vector in our system, Ad/GV16 (which produces the GAL4/GV16 fusion protein). Purified Ad/GT-Bax was obtained by expanding the virus in 293 cells, harvesting the supernatant of those cells, and then subjecting the supernatant to ultracentrifugation on a cesium chloride gradient. Virus titers were determined by optical absorbance at A260 (1 A260 unit = 1012 viral particles/ml). The transduction efficiencies of adenoviral vectors in various cancer cell lines were determined by infecting cells with Ad/GT-LacZ and then determining the titers needed to transduce at least 80% of the cells. These levels were achieved in PC-3 cells after treatment with Ad/GT-Bax (2000 viral particles) and Ad/GV16 (1000 viral particles) and treatment with Ad/GT-LacZ (2000 viral particles) and Ad/GV16 (1000 viral particles). We measured DNA fragmentation by propidium iodide staining and FACS analysis as described previously (26McConkey D.J. Greene G. Pettaway C.A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5594-5599PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were harvested, pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% sodium citrate. Samples were stored at 4 °C for 16 h and vortexed before FACS analysis (BD PharMingen FACScan; FL-3 channel). Cells were lysed in caspase-3 buffer (100 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, and 1 mm EDTA) with freshly added 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a complete mini-tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 1 h at 4 °C. Lysates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in a total of 2 ml of caspase-3 buffer containing 25 μm aspartate-glutamate-valine-aspartate aminomethyl coumarin (Bachem, King of Prussia, PA). Samples were excited at 380 nm and read at 460 nm in an RF-1501 spectrofluorometer (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia MD). Relative fluorescence was calculated by subtracting the blank fluorescence (buffer plus substrate only) from the sample fluorescence and dividing by the protein content of the sample (sample − blank/protein; fluorescence units/μg protein). Release of cytochrome c from mitochondria was measured by immunoblotting as described previously (27Chandra J. Niemer I. Gilbreath J. Kliche K.O. Andreeff M. Freireich E.J. Keating M. McConkey D.J. Blood. 1998; 92: 4220-4229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by centrifugation and gently lysed for 5 min in an ice-cold buffer containing 25 mm Tris and 5 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.4). Lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 16,000 × g, supernatants were mixed with 1× Laemmli's reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and extracts from equal numbers of cells (10–20 × 106) were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE. Polypeptides were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (0.2 μm;Schleicher & Schuell), and cytochrome c was detected by immunoblotting with the monoclonal antibody clone 7H8.2C12 (BD PharMingen). Cells plated on 22 × 30-mm glass coverslips were loaded with fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (AM) (10 μm; Molecular Probes) for 1 h at 37 °C with humidified air (5% CO2). The coverslips were washed thoroughly with phosphate-buffered saline and mounted on a 1.5-ml-volume chamber (with the cells facing upward). The chamber was placed on a epifluorescence/phase-contrast microscope for Ca2+ imaging and quantification. Cells were bathed in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+ at room temperature. Identical results were obtained when cells were bathed in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.5 mm EGTA. After a baseline cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was established, cells were then treated with thapsigargin (5 μm) to empty [Ca2+]ER stores. An INCA work station (Intracellular Imaging, Inc.) was used to quantify [Ca2+]i levels based on fura-2 fluorescence. The INCA software allowed for subtraction of background fluorescence. Fluorescence was monitored using a ×20 fluorescence objective. Cells were illuminated at alternating excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm using a xenon arc lamp. The emitted fluorescence was monitored at 511 nm with a video camera, and the calculated free [Ca2+]i was determined using the cell-free calibration curve. The data were collected with INCA software (Win 3.1 version). Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 5 ml of RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.2% fetal bovine serum. Rhod-2 AM (50 μg; Molecular Probes) was diluted to 0.5 μg/ml in Me2SO. Cells were loaded with Rhod-2 AM for 45 min, and the washed cells were analyzed in a spectrofluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences model LS 50 B) at 550 nm excitation and 578 nm emission. Analysis of washed, MitoTracker-counterstained cells by confocal microscopy confirmed that the vast majority of Rhod-2 fluorescence was associated with mitochondria. Furthermore, preincubation with the mitochondrial uncoupler CCCP reduced fluorescence levels to baseline and completely blocked the increases in fluorescence normally observed after stimulation with thapsigargin. To obtain fluorescence maxima and minima, cells were sequentially incubated with detergent and EGTA (10 mm, final concentration) in the presence of saturating concentrations of extracellular Ca2+. No differences in minimum Ca2+-dependent fluorescence were observed when CCCP was substituted for EGTA in these studies. Intramitochondrial Ca2+ concentrations were calculated by the following formula: [Ca2+] = (F −Fmin/Fmax –F) × Kd (Rhod-2) where F= fluorescence. Values are the means ± S.E. The number of experiments is shown in the legend of each figure. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance with Neuman-Keuls post hoc comparison. Previous work has shown that certain proapoptotic stimuli cause depletion of the endoplasmic reticular Ca2+ store (13Lam M. Dubyak G. Distelhorst C.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 686-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 14Baffy G. Miyashita T. Williamson J.R. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6511-6519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Lam M. Dubyak G. Chen L. Nunez G. Miesfeld R.L. Distelhorst C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To determine the prevalence and kinetics of this phenomenon, we treated human PC-3 prostate adenocarcinoma cells with several common death-inducing agents and measured their effects on ER Ca2+levels. Cells were preincubated with various death-promoting stimuli and loaded with the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye fura-2 AM, and ER Ca2+ content was measured indirectly by releasing the pool with the ER Ca2+ ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin. Representative fluorescence traces obtained using this technique in cells treated with staurosporine or the cancer chemotherapeutic agent Adriamycin (doxorubicin) are presented in Fig. 1 A, and quantitative data obtained in several experiments are presented in Fig. 1 B. Both staurosporine and Adriamycin promoted ER Ca2+ release several hours before cytochrome c release was first detected, but the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 and the anti-Fas antibody CH-11 did not (Fig. 1 B). Thus, ER Ca2+ release is associated with apoptosis induced by some (but not all) proapoptotic stimuli. The commitment phase of apoptosis involves activation of the caspase family of cysteine proteases. To determine whether or not ER Ca2+ pool depletion was a consequence of caspase activation, we measured staurosporine-induced pool depletion in cells preincubated with the pan-caspase inhibitor zVADfmk (20 μm). The inhibitor had no effect on ER Ca2+release (Fig. 2 B), although control experiments confirmed that it completely blocked caspase activation (measured using a fluorogenic dye; Fig. 2 B). These results confirm that ER Ca2+ release occurs upstream of caspase activation. As described above, previous studies have shown that BCL-2 localizes to the ER, where it may regulate ER Ca2+ homeostasis. To test the effects of BCL-2 in our model system, we stably transfected the PC-3 cells with BCL-2 and characterized their responses to staurosporine. Immunoblotting confirmed that the transfectants expressed high levels of BCL-2 (Fig. 3 A), and functional studies demonstrated that staurosporine-induced DNA fragmentation was reduced in the transfectants (Fig. 3 B). Consistent with some of the earlier studies, staurosporine failed to induce ER Ca2+pool depletion in the BCL-2 transfectants (Fig. 3 C), an effect that was associated with reduced staurosporine-stimulated cytochrome c release from mitochondria (Fig. 3 D). Recent studies have shown that pseudosynaptic contacts exist between the ER and mitochondrial Ca2+ pools (19Rizzuto R. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Science. 1993; 262: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar), such that release of Ca2+ from ER stores can result in rapid Ca2+uptake by mitochondria (20Rizzuto R. Pinton P. Carrington W. Fay F.S. Fogarty K.E. Lifshitz L.M. Tuft R.A. Pozzan T. Science. 1998; 280: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar, 21Csordas G. Thomas A.P. Hajnoczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the effects of staurosporine on mitochondrial Ca2+ levels in PC-3 cells loaded with the mitochondrial Ca2+ probe Rhod-2 AM; representative fluorescence traces obtained using this technique are presented in Fig. 4 A. Ca2+-independent (background) fluorescence was measured by treating cells with the protonophore CCCP, which completely releases the mitochondrial Ca2+ pool, and levels of this background fluorescence were nearly indistinguishable in the cells under all conditions examined (Fig. 4 A). Control experiments also confirmed that all of the Rhod-2 was confined to mitochondria. Exposure of PC-3 cells to staurosporine resulted in a significant increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration that was completely abolished by overexpression of BCL-2 (Fig. 4 B). To investigate the relationship between mitochondrial Ca2+uptake and cytochrome c release, we compared the levels of cytochrome c release observed in staurosporine-treated cells in the absence or presence of a chemical inhibitor of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (RU-360). A representative immunoblot obtained in these experiments is shown in Fig. 4 C, and quantitative results obtained in multiple experiments are presented in Fig. 4 D. RU-360 significantly reduced staurosporine-induced cytochrome c release (Fig. 4, C and D) and DNA fragmentation (Fig. 4 F), but it had no effect on Fas-mediated cytochrome c release (Fig. 4 E). Together, these results demonstrate that mitochondrial Ca2+uptake is important for staurosporine-induced apoptosis and confirm that Fas-mediated apoptosis occurs via Ca2+-independent mechanisms, at least in the PC-3 model system. We recently showed that overexpression of Bax via adenoviral gene transfer resulted in early, caspase-independent depletion of the ER Ca2+ pool and apoptosis (24Nutt L.K. Pataer A. Pahler J. Fang B. Roth J. McConkey D.J. Swisher S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9219-9225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). These observations suggested to us that staurosporine's effects on the ER and mitochondrial Ca2+ pools might be mediated by Bax. To directly test this hypothesis, we characterized the effects of staurosporine on ER (Fig. 5 A) and mitochondrial (Fig. 5 B) Ca2+ pools in the Bax-deficient human prostate cancer cell line DU-145. Consistent with the hypothesis, staurosporine failed to induce significant ER Ca2+ pool depletion or mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in the parental DU-145 cells. Importantly, reconstitution of Bax expression via adenoviral gene transfer restored staurosporine's effects on the ER (Fig. 5 A, right bars) and mitochondrial (Fig. 5 B, right bars) Ca2+ pools and dramatically accelerated the kinetics of staurosporine-induced cytochrome c release (Fig. 5 C). Because mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake appears to be involved in promoting cytochrome c release and downstream features of apoptosis, these Bax-mediated Ca2+ changes appeared to directly promote apoptotic cell death. Finally, we turned our attention to the paradoxical observation that staurosporine stimulated apoptosis more rapidly than the Ca2+-mobilizing agent thapsigargin, even though the effects of thapsigargin on intracellular Ca2+ fluxes were more rapid than those of staurosporine. Specifically, thapsigargin caused immediate ER Ca2+ release and subsequent RU-360-sensitive mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in PC-3 cells (Fig. 6 A), but it did not promote cytochrome c release (Fig. 6 C) or DNA fragmentation (Fig. 6 B) until much later (>18 h after exposure). These kinetics of cytochrome c release and DNA fragmentation are consistent with previous findings (11Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R.

Zhu H. Morishima N., Li, E., Xu, J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2912) Google Scholar). These data suggested to us that staurosporine's effects on mitochondrial Ca2+ might cooperate with other effects (i.e. pore formation and interaction with the permeability transition pore complex) to promote cytochrome c release. To directly test this possibility, we measured thapsigargin-induced cytochrome c release in PC-3 cells that had been pretreated with staurosporine for 4 h. At this time point, staurosporine-induced ER Ca2+ release was submaximal (Fig. 1, A and B), and no cytochrome c release had occurred (Fig. 6 D). Thapsigargin induced a nearly immediate release of cytochrome c (within 5–15 min) in the staurosporine-pretreated cells (Fig. 6 D), confirming that staurosporine sensitized mitochondria to efflux of Ca2+ from the ER. The mechanisms probably involved direct effects of Bax and/or other proapoptotic members of the BCL-2 family because previous work has established that Bax translocates to mitochondria in response to staurosporine exposure (31Wolter K.G.

In addition, exogenous Bax sensitizes mitochondria to Ca2+-mediated cytochrome c release, but Ca2+-independent effects of Bax are also involved (24Nutt L.K. Pataer A. Pahler J. Fang B. Roth J.

Whereas our results establish a novel role for Bax-mediated Ca2+ changes in apoptosis, they do not identify the biochemical mechanisms involved in the effects of Bax on Ca2+. Previous studies have shown that Bax can form transmembrane ion channels in planar lipid bilayers (Refs. 35Minn A.J. Velez P. Schendel S.L. Liang H. Muchmore S.W. Fesik S.W. Fill M. Thompson C.B.

Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) and tetramerize in response to proapoptotic signals to form larger pores capable of directly accommodating cytochrome c release (40Wei M.C.

Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Thus, one simple explanation for our data would be that Bax forms transmembrane cation (i.e. Ca2+) channels that allow for Ca2+ to flow down its concentration gradient from the ER into mitochondria. However, previous studies have shown that the channels initially formed by Bax in lipid bilayers are selective for monovalent anions (Cl−) rather than divalent cations such as Ca2+ (39Schendel S.L. Montal M. Reed J.C. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that Bax must assemble into higher order structures to exert its effects on ER and mitochondrial Ca2+ and that its Ca2+-independent effects on mitochondria involve some other activity of the protein. The latter may be explained by previous studies that demonstrated that proapoptotic BCL-2 family members interact with components of the permeability transition pore (8Marzo I. Brenner C. Zamzami N. Jurgensmeier J.M. Susin S.A. Vieira H.L. Prevost M.C. Xie Z. Matsuyama S. Reed J.C. Kroemer G. Science. 1998; 281: 2027-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar, 9Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar), which is a Ca2+-sensitive, mitochondrial polypeptide complex that has been implicated in some pathways of cytochrome c release by other investigators (42Kroemer G. Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 44-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). Recent work by others has demonstrated that Bax and Bak play redundant roles in promoting cytochrome c release in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (11Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3299) Google Scholar), and our own previous findings demonstrated that both Bax and Bak can promote ER Ca2+ pool emptying and mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake (24Nutt L.K. Pataer A. Pahler J. Fang B. Roth J. McConkey D.J. Swisher S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9219-9225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). We were therefore surprised that staurosporine failed to cause alterations in the ER or mitochondrial Ca2+ pools in DU-145 cells because these cells retain wild-type Bak. We did confirm that staurosporine-induced Ca2+ fluxes were attenuated in mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from Bax−/− mice (data not shown). However, it was difficult to obtain satisfactory Ca2+ dye loading in the cells, and our failure to detect residual Bak-mediated Ca2+ changes may have been limited by the lower sensitivity of our methods in the cells. We have no reason to expect that other “multidomain” proapoptotic BCL-2 family members are incapable of mediating effects on Ca2+ similar to those described here, although our experience with Bax and Bak in PC-3 cells suggests that Bax is significantly more potent (24Nutt L.K. Pataer A. Pahler J. Fang B. Roth J. McConkey D.J. Swisher S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9219-9225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). It is possible that the involvement of Ca2+ fluxes in cytochrome c release varies not only with the proapoptotic stimulus in question but also with cellular background because human prostate cancer cells are notoriously sensitive to Ca2+-mediated apoptosis. Although BCL-2 did not affect steady-state levels of Ca2+in the ER or mitochondria in the PC-3 cells, it did inhibit the effects of staurosporine on ER Ca2+ release and subsequent mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. These observations suggest that BCL-2 acts primarily to antagonize the effects of proapoptotic stimuli in our cells and does not exert direct effects of its own on either Ca2+ pool. It should be stressed, however, that other laboratories have reported different effects of BCL-2 on intracellular Ca2+ pools. For example, at least three groups have shown that BCL-2 lowers the steady-state level of Ca2+ within the ER, which they argued inhibits apoptosis by reducing Ca2+efflux across the ER membrane (15Lam M. Dubyak G. Chen L. Nunez G. Miesfeld R.L. Distelhorst C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6569-6573Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 18Foyouzi-Youssefi R. Arnaudeau S. Borner C.

Rapizzi E., Di Virgilio F.D. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2690-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). In contrast, another group showed that overexpression of BCL-2 increased steady-state levels of ER Ca2+ (44Kuo T.H. Kim H.R. Zhu L., Yu, Y. Lin H.M. Tsang W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1903-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Murphy et al. (17Murphy A.N. Bredesen D.E. Cortopassi G. Wang E. Fiskum G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although we cannot explain these contrasting findings at present, they are probably related to the use of different cellular model systems; hematopoietic cells and excitable cells (neurons) are likely to regulate intracellular Ca2+ compartmentalization very differently from epithelial cells. Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated that high and low levels of BCL-2 can exert different effects on cells (45Shinoura N. Yoshida Y. Nishimura M. Muramatsu Y. Asai A. Kirino T. Hamada H. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4119-4128PubMed Google Scholar, 46Wang N.S. Unkila M.T. Reineks E.Z. Distelhorst C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44117-44128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that we would have observed direct effects of BCL-2 on ER and/or mitochondrial Ca2+ pools in PC-3 cells expressing different levels of BCL-2 protein. BCL-2 is capable of interacting with a variety of different proteins, some of which are involved in Ca2+-associated signal transduction (i.e. the Ca2+-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin) (47Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar), and BCL-2's activity is regulated by phosphorylation (48Haldar S. Jena N. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It therefore appears likely that cellular context dictates precisely how BCL-2 will influence intracellular Ca2+ pools. Additional efforts are required to more precisely define the biochemical mechanisms involved in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ compartmentalization by the different members of the BCL-2 family."

https://openalex.org/W2049366686,"Seismological observations reveal highly anisotropic patches at the bottom of the Earth's lower mantle, whereas the bulk of the mantle has been observed to be largely isotropic. These patches have been interpreted to correspond to areas where subduction has taken place in the past or to areas where mantle plumes are upwelling, but the underlying cause for the anisotropy is unknown-both shape-preferred orientation of elastically heterogeneous materials and lattice-preferred orientation of a homogeneous material have been proposed. Both of these mechanisms imply that large-strain deformation occurs within the anisotropic regions, but the geodynamic implications of the mechanisms differ. Shape-preferred orientation would imply the presence of large elastic (and hence chemical) heterogeneity whereas lattice-preferred orientation requires deformation at high stresses. Here we show, on the basis of numerical modelling incorporating mineral physics of elasticity and development of lattice-preferred orientation, that slab deformation in the deep lower mantle can account for the presence of strong anisotropy in the circum-Pacific region. In this model-where development of the mineral fabric (the alignment of mineral grains) is caused solely by solid-state deformation of chemically homogeneous mantle material-anisotropy is caused by large-strain deformation at high stresses, due to the collision of subducted slabs with the core-mantle boundary."

Such interfacial layering of simple liquids has been theoretically predicted, but observational evidence has been ambiguous. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the density variation induced by the layering will cause xenon, confined to an approximately cubic cavity of volume approximately 8 cubic nanometers, to condense into the body-centered cubic phase, differing from the face-centered cubic phase of both bulk solid xenon and solid xenon confined in somewhat larger (>/=20 cubic nanometer) tetradecahedral cavities in face-centered cubic metals. Layering at the liquid-solid interface plays an important role in determining physical properties as diverse as the rheological behavior of two-dimensionally confined liquids and the dynamics of crystal growth."

However, it is not yet clear how individual TRAFs regulate signaling by this large and growing receptor family. Signaling via the TNF-R family member CD40 has recently been shown to result in recruitment of TRAF2 to plasma membrane detergent-resistant microdomains (lipid rafts) as well as to subsequently initiate TRAF2 degradation. As TRAF2 associates with most members of the TNF-R family, we wished to determine how this degradation occurs. We show here that CD40-mediated TRAF2 degradation requires the zinc-binding RING domain of TRAF2 and is preceded by TRAF2 ubiquitination, suggesting that the TRAF2 RING may promote ubiquitination although the RING itself is not a target of ubiquitination.

A key feature in the signal transduction pathways of members of this family is their association with intracellular adapter proteins called TRAFs. Although loss- and gain-of-function experiments have demonstrated the importance of TRAFs in mediating signaling by TNF-R members (3Arch R.H. Gedrich R.W. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2821-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), it is still unclear how individual TRAFs regulate signaling pathways or how they themselves are regulated. The TRAF molecule that has received the greatest attention to date is TRAF2, one of the two prototypic TRAFs first isolated as associating with TNF-R2 (4Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar) and subsequently found to interact with TNF-R1, CD40, (5Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar), and a wide variety of other TNF-R family molecules. Additionally, TRAF2 binds the cytoplasmic domain of latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) (6Devernge O. Hatzivassiliou E. Izumi K.M. Kaye K.M. Kleijnen M.F. Kieff E. Mosialos G. Mol. Cell.

A striking result of this analysis was that although both CD40 and LMP1 recruit TRAF2 to lipid rafts in the plasma membrane, CD40, but not LMP1, subsequently promotes TRAF2 degradation, and this difference is associated with sustained and amplified signaling by LMP1 (9Brown K.D. Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). CD40 stimulation of normal resting mouse splenic B cells also induces TRAF2 degradation. 2K. D. Brown and G. A. Bishop, unpublished results. These findings suggest that TRAF2 degradation may be an important component of normal signaling by TNF-R family molecules, an idea supported by the demonstration that CD30 signaling also stimulates a loss of cellular TRAF2 (10Duckett C.S. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2810-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The present work was instigated to better understand the molecular mechanisms by which TRAF2 degradation is mediated. The TRAF2 molecule is composed of an N-terminal RING domain, a series of zinc fingers, and a conserved C-terminal TRAF domain that contains the region for binding to TNF-R family members and for promoting association of TRAF2 with itself and other TRAF molecules (4Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Interestingly, certain other signaling molecules that contain RING domains are reported to promote their own degradation or degradation of other proteins with which they interact, by stimulating ubiquitination (11Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K. Reiss Y. Ciechanover A. Lipkowitz S. Yarden Y. Mol.

A. 1999; 96: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). This ubiquitination and degradation is dependent upon the RING domain of these molecules, which may serve as an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, although this specific role has thus far only been demonstrated in vitro. As CD40-induced TRAF2 degradation requires the activity of the 26 S proteasome (9Brown K.D. Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) (which classically degrades ubiquitinated proteins) and TRAF2 contains a RING domain, we wished to determine whether CD40 initiates TRAF2 degradation by promoting its ubiquitination in a RING-dependent manner. Data presented here support this hypothesis and additionally indicate that blocking TRAF2 ubiquitination or proteasomal degradation potentiates initiation of CD40 signals. The mouse B cell line M12.4.1 (13Hamano T. Kim K.J. Leiserson W.M. Asofsky R. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 1403-1411PubMed Google Scholar) was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 μm2-mercaptoethanol, and antibiotics. Transfected B cell subclones were maintained in culture medium supplemented with 400 μg/ml G418 sulfate (Invitrogen); some subclones were also grown in 500 μg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen). Cell lines containing inducible wild-type mTRAF2 or inducible mTRAF2ΔRING have been previously described (14Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J.

Subclones stably expressing HA-tagged ubiquitin were prepared in our laboratory, by transfecting M12.4.1 with a plasmid expressing ubiquitin driven by an RSV promoter (see below). The Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines E36 and ts-20 were a kind gift from Dr. Alan Schwartz (Washington University, St. Louis, MO) and were transfected with human CD40 (hCD40) and TRAF2 as previously described (16Hostager B.S.

The following antibodies were produced from hybridomas provided as generous gifts from the indicated individuals: anti-mouse CD40 (1C10, rat IgG2a) from Dr. Frances Lund (Trudeau Institute, Saranac Lake, NY), and anti-mouse IgE (EM95.3, rat IgG2a isotype control) from Dr. Thomas Waldschmidt (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA).

Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Mouse TRAF2 constructs expressed inducibly contained LacR binding sites upstream of the cDNA insertion site in the plasmid and were transfected into subclones of M12.4.1 stably constitutively expressing LacR. Expression is induced by incubation in the presence of IPTG, as described in detail previously (7Busch L.K. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2555-2561PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6307-6311PubMed Google Scholar). Inducible constructs of wild-type mTRAF2 and the mutant mTRAF2ΔRING were produced as described (14Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6307-6311PubMed Google Scholar). C34S, K21R, and K31R/K38R mutants of mTRAF2 were generated utilizing a point mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's directions. The HA-ubitquitin construct was produced by subcloning HA-ubiquitin from a plasmid obtained from Dr. Dirk Bohmann (European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany) (18Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar) into pRSV.zeo. This expression vector was produced in our laboratory by replacing the cytomegalovirus promoter of pcDNA3.zeo (Invitrogen) with the RSV promoter from the pRSV.5(neo) plasmid (19Long E.O. Rosen-Bronson S. Karp D.R. Malnati M. Sekaly R.P. Jaraquemada D. Hum. Immunol. 1991; 31: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Transfection of M12.4.1 cells by electroporation has been previously described (16Hostager B.S. Hsing Y. Harms D.E. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1047-1053PubMed Google Scholar). For these studies, the M12.Lac subclone expressing the bacterial LacR (7Busch L.K. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2555-2561PubMed Google Scholar) was used. Drug-resistant subclones containing inducible TRAF2 molecules or constitutively expressed HA-ubiquitin were examined by intracellular staining for FLAG and/or HA utilizing a FACScan flow cytometer (BD PharMingen). Temperature-sensitive (ts-20) and parent (E36) CHO cell lines were initially transfected with wild-type hCD40 cDNA containing a zeocin resistance marker, and zeocin-resistant clones of ts-20 cells expressing hCD40 were isolated by subcloning. High hCD40-expressing E36 cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Both ts-20 and E36 cell lines expressing hCD40 were then transfected with a FLAG-mTRAF2 construct containing a neomycin resistance gene. E36 and ts-20 cell lines express similar levels of hCD40 (data not shown). In earlier studies of TRAF function in B cells, we found that these cells do not express large amounts of endogenous TRAF proteins. Thus, to create as biologically valid a signaling system as possible, we developed a method to stably and inducibly express transfected TRAFs in cell lines (14Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6307-6311PubMed Google Scholar), as described above. Using this method, as previously described (14Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6307-6311PubMed Google Scholar), levels of transfected TRAFs only slightly above endogenous levels are routinely induced, rather than the gross overproduction often obtained in many transiently transfected epithelial and fibroblast cell lines. Degradation of inducible wild-type or mutant FLAG-tagged TRAF2 was stimulated following 18 h of incubation with 0.1 mmIPTG to induce expression of tagged TRAF2 (107 cells). After IPTG incubation, cells were stimulated for 120 min with 1 μg/ml anti-CD40 or isotype control mAbs. Following stimulation in experiments with cells inducibly expressing TRAF2ΔRING, total lysates were prepared as described above. This mutant TRAF is of a different molecular weight than endogenous TRAF2, and the two can therefore be discriminated by their sizes. Lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and subjected to Western blotting. Anti-FLAG immunoprecipitations were performed to permit examination of degradation of point mutants of mouse TRAF2, because mutant and endogenous TRAF2 are the same molecular weight, and anti-FLAG blotting of total cell lysates is too nonspecific to permit definitive identification of mutant TRAF2. Cells were lysed and sonicated in octylglucoside buffer, and immunoprecipitations were performed as previously described (20Busch L.K. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5805-5813Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Dependence of TRAF2 degradation upon an intact ubiquitination system was examined by plating 5 × 106 hCD40 + TRAF2-transfected CHO cells of the parent cell line E36 or the ts-20 cell line containing temperature-sensitive E1 enzyme for 18 h in 35-mm dishes to allow adherence. Cells were then preincubated for 2 h at either 37 °C (permissive) or 42 °C (non-permissive) temperatures and stimulated for 2 h with either 1 μg/ml anti-hCD40 (G28–5) or mouse IgG1 isotype control Ab (MOPC-21). Following stimulation cells were removed from the plate using 0.1 mm EDTA and pelleted, lysed, and sonicated in octylglucoside buffer. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (20Busch L.K. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5805-5813Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). M12.4.1 cells stably transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin and IPTG-inducible, FLAG-tagged mTRAF2 were incubated overnight in the presence or absence of 100 μmIPTG. Cells (1 × 107 in 200 μl of culture medium) were stimulated for 15 min at 37 °C with Sf9 or Sf9-mCD154. The insect cells were used as stimulus in these assays to avoid inadvertent precipitation of unmodified TRAF2 due to the ability of stimulating anti-CD40 Abs to bind protein G. Cells were lysed in 400 μl of lysis buffer (0.1% SDS, 1.0% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and protease inhibitors). Immunoprecipitations were performed as above, and precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. To measure c-Jun kinase (JNK) activation in the presence or absence of proteasomal inhibition, cells were preincubated in the presence or absence of 50 μmMG132 (21Oda H. Kumar S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9557-9562Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and then stimulated for 15, 30, or 60 min with 2 μg/ml anti-CD40, or 60 min with 2 μg/ml isotype control mAbs. Cell lysates were prepared and JNK activity measured as previously described (22Hsing Y. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2804-2811PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were separated by SDS-PAGE and phosphorylated c-Jun visualized by autoradiography of dried gels. Previous studies have indicated that other RING-containing proteins can undergo ubiquitination and degradation in a manner dependent upon their RING domains (23Freemont P.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R84-R87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If the TRAF2 RING serves this function, its removal should block TRAF2 degradation. To test this prediction, we used a previously described TRAF2 truncation mutant lacking the RING domain (T2ΔRING); this mutant binds CD40 similarly to WT TRAF2 (14Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6307-6311PubMed Google Scholar). FLAG epitope-tagged mutant TRAF2 molecules were inducibly and stably expressed in the CD40-responsive mouse B cell line M12.4.1. A minimum of two subclones expressing each molecule were tested (not shown). Stimulation of the B cells with agonistic anti-mCD40 mAb led to degradation of endogenous TRAF2 as early as 10 min following stimulation with only ∼ 10% of the cellular TRAF2 remaining after 2 h of stimulation (Fig. 1, A and D). In contrast, however, CD40 stimulation did not induce appreciable degradation of inducibly expressed T2ΔRING (Fig. 1, B and D). This failure to induce degradation of the mutant is not due to the presence of the epitope tag on the molecule, as WT FLAG-tagged TRAF2 is degraded by CD40 stimulation (Figs.2 and 4, bottom). These data thus demonstrate a specific requirement for the RING domain in CD40-induced TRAF2 degradation.Figure 2Requirement for an intact TRAF2 RING finger but not RING domain lysines in CD40-induced TRAF2 degradation. A, M12.4.1 cells stably inducibly expressing FLAG-WT TRAF2 or the TRAF2 point mutants C34S, K21R, and K31R/K38R were induced with IPTG and stimulated as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Following stimulation cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with α-FLAG. FLAG precipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted for TRAF2.

First, as discussed earlier, the RING structure itself could serve to promote ubiquitin ligation. However, there are also three lysine residues present in this domain. It was therefore possible that ubiquitination targets one or more of these residues, and the removal of the entire RING abrogates degradation because the target for ubiquitination has been removed. To test both these possibilities, we constructed a series of TRAF2 point mutants. Two of these mutants remove between them all three of the lysine residues in the TRAF2 RING domain (K21R, K31R/K38R). We also constructed a cysteine to serine point mutant at the first cysteine residue in the RING (C34S). This mutation has been previously reported to disrupt RING structure (12Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). All mutants were stably and inducibly expressed in M12.4.1 B cells and all bind CD40 similarly to WT TRAF2 (not shown). Stimulation of B cells with anti-mCD40 led to degradation of transfected WT mouse TRAF2, as well as both K21R and K31R/K38R TRAF2 mutants (Fig. 2 A); the latter appears to show higher than WT degradation, but most of this apparent effect is due to its overall lower inducible expression (see quantitation in Fig. 2 B). Fig. 2 demonstrates that only the C34S mutant was unaffected by CD40 stimulation. As none of the three lysines in the RING domain prevented TRAF2 degradation, it is unlikely that ubiquitination is targeting these residues. Mutation of Cys-34 to serine, however, led to a marked block in TRAF2 degradation in response to CD40 stimulation (Fig. 2), indicating that the RING structure is required. All three of the FLAG-tagged mutants and WT mTRAF2 were recruited into membrane raft fractions after CD40 stimulation (data not shown). Ubiquitination is a multistep process requiring the sequential activity of three classes of enzymes (24Hochstrasser M. Curr. Biol. 1995; 7: 215-223Crossref Scopus (784) Google Scholar): ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s), and ubiquitin protein ligases (E3s). The process of ubiquitination is initiated by the formation of a high energy thiol ester linkage between E1 and ubiquitin, which is then transferred to an E2 enzyme by the formation of another thiol ester linkage. The formation of an isopeptide bond between the substrate protein and ubiquitin is subsequently catalyzed by an E3 enzyme that also promotes the further addition of ubiquitin moieties. The net effect of these reactions is to catalyze the addition of a polyubiquitin chain to the protein substrate targeted for degradation by the 26 S proteasome. Polyubiquitinated protein is visualized on Western blot as a smear of high molecular weight species (12Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). Previously, we demonstrated that TRAF2 is recruited to cholesterol-rich membrane rafts following CD40 ligation and that raft-localized TRAF2 is modified by a higher molecular weight smear above the main protein band (15Hostager B.S. Catlett I.M. Bishop G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15392-15398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, commercially available ubiquitin-specific Abs usually fail to detect proteins modified with one or a small number of ubiquitin residues, although such modification has also been shown to regulate protein trafficking (25Lafont F. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3180-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, to allow detection of all levels of ubiquitin modification, we used a subclone of M12.4.1 stably expressing HA epitope-tagged ubiquitin, together with inducibly expressed FLAG-mTRAF2. Fig. 3 A demonstrates induction of TRAF2 expression in this subclone. Fig. 3 B is an anti-FLAG blot of TRAF2 that was precipitated with anti-HA Ab and thus has one or more ubiquitin residues attached. It can be seen that both monoubiquitinated and polyubiquitinated forms of TRAF2 were significantly increased in cells stimulated through CD40. Re-probing of this blot with anti-HA (Fig. 3 C) shows that total amounts of ubiquitinated (HA-tagged) proteins did not differ between immunoprecipitates from stimulated versus unstimulated cells. The results in Fig. 3, together with our prior finding that TRAF2 degradation depends upon the 26 S proteasome (9Brown K.D. Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) indicate that TRAF2 ubiquitination follows CD40 stimulation. To determine whether CD40-induced TRAF2 degradation is ubiquitin-dependent, we stably transfected a previously characterized CHO cell line (ts-20) (26Kulka R.G. Raboy B. Schuster R. Parag H.A. Diamond G. Ciechanover A. Marcus M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15726-15731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing a temperature-sensitive mutant of E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme and its parent cell line (E36) with hCD40 and FLAG-tagged mTRAF2. Transfected CHO subclones were selected to express similar levels of hCD40 (not shown). As mammalian cells contain only one known E1 enzyme, disruption of the activity of the ts E1 enzyme by increasing the temperature to 42 °C inhibits the process of ubiquitination by >90% compared with WT protein-ubiquitin-conjugating capacity (27Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Stimulation of both transfected E36 and ts-20 cell lines with anti-hCD40 at 37 °C promoted TRAF2 degradation (Fig. 4,A–C), although the extent of degradation in the epithelial cells at 37 °C (15–20%) was less than in B cells. Stimulation of transfected E36 cell lines at 42 °C increased degradation to between 40–60%, likely due to enhanced enzyme kinetics with increased temperature (Fig. 4, A and C). In marked contrast, transfected ts-20 cell lines stimulated with anti-hCD40 at 42 °C showed <15% CD40-induced TRAF2 degradation (Fig. 4,B and C). These data demonstrate dependence of CD40-induced TRAF2 degradation on ubiquitination. Degradation of IκBα, a protein known to be ubiquitinated and proteasomally degraded by NF-κB activating stimuli such as CD40, was also inhibited at 42 °C in transfected ts-20 cell lines (Fig. 4 D). Previous work in our laboratory demonstrated enhanced B cell activation in response to signaling through WT-LMP1 or a chimeric hCD40-LMP1 receptor compared with signaling through WT-hCD40 or a LMP1-hCD40 chimera (9Brown K.D. Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This enhanced signaling capacity correlates with a lack of TRAF degradation following LMP1 activation, whereas proteasome-dependent TRAF2 and TRAF3 degradation begins as early as 5 min after CD40 stimulation (9Brown K.D. Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar,15Hostager B.S. Catlett I.M. Bishop G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15392-15398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Although these correlative data are provocative, we wished to test directly whether ubiquitin-dependent TRAF2 degradation could normally limit CD40-mediated B cell activation. As TRAF2 is required for CD40-mediated JNK activation (28Lee S.Y. Reichlin A. Santana A. Sokol K.A. Nussenzweig M.C. Choi Y. Immunity. 1997; 7: 701-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 29Yeh W. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Billia F. Wakeham A. de la Pampa J.L. Ferrick D. Hum B. Iscove N. Ohashi P. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Immunity. 1997; 7: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar), and the JNK pathway plays an important role in B cell activation by CD40 (30Bishop G.A. Hostager B.S. Arch. Immun. Ther. Exper. 2001; 49: 129-137PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the effect of proteasome inhibition on CD40-mediated JNK activation. M12.hCD40 cells were preincubated for 2 h in the presence/absence of MG132 (a 26 S proteasomal inhibitor) before stimulation with either anti-CD40 or an isotype control Ab. Stimulation of untreated cells with anti-CD40 led to a striking (>10-fold) increase in JNK activity at 15 min, but by 30 min this activity was markedly decreased and by 60 min returned to baseline levels (Fig. 5,A and B). Stimulation of MG132-treated B cells with anti-CD40 led to a similar increase in JNK activity, but this activity was approximately twice as high as that stimulated in the absence of proteasome inhibitor. Additionally, JNK activity was sustained. At 30 min, when CD40-stimulated JNK activity is normally reduced by 3–5-fold compared with its peak at 15 min, activity was still at peak levels in MG132-treated cells. Although even in these cells, JNK activity began to decline at 60 min, the level was still similar to the peak level attained in the absence of MG132 (Fig. 5 B). These data demonstrate that CD40-mediated JNK activation, a signal dependent upon TRAF2, is potentiated by inhibition of 26 S proteasome activity. The osmotic stressor, sorbitol, also increases B cell JNK activity in a TRAF2-independent manner (15Hostager B.S. Catlett I.M. Bishop G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15392-15398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar); sorbitol-mediated activation was unaffected by MG132 treatment (not shown). This is consistent with the hypothesis that CD40-mediated JNK activation, a TRAF2-dependent pathway, is negatively regulated by ubiquitination. As shown previously (9Brown K.D. Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), Fig. 5 C demonstrates that CD40-induced TRAF2 degradation is inhibited by MG132 (as well as IκBα, a positive control). However, neither CD40 itself nor TRAF1 are degraded in response to CD40 stimulation, and there is no effect by MG132 treatment. Considerable investigation by many laboratories has indicated that TRAF molecules play key roles in signaling by the TNF-R family, and TRAF2 associates with many members of this family. Why, then, would it be normal and desirable for these receptors to induce TRAF2 degradation? A number of possible explanations are worth considering. First, our recent comparison of signaling to B cells by two receptors that utilize TRAF2 indicate that a virally encoded receptor required for EBV-mediated transformation, LMP1, lacks the ability to induce degradation of TRAF2, an ability that CD40 clearly possesses (Ref. 9Brown K.D. Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholarand present study). This lack of TRAF degradation correlates with B cell signals from LMP1 that are amplified and sustained compared with those delivered by CD40 (9Brown K.D. Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These findings are extended in the present report by the observation that directly decreasing TRAF2 degradation using a proteasome inhibitor potentiates one of the earliest measurable events in CD40 signaling, the activation of JNK. Interestingly, the elevated and sustained JNK activation seen by CD40 in the presence of proteasome inhibition is similar to LMP1-induced JNK activation (9Brown K.D. Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Our results thus strongly suggest that receptor-mediated TRAF degradation is integral to normal feedback regulation of signaling pathways mediated by TNF-R family molecules, such as CD40. An earlier report indicating that CD30 signaling in T cells is also associated with a loss of TRAF2 (10Duckett C.S. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2810-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) is consistent with this hypothesis. More recently, it was reported that TRAF6 degradation can be induced during RANKL signaling but not by receptor engagement itself; rather by ligation of the receptor for interferon-γ (31Takayanagi H. Ogasawara K. Hida S. Chiba T. Murata S. Sato K. Takaoka A. Yokochi T. Oda H. Nakamura K. Taniguchi T. Nature. 2000; 408: 600-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). Many TNF-R family molecules associate with more than one type of TRAF some of which (e.g. TRAFs 1 and 2) can heterodimerize and some (e.g. TRAFs 2 and 3) that bind to overlapping regions on the receptor molecule. It is thus likely that the stoichiometry and specific composition of receptor-associated signaling complexes changes during the course of a receptor-mediated signaling cascade, and such changes may be important to the effector functions of the receptor on specific cell types. For example, our earlier studies showed that TRAF6 plays important roles in CD40-mediated B cell functions (32Jalukar S.V. Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, while TRAFs 2 and 3 are rapidly modified and degraded following CD40 engagement in B cells (Refs. 9Brown K.D. Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar and 15Hostager B.S. Catlett I.M. Bishop G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15392-15398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar and present study), TRAF6 does not show this CD40-mediated pattern of early modification and degradation. However, the report quoted above (31Takayanagi H. Ogasawara K. Hida S. Chiba T. Murata S. Sato K. Takaoka A. Yokochi T. Oda H. Nakamura K. Taniguchi T. Nature. 2000; 408: 600-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar) demonstrated TRAF6 degradation in osteoclasts over a study period of up to 3 days, so it may be that both TRAF6 association and its ultimate degradation occur much later in the CD40-mediated signaling pathway in B cells. As TRAF6 binds to B cells less tightly than do TRAFs 2 and 3 (33Pullen S.S. Miller H.G. Everdeen D.S. Dang T.T.A. Crute J.J. Kehry M.R. Biochem. 1998; 37: 11836-11845Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), and requires membrane-bound CD154 rather than anti-CD40 mAb to stimulate B cell IL-6 production (32Jalukar S.V. Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 34Baccam M. Bishop G.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3855-3866Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) this is a reasonable possibility. Thus the nature and composition of the CD40-associated signaling complex is likely to change during the course of a CD40-induced signal cascade, and these changes may play an important role in the ability of distinct motifs in the cytoplasmic domain of CD40 to regulate different CD40 effector functions (16Hostager B.S. Hsing Y. Harms D.E. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1047-1053PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hsing Y. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2804-2811PubMed Google Scholar, 34Baccam M. Bishop G.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3855-3866Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This is likely to be the case for other TNF-R family molecules as well. In this context, the rapid triggering and subsequent degradation of some but not all TRAFs may facilitate signaling complex changes allowing for a greater number of effector functions to be regulated by an individual receptor. Additionally, some TRAFs may contribute more to early, and others to sustained, signaling induced by ligation of particular receptors. Thus, while CD40-mediated B cell activation could conceivably occur by bystander, non-cognate interactions with activated T cells, the higher avidity cognate interactions will lead to better and more sustained CD40 signaling (17Bishop G.A. Warren W.D. Berton M.T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1230-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), to which TRAF6 may make a larger contribution. The present report shows that the RING structure of TRAF2 is critical in mediating its degradation. TRAF1 does not directly bind CD40 but can associate with the receptor through heterodimerization with TRAF2 (33Pullen S.S. Miller H.G. Everdeen D.S. Dang T.T.A. Crute J.J. Kehry M.R. Biochem. 1998; 37: 11836-11845Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Thus, TRAF1 could also be recruited to membrane microdomains following CD40 engagement. We have confirmed that this occurs, but no degradation of TRAF1 is subsequently seen. 3G. A. Bishop, unpublished data. TRAF1 is the only TRAF molecule lacking a RING domain (35Dunn I.F. Geha R.S. Tsitsikov E.N. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which could explain the lack of TRAF1 degradation. Our data thus suggest that both tight association with a receptor as well as the presence of a RING domain are needed for self-initiated TRAF degradation. Future experiments will further probe how receptor engagement triggers TRAF degradation. Our previous work comparing the signaling activities of CD40 and LMP1 as well as current work indicating enhanced and sustained CD40-mediated JNK activity in proteasome-inhibited cells suggests that this degradation could have major implications for receptor activity. It should prove of great interest to determine which other TNF family members regulate their signaling in a similar manner, as many may be regulated by TRAF degradation as well (10Duckett C.S. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2810-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 36Chan F.K. Lenardo M.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 652-660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Exploitation of this mode of regulation in these signaling pathways may ultimately prove advantageous in modifying immune responses."

Barrier heights for these reactions indicate that steric effects in the gas phase are diminished relative to apparent steric effects in solution. We attribute the increased barrier in solution to a solvation effect. Monte Carlo simulations done using statistical perturbation theory confirm that steric hindrance to solvation contributes to S N 2 barriers in solution.

Tyrosine residues 14 and 22 in the N terminus of CX3CR1 were mutated to phenylalanine and stably expressed on K562 cells. Cells expressing CX3CR1-Y14F were competent in signal transduction but defective in capture by and firm adhesion to immobilized fractalkine under physiologic flow conditions.

CX3CR1-expressing cell membranes treated with arylsulfatase to desulfate tyrosine residues also showed a 100-fold decreased affinity for fractalkine. Finally, synthesized, sulfated N-terminal CX3CR1 peptides immobilized on biosensor chips showed a higher affinity for fractalkine than non-sulfated peptides.

Partly validating the hypothesis that FKN and CX3CR1 utilize many of the same molecular mechanisms as endothelial cell selectins (E- and P-selectin) and their ligands to capture circulating leukocytes, studies have shown that the FKN mucin domain is structurally and functionally similar to the short consensus repeats of E- and P-selectin (10Fong A.M.

The FKN mucin domain functions as a stalk to extend and present the CX3C chemokine domain away from the endothelial cell surface, and it can be functionally replaced by the short consensus repeats of E-selectin (10Fong A.M.

Imai T. Patel D.D. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1413-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). EA.hy 926 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% bovine calf serum. Resting human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from whole blood using lymphocyte separation medium (Organon Teknika, Durham, NC). cDNA constructs encoding for CX3CR1 containing tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations were generated by polymerase chain reaction. The following 5′-oligonucleotide primers were used to introduce point mutations: V28 wild type (YY), GAT CAA GCT TCA CCA TGG ATC AGT TCC CTG AAT CA; Y14F (FY), GAT CAA GCT TCA CCA TGG ATC AGT TCC CTG AAT CAG TGA CAG AAA ACT TTG AGT TCG AT; Y22F (YF), GAT CAA GCT TCA CCA TGG ATC AGT TCC CTG AAT CAG TGA CAG AAA ACT TTG AGT ACG ATG ATT TGG CTG AGG CCT GTT TTA TTG; and Y14F/Y22F (FF), GAT CAA GCT TCA CCA TGG ATC AGT TCC CTG AAT CAG TGA CAG AAA ACT TTG AGT TCG ATG ATT TGG CTG AGG CCT GTT TTA TTG. The underlined nucleotides represent the codon that was changed to phenylalanine. The sequence of the resulting amplified DNA products was verified, and the products were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pEGFP (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, Ca) and transfected into K562 cells by electroporation (Gene Pulser II, Bio-Rad) using conditions previously described (3Fong A.M. Robinson L.A. Steeber D.A. Tedder T.F. Yoshie O. Imai T. Patel D.D. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1413-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Stable transfectants were selected in 500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) and sorted (FACStar, BD PharMingen) for equal surface expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and verified by flow cytometry using our anti-CX3CR1 monoclonal antibody 2A9 and a phycoerythrin-labeled secondary antibody (Sigma). Experiments to determine the interaction between FKN and various forms of CX3CR1 were carried out as previously described (3Fong A.M. Robinson L.A. Steeber D.A. Tedder T.F. Yoshie O. Imai T. Patel D.D. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1413-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar) and recorded onto videotape. Briefly, SEAP fusion proteins were immobilized on coverslips using 10 μg/ml of the anti-SEAP antibody 8B6 (Sigma). Either K562, wild type CX3CR1-GFP-transfected cells (K562-YY), or tyrosine mutants (single mutants Y14F (FY), Y22F (YF), or the double mutant Y14F/Y22F (FF)) were resuspended in flow buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.75 mmCaCl2, 0.75 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin) at a concentration of 1 × 106cells/ml. The cells were loaded and allowed to interact with the substrate in the flow chamber at a shear stress of 0.25 dynes/cm2 for 5 min. The shear stresses were adjusted using a Harvard model 44 syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, South Natick, MA). Following 1-min washes at 0.5, 1, 1.85, and 5 dynes/cm2, the cells remaining firmly attached to the coverslip after 5 min at 10 dynes/cm2 were counted. In studies using FKN-transfected EA.hy 926 cells as the target for binding, the adherent cells were plated onto the glass coverslip within a 6-well cluster dish the day before the experiment and allowed to grow to confluency. All results were recorded and analyzed as previously described. Signaling through CX3CR1 was determined by measuring intracellular calcium fluxes as previously described (19Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. DuBose R.A. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24557-24563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 3 × 106 cells were loaded with 200 μg/ml pluronic acid and 1 μm indo-1 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min at 37 °C. Loaded cells were stimulated with various concentrations of recombinant human FKN (R&D, Minneapolis, MN), and intracellular calcium levels were detected using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The Kd values for fractalkine binding to the tyrosine mutant CX3CR1 proteins were determined using a procedure previously described (5Imai T. Hieshima K. Haskell C. Baba M. Nagira M. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Takagi S. Nomiyama H. Schall T.J. Yoshie O. Cell. 1997; 91: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 106 cells were incubated with 2-fold dilutions of FKN-SEAP for 30 min in binding buffer (RPMI containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.02% sodium azide). Following three washes in binding buffer, the cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris, pH 8, containing 1% Triton X-100 and heated at 65 °C for 10 min. Alkaline phosphatase activity was measured colorimetrically using o- nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma). All points were done in triplicate and the results were analyzed using the GraphPad Prism software program (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Surface plasmon resonance measurements were performed on a BIAcore 3000 instrument (BIAcore, Inc., Uppsala, Sweden). N-terminal peptides corresponding to positions 1–20 of CX3CR1 (NH2-MDQFPESVTENFEYDDLAEA-COOH) were synthesized by Synpep (Dublin, CA). The peptides were either unmodified or were sulfated with a SO3H2 group added to the tyrosine residue. These peptides were covalently coupled to a CM5 sensor chip (300–500 resonance units) in 1 mborate buffer, pH 8.5. Binding was monitored on a BIAcore 3000 at 25 °C, and phosphate-buffered saline (with 0.005% surfactant P20) was used as the flow buffer. After each immobilization, sufficient time was allowed to generate a stable ligand immobilized surface with no base-line drift. Membrane vesicle preparations from K562 cells expressing CX3CR1 or the tyrosine mutants were captured on a L1 sensor chip (BIAcore, Inc.), which allows capture of bi-layer membrane vesicles. Membrane preparations were made by freeze thawing 1 × 107 cells in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.01 mg/ml aprotinin) followed by ultracentrifugation at 200,000 × g for 90 min. The L1 surface was first primed with a short injection of octyl glucoside (40 mm, 20 μl at 40 μl/min), and then membrane preparations were injected at 3 μl/min for 10 min. Finally, a short injection (10 μl at 100 μl/min) of 10 mm NaOH was allowed to remove nonspecifically adsorbed membranes and to provide a stable surface of membrane vesicles. A similar membrane preparation from K562 cells served as a control. Equivalent response units of membranes (200–300 resonance units) were captured for each cell type. Prior to each cycle of capture, the membrane preparation was briefly sonicated to provide particles of uniform size. In some cases, membrane preparations were treated with 1 unit of arylsulfatase overnight at 37 °C (Sigma) as described previously (14Wilkins P.P. Moore K.L. McEver R.P. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22677-22680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). FKN-SEAP was then injected at a flow rate of 5–20 μl/min. Rate constant measurements and curve fitting analyses were performed using the BIAevaluation 3.0 (BIAcore, Inc.) software. CX3CR1 contains four tyrosine residues on its extracellular face at positions 14 and 22 in the N terminus, 179 in the second extracellular loop, and 259 in the third extracellular loop. To function in leukocyte capture, it was hypothesized that the interacting residues would need to be extended away from the cell surface (10Fong A.M. Erickson H.P. Zachariah J.P. Poon S. Schamberg N.J. Imai T. Patel D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3781-3786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The largest possibility for extension was in the N-terminal region of the receptor; thus Tyr-14 and Tyr-22 were targeted for mutation. Vectors encoding wild type CX3CR1 (YY) and both single (Y14F, FY; and Y22F, YF) and double (Y14F/Y22F, FF) tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations fused with GFP were generated (Fig. 1 A). The mutation to phenylalanine is conservative, and phenylalanine is not subject to sulfation. Stable K562 cell transfectants expressing equivalent levels of GFP were sorted by flow cytometry. All four GFP fusion proteins were expressed at equivalent levels on the cell surface as determined by confocal microscopy (data not shown) and flow cytometry using a CX3CR1-specific monoclonal antibody (Fig. 1 B). The kinetics of CX3CR1 and CX3CR1 mutant binding to fractalkine was tested by two different techniques. First, static binding experiments were performed with FKN-SEAP. Using the static binding assay, the measured Kd of YY to FKN-SEAP was 49 pm as compared with 56 pm for YF, 106 pm for FY, and 191 pm for FF cells. The kinetics of FKN binding to CX3CR1 were also determined by surface plasmon resonance. Membranes from K562 cells expressing CX3CR1 or the various mutants were prepared and immobilized onto an L1 biosensor chip. FKN-SEAP fusion proteins bound well to K562 cell membranes containing CX3CR1 but not to membranes from untransfected K562 cells when background binding to biosensor surfaces lacking membrane is subtracted (Fig. 2 A). Fig. 2 B shows that FKN bound equally well to wild type CX3CR1 and YF cells and bound less well to cells with CX3CR1 proteins mutated at position 14 (FY and FF). The calculated affinity constants revealed an about 150-fold difference in FKN binding to YY versus FY (YY, 45 nm; YF, 64 nm; FY, 6.6 μm; FF, 3.5 μm) as determined using the Langmuir equation and global curve fitting analysis (BIAevaluation). There was an ∼20-fold decrease in both the on and off rates for Phe-14 compared with Tyr-14 (on rates of 5.8 × 103, 5.6 × 103, 0.28 × 103, and 0.37 × 103/ms; and off rates of 2.6 × 10−4, 3.6 × 10−4, 0.18 × 10−4, and 0.13 × 10−4/s for YY, YF, FY, and FF, respectively), indicating a global decrease in FKN binding when Tyr-14 is mutated to Phe-14. These data suggest that CX3CR1 tyrosine 14 is an important binding site for FKN. Phenylalanine is similar to tyrosine except for the fact that it cannot be post-translationally modified by sulfation or phosphorylation. To test the hypothesis that sulfation of Tyr-14 is important, numerous immunoprecipitation studies using our and other commercially available polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies directed against CX3CR1 or the GFP fusion partner were attempted but were unsuccessful. CX3CR1 may be tightly complexed with other proteins in the membrane, cytosol, or lipid rafts such that its isolation by immunoprecipitation is difficult. To ascertain the importance of sulfation for binding, two approaches were taken. First, YY membranes were treated with arylsulfatase to cleave off the sulfate residues and tested for binding to FKN by surface plasmon resonance. Active arylsulfatase also caused an approximate 150-fold decrease in Kd (1.9 versus 290 nm) similar to the difference between YY and FY using the same assay (Fig. 3 A). Second, peptides encoding the N-terminal 20 amino acids of CX3CR1 that contained either a non-sulfated Tyr-14 (CX3CR1 1–20 Y14-OH) or a sulfated Tyr-14 (CX3CR1 1–20 Y14-SO4) were immobilized on a CM5 biosensor chip and tested for their ability to bind to FKN-SEAP by surface plasmon resonance. FKN bound to the sulfated peptide with an approximate 10-fold greater affinity as compared with the non-sulfated peptide (Kd = 0.79 versus 6.6 nm) (Fig. 3 B). These data suggest that CX3CR1 is sulfated and that the sulfation enhances the ability of CX3CR1 to bind FKN under flow conditions. The above data suggest that Tyr-14 is a critical residue for CX3CR1-FKN interactions under flow conditions, but it may not be as critical for interactions under static conditions. To address this possibility, we tested the function of cells expressing wild type and mutant CX3CR1 molecules in cell capture and adhesion under flow and in calcium mobilization assays. To examine cell capture and adhesion under flow conditions, the ability of YY, YF, FY, FF, and K562 control cells to bind and firmly adhere to immobilized FKN-SEAP fusion proteins under shear stress were tested in the parallel plate flow chamber assay. Cells were allowed to capture on FKN-SEAP or SEAP control protein-coated glass coverslips at 0.25 dynes/cm2 for 5 min. The cells that were able to transiently interact with the fractalkine substrate for at least 5 s were categorized as captured cells. We observed that FY and FF cells containing a tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation at position 14 were ineffective at being captured by fractalkine (data not shown). After the initial loading period, the cells were subjected to increasing shear stresses, and the number of cells remaining adherent after 10 dynes/cm2 were quantified. Fig. 4 shows in a representative experiment that wild type YY cells bound to FKN at significantly higher levels than K562 control cells (p < 0.05). In contrast, the FF clone in which both tyrosines 14 and 22 were changed to phenylalanine bound to FKN at the same level as K562 cells (p = not significant, n = 3) and was only 10% of the level of YY cells. Analysis of the single mutants revealed that Tyr-14 was a critical residue for CX3CR1-expressing cell adhesion to FKN as FY bound at only 10% of the level of YY whereas YF bound 95% as well as YY (p = not significant and <0.05, respectively, compared with K562 cells, n = 3). Similar results were observed in flow chamber experiments using FKN-transfected EA.hy 926 cells as the substrate (data not shown). To assess the roles of CX3CR1 Tyr-14 and Tyr-22 in signal transduction, the ability of soluble FKN-SEAP to induce calcium mobilizations in YY, YF, FY, FF, and K562 cells was tested. All four CX3CR1 types mobilized calcium in response to soluble FKN-SEAP (Fig. 5). There was a slight rightward shift in the dose-response curve for FF>FY>YF>YY (EC50 = 0.4 ± 0.2, 0.6 ± 0.3, 1.0 ± 0.2, and 2.2 ± 0.8 nm for YY, YF, FY, and FF, respectively) with no significant differences (p > 0.05) among Tyr-14-containing proteins (YY and YF) and Phe-14-containing proteins (FY and FF). Although the 2.5-fold difference in EC50 between YY and FY was statistically significant (p < 0.05), the physiologic relevance is unclear. It could be that Tyr-14 is necessary for optimal interactions of membrane-tethered FKN under conditions of flow but not under static conditions (similar to L-selectin). CX3CR1 is a unique chemokine receptor in that it has a dual function in signal transduction and cell adhesion. Because no other GPCR has been identified as a cell adhesion molecule, little is known about the mechanisms by which this or other GPCRs may function in this capacity. Based on our original hypothesis that the FKN-CX3CR1 interaction may share the same mechanisms as selectin-selectin ligand interactions (10Fong A.M. Erickson H.P. Zachariah J.P. Poon S. Schamberg N.J. Imai T. Patel D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3781-3786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we tested whether N-terminal tyrosine residues in CX3CR1 were involved in CX3CR1-FKN interactions and whether sulfation of these residues affected adhesion. Our study showed that a conservative mutation in CX3CR1-Y14 to phenylalanine had numerous functional effects (Table I). First, it did not abolish soluble FKN binding to CX3CR1, but it did decrease the affinity as measured by two different assays. Second, signaling through CX3CR1-FY was intact, but ∼2.5-fold higher concentrations of FKN were needed to produce similar responses. Third, Y14F nearly abolished all cell adhesion activity to immobilized FKN. In most assays, mutating Tyr-22 had little effect on FKN binding or CX3CR1 function. However, the slight but statistically insignificant decrease in cell adhesion and G-dependent signaling in YF cells may suggest a small role for Tyr-22 in FKN-CX3CR1 interactions. An important consideration for any mutation is whether it induces structural changes that render the protein inactive. Two lines of evidence argue against major structural changes being induced by mutating Tyr-14 and/or Tyr-22 to F; soluble FKN was able to bind and transduce signals in YY, FY, YF, and FF cells, and monoclonal antibody 2A9 directed to the N terminus of CX3CR1 was able to bind well to both wild type and mutated CX3CR1 proteins.Table ISummary of ligand binding and function of wild type and mutant CX3 CR1Binding affinity (Kd)1-aReported are the binding affinities of FKN-SEAP to membrane-bound CX3CR1 proteins as measured by surface plasmon resonance.On rate (ka, 1/ms)1-aReported are the binding affinities of FKN-SEAP to membrane-bound CX3CR1 proteins as measured by surface plasmon resonance.Off rate (kd, 1/s)1-aReported are the binding affinities of FKN-SEAP to membrane-bound CX3CR1 proteins as measured by surface plasmon resonance.Ca2+mobilization (EC50)Cell adhesion (% max)nmnmYY455.8 × 1032.6 × 10−40.4100YF645.6 × 1033.6 × 10−40.695FY66000.28 × 1030.18 × 10−41.010FF35000.37 × 1030.13 × 10−42.2101-a Reported are the binding affinities of FKN-SEAP to membrane-bound CX3CR1 proteins as measured by surface plasmon resonance.

Recently, CCR2 and CCR5 have been shown to undergo tyrosine sulfation, and this tyrosine sulfation is functionally relevant (18Farzan M. Mirzabekov T. Kolchinsky P. Wyatt R. Cayabyab M. Gerard N.P.

Unlike the present study, mutations in N-terminal tyrosine residues caused a loss in binding to their natural ligands. CCR2B mutants failed to form lamellipodium and migrate whereas CCR5 mutants were unable to bind to HIV gp120 (18Farzan M. Mirzabekov T. Kolchinsky P. Wyatt R. Cayabyab M. Gerard N.P. Gerard C.

Although these other chemokine receptors have been shown to contain sulfated tyrosine residues, CX3CR1 could not be directly evaluated in this study by immunoprecipitation because of technical reasons related to the receptor and reagents available. However, CX3CR1 does contain an important feature for tyrosine sulfation with an acidic residue (glutamic acid) located directly before Tyr-14. The parameters that determine tyrosine sulfation are not entirely understood, but features that enhances tyrosine sulfation are the presence of acidic residues within 3 bases upstream of the tyrosine residue, a neutral or acidic residue at −1, and the lack of a basic residue at −1 (24Bundgaard J.R. Vuust J. Rehfeld J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21700-21705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Further, an indirect method wherein arylsulfatase (used to desulfate tyrosine residues) reduced the affinity of FKN binding to the level of the mutated YF protein suggests that the endogenous CX3CR1 is sulfated. The importance of Tyr-14 sulfation to FKN binding was demonstrated by the increased affinity of sulfated compared with non-sulfated CX3CR1 N-terminal peptide binding to FKN. Thus, Tyr-14 sulfation is important for adhesion to fractalkine under physiologic flow conditions. On the other hand, signaling through CX3CR1 is not greatly affected. These results are different from the ones published for CCR2. In this case, mutation of the tyrosine residue at the N terminus which is sulfated (position 26) to phenylalanine caused a total loss in signaling as measured by calcium mobilization (21Preobrazhensky A.A. Dragan S. Kawano T. Gavrilin M.A. Gulina I.V. Chakravarty L. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5295-5303Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We and others have previously demonstrated that signaling through the G protein is not necessary for cell adhesion (3Fong A.M. Robinson L.A. Steeber D.A. Tedder T.F. Yoshie O. Imai T. Patel D.D. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1413-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 4Haskell C.A. Cleary M.D. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10053-10058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). CX3CR1 couples exclusively to Gαi subunits, and poisoning this G protein by pertussis toxin had no effect on cell adhesion (3Fong A.M. Robinson L.A. Steeber D.A. Tedder T.F. Yoshie O. Imai T. Patel D.D. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1413-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). In addition, mutation of the G protein docking site in CX3CR1 abolished G-dependent signaling but had no effect on cell adhesion (4Haskell C.A. Cleary M.D. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10053-10058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for the lack of a large effect on signal transduction while the adhesion defect is dramatic could be that the calcium fluxes are measured using soluble fractalkine added under static conditions. In contrast, our adhesion experiments used immobilized surface-bound fractalkine under dynamic conditions. Indeed we see a rightward shift in the calcium flux dose-response curves, indicating that the signaling through the mutant receptors is suboptimal. The results of the binding experiments, both static and Biacore analysis, suggest that the mutant CX3CR1 containing the phenylalanine at position 14 can bind to fractalkine, though not as well as those containing the native tyrosine residue. Therefore, tyrosine 14 and its sulfation may be most important for the initial capture of CX3CR1-expressing cells to fractalkine under physiological flow conditions and less important for other potential downstream functions. It is interesting to note that the difference in Kd values between wild type and tyrosine 14 mutants of CX3CR1 obtained for the Biacore analysis is greater (150-fold) than those calculated for the static binding experiments. Biacore measurements are taken using membranes lacking any cytosolic components whereas the static binding experiments are performed on whole cells. It is possible that some of these components may alter or affect the Kd. It has previously been shown that measurements of T cell receptor affinity using live cellular assays were substantially higher than those measured in cell-free systems (25Sykulev Y. Vugmeyster Y. Brunmark A. Ploegh H.L. Eisen H.N. Immunity. 1998; 9: 475-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Biacore Kd values are calculated using on and off rates (apparent Kd) and thus may not reflect the true physiological equilibrium. Consistent with other heptahelical receptors, CX3CR1 may bind using the two-site model of ligand association in which the tyrosine-sulfated N terminus mediates the initial docking interaction with fractalkine (20Farzan M. Schnitzler C.E. Vasilieva N. Leung D. Kuhn J. Gerard C. Gerard N.P. Choe H. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Fractalkine-CX3CR1 interactions are important in a number of systems and may play a role in various disease states. In the brain, fractalkine expressed on neurons can mediate the activation and migration of CX3CR1-expressing microglial cells (26Harrison J.K. Jiang Y. Chen S. Xia Y. Maciejewski D. McNamara R.K. Streit W.J. Salafranca M.N. Adhikari S. Thompson D.A. Botti P. Bacon K.B. Feng L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Fractalkine-CX3CR1 interactions are believed to be involved in NK cell-mediated cytolysis (6Yoneda O. Imai T. Goda S. Inoue H. Yamauchi A. Okazaki T. Imai H. Yoshie O. Bloom E.T. Domae N. Umehara H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4055-4062Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Kidneys undergoing allograft rejection have elevated levels of FKN, and antibodies against CX3CR1 can protect a cardiac allograft from rejection (8Robinson L.A. Nataraj C. Thomas D.W. Howell D.N.

Furthermore, a mouse deficient in CX3CR1 has been shown to have prolonged cardiac allograft survival (9Haskell C.A. Hancock W.W. Salant D.J. Gao W. Csizmadia V. Peters W. Faia K. Fituri O. Rottman J.B. Charo I.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 679-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The mechanism of this finding appears to be NK cell-mediated, and fractalkine-CX3CR1 interactions may be important for the recruitment of NK cells to the transplanted organ. Finally, CX3CR1 may be a weak co-receptor for HIV (28Combadiere C. Salzwedel K. Smith E.D. Tiffany H.L. Berger E.A. Murphy P.M. J. Biol.

The sulfation status of CX3CR1 under normal and pathological conditions remains to be determined, but it is plausible that the adhesion function of CX3CR1 could be modulated by sulfotransferases. In summary, we have identified that tyrosine residue 14 at the N terminus of CX3CR1 is necessary for FKN-dependent rapid capture and firm adhesion. This negatively charged sulfated residue may form an important contact point for binding to fractalkine. There are many conserved positively charged residues among species, and the crystal structure of the chemokine domain of FKN was recently solved (30Mizoue L.S. Bazan J.F. Johnson E.C. Handel T.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1402-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We have previously published that the CX3C chemokine head contains the important amino acids mediating this cell adhesion (31Harrison J.K. Fong A.M. Swain P.A. Chen S. Yu Y.R. Salafranca M.N. Greenleaf W.B. Imai T. Patel D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21632-21641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We have made mutations to some of the conserved basic residues and have identified Lys-7 and Arg-47 as potentially important contact points for CX3CR1 function in cell adhesion (31Harrison J.K. Fong A.M. Swain P.A. Chen S. Yu Y.R. Salafranca M.N. Greenleaf W.B. Imai T. Patel D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21632-21641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It is possible that these amino acids may interact with sulfated tyrosine 14. Because tyrosine sulfation is essential for cell capture under dynamic conditions by two families of molecules, chemokines and selectins, this post-translational modification may be considered a global mechanism to increase the types of adhesive interactions that lead to the capture of circulating inflammatory cells."

STAT1 activation leads to changes in expression of key regulatory genes encoding caspases and cell cycle inhibitors. Deficient STAT1 expression in human cancer cells and virally mediated inhibition of STAT1 function have been associated with cellular resistance to IFNs and mycobacterial infection in humans. Thus, given the relative importance of STAT1, we isolated and characterized a human STAT1 intronic enhancer region displaying IFN-regulated activity. Functional analyses by transient expression identified a repressor region and type I and II IFN-inducible elements within the STAT1 enhancer sequence. A candidate IRF-E/GAS/IRF-E (IGI) sequence containing GAAANN nucleotide repeats was shown by gel shift assay to bind to IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), but not to IFN-stimulated gene factor-3 (ISGF-3) or STAT1–3. An additional larger IGI-binding complex containing IRF-1 was identified. Mutation of the GAAANN repeats within the IGI DNA element eliminated IRF-1 binding and the IFN-regulated activity of the STAT1 intronic enhancer region. Transfection of the IFN-resistant MM96 cell line to express increased levels of IRF-1 protein also elevated STAT1, STAT2, and p48/IRF-9 expression and enhanced cellular responsiveness to IFN-β.

STAT1 has also been shown to be the target of viral proteins inhibiting IFN signaling responses (12Look D.C Roswit W.T. Frick A.G. Gris-Alevy Y. Dickhaus D.M. Walter M.J. Holtzman M.J. Immunity. 1998; 9: 871-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In addition, STAT1 expression in tumor cells has been shown to be important for tumor elimination by immune surveillance mechanisms (13Kaplan D.H. Shankaran V. Dighe A.S. Stockert E. Aguet M. Old L.J. Schreiber R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7556-7561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar) as well as for mycobacterial immunity in humans (14Dupuis S. Dargemont C. Fieschi C. Thomassin N. Rosenzweig S. Harris J. Holland S.M. Schreiber R.D. Casanova J.L. Science. 2001; 293: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). STAT1 is an integral component in a range of different transcription factor complexes. For example, the two most commonly identified are GAF and ISGF3, involved in the signal transduction pathways of type I and II IFNs, respectively (reviewed in Refs. 1Stark G.R Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar and 15Decker T. Kovarik P. Meinke A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1997; 17: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The GAF DNA-binding sequence (GAS) exhibits dyad symmetry across two half-sites, consistent with the binding of STAT1 proteins as a homodimer. Related GAS elements with between 2 and 4 intervening nucleotides bind transcription factors that are activated not only by IFNs, but also by numerous other cytokines and growth factors. Thus, GAS elements are capable of binding homo- and heterodimers of the STAT proteins STAT1, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5, and STAT6. A heterodimer of STAT1 and STAT2 can bind weakly to the GAS element, resulting in transactivation (16Li X. Leung S. Burns C. Stark G.R. Biochimie (Paris). 1998; 80: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). signal transducer and activator of transcription Janus kinase interferon interferon-stimulated gene factor IFN-γ activation factor GAF DNA-binding sequence interferon regulatory factor IFN regulatory factor-element IFN consensus sequence binding protein interferon-stimulated response element interferon-stimulated gene yeast artificial chromosome cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends IGI, IRF-E/GAS/IRF-E electrophoretic mobility shift assay glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase group of overlapping clones tumor necrosis factor ISGF3 is recognized as the major multisubunit transcription factor activated in response to type I IFNs. ISGF3 comprises two components, ISGF3γ or IRF-9, a single 48-kDa DNA-binding protein, and ISGF3α, which consists of the STAT1α (91 kDa) or STAT1β (84 kDa) protein in a heterodimeric complex with STAT2 (113 kDa). Treatment of cells with IFNs can also result in association of homodimers of STAT1 or STAT2 in ISGF3. Complexes of STAT2 homodimers with IRF-9 may form, but have only weak DNA binding and weak transactivating potential. Type II IFN stimulation can result in formation of ISGF3 as a STAT1 homodimer·IRF-9 complex (17Bluyssen H.A. Levy D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4600-4605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus, a number of different STAT1 complexes have been identified to date. Once formed, the ISGF3 complexes translocate to the nucleus and bind to the ISRE to activate ISG expression. The ISRE sequence is orientation-independent and contains direct repeats of either 5′-TTTC-3′ (for example, see Ref. 18de Veer M.J. Sim H. Whisstock J.C. Devenish R.J. Ralph S.J. Genomics. 1998; 54: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) or, more commonly, the complement 5′-GAAA-3′, and the repeats are usually separated by a spacing of 1–2 nucleotides (reviewed in Ref. 19Haque S.J. Williams B.R.G. Semin. Oncol. 1998; 25: 14-22PubMed Google Scholar). The ISG15 ISRE with sequence 5′-CTCGGGAAAGGG AAACCGAAA CTGAAGCC-3′ binds to two different IFN-inducible transcription factors and has been studied extensively. Not only is the core sequence (the nonamer underlined in boldface) of the ISRE targeted by the trimeric ISGF3 complexes via IRF-9, but it also binds to IRF-9 alone or to other members of the IRF family related to IRF-9 such as IRF-1, IRF-2, IRF-3, IRF-7, and ICSBP. Phosphorylated STAT1-STAT2 heterodimers or homodimers of either are unable to bind to ISRE sequences, but can bind to GAS elements. IRF-9 directs binding of ISGF3 to the core ISRE, and STAT1 stabilizes the interaction with DNA by recognizing and binding to STAT1 GA(A/T)TC half-sites flanking the core ISRE sequence (17Bluyssen H.A. Levy D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4600-4605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Here we report the mapping of the human STAT1 gene from the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain human YAC library using a PCR-based screening approach, isolation and characterization of the 5′-genomic region, and identification of a 5′-transcriptional start site. Putative DNA-binding sites for transcription factors were identified within the intron 1/exon 2 boundary sequence. Transient expression assays with luciferase reporter constructs and gel mobility shift assays confirmed the presence of an unusual ISRE (IRF-E/GAS/IRF-E) binding a high molecular mass IRF-1 complex that included CBP and was induced by stimulation with either type I or II IFN. Interestingly, we have not found any binding of ISGF3 components to this ISRE. We propose that the IRF-1 and STAT1 genes and their proteins form an intracellular amplifier circuit regulating cellular responsiveness to the IFNs. Melanoma cell line SK-MEL-28 (American type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) was grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% inactivated fetal calf serum. Human MCF-7 breast cancer and U293T embryonic kidney cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% inactivated fetal calf serum. In all experiments, cells were stimulated with either 1000 IU/ml IFN-α2a or 1000 IU/ml IFN-γ (Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland) for the indicated time periods. For IFN-γ priming, cells were pretreated with 1000 IU/ml IFN-γ for 16 h prior to stimulation with IFN-α2. Antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) and included anti-STAT1 supershift (sc-464x), anti-p48/ISGF3γ supershift (sc-496x), anti-IRF-1 (sc-497), and anti-IRF-2 (sc-498). Anti-IRF-3 antibody was a gift from Dr. Ricky Johnstone (Austin Research Institute, Heidelberg, Victoria, Australia). YAC clones neighboring D2S118 or AFM066xc1 sequence tagged sites (STS), including 737c9, 755b5, 764F5, 805c1, 809e2, 820b12, 821e5, 855g4, 855h9, 984a5, 894a6, and 894a11, were obtained from Dr. Simon Foote (Walter and Eliza Hall Institute for Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria). A single colony of each YAC strain was expanded by growth in 10-ml cultures as described (20Markie D. Methods in Molecular Biology: YAC Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1996: 65-68Google Scholar), and the DNA was purified as described, washed with 80% ethanol before it was dried, and resuspended in 50 μl of MilliQ water. For rapid preparation of yeast for analysis by PCR, a yeast colony (0.5–2 mm) taken from a plate was lysed by addition of 2–10 μl of incubation solution (100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) and 1.2m sorbitol) containing zymolyase 20T (2.5 mg/1 ml of incubation solution) and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The digested product was ready to be used in the PCR or was stored at −20 °C for future use. The primers used were as follows: STAT1 yac3′a (18-mer), 5′-CATCTTCTCTGGCGACAG-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 2432–2449 of STAT1 cDNA sequence (GenBankTM/EBI accession number M97935); and STAT1 yac3′b (20-mer), 5′-CAGTAAGATGCATGATGCCC-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 2599–2618 of STAT1 cDNA sequence. The procedures for bubble PCR were as described previously (21Munroe D.J. Haas M. Bric E. Whitton T. Aburatani H. Hunter K. Ward D. Housman D.E. Genomics. 1994; 19: 506-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and formed the basis for the methods used here. The oligonucleotide sequences used for the construction of bubble anchors/vectorettes were as follows: BubbleVec Top primer (55-mer), 5′-GCTCTCCCTTCTGCGGCCGCAGTTCGTCAACATAGCATTTCTGTCCTCTCCTTCG-3′; and BubbleVec Bottom primer (60-mer), 5′-AATTCGAAGGAGAGGACGCTGTCTGTCGAAGGTAAACGGACGAGAGAAGGGAGAGCTGCA-3′. Bubble anchors were annealed and ligated to EcoRI- and PstI-digested DNA from either the 805c1 or 809e2 YAC clone via the overhanging ends of the anchors/vectorettes. Prior to PCR, ligated products were extracted from excess bubble anchors/vectorettes by passage through a QIAQuick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN Inc.) as outlined by the manufacturer. The final products were used as templates for bubble PCR with the “hot start” procedure and platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) in a total volume of 50 μl, consisting of 5 ng of anchored DNA template and 1 μmprimers. One of the primers used was either BubbleprimerIntE or BubbleprimerIntP (described below), which would prime from the anchor/vectorette at the 5′-end of the target DNA; the other primer was based on the nucleotide sequence of the STAT1 cDNA (GenBankTM/EBI accession number M97935). PCR cycling parameters were as follows: 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 63 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C for 3 min. The product was gel-purified before cloning into the pGEMT-Easy vector used for DNA sequencing reactions (Big Dye sequencing kit, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The primers used were as follows: BubbleprimerIntE (30-mer), 5′-GCGGCCGCAGTTCGTCAACATAGCATTTCT-3′; BubbleprimerIntP (27-mer), 5′-GCTGTCTGTCGAAGGTAAACGGACGAG-3′. In addition, three primers were prepared as complementary sequences corresponding to the indicated regions from the STAT1 cDNA sequence (GenBankTM/EBI accession number M97935) as follows: STAT1 prom primer (30 mer), 5′-G GAATTC CGCTGCTGAAGTTCGTACCACTG-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 203–224; STAT1 upstream primer, 5′-CTTTCCGGCGCAGAGTCTGC-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 26–46; and STAT1 upRev primer, 5′-CTGCGGAGGGGCTCGGCGAG-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 10–29. Messenger RNA was isolated from SK-MEL-28 cells treated with IFN-γ (1000 IU/ml, incubated for 16 h) using the FastTrack 2.0 mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen). To obtain the full-length 5′-end of the human STAT1 cDNA, full-length RLM-RACE was performed using the GeneRacer kit (Invitrogen) according to the protocols recommended by the manufacturer. The GeneRacer kit ensures that only full-length transcripts are amplified by prior elimination of truncated transcripts. The STAT1 gene-specific primer (STAT1 prom) was used to synthesize the first-strand cDNA template. Amplified fragments resulting from RLM-RACE were cloned into pCR4Blunt-TOPO® (Invitrogen), and the DNA sequence was determined using the DYEnamic ET terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences). The32P-radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides used included the following: p91-ISREup (5′-GTACCTGCAGCAAATGAAACTTTCTGCGAAAAGAAGAAAACGA-3′) and its complement p91-ISREdown (5′-GATCTCGTTTTCTTCTTTTCGCAGAAACTTTCATTTGCTGCAG-3′); p91-ISREΔgas1 (5′-GTACCTGCAGCAAATGAAACTTTGCTA GCGAAAAGAAGAAAACGA-3′) and its complement p91-ISREΔgas2; IGI mutant 1, p91-ISREmut1 (5′-GTACCTGCAGCAAATCC AACTTTCTGCT AAAAGAATC AAACGA-3′) and its complement p91-ISREmut2; IGI mutant 2, p91-ISREmut3 (5′-GTACCTGCAGCAAATGAAACTTTCTGCT AAAAGAATC AAACGA-3′) and its complement p91-ISREmut4; ISRE-isg15/sense (5′-GATCCTCGGGAAAGGGAAACCGAAACTGAAGCC-3′) and its complement (a gift from Dr. Ricky Johnstone); GAS-gbp (5′-AAGTACTTTCAGTTTCATATTACTCTAAATC-3′) and its complement; and h STAT1900prom3′GAS (TGATTCCATGAACAT), h STAT1900promIRF-E/GAS/IRF-E (CAG CAA ATG AAA CTT TCT GCG AAA AGA AGA AAA CGT), h STAT1900promIGIGAS (GAA ACT TTC TGC GAA AAG), h STAT1 mut5′IRF-E (CAG CGG ATGGG A CTT TCT GCG AAA AGA AGA AAA CGT), h STAT1 mut3′IRF-E (CAG CAA ATG AAA CTT TCT GCG AAC C GA AGC CAA CGT), and IRF-1GAS (CGT CAT TTC CCC GAA ATC AG) and their complements. Cells (∼1 × 107cells) were induced with either IFN-γ or IFN-α2 as described below or in the figure legends. During activation, 10 mm NaF was added with the IFNs before lysis of cells to prevent translocation of ISGF3 to the nucleus (22Levy D.E. Kessler D.S. Pine R. Darnell J.E., Jr. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1362-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 70 μl of HEM buffer (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.135 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mg/ml pepstatin, 0.1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mg/ml aprotinin). Following lysis on ice for 15 min, cell suspensions were spun at >12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were used as total lysates in gel mobility shift assays using end-labeled oligonucleotide probes. SK-MEL-28 and U293T cell lysates (10–20 μg of protein) were added to a reaction mixture containing 20 μg of bovine serum albumin, 4 μg of poly(dI-dC), 5 μl of buffer A (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), 10 μl of buffer B (20% Ficoll 400, 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 300 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and 4 ng of γ-32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe in a final volume of 50 μl. The mixture was incubated for 25 min at room temperature. Recombinant STAT1 was used in gel shift assays at a concentration of 500 ng. Murine wild-type IRF-1 protein was synthesized in vitro using a T7-based coupled transcription/translation kit (Promega, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer's instructions. For MCF-7 cells, a reaction mixture consisting of 180 μl of dialysis buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 0.3 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol), 45 μl of reaction buffer (10 mmNa2HPO4 and 1 mm EDTA), 24 μl of 80 mm MgCl2, and 8.8 μl of poly(dI-dC) (3 μg/μl stock) was prepared. For each gel shift reaction, 9 μl of reaction mixture, ∼5 μg of total protein (in 5 μl), and 1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP-labeled oligonucleotide probe (∼30,000 cpm) were incubated on ice for 20 min and then loaded onto a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. For supershift experiments, either antiserum was added to the reaction mixture after 10 min and the incubation was continued for a further 10 min, or extracts were incubated with 1 μg of each antibody for 20 min before adding the radioactively labeled probe to the reaction, and samples were electrophoresed on a 20-cm 6% polyacrylamide gel at 15 mA in 0.25× Tris borate/EDTA at 4 °C for 10 h. The pGL3-Basic luciferase reporter vector (Promega) encoding a modified firefly luciferase was used to prepare STAT1 intronic enhancer reporter constructs. The primer Rvprimer3 (5′-CTAGCAAAATAGGCTGTCCC-3′) was used for DNA sequencing across the regions cloned into pGL3basic to confirm that the sequences of the constructs were correct. The constructs prepared included the following. 1) The full-length (FL) construct contained the full-length EcoRI fragment of the STAT1900prom region obtained from pGEMT-Easy. 2) The 3′-luc (where luc is luciferase) vector contained the SacI/XhoI 3′-half of the STAT1 intronic enhancer region isolated from pGEMT-Easy (from bp +508 to +1223 relative to the STAT1 transcriptional start site). 3) The 5′-luc vector in which the 5′-half of the STAT1 intronic enhancer (from bp +3 to +498) was derived from the full-length clone by PCR with the p91-ISREup and STAT1 upstream primers, and the product was cloned into pGEMT-Easy, excised with PstI/NotI, ligated into pCR-Script SK+ (Stratagene), re-excised with KpnI/SacI, and cloned into pGL3Luc. 4) The 5′ΔIGI-luc construct was made by inserting a PCR-derived fragment of the 5′-luc construct between the KpnI and SacI sites of pGL3basic. The PCR primers used were as follows: forward primer, GAC GGT ACC GCA CGA CTG GCA AGG ACA ATC; and reverse primer, GCA CTC GAG GAA TTC GAT TCT TTC CGG CGC. 5) For IGI-luc, p91-ISREup and its complement p91-ISREdown were annealed at 50 °C and cooled down slowly to room temperature to allow double-stranded annealing before cloning into KpnI/BglII-cut pGL3Luc. The sequence of the IGI-luc construct was confirmed using the forward primer. Mutation of the GAAANN sites within the IGI element of the pGL3-FL construct was carried out using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as described by manufacturer. Briefly, the pGL3-STAT1 prom FL construct was subjected to PCR with primers h STAT mut/sense (5′-CCATCAGTCACGTTTGA TTCTTTTA GCAGAAAGTTGG ATTTGCTGTATGCC-3′) and h STAT mut/anti (5′-GGCATACAGCAAATCC AACTTTCTGCT AAAAGAATC AAACGTGACTGATGG-3′) for site-directed mutagenesis. After amplification, parental DNA was removed by digestion with DpnI, and the vector DNA containing the mutant IGI element was transformed into rubidium chloride-treated, competent Escherichia coli DH5α cells. The DNA sequences of the mutant clones were verified using the DYEnamic ET terminator cycle sequencing kit. Cells (2 × 105) growing in 35-mm dishes were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA/dish using purified pSV2-βgal (Promega) and/or pGL3basic, 5′-luc, IGI-luc, 3′-luc, FL-luc, 5′ΔIGI-luc, FL-IGImt-luc, or pEF-luc DNA. Either FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) or Transfast reagent (Promega) was used according to the manufacturers' protocols. At 30–36 h after transfection, cells were either left untreated or stimulated with 1000 IU/ml IFN-γ or IFN-α2 and incubated for 8–24 h before harvesting, and extracts were prepared for luciferase and β-galactosidase assays using standard protocols (Promega). Light units were measured in a Top Count microplate scintillation counter (Canberra Packard), recording four readings over 2 min and averaging these to measure light units/min. Each transfection assay was performed in triplicate and repeated two to three times; the values (light units/min) were averaged; and S.E. values were calculated. Total RNA was prepared using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For Northern blotting, 20 μg of total RNA was separated on 1.5% formaldehyde gels and transferred to Hybond Plus membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The STAT1 probe for Northern blotting was prepared by PCR using the mouse Stat1 cDNA as a template. The primers used to obtain the 177-bp fragment were as follows: forward primer, CCGATG GAG CTT GAC GAC CCT AAG CGA AC; and reverse primer, CTG TGC TCA TCA TAC TGT CAA ATT CGG CC. The STAT1 probe was labeled with [α-32P] dCTP and hybridized to the membrane-bound RNA overnight at 65 °C in Church's buffer (0.158m NaH2PO4, 0.342 mNa2HPO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 7% SDS). Following stringent washing, membranes were exposed to film or PhosphorImager screens. Transfers were stripped and reprobed with the GAPDH probe (pTRI-GAPDH, Ambion Inc.) to assay for GAPDH expression. Streptavidin-agarose beads (NeutrAvidinTM-agarose, Pierce) were saturated with 5′-biotinylated IGI oligonucleotides at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were then washed with HEM buffer and incubated with extracts from untreated or IFN-γ-treated MCF-7 cells at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed five times with HEM buffer, resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Extracts from MCF-7 cells were quantitated, and 20 μg of each sample was separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and analyzed by Western blotting with either anti-CBP or anti-IRF-1 antibody as indicated. The entire coding region of STAT1 was amplified by PCR using STAT1-pBluescript II SK− (kindly provided by Dr. Chris Schindler) as a template plasmid. The primers used were as follows: STAT1 5′-primer, 5′-AAGGAAAAAAGCGGCCGCCACCATGGCTCAGTGGTACGAACTTCAGCAGC-3′; and STAT1 3′-primer, 5′-CGCGGATCCCTATACTGTGTTCATCATACTGTCG-3′. The PCR fragment was subsequently cloned into the passaging vector pCR-Script. Subsequently, the STAT1 fragment was excised by digestion with NotI and ClaI and subcloned into the pEFMCIneopAS6 expression vector (23Visvader J.E. Elefanty A.G. Strasser A. Adams J.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4557-4564Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The full-length IRF-1 expression vector was generated by PCR using the IRF-1 5′-primer (5′-AAGGAAAAAAGCGGCCGCCACCATGGCCCCATCACTCGGATGCGCATGAGACCC-3′) and the IRF-1 3′-primer (5′-GCTCTAGACTACGGTGCACAGGGAATGGCC-3′) from the IRF-1-pBluescript II SK plasmid as a template (kindly provided by Dr. Richard Pine). The PCR product was cloned into the pEFMCIneopAN9 expression vector (23Visvader J.E. Elefanty A.G. Strasser A. Adams J.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4557-4564Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) via NotI and XbaI restriction enzyme sites introduced by the above primers. The resulting constructs, pEF-STAT1 and pEF-IRF-1, were purified by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation and used to transfect MM96 cells via electroporation. Stable clones were selected by culture in the presence of G418. Antiviral assays were performed as described previously (7Wong L.H. Krauer K.G. Estcourt M.J. Hatzinisiriou I. Hersey P. Tam N.D.

The STAT4 and STAT1 genes had been located between q32.2 to q32.3 on human chromosome 2 (24Yamamoto K. Kobayashi H. Arai A. Miura O. Hirosawa S. Miyasaka N. Cytogenet.

The CEPH-Genethon Database 2Available at www.cephb.fr/cgi-bin/http_infoclone?D2S118. revealed STAT4 located at marker D2S118 or STS AFM066xc1. YACs from the CEPH human contig library (26Chumakov I.M.

PCR was carried out on YAC DNA samples using primers STAT1 yac3′a and STAT1 yac3′b. DNA products predicted from the STAT1 cDNA sequence (27Schindler C. Fu X.Y. Improta T. Aebersold R.

DNA from clones 805c1 and 809e2 was purified, digested with either PstI or EcoRI (selected because these are infrequent sites present every 4–6 kb), and analyzed by Southern blotting with an α-32P-labeled STAT1 cDNA fragment as a probe. Positive bands were identified, confirming the presence of the STAT1 gene (data not shown). We used bubble PCR (21Munroe D.J. Haas M. Bric E. Whitton T. Aburatani H. Hunter K. Ward D. Housman D.E.

Currently, force-induced cell death and the identity of mechanoprotective factors are not defined. We examined death in cultured periodontal fibroblasts, connective tissue cells that are exposed to heavy applied forces in vivo. Static tensile forces (0.48 piconewtons/μm2 cell area) were applied through magnetite beads coated with collagen or bovine serum albumin. There was a time-dependent increase of the percentage of propidium iodide-permeable cells in force-loaded cultures incubated with collagen but not bovine serum albumin beads, indicating a role for integrins.

There was a rapid (<10-s) decrease in plasma membrane potential after force application, which, in filamin A-deficient melanoma cells, contributed to irreversible cell depolarization. In fibroblast cultures, cells with increased permeability to propidium iodide exhibited ∼2-fold less filamin A content than impermeable cells. Fibroblasts transfected with antisense filamin A constructs or with filamin A constructs without an actin-binding domain exhibited 2–3-fold increased proportions of dead cells relative to controls.

Applied physical forces can also induce cell death (5Cheng W., Li, B. Kajstrura J., Li, P. Wolin M.S. Sonnenbliclk E.H. Hintze T.H. Olivetti G. Anversa P. J. Clin.

For example, stretching forces promote cell death in cultures of cardiac myocytes and rat alveolar type II cells (5Cheng W., Li, B. Kajstrura J., Li, P. Wolin M.S. Sonnenbliclk E.H. Hintze T.H.

Accordingly the failure to adapt to applied mechanical stimuli may provide the pathobiological basis for the tissue destruction and loss of homeostasis observed in heavily loaded connective tissues (e.g. osteoarthritis) (10Loening A.M. James I.E. Levenston M.E. Badger A.M. Frank E.H. Kurz B. Nuttall M.E. Hung H.H. Blake S.M. Grodzinsky A.J. Lark M.W. Arch Biochem.

Appropriate regulation depends on specific paracrine and autocrine signals, ensuring that a cell divides only when more cells are required and that a cell survives only when and where needed (11Singer S.J. Science. 1992; 255: 1671-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 12Jankowski M. Hajjar F. Kawas S.A. Mukaddam-Daher S. Hoffman G. McCann S.M. Gutkowska J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Invest. 1999; 103: 1451-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In addition to chemical signals, cells in mechanically active environments must cope with potentially injurious forces to avoid irreversible membrane damage (9Clements K.M. Bee Z.C. Crossingham G.V. Adams M.A. Sharif M. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2001; 9: 499-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Notably, the cytoskeleton distributes and buffers applied forces at the plasma membrane, thereby reducing the conductance of stretch-activated ion channels and protecting against force-induced cell death (16Ko K.S. McCulloch C.A. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 174: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, the force delivery systems and the nature of the mechanisms that prevent death of cells in mechanically active environment are not defined. Recent data indicate that one of the earliest events in chemically induced cell death in vitro is plasma membrane depolarization (17Bortner C.D. Gomez-Angelats M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4304-4314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we considered that applied forces delivered through extracellular matrix protein receptors located on the plasma membrane of cells may initiate the death process by inducing depolarization. Conversely, membrane-associated proteins that dampen force-induced depolarization would be expected to protect against force-induced cell death. In this context the actin-binding protein filamin A (ABP-280) may protect cells from mechanically induced cell death by virtue of its ability to cross-link actin filaments (18Gorlin J.B. Yamin R.

Noegel A. Schleicher M. Shapiro S.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 2138-2145Crossref Scopus (802) Google Scholar), and dampen force-induced calcium fluxes (21Glogauer M. Arora P.D. Chou D. Janmey P.A. Downey G.P. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1689-1698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Further, applied forces can induce transcriptional activation of the gene for filamin A (22D'Addario M. Arora P.D. Fan J. Ganss B. Ellen R.P. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31969-31977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), thereby suggesting a regulatory mechanism for mechanoprotection at the gene level. In view of these findings, we examined the nature of the cell death that is induced by mechanical forces in fibroblasts from tissues constitutively exposed to high amplitude forces in vivo. We tested the hypotheses that cells exposed to static tensile forces applied through integrins die by apoptosis, that tensile forces cause membrane depolarization and that filamin A protects against force-induced death. Rabbit anti-mouse/rat filamin A antibody was a generous gift of Dr. Martin Stahlhut (23Stahlhut M. van Deurs B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 325-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Mouse anti–human filamin A antibody (clone PM6/317) was from Serotec (Cedarlane Laboratories, Hornby, Ontario, Canada). Mouse anti-human β-actin (clone AC-15) was from Sigma. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse monoclonal antibody to human β1 integrin was from Beckman-Coulter (clone 4B4; Burlington, Ontario, Canada). Rabbit antibody to human active caspase-3 was from R & D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Magnetite microparticles were from Sigma. Acidified soluble collagen (Vitrogen 100) was from Cohesion Technologies (Palo Alto, CA). Studies of functional adaptations to applied force in periodontal ligament and gingiva indicate that the periodontium is an excellent model system to study mechanoprotective phenomena (16Ko K.S. McCulloch C.A. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 174: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Cultured human gingival fibroblasts and Rat-2 cells, which are phenotypically very similar to periodontal cells (24Lew A. Glogauer M. McCulloch C.A.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), were used primarily in this study since, with a collagen-magnetic bead system, forces can be applied through integrins to the actin cytoskeleton (25Glogauer M. Arora P.D. Yao G. Sokholov I. Ferrier J. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 11-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primary cultures of human gingival fibroblast were derived as described (26Pender N. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 100: 187-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells from passages 6–14 were grown as monolayer cultures as described (26Pender N. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 100: 187-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also used Rat-2 fibroblasts (ATCC CRL 1764; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA), which were cultured as described earlier (27Hui M-Z. Tenembaum H.C. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 172: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For experiments in which filamin A was present or absent, melanoma cell lines were grown in α-MEM1 with 8% fetal bovine serum and 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) (19Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). The filamin A+ melanoma cells (A7) were originally derived by stable transfection of a parental filamin A− cell line (M2T) with a mammalian expression vector (LK444) that either did (A7) or did not (M2T) contain the cDNA for full-length ABP-280 (19Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Rat-2 fibroblasts were transfected with Effectine (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were grown to 80% confluence in 35-mm diameter dishes and transfected with 5 μg of plasmid DNA. Fresh culture medium was changed after 16 h. Cells were washed with PBS and used for subsequent experiments 48 h later. All cells were co-transfected with a green fluorescent protein-β-actin fusion construct to estimate transfection efficiency. Sense and antisense PCR-amplified constructs corresponding to the first 333 bp of the coding region of the filamin A gene were generated and ligated into the SmaI site of the pCI mammalian expression vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, PCR-amplified products were generated from oligonucleotides corresponding to positions +1 to +21 (1A; 5′-ATGAGTAGCTCCCACTCTCGG-3′) and +313 to +333 (1B; 5′-AGGTGCTCAGCCAGAAGAAGA-3′). PCR amplification was performed on 100 ng of DNA obtained from human gingival fibroblasts or Rat-2 cells usingPfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The blunt-ended product was purified from a 2.0% agarose gel (QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit; Qiagen) and ligated into the SmaI site of pCI (Promega) using T4 DNA Ligase (Invitrogen). The correct orientation of the insert was established using diagnostic restriction enzyme cleavage and confirmed through sequencing performed at the DNA Sequencing Facility (Center for Applied Genomics, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Human filamin A expression vectors with and without the actin binding domains were produced as follows. First, to tag the human c-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 epitope to the N terminus of filamin A, a PCR fragment was synthesized using human filamin A cDNA as template and the oligonucleotides AGCTTGCCATGGAACAAAAGTTGATTTCTGAAGAAGATTTGAGTAGCTCCCACTCTCGG and TCTTCTTCCACGGCGCG as primers. The PCR product was cloned into pCR-topoTM (Invitrogen), sequenced, and digested withHindIII and SalI. This product was used to replace the N-terminal sequence of full-length human filamin A cDNA in pCDNA3 (Invitrogen), which digested completely at theHindIII site and partially at the SalI site. To make the actin binding domain deletion of the human filamin A, aSalI site was introduced into the Myc-tagged full-length filamin A cDNA at position 697 by the Stratagene QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis system using the oligonucleotides GCCATGCGCGGCGGTCGACTGGCTGGGCATCCC and GGGATGCCCAGCCAGTCGACCGCCTGCTGCATGGC. The resulting cDNA was digested and religated between the newly created SalI site and the original unique SalI site at position 61 of the human filamin A cDNA, which resulted in the deletion of cDNA encoding amino acids Thr23 to Asp233 of human filamin A. A force generation model was used as previously described (25Glogauer M. Arora P.D. Yao G. Sokholov I. Ferrier J. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 11-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, magnetite microparticles (Fe3O4) were coated with collagen (1 mg/ml) or BSA (1 mg/ml), neutralized to pH 7.4, rinsed with PBS, and incubated with cells. Following a 15-min incubation, excess unbound particles were removed by washing with ice-cold PBS. Cells were supplemented with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or α-MEM. A ceramic permanent magnet (Jobmaster, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) was placed on top of the dish to generate a tensile force of ∼0.48 pN/μm2 cell area, a force level that is comparable with that which may be applied to cells in vivo during normal function (21Glogauer M. Arora P.D. Chou D. Janmey P.A. Downey G.P. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1689-1698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). After force application, cells were vitally stained with propidium iodide (PI; 20 μg/ml; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 5 min, washed with PBS, fixed with formaldehyde (2% in PBS) for 10 min, and stained with DAPI (in 0.2% Triton X-100) for total cell counts. Samples were examined with a fluorescence microscope at ×250. The number of PI-permeable cells and the total number of cells (DAPI-positive cells) were counted in three different sampling grids for each sample to yield the percentage of permeable cells. Values from three separate areas were averaged for each sample. For detection of individual apoptotic cells, DNA strand breaks (28Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9098) Google Scholar) were detected with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Roche Diagnostics), which catalyzes polymerization of nucleotides on free 3′-ends of DNA (fluorescence TUNEL method). Paraformaldehyde-fixed cells were permeabilized with Triton X-100, incubated in TUNEL reaction mixture, washed, and stained with DAPI. As a positive control, cells were treated for 24 h with staurosporine (1 μm), a protein kinase inhibitor that induces apoptosis in a wide variety of cell types (29Weil M. Jacobson M.D. Coles H.S. Davies T.J. Gardner R.L. Raff K.D. Raff M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Transmission electron microscopy was performed after a 24-h force application. Cells remaining attached to the dish were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde. Detached cells in the culture medium were sedimented, fixed, and included in the samples for analysis. Thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined in a Hitachi H7000 transmission electron microscope. For assessment of force-induced cell death in vivo, latex rubber separators were placed between the first and second mandibular molar teeth of male Wistar rats (250 g). This maneuver applies tensile forces to rat periodontal ligament cells in vivo (30Roberts W.E. Jee W.S. Arch. Oral Biol. 1974; 19: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 31Nguyen L. Lekic P. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Periodontal Res. 1997; 32: 419-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Controls consisted of animals without separators. Rats were killed at 3 days after stimulation, and jaws were prepared for paraffin sections. The presence of apoptotic cells was determined with TUNEL assays (Intergen, Purchase, NY) followed by counterstaining with methyl green. Immunoblotting was performed as described earlier (22D'Addario M. Arora P.D. Fan J. Ganss B. Ellen R.P. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31969-31977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For immunohistochemistry, Rat-2 cells were cultured on 18-mm diameter coverslips, and force generation was performed as described above. Cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked with 2% BSA, and stained with rabbit anti-human/mouse caspase-3 (0.3 μg/ml), biotinylated second antibody, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-streptavidin. As a positive control, cells were treated with staurosporine (1 μm for 24 h) and stained for TUNEL as described above. JC-1 is a mitochondrial membrane potential-sensitive dye that exists largely as a green fluorescent monomer at low membrane potential in dead or dying cells. At higher (physiological) mitochondrial membrane potentials, JC-1 forms red fluorescent “J-aggregates.” Analysis of JC-1-stained cell suspensions was performed with a FACSTAR Plus flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Rat-2 cells were cultured on 60-mm dishes and subjected to 1 h or overnight force application. To retrieve floating cells that had detached previously from the bottom of the dish, the growth medium was sedimented, and floating cells were suspended in buffer containing 5% fetal bovine serum. For cells remaining attached to the bottom of the dish after force application, cells were prepared as single cell suspensions by tryspinization. Cells were sedimented and resuspended in buffer before adding JC-1 (0.5 μm; Molecular Probes) for 10 min. For positive controls, the mitochondrial membrane potential was dissipated with carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP; 1 μmol; Sigma). A minimum of 10,000 cells were analyzed for each sample. In some experiments, cell sorting was used to divide the cell population into cells with low or high red fluorescence. Gingival fibroblasts, Rat-2, or melanoma cells were plated onto coverslips at ∼5 × 105/coverslip. Magnetite bead loading was done as described above. DiBAC4 solution (Ref. 32Holevinsky K.O. Fan Z.

Physiol. 2000; 279: H2776-H2785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; 5 μm in ethanol) was added to each coverslip for 10 min as described (17Bortner C.D. Gomez-Angelats M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4304-4314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Force was applied for 30 s, and the fluorescence due to DiBaC4 was measured with a photomultiplier tube optically interfaced to an inverted fluorescence microscope (Photon Technology International, London, Ontario, Canada). Excitation monochromators were set to 470 nm, and emission was collected through a bandpass filter (520/10 nm). In control experiments, cells were loaded with BSA-coated beads. Rat-2 cells were treated with staurosporine and with or without acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde (DEVD-CHO; 1 μm), a caspase-3 inhibitor (Calbiochem) (38Affar E.B. Germain M. Winstall E.

After a 4-h incubation, cells were stained with PI and DAPI as described above. Rat-2 cells were also incubated with the caspase-3 inhibitor during force treatment, and the PI-permeable floaters were counted with a hemocytometer. For all studies, experiments were repeated at least three times. For quantitative data, means and S.E. were computed. When appropriate, two sample comparisons were analyzed by Student's unpaired t test and statistical significance set at p < 0.05. After application of static tensile forces (0.48 pN/μm2 cell area) through collagen-coated beads, attached Rat-2 cells and human gingival fibroblasts were stained with PI to estimate the percentage of membrane-permeable cells. Fibroblasts and Rat-2 cells exhibited similar kinetics in the increased percentage of PI-permeable cells over time (Fig. 1, A and B). After 4 h of force application, ∼3% of human gingival fibroblasts and 5% of Rat-2 cells were PI-permeable; after 24 h of force application, ∼30% of both human gingival fibroblasts and Rat-2 cells were PI-permeable. For both Rat-2 cells and gingival fibroblasts, cells incubated with BSA-coated beads and subjected to force exhibited ∼5% PI-permeable cells by 24 h, and cells incubated with collagen beads but without force exhibited ∼4% PI-permeable cells after 24 h. These results were not due to loss of BSA-coated beads from the cells, since the area of cells coated with collagen or BSA-coated beads was similar, as has been shown earlier (23Stahlhut M. van Deurs B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 325-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In separate experiments in which the levels of applied forces were adjusted by altering the distance between the magnet pole face and the bead-loaded cells, lower force levels (∼0.2 pN/μm2cell area) produced no substantial increase of PI-stained cells above no-force controls. Higher force levels (∼1.0 pN/μm2cell area) caused rapid increases of permeability to PI in >50% of the cells and in some instances caused detachment of the collagen-coated beads from the cells. Accordingly, for all subsequent experiments, force levels of 0.48 pN/μm2 cell area were applied. This force level is thought to be comparable with levels applied in vivo (21Glogauer M. Arora P.D. Chou D. Janmey P.A. Downey G.P. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1689-1698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and did not cause artifactual removal of the cells from the dish. Exposure of cells to force applied through collagen-coated beads caused a time-dependent increase in the number of floating cells. After force application, the medium was removed from cultures, and sedimented cells were stained with PI, fixed, permeabilized, and stained with DAPI. Enumeration of cytospin preparations showed that after 24 h of force, there were ∼3–5-fold increased numbers of detached cells compared with control cultures without force. All detached cells (floaters) were permeable to PI (Fig. 1C) and did not attach to culture dishes after replating. Electron microscopy of force-treated Rat-2 cells (Fig. 1D, 1–3) showed degenerative changes including condensation of chromatin and the formation of large lysosome-like structures (Fig. 1D, 1). In some cells, there was also loss of normal cytoplasmic structure, and in many other cells only remnants of organelles could be recognized (Fig. 1D, 2 and 3). The morphological aspects of apoptotic cell death in the floating and attached cells were similar, including chromatin condensation and large lysosome-like structures, although the floating cells were much smaller (see below). We considered that the induction of cell death by force may promote the release of factors from dying or dead cells that promote cell death in other, still living cells. To test this concept, we incubated Rat-2 cells with collagen beads and then applied (or did not apply) force for 14 h as described above. The medium from the force-treated and control cells was collected, and the floating cells were pelleted. This “conditioned medium” was added full strength to fresh cultures of Rat-2 cells for 4 h, and cells were vitally stained with PI. The percentage of PI-stained cells was close to 0 in both force-treated and control media (one ×25 microscopic field counted in five replicate cultures; percentage of PI-positive cells as follows: force-treated medium = 1.0 ± 0.4%; control-treated medium = 0.7 ± 0.3%; p > 0.2). Thus, we were unable to detect any soluble factors released from mechanically stimulated cells that may promote cell death. After exposure to tensile forces for 4–24 h, morphological examination of cells remaining attached to the culture dish and floating cells showed that after staining with PI and DAPI, the floating cells were shrunken, and many nuclei were condensed and brightly stained. There was no difference in the morphological appearance of nuclei from floating and PI-permeable attached cells. To detect the presence of presumptive apoptotic cells after force application, in situ DNA nick labeling was used to stain both attached and floating cells. After overnight force application, Rat-2 cells showed high proportions of positively stained cells, indicating the presence of fragmented DNA (∼20%; Fig.2A). The nuclei of TUNEL-positive cells were also stained with PI (Fig. 2A, 2). DAPI staining showed more condensed brightly stained nuclei in presumptive apoptotic cells (Fig. 2A, 3). As a positive control for apoptosis, separate cultures were treated with staurosporine, and these cultures showed large numbers of TUNEL-positive cells (Fig. 2A, 4). These in vitro results with cultured cells were consistent with results obtained from experimental force application for 3 days in vivo in which we counted >5 TUNEL-positive fibroblasts per high power microscopic field at sites of increased mechanical stress in the periodontium (Fig. 2B). In samples without force application, there was <1 TUNEL-positive cell per microscopic field (p < 0.01; n = 3 animals per group; 3 fields per animal). We also used staining for active caspase-3 to evaluate late stage effectors of apoptosis in cells following force application in vitro. After 2-h or overnight force application, Rat-2 cells showed positive staining for active caspase-3 (Fig. 2C, 1). Control cells without force application were not stained (Fig. 2, inset). Control cells pretreated with staurosporine for 4 h showed staining for active caspase-3 (Fig. 2C, 3 and 4). After 4 h of treatment with staurosporine and co-incubation with DEVD-CHO, a specific caspase-3 inhibitor, there were fewer PI-permeable cells compared with control cultures without the caspase-3 inhibitor (Fig.3A). Accordingly, we considered that applied force may induce cell death through a caspase-3-dependent pathway. Rat-2 cells were incubated with the caspase-3 inhibitor DEVD-CHO during force application, and the detached, PI-permeable cells were counted (Fig. 3B). We found that force increased the numbers of floating cells by 7-fold. When cells were treated with"

In nonstimulated cells, phosphatidylserine, an anionic aminophospholipid essential for the hemostatic response, is mostly sequestered in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Cell stimulation by Ca2+-mobilizing or apoptogenic agents induces the migration of phosphatidylserine to the exoplasmic leaflet, allowing the assembly and activation of several key enzyme complexes of the coagulation cascade and phagocyte recognition of stimulated or senescent cells. We have recently proposed that store-operated Ca2+ entry regulates externalization of phosphatidylserine at the cell surface (Kunzelmann-Marche, C., Freyssinet, J.-M., and Martı́nez, M. C. (2001)J. Biol. Chem. 276, 5134–5139). Here, we show that store-operated Ca2+ entry and phosphatidylserine exposure are dramatically reduced after raft disruption by methyl-β-cyclodextrin. In addition, transient receptor potential channel 1-specific antibody was able to significantly decrease Ca2+-induced redistribution of phosphatidylserine. Furthermore, store-operated Ca2+ entry and phosphatidylserine exposure were dependent in part on the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway associated with rafts. Hence, raft integrity and store-operated Ca2+ entry involving transient receptor potential channel 1 channels are essential for completion of the phosphatidylserine transmembrane redistribution process.

When internal Ca2+ stores are depleted, an as yet unknown signal triggers the opening of Ca2+ channels localized in the plasma membrane, allowing subsequent Ca2+ influx (1Putney J.W., Jr. Cell. 1999; 99: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 2Berridge M.J.

Although the mechanisms governing SOCE are not completely elucidated, recent studies in human platelets suggest the involvement of actin polymerization, phosphorylation cascades, and coupling between the endoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane through TRPC1 (3Rosado J.A.

After cell stimulation, including apoptosis, and subsequent Ca2+increase, cells lose their plasma membrane phospholipid asymmetry and expose PS in the exoplasmic leaflet (6Martin S.J.

Among the various pathways known to be associated with raft domains, Ca2+ regulation seems to be dependent on rafts to facilitate the association of appropriate signaling proteins (19de Weerd W.F.C.

For example, recruitment of several members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family into these microdomains leads to the activation of other downstream kinases (21Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar, 22Hart K.C. Robertson S.C. Donoghue D.J. Exp.

Recently, the MAPK pathway has been found to be able to regulate SOCE in platelets (4Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15659-15665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). TRPC1 has been localized in the membrane rafts, where it interacts, either directly or indirectly, with a complex of Ca2+ signaling proteins (24Lockwich T.P. Liu X. Singh B.B. Jadlowiec J. Weiland S. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11934-11942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 25Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Here, we have investigated the contribution of lipid rafts and TRPC1 in both SOCE and PS outward translocation and their regulation by the mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK) cascade. Perturbation of raft integrity dramatically reduced both SOCE and PS transmembrane redistribution, with participation of the MEK pathway, which is also modulated by cholesterol depletion. RPMI 1640 medium and fetal calf serum were from Invitrogen, and other cell culture reagents were from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). Ca2+ ionophore A23187, U0126 (1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis(2-aminophenylthio)butadiene), and PD98059 (2′-amino-3′-methoxyflavone) were obtained from Calbiochem. Fluo-3/acetoxymethyl ester (Fluo-3) was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), and thapsigargin (TG) was obtained from Alexis Corp. (San Diego, CA). Methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MCD), norepinephrine (NE), and monoclonal antibody to phospho-ERK1/2 were from Sigma Chemical Co. Monoclonal antibody to Ras was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Rabbit polyclonal antibody to human TRPC1 was from Alomone Laboratories (Jerusalem, Israel) and was used after dialysis to remove sodium azide. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody was from Leinco Technologies (Ballwin, MO). Enhanced chemiluminescence reagents and CL-XPosure film were obtained from Pierce. Human blood coagulation factors Xa, thrombin (THR) and prothrombin, annexin V, and annexin V-FITC (annexin V conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate) were respectively the same as those used previously in our laboratory (15Kunzelmann-Marche C. Freyssinet J.-M. Martinez M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5134-5139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Factor V was purchased from Diagnostica Stago (Asnières, France), and chromogenic substrate Chromozyme TH® (H-d-phenylalanyl-l-pipecolyl-l-arginine-p-nitroaniline-dihydro-chloride) was obtained from Roche Diagnostics. Human erythroleukemia (HEL, ATCC TIB-180) cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented as described previously (15Kunzelmann-Marche C. Freyssinet J.-M. Martinez M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5134-5139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) plus 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. All experiments were performed with the maximal concentrations of inhibitors at which no cytotoxicity was observed, as deduced from trypan blue exclusion. Experimental procedures were the same as those detailed in a previous study (15Kunzelmann-Marche C. Freyssinet J.-M. Martinez M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5134-5139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEL cells were loaded with 3 μm Fluo-3 in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with CaCl2 (final Ca2+ concentration, ∼1 mm). To study Ca2+ release and Ca2+entry separately, experiments were performed in the presence of EGTA (1 mm) in the extracellular medium. Cells were then stimulated by the different agents, and, when indicated, CaCl2 was added to restore an extracellular Ca2+ concentration of ∼1 mm, allowing SOCE. Fluo-3 fluorescence was monitored using a FACScan BD PharMingen flow cytometer. After stimulation, HEL cells were pelleted in a microcentrifuge, and the pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml of ice-cold 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.2, containing 158 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm Na3VO4. The suspensions were lysed by three freezing-thawing steps, and intact cells were removed by centrifugation at 1500 × g. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 60 min to obtain the membrane and cytosolic fractions. Membranes were washed with cold Tris buffer solution containing 1 mmNa3VO4 and resuspended in 10 mmTris/HCl buffer, pH 7.2, containing 158 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmNa3VO4. Lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min to remove insoluble substances. Lysates (cytoplasm fraction) were used to evaluate ERK phosphorylation, and Ras protein was detected in the membrane counterpart. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Blots were probed with monoclonal antibodies to phospho-ERK1/2 or Ras and developed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. Proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence reagents and then exposed to CL-XPosure films. Procoagulant PS exposure in stimulated cells was detected using a human prothrombinase assay in which this phospholipid is the rate-limiting parameter promoting the activation of prothrombin by factor Xa in the presence of factor Va (26Connor J. Schroit A.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9680-9685Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thrombin generated by the assembled prothrombinase complex was measured using a chromogenic assay, as described previously (15Kunzelmann-Marche C. Freyssinet J.-M. Martinez M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5134-5139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cells were activated under the same conditions described above and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 2 min, resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution, and visualized by fluorescence laser scanning microscopy. The fluorescence was acquired by using Spot Software from Diagnostic Instruments, Inc. (Sterling Heights, MI). To enable comparison, all images were recorded using the same parameters of laser power and photomultiplier sensitivity. Images shown are representative of at least three separate experiments for each condition and were processed by using identical values for contrast and brightness. Results were expressed as the mean ± S.E. of at least four separate experiments performed at different culture stages and/or passages, with no obvious difference attributable to the culture conditions. Paired Student's t test was used for statistical analysis. p < 0.05 was considered significant. To determine whether Ca2+ signaling is modulated by lipid rafts, cells were treated with MCD, an agent able to extract cholesterol from the plasma membrane, leading to raft disruption (27Ohvo H. Slotte J.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8018-8024Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 1, A and B,MCD treatment resulted in a reduction of 59 ± 4% of the amplitude of the Ca2+ response in A23187-stimulated cells. To establish whether disruption of lipid raft domains affects Ca2+ release from intracellular stores or SOCE, control and MCD-treated cells were initially stimulated with TG, an inhibitor of reticulum endoplasmic Ca2+-ATPases, in the presence of EGTA in the extracellular medium (Fig. 1, C and D). Under these conditions, MCD reduced the TG-induced Ca2+response (47 ± 9% inhibition compared with the value in its absence), providing evidence that Ca2+ release requires interaction between Ca2+ stores and the plasma membrane. The inhibition of Ca2+ release by MCD resulted in the reduction of the magnitude of SOCE upon CaCl2reintroduction, as reported recently in other cell types (24Lockwich T.P. Liu X. Singh B.B.

Immunol. 2000; 30: 954-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). With respect to controls, the inhibition due to MCD was 69 ± 7%. In contrast, stimulation by the combination of NE (30Kukkonen J.P. Jansson C.C. Akerman K.E. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 1477-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and THR (31Wu H. Shen H.W. Wu T.F. Brass L.F. Sung K.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 300: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), two agonists of G-protein-coupled receptors, evoked Ca2+signal with two distinct phases: a rapid rise in [Ca2+]i within a few seconds, followed by an exponential decrease lasting several minutes (Fig. 2A). The latter was more rapid in the presence of EGTA, indicating that this phase of Ca2+response corresponds to Ca2+ entry induced by store depletion when Ca2+ was present in the external medium. The association of both agonists elicited a substantially higher transient increase in [Ca2+]i than each of them taken separately (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2B, pretreatment of HEL cells with 10 mm MCD for 30 min at 37 °C resulted in a substantial inhibition of the elevation in [Ca2+]i evoked by the association of NE and thrombin in medium containing 1 mm CaCl2. The initial [Ca2+]i peak was significantly reduced from 248 ± 31 to 82 ± 24 arbitrary fluorescence units (n = 8; p < 0.001), and the amplitude of Ca2+ entry, corresponding to the exponentially decreasing phase, was almost abolished (93 ± 1% reduction;p < 0.05). In the absence of external Ca2+(1 mm EGTA in the external medium), MCD also affected the NE/thrombin-evoked rise in [Ca2+]i. The initial [Ca2+]i peak was 244 ± 11 arbitrary fluorescence units in control cells and 18 ± 8 arbitrary fluorescence units in MCD-treated cells (n = 7;p < 0.001). These results demonstrate that disruption of lipid raft domains accounts for the regulation of Ca2+ signaling in general and SOCE in particular. The transbilayer movement of endogenous PS was assessed by the procoagulant prothrombinase functional assay and by annexin V labeling (32Andree H.A.M. Reutelingsperger C.P.M. Hauptmann R. Hemker H.C. Hermes W.T. Willems G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4923-4928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the former gave a quantitative estimation, and the latter gave an indication of the proportion of PS-positive cells. In the absence of stimulation (Fig. 3A), the cells presented a basal PS-dependent prothrombinase activity of 0.24 ± 0.07 NIH units of thrombin generated/min/ml/2 × 105 cells. After treatment with 10 mm MCD, this activity was not significantly modified, testifying to nonperturbed PS asymmetric distribution. The association of NE and thrombin did not elicit a noticeable increase in prothrombinase activity. After Ca2+ ionophore treatment, prothrombinase activity was enhanced ∼4.2-fold. MCD significantly reduced the development of prothrombinase activity induced by Ca2+ ionophore with an inhibition of ∼68% (Fig. 3A). These results were confirmed by fluorescence microscopy with annexin V-FITC as a specific probe for PS (Fig. 3B). Unstimulated (control) cells were poorly labeled, indicating a low basal exposure of PS currently observed (15Kunzelmann-Marche C. Freyssinet J.-M. Martinez M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5134-5139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Ionophore A23187 induced extensive PS exposure, as evidenced by the high fluorescence intensity. Disruption of raft integrity by MCD in A23187-stimulated cells resulted in a more scattered annexin V labeling, corresponding to an important reduction of the degree of PS transbilayer redistribution at the cell surface. Collectively, these results show that PS externalization requires the integrity of membrane rafts. Prompted by recent work demonstrating the expression of TRPC1 in platelets and megakaryocytic cells (3Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Trends Cardovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 33Berg L.P. Shamsher M.K., El- Daher S.S. Kakkar V.V. Authi K.S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we confirmed this observation in HEL cells using a polyclonal antibody targeted to a mammalian TRPC1-specific peptide (data not shown). Because TRPC1 is a candidate for the mediation of SOCE in normal human cells (3Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Trends Cardovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the effect of TRPC1-specific antibody was assessed with respect to alteration of Ca2+ signal. In the presence of anti-TRPC1, Ca2+ response induced by A23187 was reduced (Fig. 4A). This antibody also interfered with Ca2+ store release and entry in response to TG (Fig. 4B). Although the blocking effect of antibody to TRPC1 was only partial at the low concentration used (1:100 dilution, corresponding to a final concentration of 3 μg/ml in the incubation mixture), it was statistically significant in seven independent experiments and was peptide-specific because it was abolished after preadsorption to antigenic peptide (data not shown). This indicates that TRPC1 mediates SOCE, at least in part. In addition, the fact that this antibody reduced TG-induced response suggests that the coupling between Ca2+ stores and the plasma membrane occurs, at least in part, through TRPC1. Fig. 4C shows the effect of TRPC1-specific antibody on PS externalization at the HEL cell membrane surface. This antibody by itself did not significantly modify prothrombinase activity. However, in A23187-stimulated cells, the development of prothrombinase activity was significantly attenuated (∼25% of inhibition) after incubation with the TRPC1-specific antibody (Fig. 4C). This supports the view that Ca2+ entry through TRPC1 is involved in PS transmembrane redistribution. It must be emphasized that this polyclonal antibody was deliberately used at a low concentration to avoid artifactual membrane perturbation, which may explain the observation that inhibition of SOCE and prothrombinase activity was only partial. To investigate the role of the ERK cascade in Ca2+ response, the effect of two structurally unrelated inhibitors of MEK, PD98059 (34Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3957) Google Scholar) and U0126 (35Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Dyk D.E.V. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar), was examined. These agents were deliberately used at a low concentration to prevent artificial perturbation of lipid organization in the plasma membrane. Both inhibitors reduced the Ca2+ ionophore-induced response, with an inhibition of 47 ± 4% and 54 ± 4% for PD98059 and U0126, respectively (Fig. 5A). In the presence of EGTA, both inhibitors also diminished the TG-evoked Ca2+ signal (52 ± 7% and 65 ± 2% inhibition for PD98059 and U0126, respectively), indicating that Ca2+ release from stores involves coupling with the MEK pathway (Fig. 5B). In addition, both inhibitors reduced the CaCl2-induced response in TG-stimulated cells (49 ± 9% and 59 ± 8% inhibition for PD98059 and U0126, respectively), in agreement with observations in platelets (4Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15659-15665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These results suggest that SOCE is partially dependent on ERK activation in HEL cells. MEK inhibition resulted in a reduction of A23187-induced PS exposure by ∼25% as measured by the prothrombinase assay (Fig. 5C). Hence, it is likely that the diminution of Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane in relation to MEK inhibition results in the reduction of PS exposure. Indeed, these results confirm that SOCE regulates PS externalization at the cell surface and suggest that activation of the ERK cascade modulates, at least in part, PS transmembrane redistribution. The activation of ERK was analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 5D, in A23187-stimulated HEL cells, phosphorylation/activation of both isoforms of ERK (p44-ERK1 and p42-ERK2) was detected in the cytosolic fraction. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was partly inhibited by the MEK inhibitor U0126, which was again used at a low concentration to avoid artifactual membrane perturbation. Cholesterol depletion by MCD resulted in almost complete inhibition of A23187-induced activation of ERK1 with a concomitant reduction of ERK2 phosphorylation, testifying to the participation of the ERK pathway in the organization of the plasma membrane and, more particularly, of lipid microdomains. To determine whether Ras protein is recruited at the plasma membrane, we therefore investigated whether raft disruption by MCD was responsible for alterations of its subcellular localization. Ca2+ ionophore A23187 induced an enhancement of Ras translocation to the membrane, but cholesterol depletion severely impaired this association (Fig. 5E), confirming that the integrity of lipid rafts is important for the translocation of Ras and activation of the ERK pathway. Here, we provide direct evidence that the activation of the ERK cascade is coupled with membrane rafts. Altogether, PS externalization requires the integrity of rafts, SOCE, and participation of the ERK pathway. Recent data suggest that SOCE is essential for the regulation of a variety of cell functions and the maintenance of Ca2+homeostasis. We have shown previously that PS exposure in stimulated cell is related to the level of SOCE (15Kunzelmann-Marche C. Freyssinet J.-M. Martinez M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5134-5139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 36Martin S. Laude-Lemaire I. Kerbiriou-Nabias D. Freyssinet J.M. Martinez M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms controlling SOCE and PS externalization remain obscure. The data presented here show that SOCE and PS externalization are dramatically reduced after disruption of raft integrity in the plasma membrane and in the presence of TRPC1-specific antibody. Furthermore, SOCE and PS exposure are regulated, at least in part, by activation of the ERK pathway associated with rafts. Hence, raft integrity and SOCE involving TRPC1 are essential for completion of the PS transmembrane redistribution process. The potential function of lipid rafts in Ca2+ signaling was investigated after partial cholesterol depletion by noninvasive extraction by MCD (27Ohvo H. Slotte J.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8018-8024Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). MCD is a widely used tool to study the function of membrane cholesterol. Without incorporating itself into the membrane, MCD selectively extracts cholesterol from the surface of the cell (37Yancey P.G. Rodrigueza W.V. Kilsdonk E.P. Stoudt G.W. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16026-16034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 38Christian A.E. Haynes M.P. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 13473-13478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This probably explains why it has no deleterious effect on cell viability and on membrane asymmetry as verified here. MCD treatment reduced Ca2+ ionophore- and TG-induced Ca2+ release and entry, suggesting that raft integrity is essential for normal Ca2+ handling in HEL cells. Consistent with these observations, recent studies have shown that disruption of raft microdomains reduced Ca2+ influx triggered by receptor activation in T and B cells or by TG treatment in salivary epithelial cells (24Lockwich T.P. Liu X. Singh B.B. Jadlowiec J. Weiland S. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11934-11942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 28Aman M.J. Ravichandran K.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 393-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 29Kabouridis P.S. Janzen J. Magee A.L. Ley S.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 954-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). These data suggest that rafts play a crucial role in the regulation of Ca2+ signaling in general and SOCE in particular. In this respect, it has been shown that TRPC1, a candidate protein for store-operated Ca2+ channels, is localized in the lipid raft domains in the plasma membrane, where it interacts, either directly or indirectly, with a complex of Ca2+signaling proteins such as the inositol trisphosphate receptor (24Lockwich T.P. Liu X. Singh B.B. Jadlowiec J. Weiland S. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11934-11942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar,25Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Because HEL cells express TRPC1, a similar interaction between this channel and lipid raft domains can be reasonably hypothesized in these megakaryocytic cells. Because MEK inhibitors significantly reduced Ca2+ionophore-mediated Ca2+ influx, it is highly probable that the significant reduction due to both agents PD98059 and U0126 occurs via SOCE. In this respect, it has been shown that the Ca2+signal induced by Ca2+ ionophores, thrombin, or epinephrine elicits ERK1/2 phosphorylation in several cell types, including HEL cells (31Wu H. Shen H.W. Wu T.F. Brass L.F. Sung K.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 300: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 40Atherfold P.A. Norris M.S. Robinson P.J. Gelfand E.W. Franklin R.A. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, both MEK inhibitors reduced the Ca2+ response elicited to A23187 and Ca2+ entry to the same extent in TG-treated cells. The data are in agreement with those obtained in platelets, where the MAPK pathway has been described to regulate SOCE (4Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15659-15665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we show that the ERK pathway is closely associated with raft integrity/formation, and mobilization of Ras to the membrane compartment is required for activation of the MEK kinase pathway in HEL cells. In this respect, a recent study has reported that depletion of plasma membrane cholesterol also prevented insulin-dependent phosphorylation of MEK and Ras translocation to the plasma membrane in HIRcB fibroblasts (41Rizzo M.A. Kraft C.A. Watkins S.C. Levitan E.S. Romero G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34928-34933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In contrast, extensive cholesterol depletion in adipocytes had no effect on ERK1/2 phosphorylation (42Parpal S. Karlsson M. Thorn H. Stralfors P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9670-9678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). This discrepancy is probably related to a wide variability in the activation of the ERK pathway as a function of the cell type. In the present study, A23187 Ca2+ ionophore was used at 2 μm for 10 min at 37 °C to preserve cell viability while inducing PS exposure at the cell surface and expression of membrane-associated procoagulant activity. It has been shown that Ca2+ ionophores promote intracellular Ca2+store depletion and subsequent SOCE (43Fasolato C. Nilius B. Pflügers Arch. 1998; 436: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 44Ma H.T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 45Bishara N.B. Murphy T.V. Hill M.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 135: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this context, we can reasonably assume that the effects of the different compounds used here on A23187-induced Ca2+ response are relevant to Ca2+ entry mediated by store depletion or to Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. This view is further supported by the results obtained with TG treatment, which triggers Ca2+ entry but does not form channels in the plasma membrane. In addition, raft disruption by MCD also resulted in reduced Ca2+ response to thrombin and NE, two agonists of G-protein-coupled receptors, although these agonists were not able to promote PS externalization. This confirms that an elevated and sustained [Ca2+]i is absolutely necessary for PS exposure, in agreement with other reports, and explains why ionophores are the commonly used activators (9Zwaal R.F. Schroit A.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 1121-1132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Scott syndrome, a genetic defect of PS transmembrane redistribution, blood cells are nonresponsive to Ca2+ ionophores (9Zwaal R.F. Schroit A.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 1121-1132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and precisely show defective SOCE (46Martinez M.C. Martin S. Toti F. Fressinaud E. Dachary-Prigent J. Meyer D. Freyssinet J.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10092-10098Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). MEK inhibitors reduced prothrombinase activity induced by Ca2+ ionophore. Hence, it is likely that the diminution of Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane due to MEK inhibition results in reduction of PS exposure. Indeed, these results confirm that SOCE regulates PS externalization and suggest that activation of the MAPK pathway plays a role in the transmembrane redistribution of PS at the cell surface. As discussed above, there is direct evidence that the activation of the MAPK cascade is coupled with membrane rafts. PS externalization requires both the integrity of membrane rafts and activation of MAPK pathway. The dramatic raft-disrupting effect of MCD on the ability of cells to externalize PS suggests that the transporter(s) or the regulatory elements involved in PS externalization could be localized into or near to lipid rafts. In this context, it has been shown that PS can be found in membrane lipid microdomains in association with B-cell receptor, suggesting a role for this aminophospholipid in the interaction of signaling molecules with their intracellular targets (47Dillon S.R. Mancini M. Rosen A. Schlissel M.S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1322-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Besides this, ABCA1, a lipid transporter recently described to favor the transmembrane redistribution of PS and cholesterol efflux (48Hamon Y. Broccardo C. Chambenoit O. Luciani M.F. Toti F. Chaslin S. Freyssinet J.M. Devaux P.F. McNeish J. Marguet D. Chimini G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), is thought to be preferentially distributed in membrane domains distinct from cholesterol-rich rafts (49Mendez A.J. Lin G. Wade D.P. Lawn R.M. Oram J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3158-3166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In addition, Fielding et al. (50Fielding P.E. Nagao K. Hakamata H. Chimini G. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14113-14120Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) have observed several differences in the phospholipid composition of the membrane domains where ABCA1 is found, depending on the cellular model. Thus, ABCA1 could be localized not in but near to the lipid rafts. Our previous results (15Kunzelmann-Marche C. Freyssinet J.-M. Martinez M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5134-5139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 46Martinez M.C. Martin S. Toti F. Fressinaud E. Dachary-Prigent J. Meyer D. Freyssinet J.M.

In this context, lipid rafts appear to provide an appropriate environment for the assembly of some of these effector complexes, and the search for further links between elements involved in the maintenance of membrane homeostasis and plasticity remains an obvious challenge."
https://openalex.org/W2082765660,"ATF6 is a 670-amino acid endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane protein that is cleaved in response to ER stress. The resulting N-terminal fragment of ∼400 amino acids translocates to the nucleus and activates selected ER stress-inducible genes, such as <i>GRP-78</i> and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum ATPase, which are required for cell survival. In studying the mechanism of ATF6-activated transcription, we found that when HeLa cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding ATF6-(1–373), ER stress-inducible reporter gene activation was high, but ATF6-(1–373) expression was low, unless a proteasome inhibitor was added. In contrast, transfection with a plasmid encoding ATF6-(94–373) resulted in low reporter activation and high expression of ATF6-(94–373), which was independent of the proteasome inhibitor. Thus, the information responsible for transcriptional activation and proteasomal degradation must lie within the N-terminal 93 amino acids of ATF6. This portion of ATF6 was found to be homologous to the herpes simplex viral protein, VP16. One 8-amino acid domain of particular interest in this region of ATF6 is 75% identical to the VN8 region in VP16. VN8 is required for VP16-mediated transcription, as well as rapid degradation of VP16 by proteasomes. Point mutations in the VN8-like region of ATF6 caused a loss of transcription, increased expression levels, and an increase in half-life. Thus, the potent transcriptional activities and rapid degradation of ATF6 and VP16 require the VN8 domains in each protein. Homology searches indicate that ATF6 is the only eukaryotic protein known that possesses an active VN8 domain, raising questions about how this domain evolved and the functional importance underlying its appearance in only these two transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W2009273763,"Heparan sulfate proteoglycans are thought to mediate the action of growth factors. The heparan sulfate-containing proteoglycans in extracts of the bovine fetal rib growth plate were detected using the monoclonal antibody 3G10, which recognizes a neoepitope generated by heparitinase digestion (David, G., Bai, X. M., Van der Schueren, B., Cassiman, J. J., and Van den Berghe, H. (1992) J. Cell Biol. 119, 961–975). The heparan sulfate proteoglycans that react with this antibody were identified using antisera to known proteoglycans; purified using CsCl density gradient centrifugation, molecular sieve, and ion exchange chromatography; and then characterized. The major heparan sulfate proteoglycans in the growth plate had core proteins of 200 kDa and larger and were identified as perlecan and aggrecan. These two heparan sulfate proteoglycans could be effectively separated from each other by CsCl density gradient centrifugation alone. Perlecan contained 25% heparan sulfate and 75% chondroitin sulfate. The heparan sulfate chains on growth plate perlecan were considerably smaller than the chondroitin sulfate chains, and the heparan sulfate disaccharide content was different than that found for heparan sulfate from either kidney, tumor tissue, or growth plate aggrecan. Aggrecan contained only 0.1% heparan sulfate, which was localized to the CS-1 domain of aggrecan. These results indicate that perlecan and aggrecan would be the principal candidate proteoglycans involved in the action of heparan sulfate-binding proteins in the developing growth plate."
https://openalex.org/W2056836862,"A number of cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) inhibitors were tested for the ability to protect IPC-81 rat leukemic cells against cAMP-induced apoptosis. A near perfect proportionality was observed between inhibitor potency to protect against cAMP-induced apoptosis and to antagonize CDK5, and to a lesser extent, CDK2 and CDK1. Enforced expression of dominant negative CDK5 (but not CDK1-dn or CDK2-dn) protected against death, indicating that CDK5 activity was necessary for cAMP-induced apoptosis. The CDK inhibitors failed to protect the cells against daunorubicine-, staurosporine-, or okadaic acid-induced apoptosis. The inhibition of CDK5 prevented the cleavage of pro-caspase-3 in cAMP-treated cells. The cells could be saved closer to the moment of their onset of death by inhibitors of caspases than by inhibitors of CDK5. This suggested that the action of CDK5 was upstream of caspase activation. The cAMP treatment resulted in a moderate increase of the level of CDK5 mRNA and protein in IPC-81 wild-type cells. Such cAMP induction of CDK5 was not observed in cells expressing the inducible cAMP early repressor. The cAMP-induced increase of CDK5 contributed to apoptosis since cells overexpressing CDK5-wt were more sensitive for cAMP-induced death.

This observation spurred a closer study of the role of CDK5 in cAMP-induced cell death. cAMP-dependent protein kinase responsive element cAMP-response element-binding protein CRE modulator inducible cAMP early repressor cyclin-dependent protein kinase glycogen-synthease kinase3 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine 3′: 5′-cyclic monophosphat z-val-ala-DL-asp-fluormethylketone dominant negative roscovitine (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate) green fluorescent protein enhanced GFP dominant-negative wild-type The common general function of the CDK family members is to ensure the normal progression through the cell cycle, and they are tightly regulated by the sequential expression of cyclins (14van den Heuvel S.

Cdk5 has high sequence similarity to the cell cycle regulating CDK family members, but it is neither activated by cyclins nor involved in cell cycle regulation ((24Meyerson M. Enders G.H. Wu C.L.

Until recently, the expression of CDK5 and its activators, p35/25 and p39, were believed to be restricted to the nervous system (28Humbert S. Dhavan R. Tsai L. J.

Zelenka P. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1145-1153PubMed Google Scholar). The evidence for a role of CDK5 outside the nervous system is scant. Both CDK5 and p35 have been detected in developing tissues during periods of programmed cell elimination (39Gao C.Y. Zakeri Z. Zhu Y., He, H. Zelenka P.S. Dev. Genet. 1997; 20: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 40Ahuja H.S. Zhu Y. Zakeri Z. Dev. Genet. 1997; 21: 258-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cdk5 has been shown by immunohistochemistry to be concentrated in dying cells (31Zhang Q. Ahuja H.S. Zakeri Z.F. Wolgemuth D.J. Dev.

The present study demonstrates an essential role for CDK5 in the apoptotic process induced by the cAMP analog 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine 3′: 5′-cyclic monophosphate (8-CPT-cAMP) in promyelocytic cells. By using cell-permeable CDK5 antagonists (41Meijer L. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1995; 1: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), a requirement for CDK activity is demonstrated in a narrow time window preceding caspase activation. Finally, overexpression of CDK5-wt is shown to enhance death, whereas enforced expression of dominantly negative CDK5 will protect against apoptosis. The protein kinase inhibitors butyrolactone-1 and olomoucine were from Calbiochem, alsterpaullone and purvalanol A were from Alexis Corp. (Lausen, Switzerland), 6-(γ,γ-dimethylallylamino) purine (isopentenyladenine) was from Sigma, roscovitine (RCV) was from Biomol(Plymouth, MA), and KN93 was from Seikagaku America, Inc.

The pCMV-CDK1-dn and pCMV-CDK2-dn (14van den Heuvel S. Harlow E. Science. 1993; 262: 2050-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar) was a gift from David Ucker at the University of Illinois, Chicago, IL. Mouse brain extract was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, SC-2253). The cells used were either the wild-type IPC-81 rat promeolytic leukemia cell line or a subclone, IPC-81ICER (kindly provided by Dr. M. Lanotte, Hôp, St. Louis, Paris, France), with enforced, stable expression of ICER, which is an inhibitor of gene transcription via the CREB and CREM family of cAMP-regulated transcription factors (13Ruchaud S. Seite P. Foulkes N.S. Sassone-Corsi P. Lanotte M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 827-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 7% horse serum (Invitrogen), streptomycin (5 μg/ml), and penicillin (5 units/ml) (7Gjertsen B.T. Cressey L.I. Ruchaud S. Houge G. Lanotte M. Døskeland S.O. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3363-3377PubMed Google Scholar). The cells had a doubling time of 11–12 h and were kept in continuous logarithmic growth. The cell density was adjusted to 200,000 cells/ml when experiments were started. Apoptosis was determined as described and validated previously (7Gjertsen B.T. Cressey L.I. Ruchaud S. Houge G. Lanotte M. Døskeland S.O. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3363-3377PubMed Google Scholar, 44Vintermyr O.K. Gjertsen B.T. Lanotte M. Døskeland S.O. Exp.

The evaluation was done blindly by two independent and experienced evaluators. Random microscopic fields were selected for study with cells with more than 50% of the area within the chosen sector being included for analysis. IPC-81 cells were treated for various periods of time with 8-CPT-cAMP or vehicle (control), and their RNA was extracted by the acidic guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method (45Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63187) Google Scholar). The RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase to remove contaminating genomic DNA, and its integrity was checked by gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. For Northern blot analysis, the RNA (20 μg/lane) was separated on a 1.2% formaldehyde/agarose gel and transferred by capillary blotting to a Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The DNA probes for hybridization were labeled using a random Ready-Prime priming kit (Amersham Biosciences) and [α-32P]dCTP. After hybridization, membranes were analyzed on a BAS-5000 phosphorimaging device (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). The CDK5 probe was a 235-bp fragment of the human CDK5 cDNA excised from vector pT3T3D-Pac cloning (Amersham Biosciences) carrying a 499-bp fragment of human CDK5 cDNA (expressed sequence tag sequence; accession number AA482510.1) isolated from clone IMAGp998L121856Q2 (obtained from Resource Centre/Primary Data base (RZPD); www.rzpd.de/cgi-bin/db/cloneInfo.pl.cgi). A 2.0-kbp actin probe was purchased from CLONTECH and similarly labeled. For analysis of the expression of multiple genes, an Atlas cDNA expression array containing 597 different mouse 3′-end cDNA segments (CLONTECH) was used. Preparation of radio-labeled cDNA from mRNA and subsequent hybridization to the cDNA arrays was performed as recommended by the manufacturer. The amount of radio-labeled probe specifically bound to the various cDNAs was measured densitometrically by Bas-5000 phosphorimaging device (Fujifilm) and expressed in arbitrary units. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in 10 mmK2HPO4, 10 mmKH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA (pH 6.8) containing 10 mm CHAPS, 50 μm NaF, 0.3 μm NaVO3 (natrium-monovanadat) supplemented with Complete mini protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The homogenate was sonicated and clarified by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). Extract aliquots containing 30 μg of protein were subjected to SDS gel electrophoresis (12.5% acrylamide SDS-denaturing gels). Proteins were transferred to a polyvinyldifluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and probed with either polyclonal rabbit anti-CDK5 (C-8; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, dilution 1:1000), monoclonal mouse anti-CDK5 (J-3; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, dilution 1: 500), monoclonal mouse anti-CDK1 (Clone A17.1.1, dilution 1:500), monoclonal mouse anti-CDK2 (clone 2B6 + 8D4, dilution 1:500) (Vision-NeoMarkers, Suffolk, UK), or monoclonal mouse anti-β-actin (N350; Amersham Biosciences, dilution 1:1000). To probe for the CDK5 activator p35/p25, a polyclonal rabbit anti-p35 antibody was used, which detects both p35 and p25 (C-19, sc-821; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:300 dilution). To detect pro-caspase-3, a polyclonal rabbit anti-caspase-3/CPP32 antibody (AHZ0052; BIOSOURCE, Nivelles, Belgium, (1 μg/ml)) was used. Membrane immunoreactive proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence using an alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody and CDP-Star® as enzyme substrate (Tropix, Bedford, MA) (46Bronstein I. Voyta J.C. Murphy O.J. Bresnick L. Kricka L.J. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 748-753PubMed Google Scholar). Detection and quantification was performed on a Las-1000 phosphorimaging device (Fujifilm). The construct used to produce recombinant retroviruses was based on the 96J-G (pJim) retrovirus vector. The NotI/BglII fragment containing EGFP in 96J-G (pJim) was replaced by the NotI/BglII fragment from the pIRES2-EGFP expression vector (CLONTECH No. 6029-1) containing an internal ribosomal entry site and EGFP, resulting in a modified pJim-IRES2-EGFP vector. Cdks were cloned 5′ of the IRES2 fragment, permitting the CDK and EGFP gene to be translated from a single bicistronic mRNA (pJim-CDK-IRES2-EGFP). Briefly, Bam HI fragment of CDK5-wt from pcDNA3.1-CDK5, of dominant negative CDK5 from pCMV-CDK5-T33 (30Nikolic M. Dudek H. Kwon Y.T. Ramos Y.F. Tsai L.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), and of dn-mutants of CDK1 and CDK2 from CDK1-dn/-CDK2-dn (14van den Heuvel S. Harlow E. Science. 1993; 262: 2050-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar) were cloned into the Bam HIb site in pJim-IRES2-EGFP. Virus production was performed according to previously described procedures (47Sandal T. Ahlgren R. Lillehaug J. Døskeland S.O. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 754-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 48Motyl T. Reprod. Nutr. Dev. 1999; 39: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Infection of IPC-81 leukemic cells was performed by spin infection in which a mixture of cells and virus supernatant was centrifuged for 30 min at 300 rpm followed by incubation at 32 °C for 6–10 h and further incubation at 37 °C. Routinely, 2–4% of the cells showed fluorescence 48 h after transduction. Based on the EGFP fluorescence, positively transduced cells were isolated by flow cytometry on a MoFlow BTS cytometer (Cytomation, Colorado), a service kindly provided by the Department of Pathology, Gades Institute, Haukeland Hospital, Bergen, with excellent technical expertise from Drs. O. Tsinkalosvky and M. B. Kalvenes. Transcriptional activity is essential during the first 1–2 h of the preapoptotic period in IPC-81 cells stimulated to die by cAMP-elevating agents or by cAMP analogs such as 8-CPT-cAMP (8Lanotte M.

Sassone-Corsi P. Lanotte M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 827-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments, a commercially available rodent cDNA Atlas Array, containing 597 non-overlapping cDNA probes from different mouse genes, was used to search for mRNAs showing increased expression during this period. Cdk5 mRNA showed the highest increase in expression, along with Fos-related antigen 2 and thrombomodulin. Known proapoptotic genes such as Bax and Bag-1 (48Motyl T. Reprod. Nutr. Dev. 1999; 39: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 49Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 395-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar) did not show any increased expression (data not shown). To elucidate whether CDK5 activity was required for cAMP-induced death, IPC-81 cells were treated with 8-CPT-cAMP and various concentrations of CDK5 inhibitors for 6 h and scored for apoptosis. The structurally different CDK5 inhibitors roscovitine and butyrolactone-1 (50Meijer L. Borgne A. Mulner O. Chong J.P. Blow J.J. Inagaki N. Inagaki M. Delcros J.G. Moulinoux J.P. Eur. J.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) were both able to almost completely block apoptosis, with IC50values (IC50apo) of 7 and 8.5 μm, respectively (Fig. 1A). The inhibitors had no apparent toxic effect after 6 h of incubation (Fig. 1, A and D). After 24 h of incubation, the EC50 value for death induction was 50 and 70 μm, respectively (Fig. 1B). To examine whether the inhibitors protected the cells completely against death or only against the morphological features of apoptosis (Fig. 1F), cells were co-treated with 8-CPT-cAMP and roscovitine for 6 h and then transferred to fresh medium. Whereas cells treated with 8-CPT-cAMP alone were completely apoptotic (Fig. 1G), cells co-treated with 8-CPT-cAMP and roscovitine were viable and able to vigorously reproduce 24 h later (Fig. 1H and data not shown). A battery of CDK inhibitors was tested to establish a firmer correlation between the inhibition of CDK activity and apoptosis. These inhibitors covered a wide range of IC50 values for CDK5 inhibition, and some of them could be used to discriminate between CDK family members and GSK-3 β (see Ref. 53Leclerc S. Garnier M. Hoessel R. Marko D. Bibb J.A. Snyder G.L. Greengard P. Biernat J. Wu Y.Z. Mandelkow E.M. Eisenbrand G. Meijer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 251-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar and other references listed in Table I). All the CDK5 inhibitors tested were able to protect against cAMP-induced apoptosis with IC50apo values ranging from 0.2 μm (alsterpaullone) to 600 μm(isopentenyladenine). The IC50apo values were plotted against the IC50 values (see Table I for details) for CDK1, CDK2, and CDK5 (Fig. 2A) as well as for CDK4 and GSK-3 β (Fig. 2B). A strict proportionality was observed over a range of 4 orders of magnitude (Fig. 2A) between IC50apo and IC50for CDK5 (the calculated slope of the best fit straight line being 0.99) and slightly less for CDK2 (slope of 0.87) and CDK1 (slope of 1.14). In contrast, there was no strong correlation between IC50apo and IC50 for either CDK4 or GSK-3 β (Fig. 2B). The CDK inhibitors did not protect the cells from death induced by okadaic acid, staurosporine, or daunorubicine (Table II and data not shown). In conclusion, soluble inhibitors of CDK5, CDK2, and CDK1 were able to specifically block the cAMP- dependent cell death.Table IIC50 values of cdk inhibitors as apoptosis antagonistsCDK inhibitorIC50apoptosisIC50KinaseActivityRef.Cdk1/cyclinBCdk2/cyclinA2Cdk4Cdk5/p35GSK-3βμmμmAlsterpaullone0.20.00350.02>100.0400.00453Leclerc S.

In this study, a complete nucleotide sequence of fatty acid α-oxygenase gene in rice plants (Oryza sativa) was isolated. The deduced amino acid sequence showed some similarity with those of mammalian prostaglandin H synthases (PGHSs). The gene was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to apparently homogenous state. It showed the highest activity with linoleic acid and predominantly formed 2-hydroperoxide of the fatty acid (C n ), which is then spontaneously decarboxylated to form corresponding C n −1 aldehyde. With linoleic or linoleic acids as a substrate, rice α-oxygenase formed no product having aλ max at approximately 234 nm, which indicated that the enzyme could not oxygenize the pentadiene system in the substrate. The spectroscopic feature of the purified enzyme in its ferrous state is similar to that of mammalian PGHS, whereas that of dithionite-reduced state showed significant difference. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that His-158, Tyr-380, and Ser-558 were essential for the α-oxygenase activity. These residues are conserved in PGHS and known as a heme ligand, a source of a radical species to initiate oxygenation reaction and a residue involved in substrate binding, respectively. This finding suggested that the initial step of the oxygenation reaction in α-oxygenase has a high similarity with that of PGHS. The rice α-oxygenase activity was inhibited by imidazole but hardly inhibited by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and flurbiprofen, which are known as typical PGHS inhibitors.

Osmundsen H. Numa S. Fatty Acid Metabolism and Its Regulation. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1984: 113-154Google Scholar). The enzyme systems responsible for β-oxidation have been isolated and extensively studied. It was confirmed that the enzymes localize on the mitochondria and peroxisomes. Cytochrome P450s in the endoplasmic reticulum catalyze the fatty acid ω-hydroxylation (2Benveniste I. Tijet N. Adas F. Philipps G. Salaun J.P. Durst F. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 688-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). There are at least three types of α-oxidation systems. In mammals, α-oxidation is essential for degradation of branched-chain fatty acids with a methyl group at the β-position, which prevents the initial step of β-oxidation. This reaction is carried out by phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase, which needs 2-oxoglutarate as an essential cofactor (3Jansen G.A. Ofman R. Ferdinandusse S. Ijlst L. Muijsers A.O. Skjeldal O.H. Stokke O. Jakobs C. Besley G.T. Wraith J.E. Wanders R.J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 190-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The mutation of a gene encoding this enzyme causes Refsum's disease in human. Phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase can also act on straight-chain fatty acids; however, this activity seems to be important only in brain and nerve tissues. InSphingomonas paucimobilis, a sphingolipid-rich and 2-hydroxymyristic acid-rich bacterium, the initial reaction of α-oxidation is catalyzed by a novel type of cytochrome P450, fatty acid α-hydroxylase (4Matsunaga I. Yamada M. Kusunose E. Nishiuchi Y. Yano I. Ichihara K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 252-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Fatty acid α-hydroxylase requires hydrogen peroxide for the hydroxylation of myristic acid to produce 2-hydroxymyristic acid. In contrast, plants have a distinct type of α-oxidation system. The addition of palmitic acid to the crude homogenate prepared from Ulva pertusa led to an increased yield of the corresponding (R)-2-hydroperoxy acid (5Akakabe Y. Matsui K. Kajiwara T. Tetrahedron Lett. 1999; 40: 1137-1140Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar), which is further decarboxylated to form n-pentadecanal (Scheme FS1). The fatty acid hydroperoxides as the reaction intermediates in plant α-oxidation system were also proposed in higher plants, such as peas (Pisum sativum) leaf (6Hitchcock C. James A.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 116: 413-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), germinating peanuts (Arachis hypogaea) (7Shine W.E. Stumpf P.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 162: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), cucumbers (Cucumis sativus) (8Galliard T. Matthew J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 424: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and potatoes (Solanum tuberosum) (9Laties G.G. Hoelle C. Phytochemistry. 1967; 6: 49-57Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) as well as in marine green algae (U. pertusa). The enzyme system requires neither hydrogen peroxide nor 2-oxoglutarate, but it needs molecular oxygen to facilitate its catalytic reaction, which suggested that the enzyme involved in plant α-oxidation system is distinct from those in mammals or bacteria. Recently, a gene encoding pathogen-inducible oxygenase (PIOX)1 and its homolog have been isolated in Nicotiana tabacum and Arabidopsis thaliana (10Sanz A. Moreno J.I. Castresana C. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1523-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The protein derived from the gene was expressed in insect cells and found to cause uptake of molecular oxygen in the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic, linolenic, and arachidonic acids. Later, the protein was identified as fatty acid α-oxygenase, which catalyzes the conversion of linoleic acid and the other fatty acids into the corresponding (R)-2-hydroperoxy fatty acids (11Hamberg M. Sanz A. Castresana C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24503-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the primary structures of plant α-oxygenases show similarity with those of mammalian PGHSs, although the substrates and products of these two oxygenases are quite different from each other. So far, there has been no report on the catalytic properties of plant α-oxygenases, and no one knows whether there exists some catalytic resemblance between plant α-oxygenases and mammalian PGHSs. By a BLAST search on the rice EST data base, we noticed that one of the EST clones has high sequence similarity with tobacco PIOX. Fatty acid α-oxygenase gene of the monocotyledonous plants has never been characterized. Thus, to elucidate the reaction mechanism of α-oxidation and the function of a given amino acid residue for the reaction, the fatty acid α-oxygenase gene of rice plants (Oryza sativa) was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, and the properties of the recombinant enzyme were analyzed. Seeds of rice plants (O. sativa L. cv. Kinmaze) were sterilized with 10% sodium hypochlorite solution for 1 day and then grown hydroponically in a chamber at 28 °C under 14-h light/10-h dark photoperiod. EST clone S10043 from green shoots of rice (O. sativa L. cv. Nipponbare) was supplied by The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries DNA Bank (bank.dna.affrc.go.jp/). For the expression in E. coli, SacI site was introduced just before the initiation codon of the cDNA by PCR, and then the full-length of the open reading frame digested with SacI andXhoI was inserted into SacI-SalI site of an E. coli expression vector pQE-30 (Qiagen). The primers used for the PCR were 5′-ACGAGCTCATGGGTTCAGGACTCTTCAAGCC-3′ (the initiation codon is underlined) as the sense primer and 5′-CCATATACTGCACTCCCATCCCACC-3′ as the antisense primer. E. coli cells (strain M15) were transformed with the construct. An overnight culture (50 ml) of the transformant was inoculated into 500 ml of 2× YT medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 30 μg/ml kanamycin. The cells were grown at 37 °C until theA 600 reached 0.6–0.8. Cultures were chilled to 25 °C, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and then the cells were further cultured for 12 h at 25 °C. Bacterial cells expressing the recombinant protein were harvested and suspended in 10 ml of 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 300 mm NaCl. The cells were lysed by using five 15-s pulses of sonication with a tip-type sonicator (UR-150P, Tomy Co., Tokyo, Japan). The lysate was centrifuged at 4000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant was recentrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 60 min. The recombinant α-oxygenase was solubilized with 8 ml/g wet weight of the cells of 20 mmsodium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 300 mm NaCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (buffer A) on ice for 45 min with stirring. The suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min, and the supernatant was applied to a 1.6 × 1.5 cm TALON metal affinity column (CLONTECH Co.) preequilibrated with buffer A (pH 7.0). The column was washed with 100 ml of the buffer A at pH 7.0. Proteins were eluted from the column in buffer A at pH 5.0. The eluted fractions having O2 uptake activity were pooled and immediately adjusted at pH 7.0. Oxygen consumption was measured with a Clark-type oxygen electrode (YSI 5331, Yellow Springs Instrument) at 25 °C in 100 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.2) with 1.8 ml of the total volume. The reaction was started by the addition of the enzyme to the reaction mixture containing 0.55 mm linoleic acid and 0.002% Nonidet P-40. The activity (1 katal) was defined as the quantity of enzyme catalyzing the consumption of 1 mol of O2/sec at 25 °C. With some experiments, the aldehyde formed from the substrate was quantified with HPLC. Palmitic acid (500 nmol in total volume, 5 ml of the reaction mixture) was incubated with the enzyme for 40 min at 25 °C. The aldehyde (n-pentadecanal) formed was quantified as its hydrazone derivative as described below. In this case, the amount of aldehyde formed in 1 min was shown as the enzyme activity. Protein content was determined by the method of Bradford (12Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Reaction mixture consisting of 2 ml of linoleic acid solution (50 mm, suspended in 0.2% Nonidet P-40; final concentration, 100 μm), the enzyme solution corresponding to 0.95 μg of protein, and 100 mmHepes buffer (pH 7.2) with 1 ml of the total volume were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. Aldehydes formed during the incubation were analyzed by HPLC as their 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone derivatives. Reversed-phase HPLC analysis of the products was performed on LC-9A (Shimadzu) equipped with a Wakosil 5C8 column (4.6 mm × 250 mm) and with an SPD-6AV (Shimadzu) UV detector (detection at 350 nm). 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone derivatives were eluted by using a solvent system of acetonitrile:water:tetrahydrofuran (94:5:1, v/v) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The column temperature was 25 °C. Each hydrazone was assigned by comparing its retention time with the authentic one. Reaction mixture of 10 μl of palmitic acid solution (50 mm, suspended in 0.2% EtOH; final concentration, 500 μm), the enzyme solution corresponding to 0.95 μg of protein, and 100 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.2) with 5 ml of the total volume were incubated on ice for 15 min. The hydroperoxides formed were converted into esters with 9-anthryldiazomethane (ADAM) reagent. The detection of the resultant ADAM esters of hydroperoxides was performed with reversed-phase HPLC as described previously (5Akakabe Y. Matsui K. Kajiwara T. Tetrahedron Lett. 1999; 40: 1137-1140Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To reveal stereochemistry of 2-hydroperoxy acids, the hydroperoxy group of their ADAM esters was treated with (+)-Noe's reagent (13Noe C.R. Chem. Ber. 1982; 115: 1591-1606Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 14Noe C.R. Knollmuler M. Oberhauser B. Steinbauer G. Wagner E. Chem. Ber. 1986; 119: 729-743Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 15Knollmuler M. Noe C.R. Oberhauser B. Monatsh. Chem. 1986; 117: 407-419Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar) in the presence of catalytic amount ofp-toluenesulfonic acid in tetrahydrofuran, which resulted in the formation of peracetal derivatives of 9-anthrylmethyl,2-hydroperoxy carboxylate. HPLC of the derivatives was done as described previously (5Akakabe Y. Matsui K. Kajiwara T. Tetrahedron Lett. 1999; 40: 1137-1140Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Racemic 2-hydroperoxypalmitic acid and (R)-2-hydroperoxypalmitic acid were synthesized as described previously (16Kajiwara T. Kashibe M. Matsui K. Hatanaka A. Phytochemistry. 1991; 30: 193-195Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In vitro mutagenesis was performed by using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the following primers (the bases changed are underlined): His158-Gln sense primer (5′-ACAGTTCATGGTTCAGGACTGGATGGATCA-3′) and antisense primer (5′-TGATCCATCCAGTCCTGAACCATGAACTGT-3′); His277-Gln sense primer (5′-TTTGTTAAGGAACAGAATGCAGTTTGTGAT-3′) and antisense primer (5′-ATCACAAACTGCATTCTGTTCCTTAACAAA-3′); Tyr380-Phe sense primer (5′-TTTACCAGTGTTTTCAGAATGCACTCCCTA-3′) and antisense primer (5′-TAGGGAGTGCATTCTGAAAACACTGGTAAA-3′); His383-Gln sense primer (5′-GTTTACAGAATGCAGTCCCTAATACCAAGC-3′) and antisense primer (5′-GCTTGGTATTAGGGACTGCATTCTGTAAAC-3′); Ser558-Ala sense primer (5′-TTCATTTTAATGGCAGCAAGGAGGCTCGAA-3′) and antisense primer (5′-TCGAGCCTCCTCCTTGCTGCCATTAAAATG-3′). Mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. In rice seedlings, it has been postulated that selective inactivation of alcohol dehydrogenase is accountable to fatty acid α-oxidation activity (17Kang M.Y. Shimomura S. Fukui T. J. Biochem. 1986; 99: 549-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), although it has not been known whether the activity is the same as those found in the other plants such as cucumber and bean (8Galliard T. Matthew J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 424: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 18Saffert A. Hartmann-Schreier J. Schon A. Schreier P. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 2000; 123: 1545-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). When crude homogenate prepared from rice leaves was incubated with palmitic acid, n-pentadecanal was detected as a major product. The activity needed molecular oxygen (data not shown). Thus, it would be considered that rice leaves have the fatty-acid α-oxidation system. No activity could be found in dry rice seeds and seedlings grown until day 7; thereafter, it increased gradually and became highest at 30–35 days after germination (∼45 nmol of n-pentadecanal formed/min/g fresh weight from palmitic acid) (Fig.1). Most of the activity was found in shoots, whereas roots had low activity. Sequential centrifugation revealed that the activity could be mainly recovered in a membrane fraction; however, no distinct localization in a certain organelle could be observed. In tobacco, the oxygenation on the α-position of fatty acids was found to be carried out by a novel oxygenase named PIOX, which has a structural resemblance with mammalian PGHS (10Sanz A. Moreno J.I. Castresana C. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1523-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We found that an EST clone (S10043, the rice EST data base in MAFF DNA Bank) derived from green shoots of rice has high sequence similarity with tobacco PIOX. The clone has an insert of 2208 bp comprising 111 bp of 5′-untranslated leader sequence and 301 bp of 3′-untranslated sequence. Because a stop codon upstream of the putative initiation codon could be found in-frame, the cDNA seemed to be full-length. Kozack consensus sequence, 5′-GCCATGGG-3′ (the initiation codon is underlined) was also found in an appropriate position. The open reading frame encodes a deduced protein of 619 amino acids with a calculatedM r of 70710 and a pI of 8.87 (Fig.2 A). The deduced amino acid sequence has a high similarity with those of tobacco andArabidopsis PIOXs (63.6 and 61.2%, respectively). The rice sequence also shares sequence similarity with mammalian PGHSs, namely 25.7 and 31.6% amino acid identity with PGHS-1 of sheep (19DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1412-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) and PGHS-2 of mouse (20O'Banion M.K. Winn V.D. Young D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4888-4892Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar), respectively. Interestingly, the rice sequence also has high sequence homology with tomato Feebly gene, which is identified by transposon tagging (21van der Biezen E.A. Brandwagt B.F. van Leeuwen W. Nijkamp H.J. Hille J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 251: 267-280PubMed Google Scholar). The insertional mutagenesis of the Feebly gene in tomato produced high anthocyanin levels, developed into small fragile plants, and were insensitive to the herbicide phosphinothiricin. Sequence analysis with PSORT algorithm (psort.nibb.ac.jp/form.html) suggested that the rice sequence has no signal to direct the protein to a distinct organelle. As shown in Fig. 2 B, in a phylogenic tree of PGHS and PIOX homologs, the rice protein locates in a family of plant PIOXs but not in the family of Feebly proteins. Both the plant proteins are apparently distinct from the mammalian PGHSs. Linoleate diol synthase of the fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis, which also has the sequence similarity with a mammalian PGHS (22Hornsten L., Su, C. Osbourn A.E. Garosi P. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Oliw E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28219-28224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), locates separately in the tree. In sheep PGHS-1, His-309 is noted as one of the heme ligands. Tyr-385 is noted to form a tyrosyl radical, which initiates the PGHS reaction by abstracting the 13-pro-S hydrogen from arachidonate. They are conserved completely within the PGHS family. They were also found to be present in the rice sequence at the appropriate positions of His-277 and Tyr-380 (Fig.3). The amino acid sequences surrounding them are also conserved, particularly near the Tyr-380. Another histidine residue (His-383), which is also reported to be essential to PGHS activity (His-388 in sheep PGHS-1), can be found at the same array. In addition, His-207 (in sheep PGHS-1), which is also essential for the PGHS activities (23Shimokawa T. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6168-6173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was also conserved in the rice sequence at the position His-158. However, the amino acid residue equivalent to Ser-530 (PGHS-1), which is known as the binding site for the substrate and the target residue for many NSAIDs (24DeWitt D.L. el-Harth E.A. Kraemer S.A. Andrews M.J. Yao E.F. Armstrong R.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5192-5198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was not found at the appropriate position in the rice sequence. Although a serine residue could be found near the one conserved in mammalian PGHSs, the amino acid sequence around the residue showed low sequence similarity; therefore, this relevance seemed to have little significance. Epidermal growth factor-like domain found in PGHSs was absent in the rice α-oxygenase sequence. In the rice sequence as well as in the other plant α-oxygenase sequences, N-glycosylation site could not be found. To reveal enzymatic properties of rice α-oxygenase, the corresponding cDNA was incorporated into an E. coli expression vector, and the recombinant protein was expressed and purified to apparent homogeneity on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (cf. Fig. 7). The recombinant protein was recovered with a membrane fraction and needed to be solubilized with a detergent. The purified α-oxygenase had a specific activity of 0.162 microkatals/mg when oxygen uptake was followed with linoleic acid as a substrate. The specific activity was slightly lower than those reported for sheep PGHSs (ranging from 0.37 to 1.3 microkatals/mg) (25Lambeir A.M. Markey C.M. Dunford H.B. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14894-14896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Tsai A. Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10503-10508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of the recombinant protein was estimated to be 70,000 kDa on SDS-PAGE, which is in good accordance with that calculated from the sequence. Absorption spectrum of the purified recombinant rice α-oxygenase is shown in Fig.4. It had a Soret absorption band with a maximum at 410 nm and shoulders at 529, 563, and 628 nm. The last one is characteristic of high spin heme species. This spectrophotometric feature was comparable with PGHS, which has the Soret α/β and charge-transfer transitions at 411, 501, and 633 nm (25Lambeir A.M. Markey C.M. Dunford H.B. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14894-14896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Tsai A.L. Kulmacz R.J. Wang J.S. Wang Y. Van Wart H.E. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8554-8563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28van der Ouderaa F.J. Buytenhek M. Slikkerveer F.J. van Dorp D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 572: 29-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The molecular coefficient was 11.6 mm−1 cm−1 (410 nm). This value was somewhat lower than those reported for mammalian PGHSs (ranging from 123 to 165 mm−1 cm−1). Upon reduction of the enzyme with dithionite, only a slight change could be found at the Soret absorption band, namely theλ max blue-shifted by only 1–2 nm and the molar extinct coefficient decreased slightly. On the contrary, the α/β and charge-transfer transitions changed significantly. With the reduced form, a broad band at ∼507 nm was evident in the α/β band, and clear peaks at 636 and 661 nm appeared in the charge-transfer transitions. The spectrophotometric properties of reduced form of rice α-oxygenase was totally different from those of mammalian PGHSs having peaks of 428, 530, and 558 nm for the Soret β and α bands, respectively (28van der Ouderaa F.J. Buytenhek M. Slikkerveer F.J. van Dorp D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 572: 29-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In short, the heme coordination state of ferrous form of the rice enzyme has a close resemblance with those of mammalian PGHSs, although that of ferric state is significantly different. When the purified recombinant enzyme was reacted with linoleic acid at 25 °C, the formation of (8Z,11Z)-heptadecadienal, which is a fatty aldehyde with one methylene length shorter than the substrate, could be detected as shown in Fig.5 A. No formation of this compound could be detected when the E. coli cells harboring the expression plasmid without the insert were used instead. In algae as well as in higher plants (5Akakabe Y. Matsui K. Kajiwara T. Tetrahedron Lett. 1999; 40: 1137-1140Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar), it has been reported that a long-chain fatty aldehyde would be formed through decarboxylation of the corresponding 2-hydroperoxy fatty acid (SchemeFS1). 2-Hydroperoxy fatty acids are chemically unstable and have a half-life time of ∼30 min in an aqueous buffer at 23 °C (11Hamberg M. Sanz A. Castresana C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24503-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thus, to detect the unstable fatty acid 2-hydroperoxide, the fatty acid as a substrate was incubated with the purified enzyme on ice and the product was immediately esterified with ADAM. The resulting ADAM esters were analyzed by HPLC. When palmitic acid was incubated with the recombinant purified enzyme on ice, 2-hydroperoxide of palmitic acid was detected as a major product as shown in Fig. 5 B. To elucidate the stereochemistry of the hydroperoxy group, the ADAM ester was treated with Noe's reagent and the derivative was separated with reversed phase HPLC analysis (5Akakabe Y. Matsui K. Kajiwara T. Tetrahedron Lett. 1999; 40: 1137-1140Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 C, the stereochemistry of the hydroperoxide was revealed to be (R)-configuration in almost 100% specificity. This stereochemistry is same as that of the α-oxygenation enzyme obtained with various marine algae and tobacco plant. The recombinant enzyme per se has extremely low, if any, peroxidase activity to reduce the hydroperoxide. When palmitic acid 2-hydroperoxide was incubated with the recombinant enzyme under the presence of guaiacol, which is widely used as a co-substrate for peroxidase activity of PGHSs, a little increase in the amount of 2-hydroxide was detected. In the case of PGHSs, their peroxidase activities were intrinsically essential to complete their reaction to form prostaglandin H and also essential to make inactive ferrous form of the enzymes active through the formation of a tyrosyl radical that is needed to abstract a hydrogen atom from substrate fatty acid. Thus, the turnover rates of oxygenase pathway and peroxidase pathway are almost stoichiometrically same. In contrast, in the case of rice α-oxygenase, fatty acid 2-hydroperoxide was the major product at least under the reaction condition employed here; therefore, the rice enzyme has little need to provoke peroxidase pathway. Nonetheless, at least one catalytic turnover of the peroxidase pathway must be essential to activate the oxygenase. As the proposed mechanism of PGHS action indicated (29Goodwin D.C. Rowlinson S.W. Marnett L.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5422-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), a single peroxidase turnover to produce the tyrosine radical may be sufficient to initiate several hundred cyclooxygenase turnovers. We failed to detect hydroxide as one of the products formed by the rice enzyme, probably because extremely low number of peroxidase turnover was employed during its catalysis. Within palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, and α-linolenic acids, linoleic acid was revealed to be the best substrate for the rice α-oxygenase, although the other fatty acids also have substantial levels of reactivities, which indicated that (1Z,4Z)-pentadiene system is not the essential prerequisite to be a substrate. With linoleic acid as a substrate, there is no change in the absorbance between 210 and 350 nm including absorption at 234 nm corresponding to the formation of a conjugated diene hydroperoxy moiety during the reaction. 2T. Koeduka, K. Matsui, Y. Akakabe, and T. Kajiwara, unpublished data. This finding indicated that rice α-oxygenase could not abstract the bisallylic proton to form conjugated diene hydroperoxide but exclusively abstract α-proton. When the reaction of recombinant rice α-oxygenase was continuously followed by using an oxygen electrode, the kinetic lag phase was observed as shown in Fig. 6. This finding indicated that the native form of recombinant rice α-oxygenase is inactive and needs catalytic activation during its reaction to ensure its maximum activity. This was consistent with the proposed catalytic mechanism of PGHSs in which the ferrous form is a native inactive form (30Smith W.L. Marnett L.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1083: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). The ferrous form is oxidized by hydroperoxides to form species analogous to compound I of horseradish peroxidase, which in turn accelerates the formation of tyrosyl radical that is essential to the abstraction of the hydrogen atom of the substrate arachidonic acid (31Dietz R. Nastainczyk W. Ruf H.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). If this is also the case with the rice enzyme, the addition of hydroperoxide must abolish the lag phase of the reaction. As shown with Fig. 6, trace B, the addition of tert-butyl hydroperoxide apparently shortened the lag of the reaction of α-oxygenase; however, the maximal rate of oxygen consumption was unaffected by the addition. As noted with plant α-oxidation system (8Galliard T. Matthew J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 424: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), imidazole was a potent reversible inhibitor for the rice α-oxygenase, and the K i value was determined to be 0.046 mm (TableI). It is well known that imidazole can bind to Fe in most heme proteins (32Psylinakis E. Davoras E.M. Ioannidis N. Trikeriotis M. Petrouleas V. Ghanotakis D.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1533: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) that results in the inactivation of the function of the heme protein. On the contrary, no inhibition of ram seminal PGHS has been reported even at high imidazole levels as much as >500 mm (27Tsai A.L. Kulmacz R.J. Wang J.S. Wang Y. Van Wart H.E. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8554-8563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the addition of imidazole changed the absorption spectrum of PGHS, which indicated that imidazole could bind to the PGHS. This addition was again a big difference in the properties of rice α-oxygenase and mammalian PGHSs. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and flurbiprofen are known to be irreversible inactivators of PGHSs in vitro. Ser-530 in sheep PGHS is known to be the target of aspirin to exert its inhibitory activity through acetylation of the hydroxy group (30Smith W.L. Marnett L.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1083: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). This residue is thought to have an important role in binding the substrate of PGHS, arachidonic acid. For example, the estimatedK i value of aspirin was reported to be 14 mm with sheep PGHS, and the preincubation of the enzyme with 1 μm flurbiprofen for 1 min decreased the activity to almost 30% of the initial activity (33Kalgutkar A.S. Crews B.C. Rowlinson S.W. Marnett A.B. Kozak K.R. Remmel R.P. Marnett L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 925-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, aspirin and flurbiprofen were not potent inhibitors for rice α-oxygenase activity. This finding may suggest that the conformation of the substrate binding site of rice α-oxygenase is somewhat different from that of mammalian PGHSs.Table IInhibition of α-oxygenase activityInhibitorConcentrationActivity K Ivalue mm microkatal/mg mmControl0.161 ± 0.017—Aspirin300.165 ± 0.027na500.138 ± 0.010Flurbiprofen0.0030.154 ± 0.015na0.0090.149 ± 0.013Ibuprofen0.20.173 ± 0.002>0.500.50.151 ± 0.022Imidazole0.250.052 ± 0.0130.046Aspirin, flurbiprofen, and ibuprofen were preincubated with the purified enzyme for 15 min at 25 °C at the given concentration shown in table.

Means ± S.D. (n = 3) are shown. Through comparison of the rice α-oxygenase sequence with those of mammalian PGHSs, we found that most residues reported to be essential to the catalytic activity of PGHSs are conserved in the rice sequence. To determine whether they also function as essential residues to support the α-oxidation activity, site-directed mutageneses were carried out. The results are summarized in Fig. 7. Within the five mutated proteins, H158Q, Y380F, and S558A showed no detectable activity with either the assay following oxygen consumption or the formation of fatty aldehydes. His-158 could be the heme ligand of α-oxygenase, and the inhibition of α-oxygenase activity by imidazole indicates that the residue takes a role as one of the heme ligands. Tyr-380 and Ser-558 were also important residues for the activity. The sequences around the tyrosine residues in PGHS and α-oxygenase are highly conserved. Furthermore, hydroperoxides are the primary products of both the enzymes from which we can assume that abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the methylene moiety in the substrate is the first commitment step of the catalysis. The fact that Y380F showed no activity indicates that the tyrosine residue is essential to the oxygenase probably through formation of tyrosyl radical. It is interesting to know that Ser-558 is essential for the activity of rice α-oxygenase. As shown above, the residue could not be found at entirely the same position where the serine residue is conserved within mammalian PGHSs (Fig.3 B). Furthermore, NSAIDs, which are thought to interact to the serine residue to exert their inhibitory activities, had only a little effect on the rice α-oxygenase activity. However, the region around Ser-558 was highly conserved within plant α-oxygenases. These lines of evidence suggested that Ser-558 concomitant with the array surrounding it has an essential function to support catalytic activity of plant α-oxygenase. This study showed that rice α-oxygenase is a heme enzyme having a structural similarity with mammalian PGHSs. The heme moiety seems to be essential to the activity, because exchange of the histidine residues possibly involved in heme binding abolished the activity. The native form of the enzyme is inactive and needs to be activated by hydroperoxide probably by its own product, fatty acid 2-hydroperoxide. The activation may result in the formation of a tyrosyl radical, which in turn abstracts a hydrogen atom from the methylene unit in the substrate to support stereochemical oxygenation of the carbon. As a result, hydroperoxide group is introduced on the C2-position with (R)-configuration in a stereochemically unequivocal manner. This catalytic course of oxygenation of fatty acids is similar to that of PGHSs; thus, in this context, the catalytic mechanism proposed and widely accepted for mammalian PGHSs can be applied to the rice oxygenase. However, there still is an outstanding difference between rice oxygenase and PGHSs. PGHS is a bifunctional enzyme and can carry out both the cyclooxygenase and peroxidase activities; on the contrary, little peroxidase activity can be found with rice α-oxygenase. In the case of PGHS, tight coordination of both the activities is essential to complete its reaction to form PGH. However, both of the activities function independently because Mn3+-protoporphyrin-reconstituted PGHS, for example, lacks appreciable peroxidase activity but still exhibits functional cyclooxygenase activity. Apparently, the structure around the heme moiety, especially at the peroxidase site proposed with PGHS (31Dietz R. Nastainczyk W. Ruf H.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) must be different between rice α-oxygenase and PGHS. The fact that spectrophotometric features of the reduced form of α-oxygenase and PGHS totally different from each other might be a result of this difference in the active site. Unexpectedly, NSAIDs showed little effect on the rice α-oxygenase activity. This low effect may be caused because 1) NSAIDs could not reach the serine residue in the active site or 2) there is no serine residue in the active site. Although not complete, the conserved serine residue can be found in the plant α-oxygenases in a position near the active site serine in mammalian PGHSs. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis of Ser-558 in rice α-oxygenase resulted in an inactive enzyme. Thus, the former possibility seems to be more sensible from which we can assume that the structure of the substrate recognition site is also diverged from that of PGHS. This finding is rational, because rice α-oxygenase oxygenize only the C2position of the fatty acid and a pentadiene system occurring in polyunsaturated fatty acid is not the prerequisite for the activity. To obtain concrete evidence for the assumption depicted with this study, further extensive study is needed."

Note that “JH” or “JH diol” with no homolog designation is used in discussions relevant to all juvenile hormone homologs Juvenile hormones (compound 1; see Fig. 7) are sesquiterpenoids produced in the corpora allata of insects. They travel to target tissues through the hemolymph via a juvenile hormone (JH)1-binding protein, where they serve to modulate development, metamorphosis, and sexual maturation (1Truman J.W. Riddiford L.M. Nature. 1999; 401: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). During metamorphosis and larval development, JH titers are strictly regulated through biosynthesis and catabolism (2Feyereisen R. Kerkut G.A. Gilbert L.I. Comprehensive Insect Physiology, Biochemistry and Pharmacology. 7. Pergamon Press, Oxford1985: 391-429Google Scholar, 3De Kort C.A.D. Granger N.A. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1996; 33: 1-26Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). JH esterase (JHE) and JH epoxide hydrolase are regarded as the enzymes responsible for JH catabolism. However, recent studies have identified a hormonal role for JH acid (compound 2; see Fig. 7) (4Ismail S.M. Satyanarayana K. Bradfield J.Y. Dahm K.H. Bhaskaran G. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1998; 37: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 5Ismail S.M. Goin C. Muthumani K. Kim M. Dahm K.H. Bhaskaran G. J. Insect Physiol. 2000; 46: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), suggesting that JHE is more than an inactivating enzyme. Recently, a cytochrome P450 terpenoid hydroxylase was discovered in the corpora allata of Diploptera punctata; this enzyme may play a role in the temporal suppression of JH titer in the cockroach by metabolizing JH III to 12-hydroxy-JH III (6Sutherland T.D.

A. 1998; 95: 12884-12889Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Most identifications of JH metabolites in the past have involved studies using either hemolymph or whole organisms, making it difficult to distinguish the role of intracellular JH metabolism. Two studies have been conducted using Manduca sexta tissues dissected and maintained in vitro, one with Malpighian tubules (7Grieneisen M.L. Kieckbusch T.D. Dorman G. Latli B. Prestwich G.D. Schooley D.A. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1995; 30: 255-270Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and the other with fat body and imaginal discs (8Hammock B.D. Nowock J. Goodman W. Stamoudis C. Gilbert L.I. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1975; 3: 167-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The classic model for JH metabolism in insects consists of two primary pathways of inactivation: epoxide hydrolysis to form the diol metabolites and ester cleavage to form the acid metabolites. However, there have been many reports indicating very polar JH metabolites (9Slade M. Zibitt C.H. Menn J.J. Beroza M. Insect Juvenile Hormones: Chemistry and Action.

We identified and characterized JH diol phosphate (JHDP; compound 11; Fig.1), one such polar metabolite, and suggested that it is the principal end product of JH I metabolism inM. sexta (11Halarnkar P.P. Jackson G.P. Straub K.M. Schooley D.A. Experientia (Basel). 1993; 49: 988-994Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We isolated and characterized JH diol kinase (JHDK) from the Malpighian tubules of day 1 fifth instar larvae of M. sexta. The purified cytosolic enzyme was investigated for its biochemical and kinetic properties. The phosphate acceptors JH I, II, and III diols and the phosphate donor MgATP were kinetically characterized. JHDK is active as a homodimer, with no evidence for an active monomer under our testing conditions. Ampholytes were obtained from Bio-Rad. Methyl geranoate diol was obtained from acidic hydration of methyl epoxygeranoate, which was from a prior synthesis (16Bergot B.J. Ratcliff M. Schooley D.A. J. Chromatogr. 1981; 204: 231-244Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Methyl 14,15-epoxygeranylgeranoate was a generous gift from Dr. Stephanie Sen (Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis, IN). 3-Octylthio-1,1,1-trifluoro-2-propanone (OTFP) was a generous gift from Dr. Bruce D. Hammock (University of California, Davis, CA). FSBA, aprotinin, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin, and high-grade (NH4)2SO4 were purchased from Sigma. (10R,11R)-[10-3H]JH I diol (compound 6; Fig. 1) and II diol (compound 4), (10R)-[10-3H]JH III diol (compound5), (10S,11S)-[10-3H]JH diol (compound 3), and racemic [10-3H]JH ethyl ester diol (compound 7) were previously synthesized in this laboratory (17Maxwell R.A. Anderson R.J. Schooley D.A. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 305: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Enantiomerically pure, unlabeled JH diol was prepared from racemic JH using methods described previously (17Maxwell R.A. Anderson R.J. Schooley D.A. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 305: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The specific activity and purity of each JH diol were determined by mass spectrometry (Finnigan MAT SSQ 710) using electron impact ionization (70 eV). The samples were analyzed using a solid probe with a stepwise temperature gradient (from 35 to 150 °C at 115 °C/min and then from 150 to 250 °C at 100 °C/min). Incubating [10-3H]JH diol (compound 3) with esterase fromTenebrio molitor pupal hemolymph yields [10-3H]JH acid diol (JHAD; compound 8) (18Grieneisen M.L. Mok A. Kieckbusch T.D. Schooley D.A. Insect. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 27: 365-376Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We prepared [10-3H]JHAD phosphate (JHADP) by incubating [10-3H]JHDP (compound 11; enzymatically prepared using purified JHDK) with JHE from T. molitor pupal hemolymph. The M. sexta colony was reared essentially as described (19Yamamoto R.T. J. Econ. Entomol. 1969; 62: 1427-1431Crossref Google Scholar). All manipulations and purifications were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise noted. All buffers were stirred overnight at 4 °C with Chelex 100 (Bio-Rad, minus 400 mesh, sodium form) and filtered through a 0.2-μm membrane. The ascending, descending, and convoluted sections of Malpighian tubules from day 1 fifth instar M. sexta larvae were carefully dissected in ice-cold 0.1 m HEPES (pH 7.0). The tubules, free of fat body and tracheae, were immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at –80 °C. Malpighian tubules from 300 animals were homogenized in 40 ml of ice-cold 10% sucrose. The crude homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 45 min at 2 °C, and the supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 2 °C. Aprotinin (5.0 μg/ml), 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (0.1 mg/ml), pepstatin (5.0 μg/ml), pH 5–8 ampholytes (0.85 ml), and pH 3–10 ampholytes (0.25 ml) were added to the 100,000 × g supernatant; the volume was brought to 55 ml with ice-cold 10% sucrose containing 0.1% mercaptoethanol. The solution was focused with a Bio-Rad Rotofor run at constant power (12 watts) for 5–6 h. After measuring the hydrogen ion concentration, 20 fractions were individually assayed for JHDK activity using (10S,11S)-[10-3H]JH diol (compound3; I, II, and III individually) and (10R,11R)-[10-3H]JH I diol (compound 6; see Fig. 2). The fractions defining the active zone were combined and dialyzed (36–48 h) against 4.0 liters of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% sucrose, and 0.1% mercaptoethanol using 10,000-Da cutoff tubing (Pierce) that had been pretreated with bovine serum albumin (rinsed several times with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and then thoroughly rinsed with water to remove unbound bovine serum albumin). The entire dialysate from Step 2 was applied to a strong anion-exchange column (Polymer Labs PL-SAX, 50 × 4.6 mm, 8 μm, 1000 Å) equilibrated with buffer A (0.02 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% sucrose, and 0.1% mercaptoethanol). The column was eluted at 4 °C with a PerkinElmer Instruments HPLC (series 410BIO with a PerkinElmer Instruments LC235 diode array detector) using a slow gradient from 0 to 30% buffer B (2.0 m NaCl in buffer A) over 2 h at 1 ml/min and from 30 to 100% buffer B over 10 min. 2.0-ml fractions were collected and assayed for JHDK activity. JHDK active fractions from Step 3 were combined and carefully diluted with concentrated ice-cold buffer C (4.0 m(NH4)2SO4, 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), and 10% sucrose) to a final concentration of 2.0m (NH4)2SO4. HIC was carried out using the aforementioned PerkinElmer Instruments HPLC equipped with a phenyl column (slurry packed at 850 p.s.i., TSKgel 5PW, 4.6 × 75.0 mm, 20 μm). The column was equilibrated with buffer D (2.0 m(NH4)2SO4, 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), and 10% sucrose) for several hours prior to loading. Elution of JHDK was accomplished using a two-step gradient from 0 to 100% buffer E (buffer D without 2.0m (NH4)2SO4) over 40 min at 0.4 ml/min and from 100% buffer E to 50% solvent A (50% propanol/H2O) over 10 min. 0.8-ml fractions were collected and assayed for JHDK activity. JHDK active fractions from Step 4 were combined and dialyzed as described for Step 2. WAX chromatography was performed using a Hamilton X-300 column (diethylaminopropyl, 2.1 × 150 mm) under the conditions described for Step 3 (SAX chromatography), but without mercaptoethanol. 1.0-ml fractions were collected and assayed for JHDK activity. This material was used for characterization unless otherwise indicated. Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was added to JHDK active fractions from Step 5 to a final concentration of 0.2%. The fractions were loaded onto a Polymer Labs PLRP-S RPLC column (0.5 × 150 mm, 8 μm, 300 Å, Michrom BioResources, Auburn, CA) eluted at 20 μl/min. The column was set at 50 °C, and a gradient of 2–90% acetonitrile, water, and 0.1% TFA in 80 min was used with a Michrom HPLC (Model UMA chromatograph with UV detector set at 280 nm). JHDK eluted at 27 min (see Fig. 3) in a high state of purity. Our standard activity assay was developed from a basic partition assay (7Grieneisen M.L. Kieckbusch T.D. Dorman G. Latli B. Prestwich G.D. Schooley D.A. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1995; 30: 255-270Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It consists of the following steps. 1) The JHE inhibitor OTFP (30 μl of 10 μm solution in pentane) was added to glass tubes (10 × 50 mm) and allowed to air-dry. 2) The incubation buffer (0.15 m Tris (pH 8.0), 10% sucrose, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 mm His) and JHDK were added, and the sample was incubated for 30 min at 25 °C (OTFP was used only when the presence of JHE was a concern). 3) 4 mmATP, 6 mm MgCl2 and ≈1.5 pmol of the appropriate [10-3H]JH diol (the latter dissolved in 5 μl of ethanol) (5 μl) were added for a final aqueous volume of 300 μl. 4) After 1 h at 25 °C, the phosphorylation reaction was terminated by adding 300 μl of ethyl acetate and vortexing three times for 5 s each. 5) After 5 min, the tubes were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, and 100 μl of each phase was removed with an adjustable micropipette using gel-loading tips. The aliquots were transferred to scintillation vials containing 2 ml of Ecolume (ICN) and radioassayed on a Beckman LS1701 for 2 min each. The partition coefficient for [10-3H]JH diol was >99%, and disintegrations/min for each phase of a given partition assay were corrected for the partition coefficient and background counts. The procedure to quantify the JHAD metabolite produced was that used for the phosphotransferase assay, except that 20 μl of 17.5m acetic acid was added prior to addition of ethyl acetate. After centrifugation, an aliquot from each phase was dried down, redissolved in MeOH, and analyzed by TLC on silica gel GF (Analtech); the plate was developed with chloroform/ethanol (9:1). The radioactive profile was visualized (BioScan System 200 imaging scanner) and compared with known standards of JH metabolites. Purified JHDK was loaded onto a ZIP-tip, eluted with CH3CN, and analyzed by mass spectrometry (Bruker Biflex III) using an external standard. Amino acid analysis was performed using purified JHDK treated with dithiodipropionic acid (to convert Cys residues to a more stable form) (20Strydom D.J. Cohen S.A. Angeletti R.H. Techniques in Protein Chemistry. IV. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1993: 299-306Google Scholar) and hydrolyzed to amino acids using 5.7 m HCl and 1% phenol at 110 °C for 20 h. Amino acids were analyzed as 6-aminoquinoline carbamate derivatives (21Cohen S.A. Michaud D.P. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 211: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar) using a Hewlett-Packard 1090 chromatograph with a Hewlett-Packard 1046A fluorescence detector and compared with an external standard. Protein was determined by the BCA protein assay method (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard (22Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K.

Sephadex G-100 column (5 × 76 cm) was equilibrated with buffer containing 0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 10% sucrose. 2.5-ml fractions were collected at a flow rate of 20 ml/h (see Fig.4). Phosphotransferase activity was measured using one of two procedures. Assay 1 measured the conversion of [10-3H]JH diol (compound 3) to [10-3H]JHDP (compound11) and was similar to the standard assay described above. The reaction mixture contained the standard incubation buffer and variable concentrations of [10-3H]JH diol and nucleotide phosphate with 6 mm MgCl2 in a final volume of 300 μl. The reaction was started by addition of enzyme and was carried out at room temperature (23 ± 2 °C). The reaction was stopped by vortexing with ethyl acetate as described above. The amount of enzyme used in the assays was such that <15% of the substrate was converted to product during the reaction. All samples were taken within the linear part of the reaction, and initial velocities were determined from the slope of the lines. Assay 2 measured the enzymatic conversion of [2,8-3H]ATP (20 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals) to [2,8-3H]ADP. The reaction mixture contained the standard incubation buffer, 300 μm ATP (added to 1 μCi of [2,8-3H]ATP), 5 μm JH diol, and 6 mm MgCl2 in a final volume of 300 μl. The reaction was started by addition of enzyme and performed at room temperature. Rapid freezing (liquid N2) stopped the reaction. Samples were stored at –80 °C and thawed individually for chromatographic analysis. Samples were analyzed using a SAX column (SynchroPak AX 300, 100 × 4.6 mm, 8 μm, 1000 Å, SynChrom, Inc.) equilibrated with 0.02 mNH4+ phosphate (pH 3.8). The column was eluted with a PerkinElmer Instruments HPLC (described above) using a gradient of 0–100% 2.0 mNH4+ phosphate over 40 min with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. An identical blank gradient was run to clean the column between analyses. 1.0-ml fractions were collected and radioassayed. Control experiments included no addition of enzyme to monitor the time- and condition-dependent hydrolysis of [2,8-3H]ATP. The reaction rate was monitored by substituting [3H]JH diol for [2,8-3H]ATP and performing Assay 1. All assays involving kinetic or product quantification were done in triplicate unless stated otherwise. (10S,11S)-[3H]JH III acid diol (compound 8) was enzymatically synthesized from [3H]JH III diol (compound 5) by the method of Share and Roe (23Share M.R. Roe M.R. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 169: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and purified by TLC as described above. JH III diol phosphate was enzymatically synthesized with purified JHDK using labeled and unlabeled (10S)-JH III diol and the standard assay conditions described above. Unreacted JH diol was removed by partitioning with ethyl acetate. JHDP was checked for purity by RPLC as described elsewhere (7Grieneisen M.L. Kieckbusch T.D. Dorman G. Latli B. Prestwich G.D. Schooley D.A. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1995; 30: 255-270Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). (10S)-[3H]JH III acid diol phosphate was enzymatically synthesized by incubation of (10S)-[3H]JH III diol phosphate with JHE fromT. molitor pupal hemolymph using the standard assay conditions described above (minus MgATP and OTFP). The ratio of crude hemolymph to incubation medium was 1:100. JHADP was checked for purity by RPLC (7Grieneisen M.L. Kieckbusch T.D. Dorman G. Latli B. Prestwich G.D. Schooley D.A. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1995; 30: 255-270Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and TLC (described above). The kinetic constants Km and Vmax were obtained using steady-state kinetic data and hyperbolic nonlinear regression with the program PRISM Version 2.0 for Macintosh (GraphPAD Software). Ratios of free Mg2+and bound MgATP were calculated using the program BAD for PC. A summary of the purification of JHDK is presented in Table I. Protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay unless stated otherwise (see “Experimental Procedures”). The total enzyme activity fluctuated, whereas the specific activity steadily increased during purification. Enzyme from the cytosolic fraction of day 1 fifth instar larval Malpighian tubules was subjected to isoelectric focusing (IEF). Fractions were assayed with and without MgATP to distinguish JHDK activity from JHE activity. Three zones of activity were observed for JHE ranging from pH 4.0 to 4.5, 4.8 to 5.6, and 5.8 to 6.2. However, only one zone of activity was observed for JHDK (pI between 4.0 and 5.1) (Fig. 2). The JHDK active fractions were then purified by SAX and WAX chromatography and HIC as described above. JHDK eluted from the SAX column in one active zone between 230 and 250 mm NaCl (data not shown). A slow gradient was employed to separate early eluting contaminants (possibly phospholipids). JHDK eluted from the HIC column in one active zone between 0.05 and 0.0 m(NH4)2SO4 (data not shown). In some batches, elution often continued into the start of the alcohol gradient. JHDK eluted from the WAX column in one active zone between 440 and 460 mm NaCl, with one symmetrical peak corresponding to the active zone at 280 nm, a peak that was quite well resolved from impurities (data not shown). JHDK eluted from the RPLC column in one symmetrical peak at 59% CH3CN. No other peaks were detected during the RPLC step (Fig.3).Table ISummary of the purification of JHDKPurification stepVolumeTotal activity1-aOne unit of activity = 1 pmol of phosphate transferred per min to JH diol under standard assay conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Apparent increases in total activity may be due to removal of cofactors.ProteinSpecific activityPurificationmlunitsmgunits/mg-foldCrude extract501509250.16110,000 × gspin1-bSoluble fraction.401723260.533.3100,000 × gspin1-bSoluble fraction.402002030.996.1IEF1226032.77.9549Dialysis1032513.025154SAX8290ND1-cND, not determined; too dilute.NDNDHIC10160NDNDNDDialysis9205NDNDNDWAX (pure)1-dAs determined by RPLC, mass spectrometry, and AAA analysis.42400.00096250,0001,560,0001-a One unit of activity = 1 pmol of phosphate transferred per min to JH diol under standard assay conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Apparent increases in total activity may be due to removal of cofactors.1-b Soluble fraction.1-c ND, not determined; too dilute.1-d As determined by RPLC, mass spectrometry, and AAA analysis. Open table in a new tab After each purification procedure (IEF, SAX, HIC, and WAX), fractions were assayed individually with JH I, II, and III diols, and identical zones of enzymatic activity were observed using each substrate (data not shown). Taken together, these findings suggest that, in this tissue and stage of M. sexta, only one cytosolic enzyme is responsible for the production of each JHDP. The purification procedure yielded a homogeneous protein preparation as evidenced by RPLC (Fig.3). The single peak in Fig. 3 contained 0.71 μg of JHDK and represented 70% of the total protein purified by WAX chromatography. The molecular mass of the subunit was determined to be 20,013 Da by mass spectrometry using a Bruker Biflex III (data not shown). The active molecular mass was 42 kDa as estimated by gel filtration (Fig.4), suggesting that the enzyme was a homodimer under the conditions employed (see “Experimental Procedures”). JHDK purified as described above was subjected to amino acid analysis. AAA analysis was performed several times during JHDK characterizations, with good correlation of data in each instance. The analysis predicted a protein with only 1 cysteine. The numbers of residues/mol were averaged from three separate AAA analyses and are as follows: Ala, 19; Asx, 26; Arg, 4; Cys, 1; Glx, 20; Gly, 14; His, 2; Ile, 8; Leu, 11; Lys, 16; Met, 3; Phe, 16; Pro, 3; Ser, 20; Thr, 6; Tyr, 5; and Val, 9. The total average residue weight was calculated to be 19.6 kDa, which correlates well with 20 kDa (determined by mass spectral analysis) considering that Trp is destroyed in the hydrolysis. In the presence of 10% (w/v) sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 0.1% mercaptoethanol, low concentrations (5 nm) of purified JHDK were stable for 1 month at 2 °C. An ∼50% reduction in activity occurred over the following month. During purification, we observed that JHDK was very prone to metal poisoning, which could be reversed by incubation with EDTA. As a precaution, all buffers were passed through a Chelex column (see “Experimental Procedures”). JHDK showed a broad pH optimum centered around pH 8. 50% activity remained at pH 6.0, and 90% activity remained at pH 9.0. Temperatures of 10, 22, and 30 °C were assessed with saturating concentrations of MgATP. No difference in activity was observed between 22 and 30 °C, but a 20% reduction in activity occurred at 10 °C (data not shown). Kinetic assays were performed at room temperature (22–23 °C). Previous studies with JHDK indicated that Mg2+ and ATP are required for activity (7Grieneisen M.L. Kieckbusch T.D. Dorman G. Latli B. Prestwich G.D. Schooley D.A. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1995; 30: 255-270Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This observation was reconfirmed by preincubating the enzyme with 5 mm EDTA and 2 mm EGTA and performing the standard activity assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). Measuring and plotting v versus[Mg2+] while holding ATP and JH diol concentrations constant indicated that free Mg2+ was inhibitory, with an approximate IC50of 560 μm (Fig. 5). Thus, kinetic values for JHDK were determined using a [Mg2+] that would always yield 140 μm free Mg2+. Taken together, these results suggest that MgATP is the true substrate. Various concentrations of Ca2+ were tested and found to cause concentration-dependent inhibition (Table II). JHDK was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 5 mm EDTA and EGTA and then dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) and 10% sucrose. The dialyzed JHDK was preincubated for 30 min with and without Ca2+ prior to initiating the JHDK reaction (Table II). The inhibitory effect of Ca2+ was identical with and without Ca2+ preincubation. Given the assay concentrations of Mg2+ and ATP versus Ca2+, it is possible that Ca2+ competes for ATP and that CaATP is not a suitable substrate. To investigate the role of Ca2+ as an activator, JHDK was incubated at 4 °C overnight with EDTA and EGTA as described above, except that the chelators were not removed prior to the activity assay. The JHDK reaction was initiated with sufficient Mg2+ and ATP to yield 1 mm free Mg2+ and MgATP. No change in activity was observed compared with control samples that did not contain chelators, suggesting that Ca2+ is not required for activity.Table IIEffect of various compounds on JHDK activityEffectors2-aUnless mentioned otherwise, effectors were added to the assay mixture along with the substrates to obtain the concentrations indicated.Activity2-bAssays were performed in triplicate, and average values are reported.Control2-cConditions and concentrations used were those of the standard activity assay (see “Experimental Procedures”).Control2-dConditions followed the standard activity assay, except for the following modifications: 1 mm ATP and 0.5 mm MgCl2.%Control100100Alternate nucleotide2-eATP was replaced with an equivalent amount of one of these nucleotides.ADP, AMP, CTP, CDP, CMP0GDP, GMP, UTP, UDP, UMP0GTP15.5PAPS14.7Other compounds2-fCompounds were preincubated (30 min) with enzyme prior to addition of substrates and MgCl2.ICH2CONH2 (3, 6, 12 mm)79HS(CH2)2OH (0.1, 1%)100, 93OTFP (100 μm)75EGTA (50 μm)100CaCl2 (25, 50, 250 μm)98, 83, 66KCl (50, 100, 200 μm)100Tween (0.01%)52Triton X-100 (0.1%)222-a Unless mentioned otherwise, effectors were added to the assay mixture along with the substrates to obtain the concentrations indicated.2-b Assays were performed in triplicate, and average values are reported.2-c Conditions and concentrations used were those of the standard activity assay (see “Experimental Procedures”).2-d Conditions followed the standard activity assay, except for the following modifications: 1 mm ATP and 0.5 mm MgCl2.2-e ATP was replaced with an equivalent amount of one of these nucleotides.2-f Compounds were preincubated (30 min) with enzyme prior to addition of substrates and MgCl2. Open table in a new tab Experiments with JHDK indicated that only ATP, GTP, and PAPS could serve as substrates, with ATP being the preferred phosphate donor (Table II). However, ATP is a precursor for commercially prepared PAPS, and obtaining PAPS free of contaminating ATP has proven to be difficult. In fact, GDP initially showed phosphate donor properties until it was purified from contaminating GTP. The ATP analog FSBA was found to be inhibitory, and ATP conferred protection (Table II). Lepidoptera have the ability to synthesize ethyl-branched JH I, JH II, JH 0, and 4-methyl-JH I (24Schooley D.A. Baker F.C. Tsai L.W. Miller C.A. Jamieson G.C. Hoffmann J.A. Porchet M.

Nuclear inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1 (NIPP1) 1The abbreviations used are: NIPP1nuclear inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1PP1protein phosphatase-1FHAforkhead-associatedsnRNPsmall nuclear ribonucleoprotein is one of four ancient regulators of protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) and is ubiquitously expressed in multicellular eukaryotes (1Ceulemans H. Stalmans W. Bollen M. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 371-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In vitro, NIPP1 acts as an inhibitor of PP1 toward a variety of substrates, but the inhibitory potency is controlled by multisite phosphorylation and by the binding of RNA (2Vulsteke V. Beullens M.

Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). NIPP1 is targeted to nuclear storage sites for splicing factors, known as speckles or splicing factor compartments (4Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Ajuh P. Prescott A. Claverie-Martin F. Cohen S. Lamond A.I. Cohen P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 157-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Jagiello I. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Beullens M. Boudrez A. Keppens S. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3761-3768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The association of NIPP1 with the speckles is mediated by its forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, which specifically interacts with phosphorylated forms of the essential splicing factors CDC5L (6Boudrez A. Beullens M. Groenen P. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Jagiello I. Murray M. Krainer A.R. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol.

Bollen, unpublished observations. Because CDC5L and SAP155 are also in vitro substrates for PP1, it has been speculated that NIPP1 may target these splicing factors for dephosphorylation by associated PP1. Such a function for PP1 is potentially important because toxins that inhibit protein serine/threonine phosphatases, including PP1, inhibit pre-mRNA splicing (7Mermoud J.E. Cohen P. Lamond A.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5263-5269Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). nuclear inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1 protein phosphatase-1 forkhead-associated small nuclear ribonucleoprotein Pre-mRNA splicing is catalyzed by spliceosomes, consisting of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles, i.e. the U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 snRNPs and a large number of non-snRNP-associated splicing factors (8Hastings M.L. Krainer A.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Spliceosome assembly involves the ordered recruitment of snRNPs and splicing factors as well as multiple rearrangements between spliceosomal components. The first step is the ATP-independent formation of the E-complex and includes the binding of the U1 snRNA to the 5′-splice site and of non-snRNP splicing factors to the polypyrimidine tract and the 3′-splice site. The U2 snRNP first binds loosely to the pre-mRNA in the E-complex, but during the transition to the A-complex, this snRNP is firmly bound to the intronic branch-point sequence in an ATP-dependent manner. The tight association of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP results in the formation of the B-complex, which is converted to the catalytically active C-complex by intraspliceosomal rearrangements. These rearrangements include the expulsion of the U1 and U4 snRNPs and the base pairing of the U2 and U6 snRNAs. NIPP1 is tightly associated with splicing factors in the speckles (4Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Ajuh P. Prescott A. Claverie-Martin F. Cohen S. Lamond A.I. Cohen P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 157-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,5Jagiello I. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Beullens M. Boudrez A. Keppens S. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3761-3768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but it has not yet been investigated whether NIPP1 is also a component of the spliceosomes and contributes to the control of pre-mRNA splicing. We report here that NIPP1 is indeed recruited to the spliceosomes in HeLa cell nuclear extracts and has an essential role in a late step of spliceosome assembly. Unexpectedly, this function of NIPP1 appears to be unrelated to its ability to regulate PP1. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against synthetic peptides of Xenopus laevis SAP155 (109KIANREDEYKQQRRKMI125), human CDC5L (788YADLLLEKETLKSKF802), and human NIPP1 (341PGKKPTPSLLI351) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin were affinity-purified on the bovine serum albumin-coupled peptides linked to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). HeLa cell nuclear extracts were obtained from the Computer Cell Culture Center. Okadaic acid and microcystin LR were purchased from Calbiochem and Protein A-TSK-Sepharose™ was obtained from Affiland. Phosphorylase b was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle and was phosphorylated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP by purified phosphorylase kinase (9Jagiello I. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17257-17263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Polyhistidine-tagged NIPP1 fragments and NIPP1 mutants were prepared as described previously (3Beullens M. Vulsteke V. Van Eynde A. Jagiello I. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 6Boudrez A. Beullens M. Groenen P. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Jagiello I. Murray M. Krainer A.R. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol.

Inhibitor-2 was purified by chromatography on blue Sepharose of heat-treated lysates of BL21(DE3) cells that had been transformed with the pET8d-inhibitor 2 plasmid (10Park I.-K. Roach P. Bonder J. Fox S.P. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 944-954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A capped β-globin pre-mRNA fragment, comprising exon 1 through the BamHI site in exon 2, was synthesized in the presence of [α-32P]GTP. This primary transcript was used as a substrate for splicing in HeLa cell nuclear extracts (11Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 118: 315-321PubMed Google Scholar). The splicing mixture contained (final concentrations) nuclear extract (20%), 20 fmol of pre-mRNA (in 15 μl of assay mixture), 0.5 mm ATP, 20 mm creatine phosphate, 3.2 mm MgCl2, 32 mm Hepes, 60 mm KCl, 0.12 mm EDTA, 12% glycerol, 0.6 mm dithiothreitol, and 2.6% polyvinyl alcohol. The splicing products were separated by denaturing PAGE (9%) and visualized by autoradiography. Immunoprecipitations during the splicing reactions were done as described by Murray et al. (12Murray M.V. Kobayashi R. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), except that (de)phosphorylation reactions during the immunoprecipitation were prevented by the addition of 8 mm EDTA and 1 μm microcystin. After the last wash step the32P in the pellet was determined (Fig. 1A), and the pelleted RNA was phenol-extracted and subjected to denaturing PAGE (Fig. 1B). At the indicated times during splicing of β-globin pre-mRNA in HeLa cell nuclear extracts, aliquots were diluted 1.4-fold by the addition of heparin (1 mg/ml finally) and glycerol (10% finally) and stored on ice. After the experiment, the samples were loaded on a native, composite gel that contained 3.5% polyacrylamide, 0.5% agarose, 10% glycerol, 3 mm Tris-base, 25 mm boric acid, and 0.3 mm EDTA. The running buffer contained 3 mmTris-base, 25 mm boric acid, and 0.3 mm EDTA. The gels (8 × 7.5 × 0.075 cm) were prerun for 60 min at 60 V and run for 3 h at 175 V with cooling. The phosphorylase phosphatase activities were determined as described before (9Jagiello I. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17257-17263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) except that the liberated 32Pi was extracted as a phosphomolybdate complex in isobutanol/toluol (13Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 93: 145-155Google Scholar). These assays were done in identical conditions as the splicing assays (see above) except that phosphorylase a was added to the splicing extracts instead of β-globin pre-mRNA. To determine whether NIPP1 is physically associated with the spliceosomes, we performed immunoprecipitations from in vitro splicing reactions at various times after the addition of 32P-labeled β-globin pre-mRNA. The fraction of labeled RNA that was precipitated by the NIPP1 antibodies changed with time but was maximal at 20 min when it amounted to about 4% of the total input (Fig. 1A). Immunoprecipitation of the established splicing factors SAP155 (Fig. 1A) and CDC5L (not shown) at this time point resulted in the co-precipitation of 10 and 1% of the added RNA, respectively. Importantly, only very low levels of RNA were precipitated when no primary antibodies were added (Fig. 1A). Also, very little RNA was precipitated with the NIPP1 antibodies when spliceosome assembly was blocked at the transition between the E-complex and the A-complex by the omission of ATP (0 min in Fig. 1A). This finding strongly suggested that NIPP1 did not bind directly to the β-globin pre-mRNA and that NIPP1 was recruited by the A-complex at the earliest. By contrast, the SAP155 antibodies already co-precipitated a considerable fraction of the RNA before the addition of ATP. This finding is in accordance with the report that the U2 snRNP, which includes SAP155, is first recruited by the E-complex (14Das R. Zhou Z. Reed R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 779-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To further explore the specificity of interaction of NIPP1 with the spliceosomes, we have examined how the addition of recombinant NIPP1 or its splicing factor binding FHA domain (residues 1–142) interfered with the precipitation of RNA by NIPP1 or SAP155 antibodies (Fig. 1A). The amount of RNA that co-immunoprecipitated with NIPP1 was doubled by the addition of 10 μm recombinant NIPP1, indicating that not all spliceosomal binding sites had been occupied by the endogenous NIPP1. On the other hand, the addition of 10 μm FHA domain of NIPP1 nearly completely abolished the co-precipitation of full-length NIPP1 and RNA. This effect was not detected (not shown) with an FHA domain that was mutated (S68A, R69A, V70A, H71A) in its phosphate-binding loop (6Boudrez A. Beullens M. Groenen P. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Jagiello I. Murray M. Krainer A.R. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25411-25417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Because this mutation also abolished the ability of the FHA domain to interact with phosphorylated CDC5L (6Boudrez A. Beullens M. Groenen P. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Jagiello I. Murray M. Krainer A.R. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25411-25417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and SAP155, 2A. Boudrez, M. Beullens, S. Keppens, E. Waelkens, W. Stalmans, and M. Bollen, unpublished observations. these data suggested that the FHA domain of NIPP1 can compete with the endogenous NIPP1 for binding to the spliceosomes via phosphorylated modules. Unexpectedly, the FHA domain also decreased the recruitment of SAP155 to the spliceosomes, in particular after the addition of ATP (Fig. 1A). Because SAP155 and the FHA domain of NIPP1 can directly interact with each other,2 this result can possibly be explained by depletion of the pool of SAP155 that is available for uptake in the spliceosomes. An alternative explanation is that full-length NIPP1 is required for keeping SAP155 tightly associated with the spliceosomes (see “Discussion”). We have further analyzed the RNA that co-immunoprecipitated with NIPP1 and SAP155 by denaturing PAGE (Fig. 1B). After an incubation for 80 min under splicing conditions, immunoprecipitation of either of these proteins resulted in a co-precipitation of pre-mRNA, splicing intermediates (exon 1, lariat-exon 2) as well as splicing products (mRNA, lariat), which is further proof of the association of these proteins with functional spliceosomes. Fig. 1B also shows that the addition of a large excess of NIPP1 did not affect the splicing of β-globin pre-mRNA, while the addition of the FHA domain blocked splicing completely. Because the FHA domain (NIPP1-(1–142)) competed with the endogenous NIPP1 for binding to the spliceosomes (Fig. 1A) and also blocked in vitro splicing (Fig. 1B), this suggested that the C-terminal two-thirds of NIPP1 were required for in vitro splicing. To further delineate the essential fragment, we have tested the effects of various NIPP1 mutants on β-globin pre-mRNA splicing (Fig. 2). These experiments revealed that a much larger fragment of NIPP1 (NIPP1-(1–224)) also behaved as a dominant negative mutant and blocked splicing completely. The splicing inhibition by both NIPP1-(1–142) and NIPP1-(1–224) was lost by mutation of the phosphate-binding loop in the FHA domain, indicating that the effects of these NIPP1 fragments were dependent on the presence of a functional FHA domain. Accordingly, NIPP1 fragments (NIPP1-(143–351) and NIPP1-(143–224)) that lacked the FHA domain had no effect on pre-mRNA splicing. Collectively, the previous data indicated that NIPP1 is an essential spliceosomal component and that both the FHA domain (residues 1–142) and the C-terminal third (residues 225–351) of NIPP1 are required for its function in pre-mRNA splicing in nuclear extracts. The last 22 residues of NIPP1 constitute a binding site for both RNA (15Jin Q. Beullens M. Jagiello I. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 13-19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and PP1 (3Beullens M. Vulsteke V. Van Eynde A. Jagiello I. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, a mutant that lacked these residues was not inhibitory for splicing (Fig. 2), which confined the C-terminal fragment of NIPP1 that is essential for splicing to residues 225–329. Also, full-length NIPP1 (not shown) or NIPP1-(1–329) (Fig. 2) did not become inhibitory to splicing after mutation (V201A, F203A) of a PP1-binding motif in the central domain of NIPP1. On the other hand, the latter mutant, like the FHA domain (Fig. 1A), inhibited the co-precipitation of wild type NIPP1 and RNA (not shown). Because the V201A + F203A mutant of NIPP1-(1–329) can bind neither PP1 (3Beullens M. Vulsteke V. Van Eynde A. Jagiello I. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) nor RNA (15Jin Q. Beullens M. Jagiello I. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 13-19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these results indicated that the function of NIPP1 in splicing was unrelated to its ability to interact with PP1 or RNA. The fragments of NIPP1 that blocked splicing did not cause an accumulation of splicing intermediates (Fig. 2), suggesting that they interfered with spliceosome assembly rather than with the splicing process itself. We have therefore used native gel electrophoresis to separate the spliceosomal A-, B-, and C-complexes and to study the effect of the inhibitory NIPP1 fragments on the accumulation of these complexes. In Fig. 3 it is shown that the C-complex was no longer formed in the presence of 10 μmof the FHA domain. Moreover, in the latter condition there appeared to be an accumulation of the B-complex as expected from a block at the B → C transition. Similar data were obtained with NIPP1-(1–224) (not shown). In view of a report that hinted at an essential role for PP1 in constitutive splicing in vitro (7Mermoud J.E. Cohen P. Lamond A.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5263-5269Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), it was surprising that NIPP1, a potent inhibitor of PP1, did not affect splicing of β-globin pre-mRNA (Figs. 2 and 4A). It was therefore important to examine whether NIPP1 was inhibitory to PP1 in nuclear extracts under conditions that were identical to those that were used for pre-mRNA splicing (see “Experimental Procedures”). As a protein phosphatase substrate we used glycogen phosphorylase a, a well known substrate for PP1 and PP2A. The phosphorylase phosphatase activity in splicing extracts was inhibited for about 90% by saturating concentrations of NIPP1 (Fig. 4B), in accordance with the previous demonstration that showed that nearly all the phosphorylase phosphatase activity in nuclear extracts stems from PP1 (9Jagiello I. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17257-17263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The remainder of the activity was most likely derived from PP2A because this activity was blocked by low concentrations of okadaic acid (50 nm in Fig. 4B), which were only marginally inhibitory for PP1 in splicing extracts (Fig. 5B). Similar data on splicing and phosphatase activities were obtained with inhibitor-2, a structurally unrelated inhibitor of PP1 (Fig. 4). These data demonstrated that PP1 activity was not required for in vitro splicing of the β-globin transcript.Figure 5Splicing inhibition by okadaic acid is not mediated by PP1. A, splicing of β-globin pre-mRNA was carried out for 30 or 120 min at 30 °C in the presence of the indicated concentrations of okadaic acid. The progression of splicing was followed by denaturing PAGE of the phenol-extracted RNA.B shows the phosphorylase phosphatase activity in the same extracts represented as means ± S.E. (n = 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The evidence that implicated PP1 in constitutive in vitro splicing was largely based on the use of toxins that differentially inhibit various types of protein serine/threonine phosphatases (7Mermoud J.E. Cohen P. Lamond A.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5263-5269Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). For example, low concentrations of okadaic acid were reported to inhibit the second step of splicing catalysis while higher concentrations of this toxin also blocked the first step. Because PP1 is relatively insensitive to inhibition by okadaic acid, these data were taken as evidence for a role of PP1 in the first step of splicing. However, in these studies the phosphatase and splicing assays were done at hugely different dilutions of the nuclear extracts and with very different assay mixtures. We have therefore reevaluated the effects of okadaic acid on pre-mRNA splicing and on PP1 activity in identical circumstances except for the use of a different substrate (pre-mRNA versus phosphorylase a). Under the adopted assay conditions okadaic acid slowed down pre-mRNA splicing but did not block the process entirely (Fig. 5A). Indeed, while okadaic acid prevented the accumulation of mRNA at an earlier time point (30 min), this was no longer apparent at a later time point (120 min). On the other hand, okadaic acid clearly caused an accumulation of splicing intermediates at 120 min. These findings suggested that one or more okadaic acid-sensitive protein phosphatases determined the kinetics of the second catalytic step of splicing but did not affect the first step of splicing. At variance with the data of Mermoud et al. (7Mermoud J.E. Cohen P. Lamond A.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5263-5269Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), we found that the effects of okadaic acid on splicing were maximal at concentrations between 40 and 200 nm (Fig. 5A), and these concentrations were only partially inhibitory for PP1 in the extracts (Fig. 5B). Conversely, the nearly complete inhibition of PP1 by high concentrations of okadaic acid (1–5 μm) did not reproducibly cause an additional splicing deficiency. Thus, the splicing effects of okadaic acid were not correlated with an inhibition of PP1. Spliceosomes are highly complex and dynamic molecular machines. They consist of up to five snRNAs and 100 different polypeptides (16Will C.L. Lührmann R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The present data show that NIPP1 is one of the spliceosomal components in nuclear extracts. NIPP1 was recruited during or shortly after the ATP-dependent formation of the A-complex (Fig. 1A) and remained associated with the spliceosomes throughout the splicing process, as indicated by its association with complexes that contained pre-mRNA, splicing intermediates, and splicing products (Fig. 1B). The recruitment of NIPP1 to the spliceosomes was antagonized by the addition of the FHA domain (Fig. 1A), but this effect was not seen when the FHA domain was mutated in its phosphate-binding loop. This indicates that the association of NIPP1 with the spliceosomes is mediated by the binding of the FHA domain to a phosphoprotein(s). It remains to be investigated whether NIPP1 is targeted to the spliceosomes by the same proteins (CDC5L and SAP155) that also mediate its association with the speckles (6Boudrez A. Beullens M. Groenen P. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Jagiello I. Murray M. Krainer A.R. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25411-25417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).2 The likely phosphorylation-dependence of the association of NIPP1 with the spliceosomes also explains why NIPP1 has hitherto not been recognized as a splicing factor. Indeed, the described purification procedures of spliceosomal complexes do not include the use of inhibitors of protein phosphatases (17Reed R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8031-8035Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 18Neubauer G. King A. Rappsilber J. Calvio C. Watson M. Ajuh P. Sleeman J. Lamond A. Mann M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) and are therefore expected to result in the loss of proteins that interact through phosphopeptide modules. NIPP1-(1–142) (Fig. 1A) and NIPP1-(1–224) (not shown) displaced endogenous NIPP1 from the spliceosomes and blocked the transition between the spliceosomal B- and C-complexes (Fig. 3). Because NIPP1-(1–329) did not display such effects, these data suggest that residues 225–329 are somehow involved in the rearrangements between spliceosomal components that accompany the conversion of the B-complex into the C-complex. We speculate that residues 225–329 of NIPP1 constitute an interaction site for a spliceosomal component and that this interaction is essential for the B → C transition. It is possible that this C-terminal interactor of NIPP1 is SAP155, which also interacts with the FHA domain of NIPP1.2 An interaction between SAP155 and the C-terminal domain of NIPP1 would explain why the dominant negative mutants of NIPP1 hampered the tight association of SAP155 with the spliceosomes (Fig. 1A). Although the amount of RNA that co-precipitated with NIPP1 was doubled by the addition of recombinant NIPP1 (Fig. 1), this did not measurably stimulate splicing catalysis (Fig. 2). This indicates that not all complexes that contained NIPP1 and RNA were converted into mature spliceosomes, probably because other splicing factors besides NIPP1 were also present at limiting concentrations. An unexpected finding was that the function of NIPP1 in spliceosome assembly appeared unrelated to its ability to interact with PP1 (Fig. 2). Our results are at variance with those of Trinkle-Mulcahy et al. (4Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Ajuh P. Prescott A. Claverie-Martin F. Cohen S. Lamond A.I. Cohen P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 157-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who reported that NIPP1 became inhibitory to in vitro splicing following mutation of the PP1-binding RV XF-motif in the central domain of NIPP1. We did not observe any effect of this mutation on in vitro splicing (Fig. 2) in accordance with our failure to detect a role for PP1 in splicing (Fig. 5). It should also be pointed out that the mutation of the RV XF-motif is not sufficient to abolish the interaction between NIPP1 and PP1 because NIPP1 also harbors a PP1 interaction domain in its C-terminal residues (3Beullens M. Vulsteke V. Van Eynde A. Jagiello I. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Mammalian genomes contain 100–200 genes that encode protein phosphatases (19Bollen M. Beullens M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 138-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These enzymes have been classified into four families based on their substrate specificity and structural conservation. All protein phosphatase families are represented in the nucleus. However, members of the family of protein tyrosine phosphatases do not appear to be essential for in vitro splicing because their inhibition by 1 mm vanadate did not affect the splicing of β-globin (not shown). Neither was splicing affected by 120 mm KCl (not shown), which inhibits the protein serine/threonine phosphatase FCP1, the only known member of the FCP family (20Chambers R.S. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26243-26248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the Mg2+-dependent protein serine/threonine phosphatase PP2Cγ, a member of the PPM family, has been identified as a splicing factor that is involved in the assembly of the A-complex (12Murray M.V. Kobayashi R. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). The large PPP family of protein serine/threonine protein phosphatases comprises the structurally related subfamilies PP1, PP2A (including PP4 and PP6), PP2B (calcineurin), and PP5, and these phosphatases are inhibited by toxins such as okadaic acid and microcystin that also inhibit in vitro splicing (7Mermoud J.E. Cohen P. Lamond A.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5263-5269Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We found that the specific inhibition of PP2B by 1 mm EGTA (not shown) and of PP1 by NIPP1 or inhibitor-2 (Fig. 4) did not affect in vitro splicing. This suggests that the inhibition of splicing by the toxins most likely stems from their effects on PP5 and/or PP2A (Fig. 6). In accordance with previous studies (7Mermoud J.E. Cohen P. Lamond A.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5263-5269Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), we noted that microcystin and okadaic acid inhibited splicing catalysis but did not affect the accumulation of the spliceosomal A-, B-, and C-complexes (not shown). A remarkable difference in the effects of these toxins was that microcystin blocked both step of catalysis (Ref. 7Mermoud J.E. Cohen P. Lamond A.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5263-5269Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, not shown), while okadaic acid only inhibited the second step (Fig. 5). Because PP1 is clearly not implicated in pre-mRNA splicing in vitro(Figs. 4 and 5), these data are difficult to explain by different sensitivities of known protein phosphatases to these toxins. Perhaps, microcystin can inhibit a protein phosphatase that is buried inside the spliceosomal complex and that can not be accessed by okadaic acid due to its hydrophobic nature. Alternatively, the first step of splicing is controlled by an hitherto unknown protein phosphatase that is inhibited by microcystin but not by okadaic acid. There is currently only limited information available on the spliceosomal substrates of protein phosphatases (Fig. 6). An obvious candidate is the splicing factor SF1, which inhibits the assembly of the A-complex in its phosphorylated form (21Wang X. Bruderer S. Rafi Z. Xue J. Milburn P.J. Krämer A. Robinson P.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4549-4559Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the splicing factor SF2/ASF stimulates its interaction with the U1-snRNP-associated U1–70K phosphoprotein and thereby facilitates the initial association of the U1 snRNP with the 5′-splice site (22Xiao S.-H. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6359-6367Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Both the SF2/ASF and the U1–70K protein have to be dephosphorylated at a later step, before the first step of catalysis. SAP155 is known to be phosphorylated shortly before or during the first step of splicing, but the function of this phosphorylation and the timing of dephosphorylation has not yet been explored (23Wang C. Chua K. Seghezzi W. Lees E. Gozani O. Reed R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1409-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Although protein tyrosine phosphatases, FCP1, PP2B, and PP1 do not appear to be rate-limiting for in vitro splicing, we do not rule out their involvement in spliceosome disassembly, in the shuttling of splicing factors to the speckles, or in the control of alternative splicing. As a matter of fact, PP1 has been suggested to modulate alternative 5′-splice site selection in nuclear extracts (24Cardinali B. Cohen P.T.W. Lamond A.I. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). PP1 has also been implicated in the dephosphorylation of splicing factors of the SR family (25Misteli T. Spector D.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 135-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), necessary for their shuttling to the speckles after splicing catalysis (Fig. 6). The dephosphorylation of other splicing factors (e.g. SAP155 or CDC5L) by PP1 may also be required for spliceosome disassembly or for the subsequent relocalization of these splicing factors (6Boudrez A. Beullens M. Groenen P. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Jagiello I. Murray M. Krainer A.R. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25411-25417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).2 The regulatory subunit that targets these splicing factors for dephosphorylation by PP1 has not yet been identified, but NIPP1 seems an obvious candidate. Thus, NIPP1 could turn out to be a bifunctional protein, i.e. it has a PP1-independent function in spliceosome assembly, and after splicing catalysis, NIPP1 is possibly involved in the regeneration of splicing-competent splicing factors through their dephosphorylation by NIPP1-associated PP1 (Fig. 6). We thank Prof. W. Stalmans for his continuous support and for commenting critically on the manuscript.

Magee A.I. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 629-641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The “classic” members of this protein family (E-, N-, P-, and C-cadherin) are characterized by five, highly similar Ig-like extracellular CAD-domains (3Bork P. Downing A.K. Kieffer B. Campbell I.D.

The models jointly propose that cadherin-mediated adhesion is initiated by lateral, parallel cis dimerization followed by an antiparallel adhesive trans contact of cis dimers on opposing cells. They are controversial concerning the CAD-domains involved, the contact sites, and the specificity of interactions. Structural studies identifying the interfaces involved in the adhesive trans interaction of cadherins are limited, because of the weakness of this interaction (8Baumgartner W. Hinterdorfer P. Ness W. Raab A. Vestweber D. Schindler H. Drenckhahn D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4005-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Candidate interfaces for trans interaction have been described for the N-terminal CAD1 and the CAD1–2 domain pair crystal structures of N-cadherin (9Tamura K. Shan W.S. Hendrickson W.A. Colman D.R. Shapiro L. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar,10Shapiro L. Fannon A.M. Kwong P.D. Thompson A. Lehmann M.S. Grubel G. Legrand J.F. Als-Nielsen J. Colman D.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). These contacts have been criticized in that they are caused by crystal packing forces rather than protein-protein interactions (2Angst B.D. Marcozzi C. Magee A.I. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 629-641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,11Chappuis-Flament S. Wong E. Hicks L.D. Kay C.M. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Structural investigations on cis and trans interactions of the full-length, glycosylated ectodomain of cadherins so far are restricted to ultrastructural studies using electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Upon calcium binding the ectodomain of classic cadherins adopts a bent rod-like shape, which was first detected in a monomeric state in electron micrographs (12Becker J.W. Erickson H.P. Hoffman S. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1088-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 13Pokutta S. Herrenknecht K. Kemler R. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). To analyze cis and trans contacts of recombinantly expressed cadherin ectodomains the intrinsic protein concentration must be increased. Therefore the coiled-coil domain of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (14Oldberg A. Antonsson P. Lindblom K. Heinegard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22346-22350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which forms a pentameric coiled-coil structure (15Malashkevich V.N. Kammerer R.A. Efimov V.P. Schulthess T. Engel J. Science. 1996; 274: 761-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), has been fused to the CAD-domains 1–5 of E-cadherin (16Tomschy A. Fauser C. Landwehr R. Engel J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3507-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Pentamerization increased the intrinsic concentration of ectodomains to estimated levels (∼0.1–2 mm) at which cis and trans interactions occur. cis dimerization was detected in electron micrographs as a ring-like interaction at the N terminus of two ectodomains and trans contacts by subsequent association of two rings. The method was also used to monitor the Ca2+ dependence of different adhesion steps of E-cadherin (17Pertz O. Bozic D. Koch A.W. Fauser C. Brancaccio A. Engel J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1738-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The authors observed rigidification and cis dimerization of two molecules at Ca2+concentrations <1 mm and trans interaction above this threshold. In contrast to the importance of Trp-2 for cis dimerization of N-cadherin (10Shapiro L. Fannon A.M. Kwong P.D. Thompson A. Lehmann M.S. Grubel G. Legrand J.F. Als-Nielsen J. Colman D.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar), site-directed mutagenesis of Trp-2 to alanine abolished trans but not cis interactions of E-cadherin (17Pertz O. Bozic D. Koch A.W. Fauser C. Brancaccio A. Engel J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1738-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The concept of specific interactions between the N-terminal domains 1 and 2 in cis and trans interactions was challenged by a model based on force measurements between lipid bilayers to which ectodomains of Xenopus C-cadherin were attached (7Leckband D. Sivasankar S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 18Sivasankar S. Brieher W. Lavrik N. Gumbiner B. Leckband D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11820-11824Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Here, a ribbon model of multiple adhesive interactions involving variable ectodomains as interaction partners was suggested. The specificity of cadherin interactions is another important feature of cadherin function (19Nose A. Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. Cell. 1988; 54: 993-1001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). The importance of cadherin specificity in tissue morphogenesis has been shown by a number of investigators (20Takeichi M. Development. 1988; 102: 639-655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Takeichi M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar, 22Fannon A.M. Colman D.R. Neuron. 1996; 17: 423-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Early studies in which CAD-domains were exchanged from one cadherin to another clearly proved that cadherin specificity is determined by the N-terminal domain CAD1 (23Nose A. Tsuji K. Takeichi M. Cell. 1990; 61: 147-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Although specificity normally leads to homophilic cell-cell adhesion, heterophilic trans association of cadherins has been observed, which could be important during cell migration or tissue remodeling (24Inuzuka H. Miyatani S. Takeichi M. Neuron. 1991; 7: 69-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 25Murphy-Erdosh C. Yoshida C.K. Paradies N. Reichardt L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1379-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 26Volk T. Cohen O. Geiger B. Cell. 1987; 50: 987-994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In addition, heterophilic cis interactions of cadherins on the same cell surface have also been reported recently (27Shan W.S. Tanaka H. Phillips G.R. Arndt K. Yoshida M. Colman D.R. Shapiro L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 28Klingelhofer J. Troyanovsky R.B. Laur O.Y. Troyanovsky S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2829-2836PubMed Google Scholar). Based on contacts between CAD1 domains of NCAD a “zipper model” was proposed (10Shapiro L. Fannon A.M. Kwong P.D. Thompson A. Lehmann M.S. Grubel G. Legrand J.F. Als-Nielsen J. Colman D.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar) that is at variance with electron microscopic data of interacting complete extracellular regions (16Tomschy A. Fauser C. Landwehr R. Engel J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3507-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 17Pertz O. Bozic D. Koch A.W. Fauser C. Brancaccio A. Engel J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1738-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). It may be argued that steric hindrance imposed by the pentamerization domain may prevent contacts between relevant CAD-domains and thus prevent zipper formation. To resolve this problem homophilic and heterophilic interactions of cadherins were further analyzed by using different linkers and a different oligomerization system. Cadherin ectodomains were artificially clustered using the leucine zipper domains of c-Jun and c-Fos, which are known to preferentially form heterodimers. This oligomerization system enabled the production of ectodomain heterodimers of murine P- and E-cadherin. Using electron microscopy and chemical cross-linking we demonstrate that the ring formation is independent of the type of oligomerization domain and that specificity for homophilic interactions already exists for cis dimerization. Sequences encoding the leucine zippers of human c-Jun (29Bohmann D. Bos T.J. Admon A. Nishimura T. Vogt P.K. Tjian R. Science. 1987; 238: 1386-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar) and human c-Fos (30van Straaten F. Muller R. Curran T. Van Beveren C. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3183-3187Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), respectively, were amplified by PCR. The coding sequence for a His6-tag at the 3′-end of the construct was also added. Primers used were (restriction sites are indicated as boldface letters): cJunLZ-upp, 5′-AATAAGAATGCGGCCGC AGGATCAGGTTCTGGAAGAATCGCCCGGCTG-3′; cJunLZ-low, 5′-GCGCTCTAGA CTAATGATGGTGGTGGTGATGTCCACTTCCGTGGTTCATGACTTT-3′; cFosLZ-upp, 5′-AATAAGAATGCGGCCGC AGGATCAGGTTCTGGACTGACTGATACACTC-3′; cFosLZ-low, 5′-GCGCTCTAGA CTAATGATGGTGG- TGGTGATGTCCACTTCCCAGGATGAACTCTAG-3′. Polymerase chain reaction followed standard protocols with Pwo polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The resulting fragments were NotI/XbaI-digested and cloned into NotI/XbaI-digested murine ECADCOMPpBS (17Pertz O. Bozic D. Koch A.W. Fauser C. Brancaccio A. Engel J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1738-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) thus exchanging the COMPcc for the c-Jun/c-Fos leucine zippers, respectively. Finally, ECADJun and ECADFos were KpnI/XbaI-digested and cloned into KpnI/NheI sites of the eucaryotic expression vector pCepPu (31Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The cDNA of the extracellular domain of murine P-cadherin (32Nose A. Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3655-3661Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using following primers: PCAD-upp, 5′-GGGGTACC ATGGAGCTTCTTAGTGGGCCTCAC-3′; PCAD-low, 5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGC GGGTTCCGAGGGTCTGGGGCAGTC-3′. The cDNA fragment of P-cadherin (amino acids 1–643) was then KpnI/NotI-digested and cloned into KpnI/NotI-digested pBSFos plasmid. PCADFos was finally cloned into the KpnI/NheI sites of pCepPu. For constructing PCADCOMP-StrepTag (33Schmidt T.G. Skerra A. J. Chromatogr. A. 1994; 676: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), ratCOMPcc was amplified by PCR from ECADCOMPpBS using the primers: COMP-upp, 5′-GAAGTCGGTACCTGCGGCCGC CACGGG-3′ and COMP-Strep-Taglow, 5′-GACTCACCGCGGTCTAGA CTATTTTTCGAACTGTGGGTGACTCCATCCACTTCCCACGCTCAGACC-3′. The PCR product was NotI/XbaI-digested and cloned into NotI/XbaI-digested pBSPCADFos and finally cloned into pCepPu using KpnI/NheI sites. The ECADW2AJun construct was generated using the pCep4-ECADW2ACOMP plasmid described before (17Pertz O. Bozic D. Koch A.W. Fauser C. Brancaccio A. Engel J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1738-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The ECADW2A cDNA was cloned into KpnI/NotI-digested pBSJun. ECADW2AJun was eventually cloned into KpnI/NheI-digested pCepPu vector. Escherichia coli DH10b was used as cloning host strain. All constructs were sequenced with a BigDye sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and analyzed with an ABI Prism 310 sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Human embryonal kidney 293-EBNA cells (Invitrogen) were cultured in DMEM F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% glutamine, and 10 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. All reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. Stable transfections were carried out using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Cells were plated at a concentration of 5 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates (Falcon) and were grown over night. A transfection mix was prepared containing 5 μl of LipofectAMINE, 200 μl of DMEM F12 without FBS and 1 μg of plasmid DNA. This mix was incubated for 45 min at room temperature. The cells were washed once with DMEM F12 without FBS, and 0.8 ml of medium without FBS was added per well. The transfection mix was then added for 16 h at 37 °C. The wells were washed again, and 2 ml of FBS-containing medium/well was added. Selection of transfected cells was performed in culture medium containing 2 μg/ml puromycin. Bulk cultures of transfected cells were used for protein expression. When confluency of transfected cells was reached on 20-cm plates (Falcon), 23 ml of expression medium (DMEM F12, 1% glutamine, 10 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin) was added for 48 h. Conditioned medium was then collected, and new expression medium was added. This procedure was repeated 8–10 times. Supernatants were centrifuged at 2500 × g for 10 min, buffered in 20 mmHepes, pH 7.1, and stored at −20 °C. Supernatants containing recombinant proteins were sterile-filtered, dialyzed against 50 mmTris, pH 7.9, and concentrated by DEAE-Sepharose chromatography (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Purification of His6-tagged proteins followed standard procedures under native conditions (Novagen). Purification of PCADCOMP-StrepTag was performed using the StrepTactin matrix (IBA, Goettingen, Germany). Shortly thereafter, the concentrated supernatant in 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.9, was applied to a column packed with 2 ml of the StrepTactin resin. Applying a single-step affinity purification under native conditions, the protein was eluted with 5 mm of the specific competitor desthiobiotin (Sigma). Finally, the fractions containing the purified protein were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 1 mm CaCl2. 5 μg of PCADCOMP-StrepTag was loaded onto an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Unspecific binding sites on the membrane were blocked with 25 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 125 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20 (Merck), 3% bovine serum albumin (Sigma). After several washes with blocking buffer, the membrane was incubated with 0.2 μg/ml HRP-streptavidin (Pierce) for 2 h at room temperature. After two final washing steps with 25 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 125 mm NaCl, the chromogenic reaction was initiated using ECL-Plus (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). An Aviv 62DS circular dichroism spectropolarimeter was used with thermostatted 1-mm quartz cuvettes. Far-ultraviolet spectra (195–250 nm) were recorded at 25 °C. Proteins were dialyzed against 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with or without 5 mm CaCl2. Each spectrum was the average of six scans and was corrected for the buffer contribution. Chemical cross-linking of purified cadherins was performed using bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3), which is a homobifunctional sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester analog with a spacer arm length of 1.14 nm (Pierce). Cadherin chimera were dialyzed against 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.1, containing EDTA or CaCl2 as indicated for each experiment. The purified proteins (4 μm) were incubated at a 10- to 50-fold molar excess of cross-linker for 120 min at 25 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, or reducing (50 mm dithiothreitol) gel sample buffer (2× Laemmli), and the oligomerization state was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (3–15% gradient gels). The oligomerization states of cadherins after cross-linking were visualized by silver staining of the gels. Purified cadherin proteins were used at a protein concentration of 1–2 μm in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing EDTA or CaCl2 as indicated. For electron microscopy at different Ca2+ concentrations, samples were Ca2+-depleted with EDTA and then dialyzed against Ca2+-containing buffers. Each sample was diluted 1:1 (v/v) with 80% glycerol and sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica. Rotary shadowing was performed with platinum/carbon at an angle of 9° and carbon shadowing at an angle of 90°. Replica formation and electron microscopy were performed as described elsewhere (34Engel J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 469-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For statistical evaluations, the protein species (“rings” and “double rings”) were counted on electron micrographs. Five fields were evaluated, resulting in a total of ∼150 molecules. Using a well established method to analyze cis and trans association of E-cadherin (16Tomschy A. Fauser C. Landwehr R. Engel J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3507-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 17Pertz O. Bozic D. Koch A.W. Fauser C. Brancaccio A. Engel J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1738-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) a PCADCOMP protein chimera was designed (Fig. 1) and expressed in the eucaryotic cell line HEK 293-EBNA. The fusion protein contained the five extracellular CAD-domains of P-cadherin connected by a linker region to the coiled-coil domain of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP). A sequence eight amino acids long with high affinity for modified streptavidin was added at the C terminus of the protein to facilitate purification (35Skerra A. Schmidt T.G. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 326: 271-304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of the secreted protein was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel and a Western blot of the purified protein are shown in Fig. 2 A. PCADCOMP-StrepTag was readily detected after blotting as a 90-kDa protein by incubation with HRP-conjugated streptavidin and enhanced chemiluminescence.Figure 2Purification and analysis of cis and trans association of PCADCOMP. A, silver staining and Western blotting of purified PCADCOMP. PCADCOMP was purified using the StrepTag II purification system. The protein was analyzed by silver staining after 8% SDS-PAGE (molecular mass markers are indicated by arrows on the left) and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Protein detection was performed by incubation with HRP-conjugated streptavidin followed by ECL. B, electron microscopy of PCADCOMP. PCADCOMP was subjected to rotary shadowing in the presence of 2 mm Ca2+. Representative fields of the electron micrographs are shown, and individual molecules are shown in higher magnification.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) PCADCOMP was subjected to rotary shadowing. In previous work cis and trans interactions of E-cadherin were detected in such electron micrographs as ring-like structures and associated rings, respectively. Similar structures for PCADCOMP, as for E-cadherin, were found, indicating cis and trans interaction (Fig. 2 B). Analysis of cis and trans association of cadherin heterodimers was investigated by chemical cross-linking and electron microscopy. Constructs were designed based on the preferential capacity of the c-Jun and c-Fos leucine zippers to form heterodimers (36O'Shea E.K. Rutkowski R. Stafford 3rd, W.F. Kim P.S. Science. 1989; 245: 646-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 37Glover J.N. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). These heterodimerizing coiled-coil domains have already been used successfully to generate bispecific F(ab′)2 antibody fragments (38Kostelny S.A. Cole M.S. Tso J.Y. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1547-1553PubMed Google Scholar), a soluble T-cell receptor (39Chang H.C. Bao Z. Yao Y. Tse A.G. Goyarts E.C. Madsen M. Kawasaki E. Brauer P.P. Sacchettini J.C. Nathenson S.G. Reinherz E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11408-11412Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and soluble human α3β1 integrin (40Eble J.A. Wucherpfennig K.W. Gauthier L. Dersch P. Krukonis E. Isberg R.R. Hemler M.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10945-10955Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The extracellular domains of E-cadherin, P-cadherin, and the W2A mutant of E-cadherin were connected by an AAAGSGSG linker to either the c-Jun or the c-Fos leucine zipper domains (Fig. 1). A coding sequence for a His6-tag was added at the C-terminal end of the constructs. Silver-stained gels of the purified proteins are shown in Fig. 3 A. A second protein band of ∼110 kDa was observed after purification of ECADJun and ECADFos (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3 and 4). These bands represent a minor proportion of E-cadherin molecules where the N-terminal propeptide domain was not properly processed. Correct folding of the heterodimers was tested by CD spectroscopy (Fig. 3 B). A dominant β-sheet like secondary structure of E-cadherin with minima of the CD signal around 215 nm is seen at 5 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 3 B;triangles). Calcium depletion results in a significant change in the circular dichroism spectra of the protein indicated by a shift of the minima of the CD signal toward 200 nm (Fig. 3 B;open circles). These findings are supported by similar CD changes of the monomeric extracellular domain of E-cadherin (13Pokutta S. Herrenknecht K. Kemler R. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In homodimers of ECAD interlinked by the c-Jun and c-Fos leucine zipper domains, the two polypeptide chains were chemically cross-linked by BS3 as indicated by stable 180-kDa dimers on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig. 4 A). In addition, a complex of around 400 kDa was cross-linked in the presence of Ca2+ but not in the presence of EDTA (Fig. 4 A). This 400-kDa complex most likely represents the trans association of two ECAD dimers. In contrast, no analogous indication for a trans complex was observed for heterodimers of ECADJun and PCADFos, neither in the presence nor in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 4 B). The possibility that the observed tetramerization in Fig. 4 A is caused by association of the C-terminal His6-tags can be excluded because the His6-tag is present in both dimers. To get information on cis and trans dimerization on the ultrastructural level, we performed electron microscopy experiments (Figs.5 and 6). Three different subsets of heterodimeric proteins were rotary-shadowed and analyzed. For ECADJun/ECADFos dimers, a mixture of non-associated dimers, ring-forming cis dimers, and only a few eight-shaped complexes of two rings indicating trans interactions were observed in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 5 A). The latter fraction was, however, the most prominent one in the presence of 5 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 5 B).Figure 6Electron microscopy of ECADW2AJun/ECADFos and ECADJun/PCADFos heterodimers. ECADW2AJun/ECADFos (A) and ECADJun/PCADFos heterodimers (B) were subjected to rotary shadowing in the presence of 5 mm Ca2+. Representative fields of the electron micrographs are shown, and individual heterodimers are shown in higher magnification.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To see whether Trp-2 is involved in cis or trans interactions a ECADFos/ECADW2AJun heterodimer was investigated, and the results are depicted in Fig. 6 A. Mutating Trp-2 in one of the chains of the heterodimer into an alanine totally abolished trans association of ECAD (Fig. 6 A).cis interactions observed as ring-like structures involving CAD1 and 2 are still formed, confirming and extending previous studies with the ECADCOMPW2A mutant (17Pertz O. Bozic D. Koch A.W. Fauser C. Brancaccio A. Engel J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1738-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). A small proportion of W-shaped tetramers was detected for the ECADFos/ECADW2AJun heterodimer (Fig. 6 A), perhaps indicating rare events of cis interaction of non-mutated ECAD chains of different dimers. Finally, analyzing ECADJun/PCADFos heterodimers, neither cis nor trans interactions were detectable (Fig. 6 B). Antiparallel head-to-head interactions of monomers were also not observed. These data are in agreement with the strong homophilic specificity of P- and E-cadherin proven by other assays and provide the novel insight that specificity is already determined at the level of cis dimerization. In this report we extended the ECADCOMP model system of analyzing interactions of clustered cadherin ectodomains (16Tomschy A. Fauser C. Landwehr R. Engel J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3507-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Realizing the potential risk that the oligomerization domain introduced by protein engineering may influence the mode of cadherin interactions due to steric hindrance, different oligomerization domains and different linkers were used. These include the c-Jun and c-Fos leucine zippers, which have been used successfully for heterodimerized protein complexes (38Kostelny S.A. Cole M.S. Tso J.Y. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1547-1553PubMed Google Scholar, 40Eble J.A. Wucherpfennig K.W. Gauthier L. Dersch P. Krukonis E. Isberg R.R. Hemler M.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10945-10955Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 41Kalandadze A. Galleno M. Foncerrada L. Strominger J.L. Wucherpfennig K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20156-20162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For E-cadherin ectodomains dimerized by c-Jun and c-Fos leucine zippers a high proportion of ring-like structures indicating cis interactions was detected at Ca2+ concentrations of around 1 mm. At Ca2+ concentrations above 2 mm trans contacts of two cis dimers are formed confirming and extending our model of cadherin association (16Tomschy A. Fauser C. Landwehr R. Engel J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3507-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Our data strongly suggest a contribution of mainly CAD1 of E-cadherin or P-cadherin to cis and trans association. Most importantly, the rings had the same shape as the earlier observed rings in ECADCOMP. Because the dimeric Jun/Fos leucine zipper and the pentameric COMP coiled-coil are very different, an induction of binding by these domains is highly unlikely. It should also be noted that different spacers were used. On the other hand, ectodomains of classic cadherins intrinsically show a slightly bended shape after Ca2+ binding (12Becker J.W. Erickson H.P. Hoffman S. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1088-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 13Pokutta S. Herrenknecht K. Kemler R. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Glycosylation of CAD-domains 3–5 may also prevent a parallel alignment, thus leading to ring-like cis dimers. The importance of Trp-2 in the adhesive function of classic cadherins has been proven by many researchers (9Tamura K. Shan W.S. Hendrickson W.A. Colman D.R. Shapiro L. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 10Shapiro L. Fannon A.M. Kwong P.D. Thompson A. Lehmann M.S. Grubel G. Legrand J.F. Als-Nielsen J.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1738-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 27Shan W.S. Tanaka H. Phillips G.R. Arndt K. Yoshida M. Colman D.R. Shapiro L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it was proposed that Trp-2 is already essential for cis dimer formation (10Shapiro L. Fannon A.M. Kwong P.D. Thompson A. Lehmann M.S. Grubel G. Legrand J.F. Als-Nielsen J. Colman D.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar) or necessary for Ca2+-dependent trans association (17Pertz O. Bozic D. Koch A.W. Fauser C. Brancaccio A. Engel J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1738-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Our data favor the latter hypothesis, because ECADW2AJun/ECADFos heterodimers are still able to form cis dimers but not trans dimers. Heterophilic cis interactions of different cadherins have been observed by co-immunoprecipitations of total cell lysates for N- and R-cadherin (27Shan W.S. Tanaka H. Phillips G.R. Arndt K. Yoshida M. Colman D.R. Shapiro L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and for E- and P-cadherin (28Klingelhofer J. Troyanovsky R.B. Laur O.Y. Troyanovsky S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2829-2836PubMed Google Scholar). These co-immunoprecipitation experiments do not necessarily describe the nature of the cis contact, because there is the risk that large cadherin complexes connected by catenins and the cytoskeleton are also co-precipitated. On the ultrastructural level we were unable to detect heterophilic lateral contacts of E-cadherin and P-cadherin. The results presented here favor the strong homophilic specificity of these cadherins, which has already been observed in a pioneering publication (19Nose A. Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. Cell. 1988; 54: 993-1001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). In addition, domain swapping experiments between E-cadherin and P-cadherin proved that the N-terminal CAD1-domain determined the specificity of cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion (23Nose A. Tsuji K. Takeichi M. Cell. 1990; 61: 147-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Our data now suggest that the specificity of cadherin adhesion is already determined at the level of cis dimerization, a feature that will be further defined by site-directed mutagenesis. In contrast to the above-mentioned finding that the specificity is located in domain 1 and that a point mutation in this domain abolishes adhesion, a ribbon model of multiple adhesive interactions involving several CAD-domains was proposed for C-cadherin (7Leckband D. Sivasankar S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 18Sivasankar S. Brieher W. Lavrik N. Gumbiner B. Leckband D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11820-11824Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and a contribution of the CAD-domains 3–5 has been suggested (11Chappuis-Flament S. Wong E. Hicks L.D. Kay C.M. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). These results obtained for C-cadherin are hard to reconcile with the formation of rings and associated rings we observe for E-cadherin and P-cadherin, which suggests exclusive interactions between the N-terminal domains. In addition, an instructive study analyzing the zonula adherens in chicken retinal epithelium by cryo-electron microscopic methods recently showed that rods of about ∼20 nm in length were extending from the cell surface very much resembling cadherins (42Miyaguchi K. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 132: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cells were connected by head-to-head interactions of these rod-like structures with a total length of ∼35–45 nm, whereas the ribbon model suggests an overlap with 22 nm (7Leckband D. Sivasankar S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 18Sivasankar S. Brieher W. Lavrik N. Gumbiner B. Leckband D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11820-11824Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Several other members of the Ig family of cell adhesion molecules have been analyzed by electron microscopy studies. In one study a conformational shift of the L1 cell adhesion molecule from a compact horseshoe (detected by negative staining) to an elongated form (detected by rotary shadowing) was demonstrated (43Schurmann G.

In contrast, for E-cadherin the same kind of associated rings are detected when rotary shadowing is compared with negative staining (16Tomschy A. Fauser C. Landwehr R. Engel J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3507-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). A homodimeric ICAM1-GCN4 protein chimera has been shown to associate to ring-like structures as well as W-shaped tetramers. This has been interpreted to account for different modes of cis interactions (44Jun C.D. Carman C.V. Redick S.D. Shimaoka M. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29019-29027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A close parallel alignment of these members of the Ig family of CAMs, which would indicate direct interactions of variable extracellular domains, was not detected by rotary shadowing. Close alignment of Ig-domains nevertheless can be observed by electron microscopy as was shown for the D1–D4 domains of the Ig family member hemolin (43Schurmann G. Haspel J. Grumet M. Erickson H.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1765-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In summary, cis and trans association of dimerized E-cadherin or pentamerized P-cadherin involves only the N-terminal domains CAD1 and 2 resulting in ring-like structures formed during cis and trans contacts. No parallel alignment of whole cadherin ectodomains was observed. A decisive role of Trp-2 was found for trans but not for cis interaction of E-cadherin. The specificity of cadherin interactions was proven to be determined at the level of cis dimerization. It will be interesting to define the contact sites in cis and trans association and the residues involved in cadherin specificity in future studies.

https://openalex.org/W2159905210,"A novel approach to localize and reconstruct conformational IgE-binding epitope regions of hevein (Hev b6.02), a major natural rubber latex allergen, is described. An antimicrobial protein (AMP) from the amaranth Amaranthus caudatus was used as an immunologically non-IgE-binding adaptor molecule to which terminal or central parts of hevein were fused. Hevein and AMP share a structurally identical core region but have different N-terminal and C-terminal regions. Only 1 of 16 hevein-allergic patients showed weak IgE binding to purified native or recombinant AMP. Chimeric AMP with the hevein N terminus was recognized by IgE from 14 (88%) patients, and chimeric AMP with the hevein C terminus was recognized by IgE from 6 (38%) patients. In contrast, chimeric AMP containing the hevein core region was recognized by IgE from only two patients. When both the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of hevein were fused with the AMP core, IgE from all 16 patients bound to the chimera. This chimera was also able to significantly inhibit (>70%) IgE binding to the native hevein. On the contrary, linear synthetic peptides corresponding to hevein regions in the AMP chimeras showed no significant IgE binding capacity in either enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. These results suggest that the IgE binding ability of hevein is essentially determined by its N-terminal and C-terminal regions and that major IgE-binding epitopes of hevein are conformational.

This knowledge is crucial when designing tools and strategies for allergen-specific immunotherapy or vaccination. Natural rubber latex (NRL)1allergy has become increasingly common during the last decade, and a large proportion of the general population is regularly exposed to NRL. In particular, health care workers (up to 17%) and children with a history of multiple surgeries (up to 60%) are reported to be sensitized to NRL products (1Palosuo T. Mäkinen-Kiljunen S. Alenius H. Reunala T. Yip E. Turjanmaa K. Allergy. 1998; 53: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 2Ylitalo L. Alenius H. Turjanmaa K. Palosuo T. Reunala T. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2000; 30: 1611-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Although several NRL allergens have recently been characterized at the molecular level, consensus exists that hevein (Hev b6.02) is one of the most important NRL allergens (3Chen Z. Duser M. Flagge A. Maryska S. Sander I. Raulf-Heimsoth M. Baur X. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 2000; 123: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar,4Alenius H. Kalkkinen N. Lukka M. Reunala T. Turjanmaa K. Mäkinen-Kiljunen S. Yip E. Palosuo T. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 1995; 25: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Hevein (4.7 kDa, 43 amino acids) is the most predominant protein in liquid latex obtained from the rubber tree Hevea brasiliensis. Hevein is involved in latex coagulation, and it may play a key role as a defense protein in the protection of wound sites by inhibiting the growth of chitin-containing fungi. Hevein has been found to elute in large quantities from NRL products (5Alenius H. Mäkinen-Kiljunen S. Turjanmaa K. Palosuo T. Reunala T. Ann. Allergy. 1994; 73: 315-320PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of hevein as a latex allergen is supported by the findings that >70% of latex-allergic patients have hevein IgE antibodies (6Alenius H. Kalkkinen N. Reunala T. Turjanmaa K. Palosuo T. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1618-1625PubMed Google Scholar) and that hevein elicits positive skin prick test reactions in the great majority of latex-allergic patients (1Palosuo T. Mäkinen-Kiljunen S. Alenius H. Reunala T. Yip E. Turjanmaa K. Allergy. 1998; 53: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Hevein is therefore a useful tool in the diagnosis of latex allergy as well as a potential candidate for immunotherapy. Treatment options for allergic diseases are currently based mainly on allergen avoidance and the use of corticosteroids and antihistamines to control inflammation and asthma. Whereas allergen-specific immunotherapy using authentic IgE-binding allergens is effective in controlling some allergies, the high risk of systemic reactions during therapy remains a serious problem. Recently, attempts have been made to eliminate IgE-binding sites of allergens while retaining their T-cell-stimulating sites (7Vrtala S. Akdis C.A. Budak F. Akdis M. Blaser K. Kraft D. Valenta R. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6653-6659Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 8King T.P. Jim S.Y. Monsalve R.I. Kagey-Sobotka A. Lichtenstein L.M. Spangfort M.D. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6057-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In order to design a safe reagent for allergen-specific immunotherapy, it is crucial to characterize in detail the IgE-binding epitopes of the allergen. To date, in most studies, identification of IgE-binding epitopes has been performed using short synthetic overlapping peptides that cover the whole allergen sequence. Although this approach can be very helpful in identifying linear T-cell epitopes, its value is limited in B-cell epitope mapping. This is due to the fact that most, if not all, IgE epitopes are reported to be conformational and thus cannot properly be studied using linear peptides (9Aalberse R.C. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2000; 106: 228-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 10Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Methods. 1996; 9: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). An inherent requirement for studying conformational epitopes is knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of the allergen. In the present study, we describe a novel allergen epitope mapping strategy for the characterization of conformational IgE-binding epitopes of hevein. By combining protein engineering and modeling-based design, we were able to transfer hevein-specific IgE binding activity to a nonallergenic adaptor protein. Finally, by using this approach, N-terminal and C-terminal regions of hevein were shown to contain the major conformational IgE-binding epitopes of hevein. Hevein-like domains in the Swiss-Prot Protein Sequence Database were identified by using the advanced BLAST search service provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information. On the basis of the multiple sequence alignment by Clustal X (11Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35038) Google Scholar), the structures of hevein-like domains were also obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information service and used for additional studies. The three-dimensional structures of hevein from the rubber tree H. brasiliensis (hevein, Protein Data Bank access code1HEV, Ref. 12Andersen N.H. Cao B. Rodriguez-Romero A. Arreguin B.

Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10274) Google Scholar) was used to construct three-dimensional model structures of the four chimeras. All four chimera models were energy-minimized using the GROMOS96 43a1 force field and deepest descent method in GROMACS2.0 (18Berendsen H.J.C. Van der Spoel D. Van Drunen R. Comp. Phys. Comm. 1995; 91: 43-56Crossref Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). After minimization, the structures were further refined with 400 ps of molecular dynamics simulation to obtain better packing of the chimeras and to identify any gross problems in the folded model structures. Structure representations were prepared with InsightII 98.0 software (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA) and RASTER3D (19Merritt E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 177: 505-524Crossref Scopus (3865) Google Scholar). Peptides spanning the entire hevein protein were purchased from MedProbe (Oslo, Norway). They include three peptides of 11 (linN), 21 (lincore), and 11 (linC) amino acids in length, corresponding to the hevein N terminus EQCGRQAGGKL (residues 1–11), the hevein core CPNNLCCSQWGWCGSTDEYCS (residues 12–32), or the hevein C terminus PDHNCQSNCKD (residues 33–43), and the corresponding peptides in which each cysteine residue was replaced with a serine. The recombinant form of hevein, AMP, and AMP chimeras were produced as chicken avidin (Av) fusion proteins for efficient purification from the insect cells using a baculovirus expression system (Bac-To-BacTM Baculovirus Expression System; Invitrogen) as described previously (20Airenne K.J. Laitinen O.H. Alenius H. Mikkola J. Kalkkinen N. Arif S.A. Yeang H.Y. Palosuo T. Kulomaa M.S. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 17: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To introduce a cleavage site for thrombin and the selected region of hevein (Table I), the PCR primers were designed and checked with the Amplify2 program.

Nucleotides coding hevein residues are shown in lowercase letters, restriction enzyme sites (BamHI,HindIII, EcoRI, and SalI) are underlined, and thrombin cleavage sites are in italic. Recombinant AMP and AMPcore were constructed by PCR by multiplying the two annealed oligonucleotides (AMP1/EcoRI and AMP2/SalI, AMPcoreI and AMPcoreII) in the absence of a template. Recombinant AMP was used as a template for the AMPN and AMPC constructs. Recombinant hevein was amplified from hevein cDNA in the PIIProhev vector with the forward Prohev6 and reverse Prohev2 primers. All PCR reactions were conducted in a volume of 50 μl containing the template (10 ng), deoxynucleotide triphosphates (200 μm each), the primers (100 nmol each) (Table I), 10×Pfu polymerase buffer, and 2 units of Pfu DNA polymerase. The following cycling conditions were used in all cases: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min following 30 cycles (1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 50 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C) and final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. After the PCR amplification, the products were digested with BamHI and HindIII restriction enzymes (Promega, Madison, WI). Digests were extracted from 1.5% agarose gel, ligated into theBamHI/HindIII-treated pBacAVs+C vector (20Airenne K.J. Laitinen O.H. Alenius H. Mikkola J. Kalkkinen N. Arif S.A. Yeang H.Y. Palosuo T. Kulomaa M.S. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 17: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and transformed into JM109 Escherichia coli cells. The recombinant vectors were named AvHev, AvAMP, AvAMPN, AvAMPC, AvAMPN+C, AvAMPcore. The nucleotide sequence of the constructs was always confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing with an automated Li-Cor DNA sequencer (Li-Cor Biotechnology Division, Lincoln, NE). The vectors were transformed into E. coli strain DHC10Bac to construct the recombinant baculo bacmids. After blue/white selection, positive colonies were grown in 5 ml of Luria-Bertani/gentamycin + kanamycin sulfate for bacmid isolation. The viruses were completed during transfection according to the manufacturer's instructions for the Bac-To-BacTM Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen). To produce recombinant proteins, about 4 × 108Sf9 cells (ATCC CRL 1711) in SF-900 II SFM serum-free culture medium (Invitrogen) depleted of biotin were seeded to a final volume of 200 ml in a 1- or 2-liter Erlenmeyer flask. Recombinant viruses were added to give a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 plaque-forming unit/cell. Infection was allowed to continue at 28 °C and 110 rpm agitation for 72 h. Purification of fusion proteins was performed in principle as described previously (20Airenne K.J. Laitinen O.H. Alenius H. Mikkola J. Kalkkinen N. Arif S.A. Yeang H.Y. Palosuo T. Kulomaa M.S. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 17: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The cell pellet was resuspended in 80 ml of HilloI buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl). During the purification, a 75-μl aliquot was taken from the sonicated total cell lysate (sample T), from the residual cell pellet after resuspension in 20 ml of the same buffer and sonication (S), before binding to resin (L1), after adjusting the pH (L2), and after binding to resin (L3). The intracellular fusion proteins bound on the 2-iminobiotin-agarose (Sigma) were washed once with 20 ml of binding buffer (50 mm Na2CO3, pH 11, and 1m NaCl) and twice in the column with 10 ml of the same buffer. 2-Iminobiotin-agarose was used instead of a biotin resin because avidin binds to biotin in an irreversible manner (K a , ∼10−15m−1) (21Green N.M. Adv. Protein Chem. 1975; 29: 85-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar) that prevents the release of the intact fusion protein from the column. Avidin binds to 2-iminobiotin in a pH-dependent manner and can thus be released from the resin by lowering pH (22Orr G.A. Heney G.C. Zeheb R. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 122: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). One-ml fractions of constructs were eluted from the column with the elution buffer (50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 4, and 0.5m NaCl), and 20-μl aliquots were analyzed in SDS-PAGE gels. AvHev, AvAMP, and all AvChimer fusion proteins were run on 15% denaturing SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot analysis using an avidin antibody (1:4000) as a primary antibody and goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:2000) as a secondary antibody. Depending on the method to be used next, the buffer of the fusion proteins was changed to fresh 25 or 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 8) with a desalting column HR10/10 (Amersham Biosciences) or Fast Desalting (Amersham Biosciences). Samples were concentrated with an Ultrafree-MC (30,000 NMWL filter unit; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) vacuum evaporator or with a MICROSEP (Pall Filtron Corp.). All of the fusion proteins were digested with an excess of thrombin (AmershamBiosciences) overnight at 37 °C. Thrombin-cleaved recombinant hevein, recombinant AMP, and chimeras were analyzed by reversed-phase chromatography on a PepRP 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) using a linear gradient of acetonitrile (0–40% in 40 min) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min. Eluted fractions were monitored at 214 nm. The separated peptides were collected and further analyzed by mass spectrometry and N-terminal amino acid sequencing (ABI 494 A ProciseTM Sequencer; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was carried out using a Bruker Biflex II (Bruker-Daltonic, Bremen, Germany) instrument. About 1 pmol (0.5 μl) of the HPLC-purified peptides was applied to a thin-layer matrix preparation (0.5 μl of saturated cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in acetone) and air-dried. External calibration was performed with insulin (Sigma). Serum specimens were obtained from 16 NRL-allergic patients (15 women and 1 man; mean age, 46 years; age range, 16–70 years), all of whom were previously shown to have IgE against hevein. All of the patients had positive skin prick test responses to natural hevein. Sera from 19 control subjects without NRL allergy were used in the ELISA studies. ELISA was performed as described previously (6Alenius H. Kalkkinen N. Reunala T. Turjanmaa K. Palosuo T. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1618-1625PubMed Google Scholar). Purified recombinant hevein, recombinant AMP, or chimeras were diluted in 50 mmol/liter carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. The proteins were placed onto a polystyrene microtiter plate (100 μl/well; Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) and incubated at room temperature (20–23 °C) for 3 h or overnight at 4 °C. The wells were emptied, and the remaining protein binding sites were blocked with 1% human serum albumin (HAS; Finnish Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Helsinki, Finland) in 50 mm carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, at room temperature for 1 h. After rinsing three times, 100 μl of serum (diluted 1:20 with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.02% Tween 20 and 0.2% HSA) from a NRL-sensitive individual or from a negative control person was added to the well and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The wells were washed again, and biotinylated goat anti-human IgE (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA; diluted 1:1000 with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.02% Tween 20 and 0.2% HSA) was added and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After washing again, streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad; diluted 1:3000) was added and incubated for 1 h. The substrate,p-nitro-phenyl phosphate (Sigma), was added, and the absorbance was read at 405 nm by using an automated ELISA reader (Titertek Multiskan, Eflab, Finland). The mean ± 3 S.D. of the controls was chosen as the threshold value for a positive result. The inhibition ELISA was performed as described previously (6Alenius H. Kalkkinen N. Reunala T. Turjanmaa K. Palosuo T. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1618-1625PubMed Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Hevein or chimeras (AMPN, AMPC, and AMPN+C) were applied to microtiter plates at a concentration of 2 μg/ml. The ELISA inhibition was performed with eight different inhibitors (AMPN, AMPC, AMPN+C, linN, lincore, linC, pool of linN and linC, and hevein) at four different concentrations (0.0001, 0.01, 1, and 10 μg/ml for all inhibitors and also 100 μg/ml for the linear peptides). Sera (diluted 1:10) were obtained from six patients that recognized AMPN and/or AMPC chimeras. Streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) was diluted 1:1000 (with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.02% Tween 20 and 0.2% HSA) and used as a secondary antibody. Substrate-produced color was read at 405 nm using an automated ELISA reader (Multiskan MS, Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland). Allergen structures involved in IgE binding can be indirectly analyzed by comparing the IgE binding abilities of structurally related proteins. To find hevein homologues that could be used in the analysis of conformational IgE-binding regions, we first analyzed hevein-related proteins by a sequence alignment program (Clustal X). The central area of hevein showed the most extensive conservation between the homologues (data not shown). Because knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of the allergen is essential for the study of conformational epitopes, we analyzed further only those hevein homologues whose three-dimensional structure had been solved (23Broekaert W.F. Marien W. Terras F.R., De Bolle M.F. Proost P. Van Damme J. Dillen L. Claeys M. Rees S.B. Vanderleyden J. et al.Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4308-4314Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Although hevein-like domains commonly occur in a variety of plant proteins, AMP (30 amino acids) from the amaranth Amaranthus caudatus was found to be the only monomeric hevein homologue with a known three-dimensional structure and a size relatively close to that of hevein (hevein, 43 amino acids). In the sequence comparison, the core regions of AMP (residues 9–28) and hevein (residues 12–31) are highly conserved (Fig. 1). In contrast, both the N terminus (residues 1–8) and C terminus (residues 28–30) of AMP differ markedly from the corresponding regions in hevein (residues 1–12 and 32–43, respectively). Because sequence comparison gives only indirect structural information, we compared the three-dimensional structures of hevein and AMP. The Protein Data Bank file contains six alternative NMR structures for hevein (12Andersen N.H. Cao B. Rodriguez-Romero A. Arreguin B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1407-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Structure 4 was used for all the comparisons because the majority of its residues had acceptable conformations according to WHATCHECK. The same procedure was used to select AMP NMR structure 16 (Protein Data Bank access code 1MMC) (13Martins J.C. Maes D. Loris R. Pepermans H.A. Wyns L. Willem R. Verheyden P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 322-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The structural alignment of hevein and AMP was performed using VERTAA in the BODIL modeling environment (Fig. 2). The superimposed three-dimensional structures show that the backbone α-carbons of hevein (between residues 12 and 31) and AMP (between residues 19 and 28) occupy very similar positions in space relative to each other (Fig.2). However, substantial differences in the structures were observed at the N-terminal and C-terminal ends of the two proteins, which is in good agreement with the results obtained from the sequence alignment. To study the immunological properties of AMP, it was extracted from amaranth seeds and purified by affinity chromatography on a chitin column and reversed-phase HPLC as described previously for hevein (24Hänninen A.R. Mikkola J.H. Kalkkinen N. Turjanmaa K. Ylitalo L. Reunala T. Palosuo T. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1999; 104: 194-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The molecular mass (3184.8 Da) of the purified protein corresponded to that calculated from the AMP sequence with three disulfide bonds (3183.7 Da). The analyzed N-terminal sequence of 20 residues was identical to the known AMP sequence (AMP2, Swiss-Prot: P27275). The ability of purified AMP to bind hevein-specific IgE was analyzed using sera obtained from NRL-allergic patients with hevein IgE antibodies. Only 1 of 16 patients and 0 of 19 controls showed IgE binding to native AMP in ELISA (data not shown). To test the IgE binding capacity of the core and terminal regions of hevein, four hevein-AMP chimeras (AMPN, AMPC, AMPN+C, and AMPcore) were designed, as shown in Fig. 3. On the basis of their structural alignment, three-dimensional models of the chimeras were constructed, energy-minimized, and subjected to molecular dynamics simulation to improve side chain packing and identify bad contacts. No bad contacts were observed, and residues with poor geometry were identified with WHATCHECK (WHATIF, Ref. 25Vriend G. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 8 (29): 52-56Google Scholar) and corrected. The schematic representations of the model structures and their surface models are shown in Fig. 3. The modeled structures were used to evaluate the viability of the chimeric constructs. No problems with either packing or side chain interactions were seen when the four chimeras were compared with hevein and AMP. Major differences occur in the N-terminal sequences of hevein and AMP, but these differences were not expected to interfere with the stable folding or packing of the chimeric constructs. Both proteins have a cysteine residue within this segment that forms a disulfide bond with the core region. The first two amino acid residues of AMP are not present in hevein; these residues do not seem to have any critical role in the fold. The core region in each of the chimera models is nearly identical to the structures of hevein and AMP, and moreover, it was possible to build the disulfide bonds in each model in a way similar to those in the NMR structures of hevein and AMP (Fig. 2). The C-terminal part of hevein contains 10 extra amino acids as compared with AMP (Fig.1). Hevein has one additional disulfide bond (Cys37 to Cys41), and the amino acids Gln38-Ser39-Asn40 contribute an extra strand to the β-sheet (Fig. 2). In addition to the interactions mentioned above, the C-terminal part of hevein forms no internal interactions that would be affected by the chimeric constructs. All constructs (recombinant AMP, recombinant HEV, and the four chimeras) were then cloned and produced in insect cells using the Bac-To-BacTM Baculovirus Expression System. Chicken avidin was used as an N-terminal fusion partner for easier affinity purification of the recombinant proteins. After purification, the avidin tag was cleaved from the fusion proteins by protease thrombin. To confirm the correct structure and disulfide bridges of the products, all hevein-AMP chimeras were analyzed by N-terminal sequencing and MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy. After thrombin cleavage, all recombinant proteins had the correct N-terminal amino acid sequence. The measured molecular masses of the recombinant proteins corresponded to the calculated ones, suggesting that the correct number of disulfide bridges are present in recombinant hevein and AMP as well as in all of the hevein-AMP chimeras (data not shown). To study the immunological properties of the recombinant allergens, ELISA tests were performed for recombinant hevein and AMP, for all of the chimeras, and for the three synthetic linear peptides of hevein. The binding of IgE to recombinant hevein corresponded to that of native hevein (data not shown). In agreement with the results with native AMP, only 1 of the 16 sera from hevein-allergic patients showed weak IgE binding to recombinant AMP (Fig. 4). These results indicated that the IgE binding ability of recombinant hevein and AMP was virtually identical to that of their native counterparts. Two of the 16 patients (13%) with IgE antibodies against hevein showed IgE binding to the AMP chimera containing hevein core region (AMPcore). This suggests that only a very few hevein-allergic patients develop IgE response to epitopes present in the hevein core region (Fig. 4). The chimeric AMPN with the N terminus of hevein (residues 1–11) was recognized by 1"

We have assessed functional and physical interactions between Tat and the Egr family of transcription factors (Egr-1, -2, and -3), the latter two of which are major participants in activation-induced FasL up-regulation. Here we report that whereas Tat itself has no effect on the FasL promoter, it binds to Egr-2 and -3 and synergizes with them to superinduce expression of a FasL promoter-driven reporter. A Tat molecule containing a single amino acid substitution that results in the loss of transactivation activity for the HIV long terminal repeat still binds Egr-3 but can no longer enhance Egr-mediated transactivation of the FasL promoter. Furthermore, the mutated Tat acts as a dominant negative inhibitor, blocking the superinduction of FasL caused by wild type Tat. Because Tat is present in virus-infected cells and in the serum of HIV-infected individuals, these results suggest that increased expression of FasL in these circumstances may result from the cooperative activities of activation-induced Egrs and Tat.

The regulated apoptosis of peripheral lymphocytes is necessary to maintain a competent and tolerant immune system (1Russell J.H. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 382-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The predominant signaling pathway involved in achieving this is initiated by the engagement of the “death receptor” Fas (CD95) with its ligand, FasL 1The abbreviations used are: FasLFas ligandLTRlong terminal repeatFLREFasL response elementGSTglutathione S-transferasePBMCperipheral blood mononuclear cellsHIVhuman immunodeficiency virus (2Nagata S. Golstein P. Science. 1995; 267: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3979) Google Scholar). Because Fas-mediated apoptosis is irreversible it must be tightly regulated. Fas and its downstream signaling machinery are present in most cells, and regulation occurs both pre- and post-Fas engagement (3Tschopp J. Irmler M. Thome M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). For T cells, one of the major levels of control is exerted at the level of FasL expression. FasL mRNA is not expressed in resting T cells but is induced shortly after an activating stimulus (4Suda T. Takahashi T. Golstein P. Nagata S. Cell. 1993; 75: 1169-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2448) Google Scholar). The up-regulation of Fas ligand is responsible for activation-induced apoptosis of certain T cell lines, T cell hybridomas, and pre-activated T cells (5Ju S.T. Matsui K. Ozdemirli M. Int. Rev.

We have found that the Egr family members Egr-2 and Egr-3, but not the more abundant Egr-1, are essential for activation-induced up-regulation of FasL (17Mittelstadt P.R. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3744-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 18Mittelstadt P.R. Ashwell J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3222-3227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Egrs are a family of inducible transcription factors that require de novo mRNA and protein synthesis to be expressed. Whereas Egr-1 can be induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate alone (by activating protein kinase C), in T cells an elevation of intracellular Ca2+ is also required to induce Egr-2 and -3 (19Mages H.W. Stamminger T. Rilke O. Bravo R. Kroczek R.A. Int. Immunol. 1993; 5: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This is because Egr-2 and –3 are transcriptionally regulated by NF-AT, as evidenced by the fact that their promoters contain NF-AT binding sites, their induction is inhibited by cyclosporin A, and their expression is impaired in NF-ATc/NF-ATp-deficient animals (17Mittelstadt P.R. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3744-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 20Rengarajan J. Mittelstadt P.R. Mages H.W. Gerth A.J. Kroczek R.A. Ashwell J.D. Glimcher L.H. Immunity. 2000; 12: 293-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In fact, much of the NF-AT dependence of FasL transcription itself may be secondary to the NF-AT dependence of these important transcriptional regulators. The FasL promoter has an Egr binding site 207–214 bp upstream of the transcriptional initiation site. This site must be intact for activation to induce downstream reporter gene, and transient overexpression of Egr-2 or -3 alone is sufficient to induce FasL mRNA expression in epithelial cell lines (17Mittelstadt P.R. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3744-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 18Mittelstadt P.R. Ashwell J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3222-3227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Tat is an HIV-encoded transcriptional activator required for replication of the viral genome (21Cullen B.R. Cell. 1990; 63: 655-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The major effect of Tat on HIV gene transcription is to increase the efficiency of elongation after binding to the transactivation response element in viral RNA (22Jones K.A. Peterlin B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 717-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The association of Tat with the transactivation response element and the complex of Cdk9 and cyclin T facilitate the phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II and therefore enhance elongation (23Bieniasz P.D. Grdina T.A. Bogerd H.P. Cullen B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7791-7796Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 24Karn J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 235-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The N-terminal portion (amino acids 1–48) of Tat is an activation domain that can function as a transactivator when fused with heterologous DNA- or RNA-binding proteins (25Jeang K.T. Xiao H. Rich E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28837-28840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), apparently because of its ability to bind the Cdk9-cyclin T complex. It has also been shown that Tat may exert its action on gene transcription through associated factors such as Tip30 (26Xiao H. Palhan V. Yang Y. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 956-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). HIV-infected cells can secrete Tat, and many studies have shown that exogenous Tat has a variety of profound effects on different cells. Among the direct biological activities attributed to Tat are increased NF-κB binding to DNA and release of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 from astrocytes (27Conant K. Garzino-Demo A. Nath A.

Immunol. 1998; 35: 1171-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Given the evidence that FasL-Fas interactions may account for bystander killing of T cells in patients infected with HIV (35Yang Y. Ashwell J.D. Apoptosis. 2000; 6: 137-144Google Scholar), one of the more intriguing activities ascribed to Tat is that it synergizes with T cell activating stimuli in the up-regulation of FasL expression (36Westendorp M.O. Frank R. Ochsenbauer C. Stricker K. Dhein J. Walczak H. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Nature. 1995; 375: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). In this study, we asked if the ability of Tat to synergize with activation to superinduce FasL reflects an interaction, direct or indirect, with Egr family transcription factors. Here we report that Tat physically interacts with all Egr family members and synergizes with Egr-2 and –3 but not Egr-1 to increase the expression of a reporter gene driven by the FasL promoter, an activity that depends upon both an intact Egr binding site in the promoter and the transactivation activity of Tat. Furthermore, a transactivation-deficient form of Tat acts as a dominant negative, abrogating the ability of native Tat to co-activate the FasL promoter. These results provide a molecular mechanism for the ability of Tat to synergistically enhance FasL expression, and they suggest a possible means for interfering with this phenomenon. Human cervical adenocarcinoma cell line HeLa was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA) supplemented with 4 mm glutamine, 50 μm2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml of penicillin, 150 μg/ml of gentamicin, and 10% fetal calf serum. The luciferase reporter plasmid pGL-3 containing the 16-bp FLRE (Fas ligand response element) or the 511-bp fragment of the human FasL promoter region was constructed as described (17Mittelstadt P.R. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3744-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In the mutated FLRE reporter, four nucleotides (GTGG) at the center of 16-bp FLRE were replaced with CACC (17Mittelstadt P.R. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3744-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The expression plasmids encoding NGFI-A (Egr-1), Egr-2, and Egr-3 have been reported previously (37Russo M.W. Matheny C. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6858-6865Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For in vitro translation, the cDNAs of Egr-1 and -2 were subcloned into pCI-neo using SmaI and Mlu/Xba sites, respectively. The cDNA of Egr-3 was inserted into the Hin dIII/BamHI site of pSP73. The plasmid pGEX-tat (containing cDNAs encoding Tat 1–72) was kindly provided by Dinah Singer and Jocelyn Weissman (National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD). The constructs pGEX-tat 1–48 and pGEX-tat 49–72 were made by generating corresponding cDNAs using PCR and inserting them into the EcoRI/NotI site of pGEX-4T-1. To generate other GST-Tat fragments (Tat-(1–20), Tat-(10–30), Tat-(20–40), and Tat-(30–48) double-stranded oligonucleotides encoding the corresponding amino acids were synthesized and cloned into pGEX-4T-1 with EcoRI/NotI sites. The constructs pGEX-tat K41T (containing cDNA encoding Tat 1–86) has been described previously (38Xiao H. Tao Y. Greenblatt J. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2146-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The expression vectors pCI-Tat and pCI-Tat(K41T) were made by cloning corresponding cDNAs into EcoRI/NotI sites of pCI-neo. The GST fusion proteins were induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside in Escherichia coli DH5α, transformed with the indicated pGEX constructs, and purified with glutathione beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). In vitro translation of Egr-1, Egr-2, and Egr-3 was performed with T7 polymerase and TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate systems (Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence of [35S]methionine. For binding assays, bead-bound GST fusion proteins were incubated with in vitro-translated products at 4 °C for 2 h. After washing four times with Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.05% Tween 20, the beads were heated at 100 °C for 3 min in 2× SDS loading buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol). Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized using a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). For transfection of HeLa cells, triplicate 200-μl cultures were transfected with 100 ng of the luciferase reporter plasmids and the indicated expression plasmids by the calcium phosphate technique (39Jordan M. Schallhorn A. Wurm F.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). In some experiments, a pSV-β-galactosidase reporter was cotransfected as a control of transfection efficiency. In transfection experiments using 6-well tissue culture cluster, 250 ng of FLRE-luciferase reporter and 250 ng of egr-3-expressing constructs were cotransfected with LipofectAMINE2000 (Invitrogen). Luciferase activity was determined as relative fluorescence units using Promega luciferase assay substrates (Promega) and a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). Error bars in the figures represent the S.E. of the arithmetic means. For immunoprecipitation, HeLa cells expressing Tat and Egr-1 or -3 were lysed with radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mmphosphate, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with protease inhibitors aprotinin (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), and AEBSF (4-(20aminoethyl)benzene sulfonyl fluoride; 1 mm). After centrifugation and removal of the insoluble pellets, the lysates were diluted with phosphate-buffered saline (1:5) and added to protein A beads that have been precoated with anti-Egr-1 or anti-Egr-3 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Following incubation at 4 °C for 2 h the beads were washed with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20. The bead-bound proteins were then heated at 100 °C for 3 min in 2× SDS loading buffer and separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Immunoblotting was performed as described (40Yang Y. Liu Z. Tolosa E. Yang J. Li L. Immunopharmacology. 1998; 40: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected cells were harvested and lysed with radioimmune precipitation buffer. After centrifugation and removal of the insoluble pellets, the lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE (16%) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Monoclonal anti-Tat antibody (Immuno Diagnostics, Woburn, MA) was used to detect expressed Tat. The blot was visualized with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Ectopic expression of Egr-2 or Egr-3 but not Egr-1 can induce expression of luciferase reporters driven by the 511-bp sequence of FasL promoter or the 16-bp FLRE (Egr binding site) in the FasL promoter. To determine whether Tat can synergize with Egrs in transactivating the FasL promoter, HeLa cells were cotransfected with a luciferase reporter construct containing the 511-bp FasL promoter and vectors expressing Tat with or without Egr-1, Egr-2, or Egr-3 (Fig. 1 A). A suboptimal amount of Egr cDNA was used to enhance the detection of synergy, if any, between these transcription factors and Tat. Expression of Tat alone had no effect on reporter activity, and the limiting amounts of Egr-2 or -3 used resulted in only a 2.1- and 2.3-fold induction of the luciferase activity, respectively (Fig. 1 A). When Egr-2 or Egr-3 and Tat were coexpressed, however, there was an 8- to 10-fold up-regulation of FasL promoter activity. To determine whether Egr binding to its previously identified cognate site in the FasL promoter was involved in this synergy, experiments were performed with a luciferase reporter driven by the 16-bp FLRE alone (Fig. 1 B). Egr-2 and –3 induced a 2- to 2.5-fold enhancement in reporter activity. Furthermore, similar to the full-length 511-bp FasL promoter, whereas Tat by itself had no effect on luciferase activity, it substantially increased reporter activity when coexpressed with either of these Egr family members. It has been shown that although Egr-1 binds the FLRE, it is incapable of inducing FLRE (or FasL promoter)-dependent transcriptional activity (17Mittelstadt P.R. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3744-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked if Tat could also synergize with Egr-1 in FasL induction. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the combination of Tat and Egr-1 had no effect on the FLRE-driven reporter. This combination also had little effect on a reporter driven by the full 511-bp FasL promoter (Fig. 1 A). The requirement for direct binding of Egr-2 and –3 binding to the FLRE was tested using a mutated FLRE in which four nucleotide substitutions prevent its interaction with Egr family members. As shown in Fig. 1 C, this reporter construct was not induced by Egr family members, and the further addition of Tat had no effect. Those results demonstrate that HIV Tat synergizes with Egr-2 and –3 to activate the FasL promoter and that this requires the binding of the Egrs to the FLRE in the FasL promoter. Because Tat enhancement of FasL promoter transcription depends on the concomitant presence of Egr-2 or -3, we asked whether these molecules interact physically. In vitro-translated 35S-labeled Egr family proteins were incubated with glutathione beads coated with a GST-Tat fusion protein or with GST alone. After thorough washing, bound proteins were eluted by heating at 100 °C for 3 min in the presence of 2× loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. GST protein alone retained little if any of the Egr proteins (Fig. 2 A), whereas beads coated with GST-Tat protein pulled down 35S-labeled Egr-1, -2, and -3. To determine whether Egrs can bind Tat under more physiologic conditions (i.e. in cells), Egr-1 or Egr-3 was cotransfected with Tat into HeLa cells (Fig. 2 B). When these molecules were coexpressed, anti-Egr-1 (lane 4) and anti-Egr-3 (lane 6) specifically co-precipitated Tat. Together these results demonstrate that Egrs bind Tat in vitro and in vivo. The region of Tat that binds the Egrs was mapped with GST fusion proteins containing subregions of the Tat molecule. Initially, two portions of Tat were analyzed: residues 1–48, essential for the transactivating properties of Tat and for binding to the Cdk9-cyclin T complex (41Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar); and residues 49–72, which contains the basic and glutamine-rich domains of Tat and is involved in transactivation response RNA binding, nuclear localization, and transmembrane transport (25Jeang K.T. Xiao H. Rich E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28837-28840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 A). In vitro-translated Egr-3 was added to beads coated with similar amounts of GST alone, GST-Tat, GST-Tat-(1–48), or GST-Tat-(49–72) (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–4). GST-Tat-(1–48) and GST-Tat-(1–72) bound Egr-3, but GST-Tat-(49–72) failed to do so. Furthermore, analysis with GST-Tat fusion proteins containing overlapping fragments of Tat revealed that Tat residues 20–40 and 30–48 bound Egr-3, whereas Tat residues 10–30 did not (Fig. 3 B, lanes 5–8). The binding of GST-Tat fragments with Egr-1 and Egr-2 was also examined. As shown in Fig. 3 C, both Egr-1 and Egr-2 bound GST-Tat-(20–40) but failed to bind either GST-Tat-(10–30) or GST-Tat-(49–72). Therefore, all three Egrs interact with a region of Tat encompassed by residues 20–40, and this region was further refined to amino acids 30–40 by its binding to Egr-3. Because this region is vital for Tat-mediated gene transactivation, these results suggest that direct interaction between the activation domain of Tat and Egrs is responsible for the superinduction of the FasL promoter. Substitution of Tat Lys-41 with a threonine residue eliminates its ability to promote transcription of the HIV LTR (42Kuppuswamy M. Subramanian T. Srinivasan A. Chinnadurai G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3551-3561Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Because this residue is vital for Tat-induced gene transactivation, we asked whether Tat lacking Lys-41 could still interact with Egr-3 and enhance FLRE-dependent transcription. As predicted by the analysis of the binding of Tat fragments (Fig. 3, B and C), Tat containing an amino acid substitution at residue 41 was similar to wild type Tat in its ability to bind Egr-3 (Fig. 4 A). However, unlike wild type Tat, Tat(K41T) was unable to up-regulate Egr-3-dependent induction of a FLRE-driven luciferase (Fig. 4 B). Thus, the capacity of Tat to transactivate is required for synergism with Egrs. The fact that Tat(K41T) was able to bind Egr-3 but unable to superinduce gene transcription raised the possibility that this mutant might act as a dominant negative inhibitor of wild type Tat. This was tested by determining whether expression of Tat(K41T) could affect the superinduction of a FLRE-driven reporter by wild type Tat and Egr-3. As shown in Fig. 5 A, wild type Tat but not Tat(K41T) synergized with Egr-3 in the enhancement of luciferase activity. Moreover, expression of pCI-Tat(K41T) prevented the superinduction of luciferase activity. This was not due to any effect on the expression of wild type Tat, because the levels of Tat were the same whether or not Tat(K41T) was coexpressed (Fig. 5 B). The Tat K41T migrates more slowly than the wild type Tat because it contains an additional 14 amino acids, which do not otherwise affect the synergy between Tat and Egrs (data not shown). Taken together, these data argue that binding of transactivation-competent HIV Tat to the biologically active Egrs (Egr-2 and –3) is necessary for synergism between these two transcriptional regulators at induction of the FasL promoter. Depletion of CD4+ T cells is a hallmark of HIV infection. It appears that multiple mechanisms are responsible for the depletion of T cells (43Gougeon M.L. Montagnier L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 887: 199-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Given the critical importance of Fas and FasL in regulating the homeostasis of peripheral T cells, many studies have been carried out to investigate potential roles in HIV-induced T cell death (35Yang Y. Ashwell J.D. Apoptosis. 2000; 6: 137-144Google Scholar). It has been shown that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from HIV-infected individuals express higher levels of Fas and are more susceptible to Fas-mediated apoptosis (44Debatin K.M. Fahrig-Faissner A. Enenkel-Stoodt S. Kreuz W. Benner A. Krammer P.H. Blood. 1994; 83: 3101-3103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Katsikis P.D. Wunderlich E.S. Smith C.A. Herzenberg L.A. Herzenberg L.A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 2029-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Increased levels of FasL have also been detected in plasma and PBMC from HIV-infected individuals (46Mitra D. Steiner M. Lynch D.H. Staiano-Coico L. Laurence J. Immunology. 1996; 87: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 47Baumler C.B. Bohler T. Herr I. Benner A. Krammer P.H. Debatin K.M. Blood. 1996; 88: 1741-1746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Sloand E.M. Young N.S. Kumar P. Weichold F.F. Sato T. Maciejewski J.P. Blood. 1997; 89: 1357-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Hosaka N. Oyaizu N. Kaplan M.H. Yagita H. Pahwa S. J. Infect. Dis. 1998; 178: 1030-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The extent of increased expression of FasL on PBMC correlates with disease progression, being greater in those with relatively low CD4+ T cell counts (<200 cells/ml) (50Silvestris F. Camarda G. Cafforio P. Dammacco F. AIDS. 1998; 12: 1103-1104PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the higher level of FasL expression on PBMC from HIV-infected children was reduced by anti-retroviral therapy (51Bohler T. Herr I. Debatin K.M. Geiss M. Haas J. Blood. 1997; 90: 886-888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that up-regulation of FasL may contribute to the depletion of T cells in HIV-infected individuals. The means by which HIV infection leads to increase of FasL expression is controversial. In vitro, cross-linking of CD4 up-regulates Fas and FasL on PBMC and induces cell death, which can be prevented by F(ab′)2 fragments of anti-Fas antibodies (52Algeciras A. Dockrell D.H. Lynch D.H. Paya C.V. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Given that HIV gp120 can bind CD4, this suggested a possible mechanism for up-regulation of Fas and FasL in HIV-infected individuals. However, studies using transformed T cell lines and purified normal CD4+ T cells found that the expression of Fas or FasL was not increased following acute HIV infection in vitro(53Glynn J.M. McElligott D.L. Mosier D.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2754-2758PubMed Google Scholar, 54Noraz N. Gozlan J. Corbeil J. Brunner T. Spector S.A.

Med. 1998; 187: 1113-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CD4+ T cells from individuals with genetic defects in Fas expression or signaling were killed normally after HIV infection (56Gandhi R.T. Chen B.K. Straus S.E. Dale J.K. Lenardo M.J. Baltimore D. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1113-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), indicating that Fas and FasL do not participate in T cell death induced by acute HIV infection. It seems that some of the discrepancies are caused by the presence or absence of monocytes. Unlike the situation with T cells, HIV infection of monocytes/macrophages resulted in the up-regulation of FasL, and these infected cells could kill cocultured Fas+ T cells (57Badley A.D. McElhinny J.A. Leibson P.J. Lynch D.H. Alderson M.R. Paya C.V. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 199-206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The increased expression of FasL on monocytes was also observed following CD4 cross-linking, and removal of monocytes from PBMC abrogated T cell apoptosis following CD4 cross-linking (58Oyaizu N. Adachi Y. Hashimoto F. McCloskey T.W. Hosaka N. Kayagaki N. Yagita H. Pahwa S. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2456-2463PubMed Google Scholar). The relevance of these observations to cell death induced by acute HIV infection was further addressed using an HIV strain that also expressed green fluorescent protein in infected cells (68Herbein G. Van Lint C. Lovett J.L. Verdin E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 660-670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas infection of purified lymphocytes induced apoptosis mainly in infected cells, infection in the presence of monocytes caused deaths of uninfected T cells as well. Therefore, it is possible that Fas-FasL interactions contribute to depletion of T cells during HIV infection in vivo. Consistent with this theory, lymph nodes from HIV-infected individuals have higher levels of FasL, which is mainly expressed by macrophages (59Dockrell D.H. Badley A.D. Villacian J.S. Heppelmann C.J. Algeciras A. Ziesmer S. Yagita H. Lynch D.H. Roche P.C. Leibson P.J. Paya C.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2394-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Tat enhances transcription of the HIV LTR through association with the Cdk9-cyclin T complex, which in turn phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II. If Tat can associate with Egrs and the Cdk9-cyclin T complex at the same time, it is possible that the ability of the Cdk9-cyclin T complex to phosphorylate the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II is responsible for the superinduction of FLRE-driven luciferase. Alternatively, the Tat-associated protein Tip30, which has intrinsic kinase activity and can also phosphorylate the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, may participate in the enhancement of transactivation. The region in Tat that is sufficient for association with Egr-3 appears to be residues 30–40. Coincidentally, it has been found that recombinant Tat-(21–40) alone has multiple activities such as induction of cytopathic changes, transactivation of HIV LTR, and activation of NF-κB (60Boykins R.A. Mahieux R. Shankavaram U.T. Gho Y.S. Lee S.F. Hewlett I.K. Wahl L.M. Kleinman H.K. Brady J.N. Yamada K.M. Dhawan S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 15-20PubMed Google Scholar). It is an interesting speculation that those activities are related to its association with Egr family members. Because lymphocytes from HIV-infected individuals often express activation markers such as HLA-DR, CD45R0, and CD38, it seems likely that up-regulation of FasL in HIV-infected individuals is at least in part the consequence of activation. Given the fact that Tat can be secreted by infected cells and detected in serum from HIV-infected individuals and can cross the plasma membrane of uninfected cells, the observation that exogenous Tat is able to enhance the elevation of FasL mRNA following T cell activation or CD4 cross-linking in vitro suggests that Tat contributes to the up-regulation of FasL in vivo. Tat can enhance NF-κB activation via induction of oxidative stress and down-regulation of Mn2+-dependent superoxide dismutase expression in T cells (61Westendorp M.O. Shatrov V.A. Schulze-Osthoff K. Frank R. Kraft M. Los M. Krammer P.H. Droge W. Lehmann V. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 546-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), suggesting that activation of NF-κB may mediate the synergistic action of T cell activation and HIV Tat in the up-regulation of FasL. This was supported by the finding that NF-κB sites were required for the Tat-mediated increase of transactivation through FasL promoter (62Li-Weber M. Laur O. Dern K. Krammer P.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 661-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The data presented in this report demonstrate a different mechanism for Tat enhancement of FasL expression: synergism with activation-induced Egr-2 and -3. T cell activation and increased FasL expression may also result from virus infection directly. For example, HIV-encoded Nef activates T cells (63Baur A.S. Sawai E.T. Dazin P. Fantl W.J.

Virol. 1997; 71: 6094-6099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) presumably through direct interaction with the ζ chain of the T cell antigen receptor (66Xu X.N. Laffert B. Screaton G.R. Kraft M. Wolf D. Kolanus W. Mongkolsapay J. McMichael A.J. Baur A.S. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1489-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and the HIV-encoded protein Nef have been found to be required for induction of FasL and apoptosis of infected T cells (66Xu X.N. Laffert B. Screaton G.R. Kraft M. Wolf D. Kolanus W. Mongkolsapay J. McMichael A.J. Baur A.S. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1489-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 67Xu X.N. Screaton G.R. Gotch F.M. Dong T. Tan R. Almond N. Walker B. Stebbings R. Kent K. Nagata S. Stott J.E. McMichael A.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is conceivable that Nef induces the Egr family proteins in infected cells and together with Tat up-regulates FasL following HIV infection. If so, interfering with the Tat-Egr interaction might reduce FasL expression and the secondary depletion of T cells during HIV infection.

Sphingolipids participate in a number of important cellular processes that require membrane budding, fission, or vesiculation (1Zha X. Pierini M. Leopold P.L. Skiba P.J. Tabas I. Maxfield F.R. J.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Many recent investigations, by this laboratory and others, have focused on the in-plane lateral interactions among sphingolipids, cholesterol, and other membrane lipids (7Li X.-M. Momsen M.M.

As a result, significant new insights into sphingolipid organization in membranes have emerged, including the identification and characterization of sphingolipid-enriched, liquid-ordered microdomains, often referred to as rafts (11Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar, 12Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2001; 13: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). With so much emphasis on lipid lateral interactions, studies of sphingolipid transmembrane distribution have been relatively few (14Sillence D.J. Raggers R.J. van Meer G. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 312: 562-579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the interrelationships among sphingolipid structure, membrane curvature, and glycosphingolipid transmembrane distribution remain poorly understood (15Maggio B. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1994; 62: 55-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Much of what is currently known about the mechanical forces affecting membrane curvature has been achieved by investigations of phosphoglyceride model membranes (16Sackmann E. Lipowsky R. Sackmann E. Structure and Dynamics of Membranes. 1A. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1995: 213-304Google Scholar). The elastic constants associated with a fluid membrane are the bending elastic modulus and the spontaneous curvature (17Evans E. Needham D. J. Phys. Chem. 1987; 91: 4219-4228Crossref Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 18Helfrich W. Z. Naturforsch. 1973; 28C: 693-703Crossref Scopus (5018) Google Scholar). The bending elastic modulus is the resistance of membranes to curvature or the bending rigidity, whereas the spontaneous curvature is the inherent curvature of an unconstrained membrane section and changes with lipid structure. Because biomembranes are largely bilayers, each leaflet contributes to the overall stiffness in nonlocalized ways that arise from the different strains to which molecules in each leaflet are subjected as the bilayer bends. An outward curvature results in expansion of the outer leaflet of the bilayer along with a compression of the inner leaflet. The different strains in each leaflet produce mechanical stress gradients within the membrane. The stress gradients can significantly increase lateral diffusivity (19Evans E.A. Yeung A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 73: 39-56Crossref Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 20Raphael R.M. Waugh R.E. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1374-1388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and be a driving force for the transbilayer migration of lipid molecules between leaflets (20Raphael R.M. Waugh R.E. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1374-1388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 21Svetina S. Zeks B. Waugh R.E. Raphael R.M. Eur. Biophys. J. Biophys. Lett. 1998; 27: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The altered lipid packing and stress gradients in highly curved membranes can be relieved by the generation of asymmetries in the lipid transbilayer distributions that depend on the overall molecular shape of different individual lipids (22Israelachvili J.N. Mitchell D.J. Ninham B.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 470: 185-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). For instance, a well characterized lipid mass imbalance (2:1) exists in the outer and inner leaflets of phosphatidylcholine (PC) 1The abbreviations used are: PCphosphatidylcholineSUVssmall unilamellar vesiclesPEphosphatidylethanolaminePGphosphatidylglycerolGalCergalactosylceramidePOPC1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholineSPMsphingomyelinPSphosphatidylserine small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) as a consequence of packing the roughly cylindrically shaped PC amphiphiles into a highly curved bilayer vesicle (23Yeagle P.L. Hutton W.C. Martin R.B. Sears B.J. Huang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2110-2112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Huang C. Mason J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 308-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). The resulting transbilayer lipid mass imbalance can be maintained almost indefinitely by keeping the SUVs in the liquid-crystalline phase state to minimize transient packing defects that promote slow relaxation processes (25Huang C. Thompson T.E. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 32: 485-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 26Lichtenberg D. Barenholz Y. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1988; 33: 337-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In SUVs composed of equimolar egg phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and egg PC, PE is enriched in the inner leaflet, whereas the PC is enriched in the outer leaflet. The smaller and less hydrated headgroup of PE imparts a cone-like molecular shape which is better suited than PC's cylindrical shape for inner leaflet localization in highly curved bilayers (27Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2844-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Geometric accommodation of lipid shape also has provided a similar, logical explanation for the transbilayer distributions of lyso-PC/PC mixtures (28Kumar V.V. Baumann W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 139: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, lipid geometric shapes alone do not satisfactorily account for the transbilayer distributions observed when PC SUVs contain low mole fractions of either PE or phosphatidylglycerol (PG). In this case, disproportionately higher amounts of PE or PG are observed in the SUV outer leaflet, putatively because of generalized lattice packing effects (29Lentz B.R. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5537-5543Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 30Lentz B.R. Alford D.R. Dombrose F.A. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2555-2559Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Together, these studies show that investigating lipid transbilayer distributions in vesicles provides an effective means to gain insights into the interrelationship between lipid structure and membrane curvature. phosphatidylcholine small unilamellar vesicles phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylglycerol galactosylceramide 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine sphingomyelin phosphatidylserine The present study was motivated by the need to better understand and define: 1) the transbilayer distribution of simple sphingolipids in phospholipid membranes and 2) the impact of changing vesicle composition on sphingolipid transmembrane distribution. Here, we describe a novel means to quantify the transbilayer distribution of [13C]galactosylceramide (GalCer) by 13C NMR. Interestingly, we find that [13C]GalCer preferentially localizes to the inner leaflets of POPC SUVs. In response to increasing sphingomyelin (SPM) content, the GalCer transmembrane distribution shifts markedly toward the outer SUV leaflet even though PC and SPM have chemically identical polar headgroups. The results suggest that SPM-GalCer interactions, even in the absence of cholesterol, play an important role in controlling cerebroside transbilayer distributions. POPC and egg SPM were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL); bovine brain GalCer without hydroxy fatty acyl chains, was from Sigma-Aldrich; andd-erythro-sphingosine, was from Matreya (State College, PA). [6-13C]Galactose (99 atom %13C) was obtained from Omicron Biochemicals (South Bend, IN) and used to synthesize [6-13C]GalCer (99.8% isotopic enrichment, Fig. 1 A).

J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and GalCer concentration was quantitated gravimetrically. Deuterated solvents (CDCl3, CD3OD, D2O) were obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). SUVs were prepared by sonication using a modification of the established procedure by Huang and Thompson (25Huang C. Thompson T.E. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 32: 485-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The total amount of lipid in each preparation was kept constant (200 μmol). The lipids were dissolved in 15 ml of CHCl3:CH3OH (2:1) in a 50-ml round-bottom flask. For preparations containing GalCer, a drop of water was added to aid solubilization. A lipid film was obtained by slowly evaporating the solvents at 37 °C on a rotary evaporator, followed by freeze-drying in vacuo for 6 h. The lipid film was hydrated in 2 ml of D2O, then dispersed by vortexing with intermittent warming to 37 °C, and the dispersion was sonicated under nitrogen for 30–60 min until translucent. After removal of titanium debris by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 60 min, the vesicles were used immediately for NMR analysis. Vesicle stability and vesicle impermeability to ions was ascertained by 31P NMR by monitoring phospholipid chemical shifts and signal intensities as a function of time. By these criteria, all vesicles used in the present study remained stable and ion-impermeable for several days. POPC and SPM were localized and quantified in the inner and outer vesicle leaflets of SUVs by 31P NMR using 1 mm praseodymium (Pr3+) ions as the paramagnetic shift reagent (28Kumar V.V. Baumann W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 139: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Proton-decoupled 31P NMR spectra were recorded at 121.42 MHz on a Varian UNITY 300 instrument (Varian Assoc., Palo Alto, CA) using a 5-mm variable temperature probe (37.0 ± 0.1 °C). Standard single-pulse experiments entailed a 90° pulse of 15 μs, an acquisition time of 1.6 s, and a pulse delay of 2 s, with the decoupler gated on during acquisition only. At a spectral width of 10,000 Hz, 32,000 data points were collected, whereas 1,600 and 6,400 transients were used for samples obtained in the absence and presence of Pr3+, respectively. Data were then zero-filled and Fourier-transformed after applying 0.1-Hz exponential line broadening. Peak areas were digitally integrated. Spectra were referenced relative to the external standard, concentrated H3PO4, having a chemical shift (δ) of 0.00 ppm. GalCer was localized and quantified in the inner and outer leaflets of POPC and POPC/SPM vesicles by 13C NMR using 5 mm Mn2+ as quenching agent. Proton-decoupled13C NMR spectra of [6-13C]GalCer containing SUVs were acquired at 75.423 MHz in the absolute mode at 37 °C. Standard single–pulse measurements entailed a 90° pulse of 9 μs, a pulse delay of 1 s, and an acquisition time of 1.8 s. At a spectral width of 16,500 Hz, 59,900 data points were collected, and 24,000 transients were used. Data were zero-filled and Fourier-transformed after applying 1-Hz exponential line broadening. Peak areas were digitally integrated. The integral of the resonance at δ 61.361 represented the total [6-13C]GalCer in the vesicles (see “Results” for details). To quantify the GalCer localized in the SUV inner leaflet, 5 mm Mn2+was added to quench the [6-13C]GalCer resonance associated with the outer bilayer leaflet. The difference between the integrals of the [6-13C]GalCer resonances observed at δ 61.361 in the absence (total GalCer) and in the presence (inner GalCer) of Mn2+ ions provided quantitation of the ion-accessible GalCer in the outer vesicle leaflet. Phospholipid transbilayer distribution between the inner and outer leaflets of vesicles can be accurately determined by31P NMR (32Berden J.A. Barker R.W. Radda G.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 375: 186-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 33Kumar V.V. Malewicz B. Baumann W.J. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, this approach is not suitable for monitoring the transbilayer distribution of glycosphingolipids because of the lack of phosphate in the headgroup of these lipids. Thus, the localization of the sugar headgroups of glycosphingolipids incorporated into vesicles was analyzed by 13C NMR spectroscopy. A comparison of 13C NMR spectra of phospholipids (35Murari R. Abd El-Rahman M.M.A. Wedmid Y. Parthasarathy S. Baumann W.J. J. Org. Chem. 1982; 47: 2158-2163Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and of bovine brain GalCer in solution (CDCl3:CD3OD:D2O; 50:50:15, v/v/v; Fig. 1 B), indicated that two signature resonances derived from C-6 and C-1 of galactose (δ 61.445 and 104.083, respectively) did not overlap with any of the phospholipid resonances and thus might be used for quantitative analysis. However, preliminary experiments with vesicles composed of PC, SPM, and GalCer (40:40:20 mol %) indicated that only the 61.361-ppm resonance derived from C-6 of galactose could be clearly detected, whereas the C-1 resonance was broadened almost beyond recognition (data not shown). This finding is consistent with C-1 being more motionally restricted by virtue of being part of the pyranose ring and buried in the membrane interfacial region. In contrast, the C-6 carbon is not part of the rigid ring system, can rotate more freely, and projects farther into the aqueous phase (36Bruzik K.S. Nyholm P.-G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 566-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus, the13C NMR resonance of the galactose C-6 carbon was deemed best suited for quantifying the transbilayer distribution of GalCer in vesicles. Attempts to shift the GalCer C-6 resonance (δ 61.361) using paramagnetic shift reagents (Pr3+ and Yb3+) yielded unsatisfactory results, leading us to adopt an alternate approach to quantify GalCer in the inner and outer vesicle leaflets of SUVs. Our approach was based on using Mn2+ ions as a bilayer-impermeant relaxing reagent to measure the distribution of cholesterol in the inner and outer leaflets of lipid vesicles. 3B. Malewicz and W. J. Baumann, unpublished data. A similar strategy has previously been used to compare the accessibility of cholesterol in the outer leaflet of ester- and ether-linked phospholipid SUVs (39Bittman R. Clejan S. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 772: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Titration experiments revealed that 5 mm Mn2+was optimal for efficiently quenching the resonance at 61.361 ppm derived from GalCer in the vesicle outer leaflet without affecting the resonances of the inner leaflet. Because of the relatively low signal intensity of the C-6 resonance of GalCer compared with the phospholipid resonances in SUVs, natural abundance 13C NMR required that the vesicles contain a relatively high content of GalCer (>20 mol %) to achieve adequate signal-to-noise ratios to quantify the transbilayer distribution of GalCer. To monitor GalCer transbilayer distribution over a wide range of mole fractions, including those typical of biological membranes, isotopic enrichment at the C-6 position of galactose was deemed the best strategy to assure acceptable sensitivity. Thus, we synthesized [6-13C]GalCer as described in detail in the Supplemental Information and outlined in Scheme 1. The resulting preparation was 99.8% isotopically enriched and increased the intensity of the GalCer C-6 resonance almost 100-fold (Fig. 1 A). To determine GalCer distribution in phospholipid vesicles, POPC SUVs containing 1 mol % [6-13C]GalCer were prepared and analyzed by 13C NMR at 37 °C. Fig. 2 shows that the C-6 resonance of galactose was well separated from POPC resonances and that its signal-to-noise ratio (∼20:1) was well suited for quantitative analysis. Fig. 3 (left panel) shows the 50–75-ppm region of the 13C NMR spectrum of the POPC vesicles containing 1 mol % [6-13C]GalCer before and after addition of 5 mm Mn2+. It is noteworthy that GalCer strongly preferred the inner leaflet (Fig. 3,right panel), with 70% of the GalCer molecules being inaccessible to Mn2+ ions (Table I). The same high preference of GalCer for the inner leaflet of POPC SUVs also was observed when the GalCer content was increased to 2 mol% (Fig. 3, right panel; Table I).Figure 3Transbilayer distribution of GalCer in POPC vesicles determined by 13C NMR.

Open table in a new tab The inner and outer leaflet compositions of the vesicles were calculated from NMR data acquired as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Units are expressed as mol %. To determine the transbilayer distribution of POPC in SUVs containing 1 or 2 mol % GalCer, 31P NMR measurements were performed in the presence and absence of Pr3+ (see “Experimental Procedures”). The outer-to-inner leaflet phosphorus ratios were 1.94 and 1.92, respectively, and were similar to the 1.90 ratio of pure POPC SUVs (Table I). To investigate the effect of increasing SPM on the transbilayer distribution of GalCer, SUVs with a constant amount of [6-13C]GalCer and varying amounts of POPC and SPM (e.g. 2:1, 1:1, or 1:2) were prepared. The transbilayer distributions of [6-13C]GalCer and of each phospholipid were then assessed by 13C and 31P NMR spectroscopy, respectively. Fig. 4(left panel) shows the 31P NMR spectra of vesicles composed of equimolar POPC and egg SPM containing 1 mol % GalCer. As the top spectrum illustrates, the 31P resonances of POPC (−0.900 ppm) and SPM (−0.246 ppm) were partially resolved from each other in the absence of Pr3+, indicating differing local environments for their phosphocholine headgroup moieties. Addition of Pr3+ caused the POPC and SPM resonances of the SUV outer leaflet to shift downfield, resulting in the four distinct resonance peaks shown in the lower spectrum of Fig. 4. By comparison with SUVs containing different amounts of SPM and POPC (e.g. 1:2 and 2:1), the SPM and POPC resonances were assigned to the inner (−0.246 and −0.900 ppm, respectively) and outer (7.596 and 5.203 ppm, respectively) leaflets. The peak assignments agree well with earlier reports (35Murari R. Abd El-Rahman M.M.A. Wedmid Y. Parthasarathy S. Baumann W.J. J. Org. Chem. 1982; 47: 2158-2163Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 36Bruzik K.S. Nyholm P.-G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 566-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 37Tkaczuk P. Thornton E.R. Biochem.

The larger Pr3+-induced downfield shift of outer leaflet SPM (compared with PC) and the distinct 31P resonances of SPM and POPC in the absence of lanthanide ions were consistent with earlier findings (32Berden J.A. Barker R.W. Radda G.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 375: 186-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 38Castellino F.J. Arch. Biochem.

Quantitative assessment indicated that the content of phospholipid (both POPC and SPM) in the outer leaflet of SUVs far exceeded that in the inner leaflet, consistent with the known mass distribution of PC in SUVs of ∼25-nm diameter (Fig. 4). However, small but reproducible differences in the transbilayer distributions of POPC and SPM could be distinguished (Table I). SPM showed a slightly greater preference for the outer leaflet at the expense of POPC and this tendency became more pronounced as the SPM mole fraction increased. It is also noteworthy that the overall outside-to-inside31P integrated signal ratios of the SPM/POPC vesicles remained very close to the 2:1 ratio expected for SUVs at all SPM compositions, consistent with the vesicles having average diameters of ∼25 nm (23Yeagle P.L. Hutton W.C. Martin R.B. Sears B.J. Huang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2110-2112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Huang C. Thompson T.E. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 32: 485-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 26Lichtenberg D. Barenholz Y. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1988; 33: 337-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Previous studies have indicated that sonication of SPM results in formation of unilamellar vesicles similar in size to those generated by sonication of PCs (40Schmidt C.F. Barenholz Y. Thompson T.E. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2649-2656Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Having established the transbilayer distribution of SPM and POPC when mixed in SUVs, we next determined the effect of SPM on the transbilayer distribution of 1 mol % [6-13C]GalCer by 13C NMR (Fig. 5). We found that increasing the SPM content in POPC SUVs shifted GalCer from the inner to the outer leaflet. The amount of GalCer localized to the inner leaflet decreased from 70% in pure POPC vesicles to only 40% in POPC/SPM (1:2) vesicles. We believe that this represents the first evidence showing that SPM can dramatically alter the transbilayer distribution of a simple monohexosylceramide, such as GalCer, in phospholipid vesicles. We have quantified the transbilayer distribution of GalCer in phospholipid vesicles by 13C NMR spectroscopy. When used in combination with 31P NMR approaches that monitor phospholipid transbilayer distribution, the strategy provides novel insights into the effect of changing SPM content on the transbilayer distribution of simple glycosphingolipids. The results reveal two notable findings. First, at low mole fractions, GalCer strongly prefers the inner leaflet of POPC SUVs. Second, increasing the SPM content of the POPC SUVs shifts the transbilayer distribution of GalCer toward the outer leaflet. Ramifications of these observations are discussed below. In POPC SUVs containing low mole fractions of GalCer (1 or 2 mol %), 70% of the glycolipid is localized in the inner leaflet. This corresponds to a doubling of the GalCer inner membrane concentration with respect to POPC, which is 34% localized in the inner leaflet (Table I). The mass distribution of PC in SUVs (1:2 inner leaflet-to-outer leaflet) is well established (7Li X.-M. Momsen M.M. Brockman H.L. Brown R.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5954-5963Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 8Dietrich C. Bagatolli L.A. Volovyk Z.N. Thompson N.L. Levi M. Jacobson K. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 1417-1428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar, 9Brown R.E. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). What is remarkable about the transmembrane distribution of GalCer is its strong preference for the inner leaflet when present at 1 or 2 mol % in POPC SUVs. Earlier studies of PE and PG (see Introduction) revealed just the opposite behavior in that these lipids strongly preferred the outer leaflet of PC SUVs (29Lentz B.R. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5537-5543Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 30Lentz B.R. Alford D.R. Dombrose F.A. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2555-2559Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Only when present at 10 mol % (or more) in PC SUVs did PE and PG assume transmembrane distributions that can be rationalized by the structural parameters associated with their overall shape, charge, and hydration (22Israelachvili J.N. Mitchell D.J. Ninham B.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 470: 185-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar, 29Lentz B.R. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5537-5543Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 30Lentz B.R. Alford D.R. Dombrose F.A. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2555-2559Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The preferential localization of low mole fractions of PE and PG to the outer leaflet of PC SUVs has been explained as a general lattice response linked to the “looser” molecular packing of the outer leaflet of PC SUVs (30Lentz B.R. Alford D.R. Dombrose F.A. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2555-2559Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Our results clearly show that GalCer does not conform to the PE/PG transmembrane localizations in fluid PC bilayers previously reported for highly curved phosphoglyceride vesicles. This may be a consequence of GalCer having a completely uncharged and moderately hydrated polar headgroup compared with the zwitterionic or ionic headgroups of phosphoglycerides (36Bruzik K.S. Nyholm P.-G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 566-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 41Ruocco M.J. Shipley G.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 735: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The second major finding of this study is that increasing the SPM content of POPC SUVs dramatically shifts the transbilayer distribution of GalCer toward the outer leaflets. This shift occurs even though SPM and POPC have chemically identical phosphocholine headgroups. Not surprisingly, our 31P NMR measurements in the presence and absence of the paramagnetic shift ion, Pr3+, show that SPM and POPC localize quite similarly in SUVs with SPM showing only a slight preference for the outer leaflet (38Castellino F.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 189: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 40Schmidt C.F. Barenholz Y. Thompson T.E. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2649-2656Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, the impact of increasing SPM content on GalCer transmembrane distribution is clear and dramatic (Table I). It is likely that the remarkable shift in the transbilayer localization of GalCer toward the outer leaflets of SPM/POPC SUVs reflects changes in the in-plane interactions that occur between GalCer and SPM relative to those that occur between GalCer and POPC in highly curved vesicles. The structural features of GalCer, SPM, and POPC likely to play a role in this behavior are the following. First, consider the lipid hydrocarbon region. POPC has the naturally prevalent PC motif consisting of sn-1 chain saturation and sn-2 chain unsaturation. Both egg SPM and [6-13C]GalCer have the naturally prevalent sphingolipid motif consisting of sphingosine and a saturated acyl chain. Compared with POPC's oleoyl chains, the mostly palmitoyl acyl chains (∼85%) of egg SPM would be expected to pack better with the palmitoyl chains of [6-13C]GalCer. With regard to the polar headgroup region, one might mistakenly assume no difference among PC and SPM because of the chemical identity of their phosphocholine headgroups. However, it is clear that, when PC and SPM are mixed together in SUVs, the 31P NMR resonances of these lipids display different chemical shifts, indicating that the local environments near their respective phosphate groups are not identical. One explanation may be that SPM, but not PC, forms intramolecular hydrogen bonds involving the hydroxyl group at carbon 3 of the sphingoid base and either the bridge oxygen or ester oxygen of phosphate (40Schmidt C.F. Barenholz Y. Thompson T.E. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2649-2656Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 42Talbott C.M. Vorobyov I. Borchman D. Taylor K.G. DuPre D.B. Yappert M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1467: 326-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 43Bruzik K.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 939: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 44Bruzik K.S. Sobon B. Salamonczyk G.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4017-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This capability may contribute to the metastable behavior and different structural conformations known to occur in SPMs (Refs. 43Bruzik K.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 939: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 44Bruzik K.S. Sobon B. Salamonczyk G.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4017-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 45Maulik P.R.

J. 1996; 70: 2256-2265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar and references therein). In addition, the ceramide region of SPM and GalCer contain amide-linked acyl chains, which are thought to participate in intermolecular hydrogen bonding lattices via bridging water molecules, as well as 4,5-trans double bonds that further modulate intermolecular interactions (10Masserini M. Ravasi D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1532: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 42Talbott C.M. Vorobyov I. Borchman D. Taylor K.G. DuPre D.B. Yappert M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1467: 326-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The combined differences in the headgroup and interfacial regions of SPMs and PCs appear likely to affect their interactions with GalCer. Altogether, our results emphasize that subtle structural and conformational changes to the interfacial zone of bilayer matrix lipids, such as PC and SPM, can significantly affect the transbilayer distribution of simple sphingolipids, such as cerebroside, in curved membranes. Lipid transmembrane asymmetry is of fundamental importance to the health of cells, and a loss of this asymmetry has severe detrimental effects. During late apoptotic events as well as under many other pathological conditions such as diabetes, malaria, and sickle cell disease, a loss of phosphatidylserine (PS) asymmetry occurs (47Closse C. Dachary-Prigent J. Boisseau M.R. Br. J. Haematol. 1999; 107: 300-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). A defect in the aminophospholipid translocase or activation of the phospholipid scramblase causes abnormal exposure of PS on the exoplasmic leaflet from its normal cytoplasmic orientation (48Bratton D.L.

PS externalization during the lipid scrambling process has recently been linked to the inward translocation of external SPM (6Tepper A.D. Ruurs P. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Borst J. van Blitterswijk W.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This “flopped” SPM pool is hydrolyzed by cytosolic sphingomyelinase to ceramide as part of the execution phase of apoptosis. SPM depletion from the plasma membrane leads to a redistribution of cholesterol to intracellular sites and/or the efflux of cholesterol to external acceptors such as serum lipoproteins and cyclodextrins (51Ohvo H. Olsio C. Slotte J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1349: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 52Rothblat G.H. de la Llera-Moya M. Atger V. Kellner-Weibel G. Williams D.L. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 781-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An important consequence of SPM transmembrane migration and associated ceramide generation is a triggering of membrane destabilization and an increase in membrane fission processes involving membrane blebbing and vesicle shedding. Other striking examples implicating sphingolipid transmembrane distributions in the triggering of membrane vesiculation in cell and model membranes also have been reported (1Zha X. Pierini M. Leopold P.L. Skiba P.J. Tabas I. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 53Holopainen J.M. Angelova M.I. Kinnunen P.K.J. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 830-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Gaining insights into the effects of high curvature on membranes is an area of increasing interest in cell biology because of the importance of membrane fission events in generating transport vesicles (54Huttner W.B. Zimmerberg J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 478-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The ability of endophilin, a presynaptically enriched protein that binds the GTPase dynamin and synptojanin, to generate very highly curved membrane tubules underscores the potential importance of tubulovesiculation processes to membrane trafficking events in the cell (55Farsad K. Ringstad N. Takie K. Floyd S.R. Rose K. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Investigations of sphingolipid transbilayer distributions in curved membranes of defined composition, such as those reported here, are likely to provide a valuable foundation for a better understanding of cellular processes initiated by or utilizing curved membrane regions where sphingolipids are important.

Riddiford L.M. Nature. 1999; 401: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). JH levels are regulated by de novo biosynthesis (2Feyereisen R. Kerkut G.A. Gilbert L.I. Comprehensive Insect Physiology, Biochemistry and Pharmacology. 7. Pergamon Press, Oxford1985: 391-429Google Scholar) and catabolism (3De Kort C.A.D. Granger N.A. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1996; 33: 1-26Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Cellular JH metabolism involves a microsomal JH epoxide hydrolase that metabolizes JH to JH diol and a soluble JH diol kinase (JHDK) that catalyzes the formation of JH diol phosphate. JHDK is a homodimer with a subunit molecular mass of 20 kDa that uses MgATP or MgGTP as a phosphate donor to effectively catabolize JH I, II, or III diol by placing a phosphate group on the C-10 hydroxyl, thereby creating JH diol phosphate, the water-soluble end metabolite of JH catabolism (4Maxwell R.A. Welch W.H. Schooley D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21874-21881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).In this study, we report the sequencing and cloning of Manduca sexta JHDK, the molecular modeling of JHDK and Drosophila melanogaster sarcoplasmic calcium-binding protein-2 (dSCP2), and the partial purification and characterization of the D. melanogaster homolog of M. sexta JHDK. We show with high probability that the product of the D. melanogasterdSCP2 gene is the D. melanogaster homolog of M. sexta JHDK. Each is a member of a novel kinase family that is structurally similar to SCPs.DISCUSSIONPurine recognition for G-proteins is highly specific for GTP; the first and last residues of the NKXD sequence (∑3) specifically hydrogen-bond to the guanine ring of the bound nucleotide. The charged residue corresponding to Lys in ∑3 is highly conserved among all P-loop-containing nucleotide-triphosphate hydrolases; this residue is known to provide a hydrophobic surface for the purine ring and often forms a hydrogen bond with the endocyclic oxygen of the ribose ring (19Via A. Ferre F. Brannetti B. Valencia A. Helmer-Citterich M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 455-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 28Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). G-proteins have a low affinity for ATP due to the loss of a hydrogen bond donor at position 1 of the purine and the unfavorable positioning of two hydrogen bond donors: exocyclic NH2 at purine position 6 and the amido group of Asn (28Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Considering that M. sexta JHDK has a high affinity for ATP, but will also use GTP as a phosphate donor, it was not surprising that the conserved Lys of NKXD (∑3) is spatially quite similar to p21Ras (Fig. 6). However, the Asn of ∑3 is not always conserved (described below). As expected, ∑3 of M. sextaJHDK is positioned in such a way as to accommodate either purine, although in slightly different conformations (data not shown).Two forms of adenylate kinase each have Glu substituted for Asp in the ∑3 motif (NKXD), the same substitution as found for JHDK and dSCP2. One such adenylate kinase is known to use GTP (code 2AK3), and the other is known to use ATP (archaeal adenylate kinase (code 1NKS)). Interestingly, in the unoccupied protein crystal structure of each adenylate kinase, the Glu residue was in the (−)-conformation (pointing away from a possible contact with a nucleotide). Upon GTP binding, the Glu residue changed to a (+)-conformation to form a hydrogen bond with the exocyclic amino group at position 2 of the nucleotide (19Via A. Ferre F. Brannetti B. Valencia A. Helmer-Citterich M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 455-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ATP did not confer this conformational change upon binding, indicating that a hydrogen bond is not formed between Glu and the exocyclic amino group at position 6 of the adenine nucleotide (19Via A. Ferre F. Brannetti B. Valencia A. Helmer-Citterich M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 455-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We found that JHDK and dSCP2 also have a Glu substitution in this position and that it was in the (−)-conformation. Interestingly, by using only weak constraints, the Glu of JHDK could form the (+)-conformation (data not shown).A select group of ATP/GTP-binding proteins contain a conserved Asn residue in the ∑3 motif (NKXD): archaeal adenylate kinase (code 1NKS), deoxynucleotide kinase (code 1DEK), guanylate kinase (code 1GKY), and the nitrogenase ion protein (code 1NIP) (19Via A. Ferre F. Brannetti B. Valencia A. Helmer-Citterich M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 455-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although the exact role of the Asn residue is unknown, it is thought to be indirectly involved in the stabilization of NTP binding. However, the majority of ATP/GTP-binding proteins do not contain a conserved Asn. Via et al. (19Via A. Ferre F. Brannetti B. Valencia A. Helmer-Citterich M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 455-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) have proposed that the Asn residue is an evolutionary relic of an ancestral protein able to bind both ATP and GTP nucleotides. This is consistent with the fact that M. sexta JHDK can bind both nucleotides and has the conserved Asn. Interestingly, D. melanogaster phosphotransferase activity could not be detected using GTP as a phosphate donor (data not shown). Moreover, dSCP2 does not contain the conserved Asn of the ∑3 motif (NKXD).Purification and characterization of M. sexta JHDK revealed a highly specific kinase well suited for the catabolism of low nanomolar concentrations of JH diol (4Maxwell R.A. Welch W.H. Schooley D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21874-21881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis and comparison of M. sexta JHDK revealed a high sequence identity to D. melanogaster dSCP2 (also classified as calexcitin) (10Kelly L.E. Phillips A.M. Delbridge M. Stewart R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 27: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). M. sexta JHDK and D. melanogaster dSCP2 are similar to G-proteins in that they each have three conserved consensus sequence elements involved in nucleotide binding (16Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. Clark B.F. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1347-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In addition, JHDK and dSCP2 contain two pairs of EF-hand motifs (29Lewit-Bentley A. Rety S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). All currently known kinases use a nucleotide-binding fold structure that can be simplified to a residual core for NTP binding composed of four α-helices and four β-strands in a fixed architecture (15Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1999; 32: 1-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 30Milner-White E.J. Coggins J.R. Anton I.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, molecular models of JHDK and dSCP2 indicate a high probability of an all-α-helical structure similar to Ca2+-binding proteins.The charged residue corresponding to ∑2 (DXXG) is highly conserved among all P-loop-containing nucleotide-triphosphate hydrolases and is known to be directly involved in phosphate binding through a coordination of Mg2+ (31Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar, 32Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2660) Google Scholar, 33Valencia A. Chardin P. Wittinghofer A. Sander C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4637-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In most cases, the coordination is via a water molecule. M. sexta JHDK and dSCP2 each contain the conserved Asp in ∑2, which has been shown to be superimposable with the equivalent Asp in adenylate kinase and p21Ras (Fig. 6). Fig. 7 illustrates the position of the C-10 hydroxyl (phosphate acceptor) in relation to the aforementioned Asp residue and the γ-phosphate of ATP. The position of the substrates in relation to one another and the conserved NTP fingerprint leads us to speculate on a possible catalytic mechanism.Thompson et al. (34Thompson P.R. Hughes D.W. Cianciotto N.P. Wright G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14788-14795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and Izard and Ellis (35Izard T. Ellis J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2690-2700Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) proposed that phosphoryl transfer proceeds though an in-line mechanism to a primary or secondary alcohol of a small molecule. According to their hypothetical mechanism, JH diol could undergo anSn2-type phosphate transfer initiated by the abstraction of a hydroxyl proton by the catalytic base Asp18. Our models of JHDK and dSCP2 have similar residues in position to catalyze this type of reaction. Our models predict that Asp18 (M. sexta JHDK) and Asp20(dSCP2) are within hydrogen-bonding distance of the phosphate acceptor (JH diol, C-10) and phosphate donor (γ-phosphate of ATP). Moreover, this is the only enzyme functional group within 9 Å capable of acting as a catalytic base. Thompson et al. (34Thompson P.R. Hughes D.W. Cianciotto N.P. Wright G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14788-14795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and Izard and Ellis (35Izard T. Ellis J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2690-2700Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) found that mutation of the essential Asp residue resulted in a nearly complete loss of activity. However, a mechanism similar to that of adenylate kinase (code 1AKY) involving the attack of a catalytic water molecule cannot be discounted. Mutation of the corresponding Asp residue of adenylate kinase results in loss of NTP binding (36Schlauderer G.J. Proba K. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).Figs. 2 and 7 illustrate the nucleotide-binding site of M. sexta JHDK and D. melanogaster dSCP2. The binding site is composed of amino acids from ∑2 (loop region between helices 1 and 2), ∑3 (part of helix 10), and ∑1 (unstructured C-terminal end). Uncharacteristic of the fixed P-loop containing proteins, a high degree of flexibility associated with the C-terminal phosphate-binding site (∑1, P-loop) was observed during modeling of the target proteins. As a result, many nucleotide-binding conformations were encountered. Fig.7 illustrates one such conformation in which all three nucleotide-binding motifs (∑1, ∑2, and ∑3) are involved in nucleotide recognition, and the γ-phosphate of ATP is within 4 Å of the phosphate-accepting hydroxyl of JH diol.Several factors support the reliability and validity of our models forM. sexta JHDK and D. melanogaster dSCP2. 1) Both sequences were analyzed in two automated molecular modeling programs. In each case, the top five matches were the same as those we obtained by sequence threading. 2) The average positional energy of M. sexta JHDK (−0.26 kiloteslas) is quite similar to that of the template crystal structure (code 2SCP) (−0.30 kiloteslas). The backbone alignment of the target proteins with the template resulted in low (3 Å or less) r.m.s. deviation. 3) A single binding pocket is present in both target proteins. The character and dimensions of the binding pocket are well suited for JH diol and correlate with the observed phosphate selectivity of M. sexta JHDK. The position of the binding pocket is within 2 Å of the C-terminally located phosphate-binding motif. 4) Substrate docking has shown that three conserved sequence elements surround the putative substrate and align (within 3 Å or less) with conserved sequence elements of p21Ras and adenylate kinase. NTP binding is consistent with known NTP-binding proteins. It is extremely unlikely that chance can explain the simultaneous energetic profile, the three-dimensional alignment of signature residues, and the formation of a correctly sized pocket (lacking in the template). In support of this point, scrambled sequences or alternate folds failed to produce a model.All currently known kinases contain a nucleotide-binding fold structure that can be simplified to a residual core for NTP binding, composed of four α-helices and four β-strands in a fixed architecture (15Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1999; 32: 1-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 30Milner-White E.J. Coggins J.R. Anton I.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This α,β-structural core of several β-strands alternating with α-helices is also referred to as the “ancestral core structure” (30Milner-White E.J. Coggins J.R. Anton I.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and is present in most nucleotide-binding proteins (15Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1999; 32: 1-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, examples exist such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (37Matte A. Goldie H. Sweet R.M. Delbaere L.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 126-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 38Matte A. Tari L.W. Goldie H. Delbaere L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8105-8108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) in which the α,β-arrangements are different.There are only two known examples of nucleotide-binding proteins that do not contain the α,β-structure in any arrangement: dUTPase and chaperonins. The dUTPase structure consists of a trimeric all-β-domain. Chaperonins such as GroEL/GroES are large multisubunit assemblies that are essential for the folding of many proteins. They require the energy derived from hydrolyzing ATP to initiate a conformational change. The GroEL equatorial domain binds ATP with a structure composed of four helical subdomains (39Llorca O. Marco S. Carroscosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 118: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, GroEL is the only nucleotide-binding protein that uses an all-α-helical structure to bind nucleotides. Chaperonins have a unique sequence to bind ATP that is quite different from M. sexta JHDK, P-loop proteins, or nucleotide-binding proteins.Kelly et al. (10Kelly L.E. Phillips A.M. Delbridge M. Stewart R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 27: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) isolated a cDNA clone corresponding toD. melanogaster dSCP2 using antibodies raised against theDrosophila Ca2+-binding protein DCABP-23 to screen an expression library. In situ hybridization using adult Drosophila indicated that the expression pattern of the transcript is exclusive to neural tissue. Later, Quattrone et al. 5A. Quattrone, H. Xu, A. Pacini, and D. L. Alkon, unpublished data. reclassified dSCP2 as a Ca2+-sensing low molecular mass GTPase (GenBankTM/EBI accession number AAC62484). M. sexta JHDK shares 59% sequence identity and 80+% sequence similarity with dSCP2. Modeling of dSCP2 indicates that it has a tertiary structure very similar to SCPs. The conserved NTP-binding motifs in dSCP2 spatially align with the equivalent motifs in the GTP-binding protein p21Ras, adenylate kinase, and the theoretical model of M. sexta JHDK. Models predict that dSCP2 and M. sexta JHDK bind JH diol and MgATP in a similar fashion. We have shown that the phosphotransferase responsible for production of JH diol phosphate in adult Drosophila has a pI and active molecular mass that correspond to those predicted for dSCP2. The phosphotransferase activity has the same retention properties upon HIC and SAX chromatography as well as similar retention upon WAX chromatography as M. sexta JHDK. Given this information, we conclude that dSCP2 is the probableDrosophila homolog of M. sexta JHDK and that dSCP2 should be known as Drosophila JHDK.What is the relationship of JHDK to Ca2+-binding proteins? The exact function of SCPs is unknown. One speculation is that they are responsible for the maintenance of a buffered intracellular Ca2+ concentration (40Vijay-Kumar S. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 413-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, there are some protein families (S100 protein) that possess EF-hand motifs that are unable to bind any metal (29Lewit-Bentley A. Rety S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 41Rety S. Sopkova J. Renouard M. Osterloh D. Gerke V. Tabaries S. Russo-Marie F. Lewit-Bentley A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Nelson et al. (42Nelson T.J. Cavallaro S., Yi, C.L. McPhie D. Schreurs B.G. Gusev P.A. Favit A. Zohar O. Kim J. Beushausen S. Ascoli G. Olds J. Neve R. Alkon D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13808-13813Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) identified calexcitin as a signaling protein that binds calcium and GTP and shares sequence homology with AmphioxusSCP. Apparently, this is the first known instance of a GTP-binding protein that also binds Ca2+. Although a tertiary structure has not been proposed for calexcitin, it does have partial sequence similarity to some of the conserved GTP-binding motifs.The role of divalent cations in JHDK is unclear. Models of M. sexta JHDK indicate that at least two EF-hand motifs have a high probability for divalent cation binding. In fact, the ∑2 motif (DXXG) is part of the first N-terminal Ca2+-binding motif (Fig. 2). M. sexta JHDK was found to be inhibited by metals during purification and characterization (4Maxwell R.A. Welch W.H. Schooley D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21874-21881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The use of chelators restored activity. In addition, M. sexta JHDK activity was inhibited by micromolar levels of free Mg2+ and Ca2+ (4Maxwell R.A. Welch W.H. Schooley D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21874-21881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, Ca2+ inhibition was observed well above physiological levels. Several attempts were made to remove endogenous bound divalent cations from native M. sexta JHDK (4Maxwell R.A. Welch W.H. Schooley D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21874-21881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In all cases, Ca2+ was not required for activity. Due to the low quantities of native M. sexta JHDK obtained through purification, an expression system will be required to further characterize the role of divalent cations and EF-hand motifs in JHDK.45Ca binding assays and overlay blots will determine whether JHDK binds Ca2+ (42Nelson T.J. Cavallaro S., Yi, C.L. McPhie D. Schreurs B.G. Gusev P.A. Favit A. Zohar O. Kim J. Beushausen S. Ascoli G. Olds J. Neve R. Alkon D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13808-13813Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy should determine whether divalent cation binding is initiating structural changes (43Gombos Z. Jeromin A. Mal T.K. Chakrabartty A. Ikura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22529-22536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).Interestingly, the top 20 matches from a BLAST search of M. sexta JHDK were all calcium-binding proteins, hypothetical or otherwise. Of these, many of the various forms of calexcitin and SCP also showed conservation of an Asp at ∑2, a conserved Lys and Asp at ∑3 (in some cases, Lys was substituted with Cys, and Asp was substituted with Glu), and a partial phosphate-binding sequence at the C terminus for ∑1 (GXXXXG always conserved) when aligned with the primary sequence of M. sexta JHDK. One may hypothesize a function other than Ca2+ binding for these proteins, such as nucleotide binding and small molecule phosphotransferase function. Future molecular modeling may show whether these NTP-binding motifs are also superimposable with those of p21Ras and adenylate kinase.It is not surprising that knowledge-based modeling strongly indicated a Ca2+-binding protein tertiary fold given the conservation of three divalent cation-binding motifs (EF-hands) for JHDK and dSCP2. It is surprising, however, to find the presence and superimposability of all three highly conserved nucleotide-binding motifs (fingerprint of GTPases) associated with the Ca2+-binding protein tertiary fold. JHDK and dSCP2 are members of a novel class of nucleotide-binding proteins that use the all-α-helical Ca2+-binding protein scaffold to arrange the highly evolved fingerprint of GTPase motifs for nucleotide binding. In addition, they appear to be the first example of a hormone-inactivating phosphotransferase (4Maxwell R.A. Welch W.H. Schooley D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21874-21881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It would seem that JHDK and dSCP2 fill a structural gap linking kinase function to the tertiary fold of the Ca2+-binding protein. Endocrine control of embryonic and post-embryonic development in insects is primarily accomplished by juvenile hormone (JH)1 and ecdysteroids (1Truman J.W. Riddiford L.M. Nature. 1999; 401: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Development proceeds through a series of molts and metamorphosis, where the function of JH is to regulate the character of the molt; metamorphosis is characterized by a sharp decrease in JH, and adult molting by the absence of JH (1Truman J.W. Riddiford L.M. Nature. 1999; 401: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). JH levels are regulated by de novo biosynthesis (2Feyereisen R. Kerkut G.A. Gilbert L.I. Comprehensive Insect Physiology, Biochemistry and Pharmacology. 7. Pergamon Press, Oxford1985: 391-429Google Scholar) and catabolism (3De Kort C.A.D. Granger N.A. Arch. Insect Biochem.

In this study, we report the sequencing and cloning of Manduca sexta JHDK, the molecular modeling of JHDK and Drosophila melanogaster sarcoplasmic calcium-binding protein-2 (dSCP2), and the partial purification and characterization of the D. melanogaster homolog of M. sexta JHDK.

https://openalex.org/W2166476017,"High mobility group nucleosome-binding (HMGN) proteins belong to a family of nuclear proteins that bind to nucleosomes and enhance transcription from chromatin templates by altering the structure of the chromatin fiber. The intranuclear organization of these proteins is dynamic and related to the metabolic state of the cell. Here we report that ∼50% of the HMGN proteins are organized into macromolecular complexes in a fashion that is similar to that of other nuclear activities that modify the structure of the chromatin fiber. We identify several distinct HMGN-containing complexes that are relatively unstable and find that the inclusion of HMGN in the complexes varies according to the metabolic state of the cell. The nucleosome binding ability of HMGN in the complex is stronger than that of the free HMGN. We suggest that the inclusion of HMGN proteins into metastable multiprotein complexes serves to target the HMGN proteins to specific sites in chromatin and enhances their interaction with nucleosomes. High mobility group nucleosome-binding (HMGN) proteins belong to a family of nuclear proteins that bind to nucleosomes and enhance transcription from chromatin templates by altering the structure of the chromatin fiber. The intranuclear organization of these proteins is dynamic and related to the metabolic state of the cell. Here we report that ∼50% of the HMGN proteins are organized into macromolecular complexes in a fashion that is similar to that of other nuclear activities that modify the structure of the chromatin fiber. We identify several distinct HMGN-containing complexes that are relatively unstable and find that the inclusion of HMGN in the complexes varies according to the metabolic state of the cell. The nucleosome binding ability of HMGN in the complex is stronger than that of the free HMGN. We suggest that the inclusion of HMGN proteins into metastable multiprotein complexes serves to target the HMGN proteins to specific sites in chromatin and enhances their interaction with nucleosomes. The nucleus of eukaryotic cells contains multiple activities that modify the structure of the chromatin fiber thereby affecting a variety of DNA-related activities such as transcription, replication, recombination, and DNA repair (1Naar A.M.

Structural changes in the chromatin fiber are induced by enzymatic activities that target either the histones or the DNA in a variety of ways including the reversible post-translational modification of specific amino acid residues in histones by acetylation (6Roth S.Y. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 81-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar) and phosphorylation (7Cheung P. Allis C.D. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 2000; 103: 263-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Additional activities, some of which are ATP-dependent, remodel the structure of the nucleosome and facilitate access of regulatory factors to their cognate binding sites (8Fry C.J. Peterson C.L.

Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1998; 8: 225-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Biochemical and genetic studies indicate that most of these chromatin modifying activities are associated with other proteins in macromolecular complexes consisting of discrete subunits (1Naar A.M. Lemon B.D. Tjian R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 475-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 10Kuzmichev A. Reinberg D. Curr. Top. Microbiol.

Dev. 1999; 9: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The proteins associated with the chromatin modifying activities may play a role in targeting them to specific modification sites. Interestingly, the protein subunits appear in several distinct complexes (1Naar A.M. Lemon B.D. Tjian R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 475-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 8Fry C.J.

It has been suggested that the sharing and mixing of subunits and their components among multiprotein complexes reflect the dynamic and modular nature of the macromolecular complexes containing the chromatin modifying activities. The dynamic aspect of these activities seems to play a role in the ability of a cell to respond to various metabolic demands (1Naar A.M. Lemon B.D. Tjian R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 475-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar,2Hassan A.H. Neely K.E. Vignali M. Reese J.C. Workman J.L. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: D1054-D1064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Changes in chromatin structure are also induced by structural proteins such as the high mobility group nucleosome-binding (HMGN) 1The abbreviations used are: HMGNhigh mobility group nucleosome-bindingAEBSF4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluorideEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayHAhemagglutininMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flightPBSphosphate-buffered saline family (14Bianchi M.E.

Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 35-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which are devoid of known enzymatic activities. HMGN proteins are a family of nuclear proteins found in the nuclei of all mammalian and many vertebrate cells (17Bustin M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 431-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The nomenclature of the HMGN family has been changed recently (17 and the references therein). HMGN1 (former name HMG-14) and HMGN2 (former name HMG-17) proteins bind to the 147-bp nucleosome core particles, i.e. to the building block of the chromatin fiber, with no known specificity for the underlying DNA sequence (18Shirakawa H. Herrera J.E. Bustin M. Postnikov Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37937-37944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Distinct domains in the HMGN proteins interact with either the nucleosomal DNA or with the amino termini of the core histones, reduce the compaction of the higher order chromatin structure, and enhance transcription and replication from chromatin templates (19Crippa M.P. Alfonso P.J. Bustin M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 20Ding H.F. Bustin M. Hansen U. Mol. Cell.

Recent experiments using fluorescence loss in photobleaching and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching imaging techniques with specific HMGN point mutants provided direct evidence that in living cells HMGN proteins interact with chromatin through a specific nucleosome binding domain (23Prymakowska-Bosak M.

Photobleaching experiments demonstrated that in living cells these proteins move rapidly throughout the entire nucleus and therefore may reach their binding sites in a diffusion-driven manner, by random chance (24Phair R.D. Misteli T. Nature. 2000; 404: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). A macromolecular HMGN complex was detected in HeLa nuclear extract, suggesting that, like other chromatin modifying activities, HMGN proteins may function in the context of macromolecular complexes (18Shirakawa H. Herrera J.E. Bustin M. Postnikov Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37937-37944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this respect the mechanism of action of HMGN, and perhaps that of other structural chromatin-binding proteins, may be very similar to that of the histone acetyltransferases or the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activities. In this report we demonstrate that a significant fraction of the nuclear HMGN is associated with other proteins into several metastable multiprotein complexes. The nucleosome binding ability of the HMGN in the complexes is higher than that of free HMGN. The low stability of the HMGN macromolecular complexes may enable the proteins to shuttle between complexes depending on specific cellular requirements. We suggest that HMGN proteins associate dynamically with multiple macromolecular complexes and that these associations may affect the interaction of the proteins with their chromatin targets. HeLa S3 cells were grown in 5% fetal calf serum, minimal essential medium Joklik and harvested at a 5 × 105/ml density. Nuclear extracts were performed as described (25Lee K.A. Green M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with buffer A (10 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol with proteinase inhibitor mixture, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), suspended with Dounce homogenizer. The cells were disrupted with a tight type Dounce homogenizer, and nuclear proteins and their complexes were extracted with buffer C250 or C350 (final concentrations 20 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.5, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 250 or 350 mm NaCl, 0.2 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and a mixture of proteinase inhibitors). The HMGN1-containing protein complexes and pure HMGN1 protein were incubated with 0.03, 0.1, and 0.3% paraformaldehyde in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA buffer for 30 min at room temperature. The products of the cross-linking were analyzed by Western blotting. The chromatographic media used for the two purification schemes detailed in the text are indicated in Figs. 4 and 5. In each case, the preparations were dialyzed against the starting buffer of the next chromatographic step and then concentrated on spin dialysis columns. All buffers used for chromatography contained 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Fractions of interest were desalted or concentrated with CentriPrep or Centricon (10,000 cut-off) spin dialysis tubes. HMGN1 or HMGN2 in the various fractions was detected by Western analysis. A linear 0.1–0.6 m NaCl gradient in 20 mm phosphate, pH 6.0, 10% glycerol for 1 h at 1 ml/min was used for the Mono S HR5/5 column. The Superose 6 HR16/30 (Amersham Biosciences) columns were eluted with buffer GF (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.8, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) at 0.3 ml/min for 100 min. The Mono Q HR/5/5 anion exchanger was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1–0.6 m NaCl in 20 mm HEPES-Na, pH 8.8, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, at 1 ml/min for 60 min. HiTrap heparin-agarose columns (AmershamBiosciences) had a total volume of 1.0 ml and were eluted with a three-step gradient, first for 20 min with isocratic 20 mmHEPES, pH 8.8, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol buffer, followed by 60 min of a linear 0–1.0 m NaCl gradient in the same buffer, and finally with a 20-min wash with a 1 mNaCl solution in the same buffer. The CM-Sepharose column was eluted with a stepwise gradient from 0 to 1.0 m KCl, in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm AEBSF, 10% glycerol, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min.Figure 5Multiple HMGN1 protein complexes in HeLa nuclei. The fractionation scheme of a 0.25 m NaCl HeLa cell nuclear extract is shown. The extract was subjected to three consecutive chromatographic steps (CM-Sepharose, Superose 6, and Mono Q; the chromatographic media are indicated on the right). After each chromatographic step the fractions were analyzed by Western blotting, and each of the major HMGN1-containing fractions was applied to the next chromatographic step. The salt gradient used in the various steps is indicated. The numbers on top of each line depict the retention time (in min) of a major HMGN1-containing fraction. The complexes are named according to their elution time from the Mono Q column and also are indicated by unique symbols. Free HMGN is marked by a black solid circle (●). The fractionation scheme of the complexes is indicated by the various shaded symbols.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) HeLa cells were established to express stably HMGN1 or HMGN2 tagged at the carboxyl terminus with both FLAG and HA peptide tags by retroviral transduction (26Ogryzko V.V.

Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and harvested after growing to confluence. The nuclear protein was extracted in HGEK 100 buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2% EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture) by same method described above. Most of procedures were carried out as recommended in the manufacturers' protocols (Sigma and Roche). Anti-FLAG-agarose (Sigma) preequilibrated with HGEK 100 buffer was added to the nuclear extracts and incubated for 10 h at 4 °C with rotatory shaking. Agarose beads were recovered by centrifugation and washed twice with HGEK buffer adjusted to 500 mm KCl and then washed twice with HGEK 100 buffer. To release the bound proteins the resins were incubated for 4 h with 150 μm FLAG peptide, and the resin was removed by centrifugation. The release of the protein was followed by Western blot with specific antibodies. The proteins released from FLAG-agarose were applied to anti-HA-agarose (Roche) and the resin treated as for the FLAG affinity procedure except that the proteins were eluted with 100 μm HA followed by 200 μl of 0.1m glycine HCl, pH 3.5. HeLa nuclear extracts, or specific fractions recovered from the size exclusion columns, were either concentrated or adjusted to the indicated NaCl or urea concentration and reloaded onto the same columns. The presence of HMGN in the various chromatographic fractions was detected by Western analysis after fractionation on 15% SDS-PAGE. The proteins from fractions of interest were resolved by electrophoresis in 15% SDS-PAGE, the gel stained with GelCode (Pierce), and bands of interest excised from the gel and sent to the PDTC facility at Rockefeller University, New York, for peptide fingerprinting by MALDI-TOF. Proteins were tentatively identified by comparing the peptide spectrum of each band with the theoretical peptides calculated for all proteins in the SWISS-PROT database using PeptIdent (www.expasy.ch/tools/peptident.html) or ProFound (PDTC, Rockefeller). The top protein candidates were analyzed further by the PeptideMass and FindPept programs. HeLa cells grown on coverslips were washed with phosphate-buffered serum (PBS), fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, washed with PBS, and incubated for 20 min in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 1% fetal bovine serum, 0.1% NaN3 (TNBS buffer). The anti-HMGN1, or anti-FLAG antibody (at about 0.1 μg/ml in TNBS), treatment was done overnight at room temperature in a moist chamber. Secondary antibody treatment was the same as primary treatment. After the final wash steps, coverslips were inverted onto glass slides using the ProLong anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes) as the mounting medium. Fluorescent cells were examined with an epifluorescence microscope (Optiphot; Nikon) equipped with a confocal system (MRC-1024; Bio-Rad). Sequential excitation at 568, 488, and 647 nm was provided by a 15-mW krypton-argon laser (American Laser, Salt Lake City, UT), and sequential images were collected using LaserSharp software (Bio-Rad). Pure recombinant HMGN proteins or complexes containing HMGN proteins were incubated at low ionic strength, under noncooperative binding conditions (27Postnikov Y.V. Lehn D.A. Robinson R.C. Friedman F.K. Shiloach J. Bustin M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4520-4526Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), with either unlabeled or 32P end-labeled core particles, prepared from chicken blood as described previously (28Ausio J. Dong F. van Holde K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The final concentrations of the components of the reaction were 0.5 × TBE, chicken blood core particles (either 0.2 ng/μl 32P end-labeled or 100 ng/μl unlabeled), 1% Ficoll, and 1 μg/μl tRNA. The total reaction volume was 10 μl. The mobility shift assay was performed on a native 4% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 × TBE. For Western analysis, the gels were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by the semidry transfer technique, using 5% methanol and 1× Tris-glycine buffer, pH 8.3, and HMGN proteins were visualized with a mixture of affinity pure anti-HMGN1 and anti-HMGN2 antibodies. In the initial steps to determine whether HMGN1 and HMGN2 proteins are associated with other cellular components in macromolecular complexes, we fractionated HeLa S3 nuclear extracts on Zorbax GF450 or Superose 6 size exclusion columns. Western analysis of the chromatographic fractions with antibodies specific to either HMGN1 or HMGN2 indicated that most of the protein was found in two peaks (Fig. 1). The first peak eluted close to the void volume and contained high molecular mass complexes (HMW in Fig. 1 A) that were larger than 500 kDa, whereas the second peak eluted near the salt volume, where low molecular mass components elute (LMW in Fig. 1 A). The elution volume of the second peak was the same as that of marker recombinant HMGN proteins (not shown), indicating that this peak contains free, uncomplexed HMGN proteins. Quantitative analysis of the HMGN proteins in the two main chromatographic fractions indicates that in nuclear extracts prepared by extraction with 0.35 m NaCl (see “Materials and Methods”), about 40% of the HMGN is in high molecular mass fractions. In nuclear extracts prepared by extraction with 0.25 m NaCl, ∼60% of the HMGN proteins fractionate as a large molecular complex (not shown). Because HMGN proteins are highly basic and because nuclear extracts may contain nucleic acids, we examined the possibility that these proteins are found in nucleoprotein complexes. To test this possibility, the nuclear extracts were digested with either DNase I or RNase, the digests were refractionated on the same exclusion columns, and the HMGN content of each chromatographic fraction was estimated by Western analysis. The optical density of the RNase-digested, but not that of the DNase I-digested, HeLa nuclear extract changed, indicating that indeed, the nuclear extracts contained RNA. However, the elution profile of the HMGN proteins was not affected by nuclease digestions (Fig. 1 B), a clear indication that HMGN proteins in the HMG fraction are not associated with nucleic acids in a nucleoprotein complex. To verify that in nuclear extracts HMGN proteins are present as macromolecular complexes and associated with other proteins, we treated both the high and low molecular mass fractions with various concentrations of formaldehyde, fractionated the reaction mixture by SDS-PAGE, and visualized the HMGN in the various fractions by immunoblotting. The high and low molecular mass fractions contained similar amounts of HMGN proteins (compare lanes 2 and 7 in Fig. 1 C) and many additional proteins (lanes 1 and 6 in Fig. 1 C) that potentially could cross-link with HMGN1. Coomassie Blue analysis of SDS-polyacrylamide gels on which the cross-linked reaction mixture was fractionated indicates that both the high and low molecular mass fractions produced multiple complexes. Western analysis of these gels clearly indicated that only the HMGN proteins in the high molecular mass fraction cross-linked into higher molecular mass bands. As illustrated with HMGN2, exposure of the HMGN-containing complex in the high molecular mass fraction (Fig. 1 C) to increasing concentrations of formaldehyde led to a gradual decrease in the detectable amount of free HMGN and a concomitant increase in the amount of immunoreactive high molecular mass components (arrow, Fig. 1 C). In contrast, formaldehyde cross-linking of similar amounts of HMGN2 in the low molecular mass fraction did not change the amount of free protein and did not produce high molecular mass immunoreactive components (Fig. 1 C). Thus, the HMGN in the high molecular mass fraction is complexed with other proteins, and the short range cross-linker formaldehyde cross-links it to the protein partners, whereas the HMGN in the low molecular mass fraction is not in close contact with other proteins and does not cross-link into higher molecular mass complexes. Taken together, the results indicate that a significant portion of the nuclear HMGN proteins is found in large macromolecular complexes and that within these complexes the HMGN proteins make protein-protein contacts. Fractionation of HeLa 0.25 m NaCl nuclear extracts on Superose 6 size exclusion columns also indicated that a large part of the nuclear HMGN proteins are found in high molecular mass fractions. Traces of HMGN proteins were also detected in fractions of intermediate molecular mass which eluted between the void and salt volumes. Upon rechromatography on the same columns, the high molecular mass complexes dissociated, and most of the HMGN proteins were found in either the intermediate or the low molecular mass fractions (Fig. 2 B). Unexpectedly, when the high molecular mass fraction was made 1 m in NaCl prior to rechromatography on the Superose 6 columns, the relative amount of HMGN protein found in the high molecular mass fraction increased, and only a little HMGN protein was detected in the low or intermediate molecular mass fractions (strip 2, Fig. 2 C). The same effect was seen upon exposure of the high molecular mass to 2m NaCl (strip 3, Fig. 2 C), suggesting that the presence of HMGN proteins in a macromolecular complex is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions. Indeed, treatment of the nuclear extracts with either 4 or 8 m urea dissociated the high molecular mass complex, and most of the protein was found in low molecular mass fractions. We conclude therefore that the inclusion of HMGN protein in the high molecular mass complex is stabilized by hydrophobic rather than ionic interactions. To facilitate the isolation and characterization of HMGN-containing multiprotein complexes, we stably transfected HeLa cells with vectors expressing either the double tagged HMGN1-FLAG-HA or HMGN2-FLAG-HA protein. The tags were placed at the carboxyl terminus of the proteins so as not to interfere with their nuclear localization signal, which is located in the amino terminus (29Hock R. Scheer U. Bustin M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the tagged proteins entered the nucleus (Fig. 3 A). Western analysis of cell extracts indicates that the tagged HMGN proteins were expressed at high levels, comparable with the levels of the endogenous HMGN proteins (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1, 2, 4, and 6). Nuclear extracts prepared from these cells were treated with affinity resins containing anti-FLAG antibodies, and the material eluted from these columns was reapplied to resins containing anti-HA antibodies. Western analysis with the affinity-purified materials indicated that the resins adsorbed only the tagged proteins (Fig. 3 B, lanes 7 and 8). The purification was very efficient because no tagged proteins were detected in the unbound fraction that was not adsorbed on the column (Fig. 3 B, lane 9). Polyacrylamide gel analysis of the material thus purified by sequential affinity chromatography indicates that numerous proteins copurify with the HMGN-tagged proteins (Fig. 3 C). Two of the bands that were most prominently enriched in the HMGN-expressing cells compared with the mock purified control (indicated by dots in Fig. 3 C), were excised from the polyacrylamide gels and their tryptic peptides analyzed by MALDI-TOF. The results suggested that among the proteins specifically copurifying with HMGN1 were protein hnRNPA1 (30Krecic A.M. Swanson M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar), hnRNPA2/B (30Krecic A.M. Swanson M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar), and annexin II (31Rothhut B. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 32Vedeler A. Hollas H. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Western analysis with specific antibodies confirmed that indeed hnRNPA1, but not hnRNPA2/B, was significantly enriched in the affinity-bound proteins from cell extracts expressing the tagged HMGN proteins (Fig. 3 D). Annexin II was also enriched in the HMGN-expressing cells but to a much smaller degree (1.6–2.3-fold more enrichment). Thus, in the nucleus, hnRNPA1 and perhaps annexin II may be associated with HMGN proteins. Affinity chromatography was used previously to purify successfully multiprotein complexes containing activities that modify chromatin components (26Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schlitz R.L.

Horikoshi M. Scully R. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). In the case of HMGN proteins the number of bands copurifying through two sequential affinity purification steps with the double tagged proteins was very large. Two possible explanations could account for the large number of bands copurifying with the HMGN proteins. One possibility is that the proteins interact with other proteins and form a very large complex containing many components. Alternatively, the proteins are found in multiple complexes, each containing a characteristic set of proteins. To distinguish between these two possibilities and to characterize further the multiprotein complexes containing HMGN proteins we subjected the HeLa nuclear extracts to several purification schemes. The various steps of one of these procedures used for HMGN2 is illustrated in the flow chart on the in Fig. 4. A 0.25 m NaCl nuclear extract was applied to a Mono S column eluted with a linear 0.1–1.0 m NaCl, pH 6, gradient (see “Materials and Methods”). Most of the HMGN2 was found in the fractions eluting after 4 and 32 min. Each of these two fractions was applied to a Superose 6 column. The fraction at 32 min yielded one major peak at position Su70, which corresponds to the position of free marker recombinant HMGN2. The fraction at 4 min produced three major peaks, Su30, Su60, and Su70, which correspond to the high, intermediate, and low molecular mass fractions described in Fig. 2. Fractions obtained from Superose 6 columns were applied to a Mono Q column. On this column the Su30 fraction produced two major HMGN2-containing fractions named MQ24 and MQ29; the Su60 fraction produced fractions MQ10 and MQ24, and fraction Su70 produced fraction MQ24. Each of these MQ fractions was applied to a heparin-agarose column and produced several fractions, which were named according to their elution time (see Fig. 4). Analysis of the elution pattern on the heparin-agarose columns reveals that HMGN2 was detected in the fractions eluting at positions 49, 59, 72, and 82 (named He49, He59, He72, and He82, respectively). The fraction eluting at position 59 is free HMGN2 because recombinant marker HMGN2 elutes at the same position. Fractions He49, He72, and He82 contained at least 19, 9, and 17 major protein bands, respectively, as determined by silver staining of polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 4 B). Additional faint staining bands were detectable, suggesting that these complexes were still not pure. Indeed, upon rechromatography these peaks produced additional complexes (not shown). Analyses of the fractionation procedure in Fig. 4 A suggest that the cell extract contains free HMGN2 and at least three distinct HMGN2-containing multiprotein complexes. These three multiprotein complexes were named according to their elution from the hep"
https://openalex.org/W2032386407,"Using cDNA microarrays, we recently identified a large number of transcripts that are regulated differentially by the c-Myc oncoprotein in myeloid cells. Here, we characterize one of these, termed MT-MC1 (MycTarget in Myeloid Cells-1). MT-MC1 is a widely expressed nuclear protein whose overexpression, unlike that of c-Myc targets reported previously, recapitulates multiple c-Myc phenotypes. These include promotion of apoptosis, alteration of morphology, enhancement of anchorage-independent growth, tumorigenic conversion, promotion of genomic instability, and inhibition of hematopoietic differentiation. The MT-MC1 promoter is a direct c-Myc target; it contains two consensus E-box elements, both of which bind c-Myc·Max heterodimers. Mutation of either site abrogates DNA binding by c-Myc·Max and renders the promoter c-Myc unresponsive. Finally, MT-MC1 regulates the expression of several other c-Myc target genes. MT-MC1 represents a proximal and direct c-Myc target that recapitulates many of the properties typically associated with Myc oncoprotein overexpression. Using cDNA microarrays, we recently identified a large number of transcripts that are regulated differentially by the c-Myc oncoprotein in myeloid cells. Here, we characterize one of these, termed MT-MC1 (MycTarget in Myeloid Cells-1). MT-MC1 is a widely expressed nuclear protein whose overexpression, unlike that of c-Myc targets reported previously, recapitulates multiple c-Myc phenotypes. These include promotion of apoptosis, alteration of morphology, enhancement of anchorage-independent growth, tumorigenic conversion, promotion of genomic instability, and inhibition of hematopoietic differentiation. The MT-MC1 promoter is a direct c-Myc target; it contains two consensus E-box elements, both of which bind c-Myc·Max heterodimers. Mutation of either site abrogates DNA binding by c-Myc·Max and renders the promoter c-Myc unresponsive. Finally, MT-MC1 regulates the expression of several other c-Myc target genes. MT-MC1 represents a proximal and direct c-Myc target that recapitulates many of the properties typically associated with Myc oncoprotein overexpression. The c-Myc oncoprotein exerts considerable control over transformation, differentiation, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression (1Henriksson M. Luscher B. Adv.

More recently, c-Myc has been shown to promote growth and angiogenesis (5Iritani B.M. Eisenman R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13180-13185Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 6Brandvold K.A. Neiman P. Ruddell A.

These diverse effects have suggested that the c-Myc oncoprotein in particular, and other members of the Myc oncoprotein network in general, influence the expression of a large and diverse subset of cellular genes. This is consistent with the concept that c-Myc is a transcription factor capable of activating or repressing specific genetic targets (10Cole M.D. McMahon S.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2916-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 11Eisenman R.N. Genes Dev. 2001; 16: 2023-2030Crossref Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Many putative target genes have been identified over the past several years by a variety of methods. However, the recent dramatic expansion of these genes largely reflects the use of DNA microarray technology, which allows the simultaneous assessment of several thousand expressed sequences (12Coller H.A. Grandori C. Tamayo P. Colbert T. Lander E.S. Eisenman R.N. Golub T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3260-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 13Guo Q.M. Malek R.L. Kim S.

Many of the target genes encode proteins that participate in processes known to be regulated by c-Myc. However, only a small number of these have actually been demonstrated to recapitulate any of the known c-Myc phenotypes. Furthermore, in all cases so far reported, overexpression of the target cDNA is able to impart only a limited number of c-Myc-like features to cells. For example, overexpression of ornithine decarboxylase is both transforming and pro-apoptotic (16Auvinen M. Paasinen A. Andersson C. Holtta E. Nature. 1992; 360: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 17Packham G. Cleveland J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5741-5747Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), whereas overexpression of CDK4 partially restores cell cycle progression in c-Myc null fibroblasts (18Hermeking H. Rago C. Schumacher M., Li, Q. Barret J.F. Obaya A.J. O'Connell B.C. Mateyak M.K. Tam W. Kohlhuber F. Dang C.V. Sedivy J.M. Eick D. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2229-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) Several other targets have been reported to be transforming and/or tumorigenic or to affect cellular growth properties (19Lewis B.C.

Such studies, coupled with the fact that many targets appear to encode proteins with common functions, have suggested that reconstruction of the complete c-Myc phenotype requires the concurrent deregulation of multiple target genes, many of which possess overlapping functions. An example of such cooperativity is that between the c-Myc targets rcl and lactate dehydrogenase-A, neither of which is tumorigenic when overexpressed individually in Rat1a fibroblasts (19Lewis B.C.

Campbell S.E. Shim H. Orlowski R.Z. Dang C.V. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6178-6183PubMed Google Scholar). We have also used cDNA microarrays to identify a large number of both positive and negative c-Myc target transcripts in murine myeloid cells (14Nesbit C.E. Tersak J.M. Grove L.E. Drzal A. Cho I.H. Prochownik E.V. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3200-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We have shown that the regulation of these genes depends upon a functional c-Myc transactivation domain, comprising the N-terminal approximately 150 amino acids of the protein. Small deletions within the transactivation domain lead to the loss of the ability of c-Myc to regulate defined subsets of these target genes properly and to execute some biological functions. In the present work, we have studied one such c-Myc target gene in greater detail. Transcripts for this gene (hereafter referred to as c-Myc Target in MyeloidCells-1(MT-MC1) 1The abbreviations used are: MT-MC1c-Myc target in myeloid cells-1CMVcytomegalovirusEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayESTexpressed sequence tagFBSfetal bovine serumF-MELFriend erythroleukemiaGFPgreen fluorescent proteinIL-3interleukin-3ORFopen reading frameTUNELterminal nucelotidyl transferase-mediated UTP nick end labeling ) are highly up-regulated by c-Myc overexpression in the 32D murine myeloid cell line (14Nesbit C.E. Tersak J.M. Grove L.E. Drzal A. Cho I.H. Prochownik E.V. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3200-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Except for a putative nuclear localization signal, the highly conserved MT-MC1 protein contains no obvious structural or functional motifs, although it shares homology with a small putative DNA helicase encoded by the nuclear polyhedrosis virus of Bombyx mori (24Maeda S. Kamita S.G. Kataoka H. Virology. 1991; 180: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 25Kamita S.G. Maeda S. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 190: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We report here that overexpression of MT-MC1 affects morphology, apoptosis, genomic stability, and differentiation. The MT-MC1 promoter is also a direct c-Myc target. Together, these studies implicate MT-MC1 as an important and proximal c-Myc-responsive gene, which mediates many of the known phenotypic features associated with c-Myc overexpression. c-Myc target in myeloid cells-1 cytomegalovirus electrophoretic mobility shift assay expressed sequence tag fetal bovine serum Friend erythroleukemia green fluorescent protein interleukin-3 open reading frame terminal nucelotidyl transferase-mediated UTP nick end labeling Rat1a fibroblasts and Friend erythroleukemia (F-MEL) cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (all from Invitrogen). COS-7 cells were cultured similarly except that 10% supplemented calf serum (Invitrogen) was used instead of FBS. 32D murine myeloid cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS and 10% conditioned medium from the interleukin-3 (IL-3)-producing WEHI-3B cell line. 32D-c-Myc and 32D-neo cells have been described previously (26Nesbit C.E. Fan S. Zhang H. Prochownik E.V. Blood. 1998; 92: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,27Nesbit C.E. Grove L.E. Yin X.-Y. Prochownik E.V. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 731-741PubMed Google Scholar). The former were obtained after stable transfection with a c-Myc expression vector, whereas the latter were obtained after transfection with the empty parental vector. For some experiments we used previously described pooled clones of 32D-c-Myc and 32D-neo cell lines stably transfected with a puromycin-selectable expression vector for cyclin B1, or with the empty parental vector (32D-c-Myc/cyclin B, 32D-c-Myc/puro cells, 32D-neo/cyclin B, or 32D-neo/puro cells) (Ref. 9Yin X.-Y. Grove L. Datta N.S. Katula K. Long M.W. Prochownik E.V. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6487-6493PubMed Google Scholar). We also established a pooled population of 32D-MT-MC1 cells transfected with the same cyclin B1 or parental vectors. All cultures were split at least twice weekly to maintain continuous logarithmic growth. Transfections of 32D and F-MEL cells were performed by electroporation as described previously using plasmid DNAs linearized in the vector backbone (26Nesbit C.E. Fan S. Zhang H. Prochownik E.V. Blood. 1998; 92: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Nesbit C.E. Grove L.E. Yin X.-Y. Prochownik E.V. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 731-741PubMed Google Scholar, 28Prochownik E.V. Kukowska J.F. Nature. 1986; 322: 848-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Transfections into COS-7 and Rat1a cells were performed with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) using supercoiled DNA. Selection for stable 32D, F-MEL, and Rat1a transfectants was performed in 0.5 mg/ml (absolute concentration) G418 (Invitrogen) or 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) as indicated. Soft agar colony assays for Rat1a transfectants were performed in 60-mm tissue culture dishes by mixing 4 × 103 cells in 2 ml of 0.35% molten agarose (Invitrogen) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% FBS. The mixture was plated on a 4-ml layer of 0.7% agarose prepared in the same medium. The number and sizes of the resulting colonies were determined by microscopic visualization 12–14 days later. Erythroid differentiation of F-MEL cells was induced by plating the cells into fresh medium at a density of ∼2 × 105cells/ml followed 1 day later by the addition of dimethyl sulfoxide to a final concentration of 1.5%. The extent of differentiation was assessed by benzidine staining as described previously (28Prochownik E.V. Kukowska J.F. Nature. 1986; 322: 848-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Fluorescence microscopy of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing cells was performed as described previously (29Yin X.-Y. Gupta K. Han W.P. Levitan E.S. Prochownik E.V. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6621-6634Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). 3–4-week-old nude mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Each animal was inoculated subcutaneously with 107 Rat1a fibroblasts resuspended in 0.1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum. Tumor growth was monitored twice weekly. At the end of the monitoring period, animals were sacrificed by CO2asphyxiation, and tumor samples were removed and either preserved in formalin or used for RNA extraction. Thin sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined by standard light microscopy. All plasmid DNAs were purified on Qiagen columns (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) according to the directions of the supplier. The β-galactosidase expression vector pCMV-β-galPuro was used in some transfection experiments as a control for transfection efficiency. The MT-MC1 expression plasmid pSVLneoMT-MT-MC1 was constructed by PCR-mediated amplification of the entire coding sequence of MT-MC1. PCR primers consisted of the following sequences: forward, 5′-CGC CTC GAG GAC ATT ATG GCT AAT AAC ACC A-3′; reverse, 5′-CGC GTC GAC AAC AAC GAA ATC TCA GAC TCA GG-3′. In both cases, the italicized regions indicate GC clamps and engineered XhoI sites. The triplet in bold in the first sequence indicates the MT-MC1 initiation methionine codon, whereas in the second sequence it indicates the reverse complement of the translation termination site. After amplification, the product was digested with XhoI and then ligated into the XhoI site of the pSVLneo-5′-MT vector. This resulted in the creation of an MT-MC1 cDNA fused in-frame at its 5′-end with an Myc epitope tag. Both the correct orientation of the insert and its reading frame were confirmed by DNA sequencing. A GFP-MT-MC1 fusion protein expression vector was obtained by cloning the same PCR fragment into the SalI site of the pEGFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH), with the orientation and reading frame again being confirmed by sequencing. The MT-MC1 promoter was isolated from a Sv129J strain murine BAC library (Incyte Genomics, St. Louis, MO) by hybridization with an MT-MC1 cDNA probe. An approximately 5-kb XhoI fragment containing the extreme 5′-end of the coding region was subcloned into a pBluescript vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A DNA sequence of nearly 2.4 kb of the 5′-flanking region was obtained by standard dideoxy automated DNA sequencing using a combination of ABI 373 and 377 DNA sequencers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). For expression studies of the MT-MC1 promoter, the region between −281 and +103 relative to the start of transcription was amplified using the upstream primer 5′-CGC ACG CGT CTT CTC CTG CAG CCT GCT GA-3′ and the downstream primer 5′-CGC CTC GAG AGC CAG TGT GTC CAC AAC CAG-3′. Italicized regions correspond to GC clamps and XhoI and MluI restriction sites, respectively. After amplification, the product was digested with XhoI and MluI and cloned directionally into the pGL2-luciferase expression cassette (Promega, Madison, WI). Mutagenesis of each of the two E-box elements in the promoter was performed using the QuikChange-XL in vitro mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Each mutation was verified by DNA sequencing. The consequences of each mutation were determined by cotransfecting either 32D-neo or 32D-c-Myc cells with 5 μg of each of the above linearized wild-type or mutant promoter-luciferase vectors together with 1 μg of linearized pCMV-β-galPuro. Stable transfectants were selected in G418 and puromycin as described above. Luciferase assays were performed as described previously (7Yin X.-Y. Grove L. Datta N. Long M.W. Prochownik E.V. Oncogene. 1999; 17: 1177-1184Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar) after first adjusting the amounts of cellular lysates for differences in β-galactosidase activity. Two E-boxes were identified in the MT-MC1 promoter region, the first (“A”: CACGTG) located at position –1331 relative to the start of transcription, and the second (“B”: CATGTG) located at position −127. The following oligonucleotides and their reverse complements (not shown), containing either the wild-type (WT) or mutant (mut) E-box were synthesized: A (WT), 5′-GTC TCG ATA CAC GTG TCT CTA GAC-3′; A (mut), 5′-GTC TCG ATA CAT GAG TCT CTA GAC-3′; B (WT), 5′-TCT GAG AGC CAT GTG GAA TTC CAA-3′; and B (mut), 5′-TCT GAG AGC CTT GAG GAA TTC CAA-3′ where italicized bases denote the wild-type or mutant E-box. 100 ng of each oligonucleotide was end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverley, MA) and 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity >3,000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to specific activities of at least 2 × 108 dpm/μg. Each oligonucleotide was then annealed with a 10-fold molar excess of its unlabeled complementary strand in 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA by heating the mixture to 80 °C and allowing it to cool to ambient temperature over 2–3 h. For competition experiments with unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides, equimolar amounts of each unlabeled complementary strand were annealed. Recombinant c-Myc and Max(S) proteins were purified to >90% purity using hexahistidine-agarose affinity chromatography (30Prochownik E.V. VanAntwerp M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 960-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Max(S) is the 151-amino acid isoform of Max which binds DNA as a heterodimer, but not as a homodimer, in association with c-Myc (30Prochownik E.V. VanAntwerp M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 960-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 31Zhang H. Fan S. Prochownik E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17416-17424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). EMSAs were performed with ∼20 pg of32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide. Recombinant proteins (∼20 ng of each) were added to a final volume of 20 μl in binding buffer and incubated at 40 °C for 20 min before electrophoresis. Flow cytometric analysis of propidium iodide-stained nuclei was performed on a Becton-Dickinson FACSTAR fluorescence-activated cell sorter (7Yin X.-Y. Grove L. Datta N. Long M.W. Prochownik E.V. Oncogene. 1999; 17: 1177-1184Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 9Yin X.-Y. Grove L. Datta N.S. Katula K. Long M.W. Prochownik E.V. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6487-6493PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 2 × 104 cells were analyzed for each assay. Quantitation was performed using single histogram statistics. In some experiments cells were incubated with 60 ng/ml Colecemid (Sigma) for 16 h prior to preparing nuclei. For Western blotting, transfected cells were pelleted by low speed centrifugation, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in standard SDS-PAGE buffer containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini Mixture, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Approximately 50 μg of each lysate was resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a semidry electroblotting apparatus (Owl Scientific, Cambridge, MA). Membranes were incubated with the 9E10 anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or with an anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (CLONTECH) followed by extensive washing and a second incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Santa Cruz). Blots were then developed using a Renaissance chemiluminescence kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the directions of the supplier. For Northern blotting, total RNAs were extracted as described previously using the guanidine HCl method (32Smith M.J. Charron-Prochownik D.C. Prochownik E.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5333-5339Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). 5 μg of each RNA sample was resolved on 1% agarose-formaldehyde gels, blotted to Nytran membranes (Schleicher & Schuell), and hybridized in UltraHyb solution (Ambion, Austin, TX) at 42 °C with cDNA probes corresponding to the coding regions of the indicated genes. After extensive posthybridization washes, filters were exposed to BioMax film at –70 °C using a BioMax intensifying screen (Eastman Kodak). cDNA probes for Northern blots have been described previously (14Nesbit C.E.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17416-17424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We reported previously the results of a cDNA microarray analysis that compared the gene expression profile of control 32D murine myeloid cells (32D-neo cells) with that of 32D cells stably transfected with a c-Myc expression vector (32D-c-Myc cells) (14Nesbit C.E. Tersak J.M. Grove L.E. Drzal A. Cho I.H. Prochownik E.V. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3200-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A number of differentially expressed transcripts were identified and confirmed by Northern blotting. MT-MC1 was characterized previously only as an expressed sequence tag (EST) (Incyte Pharmaceuticals EST 444412). We again verified that MT-MC1 is highly up-regulated in 32D-c-Myc cells and is represented by two transcripts of approximately 1.0 and 2.2 kb. In addition, the up-regulation of MT-MC1 by c-Myc is unaffected by the obligate hematopoetic cytokine IL-3 (Fig. 1 A, top panel, and Ref. 14Nesbit C.E. Tersak J.M. Grove L.E. Drzal A. Cho I.H. Prochownik E.V. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3200-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar. The cDNA sequence showed that its 3′-end terminated with a poly(A) sequence 22 residues in length and was preceded by two identical consensus polyadenlyation signals (ATTAAA). A second, approximately 1.5-kb cDNA, obtained by screening a murine lung cDNA library, contained a 3′-end that extended beyond that of the original cDNA clone for an additional 565 nucleotides. The remainder of the sequence was identical to that of the first cDNA except that it extended 50 nucleotides further in the 5′-direction. To confirm that the larger transcript shown in Fig. 1 A contained the additional 3′-sequence encoded by the longer of the two cDNAs, an identical Northern blot was hybridized with a 525-bp cDNA fragment derived from the region downstream of the poly(A) signal at position 902. As expected, only the larger transcript hybridized this fragment (Fig. 1 A, middle panel). These results indicate that the two transcripts shown in the top panel of Fig. 1 A are the result of alternative polyadenylation. A comparison of our longest cDNA with that of the longer transcript shown in Fig. 1 A suggests that an additional 500–600 bp are absent from the cloned sequence. The reading frame of the cDNA extended to the 5′-end of the molecule depicted in Fig. 1 B. However, additional sequencing of genomic DNA, combined with nuclease protection and primer extension analyses, indicated that transcription initiated only about 50 nucleotides upstream of this sequence (not shown). Therefore, we tentatively assigned the first ATG shown at position 77 of Fig. 1 B as the translational start site. This codon resided within the context of an excellent Kozak consensus element (A/C XXATGG) (35Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 5233-5252Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Conceptual translation of the cDNA sequence beginning at this site indicated the presence of a 188-amino acid protein. The predicted size of the protein (21.2 kDa) corresponded well with the observed apparent molecular mass as determined by SDS-PAGE of in vitro translated product (not shown). A computer-assisted data base search for structural motifs within the MT-MC1 protein showed two putative cAMP phosphorylation sites (amino acids 49–53 and 110–114), two casein kinase II phosphorylation sites (amino acids 81–85 and 155–159), and four putative protein kinase C phosphorylation sites (amino acids 46–49, 61–64, 113–116, and 165–168). A potential bipartite nuclear localization signals (RRRR, amino acids 47–50; and RRPR, amino acids 62–65) was also noted (36Garcia-Bustos J. Heitman J. Hall M.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 83-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Sequence homology to other proteins in the GenBank, SwissProt, and EMBL data bases revealed MT-MC1 to be highly homologous (79% identical, 84% similar) to a putative open reading frame of unknown function in the human genome (GenBank accession no. XP015265) that maps to chromosomal region 6q25, a region deleted in some lymphoid malignancies. Both the human and mouse sequences initiated from the identical methionine codon of their conceptual reading frames, thus lending additional credence to our selection of this amino acid as the true initiation site. Additional homology (27% identity, 48% similarity) was noted between amino acids 15–109 of MT-MC1 and amino acids 133–222 of a putative Saccharomyces cerevisiae open reading frame of 276 amino acids (GenBank accession no. YGL096w) located on chromosome VII, which bears similarity to the Cup9p protein involved in copper homeostasis. However, the most significant degree of homology (50% identity, 53% similarity) was between amino acids 45–93 of MT-MC1 and amino acids 17–56 of the 65-amino acid-long nucleocapsid DNA-binding protein, p6.9/ORF100, of the B. mori nuclear polyhedrosis virus (GenBank accession no. NP047501.1). Hybridization of the MT-MC1 coding sequence to a mouse RNA master blot (Fig. 1 C) (CLONTECH) indicated that MT-MC1 was widely expressed, albeit at generally low levels. To obtain greater insight into the function of MT-MC1, we expressed it transiently as a full-length GFP fusion protein in COS-7 cells. Western blotting of total cell lysates showed the presence of the appropriately sized fusion protein (Fig. 2 A, right lane). GFP-MT-MC1 was largely localized to the nucleus of the transfected cells, whereas control GFP was expressed much more diffusely (Fig. 2 B). In addition to the above transient transfection studies, we also created Rat1a fibroblast and 32D myeloid cell lines that stably expressed full-length, Myc epitope-tagged MT-MC1 protein. Immunofluorescence staining of the former cells confirmed the nuclear localization of MT-MC1 (Fig. 2 B). Western analysis of individual Rat1a clones and of pooled 32D transfectants revealed the presence of the appropriately sized protein in all cases (Fig. 2 D). The c-Myc oncoprotein can exert profound effects upon growth, apoptosis, morphology, differentiation, and transformation (1Henriksson M. Luscher B. Adv.

Therefore, we first determined whether overexpression of MT-MC1 in the Rat1a or 32D cells depicted in Fig. 2 D affected their growth properties. As seen in Fig. 3 A, all of the MT-MC1-expressing cells showed growth rates indistinguishable from those of control cell lines transfected with the empty parental vector as well as from those expressing c-Myc. We conclude that MT-MC1 does not significantly affect the proliferative capacity of these cells. c-Myc overexpression may promote apoptotic cell death, both in Rat1a fibroblasts deprived of serum and in 32D cells deprived of IL-3 (37Askew D.S.

The PBGS protein, which is highly conserved in both sequence and structure (1Jaffe E.K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2000; 56: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), catalyzes an early essential step in the biosynthesis of the tetrapyrrole cofactors such as heme and chlorophyll (Fig. 1 A). Despite the fact that much is known about the PBGS structure, the sequence of bond-making and bond-breaking events that follow formation of the ternary complex of PBGS with the two substrate molecules is the subject of active discussion (2Erskine P.T.

Based on an extensive phylogenetic variation in the number and kinds of metal ions used for catalytic and/or allosteric roles, it is possible that the order of chemical events in the enzyme-catalyzed reaction mechanism may not be phylogenetically conserved. In order to probe the mechanism, 4,7-dioxosebacic acid (4,7-DOSA) and 4-oxosebacic acid (4-OSA), illustrated in Fig. 1 B, were designed and found to act as suicide substrates for Escherichia coli PBGS (6Jarret C.

These inhibitors mimic an addition product intermediate in which the first bond formed between the two 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) substrate molecules creates a carbinolamine that dehydrates to a Schiff base (6Jarret C.

More recently, a strong species-selective inhibition of PBGS by 4,7-DOSA has been correlated with an active site variation in metal ion usage (3Kervinen J. Jaffe E.K. Stauffer F. Neier R. Wlodawer A. Zdanov A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8227-8236Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Here we have characterized a very different species selectivity for 4-OSA inhibition of PBGS and provide a 1.9-Å crystal structure of 4-OSA-inhibited E. coli PBGS. This structure was compared with an improved 1.7-Å crystal structure of E. coli PBGS inhibited by 4,7-DOSA and with analogous structures of these inhibitors bound to yeast PBGS (for which, however, there are no kinetic inhibition data) (5Erskine P.T.

All of the PBGS enzymes used in this study were cloned and expressed in E. coli, and purification and detailed characterization has been described previously (7Kervinen J.

Human PBGS was the C162A variant of the natural N59 isozyme, and it has kinetic properties closely resembling the wild type (13Jaffe E.K. Martins J., Li, J. Kervinen J. Dunbrack R.L., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1531-1537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Human PBGS mutants characterized with 4-OSA were N59/C162A/H131A/C223A (called MinusZnA) (13Jaffe E.K. Martins J., Li, J. Kervinen J. Dunbrack R.L., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1531-1537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and two new chimeric proteins (HsΔALK and HsEclid) containing portions of the E. coli PBGS active site lid. The chimeric proteins were prepared from the plasmid encoding wild type human PBGS variant N59/C162A by the QuikChange method of mutagenesis. The sense strand primers were CCGTTCCGTGATGCGCTAAGTCAGCATTAAAAGGCGACCGCCGCTGC for HsΔALK and CCGTTCCGTGAAGCTGCTGGGTCAGCCTTAAAAGGCGACCGCAAAGCTATCAG for HsEclid. The enzyme assay measures the formation of porphobilinogen from ALA. The assay conditions at optimal pH and with a full complement of required and allosteric metal ions in the standard 5-min assay procedure for each of the five PBGS were performed as described previously (3Kervinen J. Jaffe E.K. Stauffer F. Neier R. Wlodawer A. Zdanov A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8227-8236Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Human mutants MinusZnA, HsΔALK, and HsEclid were assayed in the same fashion as the wild type. To ensure reliable A555 values, assays of low specific activity mutants used a 30-min incubation with substrate. Enzyme concentrations were measured with Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent (Pierce) relative to a standard curve prepared with bovine serum albumin. The five species of PBGS (1 μm subunit) were preincubated under optimal assay conditions for 10 min at 37 °C prior to the addition of 4-OSA over the concentration range of 10 μm to 3 mm; preincubation was allowed to proceed for various times ranging from 90 min to 22 h at 37 °C before initiating the formation of porphobilinogen by addition of ALA-HCl to a final concentration of 10 mm. Porphobilinogen formation was allowed to proceed for 5 min. For E. coli PBGS, 4-OSA inhibition data were fitted to the equation v/vo = 1/(1+([I]/IC50)) (14Copeland R. Lombardo D. Giannaras J. Decicco C. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1995; 5: 1947-1952Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar) using the program SigmaPlot (SPSS®, Chicago, IL). For other species of PBGS the apparent IC50 values for 4-OSA were well above millimolar concentrations and the 10 μm–3 mm inhibition data could not be fit well. In these cases a simple direct comparison of the five species used a 4-OSA concentration of 3 mm and a 24-h enzyme/inhibitor incubation time prior to the addition of ALA. Crystallizations were carried out with both 4-OSA and 4,7-DOSA as described previously for 4,7-DOSA (3Kervinen J. Jaffe E.K. Stauffer F. Neier R. Wlodawer A. Zdanov A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8227-8236Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In both cases, E. coli PBGS (9 mg ml−1 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm βME, 20 μm ZnCl2, 10 mmMgCl2) was incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with a 16-fold molar excess of the inhibitor (∼4 mm) prior to setting up the crystallization trays. An equal volume of clarified protein was mixed with reservoir buffer containing 1–6% polyethylene glycol 3350, 10% glycerol, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and 0.02% sodium azide. The crystals with a diamond-like shape appeared in 1–3 days, and the largest crystals grew to their final size (up to 0.6 × 0.6 × 0.3 mm3) in approximately 2 weeks. Cryoprotection was carried out by transferring a crystal to reservoir solutions containing 17, 23, and 30% glycerol, respectively (3 min in each solution), and the crystal was flash-frozen in a liquid nitrogen vapor. X-ray diffraction data for both complexes were collected from one crystal at 100 K using a QUANTUM-4 CCD detector mounted at synchrotron beamline X9B at Brookhaven National Synchrotron Light Source facility. The data sets consisted of 180 frames chosen to cover at least one asymmetric unit with each frame corresponding to 0.5° oscillation exposed for 35 s. Crystals belong to a tetragonal system, space group, P4212; unit cell parameters, a = b = 129.0 Å, and c = 142.8 Å with two molecules per asymmetric unit. Diffraction intensities were processed with the HKL2000 suite of programs (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar), resulting in final data sets with Rmerge(I) = 5.1 and 5.6% for 126,253 and 92,714 independent reflections and with completeness of 95.7 and 99.8% for the 40–1.7 and 40–1.9 Å resolution range for 4,7-DOSA and 4-OSA complexes, respectively. Because the crystals were in both cases isomorphous to that of E. coli PBGS complexed with 4,7-DOSA (PDB entry 1I8J), rigid body refinement of the PBGS dimer against the corresponding diffraction data was sufficient to properly orient the protein model in the respective crystal unit cell. Refinement was carried out with program package CNS (16Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar) with weak non-crystallographic symmetry restraints corresponding to weight 25. Model building was performed with program O (17Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). The final models included one dimer of PBGS molecule complexed with two respective inhibitor molecules, 498 and 433 water molecules for 4,7-DOSA and 4-OSA, respectively, as well as two Zn2+ and two Mg2+ ions. Five glycerol molecules were found in the 4-OSA structure. The crystallographic R-factors were 19.5 and 20.6%, R(free) parameters were 24.3 and 26.3% for the 1.7- and 1.9-Å resolution data, and the RMS deviations for bond lengths and bond angles were 0.018 Å and 1.8° for 4,7-DOSA and 0.019 Å and 2.0° for 4-OSA, respectively. The coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the PDB codes 1L6S and 1L6Y for immediate release. The inactivation of PBGS by 4,7-DOSA was shown previously to be dependent both upon the concentration of the inhibitor and the preincubation time of the inhibitor and enzyme prior to addition of substrate (3Kervinen J. Jaffe E.K. Stauffer F. Neier R. Wlodawer A. Zdanov A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8227-8236Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This is also true for 4-OSA, which was a less potent inactivator than 4,7-DOSA. Fig. 2 A illustrates the time and concentration dependence for the interaction of 4-OSA with E. coli PBGS using enzyme/inhibitor incubation times of 94 min and 16 h and 4-OSA concentrations from 10 μm to 3 mm. For comparison we also included data from a comparable 100-min incubation of E. coli PBGS in which 4,7-DOSA was the inhibitor (3Kervinen J. Jaffe E.K. Stauffer F. Neier R. Wlodawer A. Zdanov A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8227-8236Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These data indicate that 4-OSA is far less potent against E. coli PBGS than is 4,7-DOSA, consistent with prior reports (6Jarret C. Stauffer F. Henz M.E. Marty M. Luond R.M. Bobalova J. Schurmann P. Neier R. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 185-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Using the approximation of Copeland et al. (14Copeland R. Lombardo D. Giannaras J. Decicco C. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1995; 5: 1947-1952Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the IC50 values for E. coliPBGS inhibition by 4-OSA at 94 min and 16 h are 0.57 ± 0.06 mm and 0.22 ± 0.01 mm, respectively. The IC50 for 4,7-DOSA at 100 min of incubation with E. coli PBGS is 0.039 ± 0.002 mm. The reduced sensitivity to 4-OSA relative to 4,7-DOSA is also true for human,Bradyrhizobium japonicum, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pisum sativum (pea) PBGS, where a similar experiment showed marginal if any inactivation by 4-OSA across the range of 10 μm to 3 mm 4-OSA. To compare the five species, Fig. 2 B illustrates a 24-h preincubation of 3 mm 4-OSA with all five PBGS and shows a high selectivity for inactivation of E. coli PBGS. The control reactions wherein inhibitor was omitted did not lose any significant activity. The high selectivity of 4-OSA inactivation for E. coli PBGS is in sharp contrast to the species selectivity of inactivation by 4,7-DOSA (3Kervinen J. Jaffe E.K. Stauffer F. Neier R. Wlodawer A. Zdanov A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8227-8236Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The latter showed a marked preference for the Zn2+-utilizing PBGS and was highly effective against human PBGS, which contains two different types of Zn2+ binding sites. In that case, evaluation of an active human PBGS mutant (MinusZnA) that lacked the nonessential Zn2+ showed reduced sensitivity to 4,7-DOSA. Of the five species evaluated, only human and E. coli PBGS use a catalytic Zn2+. Because the number and types of Zn2+ sites are a significantly different between human and E. coli PBGS, this MinusZnA human PBGS was also evaluated with 4-OSA, and the results are included in Fig. 2 C. Consistent with the notion that MinusZnA is more like E. coli PBGS, MinusZnA retains only ∼65% activity after a 22-h incubation with 3 mm 4-OSA. Thus, MinusZnA is significantly more sensitive to inactivation by 4-OSA than is human PBGS, but it remains far less sensitive than E. coliPBGS. In search for the structural basis for the high selectivity of 4-OSA against E. coli PBGS, we compared the known structures (and sequences) of the PBGS to define unique features of E. coliPBGS. One significant variable feature in the PBGS family of proteins is the length and sequence of the active site lid. Based on the E. coli PBGS crystal structure, the lid is defined as the stretch from Ala196 to Gln219. The lid includes all of the residues in this region that are found to be disordered in PBGS structures 1AW5, 1B4K, and 1E51. Fig. 3 A shows a structure-based sequence alignment of the active site lid of human, yeast, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, B. japonicum, and P. sativum PBGS, which is different from previously published sequence-based alignments. Fig. 3 B shows a color-coded structural overlay of the lid region from PBGS corresponding to PDB codes 1E51 (human), 1YLV (yeast), 1I8J (E. coli), and 1B4K (P. aeruginosa). E. coliPBGS is unique among those tested with 4-OSA in that it has the shortest lid sequence. To evaluate the significance of this variable, we created, prepared, and characterized two chimeric “lid-switch” PBGS based on human PBGS using portions of the E. coli lid sequence. The minimal lid switch chimeric protein contains the small portion of the E. coli lid that varies in backbone structure. The sequence of this variant, called HsΔALK, is included in Fig. 3 A. HsΔALK is an active PBGS with a specific activity of ∼4% of wild type human PBGS and a normal Km value. Purified HsΔALK contains 3.5 Zn2+/octamer. As predicted from its increased sequence similarity with E. coli PBGS, HsΔALK has increased sensitivity to inhibition by 4-OSA (see Fig. 2 C). A less predictable result was observed when a larger portion of the lid sequence was switched. The human PBGS variant HsEclid contains the E. coli PBGS lid sequence from Arg204 to Gln219 (E. coli numbering) as illustrated in Fig. 3 A. HsEclid is also an active PBGS with a specific activity of ∼12% of wild type human PBGS and a normal Km value. HsEclid was found to purify with 4.5 Zn2+/octamer. Inconsistent with other human PBGS variants that are designed to resemble E. coli PBGS, HsEclid is insensitive to inhibition by 4-OSA (see Fig. 2 C). The human PBGS variant MinusZnA, whose behavior with 4-OSA is described above, is included in Fig. 3 because one of the mutations (C223A) is in this active site lid region. The Zn2+ stoichiometry of HsΔALK and HsEclid suggests that these human PBGS variants retain the property of half-site reactivity, a kinetic property that is well established for human PBGS but not for E. coli PBGS. The PBGS all share a common octameric structure with two monomers forming a dimer around either the non-crystallographic or crystallographic 2-fold symmetry axis and four such dimers forming a PBGS octamer around the 4-fold symmetry axis. Each monomer/subunit forms an αβ-barrel, the center of which holds the active site residues, while an N-terminal arm that varies in length between species is mutually wrapped around the neighboring subunit forming a compact dimeric structure. The N-terminal arms are involved in extensive subunit interactions within and between dimers. Some PBGS crystal structures show an individual subunit as the asymmetric crystallographic unit, and others (such as those presented here) show a dimer as the asymmetric unit. A variety of data have been interpreted to indicate that an oligomeric structure is required for activity (see Ref. 7Kervinen J. Dunbrack R.L., Jr. Litwin S. Martins J. Scarrow R.C. Volin M. Yeung A.T. Yoon E. Jaffe E.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9018-9029Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Each active site region is confined to one subunit and isolated from bulk solvent by a lid. The 4,7-DOSA-containing E. coli PBGS was the first structure to show that the lid-closed configuration involves extensive hydrogen bonding with the carboxyl group of the A-side ALA molecule, which makes up the acetyl half of porphobilinogen (see Fig. 1 A and below) (3Kervinen J. Jaffe E.K. Stauffer F. Neier R. Wlodawer A. Zdanov A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8227-8236Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The structure is consistent with the notion that P-side ALA, which makes up the propionyl half of the product, binds first and that the A-side ALA binds second (see Refs. 18Jordan P.M. Seehra J.S. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1980; 5: 240-242Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar and 19Jaffe E.K. Hanes D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9348-9353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to other αβ-barrel enzymes, the ordering and disordering of the active site lid appears to be essential for substrate binding, isolation of the active site from bulk solvent, and product release. The current structures better define these lid motions. The lid residues seen to interact with active site ligands presented here and elsewhere are denoted in Fig. 3. Here we present the crystal structures of E. coli PBGS that has been inactivated by 4-OSA and of another one that has been inactivated by 4,7-DOSA. The latter structure is the same complex that we already published (PDB code 1I8J); however, this time resolution of the diffraction data was extended to 1.7 Å so that we were able to locate 183 extra water molecules, clarify that both Cys133Aand Cys133B are adducted with β-mercaptoethanol (see below), and generally provide a more accurate structural description of the protein and the inhibitors. A major new observation based on this structure is a significant variation in the position of the inhibitor half that mimics A-side ALA. Such a result has not been reported for the comparable complex of 4-OSA with yeast PBGS (5Erskine P.T. Coates L. Newbold R. Brindley A.A. Stauffer F. Wood S.P. Warren M.J. Cooper J.B. Shoolingin-Jordan P.M. Neier R. FEBS Lett. 2001; 503: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Similar to the complex of 4,7-DOSA-inhibited PBGS, the 4-OSA-inhibited E. coli PBGS asymmetric unit contains a dimer, and each subunit of the 4-OSA complex contains one inhibitor molecule, one Zn2+bound at the active site, and one Mg2+ bound at the allosteric site (Fig. 4). Unlike the 4,7-DOSA-inhibited PBGS, the 4-OSA complex can form only one Schiff base linkage between each inhibitor and PBGS subunit; this linkage is observed. The RMS deviation between the Cα atoms of the two monomers forming a non-crystallographic dimer is 0.25 Å, whereas the RMS deviation between the 4,7-DOSA- and 4-OSA-inhibited PBGS dimers is 0.24 Å. Thus, we conclude that there are no significant differences between the monomers of the dimer or the dimers themselves upon binding either to 4,7-DOSA or 4-OSA (except for part of the lid near Arg204, described below), although the conformations of some side chains (mainly those located on the surface of the octamer) are occasionally different. The average temperature factors are 43.2 and 43.4 Å2 for monomers A and B of the 4-OSA-containing complex and 30.2 and 31.2 Å2 for monomers A and B of the 4,7-DOSA-containing complex. This indicates that the monomers in each complex have essentially the same degree of flexibility, although the crystals of the 4,7-DOSA complex have better internal order. The symmetry seen in E. coli PBGS dimers is in sharp contrast to the high resolution asymmetric dimer seen in P. aeruginosaPBGS (PDB code 1B4K) (20Frankenberg N. Erskine P.T. Cooper J.B. Shoolingin-Jordan P.M. Jahn D. Heinz D.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and the less well resolved human PBGS, which contains extensive disorder (PDB code 1E51, unpublished structure). The two E. coli PBGS structures presented here clarify the amino acid identity of position 133, which had previously been identified as a lysine (2Erskine P.T. Norton E. Cooper J.B. Lambert R. Coker A. Lewis G. Spencer P. Sarwar M. Wood S.P. Warren M.J. Shoolingin-Jordan P.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4266-4276Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The DNA sequence indicates Cys133 and mass spectroscopy analysis of an AspN digest was obtained herein to demonstrate the existence of a cysteine in this position. Because Cys133 is located on the surface of the protein, which has been purified and stored in the presence of mercaptoethanol, this residue appears as an adduct of βME and cysteine (S, S-2-(hydroxyethyl)thiocysteine). The adduct was first reported in a V23C variant of staphylococcal nuclease (21Wynn R. Harkins P.C. Richards F.M. Fox R.O. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1026-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and the current electron density is an excellent fit to this model. The inhibitor molecules are clearly seen in the difference electron density maps in the area of the active site next to Lys194 and Lys246 in both monomers. In the case of 4,7-DOSA there are two covalent linkages between the protein and the inhibitor, and in the case of 4-OSA there is one covalent linkage. Fig. 5 A illustrates an electron density map of 4-OSA bound to the enzyme, and Fig. 5 B shows a comparison between the 4-OSA- and 4,7-DOSA-inhibited proteins. In both cases C1-C5 of the inhibitor are bound with a Schiff base linkage between C4 and the ε-amino group of Lys246. In these cases, as well as in related PBGS structures with inhibitors bound in the P-side ALA binding pocket (PDB codes: 1B4E, 1B4K, 1EB3, 1YLV, 1I8J,1GJP, 1H7N, 1H7P, 1H7R), the C1 carboxyl oxygens of the inhibitor make hydrogen bonds with Ser272 and Tyr311. The positions of the C2 and C3 atoms of each inhibitor are well defined but not equivalent to each other. The variation in these positions mimics the reported alternate conformations of levulinic acid bound as the P-side Schiff base to yeast PBGS (PDB code 1H7N) (22Erskine P.T. Newbold R. Brindley A.A. Wood S.P. Shoolingin-Jordan P.M. Warren M.J. Cooper J.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This variation defines the limited spatial flexibility of P-side ALA and dictates that these atoms cannot reorient much in response to required hybridization changes at C4. The position of C1-C4 of 4-OSA more closely resembles that of the product porphobilinogen. As reported previously for the 1.9-Å structure of 4,7-DOSA-inhibited E. coli PBGS, the bond between C5 and C6 of the inhibitor has a distorted cis-configuration (torsion angle of C4–C5–C6–C7 is ∼65°) to accommodate a second Schiff base linkage between C7 and the ε-amino group of Lys194. Because there is no Schiff base to Lys194 in the 4-OSA-inhibited enzyme, the conformation around the C5–C6 bond (torsion angle C4–C5–C6–C7 is ∼−88°) and the positions of C5-C10 of reacted 4-OSA are significantly different from those seen for 4,7-DOSA (Fig. 5 B). This suggests that A-side ALA has much greater positional flexibility than does P-side ALA. Positional flexibility is essential to accommodate the multiple hybridization changes required in the formation of porphobilinogen. In the case of both inhibitors, the A-side ALA half (C8–C10) extends out toward the lid where it makes extensive hydrogen-bond linkages between the C10 carboxyl oxygens and arginine residue(s). However, the hydrogen-bonding pattern is not the same for the two inhibitors, as illustrated schematically in Fig. 6. Unlike 4,7-DOSA, 4-OSA does not interact with Gln219through hydrogen bonds directly; instead it does so through a bridging water molecule. This is the same water molecule that forms similar bridging hydrogen bonds between Gln219 and Arg204 in the 4,7-DOSA-containing complex. To accommodate the different structure of the A-side half of the 4-OSA inhibitor, the side chain of Arg204 moves approximately 2.5 Å away from the position it occupied in the 4,7-DOSA complex (Fig. 5 B) and is locked in this new position by a hydrogen bond between its side chain NH1 atom and the carbonyl oxygen of Gly213. The position of Arg204 in the absence of an A-side ligand (structure 1B4E) is much"

The six cysteine residues in the ectodomain form three disulfide bonds. In this study, we replaced each of the cysteine residues of the β-subunit with serine individually and in several combinations. The mutant β-subunits were co-expressed with the α-subunit in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, and the role of each cysteine residue or disulfide bond in the α/β assembly, stability, and cell surface delivery of the α- and β-subunits and H+,K+-ATPase activity was studied. Mutant β-subunits with a replacement of the cytoplasmic and transmembrane cysteines preserved H+,K+-ATPase activity. All the mutant β-subunits with replacement(s) of the extracellular cysteines did not assemble with the α-subunit, resulting in loss of H+,K+-ATPase activity.

Among them, the six cysteine residues in the ectodomain form three disulfide bonds that are well conserved between H+,K+- and Na+,K+-ATPase β-subunits. These disulfide bonds are important for protein folding and for the maintenance of ATPase function, because the ATPase activities of both enzymes were abolished by reduction with dithiothreitol or 2-mercaptoethanol (24Chow D.C.

Na+,K+-ATPase activity was also abolished or severely suffered when any one of the three disulfide bonds of the β-subunit was disrupted by replacing the extracellular cysteine residue(s) by serine, as assessed by expressing the mutant Na+,K+-ATPases in Xenopus oocytes (27Noguchi S.

However, there have been no reports regarding the roles of each disulfide bond in the functional expression and cell surface targeting of Na+,K+-ATPase in mammalian cells. There also have been no reports demonstrating the precise role of each disulfide bond of the gastric H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit. In this study, we replaced each of the nine cysteine residues of gastric H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit by serine, transiently co-expressed the mutant β-subunits together with the wild-type α-subunit in HEK-293 cells (human embryonic kidney cell line), and studied the roles of each of the cysteine residues in the expression of the α- and β-subunits and in H+,K+-ATPase activity. We also abolished one, two, or all of the disulfide bonds by progressively introducing mutations in the extracellular cysteine residues, constructed stable cell lines co-expressing these mutant β-subunits together with the α-subunit, and examined the role of the disulfide bonds in the expression, stability, and cell surface delivery of the α- and β-subunits, α/β assembly, and H+,K+-ATPase activity. HEK-293 cells were a kind gift from Prof. Jonathan Lytton (University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada). pcDNA3 (G418) and pcDNA3.1/ZEO(+) vectors were obtained from Invitrogen.Pfu DNA polymerase was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). 2-Methyl-8-(phenyl-methoxy)imidazo[1,2-a] pyridine-3-acetonitrile (SCH 28080) was a kind gift from Dr. Peter Chiu (Schering-Plough Co., Kenilworth, NJ). Restriction enzymes and other DNA- and RNA-modifying enzymes were from Toyobo (Osaka, Japan) and New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Anti-gastric H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit monoclonal antibody 1H9 and anti-β-subunit monoclonal antibody 2B6 were obtained from Molecular Biological Laboratories (Nagoya, Japan). All other reagents were of molecular biology grade or the highest grade of purity available. H+,K+-ATPase α- and β-subunit cDNAs were prepared from rabbit gastric mucosae and cloned as described elsewhere (9Asano S. Tega Y. Konshi K. Fujioka M. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2740-2745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The α- and β-subunit cDNAs were digested with EcoRI and XhoI. The obtained fragments were each ligated into pcDNA3 or pcDNA3.1/ZEO(+) vector treated with EcoRI and XhoI. Introduction of site-directed mutations was carried out by sequential PCR steps as described elsewhere (6Asano S. Matsuda S. Tega Y. Shimizu K. Sakamoto S. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17668-17674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), in which appropriately mutated β-subunit cDNAs (segments between nucleotide 1 (EcoRI site) and 302 (AflII site) or between nucleotide 302 (AflII site) and 1036 (Eco47III site)) were prepared. For PCR amplification of the segment between the EcoRI and AflII sites, the 5′-flanking sense and 3′-flanking antisense primers were 5′-GCAATTAACCCTCACTAAAGG-3′ (T3 primer) and 5′-CGTGAACTTGCTGGAGAACTT-3′ (nucleotides 499–518). For PCR amplification of the segment between the AflII and Eco47III sites, the 5′-flanking sense and 3′-flanking antisense primers were 5′-GCTGAAGTCGCCAGGCGTAAC-3′ (nucleotides 281 to 301) and 5′-CCACGGGAAGCAGCGGACGC-3′ (nucleotides 1049–1068). Sense and antisense synthetic oligonucleotides, each 21 bases long containing one mutated base near the center, were designed. The cDNA of H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit in pBluescript SK(−) was used as a PCR template. PCR was routinely carried out in the presence of 200 μm each dNTP, 500 nm primers, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm(NH4)2SO4, 2 mmMgSO4, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2.5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase for 30 cycles. DNA sequencing was done by the dideoxy chain termination method using Autoread and Autocycle DNA sequencing kits and an ALFexpress DNA sequencer (Amersham Biosciences). After sequencing, the fragment amplified in the final PCR was digested with EcoRI plus AflII or AflII plus Eco47III and ligated back into the relevant position of the wild-type H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit construct. Cell culture of the HEK-293 cell line was carried out as described previously (9Asano S. Tega Y. Konshi K. Fujioka M. Takeguchi N. J. Biol.

For transient expression, α- and β-subunit cDNA transfection was performed by the calcium phosphate method with 10 μg of cesium chloride-purified DNA/10-cm dish. Cells were harvested 2 days after the DNA transfection. HEK-293 cells were first transfected with the wild-type or mutant H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit cDNA cloned in pcDNA3 (G418). Cells were selected with a selection medium containing 1 mg/ml Geneticin for 24 h after transfection and split 1:4 to 1:10. The cells were cultured for 1–2 weeks in the selection medium. Colonies resistant to Geneticin were isolated and screened for protein expression by immunofluorescence. Cells were re-cloned by limited dilution followed by screening for protein expression by Western blot and immunofluorescence. Established stable cell lines expressing the β-subunit were maintained in culture medium containing 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin. Cell lines expressing the β-subunit were then subjected to the second transfection with the H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit cDNA cloned in pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+). Cells were selected in a selection medium containing 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin and 0.2 mg/ml Zeocin and cloned twice by limited dilution. Established stable cell lines expressing both the α- and β-subunits were maintained in a culture medium containing 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin plus 0.2 mg/ml Zeocin.

The membrane fractions of HEK cells were run on the same SDS-polyacrylamide gel as a series of diluted gastric vesicle preparations and blotted. The blots were scanned using an optical scanning image system. The content of H+,K+-ATPase in the membrane fractions was estimated from the standard curve of the gastric vesicle preparation. Anti-gastric H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit antibody Ab1024 was previously raised against the carboxyl-terminal peptide (residues 1024–1034) of the H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit (PGSWWDQELYY) (31Asano S. Arakawa S.

Cells were washed and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in methionine-free medium. Cells were labeled for 60 min with [35S]Met, Cys-labeling mixture (EXPRESS) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and chased in a complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for indicated periods.

The proteins separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel were visualized by digital autoradiography of dried gels using Bio Imaging Analyzer BAS 2000 (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo). Membrane fractions of HEK cells stably expressing the αβ complex were incubated in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 4 °C for 30 min as described previously (32Asano S. Kimura T. Ueno S. Kawamura M. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22257-22265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The solubilized fraction was incubated with anti α-subunit antibody Ab1024 and ImmunoPure immobilized protein A at 4 °C for 12 h. After centrifugation, the pellet was washed 4 times with the lysis buffer followed by 2 washes in 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The pellet was solubilized in the sample buffer for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The β-subunit in the blot was detected by anti-β-subunit antibody 2B6 in combination with a peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody, which was preabsorbed with rabbit serum. Stable cell lines were fixed for 10 min in cold methanol (−20 °C) and washed three times with PBS containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mmMgCl2 (PBS(+)). Cells were permeabilized in a permeabilization buffer containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS(+) for 15 min at room temperature. Nonspecific antibody binding was blocked by preincubation of cells in a goat serum dilution buffer solution (16% goat serum, 0.3% Triton X-100, 0.9% NaCl, and 20 mm NaPi, pH 7.4) for 30 min. All antibody incubations were carried out using the goat serum dilution buffer solution. Cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-H+,K+-ATPase α (Ab1024) or anti-H+,K+-ATPase β (2B6) antibody followed by three washes with the permeabilization buffer. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies were used for 1 h at room temperature at a 1:100 dilution. After washing with PBS(+) three times, immunofluorescence images were visualized using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope. When indicated, cells were fixed with 3.5% formaldehyde at room temperature for 30 min instead of methanol, and the antibody incubation was carried out without permeabilization. H+,K+-ATPase activity was measured from the decrease in the amount of NADH coupled with regeneration of ATP from ADP (coupled-enzyme assay) in 1.2 ml of a reaction mixture containing 50 μg of membrane protein, 3 mm MgCl2, 800 μm ATP, 160 μm NADH, 0.8 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 3 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 2.75 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 5 mm NaN3, 1 mm ouabain, 15 mm KCl, and 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The decrease in the amount of NADH was measured at 37 °C from absorbance at 340 nm in a Beckman spectrophotometer as described elsewhere (33Morii M. Hayata Y. Mizoguchi K. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4068-4072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). H+,K+-ATPase activity, defined as the SCH 28080-sensitive K+-ATPase, was calculated as the difference between the K+-ATPase activities in the presence and absence of 50 μm SCH 28080. Protein was measured using the BCA protein assay kit from Pierce with bovine serum albumin as a standard."

https://openalex.org/W1965245380,"It has become evident that a Ca(2+)-dependent release of arachidonic acid (AA) and subsequent formation of bioactive lipid mediators such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes in red blood cells (RBCs) can modify physiological functions of neighboring RBCs and platelets. Here we identified a novel type of cytosolic PLA(2) in bovine and human RBCs and purified it to apparent homogeneity with a 14,000-fold purification. The purified enzyme, termed rPLA(2), has a molecular mass of 42 kDa and reveals biochemical properties similar to group IV cPLA(2), but shows different profiles from cPLA(2) in several column chromatographies. Moreover, rPLA(2) did not react with any of anti-cPLA(2) and anti-sPLA(2) antibodies and was identified as an unknown protein in matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometric analysis. Divalent metal ions tested exhibited similar effects between rPLA(2) and cPLA(2), whereas mercurials inhibited cPLA(2) but had no effect on rPLA(2). Antibody against the 42-kDa protein not only precipitated the rPLA(2) activity, but also reacted with the 42-kDa protein from bovine and human RBCs in immunoblot analysis. The 42-kDa protein band was selectively detected in murine fetal liver cells known as a type of progenitor cells of RBCs. It was found that EA4, a derivative of quinone newly developed as an inhibitor for rPLA(2), inhibited a Ca(2+) ionophore-induced AA release from human and bovine RBCs, indicating that this enzyme is responsible for the Ca(2+)-dependent AA release from mammalian RBCs. Finally, erythroid progenitor cell assay utilizing diaminobenzidine staining of hemoglobinized fetal liver cells showed that rPLA(2) detectable in erythroid cells was down-regulated when differentiated to non-erythroid cells. Together, our results suggest that the 42-kDa rPLA(2) identified as a novel form of Ca(2+)-dependent PLA(2) may play an important role in hemostasis, thrombosis, and/or erythropoiesis through the Ca(2+)-dependent release of AA."
https://openalex.org/W1996711960,"In meiosis I sister centromeres are unified in their polarity on the spindle, and this unique behavior is known to require the function of meiosis-specific factors that set some intrinsic property of the centromeres. The fission yeast,Schizosaccharomyces pombe, possesses complex centromeres consisting of repetitive DNA elements, making it an excellent model in which to study the behavior of complex centromeres. In mitosis, during which sister centromeres mediate chromosome segregation by establishing bipolar chromosome attachments to the spindle, the central core of the S. pombe centromere chromatin has a unique irregular nucleosome pattern. Deletion of repeats flanking this core structure have no effect on mitotic chromosome segregation, but have profound effects during meiosis. While this demonstrates that the outer repeats are critical for normal meiotic sister centromere behavior, exactly how they function and how monopolarity is established remains unclear. In this study we provide the first analysis of the chromatin structure of a complex centromere during meiosis. We show that the nature and extent of the unique central core chromatin structure is maintained with no measurable expansion. This demonstrates that monopolarity of sister centromeres, and subsequent reversion to bipolarity, does not involve a global change to the centromeric chromatin structure.

Functional centromeres are required for connection of the chromosomes to the spindle apparatus during mitotic and meiotic cell divisions (reviewed in Refs. 1Henikoff S. Ahmad K. Malik H.S.

Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 770-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). First, during or preceding meiosis I, centromeres are remodeled to a format that will ensure a reductional division by forming monopolar kinetochore attachments of sister chromatids. Subsequently, centromeres revert to a form that will enable bipolar attachment of sister centromeres during meiosis II, resulting in equational chromosome segregation. The factors responsible for establishing the polarity of centromeres during meiosis are intrinsic to the chromosomes and are not dependent upon the status of the meiotic spindle or the surrounding cellular environment (7Paliulis L.V. Nicklas R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1223-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A number of proteins have been identified that are required for the establishment of monopolar sister centromere spindle associations in meiosis I. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where “point-centromeres” are defined by a single nucleosome, the MAM1 gene product is essential for monopolarity, although no MAM1 homologues have been identified in any other organism (8Toth A. Rabitsch K.P. Galova M. Schleiffer A. Buonomo S.B. Nasmyth K. Cell. 2000; 103: 1155-1168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, possesses more complex centromere structures covering up to 110 kbp of repetitive DNA (9Fishel B. Amstutz H. Baum M. Carbon J. Clarke L. Mol. Cell.

Baker S. et al.Nature. 2002; 415: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). Remodeling of S. pombe centromeres into a meiosis I configuration is dependent upon the Rec8 meiosis-specific cohesin (14Watanabe Y. Nurse P. Nature. 1999; 400: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) and the Bub1 kinetochore-associated spindle checkpoint protein (15Bernard P. Maure J.-F. Javerzat J.-P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In wild type cells the Rec8 cohesin is located at the centromeres prior to both meiosis I and II, indicating that the presence of Rec8 at the centromeres alone is not sufficient to establish monopolar kinetochores (14Watanabe Y. Nurse P. Nature. 1999; 400: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The repetitive regions of S. pombe centromeres have been classified into three distinct sequence elements, the outer repeat elements (otr; also termed K repeats), the inner most repeats (imr), and the central regions (CC/cnt) (Fig. 1) (10Polizzi C. Clarke L. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 11Clarke L. Baum M. Marschall L.G. Ngan V.K. Steiner N.C. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant.

Cell. 1992; 3: 819-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The otr regions consist of three different repeat units, termed the dg, dh, and cen253 repeats, that are present to varying degrees in the otr regions of each of the three S. pombe centromeres (Fig. 1) (13Wood V. Gwilliam R. Rajandream M.-A. Lyne M. Lyne R. Stewart A. Sgouros J. Peat N. Hayles J. Baker S. et al.Nature. 2002; 415: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). The imr regions are imperfect inverted repeat elements that flank the cnt regions and the cnt regions share significant homology with each other (48% over 1.4 kbp), suggesting they are functionally similar (13Wood V. Gwilliam R. Rajandream M.-A. Lyne M. Lyne R. Stewart A. Sgouros J. Peat N. Hayles J. Baker S. et al.Nature. 2002; 415: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). Despite the classification of the centromeric DNA sequence into three distinct domains, S. pombe cen1 appears to consist of only two functional domains during mitosis, a central region made up of the imr and the cnt and an outer region principally consisting of the otr region and cnt-distal sections of the imr. These two domains associate with a different group of proteins that localize to discrete positions within the nucleoplasm during interphase (16Partridge J.F. Borgstrom B. Allshire R.C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 783-791PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kniola B. O'Toole E. McIntosh J.R. Mellone B. Allshire R. Mengarelli S. Hultenby K. Ekwall K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2767-2775Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These disparate sets of proteins are required for centromere function, and it is proposed that there is a “flexible” boundary between the two regions, possibly defined by tRNA genes within the imr (16Partridge J.F. Borgstrom B. Allshire R.C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 783-791PubMed Google Scholar, 18Donze D. Kamakaka R.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 520-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Studies of the chromatin structure of the centromeres of S. pombe have revealed that during the mitotic cell cycle the chromatin structure of the cnt and imr regions does not posses the regular nucleosome pattern observed throughout the rest of the genome (11Clarke L. Baum M. Marschall L.G. Ngan V.K. Steiner N.C. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 12Takahashi K. Murakami S. Chikashige Y. Funabiki H. Niwa O. Yanagida M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 819-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In contrast to this, the otr regions do maintain the regular nucleosome pattern observed for bulk chromatin, throughout the mitotic cell cycle (11Clarke L. Baum M. Marschall L.G. Ngan V.K. Steiner N.C. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 12Takahashi K. Murakami S. Chikashige Y. Funabiki H. Niwa O. Yanagida M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 819-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Recent work on mammalian chromosomes indicates that there is also a unique chromatin organization in centromere satellite regions (19Gilbert N. Allan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11949-11954Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), indicating that a specific higher order chromatin structure is most likely a unique feature of all centromeres (20Choo K.H.A. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 165-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In S. pombe an enhancer element, located in the otr regions (K repeat region), is essential for maintaining the “irregular” chromatin structure in the centromere core region (21Marschall L.G. Clarke L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 22Ngan V.K. Clarke L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3305-3314Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A model has been proposed suggesting the enhancer element is required to fold the centromeric DNA into a loop that is pivotal for the formation and/or maintenance of the central core chromatin structure (21Marschall L.G. Clarke L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It is likely that the S. pombeCENP-A protein (Cnp1) is central to the formation of the unique chromatin in the centromeric region as it is associated with the imr and cnt, but not the otr, regions; consistent with this, cnp1− cells do not form the unusual central core chromatin structure (23Takahashi K. Chen E.S. Yanagida M. Science. 2000; 288: 2215-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). This suggests that the replacement of histone H3 in the centromeric regions by CENP-A may mediate the formation of a more fluid chromatin structure required for correct mitotic kinetochore formation. Two other S. pombe proteins, Mis6 and Mis12, are also required for the formation of the “unusual” centromere chromatin structure and both are needed for correct sister chromatid segregation (24Saitoh S. Takahashi K. Yanagida M. Cell. 1997; 90: 131-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 25Goshima G. Saitoh S. Yanagida M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1664-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Localization of Cnp1 to the central regions is dependent upon Mis6 function but not Mis12, indicating that Mis6-dependent establishment of Cnp1 alone is not enough to create a functional centromere unit exhibiting the irregular chromatin profile (23Takahashi K. Chen E.S. Yanagida M. Science. 2000; 288: 2215-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). One intriguing feature of S. pombe centromeres is that certain regions of the repetitive elements flanking the cnt inner core can be deleted with no effect on the fidelity of mitotic chromosome segregation; however, the removal of these flanking repeats results in a reduction in the fidelity of segregation during meiosis I division with a high incidence of precocious sister chromatid separation (26Clarke L. Baum M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1863-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 27Hahnenberger K.M. Carbon J. Clarke L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2206-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This suggests that the chromosomal elements of S. pombe centromeres function differentially during the mitotic and meiotic cell cycles. In this report we show that the functional reconfiguration of centromeres during the meiotic cell cycle does not involve a global change to the nature and extent of the specialized structure of the centromeric chromatin, and we discuss the implications of this in proposing the way in which centromere reconfiguration is mediated. Meiotic inductions were carried out using GP338 (BP184); pat1–114/pat1–114 ade6-M210/ade6M-216 ura4–294/ura4+ leu1–32/leu1+arg1–2/arg1+ end1–458/end1–458 h−/h− (28Cervantes M.D. Farah J.A. Smith G.R.

Plasmids were used to produce the Southern hybridization probes.otr (dg)-specific probe was an 800-bp Hin dIII-EcoRI fragment from pKT108 (12Takahashi K. Murakami S. Chikashige Y. Funabiki H. Niwa O.

Redhead N.J. Cranson G. Cell. 1994; 76: 157-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The imr1B probe was a 1.6-kbp BamHI-EcoRI fragment from pJS3. pJS3 was constructed by cloning a 1.6-kbp PCR product from the imr1B region using genomic DNA as a template; the following primer sequences were used: forward, 5′-GTCGAATTGAGATGTAAACG-3′; reverse, 5′-CTGCTGAGGCTAAGTATCTG-3′. This fragment was cloned directly into pCR2.1-TOPO using the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) to create pJS3. G1 arrest and synchronous meiotic induction of the pat1–114 homozygous strain was carried out as described by Cervantes and co-workers (28Cervantes M.D. Farah J.A. Smith G.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 883-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Homozygous mes1Δ cells were blocked prior to meiosis II as described by Kishida and co-workers (31Kishida M. Nagai T. Nakaseko Y. Shimoda C. Curr. Genet. 1994; 25: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To standardize the amount of chromatin DNA isolated, a fixed number of fresh cells were used for each preparation (1 × 107; 0.5 g of wet weight). Cells were harvested and resuspended in 2 ml of preincubation solution (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.07 m2-mercaptoethanol, 3 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)) and incubated at 30 °C for 15 min with gentle shaking. Cells were reharvested and resuspended in 2 ml of freshly prepared lyticase buffer (37.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 0.75 m sorbitol, 1.25% glucose, 6 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)) and lyticase (2 mg/ml). The time of incubation of cells to produce spheroplasts varied from sample to sample and was strain and meiotic time point-dependent. All subsequent steps were carried out on ice. Spheroplasts were washed once in 1 m sorbitol and resuspended in 2 ml of lysis buffer (18% Ficoll-400, 10 mmKH2PO4, 10 mmKH2PO4 at pH 6.8, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.25 mm EGTA, 0.25 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride).

Preparations were incubated at 32 °C and stopped at varying time points following addition of MNase. MNase reactions were terminated by adding 1% SDS and 10 mm EDTA (pH 8.0). DNA was purified as described by Mizuno and co-workers (32Mizuno K. Emura Y. Baur M. Kohli J. Ohta K. Shibata T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 876-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). DNA was analyzed on a 1.2% agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N,Amersham Biosciences) and subjected to Southern hybridization with specific probes using Amersham Biosciences hybridization buffers as described by the manufacturer. Radiographs were obtained using a Bio-Rad Personal Imager, and nucleosome banding was distinguished using Bio-Rad Quantity One software. The previously proposed structures of the S. pombe centromeres suggests that the DNA sequence of the imr regions is unique to each centromere (see Fig. 1 for updated centromere maps; Ref. 12Takahashi K. Murakami S. Chikashige Y. Funabiki H. Niwa O. Yanagida M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 819-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). To confirm and update this, prior to designing probes for chromatin analysis (see below), the imr1 sequences were subclassified into two sections, one distal to the central region (imr1A) and one proximal to the central region (imr1B) (Fig. 1). Sequences from both regions were used in blast searches against the S. pombe genome sequence, which contains sequence information for over 81% of the centromeric DNA for all three chromosomes (www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/S_pombe/blast_server.shtml; 13). The imr1A sequence used for the search was the full 1550-bp sequence between the reported otr dg boundary and the alanine tRNA gene located within the center of the imr (as reported by Takahashi et al. (12Takahashi K. Murakami S. Chikashige Y. Funabiki H. Niwa O. Yanagida M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 819-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar)). The data base search using imr1A revealed a number of regions of identical sequence within cen2 and cen3, clearly demonstrating the imr1A region contains sequences that are not unique to cen1. The extent of the identity ranged from regions covering 208 bp to 1083 bp (identity ranged from 95 to 99%). These regions represent significant sequence duplications of imr1 DNA within the centromeres of the other two chromosomes. Importantly, the imr1A sequences in cen2 and cen3 are located on the cnt distal side of the otr-imr boundaries of imr2 and imr3. The majority of the duplications are relatively small (up to 400 bp) and are repeats of the 400-bp region immediately adjacent to the otr1L-dgI region. These short duplications appear to be within stretches of dh DNA on the other centromeres as illustrated in Fig. 1B. We therefore suggest that the cnt-distal portion of imr1 is made up of a region of dh DNA. Interestingly, this would mean that imr regions on all three centromeres are directly flanked by dh sequences. One larger stretch of imr1A sequence is located at the most cnt-distal point of otr2L. This sequence structure suggests that this region (see Fig. 1B) could be an inverted duplication of the dgI-imr1A boundary of cen1. A second imr1A duplication of 962 bp is located in a region distal to the dgIII-dhIII repeats on the right-hand arm of cen3; the significance of these duplications is unclear, although there may be advantages to having imr1A elements at some of the distal flanks of centromere arms. The duplication of imr1A sequences in otr regions of the other centromeres prevented these sequences being used for hybridization-based analysis of imr1A chromatin structure (see below). Moreover, the identification of these duplications in otr regions in cen2 and cen3 supports the model that proposes the imr1A region of cen1 is functionally distinct from the imr1B, cnt1 proximal region (16Partridge J.F.

From this analysis of the centromere sequence, probes were designed that would be specific to the otr (highly conserved dg region), imr1B, and cnt regions (Fig. 1). These probes were used in all the chromatin analyses described below. Previous analyses of centromeric chromatin structure in S. pombe have employed haploid cells. To elucidate the nature of the centromeric chromatin structure during meiosis, diploid cells were induced to traverse meiosis in a highly synchronous fashion (see below). Chromatin analysis of asynchronous (data not shown; Fig. 6) and G1 (Fig. 2) arrested diploid cells show that the imr1B and cnt1 chromatin exhibits a smearing pattern in response to MNase treatment. In contrast, the otr regions have the more uniform nucleosome pattern of bulk chromatin. These data are similar to those obtained for haploid cells, indicating that the structure of centromeric chromatin is similar in both haploids and diploids.Figure 2Chromatin structure for the otr, imr, and cnt regions of a G1-arrested diploid cell prior to meiotic induction. EtBr image shows the nucleosome pattern for bulk chromatin. The three right-hand images are radiographs of Southern filters probed with region specific probes. Mono- to tetranucleosome bands are indicated on the left. The patterns for the otr regions mimic the pattern for bulk chromatin with distinct nucleosome bands. The imr and cnt regions show a more smeared pattern with no clearly quantitatively distinguishable bands (using Quantity One analysis; see “Experimental Procedures”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Loss of otr sequences (K′ and L sequences, using the nomencalture of Clarke and co-workers (26Clarke L.

This leaves open the question of how centromeres are reconfigured and whether or not this involves a sustained global change to the structural organization of the centromeric chromatin. To address this, a diploid strain homozygous for the pat1–114 mutation and homozygous at the mat locus (h−/h−) was employed to induce a synchronous meiosis from which chromatin extracts were made at specific time points. Pat1 is a kinase that regulates entry into meiosis by inactivating factors required for meiotic entry (reviewed in Ref. 33Yamamoto M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 18-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). pat1–114 cells can be induced to enter a synchronous meiosis by shifting cells grown at the permissive temperature of 25 °C to the restrictive temperature of 34 °C, thereby inactivating the mutant Pat1 kinase. Homozygous pat1–114 diploid cells arrested in G1 prior to thermal induction traverse a highly synchronous meiosis indistinguishable from a normal azygotic meiosis (34Watanabe Y. Yokobayashi S. Yamamoto M. Nurse P. Nature. 2001; 409: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A number of synchronous azygotic meioses were induced and temporally monitored by measuring key meiotic events, including meiotic commitment (by return to mitotic permissive temperature), premeiotic S phase (FACS), and meiosis I and meiosis II divisions (microscopy). Meiotic inductions exhibited a high degree of reproducibility and temporal profiles were uniform in nature. A maximum of two chromatin preparations were made from each meiotic induction. Chromatin preparations were made prior to premeiotic S phase, following DNA replication but prior to meiosis I division, post-meiosis I (pre-meiosis II) and post-meiosis II (pre spore formation). Fig. 3 shows the points at which chromatin preparations were made relative to major temporal landmarks. Each chromatin preparation was subjected to MNase digestion and Southern blot analysis using either otr, imr1B, or cnt1 hybridization probes (Fig. 1). In all cases the imr1B and cnt regions exhibited a nonspecific sensitivity to MNase, whereas the otr regions have a regular nucleosome pattern analogous to bulk chromatin; examples of this for three different chromatin preparations are shown in Fig. 4. The presence of the MNase labile chromatin in the central core region is similar to that found during the mitotic cell cycle. Moreover, the extent of the unique chromatin is restricted to the central core and does not extend globally to the otr regions.Figure 4Centromere chromatin patterns from meiosis. Examples of chromatin patterns are shown for all three centromeric regions as well as the pattern for bulk chromatin (EtBr). The three examples represent different meiotic time points, meiotic S-phase, post-meiotic S-phase (pre-meiosis I), and post-meiosis I (pre-meiosis II). Encircled numbers on the right adjacent to each set correspond to the point in meiosis when samples were taken as indicated in Fig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although there is limited homology between the cnt regions (13Wood V. Gwilliam R. Rajandream M.-A. Lyne M. Lyne R. Stewart A. Sgouros J. Peat N. Hayles J. Baker S. et al.Nature. 2002; 415: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar), the cnt2 sequence has been reported as unique (12Takahashi K. Murakami S. Chikashige Y. Funabiki H. Niwa O. Yanagida M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 819-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). To ensure that the three chromosomes behave in a similar fashion a cnt2-specific hybridization probe was used on a range of chromatin preparations taken from the meiotic time points indicated in Fig. 3. In all cases the cnt2-specific probe showed a smeared chromatin pattern indicating that the central core of cen2 behaves in a similar fashion to cnt1 throughout meiosis (Fig. 5). To gain further temporal resolution between meiosis I and meiosis II divisions and to dismiss any effects of the pat1–114 mutation, a homozygous mes1Δ diploid was constructed.mes1Δ cells fail to complete meiosis and arrest as binucleate cells following meiosis I when Rec8, a modulator of monopolarity, remains localized at the centromere (14Watanabe Y. Nurse P. Nature. 1999; 400: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The mes1Δ/mes1Δ diploid was heterozygous at the mating type locus and homozygous pat1+. Diploid cells heterozygous at the mat locus will enter meiosis when nitrogen becomes limiting in the media. Despite the lack of synchrony of meiotic initiation in pat1+ diploids, all cells arrest at the same point between meiosis I and meiosis II. Fig. 6 shows the cnt1 and imr1B regions are extremely sensitive to MNase, whereas the MNase sensitivity of the otr regions mirrors that of the bulk chromatin; these data are consistent with those from the thermally induced meiosis in the homozygous pat1–114 diploids. Both the otr and bulk chromatin exhibit a low background degradation in mes1Δ blocked cells. Moreover, the otr region in the mitotic mes1Δ diploid appears to be slightly more refractory to MNase digestion than bulk chromatin (compare otr and EtBr images in upper panel of Fig. 6). This was not apparent in mes1+ diploids (Fig. 1) and may reflect some subtle change in centromere chromatin in proliferating mitotic diploid cells. Attempts to employ mutants (for example, mei4Δ) to block the meiotic cell cycle prior to meiosis I division resulted in high background degradation of chromosomes, presumably due to the presence of structures that render the chromosomes more labile during arrest such as recombination intermediates. Successful traversal of meiosis involves a number of major changes in the behavior of chromosomes. Pivotal to these events are the changes in the relationship between sister centromeres, switching in early meiosis from mitotic bipolar spindle associations to monopolar associations which maintain cohesion at the centromeres; this is followed by a final reversion back to bipolar spindle associations and loss of centromeric cohesion during meiosis II. Paliulis and Nicklas (7Paliulis L.V. Nicklas R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1223-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) have recently shown that grasshopper chromosomes from meiosis I cells maintain monoplolarity when they are transferred to spindles in meiosis II cells; the reciprocal is also true, with meiosis II chromosomes having bipolar spindle associations when placed onto the meiosis I spindle. This clearly demonstrates that it is factors directly associated with the chromosomes that determine sister centromere polarity and that once polarity is established it cannot be changed by altering the cellular or spindle environment. A number of proteins are known to be required for the development of sister centromere monopolarity during meiosis I, including the fission yeast spindle checkpoint protein Bub1 and the meiosis-specific cohesin, Rec8 (14Watanabe Y. Nurse P. Nature. 1999; 400: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 15Bernard P. Maure J.-F. Javerzat J.-P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It remains unknown how these factors mediate their effect on the centromere. A number of studies have shown that during mitosis the chromatin within the central core of centromeres is unlike the bulk of chromatin found throughout the genome (11Clarke L. Baum M. Marschall L.G. Ngan V.K. Steiner N.C. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 12Takahashi K. Murakami S. Chikashige Y. Funabiki H. Niwa O. Yanagida M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 819-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 19Gilbert N. Allan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11949-11954Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is known that there are a whole range of proteins that associate with centromeric DNA to form the chromatin structure required for mitotic bipolar spindle associations. How the proteins interact with the DNA to produce the specialized chromatin structure that confers a functional centromere remains conjecture, as does the way in which the centromere structure changes to provide a unique cell division cycle during meiosis. We took advantage of the fact that the centromeres of the fission yeast are relatively large and complex in nature (13Wood V. Gwilliam R. Rajandream M.-A. Lyne M. Lyne R. Stewart A. Sgouros J. Peat N. Hayles J. Baker S. et al.Nature. 2002; 415: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar), offering a unique model in which to study the behavior of complex centromeres during the transition from mitosis to meiosis and through the proceeding meiotic cell cycle. Work by Clarke and co-workers (26Clarke L. Baum M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1863-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 27Hahnenberger K.M. Carbon J. Clarke L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2206-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) identified significant differences in the structural requirements of fission yeast centromeres during mitosis and meiosis. Their work showed that deletion of cnt1 distal sections of one arm of the flanking otr region of cen1 (K′ and L as reported by Clarke and co-workers (26Clarke L. Baum M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1863-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 27Hahnenberger K.M. Carbon J. Clarke L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2206-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)) resulted in no increased missegregation during mitosis, but did result in a significant increase in precocious sister centromere disjunction in meiosis I. This observation suggests that the large more complex centromeres of S. pombe are essential to ensure a proper sister polarity reconfiguration and cohesion maintenance during meiosis I. In this report we establish that the boundaries of the centromere central core regions that possess the unique chromatin structure during mitosis are not globally extended into the otr regions during the meiotic cell cycle. Although the chromatin assay employed in this study may have missed very transient changes to the extent of this unusual structure, this seems unlikely as the unusual chromatin is likely to be dependent upon the establishment of the histone H3 homologue, Cnp1 (CENP-A homologue), within the central core in meiosis as it is in mitosis, although this has not been directly tested (23Takahashi K. Chen E.S. Yanagida M. Science. 2000; 288: 2215-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Once Cnp1 establishes the unique chromatin structure that confers functionality to the centromere, it is unlikely that this becomes de-established and re-established in a very short temporal frame. This study is the first investigation into the global behavior of a complex eukaryotic centromere during meiosis. We show that there is no major change in the nature and extent of the unique chromatin structure at the central core of S. pombe centromeres during meiosis. During mitosis the unique structure is dependent upon the establishment of the H3 analogue Cnp1 (CENP-A). This work suggests that the mitotic boundaries of Cnp1 establishment are maintained during meiosis, although this has not been directly tested. It has been proposed that the chromatin boundaries in cen1 are set by the tRNA genes located centrally within imr1 (Fig. 1; Ref. 16Partridge J.F. Borgstrom B. Allshire R.C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 783-791PubMed Google Scholar), a proposal supported by the observation that tRNA genes can function as distinct chromatin boundary elements (18Donze D. Kamakaka R.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 520-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that the limits of the unusual chromatin are maintained throughout meiosis, implying that the imr1 tRNA genes maintain function as chromatin boundary elements during meiosis. The factors that mediate the maintenance of sister centromere cohesion during meiosis I reductional division do not exert their effect through a global change to the limits of the unique chromatin structure. Thus, the specific requirement for the cnt-distal otr elements for maintaining sister cohesion during meiosis I is not for mediating the expansion of the unique central core. It seems likely that these regions provide a platform for other factors to function. Rec8 provides an attractive candidate, and although Rec8 is enriched at the centromeres, it associates with all centromeric regions during meiosis and not specifically the otr regions (34Watanabe Y. Yokobayashi S. Yamamoto M. Nurse P. Nature. 2001; 409: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Exactly how meiotic reconfiguration of centromeres is mediated remains an open question. However, it is clear from this study that there is not a global change to the chromatin structure at the nucleosome level within the centromeres. We are grateful to R. Allshire, C. Shimoda, G. Smith, and M. Yanagida for providing strains and plasmids. We thank R. Gwilliam, Y. Shaw, and V. Wood for providing unpublished information on the centromere sequences. We also thank A. Battersby, M.

https://openalex.org/W2043001467,"Proteins encoded by the adenovirus E1A gene regulate both cellular and viral genes to mediate effects on cell cycle, differentiation, and cell growth control. We have identified the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter as a target of E1A action and investigated the role nucleoprotein structure plays in its response to E1A. Both 12 and 13 S forms target the MMTV promoter when it has a disorganized and accessible chromatin configuration. However, whereas the 13 S form is stimulatory, the 12 S form is repressive. When the MMTV promoter adopts an organized and repressed chromatin structure, it is targeted only by the 13 S form, which stimulates it. Although evidence indicates that E1A interacts with the SWI/SNF remodeling complex, E1A had no effect on chromatin remodeling at the MMTV promoter in organized chromatin. Analysis of E1A mutants showed that stimulation of the MMTV promoter is mediated solely through conserved region 3 and does not require interaction with Rb, p300/CBP-associated factor, or CBP/p300. Imaging analysis showed that E1A colocalizes with MMTV sequences in vivo, suggesting that it functions directly at the promoter. These results indicate that E1A stimulates the MMTV promoter in a fashion independent of chromatin conformation and through a direct mechanism involving interaction with the basal transcription machinery."
