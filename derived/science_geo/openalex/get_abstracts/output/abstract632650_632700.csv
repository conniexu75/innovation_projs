https://openalex.org/W2944727022,"Large panels of comprehensively characterized human cancer models, including the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), have provided a rigorous framework with which to study genetic variants, candidate targets, and small-molecule and biological therapeutics and to identify new marker-driven cancer dependencies. To improve our understanding of the molecular features that contribute to cancer phenotypes, including drug responses, here we have expanded the characterizations of cancer cell lines to include genetic, RNA splicing, DNA methylation, histone H3 modification, microRNA expression and reverse-phase protein array data for 1,072 cell lines from individuals of various lineages and ethnicities. Integration of these data with functional characterizations such as drug-sensitivity, short hairpin RNA knockdown and CRISPR–Cas9 knockout data reveals potential targets for cancer drugs and associated biomarkers. Together, this dataset and an accompanying public data portal provide a resource for the acceleration of cancer research using model cancer cell lines. The original Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) is expanded with deeper characterization of over 1,000 cell lines, including genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, and integration with drug-sensitivity and gene-dependency data."

Infrastructure development threatens the ecosystem processes, biodiversity and services that these rivers support. Here we assess the connectivity status of 12 million kilometres of rivers globally and identify those that remain free-flowing in their entire length. Only 37 per cent of rivers longer than 1,000 kilometres remain free-flowing over their entire length and 23 per cent flow uninterrupted to the ocean. Very long FFRs are largely restricted to remote regions of the Arctic and of the Amazon and Congo basins. In densely populated areas only few very long rivers remain free-flowing, such as the Irrawaddy and Salween. Dams and reservoirs and their up- and downstream propagation of fragmentation and flow regulation are the leading contributors to the loss of river connectivity. By applying a new method to quantify riverine connectivity and map FFRs, we provide a foundation for concerted global and national strategies to maintain or restore them. A comprehensive assessment of the world’s rivers and their connectivity shows that only 37 per cent of rivers longer than 1,000 kilometres remain free-flowing over their entire length."
https://openalex.org/W2944119451,"Software implementations of brain-inspired computing underlie many important computational tasks, from image processing to speech recognition, artificial intelligence and deep learning applications. Yet, unlike real neural tissue, traditional computing architectures physically separate the core computing functions of memory and processing, making fast, efficient and low-energy computing difficult to achieve. To overcome such limitations, an attractive alternative is to design hardware that mimics neurons and synapses. Such hardware, when connected in networks or neuromorphic systems, processes information in a way more analogous to brains. Here we present an all-optical version of such a neurosynaptic system, capable of supervised and unsupervised learning. We exploit wavelength division multiplexing techniques to implement a scalable circuit architecture for photonic neural networks, successfully demonstrating pattern recognition directly in the optical domain. Such photonic neurosynaptic networks promise access to the high speed and high bandwidth inherent to optical systems, thus enabling the direct processing of optical telecommunication and visual data."

https://openalex.org/W2945386046,"Body-mass index (BMI) has increased steadily in most countries in parallel with a rise in the proportion of the population who live in cities1,2. This has led to a widely reported view that urbanization is one of the most important drivers of the global rise in obesity3,4,5,6. Here we use 2,009 population-based studies, with measurements of height and weight in more than 112 million adults, to report national, regional and global trends in mean BMI segregated by place of residence (a rural or urban area) from 1985 to 2017. We show that, contrary to the dominant paradigm, more than 55% of the global rise in mean BMI from 1985 to 2017—and more than 80% in some low- and middle-income regions—was due to increases in BMI in rural areas. This large contribution stems from the fact that, with the exception of women in sub-Saharan Africa, BMI is increasing at the same rate or faster in rural areas than in cities in low- and middle-income regions. These trends have in turn resulted in a closing—and in some countries reversal—of the gap in BMI between urban and rural areas in low- and middle-income countries, especially for women. In high-income and industrialized countries, we noted a persistently higher rural BMI, especially for women. There is an urgent need for an integrated approach to rural nutrition that enhances financial and physical access to healthy foods, to avoid replacing the rural undernutrition disadvantage in poor countries with a more general malnutrition disadvantage that entails excessive consumption of low-quality calories."
https://openalex.org/W2944658035,"In vitro differentiation of human stem cells can produce pancreatic β-cells; the loss of this insulin-secreting cell type underlies type 1 diabetes. Here, as a step towards understanding this differentiation process, we report the transcriptional profiling of more than 100,000 human cells undergoing in vitro β-cell differentiation, and describe the cells that emerged. We resolve populations that correspond to β-cells, α-like poly-hormonal cells, non-endocrine cells that resemble pancreatic exocrine cells and a previously unreported population that resembles enterochromaffin cells. We show that endocrine cells maintain their identity in culture in the absence of exogenous growth factors, and that changes in gene expression associated with in vivo β-cell maturation are recapitulated in vitro. We implement a scalable re-aggregation technique to deplete non-endocrine cells and identify CD49a (also known as ITGA1) as a surface marker of the β-cell population, which allows magnetic sorting to a purity of 80%. Finally, we use a high-resolution sequencing time course to characterize gene-expression dynamics during the induction of human pancreatic endocrine cells, from which we develop a lineage model of in vitro β-cell differentiation. This study provides a perspective on human stem-cell differentiation, and will guide future endeavours that focus on the differentiation of pancreatic islet cells, and their applications in regenerative medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2943870140,"Prompt coronary catheterization and revascularization have markedly improved the outcomes of myocardial infarction, but have also resulted in a growing number of surviving patients with permanent structural damage of the heart, which frequently leads to heart failure. There is an unmet clinical need for treatments for this condition1, particularly given the inability of cardiomyocytes to replicate and thereby regenerate the lost contractile tissue2. Here we show that expression of human microRNA-199a in infarcted pig hearts can stimulate cardiac repair. One month after myocardial infarction and delivery of this microRNA through an adeno-associated viral vector, treated animals showed marked improvements in both global and regional contractility, increased muscle mass and reduced scar size. These functional and morphological findings correlated with cardiomyocyte de-differentiation and proliferation. However, subsequent persistent and uncontrolled expression of the microRNA resulted in sudden arrhythmic death of most of the treated pigs. Such events were concurrent with myocardial infiltration of proliferating cells displaying a poorly differentiated myoblastic phenotype. These results show that achieving cardiac repair through the stimulation of endogenous cardiomyocyte proliferation is attainable in large mammals, however dosage of this therapy needs to be tightly controlled."
https://openalex.org/W2944723276,"Despite considerable efforts to identify cancer metabolic alterations that might unveil druggable vulnerabilities, systematic characterizations of metabolism as it relates to functional genomic features and associated dependencies remain uncommon. To further understand the metabolic diversity of cancer, we profiled 225 metabolites in 928 cell lines from more than 20 cancer types in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS). This resource enables unbiased association analysis linking the cancer metabolome to genetic alterations, epigenetic features and gene dependencies. Additionally, by screening barcoded cell lines, we demonstrated that aberrant ASNS hypermethylation sensitizes subsets of gastric and hepatic cancers to asparaginase therapy. Finally, our analysis revealed distinct synthesis and secretion patterns of kynurenine, an immune-suppressive metabolite, in model cancer cell lines. Together, these findings and related methodology provide comprehensive resources that will help clarify the landscape of cancer metabolism. Systematic metabolite profiling across cancer cell lines uncovers patterns associated with genetic and epigenetic features and reveals dysregulated metabolic states that can be exploited for anticancer therapy"
https://openalex.org/W2944477354,"Precision health relies on the ability to assess disease risk at an individual level, detect early preclinical conditions and initiate preventive strategies. Recent technological advances in omics and wearable monitoring enable deep molecular and physiological profiling and may provide important tools for precision health. We explored the ability of deep longitudinal profiling to make health-related discoveries, identify clinically relevant molecular pathways and affect behavior in a prospective longitudinal cohort (n = 109) enriched for risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The cohort underwent integrative personalized omics profiling from samples collected quarterly for up to 8 years (median, 2.8 years) using clinical measures and emerging technologies including genome, immunome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, microbiome and wearable monitoring. We discovered more than 67 clinically actionable health discoveries and identified multiple molecular pathways associated with metabolic, cardiovascular and oncologic pathophysiology. We developed prediction models for insulin resistance by using omics measurements, illustrating their potential to replace burdensome tests. Finally, study participation led the majority of participants to implement diet and exercise changes. Altogether, we conclude that deep longitudinal profiling can lead to actionable health discoveries and provide relevant information for precision health."
https://openalex.org/W2944277922,"Since Bridgman’s discovery of five solid water (H2O) ice phases1 in 1912, studies on the extraordinary polymorphism of H2O have documented more than seventeen crystalline and several amorphous ice structures2,3, as well as rich metastability and kinetic effects4,5. This unique behaviour is due in part to the geometrical frustration of the weak intermolecular hydrogen bonds and the sizeable quantum motion of the light hydrogen ions (protons). Particularly intriguing is the prediction that H2O becomes superionic6–12—with liquid-like protons diffusing through the solid lattice of oxygen—when subjected to extreme pressures exceeding 100 gigapascals and high temperatures above 2,000 kelvin. Numerical simulations suggest that the characteristic diffusion of the protons through the empty sites of the oxygen solid lattice (1) gives rise to a surprisingly high ionic conductivity above 100 Siemens per centimetre, that is, almost as high as typical metallic (electronic) conductivity, (2) greatly increases the ice melting temperature7–13 to several thousand kelvin, and (3) favours new ice structures with a close-packed oxygen lattice13–15. Because confining such hot and dense H2O in the laboratory is extremely challenging, experimental data are scarce. Recent optical measurements along the Hugoniot curve (locus of shock states) of water ice VII showed evidence of superionic conduction and thermodynamic signatures for melting16, but did not confirm the microscopic structure of superionic ice. Here we use laser-driven shockwaves to simultaneously compress and heat liquid water samples to 100–400 gigapascals and 2,000–3,000 kelvin. In situ X-ray diffraction measurements show that under these conditions, water solidifies within a few nanoseconds into nanometre-sized ice grains that exhibit unambiguous evidence for the crystalline oxygen lattice of superionic water ice. The X-ray diffraction data also allow us to document the compressibility of ice at these extreme conditions and a temperature- and pressure-induced phase transformation from a body-centred-cubic ice phase (probably ice X) to a novel face-centred-cubic, superionic ice phase, which we name ice XVIII2,17. The atomic structure of H2O is documented at several million atmospheres of pressure and temperatures of several thousand degrees, revealing shockwave-induced ultrafast crystallization and a novel water ice phase, ice XVIII, with exotic superionic properties."
https://openalex.org/W2876380218,"Symmetry, dimensionality, and interaction are crucial ingredients for phase transitions and quantum states of matter. As a prominent example, the integer quantum Hall effect (QHE) represents a topological phase generally regarded as characteristic for two-dimensional (2D) electronic systems, and its many aspects can be understood without invoking electron-electron interaction. The intriguing possibility of generalizing QHE to three-dimensional (3D) systems was proposed decades ago, yet it remains elusive experimentally. Here, we report clear experimental evidence for the 3D QHE observed in bulk ZrTe5 crystals. Owing to the extremely high sample quality, the extreme quantum limit with only the lowest Landau level occupied can be achieved by an applied magnetic field as low as 1.5 T. Remarkably, in this regime, we observe a dissipationless longitudinal resistivity rho_xx=0 accompanied with a well-developed Hall resistivity plateau rho_xy=(1\pm0.1) h/e^2 (\lambda_(F,z)/2), where \lambda_(F,z) is the Fermi wavelength along the field direction (z axis). This striking result strongly suggests a Fermi surface instability driven by the enhanced interaction effects in the extreme quantum limit. In addition, with further increasing magnetic field, both rho_xx and rho_xy increase dramatically and display an interesting metal-insulator transition, representing another magnetic field driven quantum phase transition. Our findings not only unambiguously reveal a novel quantum state of matter resulting from an intricate interplay among dimensionality, interaction, and symmetry breaking, but also provide a promising platform for further exploration of more exotic quantum phases and transitions in 3D systems."

https://openalex.org/W2944456503,"Symmetrical protein cages have evolved to fulfil diverse roles in nature, including compartmentalization and cargo delivery1, and have inspired synthetic biologists to create novel protein assemblies via the precise manipulation of protein-protein interfaces. Despite the impressive array of protein cages produced in the laboratory, the design of inducible assemblies remains challenging2,3. Here we demonstrate an ultra-stable artificial protein cage, the assembly and disassembly of which can be controlled by metal coordination at the protein-protein interfaces. The addition of a gold (I)-triphenylphosphine compound to a cysteine-substituted, 11-mer protein ring triggers supramolecular self-assembly, which generates monodisperse cage structures with masses greater than 2 MDa. The geometry of these structures is based on the Archimedean snub cube and is, to our knowledge, unprecedented. Cryo-electron microscopy confirms that the assemblies are held together by 120 S-Aui-S staples between the protein oligomers, and exist in two chiral forms. The cage shows extreme chemical and thermal stability, yet it readily disassembles upon exposure to reducing agents. As well as gold, mercury(II) is also found to enable formation of the protein cage. This work establishes an approach for linking protein components into robust, higher-order structures, and expands the design space available for supramolecular assemblies to include previously unexplored geometries."
https://openalex.org/W2944536114,"Neuronal-activity-dependent transcription couples sensory experience to adaptive responses of the brain including learning and memory. Mechanisms of activity-dependent gene expression including alterations of the epigenome have been characterized1–8. However, the fundamental question of whether sensory experience remodels chromatin architecture in the adult brain in vivo to induce neural code transformations and learning and memory remains to be addressed. Here we use in vivo calcium imaging, optogenetics and pharmacological approaches to show that granule neuron activation in the anterior dorsal cerebellar vermis has a crucial role in a delay tactile startle learning paradigm in mice. Of note, using large-scale transcriptome and chromatin profiling, we show that activation of the motor-learning-linked granule neuron circuit reorganizes neuronal chromatin including through long-distance enhancer–promoter and transcriptionally active compartment interactions to orchestrate distinct granule neuron gene expression modules. Conditional CRISPR knockout of the chromatin architecture regulator cohesin in anterior dorsal cerebellar vermis granule neurons in adult mice disrupts enhancer–promoter interactions, activity-dependent transcription and motor learning. These findings define how sensory experience patterns chromatin architecture and neural circuit coding in the brain to drive motor learning. The authors identify a role for genome architecture reorganization in anterior dorsal cerebellar vermis granule neurons in learning a conditioned startle paradigm in mice."

https://openalex.org/W2944692722,"Aneuploidy, which refers to unbalanced chromosome numbers, represents a class of genetic variation that is associated with cancer, birth defects and eukaryotic micro-organisms1-4. Whereas it is known that each aneuploid chromosome stoichiometry can give rise to a distinct pattern of gene expression and phenotypic profile4,5, it remains a fundamental question as to whether there are common cellular defects that are associated with aneuploidy. Here we show the existence in budding yeast of a common aneuploidy gene-expression signature that is suggestive of hypo-osmotic stress, using a strategy that enables the observation of common transcriptome changes of aneuploidy by averaging out karyotype-specific dosage effects in aneuploid yeast-cell populations with random and diverse chromosome stoichiometry. Consistently, aneuploid yeast exhibited increased plasma-membrane stress that led to impaired endocytosis, and this defect was also observed in aneuploid human cells. Thermodynamic modelling showed that hypo-osmotic-like stress is a general outcome of the proteome imbalance that is caused by aneuploidy, and also predicted a relationship between ploidy and cell size that was observed in yeast and aneuploid cancer cells. A genome-wide screen uncovered a general dependency of aneuploid cells on a pathway of ubiquitin-mediated endocytic recycling of nutrient transporters. Loss of this pathway, coupled with the endocytic defect inherent to aneuploidy, leads to a marked alteration of intracellular nutrient homeostasis."

https://openalex.org/W2944476875,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aspergillus fumigatus are pathogens frequently co-inhabiting immunocompromised patient airways, particularly in people with cystic fibrosis. Both microbes depend on the availability of iron, and compete for iron in their microenvironment. We showed previously that the P. aeruginosa siderophore pyoverdine is the main instrument in battling A. fumigatus biofilms, by iron chelation and denial of iron to the fungus. Here we show that A. fumigatus siderophores defend against anti-fungal P. aeruginosa effects. P. aeruginosa supernatants produced in the presence of wildtype A. fumigatus planktonic supernatants (Afsup) showed less activity against A. fumigatus biofilms than P. aeruginosa supernatants without Afsup, despite higher production of pyoverdine by P. aeruginosa. Supernatants of A. fumigatus cultures lacking the sidA gene (AfΔsidA), unable to produce hydroxamate siderophores, were less capable of protecting A. fumigatus biofilms from P. aeruginosa supernatants and pyoverdine. AfΔsidA biofilm was more sensitive towards inhibitory effects of pyoverdine, the iron chelator deferiprone (DFP), or amphothericin B than wildtype A. fumigatus biofilm. Supplementation of sidA-deficient A. fumigatus biofilm with A. fumigatus siderophores restored resistance to pyoverdine. The A. fumigatus siderophore production inhibitor celastrol sensitized wildtype A. fumigatus biofilms towards the anti-fungal activity of DFP. In conclusion, A. fumigatus hydroxamate siderophores play a pivotal role in A. fumigatus competition for iron against P. aeruginosa."
https://openalex.org/W2944001231,"Thiol moieties are major targets for cold plasma-derived nitrogen and oxygen species, making CAPs convenient tools to modulate redox-signaling pathways in cells and tissues. The underlying biochemical pathways are currently under investigation but especially the role of CAP derived RNS is barely understood. Their potential role in protein thiol nitrosylation would be relevant in inflammatory processes such as wound healing and improving their specific production by CAP would allow for enhanced treatment options beyond the current application. The impact of a modified kINPen 09 argon plasma jet with nitrogen shielding on cysteine as a thiol-carrying model substance was investigated by FTIR spectroscopy and high-resolution mass spectrometry. The deposition of short-lived radical species was measured by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, long-lived species were quantified by ion chromatography (NO2-, NO3-) and xylenol orange assay (H2O2). Product profiles were compared to samples treated with the so-called COST jet, being introduced by a European COST initiative as a reference device, using both reference conditions as well as conditions adjusted to kINPen gas mixtures. While thiol oxidation was dominant under all tested conditions, an Ar + N2/O2 gas compositions combined with a nitrogen curtain fostered nitric oxide deposition and the desired generation of S-nitrosocysteine. Interestingly, the COST-jet revealed significant differences in its chemical properties in comparison to the kINPen by showing a more stable production of RNS with different gas admixtures, indicating a different •NO production pathway. Taken together, results indicate various chemical properties of kINPen and COST-jet as well as highlight the potential of plasma tuning not only by gas admixtures alone but by adjusting the surrounding atmosphere as well."
https://openalex.org/W2944425669,"Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a pathogen belonging to the genus Deltacoronavirus that in 2014 caused outbreaks of piglet diarrhea in the United States. To identify suitable therapeutic targets, a more comprehensive understanding of the viral entry pathway is required, particularly of the role of proteases. Here, we identified the proteases that activate the viral spike (S) glycoprotein to initiate cell entry and also pinpointed the host-cellular pathways that PDCoV uses for entry. Our results revealed that cathepsin L (CTSL) and cathepsin B (CTSB) in lysosomes and extracellular trypsin in cell cultures independently activate the S protein for membrane fusion. Pretreating the cells with the lysosomal acidification inhibitor bafilomycin-A1 (Baf-A1) completely inhibited PDCoV entry, and siRNA-mediated ablation of CTSL or CTSB expression significantly reduced viral infection, indicating that PDCoV uses an endosomal pathway for entry. Of note, trypsin treatment of cell cultures also activated PDCoV entry, even when the endosomal pathway was inhibited. This observation indicated that trypsin-induced S protein cleavage and activation in cell cultures enables viral entry directly from the cell surface. Our results provide critical insights into the PDCoV infection mechanism, uncovering two distinct viral entry pathways: one through cathepsin L and cathepsin B in the endosome and another via a protease at the cell surface. Because PDCoV infection sites represent a proteases-rich environment, these findings suggest that endosome inhibitor treatment alone is insufficient to block PDCoV entry into intestinal epithelial cells in vivo. Therefore, approaches that inhibit viral entry from the cell membrane should also be considered.

https://openalex.org/W2943919874,"Background Are we more risk-averse or risk-seeking when we make decisions on behalf of other people as opposed to ourselves? So far, findings have not been able to provide a clear and consistent answer. Method We propose a meta-analysis to assess whether self-other differences vary according to particular features of the decision. We reviewed 78 effect sizes from 49 studies (7,576 participants). Results There was no overall self-other difference, but there were moderating effects of domain and frame. Decisions in the interpersonal domain were more risk-averse for self than for other. Decisions in the medical domain were more risk-seeking for self than for other. There were no overall self-other differences in the financial domain, however there was a moderating effect of frame: decisions in a gain frame were more risk-averse for self than other whereas decisions in a loss frame were more risk-seeking for self than other. This effect of frame was slightly different overall and in the medical domain, where self-other differences occurred in a loss frame but not in a gain frame. Conclusion Future work should continue to investigate how the specific content and context of the decision impacts self-other differences in order to understand the effects of domain and frame we report."
https://openalex.org/W2944683909,"Camellia oleifera Abel (C. oleifera) absorb nutrients from surrounding soils and its yield is highly influenced by these nutrients and by fertilizer application. Thus, the soil nutrients play a central role in C. oleifera production. This study investigated the effects of biogas slurry applications on soil nutrients and economic traits of C. oleifera fruits. Five different amounts of biogas slurry (0, 10, 20, 30, or 40 kg/plant/year, three applications per year) were used as fertilizer for C. oleifera plants in 2015 and 2016. The nutrients of rhizosphere soil and the economic traits, including fruit yield, seed rate, and oil yield of C. oleifera fruit, were measured each year. The results showed that fertilization with biogas slurry significantly increased soil organic matter, available nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) both in 2015 and 2016. Increases in soil available N, P, and K were maximal in the highest slurry application group followed by the second highest application group. The oil yield correlated with the content of soil available P in both 2015 and 2016, and with soil organic matter in 2015. Fertilization with biogas slurry decreased the saturated fatty acid content in fruit but had no effect on the unsaturated fatty acid content. In conclusion, fertilization with biogas slurry increased rhizosphere soil nutrients and fruit economic traits of C. oleifera and rates of at least30 kg/plant/year had the most positive effects. This study expands the knowledge of fertilization with biogas slurry in C. oleifera production."
https://openalex.org/W2943963786,"We do not have a full understanding of the mechanisms underlying plasticity in the human brain. Mouse models have well controlled environments and genetics, and provide tools to help dissect the mechanisms underlying the observed responses to therapies devised for humans recovering from injury of ischemic nature or trauma. We aimed to detect plasticity following learning of a unilateral reaching movement, and relied on MRI performed with a rapid structural protocol suitable for in vivo brain imaging, and a longer diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) protocol executed ex vivo. In vivo MRI detected contralateral volume increases in trained animals (reachers), in circuits involved in motor control, sensory processing, and importantly, learning and memory. The temporal association area, parafascicular and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei were also enlarged. In vivo MRI allowed us to detect longitudinal effects over the ~25 days training period. The interaction between time and group (trained versus not trained) supported a role for the contralateral, but also the ipsilateral hemisphere. While ex vivo imaging was affected by shrinkage due to the fixation, it allowed for superior resolution and improved contrast to noise ratios, especially for subcortical structures. We examined microstructural changes based on DTI, and identified increased fractional anisotropy and decreased apparent diffusion coefficient, predominantly in the cerebellum and its connections. Cortical thickness differences did not survive multiple corrections, but uncorrected statistics supported the contralateral effects seen with voxel based volumetric analysis, showing thickening in the somatosensory, motor and visual cortices. In vivo and ex vivo analyses identified plasticity in circuits relevant to selecting actions in a sensory-motor context, through exploitation of learned association and decision making. By mapping a connectivity atlas into our ex vivo template we revealed that changes due to skilled motor learning occurred in a network of 35 regions, including the primary and secondary motor (M1, M2) and sensory cortices (S1, S2), the caudate putamen (CPu), visual (V1) and temporal association cortex. The significant clusters intersected tractography based networks seeded in M1, M2, S1, V1 and CPu at levels > 80%. We found that 89% of the significant cluster belonged to a network seeded in the contralateral M1, and 85% to one seeded in the contralateral M2. Moreover, 40% of the M1 and S1 cluster by network intersections were in the top 80th percentile of the tract densities for their respective networks. Our investigation may be relevant to studies of rehabilitation and recovery, and points to widespread network changes that accompany motor learning that may have potential applications to designing recovery strategies following brain injury."
https://openalex.org/W2944323804,"The scientific and ethical importance of including women of reproductive age in biomedical research is widely acknowledged. Concerns about preventing fetal exposure to research interventions have motivated requirements for contraception among reproductive aged women in biomedical studies–often irrespective of risks and benefits or a woman’s actual potential for pregnancy, raising important questions about when such requirements are appropriate. The perspectives of women themselves on these issues are largely unexplored. We conducted 140 interviews, 70 in the U.S. and 70 in Malawi, with women either living with or at-risk for HIV, exploring their views about the practice of requiring contraception in clinical trials. A majority of women interviewed from both countries indicated overall support for the practice, with seven themes characterizing advantages and disadvantages raised: reproductive control, health effects, prevention of fetal harm, burden on women, deferral to authority, autonomy regarding enrollment and birth control method, and relationship concerns. While women in the US frequently raised prevention of fetal harm as a key advantage, many other positives noted by women in both countries were related to contraception use in general, not specific to a trial context. With regard to disadvantages, U.S. women tended to focus on biomedical risks such as side effects and impact on fertility, whereas Malawian women focused on the social risks of contraception requirements, including violations of trust in marital relations and suspicions of potential infidelity. Given the potential benefits and burdens highlighted, contraception in research should be sensitive to actual fetal risk assessments; directed where justified at optimizing effective pregnancy prevention; responsive to women’s reproductive preferences; and made available as an ancillary benefit even where risk thresholds do not justify requirement–in order to facilitate trials that are both ethical and robustly oriented around the interests and lives of women who will participate in them."

Cosmetic formulations containing C. obtusa extract are commercially available for purchase; however, the chemical composition and the effects of the topical application of the extract are not described in the literature. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the main components of C. obtusa for the first time and to assess the anti aging effect in human fibroblasts and keratinocytes exposed to UVR. The main components in C. obtusa extract were identified by LC-DAD-MS/MS as chlorogenic acid (CGA), luteolin-C-hexoside, luteolin-C-hexose-O-deoxy-hexose, and apigenin-C-hexose-O-deoxy-hexose. C. obtusa extract and CGA decreased the metalloproteinase-1 and protein carbonyl levels and increased the collagen and hyaluronic acid contents. Overall, the extract exhibited better activity than CGA, and we demonstrated the ability of the extract to protect against the UV-induced increase in the pro inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-6, which are potential pathways of the antioxidant and anti aging effect. The chemical characterization added important data to broaden the knowledge related to C. obtusa, and the results suggest that the extract is a promising candidate to be incorporated in topical photochemoprotective formulations."
https://openalex.org/W2944638360,"Antibiotics are commonly used in livestock and poultry farming. Residual antibiotics in manure may lead to antibiotic pollution of soil, surface water, and groundwater through land application and run-off rainfall. The black soldier fly (BSF) Hermetia illucens is a good candidate for manure management. We evaluated the effect of sulfonamide pollution on the growth of H. illucens. Four treatments were considered with a sulfonamide content in the feed of 0 (control group), 0.1, 1, and 10 mg/kg. The control larvae were fed without sulfonamide. Survival and development status of the individuals were recorded daily. The weights of the fifth instar larvae, prepupae, and pupae were checked. Antioxidant enzyme activity was determined with the fifth instar larvae. The results showed that a low (0.1 and 1 mg/kg) concentration of sulfonamides had no effects on larval survival, pupation, and eclosion of BSFs. A high sulfonamide concentration of 10 mg/kg had a significant effect on the survival of larvae and pupae and on the body weight of larvae, prepupae and pupae. Peak of the cumulated pupation rate and eclosion rate in the sulfonamide treatment of 10 mg/kg was very low. Pupation and eclosion in this group peaked later than that of the control and low sulfonamide concentration treatment groups (0.1 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg). Larvae from the sulfonamides group showed lower antioxidase activities than that of the control. In sulfonamide groups, the activity of peroxidase and superoxide dismutase was reduced in a concentration-dependent manner. Sulfamonomethoxine, sulfamethoxazole, and sulfamethazine were not detected in the harvested prepupae. Only sulfadiazine was discovered in the sulfonamide treatments of 1 and 10 mg/kg. In conclusion, BSFs can tolerate certain concentrations of sulfonamide contamination."
https://openalex.org/W2944709688,"Stroke patients are at high risk of developing pneumonia, which is major cause of post-stroke mortality. Proton pump inhibitors and H2 receptor antagonists are anti-ulcer drugs, which may predispose to the development of pneumonia by suppression of the gastric acid with bactericidal activity. Unlike proton pump inhibitors and H2 receptor antagonists, mucoprotective agents have gastroprotective effects with no or less anti-acid property. We aimed to investigate effects of the acid-suppressive medications (proton pump inhibitors and H2 receptor antagonists) and mucoprotective agents on risk for post-stroke pneumonia using the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort in Korea. This retrospective cohort study included 8,319 patients with acute ischemic stroke. Use of proton pump inhibitors, H2 receptor antagonists, and mucoprotective agents (rebamipide, teprenone, irsogladine, ecabet, polaprezinc, sofalcone, sucralfate, and misoprostol) after stroke were determined based on the prescription records, which were treated as time-dependent variables. Primary outcome was the development of post-stroke pneumonia. During the mean follow-up period of 3.95 years after stroke, 2,035 (24.5%) patients had pneumonia. In the multivariate time-dependent Cox regression analyses (adjusted hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]), there was significantly increased risk for pneumonia with use of proton pump inhibitors (1.56 [1.24-1.96]) and H2 receptor antagonists (1.40 [1.25-1.58]). In contrast to the proton pump inhibitors and H2 receptor antagonists, use of mucoprotective agents did not significantly increase the risk for pneumonia (0.89 [0.78-1.01]). In conclusion, the treatment with proton pump inhibitors and H2 receptor antagonists was associated with increased risk for pneumonia in stroke patients. Clinicians should use caution in prescribing the acid-suppressive medications for the stroke patients at great risk for pneumonia."
https://openalex.org/W2949067578,"The transient build-up of DNA supercoiling during the translocation of replication forks threatens genome stability and is controlled by DNA topoisomerases (TOPs). This crucial process has been exploited with TOP poisons for cancer chemotherapy. However, pinpointing cellular determinants of the best clinical response to TOP poisons still remains enigmatic. Here, we present an integrated approach and demonstrate that endogenous and exogenous expression of the oncofetal high-mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2) protein exhibited broad protection against the formation of hydroxyurea-induced DNA breaks in various cancer cells, thus corroborating our previously proposed model in which HMGA2 functions as a replication fork chaperone that forms a protective DNA scaffold at or close to stalled replication forks. We now further demonstrate that high levels of HMGA2 also protected cancer cells against DNA breaks triggered by the clinically important TOP1 poison irinotecan. This protection is most likely due to the recently identified DNA supercoil constraining function of HMGA2 in combination with exclusion of TOP1 from binding to supercoiled substrate DNA. In contrast, low to moderate HMGA2 protein levels surprisingly potentiated the formation of irinotecan-induced genotoxic covalent TOP1-DNA cleavage complexes. Our data from cell-based and several in vitro assays indicate that, mechanistically, this potentiating role involves enhanced drug-target interactions mediated by HMGA2 in ternary complexes with supercoiled DNA. Subtelomeric regions were found to be extraordinarily vulnerable to these genotoxic challenges induced by TOP1 poisoning, pointing at strong DNA topological barriers located at human telomeres. These findings were corroborated by an increased irinotecan sensitivity of patient-derived xenografts of colorectal cancers exhibiting low to moderate HMGA2 levels. Collectively, we uncovered a therapeutically important control mechanism of transient changes in chromosomal DNA topology that ultimately leads to enhanced human subtelomere stability."
https://openalex.org/W2943934716,"Various bacteria that adhere to the gut are important for the health of fish. Regulating the microbial community in a desirable direction may be beneficial in aquaculture for preventing and controlling the diseases caused by pathogenic microbes. In this study, we investigated the changes in the microflora in the intestinal tracts of turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) larvae after introducing a probiotic (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens) after the first feed. B. amyloliquefaciens was added as part of a nutrient enrichment system in live feed (Branchionus plicatilis or Artemia sinica), so it passed into the intestinal tracts of the newly hatched turbot larvae. The turbot larvae were fed on live feed containing B. amyloliquefaciens in the experimental group, whereas live feed without the probiotic was provided to larvae in the control group. The total bacterial genomic DNA in the larval guts was extracted and sequenced with an Illumina HiSeq PE250 system. According to the sequencing results, the abundances of microbial species and the microflora diversity were lower in the intestines in the experimental group than the control. Throughout development, the microflora structure in the intestines was mainly constructed before the first feed and the composition of the dominant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) was stable, where the abundances of OTU8, OTU124, OTU150, OTU107, and OTU17 were always high. Compared with the control, the structures of the microflora in the intestines were similar on different days during the development and the growth of larvae in the experimental group. However, the similarity of the microflora structure between different treatments was low on the same day. Furthermore, the mean proportion of common OTUs was only 74.7% in different treatments on each day, which indicates that the introduction of B. amyloliquefaciens in the live feed changed the microflora structure in the intestine. During the early development stage (days 3–30), the average abundance of Pseudomonas was reduced by 0.8% whereas that of Lactococcus increased by 3.5% in the experimental group. Pseudomonas spp. are considered potentially pathogenic bacteria but there is no direct evidence for the pathogenicity of Lactococcus in turbot. Moreover, several Lactococcus species are regarded as probiotics in aquaculture. Therefore, the use of B. amyloliquefaciens could be beneficial for optimizing the microbial community structure in the intestines of turbot larvae, which may explain the probiotic effect of B. amyloliquefaciens. This study provides a theoretical basis for the biological regulation of the microflora structure in the intestinal tract during turbot breeding."
https://openalex.org/W2944217428,"Breast density, as estimated by mammography, is a strong risk factor for breast cancer in pre- and postmenopausal women, but the determinants of breast density have not yet been established. The aim of this study was to assess if urinary estrogens or gut microbiota alterations are associated with mammographic density in postmenopausal women.Among 54 cancer-free, postmenopausal controls in the Breast and Colon Health study, we classified low- versus high-density women with Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS, 5th edition) mammographic screening data, then assessed associations with urinary estrogens and estrogen metabolites (determined by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry), and fecal microbiota alpha and beta diversity (using Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons).Multiple logistic regression revealed no significant association between breast density and fecal microbiota metrics (PD_tree P-value = 0.82; un-weighted and weighted UniFrac P = 0.92 and 0.83, respectively, both by MiRKAT). In contrast, total urinary estrogens (and all 15 estrogens/estrogen metabolites) were strongly and inversely associated with breast density (P = 0.01) after adjustment for age and body mass index.Mammographic density was not associated with the gut microbiota, but it was inversely associated with urinary estrogen levels.The finding of an inverse association between urinary estrogens and breast density in cancer-free women adds to the growing breast cancer literature on understanding the relationship between endogenous estrogens and mammographic density."
https://openalex.org/W2949071129,"Broodiness, one of the maternal behaviors and instincts for natural breeding in birds, is an interesting topic in reproductive biology. Broodiness in poultry is characterized by persistent nesting, usually associated with cessation of egg laying. The study of avian broodiness is essential for bird conservation breeding and commercial poultry industry. In this study, we examined the hypothalamus transcriptome of Muscovy duck in three reproductive stages, including egg-laying anaphase (LA), brooding prophase (BP) and brooding metaphase (BM). Differences in gene expression during the transition from egg-laying to broodiness were examined, and 155, 379, 292 differently expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained by pairwise comparisons of LA-vs-BP, LA-vs-BM and BP-vs-BM, respectively (fold change≥1.5, P < 0.05). Gene Ontology Term (GO) enrichment analysis suggested a possible role of oxidative stress in the hypothalamus might invoke reproductive costs that potentially change genes expression. KEGG analysis revealed glutamatergic synapse, dopaminergic synapse, serotonergic synapse and GABAergic synapse pathway were significantly enriched, and regulator genes were identified. Eight gene expression patterns were illustrated by trend analysis and further clustered into three clusters. Additional six hub genes were identified through combining trend analysis and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis. Our results suggested that the cyclical mechanisms of reproductive function conversion include effects of oxidative stress, biosynthesis of neurotransmitters or their receptors, and interactions between glucocorticoids and thyroid hormones and regulatory genes. These candidate genes and biological pathways may be used as targets for artificial manipulation and marker-assisted breeding in the reproductive behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2944478026,"Despite extensive investigations of dissipation and deformation processes in micro- and nano- sized metallic samples, the mechanisms at play during deformation of systems with ultimate, molecular size remain elusive. While metallic nanojunctions, obtained by stretching metallic wires down to the atomic level are a system of choice to explore atomic scale contacts, it has not been possible up to now to extract the full equilibrium and out of equilibrium rheological flow properties of matter at such scales. Here, by using a quartz-tuning fork based Atomic Force Microscope (TF-AFM), we combine electrical and rheological measurement on angstr\""om-size gold junctions to study the non linear rheology of this model atomic system. By submitting the junction to increasing sub-nanometric deformations we uncover a transition from a purely elastic regime to a plastic, and eventually to a viscous-like fluidized regime, akin to the rheology of soft yielding materials, though orders of magnitude difference in length scale. The fluidized state furthermore highlights capillary attraction, as expected for liquid capillary bridges. This shear fluidization cannot be captured by classical models of friction between atomic planes, pointing to unexpected dissipative behavior of defect-free metallic junctions at the ultimate scales. Atomic rheology is therefore a powerful tool to probe the structural reorganization of atomic contacts."

This paper identifies a crucial mistaken assumption: that micro-CT data fails to capture any information representing the presence of carbon ink. Instead, we show new experiments indicating a subtle but detectable signature from carbon ink in micro-CT. We demonstrate a new computational approach that captures, enhances, and makes visible the characteristic signature created by carbon ink in micro-CT. This previously “unseen” evidence of carbon inks, which can now successfully be made visible, is a discovery that can lead directly to the noninvasive digital recovery of the lost texts of Herculaneum."
https://openalex.org/W2944588975,"Audiovisual educational material has been used effectively as a knowledge translation strategy in patient education. Given the need to impact maternal mortality rates, 12 video clips related to maternal and neonatal health information were designed based on the results of a previous systematic review (SR). The content was formulated based on clinical practice guideline recommendations and validated following a formal consensus methodology. This study evaluated the effectiveness of knowledge transfer from the 12 video clips in terms of attention, emotional response, and recall by using neuroscience tools. In a randomized cross-over trial, 155 subjects (pregnant women, non-pregnant women, and men) received random sequences of 13 video clips, including a control video clip. Participants' attention levels were evaluated through eye tracking, their emotional reactions were monitored by electrodermal activity and pupillary diameter, and their recall was tested via a questionnaire. An analysis was performed to evaluate differences in the groups and between the video clips and the control clip using variance analysis models that considered period, sequence, and carry-over effects. Results revealed that fixation length was greater in women than in men, while the greatest emotional effects occurred in men. All three groups had good recall results, without any significant differences between them. Although the sequencing did influence attentional processes, no carry-over effect was demonstrated. However, a differential effect was noted among video clips in all three outcomes, that is, when adjusted for group, level of education, and having had children. The control clip generated less attention, emotional reaction, and recall than the experimental video clips. The video clips about maternal and neonatal health were shown to be effective in the transference and comprehension of information. Therefore, cognitive neuroscience techniques are useful in evaluating knowledge translation strategies through audiovisual formats."
https://openalex.org/W2944635360,"Bone is a highly metabolic organ that undergoes continuous remodeling to maintain its structural integrity. During development, bones, in particular osteoblasts, rely on glucose uptake. However, the role of glucose metabolism in osteocytes is unknown. Osteocytes are terminally differentiated osteoblasts orchestrating bone modeling and remodeling. In these cells, parathyroid hormone (PTH) suppresses Sost/sclerostin expression (a potent inhibitor of bone formation) by promoting nuclear translocation of class IIa histone deacetylase (HDAC) 4 and 5 and the repression of myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) type C. Recently, Scriptaid, an HDAC complex co-repressor inhibitor, has been shown to induce MEF2 activation and exercise-like adaptation in mice. In muscles, Scriptaid disrupts the HDAC4/5 co-repressor complex, increases MEF2C function, and promotes cell respiration. We hypothesized that Scriptaid, by affecting HDAC4/5 localization and MEF2C activation, might affect osteocyte functions. Treatment of the osteocytic Ocy454-12H cells with Scriptaid increased metabolic gene expression, cell respiration, and glucose uptake. Similar effects were also seen upon treatment with PTH, suggesting that both Scriptaid and PTH can promote osteocyte metabolism. Similar to PTH, Scriptaid potently suppressed Sost expression. Silencing of HDAC5 in Ocy454-12H cells abolished Sost suppression but not glucose transporter type 4 (Glut4) up-regulation induced by Scriptaid. These results demonstrate that Scriptaid increases osteocyte respiration and glucose uptake by mechanisms independent of HDAC complex inhibition. In osteocytes, Scriptaid, similar to PTH, increases binding of HDAC5 to Mef2c with suppression of Sost but only partially increases receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (Rankl) expression, suggesting a potential bone anabolic effect."
https://openalex.org/W2944739625,"Biodiversity offsetting typically involves the trade of certain losses of habitat with uncertain future conservation benefits. Predicting the latter requires estimates of two outcomes; the biodiversity losses without conservation management (averted loss), and the biodiversity gains with conservation management (management gain). However, because empirical data to inform these estimates are limited, they are normally guided by expert opinion, often derived via unstructured methods without consideration of uncertainty. Here we used a structured elicitation with 29 experts to gather estimates of averted loss and management gain at offset sites. We used two methods; (i) experts estimated change in an aggregate biodiversity value (vegetation condition) and; (ii) experts provided probabilistic estimates of change for individual vegetation condition attributes, such as the richness and cover of plant growth forms. On average, experts predicted there would be only modest improvements with conservation management, yet uncertainty and variation among experts was large; in some cases, conservation benefits were not predicted. Estimates of change in vegetation condition suggested that benefits were from both averted loss and management gains and were thought to most likely arise in cases where starting condition was low to moderate. Similar patterns were observed for individual vegetation condition attributes, with management gains, relative to a reference, tending to be negatively correlated with starting value. Our study finds that: (i) on average, gains at offset sites are expected to be small, (ii) at many sites, experts do not believe gains can be obtained, and (iii) experts' opinions can be divergent resulting in elevated levels of uncertainty. The potential for losses under conservation management highlights the need to: identify those components of biodiversity most likely to benefit from conservation management; better understand those situations when offset obligations are most likely to be met and conversely those situations with higher risk; and further develop offset mechanisms that encourage early or prior gains. These findings together with the global proliferation of biodiversity offsetting, provide a strong imperative to improve empirical data and investment in long-term, site-based monitoring of biodiversity outcomes at offset sites."
https://openalex.org/W2944238414,"Primates are extracted from the wild for the pet trade across the world. In Madagascar, lemurs are kept as illegal pets and an understanding of lemur pet ownership at the national level is lacking. In 2013 and 2016, we undertook a national survey in 11 of Madagascar’s 22 administrative regions (n = 28 towns) with 1,709 households. To our knowledge, this is the first national survey of the household ownership of pet primates in a country where they are endemic. In the 1.5 years prior to being surveyed, 8% ± 4% (towns as replicates) of respondents had seen a captive lemur while a further 0.7% ± 0.5% of respondents had owned one personally. We estimate that 33,428 ± 24,846 lemurs were kept in Malagasy households in the six months prior to our survey efforts, with 18,462 ± 12,963 of these pet lemurs estimated in urban household alone. Rates of lemur ownership did not differ by province but increased with the human population of a town and with the popularity of the town on Flickr (a proxy indicator for tourism). We found that the visibility of pet lemur ownership did not differ across the country, but it did increase with the size of the town and popularity with tourists. Areas with visible pet lemurs were not always the areas with the highest rates of pet lemur ownership, highlighting that many pet lemurs are hidden from the general public. Our study highlights the need for conservation programs to consider both the proportion of inhabitants that own pet lemurs and the total number of lemurs that are potentially being kept as pets in those towns. We close by noting that for some species, even just a small amount of localized live extraction for pet ownership could be enough to cause localized population extinctions over time. Moreover, an urgent response is needed to combat a recent and alarming rise in illegal exploitation of biodiversity across Madagascar."
https://openalex.org/W2944439315,"In many seabirds, individuals abstain from eating during the moult period. Penguins have an intense moult that lasts for weeks, during which they are confined to land. Despite the importance for survival, it is still unclear how the faecal microbiota of Antarctic penguins changes in response to the moult fast. Here, we investigated the faecal microbiota of chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarcticus) and gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) on King George Island, Antarctica. The bacterial community compositions during the feeding and moulting stages were compared for both species using bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicon on an Illumina MiSeq platform. Our results showed that the moult fast altered the bacterial community structures in both penguin species. Interestingly, the bacterial community composition shifted in the same direction in response to the moult fast but formed two distinct clusters that were specific to each penguin species. A significant increase in bacterial diversity was observed in gentoo penguins, whereas no such change was observed for chinstrap penguins. By analysing the contribution of the ecological processes that determine bacterial community assembly, we observed that processes regulating community turnover were considerably different between the feeding and moulting stages for each penguin. At the phylum level, the relative abundances of Fusobacteria, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were dominant in chinstrap penguins, and no significant changes were detected in these phyla between the feeding and moulting periods. Our results suggest that moult fast-induced changes in the faecal microbiota occur in both species."
https://openalex.org/W2949948683,"Long-term stock decline in the Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica) is a serious issue. To reduce natural resource utilization in Japan, artificial hormonal induction of maturation and fertilization in the Japanese eel has been intensively studied. Recent experiment on feminized (by feeding a commercial diet containing estradiol-17β for first half year) cultured female eels have shown ovulation problems, which is seldom observed in captured wild female eels. Therefore, the aim of this study is to try to investigate causes of ovulation problem frequently seen in cultured female eels by comparative trans-omics analyses. The omics data showed low growth hormone and luteinizing hormone transcription levels in the brain and low sex hormone–binding globulin transcription levels in the liver of the cultured female eels. In addition, it was found that high accumulation of glucose-6-phosphate and, maltose in the liver of the cultured female eel. It was also found that docosahexaenoic (DHA) acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and arachidonic acid (ARA) ratios in cultured female eels were quite different from wild female eels. The data suggested that ovulation problem in cultured female eels was possibly resulted from prolonged intake of a high-carbohydrate diet and/or suboptimal DHA/EPA/ARA ratios in a diet."
https://openalex.org/W2944179327,"The airway epithelial barrier is critical for preventing pathogen invasion and translocation of inhaled particles into the lung. Epithelial cells also serve an important sentinel role after infection and release various pro-inflammatory mediators that recruit and activate immune cells. Airway epithelial barrier disruption has been implicated in a growing number of respiratory diseases including viral infections. It is thought that when a pathogen breaks the barrier and gains access to the host tissue, pro-inflammatory mediators increase, which further disrupts the barrier and initiates a vicious cycle of leak. However, it is difficult to study airway barrier integrity in vivo, and little is known about relationship between epithelial barrier function and airway inflammation. Current assays of pulmonary barrier integrity quantify the leak of macromolecules from the vasculature into the airspaces (or “inside/out” leak). However, it is also important to measure the ease with which inhaled particles, allergens, or pathogens can enter the subepithelial tissues (or “outside/in” leak). We challenged mice with inhaled double stranded RNA (dsRNA) and explored the relationship between inside/out and outside/in barrier function and airway inflammation. Using wild-type and gene-targeted mice, we studied the roles of the dsRNA sensors Toll Like Receptor 3 (TLR3) and Melanoma Differentiation-Associated protein 5 (MDA5). Here we report that after acute challenge with inhaled dsRNA, airway barrier dysfunction occurs in a TLR3-dependent manner, whereas leukocyte accumulation is largely MDA5-dependent. We conclude that airway barrier dysfunction and inflammation are regulated by different mechanisms at early time points after exposure to inhaled dsRNA."

https://openalex.org/W2944053644,"ATP hydrolysis activity catalyzed by chloroplast and proteobacterial ATP synthase is inhibited by their e subunits. To clarify the function of the e subunit from phototrophs, here we analyzed the e subunit–mediated inhibition (e-inhibition) of cyanobacterial F1-ATPase, a subcomplex of ATP synthase obtained from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1. We generated three C-terminal α-helix null e-mutants; one lacked the C-terminal α-helices, and in the other two, the C-terminal conformation could be locked by a disulfide bond formed between two α-helices or an α-helix and a β-sandwich structure. All of these e-mutants maintained ATPase-inhibiting competency. We then used single-molecule observation techniques to analyze the rotary motion of F1-ATPase in the presence of these e-mutants. The stop angular position of the γ subunit in the presence of the e-mutant was identical to that in the presence of the WT e. Using magnetic tweezers, we examined recovery from the inhibited rotation and observed restoration of rotation by 80° forcing of the γ subunit in the case of the ADP-inhibited form, but not when the rotation was inhibited by the e-mutants or by the WT e subunit. These results imply that the C-terminal α-helix domain of the e subunit of cyanobacterial enzyme does not directly inhibit ATP hydrolysis and that its N-terminal domain alone can inhibit the hydrolysis activity. Notably, this property differed from that of the proteobacterial e, which could not tightly inhibit rotation. We conclude that phototrophs and heterotrophs differ in the e subunit–mediated regulation of ATP synthase."
https://openalex.org/W2944647821,"Infectious virus-laden aerosols generated during poultry processing may mediate airborne transmissions of avian influenza at live poultry markets. To develop effective control measures to reduce aerosol dispersion, we characterised the aerosol flow pattern of the mechanical defeatherers, a major source of aerosol dispersion during poultry processing at live poultry markets in China. Mechanical defeatherers create a strong air circulation during operation with inflow and outflow velocities over 1 m/s. A partial lid was designed to suppress the outflow and reduce aerosol dispersion. Computational fluid dynamics simulations confirmed that the partial lid prototype reduced the aerosol escape rate by over 65%. To validate the effectiveness of the partial lid in reducing aerosol dispersion, a field study was conducted at a retail poultry shop in Guangzhou and the concentrations of influenza viral RNA and avian 18S rRNA dispersed in air were monitored during poultry processing, with and without the use of the partial lid. At the breathing zone of the poultry worker, the use of the partial lid effectively suppressed the upward airflow and reduced the concentration of avian 18S rRNA in the air by 57%. The economic and practical partial lid can be easily implemented to reduce generation of influenza virus-laden aerosols at live poultry markets."
https://openalex.org/W2943913768,"Although accepted agents in chorioamnionitis and preterm birth, the role of Ureaplasma species (spp.) in inflammation-driven morbidities of prematurity, including the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, remains controversial. To add to scarce in vitro data addressing the pro-inflammatory capacity of Ureaplasma spp., pulmonary epithelial-like A549 cells and human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMEC) were incubated with Ureaplasma (U.) urealyticum, U. parvum, and Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Ureaplasma isolates down-regulated caspase mRNA levels in A549 cells (caspase 8: p<0.001, 9: p<0.001, vs. broth), while increasing caspase protein expression, enzyme activity, and cell death in HPMEC (active caspase 3: p<0.05, caspase 8: p<0.05, active caspase 9: p<0.05, viability: p<0.05). LPS, contrarily, induced caspase mRNA expression in HPMEC (caspase 3: p<0.01, 4: p<0.001, 5: p<0.001, 8: p<0.001, vs. control), but not in A549 cells, and did not affect enzyme activity or protein levels in either cell line. LPS, but neither Ureaplasma isolate, enhanced mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-6 in both A549 (p<0.05, vs. control) and HPMEC (p<0.001) as well as tumor necrosis factor-α (p<0.01), IL-1β (p<0.001), and IL-8 (p<0.05) in HPMEC. We are therefore the first to demonstrate a differential modulation of pulmonary caspases by Ureaplasma spp. in vitro. Ureaplasma-driven enhanced protein expression and activity of caspases in pulmonary endothelial cells result in cell death and may cause structural damage. Down-regulated caspase mRNA in pulmonary epithelial cells, contrarily, may indicate Ureaplasma-induced inhibition of apoptosis and prevent effective immune responses. Both may ultimately contribute to chronic Ureaplasma colonization and long-term pulmonary inflammation."

A qualitative study, involving ten Brazilian dental surgeons working in Primary Care in 2016, was designed. In-depth semi-structured interviews were performed, with all interviews recorded, transcribed and subsequently submitted to Qualitative Content Analysis. Despite the Healthcare Promotion model proposed by the Brazilian oral health policy, dental surgeons demonstrated preferences for private and traditional dental practices. These characteristics are counterproductive in public oral health services, which aim to achieve collective health benefits. Traditional practice is based upon a specific and restricted focus, as opposed to overall patient care, hence maintaining the original professional identity, ruled by manual procedures, while demonstrating scientifically fragile understanding of disease processes. Despite the implementation of public service models that aim at change, counterproductive characteristics associated with the deeply rooted traditional management strategies were evidenced."

Although Nigeria bears one of the world's largest burdens of both malaria and HIV, there is almost no research studying how co-infected patients manage their care. We systematically sampled 398 PLWHA receiving care at Imo State Specialist Hospital and the Federal Medical Centre in Owerri to complete a structured, pre-tested questionnaire on malaria care-seeking behaviour. Descriptive statistics were reported and chi-square tests and multivariate logistic regressions were also used. The majority of HIV-infected patients (78.9%) reported having had an episode of suspected malaria quarterly or more often. There was a large variation in care-seeking patterns: on suspicion of malaria, 29.1% of participants engaged in self-medication; 39.2% went to drug shops, and only 22.6% visited HIV/AIDS care centres. Almost 40% waited more than 24 hours before initiating treatment. Most (60.3%), reported taking recommended artemisinin-based combination treatments (ACT) but a significant minority took only paracetamol (25.6%) or herbal remedies (3.5%). Most (80%) finished their chosen course of treatment; and completion of treatment was significantly associated with the frequency of suspected malaria occurrence (p = 0.03). Most (62.8%) did not take anti-malaria medication while taking antiretroviral treatment (ART) and almost all (87.6%) reported taking an ACT regimen that could potentially interact with Nigeria's first-line ART regimen. Our findings suggest the need to pay more attention to malaria prevention and control as a crucial element in HIV/AIDS management in this part of Nigeria and other areas where malaria and HIV/AIDS are co-endemic. Also, more research on ART-ACT interactions, better outreach to community-level drug shops and other private sector stakeholders, and clearer guidelines for clinicians and patients on preventing and managing co-infection may be needed. This will require improved collaboration between programmes for both diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2944658847,"Increasing modern contraceptive use is important for improving maternal and child health and achieving economic growth and development goals. However, pervasive high unmet need for modern contraceptives in sub-Saharan Africa warrants new understandings of the drivers of modern contraceptive use. A deviance approach (i.e., examining how women's experiences/characteristics differ from other women in their community) provides an innovative framework for capturing heterogeneity among women in a community. This framework can inform public health programming by both exploring how women avoid adverse health outcomes and understanding the needs of harder-to-reach populations who may experience health risks, despite living in communities where others do not experience vulnerability. Using data from Demographic and Health Surveys from 29 sub-Saharan African countries, we examine how a woman's deviation from community norms around socioeconomic characteristics and gender and fertility norms and behaviors is associated with modern contraceptive use. Random-effects logistic regression models were fitted for each country to examine relationships between modern contraceptive use and deviance. Some deviance factors were associated with modern contraceptive use in only a few countries, while others were significant across many countries. Cross-country consistency in the direction of the relationship between deviance and modern contraceptive use varied by the specific deviance factor, with some relationships being consistent across countries, and other relationships being more varied. For example, having more education than the community norm was associated with increased modern contraceptive use across countries; however, marrying older than other women in the community was associated with an increase in modern contraceptive use in some countries and a decrease in others. More work is needed to understand the role of deviance on modern contraceptive use; however, this study suggests that using context-specific deviance approaches may be important for further elucidating experiences of modern contraceptive use."
