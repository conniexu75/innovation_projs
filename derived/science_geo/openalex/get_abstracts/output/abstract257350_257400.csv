https://openalex.org/W2049595315,"Catechol- O -methyltransferase (COMT) is a key regulator of pain perception, cognitive function, and affective mood. Three common haplotypes of the human COMT gene, divergent in two synonymous and one nonsynonymous position, code for differences in COMT enzymatic activity and are associated with pain sensitivity. Haplotypes divergent in synonymous changes exhibited the largest difference in COMT enzymatic activity, due to a reduced amount of translated protein. The major COMT haplotypes varied with respect to messenger RNA local stem-loop structures, such that the most stable structure was associated with the lowest protein levels and enzymatic activity. Site-directed mutagenesis that eliminated the stable structure restored the amount of translated protein. These data highlight the functional significance of synonymous variations and suggest the importance of haplotypes over single-nucleotide polymorphisms for analysis of genetic variations."

https://openalex.org/W2028682232,"Innate immune signals mediated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have been thought to contribute considerably to the antibody-enhancing effects of vaccine adjuvants. However, we report here that mice deficient in the critical signaling components for TLR mount robust antibody responses to T cell–dependent antigen given in four typical adjuvants: alum, Freund's complete adjuvant, Freund's incomplete adjuvant, and monophosphoryl-lipid A/trehalose dicorynomycolate adjuvant. We conclude that TLR signaling does not account for the action of classical adjuvants and does not fully explain the action of a strong adjuvant containing a TLR ligand. This may have important implications in the use and development of vaccine adjuvants."

https://openalex.org/W1980800453,"Most studies of protein networks operate on a high level of abstraction, neglecting structural and chemical aspects of each interaction. Here, we characterize interactions by using atomic-resolution information from three-dimensional protein structures. We find that some previously recognized relationships between network topology and genomic features (e.g., hubs tending to be essential proteins) are actually more reflective of a structural quantity, the number of distinct binding interfaces. Subdividing hubs with respect to this quantity provides insight into their evolutionary rate and indicates that additional mechanisms of network growth are active in evolution (beyond effective preferential attachment through gene duplication)."

https://openalex.org/W1979583222,"The catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) is rapidly phosphorylated at the Thr-2609 cluster and Ser-2056 upon ionizing radiation (IR). Furthermore, DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at both regions is critical for its role in DNA double strand break (DSB) repair as well as cellular resistance to radiation. IR-induced DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at Thr-2609 and Ser-2056, however, exhibits distinct kinetics indicating that they are differentially regulated. Although DNA-PKcs autophosphorylates itself at Ser-2056 after IR, we have reported here that ATM mediates DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at Thr-2609 as well as at the adjacent (S/T)Q motifs within the Thr-2609 cluster. In addition, our data suggest that DNA-PKcs- and ATM-mediated DNA-PKcs phosphorylations are cooperative and required for the full activation of DNA-PKcs and the subsequent DSB repair. Elimination of DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at both regions severely compromises radioresistance and DSB repair. Finally, our result provides a possible mechanism for the direct involvement of ATM in non-homologous end joining-mediated DSB repair.

Finally, our result provides a possible mechanism for the direct involvement of ATM in non-homologous end joining-mediated DSB repair. Among the different types of DNA damage, DNA double strand break (DSB) 3The abbreviations used are: DSB, double strand break; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia mutated; DNA-PKcs, DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit; IR, ionizing radiation; NHEJ, non-homologous end joining; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; KD, kinase-dead; WT, wild-type; Gy, gray. is the most detrimental type of DNA lesion. Unattended DSBs often lead to cell death, genomic instability, and tumorigenesis (1van Gent D.C. Hoeijmakers J.H. Kanaar R. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar, 2Khanna K.K. Jackson S.P. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1940) Google Scholar, 3Bassing C.H. Alt F.W. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, DSBs are predominantly repaired by the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, which reconnects the broken DNA ends together directly without using a homologous DNA template as homologous recombination does (4Wyman C. Kanaar R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2006; 40: 363-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). The NHEJ pathway is governed by DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) which is composed of the DNA end-binding Ku70/80 heterodimer and the catalytic subunit DNA-PKcs kinase. The intrinsic kinase activity of DNA-PKcs is essential for cellular resistance to radiation and NHEJ-mediated DSB repair (5Kurimasa A. Kumano S. Boubnov N.V. Story M.D. Tung C.S. Peterson S.R.

DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), most likely through phosphorylation of NHEJ components, including DNA-PKcs itself. DNA-PKcs is rapidly autophosphorylated in vitro upon activation and is phosphorylated in vivo after ionizing radiation (IR). Many in vitro and in vivo phosphorylation sites of DNA-PKcs have been identified thus far, including the Thr-2609 cluster (7Chan D.W. Chen B.P. Prithivirajsingh S. Kurimasa A. Story M.D. Qin J.

Schwarz K. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33839-33846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The majority of these phosphorylation sites are of the (S/T)Q motif (serine or threonine followed by a glutamine residue) commonly present in many DNA damage repair proteins and are the cognate substrates of phosphoinositide kinase-related protein kinases, including DNA-PKcs, ATM, and ATR (ATM-Rad3-related) kinases (12Kim S.T.

Similar to its kinase activity, DNA-PKcs phosphorylation is also required for NHEJ-mediated DSB repair. Particularly, mutations at the Thr-2609 cluster severely compromise the ability of DNA-PKcs to restore the radioresistance and DSB repair defects in DNA-PKcs-deficient cells (7Chan D.W. Chen B.P. Prithivirajsingh S. Kurimasa A. Story M.D. Qin J. Chen D.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 15Ding Q. Reddy Y.V. Wang W. Woods T. Douglas P. Ramsden D.A. Lees-Miller S.P. Meek K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5836-5848Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that, among the many phosphorylation sites identified, phosphorylations of DNA-PKcs at Thr-2609 and Ser-2056 occur in vivo upon IR (7Chan D.W. Chen B.P. Prithivirajsingh S. Kurimasa A. Story M.D. Qin J. Chen D.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 10Chen B.P. Chan D.W. Kobayashi J. Burma S. Asaithamby A.

Although DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation is responsible for IR-induced Ser-2056 phosphorylation, our data suggest that ATM is likely the kinase mediating IR-induced DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at Thr-2609 and other phosphorylation sites within the Thr-2609 cluster (10Chen B.P. Chan D.W. Kobayashi J. Burma S. Asaithamby A. Morotomi-Yano K. Botvinick E. Qin J. Chen D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14709-14715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). ATM and DNA-PKcs are the major kinases activated upon IR and are both required for cellular resistance to radiation. Although DNA-PKcs plays a direct role in DSB repair, ATM plays a more general role in activating the DNA damage response, which spans many signaling pathways including the cell cycle checkpoints (16Shiloh Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 402-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that ATM is specifically required for the repair of slow kinetics DSBs (17Kuhne M. Riballo E. Rief N. Rothkamm K. Jeggo P.A. Lobrich M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 18Riballo E. Kuhne M. Rief N. Doherty A. Smith G.C. Recio M.J. Reis C. Dahm K. Fricke A. Krempler A. Parker A.R. Jackson S.P. Gennery A. Jeggo P.A. Lobrich M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 715-724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). The possible involvement of ATM in phosphorylating DNA-PKcs could further unveil the role of ATM in DSB repair. To clarify the role of ATM in mediating DNA-PKcs phosphorylation after IR, we show here that ATM is indeed the major contributor for IR-induced DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at the Thr-2609 cluster. Cell Culture and Treatments—Most of the cell lines were maintained in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin, including normal human skin fibroblasts and GM02052C ATM-deficient primary fibroblasts, SV40-transformed A-T (AT5BIVA) and wild-type (1BR3) fibroblasts, and Chinese hamster ovary wild-type (AA8) and DNA-PKcs-deficient (V3) cell lines. ATM-proficient (BT) and ATM-deficient (L3) human lymphoblastoid cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum as previously described (19Ye R. Bodero A.

Retroviral vector-mediated expression of small hairpin RNA against ATM was performed as previously described (20Biton S. Dar I. Mittelman L. Pereg Y. Barzilai A. Shiloh Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17482-17491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In brief, HeLa and MCF-7 cells were infected with previously 293T-packaged retroviral particles and selected with 10 μg/ml puromycin to achieve a stable cell line. The small hairpin green fluorescent protein plasmid was used as a control (20Biton S. Dar I. Mittelman L. Pereg Y. Barzilai A. Shiloh Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17482-17491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Cells subjected to ATM inhibitor Ku55933 (21Hickson I. Zhao Y. Richardson C.J. Green S.J. Martin N.M. Orr A.I. Reaper P.M. Jackson S.P. Curtin N.J. Smith G.C. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 9152-9159Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar) or DNA-PKcs inhibitor Nu7441 (22Leahy J.J. Golding B.T. Griffin R.J. Hardcastle I.R. Richardson C. Rigoreau L. Smith G.C. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2004; 14: 6083-6087Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) were pre-incubated with the drugs for 30–60 min prior to IR. The kinase inhibitors were gifts to Y. Shiloh from Kudos, Inc. and were gifts to D. Chen from Ryss Laboratory. Immunofluorescent Staining and Antibodies—Immunofluorescent staining was performed as previously described (7Chan D.W.

Anti-pS2056 and anti-pT2609 phosphospecific rabbit polyclonal antibodies were also described previously (7Chan D.W. Chen B.P. Prithivirajsingh S. Kurimasa A. Story M.D. Qin J. Chen D.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 10Chen B.P. Chan D.W. Kobayashi J. Burma S. Asaithamby A. Morotomi-Yano K. Botvinick E. Qin J. Chen D.J. J. Biol.

Anti-pT2647 was prepared by immunizing New Zealand White rabbits with keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated phosphopeptide AGQIRAT[PO3] QQQHDFC (Thr-2638) or QHDFTLT[PO3]Q-TADGRC (Thr-2647) and was affinity-purified through a phosphopeptide-conjugated Sepharose CL-4B column (Pierce). Anti-pS2612 and anti-pT2638 phosphospecific rabbit polyclonal antibodies were custom synthesized by Bethyl Laboratories. Anti-DNA-PKcs 25-4 monoclonal antibody (NeoMa-rkers) and anti-γH2AX monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) are commercially available. Clonogenic Survival and γH2AX Foci Analysis—Clonogenic survival was performed as previously described (7Chan D.W. Chen B.P. Prithivirajsingh S. Kurimasa A. Story M.D. Qin J. Chen D.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Analysis of γH2AX foci analysis was performed as previously described (23Rothkamm K. Lobrich M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5057-5062Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar). Laser Micro-irradiation—Laser micro-irradiation was carried out on a Zeiss Axiovert200 inverted microscope equipped with a MicroPoint laser system (Photonic Instruments, Inc.). In brief, MicroPoint laser (365 nm) was coupled directly to the epifluorescence path and was focused through a 63× objective to yield a spot size of ∼1 μm. The output of the laser was set at 60% to generate detectable foci of YFP-tagged DNA-PKcs in live cells. We have previously reported that IR-induced DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at Thr-2609 and Ser-2056 may be subjected to differential regulation due to their distinct kinetics and dosage response to IR (7Chan D.W. Chen B.P. Prithivirajsingh S. Kurimasa A. Story M.D. Qin J. Chen D.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 10Chen B.P. Chan D.W. Kobayashi J. Burma S.

Although DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation is responsible for IR-induced Ser-2056 phosphorylation (10Chen B.P. Chan D.W. Kobayashi J. Burma S. Asaithamby A. Morotomi-Yano K. Botvinick E. Qin J. Chen D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14709-14715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), our data suggest that ATM may be required for Thr-2609 phosphorylation, as IR-induced DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at Thr-2609 was significantly reduced in A-T fibroblasts as compared with that of ATM-complemented cells (7Chan D.W. Chen B.P. Prithivirajsingh S. Kurimasa A. Story M.D. Qin J. Chen D.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The possible role of ATM in mediating IR-induced Thr-2609 phosphorylation was further analyzed in SV40-transformed human fibroblast cell lines. Wild-type fibroblast cell line 1BR3 and A-T fibroblast cell line AT5 were subjected to 10 Gy of x-ray and were analyzed for IR-induced DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at Ser-2056 and Thr-2609. Western blotting analysis showed that IR-induced DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at Thr-2609 was significantly reduced in AT5 A-T fibroblasts, as compared with that of ATM-proficient 1BR3 cells, whereas phosphorylation at Ser-2056 was similarly robust in both cell lines (Fig. 1A). This is consistent with our report that IR-induced Ser-2056 phosphorylation results from DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation (10Chen B.P. Chan D.W. Kobayashi J. Burma S. Asaithamby A. Morotomi-Yano K. Botvinick E. Qin J. Chen D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14709-14715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). We also observed decreased IR-induced Thr-2609 nuclear foci in AT5 cells compared with 1BR3 cells (supplemental Fig. 1), suggesting that ATM is required for IR-induced DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at Thr-2609. In close proximity and downstream from Thr-2609, five additional phosphorylation sites were identified in in vitro autophosphorylated DNA-PKcs (8Douglas P. Sapkota G.P. Morrice N. Yu Y. Goodarzi A.A. Merkle D. Meek K. Alessi D.R. Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), four of which are in (S/T)Q motifs. Phosphorylation at these sites is also required for the function of DNA-PK in DSB repair, as alanine substitution at the entire Thr-2609 cluster of phosphorylation sites led to severe radiosensitivity and defective NHEJ (15Ding Q. Reddy Y.V. Wang W. Woods T. Douglas P. Ramsden D.A. Lees-Miller S.P. Meek K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5836-5848Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), whereas T2609A mutation alone only caused modest radiosensitivity (7Chan D.W. Chen B.P. Prithivirajsingh S. Kurimasa A. Story M.D. Qin J. Chen D.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). It is highly likely that phosphorylation at the other sites within the Thr-2609 cluster are being regulated in a similar fashion as Thr-2609 phosphorylation in vivo. This hypothesis is supported by analyzing DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at Thr-2647 (Fig. 1B). Using a phosphospecific antibody against Thr-2647, we noticed that IR also induces DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at this site. Similar to Thr-2609 phosphorylation, IR-induced DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at Thr-2647 is ATM-dependent as it was robust in 1BR3 cells and diminished in AT5 cells in either Western blotting (Fig. 1B) or immunofluorescent (supplemental Fig. 2) analyses. To examine whether ATM dependence is a general characteristic of the Thr-2609 cluster, IR-inducted phosphorylation of this cluster was further analyzed in ATM-proficient and -deficient primary skin fibroblasts and lymphoblastoid cell lines. The cells were irradiated with either 1 or 10 Gy of IR followed by Western blotting analysis of DNA-PKcs phosphorylations. DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at Ser-2056 could be consistently detected in all cell lines after 1 or 10 Gy of IR (Fig. 1, C and D). However, although the phosphorylation at Thr-2647 was detected in ATM-proficient cells (HSF and BT), it was markedly reduced and barely detectable after 10 Gy in ATM-deficient cells (Fig. 1, C and D, GM02052C and L3). The dependence of ATM to DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at the Thr-2609 cluster was also examined using the RNA interference approach to knock down the ATM expression (20Biton S. Dar I. Mittelman L. Pereg Y. Barzilai A. Shiloh Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17482-17491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) in HeLa and MCF7 cells. Stable expression of small hairpin RNA against ATM mRNA in HeLa cells drastically reduced the steady-state protein level of ATM as compared with that of control cells expressing small hairpin RNA against green fluorescent protein (Fig. 2A). Silencing ATM in HeLa cells led to considerable attenuation of IR-induced DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at Thr-2609 and Thr-2647, whereas DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation at Ser-2056 was not affected (Fig. 2A). Similarly, small hairpin RNA-mediated inhibition of ATM expression in MCF7 cells blocked IR-induced phosphorylation of Thr-2609 and Thr-2647 in these cells as well (Fig. 2B), suggesting that IR-induced DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at the Thr-2609 cluster is generally dependent on ATM but not on DNA-PKcs itself. To demonstrate that the kinase activity of DNA-PKcs is expendable for IR-induced DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at the Thr-2609 cluster, we analyzed DNA-PKcs phosphorylation in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) V3 cells complemented with wild-type DNA-PKcs or kinase-dead mutant DNA-PKcs. Yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fusion of wild-type DNA-PKcs (YFP-WT) and kinase-dead mutant (YFP-KD) were stably transfected into CHO V3 cells. Expression of YFP-WT (but not YFP-KD) restores the radioresistance phenotype into V3 cells, suggesting that YFP-WT fusion protein is functional in the NHEJ pathway for DSB repair. 4N. Uematsu and D. J. Chen, unpublished results. We have demonstrated previously that laser micro-irradiation induces DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at sites of localized laser damage (10Chen B.P. Chan D.W. Kobayashi J. Burma S. Asaithamby A. Morotomi-Yano K. Botvinick E. Qin J. Chen D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14709-14715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Using the YFP fusion approach coupled with laser micro-irradiation, we observed that both wild-type and kinase-dead mutant DNA-PKcs are rapidly accumulated at laser damage sites, indicating that the kinase activity of DNA-PKcs is not required for the initial accumulation of DNA-PKcs at damage sites (Fig. 3). However, the kinase activity of DNA-PKcs is required for Ser-2056 autophosphorylation upon laser micro-irradiation as Ser-2056 phosphorylation was diminished in V3 YFP-KD cells compared with that in V3 YFP-WT cells. In contrast, laser-induced DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at Thr-2609 and Thr-2647 remained detectable in V3 YFP-KD cells (Fig. 3B), confirming that the kinase activity of DNA-PKcs is expendable for the Thr-2609 cluster phosphorylation in vivo. Because both DNA-PKcs and ATM play important roles in radioresistance, several inhibitory small molecules have been recently developed to target specifically DNA-PKcs (22Leahy J.J. Golding B.T. Griffin R.J. Hardcastle I.R. Richardson C. Rigoreau L. Smith G.C. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2004; 14: 6083-6087Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) and ATM (21Hickson I. Zhao Y. Richardson C.J. Green S.J. Martin N.M. Orr A.I. Reaper P.M. Jackson S.P. Curtin N.J. Smith G.C. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 9152-9159Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar) and presumably serve as radiosensitizers for cancer radiotherapy. The role of ATM and DNA-PKcs in IR-induced Thr-2609 cluster phosphorylation was examined using these inhibitors to further confirm the role of ATM in mediating the phosphorylation at the Thr-2609 cluster. HeLa cells were incubated with either the ATM inhibitor Ku55933 (21Hickson I. Zhao Y. Richardson C.J. Green S.J. Martin N.M. Orr A.I. Reaper P.M. Jackson S.P. Curtin N.J. Smith G.C. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 9152-9159Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar) or the DNA-PKcs kinase inhibitor Nu7441 (22Leahy J.J. Golding B.T. Griffin R.J. Hardcastle I.R. Richardson C. Rigoreau L. Smith G.C. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2004; 14: 6083-6087Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) prior to IR and were subsequently analyzed for IR-induced DNA-PKcs phosphorylation using Western blotting analysis. As shown in Fig. 4A, the DNA-PKcs inhibitor Nu7441 specifically blocked DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation at Ser-2056 but not the phosphorylation at Thr-2609 and Thr-2647. Conversely, the ATM inhibitor Ku55933 blocked the phosphorylation at Thr-2609 and Thr-2647 but not autophosphorylation at Ser-2056 (Fig. 4A). In addition, we noticed that ATM inhibitor Ku55933 attenuated IR-induced DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at Thr-2612 and Thr-2638, which are included at the Thr-2609 cluster (Fig. 4B). The effect of Ku55933 and Nu7441 on DNA-PKcs phosphorylation was tested also after laser micro-irradiation. The results showed that Ku55933 preferentially blocks Thr-2609 phosphorylation, whereas Nu7441 preferentially blocks Ser-2056 phosphorylation (Fig. 4C), further confirming that ATM is the key kinase mediating DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at the Thr-2609 cluster in response to IR. It is likely that, in response to IR, phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs at Ser-2056 by itself and at the Thr-2609 cluster by ATM are both required for full activation of DNA-PKcs activity. Incomplete phosphorylation at either Ser-2056 or the Thr-2609 cluster may impair the NHEJ pathway of DSB repair. To test this hypothesis, we asked whether alanine substitutions at both the Thr-2609 cluster and Ser-2056 would further increase radiosensitivity and impair DSB repair. CHO V3 cells complemented with wild-type DNA-PKcs or various phosphomutants (Fig. 5A) were analyzed for clonogenic survival and kinetics of γH2AX foci formation after IR. In clonogenic survival analysis, we consistently observed increasing, although subtle, radiosensitivity in V3 cells complemented with the 7A mutant DNA-PKcs (alanine substitutions at both Ser-2056 and Thr-2609 cluster) as compared with that of V3 cells complemented with 6A mutant DNA-PKcs (alanine substitutions at Thr-2609 cluster alone) (Fig. 5B). The slight increase of radiosensitivity in 7A mutant was further analyzed in two more independent V3–7A lines and were compared with that of additional V3–6A mutant cell lines (supplemental Fig. 3B). Although the differences of radiosensitivity between the 6A and 7A cell lines are small, the result is reproducible and showed that 7A cell lines are slightly more radiosensitive than 6A cell lines. To further explore the difference of DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at Ser-2056 and Thr-2609 cluster in DSB repair, we analyzed the regression of γH2AX foci kinetics after IR (23Rothkamm K. Lobrich M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5057-5062Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar) in various V3-complemented cell lines. CHO V3-complemented cells were subjected to 1 Gy of IR. The cells were harvested at different time points and underwent immunofluorescent staining for γH2AX nuclear foci. The results showed that regression of IR-induced γH2AX foci in V3-2A cells (S2056A/T2609A) was slower than that of V3-S2056A or V3-T2609A cells (Fig. 5C). Additionally, the regression of γH2AX foci was also further attenuated in V3–7A cells as compared with that in V3–6A cells (Fig. 5C). This observation was repeated in additional independent V3–6A and V3–7A cell lines with similar results (supplemental Fig. 3C), indicating that DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at the Ser-2056 and Thr-2609 clusters contribute distinctively to radioresistance and DSB repair, and both are required for these processes. This also provides evidence that the coordination between DNA-PKcs- and ATM-mediated phosphorylation events is essential for the optimal DSB repair. Both ATM and DNA-PKcs are members of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related kinases (14Abraham R.T. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 25Shiloh Y. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar), and are the major kinases activated upon the induction of DNA double strand breaks. Defects in either ATM or DNA-PKcs kinase activity result in a radiosensitive phenotype. DNA-PKcs is known to play a direct role in DSB repair and is the key component of the NHEJ repair pathway, whereas ATM plays a key role in general damage signaling and cell cycle regulation (16Shiloh Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 402-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Evidence is emerging that ATM specifically plays an important role in the slow component of DSB repair (17Kuhne M. Riballo E. Rief N. Rothkamm K. Jeggo P.A. Lobrich M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 18Riballo E. Kuhne M. Rief N. Doherty A. Smith G.C. Recio M.J. Reis C. Dahm K. Fricke A. Krempler A. Parker A.R. Jackson S.P. Gennery A. Jeggo P.A. Lobrich M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 715-724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). This component of the DSB repair process may require both the ATM and the Artemis protein for mediating an end-processing step before the ends of DNA strands can be rejoined by NHEJ (17Kuhne M. Riballo E. Rief N. Rothkamm K. Jeggo P.A. Lobrich M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 18Riballo E. Kuhne M. Rief N. Doherty A. Smith G.C. Recio M.J. Reis C.

Here, we present further evidence for the involvement of ATM in DSB repair and direct cross-talk between ATM and DNA-PKcs. ATM is required for IR-induced DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at the Thr-2609 cluster (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4). Furthermore, ATM-mediated DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at the Thr-2609 cluster is critical for the radioresistance and DSB repair activities of DNA-PKcs. Our results demonstrate that alanine substitution at the entire Thr-2609 cluster of phosphorylation sites (6A mutant) or the Thr-2609 cluster together with Ser-2056 (7A mutant) lead to severe radiosensitivity and defective DSB repair (Fig. 5 and supplemental Fig. 3). A similar result was reported previously (15Ding Q. Reddy Y.V. Wang W. Woods T. Douglas P. Ramsden D.A. Lees-Miller S.P. Meek K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5836-5848Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The dominant negative effects of 6A and 7A mutants is likely because of their occupation at the broken DNA ends but failure to support or even to prevent DSB repair via NHEJ. This assertion is supported by our recent evidence that 6A or 7A mutants stay much longer at laser microirradiation-induced DSBs than wild-type DNA-PKcs.4 In contrast, in the absence of DNA-PKcs, DSBs could be repaired by homologous recombination or slowly by the residual activity of the NHEJ machinery. It is important to point out that, although the difference in clonogenic survival between the 6A and 7A mutants is small, it is consistently reproducible (Fig. 5 and supplemental Fig. 3). The difference between 6A and 7A mutants is also supported by γH2AX foci kinetics analysis showing that DSB repair activity in V3–7A cells is further reduced than that in V3–6A cells, suggesting that DNA-PKcs phosphorylation, mediated by ATM at the Thr-2609 cluster and by DNA-PKcs itself at Ser-2056, are both required for the optimal DSB repair activity after IR. As shown recently by Goodarzi et al. (26Goodarzi A.A. Yu Y. Riballo E. Douglas P. Walker S.A. Ye R. Harer C. Marchetti C. Morrice N. Jeggo P.A. Lees-Miller S.P. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3880-3889Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at the Thr-2609 cluster is required for facilitation of Artemis endonuclease activity. These two lines of evidence provide a mechanism for the direct involvement of ATM in DSB repair; ATM-mediated DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at the Thr-2609 cluster is required to stimulate the endonucleolytic activity of Artemis that trims otherwise non-ligatable DNA ends before they can be rejointed by NHEJ. Although the foci of DNA-PKcs phosphorylated at the Ser-2056 or Thr-2609 clusters overlap with γH2AX foci, which mark the damaged sites, alanine substitution at these putative phosphorylation sites does not affect the recruitment of DNA-PKcs to these sites.4 Instead, it is possible that DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at the Thr-2609 cluster creates a docking site for Artemis, enhancing its recruitment to DSBs, and the interaction between the phosphorylated Thr-2609 cluster and Artemis may stimulate Artemis endonucleolytic activity. In addition to the potential interaction with Artemis, DNA-PKcs phosphorylation at the Thr-2609 cluster might also serve as a docking site for molecules containing BRCA1 C-terminal or Forkhead-associated domains, which interact specifically with the phosphorylated (S/T)Q motif (27Manke I.A. Lowery D.M. Nguyen A. Yaffe M.B. Science. 2003; 302: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 28Yu X. Chini C.C. He M. Mer G. Chen J.

Biol. 2004; 24: 2779-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Similarly, we have also found that the protein phosphatase 5 (PP5) interacts with DNA-PKcs at the Thr-2609 cluster region (30Wechsler T. Chen B.P. Harper R. Morotomi-Yano K. Huang B.C. Meek K. Cleaver J.E. Chen D.J. Wabl M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1247-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The collaboration between ATM and DNA-PKcs may be essential for the proper initiation of DSB signaling (e.g. γH2AX formation) and the processing of detrimental DSBs to ensure proper repair and ultimately to preserve the genome integrity after DNA damage. Indeed, double knock-out of the genes encoding ATM and DNA-PKcs in mice is embryonically lethal (31Gurley K.E. Kemp C.J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 191-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The cross-talk between ATM and DNA-PKcs may not be limited to one direction, in which DNA-PKcs is phosphorylated by ATM. Notably, ATM expression is dependent on the activity of DNA-PKcs, as deficiency of DNA-PKcs results in down-regulation of ATM (24Peng Y. Woods R.G. Beamish H. Ye R. Lees-Miller S.P. Lavin M.F. Bedford J.S. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 1670-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). ATM and DNA-PKcs are key molecules in the response of mammalian cells to IR-induced DNA damage. The cross-talk between them is probably a central axis in this response. Download .pdf (.25 MB) Help with pdf files"

Double label immunofluorescence analysis of 3T3-L1 adipocytes indicated that PKA activation increases the translocation of hormonesensitive lipase (HSL) to perilipin A (Plin)-containing droplets and increases the colocalization of adipose tissue triglyceride lipase (Atgl) with its coactivator, Abhd5. Imaging of live 3T3-L1 preadipocytes transfected with Aquorea victoria-based fluorescent reporters demonstrated that HSL rapidly and specifically translocates to lipid droplets (LDs) containing Plin, and that this translocation is partially dependent on Plin phosphorylation. HSL closely, if not directly, interacts with Plin, as indicated by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) experiments. In contrast, tagged Atgl did not support FRET or BiFC with Plin, although it did modestly translocate to LDs upon stimulation. Abhd5 strongly interacted with Plin in the basal state, as indicated by FRET and BiFC. PKA activation rapidly (within minutes) decreased FRET between Abhd5 and Plin, and this decrease depended upon Plin phosphorylation. Together, these results indicate that Plin mediates hormone-stimulated lipolysis via direct and indirect mechanisms. Plin indirectly controls Atgl activity by regulating accessibility to its coactivator, Abhd5. In contrast, Plin directly regulates the access of HSL to substrate via close, if not direct, interactions. The differential interactions of HSL and Atgl with Plin and Abhd5 also explain the findings that following stimulation, HSL and Atgl are differentially enriched at specific LDs.

A central function of adipocytes is the storage and mobilization of energy in the form of triglyceride. A considerable amount is known about the enzymatic basis for lipogenesis and lipolysis; however, our understanding of how these processes are organized and regulated within cells is incomplete. Until recently, cellular triglyceride was considered to be stored in droplets lacking biological structure or organization. Growing evidence, however, suggests that lipid droplets are specialized, heterogeneous organelles that perform distinct roles in lipid biosynthesis, transport, and mobilization (1Brasaemle D.L.

A large number of proteins have been found to change their associations with lipid droplets in response to lipolytic stimulation. How these proteins are coordinated to control lipid storage and utilization remains largely unknown. It is well established that activation of cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA) 3The abbreviations used are: PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; Atgl, adipose tissue triglyceride lipase; Abhd5, Abhydrolase domain containing 5; BiFC, bimolecular fluorescence complementation; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; IBMX, 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine; LD, lipid droplet; Plin, perilipin. is the major signaling mechanism by which hormones and neurotransmitters stimulate lipolysis in adipocytes (4Honnor R.C.

Most work regarding hormone stimulated lipolysis has focused on perilipin (Plin), a protein that binds to the surface of certain lipid droplets (LDs), and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), which translocates to lipid during lipolytic activation. Plin is the major target for PKA-mediated phosphorylation in adipocytes (6Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Garty N.B. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J. Biol.

Plin was originally viewed as a physical barrier that passively regulated access of lipases to store triglyceride; however, more recent data indicates that Plin may function more as a LD scaffold that directs the trafficking of lipolytic proteins to a specialized subcellular domain (11Moore H.P.

Nonetheless, the temporal and spatial relationships between Plin and other proteins in the lipolytic pathway during PKA activation remain ill-defined. PKA activation promotes the translocation of HSL to lipid, which correlates with the magnitude of stimulated lipolysis (7Londos C. Brasaemle D.L. Schultz C.J. Adler-Wailes D.C. Levin D.M. Kimmel A.R.

It is presently unclear whether Plin and HSL interact directly, whether the interaction takes place on certain LDs and not others, or whether the interaction occurs on a timescale that is compatible with the initiation of lipolysis. The complexity of regulated lipolysis has recently expanded with the identification of adipose triglyceride lipase (Atgl) (14Villena J.A. Roy S. Sarkadi-Nagy E. Kim K.H. Sul H.S. J. Biol.

In contrast to HSL, relatively little is known about Atgl. Nonetheless, genetic deletion and knockdown experiments demonstrate that Atgl plays a critical role in basal and stimulated lipolysis (15Zimmermann R. Strauss J.G. Haemmerle G. Schoiswohl G.

Presently it is not known whether Atgl translocates to lipid in response to PKA activation, or if it is targeted to specific LDs. As mentioned, Abhd5 is a coactivator of Atgl that binds to Plin with high affinity. Furthermore, chronic (1 h) lipolytic stimulation leads to the dissociation of Abhd5 from Plin (16Subramanian V. Rothenberg A. Gomez C. Cohen A.W. Garcia A. Bhattacharyya S. Shapiro L. Dolios G. Wang R. Lisanti M.P. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol.

It is not known presently whether stimulation alters the interaction of Abhd5 and Plin on a timescale (i.e. minutes) that is relevant to the initiation of lipolysis, or whether the dissociation of Abhd5 from Plin is triggered by Plin phosphorylation. Nonetheless, these observations raise the possibility that PKA phosphorylation of Plin activates Atgl indirectly through its direct interactions with Abhd5. The above data strongly suggest that lipolysis involves the dynamic trafficking, yet relatively little is known about temporal and spatial relationships among scaffolds, lipases, and coactivators during stimulated lipolysis. Below we describe a series of experiments that explore for the first time the trafficking of lipolytic proteins, using double label immunocytochemistry of endogenous proteins and high resolution imaging of fluorescence reporters in living cells. The results of these experiments support the hypothesis that Plin acts as a scaffold that lies at the heart of PKA-regulated lipolysis. In vivo protein interaction assays indicate that Plin controls the association of HSL with specific LD surfaces via close, if not direct, interactions. In contrast, Plin does not directly interact with Atgl. Nonetheless, Plin is likely to control Atgl activity indirectly by rapidly releasing Abhd5 in a manner dependent on Plin phosphorylation. Because of the differential association of Atgl and HSL with Plin, these lipases can be targeted to distinct subcellular substrates following lipolytic activation. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were generated by growing preadipocytes on 25-mm glass coverslips until confluent, then incubating cells in differentiation medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, high glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin, and streptomycin supplemented with 0.25 μm dexamethasone, 0.5 mm 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine or IBMX, and 1 μg/ml insulin) for 3 days. The differentiation medium was replaced with growth medium supplemented with only insulin (1 μg/ml) and cultured for four more days. For fluorescent reporter assays, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were plated on glass coverslips and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum overnight. Cultures were transfected at about 60% confluency using Lipofectamine or Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen), as recommended by the manufacturer. Transfection efficiency was 10-20%. Following transfection, cells were incubated 1-2 days in growth medium supplemented with 100 μm oleic acid complexed to bovine serum albumin to facilitate formation of lipid droplets. All primary antibodies used were generated in rabbits. Therefore, to examine colocalization of two proteins in the same cell by immunofluorescence histochemistry we employed the procedure of Negoescu et al. (20Negoescu A. Labat-Moleur F. Lorimier P. Lamarcq L. Guillermet C. Chambaz E. Brambilla E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The key to this approach is the application of saturating levels of a monovalent secondary antibody when detecting the first antigen. Briefly, fixed cells were permeabilized with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% normal goat serum and 0.01% saponin (Permeabilization buffer) for 15 min, then were incubated for 50 min with primary antibodies against the first antigen (rabbit anti-HSL at 1:500 dilution, rabbit anti-Abhd5, 1:500, or affinity-purified rabbit anti-Atgl 1:300). The slides were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline over a 20-min period, then incubated for 1 h with 7.5 μg/ml Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Fab fragment (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA). The slides were washed as before, then incubated for 45 min with primary antibodies against the second antigen (rabbit anti-Plin at 1:1000 dilution or rabbit anti-Abhd5 1:500). The slides were again washed and incubated for 45 min with 2 μg/ml Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Fab)2 antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Washed slides were post-fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. All antibodies were diluted in Permeabilization buffer, and incubations were carried out at room temperature. For each pair of antibodies used, control experiments were performed in which one of the primary antibodies was omitted. In all cases, omission of the primary antibody eliminated fluorescent signals in the corresponding channel. Antibodies for HSL and Plin were as described (11Moore H.P. Silver R.B. Mottillo E.P.

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies for Atgl were generated against the peptide CNTVAFPPDALRMRAPAS coupled to keyhole limpet hemacyanin. Antibodies were then affinity-purified to the peptide. Atgl immunoreactivity was present in adipocytes, but not preadipocytes, and was eliminated by siRNA to Atgl (21Miyoshi H. Perfield II, J.W. Souza S.C. Shen W.J. Zhang H.H. Stancheva Z.S. Kraemer F.B.

ECFP was fused to the N terminus of HSL (11Moore H.P. Silver R.B. Mottillo E.P. Bernlohr D.A. Granneman J.G. J. Biol.

Atgl and Abhd5 were generated by PCR using plasmid (14Villena J.A. Roy S. Sarkadi-Nagy E. Kim K.H. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47066-47075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) or tissue cDNA. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) constructs were created with split fragments of EYFP, as detailed by Hu et al. (23Hu C.D. Kerppola T.K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). The N-terminal fragment, designated Yn, contained amino acids 1-158, while the C-terminal fragment, designated Yc, contained amino acids 155-239. For HSL, Atgl, and Abhd5, the Yn fragment was cloned on the N terminus using the AgeI and HindIII sites of the full-length constructs described above to form constructs designated Yn-X, where X is the protein tested for interactions. The Yn fragment contained the linker sequence GGGGSGGGGS on its C terminus. The Yc fragment was generated by PCR from a template supplied by Dr. T. Kerppola and was cloned into the AgeI/NotI of the Plin-EYFP construct to form Plin-Yc. This fragment included the amino acid linker KQKVMNH at the N terminus of Yc. For Atlg-Yc, Atgl was amplified by PCR and cloned into the HindIII/KpnI site of the Plin-Yc. Plin-Yn was generated by cloning the Yn fragment into the AgeI/NotI sites of Plin-Yc. Images were acquired with the Olympus IX-81 microscope equipped with automated filter controls and a spinning disc confocal unit. Images were captured using a 60× 1.2 NA apochromatic water immersion lens and a Hamamatsu ORCA cooled CCD camera. The following Chroma (Rockingham, VT) filter sets were used for the indicated fluorophores: Alexa 488, 410001; Cy3 and Nile red, 41002; EYFP, 31044; ECFP, 41028; EYFP FRET, exciter from 41028 and the dichroic/emitter from 31044. Microscope control and data acquisition was executed using IPlabs (Scanalytics, BD Biosciences) software. Immunofluorescence images of adipocytes were collected by placing a spacer ring, made of Parafilm, between a clean coverslip and the coverslip containing cells. The coverslips containing cells were inverted so that the top of the cells apposed the objective lens. This orientation allowed best optical resolution of large and small LDs. Optical sections were taken at 0.4 μm z-axis intervals beginning at the surface of the lipid droplets. For live cell imaging, coverslips containing transfected 3T3-L1 cells were placed in a Leiden chamber containing Krebs Ringer media (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 1 mm calcium chloride and 1% bovine serum albumin, and buffered with 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Experiments were conducted at room temperature (22o-26 °C). All cells imaged had similar levels of reporter gene expression. Images were captured at a rate of 1 per minute in confocal mode. Four baseline images were captured over 3 min, then cells were stimulated with a 10× concentration of forskolin and IBMX in buffer to yield a final concentration of 2 μm and 200 μm, respectively, and data were collected for 9 additional minutes. Double Label Immunofluorescence—Alexa 488 and Cy3 signals were merged and converted to 8 bit RGB images. Colocalization was performed using ImagePro Plus software (Media Cybernetics), with the analyst blind to the experimental conditions. The cell perimeter was outlined and Pearson’s regression coefficient determined for 2 adjacent confocal slices of each cell, which were averaged to yield one value per cell, which were averaged for presentation. Movement and Colocalization of Fluorescent Fusion Proteins—The aim of this experiment was to examine the translocation and colocalization of lipolytic proteins relative to cellular LDs. For this purpose, the subcellular region containing the largest area of LDs was outlined, and fluorescence intensity values of individual pixels in the ECFP and EYFP channels were indexed and imported into Graphpad software. Linear regression analyses were performed on indexed intensity values of the same LD region before stimulation and 8 min post-stimulation. The extent of colocalization was evaluated by Pearson’s r2, while the magnitude of translocation to LDs containing Plin-EYFP was assessed by the ratio of the regression slopes before and after stimulation. FRET—The experimental setup was identical to the translocation analysis just described. FRET was performed using the three filter method (24Gordon G.W. Berry G. Liang X.H. Levine B. Herman B. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2702-2713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar) and net FRET calculated using the FRET extension of IPlabs software. FRET signals were localized exclusively to LDs containing Plin-EYFP. To quantify the net FRET signals, the subcellular domain containing Plin-EYFP LDs was defined for each frame using the autosegmentation tool of IPlabs, and the calculated net FRET values of those pixels was summed for each frame. Values for each experiment were normalized to the maximal FRET values obtained for each cell. FRET constants were determined for each experimental day using 3T3-L1 cells transfected with single fluorescent constructs. For a given experimental day, all acquisition parameters were equivalent for all cells and all channels. The adequacy of the FRET constants in eliminating bleed-through was verified with independent singly transfected cells. FRET signals were only observed at LDs containing ECFP, and photobleaching of the acceptor eliminated the calculated net FRET signals. Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC)—3T3-L1 preadipocytes were grown on 18-mm coverslips and were transfected with 500 ng each of the complementary Yn and Yc fusion constructs, along with 130 ng of an ECFP tracer to identify transfected cells. Cells were cultured for 24 h at 32 °C in growth medium supplemented with oleic acid, then fixed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were examined using a 40× 0.9NA air objective by an observer that was blind to transfection conditions. Transfected cells were identified by ECFP fluorescence, and cells scored as to the presence or absence of EYFP fluorescence. The rate of false positives arising from cellular autofluorescence (i.e. background) was 2%. Statistical Analyses—Differences in colocalization coefficients, slope ratios, and total fluorescence were evaluated by one-way analysis of variance, and group means compared by Bonferroni’s test for multiple comparisons. BiFC efficiency was assessed by chi square. Double Label Immunohistochemistry of Endogenous Plin, Atgl, HSL, and Abhd5 in 3T3-L1 Adipocyte—We first investigated the subcellular colocalization of endogenous lipolytic proteins in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes under basal conditions, and after brief (10 min) lipolytic stimulation with forskolin and IBMX. Fig. 1 shows double-labeled immunofluorescence micrographs of representative adipocytes (left), and summarizes the colocalization analysis of >6 cells/group (right). As expected from previous work, Plin was targeted exclusively to LDs. In general, the surface of small LDs stained more intensely than larger LDs, and high resolution confocal images of the surface of larger droplets indicated relatively sparse and discontinuous Plin staining. Abhd5 was mostly localized to lipid droplets, with some cytosolic staining. Double label immunocytochemistry showed that Plin and Abhd5 proteins were highly colocalized on LDs, as expected from biochemical data showing that these proteins directly interact (16Subramanian V. Rothenberg A. Gomez C. Cohen A.W. Garcia A. Bhattacharyya S. Shapiro L. Dolios G. Wang R. Lisanti M.P. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 30490-30497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In the unstimulated state, HSL was largely cytosolic, whereas Atgl was found in the cytosol and on lipid droplets. Double label immunofluorescence indicated that HSL was weakly colocalized with Plin in unstimulated cells, whereas nearly half of Atgl fluorescence colocalized with Plin. Interestingly, Atgl and Plin appeared to be more strongly colocalized in the basal state than were Atgl and its co-activator, Abhd5. Following brief stimulation with forskolin and IBMX, HSL was targeted to small and medium sized lipid droplets, where it was significantly more colocalized with Plin than under basal conditions. Unlike HSL, stimulation did not alter the overall colocalization of Atgl and Plin. However, Atgl and Abhd5 became highly colocalized following acute stimulation, with much of the increase in colocalization occurring on very small structures. The increased colocalization of Atgl and Abhd5 occurred at the same time there was a small, but significant, decrease in the colocalization of Abhd5 with Plin. HSL and Atgl were partially colocalized in the cytoplasm before stimulation and on LDs after stimulation, and stimulation did not alter the overall degree of colocalization. As expected by the differential colocalization with Plin and Abhd5, numerous LDs were differentially enriched with one lipase after stimulation. The results of double label immunofluorescence are consistent with the hypothesis that HSL is specifically recruited to Plin-containing LDs. It appears that stimulation decreases the association of Abhd5 with Plin, while increasing its association with Atgl. Overall, it appears that stimulation increases the translocation of HSL to Plin-containing droplets and the interaction of Abhd5 and Atgl. The colocalization of Atgl and Abhd5 occurs at subcellular sites that may or may not contain Plin, and as a consequence of the differential association with Plin, Atgl, and HSL exhibit a distinct subcellular distribution following stimulation. Movement and Interactions of Fluorescently Tagged Proteins—Inferences about trafficking based on static immunofluorescence data rely on comparisons of different cells at different times. Furthermore, while changes in average colocalization strongly suggest trafficking, it does not provide information about the magnitude or timing of protein translocation, or whether translocation might occur in the absence of net changes in colocalization. To address these key questions, we generated a panel of fluorescent reporters for monitoring lipolytic protein trafficking and interactions in individual living cells. This approach not only allowed high spatial and temporal resolution of subcellular movement, but also permitted assessment of specific protein-protein interactions using the complementary techniques of FRET and BiFC. Stimulation Triggers Rapid Translocation of ECFP-HSL to Plin-EYFP-containing LDs—ECFP-HSL was largely cytosolic and rapidly translocated to Plin-EYFP containing LDs upon stimulation. Shown in Fig. 2 are confocal slices of a 3T3-L1 preadipocyte expressing ECFP-HSL before (panel A) and 8 min following stimulation (panel B) (video of translocation is provided in supplemental materials, Video S1). Following stimulation, the pattern of ECFP-HSL was nearly identical to Plin-EYFP (compare panels B and C). Plin-EYFP remained highly targeted to lipid droplets prior to and throughout stimulation. In over 50 independent experiments, we have not observed dissociation of Plin-EYFP from lipid droplets during acute (<15 min) stimulation. Quantification of the ECFP-HSL fluorescence at the lipid droplets showed that pronounced translocation that began within 2 min of stimulation and peaked by 7 min (panel D). The magnitude and specificity of translocation was assessed by correlating, pixel by pixel, the fluorescence intensities of ECFP-HSL and Plin-EYFP before (panel E) and after (panel F) stimulation.

https://openalex.org/W2153312362,"Mast seeding, the intermittent, synchronous production of large seed crops by a population of plants, is a well-known example of resource pulses that create lagged responses in successive trophic levels of ecological communities. These lags arise because seed predators are thought capable of increasing reproduction and population size only after the resource pulse is available for consumption. The resulting satiation of predators is a widely cited explanation for the evolution of masting. Our study shows that both American and Eurasian tree squirrels anticipate resource pulses and increase reproductive output before a masting event, thereby increasing population size in synchrony with the resource pulse and eliminating the population lag thought to be universal in resource pulse systems."

The organisms are minor components of all biofilms growing in pH 0.5 to 1.5 solutions within the Richmond Mine, California. Probes specific for 16 S rRNA showed that the fraction less than 0.45 micrometers in diameter is dominated by these organisms.

https://openalex.org/W2052344595,"A useful approach for exploring gene function involves generating mutant mice from genetically modified embryonic stem (ES) cells. Recent advances in genetic engineering of ES cells have shifted the bottleneck in this process to the generation of mice. Conventional injections of ES cells into blastocyst hosts produce F0 generation chimeras that are only partially derived from ES cells, requiring additional breeding to obtain mutant mice that can be phenotyped. The tetraploid complementation approach directly yields mice that are almost entirely derived from ES cells, but it is inefficient, works only with certain hybrid ES cell lines and suffers from nonspecific lethality and abnormalities, complicating phenotypic analyses. Here we show that laser-assisted injection of either inbred or hybrid ES cells into eight cell–stage embryos efficiently yields F0 generation mice that are fully ES cell–derived and healthy, exhibit 100% germline transmission and allow immediate phenotypic analysis, greatly accelerating gene function assignment."

Circannual rhythm generation is seen as the product of the interaction between melatonin-regulated timer cells and adjacent prolactin-secreting cells, which together function as an intrapituitary “pacemaker-slave” timer system.

https://openalex.org/W2057862712,"Vesicle transport is essential for the movement of proteins, lipids and other molecules between membrane compartments within the cell. The role of the class VI myosins in vesicular transport is particularly intriguing because they are the only class that has been shown to move 'backwards' towards the minus end of actin filaments. Myosin VI is found in distinct intracellular locations and implicated in processes such as endocytosis, exocytosis, maintenance of Golgi morphology and cell movement. We have shown that the carboxy-terminal tail is the key targeting region and have identified three binding sites: a WWY motif for Disabled-2 (Dab2) binding, a RRL motif for glucose-transporter binding protein (GIPC) and optineurin binding and a site that binds specifically and with high affinity (Kd = 0.3 microM) to PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing liposomes. This is the first demonstration that myosin VI binds lipid membranes. Lipid binding induces a large structural change in the myosin VI tail (31% increase in helicity) and when associated with lipid vesicles, it can dimerize. In vivo targeting and recruitment of myosin VI to clathrin-coated structures (CCSs) at the plasma membrane is mediated by Dab2 and PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding."

So far, no clear picture has emerged as to whether a protein channel is capable of transporting exclusively neutral NH3 while excluding H+ and NH+4. Our research is the first stoichiometric study to show the selective transport of NH3 by a membrane channel. The purified water channel protein aquaporin-8 was reconstituted into planar bilayers, and the exclusion of NH+4 or H+ was established by ensuring a lack of current under voltage clamp conditions. The single channel water permeability coefficient of 1.2 × 10–14 cm3/subunit/s was established by imposing an osmotic gradient across reconstituted planar bilayers, and resulting minute changes in ionic concentration close to the membrane surface were detected. It is more than 2-fold smaller than the single channel ammonia permeability (2.7 × 10–14 cm3/subunit/s) that was derived by establishing a transmembrane ammonium concentration gradient and measuring the resulting concentration increases adjacent to the membrane. This permeability ratio suggests that electrically silent ammonia transport may be the main function of AQP8.

Aquaporins (AQPs) 2The abbreviations used are: AQP, aquaporin; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. 2The abbreviations used are: AQP, aquaporin; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. are commonly believed to mediate fast and selective water transport (1King L.S. Kozono D. Agre P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). However, some members of the protein family may have other functions. The intracellular acid-sensing aquaporin-6 (AQP6), for example, serves as an anion channel (2Yasui M. Hazama A. Kwon T.H. Nielsen S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Nature. 1999; 402: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The function of aquaporin-8 (AQP8) is under dispute. First, it was suggested that AQP8-mediated water transport may be particularly important for the rapid expansion of mitochondrial volume (3Calamita G. Ferri D. Gena P. Liquori G.E. Cavalier A. Thomas D. Svelto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17149-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In a contrasting study, it was concluded that the rapid volume equilibration in mitochondria in response to an osmotic gradient was due to its small size (high surface-to-volume ratio) rather than to AQP-mediated high membrane water permeability (4Yang B. Zhao D. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16202-16206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Moreover, only mild phenotype differences between wild-type and AQP8-deficient mice were found (5Yang B. Song Y. Zhao D. Verkman A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C1161-C1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In addition, AQP8 was anticipated to participate in ammonia transport. AQP8 was able to rescue the growth of yeast defective in ammonium uptake, suggesting that the protein is involved in NH3 transport in humans. Increased acidification of the oocyte medium containing NH+4 was in accordance with NH3 diffusion through the protein (6Jahn T.P. Moller A.L.B. Zeuthen T. Holm L.M. Klaerke D.A. Mohsin B. Kuhlbrandt W. Schjoerring J.K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 574: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Voltage clamp experiments suggested that AQP8 conducts NH+4 as well (7Holm L.M. Jahn T.P. Moller A.L. Schjoerring J.K. Ferri D. Klaerke D.A. Zeuthen T. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2005; 450: 415-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Because growth complementation could be an indirect effect of AQP8 expression, light-scattering experiments with reconstituted vesicles were conducted. They revealed AQP8 permeability to formamide, suggesting that the protein may transport ammonium in vivo and physiologically contribute to the acid-base equilibrium (8Liu K. Nagase H. Huang C.G. Calamita G. Agre P. Biol. Cell. 2006; 98: 153-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, comparative phenotype studies in wild-type versus AQP8 null mice revealed no significant or only very small differences in serum ammonia, colonic ammonia absorption, renal ammonia clearance, and liver ammonia accumulation (9Yang B. Zhao D. Solenov E. Verkman A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: C417-C423Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It is difficult to interpret these results as evidence against physiologically significant AQP8-facilitated NH3 transport in mice. Because of the importance of ammonium homeostasis, several ammonium transport pathways are likely to exist. This is crucial for the urine pH adjustment and the acid-base equilibrium of body fluid. One of the alternative NH3 transport pathways was identified in terms of RhBG and RhCG, the non-erythroid members of the Rh family (10Nakhoul N.L. Dejong H. Abdulnour-Nakhoul S.M. Boulpaep E.L. Hering-Smith K. Hamm L.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: F170-F181Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These proteins were also knocked out in mice, and neither distal tubular acidosis nor hyperammonemia was detected (11Chambrey R. Goossens D. Quentin F. Eladari D. Transfus. Clin. Biol. 2006; 13: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The assumption that a double knock out of both AQP8 and Rh proteins leads to a detectable phenotype remains to be tested. This expectation is based on the observation that the apical membranes of AQP8-expressing cells must maintain large chemical and osmotic gradients and therefore be effectively impermeable to small molecules, including NH3 and water. Tightening of the lipid matrix and, thus, a reduced permeability is achieved by high concentrations of glycosphingolipids and sphingomyelin in the outer membrane leaflet (12Krylov A.V. Pohl P. Zeidel M.L. Hill W.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It is therefore not surprising that, for example, the expression of hepatic AQP8 was associated with apical microdomain fractions enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids (13Mazzone A. Tietz P. Jefferson J. Pagano R. Larusso N.F. Hepatology. 2006; 43: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). With respect to the low basal NH3 permeability of the epithelial membrane, the requirement for controllable proteinaceous NH3 transport machinery becomes obvious. AQP8 is the ideal candidate because it is largely localized in intracellular vesicles and can be redistributed to plasma membranes via a microtubule-dependent, cAMP-stimulated mechanism (14Garcia F. Kierbel A. Larocca M.C. Gradilone S.A. Splinter P. La-Russo N.F. Marinelli R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12147-12152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism for ammonia transport by AQP8 has not yet been resolved. Evidence was reported showing both NH3 and NH+4 transport (7Holm L.M. Jahn T.P. Moller A.L. Schjoerring J.K. Ferri D. Klaerke D.A. Zeuthen T. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2005; 450: 415-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), although it was not possible to differentiate whether NH+4 transport occurred through the aquaporin itself or whether secondary effects related to rapid NH3 transport took place. We have addressed this question by reconstituting purified AQP8 into planar lipid bilayers mimicking the lipid composition of epithelial plasma membranes. Functional reconstitution was confirmed by water flux measurements. Simultaneous ion and ammonia flux measurements revealed perfect NH3 selectivity, i.e. ammonia transport by AQP8 is electrically silent. We found that ammonia permeability exceeds water permeability 2-fold, suggesting that ammonia transport may be the main function of AQP8. Expression and Purification of AQP8 from Yeast—Rat AQP8 was expressed in pep4Δ Saccharomyces cerevisiae and purified as previously described (8Liu K. Nagase H. Huang C.G. Calamita G. Agre P. Biol. Cell. 2006; 98: 153-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, after induction with 2% (w/w) galactose harvested by centrifugation, and three French press cycles, the membrane fraction was recovered from the supernatant by ultracentrifugation. AQP8 protein was solubilized in n-octyl-β-d-glucoside. The His10-tagged protein was absorbed by a nickel column. Its purity was better than 90% as revealed by the comparison of Coomassie-stained SDS gels with bands obtained by immunoblotting. Protein Reconstitution into Planar Bilayers—Purified AQP8 proteins were first reconstituted into proteoliposomes by dialysis (15Saparov S.M. Kozono D. Rothe U. Agre P. Pohl P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31515-31520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In brief, the reconstitution mixture was prepared at room temperature by sequentially adding 100 mm MOPS-sodium, pH 7.5 (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland), 1.25% (w/v) octyl glucoside, purified AQP8 (final concentration 0.5–1 mg/ml), and 20–50 mg/ml of preformed lipid vesicles. The latter consisted of a 3:2:1 molar mixture of cholesterol, E. coli lipid extract (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL), and sphingomyelin. It was loaded into SPECTRA/POR 2.1 dialysis tubing, molecular weight cut-off 15,000 (Spectrum Laboratories, Laguna Hills, CA), and dialyzed against 100 volumes of assay buffer for 48 h at 4 °C. Proteoliposomes were harvested by ultracentrifugation (60 min at 100,000 × g) and were resuspended into assay buffer (compare Fig. 1) at a concentration of 5–10 mg/ml. At the air-water interface of vesicle suspensions, monolayers were formed spontaneously (16Montal M. Darszon A. Schindler H. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1981; 14: 1-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Two such monolayers were combined to form a planar bilayer in the 150-μm-diameter aperture of a 25-μm-thick polytetrafluoroethylene septum separating the two aqueous phases of the chamber (15Saparov S.M. Kozono D. Rothe U. Agre P. Pohl P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31515-31520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 17Pohl P. Saparov S.M. Borgnia M.J. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9624-9629Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The septum was pretreated with a hexadecane-hexane mixture (volume ratio of 1:200). Water Flux Measurements—Transmembrane osmotic water flow was derived from solute dilution in the immediate membrane vicinity (18Pohl P. Saparov S.M. Antonenko Y.N. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1711-1718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The solute concentration at the interface, Cs, increases with the distance, x, to the membrane: C(x) = Cs exp(–vx/D + bx3/3D), where –v and b are – the linear drift velocity of the osmotic volume flow and the stirring parameter, respectively. In the steady state, v was obtained by fitting the concentration distribution of Na+ ions to this equation. v is related to Pf by Pf = v/(Cosm Vw) (19Finkelstein A. Water Movement through Lipid Bilayers, Pores, and Plasma Membranes. 1987; (Wiley & Sons, New York): 10-41Google Scholar). Jw is the product of water concentration and v. Na+ concentrations were measured by microelectrodes made of glass capillaries, the tips (1–2 μm in diameter) of which were filled with mixture A of Sodium Ionophore I (Fluka, Dreisenhofen, Germany). Movement of the electrodes relative to the membrane was realized by a hydraulic stepdrive (Narishige). Ion Flux Measurements—Ag/AgCl reference electrodes were immersed into the buffer solutions at both sides of the planar bilayers. Under voltage clamp conditions, the transmembrane current was measured by a patch clamp amplifier (model EPC9; HEKA Electronics). The recording filter was a 4-pole Bessel with 3-dB corner frequency of 0.1 kHz. The acquired raw data were analyzed with the help of the TAC software package (Bruxton Corp., Seattle, WA). A Gaussian filter of 0.3 Hz was applied to reduce noise. Ammonia Flux Measurements—Ammonium chloride was added to the buffer solutions surrounding the bilayer. Its concentration at the cis side of the membrane was higher than at the trans side. The resulting transmembrane NH3 flux gave rise to a pH and a NH+4 gradient in the immediate membrane vicinity. The latter was measured in terms of a potential difference between a selective microelectrode and a reference electrode, both placed in the buffer solution at the same side of the membrane (20Antonenko Y.N.

Movement of the electrodes relative to the membrane was realized by a hydraulic stepdrive (Narishige). Theoretical Model for NH3 Transport—In the model, the membrane flux of NH+4 is neglected. This assumption is justified by the lack of any incremental conductivity after AQP8 reconstitution (Fig. 2). For acidic pH the experimental results are analyzed precisely by solving the complete system of differential equations that takes into account all relevant chemical reactions in the immediate membrane vicinity (20Antonenko Y.N.

The numerical solutions are derived, assuming that the rates of chemical reactions (like dissociation/recombination of water, buffer, and NH3) are very high compared with the rate of diffusion through the USL, so that the local chemical equilibrium is maintained. To demonstrate functional reconstitution, we measured osmotic water flow through purified AQP8 channels by imposing an osmotic gradient across reconstituted planar bilayers and detected resulting minute changes in ionic concentration close to the membrane surface (15Saparov S.M. Kozono D. Rothe U. Agre P. Pohl P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31515-31520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 17Pohl P. Saparov S.M. Borgnia M.J. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9624-9629Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We formed planar membranes that mimicked the composition of epithelial cells (cholesterol:E. coli lipid extract:sphingomyelin = 3:2:1). In line with previous experiments (12Krylov A.V. Pohl P. Zeidel M.L. Hill W.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), these membranes exhibited a very low osmotic water permeability, Pf, of only (11.0 ± 1.5) μm/s. Reconstitution of AQP8 at lipid:protein mass ratio, rm = 100, resulted in a 3-fold increase in Pf (Fig. 1). The incremental water permeability, Pf.c, allowed calculation of the hydraulic permeability coefficient of a single channel, pf, from the absolute hydraulic conductivity of all channels Pf.c and the number of channels, n (19Finkelstein A. Water Movement through Lipid Bilayers, Pores, and Plasma Membranes. 1987; (Wiley & Sons, New York): 10-41Google Scholar). n is anticipated to be equal to the total number of lipid molecules, L, in the bilayer divided by the molar lipid to protein ratio, r, where L is derived from two times (for both leaflets) the membrane area, A, divided by the area, b, per lipid molecule as shown in Equation 4 Pf = Pf.c A/n = Pf.c Ar/2L = Pf.c brmMP/2ML Eq. 4 where MP and ML are the molecular masses of the protein (30 kDa) and the lipid (700 Da), respectively. For b = 70 A2, pf of AQP8 is found to be (2.4 ± 0.2) × 10–14 cm3 subunit–1 s–1. The result was obtained assuming that protein incorporation is 100% efficient. The real efficiency is, most probably, smaller. Reconstitution of AQP0, for example, was ∼50% efficient (22Zampighi G.A. Hall J.E. Kreman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8468-8472Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). If our value is in the same range, pf adopts a value of ∼(1.2 ± 0.1) × 10–14 cm3 subunit–1 s–1. That is in reasonable agreement with results reported previously using a Xenopus oocyte expression system (23Ma T. Yang B. Verkman A.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 324-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). pf allows calculation of the AQP8 turnover numbers for water, TW as shown in Equation 5 Tw = NApf/Vw = 4·108s-1 Eq. 5 where NA and VW are the Avogadro number and the molecular volume of water, respectively. Demonstration of functional reconstitution was followed by probing NH+4 transport through AQP8. A hundredfold augmentation of the NH4Cl bulk concentration did not alter the current voltage characteristics of bare lipid bilayers or membranes reconstituted with AQP8 (Fig. 2). The similarity of ion conductivities indicated that AQP8 excluded NH+4 ions. Even if the entire conductivity of G = 5 nS cm–2 were attributed to the protein, the total ion flux, jion, did not exceed 10–15 mol cm–2 s–1 as calculated according to Equation 6. Jion=RTz2F2GEq. 6 Consequently, the ion:water selectivity was better than 1:109 (compare Refs. 17Pohl P. Saparov S.M. Borgnia M.J. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9624-9629Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 24Saparov S.M. Tsunoda S.P. Pohl P. Biol. Cell. 2005; 97: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Subsequently, transport of neutral NH3 molecules by AQP8 was tested. At acidic pH, a transmembrane NH3 flux, JMNH3, was expected to give rise to a NH+4 flux through the near-membrane aqueous stagnant layers (20Antonenko Y.N. Pohl P. Denisov G.A. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2187-2195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) as shown in Equations 7 and 8. JNH3M=-DNH3d[NH3]dx-DNH4+d[NH4+dxEq. 7 JNH3M=-DNH4+d[NH4+]dx(1+α)Eq. 8 DNH3, DNH4+, and x are the aqueous diffusion coefficients of NH3, NH+4, and the distance to the membrane, respectively. α is equal to 10(pH – p K). A NH+4 concentration gradient was imposed across the planar bilayer, and the resulting small changes in NH+4 concentration close to the membrane were detected by scanning ammonia-selective microelectrodes. The difference in NH+4 polarization adjacent to bare (Fig. 3A) and reconstituted planar bilayers (Fig. 3B) indicated NH3 transport by aquaporins. Plotting JMNH3 versus the NH+4 transmembrane concentration gradient reveals a linear dependence (Fig. 3C). Calculation of PJNH3 was performed taking into account the accompanying chemical reactions of ammonia and buffer. The set of differential equations (see “Experimental Procedures”) was solved numerically to fit the experimental profiles for 0 < × <50 μm (20Antonenko Y.N. Pohl P. Denisov G.A. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2187-2195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 21Antonenko Y.N. Denisov G.A. Pohl P. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 1701-1710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). NH3 permeabilities of 16 and 105 μm/s were computed for bare and AQP8-containing bilayers, respectively. Protein inhibition by Hg2+ was testable, although the ammonia-selective microelectrode was less sensitive in the presence of Hg2+ (a 10-fold change in NH+4 concentration corresponded to a change in microelectrode potential of only 27 mV instead of the usually measured 52 mV). In the particular experiment shown in Fig. 4, Hg2+ reduced the transmembrane NH3 flux from 0.2 to 0.06 nmol cm–2 s–1. Thus, the NH3 permeability of the planar bilayer reconstituted with AQP8 decreased from 50 to 15 μm/s, indicating complete AQP8 inhibition. For further proof of NH3 conductance by AQP8, flux dependence on membrane protein abundance was measured. Reconstitution of increasing amounts of AQP8 was accompanied by an increasing NH+4 concentration polarization in the immediate membrane vicinity (Fig. 5). As before, the set of differential equations (see “Experimental Procedures”) was solved numerically for different PMNH3. For each AQP8 concentration the parameter was changed iteratively until the deviation of the theoretical profile from the experimental one was minimal. Plotting PMNH3 as a function of 1/rm allowed calculation of single channel ammonium permeability (Fig. 5, inset) as shown in Equation 9 pNH3=PNH3,cA/n=PNH3,cbrmMp/2MLEq. 9 where PNH3,c is the incremental NH3 permeability introduced by AQP8 reconstitution. Assuming 50% reconstitution efficiency pNH3 was equal to (2.7 ± 0.2) × 10–14 cm3 subunit–1 s–1 and, thus, 2-fold higher than the respective single channel coefficient for water. The number of neutral ammonia molecules, TNH3, transported by AQP8 per second can be assessed by calculation of the turnover number per channel as shown in Equation 10 TNH3=NApNH3/VNH3=7.7⋅105s-1Eq. 10 where NA and VNH3 are the Avogadro number and the molecular volume of NH3, respectively. We have shown that AQP8 transports both water and ammonia very efficiently. Reconstitution of the purified protein increased the respective permeabilities of model membranes mimicking apical membranes of epithelial cells up to 3- or 6-fold. As most members of the aquaporin family (25Nielsen S. Frokiaer J. Marples D. Kwon T.H. Agre P. Knepper M.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 205-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar, 26Pohl P. Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), AQP8 prevents ions from passing the channel, i.e. it allows exclusive transport of the neutral NH3 molecule. This observation contrasts with the proposed NH+4 permeability of AQP8 made in the Xenopus oocyte expression system (7Holm L.M. Jahn T.P. Moller A.L. Schjoerring J.K. Ferri D. Klaerke D.A. Zeuthen T. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2005; 450: 415-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). However, the ion fluxes detected in the oocyte system are not necessarily NH+4 fluxes. They may also represent endogenous pH-sensitive currents of the oocyte. Because NH3 acidifies the aqueous solution it leaves behind and augments the pH in the solution it enters (20Antonenko Y.N. Pohl P. Denisov G.A. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2187-2195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), a transmembrane proton gradient builds up that gives rise to proton and counterion currents, provided that the membrane is permeable to these charged species. Subtracting the membrane permeability of non-transfected oocytes may be misleading because the expression of integral membrane proteins may modify ion channels endogenous to Xenopus oocytes (27Shimbo K. Brassard D.L. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1819-1829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Because reconstituted planar bilayers lack these disadvantages and because their extremely low intrinsic proton (24Saparov S.M. Tsunoda S.P. Pohl P. Biol. Cell. 2005; 97: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and ion permeabilities (15Saparov S.M. Kozono D. Rothe U. Agre P. Pohl P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31515-31520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 17Pohl P. Saparov S.M. Borgnia M.J. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9624-9629Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) are not altered by AQP8, it is concluded that the protein excludes NH+4. AQP8 transports ammonia very efficiently. With ∼8 × 105 substrate molecules/s/channel (Equation 10), TNH3 of AQP8 is comparable with the respective number of 2 × 106 estimated for the human rhesus-associated glycoprotein (28Ripoche P. Bertrand O. Gane P. Birkennmeier C. Colin Y. Cartron J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17222-17227Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Because the physiological NH3 concentration is orders of magnitude smaller than the concentration of H2O, the NH3 conduction rate need not be as high as that of H2O to match diffusion limited rates for arriving at the pore (29Winkler F.K. Pflugers. Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2006; 451: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In agreement with this prediction, we have obtained a 500-fold higher TW (Equation 5). Comparison of the actual single channel permeability coefficients reveals, in contrast, a preference for NH3 over H2O as shown in Equation 11. pf/pNH3=1.2/2.7≅1/2Eq. 11 Because of their larger molecular volume (VNH3 ≫ VW), the channel accommodates less gas than water molecules. Thus, albeit their higher transport velocity, AQP8 transports less NH3 molecules than water molecules. It should be noted that the actual velocity of water transport may be underestimated because it was derived assuming that the pores are densely packed with water. In single file transport, the density of water inside the channel may be lower than in bulk (30Saparov S.M. Pohl P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4805-4809Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 31Saparov S.M. Pfeifer J.R. Al-Momani L. Portella G. de Groot B.L. Koert U. Pohl P. Phys. Rev. Lett. 2006; 96: 148101Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Molecular dynamics simulations support the view that liquid-vapor oscillations occur in the channel (32Beckstein O. Sansom M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7063-7068Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 33Hummer G. Rasaiah J.C. Noworyta J.P. Nature. 2001; 414: 188-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2869) Google Scholar). Equation 11 reveals a preference for ammonia over water. This result conflicts with a cell culture study in which the fluorescence of the pH-sensing yellow fluorescent protein was used to assess rat or mouse AQP8 ammonia permeability. The reason for the reported extremely low AQP8 single channel NH3-to-water permeability of only 0.03 (9Yang B. Zhao D. Solenov E. Verkman A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: C417-C423Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar) is not clear. However, it is likely that the kinetics of pH changes are, at least in part, determined by compensatory transport events aimed to maintain cellular pH. Calculating PNH3 from the time course of pH changes alone (9Yang B. Zhao D. Solenov E. Verkman A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: C417-C423Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar) should be hampered (i) by passive fluxes of CO2 and H+ through the plasma membrane as well as (ii) by different types of pH-regulating transporters, like cation-H+ exchangers, HCO¯3 transporters, and H+-ATPases, and (iii) proton exchange with intracellular compartments such as mitochondria and lysosomes. Lacking the entire list of uncertainties, reconstituted bilayers offer the opportunity to measure NH3 flux directly. The only uncertainty of the bilayer system is that the reconstituted protein may adopt a slightly different quaternary structure. At least for the aqueous pore of the AQP8 monomer, which is the channel path for water and ammonia, this can be ruled out by the perfect match between the pf values of the reconstituted protein and the one in an expression system (23Ma T. Yang B. Verkman A.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 324-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Theoretically, there is still a possibility that transport of charged species occurs through a putative fifth pore in the center of the aquaporin tetramer. It is rather unlikely in AQP8 because (i) so far ion channel activity has been ascribed only to AQP1 (34Yool A.J. Weinstein A.M. News Physiol. Sci. 2002; 17: 68-72PubMed Google Scholar), (ii) nonphysiologically high cGMP concentrations (1 mm) are required (35Boassa D. Stamer W.D. Yool A.J. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7811-7819Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and (iii) ion channel activity was not reproduced by a variety of laboratories (36Agre P. Lee M.D. Devidas S. Guggino W.B. Sasaki S. Uchida S. Kuwahara M. Fushimi K. Marumo F. Verkman A.S. Yang B. Deen P.M.T. Mulders S.M. Kansen S.M. van Os C.H.

Chem. 2004; 279: 11364-11367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). AQP8 is the first ammonia-transporting channel for which the exclusion of NH+4 has been shown. The net transport of NH3 across the plasma membrane by kidney Rh glycoproteins RhBG and RhCG results from an exchange of NH+4 for H+ (38Mak D-O. D. Dang B. Weiner I.D. Foskett J.K. Westhoff C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: F297-F305Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism for AQP8 can be ruled out because the estimated upper limit of NH+4 H+ fluxes of 1 × 10–15 mol cm–2 s–1 is negligible compared with the ammonia flux of ∼0.4 nmol cm–2 s–1 (Equation 6). NH3/H+ cotransport or NH+4 transport as proposed for AMT-1 from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Archaeglobus fulgidus (39Andrade S.L. Dickmanns A. Ficner R. Einsle O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14994-14999Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) or the plant ammonium transporters LeAMT1 (40Ludewig U. von Wiren N. Frommer W.B. J. Biol.

Dynowski M. Ludewig U. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) indicate a transporting mechanism that contrasts with AQP8. A transport mechanism much closer to AQP8 has been proposed for AmtB from E. coli. Mainly based on structural considerations (43Khademi S. O'Connell J. II I Remis J. Robles-Colmenares Y. Miercke L.J. Stroud R.M. Science. 2004; 305: 1587-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 44Zheng L. Kostrewa D. Berneche S. Winkler F.K. Li X.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Soc. 2006; 128: 10876-10884Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), NH3 selectivity was suggested. However, occasional passage of NH+4 or H+ was not excluded. It would be stabilized by ring currents of the rich aromatic environment at the constriction zone using the acid/base properties of the imidazole nitrogens to assist in proton transfer (43Khademi S. O'Connell J. II I Remis J. Robles-Colmenares Y. Miercke L.J. Stroud R.M. Science. 2004; 305: 1587-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). The authors concluded that a stoichiometric measure of conductance of neutral and charged species is required to establish whether ion conductance takes place, a study we now have carried out for AQP8. Summarizing, AQP8 exhibits a preference for neutral NH3 molecules over water, suggesting a physiological role in maintenance of acid-base equilibrium. In physiological concentrations AQP8 may augment the basal NH3 conductivity 3- to 5-fold. We thank Quentina Beatty for critically reading the manuscript."

Dysferlin is proposed to play a role in muscle membrane repair. To gain functional insight into the molecular mechanisms of dysferlin, we have searched for dysferlin-interacting proteins in skeletal muscle. By coimmunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that AHNAK interacts with dysferlin. We defined the binding sites in dysferlin and AHNAK as the C2A domain in dysferlin and the carboxyterminal domain of AHNAK by glutathione S-transferase (GST)-pull down assays. As expected, the N-terminal domain of myoferlin also interacts with the carboxyterminal domain of AHNAK. In normal skeletal muscle, dysferlin and AHNAK colocalize at the sarcolemmal membrane and T-tubules. In dysferlinopathies, reduction or absence of dysferlin correlates with a secondary muscle-specific loss of AHNAK. Moreover, in regenerating rat muscle, dysferlin and AHNAK showed a marked increase and cytoplasmic localization, consistent with the direct interaction between them. Our data suggest that dysferlin participates in the recruitment and stabilization of AHNAK to the sarcolemma and that AHNAK plays a role in dysferlin membrane repair process. It may also have significant implications for understanding the biology of AHNAK-containing exocytotic vesicles, ""enlargosomes,"" in plasma membrane remodeling and repair."

Previously, we demonstrated that partial inhibition of oxidosqualene:lanosterol cyclase (OSC) stimulated synthesis of the LXR agonist 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol (24(S),25-epoxy) and enhanced ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux. In contrast to a synthetic, nonsteroidal LXR activator, TO-901317, triglyceride accumulation was not observed. In the present study, we determined whether endogenous 24(S),25-epoxy synthesis selectively enhanced expression of macrophage LXR-regulated cholesterol efflux genes but not genes that regulate fatty acid metabolism. THP-1 human macrophages incubated with the OSC inhibitor (OSCi) RO0714565 (15 nm) significantly reduced cholesterol synthesis and maximized synthesis of 24(S),25-epoxy. Endogenous 24(S),25-epoxy increased ABCA1, ABCG1, and APOE mRNA abundance and consequently increased cholesterol efflux to apoAI. In contrast, OSCi had no effect on LXR-regulated genes LPL (lipoprotein lipase) and FAS (fatty acid synthase). TO-901317 (≥10 nm) significantly enhanced expression of all genes examined. OSCi and TO-901317 increased the mRNA and precursor form of SREBP-1c, a major regulator of fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis. However, conversion of the precursor to the active form (nSREBP-1c) was blocked by OSCi-induced 24(S),25-epoxy but not by TO-901317 (≥10 nm), which instead markedly increased nSREBP-1c. Disruption of nSREBP-1c formation by 24(S),25-epoxy accounted for diminished FAS and LPL expression.

These include ABCA1 (ATP-binding cassette A1), ABCG1, and APOE (apolipoprotein E), which mediate cellular cholesterol efflux from human and mouse macrophages to extracellular acceptors (3Tontonoz P. Mangelsdorf D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Additionally, activated LXR increases expression of SREBP-1c (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c), FAS (fatty acid synthase), and LPL (lipoprotein lipase), which together act to stimulate cellular free fatty acid synthesis and free fatty acid uptake, respectively, leading to enhanced triglyceride synthesis (4Yoshikawa T.

Although the precise underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, reduction in macrophage foam cell formation by enhancing cholesterol efflux probably plays a significant role.

Lipogenesis and triglyceride accumulation is enhanced by highly potent synthetic LXR agonists that up-regulate expression of SREBP-1c and consequently such downstream genes as FAS and LPL, which, in addition to LXREs, contain sterol response elements (SREs) in their promoter regions (7Schoonjans K.

Selective activation of LXR-regulated genes involved in macrophage cholesterol efflux and ultimately separation of the two LXR-regulated metabolic pathways of cholesterol efflux and triglyceride accumulation represents a potential mechanism for the attenuation of macrophage foam cell formation. The discovery of endogenously produced oxysterols, such as 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol (24(S),25-epoxy), as potent, naturally occurring LXR-agonists (17Lehmann J.M. Kliewer S.A. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Oliver B.B. Su J.L. Sundseth S.S. Winegar D.A. Blanchard D.E. Spencer T.A. Willson T.M. J. Biol.

Mangelsdorf D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Partial inhibition of 2,3-oxidosqualene:lanosterol cyclase (OSC), a cholesterol biosynthesis enzyme downstream of the statin target hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, has been shown to substantially reduce cholesterol synthesis while simultaneously maximizing 24(S),25-epoxy synthesis (reviewed in Ref. 18Huff M.W. Telford D.E. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 335-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Previously, we demonstrated that inhibition of OSC by RO0714565 at a dose that maximizes 24(S),25-epoxy synthesis enhanced cholesterol efflux from cultured mouse macrophages, an effect associated with an LXR-induced increase in the expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1. In contrast to the synthetic, nonsteroidal LXR agonist TO-901317, OSC inhibition did not lead to an accumulation of cellular triglycerides, possibly due to the lack of increase in nuclear SREBP-1 (nSREBP-1) (19Rowe A.H. Argmann C.A. Edwards J.Y. Sawyez C.G. Morand O.H. Hegele R.A. Huff M.W. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanism for this effect was not determined. In the present study, we hypothesized that enhanced synthesis of 24(S),25-epoxy within a physiologically relevant range would lead to functionally significant increases in the expression of LXR-regulated genes ABCA1, ABCG1, and APOE and thus cholesterol efflux, whereas FAS, LPL, and SREBP-1c would be relatively unaffected. Human THP-1 macrophages were exposed to an OSC inhibitor (OSCi) at a dose that maximizes endogenous 24(S),25-epoxy synthesis. ABCA1, ABCG1, and APOE expression were increased, as was cholesterol efflux. However, expression of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, FAS and LPL, was not increased; nor was there an increase in fatty acid synthesis, triglyceride synthesis, or LPL activity. Furthermore, OSCi-induced 24(S),25-epoxy or exogenously added 24(S),25-epoxy increased SREBP-1c mRNA and precursor SREBP-1 (pSREBP-1). However, unlike higher concentrations of TO-901317, the OSCi-induced 24(S),25-epoxy or exogenous 24(S),25-epoxy blocked conversion of the inactive pSREBP-1 to its active nuclear form, which probably accounts for the absence of enhanced FAS and LPL gene expression. Cell Culture and Reagents—The human THP-1 macrophage-like cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). For experiments, cells were cultured at 4.0 × 106 cells/35-mm plate (Falcon Scientific, BD Biosciences) or 3.0 × 107 cells/100-mm plate in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), β-mercaptoethanol (5 × 10–5 m), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and differentiated with 300 nm phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDB) for 1 week prior to use in experiments as described (20Argmann C.A.

The OSCi designated as RO0714565 with an IC50 of 5 nm for human liver microsomal OSC activity was provided by J. Aebi (F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG (Pharmaceuticals Division, Basal, Switzerland)) and dissolved in Me2SO. In some experiments, cells were incubated with exogenous 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OH) (Sigma), 24(S),25-epoxy, or 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (22(R)-OH) (Steraloids Inc., Newport, RI) dissolved in 100% ethanol or the synthetic, nonsteroidal LXR ligand TO-901317 (Sigma) dissolved in Me2SO. LDL was isolated from normal human subjects by differential ultracentrifugation and acetylated (acLDL) using acetic anhydride as described (21Goldstein J.L. Ho Y.K. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar), and the extent of modification was confirmed by alterations in electrophoretic mobility (22Whitman S.C. Miller D.B. Wolfe B.M. Hegele R.A. Huff M.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1707-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Cellular Analyses—To examine cellular 24(S),25-epoxy and cholesterol synthesis, THP-1 cells were incubated for 24 h in RPMI 1640 with 5% human lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS), 300 nm PDB, and 1 μCi/ml [1-14C]acetic acid in the presence of Me2SO alone (≤0.5% of total cell medium) or increasing concentrations of OSCi, RO0714565 (0.5–1000 nm). Lipids were extracted, saponified, and separated by TLC using Whatman Partisil® LK6 TLC plates in hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (60:40:1, v/v/v). A PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences) were used for quantification of the cholesterol and 24(S),25-epoxy bands (19Rowe A.H. Argmann C.A. Edwards J.Y. Sawyez C.G. Morand O.H.

Sawyez C.G. Morand O.H. Hegele R.A. Huff M.W. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The synthesis of cholesterol, fatty acid, or triglyceride was measured in THP-1 cells following a preincubation for 24 h in RPMI 1640 with 5% human LPDS and 300 nm PDB along with selected doses of LXR agonists or the OSCi (15 nm). For a subsequent 5-h incubation, 1 μCi/ml [1-14C]acetic acid or 0.04 nCi/ml [1-14C]oleic acid (Amersham Biosciences) complexed with fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin in a molar ratio of 5.36:1 (Sigma) were added in the presence or absence of LXR agonists or OSCi as described (24Evans A.J. Sawyez C.G. Wolfe B.M. Connelly P.W. Maguire G.F. Huff M.W. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 703-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acid during the 5 h after the preincubation was measured by incorporation of [1-14C]acetic acid into these lipids. Saponified cellular lipid extracts were separated, and cholesterol was identified by TLC using Whatman Partisil® LK6 TLC plates in petroleum ether/diethyl ether/acetic acid (84:15:1, v/v/v) and quantitated as described previously (19Rowe A.H.

Fatty acids were measured from a second extraction following acidification of the infranatant of the saponified lipid extract as described previously (25Borradaile N.M. de Dreu L.E. Huff M.W. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2554-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Triglyceride synthesis was measured over a 5-h period by measuring incorporation of [1-14C]oleic acid into cellular triglyceride present in nonsaponified cellular lipid extracts following separation by thin layer chromatography (24Evans A.J. Sawyez C.G. Wolfe B.M. Connelly P.W. Maguire G.F. Huff M.W. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 703-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LPL activity in the medium of THP-1 cells was determined following a 24-h incubation with OSCi or the indicated LXR agonists (as described above) as the release of free fatty acids from intralipid, an exogenous lipid source (26Whitman S.C. Argmann C.A. Sawyez C.G. Miller D.B. Hegele R.A. Huff M.W. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1017-1028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cholesterol efflux was measured using 5 μg of cholesterol/ml of acLDL in the presence of OSCi or selected doses of LXR agonists as described previously (19Rowe A.H. Argmann C.A. Edwards J.Y. Sawyez C.G. Morand O.H. Hegele R.A. Huff M.W. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). mRNA Abundance—THP-1 cells were incubated for 24 h in RPMI 1640 with 5% LPDS, 300 nm PDB and in the presence of OSCi (at selected concentrations) or LXR agonists, and subsequently, total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Samples of total RNA were analyzed with an S1 nuclease protection assay to measure ABCA1, ABCG1, APOE, LPL, and FAS mRNA abundance relative to glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as described previously (19Rowe A.H. Argmann C.A. Edwards J.Y. Sawyez C.G. Morand O.H. Hegele R.A. Huff M.W. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 27Argmann C.A. Sawyez C.G. McNeil C.J. Hegele R.A. Huff M.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The target sequences for the S1 nuclease assay were as follows: ABCA1 (GenBank™ accession number NM_005502, bases 6896–6935); ABCG1 (GenBank™ accession number NM_207629, bases 2042–2088); APOE (GenBank™ accession number NM_000041, bases 79–127); LPL (GenBank™ accession number NM_000237, bases 502–552); FAS (GenBank™ accession number NM_004104, bases 443–505); and GAPDH (GenBank™ accession number BC029618, bases 730–745). SREBP-1c mRNA quantitation was performed by quantitative real time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) on an ABI Prism (model 7900HT) Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples of total RNA (75 ng) were assayed in 20-μl reactions in triplicate per treatment group on a 384-well plate using a one-step qRT-PCR protocol for SREBP-1c quantitation. ABCA1 and FAS mRNA abundance were confirmed using qRT-PCR. ABCA1 and FAS mRNA was measured from total RNA (10 μg) reverse transcribed using the Applied Biosystems High Capacity cDNA archive kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. cDNA (20–30 ng) was assayed in 20-μl reactions using the qRT-PCR protocol from Applied Biosystems. The standard curve method was used to determine mRNA abundance. Expressions of ABCA1, FAS, and SREBP-1c were each normalized to GAPDH expression. The SREBP-1c primer and probe set was obtained from Applied Biosystems, and the sequences were as reported previously (28Quinet E.M. Savio D.A. Halpern A.R. Chen L. Miller C.P. Nambi P. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1929-1942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar): forward primer (5′–3′), AGGGCGGGCGCAGAT; reverse primer (5′–3′), GGTTGTTGATAAGCTGAAGCATGT; probe (5′–3′), TCGAAAGTGCAATCCATGGCTCCG (GenBank™ accession number NM_001005291). The human ABCA1, FAS, and GAPDH primer and probe sets were obtained from Taqman® Assays-on-Demand (Applied Biosystems). Immunoblot Analysis and Densitometry—Immunoblot analyses of ABCA1 and SREBP-1 were conducted according to previously described methods (19Rowe A.H. Argmann C.A. Edwards J.Y. Sawyez C.G. Morand O.H. Hegele R.A. Huff M.W. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, THP-1 cells were incubated for 24 h in RPMI 1640 with 300 nm PDB and 5% LPDS in the presence of the OSCi, 24(S),25-epoxy, 22(R)-OH, 25-OH, TO901317, or acetylated LDL. Total cell lysates were fractionated into postnuclear and nuclear fractions as described (29Azzout-Marniche D. Becard D. Guichard C. Foretz M. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and separated by SDS-PAGE (6% acrylamide for ABCA1 and 10% for SREBP-1). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and immunoblotted as described previously (19Rowe A.H. Argmann C.A. Edwards J.Y. Sawyez C.G. Morand O.H. Hegele R.A. Huff M.W. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A polyclonal anti-ABCA1 antibody (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) or a monoclonal anti-SREBP-1 antibody (Neomarkers, Fremont, CA) were used to probe cellular post-nuclear fractions. Blots were reprobed with a polyclonal anti-β-actin antibody (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA). Nuclear fractions were probed with the monoclonal anti-SREBP-1 antibody, and blots were reprobed using a polyclonal anti-lamin A/C antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Quantification analysis of the developed films was performed using an imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad Quantity One Software). ABCA1 or pSREBP-1 from postnuclear fractions was normalized to β-actin, whereas nSREBP-1 from nuclear fractions was normalized to lamin A/C. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as means ± S.E. and were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance with significance set at p < 0.05 followed by Bonferonni post hoc analysis to determine significantly different treatment groups from control. Inhibition of OSC Decreases Cholesterol Biosynthesis While Simultaneously Increasing Endogenous Production of 24(S), 25-Epoxy—Inhibition of OSC with RO0714565 has previously been shown to decrease cholesterol biosynthesis and increase 24(S),25-epoxy production in J774.1 mouse macrophages (19Rowe A.H. Argmann C.A. Edwards J.Y. Sawyez C.G. Morand O.H. Hegele R.A. Huff M.W. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Consistent with this result, OSCi in human THP-1 macrophages decreased cholesterol biosynthesis over a 24-h period in a dose-dependent manner with a maximum decrease of 80% observed at 1 μm (p < 0.05 versus control) (Fig. 1A). The IC50 value for inhibition of cholesterol synthesis was ∼7.5 nm. A biphasic response in 24(S),25-epoxy synthesis was observed; as the concentration of the OSCi was increased, maximal synthesis was achieved at 15 nm RO0714565 (p < 0.05 compared with base line) (Fig. 1A). At concentrations greater than 15 nm, OSC became increasingly inhibited, such that 24(S),25-epoxy levels decreased to base line. A concentration of 15 nm RO0714565 was therefore selected for subsequent experiments. Exogenous Oxysterols Decrease Cholesterol Biosynthesis, whereas TO-901317 Has No Effect—The exogenous addition of oxysterols to mammalian cells inhibits the transcription, increases degradation, and decreases activity of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, a rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, resulting in a reduction in cholesterol biosynthesis (30Taylor F.R. Kandutsch A.A. Gayen A.K. Nelson J.A. Nelson S.S. Phirwa S. Spencer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15039-15044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). THP-1 cells were incubated for 24 h with 24(S),25-epoxy, 22(R)-OH, TO-901317, and the OSCi. Cholesterol synthesis was measured following an additional 5 h with the indicated compound and radiolabeled acetate. Exogenous 24(S),25-epoxy and 22(R)-OH significantly reduced cellular cholesterol synthesis to 37 and 52% of control, respectively, whereas the OSCi reduced cholesterol biosynthesis to 15% of control (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1B). In contrast, all three doses of TO-901317 showed no significant reduction in cholesterol biosynthesis (Fig. 1B). OSCi Enhances Transcription of ABCA1, ABCG1, and APOE and Increases Cholesterol Efflux to ApoAI—THP-1 macrophages incubated for 24 h with the OSCi (RO0714565) at 15 nm, a dose that maximized 24(S),25-epoxy synthesis, enhanced the expression of ABCA1 to a maximal level of 1.9-fold compared with control (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2A). At 0.01 nm, the OSCi had no effect on ABCA1 expression, whereas at 100 nm OSCi, ABCA1 mRNA abundance was decreased significantly (p < 0.05 compared with control) (Fig. 2A). We reasoned that the increased expression of ABCA1 at 15 nm OSCi would represent the anticipated maximum within the physiological context of enhanced endogenous synthesis of 24(S),25-epoxy. Doses of exogenous 24(S),25-epoxy (1 μm), 22(R)-OH (2 μm), and TO-901317 (2 nm) were selected in order to achieve the same magnitude of up-regulation of ABCA1 that was observed with 15 nm OSCi (p < 0.05 compared with control) (Fig. 2A). Higher doses of 24(S),25-epoxy (5 and 10 μm) increased ABCA1 expression 4.4- and 7.9-fold (p < 0.05). Higher doses of TO-901317, namely 10 nm and 1 μm, were chosen to examine pharmacological activation of LXR and were found to increase expression of ABCA1 3.1- and 8.0-fold, respectively (Fig. 2A). It should be noted that in previously published studies, the most common doses of TO-901317 used in cultured cells for pharmacological activation of LXR ranged between 1 and 10 μm (5Joseph S.B.

The OSCi resulted in a 3.4-fold increase in ABCA1 protein relative to control following normalization to β-actin. Exogenous 24(S),25-epoxy (1, 5, and 10 μm) increased ABCA1 protein abundance 3.5-, 8.8-, and 9.8-fold, respectively, and 22(R)-OH (2 μm) increased ABCA1 protein 1.6-fold (Fig. 2B).

Here, we show that Src signaling regulates the terminal step in cytokinesis called abscission in HeLa cells. Abscission failure with an unusually elongated intercellular bridge containing the midbody is induced by treatment with the chemical Src inhibitors PP2 and SU6656 or expression of membrane-anchored Csk chimeras. By anti-phosphotyrosine immunofluorescence and live cell imaging, completion of abscission requires Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation during early stages of mitosis (before cleavage furrow formation), which is subsequently delivered to the midbody through Rab11-driven vesicle transport. Treatment with U0126, a MEK inhibitor, decreases tyrosine phosphorylation levels at the midbody, leading to abscission failure. Activated ERK by MEK-catalyzed dual phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues in the TEY sequence, which is strongly detected by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, is transported to the midbody in a Rab11-dependent manner. Src kinase activity during the early mitosis mediates ERK activation in late cytokinesis, indicating that Src-mediated signaling for abscission is spatially and temporally transmitted. Thus, these results suggest that recruitment of activated ERK, which is phosphorylated by MEK downstream of Src kinases, to the midbody plays an important role in completion of abscission.

Cytokinesis is the last stage of mitosis when a single cell divides into two daughter cells after chromosome segregation. Defects in cytokinesis can induce cell death and genetic instability that brings about the development of aneuploid malignancies (1Storchova Z. Pellman D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). The process of cytokinesis must be spatially and temporally controlled in a sophisticated manner. During cytokinesis, two daughter cells are connected in a pair with a cytoplasmic bridge containing the midbody, which consists of bundled anti-parallel microtubules and associated proteins. The overlapped region of plus ends of microtubules forms a dense structure called the midbody matrix (2Otegui M.S. Verbrugghe K.J. Skop A.R.

Science. 2004; 305: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). These microtubule-based structures play key roles in cytokinesis from initiation to completion. Membrane trafficking ceases during early stages of mitosis, however, it resumes at late mitosis: internalized vesicles are trafficked to the recycling endosome during cleavage furrow ingression, and subsequently to the midbody during late stages of cytokinesis (4Schweitzer J.K.

For instance, inhibition of membrane transport via recycling endosomes (by expression of small interfering RNA for Rab11 or dominant-negative Rab11) or dispersion of the Golgi apparatus (by brefeldin A) causes defects in the late stage of cytokinesis in both Caenorhabditis elegans and mammalian cells (7Skop A.R.

Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2134) Google Scholar). SFKs are localized to membranes through their N-terminal myristoylation (11Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2134) Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of SFKs is suppressed by phosphorylation of their C-terminal tyrosine residues by Csk family tyrosine kinases (11Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Previous studies showed that the catalytic activity of SFKs is required for mitotic progression, because G2/M progression is prevented by microinjection of a neutralizing anti-Src/Fyn/Yes antibody or the SH2 domain of Fyn (18Roche S. Fumagalli S. Courtneidge S.A. Science. 1995; 269: 1567-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), and by treatment with PD173955, a chemical inhibitor of SFKs (19Moasser M.M. Srethapakdi M. Sachar K.S. Kraker A.J. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6145-6152PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of SFK activity in mitosis is dependent on dephosphorylation of their C-terminal tyrosine residues because c-Src is not activated during mitosis in protein-tyrosine phosphatase α knockout cells (20Zheng X. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The activity of c-Src and accessibility of its SH2 domain for protein binding are increased at the initial phase of mitosis (19Moasser M.M. Srethapakdi M. Sachar K.S. Kraker A.J. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6145-6152PubMed Google Scholar, 21Bagrodia S. Chackalaparampil I. Kmiecik T.E. Shalloway D.

However, tyrosine phosphorylation signaling thus far has not been fully characterized in cytokinesis. In this study, we explored SFK-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation in cytokinesis by immunofluorescence staining for phosphotyrosine and live cell imaging experiments using two chemical compounds, PP2 and SU6656, and two membrane-anchored Csk mutants, all of which act as potent inhibitors of SFKs. We show that SFK-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation signaling that is spatially and temporally transmitted is required for completion of abscission in cytokinesis.

Cells were fixed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, and permeabilized in PBS containing 0.1% saponin and 3% bovine serum albumin at room temperature. Cells were subsequently stained with an appropriate primary antibody for 1 h, washed with PBS containing 0.1% saponin, and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate- or TRITC-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. For anti-Tyr(P) (4G10) staining of the midbody, cells were in situ treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 3 min before fixation with 3% paraformaldehyde (39Nakayama Y. Kawana A. Igarashi A. Yamaguchi N. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 2252-3363Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1631-1641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Emission signals were detected between 505 and 530 nm for fluorescein, at more than 580 nm for rhodamine and more than 650 nm for propidium iodide. Care was taken to ensure that there was no bleed-through from the fluorescein signal into the red channel (38Tada J. Omine M. Suda T. Yamaguchi N. Blood. 1999; 93: 3723-3735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Time Lapse Phase-contrast Imaging—HeLa cells cultured in Isocove’s modified Dulbecco’s modified essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) were placed on a 40 °C preheated stage of an inverted Zeiss Axiovert S100 deconvolution microscope with 10 × 0.30 N.A. and 20 × 0.50 N.A. objectives, and monitored in the presence of various inhibitors. Time lapse monitoring started within 5 min after addition of an inhibitor to living HeLa cells at each stage of mitosis. Each stage is morphologically classified as follows: metaphase (sister chromatids are aligned in the center of cell), anaphase (sister chromatids are separated and moved to opposite poles), telophase (the cleavage furrow is formed between the segregated chromosomes), and cytokinesis (two daughter cells are attached and connected by an intercellular bridge containing the midbody). Images were analyzed with MetaMorph version 4.5 (Universal Imaging). Cell Synchronization—HeLa S3 cells were synchronized using successive aphidicolin and nocodazole blocks, because prolonged treatment with nocodazole for mitotic arrest has adverse effects on synchronous release of cells from nocodazole arrest. HeLa S3 cells grown as monolayers in Isocove’s modified Dulbecco’s modified essential medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum were blocked at S phase by addition of 1.6 μg/ml aphidicolin. After 16–20 h, the monolayers were washed twice with PBS. The cells were cultured for an additional 6–7 h, then exposed to 40 ng/ml nocodazole for 5–6 h. Round-shaped cells in mitotic stages were gently pipetted and collected by brief centrifugation. Mitotic cells were released from nocodazole treatment by extensively washing with pre-warmed PBS, and subsequently incubating in normal medium at 37 °C in suspension culture. Progression through mitosis was monitored every 10 min by immunofluorescence using anti-α-tubulin antibody and propidium iodide (see Fig. 3, A–C). For immunofluorescence, cells were directly fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and then attached on coverslips by brief cytocentrifugation. Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—Western blotting and immunoprecipitation were performed as described (17Kasahara K. Nakayama Y. Ikeda K. Fukushima Y. Matsuda D. Horimoto S. Yamaguchi N. J.

In brief, cell lysates were prepared in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 4 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4) or RIPA lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 4 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4) containing protease inhibitors (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μm leupeptin, and 25 μm pepstatin A) at 4 °C, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were incubated with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) precoated with anti-Src (clone 327), anti-Lyn (H-6), or anti-ERK2 antibody overnight at 4 °C. The immune complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, as described above. Src Kinase Activity at the Early Phase of Mitosis Is Required for Abscission—There is emerging evidence that Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation signaling is involved in cell division, especially at the G2-M transition, cleavage furrow progression, and completion of cytokinesis (18Roche S. Fumagalli S. Courtneidge S.A. Science. 1995; 269: 1567-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 43Ng M.M. Chang F. Burgess D.R. Dev.

Cell. 2000; 5: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). To investigate the involvement of Src kinase activity in cytokinesis, living HeLa cells were monitored in a time lapse manner in the presence of PP2, a potent SFK inhibitor, under a deconvolution microscope. We observed that prolonged treatment with PP2 prevented cells from entering into M phase (Fig. 1A), consistent with previous reports that the G2-M transition is blocked by inhibition of SFKs (18Roche S. Fumagalli S. Courtneidge S.A. Science. 1995; 269: 1567-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 19Moasser M.M. Srethapakdi M. Sachar K.S. Kraker A.J. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6145-6152PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, control cells completed cytokinesis within 144 ± 35 min after anaphase onset (n = 11, mean ± S.D.). Intriguingly, most cells that escaped from PP2-induced inhibition of G2/M progression formed the cleavage furrow with a normal time course, but remained connected by an unusually elongated intercellular bridge containing the midbody 350 min after anaphase onset (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that a defect in cytokinesis takes place during the terminal step in cytokinesis called abscission. To examine whether the involvement of Src kinase activity in abscission was temporally controlled, living HeLa cells treated with PP2 from a particular stage of M phase were monitored in a time lapse manner under a deconvolution microscope. When PP2 was added to cells before cleavage furrow formation, most cells underwent progression of the cleavage furrow, but remained connected in a pair by an elongated intercellular bridge (Fig. 2, A and C, filled bars, before metaphase and metaphase/anaphase). Additionally, cells sometimes appeared to exhibit a defect in cleavage furrow progression (Fig. 2C, shaded bars, before metaphase and metaphase/anaphase), in agreement with recent findings (43Ng M.M. Chang F. Burgess D.R. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 781-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, when cells were treated with PP2 after cleavage furrow formation, abscission was completed with a normal time course (Fig. 2, B and C, open bars, telophase and cytokinesis). Furthermore, treatment of cells with SU6656 (another selective SFK inhibitor; Ref. 31Blake R.A. Broome M.A. Liu X. Wu J. Gishizky M. Sun L. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9018-9027Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) in metaphase/anaphase induced abscission failure similar to that induced by PP2 (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that before cleavage furrow formation, SFK catalytic activity is required for abscission. PP2 Treatment Induces Abscission Failure in an Adhesion-independent Manner—SFKs play a role in cell adhesion and migration by controlling cytoskeletal reorganization (11Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2134) Google Scholar). However, the possibility that SFK inhibition reduces pulling/traction forces from two separating daughter cells (45Uyeda T.Q. Nagasaki A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) may be ruled out, because cell adhesion and motility during M phase was unaffected by PP2 treatment (Fig. 2, A and B, arrows). To further rule out this possibility, we examined mitotic progression in HeLa S3 cells grown in suspension culture. After release from nocodazole arrest (see details under “Experimental Procedures”), normal HeLa S3 cells synchronously progressed through mitosis, and most cells divided into two daughter cells within 180 min after nocodazole release (Fig. 3, A–D, scheme a, DMSO control). PP2 treatment (from 10 to 90 min) had a marginal effect on progression into cytokinesis until 90 min (Fig. 3E). However, when cells were treated with PP2 before furrow formation (10 min after nocodazole release), abscission failure was significantly detected at 180 min (Fig. 3, D and F, scheme b). Intriguingly, PP2 treatment after furrow formation (50 min after nocodazole release) minimally affected completion of abscission at 180 min (Fig. 3, D and F, scheme c). Taken together, SFK kinase activity during early M phase plays an important role in abscission in an adhesion-independent manner. Treatment with PP2 Decreases Tyrosine Phosphorylation Levels at the Midbody—To scrutinize tyrosine phosphorylation signaling specific for M phase, we examined the localization of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins by in situ detergent extraction and confocal fluorescence microscopy. Immunostaining of Triton X-100-treated cells with anti-phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) antibody revealed the localization of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins to the midbody (Fig. 4A). Because the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins found at the midbody were in particular resistant to Triton X-100 extraction, they may be tightly associated with cytoskeletal components at the midbody. The levels of tyrosine phosphorylation were higher at the plus-ends (+) of microtubules of the midbody than at the minus-ends (–), and a faint signal was detected at the midbody matrix (Fig. 4A). To investigate whether tyrosine phosphorylation signaling at the midbody was involved in PP2-induced abscission failure, we quantitated the fluorescence intensity of anti-Tyr(P) antibody reacted to the midbody region in PP2-treated cells. 12-h treatment of HeLa cells with PP2 induced a phenotype of cells having an unusually elongated intercellular bridge, as observed in time lapse monitoring of PP2-treated cells (Figs. 1 and 2), and significantly reduced the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation at the midbody (Fig. 4, B and C). These results suggest that PP2-induced abscission failure may be caused by reduced levels of tyrosine phosphorylation at the midbody. In contrast, a 30-min treatment of HeLa cells with PP2 had no effect on increased levels of tyrosine phosphorylation at the midbody and the appearance of a normal, short intercellular bridge (Fig. 4C; data not shown), despite a profound suppression of the kinase activity of c-Src (Fig. 4D). Once the midbody is formed, tyrosine phosphorylation signaling at the midbody may be insensitive to PP2 treatment. In other words, PP2 treatment from metaphase to anaphase, but not after cleavage furrow formation, is critical for induction of abscission failure (Figs. 2 and 3, A–F). Taken together, we suggest that abscission is depen"
https://openalex.org/W1979618663,"The organization and function of the Bacillus subtilis YsiA regulon involved in fatty acid degradation were investigated. Northern and primer extension analyses indicated that this regulon comprises five operons, i.e. lcfA-ysiA-B-etfB-A, ykuF-G, yhfL, yusM-L-K-J, and ywjF-acdA-rpoE. YusJ and AcdA, YsiB and YusL, and YusK presumably encode acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, 3-hydroxyl-CoA dehydrogenase/enoyl-CoA hydratase complexes, and acetyl-CoA C-acyltransferase, respectively, which are directly involved in the fatty acid β-oxidation cycle. In addition, LcfA and YhfL are likely to encode long chain acyl-CoA ligases. On gel retardation and footprinting analyses involving the purified YsiA protein, we identified cis-sequences for YsiA binding (YsiA boxes) in the promoter regions upstream of ysiA, ykuF, yusL, yhfL, and ywjF, the equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) for YsiA binding being 20, 21, 37, 43, and 65 nm, respectively. YsiA binding was specifically inhibited by long chain acyl-CoAs with 14–20 carbon atoms, acyl-CoAs with 18 carbon atoms being more effective; out of long chain acyl-CoAs tested, monounsaturated oleoyl-CoA, and branched chain 12-metyltetradecanoyl-CoA were most effective. These in vitro findings were supported by the in vivo observation that the knock-out of acyl-CoA dehydrogenation through yusJ, etfA, or etfB disruption resulted in YsiA inactivation, probably because of the accumulation of long chain acyl-CoAs in the cells. Furthermore, the disruption of yusL, yusK, yusJ, etfA, etfB, or ykuG affected the utilization of palmitic acid, a representative long chain fatty acid. Based on this work, ysiA, ysiB, ykuF, ykuG, yhfL, yusM, yusL, yusK, yusJ, and ywjF can be renamed fadR, fadB, fadH, fadG, lcfB, fadM, fadN, fadA, fadE, and fadF.

In all organisms fatty acids are essential components of membranes and are important sources of metabolic energy. Thus, fatty acid degradation and biosynthesis pathways must be switched on and off based on the availability of fatty acids. The regulation of these pathways has been mainly studied in a model prokaryote, Escherichia coli (1Cronan Jr., J.E. Rock C.O. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss R. II I Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechfer M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Celluar and Molecular Biology. 1996: 612-636Google Scholar). E. coli produces straight chain and unsaturated fatty acids, and E. coli FabH selectively uses acetyl-CoA to initiate the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway (2Rock C.O. Cronan J.E. Biochim. Biopys. Acta. 1996; 1320: 1-16Google Scholar, 3Rock C.O. Jackowski S. Biochem. Biopys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 1155-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In contrast, Bacillus subtilis mainly produces branched chain fatty acids and possesses two FabH isoenzymes (named FabHA and FabHB) that differ from the E. coli enzyme in that they are selective for branched chain acyl-CoAs (4Choi K.H. Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The second FabF-FabB class of condensing enzymes is responsible for the subsequent rounds of fatty acid elongation in the pathway (5Campbell J.W. Cronan Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 305-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). In B. subtilis, the FabF protein is the sole condensing enzyme able to carry out the subsequent elongation reactions in fatty acid synthesis (6de Mendoza D. Schujman G.E. Aguilar P.S. Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and Its Closest Relatives: From Genes to Cells. 2002: 43-55Google Scholar). Fatty acids that are intracellularly formed or extracellularly supplied are degraded through β-oxidation when the cells are starved of carbon sources. In E. coli, the transcription factor FadR functions as a coordinate switch that negatively regulates the machinery required for fatty acid β-oxidative degradation (fad) and positively regulates the key enzymes (3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein dehydratase (FabA) and 3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase I (FabB)) in unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis (5Campbell J.W. Cronan Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 305-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 7Cronan Jr., J.E. Subrahmanyam S. Mol.

Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5982-5990Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The fad genes are fadL encoding a fatty acid transporter, and fadD, fadE, fadB, fadA, and fadH involved in fatty acid β-oxidation encoding fatty acid-CoA ligase, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase/enoyl-CoA hydratase complex, acetyl-CoA C-acyltransferase, and 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase, respectively (8DiRusso C.C. Nystroöm T. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 10Magnuson K. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 522-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Besides, FadR activates expression of the iclR gene, which encodes the negative regulator of the glyoxylate shunt enzymes, and represses the universal stress protein gene (uspA). The expression of the FadR regulon members is regulated in a coordinated manner in the presence of long chain acyl-CoAs, which antagonize FadR as to its operator binding (11DiRusso C.C. Heimert T.L. Metzger A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8685-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In B. subtilis, a central mediator such as FadR that acts to balance the anabolic and catabolic fatty acid pathways has not been reported so far. Instead, a transcription regulatory protein for FapR was recently described (12Schujman G.E. Paoletti L. Grossman A.D. de Mendoza D. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 663-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) that controls the expression of many fap regulon members involved in fatty acid and phospholipid metabolism, including fapHA and fapHB, and fabF encoding the enzymes condensing branched chain acyl-CoAs with malonyl-acyl carrier protein and subsequent chain elongation, respectively. The FapR protein is controlled by the cellular pool of malonyl-CoA, which senses the status of fatty acid biosynthesis and adjusts the expression of the fap regulon members accordingly. B. subtilis possesses several paralogous genes that are most likely involved in the β-oxidation of fatty acids, such as lcfA, yhfL, yhfT, ysiB, yusLKJ, acdA, yhfS, and mmgABC (13Bryan E.M. Beall B.W. Moran Jr., C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4778-4786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kunst F. Ogasawara N. Moszer I.

Weibezahn J. Bernhardt J. Homuth G. Hecker M. Mol. Gen. Genomics. 2005; 274: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1), yet mmgABC is a σE-dependent operon (13Bryan E.M. Beall B.W. Moran Jr., C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4778-4786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a transcription factor such as FadR that functions as a coordinate switch that regulates fatty acid degradation negatively and fatty acid biosynthesis positively has not been described so far. In the framework of the Japan Functional Analysis Network for B. subtilis (bacillus.genome.jp/), we have performed comprehensive DNA microarray analysis of hundreds of DNA-binding transcription regulatory proteins. DNA microarray analysis involving the wild type strain and a disruptant as to ysiA, encoding one of the helix-turn-helix transcription regulatory proteins, indicated that the YsiA protein negatively regulates more than 10 genes, the majority of which most likely participate in fatty acid β-oxidation, which presumably plays a central regulatory role in fatty acid degradation. In this communication, we describe the organization and function of the YsiA regulon comprising the lcfA-ysiA-B-etfB-A, ykuF-G, yhfL, yusM-L-K-J, and ywjF-acdA-rpoE operons. YsiA represses the transcription of the genes, except lcfA and yusM, belonging to these operons through its binding to their YsiA boxes. The disruption of etfA, eftB, ykuG, yusL, yusK, and yusJ affected cell growth on fatty acid as the sole carbon source. The in vivo as well as in vitro experiments suggested that long chain acyl-CoAs are most likely inducers (or ligands) that antagonize YsiA as to its binding to YsiA boxes. Bacterial Strains and Their Construction—The B. subtilis strains used in this work are listed in Table 1. Strain FU788, provided by K. Kobayashi (Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan), was constructed in the framework of the Japan Functional Analysis Network for B. subtilis (JAFAN; bacillus.genome.jp) through the transformation of strain 168 with a PCR product prepared by means of long flanking homology PCR (19Wach A.

RNA samples were prepared from the cells of strains 168 (wild type) and FU788 (ysiA::cat) that had been grown in LB medium (25Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2001; (3rd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY)Google Scholar) and harvested in the middle of the logarithmic growth at A600 = 0.5. For Northern analysis, the above RNA samples were electrophoresed in a glyoxal gel and then transferred to a Hybond-N membrane (GE Healthcare) (25Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2001; (3rd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY)Google Scholar).

Hybridization was carried out as described previously (25Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2001; (3rd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY)Google Scholar). The transcripts were detected with imaging plates of Bioimaging Analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd). Primer Extension Analysis—Primer extension analysis was performed as described previously (26Yoshida K. Aoyama D. Ishio I. Shibayama T. Fujita Y. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4591-4598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted and purified from cell pellets as described above. Reverse transcription was initiated from the EysiA-R, EykuF-R, EyhfL-R, EyusL-R, and EywjF-R primers, corresponding to nucleotides +122 to +141, +146 to +165, +102 to +121, +141 to +160, and +111 to +131 (+1 is the transcription initiation base for each of the YsiA-regulated promoters, which was identified in this work), respectively (Table 2); they had been labeled at their 5′ end by use of a Megalabel kit (Takara Bio) and [γ-32P]ATP (GE Healthcare). Templates for the dideoxy sequencing reactions for ladder preparation starting from the same end-labeled primer were prepared by PCR using the respective primer pairs (Table 2; EysiA-F/EysiA-R, EykuF-F/EykuF-R, EyhfL-F/EyhfL-R, EyusL-F/EyusL-R, and EywjF-F/EywjF-R) and DNA from strain 168 as a template. Production and Purification of YsiA—To produce the YsiA protein in E. coli, the ysiA region was amplified by PCR using a primer pair (YsiA-N/YsiA-H, Table 2) and DNA of strain 168 as a template. After digestion with NdeI and HindIII of the PCR product and vector pET-22b(+) (Novagen), the resulting fragments were ligated and then used for the transformation of E. coli BL21 (DE3). Correct cloning of ysiA in plasmid pET-22b(+)-YsiA was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. The YsiA protein was overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) bearing pET-22b(+)-YsiA by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) 2The abbreviations used are: IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; β-Gal, β-galactosidase. to the medium at 1 mm. The cells were harvested, washed with 50 mm Tris-Cl buffer (pH 8.0) two times, and then suspended in 50 mm Tris-Cl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1% (w/v) glycerol. The cells were disrupted by sonication, and a supernatant was obtained by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min). The YsiA protein was purified with an anion exchange column chromatography (TOYO PEARL (DEAE-650M) (TOSOH Corp., Japan)) to near homogeneity. The purified YsiA protein was subjected to gel filtration column chromatography on Sephacryl S-200 HR (GE Healthcare) using 50 mm Tris-Cl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1% (w/v) glycerol and 100 mm NaCl to determine its molecular mass. Gel Retardation and DNase I Footprinting Experiments—Gel retardation and DNase I footprinting experiments were performed as described previously (27Yoshida K. Yamamoto Y. Omae K. Yamamoto M. Fujita Y. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For gel retardation analysis, the labeled probe DNAs carrying cis-sequences for YsiA binding (YsiA boxes) of the ysiA, yhfL, ykuF, yusL, and ywjF promoters were PCR products amplified from DNA of strain 168 using primer pairs (EysiA-F/EysiA-R, EyhfL-F/EyhfL-R, PykuF-F/PykuF-R, PyusL-F/PyusL-R, and EywjF-F/PywjF-R; Table 2) in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP (GE Healthcare), respectively. For DNase I footprinting, the probe DNAs were prepared by PCR amplification using the same respective primer pairs, either of the primers having been labeled at the 5′ terminus with a Megalabel kit and [γ-32P]ATP (GE Healthcare). Chemical Synthesis of Branched Long Chain Acyl-CoAs—12-Metyltetradecanoyl-CoA and 13-metyltetradecanoyl-CoA were chemically synthesized from 12-metyltetradecanoic acid and 13-metyltetradecanoic acid (Larodan Fine Chemicals AB) by the method of Seubert (28Seubert W. Biochem. Prep. 1960; 7: 80-83Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The branched long chain fatty acids were reacted with oxalyl chloride to form acyl chlorides. The acyl chlorides were converted with CoA to acyl-CoAs. The amounts of the formed acyl-CoAs were determined by using gas chromatography. Cell Growth and β-Galactosidase (β-Gal) Assay—Cells of pMUTIN (29Vagner V. Dervyn E. Ehrlich S.D. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3097-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) disruptants of the YsiA regulon members (Table 1), were grown at 30 °C on tryptose blood agar base (Difco) plus 10 mm glucose containing erythromycin (0.3 μg/ml) overnight. The cells were inoculated into 50 ml of LB medium with and without 1 mm IPTG and then incubated at 37 °C. During growth, 1-ml aliquots of the culture were withdrawn, and the β-Gal activity in the cells was spectrophotometrically assayed, as described previously (21Yoshida K. Ishio I. Nagakawa E. Yamamoto Y. Yamamoto M. Fujita Y. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To examine the utilization of fatty acid by the pMUTIN disruptant as the sole carbon source, the cells pregrown on tryptose blood agar base plus glucose plates as described above were suspended in S6 medium (30Fujita Y. Freese E. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 760-767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing tryptophan, and then the cells (A600 × ml = 0.5) were spread on S6 solid medium containing 50 μg/ml tryptophan and 4.35 mm sodium palmitate. The cells grown on each plate at 37 °C were suspended in 5 ml of S6 medium containing tryptophan to measure A600. The β-Gal activity in the cells was assayed as described above. Candidate YsiA-regulated Genes Detected on DNA Microarray Analysis—The YsiA protein is a member of the TetR family of bacterial helix-turn-helix transcriptional regulatory proteins according to Pfam (31Bateman A. Coin L. Durbin R. Finn R.D. Hollich V. Griffiths-Jones S. Khanna A. Marshall M. Moxon S. Sonnhammer E.L. Studholme D.J. Yeats C. Eddy S.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D138-D141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within the framework of the Japan Functional Analysis Network for B. subtilis, we performed DNA microarray analysis to find candidate YsiA-regulated genes through comparison of the transcriptomes from cells of the ysiA disruptant (strain FU788) and parental wild type strain 168 grown to the logarithmic growth phase in LB medium. The analysis revealed candidate YsiA-repressed genes of ykuF, G, yusM, L, K, J, ywjF, acdA, rpoE, yhfL, lcfA, ysiB, etfA, etfB, and ysiA itself. All of these genes except yhfL are clustered in the respective orders of ykuF and G; yusM, L, K, and J; ywjF, acdA, and rpoE; and lcfA, ysiA, B, etfB, and A genes. A BLASTP sequence similarity search (17Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) for these gene products revealed their probable functions to be as follows (Fig. 1). The YusL and YsiB, YusK, and YusJ and AcdA proteins exhibited high sequence similarities to the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase/enoyl-CoA hydratase complexes, acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferases, and acyl-CoA dehydrogenases of many Gram-positive low GC bacteria, respectively. The LcfA and YhfL proteins exhibited high similarity to long chain fatty acid-CoA ligases. Moreover, the EtfA and EtfB proteins exhibited high sequence similarities to the α- and β-subunits of electron transfer flavoproteins, respectively. These enzymes are known to be involved in fatty acid β-oxidation. The products of the genes (LcfA, YhfL, AcdA, YusJ, YusL, YsiB, YusK, EtfA, and EtfB) could be well assigned in each of the enzymatic steps in the β-oxidation of fatty acids according to their probable functions (Fig. 1). In addition, YkuF showed significant sequence similarity to the 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductases of Gram-positive bacteria belonging to Bacillus and related genera. The YwjF protein, a 4Fe-4S ferredoxin protein, might possibly be involved in electron transfer associated with acyl-CoA dehydrogenation, and the YkuG protein possessing a peptidoglycan-binding domain might possibly participate in fatty acid transport as described below. However, we currently cannot explain how RpoE (RNA polymerase δ-subunit) and YusM similar to proline dehydrogenases participate in fatty acid degradation. Operon Organization of YsiA-regulated Genes—The YsiA regulon appears to be involved in fatty acid degradation. To reveal the operon organization of YsiA-repressed genes, their transcripts were analyzed by Northern blotting using the respective DNA probes for these genes and total RNA from cells of strains FU788 (ysiA::cat) and 168 grown to the logarithmic growth phase in LB medium (Figs. 2 and 3). A 3.5-kb transcript was detected with either the ykuF or ykuG probe only in the lanes of RNA derived from the ysiA disruptant, indicating that the two genes constitute an operon, whereas a 1.7-kb one was observed with the yhfL probe, indicating that it is monocistronically transcribed (Fig. 2). As expected, we found palindromic structures, which might act as ρ-independent terminators, just downstream of each of ykuG and yhfL. 5.5- and 7.0-kb transcripts were commonly detected only in the lanes of RNA derived from the ysiA disruptant with the yusL, yusK, or yusJ probe, indicating that the yusL, yusK, and yusJ genes might constitute an operon. Another palindomic sequence was found just downstream of yusJ, so the 5.5-kb transcript covered the yusL, yusK and yusJ genes. The 7.0-kb transcript, detected with the yusL, K, and J probes, appeared to carry the yusM gene besides the yusL, yusK, and yusJ ones (Fig. 2). A 4.2-kb transcript was detected with the ywjF, acdA, and rpoE probes only in lanes of RNA derived from the ysiA disruptant, and a short 0.7-kb transcript was observed in the lanes of RNA derived from both strains FU788 (ysiA::cat) and 168 only with the rpoE probe (Fig. 2). Because an ρ-independent terminator-like sequence was found just downstream of rpoE, the 4.2-kb transcript likely covered the ywjF, acdA, and rpoE genes, whereas the 0.7-kb transcript covered only rpoE.FIGURE 2Northern analysis of ykuF-G, yhfL, yusM-L-K-J, ywjF-acdA-rpoE transcripts. Total RNA samples from strains 168 (wild type) and FU788 (ysiA::cat) grown in LB medium to A600 = 0.5 were subjected to Northern analysis using the ykuF, ykuG, yhfL, yusL, yusK, yusJ, ywjF, acdA, and rpoE probes (indicated beneath the panels). The analysis was performed as described in the text. Each lane contained 10 μg of total RNA. The positions of size markers are indicated on the left. The open arrowheads indicate the positions of 23 and 16 rRNAs, respectively. Bold bars indicate the positions of the probes beneath the genes. Putative transcription terminators are given downstream of the last genes of the operons.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The lcfA, ysiA, B, etfB, and A genes are clustered in this order. The plasmid pMUTIN integrant in the ysiA gene (strain YSIAd (ysiA::pMUTIN)) (Fig. 4) was constructed to examine ysiA expression. As seen in gene organization of the vicinity of the pMUTIN-disrupted ysiA (Fig. 4), plasmid pMUTIN carrying the 5′-side inside portion of ysiA was integrated into it through single cross-over event; the integration not only disrupts the ysiA gene but also replaces it with lacZ as reporter of ysiA expression (29Vagner V. Dervyn E. Ehrlich S.D. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3097-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Strain YSIAd constitutively synthesized β-Gal (∼100 nmol/min/A600) during cell growth in LB medium, indicating that the ysiA gene is autorepressed. Hence, we performed Northern blotting using 2-fold more RNA of strains FU788 (ysiA::cat) and 168 with prolonged 32P exposure of the imaging plates (Fig. 3). So 5.1-, 3.2-, and 0.7-kb transcripts were only detected in the lane of the wild type RNA with the ysiA probe, whereas the 5.1- and 3.2-kb ones were only observed in the lane of the wild type RNA with the ysiB probe, the 0.7-kb transcript likely coding only ysiA. The 5.1- and 1.8-kb transcripts were only detected in the lane of the wild type RNA with the lcfA probe, the 1.8-kb one appearing to carry only lcfA (Fig. 3). A probable ρ-independent terminator was found immediately downstream of etfA, so the 3.2-kb transcript probably covers the ysiA, ysiB, etfB, and etfA genes, and the 5.1-kb transcript likely carries the lcfA gene immediate upstream of ysiA besides these four genes. The overall results of Northern blotting indicated that the YsiA regulon comprises five operons (lcfA-ysiA-ysiB-etfB-etfA, ykuF-ykuG, yhfL, yusM-yusL-yusK-yusJ, and ywjF-acdA-rpoE). To locate the transcription initiation sites for the 3.2-kb ysiA-B-etfB-A, 3.5-kb ykuF-G, 1.7-kb yhfL, 5.5-kb yusL-K-J, and 4.2-kb ywjF-acdA-rpoE transcripts, the synthesis of which was highly repressed by YsiA, we performed primer extension analysis using the same RNA samples as those used for Northern analysis (Figs. 2 and 3). As shown in Fig. 5, a specific band of run-off cDNA from each of the primers for the transcripts was strongly repressed by YsiA, so it was only detected with the total RNA from the ysiA disruptant; the RNA fragment corresponding to the 5′-portion of the 3.2-kb ysiAB-etfBA and 0.7-kb ysiA transcripts was supposed to be abundant in this ysiA disruptant (strain YSIAd).

Within Nogo-A, two separate domains are known interact with NgR1. NgR1 is the founding member of the three-member NgR family, whereas Nogo-A (RTN4A) belongs to a four-member reticulon family. Here, we systematically mapped the interactions between these superfamilies, demonstrating novel nanomolar interactions of RTN2 and RTN3 with NgR1. Because RTN3 is expressed in spinal cord white matter, it may have a role in myelin inhibition of axonal growth. Further analysis of the Nogo-A and NgR1 interactions revealed a novel third interaction site between the proteins, suggesting a trivalent Nogo-A interaction with NgR1. We also confirmed here that MAG binds to NgR2, but not to NgR3. Unexpectedly, we found that OMgp interacts with MAG with a higher affinity compared with NgR1. To better define how these multiple structurally distinct ligands bind to NgR1, we examined a series of Ala-substituted NgR1 mutants for ligand binding activity. We found that the core of the binding domain is centered in the middle of the concave surface of the NgR1 leucine-rich repeat domain and surrounded by differentially utilized residues. This detailed knowledge of the molecular interactions between NgR1 and its ligands is imperative when assessing options for development of NgR1-based therapeutics for central nervous system injuries.

When nerve fibers of the brain and spinal cord in adult mammals are severed, little to no regrowth occurs.

It is plausible that adaptive compensation for chronic genetic loss of NgR1 or Nogo-A may explain this observation in part.Alternatively, the less pronounced genetic versus pharmacological phenotype might relate to redundancy among the myelin inhibitory proteins and their signaling pathways. NgR1 is the founding member of the three-member NgR family (11Barton W.A. Liu B.P. Tzvetkova D. Jeffrey P.D. Fournier A.E. Sah D. Cate R. Strittmatter S.M. Nikolov D.B.

FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1238-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). MAG and OMgp have no known paralogs. A recent report demonstrated that, in vitro, MAG can bind and exert its inhibitory function via NgR2 as well as NgR1 (27Venkatesh K. Chivatakarn O. Lee H. Joshi P.S. Kantor D.B. Newman B.A. Mage R. Rader C. Giger R.J. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 808-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The ability of OMgp to bind other NgR family members has not been assessed. The functions of other RTNs are largely enigmatic (28Yan R. Shi Q. Hu X. Zhou X. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). As other RTNs are also present in the central nervous system and contain homologous RHDs, we hypothesized previously that they could interact with NgR family members (25Lauré;n J. Airaksinen M.S. Saarma M. Timmusk T. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 24: 581-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Here, we have mapped the NgR family binding properties of all RTNs, MAG, and OMgp. We also demonstrate that RTN3, which we found to bind to NgR1, is expressed in spinal cord white matter.Several topologies of Nogo-A relative to the lipid bilayer have been supported experimentally. The extended length, 35 and 36 amino acids (3Oertle T. van der Haar M.E. Bandtlow C.E. Robeva A. Burfeind P. Buss A. Huber A.B. Simonen M. Schnell L. Brosamle C. Kaupmann K. Vallon R. Schwab M.E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5393-5406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), of the hydrophobic segments flanking the Nogo-66 segment suggests that these segments might not be single-pass transmembrane regions. A recent report supports the existence of a conformation in which all three of the hydrophilic segments of the RTNs are on the same side of the lipid bilayer (29Voeltz G.K. Prinz W.A. Shibata Y. Rist J.M. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 2006; 124: 573-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that C-terminal amino acids might contribute to NgR1 binding, a hypothesis we test here.The molecular basis for NgR1 interaction with multiple ligands has not been defined. LRR domains are commonly involved in protein/protein interactions presumably because the non-globular extended surface of the LRR domain provides ample opportunities for high affinity interactions. Here, we show that NgR1 utilizes certain residues to interact with multiple ligands in a central binding region and other surrounding residues to interact with specific ligands. These data helps us to understand the ligand specificity of different NgR family members and contribute to the elucidation of how central nervous system axonal plasticity and regeneration are limited by the interaction between multiple ligands and NgR family members.Recombinant DNA Constructs—The alkaline phosphatase (AP)-Nogo-66, AP-Y4C (human Nogo-A amino acids 950-1018), AP-Nogo-A-24 (human Nogo-A amino acids 995-1018) AP-MAG, AP-OMgp, and AP-Lingo-1 constructs have been described (6Fournier A.E.

To generate additional AP fusion proteins, DNA fragments encoding 66-amino acid sequences of RTN1, RTN2, and RTN3 (as shown in Fig. 1W) were cloned into pAPtag5 (kindly provided by Dr. J. G. Flanagan, Harvard Medical School) (32Flanagan J.G. Cheng H.J. Feldheim D.A. Hattori M. Lu Q. Vanderhaeghen P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) with restriction enzyme XbaI. For the AP-C-terminal Nogo-A construct (AP-Nogo-C39), the DNA encoding the last 39 amino acids of human Nogo-A was cloned into the XbaI site of pAPtag5. An additional MAG-AP construct was generated by cloning the sequence encoding the MAG ectodomain devoid of signal peptide into the HindIII and BglII restriction sites in pAPtag5. Mouse MAG, TLR4, NgR2, and NgR3 expression constructs contain Igκ signal peptide and Myc and His6 tags, followed by respective open reading frames devoid of signal peptides. These inserts were cloned into the XbaI restriction site of a modified pSecTag2a plasmid in which the stop codon was replaced with the XbaI site. pSecTag2a was modified using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The Myc-NgR1 expression construct has been described (6Fournier A.E. GrandPre T. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 2001; 409: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). Also, an additional AP-Nogo-66 construct based on the pAPtag5 plasmid backbone was used in some experiments. This was created by subcloning an insert from the original pcAP-5-Nogo-66 plasmid (6Fournier A.E. GrandPre T. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 2001; 409: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar) into the pAPtag5 vector. All constructs were sequenced to confirm that no unwanted changes had occurred.NgR1 Mutagenesis—NgR1 mutagenesis was accomplished using the QuikChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). A FLAG-tagged human NgR1 expression construct was used as a template. All mutant NgR1 constructs were analyzed by sequencing.Recombinant Proteins—Expression vectors encoding AP fusion proteins were transfected into HEK293T cells, and conditioned media were collected after 5-7 days. In some cases, conditioned media were concentrated using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filtration devices (Millipore Corp.). His6 tag-containing AP-MAG, MAG-AP, and AP-OMgp were purified from conditioned media using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity resin (Qiagen Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.COS-7 Ligand Binding Assay—COS-7 binding assays were performed as described (6Fournier A.E. GrandPre T. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 2001; 409: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). Conditioned media containing AP-fused ligands or purified ligands were incubated with COS-7 cells transfected with the indicated constructs for 1-2 h at room temperature before washing and fixation. Bound AP was visualized by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium reaction.Immunocytochemistry—Live cell immunostaining was performed by incubating cells in Hanks’ balanced saline solution with 0.05% bovine serum albumin and AP-conjugated anti-Myc antibody (9E10, Sigma; 1:200 dilution) or anti-NgR1 antibody (6Fournier A.E. GrandPre T. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 2001; 409: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar) at room temperature or on ice for 1 h, followed by washing and fixation. The cells were then incubated for 1.5 h in 65 °C. Finally, bound antibodies were visualized by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium reaction.In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization was performed as described (25Lauré;n J. Airaksinen M.S. Saarma M. Timmusk T. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 24: 581-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The RTN probes described previously (25Lauré;n J. Airaksinen M.S. Saarma M. Timmusk T. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 24: 581-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) were designed to recognize the splice variants containing the sequence encoding the 66-amino acid loop region.RESULTSNgR1 Is a High Affinity Receptor for Several RTN Family Members—We prepared N-terminal AP fusion proteins of all RTN 66-amino acid loop regions and analyzed their binding properties for NgR family members (Fig. 1). We found that, in addition to Nogo-66, RTN2-66 and RTN3-66 interact with NgR1, but not with other NgR family members or other related members of the type I transmembrane LRR-containing protein superfamily tested (Fig. 1). The affinities of RTN2-66, RTN3-66, and Nogo-66 for NgR1 appeared to be similar, with Kd values for RTN2-66 and Nogo-66 of ∼1 nm and for RTN3-66 of ∼4 nm (Fig. 1V). RTN1-66 showed no affinity for NgR1 even at the highest concentration tested (50 nm).Rtn3 and Nogo-A Are Expressed in the Same Glial Cell Population of Spinal Cord White Matter—A previous report showed Nogo-A expression in central nervous system oligodendrocytes (4GrandPre T. Nakamura F. Vartanian T. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). However, the possible expression of other RTNs in spinal cord white matter has not been analyzed. We analyzed the expression of all RTN mRNAs in adult mouse lumbar spinal cord by in situ hybridization. Consistent with the previous study (25Lauré;n J. Airaksinen M.S. Saarma M. Timmusk T. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 24: 581-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we found that all RTN mRNAs were expressed in neurons (Fig. 2). Interestingly, we found prominent expression of Rtn3 and Rtn4 mRNA transcripts in the white matter/lateral funiculus (Fig. 2, I and L, arrowheads). Nissl counterstaining of the sections enabled large and weakly stained nuclei (neurons) to be distinguished from small and strongly stained nuclei (glia). We noted that glial cell nuclei of the stained cryosections displayed dichotomy in size distribution and that Nogo-A and Rtn3 mRNAs were expressed by the same cell population characterized by larger and more weakly stained nuclei compared with other glial cells. The probes used in these experiments were designed to cover the conserved RHDs and are relatively homologous: in the most homologous 203-nucleotide sequence stretch, Rtn3 and Nogo-A probes are 73% identical, but contain no identical nucleotide stretches longer than 11 nucleotides. Notably, in the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum, strong Nogo-A mRNA expression was observed, but no or low level expression of Rtn3 mRNA was detected, thus confirming the specificity of the hybridization reaction (supplemental Fig. 1). No signal was detected with control sense probes (data not shown).FIGURE 2Rtn3 and Rtn4 (Nogo-A) mRNAs, but not Rtn1 and Rtn2 mRNAs, are expressed in adult mouse spinal cord white matter. We analyzed the localization of the Rtn1 (A-C), Rtn2 (D-F), Rtn3 (G-I), and Rtn4 (J-L) mRNAs in adult mouse lumbar spinal cord by in situ hybridization. Prominent expression of all four transcripts was observed in neuronal cells in gray matter. Furthermore, Rtn3 and Rtn4 mRNAs were detected in non-neuronal cells (A, D, G, and J, boxed areas). C, F, I, and L are the boxed areas in A, D, G, and J, respectively, at higher magnification and show prominent Rtn3 and Rtn4 signals and that the signals overlap with non-neuronal cells with relatively larger nuclei (red arrowheads). Scale bars = 100 μm (J, for lower magnification images) and 20 μm (L, for higher magnification images).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Nogo-A Interaction with NgR1 Involves Three Segments of Nogo-A—We produced an AP fusion protein of the C-terminal 39 residues of Nogo-A (AP-Nogo-C39) and measured its affinity for NgR family members. We found that it interacted with high affinity and specificity with only NgR1 (Fig. 3). The NgR1 binding affinity (Kd) of AP-Nogo-C39 was determined to be nearly the same as that of the AP-Nogo-A-24 fragment; however, AP-Nogo-66 showed the highest affinity for NgR1. We also reconsidered the Kd of the Nogo-66/NgR1 interaction. The AP-Nogo-66 protein we used in previous studies was found to have been proteolytically cleaved to a significant degree between the AP moiety and Nogo-66. Re-subcloning of the same insert into the pAPtag5 plasmid serendipitously led to formation of a stable recombinant protein (supplemental Fig. 2). This allowed us to determine Nogo-66 affinity for NgR1 more accurately than in previous studies and suggests that partial ligand degradation is likely to have resulted in an underestimation of Nogo-66 affinity for NgR1. We concluded that Nogo-66 binds to NgR1 with a Kd of 1 nm.FIGURE 3The C-terminal segment of Nogo-A (Nogo-C39) binds to NgR1, but not to other NgR family members. 50 nm (A) and 5 nm (A′) Nogo-C39, 50 nm (B) and 5 nm (B′) Nogo-66, and 50 nm (C) and 5 nm (C′) Nogo-A-24 all bound to NgR1 with high affinity. No interaction of Nogo-C39 with NgR2 (D) or with NgR3 (E) was detected. AP protein alone showed no affinity for NgR1 even at high concentration (200 nm) (F). The dissociation constants for interactions between different Nogo-A fragments and NgR1 were determined (G). Data were averaged from three experiments. A summary of the Kd values for the interactions (means ± S.E.) is provided (H). A schematic drawing (N terminus not drawn to scale) highlighting the different NgR1-binding segments of Nogo-A is shown (I). Scale bar = 100 μm (A).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The C-terminal Fragment of Nogo-A Interacts Exclusively with the LRR Domain of NgR1—We mapped the interaction site of Nogo-C39 in NgR1 using a series of deletion mutants lacking pairs of the LRR or other structural elements in NgR1 as described (33Fournier A.E. Gould G.C. Liu B.P. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8876-8883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The LRR domain of NgR1 was indispensable for Nogo-C39 binding (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4The LRR domain of NgR1 is necessary for binding of the C-terminal segment of Nogo-A. Binding of Nogo-C39 at 50 nm to full-length wild-type (WT) NgR1 (A), deletion mutants lacking the indicated LRR units (C-H), adjacent cysteine-rich flanking regions (N-terminal (LRR-NT) and C-terminal (LRR-CT); B and G), or the juxtamembrane stalk region (CT; I) was detected. Different structural units are indicated in J. All NgR1 deletion constructs were detected on the plasma membrane by live cell staining with anti-FLAG antibody (data not shown) (33Fournier A.E. Gould G.C. Liu B.P. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8876-8883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

(27Venkatesh K. Chivatakarn O. Lee H. Joshi P.S. Kantor D.B. Newman B.A. Mage R. Rader C. Giger R.J. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 808-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) reported that MAG-Fc interacts with NgR2 and that NgR2 mediates MAG-dependent growth inhibitory signaling other than NgR1-mediated signaling. Previously, we failed to observe AP-MAG fusion protein binding to human NgR2 (11Barton W.A. Liu B.P. Tzvetkova D. Jeffrey P.D. Fournier A.E. Sah D. Cate R. Strittmatter S.M. Nikolov D.B. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3291-3302Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). As Venkatesh et al. also failed to see AP-MAG/NgR2 interaction, they proposed that AP tagging of MAG sterically interferes with the binding to NgR2, but not to NgR1. Since then, we have identified a non-conservative nucleotide variant in the PCR-derived NgR2 expression construct used in our previous study. When using a wild-type NgR2 expression plasmid, we found that AP-MAG bound with similar affinity to NgR2 and NgR1 (Fig. 5). Because of the higher expression level of the transfected Myc-NgR2 construct, we observed higher maximal binding of AP-MAG to NgR2-than to NgR1-expressing cells. However, as analyzed by Scatchard analysis, the dissociation constants for these interactions were essentially identical using these constructs. MAG had no detectable affinity for NgR3. Binding experiments using MAG-AP resulted in similar results (data not shown).FIGURE 5Interactions between MAG, OMgp, and NgR family members. 15 nm MAG bound avidly to NgR1 (A) and NgR2 (B), but not to NgR3 (C) or to another member of the LRR-containing protein superfamily, TLR4 (E). Homophilic binding of AP-MAG to MAG expressed on the cell surface was also detected (D). Cell-surface expression of Myc-NgR3 was confirmed by live cell staining with anti-Myc antibody (F). The results from analysis of MAG binding to NgRs as a function of ligand concentration are shown (G). Data are averaged from four experiments. The Kd values for MAG interaction with NgR1 and NgR2 were determined by Scatchard analysis (H). A summary of the Kd values for MAG/NgR interactions (means ± S.E.) is provided (I). AP-OMgp (25 nm (J and K) and 12 nm (J′ and K′)) bound MAG with higher affinity compared with NgR1. Scale bar = 100 μm (A).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)OMgp Binds MAG with Very High Affinity and NgR1 with Moderate Affinity and Does Not Interact with NgR2 or NgR3—OMgp was identified previously as a myelin inhibitory molecule interacting with NgR1 (9Wang K.C. Koprivica V. Kim J.A. Sivasankaran R. Guo Y. Neve R.L. He Z. Nature. 2002; 417: 941-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). To investigate whether OMgp can also interact with NgR2 or NgR3, we prepared AP-OMgp recombinant protein and assessed its affinity for NgR family members. As reported previously (9Wang K.C. Koprivica V. Kim J.A. Sivasankaran R. Guo Y. Neve R.L. He Z. Nature. 2002; 417: 941-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar), we found that OMgp interacted with NgR1. Unexpectedly, under other conditions tested, we found that OMgp interacted with MAG and that this interaction had significantly higher affinity than the binding affinity of OMpg/NgR1 interaction. The Kd values for OMgp/MAG and OMgp/NgR1 interactions are 3-6 and 10-20 nm, respectively (Fig. 5, J and K) (data not shown). We did not detect OMgp binding to NgR2 or NgR3 (data not shown).A Library of NgR1 Mutants Is Expressed in a Similar Fashion Compared with Wild-type NgR1—NgR1 has the capacity to bind Nogo-66, MAG, OMgp, Lingo-1, Nogo-A-24 and Nogo-C39 (6Fournier A.E.

To better define how multiple ligands with so wide a structural diversity bind to NgR1, we examined a series of Ala-substituted NgR1 mutants for ligand binding activity. An Ala substitution was generated for each of the charged residues predicted to be solvent-accessible at the surface of the ligandbinding LRR domain of NgR1 (10He X.L. Bazan J.F. McDermott G.

We generated mutants in which 1-8 surface residues localized with in 5 Aå of one another were Ala-substituted. Because of the coiling nature of the LRR structure, residues juxtaposed on the protein surface are separated by ∼25 residues in the primary structure. In addition to mutations in specific charged surface patches, other mutations were targeted to glycosylation sites (Asn82"
https://openalex.org/W2022714365,"N2-Methylguanine 966 is located in the loop of Escherichia coli 16 S rRNA helix 31, forming a part of the P-site tRNA-binding pocket. We found yhhF to be a gene encoding for m2G966 specific 16 S rRNA methyltransferase. Disruption of the yhhF gene by kanamycin resistance marker leads to a loss of modification at G966. The modification could be rescued by expression of recombinant protein from the plasmid carrying the yhhF gene. Moreover, purified m2G966 methyltransferase, in the presence of S-adenosylomethionine (AdoMet), is able to methylate 30 S ribosomal subunits that were purified from yhhF knock-out strain in vitro. The methylation is specific for G966 base of the 16 S rRNA. The m2G966 methyltransferase was crystallized, and its structure has been determined and refined to 2.05Aå. The structure closely resembles RsmC rRNA methyltransferase, specific for m2G1207 of the 16 S rRNA. Structural comparisons and analysis of the enzyme active site suggest modes for binding AdoMet and rRNA to m2G966 methyltransferase. Based on the experimental data and current nomenclature the protein expressed from the yhhF gene was renamed to RsmD. A model for interaction of RsmD with ribosome has been proposed.

Ribosomal RNAs form the main functional core of the ribosome, a universal molecular machine for protein synthesis. It is believed that primordial ribosome was initially composed entirely of RNA (1Noller H.F. Woese C.R. Science. 1981; 212: 403-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) and proteins were added later in evolution. A set of four ribonucleotides used in rRNA is rather limited for the full range and fine tuning of ribosomal functions especially when compared with 20 amino acids the proteins are composed of. The diversity in RNA could be increased through the usage of a set of modified nucleotides (2Levy M. Miller S.L. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 48: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A number of such nucleotides have been found in functional ribosomal RNA molecules (as well as other RNA). It was also shown that nucleotide modification is an important component of the ribosome maturation process (3Cunningham P.R. Richard R.B. Weitzmann C.J. Nurse K. Ofengand J.T. Biochimie (Paris). 1991; 73: 789-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The nucleotide modifications can involve bases and ribose. The most common in bacteria is base methylation, but other substitutions have also been reported (4McCloskey J.A. Rozenski J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: D135-D138Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The specific functional role of nucleotide modifications is not always obvious, but their clustering in the ligand-binding and catalytic centers (5Mueller F. Brimacombe R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 524-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) suggests their involvement in the vital ribosome functions. Even more striking is the fact that many of the nucleotide methylations are performed by site-specific RNA methyltransferases, at a rather significant metabolic cost to the cell. The surrounding of the P-site of the ribosome is particularly rich in modified bases. Several RNA small patches consisting entirely of modified bases have been found. For example, helix 31 of 16 S rRNA contains two modified bases in a row: m2G966 and m5C967 (Fig. 1A). m2G966 is in direct contact with P-site-bound tRNA as revealed by a footprinting assay (6Moazed D. Noller H.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and later structural studies (7Yusupov M.M. Yusupova G.Z. Baucom A. Lieberman K. Earnest T.N. Cate J.H.

It is located in the head of the small ribosomal subunit, above the P-site-bound tRNA and forms a direct contact with the tip of the anticodon loop (7Yusupov M.M. Yusupova G.Z. Baucom A. Lieberman K.

Interestingly, despite the lack of conservation of the nucleotide 966 among the kingdoms of life (9Cannone J.J. Subramanian S. Schnare M.N. Collett J.R. D'Souza L.M. Du Y. Feng B. Lin N.

A protein with RNA methyltransferase activity, specific for m2G966, was partially purified from Escherichia coli extracts (13Weitzmann C. Tumminia S.J. Boublik M. Ofengand J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 7089-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It was shown to act on assembled 30 S subunits but not protein-free 16 S rRNA as substrate. Together ribosomal proteins S7 and S19 were shown to be sufficient to render 16 S rRNA a substrate for the (guanine-N2)-methyltransferase (13Weitzmann C. Tumminia S.J. Boublik M. Ofengand J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 7089-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Both proteins affect helix 31 folding, as was shown by footprinting (14Powers T. Changchien L.M. Craven G.R. Noller H.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). On the contrary, RNA methyltransferase, specific for C967 methylation, was shown to modify naked 16 S rRNA but not 30 S subunits (13Weitzmann C. Tumminia S.J. Boublik M. Ofengand J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 7089-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The addition of S7 and S19 together is sufficient to impede C967 methylation. While a gene coding for m5C967 methyltransferase, rsmB, was identified twice independently (15Gu X.R. Gustafsson C. Ku J. Yu M. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4053-4057Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 16Tscherne J.S. Nurse K. Popienick P. Michel P. Sochacki M. Ofengand J.

Here we present evidence that in E. coli the yhhF gene, not ygjO, is encoding for m2G966 specific methyltransferase RsmD. We have also determined the crystal structure of RsmD at 2.05 Aå resolution. The structure of RsmD is highly similar to that of RsmC protein (19Huang L. Hung L. Odell M. Yokota H. Kim R. Kim S-H. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2002; 2: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), whose modification target m2G1207 is located very close in the spatial structure of the small ribosomal subunit. Comparison of the RsmD structure to that of the RsmB methyltransferase (20Foster P.G. Nunes C.R. Greene P. Moustakas D. Stroud R.M.

After ultrasonic disruption and sedimentation of debris, ribosomes were pelleted by ultracentrifugation in the Ti70 rotor at 30,000 rpm, for 3 h. The ribosomal pellet was resuspended in the high salt buffer (HepesK, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 500 mm NH4Cl) and centrifuged through the 20% sucrose cushion at 40,000 rpm, for 18 h. 30 S ribosomal subunits were prepared by ultracentrifugation through the 10-30% sucrose density gradient in SW28 rotor at 20,000 rpm for 18 h. 30 S peak was collected, and the subunits were sedimented by ultracentrifugation in Ti70 rotor at 30,000 rpm, for 18 h. Ribosomal RNA was prepared from the ribosomes by SDS/phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. Reverse transcription was performed as described (24Sergiev P.V. Bogdanov A.A. Dahlberg A.E. Dontsova O. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The same procedure was used for preparation of rRNA from ygjO and ycbY knock-out strains. The primer used for reverse transcription was complementary to the 16 S rRNA nucleotides 995-1011. Products of reverse transcription were separated by electrophoresis in the 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and visualized with a phosphorimager. Protein Expression and Purification, in Vivo Methylation Assay—Recombinant RsmD protein was prepared from M15 E. coli cells, harboring pCA24N plasmid with the rsmD(yhhF) gene cloned under control of T5lac promoter (23Kitagawa M. Ara T. Arifuzzaman M. Ioka-Nakamichi T. Inamoto E. Toyonaga H. Mori H. DNA Res. 2005; 12: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in LB medium at 37 °C until A600 0.5 and induced by isopropyl isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, 0.5 mm f.c. After induction, cells were grown for an additional 3 h and lysed by sonication in a buffer of 50 mm TrisCl pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NH4Cl. Protein purification on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) was done in the same buffer, containing 10 mm imidazole. After washing three times with the same buffer containing 30 mm imidazole, the protein was eluted by increasing imidazol concentration up to 200 mm. To eliminate endogenous AdoMet 4The abbreviations used are: AdoMet, S-adenosylomethionine; SAD, single-wavelength anomalous diffraction; PDB, Protein Data Bank. molecule the protein was incubated with 2 mm SAH in the 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NH4Cl for 1 h at 37 °C. Then RsmD protein was dyalized, and its purity was proven by SDS-PAGE. In vitro methylation assay was performed in a buffer containing 50 mm HepesK, pH 7.6, 2.5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 20 mm NH4Cl, 100 mm KCl, 8 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm AdoMet. We used 0.1 pmol of RsmD protein and 15 pmol of either rRNA or 30 S subunits for 50-μl reaction mixture. The reaction was stopped after 1 h at 37 °C. Growth Rate and Growth Competition—Growth rate measurement was performed in LB medium at 37 °C. Three colonies of either the BW25141 parental strain or the rsmD(yhhF) deletion strain were used for inoculation of three independent 5-ml overnight cultures. The next day, each of these cultures was used for inoculation of separate 500-ml containers of fresh LB medium. Initial density of the cultures after inoculation was A600 0.01. Cell growth was monitored by spectrophotometer until stationary phase. A growth competition experiments were performed using LB medium at 30, 37, and 42 °C or in M9 medium at 37 °C. Equal amounts of kanamycin-sensitive BW25141 parental strain and kanamycin-resistant rsmD(yhhF) deletion strain cells were used for simultaneous inoculation of the same 1 ml of LB or M9 medium. At each 24-h growth cycle the medium was diluted 1000-fold, so that 1 ml of the medium with bacteria was transferred into a tube with 1 ml of fresh medium. At the same time, serial dilutions of the bacterial culture were made until a dilution of 1:10-7 was reached. Equal 10-μl aliquots from the diluted cultures were plated to LB agar and LB agar supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg/ml). Plates were incubated at 37 °C overnight, and the colonies were counted and compared. Protein Cloning Expression and Purification for Crystallization—The open reading frame of the rsmD(yhhF) gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from E. coli genomic DNA (ATCC). The gene was cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of a modified pET15b cloning vector (Novagen) in which the tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site replaced the thrombin cleavage site and a double stop codon was introduced downstream from the BamHI site. This construct provides for an N-terminal His6-tag separated from the gene by a tobacco etch virus protease recognition site (ENLYFQG). The fusion protein was overexpressed in E. coli BL21-Gold (DE3) (Stratagene) harboring an extra plasmid encoding three rare tRNAs (AGG and AGA for Arg, ATA for Ile). The cells were grown in LB medium at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6 and protein expression induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After induction, the cells were incubated with shaking overnight at 15 °C. The harvested cells were resuspended in binding buffer (500 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm imidazole), flash-frozen in liquid N2, and stored at -70 °C. The thawed cells were lysed by sonication after the addition of 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 1 mm each of PMSF and benzamidine. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation (30 min at 27,000 × g) and passed through a DE52 column pre-equilibrated in binding buffer. The flow-through fraction was then applied to a metal chelate affinity column charged with Ni2+. The His6-tagged protein was eluted from the column in elution buffer (500 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 250 mm imidazole) and the tag then cleaved from the protein by treatment with recombinant His-tagged tobacco etch virus protease. The cleaved protein was then resolved from the cleaved His6-tag and the His6-tagged protease by flowing the mixture through a second Ni2+ column. The RsmD protein was dialyzed in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, and concentrated using a BioMax concentrator (Millipore). Before crystallization, any particulate matter was removed from the sample by passing through a 0.2-μm Ultrafree-MC centrifugal filter (Millipore). Selenomethionine-enriched protein was produced according to previously described procedure (25O'Gara M. Adams G.M. Gong W. Kobayashi R. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Eur. J.

The reducing reagent tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (0.5 mm) was added to all purification buffers. Protein Crystallization—The protein was crystallized by the vapor diffusion method in hanging drops by mixing 2 μl of the protein solution with 2 μl of 0.2 m sodium tartrate, 20% polyethylene glycol 3350, and equilibrated at 20 °C over 500 μl of this solution. Before data collection, crystals were soaked for 20 s in a cryoprotectant consisting of 10% glycerol, 10% sucrose, and 10% ethylene glycol in the crystal mother liquor and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data Collection—Diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the 19ID beamline of the Structural Biology Center at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) data to 2.05 Aå were collected at selenium-peak wavelength from a selenomethionine substituted protein crystal as described earlier by Walsh et al.

One crystal was used for data collection at 100 K, and a total oscillation range of 360° was obtained using inverse beam geometry. Data were integrated, reduced, and scaled with the HKL2000 suite (28Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38566) Google Scholar).

The parameters of the grid step, repulsion, and attraction double range were equal to 3.4, 10, and 0.5, respectively. The projection was black and white. The best docking model served as a guideline for manual docking of RmsD protein to the entire 16 S RNA molecule using program Coot (35Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23349) Google Scholar). Identification of the Methyltransferase, Specific for G966 of the 16 S rRNA—N2-Methylguanosine specifically interrupts the primer-extension by avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase by impairing the m2G-C Watson-Crick base pair formation in the reverse transcriptase active site. We used the primer-extension method for the detection of the methylation at position G966 of 16 S RNA. Reverse transcription of the 16 S rRNA extracted from the wild type strain stops after the template residue 967 (Fig. 2, lane 1), unable to incorporate dC opposite to the G966, when G966 is methylated at the 2-amino group. Ribosomes were prepared from the strains, carrying disruption of the candidate genes for the G966 methylation: yhhF, ygjO, and ycbY. Ribosomal RNA was isolated and served as a template for reverse transcription. A complete loss of the primer-extension stop correspondent to the m2G966 was observed only for the rRNA, extracted from the strain, harboring the yhhF gene disruption (Fig. 2, lane 2). In contrast to the prediction (17Bujnicki J.M. Rychlewski L. BMC Bioinformatics. 2002; 3: 10Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the ygjO gene of E. coli encodes methtyltransferase that is not responsible for m2G966 formation (Fig. 2, lane 3). Recently, the true ygjO target was identified to be m2G1835 of the 23 S rRNA (41Sergiev P.V. Lesnyak D.V. Bogdanov A.A. Dontsova O.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 25-31Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The G966 modification also remained intact in the rRNA extracted from the ycbY knock-out strain (Fig. 2, lane 4). ycbY encodes another ribosomal m2G methyltransferase, responsible for the 23 S rRNA m2G2445 formation (42Lesnyak D.V. Sergiev P.V. Bogdanov A.A. Dontsova O.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We propose that, according to the accepted nomenclature described in a recent publication on identification of m5C1407 specific methyltransferase (43Andersen N.M. Douthwaite S. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 777-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and previous characterization of partially purified enzymatic activity (13Weitzmann C. Tumminia S.J. Boublik M. Ofengand J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 7089-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the yhhF gene is now to be renamed to rsmD. In Vivo Complementation of the rsmD Gene Inactivation by Supplying the rsmD Gene on the Plasmid—It might be imagined that multiple genes can be inactivated during the PCR-based gene replacement by the kanamycin resistance cassette, surrounded by the homology regions, similar to the ones flanking rsmD gene, or change in the genomic context might influence the surrounding genes. To eliminate a possibility that the change in the DNA region other than rsmD could lead to the loss of G966 methylation, we carried out in vivo complementation experiments. A plasmid, carrying rsmD gene under control of the isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-inducible T5lac promoter (23Kitagawa M. Ara T. Arifuzzaman M. Ioka-Nakamichi T. Inamoto E. Toyonaga H. Mori H. DNA Res. 2005; 12: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar), was introduced to the strain with the chromosome copy of the rsmD gene replaced by the kanamycin resistance gene. Expression of the rsmD gene from the plasmid efficiently complemented chromosomal rsmD gene disruption (Fig. 2, lane 5). Recombinant RsmD Protein Can Methylate G966 in Vitro—Although it was shown that the rsmD gene product is necessary for m2G966 formation, there is still a chance that other genes are also required. To establish that the rsmD gene product is solely responsible for the methylation of the 16 S rRNA G966 residue, we performed in vitro methylation of either 16 S rRNA or 30 S ribosomal subunits by purified recombinant RsmD protein. RsmD protein carrying C-terminal His6 tag was expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography on nickelnitrilotriacetic acid-agarose. The protein was >95% pure according to the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Its molecular mass corresponded to the predicted 22 kDa. Both protein-free ribosomal RNA and ribosomal subunits purified from the strain, defective in the rsmD gene, were tested as in vitro substrates for G966 methylation. The products of methylation were analyzed by reverse transcription. Recombinant RsmD protein efficiently methylated G966 of the assembled 30 S subunits in vitro in the presence of AdoMet (Fig. 2, lane 6). No reverse transcription stop was observed in the absence of AdoMet (Fig. 2, lane 7), giving additional proof that the stop was caused by the methylation but not nucleolytic cleavage. As was shown earlier for partially purified enzymatic activity (13Weitzmann C. Tumminia S.J. Boublik M. Ofengand J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 7089-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), protein-free 16 S rRNA was not a substrate for RsmD (Fig. 2, lane 8). Influence of the 16 S rRNA G966 Methylation on the Growth of E. coli Cells—Doubling time of the strain JW3430 (21Baba T. Ara T. Hasegawa M. Takai Y. Okumura Y. Baba M. Datsenko K.A. Tomita M. Wanner B.L. Mori H. Mol. Systems Biol. 2006; 2: 2006-2008Crossref Scopus (5409) Google Scholar), carrying the inactive rsmD gene (42 ± 1 min), was essentially the same as that of the parental (22Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11190) Google Scholar) E. coli strain BW25141 (41 ± 1 min). To distinguish slight variations in the growth characteristics, we performed a growth competition assay. Equal numbers of the kanamycin-sensitive parental strain cells and kanamycin-resistant rsmD knock-out strain cells (A600 0.001) were mixed and incubated for 24 h at 30, 37, and 42 °C in rich LB or minimal M9 medium (37 °C only). At the end of the growth cycle 1/1000th of the medium containing the mixture of the cells was used for inoculation of the fresh portion of LB or M9 at 1000 times dilution. The cells amplify 1000-fold at each growth cycle or undergo ∼10 doublings. After each growth cycle, the cells were serially diluted and plated on either LB agar or LB agar plates supplemented with kanamycin. Kanamycin-resistant cell titer related to the total cell titer is presented (Fig. 3). The decrease of rsmD knock-out cell proportion in the mixture was very slow, but detectable, and suggests that G966 modification modestly affects cell fitness. In M9 minimal medium no disadvantage of the yhhF knock-out strain was detected over 80 cell doublings. Structure of RsmD rRNA Methyltransferase—The structure of RsmD protein (198 amino acids) (Fig. 4, A and B) has been determined by the SAD method and refined to 2.05 Aå (Table 1). The protein crystallizes with six molecules in the asymmetric unit, providing a total of 18 selenium sites for use in phasi"
https://openalex.org/W2078359816,"The neuropilin-1 (np1) receptor binds the 165 amino-acid form of vascular endothelial growth factor165 (VEGF165) and functions as an enhancer that potentiates VEGF165 signaling via the VEGFR-2 tyrosine-kinase receptor. To study the mechanism by which neuropilins potentiate VEGF activity we produced a VEGF165 mutant (VEGF165KF) that binds to neuropilins but displays a much lower affinity toward VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2. VEGF165KF failed to induce VEGFR-2 phosphorylation in cells lacking neuropilins. However, in the presence of np1, VEGF165KF bound weakly to VEGFR-2, induced VEGFR-2 phosphorylation, and activated ERK1/2. Interestingly, VEGF165KF did not promote formation of VEGFR-2/np1 complexes nor did high concentrations of VEGF165KF inhibit VEGF165 induced formation of such complexes, suggesting that VEGF165 does not stabilize VEGFR-2/np1 complexes by forming bridges spanning VEGFR-2 and np1. VEGF121 is a VEGF form that does not bind to neuropilins. Surprisingly, both np1 and neuropilin-2 (np2) enhanced VEGF121-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and VEGF121-induced proliferation of endothelial cells. The enhancement of VEGF121 activity by np1 was accompanied by a 10-fold increase in binding affinity to VEGFR-2 and was not associated with the formation of new VEGFR-2/np1 complexes. These observations suggest that neuropilins enhance the activity of VEGF forms that do not bind to neuropilins, indicate that np2 is a functional VEGF receptor, and imply that spontaneously formed VEGFR-2/np1 complexes suffice for efficient neuropilin mediated enhancement of VEGF activity."
https://openalex.org/W2072612511,"Wide variation in glucocorticoid (Gc) sensitivity exists between individuals which may influence susceptibility to, and treatment response of, inflammatory diseases. To determine a genetic fingerprint of Gc sensitivity 100 healthy human volunteers were polarized into the 10% most Gc-sensitive and 10% most Gc-resistant following a low dose dexamethasone (0.25 mg) suppression test. Gene expression profiling of primary lymphocytes identified the 98 most significantly Gc regulated genes. These genes were used to build a subnetwork of Gc signaling, with 54 genes mapping as nodes, and 6 non-Gc regulated genes inferred as signaling nodes. Twenty four of the 98 genes showed a difference in Gc response in vitro dependent on the Gc sensitivity of their donor individuals in vivo. A predictive model was built using both partial least squares discriminate analysis and support vector machines that predicted donor glucocorticoid sensitivity with 87% accuracy. Discriminating genes included bone morphogenetic protein receptor, type II (BMPRII). Transfection studies showed that BMPRII modulated Gc action. These studies reveal a broad base of gene expression that predicts Gc sensitivity and determine a Gc signaling network in human primary T lymphocytes. Furthermore, this combined gene profiling, and functional analysis approach has identified BMPRII as a modulator of Gc signaling."

Recently, we confirmed a role for the mouse ortholog of the protective allele (mt-Nd2a) in resistance to T1D using genetic analysis of outcrosses between T1D-resistant ALR and T1D-susceptible NOD mice. We sought to determine the mechanism of disease protection by elucidating whether mt-Nd2a affects basal mitochondrial function or mitochondrial function in the presence of oxidative stress. Two lines of reciprocal conplastic mouse strains were generated: one with ALR nuclear DNA and NOD mtDNA (ALR.mtNOD) and the reciprocal with NOD nuclear DNA and ALR mtDNA (NOD.mtALR). Basal mitochondrial respiration, transmembrane potential, and electron transport system enzymatic activities showed no difference among the strains. However, ALR.mtNOD mitochondria supported by either complex I or complex II substrates produced significantly more reactive oxygen species when compared with both parental strains, NOD.mtALR or C57BL/6 controls. Nitric oxide inhibited respiration to a similar extent for mitochondria from the five strains due to competitive antagonism with molecular oxygen at complex IV. Superoxide and hydrogen peroxide generated by xanthine oxidase did not significantly decrease complex I function. The protein nitrating agents peroxynitrite or nitrogen dioxide radicals significantly decreased complex I function but with no significant difference among the five strains. In summary, mt-Nd2a does not confer elevated resistance to oxidative stress; however, it plays a critical role in the control of the mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the mtDNA have been associated with degenerative diseases and various cancers. Yet sequence changes may also result in resistance to disease. Indeed, a cytosine to adenine transversion (C5178A) resulting in a leucine to methionine substitution in the human NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 gene (mt-ND2) encoded in the mtDNA has been associated with increased longevity (1Yao Y.G. Kong Q.P. Zhang Y.P. Hum. Genet. 2002; 111: 462-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 2Tanaka M. Gong J.S. Zhang J. Yoneda M. Yagi K.

Okada T. Gong J.S. Yamada Y. Iwamoto Y. Tanaka M. Diabetes Care. 2002; 25: 2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The adenine-containing allele, mt-ND2a (adenine containing NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 allele), was also associated with reduced islet autoimmunity as represented by significantly lower titers of autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase, insulin, and protein-tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type N (Ptprn or IA-2) (6Uchigata Y. Okada T. Gong J.S. Yamada Y. Iwamoto Y. Tanaka M. Diabetes Care. 2002; 25: 2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Insulin synthetic and secretory capacities of pancreatic β cells are highly dependent upon communication between the nucleus and the mitochondria (7Silva J.P. Kohler M. Graff C. Oldfors A. Magnuson M.A. Berggren P.O. Larsson N.G. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 336-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) and are reliant upon mitochondrial ATP generation (8Wollheim C.B. Maechler P. Diabetes. 2002; 51 (Suppl. 1): 37-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although mitochondria are critical for the life and function of β cells, there is strong evidence that mitochondria play a central role in apoptotic death of the β cell during autoimmune T1D (9Barnhart B.C.

Therefore, sequence variation in the mtDNA may have profound effects on the β cell, both in life and death. The function of ND2 is not clearly understood. Studies of Escherichia coli complex I have established that the bacterial ortholog of ND2, NuoN, folds into one of the many α-helices in the membrane arm of complex I (17Friedrich T. Abelmann A. Brors B. Guenebaut V. Kintscher L. Leonard K. Rasmussen T. Scheide D. Schlitt A. Schulte U. Weiss H. Biochem. Biophys.

The current understanding of the mechanism of complex I suggests that ND2 is involved in proton translocation across the inner mitochondrial membrane (17Friedrich T. Abelmann A. Brors B. Guenebaut V.

Biomembr. 2001; 33: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and its protein sequence shows similarity to an antiporter that is critical in pH regulation (20Mathiesen C. Haögerhaöll C. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). ND2 is a hydrophobic subunit of complex I that has been conserved through the course of evolution from bacteria to mice to humans (22Gabaldon T.R.D. Huynen M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 857-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Recently, our group has confirmed a role for NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 gene (mt-Nd2) in resistance to diabetes using crosses of the T1D-prone non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse strain to the alloxan-resistant (ALR) mouse strain (23Mathews C.E. Leiter E.H. Spirina O. Bykhovskaya Y. Gusdon A.M. Ringquist S. Fischel-Ghodsian N. Diabetologia. 2005; 48: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Reciprocal backcross populations were generated with identical nuclear DNA but either ALR or NOD mtDNA. Spontaneous T1D incidence was 4-fold lower in the backcross population with ALR mtDNA than in the backcross population with NOD mtDNA (23Mathews C.E. Leiter E.H. Spirina O. Bykhovskaya Y. Gusdon A.M. Ringquist S. Fischel-Ghodsian N. Diabetologia. 2005; 48: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In both man and mouse the “A”-containing allele, mt-ND2a or mt-Nd2a, respectively, resulted in a leucine to methionine amino acid substitution and contributed to T1D resistance. ALR mice, which encode mt-Nd2a, resist both chemically induced and autoimmune T1D. Along with mt-Nd2a, loci contributing to T1D resistance have been mapped to chromosomes 3, 8, and 17 (24Mathews C.E. Graser R.T. Bagley R.J. Caldwell J.W. Li R. Churchill G.A. Serreze D.V. Leiter E.H. Immunogenetics. 2003; 55: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). ALR mice were bred specifically for their resistance to the diabetogen alloxan, which selectively destroys β cells through the generation of hydroxyl radicals (25Sekiguchi F. Ishibashi K. Katoh H. Kawamoto Y. Ino T. Exp. Anim. (Tokyo). 1990; 39: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Biochemical analyses have revealed that in comparison with the NOD or co-selected alloxan-susceptible (ALS) strain, ALR mice contain elevated reduced to oxidized GSH in the liver and islets, as well as elevated activity of superoxide dismutase in the liver and islets, and elevated activity of glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase in islets (26Mathews C.E. Leiter E.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 27Mathews C.E. Graser R.T. Savinov A.Y. Serreze D.V. Leiter E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 2001; 98: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The destruction of β cells during T1D pathogenesis has been characterized by increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and attenuated antioxidant defenses, including decreased levels of GSH and gradually reduced catalase, superoxide dismutase, and thioredoxin transcripts (28Buttke T. Sandstrom P.A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 7-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2104) Google Scholar, 29Briehl M.M. Cotgreave I.A. Powis G. Cell Death Differ. 1995; 2: 41-46PubMed Google Scholar, 30Briehl M.M. Baker A.F. Cell Death Differ. 1996; 3: 63-70PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been suggested that increased redox potential in β cells may inhibit T1D by protecting β cells from apoptosis (27Mathews C.E. Graser R.T. Savinov A.Y. Serreze D.V. Leiter E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 2001; 98: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 31Mathews C.E. Leiter E.H.

Immunol. 2005; 175: 1248-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Indeed, GSH, superoxide dismutase, and thioredoxin have been shown to block the actions of signal-regulating kinase, AP-1, and NF-κB, thereby inhibiting apoptosis (33Ho E. Chen G.M. Bray T.M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1845-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 34Lizard G. Gueldry S. Sordet O. Monier S. Athias A. Miguet C. Bessede G. Lemaire S. Solary E. Gambert P.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2092) Google Scholar). Mitochondria are both generators (36Genova M.L. Pich M.M. Biondi A. Bernacchia A. Falasca A. Bovina C. Formiggini G. Castelli G.P. Lenaz G. Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood). 2003; 228: 506-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and important targets of ROS (37Nomura K. Imai H. Koumura T. Nakagawa Y. Biol. Signals Recept. 2001; 10: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this context, it has been proposed that mt-Nd2a imparts upon the mitochondria an increased resistance to oxidative stress (6Uchigata Y. Okada T. Gong J.S. Yamada Y. Iwamoto Y. Tanaka M. Diabetes Care. 2002; 25: 2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) as many of the diseases against which mt-ND2a imparts resistance, such as aging and T1D, have been associated with ROS damage. In support of the hypothesis that mt-Nd2a results in elevated resistance to oxidative stress, Turko et al. (38Turko I.V. Li L. Aulak K.S. Stuehr D.J. Chang J.Y. Murad F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33972-33977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) have reported that complex I enzymatic activity of ALR was not affected by free radicals, although the same treatments reduced complex I activity in ALS by ∼50%. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of mt-Nd2a on basal mitochondrial function as well as on mitochondrial function in the presence of oxidative stress to further characterize its role in the protection against T1D. To study the specific role of mt-Nd2a, two lines of reciprocal conplastic mouse strains (CS) were developed, one with ALR nuclear DNA and NOD mtDNA (ALR.mtNOD) and one with NOD nuclear DNA and ALR mtDNA (NOD.mtALR). By combining mt-Nd2a with NOD nuclear DNA, the effects of this allele could be considered separately from the protective effects of the nuclear genome of ALR. Here we assess basal mitochondrial functions and determine the resistance of mitochondria to free radicals. We find that mt-Nd2a does not confer elevated resistance to oxidative stress. However, mt-Nd2a suppresses mitochondrial ROS production. Mice—ALR/LtJ, NOD/LtJ, and C57BL/6J (B6) mice were bred and maintained in the animal research facility at the Rangos Research Center, Pittsburgh, PA. Conplastic strains of mice, NOD/LtJ-mtALR/LtJ/Mx (NOD.mtALR) and ALR/LtJ-mtNOD/LtDvs/Mx (ALR.mtNOD), were generated as described below. All mice were bred and maintained in a specific pathogen-free vivarium and allowed free access to food (autoclaved diet NIH-31, 6% fat, PMI, St. Louis, MO) and acidified drinking water. All procedures involving animals were approved by the Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh and were in compliance with “Principles of Laboratory Animal Care” and the current laws of the United States. Reagents—All reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Generation of Reciprocal Conplastic Strains of Mice—Lines of reciprocal CS mice were generated to determine the role of mt-Nd2a in resistance to T1D and for any possible effects on mitochondrial function. Strains with ALR nuclear DNA and NOD mtDNA (ALR.mtNOD) or with NOD nuclear DNA and ALR mtDNA (NOD.mtALR) were generated as described previously (39Pomerleau D.P. Bagley R.J. Serreze D.V. Mathews C.E. Leiter E.H. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 1603-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Because mtDNA is inherited exclusively from the egg, only female breeders with the appropriate mtDNA were employed. The generation of ALR.mtNOD CS utilized an F1 outcross of ALR males to NOD females resulting in F1 progeny with NOD mtDNA. Females of this outcross were then backcrossed to ALR males for 10 generations, allowing for continued inheritance of the NOD mtDNA. Conversely, to generate NOD.mtALR CS, NOD males were outcrossed to ALR females resulting in F1 progeny with ALR mtDNA. At each generation females were backcrossed to NOD males until the 10th backcross generation and then intercrossed. Single nucleotide polymorphism typing was conducted to determine the mt-Nd2 allele in the CS as described (23Mathews C.E. Leiter E.H. Spirina O. Bykhovskaya Y. Gusdon A.M. Ringquist S. Fischel-Ghodsian N. Diabetologia. 2005; 48: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To preclude nuclear DNA contamination in the CS mice, genotyping was performed by PCR amplification of 94 polymorphic microsatellite primers (Invitrogen) covering all 19 autosomes (24Mathews C.E. Graser R.T. Bagley R.J. Caldwell J.W. Li R. Churchill G.A. Serreze D.V. Leiter E.H. Immunogenetics. 2003; 55: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (supplemental Table). Liver Mitochondrial Isolation—Livers were removed and homogenized in ice-cold isolation buffer (IB) I (225 mm mannitol, 75 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES potassium salt, 0.10% bovine serum albumin, fatty acid-free, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,300 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was transferred into new tubes, diluted with IB I, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in IB II (225 mm mannitol, 75 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES potassium salt, and 100 μm EDTA, pH 7.4) and spun at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in ∼100 μl of IBII. Brain Mitochondrial Isolation—Brains were removed, homogenized in ice-cold 12% Percoll in IB I, layered on top of a gradient of 24 and 42% Percoll, and centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 10 min. The mitochondrial fraction was removed with a syringe, diluted with IB I, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in IB II and spun at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was again discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in ∼100 μl of IB II. Protein concentration of both liver and brain mitochondria was determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Mitochondrial Respiration—Mitochondria (1.6 mg/ml) were incubated in media containing 125 mm KCl, 2 mm K2HPO4, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 μm EGTA, pH 7.1 (IM). To assay respiration through complex I, the assay medium was supplemented with 5 mml-glutamate and 5 mml-malate. To assay respiration through complex II, the assay medium was supplemented with 5 mm succinate. State 3 respiration was stimulated by the addition of 1.81 mm ADP. The respiratory control ratio was calculated by dividing state 3 respiration rates by state 4 respiration rates. Mitochondrial respiration was determined using a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Hansatech Instruments Ltd., Norfolk, UK). Assays were performed at 37 °C with constant stirring. Individual Mitochondrial Electron Transport Chain Complex Enzymatic Activity Assays—For each assay, mitochondria samples were subjected to membrane disruption by freeze-thawing. All assays were run at 30 °C. The activity of complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) was determined by monitoring the oxidation of NADH at 340 nm. The assay medium contained potassium phosphate (25 mm, pH 7.2 at 20 °C), 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (fraction V), and 2 mm KCN. A base line was established for 1 min after the addition of 0.13 mm NADH, 65 μm ubiquinone1, and 2 μg/ml antimycin A. The reaction was initiated by the addition of mitochondria (200 μg/ml), and the rate of oxidation of NADH was recorded for 3 min. Rotenone (2 μg/ml) was then added, and the rate of change in absorbance was measured for an additional 3 min. Complex I activity was determined by subtracting the rotenone insensitive activity from the total activity. The activity of complex II (succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductace) was determined by monitoring the reduction of 2,6-dichloroindophenolate at 600 nm. The assay medium contained potassium phosphate (25 mm, pH 7.2 at 20 °C), 5 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm sodium succinate. Mitochondria (40 μg/ml) were incubated in the assay medium at 30 °C for 10 min. A base line was recorded for 1 min after the addition of 2 μg/ml antimycin A, 2 μg/ml rotenone, 2 mm KCN, and 50 μm 2,6-dichloroindophenolate. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 65 μm ubiquinone1, and the rate of reduction of 2,6-dichloroindophenolate was recorded for 3 min (40Birch-Machin M. Turnbull D.M. Pon L. Schon E.A. Mitochondria. 2001Google Scholar). The activity of complex III (cytochrome c reductase) was determined by monitoring the reduction of ferricytochrome c at 550 nm. The assay medium contained potassium phosphate (25 mm, pH 7.2 at 20 °C), 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (fraction V), and 2 mm KCN. KCN was included in the assay media to prevent the reoxidation of the product, ferrocytochrome c, by cytochrome c oxidase. Nonenzymatic activity was recorded for 1 min after the addition of 15 μm ferricytochrome c, 2 μg/ml rotenone, 0.6 mm dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, and 35 μm ubiquionol. Ubuiquinol was prepared by dissolving 8 μg of ubiquinone in 1 ml of ethanol; the solution was adjusted to pH 2 with 6 m HCl. Ubiquinone was reduced using excess sodium borohydride. Ubiquinol was extracted into 2:1 (v/v) diethyl ether/cyclohexane, evaporated under nitrogen gas, dissolved in 1 ml of ethanol, and acidified to pH 2 with 6 m HCl. The complex III activity assay was initiated by the addition of mitochondria (100 μg/ml), and the rate of reduction of ferricytochrome c to ferrocytochrome c was recorded for 1 min. The activity quickly became nonlinear, and the rate was calculated based on the linear first 10 s. In replicate wells, 2 μg/ml antimycin A was added, and the complex III specific activity was calculated by subtracting the antimycin A insensitive activity from the total activity (40Birch-Machin M. Turnbull D.M. Pon L. Schon E.A. Mitochondria. 2001Google Scholar). Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) activity was determined by monitoring the oxidation of ferrocytochrome c at 550 nm. The assay medium contained 10 mm Tris-HCl and 120 mm KCl, pH 7.0. The nonenzymatic rate was recorded for 1 min after the addition of 2 μg/ml antimycin A, 0.45 mm dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, and mitochondria (2.5 μg/ml). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 11 μm ferrocytochrome c, and the rate of oxidation of ferrocytochrome c to ferricytochrome c was measured for 3 min. The activity quickly became nonlinear, and the rate was calculated based on the linear first 30s. In replicate wells, 2 μg/ml KCN was added, and the complex IV specific activity was calculated by subtracting the KCN insensitive activity from the total activity. Ferrocytochrome c was prepared by reducing ferricytochrome c with 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (40Birch-Machin M. Turnbull D.M. Pon L. Schon E.A. Mitochondria. 2001Google Scholar). Mitochondrial Membrane Potential and ROS Production—Membrane potential and free radical production were measured by fluorescence using a Shimadzu RF-5301 spectrofluorimeter (Kyoto, Japan) as described previously (41Votyakova T.V. Reynolds I.J. J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 526-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). All assays were performed with 350 μg of mitochondrial protein suspended in IM plus 5 mml-glutamate and 5 mml-malate or 5 mm succinate with constant stirring at 37 °C. ROS production was measured using 2 μm fluorescent Amplex Red dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in the presence of 1 unit/ml horseradish peroxidase. The excitation wavelength was 560 nm (slit 1.5 nm), and the emission wavelength was 590 nm (slit 3 nm). Mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Δψm) was measured using the fluorescence quenching of the cationic dye safranin O (2.5 μm). The excitation wavelength was 495 nm (slit 3 nm), and the emission wavelength was 586 nm (slit 10 nm). Free Radical Treatment for Mitochondrial Respiration—Mitochondrial respiration was assayed as described above. Approximately 30 s after the addition of ADP, 15 μm nitric oxide (NO) was added using the NO donor diethylamine NONOate (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). Percent oxygen consumption was calculated by comparing chamber oxygen content at the time of NO addition to the chamber oxygen content 1.5 min after the addition of NO. Calculations were based on the percent of control oxygen consumption. To test whether the effect of NO was reversible, bovine hemoglobin (1.32 mg/ml) was added after 5 min of incubation with 15 μm NO. Free Radical Treatment for Complex I Enzymatic Activity Assay—Mitochondria were treated with either a 3 mm bolus of NO donated by diethylamine NONOate or a 1 μm steady-state level of NO donated by DETA-NONOate (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) for 2 h. Mitochondria were treated with hydrogen peroxide and superoxide generated by 100 μm xanthine and 20 milliunits of xanthine oxidase and incubated for 2 h. Control samples were treated with xanthine without xanthine oxidase. Peroxynitrite or heme peroxidase-dependent reactions were employed to facilitate protein nitration. Mitochondria were treated with 0.25, 0.50, or 1.00 mm peroxynitrite (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) and incubated for 1 h. Controls were treated with the equivalent concentration of degraded peroxynitrite. Mitochondria were treated with 200 μg/ml glucose and 60 μg/ml or 40 ng/ml glucose oxidase (to generate H2O2) in the presence of 0.5 mm sodium nitrite and 100 nm myeloperoxidase and incubated for 1 h. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide, myeloperoxidase has been shown previously to oxidize nitrite to the nitrogen dioxide radical, which is capable of nitrating phenolic protein residues (42van der Vliet A. Eiserich J.P. Halliwell B. Cross C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7617-7625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Controls were treated with glucose, sodium nitrite, and myeloperoxidase without glucose oxidase. Complex I enzymatic activity was assayed as described above following incubations with each free radical generator. Free Radical Treatment for Complex IV Enzymatic Activity Assay—Mitochondria were incubated with 15 μm NO donated by diethylamine NONOate and incubated for 1 h. Complex IV enzymatic activity was assayed as described above following this incubation period. Statistical Analysis—All values reported are of at least n = 3. Significance was determined by one-way analysis of variance using Graphpad Prism 4 for Windows (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Typing for Conplastic Strains—Pyrosequencing was performed for the A4738C single nucleotide polymorphism to confirm the presence of the mt-Nd2 allele in both CS. The pyrograms from ALR (supplemental Fig. A) and NOD.mtALR (supplemental Fig. C) were equivalent and demonstrated the presence of the mt-Nd2a allele. NOD (supplemental Fig. B) and ALR.mtNOD (supplemental Fig. D) both contained the mt-Ndc allele. Typing with a panel of microsatellite markers that discriminate ALR from NOD DNA (24Mathews C.E. Graser R.T. Bagley R.J. Caldwell J.W. Li R. Churchill G.A. Serreze D.V. Leiter E.H. Immunogenetics. 2003; 55: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was performed from N1 to N7 to confirm the elimination of nuclear DNA contamination in both CS. We did not detect NOD nuclear DNA contamination in the ALR.mtNOD after generation N6. Likewise, ALR nuclear DNA contamination in the NOD.mtALR in mice after the N5 generation was undetectable. Basal Mitochondrial Enzymatic Activities, Respiration, and Transmembrane Potential—To discern effects of the two mt-Nd2 alleles on basal mitochondrial function, the mitochondrial ETS was assayed. As shown in Table 1, no differences were measured in enzymatic activities of complexes I–IV when comparing ALR, NOD, B6, NOD.mtALR, and ALR.mtNOD. Basal mitochondrial respiration supported by complex I or complex II substrates was also assayed (Table 2). State 4 respiration was measured after the addition of mitochondria to the chamber, and state 3 respiration was measured after the addition of ADP. Among the five strains, no differences were detected in either state 4 respiration, state 3 respiration, or the respiratory control ratio (rate of state 3 respiration divided by rate of state 4 respiration) while respiring via complex I or complex II (Table 2).

Here we demonstrate cooperativity between two transcription factors, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and nuclear factor 1 (NF1) to bind the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter organized as regular chromatin in vivo. This cooperativity is not observed when the promoter is introduced transiently into cells. Using RNA interference to deplete NF1 protein levels in the cells, we confirmed that NF1 promotes binding of GR to the promoter. Furthermore, we observed a similar synergism between GR and NF1 binding on the endogenous 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase promoter, also regulated by GR and NF1. Our results suggest that the chromatin architecture of the promoters does not permit strong association of GR in the absence of NF1. Therefore we propose that cooperativity among DNA binding factors in binding to their cognate recognition sites in chromatin may be an important feature in the regulation of gene expression.

Therefore we propose that cooperativity among DNA binding factors in binding to their cognate recognition sites in chromatin may be an important feature in the regulation of gene expression. Eukaryotic DNA is condensed and highly compacted into chromatin, which allows multiple levels of transcriptional regulation (1Wolffe A.P. Guschin D. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 129: 102-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Chromatin architecture can inhibit transcription by preventing the access of transacting factors to their binding sites on the DNA (2Narlikar G.J. Fan H.Y. Kingston R.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which transcription factors access their cognate binding sites buried in the nucleosome is not clear. Chromatin modifying enzymes such as the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors are known to aid unwrapping or translocation of DNA on the nucleosomes such that binding sites for transcription factors are exposed (3Langst G. Becker P.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1677: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that remodeling complexes may be recruited to the target promoters by site-specific DNA binding proteins, which initially engage their target sites (4Peterson C.L. Workman J.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). One such class of transcription factors is the steroid hormone receptors that can interact with the repressive chromatin structure and remodel the chromatin by recruiting chromatin-remodeling complexes to eventually allow other transcription factors to bind (5Hager G.L. Fletcher T.M. Xiao N. Baumann C.T. Muller W.G. McNally J.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The hormone-inducible mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) 2The abbreviations used are: MMTV, mouse mammary tumor virus; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; HRE, hormone response element; NF1, nuclear factor 1; BRG1, brahma-related gene 1; 11βHSD2, 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2; sgk, serum/glucocorticoid inducible kinase; OTF, octamer transcription factor; dex, dexamethasone; WT, wild-type; mNF1, mutation in NF1 binding site; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. promoter has been used extensively as a model to study the relationship between chromatin structure and transcriptional activation by the steroid hormone receptors (6Hebbar P.B. Archer T.K. Chromosoma. 2003; 111: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). When stably integrated into mammalian cells, MMTV promoter assumes a phased array of six nucleosomes (A to F). The minimal promoter is made up of nucleosomes A and B, which encompasses binding sites for glucocorticoid receptor (GR) hormone response elements (HREs), nuclear factor 1 (NF1), octamer transcription factor (OTF), and the transcription factor IID complex. In the absence of hormone, the chromatin architecture of the promoter excludes the binding of NF1 and OTFs. Upon hormone administration, GR recruits ATP-dependent BRG1 remodeling complex and multiple coactivator proteins to the promoter to remodel the chromatin (7Trotter K.W. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3347-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This remodeling or “opening” of the promoter permits binding of NF1 and OTFs, which eventually leads to the assembly of a transcription initiation complex and the subsequent induction of mRNA (6Hebbar P.B. Archer T.K. Chromosoma. 2003; 111: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Previously we established that NF1 protein is required for both transcription and chromatin remodeling of the MMTV promoter (8Hebbar P.B. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 887-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we demonstrated that NF1 promotes the binding of GR with the stably integrated promoter. This synergism in binding by transcription factors may be a common occurrence on regulatory regions in the genome. Indeed, most eukaryotic promoter regions contain binding sites for several DNA-binding proteins, which probably allows multiple levels and combinatorial control of gene expression (9Miller J.A. Widom J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1623-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Therefore we wanted to investigate the role of cooperative binding by transcription factors to their cognate binding sites within an in vivo chromatin context. In this study, we report that cooperative binding by GR and NF1 is observed only in the context of chromatin because the synergism in binding is absent on a transiently transfected promoter. We confirmed these results by using RNA interference to deplete NF1 protein levels in the cell followed by assessment of GR binding to the promoter. Furthermore we show that GR and NF1 cooperativity is not unique to the MMTV promoter but is also observed on the GR-regulated 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11βHSD2) promoter. Plasmids—pLS-WT (wild-type MMTV promoter) and pmNF1 (mNF1, MMTV promoter with mutation in NF1 binding site) plasmids have the promoter fused to thymidine kinase gene as reporter (8Hebbar P.B. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 887-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfections—WT (stably integrated pLS-WT construct) and mNF1 (stably integrated pmNF1 construct) cell lines were derived from C127 mouse mammary carcinoma cells, which were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 10 mm HEPES, and 600 μg of G418/ml (8Hebbar P.B. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 887-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). MCF7M cells were derived from human breast cancer cells MCF7 (10Kinyamu H.K. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5867-5881Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). These cells contained stably integrated copies of MMTV promoter fused to luciferase gene in the genome and overexpressed rat GR. MCF7M cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg of penicillin-streptomycin/ml, 10 mm HEPES, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 300 μg of G418/ml. Cells were treated with a synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (dex) (10-7 M). Transient transfections were performed by the Lipofectamine PLUS method (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. For knockdown of NF1 mRNA, cells were transfected with NF1-C siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), control lamin A/C-specific siRNA, or control non-targeting siRNA (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) for 48 h using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and ReChIP Assays—Cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 20 min. ChIP analysis was carried out as described previously (8Hebbar P.B. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 887-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Antibodies used for ChIP assay were: GR antibody (M20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), human GR (N499) (Keith Yamamoto, University of California, San Francisco, CA), NF1 (H300) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), NF1-C-specific (8199) (Naoko Tanese, New York University School of Medicine, NY), and normal serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After immunoprecipitation, the eluted samples were reverse cross-linked for 12 h at 65 °C, treated with proteinase K (Invitrogen), and purified using PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). ReChIP assay was performed following the protocol described (11Metivier R. Penot G. Hubner M.R. Reid G. Brand H. Kos M. Gannon F. Cell. 2003; 115: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar). For reChIP assays, to perform the first ChIP, nuclei were isolated after formaldehyde cross-linking, and the complexes were eluted with 50 μl of 10 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 30 min. The eluted complex was diluted 20 times with the reChIP buffer (1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and the ChIP procedure was repeated again. Real-time PCR was performed on ChIP DNA samples using real-time PCR primers. For MMTV promoter (nucleosome B region), primer pair 5′-GGT TAC AAA CTG TTC TTA AAA CGA GGA T-3′ and 5′-CAG AGC TCA GAT CAG AAC CTT TGA-3′ was used. Human serum/glucocorticoid inducible kinase (sgk) promoter was amplified with 5′-CCC CTC CCT TCG CTT GTT-3′ and 5′-GGA AGA AGT ACA ATC TGC ATT TCA CT-3′ primer set, and human 11βHSD2 promoter was amplified with 5′-CAC ACA CCC TCC TCA TTC AAG TC-3′ and CTC TGG GTG GAG GAC CAA TTT-3′ primer pair. Western Blot Analysis—After the cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline, they were pelleted by centrifugation. For whole-cell extracts, cells were lysed with buffer X (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 250 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO). Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (12Kinyamu H.K. Fryer C.J. Horwitz K.B. Archer T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20061-20068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pelleted nuclei were resuspended in buffer X and lysed by 15-min incubation with agitation at 4 °C. The supernatant was recovered by centrifugation at 12,500 rpm for 10 min on a bench-top refrigerated microfuge. 50 μg of protein was resolved by 6–8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)— Cells were treated or untreated for 4 h with dex (10-7 m), and total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. For the RT-PCR, cDNA was synthesized as described previously (13Fryer C.J. Nordeen S.K. Archer T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1175-1183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and real-time PCR was performed using SYBR Green (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with the following pairs of primers. For MMTV-luciferase mRNA, primers 5′-CCG CTC GTC ACT TAT CCT TCA-3′ and 5′-ATT TTA CCA ACA GTA CCG GAA TGC-3′ were used. NF1 isoform-specific primer pairs for NF1-A mRNA, 5′-CCA CAC TGA AGA AGT CGG AGA A-3′ and 5′-TCC CAG GGA GGA GGT CTG T-3′; for NF1-B mRNA, 5′-TGG CAC GAA AGA GAT CAA GAT ATG T-3′ and 5′-GAG ATG CAG AGC TGA ACA ATG G-3′; for NF1-C mRNA, AGG ACA TGG AAG GAG GCA TCT-3′ and CGG GCT GTT GAA TGG TGA CT-3′; and for NF1-X mRNA, 5′-CAG CAA GGA GAT GCG GAC AT-3′ and 5′-CCA GAT CCG TCA CAT TCC A-3′ were used. Human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA was amplified with the primer pair 5′-TCG GAG TCA ACG GAT TTG G-3′ and 5′-GGC AAC AAT ATC CAC TTT ACC AGA GT-3′, and human lamin A/C mRNA was amplified with primer sequences 5′-ATG ATC GCT TGG CGG TCT AC-3′ and 5′-GCC CTG CGT TCT CCG TTT-3′. For sgk mRNA, primer pair 5′-ATC TCG CAC CTG AGG TGC TT-3′ and 5′-GCA GGC CAT ACA GCA TCT CAT-3′ and for 11βHSD2 mRNA, primers 5′-ACA TTA GCC GCG TGC TAG AGT T-3′ and 5′-ATT GTG GCC TGC GTT GTT G-3′ were used. In Vivo Restriction Enzyme Hypersensitivity Assay—Nuclei were isolated as described previously (14Archer T.K. Lee H.L. Methods. 1997; 11: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and digested with SstI (100 units/ml). DNA was purified and then digested to completion with HaeIII. The samples were amplified by reiterative primer extension 32P-labeled (oligo-22, 5′-TCT GGA AAG TGA AGG ATA AGT GAC GA-3′), and the products were separated on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The gels were exposed to PhosphorImager screens for analysis. GR Requires an Intact NF1 Binding Site to Bind to an Integrated MMTV Template but Not a Transiently Transfected Template—Previous studies with the stably integrated MMTV promoter have shown that binding of NF1 is hormone-dependent (6Hebbar P.B. Archer T.K. Chromosoma. 2003; 111: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We demonstrated previously that binding of GR to the stably integrated promoter is dependent on NF1 binding (8Hebbar P.B. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 887-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To begin to investigate this interdependency of GR and NF1 for binding their recognition sites, we first examined the potential contribution of promoter chromatin architecture. We tested the binding of GR to the transiently transfected MMTV promoter in the absence of NF1 binding. It has been shown earlier that in contrast to the stably integrated template, when MMTV promoter DNA is introduced transiently into cells, the DNA fails to acquire the same phased array of nucleosomes (15Archer T.K. Lefebvre P. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Science. 1992; 255: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The transient MMTV promoter permits constitutive binding of NF1 but despite the apparent open conformation of the transient template, the promoter remains hormone-inducible. We transiently transfected the wild-type MMTV promoter constructs and a construct with mutation in NF1 binding site (mNF1) into MCF7M cells (10Kinyamu H.K. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5867-5881Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). As illustrated in the schematic, the MMTV promoter contains four HREs; all located within nucleosome B of the phased array. The NF1 binding site also resides within nucleosome B extending to the linker region with nucleosome A (Fig. 1A). We then performed a series of ChIP assays using an anti-GR antibody and specific primers amplifying the nucleosome B region of the MMTV promoter (Fig. 1A). For stable template, we performed ChIP assay to detect GR binding on integrated copies of MMTV promoter in WT and mNF1 cell lines. As shown previously, on the stable template the binding of GR is dependent on NF1 binding (Fig. 1B) (8Hebbar P.B. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 887-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast to what we observe on the stable template, the binding of GR to the transiently transfected promoter is not affected by the mutation in NF1 binding site (Fig. 1C). Therefore the requirement for a functional NF1 bind site to allow GR binding is observed only on the stably integrated promoter. Consistent with this idea, in the absence of organized chromatin, the GR is able to bind the promoter independent of NF1. These data suggest that NF1 binding is required for GR to overcome chromatin architecture and to bind its cognate site within the promoter. Depletion of NF1 Levels by siRNA Transfection—The exclusion of GR from the promoter in the absence of NF1 binding is intriguing, given the fact that under in vitro conditions in the absence of NF1, GR is able to bind to its site on the promoter and remodel the chromatin with SWI/SNF complex (16Fletcher T.M. Ryu B.W. Baumann C.T. Warren B.S. Fragoso G. John S. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6466-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 17Ostlund Farrants A.K. Blomquist P. Kwon H. Wrange O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Although we have previously shown that the deletion in the mNF1 construct does not affect its ability to position nucleosome accurately (8Hebbar P.B. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 887-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the above results could be explained by any of the following reasons. 1) There could be topological constraints in the mutant construct that may prevent the binding of GR efficiently in the absence of NF1 when stably integrated. 2) Alternatively, by mutating the NF1 site, binding site for another unknown transcription factor may be impaired in this construct or 3) positional effects on the stably integrated promoter constructs based on the integration locus. To address these concerns, we employed RNA interference to deplete NF1 protein levels in the cells followed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. By this approach, the synergism in binding of these two transcription factors can be assessed without any possible structural alteration to the promoter. This experimental design also allows us to test the universality of this phenomenon on other GR-regulated genes. The NF1 gene family contains four different, ubiquitously expressed, highly related genes: NF1A, NF1B, NF1C, and NF1X (18Gronostajski R.M. Gene. 2000; 249: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Because of the tissue-specific expression of these isoforms and their splice variants it is not clear which isoform is required for cooperation with GR (19Murtagh J. Martin F. Gronostajski R.M. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2003; 8: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Because NF1-C isoform has been shown to be most abundant in the mouse mammary gland (20Kane R. Finlay D. Lamb T. Martin F. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 480: 117-122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A), we tested the role of NF1-C isoform in GR-mediated gene regulation in MCF7M cells. Using ChIP assay and NF1-C-specific antibody, we showed that NF1-C isoform binds to the MMTV promoter in a hormone-dependent manner (Fig. 2, A and B). Therefore, we used siRNA targeted to NF1-C transcript to deplete NF1 protein levels required for activation of the promoter. MCF7M cells were transfected with siRNA targeting lamin A/C (control) and NF1-C mRNA. Transfection with NF1-C siRNA resulted in significant reduction in NF1-C mRNA levels (Fig. 2C), although there is some knockdown of other NF1 isoform-specific transcripts as well. In agreement with the mRNA levels, we also saw significant reduction in NF1 protein levels when Western blots were probed with antibody that recognized all isoforms (Fig. 2D). This suggests that by targeting siRNA to NF1-C mRNA, we depleted significant levels of total NF1 proteins in these cells. Effect of NF1 Depletion on MMTV Transcription and GR Binding to the Promoter—Using this in vivo model for NF1 depletion, we examined the effect of NF1 diminution on GR-mediated MMTV transcription. As expected, reduced NF1 protein levels resulted in a decline in the level of MMTV transcription after hormone treatment (Fig. 3A) compared with control siRNA. This decrease in transcriptional activation is not associated with changes in global GR levels in the cell (Fig. 3B). To assess the effect of NF1 reduction on chromatin remodeling of the MMTV promoter, restriction enzyme hypersensitivity assay was performed. Consistent with our previous result (8Hebbar P.B. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 887-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we observed reduced hormone-dependent increase in accessibility of SstI enzyme in NF1-depleted samples compared with the control samples (Fig. 3D, compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 3 and 4). This implies that NF1 is required for chromatin remodeling of the MMTV promoter. Next, we performed ChIP assays with GR and NF1 antibodies after NF1 depletion (Fig. 3E). In control siRNA transfections, GR and NF1 bound to the promoter in a hormone-dependent manner. As expected, NF1 binding to the MMTV promoter was diminished upon NF1 knockdown in both control and hormone-treated samples. Thus it appears that there is some basal NF1 binding in the absence of GR as measured by ChIP assay. Consistent with our hypothesis, we observed reduction in GR binding to the promoter upon depletion of NF1 proteins suggesting that GR required NF1 to stabilize its association with its binding site on the MMTV promoter organized as chromatin. GR and NF1 Co-occupy the Promoter—For GR and NF1 to bind cooperatively to the MMTV promoter, we would expect these proteins to co-occupy the promoter. To demonstrate concurrent binding of GR and NF1 on the same promoter, we performed a ChIP-reChIP experiment (Fig. 4). We performed the first ChIP with GR antibody and as expected there was increased amount of GR binding to the promoter in the presence of hormone. Using the hormone-treated sample immunoprecipitated with GR antibody, we reChIPed with IgG or NF1 antibody. NF1 antibody immunoprecipitated the complexes immunoprecipitated with GR antibody in the first ChIP. This suggests that GR and NF1 co-exist on the same MMTV promoter. Effect of NF1 Depletion on Expression of Other GR-regulated Genes—To further understand the dependence of NF1 and GR in binding the MMTV promoter, we wanted to understand the universality of this phenomenon. NF1 is known to function as an accessory transcription factor for genes regulated by a number of signal transduction pathways including those controlled by cAMP, insulin, TGFβ, other steroid hormones, vitamin D, and others. Also GR and NF1 have been shown to co-regulate a number of promoters (18Gronostajski R.M. Gene. 2000; 249: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both GR and NF1-B knock-out mice have very similar phenotype with defects in lung maturation, and there are a number of genes affected by these two proteins (21Schmid W. Cole T.J. Blendy J.A. Schutz G. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 53: 33-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 22Steele-Perkins G. Plachez C. Butz K.G. Yang G. Bachurski C.J. Kinsman S.L. Litwack E.D. Richards L.J. Gronostajski R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 685-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Therefore to understand the cooperation between GR and NF1 on other GR-regulated genes, we analyzed two GR-regulated promoters, sgk and 11βHSD2. We scanned the sgk and 11βHSD2 promoters with the Transfac software for putative GR and NF1 binding sites (Fig. 6, A and C). As reported previously, sgk promoter is a primary glucocorticoid responsive gene (23Webster M.K. Goya L. Ge Y. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2031-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) and has four putative NF1 binding sites but their role in GR-mediated activation has not been demonstrated. When we monitored transcription from sgk promoter under conditions of NF1 depletion, we failed to see any effect on GR-dependent increase in sgk mRNA levels (Fig. 5A). This suggests that despite the presence of putative binding sites, NF1 may not play a role in GR-mediated transactivation of the sgk promoter. This result also implies that depletion of NF1 does not universally impair ability of the GR to stimulate gene expression.FIGURE 5NF1 depletion has differential effect on sgk and 11βHSD2 mRNA levels. A, MCF7M cells were transfected with siRNA targeted to lamin A/C (control) and NF1-C-specific siRNA for 48 h and treated with dex for 4 h. Total RNA was isolated, and real-time PCR amplifications from reverse-transcribed RNA were performed using sgk-(A) and 11βHSD2-specific (B) primers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In contrast to the sgk promoter, NF1 was identified as a strong stimulatory factor for 11βHSD2 promoter activity, and its binding site at –498 was shown to be important for this activation (24Alikhani-Koopaei R. Fouladkou F. Frey F.J. Frey B.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 1146-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6A). There are four additional putative NF1 binding sites, and one HRE within the proximal promoter. Glucocorticoids has been shown to stimulate expression of 11βHSD2 in a number of cell lines (7Trotter K.W. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3347-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 25van Beek J.P. Guan H. Julan L. Yang K. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 89: 5614-5621Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 26Wan Y. Nordeen S.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1204-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Indeed when we analyze 11βHSD2 mRNA levels under NF1 depletion conditions, there is a decline in hormone-mediated response (Fig. 5B) suggesting that NF1 is required for GR-mediated activation of this promoter. GR and NF1 Cooperativity on Endogenous GR-regulated Promoters—Using our in vivo model to understand cooperativity between GR and NF1 proteins on other endogenous promoters, we analyzed the binding of GR to NF1-dependent 11βHSD2 promoter and to NF1-independent sgk promoter. We performed ChIP assays with GR antibody under NF1-depleted conditions and probed for these two promoters. The sgk promoter region has at least four putative HREs between –1000 and –1500 (Fig. 6A), and we used real-time PCR primers to this region. Consistent with the sgk mRNA levels (Fig. 5A), GR binding to the sgk promoter in the presence of hormone was not reduced upon NF1 knockdown (Fig. 6B). Therefore NF1 depletion seems to have no effect on sgk mRNA levels or on GR binding to the promoter. Consistent with the hormone-dependent increase in 11βHSD2 mRNA levels, we observed a significant recruitment of the GR at the bona fide HRE present in the promoter. In sharp contrast to what was seen with the sgk promoter, when we amplified the region on 11βHSD2 promoter with a putative HRE, the binding of GR in the presence of hormone was reduced upon NF1 knockdown (Fig. 6, C and D). This implies that binding of GR to 11βHSD2 promoter is also NF1-dependent. This is similar to what we found on the MMTV promoter, which suggests that the binding of GR to promoters that is regulated by both GR and NF1 may be dependent on NF1 binding. These mechanistic similarities between the 11βHSD2 and MMTV promoters may define a subset of GR-regulated genes with a critical role for NF1 with respect to GR binding its cognate site in vivo. Gene transcription requires multiple molecular machines the activities of which are often directed to promoters by targetspecific transcription factors. We have used the GR and NF1 transcription factors within the context of the MMTV promoter to explore the contributions of chromatin to combinatorial protein-protein interactions in vivo. We previously demonstrated that NF1 plays a dual role, one as a classical transcription factor and the other as an architectural protein for chromatin remodeling of the promoter (8Hebbar P.B. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 887-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore we showed that NF1 binding is required for stable interaction of GR with the promoter (8Hebbar P.B. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 887-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this current study, we found that binding of GR on transiently transfected MMTV promoter was not dependent on NF1 binding. However, the GR did require NF1 to bind to HREs only in the context of organized chromatin architecture. We also demonstrate that both these transcription factors co-occupy the promoter, which is a prerequisite for cooperativity. However, in vitro studies demonstrated that GR but not NF1 can bind nucleosomes (27Blomquist P. Li Q. Wrange O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 153-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Therefore, we propose that not only is GR necessary to permit NF1 binding but also that bound NF1 in turn facilitates further occupancy or increases stronger GR association with the promoter in vivo. Thus there is a reciprocal and sequential synergism between GR and NF1 on MMTV promoter, which we propose may be necessary for the dynamic interaction of GR with the promoter (28McNally J.G. Muller W.G. Walker D. Wolford R. Hager G.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this cooperation does not appear to require direct protein-protein interaction between GR and NF1 as we fail to co-immunoprecipitate these proteins together (data not shown). This interdependence of GR and NF1 binding to the promoter they both regulate provides interesting insights into how transcription factors cooperate to bind to their recognition sites on DNA organized as chromatin. The presence of combinatorial binding sites for multiple site-specific transcription factors on many promoters may be an indication of the generality of cooperation between them. Consistent with our results, a similar cooperativity has been suggested for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) promoter where GR binding has been shown to be facilitated by accessory factors (29Stafford J.M. Wilkinson J.C. Beechem J.M. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39885-39891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Further, in breast cancer cells, the Forkhead protein, FoxA1, interacts with cis-regulatory regions in combination with adjacent estrogen response elements to facilitate the interaction of estrogen receptor with chromatin (30Carroll J.S. Liu X.S. Brodsky A.S. Li W. Meyer C.A. Szary A.J. Eeckhoute J. Shao W. Hestermann E.V. Geistlinger T.R. Fox E.A. Silver P.A. Brown M. Cell. 2005; 122: 33-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). Our observations with GR and NF1 on the MMTV promoter are particularly exciting because this is the first study in which two transcription factors have been shown to cooperate to specifically overcome the chromatin architecture. We believe a similar cooperation may occur on the 11βHSD2 promoter. Indeed, as seen with the MMTV promoter, 11βHSD2 promoter is shown to require BRG1 remodeling complex for GR-mediated activation (7Trotter K.W. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3347-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Despite the differences in the layout of these two promoters with respect to binding sites for GR and NF1, the chromatin architecture may be similar such that cooperation between GR and NF1 may be essential to permit stable association of the activation complex with the promoter. Unlike the MMTV and 11βHSD2 promoters, the absence of GR and NF1 cooperativity on the sgk promoter is striking. One possibility for such a differential requirement may be that the chromatin architecture of the sgk promoter permits stable association of GR even in the absence of cooperative binding. Conversely, GR may utilize other transcription factor(s) to stabilize its interaction with the chromatin. Although the chromatin architecture and other transcription factor requirement for GR-mediated activation of sgk promoter is still largely undefined, there are putative binding sites for Sp1, Ap1 transcriptional complex, CCAAT enhancer-binding protein, GATA, and OTF transcription factors on the sgk promoter (based on transfac analysis). It will be interesting to evaluate whether any of these factors have similar cooperative binding properties as NF1. The differential requirement of cooperativity between NF1 and GR on the sgk and the 11βHSD2 promoters may represent another contributing factor to the cell and promoter-specific effect of the hormone. The sequence of the HRE, recruitment of coactivators/corepressors, and the composition of other associated regulatory components are known to mediate a promoter-specific response to hormone (31Wang J.C. Derynck M.K. Nonaka D.F. Khodabakhsh D.B. Haqq C. Yamamoto K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15603-15608Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Recent data suggest that differential recruitment of mediator complex, MED14 and MED1, by GR also facilitates gene-specific transcription (32Chen W. Rogatsky I. Garabedian M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 560-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies show that different ligands can selectively affect the ability of GR to bind HRE and result in differences in the subunit composition of regulatory complexes recruited to the promoter (33Wang J.C. Shah N. Pantoja C. Meijsing S.H. Ho J.D. Scanlan T.S. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Accordingly, a number of factors appear to promote cell and promoter-specific control by GR, and we propose that the cooperative binding of different site-specific DNA binding proteins can be another contributing factor to achieve this regulation. We present two models to explain the cooperativity between GR and NF1 on promoters they both regulate (Fig. 7). In the first model, cooperativity between transcription factors can be envisioned to be the first step in initial target site recognition in which both GR and NF1 bind cooperatively to their sites to overcome the chromatin architecture. This initial cooperative factor binding may occur by spontaneous nucleosomal site exposure as proposed by a recent “collaborative competition model” using bacterial DNA-binding proteins, LexA and Tet repressor, and Gcn4 protein in Saccharomycces cerevisiae (9Miller J.A. Widom J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1623-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This initial factor-binding step is followed by the recruitment of remodeling complex, which changes the properties of the nucleosomes, thereby allowing further occupancy of other regulatory factors. Based on this hypothesis, one would expect cooperativity even in the absence of chromatin remodeling. Therefore in the absence of NF1 binding, we observe loss of GR binding and attenuated chromatin remodeling. In this context, it will be important to explore whether the DNA binding properties of NF1 are sufficient to stabilize GR binding to the MMTV promoter. In the second model, we speculate that NF1 plays a role in a step subsequent to initial factor binding. In this model, GR initially binds to the promoter and then recruits BRG1 remodeling complex, which remodels the promoter. Consistent with this idea, GR is shown to bind to the promoter even in the absence of BRG1 remodeling complex (7Trotter K.W. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3347-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We propose that NF1 may play an active role in the remodeling process itself or may be necessary to maintain the remodeled state of the promoter because in the absence of NF1 binding, chromatin remodeling is reduced. Therefore based on this model, cooperativity between GR and NF1 occurs at the remodeling step. The dynamic nature of the association of the GR with the promoter in the continued presence of ligand (28McNally J.G. Muller W.G. Walker D. Wolford R. Hager G.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) might necessitate the requirement of a factor such as NF1, which can maintain the remodeled state. Hence it is conceivable that in the absence of NF1 binding to the promoter, the rapid reassociation of GR with the promoter is impaired. This loss in reassociation would then result in the observed reduction of both chromatin remodeling and GR binding on the promoter as measured in the ChIP assay. Future studies addressing the role of BRG1 remodeling complex in cooperative binding of GR and NF1 can aid in elucidating a mechanism for this cooperativity. Consistent with the idea that NF1 has a role in stabilizing GR binding, there is evidence that NF1 interacts with histone H3 and is suggested to restructure chromatin of target promoters and replication origins (34Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Pflugfelder M. von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Furthermore, interaction of NF1 with histone H3 is shown to prevent the propagation of silent chromatin structure (35Ferrari S. Simmen K.C. Dusserre Y. Muller K. Fourel G. Gilson E. Mermod N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55520-55530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This function of NF1 is perhaps analogous to the barrier protein function of CCCTC-binding factor DNA-binding protein on the chicken β-globin locus (36Saitoh N. Bell A.C. Recillas-Targa F. West A.G. Simpson M. Pikaart M. Felsenfeld G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2315-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Taken together, all these findings suggest that NF1 has an architectural role in transcriptional activation, and such a function may facilitate cooperativity between GR and NF1 in overcoming chromatin organization. These results suggest a significant advancement in our understanding of the roles of these two well studied transcription factors (5Hager G.L. Fletcher T.M. Xiao N. Baumann C.T. Muller W.G. McNally J.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Previously the GR was seen as the initiating agent that recruited the remodeling complex to open the chromatin structure (6Hebbar P.B. Archer T.K. Chromosoma. 2003; 111: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The binding of NF1 was then thought to be subsequent to this chromatin remodeling step. Our new data suggest that NF1 has a much earlier role such that the initial functional interaction of the GR and remodeling complex requires both the NF1 protein and a functional NF1 binding site. This represents a fundamental shift in previously proposed functions of the GR, NF1, and the BRG1 remodeling complex on this well studied promoter (6Hebbar P.B. Archer T.K. Chromosoma. 2003; 111: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Our data suggest a molecular mechanism inherent to cooperative binding function of very diverse groups of transcription factors that is central to understanding gene regulation. We thank Dr. N.

Chk1 and Cds1 have overlapping roles in both the DNA damage checkpoint and the DNA replication checkpoint; therefore, the chk1 cds1 double mutant is highly sensitive to various forms of DNA damage and to replication block, comparable with rad3 or rad26 mutants, whereas chk1 or cds1 single mutants show only moderate or weak sensitivity (16Boddy M.N.

The Tel2/Rad-5/Clk-2 family proteins are highly conserved among eukaryotic species. The tel2 mutant in S. cerevisiae has short telomeric DNA (34Lustig A.J. Petes T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sc. U. S.

S. cerevisiae Tel2 is essential for cell viability and binds to both single-stranded and double-stranded telomeric DNA in vitro, suggesting that it regulates telomere length by binding to the ends of telomeres (35Runge K.W.

However, the molecular mechanisms of action of Rad-5/Clk-2 or hCLK2 in DNA replication remain unknown. Here we report the identification and characterization of tel2+, the gene encoding the fission yeast TEL2/Rad-5/Clk-2-related protein. We found that Tel2 is required for HU-induced activation of the Mrc1-Cds1 DNA replication checkpoint. In addition, the genetic interaction between tel2 and swi1 indicates that Tel2 also plays an important role in maintenance of genome integrity, especially at S phase.

Cds1 Kinase Assay and Immunoblotting of Chk1 and Mrc1—Cds1 kinase assays were performed as described previously (16Boddy M.N. Furnari B. Mondesert O. Russell P.

S. pombe tel2+ Is Essential for Vegetative Cell Growth—To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of Tel2/Rad-5/Clk-2 family proteins in DNA replication, we searched for a tel2/rad-5/clk-2-related gene in the Sanger Centre S. pombe genome data base. We identified the ORF SPAC458.03 (hereafter referred to as tel2+) that encodes a protein showing 14.9% identity to S. cerevisiae Tel2, 13.8% to C. elegans Rad-5/Clk-2, and 15.7% to Homo sapiens CLK2 throughout the entire sequence. We found three short and unique amino acid sequences highly conserved among Tel2/Rad-5/Clk-2 family proteins (Figs. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). The Tel2 protein was expressed throughout the cell cycle (Fig. 1B), and its expression showed no significant changes after UV or HU treatment (data not shown). The function of Tel2 was investigated by generating a tel2 null mutation. One copy of tel2+ in a ura4– diploid strain was replaced with the ura4+ marker gene. Two independent gene disruption transformants (CS903 and CS904) were confirmed by Southern blotting analysis (data not shown). Tetrad analysis of the tel2+/tel2::ura4+ diploids revealed that no more than two spores could form colonies in each set of tetrads and that all the viable cells were Ura–. The terminal morphology of tel2– spores on germination plates was examined. Fifteen percent of the spores ceased growth immediately after germination (Fig. 1C, left), whereas 85% formed microcolonies of 2–50 cells (Fig. 1C, middle and right). To exclude the possibility that the lethality observed in the tel2 null mutant was because of unexpected effects on neighboring genes, tel2+/tel2::ura4+ diploid cells were transformed with pREP1 (control vector) or pREP1-tel2+ (expression plasmid containing the tel2+ gene), and their spores were incubated on plates lacking uracil to select tel2::ura4+ haploid mutant cells. The growth of the tel2 haploid mutant was dependent on pREP1-tel2+ (Fig. 1D). Therefore, we concluded that the tel2 gene function is essential for vegetative cell growth. The function of tel2+ in DNA replication was investigated by germinating spores from a tel2+/tel2::ura4+ diploid (CS903) in SD medium lacking uracil. The tel2Δ cells completed the first cycle of DNA replication in 8 h and started to form a germ projection at 8 h, as observed in wild-type spores (Fig. 2A and data not shown). The tel2Δ cells progressed to the second cycle of DNA replication (∼8–16 h in Fig. 2C), possibly using inherited Tel2 protein. This and the variety of terminal cell morphology shown in Fig. 1C probably reflect a requirement of only a low level of Tel2 protein for cell growth (see also Fig. 3). At 20 h, a population with 1C DNA content appeared, which was not observed in the wild-type cells, indicating that the entry into S phase was inhibited or delayed in tel2Δ. These observations suggested that Tel2 is required for the normal entry into S phase.FIGURE 3Characterization of the nmt81-tel2+ strain. A, construction of the nmt81-tel2+ strain. A thiamine-inducible nmt81 promoter was inserted upstream of the chromosomal tel2+ locus with the LEU2+ marker gene, and 12 copies of the Myc tag were added at the C terminus of the Tel2 ORF. The activity of the nmt81 promoter is repressed in the presence of thiamine, and it is induced in the absence of thiamine. B, expression of Tel2-Myc protein after the addition of thiamine. Wild-type (CS1785) and nmt81-tel2+ (CS1732) cells were grown in EMM medium (without thiamine) at 30 °C to log phase, and then 14 μm thiamine was added. Whole-cell extracts were prepared, and immunoblotting was performed with anti-Myc antibodies for Tel2-Myc protein and with anti-PSTAIRE antibodies for Cdc2 protein (control). C, viability of the wild-type (CS1785) and nmt81-tel2+ (CS1732) strains. Cells were grown in EMM (without thiamine) to mid-log phase, and then thiamine was added at time 0. The viability of each strain was calculated by dividing the number of colonies formed on EMM (without thiamine) plates by the number of cells plated. Error bars indicate the standard error from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Characterization of the nmt81-tel2+ Mutant—To further investigate the function of Tel2, we generated a strain in which the thiamine-repressible nmt81 promoter was inserted upstream of the chromosomal tel2+ locus, and the Myc tag was added at the C terminus of the Tel2 ORF (Fig. 3A). In the absence of thiamine, the nmt81 promoter induces expression of the gene located downstream, whereas it “partially” represses the expression in the presence of thiamine (48Basi G. Schmid E. Maundrell K. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). The resultant nmt81-tel2+ strain was grown to exponential phase in the absence of thiamine. Before addition of thiamine (time 0), the level of Tel2-myc expression in nmt81-tel2+ cells was approximately double that in wild-type cells (Fig. 3B). After addition of thiamine, the expression level of Tel2-myc in the nmt81-tel2+ strain decreased gradually (Fig. 3B). This strain showed lower viability than the wild-type strain, although it did not die completely and kept growing slowly even after 60 h of thiamine treatment, indicating that a very small amount of Tel2 protein is sufficient for cell viability (Fig. 3C). Thirty six hours after addition of thiamine, Tel2-myc was hardly detectable by Western blotting, and the viability started to decrease (Fig. 3, B and C). Therefore, we used cells that had been treated for at least 36 h with thiamine in subsequent experiments to investigate the effects of Tel2 repression. Tel2 Is Required for Survival of Replication Fork Arrest in chk1Δ—C. elegans rad-5/clk-2 mutants are hypersensitive to HU, IR, or UV treatment (38Hartman P.S. Herman R.K.

Shoubridge E.A. Hekimi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21678-21684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether Tel2 is involved in tolerance to DNA damage in fission yeast. Cells were grown in the presence of thiamine for 36 h to repress tel2+ expression and then spotted onto plates containing HU and thiamine (Fig. 4A). Wild-type cells readily formed colonies on plates containing 5 mm HU, whereas the nmt81-tel2+ strain formed a smaller number (∼1/20) of colonies, indicating that Tel2 is involved in tolerance to replication fork arrest induced by HU treatment. The nmt81-tel2+ chk1Δ double mutant showed much stronger sensitivity to HU than each single mutant, which was similar to rad3Δ. In contrast, the nmt81-tel2+ cds1Δ double mutant showed only slightly stronger sensitivity than each single mutant. These observations indicated that Tel2 functions in HU tolerance and that this is at least partially independent of Chk1. Next, we examined whether Tel2 is involved in UV tolerance (Fig. 4A). Exposure of DNA to UV irradiation causes the formation of DNA lesions that block replication forks. The Tel2-repressed nmt81-tel2+ strain and chk1Δ single mutant showed moderate sensitivity to UV irradiation. However, the nmt81-tel2+ chk1Δ double mutant showed acute sensitivity similar to rad3Δ or chk1Δ cds1Δ. In contrast, the nmt81-tel2+ cds1Δ double mutant showed sensitivity similar to that of the nmt81-tel2+ sin"

In this study, using mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) isolated from mice genetically deficient for the mPges-1 gene, we show basal elevation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) expression (protein and mRNA) and transcriptional activity associated with reduced basal PGE2. We further show that basal mPGES-1-derived PGE2 suppresses the expression of PPARγ through a cAMP-independent pathway involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt signaling. Using specific PPARγ agonist (rosiglitazone), PPARγ ligand (15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2), and PPARγ inhibitor (GW9662), we confirm that activation of PPARγ blocks interleukin-1β-induced up-regulation of COX-2, mPGES-1, and their derived PGE2. Furthermore, we demonstrate that up-regulation of PPARγ upon genetic deletion of mPGES-1 is responsible for reduced COX-2 expression under basal as well as interleukin-1β-stimulated conditions. This study provides evidence for the first time that mPGES-1 deletion not only decreases proinflammatory PGE2 but also up-regulates anti-inflammatory PPARγ, which has the ability to suppress COX-2 and mPGES-1 expression and PGE2 production. Thus, mPGES-1 inhibition may limit inflammation by multiple mechanisms and is a potential therapeutic target. mPGES-1 (microsomal PGE synthase-1) is an inducible enzyme that acts downstream of cyclooxygenase (COX) and specifically catalyzes the conversion of prostaglandin (PG) H2 to PGE2 under basal as well as inflammatory conditions.

Inhibition of PGE2 production and action is associated with reduction of the pain and inflammation associated with a wide variety of diseases.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is a member of nuclear hormone receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors that have been shown to regulate inflammatory responses and assist in the resolution of inflammation (20Ricote M.

We created mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) cell lines derived from mPGES-1 null mice and wild type (WT) littermates to facilitate these studies. This study demonstrates for the first time that mPGES-1 deficiency and reduced PGE2 lead to elevation of PPARγ under basal conditions. This study further identifies key downstream signaling targets responsible for PPARγ regulation by mPGES-1-derived PGE2. Animals—mPGES-1 heterozygous mice on a DBA1 lac/J background were obtained from Pfizer (15Trebino C.E. Stock J.L. Gibbons C.P. Naiman B.M. Wachtmann T.S. Umland J.P. Pandher K. Lapointe J.M. Saha S.

Mice were housed in microisolator cages in a pathogen-free barrier facility, and all experiments were performed under the approved IACUC and institutional guidelines. Materials—Rabbit anti-human mPGES-1 antiserum was a gift from Dr. Per-Johan Jakobsson (Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden). PPARγ transcription assay kit, rabbit anti-mouse COX-2 polyclonal antibody, PGE2, carbacyclin, NS-398 (N-[2-(cyclohexyloxy)-4-nitrophenyl]-methanesulfonamide), rosiglitazone, (15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2), GW9662, LY294002, ovine COX-2 standard protein, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit for PGE2 were all purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). PD98059 (selective inhibitor of MAP kinase kinase (MEK)), SB203580 (specific inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase), and 1L-6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol-2-(R)-2-O-methyl-3-O-octadecylcarbonate (specific Akt inhibitor) were purchased from Calbiochem. Mouse monoclonal PPARγ primary antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse anti-human β-actin monoclonal antibody and indomethacin were obtained from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were from Invitrogen. Recombinant mouse IL-1β was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). TRIpure was purchased from Roche Diagnostics. The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Preparation and Activation of Mouse Embryo Fibroblasts—Embryos were harvested from mPGES-1 (DBA1 lac/J) pregnant heterozygous females (E12.5) who had been mated with heterozygous males. Whole embryos were minced and placed into culture DMEM containing 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2. At confluence, the cells were detached and passaged, and 3–4 passage cells were used in all experiments. MEFs were plated into the wells of a 6-well plate at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Cells were starved for 72 h in DMEM containing 1% FBS and then incubated with or without 1 ng/ml IL-1β in the presence or absence of various treatments for 12 h. Cell viability was determined by measuring mitochondrial NADH-dependent dehydrogenase activity with WST-1 assay (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan). Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—RNA from the cells was extracted with TRIpure reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions using a SuperScript preamplification system (Invitrogen) with 1 μg of total RNA from the cells as a template. Subsequent amplifications of the cDNA fragments by PCR with HotStar Taq polymerase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) were performed using 0.5 μl of the reverse-transcribed mixture as a template with specific oligonucleotide primers and cycle numbers as follows: mouse PPARγ (31 cycles), sense 5′-CCT CTC CGT GAT GGA AGA CC-3′ and antisense 5′-GCA TTG TGA GAC ATC CCC AC-3′; mouse GAPDH (20 cycles), sense 5′-GGG GTG AGG CCG GTG CTG AGT AT-3′ and antisense 5′-CAT TGG GGG TAG GAA CAC GGA AGG-3′. After initial denaturation at 95 °C for 15 min, PCR involved amplification cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 56 °C, and 45 s at 72 °C, followed by elongation for 5 min at 72 °C. The amplified cDNA fragments were resolved by electrophoresis on 2% (w/v) agarose gel and were visualized under UV light using a Chemidoc apparatus (Bio-Rad) after staining of the gel with ethidium bromide. Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% SDS, and the protein content of the lysates was determined using bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay reagent (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Cell lysates were adjusted to equal equivalents of protein and then were applied to SDS-polyacrylamide gels (10–20%) for electrophoresis. Next, the proteins were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After the membranes were blocked in 10 mm TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and 5% skim milk, the membranes were probed for 1.5 h with the respective antibodies (1:1000 for mPGES-1, COX-2, PPARγ, and β-actin) in TBS-T for 1.5 h. After washing the membranes with TBS-T, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit (for mPGES-1 and COX-2) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (for PPARγ and β-actin) IgG (1:10,000 dilution in TBS-T containing 5% skim milk) overnight at 4 °C. After further washing with TBS-T, protein bands were visualized with an ECL Western blot analysis system using a Chemidoc apparatus (Bio-Rad). PPARγ Transcriptional Activity Assay—MEFs were plated into the T-75 flasks at a density of 2 × 106 cells/flask in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Cells were starved for 72 h in DMEM containing 1% FBS and then incubated with or without 1 ng/ml IL-1β in the presence/absence of various treatments. Nuclear extraction and PPARγ transcriptional activity assays were performed using the PPARγ transcription assay kit (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI), and procedures were followed according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. Measurement of PGE2 in Culture Medium—MEFs were incubated for 12 h in the presence or absence of IL-1β (1 ng/ml). In experiments involving treatment with indomethacin and NS-398, these compounds were added 72 h before IL-1β stimulation. The culture supernatant was harvested, and concentration of PGE2 was measured by ELISA (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor MI). Assays were performed according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. Statistical Analysis—The data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s t test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Effect of mPGES-1 Genetic Deletion on PPARγ Expression (mRNA and Protein) and Transcriptional Activity in mPGES-1 WT and Null MEFs—mPGES-1 WT and null MEFs, in the presence/absence of IL-1β stimulation, were analyzed for PPARγ mRNA expression (Fig. 1a), protein expression (Fig. 1b), and transcriptional activity (Fig. 1c). Results showed that under basal conditions, PPARγ mRNA and protein levels were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the mPGES-1 null MEFs compared with their WT counterparts. Similarly PPARγ transcriptional activity was significantly higher (p < 0.01) in mPGES-1 null MEFs compared with WT MEFs under basal conditions. IL-1β stimulation decreased the levels of PPARγ mRNA, protein, and transcriptional activity by near 50% in both cell types; however, PPARγ expression and transcriptional activity levels were still significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the mPGES-1 null MEFs compared with WT MEFs. These results show that genetic deletion of mPGES-1 leads to elevation of PPARγ expression and transcriptional activity levels. Furthermore, proinflammatory signals reduce PPARγ expression and transcriptional activity, an effect mitigated in the absence of mPGES-1. Effect of mPGES-1 Genetic Deletion on PGE2 Levels in mPGES-1 WT and Null MEFs—PGE2 levels were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in mPGES-1 WT MEFs compared with null MEFs under unstimulated conditions (Fig. 2). Upon stimulation with IL-1β, a significant (p < 0.01) increase in the levels of PGE2 was observed in WT MEFs; however, no change in the PGE2 levels was observed in mPGES-1 null MEFs. These results clearly demonstrate that mPGES-1 is critical for PGE2 production at basal as well as stimulated conditions even though we have shown previously that both cytosolic PGES (cPGES) and mPGES-2 are expressed in these MEFs (6Kapoor M. Kojima F. Qian M. Yang L. Crofford L.J. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 2387-2389Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Our recent study using mPGES-1 WT and null MEFs also showed that genetic deletion of mPGES-1 not only blocks PGE2 production but also results in the elevation of 6-keto-PGF1α (stable breakdown product of prostacyclin; PGI2) under basal as well as cytokine-stimulated conditions, suggesting a shunting phenomenon within the arachidonic acid metabolic pathway upon deletion of mPGES-1 (6Kapoor M. Kojima F. Qian M. Yang L. Crofford L.J. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 2387-2389Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In this study, we further showed that mPGES-1 genetic deletion did not have any effect on the production pattern of other PGs such as PGD2 and thromboxane B2, which remained unaltered in mPGES-1 WT and null MEFs under basal as well as cytokine-stimulated conditions. Effect of Exogenous PGE2 and Carbacyclin (Prostacyclin Analogue) on PPARγ Expression and Transcriptional Activity in mPGES-1 WT and Null MEFs—To determine whether PGE2 or an alternate change induced by mPGES-1 deletion suppresses PPARγ expression and transcriptional activity in MEFs, exogenous PGE2 treatment of mPGES-1 WT and null MEFs in the presence or absence of IL-1β stimulation was performed. Addition of PGE2 under basal conditions resulted in a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in the PPARγ expression both at mRNA and protein levels in mPGES-1 null MEFs with little or no change observed in WT MEFs (Fig. 3, a and b). In the presence of IL-1β, a further decrease in the PPARγ mRNA expression levels was observed in both mPGES-1 WT and null MEFs. PPARγ protein expression did not show any further decrease when PGE2 was used in combination with IL-1β. Because our previous studies using mPGES-1 WT and null MEFs showed elevation of 6-keto-PGF1α upon genetic deletion of mPGES-1 in MEFs (6Kapoor M. Kojima F. Qian M. Yang L. Crofford L.J. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 2387-2389Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we therefore investigated the effects of carbacyclin (PGI2 analogue) to determine the contribution of PGI2 versus PGE2 toward regulation of PPARγ expression in MEFs. However, we did not observe any changes in the protein expression levels of PPARγ in mPGES-1 WT and null MEFs upon treatment with carbacyclin (Fig. 3c). Addition of PGE2 in the absence of IL-1β stimulation significantly (p < 0.01) decreased PPARγ transcriptional activity levels in mPGES-1 null MEFs bringing the levels similar to mPGES-1 WT MEFs (Fig. 3d). In the presence of IL-1β stimulation, a further significant decrease in the levels of both mPGES-1 WT (p < 0.05) and null MEFs (p < 0.01) was observed. Treatment with carbacyclin did not have any effect on PPARγ transcriptional activity in mPGES-1 WT and null MEFs. These results suggest that deletion of mPGES-1 and a subsequent decrease in PGE2 levels (and not increased PGI2) play a key role in the differential regulation of PPARγ in MEFs. In addition, these results also suggest that IL-1β has the ability to itself regulate the expression and transcriptional activity of PPARγ and may exert other intrinsic effects on PPARγ expression and activity in addition to its ability to increase PGE2 production. Effect of PGE2 Inhibition by NSAIDs (Indomethacin and NS-398) on PPARγ Expression and Transcriptional Activity in mPGES-1 WT and Null MEFs—To further confirm the contribution of PGE2 toward differential regulation of PPARγ expression and transcriptional activity, mPGES-1 WT and null MEFs were treated with NSAIDs, including indomethacin (nonselective COX inhibitor) and NS-398 (selective COX-2 inhibitor). Addition of indomethacin and NS-398 significantly increased the levels of PPARγ protein expression (Fig. 4a) and transcriptional activity (Fig. 4b) in mPGES-1 WT MEFs only, raising the levels similar to that of mPGES-1 null MEFs. These results further confirm that PGE2 is the key mediator involved in differential regulation of PPARγ in mPGES-1 WT and null MEFs. Effect of mPGES-1 Deletion on cAMP Levels in mPGES-1 WT and Null MEFs—PGE2 has been shown to mediate some of its downstream effects via cAMP-dependent pathways (8Regan J.W. Life Sci. 2003; 74: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the effect of mPGES-1 deletion and the subsequent decrease in the levels of PGE2 on cAMP levels in mPGES-1 WT and null MEFs. Results showed that mPGES-1 deletion did not have any significant effect on the levels of cAMP in MEFs under basal conditions (Fig. 5a). We further investigated the effects of exogenous PGE2 and forskolin (a direct adenyl cyclase activator) on the levels of cAMP in mPGES-1 WT and null MEFs. Treatment with PGE2 (p < 0.05) and forskolin (p < 0.01) significantly increased cAMP levels in both mPGES-1 WT and null MEFs to a similar extent. These results show that the cAMP machinery is intact in both mPGES-1 WT and null MEFs. Effect of Forskolin on PPARγ Expression and Transcription Activity Levels in mPGES-1 WT and Null MEFs—To delineate the mechanism by which PGE2 regulates PPARγ expression and transcriptional activity, we treated mPGES-1 WT and null MEFs with forskolin in the presence/absence of PGE2, and we assessed its effect on PPARγ protein expression and transcriptional activity. Forskolin did not have any effect on PPARγ protein expression (Fig. 5b) and transcriptional activity (Fig. 5c) in mPGES-1 WT and null MEFs in the absence of PGE2. However, PPARγ protein expression and transcriptional activity were significantly (p < 0.01) decreased when forskolin was used in combination with PGE2, an effect that seems to be solely elicited by PGE2 and not forskolin. These results suggest that even though cAMP pathways are activated by PGE2 and forskolin in MEFs, PGE2 regulates PPARγ expression and transcriptional activity via a signaling pathway independent of cAMP. Effect of PI 3-Kinase Inhibitor, Akt Inhibitor, p38 Inhibitor, and MEK Inhibitor on PPARγ Expression in mPGES-1 WT and Null MEFs—PGE2 is also known to mediate some of its biological responses through MAP kinase and PI 3-kinase/Akt pathways (8Regan J.W. Life Sci. 2003; 74: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Therefore, to delineate the mechanism with which PGE2 regulates PPARγ expression in mPGES-1 WT and null MEFs, we investigated the effects of LY294002 (specific PI 3-kinase inhibitor), 1L-6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol-2-(R)-2-O-methyl-3-O-octadecylcarbonate (specific Akt inhibitor), SB-203580 (selective p38 MAP kinase inhibitor), and PD98059 (selective MEK inhibitor) on PPARγ expression and transcriptional activity in mPGES-1 WT and null MEFs. Addition of PI 3-kinase or Akt inhibitors elevated the protein expression levels of PPARγ in mPGES-1 WT MEFs only, raising the levels similar to that observed in mPGES-1 null MEFs (Fig. 6, a and b). PI 3-kinase and Akt inhibitors in the presence of PGE2 also showed elevation in the PPARγ expression in both mPGES-1 WT and null MEFs, thus reversing the inhibitory effects of PGE2 on PPARγ expression. Addition of p38 MAP kinase and MEK inhibitors showed no effect on PPARγ protein expression in mPGES-1 WT and null MEFs in the presence or absence of PGE2 (Fig. 6c). These results clearly suggest that PI 3-kinase and Akt signaling are key downstream pathways by which PPARγ expression is suppressed by PGE2 in MEFs. Effect of PPARγ on COX-2, mPGES-1, and PGE2 in MEFs—PPARγ is an endogenous anti-inflammatory mediator known to down-regulate key proinflammatory signals and ultimately assists in the resolution of inflammation (2Kapoor M. Shaw O. Appleton I. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2005; 6: 461-466PubMed Google Scholar, 28Willoughby D.A. Moore A.R. Colville-Nash P.R. Gilroy D. Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 2000; 22: 1131-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that PPARγ is involved in the regulation of COX-2 and mPGES-1 expression (24Farrajota K.

Duan S. Hemodial. Int. 2005; 9: S15-S20Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To further confirm these findings in MEFs, we investigated the regulatory effects of PPARγ on COX-2 and mPGES-1 expression and PGE2 production using selective PPARγ agonist (rosiglitazone), PPARγ ligand (15-deoxy-PGJ2), and PPARγ antagonist (GW9662). Because previous reports have shown that rosiglitazone, 15-deoxy-PGJ2, and GW9662 have the ability to affect cell viability, we therefore first determined the effects of various concentrations of these reagents on cell viability of MEFs using WST-1 assay. Concentrations of rosiglitazone (10 μm), 15-deoxy-PGJ2 (10 μm), and GW9662 (3 μm) were chosen for the subsequent experiments as these concentrations did not have any effect on cell viability of MEFs (data not shown). Low levels of COX-2 protein were observed in unstimulated mPGES-1 WT MEFs (Fig. 7a). Upon stimulation with IL-1β, a significant elevation (p < 0.05) in the protein expres"
https://openalex.org/W2033979463,"Three alternatively spliced variants of the renal Na-K-Cl cotransporter (NKCC2) are found in distinct regions of the thick ascending limb of the mammalian kidney; these variants mediate Na+K+2Cl- transport with different ion affinities. Here, we examine the specific residues involved in the variant-specific affinity differences, utilizing a mutagenic approach to change the NKCC2B variant into the A or F variant, with functional expression in Xenopus oocytes. The splice region contains the second transmembrane domain (TM2) and the putative intracellular loop (ICL1) connecting TM2 and TM3. It is found that the B variant is functionally changed to the F variant by replacement of six residues, half of the effect brought about by three TM2 residues and half by three ICL1 residues. The involvement of the ICL1 residues strongly suggests that this region of ICL1 may actually be part of a membrane-embedded domain. Changing six residues is also sufficient to bring about the smaller functional change from the B to the A variant; three residues in TM2 appear to be primarily responsible, two of which correspond to residues involved in the B-to-F changes. A B-variant mutation reported in a mild case of Bartter disease was found to render the cotransporter inactive. These results identify the combination of amino acid variations responsible for the differences among the three splice variants of NKCC2, and they support a model in which a reentrant loop following TM2 contributes to the chloride binding and translocation domains.

Two isoforms are encoded by separate genes: NKCC1 (Slc12a2), a nearly ubiquitous isoform with an important role in chloride secretory epithelia, and NKCC2 (Slc12a1), a kidney-specific isoform that is the target of the present investigation. NKCC2 provides the salt reabsorption mechanism necessary for renal salt and water conservation and is the clinical target for loop diuretics; mutations in NKCC2 are responsible for Bartter disease (1Simon D.B.

NKCC2 is a highly specialized protein whose expression is restricted to the apical membrane of thick ascending limb (TAL) cells in the kidney. The NKCC2 gene contains three forms of the fourth exon, which through alternative splicing give rise to the three variants of NKCC2, termed F, A, and B. The variants have distinct and almost separate distribution along the TAL, with F present primarily in the inner aspect of the outer medulla, A is primarily in the outer part of the outer medulla and in the cortex, and B is localized primarily in the macula densa (9Igarashi P.

The three splice variants of NKCC2 differ in their affinities for the three transported ions, in a way that effectively matches the transport Km values to the concentration of ions in the renal tubule (11Gimenez I.

Thus, as concentrated NaCl enters the outer medullary portion of the TAL, it is handled by low affinity NKCC2F, and as the fluid becomes diluted in more distal segments of the TAL, intermediate affinity NKCC2A is appropriately matched for effective transport. As for NKCCB, it is still a puzzle why this macula densa-specific variant, which plays a role in the Cl--sensing step of tubulo-glomerular feedback, has evolved to have the highest apparent affinities of the three variants (9Igarashi P.

The NKCC2 alternatively spliced exons encode the predicted second transmembrane domain (TM2) and the first part of the following intracellular connecting loop (ICL1). Beginning toward the end of predicted TM2 is the stretch of amino acid sequence that is best conserved among all members of the cation chloride superfamily of cotransporters, which includes the NKCCs, the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter (NCC), and the K-Cl cotransporters (KCCs), as well as two transporters whose roles are yet unknown. Among 50 amino acid residues, including the signature GGAYYLIS sequence, more than 40 are identical or highly conserved in most family members. By itself, this degree of conservation suggests a central role in the membrane transport function of the protein, and we have noted that the periodic spacing of these conserved residues suggests a functionally important α-helical structure of the first part of ICL1 (14Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4544-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). This hypothesis has been strongly supported by the preliminary evaluation of the work reported here (15Gimenez I. Forbush III, B. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 26aGoogle Scholar), as well as by related studies in shark NKCC2 (16Gagnon E. Bergeron M.J. Brunet G.M. Daigle N.D. Simard C.F. Isenring P. J. Biol.

Here we present a detailed study of the residues determining ion affinity differences among the three splice variants of mammalian NKCC2. Utilizing a multiple site-directed mutagenesis approach with functional evaluation in Xenopus oocytes, we have pinpointed residues that together appear to be fully responsible for the functional differences among the three variants. No single residue change was found to confer the majority of the difference; rather, it appears that two sets of three residues make up the structural domains that are most involved with ion affinity changes. Importantly, one of these sets of residues is in a region previously sketched to be in ICL1. With a clear involvement in ion translocation, we propose that this region is α-helical and membrane-embedded. Mutagenesis—Full-length cDNA for rabbit NKCC2B in an oocyte expression vector (11Gimenez I. Isenring P. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8767-8770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis using PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (QuikChange, Stratagene). One substitution was performed at a time, and multiple substitutions were created using previous mutants. Individual substitutions were confirmed by sequencing a 600-bp region encompassing the splice region, and end-point mutants containing quadruple, quintuple, or sextuple substitutions were fully sequenced. For simplicity, multiple substitutions are denoted with a shorthand nomenclature. In B-to-F mutants, target residues selected from NKCC2B (Ala238, Thr240, Gly243, Thr249, Ala253, and Tyr257, see Fig. 1, below) are listed before a “/”, followed by the corresponding product residues from the NKCC2F sequence, as in “ATG·/SVT·”. B-to-A mutants are handled similarly: here the original residues are Gly236, Ala238, Val239, Thr240, Gly243, and Tyr257. For further clarity we mark the junction between TM2 and ICL1 with a “·” as in “A·TAY/S·MCV.” Functional Expression in Xenopus laevis Oocytes— cRNA was synthesized from linearized cDNA templates using T7 RNA polymerase (mMessage-mMachine kit, Ambion) and injected in stage IV–VI defolliculated Xenopus oocytes (∼70–90 ng of RNA/oocyte). Oocytes were maintained for 3 days at 17 °C in ND96 medium supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin prior to flux experiments. We measured the function of NKCC2 using a 86Rb influx assay as reported previously (11Gimenez I. Isenring P. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8767-8770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, in the standard influx experiment, oocytes are incubated for 40 min in an influx medium containing: 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm RbCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm Na2SO4, 0.1 mm ouabain, 20 μCi/ml 86RbCl, 5 mm Hepes (pH 7.4 at room temperature). Ion substitution experiments were carried out by replacement of Cl- with gluconate, and by replacement of Na+ or Rb+ with N-methylglucamine. Influx was terminated by rinsing with ice-cold 96 mm potassium gluconate, 2 mm sodium gluconate, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm Na2SO4, 5 mm Hepes, 0.25 mm bumetanide, and 0.1 mm ouabain. Solution changes were executed by transferring oocytes from one well to another in a 48-well plate, and 86Rb in individual oocytes was determined at the end of the experiment by Cerenkov radiation in a scintillation counter. We have previously shown that >90% of the 86Rb uptake in NKCC2-injected oocytes is accounted for by the activity of exogenously expressed cotransporter, and that all of the NKCC2-mediated flux is bumetanide-sensitive (11Gimenez I. Isenring P. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8767-8770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). For most of the experiments in this report, we used a modification of the above procedure that allowed us to make three sequential influx determinations with a single set of oocytes. Following each of three 10-min influx periods in different influx solutions (20 μCi/ml 86Rb), oocytes (6 oocytes per well) were rinsed in ND96, then transferred to a scintillation counter for a 2-min counting period; after counting they were returned to the flux plate for washes and the next influx incubation period. Influx rates were calculated from the difference in counts in the oocytes before and after the influx period, correcting (less than 5%) for counts that left the oocytes during the counting procedure by counting the washes. This method offers a substantial advantage in that it gives internally paired values for fluxes under three different conditions in the same set of oocytes; it has some statistical limitation in the fact that differential influx is harder to measure as the total number of counts in the oocytes increases. Usually we utilized the triple flux procedure to determine 86Rb influx at 10 mm, 40 mm, and 100 mm extracellular [Cl-]in the same set of oocytes. Incubations were carried out in the 10–40-100 order, because this gives the largest influx when the oocytes have accumulated the most counts, thus optimizing signal-to-noise. Control experiments showed that derived Km values were indistinguishable when the order of incubations was changed, and the Km values from this method were also the same whether this method or the standard method was employed (see Fig. 2, below, and compare NKCC2A, B, F to previous reports). Km values were obtained by fitting individual experiments with the Michaelis-Menten (Na+ curves) or Hill equations using non-linear least squares analysis and the simplex algorithm. To determine Km(Cl), the Hill coefficient was fixed at 1.6 (8Isenring P. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24556-24562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It should be noted that Km(Cl) becomes difficult to determine when it is near or above the highest available Cl- concentration, as is the case in NKCC2F and similar constructs. In that regard, the fit routines did not converge for data from two mutants (see Fig. 3, legend), and we have obtained estimated Km values by fitting with Vmax fixed at 6 nmol/oocytes/h, which is in the vicinity of similar constructs. We use “apparent affinity,” and less precisely “affinity,” to describe the inverse of Km, following common usage and recognizing that this is not the true affinity of a transport site itself. The Km of a transport protein is empirically determined and is a complicated function of all binding affinities and rate constants; true affinities cannot be obtained from transport measurements alone. Results are presented as ±S.E. of 3–20 experiments (see Table 1, below); evaluations of statistical significance are carried out with Student’s t test.TABLE 1Kinetic analysis of NKCC2 splice variants mutants Summary of Km(Cl) (mm) and 86Rb influx level (nmol/oocyte/hr) for constructs described in this report. 86Rb influxes mediated by NKCC2 variants and mutants were measured at three different Na+ concentrations (10, 40, 100 mm), and data were fit to the Hill equation (Hill coefficient = 1.6), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For ATG·TY/SVT·MV and ATG·TA/SVT·MC (A) it was necessary to assume Vmax = 6 nmol/oo/h to obtain a stable fit. “Flux” presented in the third data column is the 86Rb influx value (nmol/oocyte/hr) obtained at 100 mm Cl.A: Kinetic analysis of B-to-F mutantsKm±Flux±nWater0.080.054G243D0.050.015NKCC2B11.20.85.00.520NKCC2A38.73.24.60.618NKCC2F122.818.81.40.213B-to-F mutants A238S14.02.83.81.18 T240V16.02.32.40.49G243T21.87.72.10.57 T249M21.86.50.60.110 A253C13.81.15.00.23 Y257V15.24.14.41.25 AT·/SV·21.02.52.50.83 AG·/ST·15.12.62.60.53 TG·/VT·20.53.42.10.46 ·TA/·MC104.140.10.30.04 ·TY/·MV47.010.21.80.55 ·AY/·CV17.96.47.81.44 A·T/S·M24.64.30.80.17 ATG·/SVT·53.77.04.90.86 ·TAY/·MCV47.68.83.91.26 TG·T/VT·M149.286.20.40.13 TG·Y/VT·V36.88.75.40.55 ATG·T/SVT·M100.521.10.80.26 ATG·A/SVT·C61.49.34.61.36 ATG·Y/SVT·V38.05.110.11.66 A·TAY/S·MCV63.23.58.03.03 T·TAY/V·MCV117.66.64.31.33 G·TAY/S·MCV81.44.45.01.23 ATG·TA/SVT·MC110.015.93.10.44 ATG·TY/SVT·MV86.77.03.70.34 ATG·AY/SVT·CV45.24.54.90.33 TG·TY/VT·MV150.627.92.20.33 ATG·TAY/SVT·MCV119.014.24.51.53B: Kinetic analysis of B-to-A mutantsKm±Flux±nNKCC2B11.250.8250.520NKCC2 A38.673.254.570.618NKCC2F122.818.81.450.213B-to-A mutants G236L6.01.23.41.34 A238S12.32.63.70.810 V239T9.22.72.10.96 T240M18.72.53.70.810 G243S11.13.12.40.47 Y257F18.78.42.60.211 TG/MS18.44.52.30.412 ATG·/SMS·20.21.06.51.27 AVT·/STM·27.51.39.33.63 AVG·/STS·23.11.87.32.63 TGY·/MSF·15.82.21.20.24 VTG·/TMS·32.310.16.53.73 AVTG·/STMS·33.74.34.12.15 GAVTG·Y/LSTMS·F39.86.15.51.19 Open table in a new tab For some mutants we carried out Western blot analysis to compare the levels of total NKCC2 protein. Oocytes (4–6 per group) were solubilized in 100 μl of homogenization buffer (1% Triton X-100), and 6 μl of that homogenate were run on SDS gels, blotted, and evaluated with the T4 antibody (18Lytle C. Xu J.C. Biemesderfer D. Forbush III, B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1496-C1505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The three NKCC2 splice variants are most readily distinguished by their apparent chloride affinity: the Km(Cl) ranges from 9 mm in high affinity NKCC2B to 113 mm in low affinity NKCC2F, and NKCC2A is intermediate, with Km(Cl) = 45 mm (values as per Ref. 11Gimenez I. Isenring P. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8767-8770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To elucidate the molecular determinants of this affinity difference, we used the rabbit NKCC2B sequence as a template and made residue substitutions according to the sequence in rabbit NKCC2F (B-to-F mutants) and rabbit NKCC2A (B-to-A mutants). The exon in the NKCC2 gene affected by alternative splicing encodes 32 amino acids (Fig. 1, residues 230–261 in rabbit NKCC2); our analysis was focused on the variations that pose a significant structural change and that are conserved across species. As highlighted in Fig. 1, Ala238, Thr240, Gly243, Thr249, Ala253, and Tyr257 were modified in B-to-F mutants, and Gly236 and Val239 were additionally modified in B-to-A mutants. Residues Determining the Differences in Chloride Affinity between Splice Variants B and F—Fig. 2 presents typical data from characterization of the B-to-F mutants. Western blot analysis of NKCC2 expression (Fig. 2b) confirms that similar levels of protein expression are attained in each of these constructs. Typical flux data, shown in Fig. 2a, illustrate that in addition to changes in Km(Cl), discussed above, the magnitude of the fluxes is also altered by some of these replacements (see also Table 1). Most dramatic is the case of T249M, which shows a 5-fold reduction in cotransport activity. This is most likely due to an effect on Vmax of the cotransporter, because the total expression is similar for all of the constructs (Fig. 2a), although it could also be a result of decreased cell surface delivery of this construct. The transport Vmax in T249M is substantially rescued by simultaneous mutation of Tyr257 and further by mutation of Ala253, demonstrating a cooperative interaction of these three residues; whereas mutation of the three TM2 residues did little to increase the flux rate (Table 1). Km(Cl) values were obtained from the three-point flux assays for 28 of 63 possible combinations of the B-to-F site changes, and the results are presented in Fig. 3. It is seen that by themselves the single substitutions each trended toward lower affinity (higher Km), although only T240V (p = 0.02), and G243T (p = 0.03) and T249M (p = 0.03) reached significance. Individually, it is clear that none of the single substitutions came close to accounting for the full B-to-F effect. Some combinations of two or more substitutions showed additive changes, but there was a wide range of synergism. For residues in TM2, none of the dual combinations produced a significant affinity decrease over individual residue substitutions. However, when all three substitutions were made (ATG·/SVT·) the chloride affinity was lowered 5-fold, to half that of NKCC2F. This result is consistent with the three residues being related in a structurally and functionally important way. Substitution of the three ICL1 residues (·TAY/·MCV) produced a 4.5-fold change in chloride affinity compared with NKCC2B, similar to exchanging the three TM2 residues. In this case the effect was matched or exceeded by two of the dual exchanges, ·TA/·MC and ·TY/·MV. From comparison of the point mutants, and the dual substitutions in these experiments, Thr249 appears to be the most important single residue in determining Cl- affinity. Together, mutation of all six target B-to-F residues (ATG·TAY/SVT·MCV) brought about the full change from B to F chloride affinity (bottom bar, Fig. 3). Comparing this result with the triple mutants in TM2 and ICL1, this is clearly consistent with a combined effect of TM2 and ICL1 sets of residues. This finding supports the identification of these six residues as those involved in the Cl- affinity difference between NKCC2B and NKCC2F. Overall, the outcomes of 4- or 5-change mutations in the B-to-F series were in general agreement with expectations from the simpler combinations. Residues in ICL1 are seen to have a larger effect than those in TM2, and among the ICL1 residues the order of importance is Thr249 >> Ala253 > Tyr257 as it is in the double mutations. Within TM2, the individual effects of Gly243 in combination with ICL1 changes are small but significant (see G·TAY/S·MCV versus ·TAY/·MCV, p = 0.04) whereas only Thr240 has a clearly substantial effect on the B-to-F transition by itself. Overall, residues in TM2 thus rank Thr240 > Gly243 > Ala238 in B-to-F importance. Chloride dependence curves for 86Rb influx are illustrated in Fig. 4a for B-to-F constructs ATG·/SVT·, ·TAY/·MCV and ATG·TAY/SVT·MCV. It can be seen that the 6-residue B-to-F mutant behaves as a wild-type NKCC2F, while constructs bearing triple substitution of one of the two amino acid regions, TM2 or ICL1, have intermediate chloride affinities. These results are in excellent agreement with results obtained from the 3-point flux assays in Fig. 3. Na+ Dependence of Ion Transport in B-to-F Mutants—We examined the Na+ dependence of 86Rb influx in the constructs ATG/SVT and TAY/MCV as well as in NKCC2B and NKCC2F and the 6-residue B-to-F mutant (ATG·TAY/SVT·MCV). The 6-residue mutant had a Km(Na) affinity similar to NKCC2F (Fig. 4b), as was the case for Km(Cl) (Figs. 3 and 4a). Thus the six identified residues account for the kinetic differences between variants B and F in translocation of Na+ as well as Cl-. The Na-K-Cl cotransporter is thought to translocate four ions across the membrane in a single file mechanism in the order Na+, Cl-, K+, Cl- (19Lytle C. McManus T.J. Haas M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C299-C309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is thus intriguing to propose that the TM2 site might bind one ion pair, and ICL1 the other ion pair. If so, we would expect to see Na+ affinity changed by modifications at one site, and K+ affinity changed by modifications at the other site, subject to the caveat that changes in true affinity for one ion are bound to be at least partially reflected in changes in measured Km values for all ions (see Ref. 7Isenring P. Jacoby S.C. Chang J. Forbush B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 549-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Examining TM2 and ICL1 mutants (intermediate curves in Fig. 4b), it is seen that these two sets of residues are about equally involved in determining kinetic differences Km(Na). This appears to rule out the hypothesis that these two sites are involved in binding ion pairs, one for Cl-Na, and the other for Cl-K. In fact the situation was unlikely to have been that simple, because we previously found that two sets of residues in the beginning of TM2, upstream of the B-to-AF residues (corresponding to GV232 and GL237 in the NKCC2B sequence, Fig. 1), mediate affinity differences for Na+ and K+ between shark and human NKCC1s (2Isenring P. Jacoby S.C. Forbush III, B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7179-7184Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Considered together, the NKCC1 and NKCC2 findings argue either: (a) that at least some of the observed Km differences are due to long range effects, or (b) that TM2/ICL1 is not one extended helix, but has at least one hairpin enabling more than one set of amino acid residues to interact with the same transported ion or ion pair. Residues Responsible for the Difference in Chloride Affinity between Splice Variants A and B—Variants A and B of the rabbit NKCC2 cotransporter differ significantly only in chloride affinity (11Gimenez I. Isenring P. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8767-8770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). For B-to-A changes, the only ICL1 difference is the conservative change Y257F, the other candidates all being in TM2: G236L, A238S, V239T, T240M, and G243S (Fig. 1). As seen in Fig. 5, in mutants with these individual substitutions, only the construct T240M exhibits a significant decrease in chloride affinity compared with wild-type NKCC2B (p = 0.001). A construct bearing all six substitutions (GAVTG·Y/LSTMS·F) was indistinguishable from NKCC2A (Fig. 5, bottom), confirming the importance of the candidate residues. We tested a limited set of intermediate B-to-A combinations, as illustrated in Fig. 5. The results demonstrate that Val239, Thr240, and Gly243 (in that rank order) are involved in the B-to-A difference, and together they appear to be sufficient to produce an A-like construct. While there may be effects of Ala238, Gly236, and Tyr257, they are not statistically significant in these experiments. Interestingly, when compared with the B-to-F TM2 substitution ATG·/SVT·, the B-to-A substitution AVTG·/STMS· exhibits less change from parent NKCC2B (p = 0.05), which stresses the critical role of synergistic interaction among different residues in determining ion affinities. A Bartter Mutation in NKCC2 Variant B—Inherited mutations in the NKCC2 gene (SCL12A1) are responsible for the human disease Bartter syndrome type I, which is characterized by salt-wasting, metabolic alkalosis, hypokalemia, and frequently hypotension with normal renin and aldosterone. A genetic analysis of families affected by Bartter syndrome has recently identified a patient with a mild Bartter phenotype bearing a single mutation in exon 4 of NKCC2 that results in a G243D (G224D human) substitution only in the B variant (20Vargas-Poussou R. Feldmann D. Vollmer M. Konrad M. Kelly L. van den Heuvel L.P. Tebourbi L. Brandis M. Karolyi L. Hebert S.C. Lemmink H.H. Deschenes G. Hildebrandt F. Seyberth H.W. Guay-Woodford L.M. Knoers N.V.

We analyzed the functional consequence of this mutation by expression of a G243D rabbit NKCC2 construct in oocytes. Although Western blot analysis demonstrated that G243D was apparently not different from wild-type NKCC2B in its expression (not shown), we found that there was no measurable 86Rb influx carried by the mutated cotransporter (Table 1, water versus G243D, p = 0.5). In molecular terms this is not surprising, because the mutation introduces a fixed negative charge in a region that appears to be involved in coordination of the transported Cl- ions, and Gly243 is one of the residues shown in the present study to be involved in determining high chloride affinity in NKCC2B. The fact that the patient bearing G243D was reported to have only a mild type I Bartter phenotype is consistent with recent knock-out experiments demonstrating overlap of function of NKCC2A and NKCC2B (10Castrop H.

However, the mechanisms of plasmin-catalyzed factor VIII inactivation are poorly understood. In this study, levels of factor VIII activity increased ∼2-fold within 3 min in the presence of plasmin, and subsequently decreased to undetectable levels within 45 min.

The rate constant of plasmin-catalyzed factor VIIIa inactivation was ∼12- and ∼3.7-fold greater than those mediated by factor Xa and activated protein C, respectively. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that plasmin cleaved the heavy chain of factor VIII into two terminal products, A137–336 and A2 subunits, by limited proteolysis at Lys36, Arg336, Arg372, and Arg740. The 80-kDa light chain was converted into a 67-kDa subunit by cleavage at Arg1689 and Arg1721, identical to the pattern induced by factor Xa. Plasmin-catalyzed cleavage at Arg336 proceeded faster than that at Arg372, in contrast to proteolysis by factor Xa. Furthermore, breakdown was faster than that in the presence of activated protein C, consistent with rapid inactivation of factor VIII. The cleavages at Arg336 and Lys36 occurred rapidly in the presence of A2 and A3-C1-C2 subunits, respectively. These results strongly indicated that cleavage at Arg336 was a central mechanism of plasmin-catalyzed factor VIII inactivation.

The factor VIII molecule can be divided into three domains arranged in the order of A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2 according to the amino acid content homology. It is processed into a series of metal ion-dependent heterodimers by cleavage at the B-A3 junction, generating a heavy chain consisting of the A1 and A2 domains, plus heterogeneous fragments of a partially proteolyzed B domain, linked to a light chain consisting of the A3, C1, and C2 domains (2Wood W.I.

The catalytic efficacy of factor VIII in the tenase complex is enhanced over 105 times by conversion into an active form, factor VIIIa, by limited proteolysis by either thrombin or factor Xa (5Eaton D. Rodriguez H. Vehar G.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Both enzymes cleave factor VIII at Arg372 and Arg740 of the heavy chain and produce 50-kDa A1 and 40-kDa A2 subunits. The 80-kDa light chain is also cleaved at Arg1689 generating a 70-kDa A3-C1-C2 subunit. Additionally, factor Xa cleaves at Arg1721 and produces a 67-kDa A3-C1-C2 subunit. Proteolysis at Arg372 and Arg1689 is essential for generating factor VIIIa cofactor activity (6Fay P.J. Blood Rev. 2004; 18: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Cleavage at the former site exposes a functional factor IXa-interactive site within the A2 domain that is cryptic in the unactivated molecule (7Fay P.J. Mastri M. Koszelak M.E. Wakabayashi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12434-12439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cleavage at the latter site liberates the cofactor from its carrier protein, VWF (8Lollar P.

Factor VIIIa cofactor activity is down-regulated in the presence of serine proteases such as APC (5Eaton D. Rodriguez H. Vehar G.A.

Blood. 1992; 80: 3120-3126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by proteolytic inactivation following cleavage at Arg336 within the A1 subunit. This inactivation appears to be the result of altered interaction with the A2 subunit and an increased Km value of the truncated A1 for the substrate factor X (12Koszelak Rosenblum M.E. Schmidt K.

Chem. 1991; 266: 20139-20145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. These events may alter the conformation of A1, limiting the productive interaction with the A2 subunit (13Nogami K. Wakabayashi H. Schmidt K. Fay P.J. J. Biol.

Proteolytic degradation of fibrinogen/fibrin by the serine protease, plasmin, occurs at the end stage of the blood coagulation cascade. Previous reports have suggested, however, that plasmin also regulates blood coagulation by proteolysis of several coagulation proteins, including factor Va (17Omar M.N. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

These findings suggest that plasmin might down-regulate tenase activity by inactivating factor VIII(a), although the exact mechanism of this inactivation is poorly understood. In this study, we report on the mechanism of plasmin-catalyzed factor VIII inactivation. Functional assays and SDS-PAGE analysis using isolated subunits of the cofactor demonstrated for the first time that inactivation was directly associated with unique, limited proteolysis that led initially to three terminal products, A137–336, A2, and A3-C1-C21722–2332, and subsequently to the crucial cleavage at Arg336. Cleavage at Arg336 and Lys36 appeared to be selectively modulated following interaction of the protease with A2 and A3-C1-C2 subunits, respectively. Reagents—Purified recombinant factor VIII preparations were generous gifts from Bayer Corp. (Berkeley, CA). The monoclonal antibodies 58.12 (23O'Brien L.M. Huggins C.F. Fay P.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 3943-3950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and C5 (24Foster P.A. Fulcher C.A. Houghten R.A. de Graaf Mahoney S. Zimmerman T.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1988; 82: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) recognizing the N- and C-terminal end of the A1 domain were gifts from Bayer Corp. and Dr. Carol Fulcher, respectively. The monoclonal antibody JR8 recognizing the A2 domain was obtained from J. R. Scientific Inc. (Woodland, CA). The monoclonal antibody NMC-VIII/10 recognizing the N-terminal end of the A3 domain was purified as described previously (25Shima M. Yoshioka A. Nakajima M. Nakai H. Fukui H. Br. J. Haematol. 1992; 81: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). VWF was purified from factor VIII/VWF concentrates using a gel filtration on a Sepharose CL-4B column (Amersham Biosciences) and immunobeads coated with immobilized factor VIII monoclonal antibody as reported previously (25Shima M. Yoshioka A. Nakajima M. Nakai H. Fukui H. Br. J. Haematol. 1992; 81: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays of factor VIII demonstrated greater than 95% purity of VWF. Phospholipid vesicles containing 10% phosphatidylserine, 60% phosphatidylcholine, and 30% phosphatidylethanolamine (Sigma) were prepared using N-octyl glucoside (26Mimms L.T. Zampighi G. Nozaki Y. Tanford C. Reynolds J.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Purified human Lys-plasmin was purchased from Sigma and was shown to be devoid of factor Xa and APC. Factor Xa, APC, and protein S were purchased from Hematologic Technologies Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). Isolation of Factor VIIIa Subunits—Factor VIII (1.5 μm) was treated overnight at 4 °C in buffer containing 10 mm MES, pH 6.0, 0.25 m NaCl, 50 mm EDTA, and 0.01% Tween 20, and light and heavy chains were isolated following chromatography on SP- and Q-Sepharose columns (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (7Fay P.J. Mastri M. Koszelak M.E. Wakabayashi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12434-12439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Purified heavy chain was cleaved by thrombin, and the A2 and A1 subunits were purified by using Hi-Trap heparin column and Mono Q columns, respectively, as reported previously (12Koszelak Rosenblum M.E. Schmidt K. Freas J. Mastri M. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11664-11669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A3-C1-C2 subunits were purified from thrombin-treated light chain by SP-Sepharose chromatography as described previously (27Jenkins P.V. Dill J.L. Zhou Q. Fay P.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5094-5101Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Factor VIIIa was isolated from thrombin-treated factor VIII by CM-Sepharose chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) (28O'Brien L.M. Mastri M. Fay P.J. Blood. 2000; 95: 1714-1720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A1/A3-C1-C2 dimers were prepared by reconstitution from isolated A1 and A3-C1-C2 subunits by incubation overnight at 4 °C in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.3 m NaCl, 25 mm CaCl2, and 0.01% Tween 20 (13Nogami K. Wakabayashi H. Schmidt K. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1634-1641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE of the isolated subunits followed by staining with GelCode Blue Stain Reagent (Pierce) showed >95% purity. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar). Clotting Assay—Factor VIII(a) activity was measured in a one-stage clotting assay using factor VIII-deficient plasma (30Casillas G. Simonetti C. Pavlovsky A. Coagulation. 1971; 4: 107-111Google Scholar). All reactions were performed at 22 °C. All factor VIII products were incubated in buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.01% Tween 20) plus phospholipid vesicles (10 μm). Samples were removed from the mixtures at the indicated times, and plasmin reaction was immediately terminated by the addition of 0.5 mm Pefabloc SC (Roche Applied Science) and dilution. The presence of plasmin and Pefabloc in the 1000-fold diluted sample was shown not to affect factor VIII activity in the coagulation assay. Cleavage of Factor VIII(a) and Its Subunits by Plasmin—Human plasmin was added to factor VIII(a) and its subunits at a 1:25 ratio (mol/mol) in the presence of phospholipid vesicles (10 μm) in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.01% Tween 20 at 22 °C. Samples were taken at the indicated times, and the reactions were immediately terminated and prepared for SDS-PAGE by adding SDS and boiling for 3 min. Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—SDS-PAGE was performed using 8% gels as described by Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207522) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was carried out using a minigel apparatus (Bio-Rad) at 150 V for 1 h. Bands were visualized following staining with GelCode Blue (Pierce). For Western blotting, each protein sample was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a Bio-Rad mini-transblot apparatus at 50 V for 2 h in buffer containing 10 mm CAPS, pH 11, and 10% (v/v) methanol. Protein bands were probed using the indicated anti-factor VIII monoclonal antibodies followed by goat anti-mouse peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (MP Biomedicals, Aurora, OH). Signals were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Densitometric scans were quantitated using Image J 1.34 (National Institute of Health, Bethesda). N-terminal Sequence Analysis—N-terminal sequence analyses of the fragments following plasmin cleavage of factor VIII were performed using an Applied Biosystems model 491 sequencer (Foster City, CA). The plasmin-cleaved factor VIII fragments were recovered after electrophoresis and were subjected to 10 cycles of automated sequencing. Factor VIII Activation and Inactivation by Plasmin—Earlier reports have described factor VIII inactivation by plasmin (21Holmberg L. Ljung R. Nilsson I.M. Thromb. Res. 1983; 31: 41-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 22Rick M.E. Krizek D.M. Blood. 1986; 67: 1649-1654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, precise inactivation mechanisms remain unclear. We first examined plasmin-catalyzed factor VIII inactivation in the presence of phospholipid and Ca2+ using a one-stage clotting assay. Control experiments confirmed that the presence of either plasmin or Pefabloc did not affect these assays at ∼1000-fold dilution of the reaction mixture. At concentrations of 100 nm factor VIII and 4 nm plasmin, maximum factor VIIIa activity was observed after 3 min and reflected an ∼1.7-fold increase (Fig. 1). This peak activity was followed by a sharp decline to the initial level at 10 min, and finally to an undetectable level within 45 min. Similar results were observed in the absence of phospholipid and/or Ca2+. Factor VIII circulates as a complex with VWF, which protects and stabilizes the cofactor from inactivation, for example, by APC (32Nogami K. Shima M. Nishiya K. Hosokawa K. Saenko E.L. Sakurai Y. Shibata M. Suzuki H. Tanaka I. Yoshioka A. Blood. 2002; 99: 3993-3998Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 33Fay P.J. Couman J.V. Walker F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2172-2177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these experiments, however, the presence of VWF did not affect the reaction between plasmin and factor VIII. Comparison of Factor VIII Inactivation by Plasmin, APC, and Factor Xa—The most potent known serine proteases responsible for factor VIII(a) inactivation are APC and factor Xa. Therefore, we compared factor VIII inactivation by plasmin, APC, and factor Xa in a one-stage clotting assay. Each protease (4 nm) was incubated with factor VIII (100 nm) in the presence of phospholipid as described above. Control experiments showed that the presence of each protease alone did not affect the assays. APC mixed with protein S (1:10 molar ratio) inactivated factor VIII activity in a time-dependent manner with no initial elevation in activity (Fig. 2A). The activity of factor VIII incubated with factor Xa increased ∼2-fold compared with that obtained after the addition of plasmin. However, the characteristic “spike” of factor VIIIa activity observed in the presence of plasmin was not observed with factor Xa. In contrast, a broad activation plateau was seen for ∼15 min and was followed by a slower decrease in activity. The activity of factor VIIIa at any time point likely represents contributions from unactivated molecules, activated molecules, and activated molecules that have decayed following factor VIII subunit dissociation. To precisely evaluate the effect of inactivation of factor VIII by these enzymes, experiments were repeated using active factor VIIIa as a substrate. Each protease (4 nm) was incubated with factor VIIIa (25 nm) in the presence of phospholipid. The findings are illustrated in Fig. 2B. The data were fitted to a single exponential decay curve and showed that the inactivation rate of factor VIIIa activity in the absence of protease, reflecting A2 subunit dissociation from factor VIIIa trimer, was 0.015 ± 0.002 min–1, similar to earlier reports (34Fay P.J. Koshibu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19049-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The rate constants of inactivation of factor VIIIa activity by plasmin, APC, and factor Xa under the same conditions were 1.11 ± 0.09, 0.30 ± 0.04, and 0.09 ± 0.01 min–1, respectively, suggesting that the effect of factor VIIIa inactivation by plasmin was ∼ 3.7- and ∼12-fold greater than that with APC and factor Xa, respectively. Cleavage of Factor VIII by Plasmin and Identification of Cleavage Sites—The factor VIII activation/inactivation patterns induced by plasmin that were characterized by initial mild elevation followed by a rapid reduction in activity, and the difference in inactivation potential between plasmin, APC, and factor Xa, strongly suggest that the mechanism of action of plasmin is different from those of APC and factor Xa. To provide direct evidence for this hypothesis, timed course changes in electrophoretic mobility of plasmin-treated factor VIII were studied using factor VIII (1.5 μm) and plasmin (20 nm) in the presence of phospholipid. SDS-PAGE showed that plasmin sequentially proteolyzed factor VIII at several cleavage sites (Fig. 3A). The ∼180-kDa heavy chain fragments consisting of A1, A2, and full sequenced B domains completely disappeared at 1 min after the addition of plasmin. In contrast, the 90-kDa fragment appeared to increase initially, followed by limited proteolysis into several protein products of apparent 50, 48, 42, 40, and 38 kDa. The 50-, 48-, and 42-kDa products disappeared gradually with time. The 40- and 38-kDa fragments appeared to persist as terminal products at 30 min, in the absence of factor VIII activity. The 80-kDa light chain fragments were degraded sequentially to 70-kDa products and 67-kDa fragments within 45 min. To identify the sites of cleavage, all fragments were subjected to automated N-terminal sequence analysis and compared with the amino acid sequences derived from human factor VIII cDNA (2Wood W.I. Capon D.J. Simonsen C.C. Eaton D.L. Gitschier J. Keyt B. Seeburg P.H. Smith D.H. Hollingshead P. Wion K.L. Delwart E. Tuddenham E.D.G. Vehar G.A. Lawn R.M.

Lawn R.M. Capon D.J. Nature. 1984; 312: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). The results indicated that plasmin cleaved the cofactor at four sites in the heavy chain, Lys36, Arg336, Arg372, and Arg740, and at two sites in the light chain, Arg1689 and Arg1721. These sites appeared to be identical to those cleaved by factor Xa (5Eaton D. Rodriguez H. Vehar G.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 13Nogami K. Wakabayashi H. Schmidt K. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1634-1641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The sequences of several factor VIII products generated from cleavage by plasmin were estimated from the N-terminal sequence, the molecular weights, specificity for cleavage of plasmin, and Western blotting (as described in next paragraph) using anti-factor VIII monoclonal antibodies analyzed recognizing epitope. The amino acid sequences of the 90-, 50-, 48-, 42-, 40-, and 38-kDa fragments derived from the heavy chain were shown to be residues 1–740, 1–372, 337–740, 1–336, 373–740, and 37–336, respectively, and were designated as A1-A2, A11–372, A1337–372-A2, A11–336, A2, and A137–336, respectively. The amino acid sequences of the 70- and 67-kDa fragments derived from the light chain were residues 1690–2332 and 1722–2332, respectively, indicating that the light chain was cleaved by plasmin in the order Arg1689 and Arg1721. The relationship between these fragments is shown schematically in Fig. 3B. Cleavage of the Factor VIII Heavy Chain by Plasmin—Procoagulant factor VIII activity correlates well with the pattern of limited proteolysis of the heavy chain, as represented by cleavage at Arg372 by thrombin and factor Xa for activation, and cleavage at Arg336 by APC and factor Xa for inactivation. We therefore focused on plasmin cleavage of the factor VIII heavy chain using Western blotting (Fig. 4). Products of proteolysis were visualized using two anti-A1 monoclonal antibodies recognizing the N terminus (58.12, Fig. 4A) or C terminus (C5, Fig. 4B) of A1 and one anti-A2 monoclonal antibody (JR8, Fig. 4C). The cleavage sites of the heavy chain by plasmin and epitope regions of factor VIII monoclonal antibodies are schematically illustrated in Fig. 4D. In the presence of factor VIII (500 nm), plasmin (10 nm), and phospholipid, the heavy chain (A1-A2-whole B) was initially converted into A1-A2 subunits by cleavage at Arg740 (Fig. 4, A–C). Subsequently, the A1337–372-A2 fragment appeared to be generated more rapidly than the A2 product (Fig. 4C, inset), suggesting that cleavage at Arg336 occurred more quickly than that at Arg372. Consequently the A11–336 and A1337–372-A2 fragments were generated as intermediate products. These intermediate products were not seen, however, at the 10- and 20-min time points using the anti-A1 antibodies (Fig. 4, A and B, arrows). Because the 58.12 and C5 antibodies recognize the N- and C-terminal regions in A1, respectively, the failure to detect A11–336 and A1337–372-A2 fragments suggests that complete cleavage at Lys36 and Arg372 by plasmin generated terminal products A137–336 and A2. An alternative product, A11–372, generated initially by cleavage at Arg372 was further proteolyzed at Arg336 and Lys36, also resulting in the terminal product A137–336. These results demonstrated that plasmin proteolyzed the heavy chain into A137–336 and A2 subunits by two cleavage pathways, a more predominant cleavage at Arg336 and a minor cleavage at Arg372. Cleavage of the A1 Subunit of Factor VIII(a) by Plasmin, APC, and Factor Xa—The cleavage sites within the A1 subunit are Arg336 for APC and Arg372, Arg336, and Lys36 for factor Xa and plasmin. The changes associated with the activity of factor VIII incubated with proteases in these studies were different, however, suggesting alternative mechanisms. Therefore, to investigate this further, the A1 cleavage pattern mediated by plasmin, APC, and factor Xa was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-A1 antibody 58.12 (Fig. 5A). The addition of APC mixed with cofactor protein S cleaved factor VIII at Arg336 and resulted in the appearance of A11–336 fragments in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 5A, panel b). Factor Xa cleaved initially at Arg740 followed by cleavages at Arg372 and Arg336 (Fig. 5A, panel c), consistent with the earlier reports (5Eaton D. Rodriguez H. Vehar G.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). However, plasmin cleaved the A1 subunit at Arg336 much more rapidly than at Arg372, followed by cleavage at Lys36 at an early time point (Fig. 5A, panel a). These data were consistent with distinct rate-dependent cleavage patterns of the A1 subunit by plasmin, APC, and factor Xa, although the cleavage sites appeared to be similar or identical. Additional experiments, using active factor VIIIa, in place of inactive factor VIII, were devised to quantitate the kinetics of A1 cleavage. Western blotting using 58.12 antibody (Fig. 5B) was utilized to assess both the proteolysis of the A1 subunit in factor VIIIa (left panels) and the rate of loss of intact A11–372 subunit (right panel). The Western blots were analyzed by scanning densitometry, and the data points were extrapolated using a single exponential decay equation. The rate of cleavage of A1 in factor VIIIa (100 nm) by plasmin (4 nm) was 1.53 ± 0.16 min–1 and was ∼3.2 to more than 20-fold greater than that mediated by APC (0.48 ± 0.06 min–1) and factor Xa (0.06 ± 0.01 min–1). These findings were in keeping with earlier reports (15Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. Walker F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20139-20145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Nogami K. Wakabayashi H. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16502-16509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) that inactivation of factor VIIIa can be attributed to A1 proteolysis at Arg336 (and Lys36) and that similar cleavage governs plasmin-catalyzed inactivation of factor VIII. Role of Individual Factor VIIIa Subunits in A1 Subunit Cleavage by Plasmin—To further study the roles and mechanisms of each subunit in factor VIII(a) for plasmin-mediated proteolysis, various factor VIII(a) fragments (100 nm) were used as substrates for plasmin (4 nm), followed by the Western blotting using the anti-A1 58.12 antibody for detection (Fig. 6). Because this antibody, recognizing the N terminus of the A1 subunit, detects A11–336 fragments but not A137–336 fragments, the appearance or disappearance of A11–336 can be attributed to cleavage at Arg336 or Lys36, respectively. The A11–336 fragments derived from factor VIII (Fig. 6A), factor VIIIa (Fig. 6B), and intact heavy chain (Fig. 6C) were identified at an early time point after the addition of plasmin. With A1/A3-C1-C2 dimers (Fig. 6D), little A11–336 was detected, and with isolated A1 subunits (Fig. 6E), the A11–336 fragment was generated very slowly after the addition of plasmin, respectively.

Over the past 20 years, proteasome-dependent proteolysis has proved to play a central role in many major biological functions. The complexity of this degradation pathway led to the discovery of ubiquitin (Ub) 3The abbreviations used are: Ub, ubiquitin; USP2, ubiquitin-specific processing protease 2; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight; UIM, ubiquitin-interacting motif. 3The abbreviations used are: Ub, ubiquitin; USP2, ubiquitin-specific processing protease 2; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight; UIM, ubiquitin-interacting motif.-independent (1Hosoda M.

Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3275) Google Scholar) proteolysis, the latter representing the vast majority of the target proteins discovered so far. While many proteins have been shown to be polyubiquitinated and degraded by the 26 S proteasome, evidence for the involvement of this proteolytic system is often indirect, e.g. the use of proteasome inhibitors of varying specificity. To establish firmly that a given protein is polyubiquitinated in vivo, it is absolutely necessary to possess good antibodies that are able to specifically immunoprecipitate the endogenous protein of interest. This requirement limits the potential discovery of proteasome substrates to proteins with well characterized antibodies directed against them. The 26 S proteasome recognizes and captures ubiquitin conjugates through the 19 S regulatory complex that caps the 20 S proteolytic core. At least two subunits bind Ub-conjugates: S5a/RPN10 and the ATPase S6′ (4Young P. Deveraux Q. Beal R.E. Pickart C.M. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol.

Nature. 2002; 416: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Whereas the sites of polyUb recognition have been studied in depth for S5a (4Young P. Deveraux Q. Beal R.E. Pickart C.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2823-2831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), the mechanism of interaction between S6′ and the polyUb chains remains unknown. Additionally, recombinant S5a can be easily produced and exhibits a polyUb binding activity indistinguishable from that of the proteasome with a very low affinity for mono-, di-, and tri-Ub conjugates which are usually not substrates of the proteasome. By contrast, recombinant S6′ has virtually no polyUb binding activity, which is probably caused by conformational problems or missing partners. Over the past 2 years, new proteomic approaches have emerged for identifying proteasome substrates. The most promising used Myc- or His-tagged Ub-transfected cells (8Peng J.M. Schwartz D. Elias J.E.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5067-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), but other in vitro approaches have been proposed (reviewed in Ref. 11Denison C. Kirkpatrick D.S. Gygi S.P. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2005; 9: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, several drawbacks are linked to tagged Ub strategies. First, transfection of modified Ub can alter cell metabolism by increasing the stability of Ub-conjugates because of lowering their affinity for the proteasome and/or deubiquitinases (10Marotti L.A. Newitt R. Wang Y.Q. Aebersold R. Dohlman H.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5067-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Whereas this technique is suitable for the purification of highly unstable Ub-conjugates, poor substrates (e.g. mono-Ub proteins) could be transformed artificially into polyUb proteins. Second, transfection is limited to cultured cells, while animal and human models represent the final targets. Third, it is impossible to distinguish between mono and polyUb substrates as the purification involves only the tag of the Ub moiety and the identification is based on the signature of one Ub. Fourth, nonspecific interacting proteins are too numerous and false positive proteins cannot be readily distinguished. Others have used the ability of the 19 S proteasome subunit S5a to purify native Ub-conjugates (12Weekes J. Morrison K. Mullen A. Wait R. Barton P. Dunn M.J. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). However, the number of Ub moieties for a given protein is highly variable, which considerably reduces the power of identification of the proteins by subsequent mass spectrometry. To overcome these difficulties, we designed a technique that (i) is applicable to any kind of sample, and (ii) distinguishes between proteins linked covalently to polyUb (i.e. proteasome substrates) and proteins only interacting with polyUb (i.e.“contaminants”). To efficiently purify Ub-conjugates, we used the two steps existing in cells: capture of the Ub-conjugates and release of the substrates by subsequent deubiquitination. We used a partial clone of S5a (MLG) encompassing the two ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIM), which retained the whole binding affinity (4Young P. Deveraux Q. Beal R.E. Pickart C.M. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5461-5467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). We produced an affinity matrix that allowed highly efficient purification of Ub-conjugates with low levels of contaminants. After deubiquitination, proteins were then resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and specific spots were identified by mass spectrometry. Our methodology efficiently isolates polyUb conjugates and allows an easy and highly reproducible identification of proteasome substrates. Using this method in C2C12 myotubes, we report that 20 S proteasome subunits are polyubiquitinated. Plasmids, Constructions, and Recombinant Protein Expression—The His6-MLG in pET26b (gift from Prof. M. Rechsteiner, Salt Lake City, UT) expresses the two polyUb binding sites of S5a (4Young P.

Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) were transformed with pET26b-His6-MLG or with pGEX-5X1-USP2-core and expression was induced according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The His6-MLG recombinant protein was purified using Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen) and then covalently bound to NHS-activated Sepharose® 4 Fast Flow resin (Amersham Biosciences) thereby forming the NHS-His6-MLG affinity matrix used throughout the experiments. The GST-USP2-core was purified using the glutathione-Sepharose® 4B kit (Amersham Biosciences), and the USP2-core was eluted following incubation with Xa factor. Plasmids encoding for the Drosophila GST-D19 and His6-p37A deubiquitinases were kindly provided by Profs. M. Bownes, (Edinburgh, UK) and W. Baumeister, (Martinsried, Germany). Recombinant proteins were produced in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified using glutathione-Sepharose® 4B and Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid beads, respectively, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell Culture—The C2C12 mouse myoblast cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection and routinely grown and differentiated as indicated by the supplier. Myotubes were used at day 6 of differentiation and, when necessary, treated with 50 μm proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Scientific Marketing Associates) for 12 h before cell harvesting. Ub Binding Assays—Synthetic K48-Ub chains (gift from Prof. C. M. Pickart, Baltimore) were used to test the binding capacity of the His6-MLG affinity matrix. We routinely labeled 50 μg of Ub chains with 1 mCi 125I-Na using Iodogen tubes (Pierce). Labeled chains (0.45 μCi) were incubated with 50 μl of 50% slurry of the His6-MLG affinity matrix in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5 for 20 min at room temperature. The slurry was then centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 1 min at room temperature, the supernatant was discarded, and the beads washed three times with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100. Ub chains bound to the matrix were eluted with two volumes of 2× Laemmli and separated by SDS-PAGE followed by analysis using a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Deubiquitination—Deubiquitination was performed on 125I-Ub chains or muscle homogenates using purified deubiquitinases. Incubation conditions are specified for each enzyme and assay in the figure legends. For USP2-core, unless otherwise specified, we routinely incubated 20 ng of the purified enzyme per 30 μg of C2C12 protein homogenates (see below) in deubiquitination buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 2 h at 37°C. UCH-D19 was incubated in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 4 h at 37°C. UCH-p37A was incubated in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 4 h at 25°C. Purification of Native Ub-conjugates—Myotubes were washed and scraped off the plate into 1× phosphate-buffered saline and then sonicated for 30 s at maximum power in lysis buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NEM, 1% Triton X-100/anti-proteases (Protease Inhibitor Mixture/Sigma)). Cell extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 × g (10 min, 4 °C), and the soluble proteins were quantified using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Soluble proteins were then incubated with the MLG matrix for 2 h at room temperature with gentle agitation (1 mg of protein per 1.6 ml of 50% slurry). The beads were washed twice with lysis buffer and then twice in 5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA. Elution was performed either by Laemmli buffer (1× final) or by the USP2-core enzyme for subsequent Western blot or two-dimensional gel analysis. For two-dimensional gel assays, the beads were separated prior to elution into two equal fractions. One fraction was incubated with the active USP2-core (0.4 μg/ml of C2C12 homogenate) at 37 °C for 3 h with gentle agitation in deubiquitination buffer. The other fraction was treated identically except that USP2-core was heat-inactivated (boiled 10 min) and NEM (10 mm, final concentration) was added to the assay. The beads were centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants saved. Beads were then washed in two volumes of incubation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100). The eluate and the washes were combined. Alternatively, series of sucrose gradients were performed using the soluble proteins from C2C12 myotubes treated or not with MG132, except that sonication was avoided. 5 mg of the soluble proteins were directly loaded on top of a 10–40% sucrose gradient (12 ml, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.05% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm NEM) centrifuged at 100,000 × g in a Kontron TST 41.14 rotor for 18 h at 4 °C and aliquoted. Samples were either directly used to perform Western blot analysis or subjected to prior deubiquitination with the native or heat-denatured USP2-core enzyme as described above. When necessary, NEM was neutralized as described (13Lin H.J. Yin L.M. Reid J. Wilkinson K.D. Wing S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20357-20363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Protein standards (GE Healthcare) were systematically used to calibrate series of gradients. Equal amounts of each fraction were loaded onto 12% SDS-PAGE. Western blots were performed using anti-polyUb (1:1,000) (clone FK1, BioMol), anti-Ub (1:650) (Sigma) or anti-β3 (1:1,000) (BioMol) proteasome subunit and analyzed by chemiluminescence (ECF) or autoradiography (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences). Isoelectrofocusing and Gel Analysis—Samples were concentrated and desalted using Centricon-10 filtration units (Millipore) and isoelectrofocusing (IEF) was performed using nonlinear IPG strips (pH 3–10/Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The second dimension was performed using gradient SDS-PAGE (8–16%). Analytical gels were stained using a silver staining procedure, as described (14Piec I. Listrat A. Alliot J. Chambon C. Taylor R.G. Bechet D. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1143-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), scanned with a Image Scanner II Densitometer (GE Healthcare), and analyzed with the ImageMaster Platinum two-dimensional software (v. 6.0, GE Healthcare). Two types of control gels were used. Control gels including samples incubated with the inactivated USP2-core allowed the detection of contaminants mainly arising from recombinant protein purification. However, as proteins possessing a high affinity for Ub chains could represent potential contaminants when Ub-conjugates were eluted by the USP2-core, we added a second control. In another assay, Ub-conjugates bound to the affinity matrix were divided into three parts and eluted with either USP2, heat plus NEM-denatured USP2 or SDS. Spots appearing repeatedly and specifically in gels treated with the active USP2-core and not in the control gels were considered as target proteins, i.e. proteasome substrates. Two independent experiments including four repeats per experiment were performed under the same conditions except that gels used for mass spectrometry analysis were loaded with twice the amount of proteins. Mass Spectrometry—Target spots were excised from preparative gels and proteins were identified using a Voyager-DE Pro MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Perceptive Biosystems), as described (14Piec I. Listrat A. Alliot J. Chambon C. Taylor R.G. Bechet D. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1143-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The identification of proteins was performed according to the Pro-Found and MASCOT probabilistic scores together with the accuracy of the experimental to theoretical pI and Mr. The S5a (MLG Clone) Affinity Matrix Binds Potently to Ub and Endogenous Ub-conjugates—To identify Ub-conjugates in any biological sample, we set up a complete purification technique based on the very steps used by the proteasome to process in vivo Ub-conjugates, i.e. the recognition of Ub-conjugates followed by their deubiquitination (Fig. 1). We designed an affinity matrix based on recombinant, truncated tagged S5a peptide (His6-MLG) encompassing the two polyUb binding sites and covalently bound via an amide bond to the resin. We verified that the MLG affinity matrix binds both synthetic Ub chains and physiological substrates from C2C12 muscle cells (Fig. 2, A and C). By contrast, the MLG peptide showed virtually no affinity for synthetic mono-Ub. Furthermore, the binding of Ub-conjugates on the MLG was specific as no protein was detected when concentrated bacterial lysate was incubated with the MLG matrix (Fig. 2, B and C and not shown). The MLG affinity matrix was able to specifically bind native Ub-conjugates from C2C12 myotubes (Fig. 2, B and C). Ub-conjugates accumulate in cells during highly catabolic situations or when the proteasome is inactivated. We exposed C2C12 cells to MG132 and observed that the accumulation of Ub-conjugates was linear with time up to 12 h (Fig. 2D). Because inhibition of the proteasome resulted in Ub-conjugates accumulation, experiments were performed using a 12-h inhibition of the proteasome. However, following the isolation of polyUb conjugates by the MLG affinity matrix, we consistently observed that a small fraction of material reacting with the polyUb antibody was still present in the unbound fraction (not shown and Figs. 2E and 3E). As the binding capacity of our matrix could be limiting, we tried to further purify the potential Ub-conjugates present in the flow through with fresh MLG. Surprisingly, the second eluate did not show significant levels of polyUb signal, while there was still some in the second flow-through (Fig. 2E). This suggests that this fraction was resistant to the capture by fresh MLG. One possibility may be that different Ub linkages were not retained by our affinity matrix. Previous in vitro observations with synthetic Ub chains concluded that S5a had comparable affinities for synthetic K6, K11, K29, K48, and K63 Ub linkages (6Wang Q.H. Young P. Walters K.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 727-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 7Baboshina O.V. Haas A.L. J. Biol.

K48 linkage targets proteins for degradation by the 26 S proteasome, whereas other linkages are implicated in other pathways, such as nuclear translocation of signaling proteins (K63) (16Geetha T. Kenchappa R.S. Wooten M.W. Carter B.D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3859-3868Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Our work did not identify the nature of the Ub-containing proteins not purified by S5a, but we cannot rule out that conjugates not targeted for degradation (K6, K11, K63) were protected from recognition by the proteasome machinery.FIGURE 2Efficient isolation of Ub-conjugates from MG132-treated C2C12 cells. A, synthetic 125I-labeled Ub chains (K48 linkage) were used to determine the efficiency and specificity of the His6-MLG affinity matrix. 0.45 μCi of labeled chains (Load) were incubated with the His6-MLG matrix (50 μl of 50% slurry) for 20 min at room temperature. Beads were washed, and bound material was eluted (Eluate) by 2 × Laemmli. His6-MLG potently bound synthetic Ub chains but had virtually no affinity for monoubiquitin. B, C2C12 myotubes and BL21(DE3) E. coli were lysed by sonication and French press, respectively, and 30 μg and 1 mg of soluble proteins were, respectively, loaded onto the MLG matrix (50 μl of 50% slurry) for 2 h at room temperature as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Samples were eluted by adding Laemmli sample buffer, loaded onto SDS-PAGE, and silver-stained. The MLG matrix showed high specificity as the vast majority of the C2C12 myotube proteins were not retained by the resin. E. coli proteins (1 mg) also did not bind to the MLG matrix. C, same experiment as in B. Samples eluted by SDS (0.5% final) were used for Western blot analysis using an anti-polyUb antibody. Native Ub-conjugates from C2C12 lysates efficiently bound to the MLG matrix (lane 2), but no signal was detected when E. coli lysate was used (lane 3). D, upon MG132 treatment, Ub-conjugates accumulated in the soluble fraction of C2C12 cells in a time-dependent fashion. C2C12 myotubes were treated with 50 μm MG132 for up to 12 h. Cell viability was not affected by 12 h of treatment (not shown). 30 μg of C2C12 soluble proteins per time point were loaded onto SDS-PAGE. Anti-polyUb antibody revealed a time-dependent accumulation of Ub-conjugates (left panel) that was quantified by densitometry (3-fold increase, right panel) using the ImageJ software (NIH, v. 1.34s). E, purification of Ub-conjugates was efficient. A first purification of C2C12 Ub-conjugates (30 μg of soluble proteins) was performed using the His6-MLG matrix (50 μl of 50% slurry, 2 h at room temperature), and the unbound material (Flow through) was subjected to a second round of purification with fresh beads. Beads from both round of purification were treated with SDS (0.5% final) for 10 min at room temperature, and the eluates were analyzed by Western blot using the anti-polyUb antibody. The second step of purification did not appreciably increase the amount of purified Ub-conjugates and a faint smear of residual protein revealed by the anti-polyUb antibody was still present in the unbound material after round 2. The amount of residual reactive material was highly comparable throughout experiments (see Fig. 3, G).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3The testis USP2-core is a potent deubiquitinating enzyme for both synthetic and native Ub chains. Three deubiquitinases were tested for their ability to trim synthetic Ub chains. A, 125I-Ub chains (Load) were incubated with either 2 μg of UCH-D19 or 2 μg of UCH-p37A. The reaction was stopped by addition of Laemmli buffer (1× final), and samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. Ub chains were not cleaved by these enzymes. B, USP2-core depolymerizes polyUb chains. K48-linked 125I-Ub chains were incubated with increasing amounts of USP2-core (0–20 ng) in deubiquitination buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of Laemmli buffer (1× final). Autoradiography revealed that the Ub chains were efficiently disassembled with a corresponding accumulation of mono-Ub. C, C2C12 soluble proteins (30 μg) were treated with either 20 ng of native USP2-core or buffer and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Immunoblot analyses of the products with anti-polyUb antibody revealed an almost complete disappearance of Ub-conjugates upon treatment with USP2-core. D, USP2-core enzyme specifically trimmed C2C12 Ub-conjugates and accumulated mono-Ub. Soluble proteins (30 μg) of the soluble fraction of C2C12 myotubes were exposed to USP2-core as described above with or without the inhibitors Ub-aldehyde or NEM. A Western blot was performed using an antibody that recognizes both mono and polyUb to visualize the accumulation of mono-Ub following USP2-core treatment. Note, Ub-aldehyde is also recognized by the antibody. Treatment of the soluble fraction with either Ub-aldehyde (0.5 μm) or NEM (10 mm) inhibited the deubiquitination of the Ub-conjugates. E, Ub-conjugates purified with the His6-MLG affinity matrix were efficiently deubiquitinated in situ. Ub-conjugates were purified from 30 μg of C2C12 soluble proteins using 50 μl of the MLG affinity matrix as described above. The unbound proteins were saved for Western blot analysis (Flow through). The polyUb proteins bound on beads were divided and eluted with either 0.5% SDS (SDS eluate) or USP2-core (USP2 eluate). Eluates were collected, and 2× Laemmli buffer was also added to the beads and boiled. All samples were analyzed by immunoblot with anti-Ub antibodies. PolyUb detection revealed that both elution techniques were powerful as virtually no Ub-conjugate was present on the beads after elution (not shown). Load, starting material. Flow through, after pelleting the beads, the supernatant was concentrated and loaded onto the gel. The asterisk denotes a cross-reacting band. F, increased amounts of USP2-core did not improve deubiquitination. 30 μg of soluble proteins from C2C12 myotubes (Load) were incubated with varying amounts of USP2-core for 3 h at 37°C. Western blot with anti-polyUb antibodies revealed that 20 ng of USP2-core were sufficient to reach maximal deubiquitination although a faint smear of immunoreactive material was still present. G, immunoreactive material resistant to purification by the His6-M6-LG affinity matrix or to deubiquitination by the USP2-core enzyme was analyzed by densitometry (ImageJ v.1.34s). Thirty micrograms of C2C12 soluble proteins were used for each assay, and five independent experiments were pooled. The unbound (+His6-MLG) or not deubiquitinated (+USP2-core) fractions were expressed as percent of starting material (Load). We observed indistinguishable levels of remaining material revealed by the anti-polyUb antibody after purification or deubiquitination. H, Ub-conjugates were purified from 60 μg of C2C12 soluble proteins using the MLG matrix. The beads were divided in 2 equal fractions, and elution was performed using native (+) or heat plus NEM-inactivated (–) USP2-core (20 ng). Following the elutions, the beads were further treated using 0.5% SDS. Fractions were analyzed by anti-polyUb antibody. The immunoblot revealed that the USP2-core efficiently disassembled the Ub chains thus eluting proteasome substrates. The inactivated USP2-core is a good control as there was no detectable loss of Ub-conjugates. I, an experiment identical to the one shown in G was performed, and the gel was silver-stained. Our purification procedure eliminated most of the cellular proteins present in the sample (Flow through). The amount of starting material per assay (30 μg soluble proteins) was too low to detect Ub-conjugates by silver staining.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The USP2-Core Enzyme Potently Deubiquitinates S5a-bound Ub-conjugates—Deubiquitinase families have defined roles in the cell, such as recycling the Ub chains, proofreading conjugates or processing Ub precursors (17Nijman S.M.B.

https://openalex.org/W2042559258,"Modulation of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel surface expression can profoundly affect neuronal excitability. Some, but not all, mammalian Shaker or Kv1 alpha subunits contain a dominant endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal in their pore region, preventing surface expression of Kv1.1 homotetrameric channels and of heteromeric Kv1 channels containing more than one Kv1.1 subunit. The critical amino acid residues within this ER pore-region retention signal are also critical for high-affinity binding of snake dendrotoxins (DTX). This suggests that ER retention may be mediated by an ER protein with a domain structurally similar to that of DTX. One facet of such a model is that expression of soluble DTX in the ER lumen should compete for binding to the retention protein and allow for surface expression of retained Kv1.1. Here, we show that luminal DTX expression dramatically increased both the level of cell surface Kv1.1 immunofluorescence staining and the proportion of Kv1.1 with processed N-linked oligosaccharides. Electrophysiological analyses showed that luminal DTX expression led to significant increases in Kv1.1 currents. Together, these data showed that luminal DTX expression increases surface expression of functional Kv1.1 homotetrameric channels and support a model whereby a DTX-like ER protein regulates abundance of cell surface Kv1 channels."
https://openalex.org/W1986514539,"Homomeric α7 and heteromeric α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) can be distinguished by their pharmacological properties, including agonist specificity. We introduced point mutations of conserved amino acids within the C loop, a region of the receptor critical for agonist binding, and we examined the expression of the mutant receptors in Xenopus oocytes. Mutation of either a conserved C loop tyrosine (188) to phenylalanine or a nearby conserved aspartate (197) to alanine resulted in α7 receptors for which the α7-selective agonist 3-(4-hydroxy, 2-methoxybenzylidene) anabaseine (4OH-GTS-21) had roughly the same potency as for wild-type receptors, whereas the physiologic agonist acetylcholine (ACh) showed drastically reduced potency for these mutant receptors. Corresponding mutations in α4 receptors co-expressed with β2 resulted in α4β2 receptors for which ACh potency was relatively unchanged, although the efficacy of the α7-selective agonist 4OH-GTS-21 was increased greatly relative to that of ACh. We also investigated the significance of a conserved lysine (145 in α7), proposed to form a stable salt bridge with Asp-197 in the resting state of the receptor. Mutations of this residue in both α7 and α4 resulted in receptors that were largely unresponsive to both ACh and 4OH-GTS-21. Our results suggest that initiation of gating depends both on specific interactions between residues in the C loop domain and, depending on receptor subtype, the physiochemical properties of the agonist, so that in the altered environment of the α4Y190F-binding site, large hydrophobic benzylidene anabaseines may close the C loop and initiate channel gating more effectively than the polar agonist ACh.

Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are homo- or heteropentameric receptors belonging to the Cys loop superfamily of receptor channels. These receptors allow the flow of cations across the membrane in response to agonist binding. The determination of the crystal structure of a soluble acetylcholinebinding protein (AChBP) 3The abbreviations used are: AChBP, acetylcholine-binding protein; nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; ACh, agonist acetylcholine; BA, benzylidene anabaseine; 4-OH-GTA-21, 3-(4-hydroxy, 2-methoxybenzylidene) anabaseine; MLA, methyllycaconitine. 3The abbreviations used are: AChBP, acetylcholine-binding protein; nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; ACh, agonist acetylcholine; BA, benzylidene anabaseine; 4-OH-GTA-21, 3-(4-hydroxy, 2-methoxybenzylidene) anabaseine; MLA, methyllycaconitine. from Lymnaea stagnalis has provided a structural template for the nicotinic ACh receptor extracellular domain (1Smit A.B. Syed N.I. Schaap D. van Minnen J. Klumperman J. Kits K.S. Lodder H. van der Schors R.C. van Elk R. Sorgedrager B. Brejc K. Sixma T.K. Geraerts W.P. Nature. 2001; 411: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). This crystal structure revealed that the ligand was bound at the interface between the “plus” and “minus” face of the receptor protomers. In the case of heteromeric receptors (e.g. α4β2), there are three “loops” from the α subunit (referred to as the A, B, and C loops) that form the principal face and interact with three loops (D, E, and F) from the non-α subunit that forms the complementary face. In the case of α7, which forms homomers, each of the five α7 subunits is thought to contribute to the primary face of one binding site and the complementary face of another, so that there may be as many as five ACh-binding sites per receptor (2Palma E. Bertrand S. Binzoni T. Bertrand D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 491: 151-161Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The α7-type receptors have been proposed as therapeutic targets for both central nervous system pathologies such as Alzheimer and schizophrenia (3Kem W.R. Behav. Brain Res. 2000; 113: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 4Martin L.F. Kem W.R. Freedman R. Psychopharmacology. 2004; 174: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) as well as for inflammation (5Wang H. Yu M. Ochani M. Amella C.A. Tanovic M. Susarla S. Li J.H. Yang H. Ulloa L. Al-Abed Y. Czura C.J. Tracey K.J. Nature. 2003; 421: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (2193) Google Scholar). Benzylidene anabaseine (BA) compounds, such as 3-(4-hydroxy, 2-methoxybenzylidene) anabaseine (4OH-GTS-21), are α7-selective agonists. 4OH-GTS-21 has been shown to be cytoprotective in both human and rat cells (6Meyer E. Kuryatov A. Gerzanich V. Lindstrom J. Papke R.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 287: 918-925PubMed Google Scholar). An interesting property of α7 receptors is that they are far more permissive than other nicotinic receptor types in responding to structurally diverse agonists; large hydrophobic agonists such as benzylidene anabaseines and, paradoxically, smaller agonists such as choline are selective for α7 receptors (7Papke R.L. Bencherif M. Lippiello P. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 213: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). It is thought that a larger, more hydrophobic environment in the α7 ligand-binding domain, compared with other receptor subtypes, is the basis for the selectivity of these receptors for BA-type agonists. In particular, a phenylalanine residue in the C loop has been suggested to make the ligand-binding domain of α7 more accommodating for the binding of large hydrophobic agonists such as GTS-21 (8Stokes C. Papke J.K.P. McCormack T. Kem W.R. Horenstein N.A. Papke R.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Other groups have made point mutations in the conserved amino acids in the C loop of nicotinic receptors. Although most of these studies have looked at the α1 subunit, sequence conservation of key residues suggests a common activation mechanism for different receptor types (9Mukhtasimova N. Free C. Sine S.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 126: 23-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Studies conducted before the identification of a structural template for the extracellular domain was available reached various conclusions about the importance of conserved C loop amino acids, particularly regarding mutation of a conserved tyrosine, two amino acids upstream of the vicinal cysteines. Whereas Sine et al. (10Sine S.M. Quiram P. Papanikolaou F. Kreienkamp H.J. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8808-8816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) concluded that agonist binding affinity was affected by the Tyr-to-Phe mutant, O’Leary and White (11O'Leary M.E. White M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8360-8365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) asserted that this mutant interfered with the coupling of ligand binding and channel opening. With a structural template for nicotinic receptors now available, we can interpret the effect of mutations in the C loop of α7 and α4β2 receptors within the context of their structural topology. ACh Receptor Clones—The human nAChR receptor clones were obtained from Dr. Jon Lindstrom (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia). The α7 gene was subcloned into the pCI-neo vector (Promega, Madison WI) between the NheI and NotI restriction sites. Site-directed Mutants—The structural orientations of conserved residues in the AChBP and nicotinic ACh receptor model C loops were analyzed to choose functionally important residues. Mutations to α7 and α4 were introduced using the QuikChange kit from Stratagene according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Amino acids are numbered as for human α7 (with vicinal cysteines at positions 190 and 191). The mutations were confirmed with automated fluorescent sequencing. Preparation of RNA—Subsequent to linearization and purification of cloned cDNAs, RNA transcripts were prepared in vitro using the appropriate mMessage mMachine kit from Ambion Inc. (Austin TX). Molecular Modeling—Energy-minimized structures of anabaseine and anabasine in their monoprotonated forms were obtained by semi-empirical calculations (MOPAC 2000, PM3 parameter set). Models of the human α7 and α4β2 nAChR extracellular domains were obtained by homology modeling with the AChBP crystal structures with bound nicotine or methyllycaconitine (Protein Data Bank codes 1UW6 and 2BYR). The SwissPDB viewer was used to create alignments between the appropriate AChBP and nAChR, followed by structure generation with the Magic Fit option, and side chain optimization within the Gromos force field, as described by Le Novere (12Le Novere N. Grutter T. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3210-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Possible binding modes for benzylidine anabaseine were identified with the DOCK program (version 5.3.0). Expression in Xenopus laevis Oocytes—Mature (>9 cm) female X. laevis African frogs (Nasco, Ft. Atkinson WI) were used as a source of oocytes. Before surgery, the frogs were anesthetized by placing them in a 1.5 g/liter solution of MS222 for 30 min. Oocytes were removed from an incision made in the abdomen. Harvested oocytes were treated with 1.25 mg/ml collagenase (Worthington) for 2 h at room temperature in calciumfree Barth’s solution (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.38 mm NaHCO3, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 12 mg/liter tetracycline) to remove the follicular layer. Stage 5 oocytes were isolated and injected with 50 nl (5-20 ng) of each subunit cRNA. Recordings were normally conducted 2-5 days post-injection, although for some mutants longer periods of incubation (up to 8-10 days) were required to obtain measurable currents. Wild-type and mutant α7 receptors were routinely co-injected with the cDNA for human RIC-3, an accessory protein that improves and accelerates α7 expression (13Halevi S. Yassin L. Eshel M. Sala F. Sala S. Criado M. Treinin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34411-34417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), without affecting the pharmacological properties of the receptors. Electrophysiology—Experiments were conducted using OpusXpress6000A (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). OpusXpress is an integrated system that provides automated impalement and voltage clamp of up to eight oocytes in parallel. Both the voltage and current electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl. The oocytes were clamped at a holding potential of -60 mV. Data were collected at 50 Hz and filtered at 20 Hz for α7 and at 5 Hz for α4β2. The oocytes were bath-perfused with Ringer’s solution (115 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm KCl, and 1.8 mm CaCl2, pH 7.3) with 1 μm atropine. Agonist solutions were delivered from a 96-well plate using disposable tips. Flow rates were set at 2 ml/min for α7 and 4 ml/min for α4β2. Drug applications alternated between ACh controls and test solutions of ACh, 4OH-GTS-21, or other experimental agonists at varying concentrations. Chemicals—4OH-GTS-21 was obtained from Taiho (Tokyo, Japan). Anabaseine and other benzylidene anabaseines were provided by Dr. Bill Kem (University of Florida). TC-1698 and AR-R17779 were provided by Targacept, and tropisetron was provided by Memory Pharmaceuticals. Other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Fresh acetylcholine stock solutions were made daily in Ringer’s solution. Experimental Protocols and Data Analysis—Responses of α7 wild-type and mutant receptors were calculated as net charge (14Papke R.L. Papke J.K.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 137: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), and unless otherwise indicated, responses of α4β2 wild-type and mutant receptors are reported as peak currents. Each oocyte received initial control applications of ACh, then experimental drug applications, and follow-up control applications of ACh. For wild-type α7 receptors, the control ACh concentration was 300 μm, a concentration that is sufficient to evoke maximal net charge responses (14Papke R.L. Papke J.K.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 137: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). For α7 mutants that showed decreased responsiveness to ACh, 3 mm was used for the ACh controls. For both mutant and wild-type α4β2 receptors, ACh controls were 30 μm unless otherwise indicated. Responses to experimental drug applications were calculated relative to the preceding ACh control responses to normalize the data, compensating for the varying levels of channel expression among the oocytes. Mean values and standard errors were calculated from the normalized responses of at least four oocytes for each experimental concentration. For concentration-response relations, data derived from net charge analyses were plotted using Kaleidagraph 3.0.2 (Abelbeck Software; Reading, PA), and curves were generated from the Hill Equation 1, Response=Imax[agonist]n[agonist]n+(EC50)nEq. 1 where Imax denotes the maximal response for a particular agonist/subunit combination, and n represents the Hill coefficient. Imax, n, and the EC50 values were all unconstrained for the fitting procedures, except in the case of the ACh-response curves. Because ACh is our reference full agonist, for the ACh concentration-response curves the data were normalized to the observed ACh maximum, and the Imax of the curve fits were constrained to equal 1. Intact Oocyte Binding—MLA binding on intact oocytes was conducted as reported previously (15Placzek A.N. Grassi F. Meyer E.M. Papke R.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In brief, whole Xenopus oocytes that were either uninjected or had been injected with mRNAs encoding either wild-type α7 or the α7K145A or α7K145D/D190K mutants were placed in single wells of a 96-well plate containing either 20 nm [3H]methyllycaconitine alone or 20 nm [3H]methyllycaconitine with 5 mm nicotine. After three 4-s washes in 2.5 ml of Ringer’s solution, total radioactivity was measured using an automated liquid scintillation counter and then expressed as femtomoles of MLA binding/cell. The mean values for binding in the presence of nicotine for each treatment (n = 4-5 cells) were subtracted from each of the non-nicotine-treated cells for each condition (n = 4-5 cells), yielding mean and S.E. values for nicotine displaceable binding. Cells from the same injection sets were also tested for their responses to 1 mm ACh or 100 μm 4OH-GTS-21. ACh and 4OH-GTS-21 Concentration-Response Relationships for α7 Wild-type and Mutant Receptors—There are several highly conserved amino acid residues in the C loop of nicotinic receptors. The side chains of two particular amino acids, Tyr-188 (human α7 numbering) and Asp-197, that are conserved in nicotinic receptors and AChBP appeared to be in close proximity in models of the receptor-binding site. We conducted site-directed mutagenesis to determine whether these residues interact with agonists and/or with each other. A tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation was introduced at amino acid position 188. ACh showed a drastic decrease in potency for this mutant receptor (Fig. 1). The EC50 in the wild type was 33 μm, whereas the Y188F mutant had an EC50 of 1500 μm (Table 1). This result is consistent with studies conducted by Galzi et al. (16Galzi J.L. Bertrand D. Devillers-Thiery A. Revah F. Bertrand S. Changeux J.P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that this mutation, known to have a large effect on activation by the small, very polar, agonist ACh might have relatively little effect on activation by larger hydrophobic α7-selective agonists such as 4OH-GTS-21. As shown in Fig. 1, α7Y188F receptors responded well to 4OH-GTS-21, and there was no significant change in the potency of this agonist (Table 1). The tyrosine at position 188 in α7 has been proposed to be part of an amino acid triad that is essential for initiating the gating for nAChR (9Mukhtasimova N. Free C. Sine S.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 126: 23-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The other two elements of this triad are the aspartate at 197 and the lysine at 145, which have been proposed to form a salt bridge in the resting state of the receptor. We mutated Asp-197 to alanine, which would have the effect of disrupting the putative salt bridge to Lys-145 and any potential hydrogen bonding to Tyr-188. The D197A mutation in α7 also resulted in receptors for which responses to 300 μm ACh were severely reduced compared with wild type (Fig. 1). As in the case of the Tyr-188 mutation, this was associated with a reduction in ACh potency (Table 1). The α7D197A mutant showed an EC50 of 430 μm, in contrast to the wild type, which had an EC50 of 33 μm. As in the case of the Y188F mutation, the D197A mutation had no effect on the potency of 4OH-GTS-21 and produced a small but significant increase in the efficacy of the benzylidene anabaseine compared with ACh.TABLE 1Values derived from curve fitsACh EC5040H-GTS-21 EC5040H-GTS-21 % ACh maximumNicotine EC50Nicotine % ACh maximumα7 receptorsWild type33 ± 4 μM14 ± 1 μM40 ± 1%13 ± 2 μM81 ± 4%α7D197A430 ± 25 μM8 ± 1 μM55 ± 2%73 ± 8 μM77 ± 3%α7Y188F1500 ± 164 μM14 ± 2 μM56 ± 2%230 ± 5 μM85 ± 2%α7K145A1500 ± 260 μM22 ± 11 μM29 ± 3%α7K145D/D197K2900 ± 120 μM37 ± 3 μM70 ± 2%α4-Containing receptors and mutantsWild type α4β275 ± 20 μMNAaNA indicates the values not available because of the inadequate amplitude of responses.≤2%1.6 ± 0.5 μM20 ± 2%α4D199Aβ2115 ± 17 μM300 ± 100 nM20 ± 2%9 ± 2 μM25 ± 3%α4Y190Fβ276 ± 9 μM2.2 ± 0.2 μM450 ± 14%7 ± 2 μM32 ± 2%α4K145Aβ2NANANAα4K145D/D199Kβ2NA2.6 ± 0.3 μM1240 ± 40%α4Y190Fβ2Y114S60 ± 30 μM580 ± 140 nM160 ± 10%α4β2Y114S1.4 ± 0.2 μMNA≤2%Wild type α4β425 ± 2 μM1.6 ± 0.6 μM2.1 ± 0.2%α4Y190Fβ41260 ± 140 μM2.2 ± 0.1 μM55 ± 2%α4Y190Fβ4S116Y1040 ± 20 μM1.0 ± 0.5 μM30 ± 4%α4β4S116Y4.8 ± 0.8 μMNA≤2%a NA indicates the values not available because of the inadequate amplitude of responses. Open table in a new tab ACh and 4OH-GTS-21 Concentration-Response Relationships for α4β2 Wild-type and Mutant Receptors—To determine whether residues of α4 that are homologous to Tyr-188 and Asp-197 of α7 also regulate the potency of ACh for the high affinity receptors of the brain, we made the corresponding mutations in the human α4 subunit (α4Y190F and α4D199A). As shown in Fig. 2, the ACh concentration-response curves for these mutants were not significantly different from those of wild-type α4β2. 4OH-GTS-21 is highly selective for wild-type α7 receptors compared with α4β2 receptors, normally evoking responses from α4β2 receptors that are no more than 2% of the ACh maximum responses (Fig. 2). Interestingly, although the Y190F and D199A mutations in α4 did not appear to affect ACh potency, they had striking effects on the efficacy of 4OH-GTS-21 for α4β2-type receptors. As shown in Fig. 2, 4OH-GTS-21 is a very efficacious agonist for α4Y190Fβ2 receptors, more so even than ACh. A full concentration-response study showed that the maximum currents stimulated by 4OH-GTS-21 were 4-5-fold larger than the maximal currents that could be stimulated by ACh in the same cells. The α4D199Aβ2 receptors also showed increased responses to 4OH-GTS-21 (Fig. 2) compared with wild-type α4β2 receptors but much less than was seen with the α4Y190Fβ2 receptors. Specifically, for α4Y190Fβ2 receptors there was at least a 200-fold increase in relative efficacy 4OH-GTS-21 compared with wild type, and for α4D199Aβ2 receptors there was only a 10-fold increase in 4OH-GTS-21 efficacy relative to wild type (Table 1). The α4Y190F mutants were also co-expressed with β4 (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Interestingly, the effects of the mutation were clearly intermediate between those obtained with the Y188F mutation in α7 and the α4Y190F mutation expressed with β2. Specifically, there was a shift in ACh potency, roughly half as large as that seen in the α7 mutants, and there was also a large increase in 4OH-GTS-21 efficacy relative to ACh. The maximal response of wild-type α4β4 receptors to 4OH-GTS-21 was only about 2% of the ACh maximum, and the maximum responses of α4Y190Fβ4 receptors to 4OH-GTS-21 were increased to 55% of the ACh maximum responses obtained. The specialization of β subunits for agonist binding are thought to focus in regions identified as the D, E, and F loops of the binding site. Differences in the effect of the α4Y190F mutation when co-expressed with β2or β4 on ACh potency may therefore be due to differences between β2 and β4in these regions. Because the effect of the Tyr-190 mutant on ACh potency is similar between α7 and α4Y190F co-expressed with β4, it might be due to similarities between α7 and β4in these domains. The sequences of the β2, β4, and α7D, E and F loops are shown in Sequence 1, As shown above, there are two residues in the E loop where β4 diverges from β2 and has residues in common with α7. Of these two residues, the tyrosine/serine difference is potentially the more significant difference. It was shown previously that in human α7, this serine residue, along with the glycine residue in the F loop, determined the potency difference of GTS-21 between rat and human α7 (8Stokes C. Papke J.K.P. McCormack T. Kem W.R. Horenstein N.A. Papke R.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, we created β2Y114S and β4S116Y mutants, and this residue does not appear to be a critical factor for the β subunit-dependent differences in the α4Y190F effects. Specifically, when co-expressed with wildtype α4, the β2Y114S mutation had the effect of increasing ACh potency, decreasing the EC50 from 75 ± to 1.4 ± 0.2 μm (Table 1). However, co-expressed with wild-type α4, the β4S114Y mutant also had a similar, albeit smaller, effect of increasing ACh potency, decreasing the EC50 from 25 ± 2to4.8 ± 0.8 μm (Table 1). When co-expressed with α4Y190F, neither β subunit mutation had a significant effect on ACh potency and both produced decreases in the relative efficacy of 4OH-GTS-21 compared with ACh (Table 1). Noncompetitive Antagonism of Mutant α4β2 Receptors Occurs at High Concentrations of 4OH-GTS-21—It has been reported previously that in addition to being a very weak (≤2%) partial agonist for wild-type human α4β2 receptors, 4OH-GTS-21 is also a use-dependent antagonist (6Meyer E. Kuryatov A. Gerzanich V. Lindstrom J. Papke R.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 287: 918-925PubMed Google Scholar). This sensitivity to channel block by 4OH-GTS-21 at high concentrations was retained in α4 mutants that were strongly activated by 4OH-GTS-21. As shown in Fig. 4, when 4OH-GTS-21 was applied to either α4Y190Fβ2 or α4D199Aβ2 receptors at concentrations above 10 μm, there was an initial spike followed by a depression in the response and a subsequent rebound as the 4OH-GTS-21 was washed from the chamber. This is very typical for use-dependent channel block (17Philipson K.D. Gallivan J.P. Brandt G.S. Dougherty D.A. Lester H.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C195-C206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To better characterize the concentration dependence of this antagonist activity, we calculated the ratio of rebound-to-peak currents from α4Y190Fβ2 receptors across a range of 4OH-GTS-21 concentrations (Fig. 4). From this analysis, the IC50 for channel block by 4OH-GTS-21 was estimated to be about 100 μm, whereas the EC50 for activation by 4OH-GTS-21 was approximately 2 orders of magnitude lower (1 μm). The noncompetitive inhibition of wildtype α4β2 receptors also was a relatively low potency effect (6Meyer E. Kuryatov A. Gerzanich V. Lindstrom J. Papke R.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 287: 918-925PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the antagonism seen with the mutants is the retention of a wild-type feature and not the result of the mutations per se. Potency of Nicotine for Wild-type and Mutant α7 and α4β2 Receptors—We investigated the effect of nicotine on α7 and α4β2 mutants. This molecule represents a putative structural intermediate between smaller acyclic agonists like ACh and larger aromatic ringed agonists such as 4OH-GTS-21 and has been crystallized in the AChBP (18Celie P.H. van Rossum-Fikkert S.E. van Dijk W.J. Brejc K. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Neuron. 2004; 41: 907-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). In the AChBP the binding of nicotine appeared to more directly involve the homolog of Tyr-188 than did the binding of ACh. However, we found that the effects of the Y188F and D197A mutations on activation by nicotine were less pronounced than the effects on activation of ACh. The EC50 of nicotine for the Y188F α7 mutant increased to 230 μm from the wild-type value of 13 μm (Table 1), whereas the EC50 for the Asp-to-Ala mutant was 73 μm, so the potency shifts were less than half the magnitude of the changes in the ACh potency. There was also very little change in efficacy of nicotine for these mutants. The percent ACh maximum current of nicotine for the two mutants was approximately the same as for the wild-type value of 81%. In the α4β2 receptors we observed a modest decrease in potency of nicotine for the mutant receptors (Table 1). The EC50 for nicotine was 1.6 μm in the wild type, 9 μm in the D199A mutant, and 7 μm Y190F mutant (Table 1). As seen for α7, the % ACh maximum of nicotine for these mutant receptors did not differ significantly from the wild-type value of 20%. Structural Features α7-Selective Agonists Showing Enhanced Activation of α4 Mutants—Numerous agonists, varying greatly in structure, have been identified that selectively activate the α7 nAChR. We have previously proposed a general model for key elements common to most of these α7-selective drugs (19Papke R.L. Zheng G. Horenstein N.A. Dwoskin L.P. Crooks P.A. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2005; 15: 3874-3880Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To resolve the structure-activity determinants for the tyrosine and aspartate mutants in α4β2 receptors, we tested whether α4Y190Fβ2 mutants responded to other α7-selective agonists or core structures related to those agonists. As shown in Fig. 5, all of the benzylidene anabaseines tested were capable of activating the α4Y190Fβ2 receptors, although no others were as efficacious as 4OH-GTS-21 at the test concentration. In contrast, neither the tropane-based agonist tropisetron nor the quinuclidinebased compounds (quinuclidine and AR-R17779) produced significant activation. Likewise, choline did not activate the α4Y190Fβ2 mutants. Interestingly, TC-1698, which has a structure intermediate to anabaseine and quinuclidine, did show good activation of the mutant α4Y190Fβ2 receptors at the test concentration. Application of 300 μm anabaseine, the core agonist of 4OH-GTS-21, was reasonably effective at activating the α4Y190Fβ2 receptors (Fig. 5), whereas 300 μm anabasine, which lacks the double bond in anabaseine, was relatively ineffective at activating the mutant receptors. A previous study comparing the activity of anabaseine and anabasine on wild-type rat receptors (20Kem W.R. Mahnir V.M. Papke R.L. Lingle C.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 283: 979-992PubMed Google Scholar) indicated that both compounds were more efficacious for α7 than for α4β2 receptors. Both anabaseine and the reduced analog anabasine are full agonists of wild-type human α7 and weak partial agonists of wild-type human α4β2, with anabaseine producing maximal responses about 7% of the amplitude of the ACh maximum currents and anabasine producing maximal responses about 2% of the ACh maximum (data not shown). Interestingly, compared with wildtype α4β2, anabaseine responses of α4Y190Fβ2 receptors were increased 10-fold to 75 ± 12% of the ACh maximum, whereas maximum anabasine responses were less affected by the mutation, increasing only to 6 ± 1% of the ACh maximum in the full concentration-response analysis (data not shown). Diminished Activation of α7 and α4β2 Lysine-to-Alanine Mutants and Enhanced Activation of Lysine/Aspartate Double Mutants by 4OH-GTS-21 Compared with ACh—For both α7 and α4-containing receptors, mutation of the lysine at 145 to alanine greatly reduced the magnitude of current responses compared with wild-type receptors expressed under the same conditions. The K145A mutation in α7 reduced the potency of ACh to the same extent as did the Y188F mutation and also affected both the potency and efficacy of 4OH-GTS-21 (Fig. 6 and Table 1) compared with ACh.

https://openalex.org/W1977591991,"AlphaT-catenin is a recently identified member of the alpha-catenin family of cell-cell adhesion molecules. For decades it was thought that alpha-catenins mediate solid cell-cell adhesion by linking the cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion complex with the actin cytoskeleton. However, the roles of alpha-catenins in this classical adhesion model have been questioned recently. AlphaT-catenin has a restricted expression pattern, in contrast to the ubiquitously expressed alphaE-catenin. High levels of alphaT-catenin were detected in heart and testis. Northern and Western blot experiments indicated that besides the standard full-length alphaT-catenin transcript, smaller alternative transcripts are expressed in testis. We report the cloning of two alternative transcripts of the mouse alphaT-catenin gene (transcript-B and -X), both of which are expressed in a testis-restricted manner from two putative alternative promoters. Alternative transcript-X encodes a smaller protein, isoform-X, which lacks the amino-terminal beta-catenin binding domain of the standard mouse alphaT-catenin protein, and is therefore unable to restore cell-cell adhesion in an alpha-catenin-negative colon carcinoma cell line. Immunohistochemical analysis showed specific localization of the alphaT-catenin isoform-X in the differentiating germ cells. In contrast to the standard full-length alphaT-catenin protein, this shortened isoform-X can bind to l-afadin, an important component of the nectin/afadin/ponsin adhesion complex that reportedly is essential for spermatogenesis."

Added to the brewing controversy was a recent finding by Peterson and colleagues (33Horn N.A. Hurst G.B. Mayasundari A. Whittemore N.A. Serpersu E.H. Peterson C.B. J. Biol.

While sharply pointing out the lack of any reported functional data for nVN1–51-3 and the possibility of disulfide scrambling during the handling of nVN1–51-3, Kamikubo et al. (34Kamikubo Y. Kroon G. Curriden S.A. Dyson H.J. Loskutoff D.J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3297-3306Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) showed that a fully reduced, denatured rVN1–51-1 could be efficiently folded in vitro into a conformationally homogeneous, thermodynamically stable, and functionally active molecule. Furthermore, none of the folding intermediates accumulated showed any biological activity as judged by PAI-1 binding and antibody recognition (34Kamikubo Y. Kroon G. Curriden S.A. Dyson H.J. Loskutoff D.J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3297-3306Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The conflicting reports by several laboratories have raised a series of important questions that remain to be answered. However, first and foremost, what is the native disulfide topology in vitronectin? To resolve this increasingly controversial issue that has so far clouded the understanding of PAI-1-vitronectin recognition, we chemically synthesized, by using native chemical ligation and orthogonal protection of selected Cys residues, three topologically different forms of the SMB domain, sSMB-1, sSMB-2, and sSMB-3, with predefined disulfide connectivities corresponding to those reported for rVN1–51-1, rVN1–51-2, and nVN1–51-3, respectively. We also oxidatively folded a fully reduced SMB domain in aqueous solution using the protocol recently published by Kamikubo et al. (34Kamikubo Y. Kroon G. Curriden S.A. Dyson H.J. Loskutoff D.J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3297-3306Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), yielding sSMB-4. In addition, we prepared, by CNBr cleavage, the SMB-containing fragments nVN1–51 and uVN1–51 from natively purified as well as urea-activated vitronectin of human blood origin. Biochemical and functional characterization of sSMB-1–4, nVN1–51, and uVN1–51 reported here, while fully accounting for various published discrepancies, unequivocally establish the native and the only functional disulfide topology in vitronectin as Cys5–Cys21, Cys9–Cys39, Cys19–Cys32, and Cys25–Cys31, in support of the earlier findings by Read and colleagues (18Zhou A. Huntington J.A. Pannu N.S. Carrell R.W. Read R.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Peptide Synthesis, Native Chemical Ligation, and Oxidative Folding—Stepwise chemical synthesis of the 44-residue SMB domain on solid phase by t-butoxycarbonyl chemistry turned out to be extremely difficult if not impossible. We took advantage of the native chemical ligation technique pioneered by Kent and colleagues (35Dawson P.E. Muir T.W. Clark-Lewis I. Kent S.B. Science. 1994; 266: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (3064) Google Scholar, 36Dawson P.E. Kent S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 923-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar, 37Muir T.W.

Specifically, the C-terminal peptides were assembled on t-butoxycarbonyl-Thr(benzyl)-OCH2-phenylacetamidomethyl resin using the n,n-diisopropylethylamine in situ neutralization/2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate activation protocol developed by Kent and colleagues (38Schnolzer M. Alewood P. Jones A. Alewood D. Kent S.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1992; 40: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). The N-terminal peptides were synthesized on custom-made thioester resin (trityl)SCH2CH2COO-Leu-OCH2-phenylacetamidomethyl using an otherwise identical chemistry. After HF cleavage and deprotection, crude peptides were purified to homogeneity by preparative C18 HPLC, and their molecular masses were verified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Two-segment native chemical ligation was performed as described previously (39Wu Z. Alexandratos J. Ericksen B. Lubkowski J. Gallo R.C. Lu W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14688-14694Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), resulting in the four full-length SMB peptides with correct molecular masses. To obtain sSMB-1, sSMB-2, and sSMB-3, Acm-protected peptides 1–3 were first oxidized at 0.25 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline buffer, pH 7.4, by 20% (v/v) Me2SO. An overnight oxidation of each peptide at room temperature yielded three chromatographically distinct species. After disulfide mapping, three desired folding intermediates with Cys19–Cys21/Cys32–Cys39 (for sSMB-1), Cys5–Cys21/Cys25–Cys31 (for sSMB-2), and Cys5–Cys9/Cys21–Cys32 (for sSMB-3) were selected for Acm deprotection/disulfide formation. Specifically, the two-disulfide-bridged peptides at 0.5 mg/ml in an acidic solution containing 0.1 m citric acid, 0.2 m HCl, and 20% methanol were treated by 1 mm iodine for 15 min, each resulting in three fully oxidized and topologically different SMB domains, from which sSMB-1, sSMB-2, or sSMB-3 was eventually decoded. Spontaneous folding of the fully unprotected peptide 4 in aqueous solution under redox control of reduced and oxidized glutathione was carried out essentially as described for rVN1–51-1 (34Kamikubo Y. Kroon G. Curriden S.A. Dyson H.J. Loskutoff D.J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3297-3306Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), giving rise to a predominant folding species termed sSMB-4. All four synthetic SMB domains were purified to homogeneity on RP-HPLC and verified by ESI-MS. Quantification of SMB domains was carried out by UV absorbance measurements at 280 nm using molar extinction coefficients calculated according to a published algorithm (41Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3362) Google Scholar). Dissection of Two-disulfide-bridged Oxidation Intermediates—We strategically selected Cys residues to be protected by Acm in the SMB sequence so that discerning the pattern of the first two disulfides after Me2SO oxidation could be achieved by one-step proteolysis coupled with liquid chromatography-MS analysis. Bovine chymotrypsin and trypsin and Staphyloccocus aureus Glu-specific V8 protease were purchased from Worthington Biochemical Co. Enzymatic digestion was carried out for 1 h at 37°C in 50 mm Tris, 20 mm CaCl2, 0.005% Triton X-100, pH 8.3. The desired oxidation intermediate derived from peptide 1 contained Cys19–Cys21/Cys32–Cys39, and was readily identified by digestion with chymotrypsin that cleaved (Tyr27-Tyr28 or Tyr28-Gln29) between Cys21 and Cys32. The desired oxidation intermediates derived from peptides 2 and 3 both contained two linear and uncrossed disulfides, Cys5–Cys21/Cys25–Cys31, and Cys5–Cys9/Cys21–Cys32, respectively. For the peptide 2 derivative, Glu-specific V8 protease made a clean split (Glu23-Leu24) between Cys21 and Cys25, whereas trypsin cleaved (Lys17-Lys18 or Lys18-Cys19) between Cys9 and Cys21 of the peptide 3 derivative. Using this highly simplified approach, all undesired Me2SO-oxidized intermediates with crossed patterns of disulfide bonding were readily excluded. Dissection of Fully Oxidized sSMB-1, sSMB-2, and sSMB-3—To confirm the linear and uncrossed disulfide pattern in sSMB-1, the peptide was treated with chymotrypsin/Glu-specific V8 protease for 1 h at 37°C, generating, as judged by ESI-MS, the following four major fragments: [SC5KGRC9TE], [NVDKKC19QC21DE], [LC25SYY][QSC31C32TDY][C39KPQVT], and [LC25SYYQSC31C32TDYTAEC39KPQVT]. For sSMB-2, cleavage by chymotrypsin/trypsin yielded three major fragments: [DQESC5K][C19QC21DELC25SY][QSC31C32TDY], [C9TEGF][TAEC39KPQVT], and [DQESC5K][C19QC21DELC25-SYYQSC31C32TDY], thus confirming the presence of Cys19–Cys32 and Cys9–Cys39 in sSMB-2. A combination cleavage of sSMB-3 by chymotrypsin and Glu-specific V8 protease resulted in [SC5KGRC9TE], [NVDKKC19QC21DE][YQSC31C32TDY], [NVDKKC19QC21DE][QSC31C32TDY], and [LC25SY] [C39KPQVT], thus confirming the presence of Cys19–Cys31 and Cys25–Cys39 in the molecule. Isolation of VN1–51 from Intact Vitronectin—Natively purified and urea-activated vitronectins of human blood source were purchased from Molecular Innovations, Inc. The SMB-containing VN1–51 was released from vitronectin (0.5 mg/ml in 2.5% trifluoroacetic acid) by CNBr (20 mg/ml). After an overnight cleavage at room temperature, VN1–51 was purified by analytical C18 RP-HPLC. Two products resulted, the major component containing a C-terminal homoserine lactone and the minor species ending with homoserine. At basic pH, spontaneous hydrolysis quickly converts homoserine lactone to homoserine. Proteolytic Fingerprinting of sSMB-2, sSMB-4, nVN1–51, and uVN1–51—50 μg of sSMB-2 or sSMB-4 was dissolved at 1 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer containing 20 mm CaCl2 and 0.005% Triton X-100, pH 8.3, to which 1 μg of each enzyme was added in one of the following three binary combinations: chymotrypsin/trypsin, chymotrypsin/V8 protease, and trypsin/V8 protease. After an 18-h incubation at 37 °C, the cleavage reaction was terminated by addition of 50 μl of 10% acetic acid, followed by liquid chromatography-MS analyses. Due to limitations in quantities, much less nVN1–51 or uVN1–51 was used in otherwise identical experiments. Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy—The ability of synthetic SMB domains and VN1–51 to interact with PAI-1 (purchased from Oxford Biomedical Research) in solution was quantified on a Biacore 3000 surface plasmon resonance instrument according to a competition assay protocol developed by Loskutoff and colleagues (32Kamikubo Y. Okumura Y. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27109-27119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 34Kamikubo Y. Kroon G. Curriden S.A. Dyson H.J. Loskutoff D.J.

Briefly, 1100 resonance units of urea-activated vitronectin were immobilized (in 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.0) to a CM5 sensor chip using the 1-ethyl-3-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride/N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide coupling chemistry and procedures recommended by the manufacturer. Kinetic analysis of the binding to vitronectin of PAI-1, either alone or in the presence of sSMB, was carried out at 25 °C in HBS-EP buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20, pH 7.4). For competition, 25 nm PAI-1 was incubated at room temperature for 15 min with varying concentrations of synthetic SMB and injected at a flow rate of 20 μl/min for 5 min, followed by 5-min dissociation. The concentration of free PAI-1 in solution (not complexed with sSMB) was deduced, based on the initial rate (slope) of VN association, from a calibration curve established by resonance unit measurements of different concentrations of PAI-1 injected alone. Non-linear regression analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 4 to give rise to IC50 values, concentrations of SMB at which 50% of PAI-1 was sequestered in SMB-PAI-1 complexes, thus unavailable for VN binding. The SMB domain with eight Cys residues possesses 105 unique disulfide connectivities. We selectively protected four Cys residues in SMB with the orthogonal protecting agent Acm and oxidatively folded the resultant peptide containing four free cysteines, yielding three two-disulfide-bridged intermediates separable on reversed phase HPLC. After the disulfide linkages were discerned for all three species by mass mapping of peptide fragments generated by proteolysis, the folding intermediate with desired disulfide bridges was selected for Acm deprotection and simultaneous formation of two remaining disulfide bonds, also in three unique combinations. Mass mapping aided by enzymatic digestion was performed again to definitively establish disulfide connectivities in three fully oxidized products. The strategy for the synthesis of sSMB-1, sSMB-2, and sSMB-3 with predefined disulfide connectivities corresponding to the ones previously reported for rVN1–51-1, rVN1–51-2, and nVN1–51-3, respectively, is illustrated in Fig. 1. For comparison, a fully reduced and unprotected synthetic SMB was oxidatively folded in aqueous solution according to the published protocol (34Kamikubo Y. Kroon G. Curriden S.A. Dyson H.J. Loskutoff D.J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3297-3306Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), yielding conformationally homogeneous and thermodynamically stable sSMB-4. In addition, nVN1–51 and uVN1–51, which contain the SMB domain C-terminally connected to a seven-residue RGD motif (RGDVFTM), were prepared by CNBr cleavage, at the Met51-Pro52 peptide bond, of natively purified and urea-treated vitronectin from human blood, respectively. All synthetic SMB domains as well as nVN1–51 and uVN1–51 were purified by RP-HPLC to homogeneity, and their molecular masses ascertained by ESI-MS. Shown in Fig. 2 are sSMB-1, sSMB-2, sSMB-3, and sSMB-4 analyzed by C18 RP-HPLC and ESI-MS. The molecular masses of synthetic sSMB domains were found to be 5003.2 ± 0.3 Da, in agreement with the expected value of 5003.5 Da calculated on the basis of average isotopic compositions of fully oxidized SMB. High resolution analytical RP-HPLC is a powerful tool for chromatographically differentiating peptides with different disulfide connectivities (43Wu Z. Hoover D.M. Yang D. Boulegue C. Santamaria F. Oppenheim J.J. Lubkowski J. Lu W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8880-8885Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, the three topological analogs sSMB-1, sSMB-2 and sSMB-3, at least 1.5 min apart from each other, were fully separated on analytical C18 RP-HPLC. One immediate anomaly was that sSMB-4 had different retention from sSMB-1 (1.6 min apart), suggesting that sSMB-4 and sSMB-1 were topologically different. This finding was surprising because, based on the recent report by Kamikubo et al. (34Kamikubo Y. Kroon G. Curriden S.A. Dyson H.J. Loskutoff D.J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3297-3306Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), we had expected sSMB-4 to be identical to sSMB-1. Proteolytic digestion of sSMB-1 and sSMB-4 by Glu-specific V8 protease confirmed their difference in disulfide bonding pattern (data not shown). Notably, sSMB-4 and sSMB-2 showed identical retention on RP-HPLC (Fig. 2), and, in fact, co-eluted when injected as a mixture. We therefore hypothesized that folding of fully reduced SMB under redox control in aqueous solution had produced, in contrast to the published assumption (34Kamikubo Y. Kroon G. Curriden S.A. Dyson H.J. Loskutoff D.J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3297-3306Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), a non-linear disulfide-bonding pattern identical to the one reported by Zhou et al. (18Zhou A. Huntington J.A. Pannu N.S. Carrell R.W. Read R.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) for the crystal structure of rVN1–51-2 complexed with PAI-1. Two powerful lines of evidence support this hypothesis. First, sSMB-2 and sSMB-4 were structurally identical. We incubated sSMB-2 and sSMB-4 with three different binary combinations of chymotrypsin, trypsin, and Glu-specific V8 protease and generated identical proteolytic “fingerprints” for the two SMB domains (Fig. 3).
