https://openalex.org/W2188707104,"We propose a method (GREML-LDMS) to estimate heritability for human complex traits in unrelated individuals using whole-genome sequencing data. We demonstrate using simulations based on whole-genome sequencing data that ∼97% and ∼68% of variation at common and rare variants, respectively, can be captured by imputation. Using the GREML-LDMS method, we estimate from 44,126 unrelated individuals that all ∼17 million imputed variants explain 56% (standard error (s.e.) = 2.3%) of variance for height and 27% (s.e. = 2.5%) of variance for body mass index (BMI), and we find evidence that height- and BMI-associated variants have been under natural selection. Considering the imperfect tagging of imputation and potential overestimation of heritability from previous family-based studies, heritability is likely to be 60-70% for height and 30-40% for BMI. Therefore, the missing heritability is small for both traits. For further discovery of genes associated with complex traits, a study design with SNP arrays followed by imputation is more cost-effective than whole-genome sequencing at current prices."
https://openalex.org/W2243544746,"The Polycomb repressive complexes PRC1 and PRC2 maintain embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency by silencing lineage-specifying developmental regulator genes. Emerging evidence suggests that Polycomb complexes act through controlling spatial genome organization. We show that PRC1 functions as a master regulator of mouse ESC genome architecture by organizing genes in three-dimensional interaction networks. The strongest spatial network is composed of the four Hox gene clusters and early developmental transcription factor genes, the majority of which contact poised enhancers. Removal of Polycomb repression leads to disruption of promoter-promoter contacts in the Hox gene network. In contrast, promoter-enhancer contacts are maintained in the absence of Polycomb repression, with accompanying widespread acquisition of active chromatin signatures at network enhancers and pronounced transcriptional upregulation of network genes. Thus, PRC1 physically constrains developmental transcription factor genes and their enhancers in a silenced but poised spatial network. We propose that the selective release of genes from this spatial network underlies cell fate specification during early embryonic development."

https://openalex.org/W2157081213,"Aversive experiences can lead to complex behavioral adaptations including increased levels of anxiety and fear generalization. The neuronal mechanisms underlying such maladaptive behavioral changes, however, are poorly understood. Here, using a combination of behavioral, physiological and optogenetic approaches in mouse, we identify a specific subpopulation of central amygdala neurons expressing protein kinase C δ (PKCδ) as key elements of the neuronal circuitry controlling anxiety. Moreover, we show that aversive experiences induce anxiety and fear generalization by regulating the activity of PKCδ(+) neurons via extrasynaptic inhibition mediated by α5 subunit-containing GABAA receptors. Our findings reveal that the neuronal circuits that mediate fear and anxiety overlap at the level of defined subpopulations of central amygdala neurons and demonstrate that persistent changes in the excitability of a single cell type can orchestrate complex behavioral changes."
https://openalex.org/W1853941740,"Lung fibrosis is the hallmark of the interstitial lung diseases. Alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) injury is a key step that contributes to a profibrotic microenvironment. Fibroblasts and myofibroblasts subsequently accumulate and deposit excessive extracellular matrix. In addition to TGF-β, the IL-6 family of cytokines, which signal through STAT-3, may also contribute to lung fibrosis. In the current manuscript, the extent to which STAT-3 inhibition decreases lung fibrosis is investigated. Phosphorylated STAT-3 was elevated in lung biopsies from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and bleomycin (BLM)-induced fibrotic murine lungs. C-188-9, a small molecule STAT-3 inhibitor, decreased pulmonary fibrosis in the intraperitoneal BLM model as assessed by arterial oxygen saturation (control, 84.4 ± 1.3%; C-188-9, 94.4 ± 0.8%), histology (Ashcroft score: untreated, 5.4 ± 0.25; C-188-9, 3.3 ± 0.14), and attenuated fibrotic markers such as diminished α-smooth muscle actin, reduced collagen deposition. In addition, C-188-9 decreased the expression of epithelial injury markers, including hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). In vitro studies show that inhibition of STAT-3 decreased IL-6- and TGF-β-induced expression of multiple genes, including HIF-1α and PAI-1, in AECs. Furthermore, C-188-9 decreased fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation. Finally, TGF-β stimulation of lung fibroblasts resulted in SMAD2/SMAD3-dependent phosphorylation of STAT-3. These findings demonstrate that STAT-3 contributes to the development of lung fibrosis and suggest that STAT-3 may be a therapeutic target in pulmonary fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W1846678384,"The Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly), Ceratitis capitata, is a pest of worldwide substantial economic importance, as well as a Tephritidae model for sterile insect technique (SIT) applications. The latter is partially due to the development and utilization of genetic sexing strains (GSS) for this species, such as the Vienna 8 strain, which is currently used in mass rearing facilities worldwide. Improving the performance of such a strain both in mass rearing facilities and in the field could significantly enhance the efficacy of SIT and reduce operational costs. Recent studies have suggested that the manipulation of gut symbionts can have a significant positive effect on the overall fitness of insect strains. We used culture-based approaches to isolate and characterize gut-associated bacterial species of the Vienna 8 strain under mass rearing conditions. We also exploited one of the isolated bacterial species, Enterobacter sp., as dietary supplement (probiotic) to the larval diet, and we assessed its effects on fitness parameters under the standard operating procedures used in SIT operational programs. Probiotic application of Enterobacter sp. resulted in improvement of both pupal and adult productivity, as well as reduced rearing duration, particularly for males, without affecting pupal weight, sex ratio, male mating competitiveness, flight ability and longevity under starvation."
https://openalex.org/W1212501150,"The mammalian olfactory system uses a large family of odorant receptors (ORs) to detect and discriminate amongst a myriad of volatile odor molecules. Understanding odor coding requires comprehensive mapping between ORs and corresponding odors. We developed a means of high-throughput in vivo identification of OR repertoires responding to odorants using phosphorylated ribosome immunoprecipitation of mRNA from olfactory epithelium of odor-stimulated mice followed by RNA-Seq. This approach screened the endogenously expressed ORs against an odor in one set of experiments using awake and freely behaving mice. In combination with validations in a heterologous system, we identified sets of ORs for two odorants, acetophenone and 2,5-dihydro-2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline (TMT), encompassing 69 OR-odorant pairs. We also identified shared amino acid residues specific to the acetophenone or TMT receptors and developed models to predict receptor activation by acetophenone. Our results provide a method for understanding the combinatorial coding of odors in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2164231784,"Epidemiological studies have revealed a link between dental infection and preterm birth or low birth weight (PTB/LBW), however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Progress in understanding the associated mechanisms has been limited in part by lack of an animal model for chronic infection-induced PTB/LBW, mimicking pregnancy under conditions of periodontitis. We aimed to establish a mouse model of chronic periodontitis in order to investigate the link between periodontitis and PTB/LBW.To establish chronic inflammation beginning with dental infection, we surgically opened mouse (female, 8 weeks old) 1st molar pulp chambers and directly infected with w83 strain Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.g.), a keystone periodontal pathogen. Mating was initiated at 6 wks post-infection, by which time dental granuloma tissue had developed and live P.g. was cultured from extracted tooth root, which serves as a persistent source of P.g. The gestational day (gd) and birth weight were recorded during for P.g.-infected and control mice, and serum and placental tissues were collected at gd 15 to evaluate the systemic and local conditions during pregnancy.Dental infection with P.g. significantly increased circulating TNF-α (2.5-fold), IL-17 (2-fold), IL-6 (2-fold) and IL-1β (2-fold). The P.g.-infected group delivered at gd 18.25 vs. gd 20.45 in the non-infected control (NC) group (p < 0.01), and pups exhibited LBW compared to controls (p < 0.01). P.g. was localized to placental tissues by immunohistochemistry and PCR, and defects in placental tissues of P.g. infected mice included premature rupture of membrane, placental detachment, degenerative changes in trophoblasts and endothelial cells, including necrotic areas. P.g. infection caused significantly increased numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) and macrophages in placental tissues, associated with increased local expression of pro-inflammatory mediators including TNF-α and COX-2. Further placental tissue damage was indicated in P.g. infected mice by decreased CD-31 in endothelial cells, increased expression of 8OHdG, an indicator of oxidative DNA damage, and cleaved caspase-3, a marker of apoptosis. In vitro, P.g. lipopolysaccharide significantly increased expression of COX-2, IL-8 and TNF-α, in HTR-8 trophoblasts in an NF-κB-dependent fashion.Our novel mouse model supports previous epidemiological studies signifying dental infection as predisposing factor for PTB/LBW. We demonstrate PTB and LBW in infected mice, translocation of P.g to placental tissues, increased circulating and local pro-inflammatory markers, and the capability of P.g. LPS to directly induce cytokine production in trophoblasts, in vitro. These findings further underscore the importance of local and systemic infections and inflammation during pregnancy and suggest that prevention and/or elimination of dental infections such as marginal or periapical periodontitis before pregnancy may have a beneficial effect on PTB/LBW."
https://openalex.org/W1774913209,"Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a pleiotropic bioactive sphingolipid metabolite that regulates numerous processes important for immune responses. S1P is made within cells and must be transported out of cells to exert its effects through activation of 5 specific cell surface GPCRs in an autocrine or paracrine fashion. Spinster 2 (Spns2) transports S1P out of cells, and its deletion in mice reduces circulating levels of S1P, alters immune cell trafficking, and induces lymphopenia. Here we examined the effects of Spns2 deletion on adaptive immune responses and in autoimmune disease models. Airway inflammation and hypersensitivity as well as delayed-type contact hyper-sensitivity were attenuated in Spns2–/– mice. Similarly, Spns2 deletion reduced dextran sodium sulfate- and oxazolone-induced colitis. Intriguingly, Spns2–/– mice were protected from the development of experimental autoimmune encephalopathy, a model of the autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis. Deletion of Spns2 also strongly alleviated disease development in collagen-induced arthritis. These results point to a broad role for Spns2-mediated S1P transport in the initiation and development of adaptive immune related disorders.—Donoviel, M. S., Hait, N.

The narrow genetic diversity and limited availability of genomic resources are the major constraints in implementing breeding strategies and biotechnological interventions for genetic enhancement of chickpea. We developed an integrated Chickpea Transcriptome Database (CTDB), which provides the comprehensive web interface for visualization and easy retrieval of transcriptome data in chickpea. The database features many tools for similarity search, functional annotation (putative function, PFAM domain and gene ontology) search and comparative gene expression analysis. The current release of CTDB (v2.0) hosts transcriptome datasets with high quality functional annotation from cultivated (desi and kabuli types) and wild chickpea. A catalog of transcription factor families and their expression profiles in chickpea are available in the database. The gene expression data have been integrated to study the expression profiles of chickpea transcripts in major tissues/organs and various stages of flower development. The utilities, such as similarity search, ortholog identification and comparative gene expression have also been implemented in the database to facilitate comparative genomic studies among different legumes and Arabidopsis. Furthermore, the CTDB represents a resource for the discovery of functional molecular markers (microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms) between different chickpea types. We anticipate that integrated information content of this database will accelerate the functional and applied genomic research for improvement of chickpea.

https://openalex.org/W2169508676,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a significant risk factor for ischemic strokes, and making a robust risk stratification scheme would be important. Few studies have examined whether nonlinear dynamics of the heart rate could predict ischemic strokes in AF. We examined whether a novel complexity measurement of the heart rate variability called multiscale entropy (MSE) was a useful risk stratification measure of ischemic strokes in patients with permanent AF.We examined 173 consecutive patients (age 69 ± 11 years) with permanent AF who underwent 24-hour Holter electrocardiography from April 2005 to December 2006. We assessed several frequency ranges of the MSE and CHA2DS2-VASc score (1 point for congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, vascular disease, an age 65 to 74 years, and a female sex and 2 points for an age ≥ 75 years and a stroke or transient ischemic attack). We found 22 (13%) incident ischemic strokes during a mean follow up of 3.8-years. The average value of the MSE in the very-low frequency subrange (90-300 s, MeanEnVLF2) was significantly higher in patients who developed ischemic strokes than in those who did not (0.68 ± 0.15 vs. 0.60±0.14, P<0.01). There was no significant difference in the C-statistic between the CHA2DS2-VASc score and MeanEnVLF2 (0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.43-0.69 vs. 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.53-0.79). After an adjustment for the age, CHA2DS2-VASc score, and antithrombotic agent, a Cox hazard regression model revealed that the MeanEnVLF2 was an independent predictor of an ischemic stroke (hazard ratio per 1-SD increment, 1.80; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-2.07, P<0.01).The MeanEnVLF2 in 24-hour Holter electrocardiography is a useful risk stratification measure of ischemic strokes during the long-term follow-up in patients with permanent AF."

These are the class Ic ribonucleotide reductase R2 proteins and a group of oxidases that are found predominantly in pathogens and extremophiles, called R2-like ligand-binding oxidases (R2lox). We have recently shown that the Mn/Fe cofactor of R2lox self-assembles from MnII and FeII in vitro and catalyzes formation of a tyrosine-valine ether cross-link in the protein scaffold (Griese, J.

Here, we present a detailed structural analysis of R2lox in the nonactivated, reduced, and oxidized resting Mn/Fe- and Fe/Fe-bound states, as well as the nonactivated Mn/Mn-bound state. X-ray crystallography and x-ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrate that the active site ligand configuration of R2lox is essentially the same regardless of cofactor composition. Both the Mn/Fe and the diiron cofactor activate oxygen and catalyze formation of the ether cross-link, whereas the dimanganese cluster does not. The structures delineate likely routes for gated oxygen and substrate access to the active site that are controlled by the redox state of the cofactor. These results suggest that oxygen activation proceeds via similar mechanisms at the Mn/Fe and Fe/Fe center and that R2lox proteins might utilize either cofactor in vivo based on metal availability.

https://openalex.org/W2112390805,"Pathological calcification generally consists of the formation of solid deposits of hydroxyapatite (calcium phosphate) in soft tissues. Supersaturation is the thermodynamic driving force for crystallization, so it is believed that higher blood levels of calcium and phosphate increase the risk of cardiovascular calcification. However several factors can promote or inhibit the natural process of pathological calcification. This cross-sectional study evaluated the relationship between physiological levels of urinary phytate and heart valve calcification in a population of elderly out subjects. A population of 188 elderly subjects (mean age: 68 years) was studied. Valve calcification was measured by echocardiography. Phytate determination was performed from a urine sample and data on blood chemistry, end-systolic volume, concomitant diseases, cardiovascular risk factors, medication usage and food were obtained. The study population was classified in three tertiles according to level of urinary phytate: low (<0.610 μM), intermediate (0.61–1.21 μM), and high (>1.21 μM). Subjects with higher levels of urinary phytate had less mitral annulus calcification and were less likely to have diabetes and hypercholesterolemia. In the multivariate analysis, age, serum phosphorous, leukocytes total count and urinary phytate excretion appeared as independent factors predictive of presence of mitral annulus calcification. There was an inverse correlation between urinary phytate content and mitral annulus calcification in our population of elderly out subjects. These results suggest that consumption of phytate-rich foods may help to prevent cardiovascular calcification evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1894756591,"Background Recent publications have reported contradictory data regarding mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation and its association with body mass index. The aim of the present study was to compare the frequencies of mtDNA haplogroups as well as control region (CR) polymorphisms of obese juveniles (n = 248) and obese adults (n = 1003) versus normal weight controls (njuvenile = 266, nadults = 595) in a well-defined, ethnically homogenous, age-matched comparative cohort of Austrian Caucasians. Methodology and Principal Findings Using SNP analysis and DNA sequencing, we identified the nine major European mitochondrial haplogroups and CR polymorphisms. Of these, only the T haplogroup frequency was increased in the juvenile obese cohort versus the control subjects [11.7% in obese vs. 6.4% in controls], although statistical significance was lost after adjustment for sex and age. Similar data were observed in a local adult cohort, in which haplogroup T was found at a significantly higher frequency in the overweight and obese subjects than in the normal weight group [9.7% vs. 6.2%, p = 0.012, adjusted for sex and age]. When all obese subjects were considered together, the difference in the frequency of haplogroup T was even more clearly seen [10.1% vs. 6.3%, p = 0.002, OR (95% CI) 1.71 (1.2–2.4), adjusted for sex and age]. The frequencies of the T haplogroup-linked CR polymorphisms C16294T and the C16296T were found to be elevated in both the juvenile and the adult obese cohort compared to the controls. Nevertheless, no mtDNA haplogroup or CR polymorphism was robustly associated with any of several investigated metabolic and cardiovascular parameters (e.g., blood pressure, blood glucose concentration, triglycerides, cholesterol) in all obese subjects. Conclusions and Significance By investigation of this large ethnically and geographically homogenous cohort of Middle European Caucasians, only mtDNA haplogroup T was identified as an obesity risk factor."
https://openalex.org/W1702062216,"Purpose To concurrently quantify the radiation-induced changes and temporal evolutions of parotid volume and parotid apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients treated by intensity-modulated radiotherapy by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Materials and Methods A total of 11 NPC patients (9 men and 2 women; 48.7 ± 11.7 years, 22 parotid glands) were enrolled. Radiation dose, parotid sparing volume, severity of xerostomia, and radiation-to-MR interval (RMI) was recorded. MRI studies were acquired four times, including one before and three after radiotherapy. The parotid volume and the parotid ADC were measured. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS and MedCalc. Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple comparisons. A P value less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results The parotid volume was 26.2 ± 8.0 cm3 before radiotherapy. The parotid ADC was 0.8 ± 0.15 × 10−3 mm2/sec before radiotherapy. The parotid glands received a radiation dose of 28.7 ± 4.1 Gy and a PSV of 44.1 ± 12.6%. The parotid volume was significantly smaller at MR stage 1 and stage 2 as compared to pre-RT stage (P < .005). The volume reduction ratio was 31.2 ± 13.0%, 26.1 ± 13.5%, and 17.1 ± 16.6% at stage 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The parotid ADC was significantly higher at all post-RT stages as compared to pre-RT stage reciprocally (P < .005 at stage 1 and 2, P < .05 at stage 3). The ADC increase ratio was 35.7 ± 17.4%, 27.0 ± 12.8%, and 20.2 ± 16.6% at stage 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The parotid ADC was negatively correlated to the parotid volume (R = -0.509; P < .001). The parotid ADC was positively associated with the radiation dose significantly (R2 = 0.212; P = .0001) and was negatively associated with RMI significantly (R2 = 0.203; P = .00096) significantly. Multiple regression analysis further showed that the post-RT parotid ADC was related to the radiation dose and RMI significantly (R2 = 0.3580; P < .0001). At MR stage 3, the parotid volume was negatively associated with the dry mouth grade significantly (R2 = 0.473; P < .0001), while the parotid ADC was positively associated with the dry mouth grade significantly (R2 = 0.288; P = .015). Conclusion Our pilot study successfully demonstrates the concurrent changes and temporal evolution of parotid volume and parotid ADC quantitatively in NPC patients treated by IMRT. Our results suggest that the reduction of parotid volume and increase of parotid ADC are dominated by the effect of acinar loss rather than edema at early to intermediate phases and the following recovery of parotid volume and ADC toward the baseline values might reflect the acinar regeneration of parotid glands."

The Molecule Pages, which aggregate information relevant to NR signaling pathways from myriad external databases, have been enhanced to include resources for basic scientists, such as post-translational modification sites and targeting miRNAs, and for clinicians, such as clinical trials. A portal to NURSA’s Open Access, PubMed-indexed journal Nuclear Receptor Signaling has been added to facilitate manuscript submissions. Datasets and information on reagents generated by NDSPs are available, as is information concerning periodic new NDSP funding solicitations. Finally, the new website integrates the Transcriptomine analysis tool, which allows for mining of millions of richly annotated public transcriptomic data points in the field, providing an environment for dataset re-use and citation, bench data validation and hypothesis generation. We anticipate that this new release of the NURSA database will have tangible, long term benefits for both basic and clinical research in this field."

https://openalex.org/W1954014618,"The STarT Back stratified primary care approach has demonstrated clinical and cost effectiveness in the UK, and is commonly used by General Practitioners (GPs). However, it remains unknown how this approach could be implemented into the German healthcare system. The aim of this study was therefore to explore the views and perceptions of German GPs in respect to using a stratified primary care for low back pain (LBP).A 90-minute think-tank workshop was conducted with 14 male and five female GPs, during which the STarT-Back-Screening-Tool (SBST) and related research evidence was presented. This was followed by two focus groups, based on a semi-structured interview guideline to identify potential implementation barriers and opportunities. Discussions were audiotaped, transcribed and coded using a content analysis approach.For the three deductively developed main themes, 15 subthemes emerged: (1) application of the SBST, with the following subthemes: which health profession should administer it, patients known to the GP practice, the reason for the GP consultation, scoring the tool, the tool format, and the anticipated impact on GP practice; (2) psychologically informed physiotherapy, with subthemes including: provision by a physiotherapist, anticipated impact, the skills of physiotherapists, management of patients with severe psychosocial problems, referral and remuneration; (3) the management of low-risk patients, with subthemes including: concern about the appropriate advising health professional, information and media, length of consultation, and local exercise venues.The attitudes of GPs towards stratified primary care for LBP indicated positive support for pilot-testing in Germany. However, there were mixed reactions to the ability of German physiotherapists to manage high-risk patients and handle their complex clinical needs.

The human SET1 family includes MLL1–4 and SETd1A/B, which all interact with a conserved subcomplex containing WDR5, RbBP5, Ash2L, and DPY-30 (WRAD) to form the minimal core complex required for full methyltransferase activity. However, recent evidence suggests that the WDR5 subunit may not be utilized in an identical manner within all SET1 family core complexes. Although the roles of WDR5 within the MLL1 core complex have been extensively studied, not much is known about the roles of WDR5 in other SET1 family core complexes. In this investigation, we set out to characterize the roles of the WDR5 subunit in the MLL3 core complex. We found that unlike MLL1, the MLL3 SET domain assembles with the RbBP5/Ash2L heterodimer independently of the Win motif-WDR5 interaction. Furthermore, we observed that WDR5 inhibits the monomethylation activity of the MLL3 core complex, which is dependent on the Win motif. We also found evidence suggesting that the WRAD subcomplex catalyzes weak H3K4 monomethylation within the context of the MLL3 core complex. Furthermore, solution structures of the MLL3 core complex assembled with and without WDR5 by small angle x-ray scattering show similar overall topologies.

Methods 105 consecutive patients with alleged clinically active CD were assessed by MRE and CEUS. CEUS of the terminal ileum was performed using an intravenous microbubble contrast enhancer. Accuracy values of CEUS and MRE for the presence of active terminal ileitis were evaluated using the Receiver Operating Characteristic method, using endoscopic findings as a reference standard. Sensitivity and specificity values of MRE and CEUS were compared by the McNemar test. Results CEUS was feasible in 98% of patients, MRE in all. Optimal diagnostic accuracy in CEUS was obtained at a peak intensity value of 10%, showing 100% sensitivity, 92% specificity and an accuracy of 99% in demonstrating ileal mucosal inflammation. For MRE, overall sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were, 87%, 100%, and 88%, respectively. CEUS and MRE were highly correlated in assessing length and wall thickness of the terminal ileum. CEUS identified 11 of 16 MRE-detected strictures, but no fistulae. Conclusion The accuracy of CEUS is comparable to that of MRE in the assessment of active, uncomplicated terminal ileal CD and therefore a valuable bedside alternative to MRE in the follow-up of these patients."

Bacillus anthracis is a Gram-positive endospore forming bacterium that causes lethal anthrax disease in humans and animals. Bacterial spores are an infectious form of the pathogen, and predominantly enter the human body through inhalation, ingestion, or cuts in the skin (1Mock M. Fouet A. Anthrax.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 647-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Gastrointestinal (ingestion) and pulmonary (inhalation) forms of anthrax are often fatal if the illness progresses to the fulminant phase (2Holty J.E. Bravata D.M. Liu H. Olshen R.A. McDonald K.M.

In pulmonary anthrax, inhaled spores are first phagocytized by alveolar macrophages in the lungs, and then transported to the lymph nodes. The spores are resistant to killing and germinate into vegetative cells that enter the bloodstream to cause host damage via secreted toxins. The ability of the microbe to thrive and replicate within macrophages is dependent upon the display of bacterial surface proteins that are attached to the cell wall by the B. anthracis Sortase A (BaSrtA) 2The abbreviations used are: SrtAsortase ASrtBsortase BBaSrtAB. anthracis sortase ASaSrtAS. aureus sortase ASaSrtBS. aureus sortase BDAPmeso-diaminopimelic acidHSQCheteronuclear single quantum coherenceRCIrandom coil indexr.m.s.root mean squareBoctert-butyloxycarbonylDNP2,4-dinitrophenol. enzyme (3Zink S.D.

Chem. 2007; 7: 991-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). At present, over 800 genes encoding sortase proteins, and a much larger number of sortase protein substrates have been identified in ∼260 species of bacteria (12Finn R.D. Mistry J. Tate J. Coggill P. Heger A. Pollington J.E. Gavin O.L. Gunasekaran P. Ceric G. Forslund K. Holm L. Sonnhammer E.L. Eddy S.R. Bateman A.

The sortase A enzyme from Saccharomyces aureus (SaSrtA) has been studied in detail. It attaches proteins to the cell envelop by catalyzing a transpeptidation reaction that joins a C-terminal cell wall sorting signal within its protein substrate to the cross-bridge peptide. In this process, a full-length precursor protein containing an amino-terminal leader peptide is exported from the cytoplasm through the secretory (Sec) pathway. The cell wall sorting signal in sortase substrates consists of a LPXTG-motif (where X denotes any amino acid), followed by a segment of hydrophobic amino acids, and a tail composed primarily of positively charged residues. The C-terminal charged tail presumably retards export, positioning the protein for processing by the extracellular membrane-associated SaSrtA (13Schneewind O. Model P. Fischetti V.A. Sorting of protein A to the staphylococcal cell wall.Cell. 1992; 70: 267-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Catalysis occurs through a ping-pong mechanism that is initiated when the active site cysteine residue in SaSrtA nucleophilically attacks the backbone carbonyl carbon of the threonine residue within the LPXTG motif, breaking the threonine-glycine peptide bond to create a sortase-protein complex in which the components are linked via a thioacyl bond (14Huang X. Aulabaugh A. Ding W. Kapoor B. Alksne L. Tabei K. Ellestad G. Kinetic mechanism of Staphylococcus aureus sortase SrtA.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11307-11315Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 15Frankel B.A. Kruger R.G. Robinson D.E. Kelleher N.L.

Staphylococcus aureus sortase transpeptidase SrtA: insight into the kinetic mechanism and evidence for a reverse protonation catalytic mechanism.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11188-11200Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The protein is then transferred by SaSrtA to the cell wall precursor lipid II, when the amino group in this molecule nucleophilically attacks the thioacyl linkage to create a peptide bond-linked protein-lipid II product. Transglycosylation and transpeptidation reactions that synthesize the cell wall then incorporate this product into the peptidoglycan. Other members of the sortase superfamily are believed to operate through a similar enzymatic mechanism as SaSrtA, but in some microbes (primarily enterococal and corynebacterial species), sortases perform equivalent transpeptidation reactions that assemble pili on the bacterial cell surface (16Ton-That H. Schneewind O. Assembly of pili in Gram-positive bacteria.Trends Microbiol. 2004; 12: 228-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Based on their primary sequences members of the sortase superfamily can be partitioned into at least six subfamilies, called class A to F enzymes (6Spirig T. Weiner E.M. Clubb R.T.

Bierne H. Sorting sortases: a nomenclature proposal for the various sortases of Gram-positive bacteria.Res. Microbiol. 2005; 156: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The genome of B. anthracis encodes class A, B, and D sortases, known as BaSrtA, BaSrtB, and BaSrtC, respectively (19Aucher W. Davison S. Fouet A. Characterization of the sortase repertoire in Bacillus anthracis.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6e27411Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). BaSrtA, the focus of this study, anchors seven proteins to the cell wall by joining the threonine of the LPXTG sorting signal at the C terminus of the protein to the amine group of meso-diaminopimelic acid (DAP) within lipid II (20Gaspar A.H. Marraffini L.A. Glass E.M. Debord K.L. Ton-That H. Schneewind O. Bacillus anthracis sortase A (SrtA) anchors LPXTG motif-containing surface proteins to the cell wall envelope.J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4646-4655Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). BaSrtB anchors only one protein to the cell wall, IsdC, which is important for heme binding (21Maresso A.W. Chapa T.J. Schneewind O. Surface protein IsdC and Sortase B are required for heme-iron scavenging of Bacillus anthracis.J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 8145-8152Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), whereas BaSrtC attaches two proteins involved in sporulation (BasH and BasI) (22Marraffini L.A. Schneewind O.

Atomic structures of class A to D enzymes have now been determined revealing a common eight-stranded β-barrel-fold that contains conserved arginine, cysteine, and histidine active site residues (4Cascioferro S.

However, it is not well understood how sortases recognize their sorting signal and nucleophile substrates, because nearly all sortase structures reported to date have been determined in the apo-state. Previously we discovered that the class A BaSrtA sortase contains a unique N-terminal appendage that wraps around the body of the protein to contact the active site of the enzyme (23Weiner E.M. Robson S. Marohn M. Clubb R.T. The Sortase A enzyme that attaches proteins to the cell wall of Bacillus anthracis contains an unusual active site architecture.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 23433-23443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the function of this appendage in catalysis remained unknown. In this article, we report the NMR structure of BaSrtA bound to a LPXTG sorting signal analog that reveals for the first time the mechanism of substrate recognition by this enzyme. In the structure of the complex, the appendage partially encapsulates the bound sorting signal and we show that these interactions play a role in the in vivo and in vitro function of the enzyme. A model of the thioacyl intermediate constructed from the coordinates of the complex suggests that the N-terminal appendage may obstruct nucleophile access to the active site. We propose that on the cell surface, the N-terminal appendage may increase the efficiency of protein display by reducing the unproductive hydrolytic cleavage of enzyme-protein covalent intermediates that form during the cell wall anchoring reaction. Wild-type SrtA protein from B. anthracis containing amino acid residues Asp57-Lys210 (BaSrtA) was produced as described previously (23Weiner E.M. Robson S. Marohn M. Clubb R.T. The Sortase A enzyme that attaches proteins to the cell wall of Bacillus anthracis contains an unusual active site architecture.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 23433-23443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Uniformly 15N- and 13C-labeled BaSrtA protein was covalently attached to an analog of the LPXTG sorting signal, Boc-LPAT* (where T* is (2R,3S)-3-amino-4-mercapto-2-butanol, and Boc is a tert-butyloxycarbonyl protecting group), by incubating 200 μm BaSrtA with 2 mm Boc-LPAT* in modification buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl) for 48 h at room temperature. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was used to confirm the production of stable covalent complex. Two samples of the complex dissolved in NMR buffer (50 mm NaPO4, pH 6.0, 0.01% NaN3) were studied by NMR: 1) 2.6 mm [15N,13C]BaSrtA bound to the unlabeled peptide dissolved in NMR buffer containing 8% D2O; and 2) 2.6 mm [15N,13C]BaSrtA bound to the unlabeled peptide dissolved in deuterated NMR buffer. NMR spectra were acquired at 298 K on Bruker Avance 500-, 600-, and 800-MHz spectrometers equipped with triple resonance cryogenic probes. NMR data were processed using NMRPipe (24Delaglio F.

Distance restraints to define the structure of the protein were obtained from three-dimensional 15N- and 13C-edited NOESY spectra (mixing time at 120 ms), and intermolecular distance restraints between BaSrtA and Boc-LPAT* were identified in three-dimensional (F1) 13C,15N-filtered (F2) 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC and (F1) 13C,15N-filtered (F2) 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC (30Zwahlen C.

TALOS+: a hybrid method for predicting protein backbone torsion angles from NMR chemical shifts.J. Biomol. NMR. 2009; 44: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar). Additional ϕ angle restraints were obtained by measuring 3JHNα values from HNHA spectrum (32Vuister G.W. Bax A.

NOE assignments were obtained automatically using the ATNOS and CANDID algorithms in UNIO'10 (36Herrmann T. Güntert P. Wüthrich K.

The Xplor-NIH NMR molecular structure determination package.J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 160: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1865) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC spectrum of the complex dissolved in H2O, and three-dimensional 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC spectrum of the complex dissolved in D2O were used as input for UNIO'10. These data were supplemented with dihedral angle restraints and carbon chemical shifts for secondary structure predictions. Seven cycles of ATNOS/CANDID and XPLOR-NIH calculations yielded a converged ensemble of the protein in the complex. All of the NOE assignments made by CANDID were subsequently verified by manually inspecting the NOESY data. In the structure refinement process, additional intra- and intermolecular distance restraints were identified manually, 3JHNα couplings and hydrogen bond restraints were included in structure calculations. Intermolecular NOEs were assigned in an iterative manner. Initially, the positioning of the peptide in the active site was determined using only unambiguous NOEs (intermolecular NOEs that could be readily identified in the filtered and edited NMR spectra of the complex because they were not overlapped with intramolecular protein NOEs). The initial model of the complex was then was used to guide the assignment of more ambiguous intermolecular NOEs. In all cases, only NOEs present in both the filtered and edited NOESY spectra were employed as distance restraints. Hydrogen bonds were identified by inspecting the NOESY data for characteristic patterns along with deuterium exchange experiments, and restraints for hydrogen bonds were implemented with the HBDB algorithm (39Grishaev A.

At the final refinement stage, 1DNH and 1DNCO residual dipolar couplings were included, which were measured using protein samples partially aligned in PEG C12E5/hexanol (40Ruckert M. Otting G.

The 15N relaxation data were collected using a diluted (1.2 mm) 15N- and 13C- labeled sample of the complex dissolved in H2O on a Bruker Avance 600-MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance cryogenic probe. Data were analyzed using SPARKY (46Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY 3. University of California, San Francisco, CA2006Google Scholar) and included: 15N longitudinal relaxation rates (R1), transverse relaxation rates (R2), and {1H}-15N heteronuclear NOEs. Complete quantifiable relaxation information (R1, R2, and NOE) could be measured for 119 of 151 backbone amides. The average R1, R2, and NOE values for the complex are 1.47 ± 0.16, 13.14 ± 3.97, and 0.71 ± 0.25 s−1, respectively. The relaxation data were analyzed using the suite of analysis programs kindly provided by Prof. Arthur G.

Briefly, Pdbinertia was used to calculate the principal moments of inertia and yielded relative moments of 1.00:0.91:0.68. R2R1_tm was used to calculate an approximate correlation time of 9.3 ± 0.4 ns for rigid residues using R2/R1 ratios. To ensure only rigid residues were used in the correlation time analysis, only R2/R1 ratios that met the following criteria were used in the analysis: 1) the residue had a {1H}-15N NOE value >0.65, and 2) they were within 1 S.D. of the average.

The focus is on the population aged 50-90. We use a repeated population-based cross-sectional design. As outcome measures, we use SF-12 measures of physical and mental health and the Symbol-Digit Test (SDT) that captures cognitive processing speed. In line with previous research we find a highly significant Flynn effect on cognition; i.e., SDT scores are higher among those who were tested more recently (at the same age). This result holds for men and women, all age groups, and across all levels of education. While we observe a secular improvement in terms of cognitive functioning, at the same time, average physical and mental health has declined. The decline in average physical health is shown to be stronger for men than for women and found to be strongest for low-educated, young-old men aged 50-64: the decline over the 6-year interval in average physical health is estimated to amount to about 0.37 SD, whereas average fluid cognition improved by about 0.29 SD. This pattern of results at the population-level (trends in average population health) stands in interesting contrast to the positive association of physical health and cognitive functioning at the individual-level. The findings underscore the multi-dimensionality of health and the aging process."
https://openalex.org/W2228085709,"Recent studies have identified family with sequence similarity member 20C (FAM20C) as a kinase that phosphorylates the Ser in Ser-X-Glu/phospho-Ser (pSer) motifs in the small-integrin-binding ligand N-linked glycoproteins (SIBLINGs). There is no in vivo evidence that validates this finding, and it is unclear whether FAM20C is the only kinase for SIBLINGs. We extracted bone noncollagenous proteins (NCPs) from Fam20C-knockout (KO) mice and analyzed the phosphorylation levels. The total NCPs were separated into osteopontin-, bone sialoprotein-, and dentin matrix protein-1-enriched fractions by anion-exchange chromatography and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, native PAGE, and Western immunoblot analysis. The NCP phosphorylation level in the KO mice was lower than that in the wild-type (WT). On the native gel, the SIBLINGs from KO mice showed a lower migration rate (Mr) than those from the WT. Calf intestine phosphatase treatment shifted SIBLINGs from the WT mice to the level adjacent to the KO, but failed to shift the latter, suggesting a phosphorylation loss of SIBLINGs in the KO mice. Mass spectrometry identified less pSers in the SIBLINGs from the KO mice [including the region of the acidic Ser- and aspartate-rich motif (ASARM) peptides]. In an intriguing finding, several pSers in the Ser-X-Glu motifs in the KO mice maintained their phosphorylation, whereas several others in non-Ser-X-Glu motifs did not. Phospho-Tyrs and phospho-Thrs in the SIBLINGs did not appear to be associated with FAM20C. Our results indicate that FAM20C is the primary, but not the only, kinase for the SIBLINGs.-Yang, X., Yan, W., Tian, Y., Ma, P., Opperman, L. A., Wang, X.

https://openalex.org/W1240494696,"Recently, a novel feedforward activation of the endothelial epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) [endothelial sodium channel (EnNaC)] by sodium was reported that counteracts ENaC function in kidney. In the absence of aldosterone, a rise in extracellular sodium (>145 mM) increases EnNaC surface abundance, thereby stiffening the cortex of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) in vitro. The latter reduces the release of NO—the hallmark of endothelial dysfunction. Here, we test whether high extracellular sodium per se increases EnNaC expression and cortical stiffness in an aldosterone synthase (Cyp11b2)-deficient (AS-/-) mouse model. Therefore, we employed in situ ECs of ex vivo aorta preparations from wild-type (WT) and AS-/-. EnNaC surface expression (-16%) and cortical stiffness (-22%) were reduced in AS-/-, compared with WT, whereas NO secretion was exclusively detectable in AS-/-. EnNaC inhibition with benzamil decreased stiffness in both, while mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism diminished stiffness only in the WT. In the absence of aldosterone, high sodium (150 mM) increased EnNaC surface expression ex vivo (plus 19%) and cortical stiffness ex vivo (plus 41%) and in vivo (plus 44%). Application of aldosterone adjusted the stiffness of AS-/-to the WT level. We conclude that high sodium per se determines EnNaC expression and consequently endothelial cortical nanomechanics, thus likely contributing to endothelial dysfunction.—Jeggle, P., Hofschröer, V., Maase, M., Bertog, M., Kusche-Vihrog, K.

To elucidate the cellular consequences of inositol depletion, we screened the yeast deletion collection for VPA-sensitive mutants and identified mutants in vacuolar sorting and the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase). Inositol depletion caused by starvation of ino1Δ cells perturbed the vacuolar structure and decreased V-ATPase activity and proton pumping in isolated vacuolar vesicles.

https://openalex.org/W1835381339,"Inflammation is a key instigator of the immune responses that drive atherosclerosis and allograft rejection. IL-1α, a powerful cytokine that activates both innate and adaptive immunity, induces vessel inflammation after release from necrotic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Similarly, IL-1α released from endothelial cells (ECs) damaged during transplant drives allograft rejection. However, IL-1α requires cleavage for full cytokine activity, and what controls cleavage in necrotic ECs is currently unknown. We find that ECs have very low levels of IL-1α activity upon necrosis. However, TNFα or IL-1 induces significant levels of active IL-1α in EC necrotic lysates without alteration in protein levels. Increased activity requires cleavage of IL-1α by calpain to the more active mature form. Immunofluorescence and proximity ligation assays show that IL-1α associates with interleukin-1 receptor-2, and this association is decreased by TNFα or IL-1 and requires caspase activity. Thus, TNFα or IL-1 treatment of ECs leads to caspase proteolytic activity that cleaves interleukin-1 receptor-2, allowing IL-1α dissociation and subsequent processing by calpain. Importantly, ECs could be primed by IL-1α from adjacent damaged VSMCs, and necrotic ECs could activate neighboring normal ECs and VSMCs, causing them to release inflammatory cytokines and up-regulate adhesion molecules, thus amplifying inflammation. These data unravel the molecular mechanisms and interplay between damaged ECs and VSMCs that lead to activation of IL-1α and, thus, initiation of adaptive responses that cause graft rejection."

https://openalex.org/W2269030568,"Ca(2+)/Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) signaling in the heart regulates cardiomyocyte contractility and growth in response to elevated intracellular Ca(2+). The δB isoform of CaMKII is the predominant nuclear splice variant in the adult heart and regulates cardiomyocyte hypertrophic gene expression by signaling to the histone deacetylase HDAC4. However, the role of CaMKIIδ in cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) has not been previously explored. During post-natal growth endogenous CPCs display primarily cytosolic CaMKIIδ, which localizes to the nuclear compartment of CPCs after myocardial infarction injury. CPCs undergoing early differentiation in vitro increase levels of CaMKIIδB in the nuclear compartment where the kinase may contribute to the regulation of CPC commitment. CPCs modified with lentiviral-based constructs to overexpress CaMKIIδB (CPCeδB) have reduced proliferative rate compared with CPCs expressing eGFP alone (CPCe). Additionally, stable expression of CaMKIIδB promotes distinct morphological changes such as increased cell surface area and length of cells compared with CPCe. CPCeδB are resistant to oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) relative to CPCe, whereas knockdown of CaMKIIδB resulted in an up-regulation of cell death and cellular senescence markers compared with scrambled treated controls. Dexamethasone (Dex) treatment increased mRNA and protein expression of cardiomyogenic markers cardiac troponin T and α-smooth muscle actin in CPCeδB compared with CPCe, suggesting increased differentiation. Therefore, CaMKIIδB may serve as a novel modulatory protein to enhance CPC survival and commitment into the cardiac and smooth muscle lineages."
https://openalex.org/W1895312374,"Introduction The role of serological tests such as IgA anti-transglutaminase autoantibodies has become increasingly important in celiac disease (CD) diagnosis. However, the efficiency of these tests for patient follow-up is controversial. We investigated the correlation of 12 different serological tests, including recent deamidated gliadin and actin IgA tests, with villous atrophy (VA) in a retrospective cohort of treated celiac patients. Materials and Methods Serum samples were collected from 100 treated CD patients who had intestinal biopsy in the course of their follow-up. Antibodies against transglutaminase, deamidated gliadin peptides, and native gliadin were measured, along with IgA anti-actin. The biopsy slides were all blind-reviewed and scored according to Marsh classification. Results For all deamidated gliadin and transglutaminase tests, we found that a positive result was significantly associated with persistence of intestinal VA, with a diagnostic efficacy up to 80%. Furthermore, antibodies titers directly correlated with the degree of VA, indicating a strong link between disease activity and presence of antibodies in the serum. Interestingly, the tests with the highest association with persistent VA were those for deamidated gliadin IgG. Using a test positivity pattern analysis, we were also able to identify several groups of patients with distinct antibody profiles that showed significant differences in intestinal damage and diet compliance. Conclusions Altogether, these results show that deamidated gliadin antibodies are strongly correlated with VA and should be considered valuable tools in CD follow-up and that multiplex serologic analysis for treated CD represents a promising tool for personalized patient management."
https://openalex.org/W1903894494,"Among livestock, domestic pig (Sus scrofa) is a species, in which iron metabolism has been most intensively examined during last decade. The obvious reason for studying the regulation of iron homeostasis especially in young pigs is neonatal iron deficiency anemia commonly occurring in these animals. Moreover, supplementation of essentially all commercially reared piglets with iron entails a need for monitoring the efficacy of this routine practice followed in the swine industry for several decades. Since the discovery of hepcidin many studies confirmed its role as key regulator of iron metabolism and pointed out the assessment of its concentrations in biological fluids as diagnostic tool for iron-related disorder. Here we demonstrate that urine hepcidin-25 levels measured by a combination of weak cation exchange chromatography and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (WCX-TOF MS) are highly correlated with mRNA hepcidin expression in the liver and plasma hepcidin-25 concentrations in anemic and iron-supplemented 28-day old piglets. We also found a high correlation between urine hepcidin level and hepatic non-heme iron content. Our results show that similarly to previously described transgenic mouse models of iron disorders, young pigs constitute a convenient animal model to explore accuracy and relationship between indicators for assessing systemic iron status."
https://openalex.org/W2130010654,"Most centralities proposed for identifying influential spreaders on social networks to either spread a message or to stop an epidemic require the full topological information of the network on which spreading occurs. In practice, however, collecting all connections between agents in social networks can be hardly achieved. As a result, such metrics could be difficult to apply to real social networks. Consequently, a new approach for identifying influential people without the explicit network information is demanded in order to provide an efficient immunization or spreading strategy, in a practical sense. In this study, we seek a possible way for finding influential spreaders by using the social mechanisms of how social connections are formed in real networks. We find that a reliable immunization scheme can be achieved by asking people how they interact with each other. From these surveys we find that the probabilistic tendency to connect to a hub has the strongest predictive power for influential spreaders among tested social mechanisms. Our observation also suggests that people who connect different communities is more likely to be an influential spreader when a network has a strong modular structure. Our finding implies that not only the effect of network location but also the behavior of individuals is important to design optimal immunization or spreading schemes."

Data were provided by the person requesting an HIV test using a handheld electronic tablet. All persons (≥16yrs) presenting for an HIV test April 2013–March 2014 were included. Rates per 100,000 were calculated using region-specific denominators for Kiev. Results During the study period 6370 individuals tested for HIV, equivalent to a testing rate of 293.2 per 100,000. Of these, 467 (7.8%) were HIV-positive, with the highest proportion positive among 31–35 year olds (11.2%), males (9.4%), people who inject drugs (PWID) (17.9%) and men who have sex with men (MSM) (24.1%). Using published population size estimates of MSM, diagnosis rates for MSM ranged from 490.6to 1548.3/100,000. A higher proportion of heterosexual women compared to heterosexual men reported contact with PWID, (16% vs. 4.7%) suggesting a bridging in risk between PWID and their sexual partners. Conclusion Collection of HIV risk factor information in Kiev, essential for the purposes of developing effective HIV prevention and response tools, is feasible. The high percentage of MSM among those testing positive for HIV, may indicate a significant level of undisclosed sex between men in national figures."

Additionally, cathepsin D-cleaved 20-kDa IL-1β was minimally active at IL-1R1 and was not further cleaved to highly active 17-kDa IL-1β. Therefore formation of the 20-kDa form of IL-1β may prevent the generation of mature bioactive IL-1β and thus may limit inflammation."

Entry into red blood cells is governed by interactions between parasite adhesins and red blood cell receptors. Previously we identified that P. falciparum reticulocyte binding protein-like homologue 4 (PfRh4) binds to complement receptor 1 (CR1) to mediate entry of malaria parasites into human red blood cells. In this report we characterize a collection of anti-PfRh4 monoclonal antibodies and CR1 protein fragments that modulate the interaction between PfRh4 and CR1. We identify an anti-PfRh4 monoclonal that blocks PfRh4-CR1 interaction in vitro, inhibits PfRh4 binding to red blood cells, and as a result abolishes the PfRh4-CR1 invasion pathway in P. falciparum. Epitope mapping of anti-PfRh4 monoclonal antibodies identified distinct functional regions within PfRh4 involved in modulating its interaction with CR1. Furthermore, we designed a set of protein fragments based on extensive mutagenesis analyses of the PfRh4 binding site on CR1 and determined their interaction affinities using surface plasmon resonance. These CR1 protein fragments bind tightly to PfRh4 and also function as soluble inhibitors to block PfRh4 binding to red blood cells and to inhibit the PfRh4-CR1 invasion pathway. Our findings can aid future efforts in designing specific single epitope antibodies to block P. falciparum invasion via complement receptor 1.

Using voxel-based morphometry technique (VBM), the current study identified a set of distributed areas where the gray matter volume (GM) correlated positively with participants' efficiency in interference inhibition. These areas included the bilateral prefrontal gyri, left insula and inferior temporal gyrus, the left inferior parietal lobule. Further analysis using a novel machine learning algorithm with balanced cross-validation procedure confirmed that in these areas the GM-behavioral association was unlikely a byproduct of outlier values, instead, the gray matter volume could predict reliably participants' interference inhibition efficiency. These results underscore the importance of the fronto-parietal and insula systems to the brain functioning of interference inhibition from the neuroanatomical perspective."
https://openalex.org/W2203820337,"Direct interactions among pancreatic β-cells via cell surface proteins inhibit basal and enhance stimulated insulin secretion. Here, we functionally and biochemically characterized Kirrel2, an immunoglobulin superfamily protein with β-cell-specific expression in the pancreas. Our results show that Kirrel2 is a phosphorylated glycoprotein that co-localizes and interacts with the adherens junction proteins E-cadherin and β-catenin in MIN6 cells. We further demonstrate that the phosphosites Tyr595–596 are functionally relevant for the regulation of Kirrel2 stability and localization. Analysis of the extracellular and intracellular domains of Kirrel2 revealed that it is cleaved and shed from MIN6 cells and that the remaining membrane spanning cytoplasmic domain is processed by γ-secretase complex. Kirrel2 knockdown with RNA interference in MIN6 cells and ablation of Kirrel2 from mice with genetic deletion resulted in increased basal insulin secretion from β-cells, with no immediate influence on stimulated insulin secretion, total insulin content, or whole body glucose metabolism. Our results show that in pancreatic β-cells Kirrel2 localizes to adherens junctions, is regulated by multiple post-translational events, including glycosylation, extracellular cleavage, and phosphorylation, and engages in the regulation of basal insulin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1781117934,"Dermatan sulfate (DS), also known as chondroitin sulfate (CS)-B, is a member of the linear polysaccharides called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). The expression of CS/DS and DS proteoglycans is increased in several fibrotic renal diseases, including interstitial fibrosis, diabetic nephropathy, mesangial sclerosis and nephrosclerosis. Little, however, is known about structural alterations in DS in renal diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the renal expression of two different DS domains in renal transplant rejection and glomerular pathologies. DS expression was evaluated in normal renal tissue and in kidney biopsies obtained from patients with acute interstitial or vascular renal allograft rejection, patients with interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IF/TA), and from patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), membranous glomerulopathy (MGP) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), using our unique specific anti-DS antibodies LKN1 and GD3A12. Expression of the 4/2,4-di-O-sulfated DS domain recognized by antibody LKN1 was decreased in the interstitium of transplant kidneys with IF/TA, which was accompanied by an increased expression of type I collagen, decorin and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), while its expression was increased in the interstitium in FSGS, MGP and SLE. Importantly, all patients showed glomerular LKN1 staining in contrast to the controls. Expression of the IdoA-Gal-NAc4SDS domain recognized by GD3A12 was similar in controls and patients. Our data suggest a role for the DS domain recognized by antibody LKN1 in renal diseases with early fibrosis. Further research is required to delineate the exact role of different DS domains in renal fibrosis."

Domains that have been added progressively to MSC components during evolution are linked by unstructured flexible peptides, producing an elongated and multiarmed MSC structure that is easily attacked by proteases in vivo. A yeast two-hybrid screen for proteins interacting with LeuRS, a representative MSC member, identified calpain 2, a calcium-activated neutral cysteine protease. Calpain 2 and calpain 1 could partially hydrolyze most MSC components to generate specific fragments that resembled those reported previously. The cleavage sites of calpain in ArgRS, GlnRS, and p43 were precisely mapped. After cleavage, their N-terminal regions were removed. Sixty-three amino acid residues were removed from the N terminus of ArgRS to form ArgRSΔN63; GlnRS formed GlnRSΔN198, and p43 formed p43ΔN106. GlnRSΔN198 had a much weaker affinity for its substrates, tRNAGln and glutamine. p43ΔN106 was the same as the previously reported p43-derived apoptosis-released factor. The formation of p43ΔN106 by calpain depended on Ca2+ and could be specifically inhibited by calpeptin and by RNAi of the regulatory subunit of calpain in vivo.

The reaction can be separated into two steps: (a) the ATP-PPi exchange for amino acid activation and (b) aminoacylation of tRNA (1Perona J.J. Gruic-Sovulj I. Synthetic and editing mechanisms of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.Top. Curr. Chem. 2014; 344: 1-41PubMed Google Scholar). Specificity of aminoacylation catalyzed by aaRSs ensures the accurate translation of the genetic code in the first step of protein synthesis (1Perona J.J. Gruic-Sovulj I. Synthetic and editing mechanisms of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.Top. Curr. Chem. 2014; 344: 1-41PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to their canonical aminoacylation function, an increasing number of non-canonical (non-catalytic) functions have been identified for aaRS (2Yao P. Poruri K. Martinis S.A. Fox P.L. Non-catalytic regulation of gene expression by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.Top. Curr. Chem. 2014; 344: 167-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 3Guo M. Schimmel P.

In the human cytoplasm, a multiple aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex (MSC) has been found that comprises 11 polypeptides and harbors the activities of nine aaRSs, bifunctional glutamylprolyl- (GluPro/EP-), isoleucyl- (Ile), leucyl- (Leu), methionyl- (Met), glutaminyl- (Gln), lysyl- (Lys), arginyl- (Arg), and aspartyl- (Asp) tRNA synthetases, and three non-synthetase components, p18, p38, and p43, which are also named AIMP3, AIMP2, and AIMP1, respectively (4Guo M. Yang X.L. Architecture and metamorphosis.Top. Curr. Chem. 2014; 344: 89-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Over the years, a number of different functions have been proposed for the MSC (5Kim J.H. Han J.M. Kim S. Protein-protein interactions and multi-component complexes of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.Top. Curr. Chem. 2014; 344: 119-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 6Ray P.S. Arif A. Fox P.L. Macromolecular complexes as depots for releasable regulatory proteins.Trends Biochem.

The eucaryotic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex: suggestions for its structure and function.J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). First, the MSC may serve as a means to stabilize its own components. The stability of each component is variable, depending on the presence of other components in the MSC. The AIMPs are critical for the stability of the whole complex (5Kim J.H. Han J.M. Kim S. Protein-protein interactions and multi-component complexes of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.Top. Curr. Chem. 2014; 344: 119-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Second, the MSC may be considered as a “reservoir” or “depot” for regulatory proteins with auxiliary functions when released (6Ray P.S. Arif A. Fox P.L. Macromolecular complexes as depots for releasable regulatory proteins.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 158-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Third, the MSC may help eukaryotic cells to create a channel for aminoacyl-tRNAs (7Deutscher M.P. The eucaryotic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex: suggestions for its structure and function.J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Thus, the MSC, as a source of releasable regulatory proteins, is a vital element of cell homeostasis. To date, few data have been reported about the release of the MSC components by protease digestion in vivo (4Guo M. Yang X.L. Architecture and metamorphosis.Top. Curr. Chem. 2014; 344: 89-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Protease digestion may be an efficient way to massively release free components of the MSC, which is much more efficient than amino acid modifications or alternative splicing. Using hydrodynamic methods and small angle x-ray scattering, a structural study of the MSC demonstrated that it has an elongated and multiarmed structure with enough space for accessibility of all its components and a large protein surface area for interaction with additional factors, suggesting that the MSC might be easily attacked by proteases in vivo (8Dias J. Renault L. Pérez J. Mirande M. Small-angle x-ray solution scattering study of the multi-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex reveals an elongated and multi-armed particle.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 23979-23989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Early studies observed that several mammalian aaRSs with significant parts deleted by controlled proteolysis were fully active, indicating that the deletions were not essential for catalytic activity but were essential for maintaining the structure of the MSC (7Deutscher M.P. The eucaryotic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex: suggestions for its structure and function.J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Later, caspase 7 was shown to cleave human MSC proteins in vitro (9Shalak V. Kaminska M. Mitnacht-Kraus R. Vandenabeele P. Clauss M. Mirande M. The EMAPII cytokine is released from the mammalian multisynthetase complex after cleavage of its p43/proEMAPII component.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23769-23776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). p43 was cleaved with the release of the endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide II fragment, which has inflammatory cytokine properties under apoptotic conditions. Other components, including GluProRS, LysRS, and AspRS, of human MSC were also digested by caspase 7 in vitro; however, only ProRS was released from the MSC (9Shalak V. Kaminska M. Mitnacht-Kraus R. Vandenabeele P. Clauss M. Mirande M. The EMAPII cytokine is released from the mammalian multisynthetase complex after cleavage of its p43/proEMAPII component.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23769-23776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). By contrast, p43-derived apoptosis-released factor, discovered in apoptotic U937 cells, was proposed as a proteolytic fragment of p43 derived from elastase digestion (10Shalak V. Guigou L. Kaminska M. Wautier M.P. Wautier J.L. Mirande M. Characterization of p43(ARF), a derivative of the p43 component of multiaminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex released during apoptosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10935-10943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). More generally, proteolysis has been observed within several human aaRSs in the specific peptides linking the new accessory domains to the catalytic conserved cores. Interestingly, these linkers are predicted to be random coils and are generally disordered in crystal structures of aaRSs (4Guo M. Yang X.L. Architecture and metamorphosis.Top. Curr. Chem. 2014; 344: 89-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Ubiquitously distributed, calpain (also called CANP) is a Ca2+-dependent family of neutral proteases (11Sorimachi H. Hata S. Ono Y. Calpain chronicle—an enzyme family under multidisciplinary characterization.Proc. Jpn. Acad. Ser. B Phys. Biol. Sci. 2011; 87: 287-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The activity of calpain is activated by the intracellular Ca2+ and inhibited by the endogenous inhibitor calpastatin (12Chakraborti S. Alam M.N. Paik D. Shaikh S. Chakraborti T. Implications of calpains in health and diseases.Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 2012; 49: 316-328PubMed Google Scholar). Among the 15 mammalian calpain isoforms, calpain 1 and calpain 2 are the best characterized: both are heterodimers with a common small regulatory subunit (CAPNS1; also named as calpain 4) and a different large subunit. In the present work, calpain 1 and calpain 2 were chosen as representatives of the distinct, large catalytic subunits (11Sorimachi H. Hata S. Ono Y. Calpain chronicle—an enzyme family under multidisciplinary characterization.Proc. Jpn. Acad. Ser. B Phys. Biol. Sci. 2011; 87: 287-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Calpain 2, which is also named “m-calpain” or “mm Ca2+-requiring calpain,” is a core member of the calpain enzyme family; however, calpain 1 (also named as μ-calpain) requires a lower concentration of Ca2+ for activation (μm Ca2+-requiring calpain) (11Sorimachi H. Hata S. Ono Y. Calpain chronicle—an enzyme family under multidisciplinary characterization.Proc. Jpn. Acad. Ser. B Phys. Biol. Sci. 2011; 87: 287-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Compared with other intracellular proteolytic systems, calpains cleave their substrates according to the tertiary structure of substrates rather than their primary sequences (11Sorimachi H. Hata S. Ono Y. Calpain chronicle—an enzyme family under multidisciplinary characterization.Proc. Jpn. Acad. Ser. B Phys. Biol. Sci. 2011; 87: 287-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Therefore, accessible interdomain unstructured peptide bonds of aaRSs might be favored targets of calpains. In addition, calpain has been reported to regulate protein synthesis by cleaving components of the translation machinery, such as cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein 3 and eukaryotic initiation factor 4G1 (eIF4G1) (13Vosler P.S. Gao Y. Brennan C.S. Yanagiya A. Gan Y. Cao G. Zhang F. Morley S.J. Sonenberg N. Bennett M.V. Chen J.

Biol. 2012; 32: 3321-3332Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To identify new factors able to release functional fragments in vivo from the MSC, with LeuRS as the bait, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening on a human cDNA library. We found that calpain 2 interacts with LeuRS. Moreover, calpain cleaved other MSC components, which affected their aminoacylation activity and released their specific fragments with potential new functions. Our results suggested that the calpain family is involved in dissociation of the MSC and might regulate the functions of MSC components and connect their canonical and non-canonical functions. Materials for biochemical experiments were reported previously (15Zhou X.L. Fang Z.P. Ruan Z.R. Wang M. Liu R.J. Tan M. Anella F.M. Wang E.D.

Biochem. 2012; 151: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The purified calpain 2 heterodimer is termed recombinant calpain 2 here. The components of the MSC were purified by expression of their genes from the recombinant plasmids in E. coli (BL21) (17Zhou X.L. Zhu B. Wang E.D.

Purification of the MSC by co-immunoprecipitation was performed in 293T cells transfected with the genes encoding FLAG-ArgRS and FLAG-p43 independently. Transfected cells were continuously incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and collected for lysis. Cell lysate supernatants were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitated complex was washed with PBS buffer four times and then eluted with buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm potassium acetate, 1.5 mm MgAc2, and 500 ng/μl 3×FLAG peptides. Eluted MSCs were used as substrates for recombinant calpain 2 or calpain 1 hydrolytic experiments. The gene encoding the C-terminal domain of LeuRS (residues 708–1176) was cloned into pGBKT7 and transformed into yeast Y2HGold strain. The transformed strains were mated with Y187 strains transformed with a simplified human cDNA library. After perfect mating, they were plated on selective plates for positive clone screening. The yeast two-hybrid screening was performed approximately according to the protocol supplied by Takara (Japan). The proteolysis of MSC components (5–20 μg each) was carried out at 37 °C for 30 min in a reaction mixture containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm potassium acetate, 1.5 mm MgAc2, and 8 μg/ml recombinant calpain 2 with 5 mm Ca2+ or 24 μg/ml calpain 1 with 0.5 mm Ca2+ (14Wang C.F.

After proteolysis, generated fragments from some components, including ArgRS, GlnRS, and p43, were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membrane in CAPS transfer buffer. Significant bands were excised, and their N termini were sequenced by Shanghai Applied Protein Technology Co. Ltd.

Biol. 2012; 32: 3321-3332Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. The preparation of Jurkat extracts supernatant (Jurkat S100) and the manipulation of protein cleavage by Jurkat S100 were performed according to the method described by Wang and Huang (14Wang C.F. Huang Y.S. Calpain 2 activated through N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor signaling cleaves CPEB3 and abrogates CPEB3-repressed translation in neurons.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2012; 32: 3321-3332Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). U937 cell starvation was performed as follows. U937 cells were grown with RPMI 1640 medium plus 10% FBS, and then 2.5 × 107 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution twice and cultured with RPMI 1640 medium plus 0.2% FBS for 48 h. Starved U937 cells and culture medium were collected by centrifugation at 240 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. After rinsing twice with PBS, cell pellets were lysed with 2× SDS loading buffer. Protein in the culture medium was precipitated according to the method of Park et al. (18Park M.C. Kang T. Jin D. Han J.M. Kim S.B. Park Y.J. Cho K. Park Y.W. Guo M. He W. Yang X.L. Schimmel P.

The protein extracts from the culture medium and cytosol were separately subjected to Western blotting. 293T cells transfected with the plasmids containing the gene encoding GlnRS or its truncated domains with enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) at their C termini were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). After washing, immunofluorescence was analyzed under an Olympus FV1000 microscope. The gene encoding tRNAGln(CUG) was recombined into pTrc99b under the control of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. In vitro transcription of tRNAGln(CUG) by T7 RNA polymerase was performed similarly to that described previously (15Zhou X.L. Fang Z.P. Ruan Z.R. Wang M. Liu R.J. Tan M. Anella F.M. Wang E.D. Aminoacylation and translational quality control strategy employed by leucyl-tRNA synthetase from a human pathogen with genetic code ambiguity.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: 9825-9838Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The amino acid accepting activity of tRNAGln(CUG) was 1410 pmol/A260. 3′-End 32P labeling of tRNAGln(CUG) was performed as described previously with minor changes (15Zhou X.L. Fang Z.P. Ruan Z.R. Wang M. Liu R.J. Tan M. Anella F.M. Wang E.D. Aminoacylation and translational quality control strategy employed by leucyl-tRNA synthetase from a human pathogen with genetic code ambiguity.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: 9825-9838Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Labeling was performed at 37 °C in a mixture containing 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 12 mm MgCl2, 15 μm tRNAGln(CUG), 0.5 mm DTT, 15 μm ATP, 50 μm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 0.333 μm [α-32P]ATP, and 10 μm E. coli CCA-adding enzyme for 10 min. 0.7 unit/μl pyrophosphatase was added to the mixture for another 5 min. Phenol/chloroform extraction of [32P]tRNAGln(CUG) was conducted as described previously (15Zhou X.L. Fang Z.P. Ruan Z.R. Wang M. Liu R.J. Tan M. Anella F.M. Wang E.D. Aminoacylation and translational quality control strategy employed by leucyl-tRNA synthetase from a human pathogen with genetic code ambiguity.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: 9825-9838Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Aminoacylation assays were carried out in reaction mixtures containing 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 4 mm ATP, 20 μm [3H]Gln, 10 μm tRNAGln(CUG), and 0.1 mg/ml BSA at 37 °C. Reactions were initiated by adding 20 nm GlnRS or GlnRSΔN198. At various time intervals, aliquots were quenched and precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid as described previously (15Zhou X.L. Fang Z.P. Ruan Z.R. Wang M. Liu R.J. Tan M. Anella F.M. Wang E.D. Aminoacylation and translational quality control strategy employed by leucyl-tRNA synthetase from a human pathogen with genetic code ambiguity.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: 9825-9838Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). 32P-labeled tRNA was used to measure the kinetic parameters of aminoacylation because of the high Km value of the GlnRSΔN198 for Gln (19Ledoux S. Uhlenbeck O.C. [3′-32P]-Labeling tRNA with nucleotidyltransferase for assaying aminoacylation and peptide bond formation.Methods. 2008; 44: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The Km values of the native and mutant GlnRSs for tRNA were measured at 37 °C in a reaction mixture containing 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 4 mm ATP, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 0.1 μm [32P]tRNAGln(CUG), and 10 or 50 mm Gln for GlnRS or GlnRSΔN198, respectively. Cold tRNAGln(CUG) concentrations varied between 0.1 and 1.7 μm for GlnRS and between 1 and 16 μm for GlnRSΔN198. The reaction was initiated by adding 5 nm GlnRS or 10 nm GlnRSΔN198. The Km value of GlnRSΔN198 for Gln was assayed by a similar experiment with 0.1 μm [32P]tRNAGln(CUG) and 15 μm cold tRNAGln(CUG), and the concentration of Gln varied between 0.05 and 1.6 mm. At specific time intervals, aliquots were removed for quenching in 0.5 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and ethanol-precipitated. Sample treatment and data collection were performed as described previously (15Zhou X.L. Fang Z.P. Ruan Z.R. Wang M. Liu R.J. Tan M. Anella F.M. Wang E.D. Aminoacylation and translational quality control strategy employed by leucyl-tRNA synthetase from a human pathogen with genetic code ambiguity.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: 9825-9838Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). [3H]Gln was used to determine the Km of GlnRS for Gln because of the low Km values of GlnRS for tRNA and Gln. The reaction contained 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 4 mm ATP, 10 μm tRNAGln(CUG), and 0.1 mg/ml BSA at 37 °C. The concentration of [3H]Gln varied between 2.5 and 25 μm. The reaction was initiated by adding 5 nm GlnRS. Sample treatment and data collection were performed as described previously (15Zhou X.L. Fang Z.P. Ruan Z.R. Wang M. Liu R.J. Tan M. Anella F.M.

All experiments were repeated successfully. A yeast two-hybrid screen was performed to identify new partners that could interact with the MSC and have potential regulatory functions. Based on our comprehensive biochemical research on LeuRS, human cytosolic LeuRS was chosen as a representative of MSC members, and its C-terminal domain (residues 708–1176) was used as the bait to screen a human cDNA library. 3.4 × 106 clones were screened, and 80 positive clones were isolated. Calpain 2, with 17 occurrences, drew our attention. To verify this interaction, FLAG-calpain 2 was co-expressed with Myc-LeuRS in 293T cells, and a co-immunoprecipitation experiment was performed with anti-FLAG antibody. LeuRS was co-immunoprecipitated with calpain 2 as shown by anti-Myc antibody, confirming the interaction observed in the two-hybrid system (Fig. 1A). We used the supernatant of Jurkat extracts (Jurkat S100) containing calpain 2 in vitro to assay hydrolysis of recombinant LeuRS (N terminus His6-tagged) and found that LeuRS was cleaved"
https://openalex.org/W1885745006,"Pertussis toxin (PTx), an AB5 toxin and major virulence factor of the whooping cough-causing pathogen Bordetella pertussis, has been shown to affect the blood-brain barrier. Dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier may facilitate penetration of bacterial pathogens into the brain, such as Escherichia coli K1 (RS218). In this study, we investigated the influence of PTx on blood-brain barrier permissiveness to E. coli infection using human brain-derived endothelial HBMEC and TY10 cells as in vitro models. Our results indicate that PTx acts at several key points of host cell intracellular signaling pathways, which are also affected by E. coli K1 RS218 infection. Application of PTx increased the expression of the pathogen binding receptor gp96. Further, we found an activation of STAT3 and of the small GTPase Rac1, which have been described as being essential for bacterial invasion involving host cell actin cytoskeleton rearrangements at the bacterial entry site. In addition, we showed that PTx induces a remarkable relocation of VE-cadherin and β-catenin from intercellular junctions. The observed changes in host cell signaling molecules were accompanied by differences in intracellular calcium levels, which might act as a second messenger system for PTx. In summary, PTx not only facilitates invasion of E. coli K1 RS218 by activating essential signaling cascades; it also affects intercellular barriers to increase paracellular translocation."
https://openalex.org/W2097195342,"Apolipoprotein B (APOB) and Adiponectin Receptor 1 (ADIPOR1) are related to the regulation of feed intake, fat metabolism and protein deposition and are candidate genes for genomic studies in birds. In this study, associations of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) g.102A>T (APOB) and g.729C>T (ADIPOR1) with carcass, bone integrity and performance traits in broilers were investigated. Genotyping was performed on a paternal line of 1,454 broilers. The SNP detection was carried out by PCR-RFLP technique using the restriction enzymes HhaI for the SNP g.729C>T and MslI for the SNP g.102A>T. The association analyses of the two SNPs with 85 traits were performed using the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) and Generalized Quasi-Likelihood Score (GQLS) methods. For REML the model included the random additive genetic effect of animal and fixed effects of sex, hatch and SNP genotypes. In the GQLS method, a logistic regression was used to associate the genotypes with phenotypes adjusted for fixed effects of sex and hatch. The SNP g.729C>T in the ADIPOR1 gene was associated with thickness of the femur and breast skin yield. Thus, the ADIPOR1 gene seems implicated in the metabolism and/or fat deposition and bone integrity in broilers."
https://openalex.org/W1925975122,"One of the major hurdles in liver gene and cell therapy is availability of ex vivo-expanded hepatocytes. Pluripotent stem cells are an attractive alternative. Here, we show that hepatocyte precursors can be isolated from male germline cell-derived pluripotent stem cells (GPSCs) using the hepatoblast marker, Liv2, and induced to differentiate into hepatocytes in vitro. These cells expressed hepatic-specific genes and were functional as demonstrated by their ability to secrete albumin and produce urea. When transplanted in the liver parenchyma of partially hepatectomised mice, Liv2-sorted cells showed regional and heterogeneous engraftment in the injected lobe. Moreover, approximately 50% of Y chromosome-positive, GPSC-derived cells were found in the female livers, in the region of engraftment, even one month after cell injection. This is the first study showing that Liv2-sorted GPSCs-derived hepatocytes can undergo long lasting engraftment in the mouse liver. Thus, GPSCs might offer promise for regenerative medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2147670493,"In contrast to mature cardiomyocytes which have limited regenerative capacity, pluripotent stem cells represent a promising source for the generation of new cardiomyocytes. The tendency of pluripotent stem cells to form teratomas and the heterogeneity from various differentiation stages and cardiomyocyte cell sub-types, however, are major obstacles to overcome before this type of therapy could be applied in a clinical setting. Thus, the identification of extracellular markers for specific cardiomyocyte progenitors and mature subpopulations is of particular importance. The delineation of cardiomyocyte surface marker patterns not only serves as a means to derive homogeneous cell populations by FACS, but is also an essential tool to understand cardiac development. By using single-cell expression profiling in early mouse embryonic hearts, we found that a combination of integrin alpha-1, alpha-5, alpha-6 and N-cadherin enables isolation of lineage committed murine cardiomyocytes. Additionally, we were able to separate trabecular cardiomyocytes from solid ventricular myocardium and atrial murine cells. These cells exhibit expected subtype specific phenotype confirmed by electrophysiological analysis. We show that integrin expression can be used for the isolation of living, functional and lineage-specific murine cardiomyocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2157645627,"Motor proteins display widely different stepping patterns as they move on microtubule tracks, from the deterministic linear or helical motion performed by the protein kinesin to the uncoordinated random steps made by dynein. How these different strategies produce an efficient navigation system needed to ensure correct cellular functioning is still unclear. Here, we show by numerical simulations that deterministic and random motor steps yield different outcomes when random obstacles decorate the microtubule tracks: kinesin moves faster on clean tracks but its motion is strongly hindered on decorated tracks, while dynein is slower on clean tracks but more efficient in avoiding obstacles. Further simulations indicate that dynein’s advantage on decorated tracks is due to its ability to step backwards. Our results explain how different navigation strategies are employed by the cell to optimize motor driven cargo transport."
https://openalex.org/W2136276785,"Intensification of pedestrian tourism causes damage to trees near tourist tracks, and likewise changes the soil structure. As a result, one may expect that annual amount of trees growing near tracks is significantly lower than deeper in the forest. However, during the study of the long-term impact of tourism on the environment (determined from tree increment dynamics), some methodological problems may occur. It is particularly important in protected areas where law and administrative regulations related to nature conservation force research to be conducted using small samples. In this paper we have analyzed the data collected in the Polish part of the Tatra National Park in the two study plots divided into two zones each: the area directly under the influence of the tourist's trampling and the control group. The aim of such analyses was to present the potential effects of the factors which may affect the results of dendrochronological analysis: (i) small size of samples that affects their representativeness, (ii) spatial differences in the rates of the process, as a result of spatial variability of environmental factors and (iii) temporal differences in the rates of the process. This study confirms that the factors mentioned above could significantly influence the results and should be taken into consideration during the analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2142782148,"Autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a pronounced reduction of brain volume and intellectual disability. A current model for the microcephaly phenotype invokes a stem cell proliferation and differentiation defect, which has moved the disease into the spotlight of stem cell biology and neurodevelopmental science. Homozygous mutations of the Cyclin-dependent kinase-5 regulatory subunit-associated protein 2 gene CDK5RAP2 are one genetic cause of MCPH. To further characterize the pathomechanism underlying MCPH, we generated a conditional Cdk5rap2 LoxP/hCMV Cre mutant mouse. Further analysis, initiated on account of a lack of a microcephaly phenotype in these mutant mice, revealed the presence of previously unknown splice variants of the Cdk5rap2 gene that are at least in part accountable for the lack of microcephaly in the mice."
https://openalex.org/W1795281961,"The signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) family plays important roles in adaptive immune responses. Herein, we evaluated whether the SLAM family member 2B4 (CD244) plays a role in immune cell development, homeostasis and antibody responses. We found that the splenic cellularity in Cd244-/- mice was significantly reduced due to a reduction in both CD4 T cells and follicular (Fo) B cells; whereas, the number of peritoneal cavity B cells was increased. These findings led us to examine whether 2B4 modulates B cell immune responses. When we examined T-dependent B cell responses, while there was no difference in the kinetics or magnitude of the antigen-specific IgM and IgG1 antibody response there was a reduction in bone marrow (BM) memory, but not plasma cells in Cd244-/- mice. When we evaluated T-independent immune responses, we found that antigen-specific IgM and IgG3 were elevated in the serum following immunization. These data indicate that 2B4 dampens T-independent B cell responses due to a reduction in peritoneal cavity B cells, but has minimal impact on T-dependent B cell responses."
