https://openalex.org/W1997614722,"The function of the c-Myc oncoprotein and its role in cell growth control is unclear. A basic region of c-Myc is structurally related to the basic motifs of helix-loop-helix (HLH) and leucine zipper proteins, which provide sequence-specific DNA binding function. The c-Myc basic region was tested for its ability to bind DNA by attaching it to the HLH dimerization interface of the E12 enhancer binding factor. Dimers of the chimeric protein, termed E6, specifically bound an E box element (GGCCACGTGACC) recognized by other HLH proteins in a manner dependent on the integrity of the c-Myc basic motif. Methylation of the core CpG in the E box recognition site specifically inhibited binding by E6, but not by two other HLH proteins. Expression of E6 (but not an E6 DNA binding mutant) suppressed the ability of c-myc to cooperate with H-ras in a rat embryo fibroblast transformation assay, suggesting that the DNA recognition specificity of E6 is related to that of c-Myc in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2014456898,"Platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs) are growth-regulatory molecules that stimulate chemotaxis, proliferation, and increased metabolism of primarily connective tissue cells. In a survey of normal tissues, we found specific immunostaining for PDGF B-chain in neurons, principal dendrites, some axons, and probable terminals throughout the brain, in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, and in the posterior pituitary of a nonhuman primate (Macaca nemestrina). PDGF activity was extracted from brain cortex and posterior pituitary, and ubiquitous expression of transcripts for the two chains of PDGF and both PDGF receptors was detected throughout the brain and posterior pituitary. A transgenic model was also evaluated in which the chioramphenicol acetyltransferase gene was placed under transcriptional control of the PDGF B-chain promoter. The transgene was preferentially expressed within neural cell bodies in the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. PDGF may act as a neuronal regulatory agent. Neuronal release of PDGF could contribute to nerve regeneration and to glial proliferation that leads to gliosis and scarring."

https://openalex.org/W2075378388,"Concerted evolution is the production and maintenance of homogeneity within repeated families of DNA. Two mechanisms—unequal crossing over and biased gene conversion—have been the principal explanations of concerted evolution. Concerted evolution of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) arrays is thought to be largely the result of unequal crossing over. However, concerted evolution of rDNA in parthenogenetic lizards of hybrid origin is strongly biased toward one of two parental sequences, which is consistent with biased gene conversion as the operative mechanism. The apparent gene conversions are independent of initial genome dosage and result in homogenization of rDNA arrays across all nucleolar organizer regions."
https://openalex.org/W2089083607,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) may be a critical factor in the temporal differentiation of glial elements in the mammalian central nervous system. We have used in situ hybridization and immunoperoxidase staining to investigate the localization of PDGF A and have observed high levels of PDGF A-chain mRNA and immunoreactive PDGF A in neurons of embryonic and adult mice. PDGF A-chain expression was shown to be developmentally regulated and tissue specific. Every neuronal population examined in the central and peripheral nervous systems expresses PDGF A transcripts. Variable, significantly weaker signals are observed in glial cells. In contrast to known neurotrophic factors, the PDGF A transcripts are widely distributed among neurons. This generalized distribution of PDGF A transcripts, together with the known effects of PDGF on glial cells in vitro, suggests a unique role of neurons in regulating the proliferation and differentiation of glial cells in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2039830515,"Mice homozygous for the retinal degeneration slow (rds) mutation exhibit abnormal development of photoreceptor cells, followed by their slow degeneration. We have recently cloned the rds gene and determined the structure of the wild-type rds mRNA. Here we show that the gene is expressed exclusively in photoreceptor cells. We demonstrate that it encodes a 39 kd membrane-associated glycoprotein that is restricted to photoreceptor outer segments. By electron microscopy, we show that the rds protein is distributed uniformly within outer segment discs. The developmental appearance of the rds protein coincides with outer segment disc formation. We propose that the rds protein functions as an adhesion molecule for stabilization of the outer segment discs."
https://openalex.org/W2061645562,"A wide variety of nonexcitable cells generate repetitive transient increases in cytosolic calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]i) when stimulated with agonists that engage the phosphoinositide signalling pathway. Current theories regarding the mechanisms of oscillation disagree on whether Ca2+ inhibits or stimulates its own release from internal stores and whether inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DG) also undergo oscillations linked to the Ca2+ spikes. In this study, Ca2+ was found to stimulate its own release in REF52 fibroblasts primed by mitogens plus depolarization. However, unlike Ca2+ release in muscle and nerve cells, this amplification was insensitive to caffeine or ryanodine and required hormone receptor occupancy and functional IP3 receptors. Oscillations in [Ca2+]i were accompanied by oscillations in IP3 concentration but did not require functional protein kinase C. Therefore, the dominant feedback mechanism in this cell type appears to be Ca2+ stimulation of phospholipase C once this enzyme has been activated by hormone receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2017105911,"The recombination activating genes, RAG-1 and RAG-2, are likely to encode components of the V(D)J site-specific recombination machinery. We report here the detection of low levels of the RAG-1 transcript in the murine central nervous system by polymerase chain reaction, in situ hybridization, and Northern blot analyses. In contrast, an authentic RAG-2 transcript could not be detected reproducibly in the central nervous system. The RAG-1 transcript was found to be widespread in embryonic and postnatal neurons, with transcription being most apparent in regions of the postnatal brain with a high neuronal cell density (the cerebellum and the hippocampal formation). The results suggest that RAG-1 functions in neurons, where its role might be to recombine elements of the neuronal genome site-specifically, or to prevent detrimental alterations of the genome in these long-lived cells."
https://openalex.org/W2090103344,"Endothelial cells store the multimeric adhesive glycoprotein von Willebrand factor (vWf), which promotes the formation of a platelet plug at the site of vessel injury. To investigate the packaging of vWf into the granules called Weibel-Palade bodies, we expressed pro-vWf cDNA and cDNA lacking the prosequence in a variety of cell lines. Storage granules formed only in cells that contain a regulated pathway of secretion. Furthermore, packaging required the prosequence. Pro-vWf, lacking the C-terminal region involved in interchain disulfide bonding, formed granules. We conclude that the signal for storage is universal in that an adhesive glycoprotein can be stored by a hormone-secreting cell; the storage of vWf is independent of its covalent multimeric structure; the unusual rod shape of Weibel-Palade bodies is due to vWf; and the vWf propolypeptide is necessary for the formation of vWf storage granules."
https://openalex.org/W1971773068,"Female birds that do not normally sing possess brain nuclei associated with song production in males. To determine whether one song nucleus, the caudal nucleus of the ventral hyperstriatum (HVc), acts in conspecific song perception, courtship responses of female canaries to canary and white-crowned sparrow songs were compared before and after HVc lesions. Bilateral lesions of a portion of the HVc resulted in copulation solicitations to heterospecific song as well as conspecific song. Control females continued to respond only to conspecific song. This suggests that the HVc is critical for conspecific song perception in females. Because female canaries do not normally sing, neurons in female HVc must develop response selectivity by a mechanism different from that proposed for male birds in the motor theory of song perception."
https://openalex.org/W2024357798,"Murine beta-galactoside-binding protein, a protein classified as a soluble lectin, is shown to be a cell growth-regulatory molecule and a cytostatic factor. The growth-inhibitory effect is not related to lectin properties, and competition assays indicate that the protein binds to specific cell surface receptors with high affinity. It exerts control in G0 and at G2, both as a regulator of cell replication and as a cytostatic factor."
https://openalex.org/W1604136408,"In order to examine potential regulatory steps in plant fatty acid biosynthesis, we have developed procedures for the analysis of the major acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) intermediates of this pathway. These techniques have been used to separate and identify acyl-ACPs with chain configurations ranging from 2:0 to 18:1 and to determine the relative in vivo concentrations of acyl-ACPs in spinach leaf and developing seed. In both leaf and seed as much as 60% of the total ACPs were nonesterified (free), with the remaining proportion consisting of acyl-ACP intermediates leading to the formation of palmitate, stearate, and oleate. In spinach leaf the proportions of the various acyl groups esterified to each ACP isoform were indistinguishable, indicating that these isoforms are utilized similarly in de novo fatty acid biosynthesis in vivo. However, the acyl group distribution pattern of seed ACP-II differed significantly from that of leaf ACP-II. The malonyl-ACP levels were less than the 4:0-ACP and 6:0-ACP levels in leaf, and in contrast, the malonyl-ACP-II levels in seed were approximately 3-fold higher than the 4:0-ACP-II and 6:0-ACP-II levels. In addition, the ratio of oleoyl-ACP-II (18:1) to stearoyl-ACP-II (18:0) was higher in seed than in leaf. These data suggest that the differences in acyl-ACP patterns reflect a tissue/organ-specific difference rather than an isoform-specific difference. In extracts prepared from leaf samples collected in the dark, the levels of acetyl-ACPs were approximately 5-fold higher compared to samples collected in the light. The levels of free ACPs showed an inverse response, increasing in the light and decreasing in the dark. Notably there was no concomitant increase in the malonyl-ACP levels. The most likely explanation for the major increase in acetyl-ACP levels in the dark is that light/dark control over the rate of fatty acid biosynthesis occurs at the reaction catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase."

https://openalex.org/W1549243184,"Several recent studies of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i using fluorescent indicators have involved experiments performed at nonphysiological temperatures, frequently room temperature. In the studies reported here, a reduction in temperature was shown to influence the measurement of [Ca2+]i in two major ways. The first is an effect on the value for the Kd (apparent dissociation constant) used in the calculation of [Ca2+]i. The Kd values for indo-1 and fura-2 were found to change with temperature in a manner analogous to the related compounds [ethylene-bis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid and bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid. Experiments showed that the use of previously published Kd values (measured at 37 degrees C) in experiments at room temperature results in errors of at least 25% in the calculated [Ca2+]i. The second arises from the differential temperature sensitivities of the physiological processes that make up any particular value of [Ca2+]i. While resting [Ca2+]i was relatively unaffected by reduced temperature (27 degrees C, 13 degrees C), changes in [Ca2+]i following stimulation were profoundly influenced and in a way that was not simply predictable. Analysis of the responses indicated that the observed effects resulted largely from a temperature-dependent reduction in the rate of Ca2+ removal from the cytosol together with an additional component, namely a marked reduction in Ca2+ entry, at the lower temperature (13 degrees C). The net result was observed as changes in the initial rise in [Ca2+]i on stimulation, together with more profound, and complex, effects on the sustained elevation in [Ca2+]i following stimulation. This latter component was markedly increased at 27 degrees C, but was decreased in cells at 13 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W1673653510,"The interaction of the mono- and triglutamate forms of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate with serine hydroxymethyltransferase were determined by several methods. These methods included: determining dissociation constants by observing the absorbance at 502 nm of a ternary complex of the enzyme, glycine, and the folate compounds; determining inhibition constants from steady-state reactions; and determining the rate of formation and breakdown of the enzyme inhibitor complex by rapid reaction kinetics. Studies of the dissociation and inhibitor constants showed that both 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate have essentially the same affinity for the enzyme-glycine binary complex. However, rapid reaction and steady-state kinetic studies showed that the triglutamate form of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate both binds and is released much more slowly from the enzyme-glycine binary complex, compared with the triglutamate form of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. The results also showed that only one rotamer of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate binds at the active site of serine hydroxymethyltransferase. The results are discussed in terms of the possible role of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate polyglutamates in regulation of one-carbon metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2049272122,"Chickens create their immunoglobulin (Ig) repertoires during B cell development in the bursa of Fabricius by intrachromosomal gene conversion. Recent evidence has suggested that Ig gene conversion may involve cis-acting DNA elements related to those involved in V(D)J recombination. Therefore, we have examined the potential role of the V(D)J recombination activating genes, RAG-1 and RAG-2, in regulating chicken Ig gene conversion. In contrast to the coexpression of RAG-1 and RAG-2 observed in mammalian B cells that undergo V(D)J recombination, chicken B cells isolated from the bursa of Fabricius express high levels of the RAG-2 mRNA but do not express RAG-1 mRNA. The developmental and phenotypic characteristics of the bursal lymphocytes and chicken B cell lines that express RAG-2 mRNA demonstrate that selective RAG-2 expression occurs specifically in B cells undergoing Ig diversification by gene conversion. These data suggest that RAG-2 plays a fundamental role in Ig-specific gene conversion."
https://openalex.org/W1571293525,"By use of isolated canine hepatocytes and insulin analogs prepared by trypsin-catalyzed semisynthesis, we have investigated the importance of the aromatic triplet PheB24-PheB25-TyrB26 of the COOH-terminal B-chain domain of insulin in directing the affinity of insulin-receptor interactions. Analysis of the receptor binding potencies of analogs bearing transpositions or replacements (by Tyr, D-Tyr or their corresponding 3,5-diiodo derivatives) in this region demonstrates a wide divergence in the acceptance both of configurational change (with [D-TyrB24,PheB26]insulin and [D-TyrB25,PheB26]insulin exhibiting 160 and 0.1% of the receptor binding potency of insulin, respectively) and of detailed side chain structure (with [TyrB24,PheB26]insulin and [TyrB25,PheB26]insulin exhibiting 2 and 80% of the receptor binding potency of insulin, respectively). Additional experiments addressed the solvent accessibilities of the 4 tyrosine residues of insulin and the insulin analogs at selected peptide concentrations by use of analytical radioiodination. Whereas two analogs ([TyrB25,PheB26]insulin and [D-TyrB24,PheB26]insulin) were found to undergo self aggregation, no strict correlation was found between the ability of an analog to aggregate and its potency for interaction with the insulin receptor. Related findings are discussed in terms of the interplay between side chain and main chain structure in the COOH-terminal domain of the insulin B-chain and the structural attributes of insulin that determine the affinity of insulin-receptor interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2048368481,"We studied the molecular associations between peripherin (a neuronal, type III intermedlate filament subunit) and nuclear lamins. We show here that isolated peripherin binds selectively to mammalian lamin B under in vitro conditions. We further demonstrate that a synthetic peptide, representing the proximal part of peripherin's tall domain (P1), also associates with mammalian lamin B in a saturable, cooperative, and specific fashion. Laboratory animals immunized with P1 spontaneously develop idlotypic and anti-idlotypic antibodies recognizing peripherin and lamin B, respectively. These data provide essentially in vivo evidence that lamin B represents a constitutive nuclear “receptor” site for the tail domains of peripherin intermediate filaments."
https://openalex.org/W2032619982,"We have Isolated a population of vesicular carriers involved in the transport (transcytosis) of proteins from the basolateral to the apical plasma membrane of hepatocytes. The obtained fraction was enriched in compartments containing known transcytosed proteins and depleted in elements of the secretory pathway, Golgi elements, basolateral plasma membrane, as well as early endosomal components. The fraction was analyzed by biochemical and Immunological procedures. Antibodies raised against the proteins in the fraction recognized a single 108K antigen. Based on its subcellular distribution, the 108K antigen may represent a novel marker for transcytotic vesicular carriers."
https://openalex.org/W1508214573,"The relationship between epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) protein tyrosine kinase activation and ligand-induced receptor dimerization was investigated using several bivalent anti-EGF-R antibodies directed against various receptor epitopes. In A431 membrane preparations and permeabilized cells, all antibodies were able to activate the EGF-R tyrosine kinase, as measured by EGF-R autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of other substrates on tyrosine residues. EGF-R tyrosine kinase activation correlated strongly with the induction of EGF-R dimerization. (i) Both processes specifically occurred in a narrow antibody concentration range; (ii) both processes required the presence of detergent; and (iii) both processes depended on antibody bivalence since monovalent Fab fragments were inactive yet regained full activity after cross-linking by a second bivalent antibody. These data demonstrate that antibody bivalence is essential and sufficient for EGF-R activation and that activation occurs regardless of the EGF-R epitope recognized. Finally, EGF-R dimerization was shown not to depend on receptor autophosphorylation since it still occurred in the absence of ATP. Also, partial inhibition of the tyrosine kinase activity by the specific EGF-R tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrphostin AG 213 did not affect formation of EGF-R dimers. Taken together these results demonstrate that induction of EGF-R dimerization is sufficient and in case of antibody action, essential, for activation of the EGF-R tyrosine kinase and thus provide strong support for an intermolecular mechanism of EGF-R tyrosine kinase activation."
https://openalex.org/W1607723356,"We have examined the activation of phospholipase D in human platelets treated with alpha-thrombin. When incubated with 1-O-[9,10-3H2]hexadecyl-2-lysophosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) and 1-alkyl-[32P]lysoPtdCho for 2 h, platelets formed 3H/32P-labeled PtdCho in a ratio of 11:1. After incubation of such labeled platelets with alpha-thrombin for 5 min, increased accumulation of 3H/32P-labeled phosphatidic acid (PtdOH) was detected in the same ratio, indicating the action of phospholipase D. The Ca2+ ionophore A23187 and alpha-thrombin each stimulated the formation of labeled PtdOH as above in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, with only minor changes in labeled diglyceride. A23187 was able to cause increases in labeled PtdOH comparable to those observed with alpha-thrombin. beta-Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, an activator of protein kinase C, only slightly stimulated the accumulation of labeled PtOH. The protein kinase C inhibitor, staurosporine, totally blocked these changes but only slightly inhibited the increases in labeled PtdOH promoted by alpha-thrombin. These results suggest that an increase in intracellular Ca2+, rather than protein kinase C activity, is a major factor regulating phospholipase D in platelets exposed to alpha-thrombin. We have also examined the relative contributions of phospholipase D and diglyceride kinase (following phospholipase C action) to PtdOH accumulation in [32P]Pi-labeled platelets by comparing the 32P-specific radioactivities of PtdOH, PtdCho, and metabolic gamma-ATP in control and alpha-thrombin-exposed platelets. Based on these determinations, we conclude that 13 and 87% of incremental PtdOH in human platelets exposed to alpha-thrombin arises via phospholipase D acting on PtdCho and phospholipase C/diglyceride kinase, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2073296153,"The effect of floor plate on cellular differentiation in the neural tube of quail embryos was examined. In the developing neural tube the floor plate, which consists of specialized neuroepithelial cells, is located in the ventral midline of the neural tube. When Hensen's node was extirpated the floor plate and notochord did not develop, and the normal differentiation of the ventral horn motor neurons and dorsal and ventral roots did not occur. When one side of the neural tube was deprived of notochord, the ventro-dorsal differentiation took place on both sides. However, when one side of the neural tube was deprived of the floor plate, the ventral horn motor neurons and dorsal and ventral roots did not develop on that side. These observations suggest that the floor plate influences motor neuron differentiation and acts as an intrinsic organizer to establish pattern and polarity in the developing nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1556573788,"The Escherichia coli single strand binding (SSB) protein is an essential protein required for DNA replication and involved in recombination and a number of repair processes. It is a stable homotetramer in solution; however the ssb-1 mutation (His-55 to Tyr) destabilizes the tetramer with respect to monomers and this defect seems to explain the observed phenotype (Williams, K. R., Murphy, J. B., and Chase, J. W. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 11804-11811). We report a quantitative study of the SSB-1 monomer-tetramer equilibrium in vitro as a function of temperature, pH, NaCl, MgCl2, urea, and guanidine hydrochloride concentrations. The self-assembly equilibrium was monitored by the increase in intrinsic protein fluorescence anisotropy accompanying the formation of the tetramer. The experimental isotherms indicate that SSB-1 dimers are not highly populated at equilibrium, hence the formation of the tetramer is well-described as a one-step association of four monomers. At 25 degrees C, pH 8.1, the monomer concentration for 50% tetramer dissociation is (MT)1/2 = 0.87 microM, corresponding to a monomer-tetramer equilibrium constant, KT = 3 +/- 1 x 10(18) M-3. The tetramerization constant, KT, is highly dependent upon temperature and pH, with delta H0 = -51 +/- 7 kcal/mol (pH 8.1) and delta H0 = -37 +/- 5 kcal/mol (pH 6.9). There is no effect of NaCl on the monomer-tetramer association in the range from 0.20 to 1.0 M; however, MgCl2 decreases the stability of the SSB-1 tetramer. In the presence of high concentrations of the single-stranded oligonucleotide, dT(pT)15, the tetramerization constant is slightly increased indicating that binding of the oligonucleotide to the SSB-1 monomer promotes the assembly process, although not dramatically. The large negative delta H0 that is associated with formation of the tetramer provides a likely explanation for the temperature sensitivity of the ssb-1 mutation."
https://openalex.org/W1540811145,"The processing of unrepaired DNA lesions is a key to understanding and predicting the biological end points of particular DNA damages. In this study, we prepared single-stranded f1 phage (f1-K12) DNA containing dihydrothymine or beta-ureidoisobutyric acid as models for instructive or noninstructive base lesions and assessed the potential biological consequences of these lesions in vitro and in vivo. To determine the effect of the two lesions on in vitro DNA synthesis, the extent of DNA synthesis was measured by 3H-labeled nucleotide incorporation, and the newly synthesized DNA was analyzed by DNA sequencing gels. The results showed that dihydrothymine in the template was at most a weak block to in vitro DNA synthesis catalyzed by Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment (Pol I) and T4 DNA polymerase. In contrast, beta-ureidoisobutyric acid constituted a very strong (probably absolute) replicative block in vitro. With Pol I, termination bands were observed either opposite or one base prior to (3' to) the putative beta-ureidoisobutyric acid depending on its position in the template. However, when DNA synthesis was catalyzed by Pol I lacking a 3'----5' exonuclease activity, termination bands were only observed opposite beta-ureidoisobutyric acid, with purine nucleotides being incorporated preferentially opposite the lesion. With T4 DNA polymerase that contains a very active 3'----5' exonuclease activity, DNA synthesis was arrested almost exclusively one base prior to (3' to) the putative beta-ureidoisobutyric acid site in the template. We also measured survival of transfecting DNA containing dihydrothymine or beta-ureidoisobutyric acid in an attempt to correlate the in vitro data with in vivo processing. In keeping with the results obtained in vitro, dihydrothymine present in transfecting f1-K12 DNA did not constitute an inactivating lesion. On the other hand, it took 0.9 beta-ureidoisobutyric acid residues per molecule to inactivate transfecting f1-K12 DNA, indicating that the lesion was an absolute replicative block in vivo. When host cells were ultraviolet-irradiated to induce the SOS response, a slight increase (about 2-fold) in survival of transfecting f1-K12 DNA containing beta-ureidoisobutyric acid was observed. The potential effects of the structures of base lesions on lesion-polymerase interactions are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1971687948,"The asymmetric targeting of proteins to the Caulobacter predivisional cell poles yields dissimilar progeny. We show that the products of transcriptional reporter gene fusions to a flagellin gene and to the flagellar hook operon are segregated to the progeny swarmer cell. This segregation does not depend on sequences within the mRNA, but on the upstream regulatory region. The subset of developmentally regulated flagellar genes that exhibit mRNA segregation has the same upstream cis-acting elements: an activator-binding site known as the ftr sequence and an IHF-binding site. We propose that these genes are preferentially transcribed from the chromosome in the incipient swarmer cell pole of the predivisional cell."
https://openalex.org/W2168189810,"The maternal-effect gene fs(1)Ya is specifically required for embryonic mitosis in Drosophila. fs(1)Ya is involved in the initiation of the first embryonic mitosis and may also be necessary for subsequent embryonic mitotic divisions. fs(1)Ya encodes a 91.3 kd hydrophilic protein containing two putative MPF phosphorylation target sites and two potential nuclear localization signals. This protein is synthesized during postoogenic maturation from its maternal RNA and persists throughout embryogenesis. In early embryos, the fs(1)Ya protein is localized to the nuclear envelope from interphase to metaphase. During anaphase and telophase, it is dispersed in the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm, a behavior that is different from that of both the nuclear envelope and lamins. These results suggest that the fs(1)Ya protein is a cell cycle-dependent component of the nuclear envelope that specifically functions in embryonic mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W1570974013,"Overexpression of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (c-erbB) proto-oncogene is a frequent occurrence in human carcinoma and appears to accompany autocrine or paracrine transforming growth factor-alpha expression, which in model systems can result in activation of EGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity and phenotypic transformation. Here we have investigated the transcriptional regulation of the EGF receptor gene, by run-on transcription in isolated nuclei derived from epithelioid tumor lines. The level of transcription was measured at various points on the 100-kilobase pair EGF receptor gene locus, on either sense or antisense DNA strands. We find the level of sense strand transcription along exon 1 is 8-fold higher than transcription in exons 2-26. Primary EGF receptor transcripts appear to pause or terminate prematurely between exons 1 and 2. Termination was mapped to a sequenced region approximately 2 kilobase pairs 3' of exon 1, proximal to a previously reported DNase I hypersensitive site and an enhancer-like activity. Transcription in the CpG-rich region surrounding exon 1 is bidirectional, with antisense transcripts initiating in intron 1 and extending through the coding first exon. Activation of protein kinase C results in a 5-fold induction of EGF receptor transcription, accompanied by a slow release in the block RNA elongation between exon 2 and exon 26, showing that EGF receptor RNA synthesis may be altered by changes in de novo transcription and by a block to RNA elongation."
https://openalex.org/W1515726062,"Phorbol esters, acting via activation of the protein kinase C family of protein serine/threonine kinases, are able to exert profound effects on various cellular functions. In this study, we used the EL4 thymoma cell line to study the potential role of downstream protein serine/threonine kinases in cellular responses to phorbol esters. In wild-type EL4 cells, addition of phorbol ester caused a rapid activation of kinase activity toward RRLSSLRA (S6P). This increased activity was maintained for at least 15 min but diminished to control levels by 60 min. Activation of a myelin basic protein (MBP) kinase was also seen in response to phorbol ester. In a variant EL4 cell line in which phorbol ester does not induce interleukin 2 transcription, phorbol ester failed to activate either the S6P kinase or MBP kinase. Partial purification of the activated S6P and MBP kinases from wild-type cells showed that they represent separate enzymes that are distinct from protein kinase C. Although the variant cells had reduced levels of protein kinase C as compared with the wild-type cells, the amount of membrane-bound enzyme increased in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in both wild-type and variant cells. Treatment of intact cells with phorbol ester resulted in phosphorylation of some of the same protein substrates in both cell lines. Okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor, increased S6P and MBP kinase activities in both wild-type and variant cells. Thus, phorbol ester failed to activate the S6P and MBP kinases in the variant cells even though these cells express activatable protein kinase C, S6P kinase, and MBP kinase. Two protein kinase inhibitors, staurosporine and H-7, inhibited the activity of all three kinases in vitro, while a peptide inhibitor (PKC 19-31) showed specificity for protein kinase C. In summary, these results suggest that activation of messenger-independent protein kinases may be critical for certain protein kinase C-dependent responses."
https://openalex.org/W1597247671,"The function and precise mechanism of regulation of calbindin-D 9k in intestine is largely unknown. It is suggested that this calcium binding protein is involved in active intestinal calcium transport and that its expression is mainly mediated by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. We examined the effect of two side chain modified analogs of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 as compared to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 itself on the regulation of the calbindin-D 9k at the mRNA level and on intestinal calcium transport in the rat. delta 22-24,24-dihomo-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 at a single dose of 500, 1,000, and 2,000 pmol caused greater than 7.0-fold increase in calbindin-D 9k mRNA without stimulating intestinal calcium transport. A 10,000-pmol dose of delta 22-24,24,24-trihomo-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 caused a 7.6-fold increase in calbindin-D 9k mRNA without significantly increasing intestinal absorption of calcium. In contrast, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 caused a parallel increase in calbindin-D 9k mRNA and intestinal absorption of calcium. Thus, calbindin 9k is not by itself responsible for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-mediated increase in intestinal absorption of calcium."
https://openalex.org/W1482122343,"Production of thrombin by phospholipid-bound prothrombinase complexes has been described as being regulated by the prothrombin concentration in the buffer (free-substrate model) as well as by the concentration of prothrombin adsorbed to the phospholipid surface (bound-substrate model). We studied simultaneous adsorption and conversion of prothrombin on planar bilayers consisting of 20% dioleoylphosphatidylserine and 80% dioleoylphosphatidylcholine. A transport limitation in the conversion of prothrombin was prevented by using a very low (0.3 fmol cm-2) amount of prothrombinase on the bilayer. The Michaelis and catalytic constants thus found were Km = 5.8 +/- 0.7 nM and kcat = 33 +/- 1 s-1 (mean +/- S.D.). The apparent bimolecular rate constant Kcat/Km = 5.7 x 10(9) M-1 s-1 exceeds the theoretically maximal value for the free-substrate model. In contrast, kcat/Km is within the range expected for a diffusion-controlled bound-substrate model. A similar mechanism for prothrombin conversion in suspensions of phospholipid vesicles would imply increasing kcat/Km values for increasing vesicle diameter. This prediction was tested and a 3-fold increase in kcat/Km values was indeed found for vesicles 60-80 nm in diameter compared to vesicles of 20-30 nm diameter. It is concluded that thrombin production is dependent on protein fluxes rather than on protein concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W1512268896,"In this paper we examine the role of the DNA polymerase accessory proteins in modulating the processivity of DNA synthesis by the bacteriophage T4-coded five protein replication complex in vitro. Primed single-stranded DNA was used as a template for the DNA synthesis reactions, and buffer conditions were chosen to mimic in vivo salt concentrations. We find that the accessory proteins significantly increase the DNA-bound lifetime of the holoenzyme complex but that the maximum lifetime of the complex is still less than 10 s at 22 degrees C. The accessory proteins greatly enhance the processivity of the holoenzyme relative to that of the polymerase alone. ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by the accessory proteins complex is required to achieve this enhancement. We have investigated the temporal relationship between ATP hydrolysis by the accessory proteins and primer elongation by the holoenzyme and find that ATPase activity is required for initial assembly of the holoenzyme complex but not for elongation per se. Thus we conclude that the increased processivity displayed by the holoenzyme in moving through regions of template secondary structure reflects the high intrinsic processivity of the holoenzyme complex itself rather than a requirement for a concomitant ATPase-driven helicase activity during elongation. We have also measured the ATPase activity of the accessory proteins as a function of polymerase concentration and find that the rate of ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by this complex decreases significantly when the accessory proteins are assembled (with polymerase and gene 32 protein) into the five-protein holoenzyme and coupled to primer elongation. Based on these results we discuss mechanisms by which the ATPase activity of the polymerase accessory proteins might stimulate the overall processivity of the holoenzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2033680538,"The amp operon, which is located on the Escherichia coli chromosome, modulates the induction of plasmid-borne beta-lactamase genes by extracellular beta-lactam antibiotics. This suggests that the gene products AmpD and AmpE may function in the transduction of external signals. beta-Lactam antibiotics are analogs of cell wall components that can be released during cell wall morphogenesis of enterobacteria. The amp operon was studied to determine its importance in signal transduction during cell wall morphogenesis. The peptidoglycan compositions of amp mutants were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. When a chromosomal or plasmid-borne copy of ampD was present, the amount of pentapeptide-containing muropeptides in the cell wall increased upon addition of the cell wall constituent diaminopimelic acid to the growth medium. These results suggest that beta-lactamase induction and modulation of the composition of the cell wall share elements of a regulatory circuit that involves AmpD. Escherichia coli requires AmpD to respond to extracellular signaling amino acids, such as diaminopimelic acid, and this signal transduction system may regulate peptidoglycan composition in response to cell wall turnover products."
https://openalex.org/W1524252622,"In mammalian brain, beta-tubulin occurs as a mixture of four isotypes designated as types I, II, III, and IV. It has been speculated in recent years that the different tubulin isotypes may confer functional diversity to microtubules. In an effort to investigate whether different tubulin isotypes differ in their functional properties we have studied the colchicine binding kinetics of bovine brain tubulin upon removal of the beta III isotype. We found that the removal of the beta III isotype alters the binding kinetics from biphasic to monophasic with the disappearance of the slow phase. The kinetics become biphasic with the reappearance of the slow phase when the beta III-depleted tubulin was mixed with the beta III fraction eluted from the affinity column with 0.5 M NaCl. The analysis of the kinetic data reveals that the tubulin dimers containing beta III bind colchicine at an on-rate constant of 35 M-1 s-1 while those lacking beta III bind at 182 M-1 s-1. Our results strongly suggest that the beta-subunit plays a very important role in the interaction of tubulin with colchicine."
https://openalex.org/W1509109977,"The specific activity of carbons 1 and 2 of plasma acetoacetate has been used as a measure of the specific activity of liver mitochondrial acetyl-CoA in tracer studies. To test whether or not acetoacetate actually reflects acetyl-CoA, livers were perfused with a mixture of substrates that are converted to mitochondrial acetyl-CoA: 1 mM lactate, 0.2 mM pyruvate, 0.2 mM acetate, and, where indicated, 0.2 mM octanoate or 0.2 mM alpha-ketoisocaproate. In each experiment, one of these substrates was 13C-labeled. Labeling of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA was assessed by three methods: (i) molar percent enrichment of total tissue acetyl-CoA; (ii) molar percent enrichment of carbons 4 and 5 of tissue citrate, the precursor of which is acetyl-CoA; and (iii) molar percent enrichment of carbons 1 and 2 of perfusate ketone bodies. Nonhomogeneous labeling of liver mitochondrial acetyl-CoA occurred under most conditions, i.e. the enrichments of carbons 4 and 5 of citrate were different from enrichments of carbons 1 and 2 of ketone bodies. Thus, based upon our results obtained in perfused livers, we question the validity of measuring the labeling of carbons 1 and 2 of acetoacetate as a noninvasive probe of liver mitochondrial acetyl-CoA."

https://openalex.org/W2049850623,"We have examined changes in single-channel behavior that result from conservative amino acid substitutions at the Cys230 residue in the putative first transmembrane region (M1) of the murine nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Mutations made in the gamma subunit altered the energy barrier for a single closing rate constant in proportion to the size of the substituted side chain. One of these substitutions, when made in the alpha subunits, had no effect on gating. No mutations altered permeation. We conclude that the region surrounding the M1 Cys is involved in the gating of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and that the gamma subunit contributes significantly to the control of channel closure."

To control the growth of this primary neoplasia, virus-inoculated mice were treated with anti-neoplastic drugs. Paradoxically, cyclophosphamide, which is also immunosuppressive, was very effective in preventing the appearance and progression of the disease, in restoring a normal T cell function, and in depleting the number of infected target cells. This result suggests that the proliferating infected target cells were responsible for the immunodeficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1577284702,"Polypeptide synthesis using either phenylalanine or lysine was initiated on Escherichia coli ribosomes; then the position and conformation of the nascent peptide were monitored by fluorescence techniques. To this end, fluorophores had been attached to the amino terminus of each nascent peptide, and major differences were observed as chain extension occurred. Polyphenylalanine appeared to build up as a hydrophobic mass adjacent to the peptidyl transferase center while polylysine apparently was extended directly from the ribosome into the surrounding solution. An explanation for these differences may be provided by the physical and chemical properties of each polypeptide. These properties may be responsible for the route by which each peptide exits the peptidyl transferase center as demonstrated by the different sensitivity of each to inhibition by erythromycin."
https://openalex.org/W1987597415,"We have tested whether gap junctions form between nerve and muscle during their initial contact, before establishing the chemical synapse. Embryonic Xenopus stage 18-20 myotomes and neural tubes were permeabilized with DMSO to load appropriate reagents, dissociated, and cocultured. When myotomes, loaded with Lucifer yellow, were cocultured with unlabeled neural tube cells, 23% of the neurons contained dye after 24 hr. Affinity-purified gap junction antibodies loaded into myocytes or neurons reduced neuronal labeling significantly to 5%. [3H]uridine nucleotide transfer was observed in both directions between myocytes and neurons. Again gap junction antibodies substantially reduced recipient label. In all cases preimmune IgGs did not reduce transfer. When acetylcholine receptor clustering was examined in cultures containing gap junction antibodies, no difference in the number of neuronally induced AChR clusters was observed. This suggests that the cluster-inducing signal between nerve and muscle does not pass through gap junctions."
https://openalex.org/W1550015778,"In order to understand the unusual heat resistance of LamB protein (the outer membrane component of the maltose transport system in Escherichia coli and its receptor for bacteriophage lambda), we investigated the role of its 2 cysteinyl residues. Our studies show that Cys22 and Cys38 form an intrasubunit disulfide bond which contributes to the heat stability of the LamB protein trimer. Physical evidence for the disulfide was obtained by using site-directed mutagenesis to convert Asn36 to Met, which allowed cyanogen bromide cleavage between the 2 cysteines. Upon reduction one of the N36M fragments migrated as two pieces, resolved by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Other mutagenized LamB proteins, in which 1 or both Cys residues were converted to Ser, exhibited a sharp loss of thermal stability. In contrast to wild-type LamB protein trimer, which does not dissociate to monomers even after 60 min at 100 degrees C, only 10-15% of the mutant LamB proteins remain trimeric after boiling 10 min. The disulfide bond in LamB protein is not required for its transport function, since both mutagenized LamB protein and N-ethylmaleimide-labeled LamB protein exhibit normal uptake of sugars in proteoliposomes. Finally, the disulfide bond must not be between subunits of the LamB trimer since reversible dissociation of trimer is achieved by low pH or denaturants in the absence of reducing agent."
https://openalex.org/W1644374012,"The growth factor interleukin 2 (IL2) binds to and is internalized together with high-affinity surface receptors present on lymphoid cells. This endocytosis thus results in down-regulation of the receptors. However, it is not known if the internalization is relevant to the induction of cell growth. In the present study a rat monoclonal antibody to the P55 chain of the IL2 receptor was used to examine the role of receptor internalization in the IL2-dependent autocrine human tumor T cell line IARC 301. When given alone, this antibody did not inhibit IL2 binding, internalization, or IL2-dependent cell proliferation. However, crosslinking by anti-rat immunoglobulins, which did not affect binding of the growth factor, inhibited both IL2 internalization and cell proliferation. Besides offering a novel means for the specific inhibition of the uptake of IL2 bound to IL2 high-affinity receptors, the results are compatible with the association of this receptor-ligand uptake to the growth stimulation by IL2."
https://openalex.org/W1512756977,"Forty-one aromatic and aliphatic analogs of alpha-ketoglutarate were studied kinetically for their interaction with the alpha-ketoglutarate binding site of gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase obtained from Pseudomonas sp. AK1. Together, the compounds represent structural permutations probing the contribution of: 1) the C5 carboxyl group of alpha-ketoglutarate (domain I); 2) the C1-C2 keto acid moiety of alpha-ketoglutarate (domain II); 3) the distance between domains I and II; and 4) the spatial relationship of the two domains required for optimal interaction with the cosubstrate binding site. All compounds were competitive inhibitors for alpha-ketoglutarate (Km 0.018 mM). Functionally, two subsites of the cosubstrate binding site were evident: subsite I for polar interaction with the C5 carboxyl group, and subsite II, comprising of two distinct cis-oriented coordination sites of the catalytic ferrous ion which interact with the C1-C2 keto acid moiety. The most efficient inhibitors were pyridine 2,4-dicarboxylate (Ki 0.0002 mM) and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (Ki 0.0006 mM). Both compounds contain a carboxyl group and a chelating moiety corresponding to domains I and II of alpha-ketoglutarate, respectively. The fixed orientation of these groups in both analogs was used to assess intersubsite distance and spatial relationship required for optimal interaction with the cosubstrate binding site. Binding at subsite I and chelation at subsite II were indispensible for effective competitive inhibition. The distance between these two domains also helped determine whether attachment at the cosubstrate binding site would be catalytically productive. This was emphasized by the failure of either oxaloacetate or alpha-ketoadipinate to promote hydroxylation. Optimal interdomain distance, however, was not sufficient for cosubstrate utilization, as pyridine 2,4-dicarboxylate, with an interdomain distance identical to alpha-ketoglutarate in its staggered conformation, did not sustain hydroxylation. In the overall, these studies suggest that alpha-ketoglutarate utilization occurs in a ligand reaction at the active site ferrous ion of gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase. This is of particular interest since the delineated stereochemical mode of oxidative decarboxylation could generate the reactive oxo-iron species that was shown experimentally to promote gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylation by an abstraction-recombination mechanism (Blanchard, J. S., and Englard, S. (1983) Biochemistry 22, 5922-5928; Englard, S., Blanchard, J. S., and Midelfort, C. F. (1985) Biochemistry 24, 1110-1116)."
https://openalex.org/W1516175917,"Amino acid substitutions were made in the heat-labile enterotoxin signal sequence of Escherichia coli by recombinant DNA techniques, and their influence on the secretion of recombinant human epidermal growth factor by E. coli was examined. The heat-labile enterotoxin signal sequence is an amino-terminal extension of the octadecapeptide chain and is comprised of three distinct regions: a positively charged amino-terminal region, a central hydrophobic region, and a carboxyl-terminal region with the cleavage site recognized by the signal peptidase. Some alterations in the signal sequence caused a 1.5-3.5-fold increase in the secretion of recombinant human epidermal growth factor. These were the introduction of: (i) polar and small residues into the carboxyl-terminal region (replacement of Pro-1 Leu-3 with Asn-Ala or Ser-Ala), which may give a favorable structure for the recognition and cleavage by the signal peptidase; and (ii) a polar residue into the central hydrophobic region (replacement of Ile-9 with Ser), which may cause an increase of the affinity to the cytoplasmic membrane. In the latter case, a large amount of the unprocessed ""precursor"" was accumulated. The combination of these modifications, however, did not work additively. An increase in the amino-terminal positive charge (insertion of Lys) had no effect on secretion. These results prove that the level of protein secretion is greatly dependent on the polarity of the carboxyl-terminal region and the hydrophobicity and/or the amphiphilicity of the central region. Moreover, the overall balance of the physicochemical properties of respective regions is important."
https://openalex.org/W1482662923,"The conformational stability and flexibility of insulin containing a cross-link between the alpha-amino group of the A-chain to the epsilon-amino group of Lys29 of the B-chain was examined. The cross-link varied in length from 2 to 12 carbon atoms. The conformational stability was determined by guanidine hydrochloride-induced equilibrium denaturation and flexibility was assessed by H2O/D2O amide exchange. The cross-link has substantial effects on both conformational stability and flexibility which depend on its length. In general, the addition of a cross-link enhances conformational stability and decreases flexibility. The optimal length for enhanced stability and decreased flexibility was the 6-carbon link. For the 6-carbon link the Gibbs free energy of unfolding was 8.0 kcal/mol compared to 4.5 kcal/mol for insulin, and the amide exchange rate decreased by at least 3-fold. A very short cross-link (i.e. the 2-carbon link) caused conformational strain that was detectable by a lack of stabilization in the Gibbs free energy of unfolding and enhancement in the amide exchange rate compared to insulin. The effect of the cross-link length on insulin hydrodynamic properties is discussed relative to previously obtained receptor binding results."
https://openalex.org/W1497461233,"Abstract Certain features of linker histone behavior were analyzed using a precipitation and a nitrocellulose filter binding assay. Chromatosomes, depleted of the linker histones, present one unique binding site to the globular domain of histone H5 (GH5) which involves the two 10-base pair DNA ends of the chromatosome. Additional binding to lower affinity sites is intrinsically different and results in aggregation as does all binding to core particles. These findings, as well as the binding study on a synthetic DNA decamer, lend support to earlier hypotheses of more than one DNA binding site on the globular domain. Our studies provide a deeper insight into the long standing question of H5/nucleosome stoichiometry. A salt dependence analysis of GH5 binding to H5-depleted chromatosomes indicates that GH5 displaces a number of ions similar to the total H1 linker histone, suggesting a delocalized binding of the carboxyl- and amino-terminal tails."
https://openalex.org/W1528737977,"A previous report (Hirose, M., Akuta, T., and Takahashi, N. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 16867-16872) has shown that for the efficient oxidative refolding of disulfide-reduced ovotransferrin, a preincubation under reduced conditions at a low temperature is essential. To study the renaturation pathway, the disulfide-reduced N-terminal half-molecule of ovotransferrin was analyzed by CD spectrum. The reduced protein was found to take, at low temperatures, a partially folded conformation that can be distinguished from both the native and denatured states. The folded protein was in a metastable state with delta GD value of 2.2-2.8 kcal/mol at 6 degrees C. The conformation was variable depending on temperature conditions; its stability was decreased at a lower temperature (1.0-1.2 kcal/mol at 0 degrees C). Subsequent reoxidation at 6 degrees C by oxidized glutathione led efficiently the reduced protein to the correctly renatured form having the iron-binding capacity, indicating that the partially folded state is the immediate precursor to subsequent oxidative refolding."
