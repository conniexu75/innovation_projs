https://openalex.org/W2091984900,"Adriamycin and docetaxel are two agents commonly used in treatment of breast cancer, but their efficacy is often limited by the emergence of chemoresistance. Recent studies indicate that exosomes act as vehicles for exchange of genetic cargo between heterogeneous populations of tumor cells, engendering a transmitted drug resistance for cancer development and progression. However, the specific contribution of breast cancer-derived exosomes is poorly understood. Here we reinforced other's report that human breast cancer cell line MCF-7/S could acquire increased survival potential from its resistant variants MCF-7/Adr and MCF-7/Doc. Additionally, exosomes of the latter, A/exo and D/exo, significantly modulated the cell cycle distribution and drug-induced apoptosis with respect to S/exo. Exosomes pre-treated with RNase were unable to regulate cell cycle and apoptosis resistance, suggesting an RNA-dependent manner. Microarray and polymerase chain reaction for the miRNA expression profiles of A/exo, D/exo, and S/exo demonstrated that they loaded selective miRNA patterns. Following A/exo and D/exo transfer to recipient MCF-7/S, the same miRNAs were significantly increased in acquired cells. Target gene prediction and pathway analysis showed the involvement of miR-100, miR-222, and miR-30a in pathways implicated in cancer pathogenesis, membrane vesiculation and therapy failure. Furthermore, D/exo co-culture assays and miRNA mimics transfection experiments indicated that miR-222-rich D/exo could alter target gene expression in MCF-7/S. Our results suggest that drug-resistant breast cancer cells may spread resistance capacity to sensitive ones by releasing exosomes and that such effects could be partly attributed to the intercellular transfer of specific miRNAs."

As part of a commercial operation, bee colonies are exposed to a variety of agricultural ecosystems throughout the year and a multitude of environmental variables that may affect the microbial balance of individuals and the hive. While many recent studies support the idea of a core microbiota in guts of younger in-hive bees, it is unknown whether this core is present in forager bees or the pollen they carry back to the hive. Additionally, several studies hypothesize that the foregut (crop), a key interface between the pollination environment and hive food stores, contains a set of 13 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) that inoculate collected pollen and act in synergy to preserve pollen stores. Here, we used a combination of 454 based 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the microbial communities of forager guts, crops, and corbicular pollen and crop plate counts to show that (1) despite a very different diet, forager guts contain a core microbiota similar to that found in younger bees, (2) corbicular pollen contains a diverse community dominated by hive-specific, environmental or phyllosphere bacteria that are not prevalent in the gut or crop, and (3) the 13 LAB found in culture-based studies are not specific to the crop but are a small subset of midgut or hindgut specific bacteria identified in many recent 454 amplicon-based studies. The crop is dominated by Lactobacillus kunkeei, and Alpha 2.2 (Acetobacteraceae), highly osmotolerant and acid resistant bacteria found in stored pollen and honey. Crop taxa at low abundance include core hindgut bacteria in transit to their primary niche, and potential pathogens or food spoilage organisms seemingly vectored from the pollination environment. We conclude that the crop microbial environment is influenced by worker task, and may function in both decontamination and inoculation."
https://openalex.org/W2046998346,"Moving to music is an essential human pleasure particularly related to musical groove. Structurally, music associated with groove is often characterised by rhythmic complexity in the form of syncopation, frequently observed in musical styles such as funk, hip-hop and electronic dance music. Structural complexity has been related to positive affect in music more broadly, but the function of syncopation in eliciting pleasure and body-movement in groove is unknown. Here we report results from a web-based survey which investigated the relationship between syncopation and ratings of wanting to move and experienced pleasure. Participants heard funk drum-breaks with varying degrees of syncopation and audio entropy, and rated the extent to which the drum-breaks made them want to move and how much pleasure they experienced. While entropy was found to be a poor predictor of wanting to move and pleasure, the results showed that medium degrees of syncopation elicited the most desire to move and the most pleasure, particularly for participants who enjoy dancing to music. Hence, there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between syncopation, body-movement and pleasure, and syncopation seems to be an important structural factor in embodied and affective responses to groove."

X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA, Kennedy’s disease) is an inherited neuromuscular disorder characterized by adult onset proximal muscle weakness due to lower motor neuron degeneration. SBMA patients also display signs of androgen insensitivity, including gynecomastia, reduced fertility, and testicular atrophy (Katsuno et al., 2012Katsuno M. Tanaka F. Adachi H. Banno H. Suzuki K. Watanabe H. Sobue G. Pathogenesis and therapy of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA).Prog. Neurobiol. 2012; 99: 246-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This finding, together with the X-linked inheritance, led to analysis of the androgen receptor (AR) gene as the potential cause of SBMA. While a CAG repeat in the first exon of the AR gene varies in length from 5–34 triplets in normal individuals, SBMA patients were found to harbor repeats ranging from 37–66 CAG repeats (La Spada et al., 1991La Spada A.R. Wilson E.M. Lubahn D.B. Harding A.E. Fischbeck K.H. Androgen receptor gene mutations in X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.Nature. 1991; 352: 77-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (2412) Google Scholar). As CAG encodes the amino acid glutamine (Q), SBMA was the first disorder identified to result from expansion of a CAG-polyQ repeat tract. Eight other inherited neurodegenerative disorders were subsequently found to be caused by expanded CAG repeats; hence, in addition to SBMA, the CAG-polyQ repeat disease category includes Huntington’s disease (HD), dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), and six forms of spinocerebellar ataxia: SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, and SCA17 (La Spada and Taylor, 2010La Spada A.R. Taylor J.P. Repeat expansion disease: progress and puzzles in disease pathogenesis.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). For decades, research into the basis of neurological disease focused upon the contribution of neuronal dysfunction to disease pathogenesis. However, over the last 15 years, there has been a growing appreciation of the importance of nonneuronal cells in maintaining neuron function and contributing to neurological disease pathogenesis (Garden and La Spada, 2012Garden G.A. La Spada A.R. Intercellular (mis)communication in neurodegenerative disease.Neuron. 2012; 73: 886-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the inability to recapitulate SOD1 neurotoxicity in transgenic mice upon expression of mutant SOD1 in motor neurons argued against cell autonomous degeneration (Lino et al., 2002Lino M.M. Schneider C. Caroni P. Accumulation of SOD1 mutants in postnatal motoneurons does not cause motoneuron pathology or motoneuron disease.J.

Neuron-specific expression of mutant superoxide dismutase 1 in transgenic mice does not lead to motor impairment.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3369-3374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chimeric expression of mutant and normal SOD1 in the spinal cords of mice demonstrated a role for nonneuronal cells in ALS motor neuron degeneration and revealed that astrocytes and microglia are key determinants of disease onset and disease progression (Clement et al., 2003Clement A.M. Nguyen M.D. Roberts E.A. Garcia M.L. Boillée S. Rule M. McMahon A.P. Doucette W. Siwek D. Ferrante R.J. et al.Wild-type nonneuronal cells extend survival of SOD1 mutant motor neurons in ALS mice.Science. 2003; 302: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Subsequently, conditional gene silencing of the ubiquitously expressed SOD1 mutant within astrocytes and microglia indicated that mutant SOD1 within either glial cell type is a key determinant of disease progression (Boillée et al., 2006Boillée S. Yamanaka K. Lobsiger C.S. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Kassiotis G. Kollias G. Cleveland D.W.

Neurosci. 2008; 11: 251-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar), while similar mutant gene silencing in NG2+ precursor cells of oligodendrocytes is a key contributor to disease onset (Kang et al., 2013Kang S.H. Li Y. Fukaya M. Lorenzini I. Cleveland D.W. Ostrow L.W. Rothstein J.D. Bergles D.E. Degeneration and impaired regeneration of gray matter oligodendrocytes in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). In the CAG-polyQ repeat disease field, careful study of a line of SCA7 transgenic mice revealed that Purkinje cell neurodegeneration occurred even when the polyQ-ataxin-7 transgene was not expressed in Purkinje cells, leading to a hypothesis of noncell autonomous SCA7 neurodegeneration (Garden et al., 2002Garden G.A. Libby R.T. Fu Y.H. Kinoshita Y. Huang J. Possin D.E. Smith A.C. Martinez R.A. Fine G.C. Grote S.K. et al.Polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-7 promotes non-cell-autonomous Purkinje cell degeneration and displays proteolytic cleavage in ataxic transgenic mice.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4897-4905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As Purkinje cell neurons are intimately associated with a specialized astroglial cell type known as the Bergmann glia, SCA7 transgenic mice were engineered to express mutant ataxin-7 in only Bergmann glial cells in the cerebellum. These animals developed cerebellar ataxia and Purkinje cell degeneration, demonstrating the noncell autonomous nature of polyQ neurodegeneration (Custer et al., 2006Custer S.K. Garden G.A. Gill N. Rueb U. Libby R.T. Schultz C. Guyenet S.J. Deller T. Westrum L.E. Sopher B.L. La Spada A.R. Bergmann glia expression of polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-7 produces neurodegeneration by impairing glutamate transport.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1302-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Studies in HD and in Parkinson’s disease mouse models have similarly shown that expression of mutant disease protein in one cell type is capable of producing dysfunction and demise of a different neuronal cell type, especially for cells in direct communication with one another (reviewed in Ilieva et al., 2009Ilieva H. Polymenidou M. Cleveland D.W. Non-cell autonomous toxicity in neurodegenerative disorders: ALS and beyond.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 187: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). All of this preceding work suggests an overarching theme in neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis: preferential degeneration of select neuron populations does not necessarily stem from intrinsic molecular pathology restricted to the neuron subtype of interest (i.e., cell autonomous toxicity), but rather often results from pathological processes occurring in one or more neighboring cell types that perform crucial functions upon which the exquisitely vulnerable neuron subtype stalwartly depends (i.e., noncell autonomous toxicity). Skeletal muscle is a major source of trophic support for innervating motor neurons and has been shown to contribute not only to neuron survival during development, but also to synaptic activity and axonal function (Funakoshi et al., 1995Funakoshi H. Belluardo N. Arenas E. Yamamoto Y. Casabona A. Persson H. Ibáñez C.F. Muscle-derived neurotrophin-4 as an activity-dependent trophic signal for adult motor neurons.Science. 1995; 268: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). SBMA patients often exhibit features of myopathy, as progressive muscle weakness occurs in the context of elevated serum creatine kinase levels (Katsuno et al., 2012Katsuno M. Tanaka F. Adachi H. Banno H. Suzuki K. Watanabe H. Sobue G. Pathogenesis and therapy of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA).Prog. Neurobiol. 2012; 99: 246-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Muscle biopsies of SBMA patients reveal mixed pathological findings, with both myopathy and neurogenic atrophy features (Sorarù et al., 2008Sorarù G. D’Ascenzo C. Polo A. Palmieri A. Baggio L. Vergani L. Gellera C. Moretto G. Pegoraro E. Angelini C. Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy: skeletal muscle pathology in male patients and heterozygous females.J. Neurol. Sci. 2008; 264: 100-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Knockin mice expressing AR with 113 glutamines (AR113Q) develop early myopathy findings with little or no significant motor neuron loss until late in their disease course (Yu et al., 2006Yu Z. Dadgar N. Albertelli M. Gruis K. Jordan C. Robins D.M. Lieberman A.P. Androgen-dependent pathology demonstrates myopathic contribution to the Kennedy disease phenotype in a mouse knock-in model.J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 2663-2672Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), consistent with muscle as a key site for SBMA disease pathogenesis. Moreover, while widespread transgenic expression of human AR20Q at levels comparable to endogenous AR does not produce a neuromuscular phenotype (Sopher et al., 2004Sopher B.L. Thomas Jr., P.S. LaFevre-Bernt M.A. Holm I.E. Wilke S.A. Ware C.B. Jin L.W. Libby R.T. Ellerby L.M. La Spada A.R. Androgen receptor YAC transgenic mice recapitulate SBMA motor neuronopathy and implicate VEGF164 in the motor neuron degeneration.Neuron. 2004; 41: 687-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), skeletal muscle-specific overexpression of wild-type AR (AR22Q) in mice is sufficient to produce SBMA-like neuromuscular disease, accompanied by denervation of target muscle and motor neuron axon degeneration, complete with androgen dependence, gender bias, axonopathy, and muscle wasting (Monks et al., 2007Monks D.A. Johansen J.A. Mo K. Rao P. Eagleson B. Yu Z. Lieberman A.P. Breedlove S.M. Jordan C.L. Overexpression of wild-type androgen receptor in muscle recapitulates polyglutamine disease.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 18259-18264Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Additionally, testosterone treatment of asymptomatic female transgenic mice overexpressing the AR22Q transgene in muscle yielded pronounced neuromuscular deficits, but without detectable motor neuron pathology (Johansen et al., 2009Johansen J.A. Yu Z. Mo K. Monks D.A. Lieberman A.P. Breedlove S.M. Jordan C.L. Recovery of function in a myogenic mouse model of spinal bulbar muscular atrophy.Neurobiol. Dis. 2009; 34: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although development of SBMA-like disease phenotypes upon skeletal-muscle-specific expression of AR22Q may simply stem from the very high level of AR transgene overexpression in this model (Monks et al., 2007Monks D.A. Johansen J.A. Mo K. Rao P. Eagleson B. Yu Z. Lieberman A.P. Breedlove S.M. Jordan C.L. Overexpression of wild-type androgen receptor in muscle recapitulates polyglutamine disease.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 18259-18264Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), the SBMA-like phenotype in males can be reversed upon cessation of testosterone treatment. These findings indicate that muscle-restricted AR toxicity may underlie SBMA disease pathogenesis, and therapies targeting skeletal muscle may prove beneficial for patients. In support of this thesis, transgenic expression of anabolic insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) directed to muscle can rescue nerve pathology in SBMA transgenic mice, producing a significant extension in lifespan (Palazzolo et al., 2009Palazzolo I. Stack C. Kong L. Musaro A. Adachi H. Katsuno M. Sobue G. Taylor J.P. Sumner C.J. Fischbeck K.H. Pennuto M. Overexpression of IGF-1 in muscle attenuates disease in a mouse model of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.Neuron. 2009; 63: 316-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Although the preceding studies suggest a role for muscle dysfunction as a component of SBMA motor neuronopathy, the necessity of polyQ-AR expression in muscle for SBMA disease pathogenesis is yet to be investigated. To directly examine the role of muscle expression of AR in SBMA pathogenesis, we developed a BAC transgenic mouse model featuring a floxed first exon to permit cell-type-specific excision of the human AR gene. We engineered the human AR transgene to carry 121 CAG repeats (BAC fxAR121) and found that BAC fxAR121 mice develop a gender-restricted, progressive neuromuscular phenotype, characterized by weight loss, motor deficits, muscle atrophy, myopathy, and shortened lifespan. By conditionally terminating expression of mutant polyQ-AR in the skeletal muscles of BAC fxAR121 male mice, we document a crucial role for muscle expression of mutant polyQ-AR in SBMA disease pathogenesis and predict that muscle-directed therapies hold great promise as definitive treatments for SBMA motor neuron degeneration. The human AR gene is composed of eight exons that span ∼180 kb of DNA. Using the Human Genome Browser Gateway (http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway), we identified two overlapping BACs that span the entire length of the AR gene. Through a recombineering strategy, we fused these two BACs to create an AR BAC construct that, in addition to all eight AR exons, includes ∼50 kb of DNA 5′ to the first AR exon and ∼30 kb of DNA 3′ to the last AR exon (Sopher and La Spada, 2006Sopher B.L. La Spada A.R. Efficient recombination-based methods for bacterial artificial chromosome fusion and mutagenesis.Gene. 2006; 371: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). With this recombineering approach, we also introduced a 121 CAG repeat tract and engineered two loxP sites flanking AR exon 1 to create a floxed AR CAG121 BAC (BAC fxAR121) transgenic construct (Figure 1A). We then derived BAC fxAR121 transgenic mice, and when we performed RT-PCR analysis of human AR (hAR) transgene expression, we determined that hAR RNA expression levels in the cortex, spinal cord, and muscle of BAC fxAR121 mice are comparable to endogenous mouse AR (mAR) RNA expression levels and to hAR RNA expression levels in AR YAC CAG100 (YAC AR100) mice (Figure 1B). We measured protein expression in brain and spinal cord and similarly found that hAR protein levels in the CNS of the BAC fxAR121 mice are comparable to mAR endogenous protein levels (Figure 1C) and to YAC AR100 transgene expression levels (Figure S1 available online). These are encouraging results, as YAC AR100 mice develop a highly representative SBMA motor neuronopathy (Sopher et al., 2004Sopher B.L. Thomas Jr., P.S. LaFevre-Bernt M.A. Holm I.E. Wilke S.A. Ware C.B. Jin L.W. Libby R.T. Ellerby L.M. La Spada A.R. Androgen receptor YAC transgenic mice recapitulate SBMA motor neuronopathy and implicate VEGF164 in the motor neuron degeneration.Neuron. 2004; 41: 687-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We then inspected the BAC fxAR121 transgenic mice for visible phenotypes and behavioral impairments. Beginning at 12 weeks of age, we observed a significant decrease in the weight of male BAC fxAR121 mice, and this weight loss phenotype steadily progressed as the mice aged (Figure 2A). By the time of significant weight loss, BAC fxAR121 mice exhibited onset of a motor phenotype characterized by weakness, as 13-week-old male BAC fxAR121 mice displayed significantly reduced grip strength (Figure 2B). With disease progression, male BAC fxAR121 mice also exhibited gait abnormalities, based upon impaired performance on stride length testing (Figure 2C). Muscle sections from male BAC fxAR121 mice contained AR protein aggregates (Figure 2D), and NADH staining of such muscle sections revealed muscle fiber atrophy (Figure S2A), consistent with an ongoing process of muscle atrophy due to AR polyQ neurotoxicity, as previously reported in the YAC AR100 mice (Sopher et al., 2004Sopher B.L. Thomas Jr., P.S. LaFevre-Bernt M.A. Holm I.E. Wilke S.A. Ware C.B. Jin L.W. Libby R.T. Ellerby L.M. La Spada A.R. Androgen receptor YAC transgenic mice recapitulate SBMA motor neuronopathy and implicate VEGF164 in the motor neuron degeneration.Neuron. 2004; 41: 687-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). When we examined ventral horn neurons from lumbar spinal cord sections, we did not observe any changes in motor neuron numbers between male BAC fxAR121 mice and nontransgenic littermate controls (Figure S2B), but noted that ventral horn neurons from BAC fxAR121 mice appear smaller than ventral horn neurons in nontransgenic littermate controls (Figure 2E). We therefore measured ventral horn neuron soma size and perimeter in lumbar spinal cord sections and documented marked reductions in neuron soma area and perimeter in BAC fxAR121 mice (Figures 2F and 2G). Although BAC fxAR121 mice develop neuromuscular disease phenotypes reminiscent of YAC AR100 mice (Sopher et al., 2004Sopher B.L. Thomas Jr., P.S. LaFevre-Bernt M.A. Holm I.E. Wilke S.A. Ware C.B. Jin L.W. Libby R.T. Ellerby L.M. La Spada A.R. Androgen receptor YAC transgenic mice recapitulate SBMA motor neuronopathy and implicate VEGF164 in the motor neuron degeneration.Neuron. 2004; 41: 687-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), the disease phenotype in BAC fxAR121 is more progressive than in the YAC AR100 model, as lifespan was dramatically shortened in male BAC fxAR121 mice (Figure 2H). While male BAC fxAR121 mice display prominent neuromuscular disease and premature death, female BAC fxAR121 mice appear phenotypically normal on behavioral testing and do not suffer weight loss or reduced survival (Figures S2C and S2D). To confirm that efficient in vivo excision of the first exon of the hAR gene and corresponding inactivation of hAR gene expression in BAC fxAR121 mice were feasible, we crossed BAC fxAR121 mice with CMV-Cre transgenic mice. In the resulting BAC fxAR121-CMV-Cre bigenic progeny, excision of transgenic hAR exon 1, which includes the translational start site, should occur in all tissues, yielding inactivation of mutant hAR expression and prevention of neuromuscular disease. RT-PCR analysis confirmed that BAC fxAR121-CMV-Cre bigenic mice display markedly reduced hAR RNA expression levels in brain and muscle (Figure 3A). Furthermore, immunoblot analysis yielded no detectable hAR protein in brain or spinal cord protein lysates isolated from BAC fxAR121-CMV-Cre bigenic mice (Figure 3B), confirming high-level excision of hAR exon 1 and corresponding inactivation of hAR transgene expression. Phenotype analysis of BAC fxAR121-CMV-Cre bigenic mice indicated normal weight gain, grip strength, and lifespan (Figures 3C–3E), thereby validating the utility of the floxed first hAR exon as a target for Cre-mediated excision and hAR transgene inactivation. To evaluate the contribution of polyQ-AR muscle expression to SBMA disease phenotypes, we obtained mice carrying the Cre-recombinase gene placed under the control of the Human Skeletal Actin (HSA) promoter (Brennan and Hardeman, 1993Brennan K.J. Hardeman E.C. Quantitative analysis of the human alpha-skeletal actin gene in transgenic mice.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 719-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HSA-Cre mice are known to direct efficient Cre-mediated excision of floxed transgenes in the skeletal muscle lineage only, with no ectopic Cre-excision in the spinal cord or in other CNS regions (Miniou et al., 1999Miniou P. Tiziano D. Frugier T. Roblot N. Le Meur M. Melki J. Gene targeting restricted to mouse striated muscle lineage.Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: e27Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). After crossing BAC fxAR121 mice with HSA-Cre mice, we obtained cohorts of mice with the following genotypes: BAC fxAR121-HSA-Cre bigenic mice, BAC fxAR121 singly transgenic mice, HSA-Cre singly transgenic mice, and nontransgenic mice. RT-PCR analysis of RNAs isolated from quadriceps muscle obtained from the various progeny of this cross revealed marked reductions in the level of hAR transgene expression in BAC fxAR121-HSA-Cre bigenic mice in comparison to BAC fxAR121 singly transgenic mice (Figure 4A). Immunoblot analysis corroborated the RNA expression data, as we observed minimal amounts of hAR121Q protein in muscle samples obtained from BAC fxAR121-HSA-Cre bigenic mice (Figures 4B and 4C). AR immunostaining of quadriceps muscle sections independently confirmed a dramatic reduction in AR protein aggregates in BAC fxAR121-HSA-Cre mice (Figure 4D). To assure the specificity of muscle excision by the HSA-Cre driver, we obtained RNA and protein lysates from spinal cord and noted that hAR transgene RNA expression levels and hAR121Q protein levels are similar in the CNS of BAC fxAR121-HSA-Cre mice and BAC fxAR121 singly transgenic mice (Figures 4E–4G). These results confirmed muscle-restricted excision of the hAR transgene in BAC fxAR121-HSA-Cre bigenic mice, indicating that BAC fxAR121-HSA-Cre mice can be used to assess the role of muscle expression of polyQ-AR in SBMA neuromuscular disease and cellular pathology. Furthermore, Cre recombinase expression in skeletal muscle and the accompanying marked reduction of hAR transgene expression in BAC fxAR121-HSA-Cre mice did not alter expression of endogenous mouse AR in the muscle, brain, or spinal cord of BAC fxAR121-HSA-Cre bigenic mice (Figure S3). To determine the role of polyQ-AR muscle expression in SBMA disease pathogenesis, we performed a thorough phenotyping analysis on BAC fxAR121-HSA-Cre bigenic mice, BAC fxAR121 singly transgenic mice, and nontransgenic controls. Elimination of AR expression in muscle prevented weight loss in BAC fxAR121-HSA-Cre bigenic mice (Figure 5A). We also documented normal motor phenotypes in BAC fxAR121-HSA-Cre mice, as BAC fxAR121-HSA-Cre mice displayed significantly improved grip strength, gait performance, and front limb stride length, in comparison to singly transgenic BAC fxAR121 mice (Figures 5B–5D). Indeed, for all tested measures, BAC fxAR121-HSA-Cre bigenic mice performed comparably to nontransgenic controls. Lastly, although BAC fxAR121 mice had reduced survival, there was not a single instance of premature death in the BAC fxAR121-HSA-Cre cohort (Figure 5E). Indeed, all BAC fxAR121-HSA-Cre mice were still alive beyond 16 months of age, without visible phenotypes or evidence of muscle weakness. After completing behavioral paradigms for testing motor function, we considered the role of muscle expression of polyQ-AR protein in SBMA-associated neuromuscular disease pathology. Staining of muscle sections with hematoxylin and eosin revealed marked muscle fiber atrophy and increased connective tissue in BAC fxAR121 mice compared to age-matched controls, and NADH staining demonstrated considerable areas of muscle fiber atrophy in BAC fxAR121 mice (Figure 6A). Evidence of neuromuscular pathology in BAC fxAR121-HSA-Cre bigenic mice, however, was minimal and limited (Figure 6A), consistent with a predominant role for polyQ-AR muscle expression in SBMA neuromuscular disease. To further characterize the extent of motor neuronopathy in the BAC fxAR121 mice and the role of polyQ-AR muscle expression in the production of this phenotype, we compared ventral horn regions of lumbar spinal cord sections obtained from BAC fxAR121 mice, BAC fxAR121-HSA-Cre mice, and nontransgenic littermate controls. We noted that ventral horn neurons from BAC fxAR121 mice are reduced in size, but that ventral horn neurons in BAC fxAR121-HSA-Cre mice appear comparable to controls (Figure 6B). Quantification of ventral horn neuron soma size and perimeter indicated that excision of mutant AR transgene expression in skeletal muscle was sufficient to completely rescue this motor neuron degeneration phenotype in BAC fxAR121-HSA-Cre mice (Figure 6C). RT-PCR analysis and immunoblot analysis of BAC fxAR121-HSA-Cre brain RNA and protein samples confirmed that skeletal muscle excision of hAR transgene expression in BAC fxAR121 mice does not reduce the level of hAR transgene expression in the brain (Figures S4A and S4B), as expected. Moreover, despite rescuing spinal cord neurodegeneration, excision of hAR transgene expression in muscle did not result in an appreciable reduction in AR nuclear inclusion formation in frontal cortex neurons of BAC fxAR121-HSA-Cre mice (Figure 6D), and immunoblot analysis of brain protein lysates from BAC fxAR121-HSA-Cre mice corroborated this finding, as insoluble, aggregated AR protein persists in brain samples from BAC fxAR121-HSA-Cre mice (Figure S4C). To further evaluate the effect of skeletal muscle expression of mutant AR protein on SBMA motor neuron disease, we generated sections of spinal cord motor axons from the L5 root and observed excessive spacing of axons in spinal cord sections from end-stage BAC fxAR121 mice (Figure 7A). This aberrant spacing phenotype was absent from L5 root spinal cord motor axons in littermate BAC fxAR121-HSA-Cre bigenic mice (Figure 7A). When we measured axon diameters in L5 motor roots and counted axon numbers based upon diameter, we noted that BAC fxAR121 mice exhibit a shift toward smaller-sized axons, but that BAC fxAR121-HSA-Cre mice retain a distribution of motor axons that is not shifted toward smaller-sized axons and thus resemble nontransgenic controls (Figure 7B). Indeed, we documented a significant decrease in the number of large caliber axons (i.e., >9 μm in diameter) in the BAC fxAR121 mice and found that such large caliber axons were not reduced in L5 roots from BAC fxAR121-HSA-Cre mice (Figure 7C), confirming that skeletal muscle excision of hAR transgene expression can prevent this SBMA motor neuronopathy phenotype in AR BAC transgenic mice. Importantly, evaluation of L5 motor roots from younger BAC fxAR121 mice, BAC fxAR121-HSA-Cre mice, and nontransgenic controls revealed comparable numbers of motor axons and roughly equivalent numbers of large caliber axons prior to the onset of motor neuronopathy (Figures S5A and S5B), ruling out developmental variation in motor axon size selection as the basis for differences in large caliber axon numbers in older mice. Motor neuron diseases comprise a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive degeneration of motor neurons, accompanied by muscle weakness and wasting. Despite decades of research, the mechanistic basis of the observed motor neuron loss remains enigmatic. Although motor neuron demise is the cardinal feature of motor neuron disorders, recent investigations into the cellular basis of disease pathogenesis in ALS and autosomal recessive spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) indicate that the pathogenic cascade is not restricted to an intrinsic pathological process playing out in the motor neuron (Bricceno et al., 2012Bricceno K.V.

https://openalex.org/W2019532456,"Marine protected areas (MPAs) were acknowledged globally as effective tools to mitigate the threats to oceans caused by fishing. Several studies assessed the effectiveness of individual MPAs in protecting fish assemblages, but regional assessments of multiple MPAs are scarce. Moreover, empirical evidence on the role of MPAs in contrasting the propagation of non-indigenous-species (NIS) and thermophilic species (ThS) is missing. We simultaneously investigated here the role of MPAs in reversing the effects of overfishing and in limiting the spread of NIS and ThS. The Mediterranean Sea was selected as study area as it is a region where 1) MPAs are numerous, 2) fishing has affected species and ecosystems, and 3) the arrival of NIS and the northward expansion of ThS took place. Fish surveys were done in well-enforced no-take MPAs (HP), partially-protected MPAs (IP) and fished areas (F) at 30 locations across the Mediterranean. Significantly higher fish biomass was found in HP compared to IP MPAs and F. Along a recovery trajectory from F to HP MPAs, IP were similar to F, showing that just well enforced MPAs triggers an effective recovery. Within HP MPAs, trophic structure of fish assemblages resembled a top-heavy biomass pyramid. Although the functional structure of fish assemblages was consistent among HP MPAs, species driving the recovery in HP MPAs differed among locations: this suggests that the recovery trajectories in HP MPAs are likely to be functionally similar (i.e., represented by predictable changes in trophic groups, especially fish predators), but the specific composition of the resulting assemblages may depend on local conditions. Our study did not show any effect of MPAs on NIS and ThS. These results may help provide more robust expectations, at proper regional scale, about the effects of new MPAs that may be established in the Mediterranean Sea and other ecoregions worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W1964752285,"In East Africa, honey bees (Apis mellifera) provide critical pollination services and income for small-holder farmers and rural families. While honey bee populations in North America and Europe are in decline, little is known about the status of honey bee populations in Africa. We initiated a nationwide survey encompassing 24 locations across Kenya in 2010 to evaluate the numbers and sizes of honey bee colonies, assess the presence of parasites (Varroa mites and Nosema microsporidia) and viruses, identify and quantify pesticide contaminants in hives, and assay for levels of hygienic behavior. Varroa mites were present throughout Kenya, except in the remote north. Levels of Varroa were positively correlated with elevation, suggesting that environmental factors may play a role in honey bee host-parasite interactions. Levels of Varroa were negatively correlated with levels of hygienic behavior: however, while Varroa infestation dramatically reduces honey bee colony survival in the US and Europe, in Kenya Varroa presence alone does not appear to impact colony size. Nosema apis was found at three sites along the coast and one interior site. Only a small number of pesticides at low concentrations were found. Of the seven common US/European honey bee viruses, only three were identified but, like Varroa, were absent from northern Kenya. The number of viruses present was positively correlated with Varroa levels, but was not correlated with colony size or hygienic behavior. Our results suggest that Varroa, the three viruses, and Nosema have been relatively recently introduced into Kenya, but these factors do not yet appear to be impacting Kenyan bee populations. Thus chemical control for Varroa and Nosema are not necessary for Kenyan bees at this time. This study provides baseline data for future analyses of the possible mechanisms underlying resistance to and the long-term impacts of these factors on African bee populations."
https://openalex.org/W2075455140,"In this study, using two different injury models in two different species, we found that early post-injury treatment with N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) reversed the behavioral deficits associated with the TBI. These data suggest generalization of a protocol similar to our recent clinical trial with NAC in blast-induced mTBI in a battlefield setting [1], to mild concussion from blunt trauma. This study used both weight drop in mice and fluid percussion injury in rats. These were chosen to simulate either mild or moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI). For mice, we used novel object recognition and the Y maze. For rats, we used the Morris water maze. NAC was administered beginning 30–60 minutes after injury. Behavioral deficits due to injury in both species were significantly reversed by NAC treatment. We thus conclude NAC produces significant behavioral recovery after injury. Future preclinical studies are needed to define the mechanism of action, perhaps leading to more effective therapies in man."
https://openalex.org/W2014430576,"Chemical profiling of decomposition odour is conducted in the environmental sciences to detect malodourous target sources in air, water or soil. More recently decomposition odour profiling has been employed in the forensic sciences to generate a profile of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by decomposed remains. The chemical profile of decomposition odour is still being debated with variations in the VOC profile attributed to the sample collection technique, method of chemical analysis, and environment in which decomposition occurred. To date, little consideration has been given to the partitioning of odour between different matrices and the impact this has on developing an accurate VOC profile. The purpose of this research was to investigate the decomposition odour profile surrounding vertebrate carrion to determine how VOCs partition between soil and air. Four pig carcasses (Sus scrofa domesticus L.) were placed on a soil surface to decompose naturally and their odour profile monitored over a period of two months. Corresponding control sites were also monitored to determine the VOC profile of the surrounding environment. Samples were collected from the soil below and the air (headspace) above the decomposed remains using sorbent tubes and analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A total of 249 compounds were identified but only 58 compounds were common to both air and soil samples. This study has demonstrated that soil and air samples produce distinct subsets of VOCs that contribute to the overall decomposition odour. Sample collection from only one matrix will reduce the likelihood of detecting the complete spectrum of VOCs, which further confounds the issue of determining a complete and accurate decomposition odour profile. Confirmation of this profile will enhance the performance of cadaver-detection dogs that are tasked with detecting decomposition odour in both soil and air to locate victim remains."
https://openalex.org/W1999657569,"Traction Force Microscopy (TFM) is a powerful approach for quantifying cell-material interactions that over the last two decades has contributed significantly to our understanding of cellular mechanosensing and mechanotransduction. In addition, recent advances in three-dimensional (3D) imaging and traction force analysis (3D TFM) have highlighted the significance of the third dimension in influencing various cellular processes. Yet irrespective of dimensionality, almost all TFM approaches have relied on a linear elastic theory framework to calculate cell surface tractions. Here we present a new high resolution 3D TFM algorithm which utilizes a large deformation formulation to quantify cellular displacement fields with unprecedented resolution. The results feature some of the first experimental evidence that cells are indeed capable of exerting large material deformations, which require the formulation of a new theoretical TFM framework to accurately calculate the traction forces. Based on our previous 3D TFM technique, we reformulate our approach to accurately account for large material deformation and quantitatively contrast and compare both linear and large deformation frameworks as a function of the applied cell deformation. Particular attention is paid in estimating the accuracy penalty associated with utilizing a traditional linear elastic approach in the presence of large deformation gradients."
https://openalex.org/W2044844304,"A current model posits that cofilin-dependent actin severing negatively impacts dendritic spine volume. Studies suggested that increased cofilin activity underlies activity-dependent spine shrinkage, and that reduced cofilin activity induces activity-dependent spine growth. We suggest instead that both types of structural plasticity correlate with decreased cofilin activity. However, the mechanism of inhibition determines the outcome for spine morphology. RNAi in rat hippocampal cultures demonstrates that cofilin is essential for normal spine maintenance. Cofilin-F-actin binding and filament barbed-end production decrease during the early phase of activity-dependent spine shrinkage; cofilin concentration also decreases. Inhibition of the cathepsin B/L family of proteases prevents both cofilin loss and spine shrinkage. Conversely, during activity-dependent spine growth, LIM kinase stimulates cofilin phosphorylation, which activates phospholipase D-1 to promote actin polymerization. These results implicate novel molecular mechanisms and prompt a revision of the current model for how cofilin functions in activity-dependent structural plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2092486828,"Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is transmitted to vertebrates by taiga or forest ticks through bites, inducing disease of variable severity. The reasons underlying these differences in the severity of the disease are unknown. In order to identify genetic factors affecting the pathogenicity of virus strains, we have sequenced and compared the complete genomes of 34 Far-Eastern subtype (FE) TBEV strains isolated from patients with different disease severity (Primorye, the Russian Far East). We analyzed the complete genomes of 11 human pathogenic strains isolated from the brains of dead patients with the encephalitic form of the disease (Efd), 4 strains from the blood of patients with the febrile form of TBE (Ffd), and 19 strains from patients with the subclinical form of TBE (Sfd). On the phylogenetic tree, pathogenic Efd strains formed two clusters containing the prototype strains, Senzhang and Sofjin, respectively. Sfd strains formed a third separate cluster, including the Oshima strain. The strains that caused the febrile form of the disease did not form a separate cluster. In the viral proteins, we found 198 positions with at least one amino acid residue substitution, of which only 17 amino acid residue substitutions were correlated with the variable pathogenicity of these strains in humans and they authentically differed between the groups. We considered the role of each amino acid substitution and assumed that the deletion of 111 amino acids in the capsid protein in combination with the amino acid substitutions R16K and S45F in the NS3 protease may affect the budding process of viral particles. These changes may be the major reason for the diminished pathogenicity of TBEV strains. We recommend Sfd strains for testing as attenuation vaccine candidates."
https://openalex.org/W2074791004,"Objectives Currently, 68.3% of the milk available in schools is flavored, with chocolate being the most popular (61.6% of all milk). If chocolate milk is removed from a school cafeteria, what will happen to overall milk selection and consumption? Methods In a before-after study in 11 Oregon elementary schools, flavored milk–which will be referred to as chocolate milk–was banned from the cafeteria. Milk sales, school enrollment, and data for daily participation in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) were compared year to date. Results Total daily milk sales declined by 9.9% (p<0.01). Although white milk increased by 161.2 cartons per day (p<0.001), 29.4% of this milk was thrown away. Eliminating chocolate milk was also associated with 6.8% fewer students eating school lunches, and although other factors were also involved, this is consistent with the notion of psychological reactance. Conclusions Removing chocolate milk from school cafeterias may reduce calorie and sugar consumption, but it may also lead students to take less milk overall, drink less (waste more) of the white milk they do take, and no longer purchase school lunch. Food service managers need to carefully weigh the costs and benefits of eliminating chocolate milk and should consider alternative options that make white milk more convenient, attractive, and normal to choose."
https://openalex.org/W1983880650,"The pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) and other stress related disorders has been associated with aberrations in the hippocampus and the frontal brain areas. More recently, other brain regions, such as the caudate nucleus, the putamen and the amygdala have also been suggested to play a role in the development of mood disorders. By exposing rats to a variety of stressors over a period of eight weeks, different phenotypes, i.e. stress susceptible (anhedonic-like) and stress resilient animals, can be discriminated based on the sucrose consumption test. The anhedonic-like animals are a well validated model for MDD. Previously, we reported that in vivo diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) of the hippocampus shows altered diffusion properties in chronically stressed rats independent of the hedonic state and that the shape of the right hippocampus is differing among the three groups, including unchallenged controls. In this study we evaluated diffusion properties in the prefrontal cortex, caudate putamen (CPu) and amygdala of anhedonic-like and resilient phenotypes and found that mean kurtosis in the CPu was significantly different between the anhedonic-like and resilient animals. In addition, axial diffusion and radial diffusion were increased in the stressed animal groups in the CPu and the amygdala, respectively. Furthermore, we found that the CPu/brain volume ratio was increased significantly in anhedonic-like animals as compared with control animals. Concurrently, our results indicate that the effects of chronic stress on the brain are not lateralized in these regions. These findings confirm the involvement of the CPu and the amygdala in stress related disorders and MDD. Additionally, we also show that DKI is a potentially important tool to promote the objective assessment of psychiatric disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1995824370,"Insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) is a potential drug target in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D). IDE controls circulating insulin through a degradation-dependent clearance mechanism in multiple tissues. However, there is not sufficient information about IDE regulation in obesity. In this study, we test obesity-associated factors and pioglitazone in the regulation of IDE in diet-induced obese (DIO) C57BL/6 mice. The enzyme activity and protein level of IDE were increased in the liver of DIO mice. Pioglitazone (10 mg/kg/day) administration for 2 months significantly enhanced the enzyme activity (75%), protein (180%) and mRNA (100%) of IDE in DIO mice. The pioglitazone-induced changes were coupled with 50% reduction in fasting insulin and 20% reduction in fasting blood glucose. The mechanism of IDE regulation in liver was investigated in the mouse hepatoma cell line (Hepa 1c1c7 cells), in which pioglitazone (5 µM) increased IDE protein and mRNA in a time-dependent manner in an 8 h study. Free fatty acid (palmitate 300 µM) induced IDE protein, but reduced the mRNA. Glucagon induced, and TNF-α decreased IDE protein. Insulin did not exhibit any activity in the same condition. In summary, pioglitazone, FFA and glucagon directly increased, but TNF-α decreased the IDE activity in hepatocytes. The results suggest that IDE activity is regulated in liver by multiple factors in obesity and pioglitazone may induce IDE activity in the control of T2D."
https://openalex.org/W2010307955,"The slugs of Britain and Ireland form a well-studied fauna of economic importance. They include many widespread European species that are introduced elsewhere (at least half of the 36 currently recorded British species are established in North America, for example). To test the contention that the British and Irish fauna consists of 36 species, and to verify the identity of each, a species delimitation study was conducted based on a geographically wide survey. Comparisons between mitochondrial DNA (COI, 16S), nuclear DNA (ITS-1) and morphology were investigated with reference to interspecific hybridisation. Species delimitation of the fauna produced a primary species hypothesis of 47 putative species. This was refined to a secondary species hypothesis of 44 species by integration with morphological and other data. Thirty six of these correspond to the known fauna (two species in Arion subgenus Carinarion were scarcely distinct and Arion (Mesarion) subfuscus consisted of two near-cryptic species). However, by the same criteria a further eight previously undetected species (22% of the fauna) are established in Britain and/or Ireland. Although overlooked, none are strictly morphologically cryptic, and some appear previously undescribed. Most of the additional species are probably accidentally introduced, and several are already widespread in Britain and Ireland (and thus perhaps elsewhere). At least three may be plant pests. Some evidence was found for interspecific hybridisation among the large Arion species (although not involving A. flagellus) and more unexpectedly in species pairs in Deroceras (Agriolimacidae) and Limacus (Limacidae). In the latter groups, introgression appears to have occurred in one direction only, with recently-invading lineages becoming common at the expense of long-established or native ones. The results show how even a well-studied, macroscopic fauna can be vulnerable to cryptic and undetected invasions and changes."
https://openalex.org/W2006940467,"The relationship between Scleractinia and Corallimorpharia, Orders within Anthozoa distinguished by the presence of an aragonite skeleton in the former, is controversial. Although classically considered distinct groups, some phylogenetic analyses have placed the Corallimorpharia within a larger Scleractinia/Corallimorpharia clade, leading to the suggestion that the Corallimorpharia are ""naked corals"" that arose via skeleton loss during the Cretaceous from a Scleractinian ancestor. Scleractinian paraphyly is, however, contradicted by a number of recent phylogenetic studies based on mt nucleotide (nt) sequence data. Whereas the ""naked coral"" hypothesis was based on analysis of the sequences of proteins encoded by a relatively small number of mt genomes, here a much-expanded dataset was used to reinvestigate hexacorallian phylogeny. The initial observation was that, whereas analyses based on nt data support scleractinian monophyly, those based on amino acid (aa) data support the ""naked coral"" hypothesis, irrespective of the method and with very strong support. To better understand the bases of these contrasting results, the effects of systematic errors were examined. Compared to other hexacorallians, the mt genomes of ""Robust"" corals have a higher (A+T) content, codon usage is far more constrained, and the proteins that they encode have a markedly higher phenylalanine content, leading us to suggest that mt DNA repair may be impaired in this lineage. Thus the ""naked coral"" topology could be caused by high levels of saturation in these mitochondrial sequences, long-branch effects or model violations. The equivocal results of these extensive analyses highlight the fundamental problems of basing coral phylogeny on mitochondrial sequence data."
https://openalex.org/W1995501352,"Background The Mismatch Negativity (MMN) is an event-related potential (ERP) sensitive to early auditory deviance detection and has been shown to be reduced in schizophrenia patients. Moreover, MMN amplitude reduction to duration deviant tones was found to be related to functional outcomes particularly, to neuropsychological (working memory and verbal domains) and psychosocial measures. While MMN amplitude is thought to be correlated with deficits of early sensory processing, the functional significance of MMN latency remains unclear so far. The present study focused on the investigation of MMN in relation to neuropsychological function in schizophrenia. Method Forty schizophrenia patients and 16 healthy controls underwent a passive oddball paradigm (2400 binaural tones; 88% standards [1 kHz, 80 db, 80 ms], 11% frequency deviants [1.2 kHz], 11% duration deviants [40 ms]) and a neuropsychological test-battery. Patients were assessed with regard to clinical symptoms. Results Compared to healthy controls schizophrenia patients showed diminished MMN amplitude and shorter MMN latency to both deviants as well as an impaired neuropsychological test performance. Severity of positive symptoms was related to decreased MMN amplitude to duration deviants. Furthermore, enhanced verbal memory performance was associated with prolonged MMN latency to frequency deviants in patients. Conclusion The present study corroborates previous results of a diminished MMN amplitude and its association with positive symptoms in schizophrenia patients. Both, the findings of a shorter latency to duration and frequency deviants and the relationship of the latter with verbal memory in patients, emphasize the relevance of the temporal aspect of early auditory discrimination processing in schizophrenia."

Two biochars with contrasting characteristics were prepared from two feedstocks and added to the soil at a rate of 3% (w:w): Eucalyptus pyrolysed at 600°C (EB) and poultry litter at 400°C (PLB). Liming was carried out in two treatments (CaO1) and (CaO2) to the same pH as the treatments EB and PLB respectively. Total plant mass increased in soils amended with PLB and with a mixture of PLB and EB; however this was not sufficient to increase the efficiency of phytoextraction. Bioavailable and mobile fractions of Cd diminished after liming or biochar addition. Our study infers that, both the amount of Cd immobilized and the main mechanism responsible for this immobilization varies according to biochar properties."

In a retrospective analysis, we aimed to determine venous blood lead level (VBLL) thresholds and risk factors for encephalopathy using MSF programmatic data from the first year of the outbreak response.We included children aged ≤5 years with VBLL ≥45 µg/dL before any chelation and recorded neurological status. Odds ratios (OR) for neurological features were estimated; the final model was adjusted for age and baseline VBLL, using random effects for village of residence. 972 children met inclusion criteria: 885 (91%) had no neurological features; 34 (4%) had severe features; 47 (5%) had reported recent seizures; and six (1%) had other neurological abnormalities. The geometric mean VBLLs for all groups with neurological features were >100 µg/dL vs 65.9 µg/dL for those without neurological features. The adjusted OR for neurological features increased with increasing VBLL: from 2.75, 95%CI 1.27-5.98 (80-99.9 µg/dL) to 22.95, 95%CI 10.54-49.96 (≥120 µg/dL). Neurological features were associated with younger age (OR 4.77 [95% CI 2.50-9.11] for 1-<2 years and 2.69 [95%CI 1.15-6.26] for 2-<3 years, both vs 3-5 years). Severe neurological features were seen at VBLL <105 µg/dL only in those with malaria.Increasing VBLL (from ≥80 µg/dL) and age 1-<3 years were strongly associated with neurological features; in those tested for malaria, a positive test was also strongly associated. These factors will help clinicians managing children with lead poisoning in prioritising therapy and developing chelation protocols."
https://openalex.org/W2069917624,"In the current study, the therapeutic effects of zeaxanthin dipalmitate (ZD) on a rat alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD) model were evaluated. After-treatment with ZD from the 5th week to the 10th week in a 10-week ethanol intragastric administration in rats significantly alleviated the typical AFLD symptoms, including reduction in rat body weight, accumulation of hepatic fat droplets, occurrence of oxidative stress, inflammation, chemoattractive responses and hepatic apoptosis in the liver. The reduction of liver function abnormalities by ZD was partly through lower expression level of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), diminished activity of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) through the restoration of its inhibitor kappa B alpha (IκBα), and the modulation of MAPK pathways including p38 MAPK, JNK and ERK. ZD treatment alone did not pose obvious adverse effect on the healthy rat. In the cellular AFLD model, we also confirmed the inhibition of p38 MAPK and ERK abolished the beneficial effects of ZD. These results provide a scientific rationale for the use of zeaxanthin and its derivatives as new complementary agents for the prevention and treatment of alcoholic liver diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2010897036,"Cytoskeletal polymers play a fundamental role in the responses of cells to both external and internal stresses. Quantitative knowledge of the mechanical properties of those polymers is essential for developing predictive models of cell mechanics and mechano-sensing. Linear cytoskeletal polymers, such as actin filaments and microtubules, can grow to cellular length scales at which they behave as semiflexible polymers that undergo thermally-driven shape deformations. Bending deformations are often modeled using the wormlike chain model. A quantitative metric of a polymer's resistance to bending is the persistence length, the fundamental parameter of that model. A polymer's bending persistence length is extracted from its shape as visualized using various imaging techniques. However, the analysis methodologies required for determining the persistence length are often not readily within reach of most biological researchers or educators. Motivated by that limitation, we developed user-friendly, multi-platform compatible software to determine the bending persistence length from images of surface-adsorbed or freely fluctuating polymers. Three different types of analysis are available (cosine correlation, end-to-end and bending-mode analyses), allowing for rigorous cross-checking of analysis results. The software is freely available and we provide sample data of adsorbed and fluctuating filaments and expected analysis results for educational and tutorial purposes."

We assessed the phenotype and functional capacity of CD8 T cells specific for the immunodominant Mtb antigens CFP-10 and ESAT-6, in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) disease, before and after treatment, and in healthy persons with latent Mtb infection (LTBI). In patients with TB disease, CFP-10/ESAT-6-specific IFN-γ+ CD8 T cells had an activated, pro-apoptotic phenotype, with lower Bcl-2 and CD127 expression, and higher Ki67, CD57, and CD95 expression, than in LTBI. When CFP-10/ESAT-6-specific IFN-γ+ CD8 T cells were detectable, expression of distinct combinations of these markers was highly sensitive and specific for differentiating TB disease from LTBI. Successful treatment of disease resulted in changes of these markers, but not in restoration of CFP-10/ESAT-6-specific CD8 or CD4 memory T cell proliferative capacity. These data suggest that high mycobacterial load in active TB disease is associated with activated, short-lived CFP-10/ESAT-6-specific CD8 T cells with impaired functional capacity that is not restored following treatment. By contrast, LTBI is associated with preservation of long-lived CFP-10/ESAT-6-specific memory CD8 T cells that maintain high Bcl-2 expression and which may readily proliferate."
https://openalex.org/W2133540711,"Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) has been reported to exhibit therapeutic activity in cancer. However, many tumors remain resistant to treatment with TRAIL. Therefore, small molecules that potentiate the cytotoxic effects of TRAIL could be used for combinatorial therapy. Here we found that the ionophore antibiotic salinomycin acts in synergism with TRAIL, enhancing TRAIL-induced apoptosis in glioma cells. Treatment with low doses of salinomycin in combination with TRAIL augmented the activation of caspase-3 and increased TRAIL-R2 cell surface expression. TRAIL-R2 upmodulation was required for mediating the stimulatory effect of salinomycin on TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, since it was abrogated by siRNA-mediated TRAIL-R2 knockdown. Salinomycin in synergism with TRAIL exerts a marked anti-tumor effect in nude mice xenografted with human glioblastoma cells. Our results suggest that the combination of TRAIL and salinomycin may be a useful tool to overcome TRAIL resistance in glioma cells and may represent a potential drug for treatment of these tumors. Importantly, salinomycin+TRAIL were able to induce cell death of well-defined glioblastoma stem-like lines."
https://openalex.org/W2052628795,"We aimed to assess whether whole blood expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) with effects in cis and trans are robust and can be used to identify regulatory pathways affecting disease susceptibility.We performed whole-genome eQTL analyses in 890 participants of the KORA F4 study and in two independent replication samples (SHIP-TREND, N = 976 and EGCUT, N = 842) using linear regression models and Bonferroni correction.In the KORA F4 study, 4,116 cis-eQTLs (defined as SNP-probe pairs where the SNP is located within a 500 kb window around the transcription unit) and 94 trans-eQTLs reached genome-wide significance and overall 91% (92% of cis-, 84% of trans-eQTLs) were confirmed in at least one of the two replication studies. Different study designs including distinct laboratory reagents (PAXgene™ vs. Tempus™ tubes) did not affect reproducibility (separate overall replication overlap: 78% and 82%). Immune response pathways were enriched in cis- and trans-eQTLs and significant cis-eQTLs were partly coexistent in other tissues (cross-tissue similarity 40-70%). Furthermore, four chromosomal regions displayed simultaneous impact on multiple gene expression levels in trans, and 746 eQTL-SNPs have been previously reported to have clinical relevance. We demonstrated cross-associations between eQTL-SNPs, gene expression levels in trans, and clinical phenotypes as well as a link between eQTLs and human metabolic traits via modification of gene regulation in cis.Our data suggest that whole blood is a robust tissue for eQTL analysis and may be used both for biomarker studies and to enhance our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying gene-disease associations."
https://openalex.org/W1976284168,"Amyloid fibers are associated with disease but have little chemical reactivity. We investigated the formation and structure of amyloids to identify potential mechanisms for their pathogenic effects. We incubated lysozyme 20 mg/ml at 55C and pH 2.5 in a glycine-HCl buffer and prepared slides on mica substrates for examination by atomic force microscopy. Structures observed early in the aggregation process included monomers, small colloidal aggregates, and amyloid fibers. Amyloid fibers were observed to further self-assemble by two mechanisms. Two or more fibers may merge together laterally to form a single fiber bundle, usually in the form of a helix. Alternatively, fibers may become bound at points where they cross, ultimately forming an apparently irreversible macromolecular network. As the fibers assemble into a continuous network, the colloidal suspension undergoes a transition from a Newtonian fluid into a viscoelastic gel. Addition of salt did not affect fiber formation but inhibits transition of fibers from linear to helical conformation, and accelerates gel formation. Based on our observations, we considered the effects of gel formation on biological transport. Analysis of network geometry indicates that amyloid gels will have negligible effects on diffusion of small molecules, but they prevent movement of colloidal-sized structures. Consequently gel formation within neurons could completely block movement of transport vesicles in neuronal processes. Forced convection of extracellular fluid is essential for the transport of nutrients and metabolic wastes in the brain. Amyloid gel in the extracellular space can essentially halt this convection because of its low permeability. These effects may provide a physical mechanism for the cytotoxicity of chemically inactive amyloid fibers in neurodegenerative disease."
https://openalex.org/W1972414551,"Identifying footprints of selection can provide a straightforward insight into the mechanism of artificial selection and further dig out the causal genes related to important traits. In this study, three between-population and two within-population approaches, the Cross Population Extend Haplotype Homozygosity Test (XPEHH), the Cross Population Composite Likelihood Ratio (XPCLR), the F-statistics (Fst), the Integrated Haplotype Score (iHS) and the Tajima's D, were implemented to detect the selection footprints on the X chromosome in three pig breeds using Illumina Porcine60K SNP chip. In the detection of selection footprints using between-population methods, 11, 11 and 7 potential selection regions with length of 15.62 Mb, 12.32 Mb and 9.38 Mb were identified in Landrace, Chinese Songliao and Yorkshire by XPEHH, respectively, and 16, 13 and 17 potential selection regions with length of 15.20 Mb, 13.00 Mb and 19.21 Mb by XPCLR, 4, 2 and 4 potential selection regions with length of 3.20 Mb, 1.60 Mb and 3.20 Mb by Fst. For within-population methods, 7, 10 and 9 potential selection regions with length of 8.12 Mb, 8.40 Mb and 9.99 Mb were identified in Landrace, Chinese Songliao and Yorkshire by iHS, and 4, 3 and 2 potential selection regions with length of 3.20 Mb, 2.40 Mb and 1.60 Mb by Tajima's D. Moreover, the selection regions from different methods were partly overlapped, especially the regions around 22 ∼25 Mb were detected under selection in Landrace and Yorkshire while no selection in Chinese Songliao by all three between-population methods. Only quite few overlap of selection regions identified by between-population and within-population methods were found. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the genes relevant with meat quality, reproduction and immune were found in potential selection regions. In addition, three out of five significant SNPs associated with hematological traits reported in our genome-wide association study were harbored in potential selection regions."
https://openalex.org/W1975942907,"Escherichia coli RIC (Repair of Iron Centers) is a diiron protein previously reported to be involved in the repair of iron-sulfur proteins damaged by oxidative or nitrosative stresses, and proposed to act as an iron donor. This possible role of RIC was now examined specifically by evaluating its ability to donate iron ions to apo-iron-sulfur proteins, determining the iron binding constants and assessing the lability of its iron ions. We show, by UV-visible, EPR and resonance Raman spectroscopies that RIC may participate in the synthesis of an iron-sulfur cluster in the apo-forms of the spinach ferredoxin and IscU when in the presence of the sulfide donating system IscS and L-cysteine. Iron binding assays allowed determining the as-isolated and fully reduced RIC dissociation constants for the ferric and ferrous iron of 10−27 M and 10−13 M, respectively. Mössbauer studies revealed that the RIC iron ions are labile, namely when the center is in the mixed-valence redox form as compared with the (μ-oxo) diferric one. Altogether, these results suggest that RIC is capable of delivering iron for the formation of iron-sulfur clusters."
https://openalex.org/W2115603677,"High fat, low carbohydrate diets have become popular, as short-term studies show that such diets are effective for reducing body weight, and lowering the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. There is growing evidence from both humans and other animals that diet affects behaviour and intake of fat has been linked, positively and negatively, with traits such as exploration, social interaction, anxiety and fear. Animal models with high translational value can help provide relevant and important information in elucidating potential effects of high fat, low carbohydrate diets on human behaviour. Twenty four young, male Göttingen minipigs were fed either a high fat/cholesterol, low carbohydrate diet or a low fat, high carbohydrate/sucrose diet in contrast to a standard low fat, high carbohydrate minipig diet. Spontaneous behaviour was observed through video recordings of home pens and test-related behaviours were recorded during tests involving animal-human contact and reaction towards a novel object. We showed that the minipigs fed a high fat/cholesterol, low carbohydrate diet were less aggressive, showed more non-agonistic social contact and had fewer and less severe skin lesions and were less fearful of a novel object than minipigs fed low fat, high carbohydrate diets. These results found in a porcine model could have important implications for general health and wellbeing of humans and show the potential for using dietary manipulations to reduce aggression in human society."
https://openalex.org/W1985783165,"Diverticulosis can lead to diverticulitis, a colon condition involving inflammation and other complications. Diverticulosis can result from biological, behavioral, or genetic causes. However, the etiology of diverticulosis is unknown. Although diet is associated with diverticulosis, recent studies suggest other factors influence risk. We sought to identify anthropometric or serum markers that were associated with the presence of diverticulosis. To determine these associations, 126 asymptomatic men (48-65 yr) were recruited at the time of preventative screening colonoscopy. Anthropometric measures were taken, and blood was collected for serum protein analysis. Data were analyzed by logistic regression and factor analysis. Obese individuals (BMI >30) were 7.8 (CI: 2.3-26.3) times more likely than normal weight (BMI <25) individuals to have diverticulosis. The relationship was similar for waist circumference. Individuals with a waist circumference >45 inches were 8.1 (CI: 2.8-23.8) times more likely to have diverticulosis than those with a waist circumference <38 inches. Leptin was also positively associated with diverticulosis (OR = 5.5, CI: 2.0-14.7). Both low molecular weight adiponectin (LMW, OR = 0.50; CI: 0.3-0.8) and the soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE, OR = 0.4, CI: 0.3-0.7) were inversely related to the presence of diverticulosis. sRAGE levels were not correlated with leptin or C-peptide concentrations. The pattern of high BMI, waist circumference, leptin and C-peptide increased the odds of diverticulosis while the pattern of high levels of sRAGE and LMW adiponectin decreased the odds of diverticulosis. Associations between diverticulosis and anthropometric or serum markers may elucidate the origins of diverticulosis and may enable physicians to identify individuals at risk for diverticulitis."
https://openalex.org/W2026916609,"Adult birds tend to show high fidelity to their breeding territory or disperse over relatively short distances. Gene flow among avian populations is thus expected to occur primarily through natal dispersal. Although natal dispersal is a critical demographic process reflecting the area over which population dynamics take place, low recapture rates of birds breeding for the first time have limited our ability to reliably estimate dispersal rates and distances. Stable isotope approaches can elucidate origins of unmarked birds and so we generated year- and age-specific δ2H and δ34S feather isoscapes (ca. 180 000 km2) of coastal-breeding Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla) and used bivariate probability density functions to assign the likely natal areas of 35 males recruited as first-year breeders into a population located in northwestern New Brunswick, Canada. Most individuals (80-94% depending on the magnitude of an age correction factor used; i.e. 28-33 out of 35) were classified as residents (i.e. fledged within our study area) and estimated minimum dispersal distances of immigrants were between 40 and 240 km. Even when considering maximum dispersal distances, the likely origin of most first-year breeders was<200 km from our study area. Our method identified recruitment into our population from large geographic areas with relatively few samples whereas previous mark-recapture based methods have required orders of magnitude more individuals to describe dispersal at such geographic scales. Natal dispersal movements revealed here suggest the spatial scale over which many population processes are taking place and we suggest that conservation plans aiming to maintain populations of Ovenbirds and ecologically-similar species should consider management units within 100 or at most 200 km of target breeding populations."
https://openalex.org/W2056365779,"Social media has created new pathways for postpublication peer review, which regularly leads to corrections. Such online discussions are often resisted by authors and editors, however, and efforts to formalize postpublication peer review have not yet resonated with scientific communities. Social media has created new pathways for postpublication peer review, which regularly leads to corrections. Such online discussions are often resisted by authors and editors, however, and efforts to formalize postpublication peer review have not yet resonated with scientific communities. Before anyone heard the phrase “social media,” writer Joe Straczynski was online promoting, discussing, and occasionally defending Babylon 5, a science fiction television show he created. His assessment of the online community was prescient. He wrote, “The online audience is bracingly honest: if a show stinks, they will tell you so in utterly unvarnished terms. This is a benefit more producers should recognize, since working for TV is like shouting into a vacuum” (http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/GH-CASSADINE/1996-12/0850409764). For a long time, scientific publishing was like shouting into a vacuum. Authors tended to view surviving a journal’s peer review as the “finish line.” Once a paper was accepted, it was time to move on to the next project and next manuscript. After publication, discussions about a paper were often ephemeral: opinions expressed over lunch at conferences or around journal club tables wouldn’t go any further than the four walls of the room. More lasting evidence of a research community’s opinions about a paper, like citations, could take years to accrue. Today, scientific publishing is a lot less like shouting into a vacuum because of social media: blogs, Twitter, Facebook, and innumerable discussion forums. At over a decade old, science blogs are a mature medium (I’ve been blogging since 2002 at http://neurodojo.blogspot.com/), with several “best of” anthologies. Twitter has likewise established a strong scientific community. Of all of the ways scientists use social media, postpublication peer review—online comments about research articles by people with scientific bona fides—attracts some of the most attention from other scientists. Postpublication peer review isn’t anything new, although the term seems to be a relatively recent one. Some journals have had technical comments and letters to the editor as regular features for decades. But not all journals had these, and the limitations of print meant that commentary that appeared was tightly controlled. Due to the physical processes of editing, proofing, and printing the journal on paper, comments might be slow to appear. Due to lack of space, very few comments might be published. And there was always that possibility that editors or authors of articles being commented on might try to obstruct unflattering critiques. Consequently, the process of correcting the scientific literature was, and remains, long and difficult (Tatsioni et al., 2007Tatsioni A. Bonitsis N.G. Ioannidis J.P.A. JAMA. 2007; 298: 2517-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), particularly if the impetus for the correction was coming from someone other than the original authors. Postpublication peer review through traditional scientific publishing is like kabuki theater: a slow, rehearsed drama in which the viewer must recognize the subtle profundities of performers wearing deliberately ambiguous masks. Postpublication peer review on social media is like the mosh pit at a punk rock show. It’s fast, uncoordinated, a lot less subtle, more in your face, and involves a few more risks. Online commentary has proved very effective in attracting attention to certain classes of journal articles. For instance, papers making extraordinary claims with less than convincing evidence are often forced—sometimes unwillingly—into the spotlight (e.g., cells living without phosphorus [Reaves et al., 2012Reaves M.L. Sinha S. Rabinowitz J.D. Kruglyak L. Redfield R.J. Science. 2012; 337: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, Wolfe-Simon et al., 2011Wolfe-Simon F. Switzer Blum J. Kulp T.R. Gordon G.W. Hoeft S.E. Pett-Ridge J. Stolz J.F. Webb S.M. Weber P.K. Davies P.C.W. et al.Science. 2011; 332: 1163-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar]; mitochondria as a link to the soul [Warda and Han, 2008Warda M. Han J. Proteomics. 2008; 8: I-XXIIICrossref Google Scholar]; dubious links to genetically modified corn and cancer in rats [Séralini et al., 2012Séralini G.-E. Clair E. Mesnage R. Gress S. Defarge N. Malatesta M. Hennequin D. de Vendômois J.S. Food Chem. Toxicol. 2012; 50: 4221-4231Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar]). Worrying signs can go viral, like embarrassing notes coauthors left for each other that they failed to take out of the manuscript (“for this compound, just make up an elemental analysis,” from supplemental material in Drinkel et al., 2013Drinkel E.E. Wu L. Linden A. Dorta R. Organometallics. 2013; 33: 627-636Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We’ve all read papers and asked, “How did this get published?” by the end. The “How did this get published?” reaction reminds us of some of the limitations of normal, prepublication peer review. Because of those imperfections, some people have suggested that scientific publishing move from a “filter, then publish” model to “publish, then filter” (Hunter, 2012Hunter J. Front Comput Neurosci. 2012; 6: 63Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). I’m not one of them. Postpublication peer review can’t do the entire job of filtering the scientific literature right now; it’s too far from being a standard practice. Prepublication peer review is arguably the defining characteristic of academic writing. It has been built into the research enterprise from the ground up and is recognized as absolutely integral to science. Reviewing journal articles for editors is recognized as a service to the scientific field and can be rewarded in merit and tenure review. As a result, essentially every serious scientific article is peer reviewed before publication. In contrast, there are no incentives for anyone to engage in postpublication peer review, other than someone’s own intrinsic interest in understanding a journal article and desire to share what they’ve learned. Only a miniscule fraction of published papers generate discussion substantial enough to be termed postpublication peer review. I think of postpublication peer review as an extraordinarily valuable addition to, not a substitute for, the familiar peer review process that journals use before publication. My model is one of continuous evaluation: “filter, publish, and keep filtering.” Journal editors and lead authors on the receiving end of postpublication peer review often resist online critiques. There is a common pattern of objections raised from editors, authors, or both about maintaining the integrity of “the scientific record” and “going through proper channels.” These protestations are a lot more fun to read if you say them out loud with a fussy English accent and an occasional, “Not cricket, wot?” First, they imply that all online criticism is anonymous. Articles and editorials refer to online community as “faceless judges” (Couzin-Frankel, 2013bCouzin-Frankel J. Science. 2013; 341: 606-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) operating under “the cloak of anonymity” (Parak et al., 2013Parak W.J. Chan W.C.W. Hafner J.H. Hammond P.T. Hersam M.C. Javey A. Khademhosseini A. Kotov N.A. Mulvaney P. Nel A.E. et al.ACS Nano. 2013; 7: 8313-8316Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). For instance, all online discussion of Wolfe-Simon et al., 2011Wolfe-Simon F. Switzer Blum J. Kulp T.R. Gordon G.W. Hoeft S.E. Pett-Ridge J. Stolz J.F. Webb S.M. Weber P.K. Davies P.C.W. et al.Science. 2011; 332: 1163-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar was dismissed as “anonymous electronic communications” by Rosen et al., 2011Rosen B.P. Ajees A.A. McDermott T.R. Bioessays. 2011; 33: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar. Many bloggers use their real names. Many use pseudonyms rather than being anonymous, which is an important distinction. Writers with pseudonyms can create a track record of writing on which their expertise can be evaluated and almost always have ways to be contacted by someone who wants to talk to them. This is not to say that there are no anonymous comments; some postpublication peer review websites permit them (e.g., PubPeer, http://pubpeer.com/). Regardless, there are strong traditions for using both anonymity and pseudonyms in science (Neuroskeptic, 2013Neuroskeptic Trends Cogn. Sci. 2013; 17: 195-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), not the least of which is journal peer review itself. It is a little audacious for authors and editors to decry the negative effects of “anonymous bloggers” when essentially every journal practices anonymous peer review. Bloggers are often easier to identify than journal reviewers. We still don’t know who reviewed Wolfe-Simon et al., 2011Wolfe-Simon F. Switzer Blum J. Kulp T.R. Gordon G.W. Hoeft S.E. Pett-Ridge J. Stolz J.F. Webb S.M. Weber P.K. Davies P.C.W. et al.Science. 2011; 332: 1163-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar for Science. But we know Rosie Redfield critiqued it on her blog (http://rrresearch.fieldofscience.com/2010/12/arsenic-associated-bacteria-nasas.html), which ultimately led to a paper that failed to replicate key claims of the original paper (Reaves et al., 2012Reaves M.L. Sinha S. Rabinowitz J.D. Kruglyak L. Redfield R.J. Science. 2012; 337: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Second, they cheerlead for peer review. Editors and authors often make the motherhood and apple pie statement that journal peer review is an unalloyed good. Blogs are therefore suspect as “vanity press” with “no peer review” (North, 2013North G. Curr. Biol. 2013; 23: R461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), leaving befuddled readers apparently unable to discern “how do we know that this is, in fact, true” (Parak et al., 2013Parak W.J. Chan W.C.W. Hafner J.H. Hammond P.T. Hersam M.C. Javey A. Khademhosseini A. Kotov N.A. Mulvaney P. Nel A.E. et al.ACS Nano. 2013; 7: 8313-8316Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Even when faced with cases in which peer review failed to detect a highly problematic paper, editors rarely change their journal’s policies to improve the peer review process. The rising number of retractions, most of which are the result of misconduct (Fang et al., 2012Fang F.C. Steen R.G. Casadevall A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 17028-17033Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), suggests that prepublication peer review could stand a little improvement. Third, they suggest that the Internet is untrustworthy, talking about “the massive misinformation that pervades the Internet” (Rosen et al., 2011Rosen B.P. Ajees A.A. McDermott T.R. Bioessays. 2011; 33: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and “the magic and nonsense that floods cyberspace” (Silver and Phung, 2011Silver S. Phung T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2011; 315: 79-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). If you can’t shoot the messenger, you might be able to fire some bullets into the horse the messenger rides in on. If you are ever on the receiving end of criticism online, I suggest you not use any of the arguments above, particularly if you do not address the specific critiques about your paper. People will see the arguments as the diversionary tactics they are. Finally, they complain that comments are not civil. Online critiques are described with phrases like “Trial by Twitter” (Mandavilli, 2011Mandavilli A. Nature. 2011; 469: 286-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), “witch hunting” (Bracher, 2013Bracher, P. (2013). Chemistry world and others on dodgy data. ChemBark, http://blog.chembark.com/2013/09/05/chemistry-world-and-others-on-dodgy-data/Google Scholar), or “hate sites” (Couzin-Frankel, 2013aCouzin-Frankel J. Science. 2013; 339: 132Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). One author accused his critics of “cyberbullying” (Service, 2014Service R.F. Science. 2014; 343: 358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). These sorts of descriptions show that we scientists are a long way from the dispassionate image that we sometimes try to present. People get emotional about this stuff. There are lines that people critiquing papers online should not cross. For example, it’s clear that anyone making blatantly bigoted statements about sex, race, and so on has lost any claim to be performing peer review in a professional way, whether it be pre- or postpublication. The difference between an inflammatory and a moderate tone can have legal consequences. It is one thing to point out similarities in micrographs; it is another to say that they are a “smoking gun” demonstrating deliberate fraud. One website took Science Fraud as its name, and legal action against the author was not out of the question because some statements on the website were arguably libelous (Couzin-Frankel, 2013aCouzin-Frankel J. Science. 2013; 339: 132Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, concerns about “tone” are often from established, tenured, white guys at big research universities working at established journals. One of the most profound things about social media is that it has lowered the barrier to creating and spreading conversations. This can give voice to people who were previously marginalized, for whatever reason. In the past, scientific commentary could be regulated by gatekeepers who were part of the scientific “in crowd.” Now, people who are not part of that crowd don’t need permission of gatekeepers to spread a scientific conversation to a wider audience. This means that the conversation cannot be as easily controlled by authority. Complaining about “tone” is one way to try to assert power and stifle voices by making “polite” equivalent to “innocuous.” So far, I have discussed cases where postpublication peer review has been critical of papers. Dodgy results, retractions, and bad feelings all make for reading that has “grab the popcorn” entertainment value. This can lead to the mistaken perception that postpublication peer review is dedicated to tearing apart all papers that are not ignored. Perhaps sensing this perception, one pseudonymous blogger, the Neurocritic, who runs a blog of the same name (http://neurocritic.blogspot.com), felt compelled to create a sister blog, the Neurocomplimenter (http://neurocomplimenter.blogspot.com), to promote neuroscience papers that deserved, “That was a fantastic study! Good show!” People underestimate the number of journal articles that receive positive reviews online. Because there are no incentives to perform postpublication peer review, bloggers usually write about papers interesting to them personally. Many posts and comments reflect papers in a positive light and can act as a welcome signal boost. Some evidence indicates that postpublication review not only brings new research to the attention of a wider audience, including fellow scientists (Allen et al., 2013Allen H.G. Stanton T.R. Di Pietro F. Moseley G.L. PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e68914Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), it may increase later citations (Shema et al., 2014Shema H. Bar-Ilan J. Thelwall M. JASIST. 2014; (Published online January 15, 2014)https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.23037Crossref Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Online postpublication review is still a relatively new phenomenon, particularly in the life sciences. People are still feeling out the potential pitfalls and best ways to reap the benefits of online commentary. There have been many attempts to create mechanisms for postpublication peer review, but the response has been largely underwhelming. The first approach is for the publisher to create tools allowing readers to enter comments about papers on the journal website. When PLOS ONE launched in 2006, one of its prominent innovations was to provide tools for users to comment upon and rate papers very easily. These largely went unused. I don’t know of any journal that has a thriving online community discussing papers within the journal. A second approach has been tried by several scientific societies: creating specialized social media sites for scientists. I’ve seen many websites bill themselves as “Facebook for scientists.” None have succeeded, probably because they ignore the simple fact that Facebook already exists. Why do I need one specifically for scientists? For me, part of the attraction of social media is that it is inclusive, rather than targeted to peers. Sites like Facebook and Twitter have more potential not only to reach people outside my scientific field, but to reach people outside of academia or research. A third approach has been to create dedicated websites for postpublication peer review. Some have positioned themselves as online journal clubs, while others have taken a more expressly critical approach of policing the literature. It is too early to know how many of these websites will stand the test of time. For example, one website, The Third Reviewer, opened and apparently shuttered in 2010. Science Fraud opened in 2013 and closed within months due to the author’s loss of anonymity and prospects of legal action (Couzin-Frankel, 2013aCouzin-Frankel J. Science. 2013; 339: 132Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). PubPeer launched in May 2013 and has received some traction thanks to it hosting some prominent and controversial stories (Couzin-Frankel, 2013bCouzin-Frankel J. Science. 2013; 341: 606-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, Service, 2014Service R.F. Science. 2014; 343: 358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). A journal, Proceedings of Peerage of Science (http://www.peerageofscience.org/proceedings), was created earlier this year in hopes of becoming “the venue of choice for both positive and critical commentaries.” But postpublication peer review may have received its biggest boost when PubMed rolled out a commenting feature late in 2013. It is too early to tell if people will use the PubMed commenting tools, but it certainly signals that authors should expect postpublication peer review. None of these efforts to formalize and centralize postpublication peer review have come close to the effectiveness of social media, particularly blogs and Twitter. Many scientists have very systematic minds and see the current state of postpublication peer review as anarchic (which it is). Many like the idea of central repositories and would love to see all comments about a paper aggregated into a single place. This may not be necessary, considering that the original papers are deposited in many journals and in many places around the web. To this day, there are still scientific journals that are not available online but only as print copies. If the original work can be distributed in many different places, it should not be fatal to have the commentary about that work distributed in many places too. Maybe an attitude adjustment is needed. People tend to ask whether social media should be part of the “scientific record” and whether discourse on social media should be held to the standards of journal articles. But rather than treating social media as the equivalent of letters to the editors and comment sections and journal articles, we should think of social media more like another scientific tradition: the research conference. I’m on Twitter (https://twitter.com/DoctorZen) precisely because I get the same sort of intellectual stimulation I get at conferences. There are important differences in the scope and reach of a conference versus social media, but both are a means to end: more and better research. Everything that happens on social media has been happening at conferences for as long as there have been conferences. People ask pointed questions during presentations. People gather around lunch tables and discuss whether experiments had appropriate controls. These informal conversations were never part of the scientific record, but there was never any question that they were an important part of the scientific endeavor. Social media is just the biggest research conference in the world."
https://openalex.org/W1994374138,"White sharks are highly migratory apex predators, globally distributed in temperate, sub-tropical, and tropical waters. Knowledge of white shark biology and ecology has increased recently based on research at known aggregation sites in the Indian, Atlantic, and Northeast Pacific Oceans; however, few data are available for the Northwest Pacific Ocean. This study provides a meta-analysis of 240 observations of white sharks from the Northwest Pacific Ocean between 1951 and 2012. Records comprise reports of bycatch in commercial fisheries, media accounts, personal communications, and documentation of shark-human interactions from Russia (n = 8), Republic of Korea (22), Japan (129), China (32), Taiwan (45), Philippines (1) and Vietnam (3). Observations occurred in all months, excluding October-January in the north (Russia and Republic of Korea) and July-August in the south (China, Taiwan, Philippines, and Vietnam). Population trend analysis indicated that the relative abundance of white sharks in the region has remained relatively stable, but parameterization of a 75% increase in observer effort found evidence of a minor decline since 2002. Reliably measured sharks ranged from 126-602 cm total length (TL) and 16-2530 kg total weight. The largest shark in this study (602 cm TL) represents the largest measured shark on record worldwide. For all countries combined the sex ratio was non-significantly biased towards females (1∶1.1; n = 113). Of 60 females examined, 11 were confirmed pregnant ranging from the beginning stages of pregnancy (egg cases) to near term (140 cm TL embryos). On average, 6.0±2.2 embryos were found per litter (maximum of 10) and gestation period was estimated to be 20 months. These observations confirm that white sharks are present in the Northwest Pacific Ocean year-round. While acknowledging the difficulties of studying little known populations of a naturally low abundance species, these results highlight the need for dedicated research to inform regional conservation and management planning."
https://openalex.org/W2138456282,"Induction of pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) by defined transcription factors is the recognized canonical means for somatic reprogramming, however, it remains incompletely understood how individual transcription factors affect cell fate decisions during the reprogramming process. Here, we report induction of fibroblast reprogramming by various transcriptional factors is mediated by a miR19a/b-PTEN axis. cMyc, one of the four Yamanaka factors known to stimulate both somatic cell reprogramming and tumorigenesis, induced the expression of multiple mircoRNAs, miR-17∼92 cluster in particular, in the early stage of reprogramming of human fibroblasts. Importantly, miR-17∼92 cluster could greatly enhance human fibroblast reprogramming induced by either the four Yamanaka factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and cMyc, or 4F) or the first three transcriptional factors (Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4, or 3F). Among members of this microRNA cluster, miR-19a/b exhibited the most potent effect on stimulating fibroblst reprogramming to iPSCs. Additional studies revealed that miR-19a/b enhanced iPSC induction efficiency by targeted inhibition of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a renowned tumor suppressor whose loss-of-function mutations were found in multiple human malignancies. Our results thus demonstrate an important role of miR-19a/b-PTEN axis in the reprogramming of human fibroblasts, illustrating that the somatic reprogramming process and its underlying regulation pathways are intertwined with oncogenic signaling in human malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2055185517,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection represents a vital complication after Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT). We screened the entire CMV proteome to visualize the humoral target epitope-focus profile in serum after HSCT. IgG profiling from four patient groups (donor and/or recipient +/− for CMV) was performed at 6, 12 and 24 months after HSCT using microarray slides containing 17174 of 15mer-peptides overlapping by 4 aa covering 214 proteins from CMV. Data were analyzed using maSigPro, PAM and the ‘exclusive recognition analysis (ERA)’ to identify unique CMV epitope responses for each patient group. The ‘exclusive recognition analysis’ of serum epitope patterns segregated best 12 months after HSCT for the D+/R+ group (versus D−/R−). Epitopes were derived from UL123 (IE1), UL99 (pp28), UL32 (pp150), this changed at 24 months to 2 strongly recognized peptides provided from UL123 and UL100. Strongly (IgG) recognized CMV targets elicited also robust cytokine production in T-cells from patients after HSCT defined by intracellular cytokine staining (IL-2, TNF, IFN and IL-17). High-content peptide microarrays allow epitope profiling of entire viral proteomes; this approach can be useful to map relevant targets for diagnostics and therapy in patients with well defined clinical endpoints. Peptide microarray analysis visualizes the breadth of B-cell immune reconstitution after HSCT and provides a useful tool to gauge immune reconstitution."
https://openalex.org/W2057049891,"We outline a framework for evaluating food- and water-borne surveillance systems using hospitalization records, and demonstrate the approach using data on salmonellosis, campylobacteriosis and giardiasis in persons aged ≥65 years in Massachusetts. For each infection, and for each reporting jurisdiction, we generated smoothed standardized morbidity ratios (SMR) and surveillance to hospitalization ratios (SHR) by comparing observed surveillance counts with expected values or the number of hospitalized cases, respectively. We examined the spatial distribution of SHR and related this to the mean for the entire state. Through this approach municipalities that deviated from the typical experience were identified and suspected of under-reporting. Regression analysis revealed that SHR was a significant predictor of SMR, after adjusting for population age-structure. This confirms that the spatial “signal” depicted by surveillance is in part influenced by inconsistent testing and reporting practices since municipalities that reported fewer cases relative to the number of hospitalizations had a lower relative risk (as estimated by SMR). Periodic assessment of SHR has potential in assessing the performance of surveillance systems."
https://openalex.org/W2008335084,"A decreased global autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity and increased sympathetic activation in patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA) seem to worsen the clinical severity and could play a role in the pathophysiology of the disease, notably by triggering vaso-occlusive crises. Because exercise challenges the ANS activity in the general population, we sought to determine whether a short (<15 min) and progressive moderate exercise session conducted until the first ventilatory threshold had an effect on the ANS activity of a group of SCA patients and a group of healthy individuals (CONT group). Temporal and spectral analyses of the nocturnal heart rate variability were performed before and on the 3 nights following the exercise session. Standard deviation of all normal RR intervals (SDNN), total power, low frequencies (LF) and high frequencies powers (HF) were lower but LF/HF was higher in SCA patients than in the CONT group. Moderate exercise did not modify ANS activity in both groups. In addition, no adverse clinical events occurred during the entire protocol. These results imply that this kind of short and moderate exercise is not detrimental for SCA patients."
https://openalex.org/W1994742675,"Food selection behavior of lepidopteran larvae is predominantly governed by the activation of taste neurons present in two sensilla styloconica located on the galea of the maxilla. In this study, we present the ultrastructure of the sensilla styloconica and the central projection pattern of their associated receptor neurons in larvae of the heliothine moth, Helicoverpa armigera. By means of light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, the previous findings of two morphologically fairly similar sensilla comprising a socketed conic tip inserted into a large peg were confirmed. However, the peg size of the medial sensillum was found to be significantly bigger than that of the lateral sensillum. The sensory neurons derived from each sensillum styloconicum were mapped separately using anterograde staining experiments combined with confocal laser-scanning microscopy. For determining the afferents’ target regions relative to each other, we reconstructed the labeled axons and placed them into a common reference framework. The sensory axons from both sensilla projected via the ipsilateral maxillary nerve to the suboesophageal ganglion and further through the ipsilateral circumoesophageal connective to the brain. In the suboesophageal ganglion, the sensory projections targeted two areas of the ipsilateral maxillary neuropil, one located in the ventrolateral neuromere and the other adjacent to the neuromere midline. In the brain, the axon terminals targeted the dorso-anterior area of the ipsilateral tritocerebrum. As confirmed by the three-dimensional reconstructions, the target regions of the neural projections originating from each of the two sensilla styloconica were identical."

Proliferation was measured using 3H-thymidine incorporation and Ki67 expression. Activation marker (CD19, HLA-DR, CD25) expression was measured by FACS analysis. Immunoglobulins were measured by ELISA and release of cytokines was measured by Luminex assay.TLR7-induced B cell activation was not associated with T cell activation. IL-7-induced T cell activation alone and together with TLR7A synergistically increased numbers of both proliferating (Ki67+) B cells and T cells, which was further increased in the presence of monocytes/macrophages. This was associated by up regulation of activation markers on B cells and T cells. Additive or synergistic induction of production of immunoglobulins by TLR7 and IL-7 was associated by synergistic induction of T cell cytokines (IFNγ, IL-17A, IL-22), which was only evident in the presence of monocytes/macrophages.IL-7-induced CD4 T cell activation and TLR7-induced B cell activation synergistically induce T helper cell cytokine and B cell immunoglobulin production, which is critically dependent on monocytes/macrophages. Our results indicate that previously described increased expression of IL-7 and TLR7 together with increased numbers of macrophages at sites of inflammation in autoimmune diseases like RA and pSS significantly contributes to enhanced lymphocyte activation."
https://openalex.org/W1982082982,"Chiari-like malformation (CM) is a developmental abnormality of the craniocervical junction that is common in the Griffon Bruxellois (GB) breed with an estimated prevalence of 65%. This disease is characterized by overcrowding of the neural parenchyma at the craniocervical junction and disturbance of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow. The most common clinical sign is pain either as a direct consequence of CM or neuropathic pain as a consequence of secondary syringomyelia. The etiology of CM remains unknown but genetic factors play an important role. To investigate the genetic complexity of the disease, a quantitative trait locus (QTL) approach was adopted. A total of 14 quantitative skull and atlas measurements were taken and were tested for association to CM. Six traits were found to be associated to CM and were subjected to a whole-genome association study using the Illumina canine high density bead chip in 74 GB dogs (50 affected and 24 controls). Linear and mixed regression analyses identified associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on 5 Canis Familiaris Autosomes (CFAs): CFA2, CFA9, CFA12, CFA14 and CFA24. A reconstructed haplotype of 0.53 Mb on CFA2 strongly associated to the height of the cranial fossa (diameter F) and an haplotype of 2.5 Mb on CFA14 associated to both the height of the rostral part of the caudal cranial fossa (AE) and the height of the brain (FG) were significantly associated to CM after 10 000 permutations strengthening their candidacy for this disease (P = 0.0421, P = 0.0094 respectively). The CFA2 QTL harbours the Sall-1 gene which is an excellent candidate since its orthologue in humans is mutated in Townes-Brocks syndrome which has previously been associated to Chiari malformation I. Our study demonstrates the implication of multiple traits in the etiology of CM and has successfully identified two new QTL associated to CM and a potential candidate gene."
https://openalex.org/W2019789751,"Ursolic acid (UA), a pentacyclic triterpenoid widely found in medicinal herbs and fruits, has been reported to possess a wide range of beneficial properties including anti-hyperglycemia, anti-obesity, and anti-cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the action of UA remain largely unknown. Here we show that UA inhibits leucine-induced activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway in C2C12 myotubes. The UA-mediated inhibition of mTORC1 is independent of Akt, tuberous sclerosis complex 1/2 (TSC1/2), and Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb), suggesting that UA negatively regulates mTORC1 signaling by targeting at a site downstream of these mTOR regulators. UA treatment had no effect on the interaction between mTOR and its activator Raptor or inhibitor Deptor, but suppressed the binding of RagB to Raptor and inhibited leucine-induced mTOR lysosomal localization. Taken together, our study identifies UA as a direct negative regulator of the mTORC1 signaling pathway and suggests a novel mechanism by which UA exerts its beneficial function."
https://openalex.org/W1988410592,"A single correlate of effective vaccine protection against chronic HCV infection has yet to be defined. In this study, we analyzed T-cell responses in four chimpanzees, immunized with core-E1-E2-NS3 and subsequently infected with HCV1b. Viral clearance was observed in one animal, while the other three became chronically infected. In the animal that cleared infection, NS3-specific CD8 T-cell responses were observed to be more potent in terms of frequency and polyfunctionality of cytokine producing cells. Unique to this animal was the presence of killing-competent CD8 T-cells, specific for NS3 1258-1272, being presented by the chimpanzee MHC class I molecule Patr-A*03∶01, and a high affinity recognition of this epitope. In the animals that became chronically infected, T-cells were able to produce cytokines against the same peptide but no cytolysis could be detected. In conclusion, in the animal that was able to clear HCV infection not only cytokine production was observed but also cytolytic potential against specific MHC class I/peptide-combinations."
https://openalex.org/W2068468670,"Background Reconstruction materials currently used in clinical for osteoarticular tuberculosis (TB) are unsatisfactory due to a variety of reasons. Rifampicin (RFP) is a well-known and highly effective first-line anti-tuberculosis (anti-TB) drug. Poly-DL-lactide (PDLLA) and nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA) are two promising materials that have been used both for orthopedic reconstruction and as carriers for drug release. In this study we report the development of a novel anti-TB implant for osteoarticular TB reconstruction using a combination of RFP, PDLLA and nHA. Methods RFP, PDLLA and nHA were used as starting materials to produce a novel anti-TB activity implant by the solvent evaporation method. After manufacture, the implant was characterized and its biodegradation and drug release profile were tested. The in vitro cytotoxicity of the implant was also evaluated in pre-osteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells using multiple methodologies. Results A RFP/PDLLA/nHA composite was successfully synthesized using the solvent evaporation method. The composite has a loose and porous structure with evenly distributed pores. The production process was steady and no chemical reaction occurred as proved by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). Meanwhile, the composite blocks degraded and released drug for at least 12 weeks. Evaluation of in vitro cytotoxicity in MC3T3-E1 cells verified that the synthesized composite blocks did not affect cell growth and proliferation. Conclusion It is feasible to manufacture a novel bioactive anti-TB RFP/PDLLA/nHA composite by the solvent evaporation method. The composite blocks showed appropriate properties such as degradation, drug release and biosafety to MC3T3-E1 cells. In conclusion, the novel composite blocks may have great potential for clinical applications in repairing bone defects caused by osteoarticular TB."
https://openalex.org/W2093658470,"As both major macronutrients and signal molecules, nitrogen metabolites, such as nitrate and nitrite, play an important role in plant growth and development. In this study, the callus growth of indica rice cv. 9311 was significantly enhanced by nitrite, whereas the soluble protein content remained unchanged. The deep RNA sequencing technology (RNA-seq) showed that the transcriptional profiles of cv. 9311 calli were significantly changed after adding nitrite to the nitrate-free medium, and these nitrite-responsive genes were involved in a wide range of plant processes, particularly in the secondary metabolite pathways. Interestingly, most of the genes involved in phenylpropanoid-related pathways were coordinately down-regulated by nitrite, such as four cinnamoyl-CoA reductase, and these in turn resulted in the decrease of lignin content of indica calli. Furthermore, several candidate genes related to cell growth or stress responses were identified, such as genes coding for expansins, SMALL AUXIN UP RNA (SAUR) and HSP20s, and these suggested that nitrite could probably serve as a transcriptome signal to enhance the indica calli growth by regulation of various downstream genes expression. This study contributes to a better understanding of the function of nitrite during the process of plant tissue culture and could aid in the application of this technology to improved indica genetic transformation efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1977792380,"Analogs of the cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP have been extensively used to mimic or modulate cellular events mediated by protein kinase A (PKA), Exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac), or protein kinase G (PKG). We report here that some of the most commonly used cyclic nucleotide analogs inhibit transmembrane transport mediated by the liver specific organic anion transporter peptides OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, unrelated to actions on Epac, PKA or PKG. Several cAMP analogs, particularly with 8-pCPT-substitution, inhibited nodularin (Nod) induced primary rat hepatocyte apoptosis. Inhibition was not mediated by PKA or Epac, since increased endogenous cAMP, and some strong PKA- or Epac-activating analogs failed to protect cells against Nod induced apoptosis. The cAMP analogs inhibiting Nod induced hepatocyte apoptosis also reduced accumulation of radiolabeled Nod or cholic acid in primary rat hepatocytes. They also inhibited Nod induced apoptosis in HEK293 cells with enforced expression of OATP1B1 or 1B3, responsible for Nod transport into cells. Similar results were found with adenosine analogs, disconnecting the inhibitory effect of certain cAMP analogs from PKA or Epac. The most potent inhibitors were 8-pCPT-6-Phe-cAMP and 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP, whereas analogs like 6-MB-cAMP or 8-Br-cAMP did not inhibit Nod uptake. This suggests that the addition of aromatic ring-containing substituents like the chloro-phenyl-thio group to the purines of cyclic nucleotides increases their ability to inhibit the OATP-mediated transport. Taken together, our data show that aromatic ring substituents can add unwanted effects to cyclic nucleotides, and that such nucleotide analogs must be used with care, particularly when working with cells expressing OATP1B1/1B3, like hepatocytes, or intact animals where hepatic metabolism can be an issue, as well as certain cancer cells. On the other hand, cAMP analogs with substituents like bromo, monobutyryl were non-inhibitory, and could be considered an alternative when working with cells expressing OATP1 family members."
https://openalex.org/W2063768157,"The aims of this study were to develop bioinformatics tools to explore ultra-deep pyrosequencing (UDPS) data, to test these tools, and to use them to determine the optimum error threshold, and to compare results from UDPS and cloning based sequencing (CBS).Four serum samples, infected with either genotype D or E, from HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients were randomly selected. UDPS and CBS were used to sequence the basic core promoter/precore region of HBV. Two online bioinformatics tools, the ""Deep Threshold Tool"" and the ""Rosetta Tool"" (http://hvdr.bioinf.wits.ac.za/tools/), were built to test and analyze the generated data.A total of 10952 reads were generated by UDPS on the 454 GS Junior platform. In the four samples, substitutions, detected at 0.5% threshold or above, were identified at 39 unique positions, 25 of which were non-synonymous mutations. Sample #2 (HBeAg-negative, genotype D) had substitutions in 26 positions, followed by sample #1 (HBeAg-negative, genotype E) in 12 positions, sample #3 (HBeAg-positive, genotype D) in 7 positions and sample #4 (HBeAg-positive, genotype E) in only four positions. The ratio of nucleotide substitutions between isolates from HBeAg-negative and HBeAg-positive patients was 3.5 ∶ 1. Compared to genotype E isolates, genotype D isolates showed greater variation in the X, basic core promoter/precore and core regions. Only 18 of the 39 positions identified by UDPS were detected by CBS, which detected 14 of the 25 non-synonymous mutations detected by UDPS.UDPS data should be approached with caution. Appropriate curation of read data is required prior to analysis, in order to clean the data and eliminate artefacts. CBS detected fewer than 50% of the substitutions detected by UDPS. Furthermore it is important that the appropriate consensus (reference) sequence is used in order to identify variants correctly."
https://openalex.org/W1996731940,"Microarray studies with human subjects often have limited sample sizes which hampers the ability to detect reliable biomarkers associated with disease and motivates the need to aggregate data across studies. However, human gene expression measurements may be influenced by many non-random factors such as genetics, sample preparations, and tissue heterogeneity. These factors can contribute to a lack of agreement among related studies, limiting the utility of their aggregation. We show that it is feasible to carry out an automatic correction of individual datasets to reduce the effect of such 'latent variables' (without prior knowledge of the variables) in such a way that datasets addressing the same condition show better agreement once each is corrected. We build our approach on the method of surrogate variable analysis but we demonstrate that the original algorithm is unsuitable for the analysis of human tissue samples that are mixtures of different cell types. We propose a modification to SVA that is crucial to obtaining the improvement in agreement that we observe. We develop our method on a compendium of multiple sclerosis data and verify it on an independent compendium of Parkinson's disease datasets. In both cases, we show that our method is able to improve agreement across varying study designs, platforms, and tissues. This approach has the potential for wide applicability to any field where lack of inter-study agreement has been a concern."
https://openalex.org/W2026895620,"Cancer is associated with increased fracture risk, due either to metastasis or associated osteoporosis. After a fracture, blood clots form. Because proteins of the coagulation cascade and activated platelets promote cancer development, a fracture in patients with cancer often raises the question whether it is a pathologic fracture or whether the fracture itself might promote the formation of metastatic lesions. We therefore examined whether blood clot formation results in increased metastasis in a murine model of experimental breast cancer metastasis. For this purpose, a clot was surgically induced in the bone marrow of the left tibia of immundeficient mice. Either one minute prior to or five minutes after clot induction, human cancer cells were introduced in the circulation by intracardiac injection. The number of cancer cells that homed to the intervention site was determined by quantitative real-time PCR and flow cytometry. Metastasis formation and longitudinal growth were evaluated by bioluminescence imaging. The number of cancer cells that homed to the intervention site after 24 hours was similar to the number of cells in the opposite tibia that did not undergo clot induction. This effect was confirmed using two more cancer cell lines. Furthermore, no difference in the number of macroscopic lesions or their growth could be detected. In the control group 72% developed a lesion in the left tibia. In the experimental groups with clot formation 79% and 65% developed lesions in the left tibia (p = ns when comparing each experimental group with the controls). Survival was similar too. In summary, the growth factors accumulating in a clot/hematoma are neither enough to promote cancer cell homing nor support growth in an experimental model of breast cancer bone metastasis. This suggests that blood clot formation, as occurs in traumatic fractures, surgical interventions, and bruises, does not increase the risk of metastasis formation."
https://openalex.org/W2081158957,"We demonstrate that a mutant of uracil DNA glycosylase (N123D:L191A) distinguishes between cytosine and methylcytosine. Uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) efficiently removes uracil from DNA in a reaction in which the base is flipped into the enzyme’s active site. Uracil is selected over cytosine by a pattern of specific hydrogen bonds, and thymine is excluded by steric clash of its 5-methyl group with Y66. The N123D mutation generates an enzyme that excises cytosine. This N123D:L191A mutant excises C when it is mispaired with A or opposite an abasic site, but not when it is paired with G. In contrast no cleavage is observed with any substrates that contain 5-methylcytosine. This enzyme may offer a new approach for discriminating between cytosine and 5-methylcytosine."
https://openalex.org/W2051916996,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating adult onset neurodegenerative disease affecting both upper and lower motor neurons. TDP-43, encoded by the TARDBP gene, was identified as a component of motor neuron cytoplasmic inclusions in both familial and sporadic ALS and has become a pathological signature of the disease. TDP-43 is a nuclear protein involved in RNA metabolism, however in ALS, TDP-43 is mislocalized to the cytoplasm of affected motor neurons, suggesting that disease might be caused by TDP-43 loss of function. To investigate this hypothesis, we attempted to generate a mouse conditional knockout of the Tardbp gene using the classical Cre-loxP technology. Even though heterozygote mice for the targeted allele were successfully generated, we were unable to obtain homozygotes. Here we show that although the targeting vector was specifically designed to not overlap with Tardbp adjacent genes, the homologous recombination event affected the expression of a downstream gene, Masp2. This may explain the inability to obtain homozygote mice with targeted Tardbp."
https://openalex.org/W2164658978,"Proteasomes play a fundamental role in intracellular protein degradation and therewith regulate a variety of cellular processes. Exposure of cells to (pro)inflammatory cytokines upregulates the expression of three inducible catalytic proteasome subunits, the immunosubunits, which incorporate into newly assembled proteasome complexes and alter the catalytic activity of the cellular proteasome population. Single gene-deficient mice lacking one of the three immunosubunits are resistant to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis development and, likewise, inhibition of one single immunosubunit protects mice against the development of DSS-induced colitis. The observed diminished disease susceptibility has been attributed to altered cytokine production and CD4+ T-cell differentiation in the absence of immunosubunits. To further test whether the catalytic activity conferred by immunosubunits plays an essential role in CD4+ T-cell function and to distinguish between the role of immunosubunits in effector T-cells versus inflamed tissue, we used a T-cell transfer-induced colitis model. Naïve wt or immunosubunit-deficient CD4+ T-cells were adoptively transferred into RAG1-/- and immunosubunit-deficient RAG1-/- mice and colitis development was determined six weeks later. While immunosubunit expression in recipient mice had no effect on colitis development, transferred immunosubunit-deficient T- cells were more potent in inducing colitis and produced more proinflammatory IL17 than wt T-cells. Taken together, our data show that modifications in proteasome-mediated proteolysis in T-cells, conferred by lack of immunosubunit incorporation, do not attenuate but enhance CD4+ T-cell-induced inflammation."
