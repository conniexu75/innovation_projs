When injected into an early blastocyst, single MAPCs contribute to most, if not all, somatic cell types. On transplantation into a non-irradiated host, MAPCs engraft and differentiate to the haematopoietic lineage, in addition to the epithelium of liver, lung and gut. Engraftment in the haematopoietic system as well as the gastrointestinal tract is increased when MAPCs are transplanted in a minimally irradiated host. As MAPCs proliferate extensively without obvious senescence or loss of differentiation potential, they may be an ideal cell source for therapy of inherited or degenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1982041296,"Light usually diffracts in all directions when it emerges from a subwavelength aperture, which puts a lower limit on the size of features that can be used in photonics. This limitation can be overcome by creating a periodic texture on the exit side of a single aperture in a metal film. The transmitted light emerges from the aperture as a beam with a small angular divergence (approximately +/-3 degrees ) whose directionality can be controlled. This finding is especially surprising, considering that the radiating region is mainly confined to an area with lateral dimensions comparable to the wavelength of the light. The device occupies no more than one cubic micrometer and, when combined with enhanced transmission, suggests that a wide range of photonic applications is possible."

https://openalex.org/W2058713133,"Synthetic bio-nanotube membranes were developed and used to separate two enantiomers of a chiral drug. These membranes are based on alumina films that have cylindrical pores with monodisperse nanoscopic diameters (for example, 20 nanometers). Silica nanotubes were chemically synthesized within the pores of these films, and an antibody that selectively binds one of the enantiomers of the drug was attached to the inner walls of the silica nanotubes. These membranes selectively transport the enantiomer that specifically binds to the antibody, relative to the enantiomer that has lower affinity for the antibody. The solvent dimethyl sulfoxide was used to tune the antibody binding affinity. The enantiomeric selectivity coefficient increases as the inside diameter of the silica nanotubes decreases."

To determine whether direct entorhinal connections support spatial firing and spatial memory, we removed all input from areas CA3 to CA1, thus isolating the CA1 area. Pyramidal cells in the isolated CA1 area developed sharp and stable place fields. Rats with an isolated CA1 area showed normal acquisition of an associative hippocampal-dependent spatial recognition task. Spatial recall was impaired. These results suggest that the hippocampus contains two functionally separable memory circuits: The direct entorhinal-CA1 system is sufficient for recollection-based recognition memory, but recall depends on intact CA3-CA1 connectivity."

Here, we describe a pathogenic interaction between Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans , two opportunistic pathogens. P. aeruginosa forms a dense biofilm on C. albicans filaments and kills the fungus. In contrast, P. aeruginosa neither binds to nor kills yeast-form C. albicans . Several P. aeruginosa virulence factors that are important in disease are involved in the killing of C. albicans filaments.

https://openalex.org/W2018631948,"The Arabidopsis gene DDM1 is required to maintain DNA methylation levels and is responsible for transposon and transgene silencing. However, rather than encoding a DNA methyltransferase, DDM1 has similarity to the SWI/SNF family of adenosine triphosphate–dependent chromatin remodeling genes, suggesting an indirect role in DNA methylation. Here we show that DDM1 is also required to maintain histone H3 methylation patterns. In wild-type heterochromatin, transposons and silent genes are associated with histone H3 methylated at lysine 9, whereas known genes are preferentially associated with methylated lysine 4. In ddm1 heterochromatin, DNA methylation is lost, and methylation of lysine 9 is largely replaced by methylation of lysine 4. Because DNA methylation has recently been shown to depend on histone H3 lysine 9 methylation, our results suggest that transposon methylation may be guided by histone H3 methylation in plant genomes. This would account for the epigenetic inheritance of hypomethylated DNA once histone H3 methylation patterns are altered."
https://openalex.org/W1973341497,"Many biological processes are initiated by cooperative assembly of large multicomponent complexes; however, mechanisms for modulating or terminating the actions of these complexes are not well understood. For example, hormone-bound intracellular receptors (IRs) nucleate formation of transcriptional regulatory complexes whose actions cease promptly upon hormone withdrawal. Here, we show that the p23 molecular chaperone localizes in vivo to genomic response elements in a hormone-dependent manner, disrupting receptor-mediated transcriptional activation in vivo and in vitro; Hsp90 weakly displayed similar activities. Indeed, p23 and Hsp90 also disrupted the activities of some non–IR-containing transcriptional regulatory complexes. We suggest that molecular chaperones promote disassembly of transcriptional regulatory complexes, thus enabling regulatory machineries to detect and respond to signaling changes."

Mitochondria are cellular organelles where vital functions such as electron transfer and oxidative phosphorylation reside. However, accumulating evidence suggests that mitochondria, apart from acting as supplier of ATP in cells, also function as major players in regulation of cell death. This latter role of mitochondria cannot be assigned only to the consequences of their loss of function but rather to their active participation in the cellular death processes. Apoptogenic proteins are present in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, such as cytochrome c (13Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4433) Google Scholar,14Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D.

Med. 1996; 184: 1331-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar), which upon apoptotic stimuli can be released by a still unclear mechanism. The induction of the permeability transition pore (PTP) has been suggested as a model for cytochrome c release. The PTP is comprised of the voltage-dependent anion channel located in the outer mitochondrial membrane and the adenine nucleotide translocator in the inner membrane. Opening of the PTP would allow water and solutes to enter, leading to the swelling of mitochondria and rupture of the outer membrane, thereby releasing the apoptogenic proteins from the mitochondrial intermembrane space. However, it has been reported that the proapoptotic proteins, Bak and Bax from the Bcl-2 family, can bind to the voltage-dependent anion channel and stimulate its opening leading to cytochrome c release (17Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1909) Google Scholar). This model allows for the release of cytochrome c without the extreme morphological changes resulting from the previous model. Apoptosis is a process that requires energy (ATP). Therefore, the levels of ATP can be a crucial determinant of whether the cell dies by apoptosis or necrosis, and therefore, the mitochondria can act as checkpoints in deciding the death pathway. Thus, when cells are depleted of ATP, they will undergo necrosis rather than apoptosis (18Lelli J.L., Jr. Becks L.L. Dabrowska M.I. Hinshaw D.B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 19Stefanelli C. Bonavita F. Stanic I. Farruggia G. Falcieri E. Robuffo I. Pignatti C. Muscari C. Rossoni C. Guarnieri C.

Med. 1997; 185: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). Induction of the PTP is followed by membrane permeability transition (MPT) and subsequent loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Several drugs have been shown to cause mitochondrial membrane potential loss, such as rotenone, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial complex I (21Isenberg J.S. Klaunig J.E. Toxicol. Sci. 2000; 53: 340-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 22Higuchi M. Proske R.J. Yeh E.T. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2515-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and the topoisomerase II poison etoposide, which at low concentrations (10 μm) primarily targets the nucleus, after which the death signal is forwarded to the mitochondria. At higher concentrations (50 μm), however, etoposide directly targets the mitochondria (23Robertson J.D. Gogvadze V. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32438-32443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar).In the present study, we characterize the human mitochondrial Trx2 and investigate its role in the regulation of mitochondrial membrane potential and cell death. We show that overexpression of Trx2 confers resistance toward etoposide-induced cytotoxicity. In contrast, Trx2-overxepressing cells are more sensitive to rotenone. Our evidence also suggests that Trx2 mediates the cytotoxic effects of rotenone by interfering with the ATP synthase activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cells overexpressing Trx2 have an increased mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm).DISCUSSIONTo investigate the function of the mitochondrial thioredoxin in human cells, we cloned the human cDNA coding for hTrx2. The presence of a tentative mitochondrial signal and the absence of structural cysteines, characteristic features of the rat Trx2 (12Spyrou G. Enmark E. Miranda-Vizuete A. Gustafsson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2936-2941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) were also present in the human protein. The full-length protein was 88% homologous to the rat Trx2. However, after the cleavage of the tentative mitochondrial signal, the homology of the mature protein with the rat homologue was 98%. Purified hTrx2 protein was able to reduce insulin, and this activity was not dependent on the oxidative status of the protein, unlike that of Trx1. This difference between Trx1 and Trx2 might be an important factor in the function of Trx2. Using Northern analysis and immunohistochemistry, we determined the level of Trx2 mRNA in various tissues. hTrx2 expression is high in tissues with increased metabolic activities such as stomach, testis, ovary, liver, heart, neurons, and adrenal gland; however, Trx2 appears to be ubiquitously expressed.Because Trx2 can reduce disulfide bonds, it is an excellent candidate for mediating key functions in mitochondria by redox control, such as mitochondrial membrane potential and resistance to anticancer drugs that act via the mitochondria. A cytotoxic compound that has been shown to trigger MPT and disruption of the ΔΨm is etoposide (23Robertson J.D. Gogvadze V. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32438-32443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Using Trx2-overexpressing cells, we investigated the possibility that Trx2 is able to protect against the cytotoxic effects of this drug. Indeed, cells overexpressing Trx2 were found to be more resistant against etoposide-induced lethality. Therefore, we went on to test the effect of Trx2 overexpression on the action of other drugs that directly target mitochondria, such as mitochondrial respiration inhibitors. Surprisingly, when complex I was inhibited using rotenone, HEK-Trx2 cells showed a higher rate of cell death than control cells. This difference was not shown when complexes II and III were inhibited with TTFA and antimycin A, suggesting a specific role for complex I. Could it be that thioredoxin needs a functional respiratory chain (through complex II) to promote its cytotoxic effect? To address this question, we inhibited the respiratory chain completely by using rotenone together with TTFA. Once again there was a difference in survival between the overexpressing and the control cell line, respectively, when using rotenone alone. Thus, simultaneous inhibition of complexes I and II was less lethal than inhibition of complex II alone in control cells suggesting that TTFA cytotoxicity requires the function of the respiratory chain through complex I.One possible explanation of the above results could be the induction of MPT. Rotenone has been shown to induce MPT (21Isenberg J.S. Klaunig J.E. Toxicol. Sci. 2000; 53: 340-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 22Higuchi M. Proske R.J. Yeh E.T. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2515-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) by a still unclear mechanism. A major regulator of the MPT is the PTP, which was found to be redox-sensitive because an oxidizing environment increases the permeability, whereas a reducing environment closes the pore (29Petronilli V. Costantini P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Passamonti S. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16638-16642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Fagian M.M. Pereira-da-Silva L. Martins I.S. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19955-19960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Valle V.G. Fagian M.M. Parentoni L.S. Meinicke A.R. Vercesi A.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 307: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Thus, Trx2 could inhibit MPT by reducing redox-sensitive cysteines. However, the change in ΔΨm in control and HEK-Trx2 cells under rotenone treatment was not sufficient to explain the difference in cellular viability.Contrary to our observations with rotenone, Trx2 offers protection against the cytotoxic effects of etoposide, confirming that mitochondria are targets for the etoposide cell-killing mechanism and suggesting that Trx2 might play an important role in the etoposide resistance. Etoposide has also been shown to cause the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (32Mantymaa P. Siitonen T. Guttorm T. Saily M. Kinnula V. Savolainen E.R. Koistinen P. Br. J. Haematol. 2000; 108: 574-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Trx2 has been reported to regulate the formation of ROS (33Tanaka T. Hosoi F. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Nakamura H. Masutani H. Ueda S. Nishiyama A. Takeda S. Wada H. Spyrou G. Ydoi J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Thus, by overexpressing Trx2, the formation of ROS might be minimized thereby protecting the cells against etoposide cytotoxicity. Accordingly, Trx2 could prevent etoposide-induced lethality in several ways, e.g. through regulation of the ΔΨm or scavenging of ROS. Trx2 could directly act as a ROS scavenger similarly to Trx1 or indirectly through the mitochondrial thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase (34Yamamoto T. Matsui Y. Natori S. Obinata M. Gene. 1989; 80: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 35Watabe S. Hiroi T. Yamamoto Y. Fujioka Y. Hasegawa H. Yago N. Takahashi S.Y. Eur. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2271-2278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).Our present study suggests the involvement of ATP synthase in rotenone-induced cell death in Trx2-overexpressing cells. Following blocking of the ATP synthase with oligomycin, the rate of cell death in the Trx2 cells was similar to that of the control cells, suggesting that the hypersensitivity toward rotenone could be due to modification of the ATP synthase activity by Trx2. Also, treatment with oligomycin caused a decrease of ΔΨm in HEK-Trx2 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that the higher ΔΨmobserved in the HEK-Trx2 cells is due to the modulation of ATP synthase activity by Trx2.In the chloroplast ATP synthase thiol modulation is possible due to a sequence motif of nine amino acids including two cysteines in the γ subunit of chloroplast F1 (27Moroney J.V. Fullmer C.S. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7281-7285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This amino acid segment is only found in higher plants (37Miki J. Maeda M. Mukohata Y. Futai M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 232: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and green algae (38Yu L.M. Selman B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19342-19345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that only chlorophyll a + b plants are capable of this specific mechanism of thiol modulation. However, Trx2 might not act by reducing thiols in proteins comprising the ATP synthase complex but rather have an indirect effect on the ATP synthase complex. One indirect effect of Trx2 on the ATP synthase activity could be mediated by the recently described Factor B (39Belogrudov G.I. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6097-6103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Factor B is an activator/modulator of ATP synthase and is inhibited by monothiol- and especially dithiol-modifying reagents. Thus, Trx2 by reducing Factor B could affect the ATP synthase activity.It has been reported that ATP synthase is essential for the function of the proapoptotic protein Bax in yeast and mammalian cells, but the mechanism behind it is unclear (40Matsuyama S., Xu, Q. Velours J. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 327-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). However, it has been speculated that when Bax forms channels on the outer membrane, the mitochondria might start leaking protons after which the ATPase could, due to low proton concentration in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, start running in reverse leading to alkalization of the matrix. Such an alkalization has been shown to induce MPT in both mammalian and yeast mitochondria. Is it possible that Trx2 might promote the reverse action of ATPase, thereby enhancing the ATPase-dependent cell death? When mitochondria are blocked at complex I or simultaneously at I and II, a lower proton gradient might be established causing the reverse reaction of ATPase so that the ΔΨm is maintained. If Trx2 could indeed promote the proton export from the matrix with the ATPase, the cytotoxic response would be enhanced in the overexpressing cells. This might also explain the decrease of the cytotoxicity by rotenone when co-treating with oligomycin.Our results with the HEK-293-overexpressing cells suggest that the high levels of Trx2 may allow cells with mitochondrial dysfunctions to proliferate and ultimately form tumors because of deficient apoptosis. To gain support for this hypothesis we analyzed a human brain tumor panel. Normal brain had almost no staining in glial cells, whereas different types of tumors (e.g. astrocytoma, glioblastoma, oligodendroglioma, ependymoma, and meningioma cells) showed strong labeling for Trx2. 2M. Pelto-Huikko and G. Spyrou, manuscript in preparation. Trx2 is a ubiquitously expressed protein found in all human tissues examined. Is it possible that there exists a tissue/cell-specific regulation of Trx2? Our results using rats fed with dexamethasone showed that Trx2 mRNA was only up-regulated in specific regions (paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and the reticular thalamic nucleus) in the brain, whereas the cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala were unaffected (41Rybnikova E. Damdimopoulos A.E. Gustafsson J.A. Spyrou G. Pelto-Huikko M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 1669-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).In summary, all data mentioned above suggest that Trx2 plays an important role in mitochondria. Our current working model suggests that Trx2 has an anti-apoptotic function. Decreased levels of Trx2 may result in increased ROS, higher apoptotic rates, and slower growth. On the other hand, increased levels result in higher membrane potential and increased resistance to anti-tumor agents. Thus, levels of Trx2 may be modulated to control the apoptotic state of the cell. More studies are needed to provide knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of Trx2 actions. Thioredoxins (Trx)1 are a class of small multifunctional 12-kDa proteins that are present in all prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms and are characterized by the redox active site Trp-Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys. In the oxidized (inactive) form of Trx (Trx-S2), the two cysteines at the active site form a disulfide that is reduced by thioredoxin reductase and NADPH, the thioredoxin system, to a dithiol (Trx-(SH)2) (1Powis G. Montfort W.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 261-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 2Arner E.S. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar), which can then act as a general protein disulfide reductase. Mammalian cytosolic thioredoxin, originally identified for its ability to act as hydrogen donor for ribonucleotide reductase, has a variety of biological activities (1Powis G. Montfort W.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 261-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 2Arner E.S. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar). It serves as a cofactor for methionine sulfoxide reductase, catalyzes reduction of protein disulfide bonds, participates in folding of proteins and protein stability, modulates the DNA binding activity of receptors and some transcription factors (3Huang L.E.

Miranda-Vizuete A. Gustafsson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2936-2941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Mitochondria are cellular organelles where vital functions such as electron transfer and oxidative phosphorylation reside. However, accumulating evidence suggests that mitochondria, apart from acting as supplier of ATP in cells, also function as major players in regulation of cell death. This latter role of mitochondria cannot be assigned only to the consequences of their loss of function but rather to their active participation in the cellular death processes. Apoptogenic proteins are present in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, such as cytochrome c (13Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4433) Google Scholar,14Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4254) Google Scholar) and apoptosis-inducing factor (15Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Marchetti P. Hirsch T. Gomez-Monterrey I. Castedo M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1533-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar, 16Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Castedo M. Hirsch T. Marchetti P. Macho A. Daugas E. Geuskens M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1331-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar), which upon apoptotic stimuli can be released by a still unclear mechanism. The induction of the permeability transition pore (PTP) has been suggested as a model for cytochrome c release. The PTP is comprised of the voltage-dependent anion channel located in the outer mitochondrial membrane and the adenine nucleotide translocator in the inner membrane. Opening of the PTP would allow water and solutes to enter, leading to the swelling of mitochondria and rupture of the outer membrane, thereby releasing the apoptogenic proteins from the mitochondrial intermembrane space. However, it has been reported that the proapoptotic proteins, Bak and Bax from the Bcl-2 family, can bind to the voltage-dependent anion channel and stimulate its opening leading to cytochrome c release (17Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1909) Google Scholar). This model allows for the release of cytochrome c without the extreme morphological changes resulting from the previous model. Apoptosis is a process that requires energy (ATP). Therefore, the levels of ATP can be a crucial determinant of whether the cell dies by apoptosis or necrosis, and therefore, the mitochondria can act as checkpoints in deciding the death pathway. Thus, when cells are depleted of ATP, they will undergo necrosis rather than apoptosis (18Lelli J.L., Jr. Becks L.L. Dabrowska M.I. Hinshaw D.B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 19Stefanelli C. Bonavita F. Stanic I. Farruggia G. Falcieri E. Robuffo I. Pignatti C. Muscari C. Rossoni C. Guarnieri C.

Med. 1997; 185: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). Induction of the PTP is followed by membrane permeability transition (MPT) and subsequent loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Several drugs have been shown to cause mitochondrial membrane potential loss, such as rotenone, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial complex I (21Isenberg J.S. Klaunig J.E. Toxicol. Sci. 2000; 53: 340-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 22Higuchi M. Proske R.J. Yeh E.T. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2515-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and the topoisomerase II poison etoposide, which at low concentrations (10 μm) primarily targets the nucleus, after which the death signal is forwarded to the mitochondria. At higher concentrations (50 μm), however, etoposide directly targets the mitochondria (23Robertson J.D. Gogvadze V. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32438-32443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In the present study, we characterize the human mitochondrial Trx2 and investigate its role in the regulation of mitochondrial membrane potential and cell death. We show that overexpression of Trx2 confers resistance toward etoposide-induced cytotoxicity. In contrast, Trx2-overxepressing cells are more sensitive to rotenone. Our evidence also suggests that Trx2 mediates the cytotoxic effects of rotenone by interfering with the ATP synthase activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cells overexpressing Trx2 have an increased mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm). DISCUSSIONTo investigate the function of the mitochondrial thioredoxin in human cells, we cloned the human cDNA coding for hTrx2. The presence of a tentative mitochondrial signal and the absence of structural cysteines, characteristic features of the rat Trx2 (12Spyrou G. Enmark E. Miranda-Vizuete A. Gustafsson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2936-2941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) were also present in the human protein. The full-length protein was 88% homologous to the rat Trx2. However, after the cleavage of the tentative mitochondrial signal, the homology of the mature protein with the rat homologue was 98%. Purified hTrx2 protein was able to reduce insulin, and this activity was not dependent on the oxidative status of the protein, unlike that of Trx1. This difference between Trx1 and Trx2 might be an important factor in the function of Trx2. Using Northern analysis and immunohistochemistry, we determined the level of Trx2 mRNA in various tissues. hTrx2 expression is high in tissues with increased metabolic activities such as stomach, testis, ovary, liver, heart, neurons, and adrenal gland; however, Trx2 appears to be ubiquitously expressed.Because Trx2 can reduce disulfide bonds, it is an excellent candidate for mediating key functions in mitochondria by redox control, such as mitochondrial membrane potential and resistance to anticancer drugs that act via the mitochondria. A cytotoxic compound that has been shown to trigger MPT and disruption of the ΔΨm is etoposide (23Robertson J.D. Gogvadze V. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32438-32443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Using Trx2-overexpressing cells, we investigated the possibility that Trx2 is able to protect against the cytotoxic effects of this drug. Indeed, cells overexpressing Trx2 were found to be more resistant against etoposide-induced lethality. Therefore, we went on to test the effect of Trx2 overexpression on the action of other drugs that directly target mitochondria, such as mitochondrial respiration inhibitors. Surprisingly, when complex I was inhibited using rotenone, HEK-Trx2 cells showed a higher rate of cell death than control cells. This difference was not shown when complexes II and III were inhibited with TTFA and antimycin A, suggesting a specific role for complex I. Could it be that thioredoxin needs a functional respiratory chain (through complex II) to promote its cytotoxic effect? To address this question, we inhibited the respiratory chain completely by using rotenone together with TTFA. Once again there was a difference in survival between the overexpressing and the control cell line, respectively, when using rotenone alone. Thus, simultaneous inhibition of complexes I and II was less lethal than inhibition of complex II alone in control cells suggesting that TTFA cytotoxicity requires the function of the respiratory chain through complex I.One possible explanation of the above results could be the induction of MPT. Rotenone has been shown to induce MPT (21Isenberg J.S. Klaunig J.E. Toxicol. Sci. 2000; 53: 340-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 22Higuchi M. Proske R.J. Yeh E.T. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2515-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) by a still unclear mechanism. A major regulator of the MPT is the PTP, which was found to be redox-sensitive because an oxidizing environment increases the permeability, whereas a reducing environment closes the pore (29Petronilli V. Costantini P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Passamonti S. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16638-16642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Fagian M.M. Pereira-da-Silva L. Martins I.S.

Biophys. 1993; 307: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Thus, Trx2 could inhibit MPT by reducing redox-sensitive cysteines. However, the change in ΔΨm in control and HEK-Trx2 cells under rotenone treatment was not sufficient to explain the difference in cellular viability.Contrary to our observations with rotenone, Trx2 offers protection against the cytotoxic effects of etoposide, confirming that mitochondria are targets for the etoposide cell-killing mechanism and suggesting that Trx2 might play an important role in the etoposide resistance. Etoposide has also been shown to cause the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (32Mantymaa P. Siitonen T. Guttorm T. Saily M. Kinnula V. Savolainen E.R. Koistinen P. Br. J. Haematol. 2000; 108: 574-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Trx2 has been reported to regulate the formation of ROS (33Tanaka T. Hosoi F. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Nakamura H. Masutani H. Ueda S. Nishiyama A. Takeda S. Wada H. Spyrou G. Ydoi J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Thus, by overexpressing Trx2, the formation of ROS might be minimized thereby protecting the cells against etoposide cytotoxicity. Accordingly, Trx2 could prevent etoposide-induced lethality in several ways, e.g. through regulation of the ΔΨm or scavenging of ROS. Trx2 could directly act as a ROS scavenger similarly to Trx1 or indirectly through the mitochondrial thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase (34Yamamoto T. Matsui Y. Natori S. Obinata M. Gene. 1989; 80: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 35Watabe S. Hiroi T. Yamamoto Y. Fujioka Y. Hasegawa H. Yago N. Takahashi S.Y. Eur. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2271-2278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).Our present study suggests the involvement of ATP synthase in rotenone-induced cell death in Trx2-overexpressing cells. Following blocking of the ATP synthase with oligomycin, the rate of cell death in the Trx2 cells was similar to that of the control cells, suggesting that the hypersensitivity toward rotenone could be due to modification of the ATP synthase activity by Trx2. Also, treatment with oligomycin caused a decrease of ΔΨm in HEK-Trx2 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that the higher ΔΨmobserved in the HEK-Trx2 cells is due to the modulation of ATP synthase activity by Trx2.In the chloroplast ATP synthase thiol modulation is possible due to a sequence motif of nine amino acids including two cysteines in the γ subunit of chloroplast F1 (27Moroney J.V. Fullmer C.S. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7281-7285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This amino acid segment is only found in higher plants (37Miki J. Maeda M. Mukohata Y. Futai M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 232: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and green algae (38Yu L.M. Selman B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19342-19345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that only chlorophyll a + b plants are capable of this specific mechanism of thiol modulation. However, Trx2 might not act by reducing thiols in proteins comprising the ATP synthase complex but rather have an indirect effect on the ATP synthase complex. One indirect effect of Trx2 on the ATP synthase activity could be mediated by the recently described Factor B (39Belogrudov G.I. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6097-6103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Factor B is an activator/modulator of ATP synthase and is inhibited by monothiol- and especially dithiol-modifying reagents. Thus, Trx2 by reducing Factor B could affect the ATP synthase activity.It has been reported that ATP synthase is essential for the function of the proapoptotic protein Bax in yeast and mammalian cells, but the mechanism behind it is unclear (40Matsuyama S., Xu, Q. Velours J. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 327-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). However, it has been speculated that when Bax forms channels on the outer membrane, the mitochondria might start leaking protons after which the ATPase could, due to low proton concentration in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, start running in reverse leading to alkalization of the matrix. Such an alkalization has been shown to induce MPT in both mammalian and yeast mitochondria. Is it possible that Trx2 might promote the reverse action of ATPase, thereby enhancing the ATPase-dependent cell death? When mitochondria are blocked at complex I or simultaneously at I and II, a lower proton gradient might be established causing the reverse reaction of ATPase so that the ΔΨm is maintained. If Trx2 could indeed promote the proton export from the matrix with the ATPase, the cytotoxic response would be enhanced in the overexpressing cells. This might also explain the decrease of the cytotoxicity by rotenone when co-treating with oligomycin.Our results with the HEK-293-overexpressing cells suggest that the high levels of Trx2 may allow cells with mitochondrial dysfunctions to proliferate and ultimately form tumors because of deficient apoptosis. To gain support for this hypothesis we analyzed a human brain tumor panel. Normal brain had almost no staining in glial cells, whereas different types of tumors (e.g. astrocytoma, glioblastoma, oligodendroglioma, ependymoma, and meningioma cells) showed strong labeling for Trx2. 2M. Pelto-Huikko and G. Spyrou, manuscript in preparation. Trx2 is a ubiquitously expressed protein found in all human tissues examined. Is it possible that there exists a tissue/cell-specific regulation of Trx2? Our results using rats fed with dexamethasone showed that Trx2 mRNA was only up-regulated in specific regions (paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and the reticular thalamic nucleus) in the brain, whereas the cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala were unaffected (41Rybnikova E. Damdimopoulos A.E. Gustafsson J.A. Spyrou G. Pelto-Huikko M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 1669-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).In summary, all data mentioned above suggest that Trx2 plays an important role in mitochondria. Our current working model suggests that Trx2 has an anti-apoptotic function. Decreased levels of Trx2 may result in increased ROS, higher apoptotic rates, and slower growth. On the other hand, increased levels result in higher membrane potential and increased resistance to anti-tumor agents. Thus, levels of Trx2 may be modulated to control the apoptotic state of the cell. More studies are needed to provide knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of Trx2 actions.

In summary, all data mentioned above suggest that Trx2 plays an important role in mitochondria. Our current working model suggests that Trx2 has an anti-apoptotic function. Decreased levels of Trx2 may result in increased ROS, higher apoptotic rates, and slower growth. On the other hand, increased levels result in higher membrane potential and increased resistance to anti-tumor agents. Thus, levels of Trx2 may be modulated to control the apoptotic state of the cell. More studies are needed to provide knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of Trx2 actions."
https://openalex.org/W2076558555,"At 8 to 15 kilometers wide, Ma'adim Vallis is one of the largest valleys in the martian highlands. Although a groundwater source was previously suggested, the channel originates at a spillway in the divide of a approximately 3,000,000-square-kilometer closed drainage basin. The interior morphology of this source basin, including likely shoreline features following topographic contours, suggests that Ma'adim Vallis was created through catastrophic overflow of a approximately 1,100,000-square-kilometer highland lake. The size, constant levels, and interior morphology of three regional paleolake basins require a warmer paleoclimate and a long-term, recharged, stable highland water table more than approximately 3.5 billion years ago."

Electron microscopy has revealed that purified poliovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase forms planar and tubular oligomeric arrays. The structural integrity of these arrays correlates with cooperative RNA binding and RNA elongation and is sensitive to mutations that disrupt intermolecular contacts predicted by the polymerase structure. Membranous vesicles isolated from poliovirus-infected cells contain structures consistent with the presence of two-dimensional polymerase arrays on their surfaces during infection. Therefore, host cytoplasmic membranes may function as physical foundations for two-dimensional polymerase arrays, conferring the advantages of surface catalysis to viral RNA replication."

The unique heparan sulfate saccharide sequence offers the binding site for viral envelope proteins and plays critical roles in assisting viral infections. A specific 3-O-sulfated heparan sulfate is known to facilitate the entry of herpes simplex virus 1 into cells. The 3-O-sulfated heparan sulfate is generated by the heparan sulfate d-glucosaminyl-3-O-sulfotransferase isoform 3 (3-OST-3), and it provides binding sites for viral glycoprotein D (gD). Here, we report the purification and structural characterization of an oligosaccharide that binds to gD. The isolated gD-binding site is an octasaccharide, and has a binding affinity to gD around 18 μm, as determined by affinity coelectrophoresis. The octasaccharide was prepared and purified from a heparan sulfate oligosaccharide library that was modified by purified 3-OST-3 enzyme. The molecular mass of the isolated octasaccharide was determined using both nanoelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. The results from the sequence analysis suggest that the structure of the octasaccharide is a heptasulfated octasaccharide.

HS is initially synthesized as a copolymer of glucuronic acid and N-acetylated glucosamine by d-glucuronyl andN-acetyl-d-glucosaminyl transferase, followed by various modifications (6Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). These modifications include C5-epimerization of glucuronic acid to form iduronic acid residues, 2-O-sulfation of iduronic and glucuronic acid,N-deacetylation and N-sulfation of glucosamine, as well as 6-O-sulfation and 3-O-sulfation of glucosamine. Numerous HS biosynthetic enzymes have been cloned and characterized (for review, see Esko and Lindahl (7Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar)). The specific sulfated saccharide sequences play critical roles in determining the functions of HS. A recent report suggests that the expression levels of various isoforms of each class of HS biosynthetic enzyme contribute to the synthesis of specific saccharide sequences in specific tissues (8Liu J. Shworak N.W. Sinay¨ P. Schwartz J.J. Zhang L. Fritze L.M.S. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5185-5192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). HSN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase, 3-O-sulfotransferase, and 6-O-sulfotransferase are present in multiple isoforms, and each isoform is believed to recognize the saccharide sequence around the modification site to generate a specific sulfated saccharide sequence (8Liu J.

For instance, HS d-glucosaminyl-3-O-sulfotransferase (3-OST) isoforms generate 3-O-sulfated glucosamine that is linked to different sulfated uronic acid residues. 3-OST-1 transfers sulfate to the 3-OH position of the N-sulfated glucosamine residue that is linked to a glucuronic acid residue at the nonreducing end (GlcUA-GlcNS ± 6S), whereas, 3-OST-3 transfers sulfate to the 3-OH position of the N-unsubstituted glucosamine residue that is linked to a 2-O-sulfated iduronic acid at the nonreducing end (IdoUA2S-GlcNH2 ± 6S) (11Liu J.

The difference in substrate specificity of 3-OSTs results in distinct biological functions of the HS modified by 3-OSTs. For example, HS modified by 3-OST-1 binds to antithrombin and has anticoagulant activity (12Liu J. Shworak N.W. Fritze L.M.S. Edelberg J.M. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27072-27082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), whereas the HS modified by 3-OST-3 binds to herpes simplex 1 envelope glycoprotein D (gD) and assists in viral entry (13Shukla D. Liu J. Blaiklock P. Shworak N.W. Bai X. Esko J.D. Cohen G.H. Eisenberg R.J. Rosenberg R.D. Spear P.G. Cell. 1999; 99: 13-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a member of the herpesvirus family, and infection in humans is prevalent. HSV-1 infection requires a two-step process that can be separated experimentally: attachment to cells and entry into cells (14Spear P.G. Eisenberg R.J. Cohen G.H. Virology. 2000; 275: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). It is now known that HS is involved in assisting viral binding as well as viral entry (15Shukla D. Spear P.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). HSV-1 binds to host cells through an interaction of virion envelope glycoprotein C (gC), or in some cases of glycoprotein B (gB), with HS (16Mettenleiter T.C. Virology. 1989; 171: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 17Herold B.C. WuDunn D. Soltys N. Spear P.G. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1090-1098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Trybala E. Bergstrom T. Svennerholm B. Jeansson S. Glorioso J.C. Olofsson S. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 743-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Structural analysis of gC-binding HS revealed that a minimum of 10–12 sugar residues containing IdoUA2S and GlcNS(or Ac)6S are necessary (19Feyzi E. Trybala E. Bergstrom T. Lindahl U. Spillmann D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24850-24857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and this conclusion was confirmed by another study (20Herold B. Gerber S.I. Belval B.J. Siston A.M. Shulman N. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3461-3469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A recent report suggests that a specific 3-O-sulfated HS is involved in assisting HSV-1 entry (13Shukla D. Liu J. Blaiklock P. Shworak N.W. Bai X. Esko J.D. Cohen G.H. Eisenberg R.J. Rosenberg R.D. Spear P.G. Cell. 1999; 99: 13-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). The 3-O-sulfated HS is generated by 3-OST-3, but not by 3-OST-1. It should be noted that 3-OST-3-modified HS is rarely found in HS from natural sources, suggesting that HSV-1 recognizes a unique saccharide structure (11Liu J. Shriver Z. Blaiklock P. Yoshida K. Sasisekharan R. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38155-38162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition, a biochemical study revealed that 3-O-sulfated HS provides binding sites for HSV-1 envelope glycoprotein gD, which is a key viral protein involved in entry of HSV-1. It is believed that the interaction between gD and the 3-O-sulfated HS triggers the fusion between the virus and the cell in the presence of other viral envelope proteins, including gB, gH, and gL, via an uncharacterized mechanism. The study of the crystal structure of gD and herpes entry receptor HveA suggest that the binding of HveA to gD induces conformational changes in gD (21Carfi A. Willis S.H. Whitbeck J.C. Krummenacher C. Cohen G.H. Eisenberg R.J. Wiley D.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). This study also predicts a 3-O-sulfated HS-binding pocket on gD near the HveA-binding site (21Carfi A. Willis S.H. Whitbeck J.C. Krummenacher C. Cohen G.H. Eisenberg R.J. Wiley D.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The exact carbohydrate sequence of the gD-binding site in 3-O-sulfated HS remains to be investigated. In this article, we report the characterization of the structure of a gD-binding octasaccharide. The results from extensive sequencing analysis suggest that the structure of the gD-binding octasaccharide is ΔUA-GlcNS-IdoUA2S-GlcNAc-UA2S- GlcNS-IdoUA2S-GlcNH23S6S (residue 1 is GlcNH23S6S and residue 8 is ΔUA). The octasaccharide apparently has two motifs: a relatively low sulfation domain (residues 5–8) that contains two sulfate groups and a high sulfation domain (residue 1 to residue 4) that contains five sulfate groups. Although we still do not know the contribution of each sulfate group to the binding affinity of the octasaccharide and gD, the results from this study will provide the structural information to understand HS-assisted viral infection mechanisms. Recombinant 3-OST-3A and 3-OST-1 enzymes were expressed in Sf9 cells using baculovirus expression system. The enzymes were purified by using heparin-Toyopearl and 3′,5′-ADP-agarose chromatographies as described previously (11Liu J. Shriver Z. Blaiklock P. Yoshida K. Sasisekharan R. Rosenberg R.D. J.

[35S]PAPS was prepared by incubating 0.4 mCi/ml [35S]Na2SO4 (carrier-free, ICN) and 16 mm ATP with 5 mg/ml dialyzed yeast extract (Sigma) (12Liu J. Shworak N.W. Fritze L.M.S. Edelberg J.M.

Iduronate-2-sulfatase, α-iduronidase, α-N-acetylglucosaminidase, glucosamine-6-sulfatase, and sulfamidase were obtained from Glyko. Recombinant heparin lyase I (EC4.2.2.7), II (no EC number), and III (E.C. 4.2.2.8) were prepared as described previously (23Godavarti R. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 248-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Δ4,5-Glycuronidase was isolated from Flavobacterium heparinum (24McLean M.W. Bruce J.S. Long W.F. Williamson F.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 145: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). HS from bovine kidney was obtained from ICN. A truncated form of herpes simplex virus 1 glycoprotein D, gD-1-(306t), and monoclonal anti-gD-(DL6) were prepared as previously described (25Nicola A.V. Willis S.H. Naidoo N.N. Eisenberg R.J. Cohen G.H. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3815-3822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The library was prepared by incubating HS with limited amounts of heparin lyase III followed by size fractionation on a Bio-Gel P-6 (Bio-Rad) column as described by Pye et al. (26Pye D.A. Vives R.R. Turnbull J.E. Hyde P. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22936-22942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In a typical preparation, HS from bovine kidney (1 mg) was incubated with 2 milliunits of heparin lyase III in 1 ml of buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.0, at 37 °C overnight. The digestion was terminated by heating at 100 °C for 15 min. The sample was then loaded on a Bio-Gel P-6 (0.75 × 200 cm) equilibrated with 0.5 m ammonium bicarbonate at a flow rate of 5 ml/h and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. The absorbance at 232 nm was measured for each fraction. Peaks corresponding to tetra- to greater than dodecasaccharides were pooled individually, and dialyzed against 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate using MWCO 3,500 membrane. Each pool was dried on a Speed-Vac concentrator (Labconco) and reconstituted in 50 μl of water. The optical density (232 nm) of the resultant solution was about 3. We processed a total of 40 mg of HS to obtain a sufficient amount of gD-binding octasaccharide for the structural analysis. To prepare 3-OST-3A-modified HS oligosaccharide, 20 μl of the oligosaccharide library or intact HS (1 μg) was mixed with 240 ng of purified 3-OST-3A enzyme and 10 μm [35S]PAPS (14,000 dpm/pmol) in a buffer containing 50 mm MES, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mmMnCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 168 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7, in a final volume of 50 μl. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and was then heated at 100 °C for 2 min. The resultant solution was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 1 min to remove insoluble materials. The supernatant was dialyzed against 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate using MWCO 3,500 membrane and dried. To prepare 3-OST-1-modified oligosaccharides, we followed nearly identical procedures except for omitting the 150 mmNaCl and using 70 ng of 3-OST-1 enzyme during the enzymatic modification reaction. The 3-OST-3-modified oligosaccharides were applied to a silica-based polyamine (PAMN) HPLC column (0.46 × 25 cm, Waters). The column was eluted with a linear gradient of KH2PO4 from 350 mm to 1m for 60 min followed by an additional wash with 1m KH2PO4 for 20 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min (11Liu J. Shriver Z. Blaiklock P. Yoshida K. Sasisekharan R. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38155-38162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The fractions containing35S-radioactivity were pooled separately and resolved on Bio-Gel P-6. The fractions were dialyzed against 25 mmammonium acetate using MWCO 3,500 membrane and dried. They were further purified by DEAE-NPR HPLC chromatography (0.46 × 7.5 cm, Tosohaas). The DEAE-NPR column was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, from 100 to 500 mm in 60 min followed by an additional wash for 20 min with 1 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The eluted oligosaccharides were monitored by35S-radioactivity and the absorbance at 232 nm. We obtained about 200 to 300 pmol of purified 35S-labeled oligosaccharides from 20 mg of HS that was partially digested with heparin lyase III. We did observe a UV peak that overlapped with the35S-radioactive peak when a large amount of 3-O-35S-sulfated oligosaccharides (>200 pmol) were injected on DEAE-NPR-HPLC. The assay for determining the binding of 3-O-sulfated HS oligosaccharides to gD was carried out by an immunoprecipitation procedure using gD and anti-gD monoclonal antibody as described previously but at a lower pH (13Shukla D. Liu J. Blaiklock P. Shworak N.W. Bai X. Esko J.D. Cohen G.H. Eisenberg R.J. Rosenberg R.D. Spear P.G. Cell. 1999; 99: 13-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3-O-sulfated HS (1–10 pmol) was incubated in 50 μl of buffer containing 50 mm MES and 0.01% Triton, pH 6 (binding buffer), and 2 mg/ml gD at room temperature for 30 min. The anti-gD monoclonal antibody DL6 (5 μl) was added and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h followed by addition of the protein A-agarose gel (80 μl of 1:1 slurry) and agitated at 4 °C for an additional hour. The protein A-agarose gel (Pierce) was then washed with 0, 50, 150, and 500 mm NaCl in the above binding buffer. The binding affinity between 3-O-sulfated oligosaccharides and gD was determined using affinity co-electrophoresis, as previously described (13Shukla D. Liu J. Blaiklock P. Shworak N.W. Bai X. Esko J.D. Cohen G.H. Eisenberg R.J. Rosenberg R.D. Spear P.G. Cell. 1999; 99: 13-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). The gel was dried and analyzed on a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences, Storm 860) to determine the migration of [35S]oligosaccharides. The 35S-intensity was plotted against the migration distance through the separation zone to define the distance migrated in the presence or absence of gD. The conditions for digestion with Δ4,5-glycuronidase and HS glycuronate-2-sulfatase were described elsewhere (27Zhang L. Yoshida K. Liu J. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5681-5691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The conditions for the nitrous acid degradations under pH 1.5 and 4.5 were described in a prior publication (8Liu J. Shworak N.W. Sinay¨ P. Schwartz J.J. Zhang L. Fritze L.M.S. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5185-5192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The degraded octasaccharide was analyzed by DEAE-NPR-HPLC. The oligosaccharide (5 × 105 to 1 × 106 cpm, 36–72 pmol) was dissolved in 20 μl of a solvent containingN′,N′-dimethylformamide and triethylamine (1:1, v/v) and 5 μl of acetic anhydride, and incubated on ice for 1 h. Tris (20 μl of 50 mm) was then added and the reaction mixture was incubated on ice for an additional hour. The sample was then diluted with 10 volumes of water and dialyzed against 50 mmammonium bicarbonate using a MWCO 3,500 membrane. Derivatizations were carried out by reacting 5 μl of oligosaccharide solution with 5 μl of 50 mm semicarbazide and 60 mm Tris acetic acid (pH 7.0, prepared fresh daily) for 16 h at 30 °C. Two mass spectrometry techniques, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) and nanoelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry (nESI-MS), were employed. The MALDI-MS spectra were acquired in the linear mode using a Perseptive Biosystems Voyager Elite reflectron time-of-flight instrument fitted with a 337-nm laser as described elsewhere (28Shriver Z. Raman R. Venkataraman G. Drummond K. Turnbull J. Toida T. Linhardt R. Biemann K. Sasisekharan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10359-10364Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The nESI-MS analysis was carried out using a Micromass Quattro II with QhQ geometry, a Z-spray source, and pulled borosilicate glass nanovials (29Pope M. Raska C. Thorp S.C. Liu J. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the neutral loss scan, MS/MS spectra were obtained by scanning Q1 and Q3 with an offset of 26.7 or 20 m/z in their scan cycles, corresponding to the loss of sulfate from the triple or quadruple charged octasaccharide, respectively (29Pope M. Raska C. Thorp S.C. Liu J. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To obtain a high quality nESI-MS spectrum, the purified octasaccharide was further dialyzed against 25 mm ammonium acetate (purity of ammonium acetate is 99.9999%, Aldrich) using MWCO 13,000 hollow fiber dialysis tubing (Spectrum). Control studies showed that 80–95% of 3-O-[35S]pentasaccharide (Mr = 1507) could be recovered using this dialysis tubing. The approach for the analysis of oligosaccharides followed a previously described method with modifications (30Rhomberg A.J. Ernst S. Sasisekharan R. Biemann K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4176-4181Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, the analysis was carried out on a Beckman P/ACE MDQ unit using an uncoated fused silica capillary (inner diameter = 75 μm;Ltot = 106 cm). Hydrodynamic injection was employed under 9.5 p.s.i. for 5 s. About 274 nl of the sample was calculated to be injected by CE Expert software. The electrolyte was a solution of 10 μm dextran sulfate and 50 mm Tris-phosphoric acid, pH 2.5. Separation was carried out at 25 kV. A gD-binding octasaccharide was purified from a 3-OST-3A-modified HS oligosaccharide library. The HS oligosaccharide library was prepared by incubating HS with a limited amount of heparin lyase III. The resultant material was fractionated by a Bio-Gel P-6 column based upon the size of the oligosaccharides, obtaining di-, tetra,-, … , dodeca-, and >dodecasaccharides (data not shown), and a similar approach to prepare a HS oligosaccharide library was reported by Pye and colleagues (26Pye D.A. Vives R.R. Turnbull J.E. Hyde P. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22936-22942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Because of the limited resolution capability of Bio-Gel P-6, each oligosaccharide library undoubtedly contained the oligosaccharides with different sizes. These fractions were then subjected to 3-OST-3A modification and assayed for gD binding (TableI). Because 3-OST-1-modified HS does not bind to gD, we utilized the 3-OST-1-modified oligiosaccharides as a negative control (13Shukla D. Liu J. Blaiklock P. Shworak N.W. Bai X. Esko J.D. Cohen G.H. Eisenberg R.J. Rosenberg R.D. Spear P.G. Cell. 1999; 99: 13-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, the gD-binding percentage of 3-OST-3A-modified oligosaccharides was about 3-fold higher than that of the 3-OST-1-modified counterparts. We chose to purify a gD-binding oligosaccharide from the 3-OST-3A-modified hexasaccharide pool based upon the following two reasons: 1) the purification of hexasaccharides or octasaccharides can be achieved by anion exchange HPLC; 2) sequencing analysis for hexa- or octasaccharide is significantly less complex than larger oligosaccharides.Table IThe binding of 3-O-sulfated oligosaccharides to gDSize of the oligosaccharidesgD-binding3-OST-1-modified3-OST-3A-modified%Intact HS8.822.9>Dodecasaccharides2.07.2Dodecasaccharides2.47.6Decasaccharides5.37.0Octasaccharides1.35.4Hexasaccharides1-aBecause 3-OST-1 sulfated hexasaccharides very poorly, we could not obtain sufficient amount of 3-OST-1-modified hexasaccharides for the binding experiment. Therefore, we were unable to compare the binding of 3-OST-1-modified hexasaccharides and 3-OST-3A-modified hexasaccharides. Nevertheless, a gD-binding octasaccharide was isolated from the 3-OST-3 modified-hexasaccharide library as described in the text.Not determined3.4The binding of HS and oligosaccharides to gD was carried out at pH 6 by using an immunoprecipitation approach as described under “Experimental Procedures.”1-a Because 3-OST-1 sulfated hexasaccharides very poorly, we could not obtain sufficient amount of 3-OST-1-modified hexasaccharides for the binding experiment. Therefore, we were unable to compare the binding of 3-OST-1-modified hexasaccharides and 3-OST-3A-modified hexasaccharides. Nevertheless, a gD-binding octasaccharide was isolated from the 3-OST-3 modified-hexasaccharide library as described in the text. Open table in a new tab The binding of HS and oligosaccharides to gD was carried out at pH 6 by using an immunoprecipitation approach as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We purified a gD-binding oligosaccharide by successive anion-exchange HPLC, PAMN-, and DEAE-NPR-HPLC. Five major 3-O-35S-sulfated oligosaccharides were resolved by PAMN-HPLC (data not shown). To identify which [35S]oligosaccharide has the highest binding affinity for gD, the 3-OST-3A-modified oligosaccharides were fractionated by an immunoprecipitation approach as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The eluents were analyzed by PAMN-HPLC (Fig.1A). Comparing the chromatograms of the 3-O-35S-sulfated oligosaccharides eluted from protein A-agarose under different concentrations of sodium chloride, we found that fraction D was present when the protein A-agarose was eluted with 150 mm NaCl (Fig. 1A, bottom chromatogram). In contrast, fraction A was present when the protein A-agarose was eluted with the buffer without NaCl (Fig. 1A, top chromatogram). This result suggests that fraction D has higher affinity for gD than fraction A. As indicated, it was observed that 32% of fraction D binds gD, whereas only 9% of fraction A binds to gD (Fig. 1B). Thus, we designated fraction D as a gD-binding oligosaccharide and fraction A as a gD-nonbinding oligosaccharide. Fraction B and fraction C were considered gD-nonbinding oligosaccharides, and were not subject to further structural study as their binding percentages to gD are similar to that of fraction A (Fig. 1B). Additional35S-labeled molecules were eluted from the protein A-agarose column with 500 mm sodium chloride. However, those molecules did not give sharp peaks on PAMN-HPLC. In addition, those molecules migrated as the oligosaccharides that were much larger than octasaccharides on Bio-Gel P-6. It is possible that these molecules represented the 35S-labeled oligosaccharide contaminants that were larger than octasaccharides in the oligosaccharide library. Fraction D was further purified on DEAE-NPR-HPLC. To confirm the purity, fraction D was analyzed by capillary electrophoresis using a UV 230 nm on-line detector. As shown in Fig. 2 (bottom electrophoretogram), the octasaccharide library was well resolved by capillary electrophoresis, suggesting that the resolution of the oligosaccharides on capillary electrophoresis is high. Fraction D migrated predominantly as a single peak under such conditions (Fig. 2, top electrophoretogram). In addition, the area of the major UV peak is consistent with the estimated concentration of the octasaccharide based upon the specific35S-radioactivity. Having considered the minor UV peaks resulting from contaminants, we calculated the purity of fraction D to be greater than 80%. We also determined the binding affinity (Kd) between fraction D and gD using affinity coelectrophoresis as described by Lee and Lander (31Lee M.K. Lander A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2768-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Fraction D was separated under electrophoresis in an agarose gel through zones containing gD at various concentrations (Fig.3A). From these data, theKd for fraction D and gD was determined to be 18 μm (Fig. 3C), which is somewhat higher than the Kd of intact 3-O-sulfated HS and gD (2 μm) (13Shukla D. Liu J. Blaiklock P.

We also attempted to determine theKd between fraction A (gD-nonbinding oligosaccharide) and gD using this method. We failed to observe any obvious retarded migration of fraction A, suggesting that the binding affinity between fraction A and gD is low (Fig. 3B). We estimated that the Kd for fraction A and gD is greater than 200 μm. The molecular mass of fraction D was determined by both nESI-MS and MALDI-MS. The nESI-MS spectrum of fraction D is shown in Fig.4. The sample shows a triple charged ion, [M-3H]3−, at m/z 648.8 and a strong quadruple charged ion, [M-4H]4−, atm/z 486.4 (Fig. 4A). We confirmed that the signals at m/z 648.8 and 486.4 contain sulfate groups by using neutral loss experiments as described in a prior publication (29Pope M. Raska C. T"

When OH stretching vibrations of different alcohols were excited by mid-infrared laser pulses, vibrational energy was observed to move through intervening CH2 or CH groups, taking steps up and down in energy, ending up at terminal CH3 groups. For each additional CH2 group in the path between OH and CH3, the time for vibrational energy transfer increased by about 0.4 picosecond."

The proposed function of Vitreoscilla Hb (VHb)1 is to capture oxygen and facilitate its transfer to the terminal oxidases. VHb has been reported to increase the activity of terminal oxidases by increasing the local supply of oxygen (2Tsai P.S. Hatzimamikatis V. Bailey J.E. Biotechnol.

In Rhizobium etli, for example, the expression of vgb in free living cells grown under most oxygen-limiting conditions resulted in an increase in respiratory activity, increased chemical energy content, and expression of the nitrogen-fixation gene nifHc.

In most aerobic bacteria, the free energy change of respiration is conserved in the form of a proton electrochemical gradient, which is generated by the respiratory enzymes. The Vitreoscillacytochrome bo ubiquinol oxidase consists of four subunits and is located in the cytoplasmic membrane. Although it is structurally and functionally similar to the E. coli cytochromebo ubiquinol oxidase, the Vitreoscilla enzyme pumps Na+ instead of H+ during terminal oxidation, generating a sodium electrochemical gradient (10Efiok B.J.S.

Using immunogold labeling of VHb in E. coli andVitreoscilla, the cellular localization of VHb has been recently determined to be in the cytoplasm, concentrated in the outer perimeter near the cell membrane (13Ramandeep Hwang K.W.

The same study showed that VHb bound to bacterial (E. coli and Vitreoscilla) respiratory membranes, which would account for its localization. The binding affinity (Kd) of VHb to invertedVitreoscilla membranes was 6.5 μm, about 10 times greater affinity than the binding of control mammalian globins. To attempt to identify the binding sites in the membranes, the binding of VHb to Vitreoscilla cytochrome bo in synthetic membrane vesicles was tested, and a Kd of 6.2 μm was determined. The observation that exogenously added VHb stimulated the ubiquinol oxidase activity of both the respiratory membranes and the cytochrome bo proteoliposomes, especially under hypoxic conditions (13Ramandeep Hwang K.W.

To obtain independent verification for this interaction and to attempt to identify which subunit or subunits in the cytochrome are the actual binding targets, we further examined this interaction using the yeast two-hybrid system (14Fields S. Methods. 1993; 5: 116-124Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar) with VHb as the bait and individual subunits and parts of subunits of Vitreoscilla cytochrome boas prey. Because VHb also exhibits stimulatory effects in E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we tested subunits of the cytochrome bo from these organisms for VHb binding sites. Yeast strains and plasmids were obtained from OriGene Technologies as part of the DupLex two-hybrid kit. These included Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain EGY48 (MATα trp1 his3 ura3 leu2::6 LexAop-LEU2) used as host strain for transformation of bait, prey, and reporter plasmids, and plasmid vectors pEG202, pSH18-34, pJK101, and pJG4-5. Yeast strains were grown at 30 °C in either glucose minimal medium (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 2% glucose, and auxotrophic amino acids as needed) or induction medium (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 2% galactose, 1% raffinose, and auxotrophic amino acids as needed). vgb was amplified by PCR from pNKD1 (15Dikshit K.L.

After restriction digestion of the PCR fragment with EcoRI andXhoI, vgb was inserted into pEG202. Genomic DNA of Vitreoscilla, E. coli strain JM103, andP. aeruginosa were purified and used as templates in PCR to amplify DNA fragments coding parts of these cyo operons. Forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers were designed to haveEcoRI and XhoI sites, respectively, for the cloning of VtcyoA, VtcyoA-soluble region (VtcyoAsol), VtcyoB-soluble region I (VtcyoBsolI), VtcyoC, VtcyoD,VtcyoE, EccyoA, EccyoB,EccyoD, PacyoA, PacyoC, andPacyoD. Forward and reverse primers for the cloning of VtcyoB and VtcyoB-soluble region II (VtcyoBsolII) were designed to have EcoRI andSalI sites and those of EccyoC andPacyoB to have MfeI and XhoI sites (Table I and Fig. 1). After restriction digestion of the PCR fragments with EcoRI andXhoI, or EcoRI and SalI, orMfeI and XhoI, the fragments of thecyo operons from these three microorganisms were inserted into pJG4-5 that had been cleaved with the corresponding restriction enzymes.Table IOligonucleotide primer sequencesOligonucleotide primer sequences for subcloning fragments of the cytochrome bo ubiquinol oxidase operons.

The Western blot procedure of CLONTECH was used for Western immunoblotting analysis following SDS-PAGE with a 12% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane at 150 V for 1 h. The membrane was incubated at room temperature for 1 h with 0.5 μg/ml anti-LexA mouse antibody in 5 ml of TBST buffer (20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5) with 5% nonfat powdered milk. The membrane was washed five times with TBST buffer at room temperature. Bound primary antibodies were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:5,000 in TBST). The membrane was again washed four times with TBST buffer at room temperature, followed by detection using the horseradish peroxidase chemiluminescent detection system. EGY48 containing the lacZ reporter plasmid (pSH18-34) and the VHb bait plasmid (pEG202::vgb) was transformed with 16 different prey plasmids (pJG4-5::VtcyoA, VtcyoAsol,VtcyoB, VtcyoBsolI, VtcyoBsolII,VtcyoC, VtcyoD, VtcyoE,EccyoA, EccyoB, EccyoC,EccyoD, PacyoA, PacyoB,PacyoC, and PacyoD). The transformants were first plated on his-ura-trp drop-out minimal glucose medium to select for both the bait and prey plasmids. The cotransformants were plated on his-ura-trp-leu drop-out induction medium to induce expression of activation domain fusion proteins and to select for colonies that express interacting proteins. Only those cotransformants in which the hybrid proteins interact will form colonies on the his-ura-trp-leu drop-out medium. They were tested simultaneously for LacZ activity by including X-gal in the medium, thereby eliminating many of the false positives that occur in any two-hybrid screening. Liquid cultures were assayed for β-galactosidase to verify and quantify the two-hybrid interactions. pEG202::vgb was used as the bait vector; it encodes both a lexA operator binding domain and VHb. The 16 pJG4-5::cyo expression plasmids were used as prey vectors and encode the activator domain for this operator and for one of the cytochrome bo subunits or portions thereof from Vitreoscilla, E. coli, orP. aeruginosa. Plasmids pJG4-5::VtcyoA through ::VtcyoD encode the entire amino acid sequences of the CyoA through CyoD subunits of Vitreoscilla cytochromebo, respectively, and the pJG4-5::VtcyoE plasmid encodes the entire amino acid sequence of CyoE (heme o farnesyl transferase). Plasmid pJG4-5::VtcyoAsol encodes the CyoA-soluble region, which is located in the periplasmic region (amino acids 109–325 of the CyoA subunit of Vitreoscilla cytochrome bo). Plasmid pJG4-5::VtcyoBsolI encodes one fragment of the CyoB-soluble region, amino acids 518–594; plasmid pJG4-5::VtcyoBsolII encodes another fragment of the CyoB-soluble region, amino acids 632–666. Plasmids pJG4-5::EccyoA through ::EccyoD encode the entire amino acid sequences of the CyoA through CyoD subunits of E. coli cytochromebo, respectively, and plasmids pJG4-5::PacyoA through ::PacyoD encode those of the CyoA through CyoD subunits of P. aeruginosa cytochrome bo, respectively (Fig. 1). If a pEG202 expression construct does not auto-activate the pSH18-34 reporter gene and also represses the pJK101 reporter gene, the LexA fusion protein is stable in yeast cells. As an independent check of the genetic assays, total cellular protein extracts were prepared from the LexA-only control and LexA-VHb strains and tested with anti-LexA mouse antibody. Fig.2 shows a Western blot for the LexA-only control strain (lane 1) and for a LexA-VHb fusion protein strain (lane 2). The pEG202::vgbexpression construct yielded a fusion protein of the expected molecular size. In conclusion, the auto-activation assay, repression assay (data not shown), and Western blotting all indicate that the LexA-VHb fusion protein is suitable for use as bait in two-hybrid protein interaction screening. To test whether VHb can bind to any subunit of the cytochrome bo ubiquinol oxidase complex from Vitreoscilla, pEG202::vgb was used as bait and the pJG4-5::Vtcyo constructs used as prey in the yeast two-hybrid assay. A significant interaction was observed only between VHb and the intact CyoB subunit ofVitreoscilla cytochrome bo (Figs.3 and4). These results confirm previous experiments (13Ramandeep Hwang K.W.

This has been demonstrated, for example, for the growth and production of amylase by recombinant E. coli (16Buddenhagen R.E. Webster D.A. Stark B.C. Biotechnol. Lett. 1996; 18: 695-700Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and the growth and degradation of benzoic acid by genetically engineered P. aeruginosa (17Chung J.W. Webster D.A. Pagilla K.R. Stark B.C. J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 27: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To test if VHb also interacts with the cytochromebo oxidases in these organisms, binding between VHb and each subunit of the cytochrome bo from E. coli andP. aeruginosa was tested using the yeast two-hybrid system. The results again showed an interaction with subunit I of the cytochrome bo ubiquinol oxidases of both these microorganisms (Figs. 3 and 4). Thus, VHb can interact with heterologous cytochrome bo as it does with the native cytochrome bo, somehow enhancing cell growth and biotechnological processes in bioengineered heterologous organisms. These data support the proposed function of VHb to provide oxygen directly to the terminal oxidases, especially because subunit I contains the binuclear center where the oxygen that could be directly delivered by VHb is reduced to water (18Abramson J. Riistama S. Larsson G. Jasaitis A. Svensson-Ek M. Laakkonen L. Puustinen A. Iwata S. Wikstrom M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 910-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Our preliminary scheme for VHb-cytochrome bo binding shown in Fig.5 raises some questions. For example, is oxyVHb the only or preferred form that binds to the cytochrome? What regions of the two proteins are involved in their interaction? These questions might be answered using site-directed mutants; a non-oxygen binding mutant of VHb could be used to test the former, for example, and exterior surface mutants the latter. In the previously reported binding studies (13Ramandeep Hwang K.W. Raje M. Kim K.J. Stark B.C. Dikshit K.L. Webster D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24781-24789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), VHb bound equally well to both E. coliand Vitreoscilla membranes, which is supported by the results of the two-hybrid assay of the current study. An interaction between cytochrome bo and VHb was suggested by Tsai et al. (3Tsai P.S. Nagely M. Bailey J.E. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1995; 49: 151-160Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). That work also indirectly indicated that VHb and theE. coli cytochrome bd did not interact, but this needs to be tested directly with the yeast two-hybrid system for both the E. coli and Vitreoscilla cytochromebd oxidases. VHb has been shown to function as a terminal oxidase in E. coli that lacks both cytochrome bo and bdoxidases (4Dikshit R.P. Dikshit K.L. Liu Y. Webster D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 293: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), suggesting that under some conditions VHb may function in electron transfer. The E. coli cytochrome boubiquinol oxidase, and presumably other bacterial cytochromebo oxidases, contains only three metal ions in its binuclear center, two heme irons and one copper, unlike the eukaryotic homologue, cytochrome aa3, which has two heme irons and two coppers (19Garcia-Horsman J.A. Barquera B. Rumbley J., Ma, J. Gennis R.B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5587-5600Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). It is known that metVHb reacts with superoxide anion to form oxyVHb (20Orii Y. Webster D.A. Plant Cell Physiol. 1977; 18: 521-526Google Scholar). This raises the possibility, pure speculation at this point, that VHb does indeed function in electron transfer in terminal oxidation. If oxyVHb interacted with cytochrome bo and transferred superoxide anion (one electron-reduced oxygen) to the cytochrome, this would obviate the need for a fourth electron-transferring metal (copper) in the binuclear center. An NADH-flavoprotein metVHb reductase that is present in Vitreoscilla and that copurifies with the VHb has been suggested to form a dissociable complex with structural/functional equivalence to other microbial flavohemoglobins (21Tarricone C. Galizzi A. Coda A. Ascenzi P. Bolognesi M. Structure. 1997; 5: 497-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This flavoprotein could serve to re-reduce the ferric VHb generated by the donation of superoxide anion. On the other hand, it is conceivable that electron transfer goes in the other direction and that cytochrome bofunctions as a metVHb reductase to keep VHb in its physiologically active reduced form. In any case, it now appears that the roles and functions of VHb are more complex than just the oxygen-transporting one initially believed. These hypothetical functions are different from the NO detoxification function proposed for flavohemoproteins fromE. coli (22Stevanin T.M. Ioannidis N. Mills C.E. Kim S.O. Hughes M.N. Poole R.K. J.

We show that this receptor in B10 cells is identical in sequence to the P2Y12 ADP receptor (“P2YT”) of platelets. When expressed heterologously, 2-methylthio-ADP (2-MeSADP; EC50, 2 nm), ADP, and adenosine 5′-O-(2-thio)diphosphate were agonists of cAMP decrease, and 2-propylthio-d-β,γ-difluoromethylene-ATP was a competitive antagonist (KB, 28 nm), as in platelets. However, 2-methylthio-ATP (2-MeSATP) (EC50, 0.4 nm), ATP (1.9 μm), and 2-chloro-ATP (190 nm), antagonists in the platelet, were also agonists. 2-MeSADP activated (EC50, 0.1 nm) GIRK1/GIRK2 inward rectifier K+ channels when co-expressed with P2Y12 receptors in sympathetic neurons. Surprisingly, P2Y1 receptors expressed likewise gave that response; however, a full inactivation followed, absent with P2Y12 receptors. A new P2Y12-mediated transduction was found, the closing of native N-type Ca2+channels; again both 2-MeSATP and 2-MeSADP are agonists (EC50, 0.04 and 0.1 nm, respectively). That action, like their cAMP response, was pertussis toxin-sensitive. The Ca2+ channel inhibition and K+ channel activation are mediated by βγ subunit release from a heterotrimeric G-protein.

The B10 cells respond to extracellular adenine (but not uracil) nucleotides with intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, mediated by a G-protein-coupled P2Y1 receptor (2Webb T.E. Feolde E. Vigne P. Neary J.T. Runberg A. Frelin C. Barnard E.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 119: 1385-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Whereas the known rat P2Y1 receptor cDNA could be isolated from the B10 cells (2Webb T.E. Feolde E. Vigne P. Neary J.T. Runberg A. Frelin C. Barnard E.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 119: 1385-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), no transcript for any other then-known P2Y receptor subtype was detectable in them. However, the B10 cells were found to exhibit another second messenger response, namely the inhibition of stimulated adenylyl cyclase, but with a nucleotide agonist specificity very similar to that of the P2Y1 receptor (2Webb T.E. Feolde E. Vigne P. Neary J.T. Runberg A. Frelin C. Barnard E.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 119: 1385-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It was further demonstrated (3Simon J. Vigne P.

Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) that selective antagonists of the P2Y1receptor, such as adenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-phosphate, were unable to affect that response, although it showed high sensitivity to 2-propylthio-d-β,γ-difluoromethylene-ATP (AR-C66096),1 a specific antagonist (4Humphries R.G.

That study (3Simon J. Vigne P. Eklund K.M. Michel A.D. Carruthers A.M. Humphrey P.P.A. Frelin C. Barnard E.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a second P2Y receptor activity is present in the B10 cell, with some of its functional features in common with the plateletP2YT receptor. Recently, a cDNA encoding a nucleotide receptor with a novel seven-transmembrane sequence was identified independently by two groups, starting from a human platelet cDNA library or an orphan human DNA sequence, and shown to be distantly but significantly related to the known P2Y receptors (6Hollopeter G. Jantzen H.-M. Vincent D., Li, G. England L. Ramakrishnan V. Yang R.-B. Nurden P. Nurden A. Julius D. Conley P. Nature. 2001; 409: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar, 7Zhang F.L.

Its amino acid sequence lies on a previously unrecognized separate branch of the P2Y family (8Barnard E.A. Simon J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 388-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It was characterized in both studies to show its adenine nucleotide specificity and its inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase, in which it corresponds to the plateletP2YT receptor (6Hollopeter G. Jantzen H.-M. Vincent D., Li, G. England L. Ramakrishnan V. Yang R.-B. Nurden P. Nurden A. Julius D. Conley P. Nature. 2001; 409: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar, 7Zhang F.L.

That human P2Y12receptor cDNA was expressed again in cell line hosts by other groups, confirming the reported series of agonists but with higher potencies in the cAMP decrease (9Takasaki J. Kamohara M. Saito T. Matsumoto M. Matsumoto S.-I. Ohishi T. Soga T. Matusushime H. Furuichi K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 432-439PubMed Google Scholar) and showing their affinities by competition with the binding of radiolabeled 2-MeSADP (9Takasaki J. Kamohara M. Saito T. Matsumoto M.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In the original identification of the human P2Y12 receptor, a similar cDNA was also derived from a rat platelet library (6Hollopeter G. Jantzen H.-M. Vincent D., Li, G. England L. Ramakrishnan V. Yang R.-B. Nurden P. Nurden A. Julius D. Conley P. Nature. 2001; 409: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar), and its RNA was shown to express in Xenopus oocytes, but this receptor was not further characterized. The question, therefore, obviously arises as to whether the cyclase inhibitory receptor for adenine nucleotides of the B10 capillary endothelial cell is in fact the P2Y12 receptor. However, this cannot necessarily be assumed, because the P2T receptor has commonly been described in the literature as specific to the platelet (11Hourani S.M. Hall D.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 103-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 12Kunapuli S.P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 392-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the adenylyl cyclase-inhibitory P2Y receptor activity in the B10 cell differs in an important respect from that in the platelet, namely in the response to the nucleotide triphosphates. In B10 cells (3Simon J. Vigne P. Eklund K.M. Michel A.D. Carruthers A.M. Humphrey P.P.A. Frelin C. Barnard E.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) ATP and 2-ClATP are weak partial agonists, and 2-MeSATP is a very potent full agonist (EC50, 3.5 nm), whereas in the platelet these and other adenosine triphosphates are antagonists (13Cusack N.J. Hourani S.M.O. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1982; 77: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 14Park H.S. Hourani S.M.O. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 1359-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It may be, therefore, that these endothelial cells contain a different subtype related to the P2Y12 receptor, or even a quite different, previously unknown receptor of the P2Y family, whereas other explanations are also possible (3Simon J. Vigne P. Eklund K.M. Michel A.D. Carruthers A.M. Humphrey P.P.A. Frelin C. Barnard E.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This has remained as an outstanding question in our knowledge of the P2Y family. We have, therefore, screened the B10 cell mRNA population for sequences related to the platelet P2Y12 receptor, and we show that it is the authentic platelet P2Y12 receptor sequence that is present. The pharmacological properties of the rat P2Y12 receptor have been characterized, and their relationships to the B10 cell phenotype are discussed. Those properties include two primary P2Y12 transductions, the direct activation of a G-protein-coupled inward rectifier K+(GIRK) channel, and the direct closing of a voltage-gated N-type Ca2+ channel (Ca2+N channel). All media and reagents for cell culture were purchased from Invitrogen. ATP, ADP, ADPβS, hexokinase, and all restriction enzymes used were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. 2-MeSATP, 2-MeSADP, 2-chloro-ATP (2-ClATP), 2′,3′-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-adenosine 5′-triphosphate (BzATP), creatine phosphate, creatine phosphokinase, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), cAMP, forskolin, protein kinase A (cAMP-binding regulatory subunit), and pertussis toxin were from Sigma. RNA isolation kit and RNase-free DNase I were from Stratagene. TA Cloning Kit and pcDNA 3.1(+) plasmid were from Invitrogen. AR-C66096 was the sample synthesized previously (3Simon J. Vigne P. Eklund K.M. Michel A.D. Carruthers A.M. Humphrey P.P.A. Frelin C. Barnard E.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Antisera against G-protein subunits were purchased from the following suppliers: antiserum Go/1 (for Gαo), EC/2 (for Gαi3), AS/7 (for Gαi1 and Gαi2), and RM/1 (for Gαs and Gαolf) from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; antisera S-20 (for Gα12), A-20 (for Gα13), and C-16 (for Gβ1) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; antisera 371727 (for Gαi2), 371754 (for Gαq and Gα11), 371783 (for Gα16) fromCalbiochem-Novabiochem; antisera PC64 (for Gαz), G51829(for Gαt1), 3A-195 (Gα14) from Oncogene Research Products, Transduction Laboratories, and Gramsch Laboratories, respectively. [3H]cAMP (25–40 Ci/mmol), the secondary antibodies used, and the ECL detection kit were from AmershamBiosciences. All other chemicals were of analytical grades from established commercial sources. The purity of all nucleotides used in this study was ensured by the use of enzymic regeneration systems as described previously (3Simon J. Vigne P. Eklund K.M. Michel A.D. Carruthers A.M. Humphrey P.P.A. Frelin C. Barnard E.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, all adenosine diphosphate stock solutions (1 mm) were treated with 10 units/ml hexokinase, 25 mm glucose, 2 mm MgCl2 to convert any triphosphate contaminations to diphosphates. Any diphosphate contamination of adenosine triphosphates was eliminated by creatine phosphokinase/creatine phosphate treatment (3Simon J. Vigne P. Eklund K.M. Michel A.D. Carruthers A.M. Humphrey P.P.A. Frelin C. Barnard E.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The treated drug solutions were then used in adenylyl cyclase assays or in electrophysiological measurements. 1321N1 astrocytoma and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells were originally from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures. B10 cells (subclone a as in Ref. 3Simon J. Vigne P. Eklund K.M. Michel A.D. Carruthers A.M. Humphrey P.P.A. Frelin C. Barnard E.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) were cultured to confluency and harvested by trypsinization. Total RNA from these cells was extracted using a micro-RNA isolation kit (Stratagene) and was treated with RNase-free DNase I for 30 min at 37 °C. First-strand cDNA was synthesized (60 min, 42 °C, 100-μl reaction volume) from 10 μg of total RNA using oligo(dT)18 primer and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (First Strand Synthesis Kit, CLONTECH). Primers based on the recently cloned rat platelet P2Y12 cDNA sequence (GenBankTMaccession number AF313450) were designed to amplify the entire coding sequence of such receptors by PCR: 5′-AGAATAACCAGGACCATGGAGGTG-3′ (forward); 5′-ATTCTACATTGGGGTCTCCTCGCT-3′ (reverse). PCR amplifications were performed on 2 μl of first-strand reaction product using the forward and reverse primers (200 ng each), deoxynucleotides (each at 200 μm), and 1.5 mm MgCl2 in the presence of 2.5 units of Dynazyme DNA polymerase (Flowgen). Cycling parameters are as follows: 94 °C, 1 min, 55 °C, 1 min, 72 °C, 2 min for 30 cycles, with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The resulting single PCR product of 1050 bp was cloned into pCR 2.1 vector (TA Cloning kit, Invitrogen). Ten clones were sequenced completely using an automated DNA sequencer and were identical. For functional expression, the rat P2Y12 cDNA was subcloned into the pcDNA 3.1(+) mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen) at theHindIII-XhoI sites to give the correct orientation for transcription. The identity and orientation of the resulting clones were also verified by sequencing. The cDNA sequence of the human P2Y12 receptor (GenBankTM accession number AF313449) was also used to design PCR primers equivalent to those used for the rat. By using human genomic DNA as the source, identical methods were applied to obtain for comparison the human P2Y12 cDNA inserted into the pcDNA 3.1(+) vector. 1 × 106 wild-type 1321N1 astrocytoma cells were transfected with 4 μg of the rat P2Y12-pcDNA 3.1(+) plasmid construct by electroporation (Easy-Ject, EquiBio, Kent, UK). Transfected cells were selected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Nutrient mix F-12 supplemented with Glutamax-1, pyridoxine, 10% fetal bovine serum (“culture medium”) plus 600 μg/ml geneticin sulfate (G418) for stable expression of the rat P2Y12receptor. Cells were maintained in the above medium at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere (95% air, 5% CO2) and passaged by trypsinization every 4–5 days. For the adenylyl cyclase assays, the cells stably expressing the rat P2Y12 receptor were plated on flat-bottom polystyrene 96-well tissue culture plates (at ∼25,000 cells per well) and were grown to near confluency. The human P2Y12 plasmid construct was similarly transfected into CHO-K1 cells, selected for stable expression as described above, and prepared likewise for adenylyl cyclase assays. As we described recently (3Simon J. Vigne P. Eklund K.M. Michel A.D. Carruthers A.M. Humphrey P.P.A. Frelin C. Barnard E.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the measurements were performed in 96-well plates, using the method based on competition for the binding of [3H]cAMP to a binding fragment of protein kinase A (15Carruthers A.M. Warner A.J. Michel A.D. Feniuk W. Humphrey P.P.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 126: 1221-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Confluent layers of cells heterologously expressing the P2Y12 (rat or human) receptor were washed with serum-free culture medium containing 25 mmHEPES and 5 mm glucose, pH 7.4, at 37 °C and then preincubated in the same medium containing 200 μm IBMX for 15 min at 37 °C (to inhibit breakdown of cAMP by phosphodiesterases). Incubations with effectors (as stated each case here) were made in the presence of 10 μm forskolin and 200 μm IBMX for 5 min at 37 °C. Control experiments performed on 1321N1 or CHO-K1 cells transfected similarly, but with vector alone gave no detectable decrease in the stimulated cAMP level. For antagonism studies, the cells were pre-incubated with AR-C66096 or BzATP at the stated concentrations for 15 min at 37 °C in medium containing 200 μm IBMX; and then the stated concentrations of 2-MeSADP as agonist were each added, plus forskolin to 10 μm, for a further 5-min incubation at 37 °C. For pertussis toxin treatment, the 1321N1 cells stably expressing the recombinant rat P2Y12 receptor were cultured on 96-well plates to near-confluency. Half of the wells on each plate were incubated with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin and the other half without, in culture medium with G418 at 37 °C for 14–16 h, before use in experiments. Cells were grown to confluency, harvested in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm EDTA. Cells were collected by centrifugation (200 × g, 5 min, 4 °C) and resuspended in 2 ml of ice-cold hypotonic lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamidine HCl) and homogenized by freeze-thaw and 10 passages through a 27-gauge needle. The homogenate was centrifuged for 5 min at 200 × g, and the pellet was discarded and the plasma membrane fraction collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was finally resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer, and its protein concentration was measured (DC Protein Assay Kit, Bio-Rad). Membrane proteins (50 μg per lane) were separated on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the bands were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Immunodetection of various Gα subunits on the blots were achieved using standard techniques, with a large excess of the specific antisera against Gαo and Gβ1 subunits that are detailed under “Materials.” Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG was applied as the secondary antibody. The signals were detected by ECL. Isolation of SCG neurons and injection of plasmids were described previously (16Filippov A.K. Webb T.E. Barnard E.A. Brown D.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5170-5179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Filippov A.K. Brown D.A. Barnard E.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, the SCG neurons isolated from 15- to 19-day-old rats were plated on coverslips 4–6 h prior to DNA micro-injection into the cell nucleus. The cells were co-injected with the rat P2Y12-pcDNA 3.1(+) plasmid (100 ng/μl) and the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP, S65T mutant; CLONTECH) cDNA in pcDNA 3 vector (25 ng/μl). For the modulation of the inwardly rectifying K+ current, GIRK1 and GIRK2 cDNAs in pcDNA 3 (100 ng/μl each; generous gifts from Dr. F. Lesage) were also present in the injection buffer. The injected neurons were then cultured at 37 °C for 14–24 h prior to electrophysiological recordings. The agonist was applied to the cells in a constantly perfusing solution (bath exchange ≤2 s); this avoids any degradation of the agonist because of enzymic action at the surface of the cells. Whole-cell currents through the GIRK channels in fluorescent cells were recorded as described (18Fernandez-Fernandez J.M. Abogadie F.C. Milligan G. Delmas P. Brown D.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 14: 283-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but at ∼20 °C, in perforated patch mode, with external 6 mm KCl and with a 200-ms range for the standard ramp voltage commands applied. Currents through the N-type Ca2+ channels carried by 5 mm Ba2+were recorded and identified as described previously (19Filippov A.K. Webb T.E. Barnard E.A. Brown D.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 126: 1009-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The currents were routinely evoked every 20 s, for a period of 50 ms, by a depolarizing test pulse from −90 to 0 mV; they are shown as leak-corrected by subtracting the current remaining after substituting 5 mm Co2+ for Ba2+ in the external solution (as described in Ref. 16Filippov A.K. Webb T.E. Barnard E.A. Brown D.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5170-5179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pertussis toxin incubation here was at 500 ng/ml, 24 h, starting 1 h after plasmid injection of the cells. Other methods, including ensuring and maintaining nucleotide purity, were described previously (16Filippov A.K. Webb T.E. Barnard E.A. Brown D.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5170-5179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Filippov A.K. Brown D.A. Barnard E.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). At least three independent replicate experiments, each in triplicate, were performed in all adenylyl cyclase assays to give the values reported, represented as the mean ± S.E. Agonist concentration-response curves were computer-fitted to a simple logistic equation and the EC50 values, referring to the agonist action (inhibition) of nucleotides on the stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity, were calculated using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software). pKB values for antagonists were obtained from Schild plots of such fitted data. For electrophysiological experiments, a concentration-response data set was obtained from each of at least 3–5 cells. Curves were then fitted (using Origin 5.0 software) to pooled mean data points using the Hill equation y = ymaxxnH/( xnH+ KnH), wherey is % of change in current; ymax is extrapolated maximum change; x is ligand concentration (nm); K is EC50 of the agonist (nm), and nH is the Hill coefficient. Forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers (see “Experimental Procedures”) based on the known P2Y12receptor sequence (6Hollopeter G. Jantzen H.-M. Vincent D., Li, G. England L. Ramakrishnan V. Yang R.-B. Nurden P. Nurden A. Julius D. Conley P. Nature. 2001; 409: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar) from platelets were designed to amplify the full coding region. A single product of 1050 bp was obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) with this primer set using mRNA from B10 cells. This DNA sequence contains an open reading frame of 1029 bp encoding 343 amino acid residues (Fig.1). It is identical to the deposited GenBankTM rat receptor sequence (accession numberAF313450). Dendrograms of human P2Y receptor protein sequences (7Zhang F.L. Luo L. Gustafson E. Lachowicz J. Smith M. Qiao X. Liu Y.-H. Chen G. Pramanik B. Laz T.M. Palmer K. Bayne M. Monsma F. J. Biol.

Sci. 2001; 22: 388-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) had shown that the P2Y12 sequence is very divergent from the others, being on a distinct second branch with the UDP-glucose receptor. The next closest, although still quite low in shared identity, is the sequence (human) of the P2Y5 receptor (which gives some response to ATP in oocyte expression (20King B.F. Townsend-Nicolson A. J. Auton. Nerv. Syst. 2000; 81: 164-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar)). A dendrogram of rat P2Y receptor sequences (where known) shows the same separation (not shown). However, the rat P2Y12 receptor shares 85% sequence identity with the human P2Y12 receptor and they are clearly orthologues (Fig. 1). 49 amino acids are changed between them. These changes are concentrated in the N and C termini and in the 3rd intracellular loop. In addition to these changes, there are 6 amino acid additions into the N-terminal region, plus a 5-residue deletion in the C-terminus, of the human receptor (Fig. 1). Some differences in properties might therefore be expected. The identified cDNA in pcDNA 3.1(+) mammalian expression vector was transfected into 1321N1 astrocytoma cells, and a stably expressing cell line was selected. The effects of various nucleotides on the cAMP level were determined. When these cells were transfected with the host vector alone, none of the nucleotides applied had an effect on the cAMP level, either basal or after its elevation by 10 μm forskolin (data not shown). 2-MeSATP or 2-MeSADP, which were shown to be potent agonists at the P2YT receptor in B10 cells (3Simon J. Vigne P. Eklund K.M. Michel A.D. Carruthers A.M. Humphrey P.P.A. Frelin C. Barnard E.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), inhibited the forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2). The maximum inhibition of the stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was about 50% in all cases (FIG. 2, FIG. 3, FIG. 4). They were potent full agonists here (Table I). ADP and ADPβS were also agonists but with lower potencies (Fig. 2). Other triphosphates such as 2-ClATP and ATP were also full agonists here (Fig. 2 and Table I), in contrast to their antagonistic behavior on platelets (14Park H.S. Hourani S.M.O. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 1359-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) or partial agonism on B10 cells (3Simon J. Vigne P. Eklund K.M. Michel A.D. Carruthers A.M. Humphrey P.P.A. Frelin C. Barnard E.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The rank order of agonist potencies here is 2-MeSATP > 2-MeSADP > ADP > ADPβS > 2-ClATP > ATP. Their potencies are very similar to the values found for the recombinant human P2Y12 receptor cloned from genomic DNA in our laboratory, heterologously expressed in CHO cells, and assayed in identical conditions (Table I). The ratios of the potencies in that series do not differ significantly between the two sets, indicating no difference between the two species with these agonists. However, these potencies for the human receptor in CHO-K1 cells are 3.5–8-fold higher (except for ADP and ADPβS) than the values recently published by Zhang et al. (7Zhang F.L. Luo L. Gustafson E.

Lipid modification of proteins has been found to play roles in protein stability, catalytic activity, protein-protein interactions, and subcellular localization. Isoprenylation, N-myristoylation, and thioacylation are the best characterized forms of lipid modifications of intracellular proteins. Of these, only thioacylation (also called palmitoylation or S-acylation) is metabolically reversible. Thioacylated proteins cycle between acylated and deacylated states, allowing thioacylation (like other, better characterized, reversible covalent modifications) to act as a regulated switch of protein activity. Proteins involved in many signal transduction pathways are thioacylated, including Ras proteins, nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, and nitric-oxide synthase. Heterotrimeric G protein-regulated signaling systems have a relative abundance of thioacylated proteins, including many G protein-coupled receptors, Gα subunits, regulator of G protein signaling (RGS)1proteins, and G protein-coupled receptor kinases (1Morello J.P. Bouvier M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 2Linder M.E. Middleton P. Helper J.R. Taussig R. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1996; 93: 15203-15208Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Some thioacylated Gα proteins have a higher affinity for Gβγ complexes and are relatively resistant to the GTPase-accelerating properties of RGS proteins when compared with their nonacylated counterparts in vitro (5Iiri T. Backlund P.S. Jones T.L.Z. Wedegaertner P.B. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14592-14597Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 6Tu Y. Wang J. Ross E.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1132-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These alterations in the biochemical properties of Gα proteins suggest that thioacylation has an effect on G protein-coupled signaling in vivo. Additionally, mutant Gα proteins that lack thioacylated cysteine residue(s) are localized to internal rather than plasma membranes, indicating that thioacylation probably plays a role in the subcellular localization of signaling events (7Song J. Dohlman H.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14806-14817Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 8Huang C. Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The deacylation of Gα proteins (and other thioacylated proteins) is the regulated step of the thioacylation cycle. In the basal state, Gα proteins are thought to be thioacylated stoichiometrically and associated with Gβγ. Upon activation by ligand-bound receptor, Gα proteins dissociate (at least partially) from Gβγ, and the rate of deacylation (determined by metabolic radiolabeling) increases dramatically (9Mumby S.M. Kleuss C. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2800-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 10Wedegaertner P.B. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 1063-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Similar increases in thioester-bound palmitate turnover have been noted for other thioacylated proteins involved in signal transduction pathways, including several G protein-coupled receptors and endothelial cell nitric-oxide synthase (11Loisel T.P. Adam L. Hebert T.E. Bouvier M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15923-15932Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 12Hayashi M.K. Haga T. Arch. Biochem.

Chem. 1995; 270: 995-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The role that the regulated deacylation of Gα plays in the signal transduction process has yet to be determined. The regulated deacylation of Gα and other proteins is presumed to be carried out by an intracellular thioesterase. An enzyme, designated acyl-protein thioesterase 1 or APT1, that performs regulated deacylation of Gsα and other thioacylated proteins in vitro was isolated from rat liver (14Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15830-15837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Although this enzyme had previously been identified as a source of lysophospholipase activity, palmitoyl-Gα is a better substrate for APT1 than lysophospholipids by several hundred-fold (14Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15830-15837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 15Sugimoto H. Hayashi H. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7705-7711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of APT1 in cultured cells accelerates palmitate turnover on Gαs and endothelial cell nitric-oxide synthase. Although overexpressed APT1 is capable of deacylating proteins in vivo, proof of the involvement of the native enzyme in this process has been lacking until now. Putative APT1 orthologs exist in many eukaryotic organisms, including the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We now have demonstrated that YLR118c, a S. cerevisiae open reading frame, encodes an enzyme with both lysophospholipase and acyl-protein thioesterase activity in vitro. Targeted disruption of the gene encoding Apt1p (YLR118c) reveals that S. cerevisiaeApt1p appears to be responsible for virtually all of the acyl-Gα thioesterase activity detectable in yeast extracts. Furthermore, the turnover of palmitate associated with the yeast Gα, Gpa1p, is dramatically reduced in yeast lacking the APT1 gene, demonstrating that Apt1p is actually involved in deacylation of Gα subunits in vivo. Ni2+-NTA-agarose was purchased from Qiagen. All other chromatographic resins were acquired from AmershamBiosciences. Isotopes were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.

(19Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar).

Hexahistidine-tagged RGS4 and hexahistidine-tagged, myristoylated Gαi1 (with an internal hexahistidine tag) were produced in Escherichia coli and purified as described (21Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M.

The vector pQE60-6HB was created to facilitate the cloning of S. cerevisiae APT1. Two oligonucleotides (5′-CATGGTCGACCCGC-3′ and 5′-GGGTCGAC-3′) were phosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase, annealed together, and ligated into the vector pQE60–6H, which had been digested with NcoI and SacII. The resulting plasmid, pQE60-6HB, has the same features as the parent, pQE60-6H, and eliminates a stop codon between the translation start site in the vector and the multiple cloning site (19Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the S. cerevisiae open reading frame YLR118c from genomic DNA isolated from S. cerevisiae strain YPH501. The sequence of the sense primer was 5′-GAACCGCGGATGAATGGACTTAGA-3′, corresponding to aSacII restriction endonuclease site (in frame with theSacII site within the multiple cloning site of pQE60-6HB), followed by nucleotides 1–15 of YLR118c. The sequence of the antisense primer was 5′-GGCCTGCAGCATCACCCCAACTAT-3′, correlating to aPstI restriction endonuclease site followed by the antisense sequence to nucleotide bases 106–130 distal to the stop codon of YLR118c. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested withSacII and PstI and ligated into the vector pQE60-6HB, which had been digested with the same enzymes. The resulting bacterial expression plasmid, pQE60-6H-scAPT1, encodes the protein sequence MHHHHHHAMVDPR followed by amino acids 1–228 of S. cerevisiae Apt1p. E. coli strain XL1-Blue harboring the plasmid pQE60–6H-scAPT1 or pQE60–6H-APT1 (encoding the rat enzyme) was grown in 6 liters of LB medium containing 50 mg/liter ampicillin. Recombinant protein expression was induced as previously described for the expression of Gαi1 (19Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The bacterial pellet was harvested and frozen in liquid N2. The cells were thawed in 250 ml of buffer TP (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and proteinase inhibitors (leupeptin, 6 μg/ml; lima bean trypsin inhibitor, 6 μg/ml;l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, 32 μg/ml; 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, 32 μg/ml; and aprotinin, 2 μg/ml)) and lysed by treatment with lysozyme (50 mg), followed by 500 ng of DNase I. A soluble lysate was generated by centrifugation of the lysed cells at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Recombinant APT1 was purified by application of the soluble lysate to a column containing 20 ml of Ni2+-NTA-agarose. The resin was washed by adding 50 ml of buffer B (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm imidazole, and 100 mmNaCl) and eluted with 50 ml of buffer C (50 mm Tris HCl (pH 8.0) with 100 mm imidazole). The eluted protein was concentrated to 20 ml in a Centriprep 30 (Amicon) and dialyzed against two changes of HME (20 mm Na-HEPES (pH 8.0), 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA) buffer (2 liters each) over 16 h at 4 °C. Aliquots of this dialyzed protein (∼19 mg/ml) were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. Roughly 3 g of each recombinant APT1 was recovered using this protocol. Palmitoylated Ha-Ras was prepared essentially as described by Camp and Hofmann; however, CHAPS detergent (1% (w/v) for extraction, 10 mm elsewhere) was substituted for n-octyl glucoside (23Camp L.A. Hofmann S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22566-22574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Palmitoyl-Gαi1 and palmitoyl-RGS4 were both prepared using hexahistidine-tagged, bacterially expressed recombinant proteins. Each protein was diluted to ∼50 μm in HMEC (HME supplemented with 10 mmCHAPS) buffer containing 500 μm[3H]palmitoyl-CoA (200–2000 cpm/pmol) and incubated at 30 °C for 60 min. Incorporation of palmitate into these proteins was assessed by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid and found to be ∼0.7 mol of palmitate/mol of Gαi1 and ∼1.3 mol of palmitate/mol of RGS4 (24Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23594-23600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures were diluted to 5 ml in TC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 10 mmCHAPS) and applied to 300 μl of Ni2+-NTA-agarose equilibrated in the same buffer. The columns were washed five times with 3 ml of TC buffer and eluted with 1.5 ml of HMEC buffer supplemented with 100 mm EDTA. The eluted palmitoylated proteins were diluted 1:20 in HMEC buffer and concentrated in a Centricon 30 (Amicon) to ∼50 μm palmitoyl-protein (assessed by liquid scintillation spectrometry). The concentrated acyl-protein substrates were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C until use. The following DNA fragments were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction with primer sequences listed in Table II and template DNA indicated in parentheses: the 5′-flanking region of YLR118c (5FR fragment, genomic DNA isolated from YPH501), the 3′-flanking region of YLR118c (3FR fragment, genomic DNA isolated from YPH501), and the entire HIS3 gene (HIS3 fragment, plasmid pRS303). The oligonucleotide primers were designed to produce restriction endonuclease sites on each end of the DNA fragments to facilitate cloning. The 5FR fragment was digested with PstI and BamHI and ligated into the plasmid pGEM-4Z (Promega), which had been digested with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid, pGEM-5FR, was cut with EcoRI and BamHI and ligated with the similarly digested 3FR fragment. The product of this ligation, pGEM-5FR-3FR, was opened at the BamHI site lying between 5FR and 3FR, and the HIS3 fragment was inserted, producing the complete targeting plasmid, pGEM-5FR-HIS3–3FR. The linear targeting fragment, used for transformation of S. cerevisiae strains, could then be excised from pGEM-5FR-HIS3–3FR using EcoRI and PstI.Table IIOligonucleotide primers used to generate APT1 targeting vectorAmplified fragmentSense/AntisenseSequenceYLR118c 5′-flanking regionSense5′-GCCCTGCAGTCTGTGGGTTTGAATTAGATC-3′YLR118c 5′-flanking regionAntisense5′-GCGATCCATATTCGATAGCGCTCAAATGG-3′YLR118c 3′-flanking regionSense5′-GCGGATCCATTGCGAGTTCAATTTAACCGC-3′YLR118c 3′-flanking regionAntisense5′-CGCGAATTCTGTTCTCTTCCTTCGTTG-3′HIS3 geneSense5′-GCGGATCCATAATTCCGTTTTAAGAGC-3′HIS3geneAntisense5′-GCGGATCCTGTGCGGTATTTCACACCGC-3′ Open table in a new tab Cultures of S. cerevisiae, typically 50–250 ml, were grown in either YPD medium (or synthetic dropout medium for maintenance of the indicated plasmids) at 30 °C to stationary phase (culture A600 of >2.5). The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation for 30 min at 2,500 × g. The cell pellet was washed with H2O, collected by centrifugation, and frozen in liquid N2. Frozen yeast were suspended in five packed cell volumes of HEC buffer (50 mm Na-HEPES (pH 8.0), 10 mmEDTA, and 10 mm CHAPS) supplemented with proteinase inhibitors (see above). The cell suspension was frozen in liquid N2 and thawed at 37 °C three times. The extraction proceeded by rocking the suspension at 4 °C for 30 min. The CHAPS-solubilized cell extract was finally isolated by centrifugation of the cell suspension for 45 min at 35,000 × g and collection of the supernatant fraction. Indicated strains of S. cerevisiaewere grown in complete synthetic medium. When the cultures reached anA600 of 0.5, [3H]palmitate in ethanol (50 μCi/ml, 1% ethanol final) was added to the culture. At the indicated times, 25 μl of each culture was removed and frozen in liquid N2. These samples were thawed by the addition of 25 μl of PDL buffer (100 mm NaPO4 (pH 7.4), 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mg/ml yeast lytic enzyme) and incubated for 1 min at 37 °C. The total lipids were extracted by the addition of 500 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1), vigorous vortexing, and incubation for 5 min at 45 °C. The samples were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min, and the lipid-containing supernatants were analyzed by thin layer chromatography (24Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23594-23600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae were grown to anA600 of 0.5 in complete synthetic medium. The yeast were then transferred into synthetic minimal medium and grown at 30 °C for 45 min. Metabolic labeling reagents ([14C]acetate (10 μCi/ml) or [32P]orthophosphate (10 μCi/ml)) were added to the appropriate cultures, and the yeast were grown for an additional 2 h. The cells from 5 ml of culture were collected by centrifugation at 4,000 × g and resuspended in 100 μl of PDL buffer. The lipid extraction proceeded as described above, except 1 ml of chloroform/methanol was used. The lipid extracts were then dried under N2 and suspended in 50 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1). The resuspended lipids (10 μl) were subjected to thin layer chromatography using PE Sil G thin layer chromatography plates (Whatman) developed with chloroform/methanol/ammonium hydroxide/H2O (65:25:2:2) mobile phase. The migration of radiolabeled lipids was detected using an MP1000 phosphorimaging screen and BAS1500 scanner (Fuji Medical Systems). S. cerevisiae strains YAD101 (APT1) and YAD103 (apt1Δ::HIS3) were transformed with the plasmid pKM1362-2, which expresses carboxyl-terminal HA-tagged Gpa1p from a copper-inducible promoter (25Madura K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1994; 265: 1454-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The yeast were grown in synthetic medium lacking leucine (to maintain pKM1362-2) until the culture reached an A600 of 0.5. Expression of Gpa1p was induced by the addition of 100 μmCuSO4 for 1 h. Cerulenin was added to the culture to a concentration of 25 μm and grown for an additional 15 min. [3H]Palmitate (50 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to each culture (100 μCi/ml, 2% ethanol final concentration), and metabolic labeling was allowed to proceed for 20 min. The yeast were collected by centrifugation at 2,500 ×g for 10 min and resuspended in “chase” medium (synthetic medium lacking leucine and supplemented with 0.25% Brij 58, 0.1 mg/ml palmitate, 0.05 mg/ml myristate, and 100 μmCuSO4). At the indicated times, 25 ml of each culture was removed, and the yeasts were collected by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 s. After discarding the supernatant, the yeast were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C until all time points were collected. Gpa1p was overexpressed in S. cerevisiae strains YAD101 (APT1) and YAD103 (apt1Δ::HIS3) as described above. One hour after induction of Gpa1p expression with CuSO4, the yeast were transferred from leucine-deficient medium to M/C/L/CU medium (synthetic medium lacking methionine, cysteine, and leucine but supplemented with 100 μm CuSO4) and grown for 15 min. [35S]methionine/cysteine (Tran35S label; 11,175 Ci/mmol; ICN) was added to each culture (100 μCi/ml final), and metabolic labeling was allowed to proceed for 20 min. The yeasts were collected by centrifugation at 2,500 × gfor 10 min and resuspended in “chase” medium (synthetic medium lacking leucine and supplemented with 50 μg/ml methionine, 10 μg/ml cysteine, and 100 μm CuSO4). At the indicated times, 1 ml of each culture was removed, and the yeast were collected by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 s, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C until all time points were collected. Radiolabeled Gpa1p was immunoprecipitated utilizing the following protocol. The frozen yeasts were lysed by suspension and incubation on ice for 15 min in 50 μl of permeabilization reagent (Y-PER; Pierce) supplemented with protease inhibitors (CompleteTM protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (70 μg/ml)). Each sample was then vortexed vigorously after the addition of 25 μl of glass beads (Bio 101) and SDS (final concentration of 1%). These broken cell suspensions were diluted with 500 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Na-HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS), and solubilized protein was obtained after centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min. Immunoprecipitation and analysis by SDS-PAGE of HA-tagged Gpa1p from these extracts proceeded as previously described for the immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged Gsα (14Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15830-15837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), except that Western blots to quantify the amount of immunoprecipitated Gpa1p were carried out using goat IgG directed against Gpa1p, YN19 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). A TR1 phosphorimaging screen (Fuji Medical Systems) with exposure times of 60 days was used for imaging of 3H-labeled proteins. An MP1000 phosphorimaging screen (Fuji Medical Systems) with exposure times ranging from 16 to 24 h was used for imaging of35S-labeled proteins. APT1 from R. norvegicus and the open reading frame YLR118C from S. cerevisiae were expressed as hexahistidine-tagged fusion proteins in E. coli. These enzymes were synthesized efficiently inE. coli, accumulating to levels of 25–40% of the soluble cellular protein (data not shown). Each protein was purified essentially to homogeneity using a single step of Ni2+-NTA-agarose affinity chromatography (Fig.1). Both enzymes migrated as a single peak of ∼29 kDa upon Superdex 75 gel filtration chromatography (data not shown). These enzymes also demonstrated chromatographic properties very similar to the native rat APT1 isolated from liver (data not shown). They bound tightly to phenyl-Sepharose, eluting between 35 and 50% ethylene glycol. Even at pH 6.0, both failed to bind to cation exchange resins (SP-Sepharose and mono S). Despite only 33% amino acid sequence identity, these recombinant proteins exhibit remarkably similar chromatographic profiles. The native rat APT1 exhibits both acyl-thioesterase activity (toward acyl-proteins and acyl-CoA) and acyl-esterase activity (toward lysophospholipids). Under the in vitro assay conditions utilized, APT1 has a marked preference for the acyl-protein substrates (14Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15830-15837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The recombinant rat and yeast enzymes were assayed using varying concentrations of three substrates: lysophosphatidylcholine, palmitoyl-CoA, and palmitoyl-Gαi1 (Fig. 2). Like APT1 isolated from rat liver, recombinant rat APT1 preferred palmitoyl-Gαi1 substrate over either lysophosphatidylcholine or palmitoyl-CoA. For the yeast enzyme, this preference was even more pronounced, with a >2,000-fold difference in catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km) between palmitoyl-Gαi1 and lysophosphatidylcholine. Having established that the enzyme encoded by S. cerevisiae open reading frame YLR118c has both biochemical activity and amino acid sequence similar to rat APT1, we will refer to YLR118C as the S. cerevisiae APT1 gene in the further description of our work. The recombinant APT1 enzymes were assayed for acyl-protein thioesterase activity using a panel of palmitoyl-protein substrates: palmitoyl-Giα1, in which the thioacylated cysteine is adjacent to a myristoylated, amino-terminal glycine (26Linder M.E. Pang I.-H. Duronio R.J. Gordon J.I. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4654-4659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); palmitoyl-RGS4, in which multiple thioacylated cysteines are found several residues away from the amino terminus of the protein (27Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Blumer K.J. Linder M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5584-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar); and palmitoyl-Ras, in which two thioacylated cysteines are located near a farnesylated carboxyl-terminal cysteine (28Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar). These assays were performed at substrate concentrations substantially below the enzymes'Km value for each, demonstrated by a linear relationship between substrate concentration and initial reaction rate (data not shown). Under these conditions, the relative catalytic efficiency of the enzyme for each substrate can be assessed by comparing the t for the completion of each reaction. Both rat APT1 and yeast Apt1p depalmitoylated these substrates in vitro. The recombinant rat APT1 showed a 10-fold variance in catalytic efficiency between the best (palmitoyl-Gαi1) and worst (palmitoyl-Ras) acyl-protein substrates (Fig. 3A), roughly comparable with the values observed previously with native rat APT1 (24Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23594-23600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the yeast Apt1p demonstrated more specificity among acyl-protein substrates. The catalytic efficiency of yeast Apt1p for palmitoyl-Gαi1 was at least 35- and 70-fold higher than that for palmitoyl-RGS4 and palmitoyl-Ras, respectively (Fig.3A). Both recombinant enzymes were also able to discriminate between heterotrimeric and free palmitoyl-Gαi1 (Fig.3B). Again, as observed with the native enzyme, free palmitoyl-Gαi1 was used as a substrate more efficiently than heterotrimeric palmitoyl-Giα1 by recombinant APT1 in this assay (14Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15830-15837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The difference in the activity of yeast Apt1p toward heterotrimeric and free palmitoyl-Gαi1 was greater than observed for the rat enzyme. We note, however, that assays of the yeast enzyme were performed only with mammalian proteins as substrates. Having established that the protein encoded by YLR118C did indeed have acyl-protein thioesterase activity, we proceeded to create a yeast stra"

Recent structural studies on multiheme cytochromes chave revealed new folds that surprisingly seem to incorporate a common “core” of heme groups. It has indeed been observed that the spatial organization of the heme planes is remarkably similar in cytochromes unrelated in function, size, or fold. Examples include hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (1Igarashi N. Moriyama H. Fujiwara T. Fukumori Y. Tanaka N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), the pentaheme c 552nitrite reductase (2Einsle O. Messerschmidt A. Stach P. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Kroneck P.M.H.

Rees D.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This conserved orientation of heme groups could be due to a common function: transport of electrons over large distances from the initial electron-accepting heme group to the active site redox cofactor. Obviously these series of communicating hemes, in effect “molecular wires,” need to conduct electrons quickly, resulting in the requirement that interheme distances be within 14 Å to avoid electron transport across the wire becoming the rate-limiting step (8Page C.C. Moser C.C. Chen X. Dutton L.P. Nature. 1998; 402: 47-52Crossref Scopus (1493) Google Scholar). However, the question remains whether the “conserved” heme arrangement is due to stringent heme-heme packing restrictions or to a more delicate fine tuning of electron transfer by optimization of this observed heme motif for as yet unidentified reasons (9Barker P.D. Ferguson S.J. Structure. 1999; 7: 281-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Clearly the observation that two evolutionary related multiheme cytochromes c have a distinct heme core arrangement would favor the first explanation. One such couple of related redox enzymes carrying distinct heme cores are the soluble tetraheme flavocytochrome c fumarate reductase (SFR) 1The abbreviations used are: SFR, soluble fumarate reductase; STC, small tetraheme cytochrome c ; Bicine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. 1The abbreviations used are: SFR, soluble fumarate reductase; STC, small tetraheme cytochrome c ; Bicine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. and the small tetraheme cytochrome c (STC), both isolated fromShewanella sp. The recently solved SFR crystal structures (5Leys D. Tsapin A.I. Nealson K.H. Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Van Beeumen J.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 1113-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 6Taylor P. Pealing S.L. Reid G.A. Chapman S.K. Walkinshaw M.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 1108-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) all reveal a new arrangement of heme groups in comparison to the “classic” Desulfovibrio tetraheme cytochromesc 3. The different position of the axial heme ligands along the polypeptide chain in SFR in comparison to the cytochromes c 3 is clearly the main determinant for the observed semilinear heme motif versusthe classical c 3 heme core pattern. While the first three heme groups in SFR are surrounded by polypeptide from the cytochrome c domain, the C-terminal heme group resides largely in a cavity made by the flavin binding catalytic domain. As mentioned, Shewanella sp. produce under anaerobic conditions a small tetraheme cytochrome c that is highly similar to the cytochrome c domain of SFR (10Tsapin A.I. Vandenberghe I. Nealson K.H. Scott J.H. Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Harada E. Kaizu T. Akutsu H. Leys D. Van Beeumen J.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 3236-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Genetic studies have indicated this cytochrome to play a role in the reduction of Fe(III) oxides, an unusual property of Shewanella sp., rather than in fumarate respiration (11Gordon E.H.J. Pike A.D. Hill A. Cuthbertson P.M. Chapman S.K. Reid G.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The STC is the smallest tetraheme protein isolated to date and consequently has the lowest amino acid to heme ratio observed. Notwithstanding the significant homology with the cytochrome c domain of SFR and the obvious conformational restrictions, a significant rearrangement of the heme core is postulated to allow incorporation of the C-terminal heme in the hydrophobic core. Recent preliminary NMR studies on the small tetraheme cytochrome c isolated from Shewanella frigidimarina have indeed revealed considerable differences in the heme core with respect to the observed orientation in SFR (12Pessanha M. Brennan L. Xavier A.V. Cuthbertson P.M. Reid G.A. Chapman S.K. Turner D.L. Salgueiro C.A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The present work reports the crystal structure of, and redox-dependent conformational changes in, the small tetraheme cytochrome c from S. oneidensis MR-1. Both oxidized and reduced crystal structures were determined at atomic resolution (0.97 and 1.02 Å, respectively), providing the highest resolution data obtained for a multiheme cytochrome c to date. In addition, a 1.55-Å structure of a different space group is reported. Comparison of these structures reveals unexpected flexibility in both protein and heme core, notwithstanding the high heme to amino acid ratio observed. Significant differences with the SFR cytochrome domain, in addition to the observed flexibility, indicate that the common “heme core” in multiheme proteins is a consequence of the limited number of ways bis-histidine-coordinated heme groups can be packed within direct contact rather than of an evolutionary pressure to maximize certain electronic effects between porphyrin planes. Analysis of the intermolecular contacts made in both crystal forms suggests a promiscuous “electron-harvesting” role for this protein in contrast to a classic predetermined electron path along a “heme wire” with specific points for entry and delivery and the associated need for specific interaction sites with electron donor and acceptor, respectively. This stratagem increases the efficiency of electron transfer by increasing the chances of productive collision between redox partners and might well prove to be a new and general robust engineering principle in multicenter redox proteins. The protein was purified as described by Tsapin et al. (13Tsapin A.I. Nealson K.H. Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Van Beeumen J.J. Crosby L.D. Feinberg B.A. Zhang C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6386-6388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Crystals of the oxidized protein were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique. The reservoir solution contained 3.5–3.8 mammonium sulfate, 0.1 m Bicine (pH 8.5–9.2). The drops were formed using equal volumes of protein solution at 30 mg/ml and reservoir solution. At 21 °C, long very thin needles appeared within days. On rare occasions a second crystal form arose after the needles had ceased to grow. These new crystals grew in three dimensions to an average size of 0.05 × 0.05 × 0.05 mm. The solution used as cryoprotectant for flash cooling these crystals at liquid nitrogen temperatures was the original reservoir solution supplemented with 15% (v/v) glycerol for the needle-shaped crystals, while the second crystal form was flash-cooled in the reservoir solution, which contained ammonium sulfate near saturation. A full data set was collected on a single, oxidized needle at ID13, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) taking advantage of the special microfocusing set-up. Different sections along the longitudinal section of the crystal were exposed to avoid excessive radiation damage due to the intense beam. The crystal diffracted to 1.55 Å and proved to be a P21 space group with unit cell a = 93.69 Å, b = 34.01 Å, c = 108.31 Å, and β = 110.49°. Data were processed and scaled with the HKL package programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (14Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38436) Google Scholar). Data were collected on the second crystal form at X11, Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron (Hamburg, Germany). These crystals diffracted up to 0.97 Å and proved to be a P212121 space group with unit cell a = 32.86 Å, b = 48.14 Å, c = 58.34 Å. These contained one molecule in the asymmetric unit as indicated by solvent content calculations. Complete data sets to atomic resolution were collected on an air-oxidized crystal and on a dithionite-reduced crystal. The latter was prepared by soaking a crystal for several minutes in reservoir solution supplemented with a large surplus of fresh dithionite crystals. Change in color of the crystal from dark red to a homogeneous pink-red color indicated full reduction, after which the crystal was quickly flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. All attempts to solve the structure of the P21 space group using the cytochrome c domain of the soluble fumarate reductase failed despite prolonged efforts. The structure elucidation of the P212121 crystal form was possible due to the atomic resolution obtained. A weak molecular replacement solution (using the program AmoRe; Ref. 15Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar) using only a fragment of the SFR cytochrome c domain (containing hemes II and III and surrounding regions) was used to generate an initial phase set. In combination with the available anomalous data, these phases quickly led to the identification of the four iron sites, giving confirmation of the correctness of the initial molecular replacement solution as well as the position of all four irons. ARP-WARP (16Perrakis A. Morris R.M. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar) in auto-building mode was used to build and refine the initial structure. This resulted in an almost complete tracing of the polypeptide chain. After refinement, the resultant model was used to solve the P21 space group crystal structure by molecular replacement using the program AmoRe, finding all six molecules within the asymmetric unit. All structures were refined in initial stages using the program REFMAC (17Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13811) Google Scholar) from the CCP4 suite. After the R free values dropped below 20, the program SHELX97 (18Sheldrick G.M. SHELX-97, Crystallographic Refinement Program. University of Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany1997Google Scholar) was used. While the P212121 structures were refined with anisotropic B-factors for all atoms including a riding hydrogen atom model, the 1.55-Å data of the P21 structure only warranted anisotropic B-factor refinement of the heavy atoms (iron and sulfurs) without contribution of hydrogens. Both reduced and oxidized orthorhombic structures were refined independently. Final refinement statistics for the three crystal structures are given in TableI. The quality of the models was checked using PROCHECK (19Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Thornton J.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab The final model for the oxidized, orthorhombic form of the S. oneidensis STC contains all 91 amino acids of the sequence (with the exception of the N-terminal residue), four hemes, and 294 water molecules. In addition, two sulfate ions were detected. The overall fold of an STC monomer is very different from any of the known tetraheme cytochrome cfolds (Fig. 1). The protein is folded in a series of α-helices connected by extended loop regions and has no regular β-strand structure. The tertiary structure is elongated and resembles an opened valve encompassing the four hemes. In addition to three 310 helical regions (A: Lys41–Met45, B: His49–His52, and C: Val57–Cys61), three α-helices can be discerned: H1 (Lys4–Glu11), H2 (Gly28–Gly40), and H3 (Thr84–Lys90). None of these helices interacts with one another, and none are separated by interspersed heme porphyrin planes, the exception being a weak hydrophobic packing between H3 and the helical 310B region, both lining the heme IV pocket. The helices are separated by large loop regions in which three hairpin bends can be discerned: Gly14–Glu16, Lys20–Thr23, and Asn68–Gln71. The N-terminal helix 1 provides the distal axial His9 ligand to heme II and is wedged between the two flexible stretches of polypeptide observed in the structure, e.g. Ala10–Gly14immediately following in the sequence and the Asp66–Gly70 loop that packs against the N-terminal section of H1. The side chains of H1 residues involved in this packing and in creating part of the hydrophobic distal heme I pocket, Leu5 and Phe8, both exhibit multiple conformations, probably in response to the multiple conformations adopted by the Asp66–Gly70 stretch. Immediately following the rigid His9 heme ligand, the Ala10–Gly14 polypeptide stretch exhibits two clear conformations significantly different in the backbone position of Glu11 (the largest difference being 2.7 Å). The higher electron density clearly indicates one conformation to be preferentially occupied, and the respective ratio of occupancy was refined to 0.64/0.36 (Fig. 2). This particular stretch has no direct contact with any heme group and seems to lack any direct structural function. The subsequent segment of polypeptide provides the first CXXCH heme binding sequence and forms most of the hydrophobic proximal heme I pocket. While several residues are observed to occupy two distinct conformations, the backbone is clearly occupying a single position. The following secondary structure element, H2, is packed against the first CXXCH heme binding residues. This helix ends with the second heme binding motif, and the polypeptide chain proceeds with the segment donating the distal heme III ligand His49. This segment provides the majority of residues that line the distal heme III cavity, while residues Ala47 and Val48 pack with the C-terminal helix H3. The polypeptide chain proceeds with the 310B helix after His49 to provide the heme III binding motif. The 310B helix itself contains His52 as distal ligand to heme IV in addition to the few hydrophobic residues lining the heme IV distal cavity. Only a few residues separate the proximal heme I ligand His65 from the distal heme III ligand His62. The short distance between both residues His49 and His52and residues His62 and His65 clearly imposes strict conformational restrictions on the local backbone conformation and the heme-heme packing. This is similar but clearly different from the c 3 tetraheme family where two consecutive histidines impose the local backbone organization and heme orientation. In contrast to the stringent conformational restrictions imposed on the preceding region, the Asp66–Gly70 stretch following His65 clearly occupies two distinct conformations (with 80 and 20% occupancy) and is packed against the flexible residues Leu5 and Phe8 from H1. Again this region of the polypeptide chain is not in direct contact with any of the heme groups, although it is packed against other protein secondary elements. The first rigid amino acids after the last residue occupying a dual backbone conformation precede Pro73 that stacks to the proximal heme III side. At this residue the polypeptide chain for the first time approaches the proximal side of heme IV and provides the heme IV binding residues in addition to residues lining the proximal pocket. The last element of secondary structure is H3 that packs lightly with an edge of heme IV.Figure 2Atomic density reveals subtle details. a, detail of the final 2Fo −Fc map contoured at 2 and 4 ς around heme II.b, stereoview of the final 2Fo −Fc map contoured at 1 ς around the Ala10– Gly14 region.

With the exception of the heme-ligating residues, surprisingly few residues are conserved throughout this family. Both Leu5 and Leu41 are involved in lining heme groups, while both Gly22 and Gly54 are important in folding. Glu31 is unique among the strictly conserved residues in that it is not involved in direct heme contact but forms a hydrogen bond to the distal His19 of heme I, a contact conserved in the SFR crystal structures. Most surface charges conserved among the STCs are the negatively charged amino acids that are more or less uniformly positioned over the protein surface (Fig.4). The surface of the protein is therefore predominantly negatively charged with no obvious heterogeneity that might indicate binding sites for redox partners. All four hemes are highly solvent-accessible, hemes I and IV from one side of the molecule and hemes II and III from the opposite side. Of the very few positively charged residues that are conserved, Arg83 is involved in ionic interaction with heme IV propionate A, and Lys72 is the only conserved positive charge on the surface in addition to the N terminus. The latter is also found to have a unique role as described below.Figure 4Surface charge distribution of the STC. The rightorientation is turned ∼180 along the vertical axis from the leftorientation. Red color denotes overall negative charge, while blue indicates a positive charge. It is assumed that all heme propionates are negatively charged in solution.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The four bis-Histidine-ligated hemes are packed in pairs against each other. While hemes I-II and hemes III-IV exhibit a perpendicular orientation of heme planes, the planes of the central hemes II-III are stacked in a parallel fashion. Each heme has distinctive features, however, as can be seen from TableII. The N-terminal heme I is the most solvent-exposed heme, the distal side only covered by His65, Val64, and Ser6, while the remaining distal heme surface and Cys15 are completely solvent-exposed. More remarkable is the observation that pyrrole group D and the attached propionate group occupy two distinct conformations, the minor conformation (32% occupancy) being rotated by 15° from the main conformation and the pyrrole nitrogen atom being the pivotal point. The D propionate group either forms a single hydrogen bond to the backbone oxygen of conserved residue Ser25 in the main conformation or is disordered in the minor conformation. This unprecedented flexibility in the heme porphyrin plane itself is no doubt due to the extremely high solvent accessibility of this particular heme group and is detected due to the high resolution obtained. The His ligands are oriented parallel to each other, the proximal His19 is hydrogen-bonded to the charged and conserved Glu31, while the distal His65 is hydrogen-bonded to a positionally ill-defined water molecule. Given the high solvent accessibility and close interaction with the negatively charged Glu31, this redox center is most likely to have one of the lowest reduction potentials of the four heme groups. This conclusion does not correspond with the order of heme oxidation determined by NMR for the STC from the related S. frigidimarina for which it was observed that the hemes oxidize in the order IV-II-I-III (12Pessanha M. Brennan L. Xavier A.V. Cuthbertson P.M. Reid G.A. Chapman S.K. Turner D.L. Salgueiro C.A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It is possible that the redox potentials of the S. oneidensis MR1 STC are different, changing the order in which hemes oxidize to start with heme I. Other explanations for this discrepancy may be found in more subtle effects that counteract the influence of the high solvent accessibility on the redox potential.Table IIHeme characteristicsHeme IHeme IIHeme IIIHeme IVSolvent-accessible area (Å2)286245134250Heme-heme distanceaDistances listed are for the minimum distance between atoms that are part of the aromatic ring system for interprotein heme-heme contacts.

Open table in a new tab Heme II is slightly less solvent-exposed than heme I, the porphyrin plane being distinctively buckled. Propionate D is hydrogen-bonded to propionate A, which in turn interacts with solvent atoms, indicating that at least one propionate is an uncharged species (Fig. 2). This is the first observation of heme propionates hydrogen bonding at basic pH and is very similar to the hydrogen bonding of heme propionates in the crystal structure of the diheme NapB cytochrome c fromHaemophilus influenzae (3Brigé A. Leys D. Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Van Beeumen J.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4827-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The His ligands are oriented perpendicular to one another, the fifth ligand His39interacting with a water molecule, while the sixth ligand His9 is hydrogen-bonded to the backbone oxygen of the conserved Leu5. Heme III is clearly the least solvent-exposed of all four hemes with both cysteines well buried within the protein matrix. Propionate D is hydrogen-bonded to Asp46, which in turn interacts with both the sixth ligand His49 and the nitrogen backbone atom of Val48. Propionate A is slightly less defined and interacts with solvent molecules. The His ligands are oriented parallel, the angle of the His49 imidazole plane with the porphyrin group being offset roughly 30° from the normal perpendicular orientation. This deviation in ligation geometry might be due to the close contact of the imidazole plane with the conserved Met45 side chain sulfur atom. The low solvent accessibility of heme III leads to the conclusion that heme III has the highest potential despite the interaction of His49 with Asp46. This corresponds well with the conclusions drawn on the basis of NMR-monitored redox titrations of the S. frigidimarinaNCIM400 STC (12Pessanha M. Brennan L. Xavier A.V. Cuthbertson P.M. Reid G.A. Chapman S.K. Turner D.L. Salgueiro C.A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The C-terminal heme IV is relatively solvent-exposed, the porphyrin plane being almost perfectly flat. Propionate A interacts with the conserved Arg83 that is stacked against the proximal His79, while propionate D interacts with solvent molecules. The His ligands are oriented perpendicular with distal His52 interacting with the oxygen backbone of Val48, and the proximal His79 is hydrogen-bonded to a water molecule. The oxidized P21 structure contains six monomers in the asymmetric unit that each exhibit slight structural differences with the obtained atomic model in the oxidized orthorhombic crystal form and with each other (mean r.m.s.d., 0.31 Å for backbone atoms). An overlay of the Cα trace of the seven monomers indicates several regions that have significantly higher flexibility and B-factors than the average deviation in position or B-factor (Fig.5). Besides the N-terminal residues, these include the Ala10–Gly14 loop that was identified in the P212121 structure as having multiple backbone conformations, the Ser25–Gly30 loop, which is only weakly interacting with other parts of the structure, and the entire C-terminal fragment from Pro73 onward. The latter fragment is separated from the main part of the structure by the heme IV plane and is therefore only restricted in conformation with respect to the remainder of the protein by the covalent attachment at Pro73 and the ligation between heme IV and the distal His52. It clearly can be seen that the entire region, including the porphyrin group of heme IV, has considerable rotational freedom with Pro73 and the His52-iron ligation serving as hinge points. The maximal difference between monomers for identical backbone atoms is 2.0 Å and for the p"

The distribution and coupling of A2bR upon agonist stimulation with cytoplasmic structural proteins and the potential significance of this is not known. On the basis of effective coupling of minute second messenger signals to protein kinase A (PKA)1 we hypothesized sometime ago that A2bR might be compartmentalized with signaling molecules and their targets (10Strohmeier G.R.

Such compartmentalization of signaling networks in a multiprotein complex has been shown to result in both the stabilization of constituent proteins at the cell surface and enhanced efficiency of signaling (20Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). A common mechanism for establishing multiple protein complexes is via protein-protein interaction with submembrane scaffolding proteins. PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain proteins localized to the membrane-cytoskeletal interface have emerged as important organizing centers for regulatory complexes, and these scaffold-based regulatory proteins are often polarized to specific sites in polarized epithelial cells (20Sheng M.

In this study we examined the association of A2bR at rest and after stimulation with E3KARP, ezrin, and PKA. We show that the A2bR is recruited to the plasma membrane fraction upon stimulation with adenosine. The recruitment of the A2bR to the membrane is paralleled by its interaction with E3KARP and ezrin. Ezrin directly interacts with the A2bR and is activated in response to adenosine stimulation. Taken together, our data suggest that the A2bR, and its signaling complex, exists in the microdomain in the membrane, and adenosine signaling through the A2bR may be mediated by such close interaction and recruitment of the receptor to the membrane.

Confluent stock monolayers were subcultured by trypsinization. Experiments were done on cells plated for 7–8 days on permeable supports of 0.33 cm2 or 4.5 cm2(inserts). Inserts with rat tail collagen-coated polycarbonate membrane filter (0.4-μm pore size, Costar, Cambridge, MA) rested in wells containing media until steady-state resistance was achieved, as previously described (8Nash S.

All experiments were performed on T84 cells between passages 69 and 83. Caco2-BBE were grown as confluent monolayers in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and Ham’s F-12 medium supplemented with 15 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, 14 mm NaHCO3, and 10% newborn calf serum. Transfected cell lines were maintained in the same media containing 1.2 mg/ml G418. Cell surface biotinylation studies were carried out with confluent monolayers plated on collagen-coated permeable supports. CHO cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine calf serum supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin. Full-length A2bR cDNA was cloned into the pEGFP-C vector (CLONTECH) using HindIIIand BamHI restriction enzymes. Point mutation was introduced into the stop codon of the wild-type human A2bR cDNA (sense primer: CGGTGTGGGCCTACTCAGTTAGGCTCTCG and antisense primer: CGAGAGCCTAGACTGAGTAGGCCCACACCG) by site-directed mutagenesis using PCR-mediated overlap extension to facilitate fusion of the cDNA sequence using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The constructed plasmid cDNA sequences were verified by sequencing. Plasmids were purified using the Qiagen Maxiprep kit. Subconfluent Caco2-BBE cells were transfected with A2b-GFP vector using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) for 20 h in serum-free medium. Serum was added for the subsequent 48 h and stable transfectants were selected in medium containing 1.2 mg/ml G418. The 10 clones selected from each construct were maintained in 1.2 mg/ml G418 and were expanded. Clones showing the highest expression were generated by repeated sorting of fluorescent clones using fluorescence-activated cell sorter. PRK vector containing full-length A2bR was a generous gift from R. J. Mrsny (Genentech Inc., San Francisco, CA). Monolayers of T84 or Caco2-BBE cells were washed in HBSS, fixed in buffered formaldehyde for 20 min, incubated with the respective primary antibodies overnight in a humidity chamber, washed with HBSS, and subsequently incubated with fluorsceinated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Monolayers were also counterstained with rhodamine/phalloidin to visualize actin.

In the case of Caco2-BBE cells transfected with GFP containing vector, monolayers were directly fixed, stained with rhodamine/phalloidin, mounted on glass slides, and analyzed by confocal microscopy. Using actin staining, the apical most surface of the cell was marked as 0 μm and the basolateral surface was marked at the level of actin stress fiber (∼18.7 μm from the top of the cell). xysections taken at ∼1.2 μm from the top (above the level of tight junction) and at the level of actin stress fiber was used for quantitation of apical and basolateral surfaces, respectively. Cells were lysed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), EDTA, SDS, sodium orthovanadate, and sodium fluoride. SDS-PAGE was performed according to the Laemmli procedure using a 10% acrylamide gel. Proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with primary antibody (diluted 1:1000). Then membranes were incubated with corresponding peroxidase-linked secondary antibody diluted 1:2000, washed, and subsequently incubated with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences) before exposure to high performance chemiluminescence films (Amersham Biosciences). ForMr determination, polyacrylamide gels were calibrated using standard proteins (Bio-Rad) with Mrmarkers within the range 7,700 to 214,000.

Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting was done as described previously (26Merlin D., Si- Tahar M. Sitaraman S.V. Eastburn K. Williams I. Liu X. Hediger M.A. Madara J.L.

Briefly, confluent T84 monolayers grown in 45-cm2 inserts were washed with HBSS, equilibrated for 20 min at 37 °C, and stimulated with apical or basolateral adenosine (100 μm). A plasma membrane fraction was prepared from two 4.5-cm2 inserts/condition. The plasma membrane fraction obtained by this method, as previously shown, was not contaminated with cytoplasm or membranes from other compartments. This approach was chosen because the detergent solubility of some proteins such as the subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins or certain G protein-coupled receptors is well established. Caveolae were purified from the plasma membrane fraction using Opti-Prep gradient (27Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Adherent monolayers were detached with EDTA in HBSS (without Ca2+ or Mg2+), pelleted by centrifugation, and re-suspended in HBSS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells transfected with GFP-tagged A2bR were directly analyzed with FAC-Sort flow cytometer apparatus (BD PharMingen) as described (28Merlin D. Sitaraman S. Liu X. Eastburn K. Sun J. Kucharzik T.

Measurements of cAMP were performed on ethanol extracts of cells obtained from monolayers grown on permeable supports, using the radioimmunoassay kit as described by the supplier (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Briefly, after monolayers were washed with HBSS and incubated 10 min, baseline Isc readings were taken and then adenosine was added. Cells were lysed in the extract buffer (66% ethanol, 33% HBSS, 1 mmphosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine). Monolayers were compacted, centrifuged, and an aliquot (100 μl) was used for radioimmunoassay (10Strohmeier G.R. Reppert S.M. Lencer W.I. Madara J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2387-2394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The band intensity of Western blot was quantitated using a gel documentation system (Alpha Innotech Co., San Leandro, CA). Quantitation of confocal images were performed on unprocessed images using the Metamorph Imaging System software (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA) as described (29Volpicelli L.A. Lah J.J. Levey A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47590-47598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The average grayscale pixel intensity +1 S.D. of a small region was measured and defined as background. To subtract background, the threshold of each channel was set at the value obtained for background. The average pixel intensity +1 S.D. was measured for the threshold images. The data are presented as the mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed using unpaired Student’st test. p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. We first characterized the commercially available antibody to the second extracellular loop of the A2bR. T84 cells, which we have shown previously express the A2bR, exhibited an immunoreactive band at 42–44 kDa (Fig. 1, lane 2). In addition, membrane fractions from HEK 293 cells overexpressing A2bR also showed a similar immunoreactive band at 42–44 kDa (Fig. 1,lane 1). The immunoreactive band was competed by peptide used to raise the antibody (data not shown). CHO cells, which lack expression of A2bR mRNA and cAMP response to agonist stimulation, showed no immunoreactivity at 42–44 kDa (Fig. 1, lane 4) and as seen in lane 3, CHO cells transfected with full-length A2bR showed an immunoreactive band at 42–44 kDa similar to that seen in T84 cells and HEK 293 cells. These data demonstrate that the antibody specifically recognizes the 42–44-kDa A2bR. We next examined the polarity of the A2bR. Using cell surface biotinylation, we show that the A2bR is present at both the apical and basolateral membranes of the model intestinal epithelial cells. However, as shown in Fig. 2A, the A2bR expression is significantly higher at the basolateral membrane compared with the apical membrane (apical:basolateral ratio, 1:3.1 ± 0.9, mean ± S.D., n = 6, p < 0.001). CD 73, an apically expressed protein (11Strohmeier G.R. Lencer W.I. Thompson L.F. Carlson S.L. Moe S.J. Carnes D.K. Mrsny R.J. Madara J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2588-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), showed an apical:basolateral ratio of 5 ± 0.9:1 (mean ± S.D.,n = 3, p < 0.01), whereas β1 integrin, a basolaterally expressed protein (30McCormick B.A. Nusrat A. Parkos C.A. D'Andrea L. Hofman P.M. Carnes D. Liang T.W. Madara J.L. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1414-1421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed an apical:basoateral ratio of 1:7 ± 0.5 (relative band density mean ± S.D., n = 3, p < 0.001) (Fig. 2B). Next we examined the distribution of A2bR using confocal microscopy (Fig. 3). Consistent with our data on cell surface biotinylation, the A2bR is expressed both at the apical and basolateral surface of T84 cells (Fig.3A). The en face (xy plane) images of the T84 epithelia were taken at the apical and basolateral membranes. To quantitate the cell surface expression of A2bR, the pixel intensity of the confocal images taken at the apical and basolateral surfaces were measured as described under “Materials Methods.” As seen in Fig. 3B, the ratio of pixel intensity of apical:basolateral A2b receptor was 1:1.7 ± 0.2 (relative units mean ± S.D.,n = 8, p < 0.001) compared with the CD 73 and β1 integrin apical:basolateral ratio of 5 ± 0.2:1 and 1:3 ± 0.3, respectively (relative units, mean ± S.D., n = 3, p < 0.01).Figure 3Confocal microscopy of A2bR.A, monolayers were fixed and stained with anti-A2b antibody followed by fluoroscein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (A2bR , anti-CD 73, or anti-β1integrin; green). Monolayers were also stained with rhodamine/phalloidin (actin, red). Vertical sections (xz) were taken off the monolayers to define the top (set at 0 μm) and bottom of the monolayer. En facesections (xy) were then generated from apical and basolateral planes in the vertical section. Shown here are en face (xy) images taken at the level of apical (at 1.2 μm, above the level of tight junction) and basolateral (at 18.7 μm, level of stress fiber) pole of the epithelial monolayer and computer reconstructed vertical section (xz) images taken through full thickness of the monolayer. B, the pixel intensity frompanel A was quantitated as described under “Materials and Methods.” The bar graphs represent the relative pixel intensity apical (A) versus basolateral (B) membrane, mean ± S.D.; *, p < 0.001; **, p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Based on its cDNA sequence, A2bR is predicted to have a molecular mass of 36 kDa. However, our data suggest that the A2bR in T84 cells is 42–44 kDa. To verify the molecular mass of the A2bR in intestinal epithelial cells we stably transfected the intestinal cell line, Caco2-BBE, with GFP-tagged A2bR. As shown in Fig.4A, GFP-A2b-transfected Caco2-BBE cells show a shift in fluorescence compared with untransfected cells demonstrating a high level of fusion-protein expression. We then used an anti-GFP antibody to immunoprecipitate the GFP-A2bR fusion protein from whole cell lysates and detected the A2bR on a Western blot using anti-A2bR antibodies. As seen in Fig.4B, transfected cells exhibit a ∼68–70-kDa band corresponding to the GFP-A2bR fusion protein. This band was not present in the wild-type Caco2-BBE cells or in cells transfected with GFP vector alone (lanes 1 and 2, respectively). The GFP-A2b fusion protein expression was enhanced after the second and third round of fluorescence-activated cell sorting of fluorescent clones (lanes 3 and 4, respectively). We next determined the steady-state distribution of GFP-A2bR fusion protein expression using cell surface biotinylation. Similar to the T84 cells, the A2bR was present at both the apical and basolateral surface but predominant at the basolateral surface (apical to basolateral ratio of 1:6 ± 0.5, relative units from a densitometric scan, mean ± S.D., n = 3, p < 0.003) (Fig.4C). CD 73, an apically expressed protein in Caco2-BBE cells (11Strohmeier G.R. Lencer W.I. Thompson L.F. Carlson S.L. Moe S.J. Carnes D.K. Mrsny R.J. Madara J.L. J. Clin.

J. 1992; 283: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), showed an apical:basolateral ratio of 5 ± 0.9:1, whereas β1 integrin (30McCormick B.A. Nusrat A. Parkos C.A. D'Andrea L. Hofman P.M. Carnes D. Liang T.W. Madara J.L. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1414-1421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed an apical:basoateral ratio of 1:6 ± 0.3 (relative units from densitometric scan, mean ± S.D., n = 3, p < 0.01 andp < 0.001, respectively, data not shown). Confocal images of transfected Caco2-BBE cells also show the expression of the A2bR at the apical and basolateral surface (Fig. 4D). To quantitate the cell surface expression of GFP-A2bR, the pixel intensity of the confocal images taken at the apical and basolateral surfaces were measured. The ratio of pixel intensity of apical:basolateral A2b receptor was 1:3 ± 0.5 (relative pixel units, mean ± S.D.,n = 3, p < 0.01). CD 73 and β1 integrin showed an apical:basolateral ratio of 4.6 ± 0.6:1 and 1:3.8 ± 0.2, respectively (relative pixel units, mean ± S.D., n = 3, p < 0.005 and p < 0.001, respectively, data not shown). To determine whether the GFP-A2bR fusion protein was functional, the cells were stimulated with adenosine and intracellular cAMP was measured 5 min after stimulation. Apical or basolateral stimulation of GFP-A2bR-transfected cells with adenosine induced an 8-fold increase in cAMP compared with cells transfected with vector alone (Fig.4E). These data demonstrate that Caco2-BBE cells transfected with GFP-tagged A2bR has a similar molecular mass as the endogenous A2bR in T84 cells. Having established the specificity of the antibody to the native receptor in T84 cells, we next studied the effect of agonist stimulation on the distribution of A2bR. Since Caco2-BBE cells are known to possess more than one type of adenosine receptor, T84 cells in which A2bR is the only adenosine receptor present were used to further characterize the A2bR. As seen in Fig. 5, there was a small amount of A2bR detected in the plasma membrane fraction in resting cells and the bulk of the receptor was present in the postnuclear supernatant. In contrast, receptor density was significantly increased in the plasma membrane 5 min after apical or basolater"
https://openalex.org/W2054122143,"YB-1 is a member of the cold shock domain family of proteins that is important for signaling DNA damage and cell proliferation. YB-1 is induced by DNA damage and can also recognize cisplatin-modified DNA. In this study we observed a 6-fold increase in the steady-state level of YB-1 mRNA in response to cisplatin exposure in cells of the human cancer cell line KB. We present evidence from cotransfection experiments for a critical role of c-Myc and p73 in the transactivation of the YB-1 promoter. p73 transactivated the YB-1 promoter in experiments with Saos-2 cells, which express c-Myc, but not with HO15.19 cells, which lack c-Myc. In turn, c-Myc transactivated an intact YB-1 promoter but not a YB-1 promoter with a mutant E-box, indicating that the E-box is necessary for the response of the promoter to cisplatin. We also found that p73 interacts with c-Myc in vitro and in vivo. Using deletion mutants we showed that the DNA-binding domain of p73 and the C-terminal region of c-Myc are required for the interaction. Furthermore, p73 stimulated the interaction of Max with c-Myc and promoted binding of the c-Myc-Max complex to its target DNA. Our data suggest that p73 stimulates the transcription of the YB-1 promoter by enhancing recruitment of the c-Myc-Max complex to the E-box.

Y-box-binding protein-1 glutathione S-transferase hemagglutinin phosphate-buffered saline electrophoretic mobility shift assay YB-1,1 a transcription factor first identified by its ability to bind to the inverted CCAAT box (Y-box), has been implicated in gene transcription, cell proliferation (1Ladomery M. Sommerville J. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and cisplatin resistance (2Didier D.K. Schiffenbauer J. Woulfe S.L. Zacheis M. Schwartz B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7322-732616Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). YB-1 contains a unique DNA-binding domain, the cold shock domain, that is highly conserved in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (1Ladomery M. Sommerville J. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 3Wolffe A.P. Tafuri S. Ranjan M. Familari M. New Biol. 1992; 4: 290-298PubMed Google Scholar, 4Wolffe A.P. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). YB-1 is mainly cytoplasmic, but it is translocated to the nucleus when cells are treated with anticancer agents (5Koike K. Uchiumi T. Ohga T. Toh S. Wada M. Kohno K. Kuwano M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Furthermore, YB-1 mRNA accumulates when cells are treated with UV irradiation or anticancer agents (6Ohga T. Koike K. Ono M. Makino Y. Itagaki Y. Tanimoto M. Kuwano M. Kohno K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4224-4228PubMed Google Scholar). YB-1 can bind to cisplatin-modified DNA and interacts with PCNA (7Ise T. Nagatani G. Imamura T. Kato K. Takano H. Nomoto M. Izumi H. Ohmori H. Okamoto T. Ohga T. Uchiumi T. Kuwano M. Kohno K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 342-346PubMed Google Scholar). Cancer chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin exert their cytotoxic effect by inducing DNA damage and activating apoptosis (11Eastmann A. Chemistry and Biochemistry of a Leading Anticancer Drug. Wiley VCH, Basel, Switzerland1999: 111-134Google Scholar). The p53 tumor suppressor gene family is central to the pathway that inhibits cell cycle progression following damage (8Gottlieb T.M. Oren M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 77-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 9Levine A.J.

It consists of transcription factors that bind to DNA in a sequence-specific manner (12Oren M. Prives C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: 13-19PubMed Google Scholar), and their activation in response to DNA damage elicits apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. We have recently found that YB-1 interacts with p53 and can regulate gene expression (13Okamoto T. Izumi H. Imamura T. Takano H. Ise T. Uchiumi T. Kuwano M. Kohno K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6194-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We have also identified multiple consensus 5′-CACGTG-3′ sequences, the so-called E-boxes (15Luscher B. Larsson L.G. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2955-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) in the YB1 promoter (14Makino Y. Ohga T. Toh S. Koike K. Okumura K. Wada M. Kuwano M. Kohno K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1873-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). c-Myc is a transcription factor that has also been found to induce apoptotic cell death under certain conditions and to modulate cellular susceptibility to anticancer agents such as cisplatin (16Askew D.S. Ashmun R.A. Simmons B.C. Cleveland J.L. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1915-1922PubMed Google Scholar, 17Evan G.I. Wyllie A.H. Gilbert C.S. Littlewood T.D. Land H. Brooks M. Waters C.M. Penn L.Z. Hancock D.C. Cell. 1992; 69: 119-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2771) Google Scholar). Thus, both YB-1 and c-Myc may play key roles in cell proliferation as well as in the DNA damage signaling pathway (18Schmidt E.V. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2988-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 19Soucie E.L. Annis M.G. Sedivy J. Filmus J. Leber B. Andrews D.W. Penn L.Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4725-4736Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Interestingly, c-Myc is known to bind to and transactivate via E-boxes (15Luscher B. Larsson L.G. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2955-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The transcriptional apparatus responsible for signaling DNA damage is poorly understood, and YB-1 may provide useful insight into this process. We show that p73, a close relative of p53, interacts with c-Myc and stimulates the E-box binding activity of the c-Myc-Max complex. Both c-Myc and p73 activate YB-1 transcription and may regulate important biological processes via their effect on YB-1 gene expression. Our data may help to account for the dual function of c-Myc in cell proliferation and apoptosis. The KB human epidermoid cancer cell line was grown in modified Eagle's medium (Nissui, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The Saos-2 human osteosarcoma cell line, the HO15.19 rat fibroblast cell line, and the COS-1 monkey kidney cell line were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.

The cell lines were maintained in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Cisplatin was from Sigma. Drugs were added directly to the culture medium at the indicated times. An anti-YB-C antibody to the C-tail domain of YB-1 was generated as described previously (5Koike K. Uchiumi T. Ohga T. Toh S. Wada M. Kohno K. Kuwano M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Anti-c-Myc (N262) polyclonal antibody, anti-c-Myc (9E10) monoclonal antibody, and anti-HA (F-7) monoclonal antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-p73α antibody, anti-HA (3F10) (hemagglutinin)-peroxidase, and anti-FLAG (M2) monoclonal antibody were purchased from Wako (Osaka, Japan), Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and Sigma, respectively. The YB-1-Luc and YB-1-m-Luc utilized in the luciferase assays were prepared by digesting pYB-1-CAT (14Makino Y. Ohga T. Toh S. Koike K. Okumura K. Wada M. Kuwano M. Kohno K.

The PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega). To obtain the YB-1-Luc plasmid, aBglII-HindIII fragment including nucleotides −661 to +295 of the YB-1 promoter was ligated into theBglII-HindIII site of vector pGL3-basic (Promega, Madison, WI). To generate the YB-1-m-Luc plasmid, which contains a mutation in the E-box, a BglII-HindIII fragment including nucleotides −661 to +295 of the YB-1 promoter was ligated into the BglII-HindIII sites of vector pGL3-basic. p21-Luc, utilized in the luciferase assay, has been described previously (13Okamoto T.

N-terminally truncated p73 was cloned by PCR using the following primer pairs: 5′-ATGACTACATCTGTCATGGCCC-3′ and 5′-TCAGTGGATCTCGGCCTCCGTGAACTCC-3′. The PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega). The p73 cDNA was cloned into pcDNA for expression in mammalian cells and designated p73ΔN. To obtain GST-p73α, a NheI (filled in)-NotI fragment of pcDNA3-HA-p73α was ligated into theSmaI-NotI site of pGEX4T (AmershamBiosciences). To prepare a FLAG or HA-tagged fusion protein for expression inEscherichia coli, TH-FLAG vector and TH-HA vector were prepared by digesting the pThioHis vector (Invitrogen) withNdeI and Acc65I. It was then self-ligated after T4 DNA polymerase treatment to delete the thioredoxin, and the following double-stranded oligonucleotides were inserted: for FLAG, 5′-ATGGACTACAAGGACGATGATGACAAGGGC-3′, and for HA, 5′-ATGGGTTATCCGTATGATGTTCCTGATTATGCTAGCCTCGGT-3′. To obtain HA-p73α, a NheI (filled in)-NotI fragment of pcDNA3-HA-p73α was ligated into the TH-HA vector. HA-p73α deletion mutants Δ545–636, Δ396–636, Δ313–636, and Δ228–636 were obtained by partial or complete digestion, as appropriate, to delete the TH-HA-p73α fragment from theSdaI, BfmI, EcoO109I, and PsyI sites to the C terminus. Relevant restriction enzyme sites are shown in Fig. 7A. To obtain GST-Max, TH-FLAG-Max, and TH-FLAG-TBP, full-length cDNAs of human Max and TBP were amplified by PCR using the following primer pairs: for Max, 5′-TGAGCGATAACGATGACATCG-3′ and 5′-GCTTAGCTGGCCTCCATCCGG-3′, and for TBP, 5′-GGATCAGAACAACAGCCTGC-3′ and 5′-TTACGTCGTCTTCCTGAATCC-3′.

All of the PCR products were sequenced by the ABI 377 DNA sequencing system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Total RNA from parental and cisplatin-treated cells was isolated using Sepasol (Nakalai, Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). RNA samples (5 μg/lane) were separated on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to a Hybond N+filter (Amersham Biosciences) with 10× SSC. Prehybridization and hybridization were performed as described previously (24Furukawa M. Uchiumi T. Nomoto M. Takano H. Morimoto R.I. Naito S. Kuwano M. Kohno K. J. Biol.

The cells were lysed with Nonidet P-40 to a final concentration of 0.5%, and the lysate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min. The resulting nuclear pellet was resuspended in 300 μl of ice-cold 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and incubated for 15 min on ice with frequent gentle mixing. Following centrifugation at 21,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge, to remove insoluble material, the supernatant (nuclear fraction) was stored at −80 °C until use. The protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar). Either nuclear extracts (see Fig.3A) or whole cell extracts (see Fig. 3C) were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) using a semi-dry blotter. A prestained protein marker was used as a molecular weight standard. The membrane was immunoblotted with anti-c-Myc (N262), anti-Max, anti-p73α, anti-YB-1, and anti-HA antibodies and then developed by chemiluminescence using an ECL kit according to the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). For transient transfections, KB, HO15.19, and Saos-2 cells were plated at a density of 5 × 104cells/well 1 day before transfection. The cells were cotransfected at ∼50% confluence with 0.2 μg of reporter plasmid, 0.2–0.4 μg of expression plasmid, and 0.3 μg of pCH110 (a β-galactosidase expression plasmid; Promega) using 2 μl of SuperFect according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). Three hours later, the cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in fresh medium. Each expression plasmid and reporter plasmid was standardized individually to a molar ratio of 1:1, and the total amount of DNA/well was adjusted to 1.0 μg by the addition of a mock DNA plasmid. After 48 h the cells were lysed with 100 μl/well of reporter lysis buffer (Promega). After a brief centrifugation, the luciferase activity in the resulting supernatants was assayed using a Picagene kit (Toyoinki, Tokyo, Japan) as described previously (7Ise T. Nagatani G. Imamura T. Kato K. Takano H. Nomoto M. Izumi H. Ohmori H. Okamoto T. Ohga T. Uchiumi T. Kuwano M. Kohno K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 342-346PubMed Google Scholar). Light intensity was measured for 15 s with a luminometer (Dynatech ML 1500, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). All of the cells were cotransfected with pCH110 as a control for transfection efficiency; β-galactosidase activity was measured using a β-galactosidase enzyme assay system (Promega) and expressed as a ratio of the corrected luciferase activity of cells cotransfected with vector. The results shown are normalized to β-galactosidase activity and are representative of at least three independent experiments. Protein-DNA cross-linking was performed by incubating KB cells with formaldehyde at a final concentration of 1% for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were washed with PBS and collected by centrifugation at 500 ×g for 5 min. They were then lysed in Buffer X (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 15 min on ice. The lysate was sonicated with 10 pulses of 10 s each at 50–60% of maximum power with a sonicator (TAITEC, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a micro tip to reduce the chromatin fragments to an average size of less than 500 bp. Soluble chromatin was precleared by addition of 10 mg of protein A-Sepharose. An aliquot of precleared chromatin containing 1 × 106 cells was removed and used in the subsequent PCR analysis. The remainder of the chromatin was divided into lots each corresponding to 1 × 106 cells and diluted with Buffer X. The protein-DNA was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 2 μg of antibody, mouse IgG, or rabbit preimmune serum in a final volume of 800 μl. Immune complexes were collected by incubation with 15 μl of protein A/G-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein A/G-agarose pellets were washed once with 1 ml of Buffer X, once with high salt Buffer X (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), once with LiCl buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, pH 8.1), and twice with 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. The immune complexes were then eluted twice with 250 μl of elution buffer (0.1 m NaHCO3, 1% SDS). To reverse protein-DNA cross-linking, The eluted samples were incubated with 0.2m NaCl for 4–5 h at 65 °C. The samples were digested with proteinase K (0.04 mg/ml) for 2 h at 45 °C and then with RNase A (0.02 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. DNA was purified with phenol:chloroform followed by ethanol precipitation. The purified DNA was resuspended in 10 μl of H2O. Aliquots of 2 μl of serial dilutions were analyzed by PCR with the appropriate primer pairs. The YB-1 promoter primers were 5′-AGATCTCTATCACGTGGCTGTTGC-3′ and 5′-AAGCTTATCAGTCCTCCATTCTCATTGG-3′. The HMG1 promoter primers were 5′-GCCTAGTTGGCATTCTCGTA-3′ and 5′-GCTCTGGGAACACTCCCACCC-3′. Amplification was performed for a predetermined optimal number of cycles. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels, which were stained with ethidium bromide. COS-1 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well. The following day the cells were cotransfected with 1.5 μg of c-Myc and HA-p73α expression plasmids along with 6 μl of SuperFect according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). 3 h following transfection, the cells were washed with PBS, and the medium was replaced with fresh medium. After 48 h the cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in Buffer X. After incubating for 30 min on ice, the lysates were centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants (1 mg) were incubated for 60 min at 4 °C with 2 μg of mouse IgG, preimmune rabbit IgG, anti-HA (F-7) antibody, anti-c-Myc (N262) antibody, or anti-p73α antibody, in each case together with 10 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Qiagen), and the beads were washed three times with binding buffer. Nuclear extracts of control and cisplatin-treated KB cells were also incubated with anti-c-Myc antibody. The immunoprecipitated samples and starting material were separated on a 10% SDS gel and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were immunoblotted with anti-c-Myc (N262) antibody, anti-HA-peroxidase, or anti-p73α antibody and developed by chemiluminescence as described above. Expression of recombinant GST, HA, and FLAG fusion proteins was induced by 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 1 h at 25 °C as described previously (7Ise T. Nagatani G. Imamura T. Kato K. Takano H. Nomoto M. Izumi H. Ohmori H. Okamoto T. Ohga T. Uchiumi T. Kuwano M. Kohno K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 342-346PubMed Google Scholar). The bacteria were collected by centrifugation at 3,000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C. The cells were lysed in Buffer X and subsequently sonicated for 10 s at 4 °C. After incubating on ice for 30 min, the lysates were centrifuged at 21,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were stored at −80 °C until use. GST and full-length GST-c-Myc were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. After the immobilized GST fusion proteins had been washed three times with Buffer X, soluble HA-p73α, or its deletion mutants, FLAG-Max, and FLAG-TBP fusion proteins were added with 1 mm dithiothreitol and further incubated for 3.5 h at 4 °C. The binding samples were washed three times with Buffer X and separated on a 10% gel by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, immunoblotted with anti-HA-peroxidase, and developed by chemiluminescence as described above. To prepare purified GST fusion proteins, GST-Myc and GST-Max immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads were eluted with elution buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 20 mm reduced glutathione according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). The concentrations of the GST fusion proteins were equalized with GST elution buffer. HA-p73α protein was made in a coupled transcription and translation system (Promega). Briefly, 0.5 μg of DNA was added directly to 20 μl of transcription and translation rabbit reticulocyte lysate with 0.5 μl of methionine, and the reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 90 min. The translated products were stored at −80 °C until use. Oligonucleotides from the E-box and p53 consensus binding sites were used as probes. The sequences were: YB-1 E-box (E-box Y), 5′-GGCCCTCTCTATCACGTGGCTGTTGC-3′; E-box consensus (E-box C), 5′-GGTCAGACCACGTGGTCGGG-3′, and Y-box, 5′-GGTGAGGCTGATTGGCTGGGCAGGA-3′ (13Okamoto T. Izumi H.

The E-box probe was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified on a 15% polyacrylamide gel in 1× TBE buffer. EMSA was performed as described previously (7Ise T. Nagatani G. Imamura T. Kato K. Takano H. Nomoto M. Izumi H. Ohmori H. Okamoto T. Ohga T. Uchiumi T. Kuwano M. Kohno K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 342-346PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, eluted GST fusion proteins and 4 ng of radiolabeled oligonucleotides were mixed in reaction buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mmEDTA, 5% glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and incubated for 20 min at 20 °C (26Kitaura H.

The binding reactions were analyzed on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer, followed by autoradiography as described previously (7Ise T. Nagatani G. Imamura T. Kato K. Takano H. Nomoto M. Izumi H. Ohmori H. Okamoto T. Ohga T. Uchiumi T. Kuwano M. Kohno K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 342-346PubMed Google Scholar). For the competition experiments, preincubation was performed in the presence of 10× or 40× unlabeled competitor DNA for 15 min at 20 °C before the addition of radiolabeled oligonucleotides. We first examined YB-1 gene expression in the in the human cancer cell line KB and found that YB-1mRNA increased in response to cisplatin treatment (Fig. 1A). We tested whether cisplatin could induce luciferase expression from reporter constructs in cells that express high levels of c-Myc and p73α. Significant induction of luciferase activity was observed when intact YB-1 Luc was transfected into KB cells but not when YB-1-m-Luc, whose promoter contains a mutant E-box, was introduced (Fig. 1, Band C). The E-box that is proximal to the transcriptional start site of the YB-1 promoter has the nucleotide sequence 5′-CACGTG-3′ that is bound with high affinity by c-Myc (28Amati B. Dalton S. Brooks M.W. Littlewood T.D. Evan G.I. Land H. Nature. 1992; 359: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 29Amin C. Wagner A.J. Hay N. Mol. Cell.

It therefore seemed possible that c-Myc expression might affect the outcome of such reporter assays. To show that c-Myc binds specifically to the YB-1 promoter in vivo, we utilized a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. PCR amplication of the YB-1 promoter was carried out with DNA extracted from the immunocomplex obtained with anti-c-Myc antibody. Fig. 2shows that the YB-1 promoter sequence was significantly enriched in this complex. In controls, no HMG1 promoter sequence was detected in the immunocomplex (Fig. 2B), and enrichment of the YB-1 promoter sequence was not observed with preimmune serum or mouse IgG.FIG. 2c-Myc binds to the YB-1 promoter in vivo.A, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments with KB cells. Formaldehyde cross-linked chromatin was isolated from KB cell. Chromatin was immunoprecipitated with antibody to c-Myc and preimmune or monoclonal IgG. Immunoprecipitated DNA was purified and analyzed by PCR, together with placenta DNA, using primers specific for the YB-1 promoter. The amounts of placenta DNA used as a positive control were 3, 10, 30, and 90 ng (right toleft). Immunoprecipitated DNA was diluted to 1/27, 1/9, and 1/3 (right to left). Amplification products were electrophoresed in 2.0% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide.Lane M, DNA ladder mix marker (MBI, Fermentas, Lithuania). The arrowhead indicates 725 bp of the YB-1 promoter sequence. B, chromatin immunoprecipitation was carried out as described above. Immunoprecipitated DNA was purified and analyzed, together with placenta DNA, by PCR, using primers specific for the HMG1 promoter. The arrowhead indicates 441 bp of the HMG1 promoter sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Western blots with c-Myc antiserum indicated that the level of c-Myc protein increased dramatically after cisplatin treatment (Fig.3A). Cisplatin treatment has been shown to stabilize p73 protein (32Gong J.G. Costanzo A. Yang H.Q. Melino G. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Levrero M. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar), and as expected, treatment of KB cells with cisplatin increased p73 protein levels (Fig.3A). We also examined whether overexpression of p73 can induce the expression of endogenous YB-1 in a c-Myc-dependent manner. As expected, a significant increase of endogenous YB-1 was observed when p73 was overexpressed in Saos-2 cells (Fig. 3C) but not in rat HO15.19/c-Myc null cells (19Soucie E.L. Annis M.G. Sedivy J.

Because the induction of p73 after treatment with cisplatin correlates with the induction of c-Myc, we tested the effect of p73 and c-Myc on YB-1 promoter activity. To determine whether p73 or c-Myc is responsible for the YB-1 promoter activity, we utilized two cell lines: Saos-2/p53 null cells, which express low levels of p73α (data not shown), and HO15.19/c-myc null cells (19Soucie E.L.

The SV40 promoter-Luc plasmid (P2) served as a control, and we transected the YB-1 promoter-luciferase reporter, together with increasing amounts of p73 or c-Myc expression vectors, into these cell lines. c-Myc activated the intact YB-1 promoter but not the reporter with an E-box mutation in HO15.19 cells (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, p73 was able to increase YB-1 promoter activity in Saos-2 cells (Fig. 3B) but not in HO15.19 cells (Fig.4B). Because there is no p73-binding site in the YB-1 promoter, this suggests that p73 regulates expression indirectly by promoting binding of c-Myc to the E-box. To examine whether p73 interacts with c-Myc, we performed coimmunoprecipitation assays. Because p73α is expressed at low levels in tumor cell lines (33Ikawa S. Nakagawara A. Ikawa Y.

https://openalex.org/W2170519462,"Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive sphingolipid metabolite that has novel dual actions. S1P is the ligand for a family of G protein-coupled receptors known as S1PRs that mediate various physiological functions. Growth factors rapidly activate sphingosine kinase type 1 (SPHK1) resulting in phosphorylation of sphingosine to form S1P, which plays important roles in cell growth regulation and protection from apoptosis. However, little is known of the mechanism(s) by which SPHK activity is regulated. Using a yeast two-hybrid screening approach, we cloned a 3-kb cDNA encoding a SPHK1-interacting protein (SKIP). BLAST analysis revealed that SKIP corresponded to the C-terminal region of a larger (∼7 kb) cDNA that encoded a protein with a high degree of similarity to a family of protein kinase A anchor proteins (AKAP). In confirmation of the yeast two-hybrid assay, glutathione S-transferase (GST)-SPHK1 specifically pulled down SKIP, whereas GST did not. Moreover, immunoprecipitation of in vitro translated SPHK1 and SKIP revealed that SKIP and SPHK1 are tightly associated. Furthermore, SKIP overexpression in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts reduced SPHK1 activity and interfered with its biological functions. The apoptotic-sparing effect of SPHK1 against serum deprivation was reduced when co-transfected with SKIP. In addition, SPHK1-enhanced cell proliferation was also abolished by SKIP, with a corresponding decrease in activation of ERK. Taken together, these results indicate that SKIP is a novel protein likely to play a regulatory role in the modulation of SPHK1 activity.

This has important clinical implications, including prevention of sterility after chemo- or radiation therapy, as increased S1P or decreased ceramide can prevent anti-cancer drug and radiation-induced oocyte loss, the event that drives premature ovarian failure and infertility in female cancer patients (11Perez G.I.

FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2649-2659Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However the intracellular targets of S1P have not yet been identified, making this a controversial issue (18Hla T. Lee M.J. Ancellin N. Paik J.H. Kluk M.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1875-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Understanding of the complex interplay between intra- and extracellular actions of S1P is further complicated because endogenously produced S1P activates S1P1 in an autocrine or paracrine manner, and this transactivation plays a critical role in PDGF-directed cell migration (23Hobson J.P. Rosenfeldt H.M. Barak L.S. Olivera A. Poulton S. Caron M.G. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Science. 2001; 291: 1800-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 32Rosenfeldt H.M. Hobson J.P. Maceyka M. Olivera A. Nava V.E. Milstien S. Spiegel S. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2649-2659Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Conversely, binding of S1P to its receptors can activate SPHK and increase S1P levels (33Meyer zu Heringdorf D. Lass H. Kuchar I. Lipinski M. Alemany R. Rumenapp U. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 414: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).The importance of S1P as a lipid mediator prompted the purification and cloning of SPHK1 (34Olivera A. Kohama T., Tu, Z.

Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19513-19520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Overexpression of SPHK1 promotes cell survival and protects cells from apoptotic insults, such as serum withdrawal (31Olivera A. Kohama T. Edsall L.C. Nava V. Cuvillier O. Poulton S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 545-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Recently it has been suggested thatspk1 may be an oncogene as its overexpression induces colony formation in soft agar and formation of tumors in NOD/SCID mice (37Xia P. Gamble J.R. Wang L. Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A. Wattenberg B.W. D'Andrea R.J. Vadas M.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1527-1530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). In agreement, it has been shown that γ-radiation sensitivity of prostate cancer cells correlates with SPHK1 activity (38Nava V.E. Cuvillier O. Edsall L.C. Kimura K. Milstien S. Gelmann E.P. Spiegel S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4468-4474PubMed Google Scholar). Despite its central roles, little is known of how SPHK1 activity is regulated. In this study, we used the yeast two-hybrid screening system to identify proteins that interact with SPHK1 and potentially regulate its function. We cloned a SPHK-interacting protein (SKIP) that interacts with SPHK1 in vitro and in vivo to regulate its activity and biological functions.DISCUSSIONSPHK1 belongs to a family of enzymes expressed in a wide variety of organisms from plants through higher mammals (48Liu H. Maceyka M. Chakravarty D. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. 2002; 71: 493-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite its importance in regulating sphingolipid metabolite levels, and its potential roles in cell growth and survival, there are only a few studies on its regulation. Previously, it was shown that acidic phospholipids activate SPHK1 in vitro (49Olivera A. Rosenthal J. Spiegel S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 60: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In agreement, aggregation of the high-affinity receptor FcγRI in monocytes resulted in activation of phospholipase D by tyrosine kinases, leading to activation of SPHK, which in turn resulted in transient release of stored calcium (50Melendez A. Floto R.A. Gillooly D.J. Harnett M.M. Allen J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9393-9402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, no phospholipid binding motifs are present in SPHK1 or SPHK2. Initially, protein kinase C (PKC) was thought to be involved in SPHK activation (51Buehrer B.M. Bardes E.S. Bell R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1303: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, more recently, using tyrosine phosphorylation site mutants of PDGFR, it was shown that although the tyrosine residue responsible for binding of phospholipase Cγ is required for PDGF-induced activation of SPHK1, calcium mobilization downstream of phospholipase Cγ, but not PKC activation, seems to be required for activation of SPHK by PDGF (52Olivera A. Edsall L. Poulton S. Kazlauskas A. Spiegel S. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1593-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). SPHK1 is rapidly activated in many cell types by a variety of stimuli (reviewed in Refs. 14Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 385-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar and 53Olivera A. Spiegel S. Prostaglandins. 2001; 64: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), but almost nothing is known of the molecular mechanisms involved. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we have now identified SKIP as a SPHK1-interacting protein that regulates its activity both in vitro and in situ. Several lines of evidence indicate that SKIP is a bona fide SPHK1 interactor, including specific SPHK1-GST pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Moreover, transfection of SKIP reduced SPHK1 activity without affecting its expression and abolished its biological effects, namely the ability to protect cells from apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal and enhanced cell proliferation. Interestingly, SKIP also suppressed ERK activation induced by serum or by SPHK1 overexpression, implicating ERK activation in signaling pathways downstream of S1P.Surprisingly, SKIP has high sequence homology to several members of the AKAP family. AKAPs were identified on the basis of their interaction with PKA, and their major role is to function as scaffolds and anchors to a variety of subcellular structures for its regulatory subunit (54Edwards A.S. Scott J.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar,55Diviani D. Scott J.D. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1431-1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since PKA has pleiotropic functions in many aspects of signaling, specificity is achieved through its targeting to the precise site of action. However, recent structural and functional analysis of AKAPs indicate a more complex role for these proteins in signal transduction. AKAPs also bind to a variety of other important signaling kinases and phosphatases, including PKC, PP1, PP2A, and Abl (56Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 57Takahashi M. Shibata H. Shimakawa M. Miyamoto M. Mukai H. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17267-17274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 58Westphal R.S. Tavalin S.J. Lin J.W. Alto N.M. Fraser I.D. Langeberg L.K. Sheng M. Scott J.D. Science. 1999; 285: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). For example, the AKAP Yotiao directly binds to theN-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor and targets both PKA and PP1 to the receptor, bringing together signaling enzymes with a potential substrate (58Westphal R.S. Tavalin S.J. Lin J.W. Alto N.M. Fraser I.D. Langeberg L.K. Sheng M. Scott J.D. Science. 1999; 285: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The similarity between the AKAP family and SKIP suggests that it might also act as a SPHK1 scaffolding or anchoring protein. For example, SPHK1 distribution within cells is mainly cytoplasmic (31Olivera A. Kohama T. Edsall L.C. Nava V. Cuvillier O. Poulton S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 545-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), although its substrate sphingosine is membrane-associated. SKIP might participate in tethering SPHK1 to membranes in the proximity of sphingosine and thereby promoting its activity. Recent studies have shown that following PDGF stimulation, SPHK1 shows a late phase of activation and nuclear localization, concomitantly with the initiation of DNA synthesis (41Kleuser B. Maceyka M. Milstien S. Spiegel S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 503: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and SKIP might be involved in recruiting SPHK1 to the nucleus.A novel mechanism of SPHK activation by TNF-α was recently described (59Xia P. Wang L. Moretti P.A. Albanese N. Chai F. Pitson S.M. D'Andrea R.J. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7996-8003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). This study revealed an association of SPHK with TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) one of the major mediators of TNF actions. This interaction between SPHK and TRAF2 was important for TNF-induced activation of NF-κB and prevention of apoptosis (59Xia P. Wang L. Moretti P.A. Albanese N. Chai F. Pitson S.M. D'Andrea R.J. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7996-8003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). However, there is little sequence homology or similarity between TRAF2 and SKIP, raising the intriguing possibility that there are different families of SPHK-interacting proteins that play different roles in its regulation. Sphingolipid metabolites such as ceramide, sphingosine, and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P),1 have been the subject of extensive studies in recent years and are implicated in the regulation of cell growth, survival, motility, and apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 1Merrill A.H., Jr. Schmelz E.-M.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Ceramide (N-acylsphingosine) is generated from sphingomyelin hydrolysis by sphingomyelinase. This enzyme is activated by a variety of stress stimuli, including proimflammatory cytokines, growth factor withdrawal, radiation, and anti-cancer drugs (2Kolesnick R. Hannun Y.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 224-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 4Hannun Y.A. Luberto C. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 73-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Ceramide, in turn, regulates various events leading to cell growth arrest and apoptosis (2Kolesnick R. Hannun Y.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 224-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 4Hannun Y.A. Luberto C.

Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 408-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Recent data also indicate that apoptosis can be mediated by de novo synthesis of ceramide (2Kolesnick R. Hannun Y.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 224-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 4Hannun Y.A. Luberto C. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 73-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Ceramide is further metabolized by ceramidase to sphingosine, which also exerts diverse biological effects, including inhibition of protein kinase C and induction of apoptosis (1Merrill A.H., Jr. Schmelz E.-M. Dillehay D.L. Spiegel S. Shayman J.A. Schroeder J.J. Riley R.T. Voss K.A. Wang E. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 142: 208-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 4Hannun Y.A. Luberto C.

In contrast to the growth inhibitory and pro-apoptotic effects of ceramide and sphingosine, a further metabolite, S1P, has been implicated in cell growth (7Olivera A. Spiegel S. Nature. 1993; 365: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar) and inhibition of ceramide-mediated apoptosis (8Cuvillier O. Pirianov G. Kleuser B. Vanek P.G. Coso O.A. Gutkind S. Spiegel S.

S1P is produced by phosphorylation of sphingosine catalyzed by sphingosine kinase (SPHK). SPHK is activated by a variety of stimuli, including PDGF, EGF (epidermal growth factor), NGF (nerve growth factor), vitamin D3, TNF-α, and cross-linking of FcεRI and FcγRI (reviewed in Refs. 3Spiegel S. Milstien S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar and 14Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 385-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). The relative cellular levels of sphingosine and S1P determined by SPHK are decisive for mast cell activation after FcεRI triggering (15Prieschl E.E. Csonga R. Novotny V. Kikuchi G.E. Baumruker T. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that the intracellular balance of ceramide and sphingosineversus S1P acts as an internal sensor that can regulate the decision of a cell to either undergo apoptosis or survive (8Cuvillier O. Pirianov G. Kleuser B. Vanek P.G. Coso O.A. Gutkind S. Spiegel S. Nature. 1996; 381: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar, 9Edsall L.C. Pirianov G.G. Spiegel S. J.

This has important clinical implications, including prevention of sterility after chemo- or radiation therapy, as increased S1P or decreased ceramide can prevent anti-cancer drug and radiation-induced oocyte loss, the event that drives premature ovarian failure and infertility in female cancer patients (11Perez G.I. Knudson C.M. Leykin L. Korsmeyer S.J. Tilly J.L. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1228-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 13Morita Y. Perez G.I. Paris F. Miranda S.R. Ehleiter D.

Recently, S1P was identified as the ligand for a family of G protein-coupled receptors known as the endothelial differentiation gene-1 (EDG-1) family, now collectively named S1PRs (14Pyne S.

FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2649-2659Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However the intracellular targets of S1P have not yet been identified, making this a controversial issue (18Hla T. Lee M.J. Ancellin N. Paik J.H. Kluk M.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1875-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Understanding of the complex interplay between intra- and extracellular actions of S1P is further complicated because endogenously produced S1P activates S1P1 in an autocrine or paracrine manner, and this transactivation plays a critical role in PDGF-directed cell migration (23Hobson J.P. Rosenfeldt H.M. Barak L.S. Olivera A. Poulton S. Caron M.G. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Science. 2001; 291: 1800-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 32Rosenfeldt H.M. Hobson J.P. Maceyka M. Olivera A. Nava V.E. Milstien S. Spiegel S. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2649-2659Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Conversely, binding of S1P to its receptors can activate SPHK and increase S1P levels (33Meyer zu Heringdorf D. Lass H. Kuchar I. Lipinski M. Alemany R. Rumenapp U. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 414: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The importance of S1P as a lipid mediator prompted the purification and cloning of SPHK1 (34Olivera A. Kohama T., Tu, Z.

Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19513-19520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Overexpression of SPHK1 promotes cell survival and protects cells from apoptotic insults, such as serum withdrawal (31Olivera A. Kohama T. Edsall L.C. Nava V. Cuvillier O. Poulton S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 545-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Recently it has been suggested thatspk1 may be an oncogene as its overexpression induces colony formation in soft agar and formation of tumors in NOD/SCID mice (37Xia P. Gamble J.R. Wang L. Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A. Wattenberg B.W. D'Andrea R.J. Vadas M.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1527-1530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). In agreement, it has been shown that γ-radiation sensitivity of prostate cancer cells correlates with SPHK1 activity (38Nava V.E. Cuvillier O. Edsall L.C. Kimura K. Milstien S. Gelmann E.P. Spiegel S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4468-4474PubMed Google Scholar). Despite its central roles, little is known of how SPHK1 activity is regulated. In this study, we used the yeast two-hybrid screening system to identify proteins that interact with SPHK1 and potentially regulate its function. We cloned a SPHK-interacting protein (SKIP) that interacts with SPHK1 in vitro and in vivo to regulate its activity and biological functions. DISCUSSIONSPHK1 belongs to a family of enzymes expressed in a wide variety of organisms from plants through higher mammals (48Liu H. Maceyka M. Chakravarty D. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. 2002; 71: 493-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite its importance in regulating sphingolipid metabolite levels, and its potential roles in cell growth and survival, there are only a few studies on its regulation. Previously, it was shown that acidic phospholipids activate SPHK1 in vitro (49Olivera A. Rosenthal J. Spiegel S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 60: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In agreement, aggregation of the high-affinity receptor FcγRI in monocytes resulted in activation of phospholipase D by tyrosine kinases, leading to activation of SPHK, which in turn resulted in transient release of stored calcium (50Melendez A. Floto R.A. Gillooly D.J. Harnett M.M. Allen J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9393-9402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, no phospholipid binding motifs are present in SPHK1 or SPHK2. Initially, protein kinase C (PKC) was thought to be involved in SPHK activation (51Buehrer B.M. Bardes E.S. Bell R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1303: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, more recently, using tyrosine phosphorylation site mutants of PDGFR, it was shown that although the tyrosine residue responsible for binding of phospholipase Cγ is required for PDGF-induced activation of SPHK1, calcium mobilization downstream of phospholipase Cγ, but not PKC activation, seems to be required for activation of SPHK by PDGF (52Olivera A. Edsall L. Poulton S. Kazlauskas A. Spiegel S. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1593-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). SPHK1 is rapidly activated in many cell types by a variety of stimuli (reviewed in Refs. 14Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 385-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar and 53Olivera A. Spiegel S. Prostaglandins. 2001; 64: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), but almost nothing is known of the molecular mechanisms involved. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we have now identified SKIP as a SPHK1-interacting protein that regulates its activity both in vitro and in situ. Several lines of evidence indicate that SKIP is a bona fide SPHK1 interactor, including specific SPHK1-GST pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Moreover, transfection of SKIP reduced SPHK1 activity without affecting its expression and abolished its biological effects, namely the ability to protect cells from apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal and enhanced cell proliferation. Interestingly, SKIP also suppressed ERK activation induced by serum or by SPHK1 overexpression, implicating ERK activation in signaling pathways downstream of S1P.Surprisingly, SKIP has high sequence homology to several members of the AKAP family. AKAPs were identified on the basis of their interaction with PKA, and their major role is to function as scaffolds and anchors to a variety of subcellular structures for its regulatory subunit (54Edwards A.S. Scott J.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar,55Diviani D. Scott J.D. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1431-1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since PKA has pleiotropic functions in many aspects of signaling, specificity is achieved through its targeting to the precise site of action. However, recent structural and functional analysis of AKAPs indicate a more complex role for these proteins in signal transduction. AKAPs also bind to a variety of other important signaling kinases and phosphatases, including PKC, PP1, PP2A, and Abl (56Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 57Takahashi M. Shibata H. Shimakawa M. Miyamoto M. Mukai H. Ono Y. J. Biol.

Science. 1999; 285: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). For example, the AKAP Yotiao directly binds to theN-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor and targets both PKA and PP1 to the receptor, bringing together signaling enzymes with a potential substrate (58Westphal R.S. Tavalin S.J. Lin J.W. Alto N.M. Fraser I.D. Langeberg L.K. Sheng M. Scott J.D. Science. 1999; 285: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The similarity between the AKAP family and SKIP suggests that it might also act as a SPHK1 scaffolding or anchoring protein. For example, SPHK1 distribution within cells is mainly cytoplasmic (31Olivera A. Kohama T. Edsall L.C. Nava V. Cuvillier O. Poulton S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 545-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), although its substrate sphingosine is membrane-associated. SKIP might participate in tethering SPHK1 to membranes in the proximity of sphingosine and thereby promoting its activity. Recent studies have shown that following PDGF stimulation, SPHK1 shows a late phase of activation and nuclear localization, concomitantly with the initiation of DNA synthesis (41Kleuser B. Maceyka M. Milstien S. Spiegel S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 503: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and SKIP might be involved in recruiting SPHK1 to the nucleus.A novel mechanism of SPHK activation by TNF-α was recently described (59Xia P. Wang L. Moretti P.A. Albanese N. Chai F. Pitson S.M. D'Andrea R.J. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7996-8003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). This study revealed an association of SPHK with TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) one of the major mediators of TNF actions. This interaction between SPHK and TRAF2 was important for TNF-induced activation of NF-κB and prevention of apoptosis (59Xia P. Wang L. Moretti P.A. Albanese N. Chai F. Pitson S.M. D'Andrea R.J.

However, there is little sequence homology or similarity between TRAF2 and SKIP, raising the intriguing possibility that there are different families of SPHK-interacting proteins that play different roles in its regulation.

https://openalex.org/W1964047957,Most materials freeze when cooled to sufficiently low temperature. We find that magnetic dipoles randomly distributed in a solid matrix condense into a spin liquid with spectral properties on cooling that are the diametric opposite of those for conventional glasses. Measurements of the nonlinear magnetic dynamics in the low-temperature liquid reveal the presence of coherent spin oscillations composed of hundreds of spins with lifetimes of up to 10 seconds. These excitations can be labeled by frequency and manipulated by the magnetic fields from a loop of wire and can permit the encoding of information at multiple frequencies simultaneously.

The molecular basis for the binding specificity of HuPON1 to HDL has not been established. Isolation of HuPON1 from HDL requires the use of detergents. We have determined the activity, dispersity, and oligomeric states of HuPON1 in solutions containing mild detergents using nondenaturing electrophoresis, size exclusion chromatography, and cross-linking. HuPON1 was active whatever its oligomeric state. In nonmicellar solutions, HuPON1 was polydisperse. In contrast, HuPON1 exhibited apparent homogeneity in micellar solutions, except with CHAPS. The enzyme apparent hydrodynamic radius varied with the type of detergent and protein concentration. In C12E8 micellar solutions, from sedimentation velocity, equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation, and radioactive detergent binding, HuPON1 was described as monomers and dimers in equilibrium. A decrease of the detergent concentration shifted this equilibrium toward the formation of dimers. About 100 detergent molecules were associated per monomer and dimer. The assembly of amphiphilic molecules, phospholipids in vivo, in sufficiently large aggregates could be a prerequisite for anchoring of HuPON1 and then allowing stabilization of the enzyme activity. Changes of HDL size and shape could strongly affect the binding affinity and stability of HuPON1 and result in reduced antioxidative capacity of the lipoprotein.

Besides interacting with HDL-type complexes, HuPON1 has the capability to associate with other amphiphilic complexes such as phospholipid micelles (9Sorenson R.C. Bisgaier C.L. Aviram M. Hsu C.

Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4301-4308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and, although not demonstrated, detergent molecules. For instance, the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 was used to isolate HuPON1 from other HDL-bound proteins and, similarly to HDL in serum, allowed stabilization of the enzyme activity in vitro (11Gan K.N. Smolen A. Eckerson H.W. La Du B.N. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1991; 19: 100-106PubMed Google Scholar).The objectives of this study were to structurally and functionally characterize HuPON1 in detergent solutions and determine whether the detergent type and concentration modulate the activity and interactions of HuPON1. Using detergent molecules as models of amphiphiles, we intended to establish the molecular basis for the interaction selectivity between amphiphilic molecules and HuPON1. Our long term goal is to design HuPON1 mutants with an increased OP hydrolase activity for use as a therapeutic in OP poisoning. A rational design of such mutants ultimately will benefit from the knowledge of the catalytic mechanism for the hydrolysis of OP, based on the HuPON1 three-dimensional structure. Previously, site-directed mutagenesis has been used to identify residues essential for the HuPON1 OP hydrolase activity (12Josse D. Xie W. Renault F. Rochu D. Schopfer L.M. Masson P. Lockridge O. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2816-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, in the absence of a structural model, it is difficult to confirm whether these residues are located in the enzyme active site and what their functional role is. One of our aims was to find a rationale for crystallization properties of HuPON1, a prerequisite for the determination of its three-dimensional structure through x-ray diffraction. Crystallization of HuPON1 first requires the preparation of a pure and homogeneous sample. The purified plasma HuPON1 is a 354-amino acid protein that exhibits 1–3 bands at 37–44 kDa following SDS-PAGE (13Kuo C.L. La Du B.N. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1995; 23: 935-944PubMed Google Scholar). These bands have been shown to correspond to protein glycoforms (13Kuo C.L. La Du B.N. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1995; 23: 935-944PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, homogeneity of HuPON1 pure samples a priori depends on two main factors: the protein glycosylation and oligomeric states. Earlier attempts have been made to determine the homogeneity and apparent molecular mass of the native PON1 isolated from human, rabbit, sheep, and bovine sera (see Ref. 14Geldmacher-von Mallinckrodt M. Diepgen T.L. Toxicol. Environ. Chem. 1988; 18: 79-196Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar for a review). The apparent molecular mass of the native PON1 was found to be variable and ranged within 70–500 kDa. This polydisperse behavior suggests that PON1 exhibits multiple oligomeric states or that the apparent molecular mass is greatly affected by the amount of bound lipids or detergents that were used to dissociate the enzyme from HDL. Since then, the issue of homogeneity and oligomeric states of the native HuPON1 and the influence of detergent in the stoichiometry of the enzyme had not been addressed. In addition, although it was shown that the rabbit PON1 (RaPON1) and HuPON1 monomers retained some activity after SDS-PAGE (15Furlong C.E. Richter R.J. Chapline C. Crabb J.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10133-10140Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), it had not been clearly established whether the HuPON1 native monomer was active.In the present work, nondenaturing polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis (PAGGE), size exclusion chromatography, and sedimentation velocity in the presence of mild nonionic or zwitterionic detergents were used to measure the apparent hydrodynamic radius (Rh) and sedimentation coefficient (s) of HuPON1 and establish whether the HuPON1 dispersity was affected by the detergent type and concentration. The specific arylesterase activity of HuPON1 was determined on fractions eluted from size exclusion chromatography, or semiquantitatively estimated on gel following nondenaturing electrophoresis. Chemical cross-linking and analytical ultracentrifugation equilibrium experiments were performed at different detergent concentrations in order to characterize the HuPON1 oligomeric states and determine the effects of the detergent concentration on the enzyme oligomerization. Gel filtration chromatography was used to determine the amount of radioactive detergent molecules bound to HuPON1 in micellar solutions.The results of this study allowed us to determine the quaternary structure and activity of HuPON1 in solutions as a function of detergent type and concentration and establish how the transitions between HuPON1 oligomers are modulated by the detergent concentration. In addition, a model of interaction between HuPON1 and detergent molecules was designed. Finally, given the structural and functional similarities between the detergent- and HDL-bound HuPON1, the biological significance of these findings was addressed.DISCUSSIONIn this work, we have characterized different oligomeric states of detergent-solubilized HuPON1 purified from plasma. They all exhibited arylesterase activity. We demonstrated that the detergent type and concentration could strongly affect both the HuPON1 dispersity and oligomeric state. In micellar solutions of C12E8, a monomer to dimer equilibrium, regulated by the detergent concentration, with the number of bound detergent molecules nearly 100 per monomer and per dimer was found to be the most reliable model. This number corresponds roughly to one micelle for the detergent in solution. In nonmicellar media, HuPON1 was shown to self-associate in multiple oligomeric forms and aggregates.Detergent-dependent InteractionsSimilarly to membrane proteins, we found that protein-protein and protein-detergent interactions specific to HuPON1 were strongly affected by the detergent concentration relative to the CMC and the detergent type.Nonmicellar SolutionsIn nonmicellar solutions, the sizes of the main oligomeric species observed by nondenaturing PAGGE could correspond to globular dimers, trimers, and tetramers of HuPON1. Accordingly, HuPON1 covalent dimers, trimers, and tetramers were formed upon cross-linking in nonmicellar solutions. Oligomerization in nonmicellar solutions is a usual trait for membrane proteins and has been demonstrated to occur for other HDL-bound proteins: apoA-I (36Swaney J.B. O'Brien K. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7069-7077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cholesteryl ester transfer protein (37Hesler C.B. Swenson T.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2275-2282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (38Jin L. Lee Y-P. Jonas A. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1085-1096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown to come from the tendency of hydrophobic domains of distinct subunits to autoassociate as a result of unmasking by bound lipids or detergents. The existence of exposed hydrophobic regions for HuPON1 cannot be firmly established without knowledge of the enzyme three-dimensional structure. However, when combining the Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy profile (39Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16989) Google Scholar) with predictions for locations of transmembrane regions using TMpred (available on the World Wide Web at www.isrec.isb-sib.ch/ftp-server/tmpred/www/TMPRED_form.html), we found that HuPON1 could have one transmembrane α-helical region corresponding to the first 19 amino acids from its N terminus. Therefore, this putative transmembrane α-helix, which actually corresponds to the retained N-terminal signal peptide of HuPON1, could be involved in the protein autoassociation process in nonmicellar solutions. Whether or not the HuPON1 oligomers formed in these conditions interact with detergent molecules has not been established. This could actually depend on whether the protein-protein interactions in the HuPON1 oligomers lead to total or only partial shielding of the exposed hydrophobic domains.Micellar SolutionsIn micellar solutions, sedimentation velocity and equilibrium indicated that the oligomeric state of C12E8-solubilized HuPON1 could change upon varying the detergent concentration. The most reliable model that fit the sedimentation equilibrium data was that of a monomer-dimer reversible equilibrium. The tendency of HuPON1 to autoassociate was qualitatively confirmed in the cross-linking experiments demonstrating the existence of large species of 80–120-kDa apparent molecular mass. The number of C12E8 molecules bound to the HuPON1 monomer and dimer was shown to be close to the aggregation number for this detergent (i.e. 100). Additionally, from the relationship between Kd, the dissociation constant corresponding to the monomer-dimer equilibrium, and the detergent concentration, we determined that the dimerization process led to the liberation of ∼100 molecules of C12E8. The results of cross-linking studies indicated that HuPON1 had fewer amino acids accessible and that its paired Cys residues were more specifically distant and oriented in micellar solutions when compared with nonmicellar solutions. These results suggest that the HuPON1 dimers formed in nonmicellar and micellar solutions are structurally distinct. In micellar solutions, detergent molecules associated with HuPON1 dimers could prevent direct protein-protein interactions between protected hydrophobic domains.Bovine cytochrome c oxidase, which is a dimer within most crystals and assumed to be a dimeric complex in the membrane, was characterized in a variety of detergent solutions as a mixture of monomers and dimers and/or aggregates (33Musatov A Ortega-Lopez J. Robinson N.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12996-13004Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This system presented a lot of similarities with the HuPON1 one. In particular, the relative amount of monomers and dimers was found to depend on the type and concentration of the detergent, whereas the monomeric form was functional for all of the activities evaluated. In a recent paper, it was found that the addition of bile salts stabilized the dimer form and caused, in appropriate conditions, complete reassociation of the monomer (40Musatov A. Robinson N.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4371-4376Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It would be interesting to see whether, as it is the case for cytochrome c oxidase, a low amount of cholate stabilizes the dimeric form of HuPON1.Anchoring Versus Shielding of a Large Hydrophobic Area by Detergent MoleculesAt least two different models of detergent binding by HuPON1 can be considered. One could simply result from anchoring of the hydrophobic N-terminal signal peptide of HuPON1 to detergent aggregates. Assuming that the C12E8molecules bound to HuPON1 are organized as micelles, a reasonable model for the association process of HuPON1 in micellar media would thus consist of two HuPON1 monomeric forms, each associated with one detergent micelle leading to the formation of a HuPON1 dimeric form associated with one detergent micelle. In this model, the dimerization process would be associated with the release of one detergent micelle. At the present stage of knowledge, reviewed by le Maire et al. (41le Maire M. Champeil P. Møller J.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1508: 86-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar), detergent micelles may provide a suitable membrane-like environment around small membrane peptides. This anchoring could require a minimal size and specific shape of detergent micelles. Accordingly, the autoassociation of HuPON1 in nonmicellar media or media containing 6-kDa CHAPS micelles could result from an incapacity of HuPON1 to bind free detergent molecules or very small micelles. However, the more general model for detergent binding consists of a monolayer on the hydrophobic surface of the protein. In this model, for large proteins, the number of bound detergent molecules was related to the exposed hydrophobic surface. Can our results on HuPON1 give insight concerning the surface that is exposed upon dimer dissociation when the detergent concentration is increased? We calculated that about 100 molecules of released detergent with a cross-sectional area of 0.5 nm2would correspond to an exposed surface of 50 nm2 (41le Maire M. Champeil P. Møller J.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1508: 86-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Bacteriorhodopsin is formed of seven trans-membrane helices and described to bind nearly the same amount (119 molecules) of C12E8 (29Møller J.V. le Maire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18659-18672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These arguments suggest that the hydrophobic exposed surface is quite large and would correspond to contact surfaces in addition to that of an entirely extended N terminus for the monomer. Thus, this would not be consistent with the structural data predicted from the HuPON1 amino acid sequence.Effect of the Detergent TypeAssuming that HuPON1 binds to detergent molecules organized as micelles, the positive correlation of apparent Rh of the HuPON1-detergent complex with that of the detergent micelle could result from a higher affinity of the HuPON1 dimer, when compared with that of the monomer, for the largest micelles. Alternatively, the size of the interacting species could change with the detergent type, as has already been observed for the monomer of the integral membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin (42Seigneuret M. Neumann J-M. Rigaud J-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10066-10069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In that case, the dimension of detergent-solubilized HuPON1 would be determined by the size of the free micelle.Structural and Functional Similarities between HDL- and Detergent-bound Forms of HuPON1Structural FeaturesIn serum, the apolipoprotein apoA-I is involved in the assembly of phospholipid micelles, thus generating nascent HDL. Whereas large reconstituted apoA-I-HDL of 8.5-nmRh were very efficient to release HuPON1 from transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells (10Deakin S. Leviev I. Gomaraschi M. Calabresi L. Franceschini G. James R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4301-4308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), in human plasma, PON1 has been shown by electron microscopy to be associated with an HDL subspecies of about 4.8 ± 1.6-nm Rh (17Blatter M.C. James R.W. Messmer S. Barja F. Pometta D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 871-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The latter Rh values are of the same order as those of PON1-detergent complexes, 3.8–4.8 nm, as determined using nondenaturing PAGGE and size exclusion chromatography, suggesting that the detergent aggregate can at least partially mimic the hydrophobic environment of the protein bound to HDL although the HuPON1-detergent complexes characterized in this work lack protein components, such as apoA-I, apoJ (43Kelso G.J. Stuart W.D. Richter R.J. Furlong C.E. Jordan-Starck T.C. Harmony J.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 832-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), HuPON3 (44Reddy S.T. Wadleigh D.J.

Marzetta C.A. Johnson F.L. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As hypothesized by Oda et al. (46Oda M.N. Bielicki J.K. Berger T. Forte T.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1710-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), since the HuPON1-HDL lipoparticles characterized in plasma were mainly found associated with apoA-I (9Sorenson R.C. Bisgaier C.L. Aviram M. Hsu C. Billecke S. La Du B.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2214-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 17Blatter M.C. James R.W. Messmer S. Barja F. Pometta D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 871-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) and HDL-like complexes containing apoA-I were found to be necessary for optimal release and stabilization of HuPON1 (10Deakin S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 4301-4308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), the association specificity of HuPON1 with HDL might rely on transient interaction of HuPON1 with apoA-I. However, interaction with apoA-I was not an absolute requirement for binding of HuPON1 to HDL-like complexes in apoA-I-deficient sera (9Sorenson R.C. Bisgaier C.L. Aviram M. Hsu C. Billecke S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 4301-4308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and this work suggest that the size of detergent or phospholipid complexes might be the predominant factor that affects the binding affinity and stabilization of HuPON1 in serum and in vitro. Thus, subpopulations of apoA-I-containing lipoparticles of specific size and shape could provide optimal hydrophobic environment for anchoring HuPON1 and stabilizing the enzyme activity. This interpretation was suggested for cholesteryl ester transfer protein, which also specifically binds to apoA-I-containing HDL (49Bruce C. Davidson W.S. Kussie P. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Ghosh R. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11532-11542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).From the already mentioned predictive program of transmembrane regions, TMpred, the HuPON1 homologue, HuPON3, is predicted to have one transmembrane α-helix at its N-terminal extremities. This suggests that, as predicted for HuPON1, HuPON3 could interact specifically with HDL through anchoring of an N-terminally located hydrophobic α-helix. Accordingly, the HuPON1 homologous HuPON2, which was expressed exclusively intracellularly (50Ng C.J. Wadleigh D.J. Gangopadhyay A. Hama S. Grijalva V.R. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Reddy S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44444-44449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), is not predicted to exhibit an N-terminal transmembrane domain. Apo A-I consists of several amphipathic α-helices that interact with the acyl chains of the lipid bilayers on the HDL side (51Panagotopulos S.E. Horace E.M. Maiorano J.N. Davidson W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42965-42970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The HDL-binding mode of HuPON1 and HuPON3 would thus be distinct from that of apoA-I and other apolipoproteins involved in recruiting phospholipids and generating nascent lipoparticles.Functional FeaturesIn apoA-I-deficient sera (9Sorenson R.C.

The enzyme was active, but it displayed a specific activity toward phenylacetate significantly lower than that in apoA-I-containing media probably as a result of enzyme partial inactivation. Binding of HuPON1 to the larger apoA-I-containing HDL was thus assumed to be required for optimal specific activity and stability of the enzyme (9Sorenson R.C. Bisgaier C.L. Aviram M. Hsu C.

This is consistent with preliminary results indicating that, in vitro, HuPON1 storage stability was much less important in nonmicellar solutions than that in micellar solutions and had very low stability in solutions containing small detergent micelles (i.e. CHAPS) compared with relatively large detergent micelles (i.e. Triton X-100) (current work in progress). As shown using nondenaturing PAGGE, enzyme inactivation in nonmicellar media could result from protein aggregation. This could also be related to"

It is composed of a number of different subunits including three light chain families: Tctex1, LC8, and roadblock. The incorporation of the roadblock light chains into the cytoplasmic dynein complex had not been determined. There are two roadblock genes in mammals, ROBL-1 andROBL-2. We find that both members of the roadblock family bind directly to all of the intermediate chain isoforms of mammalian cytoplasmic dynein. This was determined with three complementary approaches.

Acta. 2000; 1496: 76-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Each domain is comprised of different cytoplasmic dynein subunits. The heavy chains of cytoplasmic dynein comprise the motor domain. This domain consists of both a microtubule-binding site and an ATP hydrolysis site that is required to generate the power necessary to move the complex along the microtubule (16Gee M.A. Heuser J.E. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1997; 390: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The major form of cytoplasmic dynein contains two identical heavy chains per complex, each with a molecular weight of ∼530,000. In contrast, the cargo-binding domain is comprised of multiple isoforms of the intermediate chains, light intermediate chains, and light chains. There are two intermediate chains per complex and these subunits have a molecular weight of ∼74,000. In mammals, there are two intermediate chain genes,IC74-11 andIC74-2. Alternative splicing and phosphorylation produce multiple intermediate chain isoforms (17Pfister K.K. Salata M.W. Dillman J.F. Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. Torre E. Lye R.J. J. Biol.

Cell. 1996; 7: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The intermediate chains bind to the p150Glued subunit of the accessory complex, dynactin (18Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28806-28811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). There are also multiple isoforms of the light intermediate chains with molecular weights of 50,000–60,000, which are the products of two light intermediate chain genes, LIC1 andLIC2 (21Gill S.R. Cleveland D.W. Schroer T.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22Hughes S.M. Vaughan K.T. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 17-24PubMed Google Scholar). Three different mammalian light chain families were recently identified with molecular weights between 10,000 and 14,000: Tctex1, LC8, and roadblock. Unlike the two intermediate chain genes, which are closely related, each of the three light chain families has a distinct primary sequence. The Tctex1 light chain family is composed of two related members, Tctex1 and rp3 (23King S.M. Dillman J.F. Benashski S.E. Lye R.J. Patel-King R.S. Pfister K.K. J. Biol.

Benashski S.E., Do, K.T. Patel-King R.S. Pfister K.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15033-15041Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Tctex1, but not rp3, binds to rhodopsin (25Tai A.W. Chuang J.Z. Bode C. Wolfrum U. Sung C.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 877-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 26Tai A.W. Chuang J.Z. Sung C.H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1499-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In addition to Tctex1 and rp3, there are also several more distantly related members of this family (27DiBella L.M. Benashski S.E. Tedford H.W. Harrison A. Patel-King R.S. King S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14366-14373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The LC8 light chain family is comprised of three different members, LC8a, LC8b, and LC8c (28Wilson M.J. Salata M.W. Susalka S.J. Pfister K.K. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2001; 49: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid screens have found multiple binding partners to LC8 family members including neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (29Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. Science. 1996; 274: 774-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) and the BCL-2 family protein, BIM (30Puthalakath H. Huang D.C. O'Reilly L.A. King S.M. Strasser A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). The roadblock light chain family is comprised of two members, roadblock-1 and roadblock-2 (31Bowman A.B. Patel-King R.S. Benashski S.E. McCaffery J.M. Goldstein L.S. King S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Mutations of the roadblock gene inDrosophila exhibited defects in both axonal transport and mitosis (31Bowman A.B. Patel-King R.S. Benashski S.E. McCaffery J.M. Goldstein L.S. King S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Both Tctex1 and LC8 family members were shown to bind to the intermediate chains of cytoplasmic dynein (32Mok Y.K., Lo, K.W. Zhang M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14067-14074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 33Lo K.W. Naisbitt S. Fan J.S. Sheng M. Zhang M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14059-14066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 34Makokha M. Hare M., Li, M. Hays T. Barbar E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4302-4311Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 35King S.J. Bonilla M. Rodgers M.E. Schroer T.A. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1239-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The binding sites for these two light chains were found to be just C-terminal of the second alternative splice region in the intermediate chain gene, indicating that Tctex1 and LC8 could bind any of the intermediate chain isoforms. In addition, the binding sites for both light chains on the intermediate chain were found to be distinct, implying that both Tctex1 and LC8 could bind to the same intermediate chain. In this study, we sought to complete the analysis of the organization of the cytoplasmic dynein complex by determining how the roadblock light chains were incorporated into the complex. We report here that both mammalian roadblock light chains, roadblock-1 and roadblock-2, bind directly to the intermediate chains of cytoplasmic dynein. The hypothesis that individual roadblock light chains specifically bound to different intermediate chain isoforms was also tested. It was found that both roadblock light chains bind all IC74-1 and IC74-2 intermediate chain isoforms. We have mapped the binding region to an ∼72 amino acid domain of the intermediate chain, of which only a 40-amino acid portion was hypothesized to be capable of binding the roadblock light chain. This domain is located significantly downstream of the previously reported Tctex1- and LC8-binding sites, indicating that a single intermediate chain could bind each of the three light chain families. The human roadblock sequences (31Bowman A.B. Patel-King R.S. Benashski S.E. McCaffery J.M. Goldstein L.S. King S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) were used to design primers specific for roadblock-1 and roadblock-2. Roadblock-1 was amplified out of a human brain cDNA library by PCR using roadblock-1-specific primers and then inserted into pBluescript M13− vector (Stratagene) using theSmaI site. Roadblock-2 was amplified from an EST (ATCC number 1994230) using roadblock-2-specific primers and similarly introduced into the pBluescript M13− vector. Human roadblock-1 was subcloned into the pCR vector (CLONTECH) after EcoRI and XmaI restriction sites were introduced by PCR mutagenesis. Roadblock-1 was then digested out of the pCR vector and ligated into the pGADT7 activation domain vector of the Matchmaker system (CLONTECH). Rat intermediate chain constructs were similarly introduced into either the pGBKT7 or pGBT9 DNA-binding domain vectors (CLONTECH). HF-7C yeast were co-transformed according to the Gietz LiAc Yeast Transformation protocol (36Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. BioTechniques. 2001; 30 (, 822–826, 828): 816-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Best results were obtained when the heat shock step was increased to 2 h at 42 °C. The yeast were resuspended in 100 μl of sterile water and 15 μl were dropped onto both −2 and −3 plates. The −2 plates, lacking both leucine (Leu) and tryptophan (Trp), showed co-transformation. The −3 plates, lacking Leu, Trp, and histidine (His), demonstrate protein-protein interactions. To eliminate false positives arising from “leaky” HIS3 expression, 5 mm of a competitive inhibitor of the HIS3pathway, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, was added to the −3 plates. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 5–8 days. Positive interactions were confirmed with a β-galactosidase assay that screened for the independent expression of the lacZ reporter gene. Mouse roadblock-1 and roadblock-2 were cloned into a “bait” pAS2 DNA-binding domain vector (CLONTECH) and used to screen a mouse brain “prey” library. Sequencing of the individual prey plasmids and using the sequences to screen appropriate databases identified candidate roadblock light chain binding partners. The interaction of roadblock-1 and roadblock-2 and the candidate prey proteins was then verified by rescreening in a pairwise yeast two-hybrid assay. A T7 promoter and Kozak sequence were introduced upstream of human roadblock-1, roadblock-2, and Tctex1 cDNA by PCR. The resulting cDNA was purified and used as the template in the TnT coupled wheat germ extract system (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s directions. The amino acid mixture used was lacking in methionine and 40 μCi of translational grade [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) was added per 50-μl reaction. Best results were obtained when the reaction was incubated for 2 h at 30 °C. The design and purification of full-length IC74-1A, IC74-2C, and the truncations is described elsewhere (18Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 37Vaughan P.S. Leszyk J.D. Vaughan K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26171-26179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These constructs and purified bovine brain cytoplasmic dynein (38Dillman III, J.F. Pfister K.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1671-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) were resolved on 4–16 or 4–20% gradient mini-gels and transferred to a 0.2-μm polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) in a Hoeffer blotting apparatus using 10 mm CAPS buffer, pH 11 (Calbiochem). The blot overlay assay was as previously described (18Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) except in vitro synthesized radiolabeled light chain was used to probe the blot. The blot was then placed in a PhosphoImager cassette (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated at room temperature for approximately 1 week. The phosphorimage was analyzed with ImageQuant software. The location of the IC74-1A fragments was confirmed by screening the blot with the 74.1 intermediate chain antibody using enhanced chemical luminescence (ECL) (Pierce). 22.5 μl of in vitro synthesized radiolabeled light chain was incubated with 60 μg of either full-length IC74-2C, a 1–125-aa fragment of IC74-2C, or no intermediate chain. The mixture was next incubated on a shaker at 4 °C for 2 h. The mixture was then added to Protein A beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) coupled with a pan intermediate chain antibody, 74.1, and incubated for 3 h on a shaker at 4 °C (38Dillman III, J.F. Pfister K.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1671-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The beads were washed twice with wash buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 m Tris, pH 8.1, 5 mm EDTA) and then once with deionized water. The beads were resuspended in 50 μl of ×2 Laemmli sample buffer and 30 μl was resolved on a 4–20% gradient mini-gel (ISC Bioexpress). The gel was then dried for 3 h at 70 °C (Bio-Rad model 583). The dried gel was then placed in a phosphorimage cassette for approximately 1 week. We recently identified roadblock-1 as a component of purified bovine brain cytoplasmic dynein (28Wilson M.J. Salata M.W. Susalka S.J. Pfister K.K. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2001; 49: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, how the roadblock-1 light chain was incorporated into the cytoplasmic dynein complex was unknown. Three pieces of evidence led us to hypothesize that roadblock-1 binds to the intermediate chains of cytoplasmic dynein. First, previous experiments demonstrated that the intermediate chain base of the cytoplasmic dynein complex could be separated biochemically from the heavy chain motor domain (21Gill S.R. Cleveland D.W. Schroer T.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Analysis of the fractionated cytoplasmic dynein subunits revealed that Tctex1 and LC8 light chains copurify with the intermediate chains on a sucrose gradient (24King S.M. Barbarese E. Dillman J.F. Benashski S.E., Do, K.T. Patel-King R.S. Pfister K.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15033-15041Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Similarly, the roadblock-related protein, LC7, is part of the IC-LC complex in the flagellar dynein (39Pfister K.K. Witman G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12072-12080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Mitchell D.R. Rosenbaum J.L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1986; 6: 510-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Third, both the Tctex1 and LC8 light chains have been recently demonstrated to bind directly to intermediate chains (32Mok Y.K., Lo, K.W. Zhang M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14067-14074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 33Lo K.W. Naisbitt S. Fan J.S. Sheng M. Zhang M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14059-14066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 34Makokha M. Hare M., Li, M. Hays T. Barbar E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4302-4311Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 35King S.J. Bonilla M. Rodgers M.E. Schroer T.A. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1239-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To determine whether the roadblock-1 light chain also binds to the intermediate chains of cytoplasmic dynein, a yeast two-hybrid assay was used. A roadblock-1/pGADT7 construct and three intermediate chain yeast two-hybrid constructs (either pGBT9 or pGBKT7) were made. There are two different cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chain genes (18Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The intermediate chain genes were alternatively spliced to produce a number of different isoforms. We screened the binding of roadblock-1 to one IC74-1 product, IC74-1B, and two IC74-2 products, IC74-2B and IC74-2C. The results indicate that roadblock-1 interacts with each of these intermediate chains (Fig. 1). The interactions were confirmed with a β-galactosidase assay (not shown). This experiment confirmed our hypothesis that the roadblock-1 light chain interacts with the intermediate chains. To confirm the in vivo results that roadblock-1 binds to the intermediate chains of cytoplasmic dynein, we utilized an in vitro solid phase blot overlay assay. Purified bovine brain cytoplasmic dynein, which contains all IC74-1 and IC74-2 intermediate chain isoforms, was resolved with SDS-PAGE and blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride. The blot was incubated with 35S-labeled roadblock-1 synthesized in vitro (Fig. 2A). Roadblock-1 specifically interacted with a band of the approximate weight of the intermediate chains of cytoplasmic dynein (Fig.2B). This radiolabeled band was identified as the cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chain by immunochemistry. The other roadblock family member, roadblock-2, had not previously been shown to be a component of cytoplasmic dynein. Using the blot overlay assay, we determined that roadblock-2 also binds specifically to the intermediate chains of cytoplasmic dynein. As a positive control, we used the Tctex1 light chain, which has been shown to directly bind to the intermediate chains (32Mok Y.K., Lo, K.W. Zhang M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14067-14074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Some low level nonspecific binding in the 45–60-kDa region of the blot was observed for the three light chains. These blot overlay results confirm that roadblock-1 interacts with the intermediate chain and also demonstrates that the related family member, roadblock-2, interacts with cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chain. To further confirm the interaction between the roadblock light chains and the intermediate chains, we used both roadblock-1 and roadblock-2 to screen a mouse brain yeast two-hybrid library (Fig. 3). This approach also allowed us to determine whether roadblock-1 and roadblock-2 interacted with any other subunits of cytoplasmic dynein. This library has previously been shown to contain the Tctex1 and LC8 light chains (27DiBella L.M. Benashski S.E. Tedford H.W. Harrison A. Patel-King R.S. King S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14366-14373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Interactions between both roadblock light chains and intermediate chains IC74-2A, IC74-2B, and IC74-1 fragment were identified in the screen. The IC74-1 fragment was missing the first N-terminal 187 amino acids, a segment that includes the regions that were alternatively spliced to produce either IC74-1A or IC74-1B. This indicates that both roadblock light chains were capable of binding either IC74-1A or IC74-1B. A second construct was also identified that was only missing the first 43 amino acids and was determined to be IC74-1A (not shown). This indicated that the region of roadblock binding was found between amino acids 187 and 643 (the end) of the IC74-1 intermediate chain. In this screen, no colonies encoding cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain, light intermediate chains, or members of the Tctex1 and LC8 family were identified. However, roadblock light chain was identified as a binding partner, demonstrating that these light chains self-associate. 2K. Nikulina and S. M. King, manuscript in preparation. The fact that both roadblock light chains bound a C-terminal IC-1 fragment in the yeast two-hybrid assay suggested that the binding domain for roadblock-1 and roadblock-2 was downstream of both the Tctex1- and LC8-binding sites. To further define the interaction of the roadblock light chains with the intermediate chain, an in vitro solution-binding assay was used. For these experiments, we used the ubiquitously expressed IC74-2C intermediate chain (41Susalka S.J. Pfister K.K. J. Neurocytol. 2000; 29: 819-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The IC74-2C isoform has the two alternative splicing regions removed. IC74-2C is found in all mammalian cell types, and in many cultured cells it is the only intermediate chain detected. Bacterially expressed IC74-2C intermediate chain and a 1–125-aa fragment of IC74-2C were purified from bacterial lysates (18Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Note that the 1–125-aa fragment of IC74-2C is equivalent to a 1–159-aa fragment of IC74-1A, which contains both splicing regions.35S-Labeled light chains, roadblock-1, roadblock-2, and Tctex1, were synthesized in vitro and separately incubated with the intermediate chain or intermediate chain fragment. The pan intermediate chain antibody, 74.1, was used to immunoprecipitate the intermediate chain and any bound light chain. The epitope for the 74.1 antibody is located in the first 60 amino acids of the intermediate chain (not shown). The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the dried gel was analyzed by autoradiography. Note that antibody binding does not block the binding of either the roadblock light chains or Tctex1 to the intermediate chain. Both roadblock-1 and roadblock-2 co-immunoprecipitated only with the full-length intermediate chain. This demonstrates that they directly bind to IC74-2C and it confirms the yeast two-hybrid assay results (Fig.4). Because neither roadblock-1 nor roadblock-2 bound to the 1–125-aa fragment of IC74-2C, the roadblock-binding domain was located between amino acid 125 of IC74-2C and the C terminus (amino acid 612) of the intermediate chain. In contrast, Tctex1 co-immunoprecipitated with full-length IC74-2C and the 1–125 fragment of IC74-2C. This is consistent with published results that indicate that the Tctex1-binding site on IC74-2C is found between amino acids 106 and 123 (32Mok Y.K., Lo, K.W. Zhang M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14067-14074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It had previously been reported thatin vitro synthesized Tctex1 was immunoprecipitated with endogenous intermediate chain present in an in vitrotranslation mixture (26Tai A.W. Chuang J.Z. Sung C.H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1499-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, when the wheat germ extract was used for the in vitro synthesis reaction we found no immunoprecipitation of either Tctex1 or the two roadblock light chains without the addition of exogenous intermediate chain (Fig. 4). This is consistent with findings that the cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chain, and other dynein subunits, cannot be identified in plant databases (42Lawrence C.J. Morris N.R. Meagher R.B. Dawe R.K. Traffic. 2001; 2: 362-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The results from this experiment indicate that both roadblock light chains bind IC74-2C in vitro and that the roadblock-binding site is C-terminal to the Tctex1 site. To further define the roadblock-binding domain on the cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chain, we utilized an IC74-1A truncation series in the blot overlay assay. All constructs contained the N-terminal, which is recognized by the 74.1 intermediate chain antibody (18Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The IC74-1A constructs were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride. To confirm the location of the intermediate chain fragments, the blot was probed with the 74.1 intermediate chain antibody (Fig. 5A). Each of the six intermediate chain constructs was identified as well as smaller fragments that are the products of premature translation termination (18Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The blots were then incubated with either 35S-labeled roadblock-1 or Tctex1 and the binding of the light chain to the fragments was determined by autoradiography (Fig. 5). Roadblock-1 strongly bound to full-length IC74-1A, the 1–404-aa fragment, and the 1–314-aa fragment. The intensity of each of these three bands appears to be equivalent. Roadblock-1 did not bind to the 1–242-, 1–228-, 1–150-, or the 1–123-aa fragments. This indicates that the roadblock-binding domain on the intermediate chain is between amino acids 243 and 314. In contrast, Tctex1 bound to full-length IC74-1A, 1–404-aa fragment, 1–242-aa fragment, and the 1–228-aa fragment. Tctex1 did not bind to either the 1–150- or 1–123-aa fragment. The results from this blot overlay assay indicate that the Tctex1-binding site is between 123 and 228 aa on the intermediate chain. This is consistent with recent results that indicate that the Tctex1-binding site on IC74-1A is between amino acids 140 and 157 (32Mok Y.K., Lo, K.W. Zhang M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14067-14074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, Tctex1 consistently did not interact with the 1–314-aa IC741A fragment. This could be because of the 1–314-aa fragment not renaturing properly for Tctex1 binding, because Tctex1 bound both the smaller 1–242-aa fragment and the 1–228-aa fragment. The results of this experiment identify a roadblock-binding domain on the intermediate chain that is significantly downstream of both the Tctex1- and LC8-binding sites. Prior to this work, the roadblock light chain family was the only subunit whose location in the cytoplasmic dynein complex was unknown. The data in this report establish that both roadblock-1 and roadblock-2 interact with all five known intermediate chain subunits, IC74-1A, IC74-1B, IC74-2A, IC74-2B, and IC74-2C. Three complementary methods were utilized to demonstrate that the two mammalian roadblock light chains bind the cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chain. Both roadblock-1 and roadblock-2 interact with the intermediate chain isoforms from theIC74-1"

Sit4 affects all known biological functions involving Pkc1, namely Mpk1 activity and cell wall integrity, actin cytoskeleton organization, and ribosomal gene transcription. mitogen-activated protein kinase hemagglutinin fluorescence activated cell sorter ribosomal proteins The Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene SIT4 codes for a Ser/Thr protein phosphatase member of the PPP phosphatase family that is closely related to the PP2A family (1Arndt K.T. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1989; 56: 527-5371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 2Doseff A.I. Arndt K.T. Genetics. 1995; 141: 857-871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sit4 displays a high level of identity to both the fission yeast phosphatase ppe1and the human protein phosphatase 6, which are involved in cell cycle regulation (3Shimanuki M. Kinoshita N. Ohkura H. Yoshida T. Toda T. Yanagida M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 4Bastians H. Ponsting H. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2865-2874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sit4 participates in a number of cellular processes such as the Tor pathway-mediated response to nutrients (5Di Como C.J. Arndt K.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1904-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 6Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar, 7Jiang Y. Broach J.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2782-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and the regulation of monovalent ion homeostasis and intracellular pH (8Masuda C.A. Ramıárez J. Peña A. Montero-Lomelıá M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 40: 30957-30961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Sit4 also plays an important role in cell cycle regulation, as it is required for the proper G1 to S phase transition (9Sutton A. Inmanuel D. Arndt K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2133-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 10Mann D.J. Dombradi V. Cohen P.T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4833-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cells deleted for SIT4 are either nonviable or display slow growth because of an expanded passage through G1 (9Sutton A. Inmanuel D. Arndt K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2133-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar,11Di Como C.J. Bose R. Arndt K.T. Genetics. 1995; 139: 95-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Sutton A. Freiman R.

This delay is partly because of the role of SIT4 in the normal transcription control of the G1 cyclin genesCLN1 and CLN2, and also in the control ofSWI4, coding for a DNA-binding protein required for transcriptional modulation of CLN1/CLN2 (14Fernandez-Sarabia M.J. Sutton A. Zhong T. Arndt K.T. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2417-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 11Di Como C.J. Bose R. Arndt K.T. Genetics. 1995; 139: 95-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, SIT4 is believed to function in a pathway parallel to CLN3 for the activation of CLN1 andCLN2 expression through BCK2 (15Di Como C.J. Chang H. Arndt K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1835-1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Ppz1 and Ppz2 (16Posas F. Casamayor A. Morral N. Ariño J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1993; 13: 5843-5853Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) represent another subset of Ser/Thr protein phosphatases, which play an opposite role to Sit4 in cell cycle regulation (13Clotet J. Garıá E. Aldea M. Ariño J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2408-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The absence of PPZ1 compensates for the delay in cyclin accumulation and also alleviates the budding defect observed in a sit4Δ mutant (13Clotet J. Garıá E. Aldea M. Ariño J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2408-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). PPZ1 has been reportedly involved in the maintenance of cell integrity in cooperation with the PKC1-mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)1 pathway (17Lee K.S. Hines L.K. Levin D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5843-5853Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Overproduction of Ppz1 suppresses the lysis phenotype of null mutants in PKC1 and MPK1 (17Lee K.S. Hines L.K. Levin D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5843-5853Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The PKC1-MAPK pathway is a phosphorylation cascade that responds to signals related to yeast cell integrity, such as: mating pheromone (18Zarzov P. Mazzoni C. Mann C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), low osmolarity (19Davenport K.R. Sohaskey M. Kamada Y. Levin D.E. Gustin M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30157-30161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), and high temperatures (20Kamada Y. Jung U.S. Piotrowski J. Levin D.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Mpk1/Slt2 is the last kinase member of the pathway. Simultaneous deletion of MPK1 and PPZ1is lethal for the cell (17Lee K.S. Hines L.K. Levin D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5843-5853Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Cell wall stress is detected by the plasma membrane sensors Mid2 (21Ketela T. Green R. Bussey H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3330-3340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Wsc1/Hsc77/Slg1, Wsc2, and Wsc3 (22Delley P.A. Hall M.N. J.

A. 1997; 94: 13804-13809Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), and the signal is transmitted downstream via the GTP-binding protein Rho1 that activates the PKC1-MAPK module (21Ketela T. Green R. Bussey H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3330-3340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Delley P.A. Hall M.N. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Pkc1 phosphorylates the MAPK kinase kinase Bck1 (24Lee K.S. Levin D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 172-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), which in turn, transmits the signal to the redundant MAPK kinases: Mkk1 and Mkk2 (25Irie K. Takase M. Lee K.S. Levin D.E. Araki H. Matsumoto K. Oshima Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3076-3083Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). These finally phosphorylate the Slt2/Mpk1 MAPK (26Torres L. Martin H. Garcia-Saez M.I. Arroyo J. Molina M. Sánchez M. Nombela C. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2845-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) on both Tyr192 and Thr190 residues (19Davenport K.R. Sohaskey M. Kamada Y.

Nishida Y. Genetics. 1997; 146: 263-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) causing the activation of the kinase. Phosphorylation and activation of Mpk1 leads to a number of cellular responses. Thus, activation of Mpk1 results in phosphorylation of the transcriptional factor Swi6 through which the pathway is linked to the cell cycle regulatory machinery (29Sidorova J.M. Mikesell G.E. Breeden L.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1641-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 30Madden K. Sheu Y.J. Baetz K. Andrews B. Snyder M. Science. 1997; 275: 1781-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The PKC1 pathway is also involved in budding control (18Zarzov P. Mazzoni C. Mann C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and cell wall synthesis (21Ketela T. Green R. Bussey H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3330-3340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), by regulating (i) the expression (often in a cell cycle-dependent fashion) of several genes coding for proteins related to cell wall synthesis and structure (31Igual J.C. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5001-5013Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 32Zhao C. Jung U.S. Garret-Engele P. Roe T. Cyert M.S. Levin D.E. Mol. Cell.

Morris W. Bru S. Molina M. Klis F.M. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 2121-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), and (ii) the organization of the actin cytoskeleton (35Helliwell S.B. Schmidt A. Ohya Y. Hall M.N. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1211-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic evidence indicates that Ppz1/Ppz2 phosphatases act independently of the PKC1-MAPK pathway (17Lee K.S. Hines L.K. Levin D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5843-5853Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Their role therefore seems to be different from that of other phosphatases, such as Ptp2/Ptp3 (36Mattison C.P. Spencer S.S. Kresge K.A. Lee J. Ota I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7651-7660Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) or Msg5 (37Martıán H. Rodriguez-Pachoán J.M. Ruiz C. Nombela C. Molina M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 14: 1511-1519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (291) Google Scholar), which are known to dephosphorylate and negatively regulate certain components of the pathway. The observation that Ppz1 and Sit4 exhibit a functional antagonism in cell cycle regulation (13Clotet J. Garıá E. Aldea M. Ariño J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2408-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) prompted us to investigate whether this antagonism could also be extended to the functional connection with the PKC1 pathway. Here we demonstrate that Sit4 is required for down-regulation of Pkc1 activity, and is consequently needed for a number of functions that depend on this kinase, such as Mpk1 activity, cytoskeleton organization, ribosomal gene expression, and cell cycle progression. The S. cerevisiae strains used in this work are listed in Table I. Unless otherwise stated, they are derived from either CML125 or CML128 wild type strains (38Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A.

Cells were then resuspended in YPD and incubated for 6 h at 25 °C. After that, cultures were split in two. One-half was kept at the same temperature and the other was shifted to 37 °C for 30 min.

For synchronization experiments, cells were exponentially grown to 107 cells/ml.

For Western analysis, cells were collected on ice, filtered through 0.22-μ Millipore membranes, washed with ice-cold medium, transferred to Eppendorf tubes with 1 ml of ice-cold medium, and then centrifuged for 30 s at 13,000 rpm.

To inhibit Pkc1 activity, 4 × 10−9m staurosporine was added to the kinase reaction (52Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Friedli L. Payton M.A. Paravicini G. J.

We had previously tested Mpk1 basal and heat shock-induced levels of activity in a ppz1Δ mutant and observed that they were severely impaired (data not shown). 2M. A. de la Torre-Ruiz, J. Torres, J. Ariño, and E. Herrero, unpublished observations. To examine whether Mpk1 phosphorylation levels were higher in the absence in Sit4 than in wild type cells (antagonically to that observed in theppz1Δ mutant), we used the anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibodies raised against dually phosphorylated (Thr202/Tyr204)-p44/42 MAPK. These antibodies allow accurate monitoring of Mpk1 activity (23Verna J. Lodder A. Lee K. Vagts A. Ballester R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13804-13809Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 37Martıán H. Rodriguez-Pachoán J.M. Ruiz C. Nombela C. Molina M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 14: 1511-1519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Wild type andsit4Δ cells were grown at 25 °C and then shifted at 37 °C for various time periods (Fig.1A). sit4Δ cells showed increased basal phosphorylation levels as compared with wild type cells (Fig. 1A). Upon heat shock, Mpk1 phosphorylation was much more intense in mutant than wild type cells, and remained higher for longer periods. These changes could not be ascribed to variations in the total amount of Mpk1 protein, as their levels remained constant in all cases, a fact deduced by probing the same protein samples with an anti-GST-Mpk1 antibody (Fig. 1A). Quantification and normalization of phosphorylation levels revealed that after 30 min of heat shock, Mpk1 phosphorylation levels in thesit4Δ mutant were 10 times higher than in wild type cells (Fig. 1B). We performed an in vitro Mpk1 kinase assay in order confirm that the dual Mpk1 phosphorylation detected with the p44/42 antibody correlated to Mpk1 activity. As expected, we were able to detect greater Mpk1 kinase activity levels insit4Δ exponentially growing cells, both at 25 °C or after 30 min of shifting cells at 37 °C compared with the wild type (Fig. 1C). To prove that the increase in Mpk1 activity observed in a sit4Δ strain was not because of an indirect effect caused by the lack of this gene, we performed overexpression analyses by using a multicopy plasmid carrying Sit4 under its own promoter. Sit4 overexpression provoked a dramatic decrease in both the basal and induced phosphorylation state of Mpk1 in wild type cells (Fig. 1D), which demonstrates that Sit4 exercises specific regulatory control over Mpk1 activity. We reasoned that if Mpk1 was hyperphosphorylated in cells lacking Sit4, this could result in biological changes derived from kinase activation. To test this we examined the phosphorylation of Swi6 (a transcription factor whose phosphorylation after heat shock depends on Pkc1-mediated Mpk1 activation (29Sidorova J.M. Mikesell G.E.

Biol. 1998; 18: 4053-4059Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar)). We monitored Swi6 phosphorylation with polyclonal antibodies that detect two forms of the protein in wild type cells: a faster migrating band corresponding to the hypophosphorylated Swi6 state and a slower mobility hyperphosphorylated Swi6 band. In nonstressed wild type cells only the hypophosphorylated form was detected, and shifting the cells to 37 °C resulted in the appearance of hyperphosphorylated Swi6 (Fig. 1A). In contrast, in sit4Δ cell extracts hyperphosphorylated Swi6 was readily observed at 25 °C. Moreover, after heat shock the proportion of this form dramatically increased with respect to wild type cells, and remained higher throughout the experiment (Fig. 1A). Hyperphosphorylation of Swi6 insit4Δ cells after heat shock was fully mediated by Mpk1, as no changes in mobility were observed in a sit4Δ-mpk1Δdouble mutant (data not shown). In conclusion, the above results point to Sit4 being necessary for negative modulation of Mpk1 activity and, consequently also for downstream processes dependent on this activity. It could be hypothesized that the increased activation of Mpk1 found in sit4Δ cells derives from intrinsic cell wall defects in the mutant that would lead to constitutive hyperactivation of the PKC1-MAPK pathway. To test this possibility, we monitored Mpk1 phosphorylation in cells growing in the presence of 1 msorbitol used as an osmotic stabilizer. This condition prevented Mpk1 phosphorylation when the cell wall was severely stressed (34de Nobel H. Ruiz C. Martin H. Morris W. Bru S. Molina M. Klis F.M. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 2121-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Growth in the presence of sorbitol resulted in reduced Mpk1 phosphorylation after the shift to 37 °C (Fig.2A). However, the presence of the stabilizer did not prevent Mpk1 basal phosphorylation in asit4Δ mutant with respect to other wild type cells. Therefore, hyperactivation of Mpk1 in the absence of Sit4 is not a consequence of hypothetical cell wall defects derived from the lack of Sit4. In fact, a sit4Δ mutant showed increased tolerance to treatment with zymolyase (a combination of 1,3-β-glucanase and protease enzymes that degrade the yeast cell wall) with respect to wild type cells (Fig. 2B). In contrast, as previously described (34de Nobel H. Ruiz C. Martin H. Morris W. Bru S. Molina M. Klis F.M. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 2121-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) the mpk1Δ mutant was hypersensitive to enzymatic digestion. Exponentially growing cultures of sit4Δ are enriched in G1 cells, and it has been reported that Mpk1 becomes phosphorylated at the G1/S transition in a cell cycle-dependent manner (18Zarzov P. Mazzoni C. Mann C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Increased Mpk1 dual-phosphorylation in a sit4Δ mutant could therefore result from the presence of a higher proportion of cells in G1 in asynchronous cultures. To discard this possibility, we performed heat-shock experiments with cells synchronized with α-factor in G1, in S with hydroxyurea, and in G2 with nocodazole. In all three cases basal and heat-induced Mpk1 phosphorylation were higher in sit4Δthan in wild type cells (Fig. 2C). As these treatments are somewhat stressful for cells and might affect Mpk1 phosphorylation, G1 small daughter cells were recovered by elutriation, and allowed to progress through the cell cycle, to monitor Mpk1 phosphorylation. At all tested time points, Mpk1 phosphorylation insit4Δ cells was more intense than in wild type cells (Fig.2D). It can therefore be concluded that the absence of Sit4 affects Mpk1 phosphorylation regardless of its position in the cycle. This also demonstrates that the higher activity detected insit4Δ cells is not merely a circumstantial effect caused by the partial synchronization in G1 in this mutant. We constructed pkc1Δ-sit4Δ andbck1Δ-sit4Δ double mutants to investigate whether the induction of Mpk1 activity that occurs in the absence of Sit4 was dependent on Pkc1. However, neither Mpk1 phosphorylation nor Swi6 hyperphosphorylation were observed in pkc1Δ-sit4Δ (Fig.3A, and data not shown) orbck1Δ,sit4Δ (not shown) double mutants at 25 or 37 °C. We conclude that an intact PKC1-MAPK module is required for the Mpk1 activation caused by the absence of Sit4 function. This points against Sit4 defining a Mpk1-inactivating pathway independent from Pkc1. We followed two different approaches to functionally situate Sit4 with respect to Pkc1. First, we used a BCK1–20 allele that constitutively activates Mpk1 (24Lee K.S. Levin D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 172-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). We transformed thePKC1/pkc1ΔSIT4/sit4Δ diploid strain using a plasmid bearing the BCK1–20 allele. After sporulation, thepkc1Δ,sit4Δ, pkc1Δ, and sit4Δstrains (bearing the pBCK1–20 plasmid) were isolated and Mpk1 phosphorylation was subsequently analyzed. It is important to stress that after heat shock Mpk1 still became hyperactivated in the presence of a BCK1–20 allele (not shown). Our reasoning was therefore as follows: if Sit4 acts downstream of Pkc1 as a negative regulator for the pathway, then both sit4Δ/pBCK1–20 andpkc1Δ-sit4Δ/pBCK1-20 cells would exhibit higher levels of Mpk1 activity than wild type and pkc1Δ cells transformed with pBCK1–20, respectively. Alternatively, if Sit4 acts upstream of Pkc1 we would first expect the constitutive phosphorylation level of Mpk1 in sit4Δ/pBCK1–20 cells to be higher than in any of the other strains tested, and second we would expectpkc1Δ-sit4Δ/pBCK1-20 and pkc1Δ/pBCK1–20 c"

These subunits are assembled into two subcomplexes: the core TFIIH, which is composed of six subunits (XPB, XPD, p62, p52, p44, and p34) and the cdk-activating kinase (CAK),1 which is composed of cdk7, cyclin H, and MAT1. Recently, the molecular structures of both human and yeast TFIIHs have been determined by electron microscopy and show similarities in size, shape, and architecture (1Schultz P. Fribourg S.

Mutations in one of these subunits induce UV sensitivity in both human and yeast and are responsible for three rare human genetic disorders, xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), Cockayne syndrome, and trichothiodystrophy (9Berneburg M.

Further studies in yeast have shown that additional subunits of TFIIH, including p62 (Tfb1), p52 (Tfb2), and p44 (Ssl1) also have an essential role in DNA repair (11Prakash S. Prakash L. Mutat. Res. 2000; 451: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In an effort to understand the function of TFIIH in the diverse fundamental cellular processes in which it participates (transcription and DNA repair but also cell cycle regulation through the CAK complex), efforts have been aimed at systematically characterizing all TFIIH subunits. Several functions have been determined for individual components: XPB and XPD are ATP-dependent helicases indispensable for opening the DNA around a promoter and/or a lesion (12Holstege F.C.

Cdk7 is a serine/threonine kinase, which is regulated by cyclin H and MATI and phosphorylates several substrates including the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (see Ref. 17Larochelle S.

Recently, the N-terminal part of p44, a subunit of core TFIIH, has been shown to positively regulate XPD helicase activity, whereas the C-terminal part is involved in promoter escape (18Tremeau-Bravard A. Perez C. Egly J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27693-27697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The XPD helicase regulation is lacking in a majority of XP-D patients because mutations in the C-terminal end of XPD abolish the XPD/p44 interaction (19Coin F. Marinoni J.C. Rodolfo C. Fribourg S. Pedrini A.M. Egly J.M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). This can explain the UV sensitivity and NER defect harbored by yeast deleted for Ssl1, the p44 yeast homolog (20Wang Z. Buratowski S. Svejstrup J.Q. Feaver W.J., Wu, X. Kornberg R.D. Donahue T.F.

The three remaining subunits, p62, p52, and p34, do not contain any known specific motif or enzymatic activities, and their function, as components of TFIIH structure, remains obscure. Concerning p52, in vitro transcription and DNA repair assays, as well as microinjection experiments using p52 antibody, have demonstrated that p52, the last subunit of TFIIH cloned (24Marinoni J.C. Roy R. Vermeulen W. Miniou P. Lutz Y. Weeda G. Seroz T. Gomez D.M. Hoeijmakers J.H. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), is involved in both transcription and NER. Moreover, deletion of the C-terminal region of Tfb2, the yeast counterpart of p52 (64% similar and 40% identical), is detrimental for NER activity of yeast TFIIHin vivo and in vitro (25Feaver W.J. Henry N.L. Wang Z., Wu, X. Svejstrup J.Q. Bushnell D.A. Friedberg E.C. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19319-19327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the present paper we have introduced a similar mutation in the human p52 subunit. We demonstrate that the C-terminal region of p52 is required to anchor XPB (the helicase involved in the opening of the promoter) within the core TFIIH. This study defines p52 as a preferential and indispensable partner of XPB in the TFIIH complex and helps to define the function of the XPB helicase in class II genes transcription and NER. Baculoviruses expressing the TFIIH subunits XPB, His-XPB, XPD, p62, p52, His-p44, p44, p34, cdk7, His-cyclinH, and MAT1 were constructed as previously described (Ref. 13Tirode F. Busso D. Coin F. Egly J.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 87-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar and references therein). To obtain baculoviruses expressing p52(1–135), p52(137–296), p52(1–358), p52(381–462), XPB(44–782), and XPB(208–782), the corresponding cDNAs were amplified by PCR and inserted into a modified pVL1392 baculovirus transfer vector that adds a 6-histidine tag at the N terminus of the open reading frame. To obtain baculoviruses expressing p52, p52(1–304), and p52(305–462) with a FLAG peptide (MTKDDDDKH) fused to its N terminus, the corresponding cDNAs were cloned in the PSK277 vector using a NdeI and BamHI restricted site as described (26Jawhari A. Uhring M. Crucifix C. Fribourg S. Schultz P. Poterszman A. Egly J.M. Moras D. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 24: 513-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The vectors were then recombined with baculovirus DNA (Baculogold, PharMingen), and the resulting viruses were plaque-purified and -amplified according to the manufacturer. Typically, 108 cells were infected with combinations of recombinant baculoviruses expressing combinations of XPB, XPD, p62, p52 or p52(1–358), His-p44, p34, cdk7, His-cyclinH, and MAT1 as indicated and were collected 48 h after infection. Cells were washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 30% glycerol and dounced in 10 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P40, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol). After centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C, clarified lysates were loaded on a heparin-Ultrogel column (Sepracor) pre-equilibrated in buffer A. After extensive washing with buffer A containing 300 mmNaCl, the proteins were eluted with the same buffer containing 500 mm NaCl. The eluted fractions were dialyzed for 2 × 2 h against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol and immunopurified using the 1H5 anti-p44 antibody at different ionic strengths. Alternatively, to purify recombinant TFIIH by FLAG strategy, a virus derived from the pSK277 transfer vector expressing a p34 subunit with a FLAG peptide (MTKDDDDKH) fused at its N terminus was used. This virus was used together with viruses expressing p44, p52, p62, His-XPB, XPD, cdk7, His-cyclinH, and MAT1. 48h hours after infection, 109 cells were collected, washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 30% glycerol and dounced in buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10% glycerol, NaCl 250 mm, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol). DNA and cell membranes were pulled down by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g during 30 min. The supernatants were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 1/40 fraction volume of cobalt chelate affinity resin (Talon, CLONTECH). After a 10-resin volume wash with buffer B containing 5 mm imidazole, TFIIH complexes were eluted with the same buffer containing 250 mmimidazole. The fractions from the Talon column, which contained TFIIH complexes, were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose beads cross-linked with anti-FLAG antibodies (FLAG-M2, Sigma). After three washes with buffer B containing 0.1% Nonidet P40, proteins were eluted in one bead volume of buffer B containing 1 mg/ml epitope peptide for 12 h. Pair-wise protein interactions were characterized by co-infection in Sf9 cells (2.5 × 107) with the corresponding recombinant baculoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 5, collected 48 h after infection, washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 30% glycerol and dounced in 2.5 ml of buffer A. Clarified lysates were obtained by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. 50 μl of clarified lysate was adsorbed on 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads linked with the appropriate monoclonal antibody (1B3, which recognizes the ATP binding site of XPB, and 1D11, which recognizes the N terminus of p52) in buffer C (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA). After 1 h of incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed extensively in buffer C containing 150 mmKCl and resuspended in Laemmli buffer. The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide) and revealed by Western blotting using the appropriate monoclonal antibodies. Circular DNA containing a single 1,3-intrastrand d(GpTpG) cisplatin-DNA cross-link (Pt-GTG) was prepared as described (27Shivji M.K. Moggs J.G. Kuraoka I. Wood R.D. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 113: 373-392PubMed Google Scholar). Repair reactions were carried out in buffer containing 45 mm HEPES at 7.8, 70 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 2.5 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 2 mm ATP. Each reaction contained 50 ng of RPA, 22.5 ng of XPA, 10 ng of XPC-hHR23B, 50 ng of XPG, 20 ng of ERCC1-XPF NER factors, or 1.5 μl of purified TFIIH fractions. Following pre-incubation for 10 min at 30 °C, 50 ng of Pt-GTG was added and reactions were continued for 90 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by rapid freezing. 6 ng of an oligonucleotide complementary to the excised DNA fragment (and containing four extra G residues at the 5′ end) was annealed to the excision products. Sequenase v.2.0 polymerase (0.1 unit) and 1 μCi of (32P)dCTP were used to add four radiolabeled C residues to each excision product. The products were separated by electrophoresis on 14% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. The helicase substrate was obtained by annealing 5 ng of an oligonucleotide encompassing a sequence complementary to nucleotides 6219–6255 of single-stranded M13mp18 DNA to 1 μg of single-stranded M13mp18. The resulting heteroduplex was digested for 1 h at 37 °C withEcoRI (New England Biolabs) and then extended to 21 and 20 bp, respectively, with the Klenow fragment (5 units) in the presence of 50 mm dTTP and 7 μCi of [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences). The helicase assay was then performed as described (24Marinoni J.C. Roy R. Vermeulen W. Miniou P. Lutz Y. Weeda G. Seroz T. Gomez D.M. Hoeijmakers J.H. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis was monitored as previously described. Briefly, protein fractions were incubated for 2 h at 30 °C in the presence of 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (7000 Ci/mmol, ICN Pharmaceuticals) in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.9, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Reactions were stopped by adding EDTA to 50 mm. The reactions were then diluted 5-fold, spotted onto polyethylenimine TLC plates (Merck), run in 0.5 m LiCl/ 1 M formic acid, and autoradiographed. Kinase assays (25Feaver W.J. Henry N.L. Wang Z., Wu, X. Svejstrup J.Q. Bushnell D.A. Friedberg E.C. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol.

Samples were incubated 30 min at 25 °C, and reactions were stopped by the addition of 5 μl of loading buffer. After SDS-PAGE (15%), the gel was fixed and dried on Whatman filter paper. The phosphorylated ctd4 was visualized by autoradiography. AdMLP template (20 ng) was incubated at 25 °C for 30 min with recombinant TBP, TFIIB, TFIIF, TFIIE, highly pure pol II, and TFIIH as indicated in a 20-μl reaction that contained 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm MgCl2. ATP and CTP (200 μm) were added for the last 5 min. Two μl of 160 mmKMnO4 was added for 2 min, after which the reaction was stopped by addition of 2 μl of 14.4 mβ-mercaptoethanol. After phenol-chloroform extraction, DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation, redissolved in water, and subjected to 30 cycles of primer extension using an end-labeled primer. After phenol-chloroform extraction, ethanol precipitation, and wash, the sample was loaded onto a 6% sequencing gel. The gel was dried and autoradiographed (12Holstege F.C. Tantin D. Carey M. van der Vliet P.C. Timmers H.T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 810-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For the proteolysis experiments, 30 μl of recombinant TFIIH purified by the FLAG strategy were incubated with 10 μl of chymotrypsin at various concentrations (0–0.25 mg/ml) and incubated 1 h at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by addition of 5 μl of 100 mm Pefablock (Roche Diagnostics), and the hydrolyzed peptides were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using monoclonal antibodies directed against either the N-terminal (1D11) or the C-terminal (5D6) part of p52. By taking advantage of recombinant technology, we have generated TFIIH complexes in insect cells. One of them (rIIH9/p52 (1–358)) contains a C terminus-truncated p52. Recombinant TFIIHs, (rIIH9wt and rIIH9/p52(1–358)) were produced in High-Five insect cells co-infected with baculoviruses expressing either the wild type or truncated forms of p52 as well as the eight other TFIIH subunits (13Tirode F. Busso D. Coin F. Egly J.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 87-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The insect cell extracts were then loaded on a heparin-Ultrogel column, and the protein was eluted with 0.5 m KCl including rIIH9wt and rIIH9/p52(1–358), respectively, which were applied onto a cobalt chelate affinity resin. After extensive washing of the column under mild salt conditions (50 mm KCl), both rIIH9s were eluted with the same buffer containing 50 mm EDTA. As judged by immunoblotting, the stoichiometry of both rIIH9 complexes are almost identical (Fig. 1A). The mutated TFIIH differs only from the wild type complex by the presence of the truncated p52(1–358) protein (lane 2); p52 co-migrates with histidine-tagged p44 (lane 1). Both recombinant TFIIHs were then tested for their DNA repair and transcription activities. As expected (25Feaver W.J. Henry N.L. Wang Z., Wu, X. Svejstrup J.Q. Bushnell D.A. Friedberg E.C.

In addition, the transcription activity of rIIH9/p52(1–358) was strongly reduced (80%) relative to wild type (Fig. 1C, left panel) in anin vitro transcription assay containing the adenovirus major late MLP template, RNA pol II, and purified basal transcription factors except TFIIH. Because CAK is anchored to the core TFIIH, we wondered if the p52 C-terminal deletion would have affected the stimulatory effect of CAK. Previous work has shown that for certain promoters such as MLP, dependence on the CAK subunits is not a function of the kinase activity of cdk7 but is rather due to the contribution of CAK to an optimal positioning of TFIIH within the transcription preinitiation complex (29Lu H. Zawel L. Fisher L. Egly J.M. Reinberg D. Nature. 1992; 358: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 30Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 51: 113-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Recombinant rIIH6/p52(1–358) and rIIH6wt were produced in Sf9 cells and purified as described above. Wild type CAK was then added to the reconstituted transcription assay containing either the rIIH6 or the rIIH6/p52(1–358) subcomplex (Fig. 1C, right panel). In both cases CAK stimulates rIIH6/p52(1–358) and rIIH6wt transcription activity by about 4–5-fold (Fig.1C, right panel, compare lanes 2 and 4 with lanes 6 and 8). These results clearly indicate that the transcriptional defect associated with rIIH6/p52(1–358) is independent of CAK transcription stimulation and is instead intrinsic to the core structure of TFIIH. We then wondered whether p52 mutations would affect the enzymatic activities of TFIIH that participate in transcription and DNA repair events. We then investigated the phosphorylation by the cdk7 subunit of TFIIH of peptide substrate (ctd4) that contains four copies of the hepta repeat found in the C-terminal domain of the largest RNA pol II subunit. Both TFIIHs phosphorylated ctd4 (Fig.2A), showing that the cdk7 activity of CAK is not affected by the p52 mutation. In another set of experiments, we measured the overall ATPase activity of both rIIH9wt and rIIH9/p52(1–358). Neither the XPB nor the XPD ATPase activities were affected by the p52 mutation (Fig. 2B). Then, we asked whether mutation of p52 would impair the XPD or XPB unwinding activities. We found that the ATP-dependent XPD helicase activity of rIIH9/p52(1–358) is similar to rIIH9 wild type (Fig.2C). As the XPB helicase activity cannot be measured using a standard strand displacement assay (31Coin F. Bergmann E. Tremeau-Bravard A. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1357-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C) and XPB has been shown to be the helicase involved in promoter opening, we investigated whether rIIH9 retains its ability to direct promoter opening using a KMnO4 footprinting assay (27Shivji M.K. Moggs J.G. Kuraoka I. Wood R.D. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 113: 373-392PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of saturating amounts of basal transcription factors including HeLa TFIIH and RNA pol II, addition of both ATP and CTP (allowing the formation of the first phosphodiester bond) leads to an enhancement of the sensitivity of the thymidines around the AdMLP promoter (Fig.2D, lanes 1 and 2, positions +3, +5, +7, and +8), indicating promoter opening around the transcription initiation site. When rIIH9/p52(1–358) is added instead of rIIH9wt, promoter opening is significantly decreased (Fig. 2D, lanes 2 and 3). This inhibition strongly correlates with the decrease in run-off transcription, indicating that this impairment of transcription can be directly linked to an impairment of promoter opening. Since promoter opening is impaired and XPB has been shown to be the helicase involved in the transcription initiation step (31Coin F. Bergmann E. Tremeau-Bravard A. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1357-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), we then asked whether p52 mutation affects association of XPB with the TFIIH multiprotein complex. Antibodies raised against p44 were used to immunoprecipitate TFIIHs produced in insect cells co-infected with baculoviruses overexpressing wild type p52 or p52(1–358) together with either all of the eight TFIIH subunits or only with XPB, p62, p44, and p34. When performed at higher salt concentration (250 mmKCl), XPB did not co-precipitate with other TFIIH subunits when p52(1–358) is present (Fig.3A, lanes 4–6). Indeed, although treatment with 250 mm KCl does not dissociate TFIIH subcomplexes (compare lanes 1–3), we notice that p52(1–358) prevents anchoring of XPB in the core TFIIH (Fig. 3B, lane 2). In another set of experiments, we demonstrate that p52 is required for the presence of XPB in the core TFIIH. Indeed XPB could be co-immunoprecipitated from infected insect cells with p44, p62, and p34 only in the presence of p52 (Fig. 3C, compare lanes 2 and 4). Together these results show that the C-terminal domain of p52 determines the strength of the binding of XPB within TFIIH whether or not CAK/XPD is present. The above data suggest a role for p52 in promoter opening and for the integration of XPB into TFIIH. We therefore wondered if some connection between these two subunits could be identified. Sf9 insect cells were co-infected with two baculoviruses expressing p52 and one of the five subunits of the core TFIIH (XPB, XPD, p62, p44, and p34). Recombinant proteins of the core TFIIH contained in cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with the corresponding antibody. After extensive washing at 250 mm KCl, the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting. Under these conditions, only XPB (Fig.4B, compare lanes 1and 2) and to a lesser extent p62 (data not shown) were able to significantly interact with p52. These results argue that XPB binds preferential to p52 within TFIIH. To map the region of p52 that is involved in the interaction with XPB, we generated a set of baculoviruses expressing truncated forms of p52 corresponding to residues 1–135, 137–296, 1–358, 1–304, 305–462, and 381–462 based on sequence alignments (see supplemental material at http://www.jbc.org). We then coexpressed each of the truncated p52s with wild type XPB (Fig. 4A). As a control, we confirmed that all proteins were successfully expressed (Fig. 4A). Ab-XPB is able to co-immunoprecipitate with XPB, p52(1–135), p52(1–304), and p52(1–358) as well as p52(305–462) but not p52(137–296) and p52(381–462) (Fig. 4B, lanes 3–14). The above results show that p52 contains two distinct XPB binding regions that correspond to residues 1–135 and 304–381 (Fig.4D) and raise questions concerning the role, if any, of the extreme C-terminal end of p52 in XPB interaction. To address this point, recombinant TFIIH containing the nine subunits produced in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells was subjected to limited proteolysis. At low protease concentration, a substrate protein would be expected to be cleaved preferentially at sites that are exposed to the solvent. It is generally accepted that protease-resistant polypeptides are involved in the formation of structural entities. Recombinant TFIIH was incubated with increasing amounts of chymotrypsin and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Using an antibody directed against the N terminus of p52, we noticed that p52 was proteolysed to result in a fragment of 43 kDa that corresponds approximately to 390–400 amino acids (Fig. 4C, left panel). Under these conditions, the C-terminal part of p52 is presumably degraded to very small fragments as the antibody directed against the C terminus of p52 does not detect any low molecular weight peptides (right panel). This experiment shows that the extreme C terminus of the protein is accessible to the protease and is in agreement with the observation that p52(381–462) does not interact with XPB. To map in more detail the region of XPB involved in the interaction with p52, we generated several truncated XPB polypeptides including XPB(44–782) and XPB(208–782) and analyzed them as described above. Ab-p52 co-immunoprecipitates only XPBwt and XPB(44–782) but not XPB(208–782) (Fig. 5A). Ab-XPB does not precipitate p52 when coexpressed with XPB(208–782). It is also worth mentioning that when overexpressed together with p34, p44, p52, and p62 subunits, XPB(208–782) is unable to assemble into core TFIIH (Fig. 5B). Taken together, the above data demonstrate that the 1–381 portion of p52 interacts with XPB residues 44–208, which include the DNA binding motif (Fig. 5C). Gene expression is regulated by the various transcription factors that are involved in RNA synthesis. Some of these transcription factors possess enzymatic activities that orchestrate the various events of the transcription reaction, such as chromatin remodeling, promoter opening, and RNA pol II phospho-/dephosphorylation. It has been known for some years that the enzymatic activities of the cdk7 and XPD subunits of TFIIH are regulated. The activity of cdk7 kinase depends on the presence of cyclinH and MAT1, two other TFIIH subunits, as well as on the phosphorylation state of its T-loop (17Larochelle S. Chen J. Knights R. Pandur J. Morcillo P. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Suter B. Fisher R.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3749-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Similarly, upon interaction with p44, XPD helicase activity increases (19Coin F. Marinoni J.C. Rodolfo C. Fribourg S. Pedrini A.M. Egly J.M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Mutations in the C-terminal domain of XPD modify the contact with p44, explaining the NER defect associated with most of the XP-D patients (32Taylor E.M. Broughton B.C. Botta E. Stefanini M. Sarasin A. Jaspers N.G. Fawcett H. Harcourt S.A. Arlett C.F. Lehmann A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8658-8663Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In addition, mutations in XPD or in p44 that modify the XPD-p44 interaction affect the composition of TFIIH by decreasing the amount of XPD and CAK subunits associated with the core and/or weakening the anchoring of CAK to the core TFIIH (23Seroz T.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1357-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) with a consequent change in the rate of some hormone-responsive genes (33Keriel A. Stary A. Sarasin A. Rochette-Egly C. Egly J.M. Cell. 2002; 109: 123-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that the p52 subunit is the privileged partner of the XPB helicase. Each of the enzymatic activities found in TFIIH now possess its own regulatory partner within the protein complex. Using a recombinant TFIIH, with which the C-terminal domain of p52 was deleted, we have demonstrated that the p52 mutation is detrimental for both TFIIH-DNA repair and transcription activities. Indeed, several experiments, including permanganate footprinting, allow us to assign this transcriptional defect to an impairment in the opening of the DNA around the promoter. Having previously demonstrated that the XPB helicase was crucial in the promoter opening (12Holstege F.C. Tantin D. Carey M. van der Vliet P.C. Timmers H.T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 810-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 31Coin F. Bergmann E. Tremeau-Bravard A. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1357-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), we further investigated the role of p52 in anchoring of XPB to core TFIIH. We first show that the integrity of p52 is a prerequisite for the presence of XPB in core TFIIH. Indeed, the ternary p34/p44/p62 complex does not interact with XPB in the absence of p52. In fact XPB anchoring is mediated by p52 and, as also observed in yeast (34Feaver W.J. Huang W. Gileadi O. Myers L. Gustafsson C.M. Kornberg R.D. Friedberg E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5941-5946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the two proteins interact directly. XPB binding involves two independent regions of p52: the first is located within residues 1–135 and contains a few residues strictly conserved among p52 orthologs. The second binding region includes residues 303–381, as p52(303–462) interacts with XPB, whereas p52(381–462) does not. This second binding region is highly conserved from human to yeast (Fig. 4 and supplemental material at http://www.jbc.org). The fact that p52(381–462) does not interact with XPB correlates with the observation that the C terminus of p52 is rapidly digested in a mild proteolysis assay (Fig. 4D). It seems, however, that this domain is crucial for the architecture and/or the stability of TFIIH, as a deletion of residues 358–462 weakens the binding of XPB within the core TFIIH. This instability can explain the NER defect and transcriptional impairment as well as the phenotype observed in yeast cells containing a similar deletion. We propose that the C-terminal domain of p52 might possess a three-dimensional structure that locks up XPB inside TFIIH. The consequence of the p52 deletion would be a weaker and/or inappropriate positioning of the XPB helicase first within TFIIH itself and second within the transcription and/or DNA repair machinery. This defective association of XPB with TFIIH would result in a defect in one of the essential function of TFIIH, i.e. DNA opening. Unlike the XPB and XPD genes, no human genetic disorders have been associated with the gene encoding p52. However, a change in the last 40 amino acids of XPB from XP-B/CS patients results in a similar defect in promoter opening and consequently RNA synthesis (31Coin F. Bergmann E. Tremeau-Bravard A. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1357-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Moreover, using photo-cross-linking experiments, we showed that the positioning of the mutated XPB helicase of TFIIH onto promoter DNA was impaired (35Douziech M. Coin F Chipoulet J.M. Arai Y. Ohkuma Y. Egly J.M. Coulombe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8168-8177Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis as well as deletion experiments suggest that XPB is composed of three modules: a N-terminal domain (also referred to as DNA binding domain), the catalytic core domain, which contains the helicase motifs, and the C-terminal domain (36Poterszman A. Lamour V. Egly J.M. Moras D. Thierry J.C. Poch O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 418-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We have shown that the region of XPB that contacts p52 corresponds to the N-terminal putative DNA binding domain of this helicase (37Weeda G. Wiegant J. van der P.M. Geurts van Kessel A.H. van der Eb A.J. Hoeijmakers J.H. Genomics. 1991; 10: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 38Ma L. Siemssen E.D. Noteborn H.M. van der Eb A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4095-4102Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is likely that the C-terminal moiety of p52 allows trapping and stabilization of XPB within TFIIH. Whether deletion of the C-terminal region of p52 affects the accuracy of positioning and/or the association of TFIIH within the transcription preinitiation and NER complexes remains to be further investigated.

The RAP80 cDNA was cloned from a human testis cDNA library and encodes a 719-amino acid protein containing two potential CX2CX11HX3C-type zinc finger motifs at its carboxyl-terminal region. Analysis of its genomic structure revealed that the RAP80 gene covers more than 90 kb and consists of 15 exons and 14 introns. Fluorescencein situ hybridization mapped the RAP80 gene to human chromosome 5q35. RAP80 mRNA is expressed in many human tissues, but its expression is particularly high in testis. In situ hybridization showed that RAP80 is highly expressed in germ cells of mouse testis but is not differentially regulated during spermatogenesis. Confocal microscopy showed that RAP80 is localized to the nucleus, where it is distributed in a speckled pattern. Deletion analysis showed that a bipartite nuclear localization signal at the amino terminus is important in mediating nuclear transport of RAP80. Monohybrid analysis showed that RAP80 might function as an active repressor of transcription. Mammalian two-hybrid analysis demonstrated that RAP80 was able to interact with the retinoid-related testis-associated receptor (RTR), an orphan receptor that has been implicated in the control of embryonic development and spermatogenesis. Pull-down analysis showed that RAP80 and RTR physically interactin vitro. Deletion and point mutation analyses revealed that part of the hinge domain of RTR is required for this interaction. RAP80 is able to inhibit the interaction of RTR with the co-repressor N-CoR likely by competing with N-CoR for RTR binding. Our results suggest that RAP80 may be functioning as a modulator of RTR signaling. In this study, we describe the characterization of a novel nuclear protein, referred to as RAP80.

Nuclear receptors share a common domain structure that includes an amino-terminal domain, a DNA-binding domain (DBD),1 hinge domain, and a ligand-binding domain (LBD). These domains are involved in the recognition of specific DNA response elements, receptor dimerization, nuclear localization, and ligand binding and contain repressor and transactivation functions. Repression and activation of transcription by nuclear receptors are mediated through interactions with co-repressor and co-activators, respectively. Nuclear receptors have been demonstrated to regulate many physiological processes, including embryonic development and cell growth and differentiation and have been implicated in a number of human diseases (5de The H.

In the testis, RTR is most abundant in round spermatids suggesting that RTR controls gene transcription during a specific stage of spermatogenesis (9Chen F. Cooney A.J. Wang Y. Law S.W. O'Malley B.W.

Targeted disruption of the RTR gene is embryonic lethal in mice (20Chung A.C. Katz D. Pereira F.A. Jackson K.J. DeMayo F.J. Cooney A.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell.

Embryos exhibit open neural tubes and an absence of posterior structures and do not survive beyond 10.5 days post-coitus probably due to cardiovascular failure. These studies suggest that RTR is essential for the postgastrulation and neurulation stages of mouse development. A recent study identified a role for RTR in the repression of the POU-domain transcription factor Oct4 (21Fuhrmann G. Chung A.C. Jackson K.J. Hummelke G. Baniahmad A. Sutter J. Sylvester I.

However, little is still known about the transcriptional activity of RTR. In the absence of a putative ligand, RTR has been shown to function as a transcriptional repressor (27Hummelke G.C. Cooney A.J. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: D1186-D1191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Yan Z. Jetten A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35077-35085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This repression is mediated at least in part through an interaction of RTR with the co-repressor N-CoR.In this report, we describe the cloning and sequence of the full-length coding region of a novel gene referred to as receptor-associated protein 80 (RAP80). RAP80 encodes a 79.6-kDa nuclear protein. The RAP80 protein contains two Cys-X2-Cys-X11-His-X3-Cys zinc fingers near the carboxyl terminus. RAP80 mRNA is expressed in many tissues but is most abundant in testis. In situhybridization localized RAP80 mRNA expression to the germ cells. The genomic structure of the RAP80 gene encompasses more than 90 kb and consists of 15 exons. The RAP80 gene was mapped to human chromosome 5q35. Confocal microscopy showed that RAP80 is localized largely to the nucleus. Using mammalian mono- and two-hybrid analysis, we characterized the transcriptional activity of RAP80 and its interaction with RTR. The results indicated that RAP80 is able to repress basal transcriptional activation indicating that it may function as a (co)-repressor for RTR. Deletion and point mutation analysis demonstrated that the hinge domain of RTR is important for this interaction. Previously, we reported that the hinge domain, in addition to helices 3–5 and 12, is also required for the interaction of RTR with the co-repressor N-CoR (28Yan Z. Jetten A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35077-35085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that RAP80 is able to inhibit the interaction of the co-repressor N-CoR with RTR likely by competing with N-CoR for binding. These results suggest that RAP80 may play a role in modulating the transcriptional and biological activity of RTR.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we describe the cloning of a cDNA encoding the full-length human RAP80 protein. Examination of the RAP80 protein sequence revealed several distinctive features, two putative zinc finger motifs, three nuclear localization signals, a Glu-rich region, a PEST sequence, and a potential ubiquitin-interaction motif between Thr80 and Glu98 (37Hofmann K. Falquet L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 347-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The two putative zinc finger motifs at the carboxyl terminus of RAP80 exhibit the consensus sequence Cys-X2-Cys-X11-His-X3-Cys. The sequence separating the zinc finger motifs does not exhibit any homology with the consensus motif (T/S)GEKP (Y/F)X, typically found as interfinger spacer in members of the Krüppel-like zinc finger proteins (38Schuh R.

Cell. 1986; 47: 1025-1032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) suggesting that RAP80 does not belong to the Krüppel-like zinc finger protein superfamily. The class CCHC-type zinc finger motifs found in RAP80 has been described in only a limited number of proteins. Members of the NZF and FOG transcription factor families contain zinc finger motifs with the consensus Cys-X2-Cys-X4-His-X1–5-Cys (39Berkovits H.J. Berg J.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16826-16830Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 40Jiang Y., Yu, V.C. Buchholz F. O'Connell S. Rhodes S.J. Candeloro C. Xia Y.R. Lusis A.J. Rosenfeld M.G. J. Biol.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 1030-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A different class of Cys-X2-Cys-X4-His-X4-Cys motifs, referred to as “zinc knuckle” fingers, are contained in DNA-binding proteins from several retroviruses (42Ramboarina S. Morellet N. Fournie-Zaluski M.C. Roques B.P. Moreller N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9600-9607Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). RAP80 appears to be unique and unrelated to these nuclear proteins. Zinc finger motifs can exhibit multiple functions, including a role in DNA recognition, protein-protein interactions, and nuclear localization. We are in the process of examining whether RAP80 can recognize a specific DNA sequence and whether it functions as a DNA-binding protein.Confocal microscopic analysis localized RAP80 to the nucleus, suggesting that RAP80 functions as a nuclear protein. RAP80 is distributed in a speckled pattern, suggesting that it is part of a multiprotein complex. RAP80 contains three putative nuclear localization signals: at Arg3, Arg715, and a bipartite nuclear localization signal between Lys19 and Arg35 (36Boulikas T. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 32-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Deletion analysis indicated that the bipartite nuclear localization signal is important in mediating nuclear transport of RAP80.The nuclear localization and the presence of two zinc finger-like motifs suggested that RAP80 may function as a transcription factor. We therefore investigated whether it exhibited any transcriptional activity. Monohybrid analysis using different cell types showed that in several cell lines RAP80 was unable to enhance transcription of a reporter gene, suggesting that it did not function as a transcriptional activator under these conditions. Instead, Gal4(DBD)-RAP80 inhibited basal transcription, indicating that it may function as an active repressor. Deletion mutant analysis indicated that the repressor function is associated with the amino terminus of RAP80. This region has no similarity to any other known repressor domain.RAP80 exhibits a 74% identity with a partial protein sequence referred to as RIP110 encoded by one of several sequences identified by yeast two-hybrid screening using the ligand binding domain of the RXRα receptor as bait (33Seol W. Choi H.S. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 72-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RIP110 appears to represent the carboxyl terminus of the mouse homologue of RAP80 and has not been studied further. Because of the observed interaction of RIP110 with RXR in yeast two-hybrid analysis, we investigated the interaction of RAP80 with a number of nuclear receptors in mammalian two-hybrid analysis. This analysis included the retinoid receptors RXRα and RARα, the estrogen receptor α, the thyroid hormone receptor α, and the orphan receptors RTR and TAK1 and was carried out in either the presence or absence of their respective ligand (not shown). These analyses revealed an interaction only between RAP80 and RTR (Fig. 7). Deletion and point mutation analysis identified a region within the hinge domain of RTR that is essential for its interaction with RAP80 while the ligand binding domain of RTR was not required. Several regions within RAP80 were important for optimal interaction with RTR. These observations suggest a function for RAP80 in modulating RTR activity. RAP80 may have multiple roles in RTR signaling. It may function as a co-repressor, as a mediator to recruit other proteins to RTR or target RTR to a particular complex or compartment such as nuclear matrix or proteasome. The fact that RAP80 inhibits basal transcriptional activity may suggest that it functions as a co-repressor.Previous studies have demonstrated that RTR can function as an active repressor of transcription and is involved in the repression of transcription of the POU-domain transcriptional factor Oct4 (21Fuhrmann G. Chung A.C. Jackson K.J. Hummelke G. Baniahmad A. Sutter J. Sylvester I. Scholer H.R. Cooney A.J. Dev.

Chem. 2000; 275: 35077-35085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Repression by nuclear receptors is mediated through interaction with multiprotein co-repressor complexes that contain histone deacetylase activity and affect chromatin structure. The protein N-CoR has been reported to physically interact with RTR and to function as a co-repressor for RTR. This interaction was shown to require the ligand binding domain as well as the hinge domain of RTR for optimal binding (28Yan Z. Jetten A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35077-35085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Because both RAP80 and N-CoR interact with RTR and require the hinge region of RTR for binding, one might predict that the interaction of RAP80 and N-CoR to RTR interfere with each other. As shown in Fig. 11, RAP80 inhibits the interaction of N-CoR with RTR likely by competing with each other for RTR binding. The hinge region is required for the interaction of N-CoR with several nuclear receptors and appears to function as a structural determinant rather than serving as a direct interface in N-CoR binding (43Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Nagy L. Kao H.Y. Love J.D., Li, C. Banayo E. Gooch J.T. Krishna V. Chatterjee K. Evans R.M. Schwabe J.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3209-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). These observations seem to indicate that RAP80 interferes with the binding of N-CoR to RTR through a mechanism of steric hindrance rather than competing for the same binding interface.RAP80 mRNA was found in many different human tissues but was most abundantly expressed in testis. In situ hybridization of sections from mouse testis indicated that RAP80 is expressed most highly in germ cells. Because no significant differences in the level or pattern of hybridization were observed between seminiferous tubules at different stages of spermatogenesis, expression of RAP80 mRNA appears not to be differentially regulated during spermatogenesis. This was supported by Northern blot analysis using RNA from different germ cell populations (not shown). Previous studies have demonstrated that RTR is differentially regulated during spermatogenesis and most highly expressed in spermatids (9Chen F. Cooney A.J. Wang Y. Law S.W. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1434-1444PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hirose T. O'Brien D.A. Jetten A.M. Gene. 1995; 152: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 18Zhang Y.L. Akmal K.M. Tsuruta J.K. Shang Q. Hirose T. Jetten A.M. Kim K.H. O'Brien D.A. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1998; 50: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because RTR and RAP80 are co-expressed in spermatids and in embryonal carcinoma cells and trophoblasts (not shown) (19Mehta D.V. Kim Y.-S. Dixon D. Jetten A.M. Placenta. 2002; 23: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), RAP80 may change RTR function and signaling in these cells. What the physiological significance is of the interaction between RAP80 and RTR awaits further analysis using functional assays. Because RAP80 mRNA is also found in tissues where RTR is not expressed suggests that RAP80 has additional functions and likely interacts with other (nuclear) proteins.In summary, in this study we identify a novel nuclear protein, referred to as RAP80. This protein localizes to the nucleus and is able to repress basal transcription. We demonstrate that this protein interacts physically with the nuclear orphan receptor RTR. Deletion and point mutation analysis identified a region within the hinge domain of RTR that is essential for this interaction. This region is also required for the interaction of the co-repressor N-CoR. RAP80 and N-CoR appear to compete with each other for binding to RTR possibly through steric hindrance. Our results suggest that RAP80 may play a role in modulating the transcriptional and biological activity of RTR possibly by functioning as a co-repressor. The nuclear receptor superfamily is composed of a large number of ligand-dependent transcription factors that include nuclear orphan receptors for which a ligand has not yet been identified (1Kumar R. Thompson E.B. Steroids. 1999; 64: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 2Laudet V. J. Mol.

Nuclear receptors share a common domain structure that includes an amino-terminal domain, a DNA-binding domain (DBD),1 hinge domain, and a ligand-binding domain (LBD). These domains are involved in the recognition of specific DNA response elements, receptor dimerization, nuclear localization, and ligand binding and contain repressor and transactivation functions. Repression and activation of transcription by nuclear receptors are mediated through interactions with co-repressor and co-activators, respectively. Nuclear receptors have been demonstrated to regulate many physiological processes, including embryonic development and cell growth and differentiation and have been implicated in a number of human diseases (5de The H. Lavau C. Marchio A. Chomienne C. Degos L. Dejean A. Cell. 1991; 66: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar, 6Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr.

Less, however, is known about the role of many nuclear orphan receptors, including the retinoid-related, testis-associated receptor (RTR), also referred to as germ cell nuclear factor (9Chen F.

During embryonic development RTR is expressed in early embryonic stem cells, trophoblasts, and neuronal precursor cells while in the adult RTR expression is largely limited to testis and ovary (9Chen F.

In the testis, RTR is most abundant in round spermatids suggesting that RTR controls gene transcription during a specific stage of spermatogenesis (9Chen F. Cooney A.J. Wang Y. Law S.W. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1434-1444PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hirose T. O'Brien D.A. Jetten A.M. Gene. 1995; 152: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 17Susens U. Aguiluz J.B. Evans R.M.

Dev. 1998; 50: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Several studies have indicated that RTR is also important during embryonic development. Targeted disruption of the RTR gene is embryonic lethal in mice (20Chung A.C. Katz D. Pereira F.A. Jackson K.J. DeMayo F.J. Cooney A.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 663-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Embryos exhibit open neural tubes and an absence of posterior structures and do not survive beyond 10.5 days post-coitus probably due to cardiovascular failure. These studies suggest that RTR is essential for the postgastrulation and neurulation stages of mouse development. A recent study identified a role for RTR in the repression of the POU-domain transcription factor Oct4 (21Fuhrmann G. Chung A.C. Jackson K.J. Hummelke G. Baniahmad A. Sutter J. Sylvester I.

Overexpression of a dominant-negative RTR mutant in Xenopus showed that RTR has an essential function in anteroposterior differentiation during organogenesis (22David R. Joos T.O. Dreyer C. Mech.

RTR has been demonstrated to bind preferentially as a homodimer to DNA response elements consisting of the consensus sequence [AGGTCA]2 (23Yan Z.H. Medvedev A. Hirose T. Gotoh H. Jetten A.M. J. Biol.

This repression is mediated at least in part through an interaction of RTR with the co-repressor N-CoR.

Chem. 2000; 275: 35077-35085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Because both RAP80 and N-CoR interact with RTR and require the hinge region of RTR for binding, one might predict that the interaction of RAP80 and N-CoR to RTR interfere with each other. As shown in Fig. 11, RAP80 inhibits the interaction of N-CoR with RTR likely by competing with each other for RTR binding. The hinge region is required for the interaction of N-CoR with several nuclear receptors and appears to function as a structural determinant rather than serving as a direct interface in N-CoR binding (43Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Nagy L. Kao H.Y. Love J.D., Li, C. Banayo E. Gooch J.T. Krishna V. Chatterjee K. Evans R.M. Schwabe J.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3209-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). These observations seem to indicate that RAP80 interferes with the binding of N-CoR to RTR through a mechanism of steric hindrance rather than competing for the same binding interface.RAP80 mRNA was found in many different human tissues but was most abundantly expressed in testis. In situ hybridization of sections from mouse testis indicated that RAP80 is expressed most highly in germ cells. Because no significant differences in the level or pattern of hybridization were observed between seminiferous tubules at different stages of spermatogenesis, expression of RAP80 mRNA appears not to be differentially regulated during spermatogenesis. This was supported by Northern blot analysis using RNA from different germ cell populations (not shown). Previous studies have demonstrated that RTR is differentially regulated during spermatogenesis and most highly expressed in spermatids (9Chen F. Cooney A.J. Wang Y. Law S.W. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1434-1444PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hirose T. O'Brien D.A. Jetten A.M. Gene. 1995; 152: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 18Zhang Y.L. Akmal K.M. Tsuruta J.K. Shang Q. Hirose T. Jetten A.M. Kim K.H. O'Brien D.A. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1998; 50: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because RTR and RAP80 are co-expressed in spermatids and in embryonal carcinoma cells and trophoblasts (not shown) (19Mehta D.V. Kim Y.-S. Dixon D. Jetten A.M. Placenta. 2002; 23: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), RAP80 may change RTR function and signaling in these cells. What the physiological significance is of the interaction between RAP80 and RTR awaits further analysis using functional assays. Because RAP80 mRNA is also found in tissues where RTR is not expressed suggests that RAP80 has additional functions and likely interacts with other (nuclear) proteins.In summary, in this study we identify a novel nuclear protein, referred to as RAP80. This protein localizes to the nucleus and is able to repress basal transcription. We demonstrate that this protein interacts physically with the nuclear orphan receptor RTR. Deletion and point mutation analysis identified a region within the hinge domain of RTR that is essential for this interaction. This region is also required for the interaction of the co-repressor N-CoR. RAP80 and N-CoR appear to compete with each other for binding to RTR possibly through steric hindrance. Our results suggest that RAP80 may play a role in modulating the transcriptional and biological activity of RTR possibly by functioning as a co-repressor. In this study, we describe the cloning of a cDNA encoding the full-length human RAP80 protein. Examination of the RAP80 protein sequence revealed several distinctive features, two putative zinc finger motifs, three nuclear localization signals, a Glu-rich region, a PEST sequence, and a potential ubiquitin-interaction motif between Thr80 and Glu98 (37Hofmann K. Falquet L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 347-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The two putative zinc finger motifs at the carboxyl terminus of RAP80 exhibit the consensus sequence Cys-X2-Cys-X11-His-X3-Cys. The sequence separating the zinc finger motifs does not exhibit any homology with the consensus motif (T/S)GEKP (Y/F)X, typically found as interfinger spacer in members of the Krüppel-like zinc finger proteins (38Schuh R. Aicher W. Gaul U. Cote S. Preiss A. Maier D. Seifert E. Nauber U. Schroder C. Kemler R. Cell. 1986; 47: 1025-1032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) suggesting that RAP80 does not belong to the Krüppel-like zinc finger protein superfamily. The class CCHC-type zinc finger motifs found in RAP80 has been described in only a limited number of proteins. Members of the NZF and FOG transcription factor families contain zinc finger motifs with the consensus Cys-X2-Cys-X4-His-X1–5-Cys (39Berkovits H.J. Berg J.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16826-16830Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 40Jiang Y., Yu, V.C. Buchholz F. O'Connell S. Rhodes S.J. Candeloro C. Xia Y.R. Lusis A.J. Rosenfeld M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10723-10730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 41Matthews J.M. Kowalski K. Liew C.K. Sharpe B.K. Fox A.H. Crossley M. MacKay J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1030-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A different class of Cys-X2-Cys-X4-His-X4-Cys motifs, referred to as “zinc knuckle” fingers, are contained in DNA-binding proteins from several retroviruses (42Ramboarina S. Morellet N. Fournie-Zaluski M.C. Roques B.P. Moreller N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9600-9607Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). RAP80 appears to be unique and unrelated to these nuclear proteins. Zinc finger motifs can exhibit multiple functions, including a role in DNA recognition, protein-protein interactions, and nuclear localization. We are in the process of examining whether RAP80 can recognize a specific DNA sequence and whether it functions as a DNA-binding protein. Confocal microscopic analysis localized RAP80 to the nucleus, suggesting that RAP80 functions as a nuclear protein. RAP80 is distributed in a speckled pattern, suggesting that it is part of a multiprotein complex. RAP80 contains three putative nuclear localization signals: at Arg3, Arg715, and a bipartite nuclear localization signal between Lys19 and Arg35 (36Boulikas T. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 32-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Deletion analysis indicated that the bipartite nuclear localization signal is important in mediating nuclear transport of RAP80. The nuclear localization and the presence of two zinc finger-like motifs suggested that RAP80 may function as a transcription factor. We therefore investigated whether it exhibited any transcriptional activity. Monohybrid analysis using different cell types showed that in several cell lines RAP80 was unable to enhance transcription of a reporter gene, suggesting that it did not function as a transcriptional activator under these conditions. Instead, Gal4(DBD)-RAP80 inhibited basal transcription, indicating that it may function as an active repressor. Deletion mutant analysis indicated that the repressor function is associated with the amino terminus of RAP80. This region has no similarity to any other known repressor domain. RAP80 exhibits a 74% identity with a partial protein sequence referred to as RIP110 encoded by one of several sequences identified by yeast two-hybrid screening using the ligand binding domain of the RXRα receptor as bait (33Seol W. Choi H.S. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 72-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RIP110 appears to represent the carboxyl terminus of the mouse homologue of RAP80 and has not been studied further. Because of the observed interaction of RIP110 with RXR in yeast two-hybrid analysis, we investigated the interaction of RAP80 with a number of nuclear receptors in mammalian two-hybrid analysis. This analysis included the retinoid receptors RXRα and RARα, the estrogen receptor α, the thyroid hormone receptor α, and the orphan receptors RTR and TAK1 and was carried out in either the presence or absence of their respective ligand (not shown). These analyses revealed an interaction only between RAP80 and RTR (Fig. 7). Deletion and point mutation analysis identified a region within the hinge domain of RTR that is essential for its interaction with RAP80 while the ligand binding domain of RTR was not required. Several regions within RAP80 were important for optimal interaction with RTR. These observations suggest a function for RAP80 in modulating RTR activity. RAP80 may have multiple roles in RTR signaling. It may function as a co-repressor, as a mediator to recruit other proteins to RTR or target RTR to a particular complex or compartment such as nuclear matrix or proteasome. The fact that RAP80 inhibits basal transcriptional activity may suggest that it functions as a co-repressor. Previous studies have demonstrated that RTR can function as an active repressor of transcription and is involved in the repression of transcription of the POU-domain transcriptional factor Oct4 (21Fuhrmann G.

Chem. 2000; 275: 35077-35085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Repression by nuclear receptors is mediated through interaction with multiprotein co-repressor complexes that contain histone deacetylase activity and affect chromatin structure. The protein N-CoR has been reported to physically interact with RTR and to function as a co-repressor for RTR. This interaction was shown to require the ligand binding domain as well as the hinge domain of RTR for optimal binding (28Yan Z. Jetten A.M. J. Biol.

The mechanism of this effect is not well understood. We have previously shown that 17β-estradiol down-regulates the basic helix-loop-helix factorHairy and Enhancer of Split homologue-1 in MCF-7 and T47D cells (Ström, A., Arai, N., Leers, J., and Gustafsson, J.

Treatment of the same cells with all-trans-retinoic acid prevented 17β-estradiol-mediated down-regulation of the factor. The antiproliferative effect of all-trans-retinoic acid correlated well with the prevention of Hairy and Enhancer of Split homologue-1 down-regulation.

By using a receptor-specific ligand we were able to show that the retinoic acid receptor α is important for regulation of the Hairyand Enhancer of Split homologue-1. Expression of a dominant negative form of Hairy and Enhancer of Splithomologue-1 in MCF-7 cells abolished the growth-inhibitory effect of all-trans-retinoic acid in these cells.

Lotan D. Sacks P.G. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 190: 100-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These compounds have been used increasingly in cancer treatment where all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA)1 is used to treat various forms of cancer; one example is its use as a differentiating agent in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (2Huang M.E. Ye Y.C. Chen S.R. Chai J.R. Lu J.X. Zhoa L. Gu L.J. Wang Z.Y. Blood. 1988; 72: 567-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Retinoids are also used as chemopreventive agents for treatment of skin, head, neck, and liver cancer. One study concerning colon cancer has shown that atRA can act as a chemopreventive agent on the formation of azoxymethane-induced aberrant crypt foci (3Stopera S.A. Bird R.P. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 53: 798-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Retinoids have also been demonstrated to have an antiproliferative effect on breast cancer cell lines (4Zhu W.Y. Jones C.S. Kiss A. Matsukuma K. Amin S. De Luca L.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 234: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 5Wang Q. Yang W. Uytingco M.S. Christakos S. Wieder R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2040-2048PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been established that atRA functions as an anti-estrogen in terms of effect on 17β-estradiol-stimulated proliferation in estrogen receptor α (ERα)-expressing breast cancer cell lines (6Cho Y. Tighe A.P. Talmage D.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 172: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The mechanism of the inhibition of proliferation by atRA is largely unknown, but one possibility is that atRA acts by inhibiting AP-1 activity (7DiSepio D. Sutter M. Johnson A.T. Chandraratna R.A. Nagpal S. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 1999; 1: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Another study shows that atRA increases the rate of D-type cyclin and Skp2 ubiquitinylation, where Skp2 is a protein that targets p27 for degradation. These events have been shown to occur in both T47D and MCF-7 cells (8Dow R. Hendley J. Pirkmaier A. Musgrove E.A. Germain D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45945-45951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Resistance to atRA treatment has been reported in breast cancer cell lines like MDA-MB-231, which lacks the retinoic acid receptor α (RARα) (5Wang Q. Yang W. Uytingco M.S. Christakos S. Wieder R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2040-2048PubMed Google Scholar). Another form of resistance to atRA can occur in cells lacking cellular retinoic acid-binding protein II (9Budhu A.S. Noy N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2632-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In an earlier report, we have shown that the Hairyand Enhancer of split homologue-1 (HES-1) is down-regulated by 17β-estradiol in breast cancer cell lines expressing ERα and that this down-regulation is essential for the proliferative effect of 17β-estradiol (10Ström A. Arai N. Leers J. Gustafsson J.Å. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5951-5953Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this study, we treated MCF-7 cells with 1 nm 17β-estradiol and increasing levels of atRA. We found that atRA prevented 17β-estradiol from down-regulating HES-1 expression and that this regulation correlated well with the effect of atRA on proliferation. Expression of a dominant negative form of HES-1 resulted in inhibition of this effect of atRA. MCF-7 and COS-7 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 0.1% kanamycin (Sigma). 17β-Estradiol and atRA (both from Sigma) were dissolved in ethanol and Me2SO, respectively. The RARα-specific agonist RO 40-6055 (donated by Hoffman-La Roche) was dissolved in Me2SO. Actinomycin D was purchased from Sigma and dissolved in Me2SO. The construct used for stable transfection, containing dominant negative FLAG-tagged HES-1 (dn-HES-1), has mutations in the basic DNA binding domain where amino acids Glu-43, Lys-44, and Arg-47 were each mutated to Ala, and in addition the protein is truncated at amino acid 157 by using an internal SmaI site. Transfection of this construct into MCF-7 cells was done using FuGENETM 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and stable transfectants were selected using 800 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Cells were plated at a density of 20,000 cells/cm2. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with stripped medium (phenol red-free medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% dextran/charcoal-treated FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 0.1% kanamycin) and different treatments (with/without 17β-estradiol and atRA). After 6 days of growth, the cellular ATP was extracted using 5% trichloroacetic acid followed by measurement of the amount of ATP, which is proportional to the cell number. The measurement of ATP was performed using Biothema's ATP kit and a microplate luminometer (Berthold). Cells were plated and grown in 150-mm plates at ∼50% confluency for 24 h before medium replacement with stripped medium including different treatments. Extraction of nuclear proteins was done 72 h later according to standard protocols (12Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). 50 μg of proteins were loaded into each well. Separation, blotting, and visualization of the proteins were described previously (10Ström A. Arai N. Leers J. Gustafsson J.Å. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5951-5953Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The relative expression was calculated using the NIH Image (version 1.62) program (rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/download.html). Nuclei were isolated from MCF-7 cells stably expressing dn-HES-1 or from COS-7 cells transiently transfected with HES-1, inserted into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), and dn-HES-1 using the DEAE-dextran method (13Gulick T. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. J. Wiley and Sons, New York1997: 9.2.1-9.2.5Google Scholar). Prior to nuclear extraction, COS-7 cells were grown for 48 h, whereas MCF-7 cells were grown for 24 h in the presence of 10 nm ICI 182,780 (Tocris). Nuclear proteins were diluted twice in dH20, incubated with M5 FLAG antibodies (Sigma) at 1:1000 dilution for 1 h, and added to protein G-Sepharose beads (AmershamBiosciences) for an additional hour. The beads were washed thoroughly with 1:1 dH20:High salt buffer (10 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and boiled with 1× SDS loading buffer. After centrifugation, the supernatant was separated, blotted, and visualized as described by Western analysis. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and digested with DNase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 3 μg of total RNA were then reverse-transcribed using random hexamer priming and the SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 100 ng of cDNA was amplified in a real-time PCR using TaqMan® Universal Master Mix (PE Applied Biosystems), 200 nm primer for HES-1 and 300 nm fluorogenic HES-1 probe. The real-time PCR reactions were performed in an ABI PRISM Model 7700 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems) under the following conditions: 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 1 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The optimum concentration of primers and probe was determined in preliminary experiments. The sequences of HES-1 primers and probe are as follow: forward primer, 5′-AGG CGG ACA TTC TGG AAA TG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CGG TAC TTC CCC AGC ACA CTT-3′; probe, 5′-FAM-TGT GCT CAG CGC AGC CAT CTG C-TAMRA-3′. Real-time PCR was done in triplicates. The 18 S rRNA (Pre-Developed TaqMan® Assay Reagents, Applied Biosystems) was used as reference gene. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with 1 nm 17β-estradiol resulted in an increase in cellular proliferation, whereas addition of increasing amounts of atRA produced a dose-dependent inhibition of this proliferation (Fig. 1 A). Analyses of HES-1 protein levels show an inverted correlation between HES-1 protein expression and atRA-mediated inhibition of proliferation (Fig. 1 B). We show that 1 nm 17β-estradiol down-regulated HES-1 protein to ∼5% of that in non-treated cells (Fig. 1 B). As little as 10 nm atRA restored expression of HES-1 to more than 60% of non-treated levels, and following 100 nm atRA treatment, which significantly inhibits the estradiol-induced proliferation, 75% of HES-1 protein was present. By using 1 μm atRA, the expression of HES-1 was fully restored. Since this correlation could be coincidental we made a dominant negative form of HES-1 (dn-HES-1), which can form a heterodimer with endogenous HES-1 and inactivate its function. In contrast to non-transfected MCF-7 cells, cells that are stably transfected with the dominant negative form of HES-1 showed no responsiveness to atRA (Fig.2 A). The more than 100% increase in cellular proliferation induced by estradiol was not affected by as much as 1 μm atRA. MCF-7 cells transfected with empty plasmid behaved as normal cells in terms of response to atRA (Fig. 2 B). This result suggests that HES-1 is an important factor participating in the inhibition of estrogen-stimulated proliferation of MCF-7 cells by atRA.Figure 2No effect of all-trans-retinoic acid on proliferation in cells that express exogenous dominant negative HES-1. After 6 days of culturing in phenol red-free medium supplemented with 5% hormone-depleted serum, proliferation was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values are means ± S.D. (n = 6). A, cells stably expressing dn-HES-1. B, cells stably transfected with empty vector.E2 , 17β-estradiol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To investigate whether the effect of dn-HES-1 is cell-specific, we used another cell line, T47D, that had been stably transfected with dn-HES-1 using a tetracycline-regulated system of expression. Also this cell line showed that the effect of atRA on proliferation was removed by inducing expression of dn-HES-1 (data not shown). These findings strongly suggest that HES-1 expression is important for the antiproliferative effect of atRA in these cells as well. To verify that the dn-HES-1 expressed in the MCF-7 cells is dimerizing with wild-type HES-1 we used nuclear extracts prepared from dn-HES-1-expressing MCF-7 cells and performed immunoprecipitation with a FLAG antibody. Fig.3 A shows that the FLAG epitope-fused dn-HES-1 indeed dimerized with endogenous HES-1. In addition, in COS-7 cells co-transfected with wild-type HES-1 and dn-HES-1, the same heterodimer was formed and could be immunoprecipitated with the FLAG antibody (Fig. 3 B). Although no general statement about the mechanism of the antiproliferative effect of atRA in other tissues or cell lines can be made, the mechanism behind the antiproliferative effect of atRA in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 is likely to depend on regulation of HES-1 expression. Since earlier reports have shown that RARα is the receptor responsible for the antiproliferative effect of atRA in MCF-7 cells (14Raffo P. Emionite L. Colucci L. Belmondo F. Moro M.G. Bollag W. Toma S. Anticancer Res. 2000; 20: 1535-1543PubMed Google Scholar) we wanted to investigate whether RARα could regulate HES-1 expression. To answer this question, we used the specific agonist RO 40-6055 for RARα (14Raffo P. Emionite L. Colucci L. Belmondo F. Moro M.G. Bollag W. Toma S. Anticancer Res. 2000; 20: 1535-1543PubMed Google Scholar). In MCF-7 cells, the RARα-specific agonist strongly up-regulated HES-1 expression in the presence of 1 nm 17β-estradiol (Fig. 4). To investigate whether atRA affected HES-1 expression at the mRNA level, we used real-time PCR on RNA prepared from MCF-7 cells treated for 24 h with 1 nm 17β-estradiol and increasing levels of atRA. HES-1 mRNA expression was strongly up-regulated by atRA treatment in these cells (Fig.5 A).Figure 5atRA regulates HES-1 transcriptionally. mRNA was extracted from cells grown in phenol red-free medium supplemented with 5% hormone-depleted serum, treated according to the protocols mentioned earlier, and analyzed using real-time PCR as described under “Experimental Procedures.”A, cells treated for 24 h; B, cells treated for 7 h. Gray bars are with 5 μg/ml actinomycin D, and black bars are without actinomycin D.E2 , 17β-estradiol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We used actinomycin D to block transcription of the HES-1 gene and real-time PCR to measure the levels of mRNA after treatment with 17β-estradiol and atRA. HES-1 mRNA stability did not change after treatment with estrogen or atRA (Fig. 5 B). This finding strongly indicates that atRA affects HES-1 expression at the transcriptional level. Most breast cancer cell lines positive for ERα increase their proliferation in response to 17β-estradiol treatment. In this study, we investigated atRA-mediated inhibition of estradiol-stimulated proliferation and chose MCF-7 cells as a model for an estrogen-dependent cell line. Several reports have shown that atRA inhibits estrogen-dependent proliferation in this cell line (4Zhu W.Y. Jones C.S. Kiss A. Matsukuma K. Amin S. De Luca L.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 234: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 15Zhou Q. Stetler-Stevenson M. Steeg P.S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In an earlier report, we showed that HES-1 is strongly down-regulated by 17β-estradiol treatment in the estrogen-dependent cell lines T47D and MCF-7. Furthermore, if this down-regulation is prevented by expression of HES-1 from a tetracycline-regulated expression vector, the proliferative effect of 17β-estradiol treatment is canceled (10Ström A. Arai N. Leers J. Gustafsson J.Å. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5951-5953Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which HES-1 prevents 17β-estradiol-mediated proliferation of MCF-7 cells is currently not known. It is possible that the inhibition takes place later in the G1 phase rather than early and may involve factors such as Cdc25A or other factors affecting Cdk2 rather than cyclin D1 activity. Foster et al. (16Foster J.S. Henley D.C. Bukovsky A. Seth P. Wimalasena J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 794-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) have recently shown that 17β-estradiol regulates expression of Cdk inhibitor and the Cdk2-activating phosphatase Cdc25A independently of cyclin D1-Cdk4 function and cell cycle progression in MCF-7 cells. HES-1 has been shown to inhibit proliferation in PC12 cells as well. In this cell type, an up-regulation of HES-1 by atRA has been observed (11Castella P. Sawai S. Nakao K. Wagner J.A. Caudy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6170-6183Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), which is in agreement with previously published results that atRA treatment of this cell type leads to inhibition of proliferation (17Miller Jr., W.H. Moy D. Li A. Grippo J.F. Dmitrovsky E. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 511-517PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of HES-1 in NIH 3T3 cells also inhibits cellular proliferation; accordingly, HES-1 seems to affect proliferation in many cell types (11Castella P. Sawai S. Nakao K. Wagner J.A. Caudy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6170-6183Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the effect of HES-1 may not be general since Sriuranpong et al. (18Sriuranpong V. Borges M.W. Ravi R.K. Arnold D.R. Nelkin B.D. Baylin S.B. Ball D.W. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3200-3205PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that HES-1 expression does not inhibit proliferation of small cell lung cancer cells. In breast cancer cell lines, the retinoic acid receptor α has been shown to mediate the antiproliferative effect of atRA (14Raffo P. Emionite L. Colucci L. Belmondo F. Moro M.G. Bollag W. Toma S. Anticancer Res. 2000; 20: 1535-1543PubMed Google Scholar). This agrees with our finding that HES-1 is regulated by RARα since the α specific-agonist RO 40-6055 was able to up-regulate HES-1 expression. The regulation of HES-1 is transcriptional since real-time PCR clearly showed dose-dependent accumulation of mRNA after treatment with atRA, and furthermore actinomycin D prevented this accumulation of mRNA in response to atRA treatment. Analysis of the promoter region of human HES-1 shows that it does not contain any good consensus sequence for the retinoic acid receptor, but it does contain many AP-1 sites, which are potential retinoic acid response elements (19Chen J.Y. Penco S. Ostrowski J. Balaguer P. Pons M. Starrett J.E. Reczek P. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1187-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Stimulation of transcription by atRA through an AP-1 element has been shown for the CSF-1 receptor gene (20Sapi E. Flick M.B. Tartaro K. Kim S. Rakhlin Y. Rodov S. Kacinski B.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5578-5585PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the antiproliferative effect of atRA has been suggested to be dependent on down-regulation of AP-1 activity (7DiSepio D. Sutter M. Johnson A.T. Chandraratna R.A. Nagpal S. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 1999; 1: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These conflicting findings might indicate that activation of an AP-1 element could lead to up- or down-regulation of downstream genes in response to atRA, depending on promoter context. At this point in the study, it is difficult to speculate how inhibition of HES-1 function might interfere with AP-1 activity, but it is possible that the effect of HES-1 might be indirect. That is, a component that is important for the inhibition of AP-1 may be dependent on HES-1 expression. Furthermore, retinoids have been shown to inhibit cyclin D1 expression in breast cancer cell lines (15Zhou Q. Stetler-Stevenson M. Steeg P.S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A recent publication by Dow et al. (8Dow R. Hendley J. Pirkmaier A. Musgrove E.A. Germain D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45945-45951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) describes that atRA treatment of breast cancer cell lines induces cyclin D1 ubiquitinylation and subsequent degradation. Also, in the same study another protein, Skp2, is ubiquitinylated, which leads to p27 accumulation since this protein targets p27 for degradation. A scenario where atRA affects several components important for cell cycle progression is possible. This could mean that regulation of HES-1 expression is important for the effect of atRA on only one or a few of such components. More detailed studies are in progress to dissect the mechanism by which HES-1 affects proliferation of breast cancer cell lines.

H1 histones contain two structurally different types of nuclear localization signals (NLS). The first type of NLS resides within the unstructured C-terminal domain and is rich in basic amino acids. In contrast, the highly conserved central domain of the H1 histone contains comparatively few basic amino acids but also represents a functional NLS. The competence for the nuclear import of this globular domain seems to be based on its secondary structure. Here, we show that the Impβ-Imp7 heterodimer is the only receptor for H1 import. Furthermore, we identified the import receptors mediating the in vitro transport of different NLS of the H1 histone. Using the digitonin-permeabilized cell import assay we show that Impβ is the most efficient import receptor for the globular domain of H1 histones, whereas the heterodimer of Impβ and Imp7 is the functional receptor for the entire C-terminal domain. However, short fragments of the C-terminal domain are imported in vitro by at least four different importins, which resembles the import pathway of ribosomal proteins and core histones. In addition, we show that heterodimerization of Impβ with Imp7 is absolutely necessary for their proper function as an import receptor for H1 histones. These findings point to a chaperone-like function of the heterodimeric complex in addition to its function as an import receptor.

It appears that the Impβ-Imp7 heterodimer is specialized for NLS consisting of extended basic domains. nuclear localization signal(s) importin glutathioneS-transferase amino acid(s) Histones are the protein component of the fundamental structural unit of eukaryotic chromatin, the nucleosome. The nucleosome is composed of a core particle consisting of a histone octamer with 146 bp of DNA bent around its surface and an approximately 50-bp linker DNA connecting two adjacent core particles. This linker DNA is associated with H1 histones; hence they are termed linker histones (1Wolffe A.P. Chromatin, Structure and Function. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, London, UK1998Google Scholar). The four core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 form the histone octamer. Histones are small, very basic proteins. The linker histone H1 is highly enriched in lysine, H2A and H2B are moderately lysine-rich, and H3 and H4 are rich in arginine. The size of core histones varies between 11 kDa (H4) and 15 kDa (H3), whereas the H1 histones have a size of ∼22 kDa. In mammals the class of H1 histones, the linker histones, comprises seven different subtypes, termed H1.1–H1.5, H1°, and H1t (2Albig W. Meergans T. Doenecke D. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 184: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Histones are composed of three domains, the very basic, unstructured C- and N-terminal domains and the hydrophobic, central globular domain, which forms the histone fold motif in the case of the core histones (3Luger K. Ma¨der A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6725) Google Scholar) and is involved in histone-histone interactions. During the S phase of the cell cycle, a vast amount of newly synthesized histones has to be imported into the nucleus for the formation of nucleosomes on newly replicated DNA. Thus, histones are among the most abundant substrates for nuclear transport during the S phase. Nuclear pore complexes are the sole sites of nucleocytoplasmic exchange of proteins. They penetrate the double membrane of the nuclear envelope, allow diffusion of small molecules, and can even facilitate the active transport of large molecules or molecule complexes (4Feldherr C.M. Kallenbach E. Schultz N. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 2216-2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Because of their small size, histones might be expected to enter the nucleus simply by diffusion. But we and others have shown that the histones are transported to the nucleoplasm by an energy-dependent and receptor-mediated process (5Breeuwer M. Goldfarb D.S. Cell. 1990; 60: 999-1008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 6Imamoto N. Tachibana T. Matsubae M. Yoneda Y. J. Biol.

Biochem. 2001; 81: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The receptor-mediated nuclear transport of proteins depends on topogenic signals in the primary sequence of karyophilic proteins. The first NLS identified in karyophilic proteins were short sequence motifs in the large T-antigen of SV40 virus (11Kalderon B. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1843) Google Scholar) and in nucleoplasmin, an acidic protein involved in chromatin assembly. Both signals consist of clusters of basic amino acids. The NLS in the SV40 large T-antigen consists of a heptapeptide containing 5 basic amino acids, whereas the nucleoplasmin NLS is bipartite and contains two short clusters of basic amino acids separated by a spacer of ∼10 other amino acids (12Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). These two NLS are referred to as classical nuclear localization signals (NLS).1 In the meantime, other primary structure motifs have been described that facilitate the nuclear transport of proteins, such as the M9 sequence in heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (13Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Nakielny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1996; 86: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), and nuclear targeting signals of ribosomal proteins, such as L23a (14Ja¨kel S. Go¨rlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4491-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) and L5 (15Claussen M. Rudt F. Pieler T. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 12061-12068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In general, these nonclassical nuclear targeting signals are longer than the two classical NLS motifs (for review see Ref. 17Christophe D. Christophe-Hobertus C. Pichon B. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Histones contain several portions that are capable of mediating nuclear transport. One type of topogenic sequence (NLS type 1) consists of clustered basic amino acids in the unstructured, extended parts of either core or linker histones. NLS of this type have been described within the N-terminal tails of yeast core histones (18Moreland R.B. Langevin G.L. Singer R.H. Garcea R.L. Hereford L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4048-4057Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 19Mosammaparast N. Jackson K.R. Guo Y. Brame C.J. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Pemberton L.F. J.

Biochem. 2001; 81: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and within the C-terminal extended portions of H1 histones (8Schwamborn K. Albig W. Doenecke D. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 206-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The globular portions of the histones represent a second type (NLS type 2) of nuclear localization signal (8Schwamborn K. Albig W. Doenecke D. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 206-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 10Baake M. Doenecke D. Albig W. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In these cases, not just primary structure motifs but the tertiary structures of the respective protein domains appear to define the topogenic signal. The active import of proteins into the nucleus requires nuclear transport factors. Transport receptors bind the nuclear proteins on the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear envelope, translocate with these through the nuclear pore complex, release the nuclear protein on the nuclear side of the nuclear pore complex, and finally return to the cytoplasm. The binding of the cargo proteins depends on the state of the Ran GTPase system. The GTP-bound state of Ran, the predominant form in the nucleus, promotes the dissociation of the complex of nuclear protein and import receptor, whereas GTP hydrolysis stimulated by RanGAP1 in the cytoplasm facilitates complex formation (21Izaurralde E. Kutay U. von Kobbe C. Mattaj I.W. Go¨rlich D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6535-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). All known receptors involved in this transport are at least distantly related to importin β, the first identified import receptor (22Go¨rlich D. Vogel F. Mills A.D. Hartmann E. Laskey R.A. Nature. 1995; 377: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Sequencing of the yeast genome led to the identification of a superfamily of 14 importin β-related genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and it is estimated that even more members of this family may be found in higher eukaryotes. Proteins with classical NLS are transported by a heterodimeric import receptor consisting of Impβ and an adapter molecule, termed Impα. Many other proteins such as ribosomal proteins (14Ja¨kel S. Go¨rlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4491-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), cyclin B (23Takizawa C.G. Weis K. Morgan D.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7938-7943Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and core histones (19Mosammaparast N. Jackson K.R. Guo Y. Brame C.J. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Pemberton L.F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 20Mosammaparast N. Guo Y. Shabanowitz J.,. Hunt D.F. Pemberton L.F. J. Biol.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 690-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) are transported by monomeric import receptors, members of the importin β superfamily. An exception is the nuclear transport of linker histone H1, which depends on a heterodimeric receptor consisting of two members of the importin β-family, namely Impβ and Imp7 (9Ja¨kel S. Albig W. Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Schwamborn K. Doenecke D. Go¨rlich D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). This complex is also a functional import receptor of two ribosomal proteins, namely rpL4 and rpL6 (26Ja¨kel S. Mingot J.M. Schwarzmaier P. Hartmann E. Go¨rlich D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Here we have analyzed the different NLS of the H1 histones with respect to their interaction with import factors. The functional relevance of the observed interactions was verified by reconstitution experiments in the in vitro import assay with recombinant transport factors. Individual NLS of H1 can be imported by individual import factors, but the nuclear import of the entire protein depends on the heterodimerization of Impβ with Imp7. This indicates that the heterodimeric complex is not just an import receptor, but it also exerts a histone H1-related function, most likely as a chaperone for this highly basic molecule. HeLa cells were obtained from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSM, Braunschweig, Germany). The cells were grown in modified Eagle’s medium (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Biochrom) and maintained in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. HeLa cells were removed from plastic dishes by trypsinization and replated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml of modified Eagle’s medium on glass cover slips in wells of a tissue culture plate 48 h before the digitonin-permeabilized cell assay. The expression constructs for the histone H1° fusion proteins were generated as follows. To allow the expression of fusion proteins of H1° histone and fragments of H1° histone, with two (2z) or six (6z) consecutive z tags (IgG-binding domain from protein A) at the N terminus in addition to a C-terminal His tag, in Escherichia coli, we used the p2z70 vector or the p6z70 vector, respectively (modified pQE70 vector; Qiagen). The coding sequences for the human H1° histone fragments were either taken from the corresponding pKS vectors of the transfection system (described in Ref. 8Schwamborn K. Albig W. Doenecke D. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 206-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) or amplified by PCR from plasmids containing the corresponding histone gene. The amplified or excised fragments were cloned into the BamHI restriction site of the p2z70 vector or into the SmaI/NheI restriction site of the p6z70 vector, respectively. For binding studies, H1° histone or fragments thereof were exclusively expressed as 2z fusion proteins (p2z70). For the in vitro import assay the globular domain and fragments of the C-terminal domain of H1° histone were used as 6z fusion proteins (p6z70). Full-length H1° histone containing an additional cysteine (H1°-Cys), used in the in vitro import assay, was expressed in yeast (32Albig W. Runge D.M. Kratzmeier M. Doenecke D. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The cysteine had been introduced by site-directed mutagenesis of the yeast expression plasmid for H1° (pWA310) described in Ref. 32Albig W. Runge D.M. Kratzmeier M. Doenecke D. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar. Fragments from Imp7 were amplified from the expression plasmid for Imp7 (28Go¨rlich D. Dabrowski M. Bischoff F.R. Kutay U. Bork P. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Izaurralde E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 65-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) using PCR with primer pairs that each introduced aBamHI site. The amplified fragments were cloned into theBamHI site of the p2z70 vector. The expression construct for ΔImp7 lacking the 2z tag was generated by excision of the corresponding coding sequence for the Imp7 fragment (1–1007) from the pAB73 vector (based on p2z70) with BamHI. This fragment was cloned into the BamHI site of the pQE30 vector (Qiagen) allowing expression with an N-terminal His tag. The H1° histone and importin 7 fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli JM109 and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Full-length H1° histone (H1°-Cys) was expressed in S. cerevisiae and purified as described (32Albig W. Runge D.M. Kratzmeier M. Doenecke D. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The following proteins were expressed in E. coli BLR/Rep4 and purified as described in the literature indicated:Xenopus importin α (29Go¨rlich D. Prehn S. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E.

Izaurralde E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 65-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of Ran, RanQ69L(GTP), NTF2, L23a 2z and 4z fusion proteins, the IBB-6z fusion protein, and the M9-GST fusion protein was performed as described (13Pollard V.W.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4491-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Bacteria expressing the recombinant 2z fusion proteins were lysed in binding buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the cleared bacterial lysate was incubated with IgG-Sepharose beads to a final concentration of ∼1 mg protein/ml IgG-Sepharose-matrix. The preloaded matrix was washed twice with binding buffer and used as affinity matrix for the binding experiments. For each binding experiment 20 μl of the respective affinity matrix was incubated with 250 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) or with 150 pmol of the corresponding recombinant import factor in binding buffer at 4 °C for 3 h in the presence or absence of 1.5 μm RanQ69L(GTP) (when indicated). The matrix was then washed twice with ice-cold binding buffer, and bound material was eluted with 1.5 m MgCl2, precipitated with isopropanol, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The binding experiments for determining the Impβ binding domain of Imp7 were done in the same way with recombinant Impβ but always in the absence of RanQ69L. The isolated recombinant full-length histone H1° containing an additional cysteine (H1°-Cys), which was expressed in yeast, was dialyzed into 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 110 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate and incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 25-fold molar excess of fluorescein-5′-maleimide (Pierce) for fluorescence labeling. Purified histone H1° fusion proteins expressed in E. coliwere dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 300 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate and incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 10-fold molar excess of fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma) or alternatively with a 10-fold molar excess of FLUOS (Roche). Labeling of 4z-L23a with fluorescein 5′-maleimide was performed in 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 300 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate. All of the labeling reaction mixtures were passed over NAP™ 5 columns (Pharmacia Corp.) equilibrated in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 250 mm sucrose to remove free fluorochrome. The method used is based on the one established by Adam et al. (27Adam S.A. Sterne-Marr R. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar) and includes the modification described previously (24Baake M. Ba¨uerle M. Doenecke D. Albig W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The digitonin-permeabilized cells were incubated for 20 min at 23 °C with 20 μl of a transport reaction mix consisting of 1 μm fluorescence-labeled substrates, 10 μl of reticulocyte lysate as a source of cytosolic components and an energy-regenerating system (0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm GTP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, and 50 μg/ml creatine kinase) in transport buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mmmagnesium acetate, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 250 mm sucrose). For protein import with recombinant transport factors (reconstitution experiments), reticulocyte lysate was replaced by 0.5 μm of the indicated transport factor and a Ran mix (3 μm Ran(GDP) and 0.4 μm NTF2 in transport buffer). For the negative controls the assay was done in the absence of any transport factors,i.e. without reticulocyte lysate and recombinant transport factors. To deplete reticulocyte lysate of Impβ, 100 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) was incubated with 20 μl of preloaded matrix for 3 h at 4 °C. The preloaded matrix was generated by incubation of 10 μg of recombinant IBB-2z fusion protein expressed in E. coliwith 20 μl of IgG-Sepharose for 16 h at 4 °C. After incubation of the preloaded matrix with reticulocyte lysate, the matrix with the bound factors was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was used as depleted cytosol in the in vitrotransport assay. Previously, we identified transport receptors for the nuclear import of the H1 histones in binding experiments and in the in vitro import assay with recombinant import factors. We found that two β-family import receptors, namely Impβ and Imp7, play a critical role in the import of H1 histones (9Ja¨kel S. Albig W. Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Schwamborn K. Doenecke D. Go¨rlich D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Each of the two import receptors binds the histone weakly when tested individually, but the binding is strong for the Impβ-Imp7 heterodimer. Consistent with that, import of H1° into nuclei of permeabilized cells requires exogenous Impβ together with Imp7. Beside this extraordinary receptor requirement, H1 histones contain several NLS belonging to two structurally different types (8Schwamborn K. Albig W. Doenecke D. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 206-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). One type of topogenic sequence consists of clustered basic amino acids (termed NLS type 1) in the C-terminal domains of the H1 histones. The central globular portions of the histones represent a second type (termed NLS type 2) of nuclear localization signals. Fragments of these globular domains could not serve as nuclear localization signals. Therefore, we conclude that the NLS function of this portion of the histones requires information conferred by conformation of the globular domain. Based on this complexity, we analyzed the import routes of these two structurally different types of NLS and tried to characterize the import complex for H1 histones in more detail. To address whether the Impβ-Imp7 heterodimer is the only functional import receptor for H1 histones, we depleted reticulocyte lysate (retic*) of Impβ with immobilized IBB (importin beta-binding domain of importin α) and tested for its ability to target H1° into the nucleus. As shown in Fig. 1A, the untreated reticulocyte lysate (retic) imports H1° efficiently, resulting in an accumulation of labeled histone in the nucleoplasm and in nucleoli. Nucleolar staining may be due to a vast excess of H1° histones after import into the nuclei of the permeabilized cells, where they may bind to ectopic sites in the nucleus, perhaps as basic proteins to the ribosomal RNA accessible in the nucleolus. This nucleolar staining has been observed previously also with other proteins, for instance with core histones (10Baake M. Doenecke D. Albig W. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 25Mu¨hlha¨usser P. Muller E.C. Otto A. Kutay U. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 690-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and the parathyroid hormone-related protein (33Lam M.H. Briggs L.J., Hu, W. Martin T.J. Gillespie M.T. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7391-7398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In contrast to the nuclear import of H1° by the untreated reticulocyte lysate, a significant reduction in nuclear localization of the fluorescent H1° was observed with the Impβ-depleted lysate (retic*). Hence, the retic* has lost its import competence for H1°, apparently because of depletion of Impβ. Yet, as shown in Fig.1A, the import could only be restored when both Impβ and imp7 were added back to retic*, indicating that the IBB domain partly depleted the Impβ-Imp7 heterodimer. This conclusion was verified by immunoblotting (Fig. 1B). For a control, we used the ribosomal protein L23a. Nuclear import of L23a is achieved by any one of four import receptors (Impβ, Imp5, Imp7, and transportin) (14Ja¨kel S. Go¨rlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4491-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) and therefore does not depend exclusively on either Impβ or Imp7. Hence nuclear import of L23a should not be affected by Impβ-depleted reticulocyte lysate. As expected, in the presence of retic* nuclear import of L23a was clearly detectable. In conclusion, these data in combination with our previous results (9Ja¨kel S. Albig W. Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Schwamborn K. Doenecke D. Go¨rlich D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) suggest that there is only one functional import receptor for histone H1 in eukaryotic cells, namely the Impβ-Imp7 heterodimer. Because histone H1° (8Schwamborn K. Albig W. Doenecke D. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 206-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and H1.2 2M. Ba¨uerle, D. Doenecke, and W. Albig, unpublished data. contain multiple sequence elements for nuclear targeting, we wished to identify the import receptors that are functional for the individual NLS of H1 histones. First, we analyzed the different NLS in H1° histone for factor binding by in vitro binding experiments. For this purpose, we used affinity chromatography with immobilized histone H1° or fragments thereof, representing the different types of NLS. The histones or histone fragments were expressed as 2z fusion proteins for immobilization on IgG-Sepharose. Binding of proteins from rabbit reticulocyte lysate to the immobilized H1° NLS was performed in the absence or presence of RanQ69L(GTP) (Fig. 2). RanQ69L is a Ran mutant that is deficient in GTP hydrolysis and therefore only exists in the GTP-bound state. Binding of RanGTP to the import receptor-substrate complex leads to a dissociation of the complex and to a release of the import substrate (21Izaurralde E. Kutay U. von Kobbe C. Mattaj I.W. Go¨rlich D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6535-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) and therefore indicates specificity of receptor binding in this assay. The proteins retained by the histones in absence of RanQ69L, but whose binding was reduced in its presence, were candidate import receptors. Analysis of proteins in the bound fractions by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2) showed very similar patterns of bound import factors for the full-length histone H1° (aa 3–189), the globular domain (aa 21–95), and the C-terminal domain (aa 95–193) of H1° histone, and also for the IBB domain (the Impβ-binding domain of Impα) that is known to interact with importin β. The N-terminal domain of histone H1° (aa 1–20) does not bind any import receptor. Binding of Impβ and Imp7 was confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2, lower panel). Binding of the importins may be direct or could be mediated by association with other binding proteins of the reticulocyte lysate (other importins) as has been shown for binding of Imp7 to the IBB domain through interaction with bound Impβ (14Ja¨kel S. Go¨rlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4491-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). We could not test other import receptors because the appropriate antibodies were not available. Hence we cannot exclude, in this experiment, the possibility that importins other than Impβ or Imp7 may bind to the different NLS. Binding of the import receptors from the reticulocyte lysate did not yet prove direct interaction of the importins with the different H1° NLS. Because, for example, Impβ and Imp7 are able to form heterodimers (28Go¨rlich D. Dabrowski M. Bischoff F.R. Kutay U. Bork P. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Izaurralde E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 65-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), Impβ retained by the histone matrix can be bound by Imp7 and thus may incorrectly indicate the binding of Imp7 to the histone. To assess whether direct binding of Impβ and Imp7 occurs in vitro, we performed binding experiments with recombinant Impβ and Imp7. Moreover, because the preceding experiments do not rule out that other importins were recovered by H1° NLS, we additionally expressed two other import receptors, namely transportin (Trn1) and importin 5 (Imp5) in E. coli and used the purified recombinant proteins for the following bindin"
https://openalex.org/W2102885629,"Repeated within the intergenic spacers that separate adjacent ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes in Xenopus laevis are several distinct sequence elements. These include transcription terminators, “region 0” repeats, “region 1” repeats, duplicated spacer promoters, and 42-bp enhancer elements that are embedded within 60 or 81-bp repeats. All have been reported to stimulate RNA polymerase I transcription from an adjacent gene promoter. A greater number of 42-bp enhancers/gene have been suggested to explain the preferential transcription of X. laevis rRNA genes in X. laevis x Xenopus borealishybrids, an epigenetic phenomenon known as nucleolar dominance. However, the possible contribution of regions 0/1 and/or spacer promoters to the preferential transcription of X. laevis(over X. borealis) rRNA genes has never been tested directly. In this study, we systematically tested the various intergenic spacer elements for their contributions to promoter strength and nucleolar dominance-like competition in oocytes. In disagreement with a previous report, region 0 and region 1 repeats do not have significant enhancer activity, nor do they play a discernible role in X. laevis–X. borealis rRNA gene competition. Minigenes containing X. laevis spacer sequences are only dominant over minigenes having complete X. borealis spacers if a spacer promoter is located upstream of the 42-bp enhancers; X. laevis enhancers alone are not sufficient. These results provide additional evidence that spacer promoters together with adjacent enhancers form a functional activating unit in Xenopus oocytes.

In Xenopus as in other eukaryotes, RNA polymerase I is dedicated to the transcription of ribosomal RNA genes, producing a 40 S primary transcript that is then processed into the 18 S, 5.8 S, and 28 S RNAs found within cytoplasmic ribosomes (1Paule M.R. White R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1283-1298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Moss T. Stefanovsky V.Y. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol.

Biol. 1999; 62: 293-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). There are hundreds (sometimes thousands) of rRNA genes in eukaryotic genomes. These rRNA genes are tandemly arrayed in head-to-tail clusters that are known as nucleolus organizer regions because nucleoli, the sites of ribosome assembly, are formed at the loci where rRNA genes are actively transcribed (6McClintock B. Z. Zellforsch. Mikrosk. Anat. 1934; 21: 294-328Crossref Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 7Wallace H. Birnstiel M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 114: 296-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 8Scheer U. Weisenberger D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 9Shaw P.J. Jordan E.G. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 93-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Within the nucleolus organizer regions, adjacent rRNA genes are separated by an intergenic spacer that typically contains repetitive DNA sequences, some of which have defined roles in transcriptional regulation (10Reeder R.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 466-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Intergenic spacers of Xenopus laevis have been particularly well characterized (Fig. 1). In oocytes injected with plasmid minigenes, the 60- and 81-bp repeats located just upstream of the X. laevis rRNA gene promoter act as orientation- and distance-independent enhancers of transcription (11Labhart P. Reeder R.H. Cell. 1984; 37: 285-289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These elements are very similar, 81-bp repeats being 60-bp enhancers with an additional 21-bp extension (12Boseley P. Moss T. Machler M. Portmann R. Birnstiel M. Cell. 1979; 17: 19-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 13Moss T. Boseley P.G. Birnstiel M.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 467-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Within each 60/81-bp enhancer is a 42-bp sequence that is ∼80% identical to an upstream domain of the gene promoter (nucleotides −114 to −72 relative to the transcription start site, +1). A synthetic oligonucleotide corresponding to this upstream promoter region is sufficient for strong orientation-independent enhancer function (14Pikaard C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a core promoter domain (−20 to +15) lacking similarity to X. laevis spacer repeats but similar to a 44-bp repeated spacer element in Xenopus borealis (matching promoter sequences −22 to +22) (15Bach R. Allet B. Crippa M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 5311-5330Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 16Labhart P. Reeder R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 3623-3624Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) also displays enhancer activity in X. laevis oocytes (14Pikaard C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that the enhancers evolved from duplicated promoter domains that bind essential transcription factors. Injection into oocytes of a plasmid bearing only 60/81-bp enhancer repeats will inhibit transcription from a promoter on a second plasmid, consistent with the idea that enhancers and promoters bind one or more transcription factors in common (11Labhart P. Reeder R.H. Cell. 1984; 37: 285-289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Indeed, the transcription factor UBF (upstream binding factor) was identified and purified from Xenopus based on its ability to bind both the 60/81-bp enhancers and the promoter (17Dunaway M. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1768-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 18Pikaard C.S. McStay B. Schultz M.C. Bell S.P. Reeder R.H. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1779-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In X. laevis and X. borealisintergenic spacers, enhancer arrays are preceded by spacer promoters that share ∼90% identity with the gene promoter (see Fig.1) (19Moss T. Birnstiel M.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 3733-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Spacer promoters can program polymerase I transcription initiation, but their transcripts terminate upstream of the gene promoter at site T3 located at position −213 (20Moss T. Nature. 1983; 302: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar,21Labhart P. Reeder R.H. Cell. 1986; 45: 431-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). T3 is a “fail-safe” termination site in that it prevents spacer transcription from proceeding through the gene promoter. The function of spacer promoters in Xenopus is not entirely clear. The oocytes of most females display little or no spacer promoter activity with only rare individuals displaying significant numbers of spacer transcripts (22Morgan G.T. Reeder R.H. Bakken A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6490-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 23Morgan G.T. Roan J.G. Bakken A.H. Reeder R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 6043-6052Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, several studies have presented evidence that the full enhancer function of 60/81-bp repeats is only realized in oocytes if at least one spacer promoter is located upstream (24DeWinter R. Moss T. Cell. 1986; 44: 313-318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 25DeWinter R. Moss T. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 813-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The 5′ most portion of the intergenic spacer in X. laevis consists of 34- and 100-bp repeats known as region 0 and region 1, respectively (12Boseley P. Moss T. Machler M. Portmann R. Birnstiel M. Cell. 1979; 17: 19-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 13Moss T. Boseley P.G. Birnstiel M.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 467-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A study using X. laevisminigenes microinjected into X. borealis oocytes led to the conclusion that regions 0/1 are strong enhancers of transcription, perhaps even stronger than 60/81-bp repeats (26Mougey E.B. Pape L.K. Sollner-Webb B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27138-27145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These data combined with prior studies of 60/81-bp repeats and spacer promoters have collectively suggested that essentially all of the intergenic spacer serves to stimulate transcription from the downstream gene promoter. In many interspecific hybrids, the ribosomal RNA genes of only one parent are transcribed. This phenomenon is known as nucleolar dominance, because only transcribed (dominant) rRNA genes induce the formation of a nucleolus (27Pikaard C.S. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 43: 163-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Pikaard C.S. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 495-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Nucleolar dominance was first observed in plants (29Navashin M. Cytologia. 1934; 5: 169-203Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar) but also occurs in Xenopus (30Blackler A.W. Gecking C.A. Dev. Biol. 1972; 27: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 31Cassidy D.M. Blackler A.W. Dev. Biol. 1974; 41: 84-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and Drosophila (32Durica D.S. Krider H.M. Dev. Biol. 1977; 59: 62-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 33Durica D.S. Krider H.M. Genetics. 1978; 89: 37-64PubMed Google Scholar). When X. laevis and X. borealis are crossed to form a hybrid by in vitro fertilization, only the X. laevis rRNA genes are active in the embryos and young tadpoles (34Honjo T. Reeder R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Reeder and Roan (35Reeder R.H. Roan J.G. Cell. 1984; 38: 39-44Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (53) Google Scholar) showed that nucleolar dominance could be mimicked using X. laevis and X. borealisminigenes injected into oocytes. An X. laevis minigene with a complete intergenic spacer suppressed transcription from an analogousX. borealis minigene when both were co-injected intoX. borealis oocytes. The X. laevis and X. borealis promoters were shown to be indistinguishable in their activity; it was the intergenic spacer of X. laevis that conferred dominance. In one experiment, a construct bearing only a block of X. laevis 60/81-bp repeats upstream of the promoter suppressed transcription from a co-injected construct bearing a complete X. borealis spacer, leading the authors to conclude that these enhancer repeats whose 42-bp core sequence is more numerous in X. laevis than in X. borealis spacers were responsible for the phenomenon (35Reeder R.H. Roan J.G. Cell. 1984; 38: 39-44Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, in other experiments, only the constructs bearing a full X. laevisspacer showed dominance. One explanation favored by the authors (35Reeder R.H. Roan J.G. Cell. 1984; 38: 39-44Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (53) Google Scholar,36Reeder R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 2013-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) was that the full spacer simply had more of the 60/81-bp repeats. However, a role for spacer promoters and/or regions 0 and 1 has never been ruled out. The report that regions 0 and 1 possess strong enhancer activity (26Mougey E.B. Pape L.K. Sollner-Webb B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27138-27145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) in oocytes has underscored the need to re-investigate the sequences responsible for nucleolar dominance-like rRNA gene competition. In this report, we show that region 0 and region 1 repeats do not display significant enhancer activity and thus cannot withstand competition from 60/81-bp enhancer repeats in X. laevisoocytes. Likewise, region 0 and region 1 repeats play no detectable role in the preferential transcription of X. laevisspacer-containing minigenes competing with X. borealisminigenes in X. borealis oocytes. A full X. laevis spacer construct having two spacer promoters and two blocks of 60/81-bp elements or an internally deleted construct bearing only one spacer promoter and one block of 60/81-bp repeats is able to completely suppress transcription from a construct bearing a fullX. borealis spacer. In contrast, a construct bearing only one block of X. laevis 60/81-bp repeats upstream of the promoter shows only co-dominance. Collectively, these data suggest that a spacer promoter in addition to 60/81-bp enhancers is needed for nucleolar dominance-like minigene competition in oocytes. The results of this assay are consistent with those of the Moss laboratory that showed that a spacer promoter is needed for full enhancer function (24DeWinter R. Moss T. Cell. 1986; 44: 313-318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar,25DeWinter R. Moss T. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 813-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The minigenes Ψ40 and Ψ52 served as the foundations for all constructs tested. These minigenes described previously (11Labhart P. Reeder R.H. Cell. 1984; 37: 285-289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) have complete X. laevis promoters and sequences extending 5′ to −245, thus including the T3 terminator site. Shortly downstream of the transcription start site, sequences from the 3′ end of the gene are attached including the 3′-terminal 28 S coding sequences and flanking intergenic spacer sequences. Separating the promoter region and 28 S sequences are linkers whose size is slightly different in Ψ40 and Ψ52, allowing their transcripts to be distinguished from one another and from endogenous rRNA transcripts. The constructs whose number begins with “4” use the Ψ40 minigene body, whereas constructs that begin with “5” use the Ψ52 minigene body. Constructs Ψ401, Ψ409, Ψ4060-10, Ψ4081-10, Ψ52, and Ψ521 have been described previously (11Labhart P. Reeder R.H. Cell. 1984; 37: 285-289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 37Pikaard C.S. Reeder R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4282-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Ψ5281-10 is identical to Ψ4081-10 (37Pikaard C.S. Reeder R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4282-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) with the exception that the ten 81-bp repeats are attached to a Ψ52 minigene body rather than to a Ψ40 body. pbl1-52 is virtually identical to pbl1 described previously (35Reeder R.H. Roan J.G. Cell. 1984; 38: 39-44Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (53) Google Scholar) with the exception that the X. borealis spacer sequences have been attached to the Ψ52 minigene body rather than the Ψ40 minigene body. Construct Ψ411 contains a 1.6-kb intergenic spacer fragment including region 0 and region 1 fused to a Ψ40 minigene body. Ψ411 was engineered by digesting Ψ409 with SalI and BamHI (near the 5′ end of the most upstream spacer promoter) isolating the 1.6-kb fragment, attaching aBamHI-XhoI adapter, and ligating the resultingSalI-XhoI fragment into the SalI site located at position −245 of Ψ40. The orientation of the inserted sequences relative to the promoter is reversed in Ψ411B. Construct Ψ411-01 had the 1600-bp spacer fragment of construct Ψ411 inserted into Ψ401 at the SalI site located just 5′ of the 60/81-bp enhancer block. Ψ410 was created from Ψ409 by partialBamHI digestion to cut at the homologous BamHI site within the two spacer promoters followed by re-ligation, thus deleting one spacer promoter and one 60/81-bp enhancer block. X. laevis and X. borealis females were obtained from Nasco International. Thirty oocytes (stages V and VI) were subjected to centrifugation for 5 min at 30 × g to cause the nucleus to become localized at the top of the oocyte. Injection mixes consisted of 500 pg of test construct, an equimolar concentration of its competitor minigene, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA and 500 μg/ml α-amanitin (added to inhibit transcription by RNA polymerases II and III, Sigma). With the aid of a dissecting microscope, minigenes were co-injected directly into each nucleus in a total volume of 40 nl. Injection needles were formed from 5-μl glass capillary tubes drawn to a fine point using a pipette puller (David Kopf Instruments). After incubation overnight at room temperature, oocytes were pooled and homogenized in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.6),1 mg/ml proteinase K, and 1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate. Following protease digestion for 1 h at 37 °C, the homogenate was extracted sequentially with 1 volume of phenol, 1 volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1 v/v/v), and 1 volume of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1 v/v). Sodium acetate was added to the aqueous phase to a final concentration of 0.3 m, and nucleic acids were precipitated by the addition of 2.5 volumes of absolute ethanol. Pellets were collected by centrifugation, washed once with 70% ethanol, and air-dried. Pellets were resuspended in sterile water using 10 μl/oocyte and frozen for subsequent S1 analysis. DNA probes for S1 nuclease analysis were prepared by digesting the Ψ40 or Ψ52 minigenes withBamHI, which cuts at +40 or +52 relative to the transcription start site. Following dephosphorylation with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase, 5′ ends were labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP using standard protocols (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The plasmids were then digested with SalI, which cuts at −245. Labeled antisense single-stranded probe fragments were purified from strand-separating gels according to standard protocols (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and co-precipitated with RNA (3–5 oocyte equivalents). RNA/probe pellets were resuspended in 30 μl of 300 mmNaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 1 mm EDTA and overlaid with mineral oil. After brief denaturation at 95 °C, hybridization was at 65 °C overnight. Reactions were placed on ice, and 270 μl of S1 nuclease digestion buffer (5% glycerol, 1 mm ZnSO4, 30 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.5), 50 mm NaCl, and 130 units/ml S1 nuclease (Sigma)) was added. S1 digestion was for 30 min at 37 °C. Digestion reactions were stopped by removing 280 μl from the bottom of the tubes (to avoid the mineral oil at the top) to a fresh tube containing 30 μl of 7.5m ammonium acetate, 5 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, and 3.3 μg of yeast tRNA. After mixing, 1 ml of cold (−20 °C) absolute ethanol was added to precipitate nucleic acids. Following centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min, pellets were washed with 70% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in formamide-containing loading buffer supplemented with 10 mmNaOH to degrade any RNA. S1 digestion products were subjected to electrophoresis on a 6% denaturing urea-polyacrylamide gel. Following electrophoresis, gels were transferred onto filter paper and dried using a vacuum gel dryer. Radioactive S1 digestion products were visualized following exposure of dried gels to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Autoradiogram band intensities were estimated using a Umax 1100 scanner and ImageJ software (version 1.27, Wayne Rasband, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, MD). X-ray film was not pre-flashed prior to autoradiography. The basic design for all experiments was to co-inject equimolar amounts of two plasmids whose transcripts can be differentiated by S1 nuclease protection. Under such a competitive situation, intergenic spacer sequences with stimulatory activity provide an advantage to an adjacent promoter (11Labhart P. Reeder R.H. Cell. 1984; 37: 285-289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 20Moss T. Nature. 1983; 302: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 24DeWinter R. Moss T.

In some experiments, enhancers cause stimulation of the adjacent promoter (cis-effect) but have little effect on the transcription of the competing minigene intrans. In other batches of oocytes, enhancer effects are displayed primarily by reducing transcription from the competing plasmid (trans- effect only) rather than stimulating the adjacent promoter. Most commonly, a combination of cis- and trans-effects is observed. Regardless of whether a given batch of oocytes displays primarily cis- ortrans-effects, the ratio of test construct transcripts to competitor transcripts is highly reproducible (37Pikaard C.S. Reeder R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4282-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, the competition assay allows for reliable comparisons of co-injected minigenes. Just upstream of the gene promoter and T3 terminator in the X. laevis rRNA gene intergenic spacer is a cluster of ten, mostly alternating 60- or 81-bp repeated elements, each of which includes a 42-bp core sequence shared by the promoter. The equivalence of the 60/81-bp elements as enhancers is demonstrated in Fig.2. In Fig. 2 and in all of the figures shown, each pair of lanes corresponds to a single co-injection in which one construct is built using the Ψ40 minigene body and the competing construct uses the Ψ52 minigene body. RNA isolated from the injected oocytes is then split into two equal aliquots, one of which is hybridized to a Ψ40-specific probe (odd numbered lanes) and the other is hybridized to the Ψ52-specific probe (even numbered lanes). When Ψ40 and Ψ52 minigenes are co-injected, both support comparable levels of transcription (compare lane 1 with 2), although Ψ40 signals are ∼1.6-fold stronger because of higher specific activity of the Ψ40 probe (true in all of our experiments). To facilitate a comparison with other injected minigene pairs, the ratio of Ψ40 to Ψ52 signals inlanes 1 and 2 was defined as 1.0, and all subsequent injection signal ratios were normalized accordingly. Minigene Ψ401 has a wild-type block of 60/81-bp elements upstream of the Ψ40 minigene body. When Ψ401 is co-injected with Ψ52, Ψ401 is preferentially transcribed by >10-fold, such that transcription from Ψ52 is almost undetectable (compare lane 3 with4). Note that the extremely weak signal from the Ψ52 plasmid in lane 4 (also in lanes 6 and 8 and in similar lanes in other figures) precluded the calculation of a precise transcription ratio. Ψ4060-10 has 10 complete 60-bp enhancers cloned as a polymerized array with a 65-bp periodicity upstream of the Ψ40 minigene body (37Pikaard C.S. Reeder R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4282-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). When co-injected with Ψ52, Ψ4060-10 is preferentially transcribed by >10-fold (compare lane 5 with 6), mirroring the results obtained using Ψ401 (lanes 3 and 4). A similar result is observed following the co-injection of Ψ4081-10 and Ψ52 (lanes 7 and 8, transcription ratio is >10). Ψ4081-10 contains ten slightly truncated 81-bp elements polymerized as 76-mers (37Pikaard C.S. Reeder R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4282-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Collectively, the results of lanes 1–8suggest that cloned 60- or 81-bp repeats with different periodicities still retain the enhancer function of a wild-type 60/81-bp enhancer block, in agreement with prior results (37Pikaard C.S. Reeder R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4282-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The addition of ten 60- or 81-bp enhancers to Ψ52 (constructs Ψ5260-10 and Ψ5281-10) counteracts the competitive advantage of Ψ4060-10 or Ψ4081-10, making Ψ52 minigene body transcripts readily detectable (comparelanes 9 with 10 and 11 with12). However, an unexplained 2-fold bias in favor of the Ψ40 minigene body (in addition to the 1.6-fold higher specific activity of the Ψ40 probe) is apparent in lanes 9 and 11 regardless of whether 60- or 81-bp repeats are located incis. The latter bias was not apparent in other repetitions of this experiment (data not shown). A fragment containing both region 0 and region 1 has been reported to possess strong enhancer activity in X. borealis oocytes (26Mougey E.B. Pape L.K. Sollner-Webb B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27138-27145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Using X. laevis oocytes, we conducted similar tests of regions 0 and 1 in competition with enhancer-less and enhancer-bearing minigenes. In most experiments, we observed no competitive advantage of Ψ411 or Ψ411B over a co-injected Ψ52 minigene, but in some batches of oocytes, there was a discernible stimulatory effect. Fig.3 shows one of the latter experiments. In this experiment, Ψ40 and Ψ52 programmed comparable levels of transcription when in competition with one another (compare lane 1 with 2, again the specific activity of the Ψ40 probe was ∼1.6-fold higher). Constructs Ψ411 and Ψ411B have the 5′ end of the intergenic spacer including T2, region 0 repeats, and region 1 repeats cloned in both orientations upstream of the Ψ40 minigene. Both Ψ411 and Ψ411B out-performed a co-injected Ψ52 minigene ∼2–2.5:1 (compare lanes 3 with4 and 5 with 6). However, the Ψ411 and Ψ411B constructs were out-competed ∼6:1 or 10:1, respectively, by Ψ521, a Ψ52 minigene with a block of ten 60/81-bp enhancers (compare lanes 7 with 8 and 9 with10). In fact, Ψ411 and Ψ411B fared no better in competition with Ψ521 than did Ψ40 (compare lanes 7–10with 11 and 12). We conclude that region 0 and region 1 repeats have only weak enhancer activity in X. laevis. This conclusion was further supported by testing a variety of deletion derivatives of Ψ411 in which the relative contributions of region 0 repeats and region 1 repeats could be evaluated (data not shown). No cryptic enhancer activity was uncovered among the latter deletion constructs. The possibility that regions 0 and 1 might increase the enhancer strength of 60/81-bp repeats in X. laevis oocytes was examined using a variety of constructs having natural and engineered arrangements of intergenic spacer elements (Fig.4). Ψ52, which lacks enhancers, was co-injected with eight different test constructs built on a Ψ40 minigene body. Following co-injection of Ψ40 and Ψ52, transcripts from both minigenes were readily detected (lanes 1 and 2). The addition of a block of 60/81-bp repeats to the Ψ40 minigene (construct Ψ401) results in a strongtrans-competition effect (7-fold), such that Ψ52 transcripts are only barely detectable (lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, construct Ψ411 containing regions 0 and 1 upstream of the Ψ40 gene promoter has no competitive advantage over Ψ52 in this experiment (lanes 5 and 6). Constructs Ψ411-01 and Ψ411-01B have regions 0 and 1 in natural and reversed orientation, respectively, inserted upstream of a block of 60/81-bp repeats (see lanes 7–10). Thus, Ψ411-01 has all of the classes of repeats found in the wild-type spacer with the sole exception of a spacer promoter(s). The Ψ411−01 constructs out-compete the enhancer-less Ψ52 minigene 7:1 (lanes 7–10) similar to Ψ401 (lanes 3 and 4), suggesting that regions 0 and 1 contribute nothing discernible to the enhancer strength of a single 60/81-bp enhancer block. One possibility is that the region 0/1 repeats are too far removed from the promoter to be effective in the Ψ411−01 constructs. To test this possibility, we added a block of ten 60-bp enhancers (same used in construct Ψ4060−10) to Ψ411, such that the enhancers were upstream of T2 and regions 0 and 1. This construct, ΨEN-411 was still able to out-compete a Ψ52 minigene 6:1 (lanes 11 and 12) similar to Ψ401 (lanes 3 and 4), suggesting that 60/81-bp enhancers remain functional when moved an additional 1.6-kb upstream of the promoter. Finally, we tested two constructs, Ψ410 and Ψ409, that had regions 0 and region 1, spacer promoters, and 60/81-bp repeats, all in their normal orientation relative to one another (lanes 13–16). Ψ410 and Ψ409 suppressed all transcription from the competing Ψ52 minigene (seelanes"

Autophosphorylation of this residue is associated with activation of type I PKGs. To determine the role of this conserved serine, point mutations have been made in PKG-Iα (S64A, S64T, S64D, and S64N) and PKG-Iβ (S79A). In wild-type PKG-Iα, basal kinase activity ratio (−cGMP/+cGMP) is 0.11, autophosphorylation increases this ratio 3-fold, and theKa and KD values for cGMP are 127 and 36 nm, respectively. S64A PKG-Iα basal kinase activity ratio increases 2-fold, cGMP binding affinity increases ∼10-fold in both Ka and KD, and activation by autophosphorylation is slight. S64D and S64N mutants are nearly constitutively active in the absence of cGMP, cGMP binding affinity in each increases 18-fold, and autophosphorylation does not affect the kinase activity of these mutants. Mutation of the homologous site in PKG-Iβ (S79A) increases the basal kinase activity ratio 2-fold and cGMP binding affinity 5-fold over that of wild-type PKG-Iβ.

This region of variable sequence includes the autoinhibitory domain and the autophosphorylation sites, which impart distinct functional characteristics to the kinases. The autoinhibitory domain contains a sequence that mimics the substrate sequence ((R/K)(R/K) X(S/T)X) except that an alanine instead of a phosphorylatable serine or threonine is located at P0, the position of phosphorylation. Thus, the sequence is referred to as a pseudosubstrate site. Interactions involving residues in the pseudosubstrate site have been demonstrated to be important in maintaining these kinases in an inactive state, and it has been proposed that this simulates interaction of this sequence with the substrate-binding site in the catalytic domain (11Lincoln T.M. Flockhart D.A. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6002-6009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Landgraf W. Hofmann F. Eur. J.

Removal of the pseudosubstrate site by proteolysis relieves much of the autoinhibition (13Francis S.H. Smith J.A. Colbran J.L. Grimes K. Walsh K.A. Kumar S. Corbin J.D. J. Biol.

However, the contributions of specific residues outside the pseudosubstrate site have not been identified previously.As is typical of many protein kinases, PKG-I autoinhibition is relieved, i.e. PKG-I is activated, by either ligand binding or autophosphorylation. Cyclic GMP binding increases both heterophosphorylation 2The term heterophosphorylation is derived in part from the Greek heteros (other, different), which is compared with the Greek autos (self).

Autophosphorylation of PKG-I in vitro increases its cGMP-binding affinity and kinase activity measured in the absence of cGMP.

Studies of PKG-Iα autophosphorylation have shown that Thr58 is autophosphorylated at a faster rate than are the other sites. However, PKG-Iα Thr58 autophosphorylation is not sufficient to activate the enzyme (21Aitken A. Hemmings B.A. Hofmann F. Biochim. Biophys.

Similarly, studies using PKG-Iβ show that even though PKG-Iβ Ser63 is autophosphorylated at a faster rate than is Ser79, Ser63 autophosphorylation is not sufficient to activate the enzyme; autophosphorylation of Ser79 is required for this effect (22Smith J.A.

PKG-Iα Ser64 is homologous to PKG-Iβ Ser79 (see Fig. 1).Most studies of the autoinhibitory domains of PKA and PKG have centered on the function of residues located within pseudosubstrate sequence that corresponds to the widely accepted consensus substrate sequence (RRXSX) of these kinases. It can be seen that PKG-Iα Ser64 and PKG-Iβ Ser79 lie immediately carboxyl-terminal to the pseudosubstrate sequences (-59RAQGI- and -74KRQAI-, respectively) and that this residue is conserved among all known PKGs and in PKG regulatory subunits of PKA. The role of this residue in enzyme function has not been previously studied. In the present study, therefore, PKG-Iα Ser64 has been mutated by PCR site-directed mutagenesis, and the kinase activities and cGMP binding affinities of the recombinant S64A, S64T, S64D, and S64N mutants have been determined. The corresponding residue in PKG-Iβ, Ser79, has also been replaced through point mutation, and the kinase activities and cGMP binding affinities of S79A have been determined. Our results demonstrate that Ser64 and Ser79 play key roles in maintaining PKG-Iα and PKG-Iβ, respectively, in an inactive state and in reducing cGMP binding affinity of the enzymes. This conserved serine is the first residue outside the pseudosubstrate sequence that has been shown to potently affect autoinhibition in PKGs.

Although the amino acid sequences of their cGMP-binding sites and catalytic domains are identical, the variants share only 36% homology in their 88 and 103 amino-terminal residues, respectively (1Reed R.B.

This region of variable sequence includes the autoinhibitory domain and the autophosphorylation sites, which impart distinct functional characteristics to the kinases. The autoinhibitory domain contains a sequence that mimics the substrate sequence ((R/K)(R/K) X(S/T)X) except that an alanine instead of a phosphorylatable serine or threonine is located at P0, the position of phosphorylation. Thus, the sequence is referred to as a pseudosubstrate site. Interactions involving residues in the pseudosubstrate site have been demonstrated to be important in maintaining these kinases in an inactive state, and it has been proposed that this simulates interaction of this sequence with the substrate-binding site in the catalytic domain (11Lincoln T.M. Flockhart D.A. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6002-6009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Landgraf W. Hofmann F. Eur. J.

Removal of the pseudosubstrate site by proteolysis relieves much of the autoinhibition (13Francis S.H. Smith J.A. Colbran J.L. Grimes K. Walsh K.A. Kumar S. Corbin J.D. J. Biol.

Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA1997: 219-235Google Scholar). However, the contributions of specific residues outside the pseudosubstrate site have not been identified previously. As is typical of many protein kinases, PKG-I autoinhibition is relieved, i.e. PKG-I is activated, by either ligand binding or autophosphorylation. Cyclic GMP binding increases both heterophosphorylation 2The term heterophosphorylation is derived in part from the Greek heteros (other, different), which is compared with the Greek autos (self). Thus, heterophosphorylation refers to phosphorylation of proteins, peptides, or substances other than the kinase itself or a subunit(s) of the kinase itself. The terms heterophosphorylation and autophosphorylation are related in the same way as heterophagy and autophagy.2The term heterophosphorylation is derived in part from the Greek heteros (other, different), which is compared with the Greek autos (self).

Autophosphorylation of PKG-I in vitro increases its cGMP-binding affinity and kinase activity measured in the absence of cGMP. Both cGMP binding and autophosphorylation cause a conformational change (16Zhao J. Trewhella J. Corbin J. Francis S. Mitchell R. Brushia R. Walsh D. J. Biol.

Sites of autophosphorylation in both PKG-Iα and PKG-Iβ have been identified. These include Ser1, Ser50, Thr58, Ser64, Ser72, and Thr84 in PKG-Iα (19Monken C.E. Gill G.N. J. Biol.

Studies of PKG-Iα autophosphorylation have shown that Thr58 is autophosphorylated at a faster rate than are the other sites. However, PKG-Iα Thr58 autophosphorylation is not sufficient to activate the enzyme (21Aitken A. Hemmings B.A. Hofmann F. Biochim. Biophys.

Similarly, studies using PKG-Iβ show that even though PKG-Iβ Ser63 is autophosphorylated at a faster rate than is Ser79, Ser63 autophosphorylation is not sufficient to activate the enzyme; autophosphorylation of Ser79 is required for this effect (22Smith J.A. Francis S.H. Walsh K.A. Kumar S. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20756-20762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). PKG-Iα Ser64 is homologous to PKG-Iβ Ser79 (see Fig. 1). Most studies of the autoinhibitory domains of PKA and PKG have centered on the function of residues located within pseudosubstrate sequence that corresponds to the widely accepted consensus substrate sequence (RRXSX) of these kinases. It can be seen that PKG-Iα Ser64 and PKG-Iβ Ser79 lie immediately carboxyl-terminal to the pseudosubstrate sequences (-59RAQGI- and -74KRQAI-, respectively) and that this residue is conserved among all known PKGs and in PKG regulatory subunits of PKA. The role of this residue in enzyme function has not been previously studied. In the present study, therefore, PKG-Iα Ser64 has been mutated by PCR site-directed mutagenesis, and the kinase activities and cGMP binding affinities of the recombinant S64A, S64T, S64D, and S64N mutants have been determined. The corresponding residue in PKG-Iβ, Ser79, has also been replaced through point mutation, and the kinase activities and cGMP binding affinities of S79A have been determined. Our results demonstrate that Ser64 and Ser79 play key roles in maintaining PKG-Iα and PKG-Iβ, respectively, in an inactive state and in reducing cGMP binding affinity of the enzymes. This conserved serine is the first residue outside the pseudosubstrate sequence that has been shown to potently affect autoinhibition in PKGs.

Van der Saag P.T. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 13-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). It is a glycosylated transmembrane protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily and possesses five extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains (2Staunton D.E. Marlin S.D. Stratowa C. Dustin M.L.

Although under physiologic conditions ICAM-1 is expressed on only a few cell types including vascular endothelial cells, it is induced on many other cells by cytokine-like tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-1, or IFN-γ (4Dustin M.L.

Binding of up-regulated ICAM-1 to its ligands on leukocytes, the integrins LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18) or Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18), is involved in several immunologic events that are pivotal in the establishment of inflammatory responses, especially in leukocyte extravasation, target cell lysis by cytotoxic T cells, or antigen presentation to T cells (1Van de Stolpe A. Van der Saag P.T. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 13-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 8Springer T. Nature. 1990; 346: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (5852) Google Scholar). ICAM-1 contributes to the adhesion between leukocytes and endothelial cells and thus, plays a role in ischemia/reperfusion injury (9Bevilacqua M.P. Nelson R.M. Mannori G. Cecconi O. Annu. Rev. Med. 1994; 45: 361-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). In addition, it may also facilitate the establishment or progression of certain infections, such as rhinovirus infections (1Van de Stolpe A. Van der Saag P.T. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 13-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Thus, the inhibition of ICAM-1 has become an attractive pharmacologic concept. It is being evaluated, using monoclonal anti-ICAM-1 antibodies or ICAM-1 antisense oligonucleotides, for the treatment of inflammatory diseases (e.g. Crohn’s disease or psoriasis vulgaris) and in transplantation research for the prolongation of graft survival and reduction of ischemia/reperfusion injury (10Stepkowski S.M.

The specific interference with gene expression has wide-ranging applications in experimental biology and is an attractive approach to the development of therapeutics. Several gene-specific inhibitory strategies have been established. Among the most advanced technologies are antisense oligonucleotides, which operate at a post-transcriptional level via binding to specific sequences in RNAs (13Lebedeva I. Stein C.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 403-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). As an alternative to this approach, gene expression may be modulated at an earlier stage, at the level of transcription, by molecules that specifically interact with the DNA double helix (14Giovannangeli C. Heálène C. Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther. 2000; 2: 288-296PubMed Google Scholar). Among them, triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) bind in the major groove of the double helix via Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds between oligonucleotide bases and purine bases in the DNA target that are already engaged in Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds. Such binding can occur at sequences containing a stretch of pyrimidines on one DNA strand and complementary purines on the other DNA strand (oligopyrimidine-oligopurine sequences). Depending on their base composition, TFOs bind in a parallel or antiparallel orientation to the purine-containing strand (15Thuong N.T. Heálène C. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1993; 32: 666-690Crossref Scopus (712) Google Scholar). A number of studies have reported TFO-associated activities in cell culture experiments including the modulation of gene expression and the induction of genomic modifications at selected sites (16Faria M. Giovannangeli C. J. Gene Med. 2001; 3: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Triplex-mediated inhibition of transcription may be achieved by interfering with transcription initiation (competition of TFOs with transcription factors at the promoter) or by interfering with transcription elongation (RNA synthesis arrest at triplex structures). The arrest of RNA synthesis in cells has been only recently described, and a limited number of studies are presently available for plasmid-harbored genes (17Faria M. Wood C.D. White M.R. Heálène C. Giovannangeli C. J. Mol. Med. 2001; 306: 15-24Google Scholar, 18Bailey C. Weeks D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1154-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) or integrated foreign sequences (19Faria M. Wood C.D. Perrouault L. Nelson J.S. Winter A. White M.R. Heálène C. Giovannangeli C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3862-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In addition to the inhibition of transcription, the possibility of forming specific and stable complexes at selected genomic sites might induce drastic cellular responses such as modifications of cell cycle checkpoints, especially in malignant cells (20Takebayashi Y. Pourquier P. Zimonjic D.B. Nakayama K. Emmert S. Ueda T. Urasaki Y. Kanzaki A. Akiyama S.I. Popescu N. Kraemer K.H. Pommier Y. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The demonstration of triplex formation at a targeted chromosomal locus is an important step to confirm the oligonucleotide mode of action. Accessibility of chromosomal target sequences for triplex-forming oligonucleotides within the cellular context has been demonstrated in different experimental systems: (i) by direct detection of specific binding of the triplex-forming oligonucleotide using either competitive PCR or restriction enzyme protection assays (21Giovannangeli C. Diviacco S. Labrousse V. Gryaznov S. Charneau P. Heálène C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) or primer extension assays (22Belousov E.S. Afonina I.A. Kutyavin I.V. Gall A.A. Reed M.W. Gamper H.B. Wydro R.M. Meyer R.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1324-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 23Oh D.H. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4734-4742Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and (ii) by indirect data with the detection of site-specific genomic modifications caused by triplex-forming oligonucleotides in cells (24Vasquez K.M. Wang G. Havre P.A. Glazer P.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1176-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 25Vasquez K.M. Dagle J.M. Weeks D.L. Glazer P.M. J. Biol.

Science. 2000; 290: 530-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). There is, however, only one study demonstrating both chromosomal binding of TFO and an associated biologic activity in cells (19Faria M. Wood C.D. Perrouault L. Nelson J.S. Winter A. White M.R. Heálène C. Giovannangeli C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3862-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), an observation that was made with a chromosomally integrated foreign gene. In this study, we present the characterization of a TFO that inhibits ICAM-1 expression in a sequence- and gene-specific manner. In addition, we demonstrate the TFO binding to its target sequence within its nuclear chromosomal organization using a newly established method. This is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of in situbinding of an inhibiting TFO that targets an endogenous gene. These results raise the possibility that TFOs may be used in cells as high affinity specific DNA ligands, especially for gene-directed arrest of transcription elongation. The triplex-forming oligonucleotide, TFOgt, and control oligonucleotides, COgt1 and COgt2, were obtained from Qbiogene (Heidelberg, Germany); sequences are displayed in Fig. 1. Either 3′ ends (TFOgt and COgt1) or 5′ ends (COgt2) were modified with 4,5′-8-trimethylpsoralen via a six-carbon linker. Ends that were not psoralen-modified were conjugated to biotin (to be used in magnetic capture assays) or to triethyleneglycol (to prevent nuclease-mediated degradation). A 5′-fluoresceinated TFOgt was used for microscopy. Oligonucleotides for PCR were obtained from Metabion (Munich, Germany). UVA was applied with a PUVA 200 light arch (Waldmann, Villingen-Schwenningen, Germany) with F8T5 PUVA bulbs, whose emission spectrum is mainly between 315 and 365 nm. Irradiation was done at room temperature through window glass to eliminate traces of UVB. The irradiation dose delivered to the samples was determined by a UV meter (Waldmann), and the fluence was 2 milliwatts/cm2 at a 19 cm source-to-target distance. Specific triplex formation was evaluated in vitro in a restriction enzyme protection assay. The 16-bp ICAM-1 target sequence was included in a 28-bp sequence to create an EcoNI recognition site that overlaps with the 16-bp oligopyrimidine-oligopurine ICAM-1 target sequence (see Fig. 2A). This sequence was inserted into a 4.5-kb plasmid that had been constructed from the vectors pCAT-BasicTM and pSV-β GalTM (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). 2 μg (0.66 pmol) of plasmid DNA were incubated with increasing amounts of oligonucleotides for 90 min at 37 °C in 10 μl of a triplex-forming buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5; 10 mm MgCl2; 1 mmspermidine). Reactions were UVA-irradiated (5 J/cm2) to allow photoadduct formation between the psoralen moiety of the oligonucleotide and the ICAM-1 DNA sequence. Plasmid DNA was purified prior to restriction enzyme analysis with EcoNI andEcoRI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) at 37 °C overnight. DNA purification (and thus psoralen/UVA-mediated cross-linking) was necessary prior to restriction enzyme digest because the triplex-forming buffer interferes with EcoNI enzyme cleavage. The extent of inhibition of EcoNI cleavage by triplex-mediated photoadducts was assessed by gel electrophoresis and quantitated densitometrically (GelDoc system, Bio-Rad). Triplex formation was additionally analyzed in mobility shift assays. A 23-bp double-stranded DNA fragment representing the ICAM-1 target locus containing the 16-bp oligopyrimidine-oligopurine sequence (see Fig. 1) was produced by annealing equimolar amounts of complementary single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides. Both 3′ ends were labeled with digoxigenin (DIG Gel Shift kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 30 fmol of labeled target DNA were incubated with 1 μm TFOgt or COgt1 in 10 μl of triplex-forming buffer. After incubation for 90 min at 37 °C, samples were either not irradiated or irradiated with various UVA doses. TFOs bound to the target duplex during irradiation were covalently linked to the duplex via psoralen/UVA photoreactions, and covalent complexes were assessed as mobility shifts by denaturing gel electrophoresis (16% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 murea; 10% glycerine in 44.5 mm Tris; 44.5 mmboric acid; 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.3). Genomic DNA isolated from A431 cells was digested with PstI (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and purified. PstI digestion results in an 825-bp ICAM-1 fragment containing the triplex target sequence. 2 μg of genomic DNA were incubated with 10 μm of various oligonucleotides (biotinylated or non-biotinylated TFOgt, biotinylated COgt1) in 10-μl triplex-forming buffer for 90 min at 37 °C. Biotinylated COgt1 and non-biotinylated TFOgt oligonucleotides were used as controls. UVA irradiation (5 J/cm2) was performed to allow photoadduct formation. Oligonucleotide bound to the ICAM-1 target sequence was separated from unbound oligonucleotide by agarose gel electrophoresis because unbound oligonucleotide would compete with target-bound oligonucleotide for streptavidin on magnetic beads. After gel purification, aliquots of each sample were: (i) saved for control of successful gel extraction of the 825-bp ICAM-1 target fragment (named “before capture” portion) and (ii) subjected to magnetic separation (named “after capture” portion). Nuclei were prepared by incubation of 3 × 106 A431 cells in a buffer containing 0.32 m sucrose; 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5; 5 mm MgCl2; and 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min on ice. Nuclei were then washed in the same buffer, transferred to the triplex-forming buffer, incubated with 10 μm of various oligonucleotides for 90 min at 37 °C in a 100-μl reaction volume with gentle resuspension to avoid sedimentation of nuclei, and UVA-irradiated (5 J/cm2). The integrity of nuclei was checked microscopically. DNA was then prepared, digested with PstI, gel-isolated, and subjected to further analysis. To reduce unspecific DNA binding to magnetic beads (Dynabeads, Dynal, Hamburg, Germany), beads were preincubated with salmon testes DNA (5 μg/μl, Sigma) in 2 m LiCl for 1 h at 37 °C. 10 μg of magnetic beads were then incubated with 2 μg of DNA in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 2 m LiCl and 2 μg/μl salmon testes DNA for 30 min at 37 °C. Separation was carried out with a magnetic separator (MPC-E, Dynal) for 2 min. To remove any non-biotinylated DNA fragments from the beads, three washes with 300 μl of redistilled water were performed for 5 min at 60 °C. Beads were subsequently resuspended in 50 μl of redistilled water, and an aliquot was subjected to PCR. Amplification was carried out using primers P1 and P2 (250 nm; P1, 5′-GAACTGGCACCCCTCCCCTCTT-3′ and P2, 5′-CCGGGGCCACACCCATCTCAAA-3′) specific for a 388-bp portion of the 825-bp PstI ICAM-1 fragment. Reaction conditions were: 1.0 mm MgCl2, 1.5 units of Taqpolymerase (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany), 32 cycles with 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 63 °C, 30 s at 72 °C. For a more accurate assessment of triplex formation, captured DNA was subjected to semiquantitative real-time PCR based on fluorescence detection of amplified double-stranded DNA in the LightCyclerTM system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). An aliquot of resuspended beads harboring captured DNA was subjected to a 10-cycle conventional PCR with primers P3 and P4 (250 nm; P3, 5′-CCAACCTCACCGTGGTGCTGCT-3′ and P4, 5′-CCCACCTTCTCCCTGCTGGCTT-3′), which amplify a 220-bp fragment within the 825-bp ICAM-1 fragment. PCR conditions were 1 mm MgCl2, 60 s at 94 °C, 60 s at 63 °C, 90 s at 72 °C. PCR amplificates were purified (PCR purification kit, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) to remove beads because they interfere with fluorescence detection of PCR products. Aliquots were then analyzed by real-time PCR in a LightCyclerTM apparatus using the FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for fluorescence detection of PCR products. PCR conditions were: 500 nm of primers P3 and P4, 2 mm MgCl2, 35 cycles with 15 s at 95 °C, 10 s at 63 °C, 15 s at 72 °C, 15 s at 84 °C. The last temperature step was implemented to reduce fluorescence produced by primer dimers. Specific amplification of the 220-bp fragment was controlled by melting curve analysis (27Ririe K.M. Rasmussen R.P. Wittwer C.T. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 245: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar) and also by gel electrophoresis. The human squameous cell carcinoma-derived cell line A431 was from American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 μg/ml amphotericin B (all from Invitrogen), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (ccpro, Neustadt, Germany) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were used at subconfluency and kept in serum-free medium during experiments. UVA irradiation of cells (2 J/cm2) was done in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature. After irradiation, cells were provided with fresh serum-free medium and further incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Non-irradiated cells were removed from the incubator during irradiation procedures but kept from UVA exposure. To increase ICAM-1 transcription, A431 cells were treated by IFN-γ (500 units/ml; Amersham Biosciences) as indicated. A431 cells were transfected with oligonucleotides using SuperfectTM(cationic-activated dendrimer, Qiagen). Various amounts of TFO were mixed with a fixed amount of SuperfectTM (10 μl) in a total volume of 400 μl of serum-free medium without antibiotics/antimycotics. After a 10-min incubation at room temperature, the transfection mixture was diluted with serum-free medium to 1 ml, added to cells at 70% confluency (∼300,000 cells/3-cm well), and cells were incubated for 4 h. In experiments in which cellular oligonucleotide uptake was investigated, cells were transfected with fluorescein-conjugated TFOgt, and transfection efficiency was assessed (i) by flow cytometry analysis to evaluate the proportion of fluorescent cells and (ii) by fluorescence microscopy (Axioskop, Zeiss, Jena, Germany) to determine the cellular localization of the fluorescence. In experiments aimed at determining the effect of the triplex-forming oligonucleotide on expression of cell surface molecules, cells were transfected with oligonucleotides, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and irradiated as indicated. After irradiation, phosphate-buffered saline was replaced with serum-free medium, and IFN-γ was added or not (500 units/ml). Expression of cell surface molecules was analyzed by flow cytometry 16 h after transfection. ICAM-1 and HLA-DR cell surface expressions were assessed by a one-step staining procedure and subsequent flow cytometry (FACS analysis). Cells were incubated with an fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled murine anti-human ICAM-1 monoclonal antibody (MedSystems, Vienna, Austria) and/or with a R-phycoerythrin-coupled murine anti-human HLA-DR monoclonal antibody (BD PharMingen). Control stainings for ICAM-1 were performed with an fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled isotype-matched control monoclonal antibody (mouse IgG1, Beckmann Coulter), and control stainings for HLA-DR were performed with a R-phycoerythrin-coupled isotype-matched control monoclonal antibody (mouse IgG1, BD PharMingen). Stained cells were analyzed in a FACScanTM II flow cytometer (BD PharMingen). As a parameter for viability, cell membrane permeability was assessed by dye exclusion using 7-amino-actinomycin (BD PharMingen). 150 ng of 7-amino-actinomycin were added to cells along with specific antibodies, and three-color FACS analysis was performed. Typically, less than 10% of dead cells were detected in transfection experiments. Total cellular RNA was isolated from A431 cells using the RNA-Clean kit (Hybaid-AGS, Heidelberg, Germany). RNA (10 μg of each sample) was size-fractioned and blotted to positively charged nylon membranes using standard procedures. A 1.8-kb EcoNI/EcoRI fragment of the human ICAM-1 cDNA (2Staunton D.E. Marlin S.D. Stratowa C. Dustin M.L. Springer T.A. Cell. 1988; 52: 925-933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar) was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dATP (Amersham Biosciences) via random hexamer primer extension and used as a hybridization probe. A 0.21-kb PCR product amplified from a human glycerolaldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA was labeled and used as a control probe as described previously (6Behrends U. Peter R.U. Hintermeier-Knabe R. Eissner G. Holler E. Bornkamm G.W. Caughman S.W. Degitz K. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 103: 726-730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Hybridization, stringent washes, and exposure of films to hybridized blots was performed as described previously (28Marschall C. Lengyel E. Nobutoh T. Braungart E. Douwes K. Simon A. Magdolen V. Reuning U. Degitz K. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 113: 77-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Specific signals were densitometrically quantitated using the GelDoc system and software (Bio-Rad). Signals generated by the ICAM-1 hybridization probe were normalized to the respective GAPDH mRNA signals. Different exposure times were used to ensure that the signal strength of the analyzed bands on the autoradiographs was in the linear range. The ICAM-1 gene sequence was screened for suitable targets for triplex formation. A 16-bp oligopyrimidine-oligopurine sequence in the third intron of the ICAM-1 gene was selected as a target (Fig.1) with a neighboring 5′-TpA motif suitable for psoralen/UVA-induced photoadduct generation. An oligonucleotide was designed to form a triple helix at this site: TFOgt contains guanosine and thymidine nucleosides, allowing formation of T·AxT and C·GxG base triplets (with (·) standing for Watson-Crick interactions and (x) standing for reverse Hoogsteen interactions) after binding in an antiparallel orientation with respect to the purine strand of the double helical target sequence. We chose to use psoralen-conjugated oligonucleotides because: (i) they can be photo-induced to become irreversibly bound to their target DNA sequence and (ii) in the absence of photoactivation of the psoralen moiety, such conjugates have also been described to have increased antigene activity in cells as compared with the corresponding unconjugated oligonucleotides (17Faria M. Wood C.D. White M.R. Heálène C. Giovannangeli C. J. Mol. Med. 2001; 306: 15-24Google Scholar). For the demonstration of sequence-specific binding activity of the TFOgt oligonucleotide, two control oligodeoxynucleotides were designed, COgt1 and COgt2 (Fig. 1), both composed of (G,T) nucleotides with short G-runs (G3 or G2) similar to TFOgt. Specificity and efficacy of triplex formation were examined with a restriction enzyme protection assay that is based on the ability of triplex structures to interfere with restriction enzyme cleavage (29Giovannangeli C. Thuong N.T. Heálène C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4275-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 30Barre F.X. Ait Si Ali S. Giovannangeli C. Luis R. Robin P. Pritchard L.L. Heálène C. Harel Bellan A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3084-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We used a plasmid containing the triplex target sequence overlapping with an EcoNI cleavage site (Fig.2A). The plasmid was incubated with oligonucleotides, UVA-irradiated, and digested withEcoNI and EcoRI. Three fragments of 3804-, 453-, and 270-bp length were generated in the absence of oligonucleotides or in the presence of control oligonucleotides (Fig. 2A). In contrast, a 723-bp fragment composed of the two smaller fragments was obtained with TFOgt, suggesting that the EcoNI site was protected by the TFOgt photoadduct. A 50% inhibition was observed with a 3–10-fold molar excess of TFOgt, and almost complete inhibition was observed at a 30-fold molar excess (Fig. 2A). Inhibition was also observed when a buffer containing an additional 140 mmpotassium mimicking more physiologic ionic conditions was used. However, a 6-fold higher amount of TFOgt was required for comparable inhibition (data not shown), suggesting that triplex formation is less efficient in the presence of potassium, as described (31Noonberg S.B. Francois J.C. Garestier T. Heálène C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1956-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Triplex-induced photoproducts were further characterized in mobility shift assays (Fig. 2B). A 23-bp ICAM-1 DNA fragment containing the target sequence was incubated with TFOgt or COgt1. Samples were UVA-irradiated or not and subjected to denaturing gel electrophoresis to characterize triplex-mediated photoadducts (Fig.2B). Adducts were detected in irradiated samples containing TFOgt. Two shifted species were observed, and the amount of one of them increased with increasing UVA irradiation doses. These results are consistent with the formation of: (i) monoadducts (TFOgt covalently linked to one strand of the double helix; Fig. 2B, species b) and (ii) cross-links (TFOgt linked to both strands of the double helix; Fig. 2B, species a), as described previously (29Giovannangeli C. Thuong N.T. Heálène C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4275-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Typically, a UVA dose of 5 J/cm2 produced ∼60% cross-links and 40% monoadducts. No photoadducts were detected if TFOgt was replaced with the control oligonucleotide COgt1, confirming triplex binding prior to photoadduct formation. Collectively, these data demonstrate the ability of the oligonucleotide TFOgt to interact and photoreact with the 16-bp ICAM-1 target sequence in a sequence-specific manner. As a next step, we tested the ability of TFOs to selectively bind to the ICAM-1 target sequence within the context of genomic DNA. Triplex formation has been detected at different genomic sequences by the use of several methods including restriction enzyme protection assay, quantitative competitive PCR (21Giovannangeli C. Diviacco S. Labrousse V. Gryaznov S. Charneau P. Heálène C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), or primer extension (22Belousov E.S. Afonina I.A. Kutyavin I.V. Gall A.A. Reed M.W. Gamper H.B. Wydro R.M. Meyer R.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1324-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 23Oh D.H. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4734-4742Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this study, restriction enzyme protection assay was not applicable due to the lack of a suitable flanking restriction site at the ICAM-1 genomic target sequence. We have, therefore, established a new assay for the detection of specific TFO binding to genomic DNA. If a triplex is formed by a psoralen- and biotin-conjugated oligonucleotide at its genomic target sequence, the oligonucleotide can be psoralen/UVA-cross-linked with the double helix. After appropriate digestion, a triplex-containing restriction fragment can be captured using a biotin/streptavidin-based mechanism"

Formation of the Co–C bond between the corrin ring and the upper ligand requires the cobalt ion of the ring to be in its Co(I) oxidation state before the 5′-deoxyadenosyl moiety of ATP can be transferred to it. The set of reactions (two 1-electron reductions and one adenosyl transfer) that convert corrinoids to their adenosylated forms is known as the corrinoid adenosylation pathway, and evidence for the existence of this pathway was first described using crude cell-free extracts of Propionibacterium freundenreichii (4Brady R.O. Castanera E.G. Barker H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 223: 2325-2332Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) andClostridium tetanomorphum (5Weissbach H. Redfield B. Peterkofsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: PC40-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our current understanding of the corrinoid adenosylation pathway inS. enterica is shown in Fig.2. In this bacterium, corrinoid adenosylation is required for both synthesis and use of corrinoids. It is known that de novo synthesis of the corrin ring proceeds via adenosylated intermediates and that salvaging of exogenous, incomplete corrinoids also requires a functional corrinoid adenosylation pathway (6Escalante-Semerena J.C. Suh S.-J. Roth J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 273-280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7O'Toole G.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6328-6336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In S. enterica, the inability to adenosylate cobalamin prevents the expression of the ethanolamine utilization (eut) genes (8Kofoid E. Rappleye C. Stojiljkovic I. Roth J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5317-5329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Roof D.M. Roth J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3316-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), thus blocking growth on ethanolamine as carbon and energy source (10Suh S.-J. The Role of CobA in Adenosylation of Corrinoids in Salmonella typhimurium.Ph.D. thesis. University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1994Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, the inability to adenosylate Cbl results in the unregulated, constitutive expression of the btuB gene, which directs the synthesis of the outer membrane protein responsible for translocating exogenous corrinoids into the periplasmic space of the cell (11Lundrigan M.D. DeVeaux L.C. Mann B.J. Kadner R.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 206: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 12Franklund C.V. Kadner R.J. J.

Biochemical analysis of the reaction catalyzed by the CobA enzyme (Fig.2) suggested the nucleoside triphosphate bound to the enzyme before the corrinoid substrate (14Suh S.-J. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 921-925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, the three-dimensional structure of the ternary complex between hydroxocobalamin (HOCbl) and MgATP shows that the corrinoid substrate is bound at the surface of the active site, atop of a cavity that encloses the MgATP molecule (15Bauer C.B. Fonseca M.V. Holden H.M. Thoden J.B. Thompson T.B. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 361-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The CobA enzyme contains a P-loop motif of the sequence GNGKGKT defined by amino acids Gly36–Thr42 (16Suh S.-J. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 129: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 17Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 8: 945-951Crossref Scopus (4296) Google Scholar). This motif coordinates the α-, β-, and γ-phosphates of the nucleotide (15Bauer C.B. Fonseca M.V. Holden H.M. Thoden J.B. Thompson T.B. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 361-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of CobA shows the phosphates of ATP coordinated in opposite orientation to that found in other nucleotide hydrolases, i.e. the position normally occupied by the γ-phosphate is occupied by the α-phosphate. This unusual mode for nucleotide binding is proposed to correctly position the C-5′ of the ribosyl moiety for the nucleophilic attack by Co(I). The work reported in this study was undertaken to establish the identity of the phosphate byproducts of the reaction and to begin the identification of moieties of the substrate that are important for catalysis. The data obtained indicate PPPi is the byproduct of the CobA reaction and demonstrate the importance of the 2′-OH group of the ribosyl moiety of ATP to the adenosyltransfer reaction. Unless otherwise stated, all reagents were obtained from Sigma. The ATP analog 5-mercapto-5′-deoxy-ATP (A(S)TP) was a kind gift from G. D. Markham (Institute for Cancer Research, Philadelphia, PA). CobA was purified as described previously without modifications (15Bauer C.B. Fonseca M.V. Holden H.M. Thoden J.B. Thompson T.B. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 361-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). ATP analogs and alternative nucleotide donors were tested as substrates for the CobA enzyme using the potassium borohydride (KBH4)-dependent corrinoid adenosylation assays as described (14Suh S.-J. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 921-925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Fonseca M.V. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4304-4309Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, reaction mixtures contained (final volume, 1 ml): KBH4, 74 μmol; HOCbl, 50 nmol; CoCl2, 420 nmol; MgCl2, 1 μmol; Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, at 37 °C, 200 μmol; CobA, 0.4 nmol, and 400 nmol of each nucleotide (unless otherwise stated). Reaction mixtures were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The amount of product generated was quantified as described (14Suh S.-J. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 921-925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of triphosphate on CobA activity was investigated by including increasing amounts of triphosphate (0–3 mm) in the reaction mixture. For31P NMR analysis, ferredoxin (flavodoxin):NADP+reductase (Fpr) enzyme and flavodoxin (FldA) protein substituted for KBH4 as the reducing system for the generation of the co(I)rrinoid substrate of CobA (19Fonseca M.V. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32101-32108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained (final volume, 1 ml): HOCbl (1 μmol), ATP (2 μmol), MgCl2 (4 μmol), NADPH (2 μmol), Fpr (21 nmol), FldA (24 nmol), CobA (12 nmol) in Tris-Cl (200 μmol) buffer, pH 8.0, at 37 °C. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Samples from reaction mixtures were transferred into 5-mm (internal diameter) NMR tubes (Wilmad Glass, Buena, NJ). EDTA was added to a 10 mm final concentration. The final volume of the sample was brought up to 0.6 ml with 100% D2O (Cambridge Isotope Labs, Andover, MA). 31P NMR spectra of corrinoid adenosylation assay products were obtained at 161.98 MHz using a Bruker Instruments DMX-400 Avance console spectrometer equipped with a 9.4 T wide-bore magnet (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Facility, University of Wisconsin-Madison). Spectra were Fourier-transformed with 3-Hz line broadening. Chemical shifts were referenced to H3PO4 set to 0.0 ppm. To identify functional groups of the ribose and base moiety of the nucleotide that are important for activity, the specificity of CobA for the donor nucleotide was assessed (TableI). It was previously shown that CobA had broad specificity for the donor nucleotide (14Suh S.-J. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 921-925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When CTP, UTP, and GTP were tested as substrates, product formation (relative to the rate of ATP) was observed at rates that were 98, 88, and 37%, respectively. This broad specificity of CobA for its nucleoside triphosphate substrate was recently explained in light of the few interactions between the base and the polypeptide observed in the three-dimensional structure of the ternary complex between HOCbl, MgATP, and CobA (15Bauer C.B. Fonseca M.V. Holden H.M. Thoden J.B. Thompson T.B. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 361-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Measurements of the initial velocity of the reaction shown in Table Iwere consistent with the conclusion that the specificity of the enzyme for the base component of its nucleoside triphosphate substrate is not high.Table IUse of alternative nucleotide donors by CobANucleotide donor% Rate1-aAverage rate for product formation under these conditions using ATP as substrate was 0.4 nmol of AdoCbl min−1 ± 0.14 nmol of AdoCbl min−1.nmol AdoCbl min−1ATP (adenosine-5′-triphosphate)100AMP (adenosine-5′-monophosphate)NM1-bNot measurable under the assay conditions used.ADP (adenosine-5′-diphosphate)NMITP (inosine-5′-triphosphate)83dATP (2′-deoxyadenosine-5′-triphosphate)NMdTTP (2′-deoxythymidine-5′-triphosphate)NMdCTP (2′-deoxycytidine-5′-triphosphate)NMdGTP (2′-deoxyguanosine-5′-triphosphate)NMCTP (cytidine-5′-triphosphate)150UTP (uridine-5′-triphosphate)125GTP (guanosine-5′-triphosphate)451-a Average rate for product formation under these conditions using ATP as substrate was 0.4 nmol of AdoCbl min−1 ± 0.14 nmol of AdoCbl min−1.1-b Not measurable under the assay conditions used. Open table in a new tab At enzyme concentrations appropriate for the measurement of initial reaction velocity, 2′ deoxyribonucleotides failed to serve as substrates for CobA. At high enzyme concentrations (∼1.3 μm), the rate of product formation was detectable (relative to the rate of the reaction when ATP was used as substrate) in the following order of preference: dATP (39%), dCTP (8%), dGTP (0.7%), and dTTP (not detectable). These results can be explained in light of the three-dimensional structure of the CobA·MgATP complex (Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 3, the nucleotide is folded onto itself with the 2′-OH group of the ribosyl moiety interacting with the γ-phosphate of the nucleotide. This hydrogen bond is proposed to be critical for exposure of the C-5′ carbon of the ribose to the Co(I) nucleophile. It appears that the 2′-OH group is involved in generating a torsional angle that is important for achieving the proper conformation of ATP for the nucleophilic attack by the co(I)rrinoid. The interactions of the CobA polypeptide with MgATP (Fig. 3) also help explain the lack of enzyme activity observed when ADP or AMP was used as substrate. The mixture of orthophosphate and ADP did not substitute for ATP, suggesting an important structural role for the β–γ phosphate bond in generating the correct conformation of the nucleotide substrate. AMP is likely further affected by the lack of Mg2+ coordination. Fig.4 illustrates chemical shifts observed in31P NMR spectra of products of the CobA reaction. The triplets observed at −20.9 ppm (JP-P = 21.1 Hz) and −21.5 ppm (JP-P = 19.7 Hz) in the spectrum obtained for the complete system (Fig. 4, panel B) correlate well with the chemical shifts observed for the central phosphate of authentic PPPi and the β-phosphate of ATP, respectively. In the same spectrum, doublets corresponding to the γ-phosphate of ATP and the outer phosphates of PPPi were observed at −5.9 and −6.0 ppm, respectively (Fig. 4, panel A). The observed chemical shifts were confirmed by addition of authentic ATP and PPPi to the sample (data not shown). Signals with chemical shifts corresponding to other phosphate-containing compounds present in the reaction mixture such as NADPH and Cbl were also observed (data not shown). The signals for PPPi were absent in spectra obtained from a reaction mixture in which the CobA enzyme was omitted (Fig. 4, panels C and D). These signals were also absent in spectra obtained from a reaction mixture in which Cbl was omitted (data not shown). On the basis of these results, it was concluded that the byproduct of the CobA reaction was PPPi. To investigate whether the PPPi byproduct was further cleaved into PPPi and PPi during the reaction, authentic PPi was added to the sample. A singlet with a chemical shift of −6.4 ppm, corresponding to this compound was observed (Fig. 5). This signal was not observed in the original spectrum obtained for the complete reaction mixture (Fig. 5, panel A). The reaction catalyzed by the CobA enzyme is one of only two known reactions in which an adenosyltransfer occurs (20Walsh C. Enzymatic Reactions Requiring Pyridoxal Phosphate, Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1979: 851-854Google Scholar). The ATP:l-methionineS-adenosyltransferase (S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) synthetase, EC 2.5.1.6) enzyme catalyzes the adenosyltransfer from ATP to the sulfur atom of methionine in a two-step reaction. The first step in this reaction involves cleavage of the triphosphate chain of ATP between the C-5′ and the α-phosphate. In the second step, triphosphate is hydrolyzed into PPi and Pibefore the endproduct of the reaction, AdoMet is released (21Markham G.D. Hafner E.W. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9082-9092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The above results obtained with the CobA enzyme suggested that unlike the AdoMet synthetase enzyme, CobA has no detectable triphosphatase activity. Further support for triphosphate as the byproduct of the reaction was obtained from inhibition studies. As shown in Fig.6, triphosphate was a strong inhibitor of CobA enzyme activity, with 85% of the activity lost when the ATP/PPPi ratio in the reaction mixture was 1:2.5.Figure 5Chemical shifts for standards added to the complete reaction mixture.Panel A, chemical shifts observed for the γ-phosphate of ATP, the outer phosphates of PPPi and PPi added to the complete reaction mixture.

If CobA had triphosphatase activity associated with it, these compounds would be expected to be inactive as substrates for the enzyme or affect the rate of product formation, as has been demonstrated for AdoMet synthetase (21Markham G.D.

These compounds were poor inhibitors of the enzyme under the conditions tested, since no inhibition of CobA activity was detectable when they were present in the reaction mixture at relatively high concentrations (0.5 and 1 mm, data not shown). These results were in contrast to results obtained with other nucleotide hydrolases where these compounds have been found to be substrates and or inhibitors (22Ma Q.F. Kenyon G.L. Markham G.D.

The analog A(S)TP, however, was a strong inhibitor of CobA activity with complete inhibition of enzyme activity observed at 3 μm A(S)TP. Inhibition by A(S)TP was expected because this analog contains a sulfur bridge rather than an oxygen bridge between the C-5′ and the α-phosphate, making it non-hydrolyzable at the C-5′ position. The results described herein further our understanding of the reaction catalyzed by the S. entericaATP:co(I)rrinoid adenosyltransferase (CobA) enzyme function, which is required for de novo biosynthesis of AdoCbl and for the assimilation of incomplete corrinoids. The crucial role of the 2′-OH group of the ribosyl moiety of ATP in CobA activity can be readily visualized in the three-dimensional structure of the binding site occupied by ATP. The γ-phosphate of ATP is critical for positioning the target (the C-5′) for nucleophilic attack by Co(I). The data are consistent with nucleophilic displacement of the triphosphate chain of ATP. This mechanism appears to be similar to the reported one for theC. tetanomophum co(I)rrinoid adenosyltransferase but different than the mechanism reported for the P. freundenreichii enzyme. Unlike AdoMet synthetase, CobA lacks any detectable triphosphatase activity. This difference between AdoMet synthetase may reflect differences in the ease of product release between these enzymes."

Chin K.V. Liu J.H. Lozano G. Chang K.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6858-6867Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). PML is a multifunctional Ring finger protein normally localized within the nucleus as a macromolecular structure in a nuclear speckled pattern designated PML nuclear body (NB) or PML oncogenic domain (2Melnick A. Licht J.D. Blood. 1999; 93: 3167-3215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In APL cells, the normal PML NBs are disrupted as a result of forming heterodimer with the fusion protein PML-retinoic acid receptor α to form a nuclear microspeckled pattern. Interestingly, all-trans-retinoic acid treatment of APL patients induced dramatic differentiation of the leukemia blasts associated with rapid degradation of PML-retinoic acid receptor α and reorganization of the normal PML NB that presumably restore normal PML function (2Melnick A. Licht J.D. Blood. 1999; 93: 3167-3215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PML has been shown to be a cellular growth and tumor suppressor (3Wang Z.G. Delva L. Gaboli M. Rivi R. Giorgio M. Gordon-Cardo C.

Studies using a PML knock-out animal model demonstrated that PML is essential for apoptosis induced by TNFα, ceramide, γ-irradiation, interferons, and Fas (6Wang Z.G. Ruggero D. Ronchetti S. Zhong S. Gaboli M. Rivi R. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which PML induces apoptosis remains obscure. The PML protein is normally modified by SUMO-1, a small ubiquitin-like protein, at three different sites (9Kamitani T. Kito K. Nyuyen H.P. Wada H. Fukuda-Kamitani T. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26675-26682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). SUMO-1 modification plays an essential role in the formation of PML NB and in its function in transcriptional regulation and apoptosis (10Seeler J.-S. Dejean A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7243-7249Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). PML also functions as a transcriptional regulator (for review see Refs.11Lin R.J. Sternsdorf T. Tini M. Evans R.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7204-7215Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar and 12Zhong S. Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E85-E90Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). The transcription coactivator CREB-binding protein, a histone acetyltransferase, interacts with PML and colocalizes in the PML NB, suggesting a role of PML in mediating transcription (13LaMorte V.J.

The highly acetylated chromatin presumably associated with actively transcribing genes was also found to be associated with PML NB (14Boisvert F.-M. Kruhlak M.J. Box A.K. Hendzel M.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1099-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Moreover, PML has been shown to upregulate the transcription of genes related to the major histocompatibility complex (15Zheng P. Guo Y. Niu Q. Levy D.E. Dyck J.A., Lu, S. Sheiman L.A. Liu Y. Nature. 1998; 396: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), GATA-2 (16Tsuzuki S. Towatari M. Saito H. Enver T. Mol. Cell.

On the other hand, when PML was fused downstream of the GAL4 DNA binding domain, it repressed GAL4-mediated transcription through a mechanism that is sensitive to trichostatin A, a specific inhibitor of the transcription corepressor histone deacetylases (21Vallian S.

Edmondson D. Roth S. Chang K.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2259-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Another mechanism of transcription repression by PML was also reported recently. It was found that PML interacts directly with transcription factor Sp1 and interferes with its ability to bind DNA, leading to repression of the Sp1-dependent transcription of epidermal growth factor receptor promoter (24Vallian S. Chin K.V. Chang K.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7147-7156Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A20 is a target gene of NFκB and was originally identified as a zinc finger protein induced by treatment with TNFα (25Opipari A.W. Boguski M.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14705-14708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A20 was characterized as a potent inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis (26Jaattela M. Mouritzen H. Elling F. Bastholm L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1166-1173PubMed Google Scholar). The overexpression of A20 significantly downregulated NFκB activation and inhibited the expression of NFκB target genes, indicating that A20 is a potent inhibitor of NFκB (27Cooper J.T. Stroka D.M. Brostjan C. Palmetshofer A. Bach F.H. Ferran C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18068-18073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 28Ferran C. Stroka D.M. Badrichani A.Z. Cooper J.T. Wrighton C.J. Soares M. Grey S.T. Bach F.H. Blood. 1998; 91: 2249-2258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these findings suggest that A20 plays a role as a negative feedback regulator of NFκB activation. The recent finding that A20-deficient mice failed to regulate TNF-induced NFκB activation and apoptosis supports this notion (29Lee E.G. Boone D.L. Chai S. Libby S.L. Chien M. Lodolce J.P. Ma A. Science. 2000; 289: 2350-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). This finding implies that A20 plays a critical role in mediating apoptosis and inflammation by terminating the TNF-induced NFκB responses. To further understand the mechanism of how PML induces apoptosis, our present study shows that PML significantly inhibits the expression of A20, a potent repressor of TNF-induced apoptosis. PML represses the A20 promoter induced by TNFα and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) through the NFκB site. Our study further shows that A20 inhibits apoptosis induced by PML/TNFα and explains the mechanism by which PML induces apoptosis by sensitizing the TNF death receptor pathway. The inducible expression plasmid pMEP4/PML was constructed by subcloning the full-length PML cDNA (PML3) into the NotI/XhoI sites of the pMEP4 vector (Invitrogen). pMEP4/HA-A20 was constructed by cloning the polymerase chain reaction-amplified full-length A20 cDNA into theEcoRI site of the pCruz/HA vector to generate pCruz/HA-A20. The HA-A20 fragment was then excised byXhoI/BglII and subcloned into the pMEP4 vector. The A20 promoter-luciferase reporter construct A20PR-Luc was generated by cloning the PCR-amplified fragment of the A20 promoter using the upstream primer 5′-CCCAGCCCGACCCAGAGAGTCACGTGAC-3′ and the downstream primer 5′-CCCAGACTGCGCAGTCTGCTTTGCCCCG-3′ and inserting them into the pGL3 vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Correct DNA sequence of all plasmids was confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. The U2OS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Anti-HA monoclonal antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-caspase-7 antibody (number 66871A) was purchased from PharMingen. Anti-A20 antibody (number 40901) was obtained from Active & Motif, Inc. (Carlsbad, CA). Cells were cultured to semiconfluence and transfected with the expression plasmids using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics). Luciferase activity was determined using the luciferase reporter assay according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). U2OS cells were transfected with each of the following plasmids: pMEP4 (negative control), pMEP4/HA-A20, and pMEP4/PML with FuGENE 6 reagent. Cells were then selected with hygromycin (200 μg/ml) for 10 days. Pools of hygromycin-resistant stable clones were selected. Inducible expression of the respective proteins in these stable cell lines was determined by induction with CdSO4 (5 μm) for 20 h followed by immunofluorescent staining and Western blot analysis. Cell death was examined by trypan blue exclusion assay. Total RNA was prepared from cells using RNeasy mini-kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized from 4 μg of total RNA using the Superscript preamplification system obtained from Invitrogen. Cultured cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in ice-cold digitonin extraction buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 0.015% (w/v) digitonin, 300 mm NaCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were permeabilized for 10 min, assessed by trypan blue exclusion assay, and centrifuged for 5 min at 480 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant contains the cytoplasmic protein. The digitonin-insoluble pellet was resuspended in ice-cold Triton X-100 extraction buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 300 mm sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 30 min. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 5000 × g and resuspended in nuclear extraction buffer (50 mm PIPES, pH 7.5, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 10% (v/v) glycerol). The nuclear mixture was incubated for 30 min on ice and then centrifuged for 5 min (6780 × g) at 4 °C. The supernatant contains the nuclear proteins. The in vitro-translated PML or p65 proteins were synthesized by the TnT-coupled wheat germ translation system (Promega). Nuclear extracts were prepared from U2OS stable cell lines or cells treated with TNFα (20 ng/ml) for 1 h. The A20 promoter NFκB probe was prepared by annealing the oligonucleotides 5′-GACTTTGGAAAGTCCCGTGGAAATCCCCGGG-3′ and 5′-GGCCCGGGGATTTCCACGGGACTTTCCAAAGT-3′, and the 3′-recessive ends were labeled with Klenow fragment fill-in reaction. Binding reactions contained 5 μg of nuclear extracts, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 1 ng of NFκB probe (1 × 105 cpm) in 20 μl of KCl binding buffer (10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmKCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The reaction was incubated for 20 min at room temperature and then resolved in a 5% polyacrylamide gel in Tris-glycine buffer (50 mm Tris, 0.4 m glycine, and 2 mmEDTA, pH 8.5). For competition or supershift assays, 50 ng of unlabeled probe or 1 μg of anti-p65 monoclonal antibody, respectively, was added to the binding reactions. Our preliminary study showed that PML significantly sensitized TNF-induced apoptosis in the TNF-resistant cell line U2O. To understand the effects of PML on the TNF-induced apoptotic pathway, we investigated the effect of PML on the expression of A20 in the osteosarcoma cell line U2OS. We found that TNFα induces a significant increase in A1 and A20 expression in these cells but not c-FLIP (Fig.1a). To examine the effects of PML on the expression of A20, stable clones of inducible PML in U2OS cells (U2OS/PML) and the control U2OS cells (pMEP4/U2OS) were established. These cells were treated with 5 μm cadmium sulfate to induce PML expression followed by the treatment of TNFα. The results of this study showed that expression of PML significantly repressed the expression of A20 induced by TNFα (Fig. 1b). No such effect on A20 expression was found in the control cell line pMEP4/U2OS or in the PML/U2OS cells if Cd2+ was not included in the culture medium to induce PML expression. This study suggests that PML is a specific inhibitor of A20 expression. To continue to investigate the effects of PML on A20 expression, the A20 promoter-luciferase construct (pA20PR-Luc) was created and used in a series of cotransfection experiments to investigate whether PML affects the transactivation of the A20 promoter. We first investigated the effects of PML expression on TNFα-induced activation of the A20 promoter. In the cotransfection experiments, U2OS cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3/PML or pcDNA3 and pA20PR-Luc. After 24 h, cells were treated with TNFα for 2 and 4 h. The results of this study presented in Fig. 2ademonstrate that the presence of PML significantly represses A20 promoter activity. A similar experiment was performed using the stable PML/U2OS cells and the control pMEP4/U2OS cells transfected with pA20PR-Luc followed by treatment with PMA. This experiment further showed that PML significantly represses transactivation of the A20 promoter in PML/U2OS cells treated with Cd2+ (Fig.2b). No inhibitory effects of the A20 promoter were found in pMEP4/U2OS control and PML/U2OS cells not treated with Cd2+. These results demonstrated that PML represses the promoter activity of A20 induced by treatment with TNFα and PMA. A20 is a downstream target gene of NFκB inducible by TNF treatment. Therefore, we speculate that PML represses transcription of A20 through the inhibition of the NFκB function. To test this hypothesis, a series of cotransfection experiments was performed with pA20PR-Luc in the presence of RelA/p65 expression plasmid and increasing concentrations of pcDNA/PML. The results presented in Fig. 3 demonstrate that the presence of RelA/p65 dramatically activated the promoter activity of A20. Cotransfection with pcDNA3/PML at increasing concentrations significantly repressed A20 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. This result indicates that PML represses the RelA/p65-dependent transactivation of the A20 promoter. The study described above suggests that PML represses RelA-dependent transactivation by interfering with NFκB binding to the A20 promoter. To further understand how PML represses transactivation of the A20 promoter through NFκB, electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed using nuclear protein isolated from stable inducible cell lines pMEP4/U2OS and PML/U2OS treated or untreated with TNFα. In this assay, electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed using the DNA sequence derived from the NFκB site of the A20 promoter. The results presented in Fig.4 demonstrate that the expression of PML inhibited the binding of p65/RelA to the consensus sequences (lanes 5 and 6). Together, these studies suggest that PML inhibits NFκB binding to the promoter of A20 and consequently represses its transactivation. It is clear that A20 is a target gene of NFκB inducible by TNFα (25Opipari A.W. Boguski M.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14705-14708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is also an abundance of evidence to suggest that A20 acts as a potent inhibitor of NFκB (27Cooper J.T. Stroka D.M. Brostjan C. Palmetshofer A. Bach F.H. Ferran C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18068-18073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 28Ferran C. Stroka D.M. Badrichani A.Z. Cooper J.T. Wrighton C.J. Soares M. Grey S.T. Bach F.H.

To investigate the possible functional interaction between PML and A20, we investigated whether the expression of A20 has any significant effects on PML/TNFα-induced apoptosis in U2OS cells. To address this question, a pool of inducible stable cell lines of A20 in U2OS cells driven by the metallothionine promoter was established. The expression of A20 can be induced by a low concentration of Cd2+ (Fig.5a). A control cell line (pMEP4/U2OS) transfected with the empty vector alone was also established. The results presented in Fig. 5b show that a significant degree of cell death was induced after a 24-h infection with recombinant PML adenovirus (Ad-PML) and 8-h treatment with TNFα. However, PML/TNFα-induced cell death was significantly reduced in cells overexpressing A20, indicating that A20 inhibited apoptosis induced by PML/TNFα. The results shown in Fig. 5cdemonstrate that control pMEP4/U2OS cells treated with PML/TNFα significantly activated procaspase-7; however, in cells overexpressing A20, procaspase-7 activation was significantly reduced. Thus, this study demonstrated that A20 inhibits cell death induced by PML/TNFα in TNF-resistant cells. PML was originally cloned and characterized for its involvement in the nonrandom chromosomal translocationt(15;17), which occurs in ∼99% of APL cases. The importance of PML in maintaining normal cellular function was unambiguously demonstrated by its essential role in multiple pathways of apoptosis (4Le X.F. Vallian S., Mu, Z.M. Hung M.C.

PML is a cell growth and tumor suppressor; however, the mechanisms by which PML exerts its tumor suppressor function remains unclear. In MCF-7 cells, the overexpression of PML induced G1 cell-cycle arrest associated with an upregulation of p21, p53, cyclin D, and hypophosphorylation of the Rb (6Wang Z.G. Ruggero D. Ronchetti S. Zhong S. Gaboli M. Rivi R. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Unphosphorylated Rb binds the E2F transcription factor and limits its ability to activate the transcription of genes essential for the G1 to S transition (34Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4308) Google Scholar). PML does not bind DNA directly; however, it plays a role in transcriptional regulation through its association with the transcription coactivator CREB-binding protein and interacts with the transcription corepressor histone deacetylases (13LaMorte V.J.

Oncogene 20, 7250–7256Google Scholar) and recruiting p53 to the PML NB to enhance transactivation of p53 target genes. PML also represses transcription by interacting with transcription factor Sp1 and interfering with its binding to the epidermal growth factor receptor promoter (24Vallian S. Chin K.V. Chang K.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7147-7156Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The results presented in Fig. 4 suggest a similar mechanism of transcriptional repression by PML. In this case, PML represses transcription of the A20 gene by interfering with NFκB binding to the promoter. It is not clear why and how PML is involved in these two opposite functions in transcriptional regulation. Recent studies suggest that PML NB may serve as the storage site of important cellular regulatory proteins. Increased expression of PML may sequester these protein factors to the PML NBs and consequently limit their normal functional roles as a transcription activators or repressors. Although a role of PML in multiple pathways of apoptosis has been clearly established, the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. PML is required for Daxx-induced apoptosis in mouse splenocytes. In the absence of PML, cellular localization of Daxx was altered, and its proapoptotic function was impaired (36Lehembre F. Muller S. Pandolfi P.P. Dejean A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In these cells, the ability of Daxx to sensitize Fas-induced apoptosis was abrogated (36Lehembre F. Muller S. Pandolfi P.P. Dejean A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Daxx was also shown to specifically enhance Fas-induced apoptosis (38Torii S. Egan D.A. Evans R.A. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) in human cells by association with PML NB through a mechanism that involved the activation of caspase 8 and caspase 3; however, it is not known what role PML plays in TNF-induced apoptosis. The results presented in this report support the novel mechanism of PML-induced apoptosis in inhibiting the expression of A20, a potent inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis. This study showed that PML represses the promoter activity of A20 induced by treatment with TNFα and PMA. PML inhibits transactivation of the A20 promoter by interfering with NFκB binding to its consensus cis-acting element. This finding was further supported by the study showing that stable overexpression of A20 significantly inhibited apoptosis induced by the combined effects of PML and TNFα (Fig. 5). This study indicates that PML sensitizes TNFα-induced cell death by repressing the expression of A20 and inhibits its anti-apoptotic function. A20 is a novel zinc finger protein first described as an early responsive gene inducible by TNF treatment (25Opipari A.W. Boguski M.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14705-14708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was originally characterized as an inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis (26Jaattela M. Mouritzen H. Elling F. Bastholm L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1166-1173PubMed Google Scholar). A20 is also a potent inhibitor of NFκB activation induced by not only TNF but also by interleukin-1, lipopolysaccharide, PMA, and hydrogen peroxide (39Beyaert R. Heyninck K. Huffel S.V. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1143-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). This inhibitory effect may be mediated through its interaction with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors (40Song H.Y. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6721-6725Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) or other A20 binding proteins (41Huffel V. Delaei F. Heyninck K., De Valck D. Beyaert R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30216-30223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the expression of A20 is controlled by NFκB, suggesting that it is involved in a negative feedback mechanism in regulating NFκB. NFκB is an important transcription factor that regulates the expression of many mediators of inflammation (42Perkins N.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 434-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) and anti-apoptotic proteins involved in the survival pathway (43Rahman A. Anwar K.N. True A.L. Malik A.B. J.

The finding that PML represses the transcription of the A20 promoter by interfering with NFκB binding is interesting. It will be important to further investigate the mechanism by which PML inhibits the binding of NFκB to its target DNA sequence and to examine whether the two proteins are functionally associated in vivo.

To investigate the mutations of ETB in Hirschsprung disease, expression of the ETB gene in lymphoblastoid cells from patients and normal healthy adults was examined, and novel mutant transcripts were found. The mutant ETB gene transcripts lacked a 134-bp nucleotide sequence corresponding to exon 5, and some also contained a substitution from A to G at position 950 in exon 4, resulting in an amino acid substitution from glutamine (Q) to arginine (R). This substitution was suspected to be the result of RNA editing because it was not present in the genomic sequence. Transfection experiments using ETB minigenes containing the editing site with or without the gene for double-strand RNA deaminases (ADAR1 and ADAR2) revealed that the deaminases were involved in RNA editing. Furthermore, a c-Myc-tagged mutant ETB protein was not detected by Western blot analysis. The present results show that the mutant ETB transcripts were novel splice variants, which might not be translated, or that the products translated from splice variants might be quickly degraded, presumably because of their instability. The preferential production of this null function ETB by RNA editing/splicing could be involved in the etiology of some cases of Hirschsprung disease.

They act on two subtypes of G protein-coupled receptors, ETA and ETB (1Kedzierski R.M. Yanagisawa M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 851-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). ETA exhibits higher affinities, on a subnanomolar order, to ET-1 and ET-2 compared with its affinity for ET-3, whereas ETB accepts all three isopeptides equally. The ET receptors regulate multiple effector pathways such as phospholipase C via Gq, adenyl cyclase via Gs in smooth muscle cells (ETA), and via Gi in endothelial cells (ETB) (2Rubanyi G.M. Polokoff M.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 325-415PubMed Google Scholar). Critical determinants in ET receptor domains for subtype-specific Gs/Gi protein coupling were investigated by generating chimeric receptors in two subtypes. It was found that the second and third intracellular loops are important for selective G protein couplings (3Takagi Y. Ninomiya H. Sakamoto A. Miwa S. Masaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10072-10078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).Physiological and pathological functions of the ET receptor systems have been defined by pharmacological studies as well as by gene targeting. Two lines of evidence arose from mutant mice generated by gene targeting of either the ETB or the ET-3 gene. The mice showed phenotypic similarity to Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) or Shah-Waardenburg syndrome in humans (4Hosoda K. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Baynash A.G. Cheung J.C. Giaid A. Yanagisawa M.

HSCR is a congenital intestinal disorder characterized by the absence of ganglionic cells in the distal portion of the intestinal tract. This absence is primarily the result of premature arrest of cranio-caudal migration of neural crest cells. Critical mutations in the ETB gene locus have also been found among naturally occurring HSCR in humans, mice, and rats (4Hosoda K. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Baynash A.G. Cheung J.C. Giaid A.

It was derived from splicing and/or RNA editing of the primary ETB transcript, and it occurred in one of three patients as well as in some normal subjects. The splicing reaction removed the entire fifth exon and resulted in a deletion of both the fourth transmembrane domain and the distal portion of the third extracellular loop from the ETB polypeptide. An observed sequence discrepancy between the genomic and the reverse-transcribed samples suggested that editing of ETB transcripts occurred at the new 5′-splicing site of the shorter transcript. Here, we examine the mechanisms of splicing and RNA editing of the ETB primary transcripts as well as the functional consequences of these post-transcriptional alterations in mammalian cells. Finally, the causal relationship of the production of this mutant ETB to HSCR was assessed.DISCUSSIONProper functioning of the ET system is now recognized as an important requirement for a wide variety of cellular physiological processes as well as for the development of certain organs. Mutations in the ETB gene may lead to HSCR when ETB proteins are functionally altered. Among the reported ETB mutations, the mutation C109R resulted in a mutant ETB with a lowered affinity to ET-1, and the mutations W276C and S390R impaired intracellular signaling events (11Tanaka H. Moroi K. Iwa I.J. Takahashi H. Ohnuma N. Hori S. Takimoto M. Nishiyama M. Masaki T. Yanagisawa M. Sekiya S. Kimura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11378-11383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the ETB mutation N104I was found in a patient, but the protein exhibited normal functional properties, and this was designated a polymorphism (11Tanaka H. Moroi K. Iwa I.J. Takahashi H. Ohnuma N. Hori S. Takimoto M. Nishiyama M. Masaki T. Yanagisawa M. Sekiya S. Kimura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11378-11383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In investigating the ETB gene in three patients with HSCR, we did not detect the mutations mentioned above, but mutant as well as full-length transcripts of the ETB gene were found in one patient (HD8). The mutant ETB transcripts skipped the 134-bp nucleotide sequence corresponding to exon 5, and the same splicing variant was also found in normal adults and in several sets of cultured cells from human tissues. The novel splicing variants lack a stretch of nucleotide region corresponding to a polypeptide section from the distal portion of C3 to the proximal side of the third extracellular protein loop. From this splicing site a frameshift resulted in an addition of 19 amino acids that are completely different from the wild-type sequence. The open reading frame of the spliced transcript was terminated by an early termination codon that was generated.So far, several splice variants have been reported for the ETB gene in humans (28Shyamala V. Moulthrop T.H. Stratton-Thomas J. Tekamp-Olson P. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 285-296PubMed Google Scholar, 29Elshourbagy N.A. Adamou J.E. Gagnon A.W., Wu, H.L. Pullen M. Nambi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25300-25307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) as well as in other organisms (30Nambi P., Wu, H.L., Ye, D. Gagnon A. Elshourbagy N. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 292: 247-253PubMed Google Scholar). The splice variant of ETB having an insertion of 10 amino acid residues at the C2 domain and the variant that is 14 amino acids shorter than the wild-type ETB receptor exhibit similar functional responses (28Shyamala V. Moulthrop T.H. Stratton-Thomas J. Tekamp-Olson P. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 285-296PubMed Google Scholar, 30Nambi P., Wu, H.L., Ye, D. Gagnon A. Elshourbagy N. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 292: 247-253PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the variant with a different amino acid sequence at the C4 domain results in alterations in the cytoplasmic domain that reduce the capability of the cell to conduct signal transduction (29Elshourbagy N.A. Adamou J.E. Gagnon A.W., Wu, H.L. Pullen M. Nambi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25300-25307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, alternative RNA splicing may play a functional role by generating physiologically diverse receptor activities (29Elshourbagy N.A. Adamou J.E. Gagnon A.W., Wu, H.L. Pullen M. Nambi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25300-25307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The skipping of a 134-bp stretch of DNA corresponding to exon 5 would result in the synthesis of smaller ETB polypeptides, with an entirely different polypeptide sequence starting at the C3 domain. Because the intracellular carboxyl-terminal domain of the seven-helix transmembrane receptors is critical for G protein coupling and functional responses (1Kedzierski R.M. Yanagisawa M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 851-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 2Rubanyi G.M. Polokoff M.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 325-415PubMed Google Scholar), the smaller polypeptide translated from the splice variant described here might exhibit a severe functional impairment, if expressed stably in vivo.A substantial number of ETB clones were also found which contained an A to G conversion at nucleotide position 950 in exon 4, resulting in an amino acid change from glutamine to arginine (Q/R conversion). Several possible explanations for a site-specific difference between the genomic and cDNA sequences can be made. First, the presence of different copies of the gene, some of them bearing the mutation and some having the normal sequence, could explain the discrepancy found here. This could happen if ETB is a member of a family of highly homologous genes or if allelic variants of the gene are present, if there is a pseudogene in another location which is illegitimately transcribed. However, a detailed analysis of genomic DNA, which could reveal sequence differences corresponding to any of these situations, clearly showed A at position 950 in all of the PCRs from genomic DNA. Furthermore, previous studies demonstrated that a single gene encodes the ETB enzyme (16Arai H. Nakao K. Takaya K. Hosoda K. Ogawa Y. Nakanishi S. Imura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3463-3470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We were consistently unable to find the conversion in the genome, and a single band was generated by genomic DNA amplification. The altered transcripts were therefore considered to be derived from same gene, and it was also concluded that there is no ETB pseudogene.Another possible explanation for the observed base change is that an artifact was introduced either by the reverse transcriptase or by the DNA polymerase. We were particularly concerned that misincorporation by one of the polymerases used in RT-PCR amplification of ETB RNA might give rise to this type of result. It was reported previously that the polymerase activity exhibited no proofreading function and was notoriously error-prone, with misincorporation of inappropriate nucleotides at frequencies ranging from 1 in 10−4 to 1 in 10−3 (31de la Torre J.C. Giachetti C. Semler B.L. Holland J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2531-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, sequencing of ETB transcripts generated with avian myeloblastosis virus or MMLV reverse transcriptase showed that an A or G nucleotide at position 950 of ETB occurred with nearly equal frequencies from at least some of the RNA sources. When reconstitution experiments were performed using the minigenes, no evidence for misincorporation of nucleotides by reverse transcriptase was obtained. Themostable Taq polymerase is also known to create point mutations at a frequency of ∼1 in 600-bp in PCR-amplified DNA (32Eckert K.A. Kunkel T.A. PCR Methods Appl. 1991; 1: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 33Mattila P. Korpela J. Tenkanen T. Pitkanen K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4967-4973Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This plausible source of artifacts in our observations was ruled out by replacing Taq polymerase with either Pfu or Vent DNA polymerase. Identical nucleotide sequencing results were obtained after RT-PCRs were carried out by several different reverse transcriptases or DNA polymerases. Using either of the two reverse transcriptases in combination with any one of the three DNA polymerases did not affect the outcome of the experiment. The results showed that neither the reverse transcriptase, the Taq polymerase, nor experimental artifacts were responsible for generating the transcript with a G at position 950. Hence, this series of experiments may rule out the following possible mechanisms for generating the nucleotide conversion: (i) the existence of pseudogenes; (ii) RT artifacts; or (iii) PCR artifacts. We then examined the possible RNA editing at position 950 in ETB RNA which results in a glutamine (CAG) to arginine (CGG) substitution at amino acid residue 317 (Q/R site).Several gene-editing phenomena have been described in the past few years, in which editing can lead to predetermined modification of the coding potential of genes (34Scott J. Cell. 1995; 81: 833-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 35Ashkenas J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 60: 278-283PubMed Google Scholar, 36Gerber A.P. Keller W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 376-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). There are at least four kinds of adenosine deaminases that act on mammalian RNA (37Bass B.L. Nishikura K. Keller W. Seeburg P.H. Emeson R.B. O'Connell M.A. Samuel C.E. Herbert A. RNA. 1997; 3: 947-949PubMed Google Scholar). Among these deaminases, the RED1/ADAR2 is the most selective for the Q/R site (19Melcher T. Maas S. Herb A. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Higuchi M.

Similar to the Q/R site reported in the glutamate receptor (GluR-B) gene, our study showed that the Q/R site in the transcripts from the endogenous ETB gene, as well as from the exogenous ETB minigenes, could be edited. Moreover, ADAR1 or ADAR2 expressed in HEK293 cells was shown to accelerate editing of the transcripts from the endogenous or the exogenous ETB gene. However, ADAR1 was less efficient. These results were in good agreement with a previous report (19Melcher T. Maas S. Herb A. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Higuchi M. Nature. 1996; 379: 460-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) and indicated that ETB is a novel target for RNA editing by the ADAR2 enzyme. Because the dsRNA is predicted to form an extended stem-loop structure, with pairing occurring between the editing site and a downstream intronic sequence, dsRNA is considered to be the signal for this type of editing (19Melcher T. Maas S. Herb A. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Higuchi M. Nature. 1996; 379: 460-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 23Kim U. Wang Y. Sanford T. Zeng Y. Nishikura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

For GluR-B and 5-HT2CR, the editing reaction occurs before splicing of the RNA because a specific intronic sequence downstream from the edited site is necessary for the editing to take place (25Egebjerg J. Kukekov V. Heinemann S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10270-10274Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 38Higuchi M. Single F.N. Kohler M. Sommer B. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1361-1370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Because the nucleotide substitution in the ETB gene was present only in the transcript that skipped the 134 bp of exon 5, it is speculated that splicing would be followed by editing and that the skipping of exon 5 would influence the structure of pre-mRNA and promote RNA editing.We observed a markedly higher frequency for the editing in the HD8 patient cells than in controls; thus, the frequency was 0–25% in controls, but it did not reach the level of 73% as detected in the patient cells. As reported previously in the case of neurofibromatosis, a phenomenon of the editing is involved in the pathogenesis and/or progression of von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (26Skuse G.R. Cappione A.J. Sowden M. Metheny L.J. Smith H.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 478-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and furthermore the increased level of mRNA editing in NF1 was reported to lead to disease progression from benign neurofibroma to neurofibrosarcoma (27Cappione A.J. French B.L. Skuse G.R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 60: 305-312PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, the enhanced level of mRNA editing in ETB may be associated with the disease progression of HSCR. However, further studies are clearly required to determine whether the mutant ETB generated by RNA editing/splicing is causally related to the multigenic HSCR or not. Endothelins (ETs),1 one of which was originally discovered as an endothelium-derived vasoconstricting factor, comprise a family of three isopeptides, termed ET-1, ET-2, and ET-3. They act on two subtypes of G protein-coupled receptors, ETA and ETB (1Kedzierski R.M. Yanagisawa M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 851-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). ETA exhibits higher affinities, on a subnanomolar order, to ET-1 and ET-2 compared with its affinity for ET-3, whereas ETB accepts all three isopeptides equally. The ET receptors regulate multiple effector pathways such as phospholipase C via Gq, adenyl cyclase via Gs in smooth muscle cells (ETA), and via Gi in endothelial cells (ETB) (2Rubanyi G.M. Polokoff M.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 325-415PubMed Google Scholar). Critical determinants in ET receptor domains for subtype-specific Gs/Gi protein coupling were investigated by generating chimeric receptors in two subtypes. It was found that the second and third intracellular loops are important for selective G protein couplings (3Takagi Y. Ninomiya H. Sakamoto A. Miwa S. Masaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10072-10078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Physiological and pathological functions of the ET receptor systems have been defined by pharmacological studies as well as by gene targeting. Two lines of evidence arose from mutant mice generated by gene targeting of either the ETB or the ET-3 gene. The mice showed phenotypic similarity to Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) or Shah-Waardenburg syndrome in humans (4Hosoda K. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Baynash A.G. Cheung J.C. Giaid A. Yanagisawa M.

HSCR is a congenital intestinal disorder characterized by the absence of ganglionic cells in the distal portion of the intestinal tract. This absence is primarily the result of premature arrest of cranio-caudal migration of neural crest cells. Critical mutations in the ETB gene locus have also been found among naturally occurring HSCR in humans, mice, and rats (4Hosoda K. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Baynash A.G. Cheung J.C. Giaid A.

In the course of analyzing candidate genes for sporadic cases of Japanese HSCR patients, a novel transcript of the ETB gene was discovered. It was derived from splicing and/or RNA editing of the primary ETB transcript, and it occurred in one of three patients as well as in some normal subjects. The splicing reaction removed the entire fifth exon and resulted in a deletion of both the fourth transmembrane domain and the distal portion of the third extracellular loop from the ETB polypeptide. An observed sequence discrepancy between the genomic and the reverse-transcribed samples suggested that editing of ETB transcripts occurred at the new 5′-splicing site of the shorter transcript. Here, we examine the mechanisms of splicing and RNA editing of the ETB primary transcripts as well as the functional consequences of these post-transcriptional alterations in mammalian cells. Finally, the causal relationship of the production of this mutant ETB to HSCR was assessed. DISCUSSIONProper functioning of the ET system is now recognized as an important requirement for a wide variety of cellular physiological processes as well as for the development of certain organs. Mutations in the ETB gene may lead to HSCR when ETB proteins are functionally altered. Among the reported ETB mutations, the mutation C109R resulted in a mutant ETB with a lowered affinity to ET-1, and the mutations W276C and S390R impaired intracellular signaling events (11Tanaka H. Moroi K. Iwa I.J. Takahashi H. Ohnuma N. Hori S. Takimoto M. Nishiyama M. Masaki T. Yanagisawa M. Sekiya S. Kimura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11378-11383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the ETB mutation N104I was found in a patient, but the protein exhibited normal functional properties, and this was designated a polymorphism (11Tanaka H. Moroi K. Iwa I.J. Takahashi H. Ohnuma N. Hori S. Takimoto M. Nishiyama M. Masaki T. Yanagisawa M. Sekiya S. Kimura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11378-11383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In investigating the ETB gene in three patients with HSCR, we did not detect the mutations mentioned above, but mutant as well as full-length transcripts of the ETB gene were found in one patient (HD8). The mutant ETB transcripts skipped the 134-bp nucleotide sequence corresponding to exon 5, and the same splicing variant was also found in normal adults and in several sets of cultured cells from human tissues. The novel splicing variants lack a stretch of nucleotide region corresponding to a polypeptide section from the distal portion of C3 to the proximal side of the third extracellular protein loop. From this splicing site a frameshift resulted in an addition of 19 amino acids that are completely different from the wild-type sequence. The open reading frame of the spliced transcript was terminated by an early termination codon that was generated.So far, several splice variants have been reported for the ETB gene in humans (28Shyamala V. Moulthrop T.H. Stratton-Thomas J. Tekamp-Olson P. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 285-296PubMed Google Scholar, 29Elshourbagy N.A. Adamou J.E. Gagnon A.W., Wu, H.L. Pullen M. Nambi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25300-25307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) as well as in other organisms (30Nambi P., Wu, H.L., Ye, D. Gagnon A. Elshourbagy N. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 292: 247-253PubMed Google Scholar). The splice variant of ETB having an insertion of 10 amino acid residues at the C2 domain and the variant that is 14 amino acids shorter than the wild-type ETB receptor exhibit similar functional responses (28Shyamala V. Moulthrop T.H. Stratton-Thomas J. Tekamp-Olson P. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 285-296PubMed Google Scholar, 30Nambi P., Wu, H.L., Ye, D. Gagnon A. Elshourbagy N. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 292: 247-253PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the variant with a different amino acid sequence at the C4 domain results in alterations in the cytoplasmic domain that reduce the capability of the cell to conduct signal transduction (29Elshourbagy N.A. Adamou J.E. Gagnon A.W., Wu, H.L. Pullen M. Nambi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25300-25307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, alternative RNA splicing may play a functional role by generating physiologically diverse receptor activities (29Elshourbagy N.A. Adamou J.E. Gagnon A.W., Wu, H.L. Pullen M. Nambi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25300-25307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The skipping of a 134-bp stretch of DNA corresponding to exon 5 would result in the synthesis of smaller ETB polypeptides, with an entirely different polypeptide sequence starting at the C3 domain. Because the intracellular carboxyl-terminal domain of the seven-helix transmembrane receptors is critical for G protein coupling and functional responses (1Kedzierski R.M. Yanagisawa M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 851-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 2Rubanyi G.M. Polokoff M.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 325-415PubMed Google Scholar), the smaller polypeptide translated from the splice variant described here might exhibit a severe functional impairment, if expressed stably in vivo.A substantial number of ETB clones were also found which contained an A to G conversion at nucleotide position 950 in exon 4, resulting in an amino acid change from glutamine to arginine (Q/R conversion).

We postulated that sequence divergence in the loop structures between these two enzymes mediated the unique substrate and inhibitor interactions of plasmin. Recombinant microplasminogens chimerized with factor D sequences at loops 3, 5, and 7 were cleaved by the plasminogen activator urokinase and developed titratable active sites. Chimerization abolished functional interactions with the plasminogen activator streptokinase but did not block complex formation. The microplasmin chimeras showed enhanced resistance (ki decreased up to two to three times) to inactivation of microplasmin by α2-antiplasmin. Microplasmin chimerization had minimal (∼2 fold) effects on the catalytic efficiency for cleavage of small substrates and did not alter the cleavage of fibrin. However, microplasmin and the microplasmin chimeras showed enhanced abilities to degrade fibrin in plasma clots suspended in human plasma. These studies indicate that loop regions of the protease domain of plasmin are important for interactions with substrates, regulatory molecules, and inhibitors. Because modification of these regions affected substrate and inhibitor interactions, loop chimerization may hold promise for improving the clot dissolving properties of this enzyme.

Plasmin and its proenzyme plasminogen (Pg)1 also play important roles in cell migration, tissue remodeling, and bacterial invasion (1Parry M.A. Zhang X.C. Bode I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 53-59Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The function of plasmin and Pg are regulated through protein interactions with plasminogen activators (such as staphylokinase and streptokinase), substrates (such as fibrin), inhibitors (such as α2-antiplasmin), receptors, and other molecules. Glu-Pg, the physiologic form of Pg, contains an NH2-terminal segment, five kringle domains, and a protease domain. The kringle domains are known to play an important role in mediating protein-protein interactions, but the contribution of the protease domain to these interactions is not well understood. However, recent insights into the three-dimensional structure of the protease domain of plasmin (microplasmin) and of related serine proteases such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, and factor D provide structural hypotheses about the intimate contact sites in plasmin that may interact with plasminogen activators, fibrin, and α2-antiplasmin (2Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 3Parry M.A. Fernandez-Catalan C. Bergner A. Huber R. Hopfner K.P. Schlott B. Guhrs K.H. Bode W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 917-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The major physiologic substrate of plasmin is fibrin. Indeed, crystal structure analysis has suggested that the substrate cleft of plasmin is elongated to accommodate the structure of fibrin (1Parry M.A. Zhang X.C. Bode I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 53-59Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The primary inhibitor of plasmin in the blood is the serpin α2-antiplasmin (4Moroi M. Aoki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5956-5965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Mullertz S. Clemmensen I. Biochem. J. 1976; 159: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Both fibrin and α2-antiplasmin interact with the kringle domains of plasmin, but their contact sites with the protease domain are poorly understood. Streptokinase and staphylokinase are bacterial cofactors that complex with plasmin and convert plasmin from an enzyme that cleaves fibrin to an enzyme that cuts or “activates” Pg. Among the plasminogen activators, these two proteins appear to have the most extensive contacts with the protease domains of Pg and plasmin. In the staphylokinase-microplasmin complex, microplasmin retains its susceptibility to inhibition by α2-antiplasmin (6Collen D. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Conversely, in the streptokinase-microplasmin complex, microplasmin is resistant to inhibition by α2-antiplasmin (2Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Taken together, these experimental results and analysis of x-ray crystallographic structures of staphylokinase-microplasmin and streptokinase-microplasmin define the surfaces of microplasmin that may interact with these cofactors and that may be necessary for interaction with α2-antiplasmin. The protease domain of plasmin (microplasmin) shares extensive sequence and structural homology with other serine protease domains such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, and factor D (7Peisach E. Wang J. de los Santos T. Reich E. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11180-11188Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In vitro, trypsin and chymotrypsin cleave fibrin and are inhibited by α2-antiplasmin, much like plasmin. Factor D, which is essential for the formation of the C3 convertase of the alternative pathway of complement activation, does not interact with fibrin or α2-antiplasmin. Still, the three-dimensional structures of these four serine proteases are highly conserved with a root mean square deviation between microplasmin and factor D structures of 1.06 angstroms squared (7Peisach E. Wang J. de los Santos T. Reich E. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11180-11188Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The differences among these protease structures are primarily in the loop regions of the enzymes, which suggests that divergences in these sequences are responsible for selective interactions of these proteases with substrates and inhibitors. To examine this hypothesis we chimerized specific loops of microplasmin with the corresponding structural elements of factor D and then determined whether these structures affected interactions of microplasmin with fibrin and plasminogen activators. Chimerization provides a strategy for examining structure-function relationships, with a low risk of fundamentally altering protein conformation, by swapping elements from a structurally homologous but functionally different molecule. Microplasminogen was chimerized with the corresponding loop sequences of factor D by the polymerase chain reaction with overlap extension. The microplasminogen and factor D sequences are listed in Table I with the appropriate PCR primers. The PCR products were sequenced on both strands to confirm the target mutations, and the recombinant microplasminogens were ligated into pET11d for bacterial expression (8Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab The molar quantities of the active sites in the recombinant microplasmins were determined at 37 °C in a Hitachi 2500 fluorescence spectrophotometer by active site titration with the fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferylp-guanidinobenzoate (Sigma) as described (9Reed G.L. Lin L.F. Parhami-Seren B. Kussie P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10266-10271Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, all of the experiments were performed with equivalent amounts of active protein based on this titration data. The amidase kinetic parameters of the microplasmins were determined by measuring the cleavage of the paranitroanilide substrate S2251 (Chromogenix) at 405 nm. Microplasmins (20 nm) and assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) were placed in a quartz cuvette at 37 °C, and various concentrations of S2251 (0.50–4.0 mm) were added to obtain a final volume of 300 μl. The change in absorbance was measured at 405 nm for 5 min at 37 °C in a thermostatted Cary 100-Bio spectrophotometer. The data were plotted asV/S and analyzed by hyperbolic curve fitting using a Sigma Plot program as described (10Sazonova I.Y. Houng A.K. Chowdhry S.A. Robinson B.R. Hedstrom L. Reed G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12609-12613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Microplasminogens (50 nm) were mixed with urokinase (1 unit) and added to microtiter plate wells containing 0.5 mm S2251 in assay buffer. The conversion of plasminogen to plasmin was detected by monitoring the cleavage of S2251 for 20 min at 37 °C. To test active complex formation by streptokinase, a stoichiometric microplasminogen-streptokinase complex (50 nm) was formed in assay buffer. Active complex formation was also tested using staphylokinase in excess to create a 50 nmmicroplasminogen-staphylokinase complex and monitored as before. The binding of the microplasminogens to streptokinase was studied in microtiter plates. The microplasminogens (25 μl, 20 μg/ml) or no protein (control) were adsorbed on microtiter plates for 1 h. The nonspecific protein binding was blocked by 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. After washing, an anti-plasminogen monoclonal antibody (Ab 340-11) was added for 1 h. The bound antibody was detected by 125I-labeled sheep antimouse Ab (50,000 cpm) followed by γ-counting. The binding of microplasminogens to streptokinase was also studied in a microtiter plate. Streptokinase (10 μg/ml, 25 μl) was adsorbed to the microtiter plate for 1 h and blocked as before with 1% bovine serum albumin, and the microplasminogens (25 μl, 20 μg/ml) or no microplasminogen (control) was added to the wells for 1 h. The bound primary antibody was detected by 125I-labeled sheep antimouse Ab (50,000 cpm) followed by γ-counting as before. Wild type or mutant microplasmins (20 nm) were added to cuvettes containing S2251 (0.5 mm) in assay buffer, and the change in absorbance at 405 nm was recorded at 0.3-min intervals prior to and after the addition of human α2-antiplasmin (120 nm, Calbiochem) as described (11Cederholm-Williams S.A., De Cock F. Lijnen H.R. Collen D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 100: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The rate constant ki of the reaction between the chimeras and α2-antiplasmin was calculated, and residual enzyme concentration was plotted as described (11Cederholm-Williams S.A., De Cock F. Lijnen H.R. Collen D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 100: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Fresh frozen human plasma (100 μl) was mixed with trace amounts of125I-fibrinogen and clotted with CaCl2 (20 mm) and thrombin (5 μl, 0.05 unit) for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing in 1 ml of Tris-buffered saline with 10 μmd-phenylalanyl-l-propyl-l-arginine chloromethyl ketone to inhibit residual thrombin, the clots were suspended in 50 μl plasma as supernatant. In “synchronous” experiments, the mutant microplasminogens (50 μl, 0–1 μm) were added to the clots followed by 5 units of urokinase. In “preactivation” experiments, 25 units of urokinase (an appropriate catalytic molar ratio that also achieved low background fibrinolysis) was incubated with the microplasminogens (1 μm, 250 μl) for 1 h at 37 °C. After activation various concentrations (50 μl, 0–1 μm) of the microplasmins were added to the clots. After an incubation of 5–6 h, the amount of the residual clot was measured by γ-counting, and the fractional fibrinolysis was determined as described (12Reed G.L. Matsueda G.R. Haber E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1114-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Fibrinogen (5 μl, 20 mg/ml from American Diagnostica) was mixed with trace amounts of125I-fibrinogen and clotted by the addition of CaCl2 (2.5 μl, 0.4 m) and thrombin (2.5 μl, 1 unit/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. In synchronous experiments, the mutant microplasminogens (200 μl) were added to the clots as supernatant followed by the addition of 5 units of urokinase to activate the microplasminogens. In preactivation experiments urokinase (100 units, which was sufficient to fully activate the microplasminogens) was added to the microplasminogens (1 μm, 500 μl) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Serial dilutions were performed, and the activated microplasminogens (0–1 μm, 200 μl) were then added to the clot. The residual clot was measured at 5–6 h by γ-counting, and the fractional fibrinolysis was determined as above. The interaction of factor D with α2-antiplasmin was determined using a standard assay for factor D activity (13Green G.D. Shaw E. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 93: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Factor D (final concentration, 20 nm) and 5,5′-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) (final concentration, 0.13 mm) were added to Tris buffer (100 mm, pH 8.0) and incubated at 37 °C for 3 min. Then Z-Lys-SBzl (Enzyme Systems Products) was added (final concentration, 20 mm) to start the reaction, and the absorbance was measured at 412 nm at 0.3-min intervals prior to and after the addition of α2-antiplasmin (100 nm) (13Green G.D. Shaw E. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 93: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The data were plotted as residual enzyme concentrations versus time. In the crystal structures, streptokinase is projected to interact with microplasmin at loops 3 and 5–7, whereas staphylokinase interacts only with loop 7. Through these interactions streptokinase renders plasmin unable to cleave fibrin and resistant to inhibition by α2-antiplasmin (2Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 3Parry M.A. Fernandez-Catalan C. Bergner A. Huber R. Hopfner K.P. Schlott B. Guhrs K.H. Bode W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 917-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This suggests that these particular loop structures may be very important for these interactions. Corresponding to the functional differences between microplasmin and factor D, there are notable differences in the sequences of these loops between these two molecules (Fig.1). For example loop 7 of factor D is longer than loop 7 of microplasmin and shows a different electrostatic potential. Negatively charged clusters are seen in factor D, and positively charged clusters seen in microplasminogen. Loop 3 of factor D lacks negatively charged residues, whereas microplasminogen has an arginine present. Loop 5 of factor D has similarities with microplasminogen with the notable difference in overall charge (positive versus negative, respectively). Loop 6 of factor D is also similar to microplasmin, although the overall charge of factor D is different (positive). To examine the contribution of these structures to mediating interactions of microplasmin, loop chimeras were created. The chimeras were expressed in bacteria, purified, and refolded to obtain active protein. The plasminogen activator urokinase is a serine protease that directly cleaves plasminogen to create plasmin. Each microplasminogen was treated with various amounts of urokinase for different lengths of time to determine the amount of active protein by active site titration with the fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl p-guanidinobenzoate (not shown). Wild type microplasminogen and the loop 3 and 5 chimeric microplasminogens were more readily cleaved by urokinase than was the loop 7 chimera (Fig. 2A). Following cleavage by urokinase, wild type microplasminogen and the loop 3, 5, and 7 chimeric microplasminogens developed amidolytic activity with a plasmin-selective substrate S2251 (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the loop 6 chimera was not cleaved by urokinase (Fig. 2A) even after prolonged incubation and never developed proteolytic activity (Fig. 2B). This suggested that it may not be refolded to active protein. Molecular modeling of the crystal structure predicted that loops 3, 5, and 7 of microplasmin are involved in interactions with streptokinase in the activator complex. Consistent with these observations, all three loop mutants were not efficiently activated by the bacterial plasminogen activator streptokinase (Fig. 2C). Because complex formation with microplasminogen is required for activation by streptokinase, the binding of streptokinase to these domains was examined with a monoclonal antibody directed to the protease domain (340-11). When compared with wells containing no microplasminogen, monoclonal Ab 340-11 showed specific binding to each chimeric microplasminogen (Fig. 3A), although it bound with less avidity to the loop 3 and 7 chimeras. This permitted the use of the monoclonal Ab to examine microplasminogen binding to immobilized streptokinase in a similar assay. When compared with control (no microplasminogen), all microplasminogen chimeras bound to streptokinase (Fig. 3B) in a pattern that simulated the binding of microplasminogen alone (Fig. 3A). Thus, the failure of streptokinase to activate these microplasminogen chimeras was not simply due to the inability of these proteins to bind to each other. The ability of staphylokinase to activate the microplasminogen chimeras was tested to further understand the interaction of these loops with plasminogen activators. Unlike urokinase (Fig. 2B) or streptokinase (Fig. 2C), staphylokinase was unable to efficiently activate the wild type microplasminogen (Fig.2D). Staphylokinase was unable to activate the chimeric microplasminogens, although it was able to efficiently activate Glu-plasminogen (Fig. 2D). This result indicates the importance of kringle domains in the staphylokinase mechanism of activation. Chimerization had modest effects on the kinetic parameters of the mutant microplasmins when compared with wild type microplasmin (TableII). Chimerization of loop 3 did not significantly alter the kinetics of amidolysis compared with wild type microplasmin. Chimerization of loop 7 slightly reduced catalytic efficiency by ∼2-fold. The loop 5 chimera displayed an increasedKm (∼3-fold) and a decreased catalytic efficiency (∼2-fold).Table IIKinetic parameters for amidolysisEnzyme microplasmin typeAmidolytic parameters2-aExperiments were carried out at 37 °C in a total volume of 300 μl, and kinetic parameters were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The values represent the means ± S.E.Kmkcatkcat/Kmμms−1μms−1Wild type2030 ± 28420.5 ± 1.50.010Loop 32920 ± 85035.2 ± 5.10.012Loop 55980 ± 85227.0 ± 2.50.005Loop 73310 ± 70517.5 ± 3.70.0052-a Experiments were carried out at 37 °C in a total volume of 300 μl, and kinetic parameters were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The values represent the means ± S.E. Open table in a new tab Under these experimental conditions, factor D was resistant to the inhibitory effects of the serine protease inhibitor α2-antiplasmin, whereas wild type microplasmin was rapidly inhibited (Fig.4; ki = 19,900 ± 430m−1 s−1). Chimerization with factor D loops altered the resistance of microplasmin to α2-antiplasmin. The loop 5 (ki = 7780 ± 270 m−1 s−1) and loop 7 (ki = 6131 ± 440m−1 s−1) chimeras were 2–3-fold more resistant to inhibition than wild type microplasminogen. The loop 3 mutant also displayed reduced kinetics of inhibition (ki = 14800 ± 900 m−1s−1) when compared with wild type microplasminogen. Experiments were performed to investigate the effect of chimerization on the interactions of microplasmin with fibrin, its chief physiologic substrate. When microplasminogens were preactivated to plasmin and added to fibrin clots in the absence of inhibitor, plasmin was more effective in fibrinolysis than wild type microplasmin. However, there was no discernible difference between wild type and chimeric microplasmins in the efficiency of fibrinolysis. When Glu-plasminogen and the microplasminogens were added to fibrin clots with urokinase, Glu-plasminogen was the most potent fibrinolytic agent, and the chimeras were similar to wild type microplasminogen in their ability to cleave fibrin (Fig.5B). Thus, introduction of the loop mutations did not alter the ability of the chimeras to cleave fibrin. Normally fibrinolysis occurs in plasma or blood that contains Glu-plasminogen, α2-antiplasmin, and other inhibitors of plasmin. Consequently we examined the effect of chimerization on fibrinolysis of human clots in human plasma. When Glu-plasminogen and the recombinant microplasminogens were preactivated with urokinase and added to human plasma clots, the pattern of fibrinolysis (Fig.5C) was opposite to that seen with fibrin clots (Fig.5A). Recombinant wild type microplasminogen was ∼2-fold more potent than Glu-plasminogen in achieving equivalent lysis (Fig.5C). The loop 3, 5, and 7 chimeras were up to 3-fold more potent than Glu-plasminogen and up to 1.5-fold more potent than wild type microplasminogen. When the different plasminogens were added to plasma with urokinase, a similar pattern was seen, but the differences between the microplasminogens (wild type and mutants) and Glu-plasminogen were more marked (5–6-fold; Fig. 5D). The serine proteases have unique biological functionsin vivo despite the extraordinary structural conservation of their protease domains. We postulated that the differences in biological activity between plasmin and factor D were due in part to sequence divergences in the flexible loops of the catalytic domains that target the function of these proteases to specific sites and substrates. The major goal of these studies was to understand the contribution of some of these structural elements to the interactions of the protease domain of plasmin with streptokinase, fibrin and α2-antiplasmin. Loops 3 and 5–7 of microplasminogen are shielded from solution when plasmin forms a complex with streptokinase, whereas only loop 7 is shielded in the staphylokinase-microplasmin complex (2Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 3Parry M.A. Fernandez-Catalan C. Bergner A. Huber R. Hopfner K.P. Schlott B. Guhrs K.H. Bode W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 917-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The fact that streptokinase but not staphylokinase modifies the ability of plasmin to interact with fibrin and α2-antiplasmin suggested that these loops may participate in substrate and inhibitor interactions. Plasmin is inhibited by α2-antiplasmin in two steps: 1) a very fast reversible second order reaction and 2) a slower irreversible first order reaction (14Wiman B. Boman L. Collen D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 87: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although the first step in this reaction involves interactions between the kringle domains of plasmin and the carboxyl terminus of α2-antiplasmin, the structural interactions of the protease domain in the second step are not understood. Our studies indicated that chimerization of loops 5 and 7, and to a lesser extent loop 3, reduced the ability of α2-antiplasmin to inhibit microplasmin. This provided the first experimental evidence that structural elements in the protease domain are important for the interactions of these two molecules. We postulated that these loop residues may be integral for the proper alignment and positioning of α2-antiplasmin with respect to the catalytic triad. Chimerization may have altered intermolecular contacts between plasmin-α2-antiplasmin by deleting critical residues, altering residue charge, or creating steric interference. The recent crystal structure of the α1-antitrypsin-trypsin complex provides a model for the interactions between plasmin and α2-antiplasmin. It reveals that the homologous loops 3, 5, and 7 of trypsin are in contact with α1-antitrypsin in the protease complex (15Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Thus, the equivalent loops of microplasmin may be predicted to have similar interactions with its primary inhibitor α2-antiplasmin. Assuming that a similar serpin-protease reaction occurs between microplasmin and α2-antiplasmin, the crystallographic data of the α1-antitrypsin-trypsin complex may in part explain how the chimeras gained resistance to α2-antiplasmin inhibition through disruption of residues required by microplasmin for recognition of α2-antiplasmin. The inhibition of plasmin by α2-antiplasmin also parallels the inhibition of two-chain tissue plasminogen activator by plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (16Madison E.L. Goldsmith E.J. Gerard R.D. Gething M.J. Sambrook J.F. Nature. 1989; 339: 721-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Mutation of positively charged residues 296–302 made tissue plasminogen activator nearly 95% resistant to inhibition by plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 and enhanced the fibrinolytic activity of this molecule in vitro(17Keyt B.A. Paoni N.F. Refino C.J. Berleau L. Nguyen H. Chow A. Lai J. Pena L. Pater C. Ogez J. Etcheverry T. Botstein D. Bennett W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3670-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). These residues correspond to the equivalent loop 3 structure in plasminogen. In our studies chimerization of loop 3 had only mild effects on reducing the inhibition of microplasmin by α2-antiplasmin, suggesting that this is not a major site of interaction between these two molecules. These studies provide biochemical evidence for the role of loops 3, 5, and 7 in activator complex formation with streptokinase. Although streptokinase formed a complex with all three chimeras (Fig.3), it was unable to generate an active site in plasminogen. In contrast, another plasminogen activator, urokinase, cleaved each of the loop chimeras to plasmin. The effects of the loop 3 chimera in disrupting interactions with streptokinase are particularly notable because this represented a comparatively conservative change in microplasmin with deletion of Arg582 and substitution of homologous residues. In the loop 3 chimera of our study Thr581 was mutated to Leu. Moreover, in the structure of the microplasmin with streptokinase, loop 3 interacts with the β domain, which compared with the α and γ domains of streptokinase has comparatively few intermolecular contacts (2Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Wang and Reich (18Wang J. Reich E. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1768-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) found that deletion of Thr581 in loop 3 also caused a loss of streptokinase-microplasmin complex activity. In the streptokinase-microplasmin structure loop 5 also contacts the β domain, and molecular modeling suggests that within this loop Arg610 has important interactions with streptokinase. Finally, chimerization introduces a large insertion into loop 7, so that steric factors along with an increase in negatively charged residues may contribute to abolition of the ability to form a functional activator complex. The role of the loop mutations in forming an activator complex with staphylokinase could not be evaluated under the conditions of these experiments because staphylokinase, though it efficiently activated Glu-Pg (the physiologic form of Pg), showed no significant ability to activate microplasminogen (even after 8 h of incubation; Fig.2D). Molecular modeling would suggest, however, that loop chimeras 3 and 5 would be similar to wild type microplasmin in their ability to form a Pg activator because these loops are not in contact with the staphylokinase molecule in the activator complex. Chimerization did not significantly affect the ability of microplasmin to cleave fibrin. Wild type and chimeric microplasminogens had equivalent fibrinolytic effects, either when added with urokinase to fibrin clots or when preactivated by urokinase and then added to fibrin clots. In the same experiments, greater fibrinolysis was obtained with Glu-Pg and urokinase; this probably reflects enhanced fibrin targeting by the kringle domains (19Wiman B. Wallen P. Thromb. Res. 1977; 10: 213-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 20Wiman B. Lijnen H.R. Collen D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 579: 142-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). However, when fibrinolytic experiments were performed in the presence of plasma, which contains α2-antiplasmin and other inhibitors, the opposite result was obtained. Wild type and chimeric microplasminogens were significantly more effective than Glu-plasminogen as fibrinolytic agents, particularly when the plasminogens and urokinase were added to plasma together. This probably reflects the slower inhibition by α2-antiplasmin of microplasmin, which lacks kringle domains. The fact that microplasmin(ogen) was more potent than Glu-plasmin(ogen) when activated in plasma (Fig. 5D) than when preactivated and added to plasma (Fig. 5C) suggests that microplasminogen may be a more efficient substrate for urokinase than Glu-Pg (21Wohl R.C. Summaria L. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2005-2013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The increased potency of the chimeric microplasminogens was due at least in part to the enhanced resistance of these chimeras to α2-antiplasmin. However, the superior potency of the loop 3 chimera, which displayed less resistance to α2-antiplasmin than the other chimeras, suggests that other factors such as differential rates of plasminogen activation, variable resistance to α2-macroglobulin, enhanced stability in plasma, etc., may play a role in affecting fibrinolysis by these molecules. In conclusion these experiments provide evidence that loop structures in the protease domain specifically modulate the functional interactions of microplasmin(ogen) with certain regulatory molecules. Further analysis is likely to reveal additional sites of interaction of plasmin with key substrates, inhibitors, and regulatory molecules. Molecular manipulation of these sites may provide a rational approach to improve the therapeutic value of plasmin for treating thrombotic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2035855035,"Catalytic antibodies have emerged as being without peer as rationally designed biocatalysts. They have been shown to catalyze an ever-increasing array of chemical reactions with both high substrate specificity and selectivity. Probing the immune repertoire, via an expanding number of techniques, has lead to the production of proteins that can catalyze chemistry that is both difficult to perform using existing chemical methods and that is not catalyzed by endogenous enzymes. Remarkably, recent evidence has pointed to a hitherto unknown catalytic function of all antibodies that seems to be intrinsic to their immunoglobulin structure, the conversion of 1O2* into H2O2. This new catalytic potential of antibodies points to a new 'chemical arm' of the immune system and reveals that the evolution of catalytic antibodies significantly predates their rational design."
