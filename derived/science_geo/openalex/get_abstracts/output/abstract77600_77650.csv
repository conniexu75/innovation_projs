https://openalex.org/W1576127641,"A method for the rapid modification under mild conditions of carboxyl groups in proteins has been developed. The method involves the activation of the carboxyl group by a water-soluble carbodiimide and the subsequent reaction of the activated carboxyl group with a nucleophile such as glycine methyl ester. The kinetics of the reaction indicates that there are limits to the variation of carbodiimide and nucleophile when quantitative modification is desired, but that a wide variety of reagents can be used if quantitative reaction is not essential. Thus, variation in the structure of the carbodiimide can affect the carboxyl groups activated, and variation in the charge, size, and chemical and spectral properties of the nucleophile can alter the type of modification at a specific carboxyl group. The reaction proceeds equally well in high concentrations of urea or guanidine hydrochloride. The method appears to be of wide utility for analytical purposes and structure-function correlations."
https://openalex.org/W1558399150,"Abstract A rapid method for the preparation of crystalline 5'-adenylic acid deaminase from rabbit skeletal muscle is presented. The enzyme remains bound to cellulose phosphate under conditions at which apparently no other proteins are bound; thus it was possible to develop, in essence, a one-step method for its purification. The crystalline preparation is homogeneous as indicated by its elution profile, by ultracentrifugation, and by acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The new method results in enzyme that has 5 times the specific activity of the previously reported crystalline preparation and differs in stability and kinetic properties. The enzyme is stable in dilute solution for extended periods at room temperature provided the diluting medium is of high ionic strength and contains β-mercaptoethanol. The enzyme follows normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to adenosine monophosphate concentration when assayed in the presence of KCl, and with respect to potassium concentration. Sodium and potassium, at 0.15 m, function equally efficiently as cation activators."

The present report establishes the occurrence of an ezymatic defect in this infant. His liver, brain, and kidney specifically lacked sulfite oxidase activity. Deficiency of sulfite oxidase, which has not apparently been described in man, provides a reasonable explanation for the abnormalities in this infant."
https://openalex.org/W1997062481,"Electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve in intact or pancreatectomized rabbits resulted in a marked increase, within 5 minutes of the onset of stimulation, in the total activity of liver glycogen synthetase. The effect was completely counteracted by simultaneous stimulation of the splanchnic nerve, although stimulation of the splanchnic nerve alone had little effect on the enzyme. Injection of insulin caused an increase in both the total activity of glycogen synthetase and the activity that was independent of glucose-6-phosphate. The response of the enzyme to vagal stimulation was much faster than to administration of insulin."

https://openalex.org/W2024966234,"Mitochondrial DNA of Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains a satellite DNA (density, 1.682) that appears to exist as open-ended filaments at least 5 microns long. DNA from intact cells contains circular filaments whose lengths vary from 0.5 to 7 microns, with a great majority at 1.95 microns. The circular DNA has a density similar to that of the major nuclear peak (1.697). When heat-denatured mitochondrial-satellite DNA is renatured, it cross-links to form a molecule that is larger than the native molecule. The formation of cross-links results in hypersharpening of the density profiles in cesium chloride and also leads to failure to pass Millipore filter paper."
https://openalex.org/W1480679012,"This report describes the catalytic properties of seven homogeneous peroxidase isozymes. The catalytic properties of each isozyme were determined in a peroxidatic reaction with the use of o-dianisidine as the substrate, and in an oxidatic reaction with the use of oxalacetate as the substrate. Each isozyme was capable of catalyzing the oxidation of both substrates and they exhibited identical cofactor requirements. The time course for each isozyme was identical except for Isozyme A-3, which was inactivated rapidly in the peroxidatic reaction. Isozymes A-1, A-2, and A-3 possessed similar catalytic properties and were classified into one group. The remaining isozymes, B, C, D, and E, also possessed similar catalytic properties and were classified into another group. The two groups of isozymes, however, showed marked differences in pH optima, specific activities, apparent Km values, and affinity toward inhibitors."

A pair of thermodes were implanted across the preoptic region of the brain stem, and a reentrant tube for a thermocouple was implanted in the brain stem. Heating the brain stem to 41 degrees C activated the exit response from the hot environment at a colonic temperature 1 degrees to 2 degrees C lower than normal, whereas cooling the brain stem to 25 degrees C delayed the exit from the hot environment until the colonic temperature was 1 degrees to 2 degrees C higher than normal. The behavioral thermoregulatory responses of this ectotherm appear to be activated by a combination of hypothalamic and other body temperatures."

https://openalex.org/W1496052054,"Studies of the circular dichroism of the α and β subunits of hemoglobin have shown that while their helix contents are the same as that of hemoglobin A, the intensities of the heme bands at 260 and 410 mµ are much greater for the α than for the β chains. In both spectral regions, the molar intensity for hemoglobin A is simply the sum of the intensities of the isolated chains. The ellipticities associated with the 260 mµ band are strongly influenced by the attached ligand. A smaller band of opposite sign is observed at 285 mµ in deoxyhemoglobin A but is absent in both deoxygenated subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1498479340,"Abstract The differences in the physicochemical and electron transfer properties of the multiple forms of bovine heart cytochrome c, Cy I to Cy IV, provide a means of correlating substitutions of aspartyl or glutamyl residues for asparaginyl or glutaminyl residues in the polypeptide chain with the conformation of this heme protein, as well as a new aspect in the study of the relation between its structure and function. The differences in light absorption spectra (at 25° and -190°) and optical rotatory dispersion, as well as in circular dichroic absorption spectra, of the multiple forms indicate that they differ in conformation, and that Cy I represents the native form. This, coupled with the fact that the oxidation-reduction potentials of the various forms are different, indicates that the environment of the heme group, i.e. the hemeprotein interaction, has been affected in Cy II and Cy III. Evidence is presented in support of a difference in conformation in the ferrous as well as in the ferric form, although the difference is clearer in the latter form. The different forms are slowly oxidized by molecular oxygen (278 µm) at neutral pH; the first order rate constant increases in the order Cy I l Cy II l Cy III, and numerically by about 3 times (from 3.0 x 10-5 to 8.3 x 10-5 sec-1). The different forms are reduced by ascorbate at pH 7.0 in a second order reaction. The rate constants decrease in the order Cy I g Cy II g Cy III and numerically by about 3 times (from 7.9 to 2.8 m-1 sec-1). The different forms are all able to restore succinate oxidation in mitochondria depleted of endogeneous cytochrome c. However, they are not isokinetic. Athough the V'max values are essentially the same, the K'm values for cytochrome c increase in the order Cy I l Cy II l Cy III and numerically by about 5.5 times (from 2.9 to 15.9 µm). The results put into perspective earlier studies on various chemically and enzymically modified forms of cytochrome c, and support the view that certain asparagine and glutamine residues are important to achieve the conformation and the biological activity characteristic of native mammalian cytochrome c."

The electron carriers participating in this process are ferredoxin and cytochrome c3. Ferredoxin accepts the electrons from the pyruvic dehydrogenase complex whereas cytochrome c3 does not. However, combining the two carriers, in the clastic system, results in a maximum production of molecular hydrogen and acetyl phosphate. Although both ferredoxin and cytochrome c3 are capable of donating electrons to the hydrogenase of D. sulfuricans, it is believed that a sequential transfer of electrons from the pyruvic dehydrogenase system to the hydrogenase is operating; the sequence is pyruvic dehydrogenase → ferredoxin → cytochrome c3 → hydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W1491091649,"Abstract The physiological disposition of single intravenous injections of biologically active 131I-labeled insulin of high specific activity containing an average of 0.8 atom of total iodine per molecule of insulin (mol wt 6000) and of biologically inactive 131I-insulin containing an average of 6 atoms of iodine per molecule were compared in the rat over a 3-hour interval at two dose levels: tracer or physiological levels (50 to 100 microunits/100 g of rat body weight), and large or pharmacological levels (105 microunits/100 g of rat body weight). Trichloracetic acid (TCA)-precipitable radioactivity was considered to reflect intact insulin species, whereas TCA-soluble radioactivity was considered to reflect products of degradation. Analysis of the data was directed as much as possible at determining the role of fundamental processes such as diffusion, mechanisms of chemical reaction, and transport of species in the distribution of 131I-insulin and its reaction products in the body of the rat. The data obtained in this study have been interpreted as indicating that 131I-insulin species are exchanged between the plasma and various body compartments by unsteady state molecular diffusion processes in which the body compartments behave as semi-infinite homogeneous media. Superimposed on the diffusional processes are chemical reaction processes occurring in the liver and kidney, with both organs behaving as semibatch reactor systems with a critical volumetric capacity, which must be achieved before significant reaction occurs, of about 3.7 per cent of the injected 131I dose per g of organ. The degradation of 131I species in the liver and kidney appears to occur by a reaction which is second order with respect to the reactant species. Both TCA-soluble and TCA-precipitable species of biologically active 131I-insulin are degraded in the liver and kidney. Apparent reaction rate constants in the liver are 0.065 and 0.080 (%)-1 (min)-1 for TCA-precipitable and TCA-soluble species, respectively; for the kidney the rate constants are 0.030 and 0.014 (%)-1 (min)-1 for TCA-precipitable and TCA-soluble species, respectively. (The symbol, (%), denoted percentage of injected dose of 131I.) In contrast, biologically inactive 131I-insulin species appear not to be degraded by the liver and kidney. Present data suggest that the heavily iodinated, biologically inactive 131I-insulin diffuses into and out of the kidney and liver with little, if any, chemical reaction. The major muscle mass is indicated to behave as a capacitor which accepts 131I-insulin species from the plasma when plasma concentrations are high and rejects material to the plasma, for transport to other organs and tissues, when plasma concentrations are low. The existence of degradation reactions in the muscle mass is neither confirmed nor denied by present data. Concentrations of biologically inactive 131I species in the plasma, liver, and kidney were found to be independent of dosage level. In contrast, clearance of biologically active, TCA-precipitable 131I from the plasma was found to be dosage level dependent, this dependence apparently arising from interaction of diffusion and reaction processes. Liver and kidney concentrations of biologically active species were, however, independent of dosage level. The simultaneous transport and reaction processes are indicated to be quite complex, so that quantitative description of them requires extensive mathematical modeling and data not yet available. A preliminary model based on the results of this study is suggested."

The action of this substance is different in the two cases. In D-neurons, this compound increases the permeability of the subsynaptic or somatic membrane to chloride ions, and through a net efflux of this anion, depolarizes the cell. In CILDA neurons, on the other hand, acetylcholine depolarzies the cell by increasing its permeability to sodium ions."

Greater responses occurred repeatedly for two of three subjects, both left-handed. when the stimululs appeared in the left field than in the right.

We conclude that the difference in amplitude between the two lobes is related to handedness."

A primary site of inhibitory action is the terminal step in this conversion—the reduction of desmosterol (24-dehydrocholesterol) to cholesterol. This is also the site at which these compounds inhibit de novo cholesterol biosynthesis in higher animals. Both agents severely inhibit growth and maturation of the tobacco hornworm."

https://openalex.org/W1588125159,"Abstract Human transferrin C and a genetic variant found by a starch gel electrophoresis screening program were purified and compared structurally. Isolation combined two bulk fractionations, with the use of rivanol and ammonium sulfate, with the more selective procedures of Sephadex G-100 gel filtration and diethylaminoethyl Sephadex A-50 ion exchange chromatography. Transferrin C and the variant were separated during the latter. The product obtained was homogeneous in the ultracentrifuge (s20,w = 5.1 S), in free boundary electrophoresis at several pH values (mobility = -3.03 and -3.63 units for apo- and ferritransferrins C, respectively, in pH 8.6 Veronal; isoelectric point, pI, of apotransferrin C = 5.5), in immunoelectrophoresis, and in starch gel electrophoresis. Amino acid analyses agreed with published data but failed to reveal differences between the two varieties. The peptide map of the Caucasian variant D-G.F. contains all the peptide spots seen in the map from transferrin C and a single additional spot not seen in the latter. The peptide is neutral at pH 6.5 and fails to stain for arginine, histidine, or tyrosine. This variant peptide is assumed to arise from one of two overlapping peptides, from the unresolved core, or from a peptide produced from two distinct parts of the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1630444982,"Abstract Porcine pancreatic elastase (pancreatopeptidase E) is readily inactivated by nitrous acid at 0°. At constant nitrous acid concentration the rate of inactivation shows a strong pH dependence; it increases about 20-fold between pH 4.2 and 3.0. The inactivation is directly correlated with the loss of the NH2-terminal valine residue. The loss of about 0.5 lysine residue, 3 tryptophan residues, and 1 tyrosine residue is independent of pH and not responsible for the inactivation. The pH dependence of the inactivation of the inactivation has been interpreted as follows. Above pH 4.2 the NH2-terminal group is inaccessible to the reagent; below this pH a reversible conformational change occurs, which involves the cooperative protonation of four carboxyl groups and leads to an increase in the reactivity. The rate of inactivation is proportional to the square of the nitrous acid concentration, which suggests that the reactive species of the reagent is probably N2O3. The elastase used was prepared by a modification of two published methods and was over 99% homogeneous, as determined by acrylamide gel electrophoresis."

https://openalex.org/W1585178517,Abstract Human serum albumin (HSA) has been allowed to react with varying amounts of iodine under mild conditions. Almost all of the tyrosyl residues of HSA may be converted to iodotyrosyl residues (primarily diiodotyrosyl) without producing significant changes in the conformation of the protein. Difference spectral measurements in urea show the disappearance of buried tyrosyl and the appearance of buried diiodotyrosyl residues; a difference spectral peak attributed to diiodotyrosyl residues in iodinated HSA is seen at 302 mµ. It is proposed that the partly nonaqueous environment of buried tyrosyl residues directs their preferential conversion to diiodotyrosyl residues.
https://openalex.org/W2084555032,"A protein from the salivary gland of mice has been highly purified. It affects embryonic muscle tissue in vitro and has both esterase and peptidase activities. Addition of the pure protein to tissue culture in synthetic medium causes dissociation of muscle fibers in individual myoblasts with loss of myosin. This biological activity, as well as the esterase activity, is inhibited by low concentrations of phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride; this suggests that the effect on the tissue is a consequence of the protein's enzymatic activities."

As controls, four cats were deprived of REM sleep for 12 days and one was deprived for 10 days; the controls received no convulsions. Compensatory increases in REM sleep during recovery days were present in the convulsed animals, but were substantially lower than the recovery increases of control animals. During recovery REM sleep, convulsed cats did not display the exaggerated bursts of eye movements and body twitches seen in the nonconvulsed controls."
https://openalex.org/W1543409461,"Thyroglobulin has been iodinated at pH 9.35 and the distribution of iodoamino acids has been determined. Iodination results in a decrease in the tyrcsyl and an increase in the diiodotyrosyl difference spectra peaks. The spectral changes indicate that tyrosyl groups, which are more or less shielded from the solvent, can also react with iodine. Based on recent model studies on the rates of iodination of N-acetyltyrosine and N-acetyliodotyrosine, it is suggested that the environment of the tyrosyl groups determines the relative amounts of monoiodotyrosine and diiodotyrosine that are synthesized. A functional role of the native form of the protein is thus envisioned in the control of the products formed by iodination."
https://openalex.org/W1980669625,"A new type of host-dependent mutant, azure mutant, of bacteriophage f2 has been isolated. Growth of these mutants was restricted specifically by amber suppressor genes in the host bacteria. Restriction of the formation of infective centers by different bacterial suppressor genes was 98 percent, 90 percent, and 70 percent with Su-3, Su-1, and Su-2 genes, respectively. Restriction, like suppression, was the dominant phenotype. The block in growth of the mutants occurred in an early stage of the infection cycle. Once infection was established, however, an infected cell produced approximately the same number of progeny phage as a cell without the suppressor genes did. It is proposed that the azure codon is the same as the amber codon (uracil, adenine, guanine) and that restriction results from improper termination of protein chains of the phage RNA polymerase. Similar mutants may exist in other systems."

https://openalex.org/W1589772649,"Abstract When human prothrombin is activated in 25% (weight per volume) sodium citrate, the apparent clotting and esterase activities of thrombin develop at equal rates and reach maximum levels in about 16 hours. Following this, the esterase activity remains stable, but over 90% of the fibrinogen-clotting activity disappears from the system during the next 500 hours. Chromatography of the 16-hour system yields a single protein peak containing 40% of the protein and all of the clotting and esterase activity of the activation system. Chromatography of the 500-hour system yields two protein peaks, the major one having essentially only esterase activity and a minor one which has principally clotting activity. This results in almost a 2-fold purification of the esterase fraction over that obtained by chromatography of the 16-hour system. Comparisons were made between the preparations having both clotting and esterase activity and those having only esterase or clotting activity. With respect to the elution volume on gel filtration, electrophoresis, and sedimentation properties, no differences were observed. All preparations behaved as essentially single components having an estimated molecular weight of 30,000 g, with no evidence of dissociation to enzymatically active smaller molecules. Titration experiments with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and diisopropyl fluorophosphate showed a striking difference between the preparations, however. In addition, the clotting preparation had a profound affect on the citrate activation of prothrombin, while the esterase preparation did not. The evidence thus obtained indicates that thrombin is similar to certain other estero-proteolytic enzyme systems in which the molecule can be modified so as to alter its relative activity toward ester and protein substrates. This is discussed in relation to various interpretations concerning the nature of the active center on the thrombin molecule, as well as the implications these findings may have on the factors believed necessary for the inception of blood coagulation."

Mixed micelles of N-(alpha)- mnyristoyl-L- histidine and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide catalyze the hydrolyses of p-nitrophenyl acetate and p-nitrophenyl caprylate at much higher rates than imidazole or histidinie do. The reaction shows a kinetic behavior similar to that of surface-catalyzed reactions.
https://openalex.org/W1584809211,"The oxidation-reduction equilibrium of human hemoglobin treated with various sulfhydryl reagents has been studied. The following modified hemoglobins have been characterized: hemoglobin treated with cystine, hemoglobin treated with cystamine, hemoglobin treated with iodoacetamide, and hemoglobin treated with 2 eq of p-mercuribenzoate. In all cases the modified hemoglobins have an oxidation-reduction potential which is more negative than normal hemoglobin (by about 15 to 30 mv) at pH 6, but about the same as normal hemoglobin at pH 9. The value of n in the oxidation-reduction equilibrium is much less sensitive to pH than in the case of normal hemoglobin, and is very near to 2 from pH 6 to 9. The titration potentiometric data have been substantiated by differential (acid-base) measurements. Moreover, some data on the kinetics of oxidation of the various modified hemoglobins by ferricyanide have been collected."

This enzyme preparation is the same preparation that previously has been shown to catalyze the incorporation of sugars into a microsomal glycosaminoglycan related to heparin. It is suggested that polysaccharide polymerization and sulfation take place in close proximity in the cell.
https://openalex.org/W2009115763,"The concept is suggested that the sodium pump mechanism is influenced by the transmembrane electrical potential, and that the pump acts to maintain a constant electrochemical gradient for sodium. Evidence leading to this suggestion was obtained in rat diaphragm muscle by altering systematically the transmembrane chemical gradient for sodium ions and the transmembrane voltage. The voltage changes were produced by varying the extracellular and intracellular potassium ion concentrations. In each case the intracellular sodium concentration changed, presumably by activity of the sodium pump, so that the total electrochemical gradient for sodium was restored."
https://openalex.org/W2086896711,"The size and number of aerial spray drops impinging on spruce budworm in its conifer forest habitat were determined by means of a new tracer method that uses fluorescent particles in a liquid spray. Examination of 1113 larvae affected by an experimental insecticide that had been applied to a 5000-acre (2024-ha) test area in Montana showed that 93 percent had not been contacted by any droplets larger than 50 micro in diameter. Small numbers of droplets 50 to 100 micro in diameter were found on 7 percent of the larvae, along with lethal numbers of smaller drops. No evidence was found that significant numbers of drops larger than 100 micro reached the target insects. Because about 95 percent of the spray applied to forests by current methods consist of droplets larger than 50 micro, the biologically effective portion of the drop spectrum is only a few percent. The data foreshadow a major potential reduction in insecticide requirements for the successful control of spruce budworm."

https://openalex.org/W1537599847,"During the larval stage of the honeybee there is an abrupt and very large elevation of glycogen content. Homogenates from larvae of high glycogen content have an active glycogen synthetase that is associated with the particulate glycogen fraction. Although the enzyme resembles mammalian glycogen synthetase in many of its properties there is at least one important difference. The enzyme bound with particulate glycogen of bee larvae, but not of mammals, is an active enzyme-substrate complex, since high rates of glucose incorporation are observed in the absence of added soluble primer. The main factor limiting incorporation of glucose into glycogen under the conditions of these experiments seems to be the length of outer branch chains in the primer. When this limit is reached, incorporation stops. Addition of glucose 6-phosphate causes incorporation to resume until a higher limit is attained. Two alternative interpretations of this effect are possible. Glucose 6-phosphate either changes the specificity of the enzyme for primer outer chains or activates a glucose 6-phosphate-dependent form of the enzyme that can utilize longer outer chains as effective priming units."

https://openalex.org/W1568331874,"Abstract Analysis of the optical rotatory dispersion of aldolase and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase reveals Cotton effects for both enzymes in the 270 to 300 mµ region. The nature of the Cotton effects of these two proteins has been investigated. In the case of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase the Cotton effect probably arises from the diphosphopyridine nucleotide and other compounds attached to the apoenzyme. In the case of aldolase a high content of aromatic amino acids is probably responsible for the Cotton effect. The effects of p-hydroxymercuribenzoate and denaturing agents such as acid, urea, and sodium dodecyl sulfate are reported. The above agents have different effects on the helical content of these proteins. All denaturing agents make the Cotton effects in the aromatic region disappear."
https://openalex.org/W1586714318,"Abstract The activity of the particulate glycogen synthetase of mouse liver was assayed at two different incubation temperatures, 25 and 37°. A 3- to 4-fold maximal activation is observed at 25° with orthophosphate or glucose 6-phosphate, and a similar activation is observed at 37° with orthophosphate. However, at the higher temperature glucose 6-phosphate causes an apparent 12- to 14-fold activation. Activity in the absence of activator is nearly 5 times as high at 25 as at 37°. The explanation is that heat inactivation occurs at the higher temperature, and glucose 6-phosphate protects the enzyme but orthophosphate does not. Thus the two effects of glucose 6-phosphate are separable. The calculated dissociation constant for activation by orthophosphate was 7.75 x 10-4 m, a value low enough for possible controlling effects of this anion on glycogen synthetase in vivo. Activation by either glucose 6-phosphate or orthophosphate increased the affinity of the enzyme for primer glycogen, possibly by allowing a greater number of outer branches to serve as priming units. The calculated Km for glycogen of the activator-dependent portion of enzyme activity was 50 times lower than that of the activator-independent activity. Glycogen extracted from the enzyme preparation by a cold water procedure, which has been shown to preserve the native structure of the polymer, was used by the enzyme much more efficiently than endogenous primer."
https://openalex.org/W1587080741,"Abstract The relatively specific inhibition of β-glucuronidase by cholesterol and retinol (vitamin A alcohol) has been studied. Both hydrolysis and transfer reactions are inhibited. The hydrolysis reaction is inhibited 70% by 1 x 10-4 m retinol and by 7.8 x 10-5 m cholesterol. Inhibition increases with concentration and approaches an asymptotic maximum. β-Glucuronidases tested from a wide variety of mammalian and nonmammalian sources were inhibited. Among known β-glucuronidase activators, deoxyribonucleic acid reversed inhibition about 50% while proteins had less effect. Inhibition was constant with time, was reversible upon dilution, was uncompetitive, and the inhibitions of retinol and cholesterol were not additive. Addition of α-tocopherol or ubiquinone did not affect inhibition. Glutamate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase, known to be inhibited by steroid hormones, were tested. Glutamate dehydrogenase is inhibited 50 and 64%, respectively, by cholesterol and retinol at 1 x 10-4m; and pyruvate kinase is not inhibited. Blood serum inhibits the enzyme and inhibition is correlated with serum levels of cholesterol found in normal and abnormal serum standards. It is suggested that the previously reported anti-glucuronidase of blood serum may be cholesterol and that inhibition of β-glucuronidase by cholesterol may occur in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1974799308,"A living, ammonia-obligate, umbellate form, similar to the Precambrian microfossil Kakabekia umbellata Barghoorn, has been isolated from two soil specimens collected at Harlech, Wales. This organism is amenable to culture on agar and in broth. The two soil specimens are similar in that they differ from a typical clay loam in high content of carbon, hydrogen, and organic nitrogen and low levels of sodium, potassium, and titanium. In all other constituents, such as calcium, magnesium, and iron, they are quite dissimilar. Kakabekia-like forms can be grown in glucose-anmonia media with the latter as the sole source of nitrogen, but they can also be grown on peptone and silicate in glucose-free media. Ammonia is necessary, and growth is always slow without glucose. The fission process was not observed, but the enlargement and differentiation of a preumbellate structure into its ""mature"" form, followed by disintegration (senescence) of this stage, was seem. An ontogeny is proposed in which the stalk and basal bulb of the complete umbellate structure are assumed to be part of the reproductive appartus."
https://openalex.org/W2018294999,Uptake of cesium-134 ions into muscle cells is reduced to very low values by the presence of 10(-5)M strophanthidin in the Ringer solution. Cesium ions can induce extrusion of sodium from muscle cells in which the intracellular sodium content is elevated. The cesium-induced extra efflux of sodium-22 is inhibited by the external presence of 10(-5)M strophanthidin. The coupling between inward movement of cesium and outward movement of sodium appears to be chemical in nature. The evidence suggests that cesium ions are transported into muscle cells by a system of sites or carriers that requires a source of metabolic energy for ion turnover to occur.
https://openalex.org/W1973139734,"After rapid multiple extractions of mouse plasma virus with ether, the aqueous solution contained viral nucleoids that were infectious when inoculated intracranially into newborn BALB/c mice. The infectivity associated with the ether extract was not neutralized by the specific antibody prepared against the whole virus. No intact virus has been seen in these preparations. Treatment with ether completely removed the virus envelope from the particle and produced an apparently homogeneous preparation of viral nucleoids. After the extractions with ether, leukemogenic activity was inactivated by exposure to ribonuclease. The leukemogenic activity of the many-passaged Rauscher virus that has been propagated in tissue culture and that has low infectivity was also retained, and, in two experiments in which material was inoculated intracranially into mice, this activity appeared to have been enhanced by multiple extractions with ether."
https://openalex.org/W2064509630,"The axial filament nerves of Vampyroteuthis infernalis are joined to two separate parts of the brain. One branch of the nerve, apparently efferent, arises from the anterior portion of the middle subesophageal mass, and the other, apparently afferent. enters the ventral magnocellular lobe. Since this innervation is entirely different from that of the arms, the filaments can no longer be considered homologous with the arms. The validity and primitive nature of the order Vampyromorpha, therefore, needs to be reexamined."
