https://openalex.org/W2001156705,"THE origin of the amniotic fluid proteins is at present a source of controversy. Existing information about these proteins, which has been derived mainly from paper electrophoresis1–6, immunoelectrophoresis7,8 and immuno-diffusion9, has divided investigators into those who believe that the amniotic fluid proteins arise from foetal serum and those who consider that their origin is maternal. A recent article10 has shown, by a combination of acrylamide disc electrophoresis and immuiiodiffusion, that the proteins of the amniotic fluid originate at least partly from maternal serum. It was found that haptoglobin 1–1 was present in all amniotic fluids derived from mothers of this type, while it was absent in the corresponding cord sera. Immunoglobulin A was also present only in amniotic fluids and corresponding maternal sera and absent in cord sera. In addition, transferrin and ceruloplasmin values approximated those of the maternal rather than those of foetal sera."

https://openalex.org/W2001481812,"SEX chromatin in the amniotic cells of rat foetuses is useful for sex diagnosis before the development of the gonads, especially in view of the fact that sexual dimorphism is not conspicuous in other tissues1,3. To be a simple and accurate technique, however, the preparation of amnion for the examination of sex chromatin requires some special precautions. Absolute or 95 per cent alcohol has been habitually used as the fixative3, but we feel that it is troublesome because it shrinks the cells and coagulates the mucopolysaccharides. Cells of rat foetuses have several heterochromatic bodies1,3, and consequently sex chromatin is not easy to distinguish when the cells shrink. Furthermore, the amnion in young rat foetuses has a considerable content of mucopoly-saccharides which when coagulated hinder fixation and make the cells difficult to see. To overcome these difficulties we have used 50 per cent glacial acetic acid as the fixative, and have obtained with it good fixation and swelling of cells, which makes it easier to differentiate sex chromatin from chromocentres."

https://openalex.org/W2093126281,"TYROSINE is catabolized in the liver. One of the steps involved is the oxidation of p-hydroxyphenyl pyruvic acid to 2: 5-dihydroxyphenyl pyruvic acid. The enzyme system which catalyses this reaction, p-hydroxyphenyl-pyruvic hydroxylase, is believed to require ascorbic acid as a cofactor. If the reaction is blocked, p-hydroxyphenyl pyruvic acid accumulates and is excreted in increased amounts in the urine. Other pathways for the removal of p-hydroxyphenyl pyruvic acid are utilized, for example, conversion to p-hydroxyphenyl acetic and p-hydroxy-phenyl lactic acids, and these compounds can also be excreted in increased amounts in the urine. The excretion of excessive amounts of these substances in urine is known as tyrosyluria."

https://openalex.org/W1992810691,A PROGRAMME of routine skin grafting is used at the Laboratory Animals Centre to check the homogeneity of our colonies of inbred mouse strains with respect to histo-compatibility genes. The donor and recipient mice are usually six to eight generations apart. During the transfer of these inbred colonies from conventional buildings to isolated buildings free from pathogens it became necessary to graft between mice separated by two to sixteen generations.

https://openalex.org/W2029346477,"MOST experiments for recording the action potentials of striated muscle by means of intracellular electrodes are carried out with isolated curarized muscles. If non-curarized muscles in situ are used, it is very difficult to immobilize them so that artefacts appear1 and the electrode can easily break. To overcome these difficulties the stimulation of only one fibre through the intracellular recording electrode was tried. Where the stimulus was applied intracellularly, a positive stimulation pulse was used. The action potential then appeared during the pulsea2,3. The amplitude of the recorded action potential during such a positive pulse, however, decreases with increase in the stimulation pulse (Fig. 1) because of the decrease of the impedance of the membrane during the action potential4. This decrease of the impedance produces a decrease of the recorded stimulation voltage (which is proportional to the strength of the stimulus), because the stimulus is a constant current. The recorded action potential is a summation of the true action potential and this fall in voltage. A higher stimulus will therefore cause a smaller recorded action potential."

https://openalex.org/W2064736864,"CULINARY spices have been used through the ages for their flavour appeal and stabilizing effects in foodstuffs1, but only recently has their effectiveness as antioxidants in edible fats been clearly demonstrated2,3. Spices, particularly black pepper, are notorious for their high microbial content4,5 and appropriate techniques1 have been developed by spice processors to overcome this problem of potential food spoilage. The lipolytic activity of spices has received little scientific attention and it was therefore of interest to obtain some quantitative information on five spices used extensively in the baking industry. Table 1 illustrates lipolytic activity observed in samples of commercially available material."

https://openalex.org/W2083629302,"IT has been demonstrated that the free nucleic acid bases, adenine and cytosine, are deaminated in dilute aqueous solutions by ionizing radiation1,2. Neglecting ring destruction reactions, the deaminated analogues (hypoxanthine and uracil) are among the chief products of the radiolyses of these bases; this suggests a mechanism for mutagenesis induced by radiation. It is known that the dilute nitrous acid treatment of the free bases, adenine, guanine or cytosine, leads to the production of the corresponding hydroxyl compounds, hypoxanthine, xanthine and uracil? respectively3,4. Nitrous acid treatment of intact tobacco mosaic virus actually results in the formation of mutants5. In addition, alteration of the amino-acid sequence in the protein of the mutant virus has been demonstrated6. Deaminations induced by radiation should play the same part as deaminations induced by nitrous acid."

https://openalex.org/W1991677697,"IT is well known that the contractility of muscles is suppressed after removal of the calcium ions from the extracellular liquid and that injection of a small quantity of calcium ions into a fibre of skeletal muscle induces contraction. A definite quantity of intracellular calcium ions is necessary to establish the association of actin and myosin in the presence of ATP, and, therefore, the activity of actomyosinatepase to provoke contraction1–6. During stimulation of the skeletal muscle fibre, calcium ions are taken from the extracellular liquid and are restored later7–10 No uptake of calcium has been detected during contraction in smooth muscle11,12."
