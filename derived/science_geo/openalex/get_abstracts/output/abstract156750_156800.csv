This study examines whether caveolae represent specialized subdomains that concentrate and organize these moieties in cardiomyocytes. Caveolae from quiescent rat ventricular cardiomyocytes are highly enriched in β2-ARs, Gαi, protein kinase A RIIα subunits, caveolin-3, and flotillins (caveolin functional homologues); β1-ARs, m2-muscarinic cholinergic receptors, Gαs, and cardiac types V/VI adenylyl cyclase distribute between caveolae and other cell fractions, whereas protein kinase A RIα subunits, G protein-coupled receptor kinase-2, and clathrin are largely excluded from caveolae. Cell surface β2-ARs localize to caveolae in cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts (with markedly different β2-AR expression levels), indicating that the fidelity of β2-AR targeting to caveolae is maintained over a physiologic range of β2-AR expression. In cardiomyocytes, agonist stimulation leads to a marked decline in the abundance of β2-ARs (but not β1-ARs) in caveolae. Other studies show co-immunoprecipitation of cardiomyocytes adenylyl cyclase V/VI and caveolin-3, suggesting their in vivo association. However, caveolin is not required for adenylyl cyclase targeting to low density membranes, since adenylyl cyclase targets to low buoyant density membrane fractions of HEK cells that lack prototypical caveolins. Nevertheless, cholesterol depletion with cyclodextrin augments agonist-stimulated cAMP accumulation, indicating that caveolae function as negative regulators of cAMP accumulation. The inhibitory interaction between caveolae and the cAMP signaling pathway as well as domain-specific differences in the stoichiometry of individual elements in the β-AR signaling cascade represent important modifiers of cAMP-dependent signaling in the heart.

The direct inotropic and chronotropic support provided by cardiac β-ARs represents a critical compensatory mechanism to preserve cardiac function during stress and/or states associated with circulatory compromise. In the hearts of most mammalian species, the physiologic effects of catecholamines are mediated by the predominant β1-AR subtype (75–80% of the total β-ARs), which activates a signaling pathway involving the Gs-dependent stimulation of adenylyl cyclase leading to the accumulation of cAMP and protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of key target proteins. Cardiomyocytes also express β2-ARs that support contractile function. Until quite recently, most studies of β2-AR signaling in cardiomyocytes were wedded to the concept that β2-ARs signal to the Gs/cAMP pathway in a manner that is essentially equivalent to the pathway activated by β1-ARs. However, there is evidence that β2-ARs are not functionally redundant, including the findings that β2-ARs couple to the Gs/cAMP pathway more efficiently than β1-ARs and that the pathway for β1-AR activation of adenylyl cyclase is susceptible to inhibitory modulation by m2-muscarinic cholinergic receptors (m2-mAChRs), whereas the pathway for β2-AR activation of adenylyl cyclase is not (1Bristow M.R.

Physiol. 1997; 272: H2726-H2735PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that individual β-AR subtypes might fulfill distinct roles in transmembrane signaling due to spatially or developmentally regulated patterns of expression (3Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), but a specific molecular mechanism to adequately explain all of the distinct signaling properties of individual β-AR subtypes has not been identified. Until quite recently, the prevailing concept was that components of the β-AR complex are freely mobile in the plasma membrane and that the specificity of molecular interactions is dictated entirely by information encoded in the three-dimensional structures and recognition surfaces of individual moieties. However, a simple “random collision coupling” model is inadequate to explain all of the experimental data, including the aforementioned evidence that β1- and β2-ARs display distinct susceptibility to inhibitory modulation by the m2-mAChR (2Aprigliano O. Rybin V.O. Pak E. Robinson R.B. Steinberg S.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H2726-H2735PubMed Google Scholar, 3Steinberg S.F. Circ.

One potential molecular mechanism that could impart this type of specificity to β-AR subtype signaling is compartmentalization to membrane subdomains such as caveolae. Caveolae were first identified as flask-shaped uncoated invaginations on the surface of highly differentiated cells. Caveolae are now recognized to be plasma membrane compartments with distinct lipid and protein composition that sequester and regulate the function of cytoplasmically oriented signal transduction molecules (5Okamoto T.

Chem. 1999; 274: 26353-26360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar)) accumulate in caveolae at steady state and/or following ligand-induced activation. Localization of these diverse signaling molecules to caveolae suggests that this structure can serve as a scaffold to preassemble membrane-bound oligomeric complexes and thereby facilitate efficient and rapid coupling of agonist-occupied receptors to effectors. Such a mechanism could be particularly pertinent for sympathetic regulation of cardiomyocyte function, where rapid and productive signaling from receptor-activated G protein subunits to the adenylyl cyclase enzyme could be restricted by low (potentially limiting) levels of the adenylyl cyclase enzyme. Caveolae also may act to dampen signaling as a result of the properties of their principle structural protein, caveolin. The mammalian caveolin gene family consists of caveolin-1, caveolin-2, and the muscle-specific caveolin-3 (5Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). Domain-mapping studies identify a cytosolic membrane-proximal region (designated the “caveolin scaffolding domain”) in caveolin-1 (as well as the structurally homologous caveolin-3) that interacts with putative caveolin-binding motifs in a wide range of signaling molecules (including G protein α subunits and the catalytic domains of certain adenylyl cyclase isoforms, GRK2, and the catalytic subunit of PKA (5Okamoto T.

In vitro studies suggest that caveolin negatively regulates the activation state of heterotrimeric G proteins and functions as a “general kinase inhibitor” for many signaling enzymes. Accordingly, the goal of the present study was to determine whether caveolae form a signaling module for components of the β-AR complex in cardiomyocytes. Antibodies and their sources were as follows: anti-β1-AR, anti-β2-AR, anti-Gαs/olf, anti-type V/VI adenylyl cyclase, anti-GRK2, anti-PKA Iα regulatory subunit, anti-PKA IIα regulatory subunit, anti-PKAα catalytic subunit, and anti-clathrin affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); anti-Gαi1/αi2 and anti-Gαi3/αo antisera (PerkinElmer Life Sciences); anti-Gβ35/36 subunit antiserum (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY); anti-caveolin-1, anti-caveolin-3, anti-flotillin, and anti-epidermal surface antigen (anti-ESA) monoclonal antibodies (Transduction Laboratories); anti-m2-mAChR affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies (Alomone Labs, Israel); anti-goat IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad); anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate; and the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Other reagents were purchased commercially from the following sources: Percoll, OptiPrep, Nonidet P-40, octyl glucoside, protein G-Sepharose, and 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (Sigma) and peptideN-glycosidase F (PNG-F) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cardiac myocytes were isolated from hearts of 2-day-old Wistar rats by a trypsin dispersion procedure according to a protocol that incorporates a differential attachment procedure to enrich for cardiac myocytes as described previously (22Steinberg S.F. Robinson R.B. Lieberman H.B. Stern D.M. Rosen M.R. Circ. Res. 1991; 68: 1216-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The yield of myocytes typically is 2.5–3 × 106 cells/neonatal heart. Cells were plated at a density of 0.5 × 106cells/ml on protamine sulfate-coated 100-mm culture dishes. Although the preplating step effectively decreases fibroblast contamination, a small number of cells with proliferative capability such as cardiac fibroblasts persist in myocardial cell cultures. Proliferation of these cells was further curtailed with an irradiation protocol (22Steinberg S.F. Robinson R.B. Lieberman H.B. Stern D.M. Rosen M.R. Circ. Res. 1991; 68: 1216-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed following 5–6 days of culture in minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal calf serum, 5 × 10−6m hypoxanthine, and 12 mm NaHCO3. HEK293 cells were obtained from Dr. Jonathan Javitch and were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with Geneticin and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cardiac fibroblast cultures were obtained from cells adherent to culture dishes during preplating and cultured according to standard methods (23Sabri A. Muske G. Zhang H. Pak E. Darrow A. Andrade-Gordon P. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1054-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Fractions enriched in the muscle-specific caveolin-3 isoform were prepared by two methods. Most of the isolations were performed according to the detergent-free purification scheme of Song et al. (24Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar) essentially as described previously. All steps were carried out at 4 °C. Briefly, cells from five 100-mm diameter dishes were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped into 0.5m sodium carbonate, pH 11.0 (0.5 ml/dish; total volume ∼2.5 ml for each preparation). To disrupt cellular membranes, homogenization was carried out sequentially with a loose fitting Dounce homogenizer (10 strokes), a Polytron tissue grinder (three 10-s bursts), and a tip sonicator (three 20-s bursts). The homogenate was then adjusted to 40% sucrose by adding an equal volume of 80% sucrose prepared in Mes-buffered saline (25 mm Mes, pH 6.5, 0.15m NaCl), placed on the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube, overlaid with a 5–35% discontinuous sucrose gradient (4 ml of 5% sucrose, 3 ml of 35% sucrose; both in Mes-buffered saline containing 250 mm sodium carbonate), and centrifuged at 38,000 rpm for 16–18 h in an SW40 rotor (Beckman). After centrifugation, 12 1-ml gradient fractions were concentrated by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid as follows. Fractions were mixed with 7.92% trichloroacetic acid (1:10; v/v) and incubated for 30 min on ice. Precipitated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 3700 × rpm for 15 min at 4 °C (IEC; Centra-8R centrifuge). The pellet was washed once with 5 ml of ethyl ether and dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (generally without boiling, to prevent aberrant migration during immunodetection of receptors and adenylyl cyclase). In some experiments, the entire 40% lower sucrose layer (fractions 8–12) was pooled for immunoblot analysis. Some studies also were performed with caveolin-3-enriched fractions prepared according to the method of Smart et al. (13Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). In this case, plasma membranes were isolated by scraping cells from 10 100-mm plates into 30 ml of ice-cold buffer A (0.25 msucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tricine, pH 7.8) followed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min. Cells were then resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A, placed in a 2-ml Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder (Wheaton; catalog no. 358003), and homogenized (20 strokes). The suspension was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min to yield a postnuclear supernatant fraction, which was removed and stored on ice. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A, homogenized, and centrifuged at 1000 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant was combined with the previous postnuclear supernatant, layered on top of 23 ml of 30% Percoll in buffer A, and centrifuged at 65,000 × g for 30 min (Beckman Ti60 rotor). The plasma membrane fraction, a visible band ∼5.7 cm from the bottom of the centrifuge tube, was collected, adjusted to 2 ml with buffer A, and sonicated six times. Intracellular membranes (IM) were obtained by centrifuging fractions below the plasma membrane at 360,000 × g for 1 h. The IM fraction pellet was mixed with 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (3:1, v/v). A 0.2 ml aliquot of plasma membrane sonicate was diluted 60 times with buffer B (1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tricine, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl), centrifuged at 360,000 × g for 1 h, and then dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The remaining plasma membrane sonicate (1.8 ml) was mixed with 2.39 ml of 50% OptiPrep prepared in buffer C (0.25 m sucrose, 6 mm EDTA, 120 mm Tricine, pH 7.8) plus 1.01 ml of buffer A to make a 23% OptiPrep solution. This was placed on the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube, a linear 20 to 10% OptiPrep gradient (prepared by diluting 50% OptiPrep in buffer C with buffer A) was layered on top, and the sample was centrifuged at 57,600 ×g for 90 min in an SW40 rotor. The bottom fractions were collected and designated noncaveolae membrane (NCM). The top 6.5 ml of the gradient was collected and mixed with 5.38 ml of 50% OptiPrep in buffer C plus 0.12 ml of buffer A to make an ∼30% OptiPrep solution. This was overlaid with 0.5 ml of 15% OptiPrep and then with 0.5 ml of 5% OptiPrep (both in buffer A) and centrifuged at 57,600 ×g for 90 min. An opaque band located at the 5/15% OptiPrep interface was collected and designated caveolae fraction. Caveolae fraction was diluted 10–13 times with buffer B followed by centrifugation at 360,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting caveolae (yield typically 12 μg of protein) was dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. NCM was diluted four times with buffer B followed by centrifugation at 360,000 g for 1 h and solubilization in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose, which, in general, was cut into longitudinal strips for incubation with various primary antibodies. Sample boiling was avoided to prevent aberrant migration during immunodetection of receptors and adenylyl cyclase. Immunoblotting was performed with antibodies against the β1-AR, β2-AR, Gαs, type V/VI adenylyl cyclase, GRK2, RIα, RIIα, α-catalytic subunit of protein kinase A, clathrin, flotillin, and ESA (diluted in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl containing 5% non-fat dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20, and 0.02% NaN3); anti-caveolin-1 and caveolin-3 antibodies (diluted in 50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl containing 1% nonfat dry milk, 0.5% Tween 20, and 0.02% NaN3); anti-Gαi1/2, -Gαo/i3, and -G protein β35/36 subunit antibodies (diluted in 50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl containing 5% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20, and 0.02% NaN3); and anti-m2-mAChR-antibodies (diluted in 50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl containing 1% nonfat dry milk, 3% bovine serum albumin, and 0.02% NaN3). Primary antibodies were used at final dilutions of 1:5000 (ESA), 1:1000 (caveolin-3, Gαi1/2, Gαi3/o), 1:500 (Gαs, GRK2, G protein β35/36 subunit), 1:250 (RIα, RIIα, α-catalytic subunit of protein kinase A, flotillin, m2-mAChR), 1:200 (clathrin), or 1:100 (β1-AR, β2-AR, type V/VI adenylyl cyclase), and bound primary antibodies were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each of the antibodies was initially screened with total cell lysates to ensure that it reacted with a band (or bands) of the appropriate molecular weight in cardiomyocytes. To establish immunospecificity, polyclonal antibodies were also subjected to preblocking with their respective immunogen peptide as follows: β1-AR antibody and a peptide corresponding to the C terminus of the mouse β1-AR; β2-AR antibody and a peptide corresponding to the C terminus of the mouse β2-AR, Gαs/olf antibody and a peptide corresponding to the C terminus of rat Gαs; type V/VI adenylyl cyclase antibody and a peptide corresponding to the C terminus of human adenylyl cyclase V; GRK2 antibody and a peptide corresponding to the C terminus of human GRK2 (amino acids 675–689); RIα antibody and a peptide corresponding to the C terminus of human RIα (amino acids 343–361); RIIα antibody and a peptide corresponding to the C terminus of human RIIα (amino acids 385–404); α-catalytic subunit of PKA antibody and a peptide corresponding to the C terminus of human PKAα; clathrin antibody and a peptide corresponding to the N terminus of human clathrin heavy chain; m2-mAChR antibody and a fusion protein of glutathione S-transferase and amino acids 225–356 of the i3 intracellular loop of the human m2-mAChR. For all but the anti-m2-mAChR-antibody, 20 μg of antibody was preincubated with 100 μg of peptide in a final volume of 0.6 ml for 2 h at room temperature. 6 μg of the anti-m2-mAChR antibody was preincubated with 30 μg of the respective protein in a final volume of 80 μl for 1 h at room temperature. After preincubation, antibodies were brought to working concentration (see above). In some experiments, samples (5–20 μg) were deglycosylated by preincubation with PNG-F in 60 mm NaCl, 1.25 mmEDTA, 143 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm sodium phosphate, 15 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for 2 h at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated with 0.33 volumes of 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Cardiomyocytes from two 100-mm diameter dishes (∼2 mg of protein) were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by the addition of 1.8 ml of extraction buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 150 mmNaCl, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 60 mmoctyl glucoside). The cells were scraped and sonicated. Lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at maximal speed in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatant was removed. For immunoprecipitation, supernatant was incubated with anti-caveolin-3 antibodies or irrelevant mouse IgG1 for 1 h at 4 °C followed by the addition of 120 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma) and incubation overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with extraction buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with 140 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with caveolin-3 and adenylyl cyclase type V/VI-specific antibodies. Cholesterol depletion was accomplished by incubating cells in the presence of the cholesterol-binding agent 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (2% for 1 h at 37 °C). Preliminary experiments established that cyclodextrin caused a 66.3 ± 3.2% decrease in total cellular cholesterol (n = 3). The profound reduction in cholesterol was largely reversed within 1 h of subsequent incubation with cholesterol-cyclodextrin complexes at 37 °C. For these experiments, a stock solution of 0.4 mg/ml cholesterol and 10% cyclodextrin was prepared by adding 200 μl of cholesterol (20 mg/ml in ethanol) to 10% cyclodextrin at 40 °C. The solution was filtered through a 0.2-μm filter prior to use. Intracellular cAMP was measured according to standard methods essentially as described previously (22Steinberg S.F. Robinson R.B. Lieberman H.B. Stern D.M. Rosen M.R. Circ. Res. 1991; 68: 1216-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, neonatal myocytes grown in 22.1-mm multiwell dishes were preincubated for 60 min at room temperature with 10 mm theophylline. Assays were performed for the indicated time intervals at room temperature and were terminated by removal of the incubation buffer and the addition of 1 ml of ethanol. Each condition was performed on three wells and was assayed for cAMP in quadruplicate. Aliquots of the alcohol-fixed cell extract were dried under a stream of nitrogen, and cAMP in the residue was determined using a radioimmunoassay (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The cAMP pathway in cardiac cells was among the first and most rigorously studied signal transduction pathways, but there has been surprisingly little scrutiny of the subcellular localization of individual β-ARs and their downstream effector molecules. Studies of β-AR targeting in particular have been confined to β-ARs overexpressed at high levels in heterologous expression systems (10Schwencke C. Okumura S. Yamamoto M. Geng Y.J. Ishikawa Y. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 75: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 17Ostrom R.S. Violin J.D. Coleman S. Insel P.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1075-1079PubMed Google Scholar). There is no information on the targeting of native β-ARs expressed at physiologic concentrations in cardiomyocytes. Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes represent an optimal model to compare the subcellular targeting of individual β-AR subtypes and their downstream effector components as they co-express β1- and β2-ARs; both β1- and β2-ARs couple to an increase in intracellular calcium and enhanced contractility via a cAMP-dependent pathway in this cell type (3Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Caveolae were prepared according to two methods for these studies. First, membranes enriched in caveolin were separated from the bulk of cellular membranes and soluble proteins by extraction in detergent-free alkaline sodium carbonate buffer followed by isopycnic centrifugation on a sucrose gradient. We previously demonstrated that the light scattering band that forms at the 5/35% sucrose interface (fractions 4 and 5) of bottom-loaded discontinuous sucrose gradients contains ∼50–100-nm vesicular structures by transmission electron microscopy and the bulk of the cellular caveolin-3 (but excludes >99% of other cellular proteins including markers of the Golgi (25Rybin V.O. Xu X. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 980-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar)). The results of immunoblot analyses examining the partitioning of selected components of the β-AR signaling cascade across these gradient fractions are shown in Fig. 1. This isolation method identifies resident caveolae proteins, but it provides no information as to whether proteins that are excluded from caveolae reside on the remainder of the cell surface plasma membrane or on intracellular membranes. Therefore, the partitioning of selected components of the β-AR signaling complex between caveolae, the remainder of the cell surface plasma membrane, and intracellular membranes was compared according to a second method (13Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Here, plasma membranes were purified from the remainder of the intracellular proteins by Percoll gradient centrifugation. Membranes were then subjected to two OptiPrep density gradient centrifugations to separate and concentrate light caveolae vesicles from noncaveolae plasma membranes. Immunoblot analysis on these fractions is shown in Fig. 2.Figure 4Distinct subcellular distributions of cardiomyocyte β2-ARs and m2-mAChRs.

Specificity for β2-AR and m2-mAChR immunoreactivity was established by the parallel immunoblot analyses with antibody preblocked with antigen peptide (lanes 4 and 5). Lane 3 represents a 5 times longer exposure time forlane 2. Under these conditions, there is abundant m2-mAChR immunoreactivity, but no specific β2-AR immunoreactivity is detected.

https://openalex.org/W2003788548,"The angiopoietin-Tie2 system in endothelial cells is an important regulator of vasculogenesis and vascular integrity. High levels of angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) mRNA are observed in vascular activation during tumorigenesis. Although Ang2 is known to be a naturally occurring antagonist of angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) in vivo, the exact function of Ang2 itself is not known. Here, we found that a high concentration of Ang2 (800 ng/ml) acts as an apoptosis survival factor for endothelial cells during serum deprivation apoptosis. The survival effect of high concentration Ang2 was blocked by pre-treatment with soluble Tie2 receptor and the PI 3'-kinase-specific inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002. Accordingly, 800 ng/ml of Ang2 induced phosphorylation of Tie2, the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI 3'-kinase), and serine-threonine kinase Akt at Ser473 in the human umbilical vein endothelial cells; lower concentrations of Ang2 (50 - 400 ng/ml) did not produce notable effects. These findings indicate that at high concentrations, Ang2, like Ang1, can be an apoptosis survival factor for endothelial cells through the activation of the Tie2 receptor, PI 3'-kinase and Akt, and thus may be a positive regulator of tumor angiogenesis.

The dinB gene is required for untargeted mutagenesis of phage λ (4Brotcorne-Lannoye A. Maenhaut-Michel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3904-3908Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and overexpression of dinB in E. coli increases the spontaneous mutation rate in plasmids, especially for single-base deletions in a run of guanine residues (5Kim S.R. Maenhaut-Michel G. Yamada M. Yamamoto Y. Matsui K. Sofuni T. Nohmi T. Ohmori H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13792-13797Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The dinB gene encodes DNA polymerase (pol) IV, a distributive enzyme that lacks detectable 3′→5′ exonuclease activity (6Wagner J. Gruz P. Kim S.-R. Yamada M. Matsui K. Fuchs R.P. Nohmi T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 281-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). pol IV has limited ability to bypass UV radiation-induced photoproducts, but misinserts nucleotides at undamaged template sites at rates that are higher than those observed for DNA pol III, the major replicative enzyme inE. coli (7Tang M. Pham P. Shen X. Taylor J.S. O'Donnell M. Woodgate R. Goodman M.F. Nature. 2000; 404: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Moreover, when incubated in the presence of a template-primer with a terminal mismatch with a potential for misalignment, pol IV generates DNA products that are one nucleotide shorter than expected (6Wagner J.

When purified from insect cells expressing the full-length polymerase fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) (11Gerlach, V. L., Feaver, J., Fischhaber, P. J., and Friedberg, E. C. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. in press.Google Scholar) or purified as a catalytically active fragment of amino acids 1–560 (9Ohashi E. Ogi T. Kusumoto R. Iwai S. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Ohmori H. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1589-1594PubMed Google Scholar), pol κ lacks detectable 3′→5′ exonuclease activity. The purified full-length GST fusion protein has optimal activity at 37 °C over the pH range 6.5–7.5, it is insensitive to inhibition by aphidicolin or dideoxynucleotides, and Mg2+ is preferred over Mn2+ as the essential divalent cation (11Gerlach, V. L., Feaver, J., Fischhaber, P. J., and Friedberg, E. C. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. in press.Google Scholar). Neither the full-length GST-enzyme purified from yeast cells (10Johnson R.E. Prakash S.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1589-1594PubMed Google Scholar) bypass UV radiation-induced photoproducts. However, as has been reported (10Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3838-3843Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), the full-length enzyme misinserts nucleotides at undamaged template sites at rates between 1.5 and 30 × 10−4. Moreover, when extending from template-primers containing terminal mismatches that have the potential to misalign, the full-length polymerase generates DNA products that are one or two nucleotides shorter than expected (10Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3838-3843Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Finally, transient expression of the homologous mouse Dinb1 gene in cultured mouse cells enhances spontaneous frameshift and base substitution mutagenesis at the Hprt locus (8Ogi T. Kato Jr., T. Kato T. Ohmori H. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 607-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with the possibility that DNA synthesis errors by pol κ contribute to spontaneous mutagenesisin vivo and prompted the present study of the fidelity of human pol κ during copying of an undamaged DNA template. We demonstrate here that pol κ has relatively low fidelity and moderate processivity and discuss these properties in relation to other DNA polymerases and to observations in vivo. All materials for the fidelity assay were from previously described sources (13Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Human pol κ was expressed and purified as a full-length 870-amino acid polymerase fused to GST on the N terminus and to hexahistidine on the C terminus (11Gerlach, V. L., Feaver, J., Fischhaber, P. J., and Friedberg, E. C. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. in press.Google Scholar). We refer to this protein as full-length pol κ. pol κ was also purified as a C-terminal hexahistidine-tagged, catalytically active fragment comprised of amino acids 1–560 (9Ohashi E. Ogi T. Kusumoto R. Iwai S. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Ohmori H. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1589-1594PubMed Google Scholar). We refer to this protein as pol κ1–560. Neither pol κ preparation excised a nucleotide from a mismatched primer terminus (14Matsuda T. Bebenek K. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Kunkel T.A. Nature. 2000; 404: 1011-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The amount of 3′→5′ exonuclease activity was calculated to be ≤2% of the intrinsic exonuclease activity of the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I. Reactions (25 μl) contained 0.7 nm M13mp2 DNA with a 407-nucleotide gap (from nucleotide −216 through +191 of the lacZ gene), 40 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0 at 22 °C), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 6.25 μg bovine serum albumin, 60 mm KCl, 2.5% glycerol, and 1 mm dNTPs. Synthesis was initiated by adding 110 nm pol κ1–560 or 70 nm full-length pol κ. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and terminated by adding EDTA to 15 mm. Products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis as described (13Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). DNA products of the reactions were examined for the frequency of lacZ mutants as described previously (13Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). DNA from independent mutant phage was sequenced to identify the errors made during gap-filling synthesis. Error rates were calculated in three different ways. The standard approach expresses the error rate as “errors per detectable nucleotide synthesized,” by considering only changes in the 275-nucleotide LacZα-complementation sequence that yield detectable light blue or colorless M13 plaque phenotypes (13Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). However, because most of thelacZ mutants generated by pol κ contain multiple sequence changes that include both silent and phenotypically detectable changes, the error rate can also be described simply as the number of observed mutations divided by the total number of copied nucleotides that were sequenced. A third calculation was performed using all base substitutions found in lacZ mutants containing known detectable frameshift mutations, or all frameshifts found inlacZ mutants containing known detectable base substitution mutations. Error rates generally differed by less than 2-fold when these three calculations were compared. The error rates shown in the tables use the second, simplest method. Measurements were performed with M13mp2 single-stranded DNA primed at a 1.2:1 molar ratio with a 5′-32P-labeled 15-mer complementary to nucleotides 106 through 120 of the LacZ gene (where +1 is the first transcribed nucleotide). Reactions with HIV-1 RT and exonuclease-deficient Klenow fragment pol were previously described (15Bebenek K. Beard W.A. Casas-Finet J.R. Kim H.-R. Darden T.A. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol.

Reactions were incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots (10 μl) were removed at 5, 15, or 30 min and mixed with 10 μl of 99% formamide, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanole, and 0.1% bromphenol blue. DNA products were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 16% polyacrylamide gel, in parallel with products of DNA-sequencing reactions using the same template. Product bands were quantified by phosphorimaging, and the probability of terminating processive synthesis was calculated as described previously (15Bebenek K. Beard W.A. Casas-Finet J.R. Kim H.-R.

Moreover, the probability of termination at each template position remained constant between 5 and 30 min of incubation for all these polymerases, demonstrating that re-initiation of synthesis did not occur on the previously used template-primer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The fidelity of pol κ was determined using a forward mutation assay that scores a variety of substitution, addition, and deletion errors during synthesis to copy a 407-nucleotide template present as a single-stranded gap in M13mp2 DNA (13Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Correct polymerization to fill the gap produces DNA that yields blue M13 plaques, whereas errors are scored as light blue or colorless plaques. DNA synthesis by both pol κ1–560 and full-length pol κ filled the 407-nucleotide gap (Fig. 1). When the DNA products were introduced into E. coli, the lacZ mutant frequency among the resulting M13 plaques was 25% for pol κ1–560 and 34% for full-length pol κ. These lacZ mutant frequencies are 10- to 100-fold higher than those generated by eukaryotic pol β (17Osheroff W.P. Jung H.K. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3642-3650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), pol α, pol δ, or pol ε (18Thomas D.C. Roberts J.D. Sabatino R.D. Myers T.W. Tan C.K. Downey K.M.

Hanaoka F. Kunkel T.A. Nature. 2000; 404: 1011-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The data indicate that both full-length pol κ and pol κ1–560 have very low fidelity overall. To determine the nature and number of polymerase errors, we isolated DNA from independent lacZ mutants and sequenced all 407 nucleotides in the gap. The lacZ mutants generated by both pol κ1–560 and full-length pol κ contained an average of 4.2 and 3.7 mutations per mutant clone, respectively (TableI). A variety of different sequence changes was observed (Table I), and these changes were distributed throughout the target sequence (Fig. 2). The majority of sequence changes were single-base substitutions (Fig. 2 A). Given the total number of template nucleotides analyzed, the single-base substitution error rates of pol κ1–560 and full-length pol κ are 7.4 × 10−3 and 5.8 × 10−3, respectively (Table II). The second most frequent errors were single-base deletions, which were generated at average rates of 1.6 × 10−3 and 1.8 × 10−3 by pol κ1–560 and full-length pol κ, respectively. When compared with the error rates of other mammalian DNA polymerases determined in this assay (Table II), the pol κ error rates for base substitutions and single-base deletions are intermediate between those of pol η and pol β. The pol κ error rates are much higher than those of the polymerases that replicate the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes.Table ISummary of sequence changes generated by human DNA polymerase κpol κ1–560pol κTotal lacZ mutants sequenced10851Total bases sequenced43,95620,757Total sequence changes450188Changes perlacZ mutant4.23.7Single-base substitutions324121Single-base deletions7038Two-base deletions135Single-base additions2616Other changes 1-aOther changes include tandem double-base substitutions, substitution-addition and substitution-deletion errors, deletions of larger numbers of nucleotides, and complex errors.1781-a Other changes include tandem double-base substitutions, substitution-addition and substitution-deletion errors, deletions of larger numbers of nucleotides, and complex errors.

We next considered error rates for individual subsets of errors. pol κ1–560 and full-length pol κ both generated all 12 possible base substitutions (Fig. 2 A). Base substitution error rates (TableIII) were similar for the two forms of pol κ, and these rates varied between 0.2 × 10−3(C·dCMP) and 8.2 × 10−3 (T·dCMP). Although mismatch-dependent variations are typical of all polymerases studied to date (recently reviewed in Ref. 19Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 497-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar), the pol κ base substitution specificity is unusual in that the highest error rate is observed for the T·dCMP mispair (Table III). In contrast, other DNA polymerases generate the T·dGMP mismatch at the highest rate (14Matsuda T. Bebenek K. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Kunkel T.A.

From this bias and less apparent differences in the proportions of other substitutions, the ratio of misinsertion of pyrimidine dNTPsversus purine dNTPs (from Table III) is 60:40 for pol κ. This misinsertion bias is different from that of other polymerases, whose general preference is to misinsert purine dNTPs (14Matsuda T. Bebenek K. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Kunkel T.A.

Open table in a new tab Error rates are the number of observed base substitutions (from Fig. 2 A) divided by the total number of A, T, G, or C template nucleotides in the 407-base target (shown in parentheses in the first column) among the 108 (pol κ1–560) or 51 (full-length pol κ) lacZ clones sequenced. Analysis of the distribution of the single-base deletions within the 407-nucleotide target sequence (Fig. 2 B) also revealed sequence-dependent variations in deletion error rates. The deletion rate per template nucleotide copied is highest for loss of nucleotides within homopolymeric runs, and the highest rate is observed in the longest runs (Table IV). This suggests the formation of misaligned intermediates stabilized by correct base pairing. However, the deletion rate is high even at non-iterated nucleotides (Table IV), such that there is only a 2- to 3-fold difference in error rate for loss of non-iterated nucleotides as compared with loss of nucleotides in homopolymeric runs of four and five bases. This difference is much smaller than that observed with several other DNA polymerases (reviewed in Ref. 19Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 497-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). For example, the pol β deletion error rate in runs of four and five nucleotides is 35-fold higher than that for loss of non-iterated nucleotides (TableIV). As discussed below, this error specificity suggests possible mechanisms of deletion formation by pol κ and has implications for spontaneous frameshift mutagenesis in human cells.Table IVSequence dependent variations in single-base deletion rates of human pol κRunLengthPol κ1–560Pol κPol β, Error rateObservedError rateObservedError rateOne(204)231.0 × 10−3121.2 × 10−30.02 × 10−3Two(116)201.6 × 10−3162.8 × 10−30.09 × 10−3Three(57)172.8 × 10−362.1 × 10−30.23 × 10−3Four/five(30)103.1 × 10−342.7 × 10−30.70 × 10−3Error rates are the number of observed single-base deletions (from Fig. 2 B) divided by the total number of template nucleotides present in runs of the lengths listed (shown in parentheses in the first column) among 108 (pol κ1–560) or 51 (full-length pol κ) lacZ clones sequenced.

Open table in a new tab Error rates are the number of observed single-base deletions (from Fig. 2 B) divided by the total number of template nucleotides present in runs of the lengths listed (shown in parentheses in the first column) among 108 (pol κ1–560) or 51 (full-length pol κ) lacZ clones sequenced. Error rates for pol β were calculated by considering only the phenotypically detectable changes, using the data in Fig. 1 of Reference 17. Both pol κ1–560 and full-length pol κ also frequently generate single-nucleotide additions (Table I). Unexpectedly, many of these errors involve adding a nucleotide that differs from both of its neighbors (Fig. 2 B). These include 10 of 14 additions of guanine between template nucleotides 5′-T and C-3′ and four of 20 additions of thymine between template nucleotides 5′-(C/G/A) and C-3′. This addition specificity is different from that of most other DNA polymerases investigated to date, which usually add nucleotides to homopolymeric runs (reviewed in Ref. 19Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 497-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). This suggests that pol κ generates some addition errors by a mechanism other than classical strand slippage. pol κ also produces two base deletions (Table I), and these too are non-randomly distributed (Fig. 2 B). Seven of 13 two-base deletions generated by pol κ1–560 and four of five cases by full-length pol κ occurred at template 5′-GCT-3′ sites, where the template nucleotides C and T were deleted and the 5′-neighboring template base was a G. Among these, seven were at one location, nucleotides −58 and −59 (Fig. 2 B), which can therefore be considered a hot spot for this deletion by pol κ. Finally, “other” sequence changes were also observed (Table I), including tandem double-base substitutions, substitution-addition and substitution-deletion errors, deletions of larger numbers of nucleotides, and complex errors. We examined the processivity of DNA synthesis by pol κ, i.e. the number of nucleotides polymerized per cycle of polymerase-DNA association-dissociation. Primer extension reactions were performed using a large excess of template-primer over polymerase, such that once the polymerase completes a cycle of processive synthesis, the probability that the extended product is used again is negligible. Analysis of the products of the reaction catalyzed by pol κ1–560 (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1–3) shows incorporation of one to five nucleotides. Quantification of band intensities reveals that 20 primers were extended per molecule of input pol κ1–560, indicating that after terminating processive synthesis the polymerase dissociates and rebinds to a previously unused primer. The probability of termination following each incorporation event was calculated at between 65 and 80%. Low processivity and high termination probabilities were also observed with two other template-primers (data not shown). In contrast to these results, analysis of the products of the reaction catalyzed by full-length pol κ revealed incorporation of one to more than 25 nucleotides per cycle of pol κ association-dissociation (Fig. 3 A, lanes 4–9). Thus, full-length pol κ is more processive than is pol κ1–560. The probability of termination of processive synthesis by the full-length enzyme varied by template position, from 46% at nucleotide 102 to 2.8% at nucleotide 81 (Fig. 3 B). A relatively intense band was observed corresponding to incorporation of the 76th nucleotide (position 29, Fig. 3 A). This is the beginning of the palindromic operator sequence in the LacZ gene (underlined in Fig. 2 A), suggesting that full-length pol κ has difficulty extending through a hairpin structure in the template. When copying this same template sequence, Klenow fragment pol and HIV-1 RT have higher processivity (15Bebenek K. Beard W.A. Casas-Finet J.R. Kim H.-R. Darden T.A. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7345-7351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For comparison, the termination probabilities of all three polymerases at 25 template positions are shown in Fig. 3 B. Full-length pol κ terminates processive synthesis more frequently than does Klenow fragment pol during incorporation of the first seven nucleotides, after which these two enzymes have somewhat similar termination patterns. However, the termination probability and overall termination pattern of full-length pol κ is distinct from that of HIV-1 RT across the region scanned (Fig. 3 B). Thus, the processivity of these three polymerases is different and is variably responsive to template sequence. The biochemical properties reported here are informative with respect to possible roles for pol κ in vivo. Human pol κ has moderate processivity (Fig. 3) and low fidelity (Table Table II, Table III, Table IV), suggesting a specialized role in vivo. At least two general and not mutually exclusive possibilities can be considered. pol κ may be recruited to replace another polymerase when that polymerase is stalled, perhaps during replication, repair, or recombination. By analogy to the role of pol η in bypassing UV radiation-induced photoproducts, the relaxed discrimination of pol κ may allow it to copy DNA molecules containing particular lesions or undamaged templates with unusual helical dimensions or abberrant structures. A second possibility is that pol κ is not a “replacement” enzyme but is the normal polymerase used in some special process, such as somatic mutation of immunoglobulin genes, where relaxed selectivity offers a specific advantage. In either case, the moderate processivity of the full-length enzyme (Fig. 3) implies a DNA transac"

When human MSH3 or MSH6 peptides containing the PCNA binding motif were added to a human cell extract, mismatch repair activity was inhibited at a step preceding DNA resynthesis.

In eukaryotes, MMR is initiated when one of two protein complexes binds to mismatches (reviewed in Refs. 1Buermeyer A.B. Deschenes S.M. Baker S.M. Liskay R.M. Annu. Rev.

The MutSα heterodimer consists of the MutShomologs MSH2 and MSH6 and is involved in the recognition and repair of base-base and small insertion/deletion mismatches. MutSβ is comprised of MSH2 and MSH3 and is primarily responsible for binding to and correcting insertion/deletion mutations. Other proteins participate in MMR, including heterodimers of MutL homologs, PCNA, exonuclease I, replication protein A, replication factor C, and DNA polymerase δ. Working in concert, these proteins complete a DNA excision/resynthesis reaction that specifically corrects errors in the nascent strand (1Buermeyer A.B. Deschenes S.M. Baker S.M. Liskay R.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 533-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 2Kolodner R.D. Marsischky G.T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 3Jiricny J.

Although the signal that directs mismatch repair to the newly replicated strand in eukaryotic cells is unknown, repair of mismatched duplexes in extracts of eukaryotic cells can be directed to one strand by a discontinuity in the DNA backbone. We previously suggested that one-strand discontinuity that might serve as a strand discrimination signal is the primer terminus at the replication fork and that PCNA may link DNA replication and mismatch repair to facilitate recognition and repair of errors in the nascent strand (4Umar A.

PCNA is the essential sliding clamp that topologically encircles DNA and physically associates with DNA polymerase δ to enhance its processivity (reviewed in Ref. 5Tsurimoto T. Front. Biosci. ( Online ). 1999; 4: 849-858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PCNA is required at an early step in DNA mismatch repair that precedes excision of the mismatch (4Umar A. Buermeyer A.B. Simon J.A.

Cell. 1996; 87: 65-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), as well as for the DNA resynthesis that follows mismatch excision (6Gu L. Hong Y. McCulloch S. Watanabe H.

Human PCNA can be co-immunoprecipitated with MSH2, MLH1, and PMS2 (6Gu L. Hong Y. McCulloch S. Watanabe H. Li G.M.

Yeast strains with certain mutant PCNA alleles exhibit a mutator phenotype that is epistatic with mutations in mismatch repair genes (4Umar A. Buermeyer A.B. Simon J.A. Thomas D.C. Clark A.B.

One of these alleles, pol30–104, is lethal in combination with a null mutation in RAD52, and this synthetic lethality is suppressed by a mutation in MSH2 (9Chen C. Merrill B.J. Lau P.J. Holm C. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7801-7815Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This suggests that this mutant PCNA may reduce strand discrimination such that nicking of both strands yields lethal double strand breaks. Because these data reveal important roles for PCNA in MMR, we are attempting to identify interactions of PCNA with mismatch repair proteins and investigate their functional importance. Here we take advantage of previous studies (reviewed in Refs. 5Tsurimoto T. Front. Biosci. ( Online ). 1999; 4: 849-858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 11Warbrick E.

A p21 peptide containing this motif binds to the interdomain connector loop of PCNA (18Gulbis J.M. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 297-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar), which is present three times in the trimeric PCNA sliding clamp. The present study was motivated by the observation that the consensus PCNA binding motif is present at the N termini of MSH3 and MSH6. We provide evidence that these motifs mediate physical interactions with PCNA and that these interactions are important for the function of MSH3 and MSH6. N-terminal peptides of hMSH6 and hMSH3 containing wild type or mutant PCNA binding motifs (see Fig. 1 B) were synthesized by Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). Materials for the MMR assays have been described (19Thomas D.C. Umar A. Kunkel T.A. Methods ( Orlando ). 1995; 7: 187-197Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Bacterial expression plasmids were constructed to produce glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins containing amino acids 28–47 of yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae Msh3 (GST-yMsh3), 22–41 of S. cerevisiae Msh6 (GST-yMsh6), 18–37 of human MSH3 (GST-hMSH3), 18–37 of human MSH3 with an F27A/F28A substitution (GST-hMSH3, F27A/F28A), 1–20 of human MSH6 (GST-hMSH6), or 1–20 of human MSH6 with an F10A/F11A substitution (GST-hMSH6, F10A/F11A). These plasmids were made by ligating annealed pairs of oligonucleotides 2The sequences of the oligonucleotides used in this study are available upon request. into anEcoRI/XhoI-digested pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). They each have a stop codon after the last MSH3 or MSH6 codon and a unique HindIII restriction site to facilitate screening during subcloning. The correct sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmids for yeast and human PCNA and GST fusion proteins for human FEN1 and DNA ligase I were as described (13Gary R. Ludwig D.L. Cornelius H.L. MacInnes M.A. Park M.S. J. Biol.

Proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) by induction with 0.8 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were lysed in ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mmNaCl, 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mmbenzamidine, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pH 7.4). Binding assay mixtures contained 80 μl of 40% glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma), 300 μl of lysate from cells expressing GST or GST fusion protein, and 400 μl of lysate from cells expressing human or yeast PCNA. Mixtures were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C and then washed five times with 0.8 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.4). For binding assays with human PCNA, protein complexes were eluted by heating to 100 °C with 80 μl of 2× Laemmli SDS sample buffer, separated on a 12% SDS polyacrylamide gel, and stained with Coomassie Blue. For binding assays with yeast PCNA, the washed bead mixtures were resuspended in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 units thrombin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and incubated for 3 h at room temperature. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation, and 6 μl of supernatant was analyzed as above. To characterize proteins associated with the beads after cleavage, the supernatant was removed, beads were washed, and proteins were eluted with 80 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer. To test interactions with Msh2-Msh6, yeast PCNA was overexpressed inE. coli, purified as described (21Fien K. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and coupled to Affi-gel 15 beads (Bio-Rad Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Wild type and mutant yMsh2-yMsh6 heterodimer was purified as described. 3The wild type and mutant Msh2-Msh6 complexes were each highly purified in 1:1 stoichiometry. K. Drotschmann and T. A. Kunkel, manuscript in preparation. 20 μg of either Msh2-Msh6 complex was incubated with 20 μl of PCNA beads, or BSA beads as a negative control, for 1 h at 4 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol. Beads were washed 6 times with 20 mmTris-HCl (pH7.4), 1 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol. Beads were resuspended in an equal volume of 2× Laemmli loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with an antibody to a peptide of amino acids 280–301 of yMSH6. This antibody reacts with both yMsh6 and yMsh2. A yMSH6 integration vector was constructed by subcloning a 5.3-kb EcoRI/BamHI fragment from the centromeric plasmid pMMR83 (from L. Prakash, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX) into the integration vector YIplac211. A yMSH3 integration vector was constructed by subcloning a 4-kb KpnI/PstI fragment from the centromeric plasmid pPM611 (from L. Prakash) into YIplac211. The PCNA binding motifs were altered by site-directed mutagenesis usingPfu turbo polymerase (Stratagene) and mutant oligonucleotides (Genosys). Integration vectors were linearized withAflII and placed into E203 (msh3 andmsh6) (22Tran H.T. Gordenin D.A. Resnick M.A. Mol. Cell.

Kunkel T.A. Methods ( Orlando ). 1995; 7: 187-197Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Repair reactions (25 μl) contained 0–400 μm hMSH3 peptide (amino acids 18–37) or hMSH6 peptide (amino acids 1–20). Taq MutS protein contains five domains (26Obmolova G. Changill B. Hsieh P. Yang W. Nature. 2000; 407: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), and sequence alignments suggest that human and yeast MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6 proteins share these five domains (Fig.1 A). However, MSH3 and MSH6 contain distinct N-terminal amino acid sequences not found inTaq MutS or in MSH2 (Fig. 1 A). These regions of MSH3 and MSH6 encode the sequence Qxxhxxaa (Fig.1 B), where h and a are hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids, respectively. Flanking this consensus motif are several charged amino acids that may contribute to binding (reviewed in Ref. 11Warbrick E. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Using glutathione-agarose affinity beads in a pull-down assay previously used to demonstrate PCNA interaction with FEN1, we first examined the ability of human PCNA to interact with human and yeast MSH3 and MSH6 peptides. Human PCNA bound to GST fusion proteins containing short peptide sequences with the putative PCNA binding motifs of hMSH3 (Fig. 2,panel A, lane 5), hMSH6 (lane 7), yMsh3 (lane 9), and yMsh6 (lane 10). These results are similar to PCNA binding to GST fusion proteins containing the PCNA binding motifs of hFEN1 and hDNA ligase I (Fig. 2, panel A, lanes 2 and 3). Substituting alanines for the conserved phenylalanines, which abolishes PCNA binding to the DNA ligase I peptide (lane 4) (16Montecucco A. Rossi R. Levin D.S. Gary R. Park M.S. Motycka T.A. Ciarrocchi G. Villa A. Biamonti G. Tomkinson A.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3786-3795Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), eliminated PCNA binding by hMSH3 (lane 6) and hMSH6 (lane 8). Next, we examined the ability of yeast PCNA to bind to yeast Msh3 and Msh6 fusion proteins. Because yeast PCNA is 29 kDa and nearly comigrates with the fusion proteins in SDS-PAGE gels, complexes isolated using the pull-down assay were treated with thrombin to release the Msh peptides and any associated PCNA into the supernatant. Analysis of the supernatants (Fig. 2, panel B,left) showed that yeast PCNA bound to fusion proteins of yMsh3 (lane 2), yMsh6 (lane 3) and hFEN1 (lane 4), but not to GST alone (lane 1). Parallel experiments with human PCNA (Fig. 2, panel B,right) confirmed its ability to bind to fusion proteins of yMsh3 (lane 6), yMSH6 (lane 7), and hFen1 (lane 8) but not to GST alone (lane 5). These experiments also demonstrated that the GST moiety generated by thrombin cleavage did not contribute to the band intensity at 29 kDa in the experiments with yeast PCNA (lanes 1–4). When the bead-associated material after cleavage was analyzed (not shown), the GST moiety was found in approximately equal amounts and no intact fusion proteins were seen, indicating that the cleavage reaction was complete. We next examined binding of the intact Msh2-Msh6 heterodimer to yPCNA attached to Affi-gel beads. Wild type Msh2-Msh6 bound to these beads (Fig.2 C) but not to beads to which BSA had been attached (not shown). This result is similar to a previous demonstration that yPCNA binds to Msh2-Msh3 but not to Msh2 alone (7Johnson R.E. Kovvali G.K. Guzder S.N. Amin N.S. Holm C. Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27987-27990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). PCNA binding was strongly reduced when the heterodimer contained wild type Msh2 and mutant Msh6 with alanine substituted for conserved amino acids in the PCNA binding motif (Fig. 2 C). To examine the functional importance of the yeast Msh3 and Msh6 PCNA binding motifs, we constructed haploid yeast strains with alanine substituted for conserved residues in the motifs and measured mutation ratesin vivo. We used a highly sensitive reporter gene that monitors the rate of Lys+ reversion via single-base deletions in a run of 14 A·T base pairs in the Lys2 gene (25Tran H.T. Keen J.D. Kricker M.

An msh3/msh6 double mutant strain had an 11,000-fold higher mutation rate than a wild type strain (TableI), reflecting inactivation of Msh2-Msh6- and Msh2-Msh3-dependent mismatch repair. However,msh3 and msh6 single mutant strains had reversion rates that were 16- and 200-fold higher, respectively, than the wild type yeast strain (Table I). These smaller increases are expected based on the redundancy of these pathways (27Marsischky G.T. Filosi N. Kane M.F. Kolodner R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 407-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) and reflect the contribution of wild type Msh6 and Msh3 to repair. However, substituting alanine for conserved residues in the PCNA binding motif of either MSH3or MSH6 increased reversion rates about 20-fold relative to the respective wild type genes (Table I). The strain with alanine substitutions in the PCNA binding motif of MSH3 also had a 10-fold higher rate of reversion at a run of 10 G·C base pairs (23Harfe B.D. Jinks-Robertson S. Genetics. 2000; 156: 571-578PubMed Google Scholar) compared with wild type (Table I), and the strain with alanine substitutions in the PCNA binding motif of MSH6 had a mutation rate at the CAN1 locus that was 2-fold higher than the msh3/MSH6 yeast strain (Table I).Table IMutator effect of mutations in PCNA binding motifs of MSH6 and MSH3StrainMutation rate95% Confidence limitsRelative rate×10 6×10 6Lys+ Reversion Rate at Run of 14 A · T Base Pairs Wild Type0.140.12–0.191 msh3/msh615001400–200011,000 msh3/MSH62.31.9–3.316 (1) msh3/msh6-KQFF 1-aThe indicated amino acids in the PCNA binding motif were changed to alanine.5219–68370 (23) MSH3/msh62824–36200 (1) msh3-FF1-aThe indicated amino acids in the PCNA binding motif were changed to alanine./msh6650560–8604600 (23) msh3-QFF1-aThe indicated amino acids in the PCNA binding motif were changed to alanine./msh6450380–5203200 (17)Lys+ Reversion Rate at Run of 10 G · C Base Pairs Wild Type0.420.34–0.831 msh3-QFF 1-aThe indicated amino acids in the PCNA binding motif were changed to alanine.4.43.7–5.810Canavanine Resistance Mutation Rate Wild Type0.290.2–0.41 msh3/msh65.04.6–817 msh3/MSH60.560.4–0.71.9 msh3/msh6-KQFF 1-aThe indicated amino acids in the PCNA binding motif were changed to alanine.1.10.9–1.33.81-a The indicated amino acids in the PCNA binding motif were changed to alanine. Open table in a new tab Next, we measured MMR activity in extracts of human TK6 cells in the absence or presence of N-terminal hMSH3 and hMSH6 peptides that contain this motif. We reasoned that addition of hMSH3 or hMSH6 PCNA binding peptides to the mismatch repair reaction might compete with native MSH3 or MSH6 for binding to PCNA, thus preventing repair. With the MMR assay used (19Thomas D.C. Umar A. Kunkel T.A. Methods ( Orlando ). 1995; 7: 187-197Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar), any effect results from inhibition of MMR at a step prior to resynthesis of DNA (4Umar A. Buermeyer A.B. Simon J.A. Thomas D.C. Clark A.B. Liskay R.M. Kunkel T.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 65-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, the extract alone efficiently repaired a G·G mismatch and a 2-base insertion mismatch. Addition of hMSH3 or hMSH6 peptides inhibited repair of both mismatches in a concentration-dependent manner. Addition of peptides with alanines replacing the conserved phenylalanines did not inhibit repair. We have identified consensus PCNA binding motifs in MSH3 and MSH6 and have clearly shown that these N-terminal residues interact with PCNA. Given the presence of this motif, interaction with PCNA was anticipated based on previous demonstrations that several other proteins interact with PCNA via this conserved motif (12Warbrick E.

Science. 1997; 277: 1996-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Our results with the yeast Msh3 peptide are consistent with a previous study (7Johnson R.E. Kovvali G.K. Guzder S.N. Amin N.S. Holm C. Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27987-27990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) showing an interaction between yeast PCNA and the yeast MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer but not with MSH2 alone. The data with the human MSH6 peptide and intact Msh2-Msh6 are also consistent with hMSH6 binding to a hPCNA affinity column (8Hughes P. Tratner I. Ducoux M. Piard K. Baldacci G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2108-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The elevated mutation rates of yeast strains with mutations in these PCNA binding motifs suggest that interactions between PCNA and both MSH3 and MSH6 are important for genome stability. The observed mutator phenotypes may reflect reduced repair of mismatches recognized by MSH2-MSH3 and MSH2-MSH6. This possibility is consistent with the inhibition of strand-specific MMR at a step preceding DNA resynthesis observed when MSH3 or MSH6 PCNA binding peptides are added to MMR reactions catalyzed by an extract of human cells (Fig. 3). Substitutions in the MSH3 and MSH6 PCNA binding motif that strongly reduced binding to PCNA (Fig. 2) yielded mutation rates that were not as high as in strains completely devoid of Msh3 or Msh6 (Table I), indicating retention of some MMR function. Precedent for partial repair activity comes from previous studies showing that Fen1 and DNA ligase I participate with reduced efficacy in long-patch base excision repair when similar substitutions are present in their PCNA binding motifs (20Gary R. Park M.S. Nolan J.P. Cornelius H.L. Kozyreva O.G. Tran H.T. Lobachev K.S. Resnick M.A. Gordenin D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5373-5382Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 28Gary R. Kim K.

Tomkinson A.E. Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33703-33708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Partial retention of MMR function might reflect residual PCNA interactions with Msh2-Msh3 and Msh2-Msh6 at other sites or with other MMR proteins in a multiprotein complex. For example, yeast two-hybrid analysis indicates that PCNA interacts with Mlh1 (4Umar A. Buermeyer A.B. Simon J.A. Thomas D.C. Clark A.B. Liskay R.M. Kunkel T.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 65-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), and human PCNA co-immunoprecipitates in a complex containing MLH1 and PMS2 (6Gu L. Hong Y. McCulloch S. Watanabe H. Li G.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1173-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Any direct interactions of PCNA with MutL homologues may be at sites other than the interdomain connector loop of PCNA, because we did not find consensus PCNA binding motifs in either Mlh1 or Pms1. It is also possible that the intermediate mutator phenotypes of strains with substitutions in the Msh3 and Msh6 PCNA binding motifs reflect the importance of PCNA interactions for one form of MMR but not another. Just as replication enzymology differs on the leading and lagging strands, so too might MMR enzymology differ, e.g. at the origin, during chain elongation, or during Okazaki fragment processing. The role of PCNA may also depend on the relative locations of the mismatch and the strand discrimination signal. For example, the nick that can serve as a strand discrimination signal in vitro can be either 5′ or 3′ to the mismatch. The PCNA binding motif of MSH3 and MSH6 interacts with one of three potential binding sites in trimeric PCNA, potentially leaving two other binding sites on PCNA available for binding by other proteins. This may include a subunit of DNA polymerase δ, the replicative polymerase suggested to participate in DNA resynthesis during MMR (6Gu L. Hong Y. McCulloch S. Watanabe H. Li G.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1173-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 30Longley M.J. Pierce A.J. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10917-10921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Through this physical linkage, mismatches that escape proofreading at the primer terminus may be efficiently recognized just after emerging from the polymerase. The mismatch may then be removed by a 3′-exonuclease (identity unknown) via excision of a small number of nucleotides in what may be an extended form of proofreading. Alternative and not mutually exclusive models (reviewed in Refs. 1Buermeyer A.B. Deschenes S.M. Baker S.M. Liskay R.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 533-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar and 2Kolodner R.D. Marsischky G.T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar) are suggested by the fact that the eukaryotic MMR system can correct a mismatch that is hundreds of base pairs from a nick. Thus, PCNA might enhance processive movement of the MMR complex as it searches for a distant signal. In any MMR model, the asymmetry of both the MSH2-MSH6 heterodimer and PCNA may be important for orienting the MMR machinery to allow discrimination between the template and nascent strand. MSH3 and MSH6 also participate in other processes in cells, including cell cycle checkpoint control, apoptosis, repair of DNA strand breaks, transcription-coupled excision repair of DNA lesions, and recombination. To the extent that PCNA participates in these transactions, the ability of MSH3 and MSH6 to bind to PCNA may be important to their recruitment and functions in modulating cell survival and spontaneous and induced mutagenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2028719460,"In pregnant women infected with Plasmodium falciparum, the infected red blood cells (IRBCs) selectively accumulate in the intervillous spaces of placenta, leading to poor fetal outcome and severe health complications in the mother. Although chondroitin 4-sulfate is known to mediate IRBC adherence to placenta, the natural receptor has not been identified. In the present study, the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) of human placenta were purified and structurally characterized, and adherence of IRBCs to these CSPGs investigated. The data indicate that the placenta contains three distinct types of CSPGs: significant quantities of uniquely low sulfated, extracellular CSPGs localized in the intervillous spaces, minor amounts of two cell-associated CSPGs, and major amounts of dermatan sulfate-like CSPGs of the fibrous tissue. Of the various CSPGs isolated from the placenta, the low sulfated CSPGs of the intervillous spaces most efficiently bind IRBCs. Based on IRBC adherence capacities and localization patterns of various CSPGs, we conclude that the CSPGs of the intervillous spaces are the receptors for placental IRBC adherence. The identification and characterization of these CSPGs provide a valuable tool for understanding the precise molecular interactions involved in placental IRBC adherence and for the development of therapeutic strategies for maternal malaria. In the accompanying paper (Alkhalil, A., Achur, R. N., Valiyaveettil, M., Ockenhouse, C. F., and Gowda, D. C. (2000) J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1990512216,"To investigate how the protein kinase cdc7 stimulates DNA replication in metazoans, a soluble cell-free replication system derived from Xenopus eggs was used. DNA was incubated in egg cytosol to form prereplication complexes and then in nucleoplasmic extract to initiate DNA synthesis. We find that cdc7 is greatly enriched in nucleoplasmic extract and that this high concentration is essential for efficient DNA replication, supporting previous models that the nucleus activates replication indirectly by sequestering essential components. cdc7 binds to chromatin at the G(1)/S transition before initiation occurs, and it dissociates from chromatin as S phase progresses. The chromatin association of cdc7 requires chromatin-bound MCM. In turn, cdc7 is required to load the initiation factor cdc45 onto the DNA. Finally, efficient replication is observed when chromatin is exposed first to cdc7 and then to cdk2 but not when it is exposed to cdk2 before cdc7. Therefore, the cdc7- and cdk2-dependent initiation steps can be separated, indicating the existence of a novel, stable initiation intermediate. Moreover, the data suggest that cdk2 can only act after cdc7 has executed its function."

However, recent studies have shown that co-repressors bind to the same cavity formed by helices 3–5 and 12 in the ligand binding domain of nuclear receptors as do co-activators (8Hu X.

Upon ligand binding, the ligand binding domain undergoes a conformational change, releases corepressors, and recruits coactivators by re-positioning helix 12 (AF-2 domain).

Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that disruption of either Rpd3 or Hda1 in yeast resulted in global hyperacetylation of histones (19Rundlett S.E. Carmen A.A. Kobayashi R. Bavykin S. Turner B.M. Grunstein M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14503-14508Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). The acetylation of chromosomal histones is correlated strongly with active gene transcription; conversely, hypoacetylation of a gene regulatory region is usually indicative of gene silencing (22Turner B.M.

Sci. 2000; 25: 121-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Whereas acetylation of histones is not sufficient to dictate the efficiency of transcription, an overwhelmingly large volume of convincing evidence has supported the notion that the acetylation/deacetylation state of histones affects chromatin structures, thereby modulating the efficiency of transcription machinery. The human RIP140 was first demonstrated as a co-activator in a chimeric estrogen receptor system (26Cavailles V. Dauvois S. L'Horset F. Lopez G. Hoare S. Kushner P.J. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3741-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). The mouse RIP140 was cloned in this lab by screening mouse embryonic and testis libraries with the ligand binding domain of orphan nuclear receptor TR2 and was shown to be a potent co-repressor for TR2 in the absence of putative ligands (27Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. We L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Recently, we have demonstrated that mouse RIP140 interacts, in a ligand-dependent manner, with retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid receptor X (RXR). However, in contrast to the cases of classical co-activators that interact with ligand-bound hormone receptors to activate target gene expression, RIP140 interaction with holo-nuclear receptors results in suppressed target gene expression (28Lee C.-H. Wei L.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31320-31326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the ligand-dependent receptor-interacting motif of RIP140 is mapped to its C-terminal domain (28Lee C.-H. Wei L.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31320-31326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In most recent studies, RIP140 has also been shown as a co-repressor for other hormone nuclear receptors and orphan receptors (29Chuang F.M. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Schaufele F. Mol.

Despite the widely documented modulatory role of RIP140 in nuclear receptor actions, the actual function of RIP140 remains unclear. Moreover, none of these studies has provided a mechanism for the function of RIP140 in gene regulation. This study aims to address the enigmatic action of RIP140 by asking whether RIP140 action involves histone modification, and if so, how this may occur. It is demonstrated that the co-repressive and trans-repressive activities of RIP140 are sensitive to a HDAC inhibitor. A direct interaction of RIP140 with HDAC1 and HDAC3 is demonstrated using different in vitro and in vivoprotein interaction tests, and the HDAC-interacting domain of RIP140 is mapped to amino acids 78–303 of its N-terminal domain. Subsequently, it is demonstrated that histone deacetylation of the Gal4 DNA target sequences occurs as a result of expressing a Gal4 DNA binding domain (BD)-tethered RIP140 in the cells. Finally, the in vitroevidence for HDAC activities encoded by immunocomplexes precipitated with anti-RIP140 is provided. The full-length RIP140 fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain for testing trans-repressive activities, and full-length RIP140, RAR, RXR expression vectors for testing co-repressive activities, as well as Gal4-luc and DR5-thymidine kinase (tK)-luc reporters have been described (27Lee C.-H.

The techniques for culturing COS-1 cells, transfection, and luciferase and lacZ assays are as described (27Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. We L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). All cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing dextran charcoal-treated serum (DCC medium). For retinoic acid (RA) induction experiments, all-trans RA was added at a final concentration of 5 × 10−7m for 24 h. Each experiment was carried out in triplicate. At least three independent experiments were conducted to obtain the mean and the standard error of the mean (S.E.). COS-1 cells were transfected with Gal4 reporter and either Gal4 BD-RIP or Gal4-BD. The ChIP assay (33Luo R. Postigo A. Dean D. Cell. 1998; 92: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar) was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Histone was cross-linked to DNA by adding formaldehyde to a final concentration of 1%. Precipitated chromatin was incubated with an anti-acetylated histone 3 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. The immunocomplex was treated with proteinase K, and DNA was purified by phenol extraction for PCR detection with primers flanking the tk promoter region of the Gal4-tk-luc reporter (5′AGCGTCTTGTCATTGGCG3′ and 5′TTAAGCGGGTCGCTGCAG3′). Amplified fragments (130 bp) were analyzed on a 1.2% agarose gel. The amplified internal control SV40 promoter fragment is 300 bp in length. The GST pull-down assay was conducted as described (27Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. We L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Various RIP140 domains were cloned by fusing restriction fragments of RIP140 to the GST vector. The N-terminal amino acid (aa) 1–496 domain (RIP-N), central aa 333–1007 domain (RIP-Cent), and C-terminal aa 977–1161 domain (RIP-C) were obtained as EcoRI, NaeI/SmaI, andEcoRI fragments, respectively. The smaller N-terminal fragments, RIP-B, RIP-Na, RIP-Nc, and RIP-Sp, were obtained byBamHI, NaeI, NcoI, and SphI digestion, respectively, from RIP-N. Escherichia coliBL21 transformed with the GST fusion vectors were induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h, and fusion proteins were partially purified from glutathione-Sepharose columns. The partially purified GST·RIP fusion protein was incubated with [35S]Met-labeled HDAC1 or HDAC 3 for pull-down reaction as described (27Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. We L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The full-length HDAC1 and HDAC3 (20Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y.

Co-immunoprecipitation was conducted as described (27Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. We L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells (ATCC CRL-1573) were co-transfected with RIP140 plus an empty vector or a flag-HDAC3 vector (21Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Reciprocal experiments were conducted by co-transfecting cells with HDAC3 plus an empty vector or a flag-RIP vector. The flag-RIP was constructed by ligating the flag epitope to the C terminus of RIP. Cell lysates were incubated with anti-flag (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), followed by Western blot analyses of immunocomplexes with an anti-RIP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or an anti-HDAC3 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) for the reciprocal experiments. The histone deacetylase assay was modified from the protocol of Kolle et al. (34Kolle D. Brosch G. Lechner T. Lusser A. Loidl P. Methods ( Orlando ). 1998; 15: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Calf thymus histone (Sigma) was acetylated in vitro with [3H]acetyl-CoA (12 Ci/mm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with histone acetylase pCAF (35Liu L. Scolnick D.M. Trievel R.C. Zhang H.B. Marmorstein R. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1202-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar) expressed in E. coli(36Grant P.A Berger S.L. Workman J.L. Becker P.B. Chromatin Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 311-331Google Scholar). Deacetylase activity was determined by incubating 1.5 μg of [3H]acetyl histone with RIP140 immunocomplexes in a total volume of 100 μl of HDAC buffer (15 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 10 mm NaCl, 0.25 mm EDTA, 10 mmβ-2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol) for 2 h at 37 °C. Reaction mixtures were analyzed on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and gels were soaked in 1 m sodium salicylate (37Chamberlain J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 98: 132-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar), dried, and exposed to films. The biological activity of RIP140 in hormone receptor actions has been controversial. In the RAR/RXR system, we have demonstrated a ligand-induced interaction of RIP140 with RAR and RXR, and this interaction results in suppressed reporter activities (27Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. We L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To determine whether this effect of RIP140 involves histone deacetylases, co-transfection experiments were performed to test the effect of HDAC inhibitor, TSA, in a DR5-driven RA reporter system as shown in Fig. 1 A. A typical RA induction of this reporter is an approximately 50–100-fold-induction (Fig. 1 A, bars 1 and 4). However, RIP140 suppresses RA induction to an approximately 10-fold-induction (Fig. 1 A, bars 2 and 5). In the presence of TSA, the suppression can be partially released (to an approximately 30-fold-induction) (Fig. 1 A, bars 3 and6), suggesting a role of HDACs in the suppression of RA induction by RIP140. The biological activity of RIP140 was further addressed by directly tethering this molecule to the BD of Gal4 and assessing its effect on a Gal4 reporter. This Gal4 BD-RIP140 fusion protein exerts a trans-repressive activity on the Gal4 reporter approximately 5–6 folds as shown in Fig. 1 B. Consistent with the results obtained from the DR5 reporter system, this trans-repressive activity can also be partially reversed by TSA in a dose-dependent manner (25–250 nm). Therefore, RIP140 suppresses RA-induced reporter gene expression and encodes a transferable repressive activity. Additionally, these biological activities of RIP140 may involve the action of HDACs. To determine whether RIP140 can recruit HDACs, several protein interaction tests were performed. Because of the intrinsic suppressive activity of both RIP140 and HDACs on gene activities, which would complicate reporter assays, the two-hybrid-based protein interaction tests were not suitable for the studies of RIP140 interaction with HDACs. Therefore, we used several in vivo and in vitro approaches that did not rely on reporter assays. We first utilized a co-immunoprecipitation method to investigate immunocomplexes precipitated through either the RIP140 or the HDAC moiety. The HEK293 cells were co-transfected with RIP140 plus an empty vector or a flag-HDAC3 vector, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-flag. The immunocomplexes were analyzed on a Western blot using an anti-RIP antibody. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the anti-RIP antibody detects a specific band at the size of approximately 140 kDa in the culture co-transfected with RIP140 plus flag-HDAC3 (lane 4) but not in the culture lacking flag-HDAC3 (lane 3). The expression of RIP140 was monitored in total cell lysate as shown inlanes 1 and 2 on the same gel. A control experiment was conducted by using a nonspecific rabbit antiserum in immunoprecipitation for both transfected cultures (lanes 5and 6). No specific band of RIP140 was detected on this control experiment. In the reciprocal experiment (Fig. 2 B) where cells were co-transfected with HDAC3 plus an empty vector or a flag-RIP vector, the anti-HDAC3 antibody detected a band of approximately 52 kDa in the precipitate of the flag-RIP plus HDAC3-transfected culture (lane 4) but not the control lacking the flag-RIP (lane 3). The expression of HDAC3 was also monitored in the total cell lysates of these two cultures (lanes 1 and 2) on the same gel, where abundant HDAC3 was detected in the negative control (lane 1). Together, these results clearly demonstrate that RIP140 and HDAC3 are present in the same complexes. To investigate whether RIP140 can interact directly with HDACs, anin vitro protein interaction test, a GST pull-down assay, was conducted. A strong interaction of RIP140 with HDAC1 and HDAC3 was observed (see Fig. 2). To map the interaction domain, the full-length RIP140 was first dissected into three overlapping fragments and several smaller fragments to map the HDAC-interacting domain as shown in Fig. 2 C. Fig. 2 D shows the results of GST pull-down assays. The upper panel shows the phosphorimage of the [35S]Met label, representing one half of the HDAC1 and HDAC3 signal in each pull-down reaction. Thelower panel shows a Coomassie Blue-stained protein gel resolving the other half of the pull-down complexes of each reaction. The full-length RIP140 interacts with both HDAC 1 and 3 (Fig. 2 D, upper panel, lane 9). Among the three overlapping fragments, RIP-N, RIP-Cent, and RIP-C (Fig. 2 D, upper panel, lanes 8, 3, and2, respectively), only RIP-N interacts with HDACs in this assay (Fig. 2 D, upper panel, lane 8). Among the four smaller fragments of RIP-N, only RIP-Sp (Fig. 2 D, upper panel, lane 4) fails to interact with HDACs, indicating that the critical HDAC-interacting motif of RIP140 is located within the N-terminal SphI (Fig. 2 D, upper panel, lane 4) toNaeI (Fig. 2 D, upper panel, lane 5) fragment, aa 78–303. The presence of GST·RIP fusion protein in each pull-down reaction was demonstrated in the lower panel of Fig. 2 D. Asterisks on each lane (Fig. 2 D, lower panel) indicate the GST·RIP fusion of each construct in the pull-down complexes. From these protein interaction tests, it is concluded that RIP140 interacts with HDAC1 and HDAC3 directly and that the HDAC-interacting motif of RIP140 is mapped to its N-terminal domain. The region between aa 78 and aa 303 of RIP140 is critical for HDAC interaction, based upon the GST pull-down assay. To address the effect of Gal4 BD-RIP on the histone acetylation state of its DNA target, ChIP assays were conducted to examine the histone deacetylation of its target promoter in COS1 cells. In this assay, acetylated chromatin is precipitated with anti-acetyl histone 3, and the precipitated DNA fragments are amplified in PCR reactions. Conversely, deacetylated chromatin is precipitated; therefore, no DNA fragments are precipitated or amplified. As shown in the top panel of Fig. 3, an expected 130-bp fragment can be amplified from chromatin prepared from cells transfected with the control Gal4 BD vector (lane 1) but not from cells transfected with Gal4 BD-RIP expression vector (lane 2), indicating that deacetylation occurred on the chromatin target in the presence of Gal4 BD-RIP but not Gal4 BD. In Fig. 3, lanes 3and 4 show the negative controls where a nonspecific rabbit antiserum was used, lanes 5 and 6 show positive controls of input DNA before precipitation, lane 7 shows a negative control of water, and lane 8 shows a positive control of plasmid DNA. This result indicates that the expression of Gal4 BD-RIP140 renders histone deacetylation on the Gal4 target. In the absence of the RIP140 moiety, histone remains acetylated on this promoter despite its binding by Gal4 BD. For an internal control of this assay, the acetylation status of the SV40 promoter on a SV-lacZ vector co-transfected into the cells was monitored in a parallel experiment as shown in the lower panel of Fig. 3. Because no Gal4 binding site was present in this expression vector, this promoter was acetylated, and therefore amplified, regardless of the presence or absence of Gal4 BD-RIP140 (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and2). This result clearly shows the specificity of deacetylation on the promoter containing the Gal4 binding sites, as a result of Gal4 BD-RIP140 expression.Figure 4Determination of the HDAC enzyme activity of RIP140 immunocomplexes. The HDAC enzyme assay of the immunocomplexes (upper panel) was conducted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Samples are as follows: control-labeled histones (lane 1), anti-flag-precipitated flag-HDAC3-transfected cells (lane 2), and anti-RIP140-precipitated cells transfected with RIP140 plus flag-HDAC3 (lane 3) or flag-HDAC3 alone (lane 4). Thelower panel shows the flag-HDAC detected by anti-flag antibody in the total lysate of untransfected cells (lane 1) and transfected cultures (lanes 2–4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether RIP140 complexes precipitated from cell lysates encode HDAC activities, cells (one 10-cm plate of HEK293 cells) were co-transfected with RIP140 and flag-HDAC3 to overexpress these proteins. Lysates were collected and immunoprecipitated with anti-RIP. The immunocomplex was resuspended in 100 μl, and 50 μl was used in each HDAC assay. As shown on the upper panel of Fig. 4, RIP140 immunocomplexes from cultures cotransfected with RIP140 and flag-HDAC3 (lane 3) encode HDAC activities. Fig. 4, lane 2 shows a positive control where a lysate of cells transfected with flag-HDAC3 alone was immunoprecipitated with anti-flag. One negative control that was transfected with flag-HDAC3 (lane 4) alone and precipitated with anti-RIP140 shows very low activity. To monitor the expression of flag-HDAC3 in transfected cultures, the total lysate of all the transfected cultures (Fig. 4, lanes 2–4) was detected with anti-flag as shown on the lower panel. Therefore, immunocomplexes of RIP140 from RIP140- and HDAC-overexpressing cells encode HDAC enzyme activities higher than the background level, indicating that RIP140 is able to recruit HDACs to form more active enzyme complexes in the precipitates. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that RIP140 encodes a TSA-sensitive trans-repressive activity and that RIP140 is able to directly interact with HDACs in vitro and in vivo. The HDAC-interacting domain of RIP140 is mapped to its N-terminal domain, between amino acids 78 and 303. By using the Gal4 BD-RIP and Gal4 reporter system in ChIP assays, we demonstrate histone deacetylation on the chromatin of the Gal4 target site as a result of Gal4-RIP140 expression. Furthermore, the immunocomplexes of RIP140 from cells cotransfected with RIP140 and HDAC expression vectors are able to deacetylate histone proteins in vitro. This study presents the first evidence for RIP140 as a negative regulator for nuclear receptor actions by directly recruiting histone deacetylases and categorizes RIP140 as a novel negative coregulator that is able to directly interact with HDACs. The actions of RIP140 have been disputed over different experimental systems, partly because these studies are based upon reporter activities in cotransfection experiments. Therefore, the mechanism underlying the actions of RIP140 cannot be elucidated. The current study takes a direct approach and provides biochemical evidence for the direct association of RIP140 with HDACs. However, as shown in Fig. 1, TSA can only partially block the action of RIP140. It is quite possible that RIP140 also involves other pathways to modulate gene activities. Another interesting observation is that whereas cells overexpressing RIP140 and HDAC3 show HDAC activities in an in vitro assay (Fig. 4, lane 3), the endogenous RIP140 does not seem to be in sufficient quantity to precipitate overexpressed HDAC3 for anin vitro assay (Fig. 4, lane 4). In our previous study, we have shown that RIP140 is expressed in many cell types but at a low level (27Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. We L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It is possible that the expression level or local concentration of RIP140 is also critical for its ability to recruit HDACs. Given the fact that RIP140 can interact with many nuclear factors, it will be important to investigate the dynamics and kinetics of RIP140 interaction with these nuclear factors in the future. Unlike typical nuclear receptor corepressors that exert repressive effects by recruiting HDACs through Sin3 complexes (4Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.M. Soderstrom M. Laherty C.D. Torchia J. Yang W.-M. Brard G. Ngo S.D. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar, 7Nagy L. Kao H.Y.

Cell. 1997; 89: 373-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar), RIP140 is able to directly interact with HDACs. The HDAC-interacting motif is mapped to aa 78–303 based upon GST pull-down results (Fig. 2 B). In our preliminary studies, RIP140 was also shown to be able to interact with HDAC4, a class II HDAC (data not shown). The HDAC-interacting property of RIP140 would categorize RIP140 in a distinct family of nuclear receptor coregulators that directly associate with chromatin remodeling complexes. We are currently investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between RIP140 and HDACs. In addition to this unique property, RIP140 exhibits three other interesting features. First, for hormone receptors, ligand induces an enhanced interaction of receptors with RIP140. However, unlike coactivator interaction with holo-receptors, which usually involves an interacting motif (LXXLL) (38Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G.

Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K.

We L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, its interaction with holo-RAR and holo-RXR is mediated through its C-terminal domain, which lacks a LXXLL motif (28Lee C.-H. Wei L.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31320-31326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Second, RIP140 is able to interact with a large number of nuclear receptors in both ligand-dependent and -independent manners (27Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. We L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 28Lee C.-H. Wei L.-N. J. Biol.

For instance, the TR2 orphan receptor-interacting domain of RIP140 has been mapped to the N-terminal and central portions of this molecule (27Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. We L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar); yet RA-induced interaction of RAR/RXR utilizes the C-terminal domain (28Lee C.-H. Wei L.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31320-31326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Third, interaction of RIP140 with wild type nuclear receptors mostly results in suppressed gene activities, for both ligand-bound receptors and apo-receptors (27Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. We L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 28Lee C.-H. Wei L.-N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 18121-18127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Controversial studies have shown some activation function of RIP140 in nuclear receptor-mediated gene expression (40Dudley M.W. Sheeler C.Q. Wang H. Khan S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3696-3701Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 41Henttu P.M.A. Kalkhoven E. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1832-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). However, these studies also demonstrate some unusual features of RIP140. For instance, RIP140 is able to interact with antagonist-occupied receptors such as ICI182,780-occupied ER (40Dudley M.W. Sheeler C.Q. Wang H. Khan S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3696-3701Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In another study, RIP140 suppresses E2-dependent ER activation but activates the E2-dependent ER mutant K366A (41Henttu P.M.A. Kalkhoven E. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1832-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In the VDR system, RIP140 also interacts with VDR in the presence of 1,25-(OH)2D3 (42Masuyama H. Brownfield C.M. St.-Arnaud R. MacDonald P.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1507-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These features are quite distinct from that suggested for a typical coactivator or corepressor based upon the current working model. Therefore, RIP140 may be categorized under a distinct family of coregulators that interact extensively with various factors to affect transcription efficiency. Among these, HDAC families are of significant interest and may account for, at least partially, the widely documented suppressive activities of RIP140 in different experimental systems. Questions remain as to how RIP140 may differentially interact with both apo- and holo-nuclear receptors and what other transcription components may be affected by RIP140."

Tsien R.W. J. Physiol. ( Lond ). 1982; 329: 589-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and inactivation (2Hadley R.W. Lederer W.J. J. Physiol. ( Lond ). 1991; 444: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms for these processes remain incompletely understood, critical molecular determinants for Ca2+-dependent facilitation and inactivation of the L-type calcium channel have been attributed to the cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal tail of the α1 subunit, which contains a putative Ca2+ binding EF hand motif (3Kretsinger R.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1976; 45: 239-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) and an “IQ-like” motif (4De Leon M. Wang Y. Jones L. Perez-Reyes E. Wei X. Soong T.W. Snutch T.P. Yue D.T.

The latter resembles the IQ domains that bind Ca2+-free calmodulin (apoCaM)1 (8Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar), and consistent with this, Peterson et al. (5Peterson B.Z. DeMaria C.D. Adelman J.P. Yue D.T. Neuron. 1999; 22: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar) and Qin et al. (9Qin N. Olcese R. Bransby M. Lin T. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2435-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) determined that calmodulin (CaM) was necessary for calcium-dependent inactivation of the cardiac channel. P/Q channels have also been shown to be modulated by calmodulin (10Lee A. Wong S.T. Gallagher D. Li B. Storm D.R. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). The IQ-like domain in the L-type channels appears to bind primarily Ca2+-CaM rather than apoCaM (5Peterson B.Z. DeMaria C.D. Adelman J.P. Yue D.T. Neuron. 1999; 22: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). An isoleucine to alanine mutation in this motif results in loss of Ca2+-dependent inactivation and unmasks a strong facilitation by CaM (11Zuhlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. Nature. 1999; 399: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 12Zuhlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21121-21129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). If the isoleucine is changed to a glutamate, the effects of CaM (inactivation and facilitation) are lost (11Zuhlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. Nature. 1999; 399: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). A double mutation of I1624A/Q1625A (Swiss Prot Q0815) produced an even more pronounced facilitation (12Zuhlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21121-21129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These investigators concluded that Ca2+-dependent inactivation requires strong binding of CaM to the IQ motif. Peterson et al. (5Peterson B.Z. DeMaria C.D. Adelman J.P. Yue D.T. Neuron. 1999; 22: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar) find that a mutant CaM that cannot bind Ca2+ at any of the four Ca2+ binding sites blocks the effects of Ca2+-CaM on the L-type Ca2+ channel, suggesting that both the Ca2+-free and Ca2+-bound forms of CaM bind to this channel. However, only the Ca2+-bound form can induce inactivation (5Peterson B.Z. DeMaria C.D. Adelman J.P. Yue D.T. Neuron. 1999; 22: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). In particular, it appears that Ca2+ binding to sites 3 and 4 of CaM are required for Ca2+-dependent inactivation (5Peterson B.Z. DeMaria C.D. Adelman J.P. Yue D.T. Neuron. 1999; 22: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Other studies suggest that the IQ motif may not be the only determinant necessary for Ca2+-dependent inactivation of the channel (7Zuhlke R.D. Reuter H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3287-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 13Soldatov N.M. Oz M. O'Brien K.A. Abernethy D.R. Morad M. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1997; 110: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) replaced the I-II loop of the cardiac channel with the corresponding loop of the skeletal channel, which slowed Ca2+-dependent inactivation. An effect of replacing the II-III loop was also observed. The role of the EF hands of the carboxyl-terminal region of the α1 subunit of the L-type channel in Ca2+-dependent inactivation has been controversial (6Zhou J. Olcese R. Qin N. Noceti F. Birnbaumer L. Stefani E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2301-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 7Zuhlke R.D. Reuter H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. 1998; 75: 1727-1739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) found that mutations in the EF hand altered Ca2+-dependent inactivation, but Zhou et al. (6Zhou J. Olcese R. Qin N. Noceti F. Birnbaumer L. Stefani E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2301-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) found that mutant channels containing a triple mutation that disrupted Ca2+ coordinating activity was still inhibited by Ca2+. Recently, Peterson et al.(14Peterson B.Z. Lee J.S. Mulle J.G. Wang Y. de Leon M. Yue D.T. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1906-1920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) demonstrated that replacing four amino acids (VVTL) in the F helix of the putative EF hand of α1C with those of the α1E (MYEM) channel completely abolished Ca2+-dependent inactivation. In contrast, mutating the residues presumably involved in coordinating Ca2+ reduced the inactivation only about 2-fold. These authors suggested that the EF hand plays a role in transducing the signal generated by Ca2+ binding to CaM into channel inactivation. Other regions of the carboxyl tail are also likely to be involved in Ca2+-dependent inactivation. Soldatov et al. (13Soldatov N.M. Oz M. O'Brien K.A. Abernethy D.R. Morad M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 957-963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) found that mutating regions between the EF hand and the IQ motif (IKTEG and LLDQV) eliminated Ca2+-dependent inactivation. They suggested that a cooperative interaction between these two regions contributed to Ca2+-dependent inactivation. Zuhlke and Reuter (7Zuhlke R.D. Reuter H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3287-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) used deletions to show that three different domains (the putative EF hand, the IQ domain, and the two-amino acid motif, NE, at amino acids 1630 and 1631 of the cardiac L-type channel) are important for the inactivation process. Sequences within the region between amino acids 1572 and 1651 have also been suggested to be important for regulating targeting, conductance, and open probability of the channel (17Kepplinger K.J. Kahr H. Forstner G. Sonnleitner M. Schindler H. Schmidt T. Groschner K. Soldatov N.M. Romanin C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Peterson et al. (5Peterson B.Z. DeMaria C.D. Adelman J.P. Yue D.T. Neuron. 1999; 22: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar) compared the binding of Ca2+-CaM to the IQ-like motifs from N-, P/Q-, and R-type calcium channel α subunits. In their study, the P/Q-type (α1A), R-type (α1E), and N-type (α1B) calcium channels bound Ca2+-CaM, but α1B had a much lower affinity. P/Q-type calcium channels display a small amount of calcium-dependent inactivation, whereas R and N do not. If Ca2+-CaM binding to the α1C is responsible for Ca2+-dependent inactivation, this result raises the question of the functional role of CaM when bound to R- and N-type calcium channels, since they do not undergo Ca2+-dependent inactivation. In this study we show that the IQ domain of the L-type binds partially Ca2+-saturated calmodulin, whereas the IQ domains of P/Q, R, and N have a much lower apparent affinity for the partially Ca2+-saturated calmodulin. We also show that another sequence (CB) found in the carboxyl-terminal region of L-type channels binds partially and fully Ca2+-saturated CaM and enhancesICa facilitation in cardiac myocytes, suggesting that CB can participate in Ca2+-dependent modulation of ICa. This sequence is found between amino acids 1484 and 1509 in skeletal L-type (α1S) and amino acids 1627–1652 in the cardiac L-type channel (α1C). This region has recently been shown to play a role in membrane targeting of the L-type channel (18Gao T. Bunemann M. Gerhardstein B.L. Ma H. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25436-25444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility of a role for calmodulin in this process. The corresponding regions of α1E (amino acids 1828–1853), α1A (1917–1942), and α1B(1815–1840) do not bind calmodulin. This region in L-type channels has been shown by Soldatov et al. (13Soldatov N.M. Oz M. O'Brien K.A. Abernethy D.R. Morad M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 957-963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) to be important for Ca2+-dependent inactivation. The finding that two domains of cardiac L-type channels bind CaM and each of these binds partially Ca2+-saturated CaM suggests the possibility that both of these domains may contribute to the Ca2+-dependent modulation of L-type Ca2+ channels. Bovine brain calmodulin (95% pure) was purchased from Sigma, solubilized in 10 mm MOPS, 1 mmEGTA, 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.4, and quantified by absorption from 320 to 277 nm to obtain stock solutions of about 300 μm. Peptides were synthesized at the protein lab facility at Baylor College of Medicine and diluted into 200 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, for assays. The antipeptide antibody was prepared by immunization of rabbits with a peptide representing amino acids 1484–1509 of the skeletal L-type channel coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. All electrophoresis reagents were analytical grade from Bio-Rad. Calmodulin electrophoretic mobility was evaluated by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under discontinuous conditions as a modified technique described by Laemmli (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Calmodulin in 200 μmCaCl2 was incubated with the peptides in molar ratios of peptide to calmodulin of 0.1:1, 0.5:1, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 5:1, 10:1. Gels evaluating the ability of mutant calmodulins to bind peptides were in molar ratios of peptide to calmodulin of 0.1:1, 1:1, 2:1, 5:1, 10:1 in 200 μm CaCl2. The extent of the interaction was quantified by densitometer analysis of the absorbance of the uncomplexed CaM at each peptide to CaM molar ratio. Values were normalized to the absorbance in the absence of peptide. Peptide (730 pmol, 2.9 μm) in 100 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, was added to 730 pmol of brain calmodulin in buffers containing Ca2+ ranging from 1 nm to 100 μm. The solution was excited at 280 nm, and emission was detected at 330 nm. Microtiter plates were coated with CHAPS-solubilized sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes (100 μg of protein/well). The plates were then blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin and incubated in the presence of 2 μm CaM. The antipeptide antibody (serial dilutions 1:100 to 1:200,000) was added, and the samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The secondary goat anti-rabbit (dilution 1:3000) coupled to alkaline phosphatase was added, and the incubation was continued for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, the plates were developed with the alkaline phosphatase substrate, p-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium salt. T-tubule membranes and purified DHPR were prepared as we have previously described (20Hamilton S.L. Hawkes M.J. Brush K. Cook R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7820-7828Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting were performed as described previously (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar, 21Callaway C. Seryshev A. Wang J.P. Slavik K. Needleman D.H. Cantu C. Wu Y. Jayaaraman T. Marks A.R. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15876-15884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples (1–2 μg of protein), corresponding to the purified L-type calcium channel were applied to a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. One gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and another gel was transferred for Western blotting (21Callaway C. Seryshev A. Wang J.P. Slavik K. Needleman D.H. Cantu C. Wu Y. Jayaaraman T. Marks A.R. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15876-15884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The primary antibody used was a sequence-specific antibody to amino acids 1484–1509 of skeletal L-type channel, and the second antibody was a goat anti-rabbit antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase. The blots were developed using the SuperSignal chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce). For competition experiments, CaM (2 μm) was incubated with the blot for 6–8 h at 4 °C before the addition of the first antibody. Voltage clamp experiments were performed in whole cell mode (22Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15149) Google Scholar) with freshly isolated rabbit ventricular myocytes, (23Wu Y. MacMillan L.B. McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. Anderson M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: H2168-H2178PubMed Google Scholar). L-type Ca2+current (ICa) was isolated by adding Cs+ and tetraethylammonium chloride and reducing Na+ and K+ in the pipette and bath solutions. Elimination of the residual current by nifedipine (10 μm) confirmed that the identity of active current wasICa (not shown). ICa was activated (0.5 Hz) by voltage command pulses from −80 to +10 mV for 300 ms at 24 °C. Total charge movement was determined by integrating inward ICa during the command step using pClamp 6.2 (Axon Instruments) and expressed as a ratio of the nth to the 1st stimulated “beat.” The pipette (intracellular) solution was 120.0 mm CsCl, 10.0 mm EGTA, 10.0 mm HEPES, 10.0 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 5.0 mm phosphocreatine, 3.0 mmCaCl2, 1.0 mm MgATP, 1.0 mm NaGTP, and pH was adjusted to 7.2 with 1.0 n CsOH. The calculated resting free [Ca2+] was ∼100 nm (24Bers D.M. Patton C.W. Nuccitelli R. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) in the pipette solution. In some experiments, the CaM-binding peptide CB-L-B (100 μm) was included in the pipette solution, and all cells were dialyzed for ≥5 min before initiating experiments. The bath (extracellular) solution was N-methyl-D-glucamine 137.0 mm, 25.0 mm CsCl, 10.0 mm HEPES, 10.0 mm glucose, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.5 nm MgCl2, and the pH was adjusted to 7.4 with 12 n HCl. For experiments designed to eliminate CaM binding, Ca2+ was omitted, EGTA was substituted with BAPTA in the pipette solution, and Ba2+ was substituted for Ca2+ in the bath solution. The null hypothesis was rejected for p < 0.05 using the unpaired Student'st test or analysis of variance as appropriate, and data were expressed as means ± S.E. Partial sequences for the carboxyl-terminal tails of the different voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels are shown in Fig. 1. IQ peptides corresponding to the IQ motif of the different voltage-dependent channels areunderlined and italicized in this figure. The cardiac IQ motif has been shown to contribute to CaM binding and Ca2+-dependent inactivation (5Peterson B.Z. DeMaria C.D. Adelman J.P. Yue D.T.

However, other sequences in the carboxyl-terminal region of α1C have also been shown to play important roles in Ca2+-dependent inactivation. Soldatov et al. (13Soldatov N.M. Oz M. O'Brien K.A. Abernethy D.R. Morad M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 957-963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) indicated the amino acids IKTEG and LLDQV, whereas Zuhlkeet al. (7Zuhlke R.D. Reuter H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3287-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) suggested that the Asn and Glu at positions 1630 and 1631 were crucial for inactivation. This region of the cardiac L-type channel is highly homologous to that of the skeletal L-type channel, with only two conservative changes (TableI, italicized letters). To address the question of how this region of the L-type channels contributes to CaM binding, we synthesized a peptide with the sequence containing these elements. The primary interest of our current studies is the skeletal muscle protein, and therefore, we prepared a peptide matching the skeletal sequence (designated CB-L-A, Table I). Other shorter peptides synthesized (see below) had identical sequences in the cardiac and skeletal proteins.Figure 3Comparison of the Interaction of the IQ and CB peptides with CaM.

Open table in a new tab IQ peptides and CB peptides of L-type, P/Q-, N-, and R-type voltage-dependent calcium channels are shown. The qualitative results of the analyses described in Fig. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 are also shown in this table. The underlined sequences have been previously shown to be required for Ca2+-dependent inactivation of the L-type channels. To assess the interaction of the peptide with CaM, we examined its ability to bind to CaM on nondenaturing gels. The interaction was analyzed by measuring the absorbance of the CaM band at increasing peptide to CaM ratios in the presence of 200 μmCa2+. As shown in Fig. 2, CB-L-A binds CaM in the presence of Ca2+. A representative Coomassie-stained gel is shown in Fig. 2 A, top panel, and the absorbance of the CaM band with increasing peptide for three independent experiments is shown in Fig. 2 B. To determine which amino acids in this sequence are important for the interaction with CaM, we synthesized several other peptides (CB-L-B, CB-L-C, CB-L-D). The sequences of these peptides are shown in Table I. All of the peptides were able to interact with Ca2+-CaM (Fig. 2), suggesting that only the sequence LRAIIKKIWKRTSMKLL is required for CaM binding. The two shorter peptides (CB-L-C and CB-L-D) both produced multiple bands in the presence of CaM. The reason for this is not clear. It may be that, under these conditions, more than one peptide can bind to the CaM molecule, possibly by binding at each of the two CaM lobes. We chose CB-L-B, whose sequence is the same in the cardiac and skeletal muscle L-type channels and has similar affinity for CaM as CB-L-A, for subsequent studies because of its simpler gel pattern and because it was shorter and hence less expensive to prepare than CB-L-A. We next synthesized two sets of peptides: 1) peptides matching the IQ motifs from cardiac L-, skeletal L- and the P/Q-, N-, and R-type voltage-dependent calcium channels and 2) peptides matching the regions that most closely align with the CB region of these same channels. The sequences of these peptides are shown in Table I. We assessed and compared the interaction of these peptides (both IQ and CB) with CaM on nondenaturing gels. These data for the IQ and CB peptides are summarized in Fig. 3,A and B, respectively. We found, in agreement with Peterson et al. (5Peterson B.Z. DeMaria C.D. Adelman J.P. Yue D.T. Neuron. 1999; 22: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar), that the IQ domains from all of the different channels bound CaM in the presence of Ca2+. Of the CB peptides, only those corresponding to L-type channels were able to bind CaM with high affinity in the presence of Ca2+. The CB-R, however, showed a small amount of binding at high molar ratios. All of the IQ peptides had a strong affinity for CaM with a relative order at high Ca2+ of IQ-Lc = IQ-R > IQ-P/Q > IQ-L-sk > IQ-N. In contrast, only the CB peptide from the L-type Ca2+ channels had a significant affinity for CaM. Previous studies suggest that the L-type channel (cardiac) can bind CaM at low Ca2+ (5Peterson B.Z. DeMaria C.D. Adelman J.P. Yue D.T. Neuron. 1999; 22: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). None of the peptides used in our study were able to bind to CaM if the gels were electrophoresed in the presence of 1 mm EGTA with no added Ca2+(data not shown). This binding site, therefore, does not represent a binding site for apoCaM. We next examined the ability of the various peptides to bind to CaMs that are mutated in the first two (B12), the second two (B34), or all four Ca2+ binding sites (B1234) on CaM. All mutations in CaM involve Glu to Gln substitutions at thez positions for coordinating Ca2+, resulting in a greatly decreased affinity of the EF hand for Ca2+ (25Mukherjea P. Maune J.F. Beckingham K. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 468-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All gels were electrophoresed in the presence of 200 μmCa2+. Consistent with the findings with apoCaM, none of the peptides could bind to the B1234 mutant (data not shown). However, as can be seen in Fig. 4, both the IQ peptide from the cardiac L-type channel and CB-L-B peptide were able to bind B12 with an affinity similar to that seen with the wild type CaM. The IQ-P/Q and IQ-R peptides could also bind B12, but to a lesser extent. The cardiac IQ peptide was also able to bind B34. None of the other peptides bound B34 as well as IQ-Lc. The mutation of either the amino- or carboxyl-terminal Ca2+ binding sites in CaM greatly reduced the affinity of the IQ domains of the skeletal L-type, R-type, and N-type to bind CaM, suggesting that these sites prefer fully Ca2+ saturated CaM. The other CB-L peptides (A, C, and D) bound the mutant CaMs similar to CB-L-B (data not shown). To quantify the Ca2+ dependence of the cardiac L-type CB peptide-CaM interaction we examined the change in tryptophan fluorescence of the CB peptide upon binding CaM. The emission spectra for the peptide and CaM, alone and in combination, are shown in Fig. 5 A. The binding of CaM to the peptide increases the emission and results in a shift of the peak to shorter wavelengths. The Ca2+ dependence of this interaction is shown in Fig. 5 B. The EC50 for the Ca2+-dependent enhancement of the CB-L-B peptide-CaM interaction is 105 ± 5 nm(n = 3). The absence of a tryptophan in the IQ peptides prevented this type of analysis of their Ca2+dependence. Nondenaturing gels in which the CB-L-B peptide was added at increasing concentrations to a 2:1 mixture of IQ-Lsk (Fig. 6 A) and CaM, respectively, showed that the CB-L-B peptide could apparently displace the Lsk- IQ peptide from its complex with CaM, indicating a competitive interaction of these two peptides. In contrast, a 1:1 mixture of IQ-Lc (Fig. 6 B) with CaM showed very little displacement by CB-L-B. This is likely due to the higher affinity of IQ-Lc compared with IQ-Lsk for CaM. There is no band corresponding to CaM complexed simultaneously to both peptides. These data clearly show that L-IQ and CB-L-B cannot bind simultaneously to CaM. Our data support a model in which the CB and IQ regions represent either distinct or alternative binding sites rather than both sequences contributing to a single binding site. To demonstrate that the full-length α1S subunit can bind calmodulin at a site close to the CB sequence, we prepared an anti-peptide antibody to peptide CB-L-B and examined the ability of calmodulin to block the binding of the antibody to the α1 subunit of the DHPR on Western blots (Fig. 7 A). The skeletal protein was used for these studies because it is more abundant than the cardiac channel, and its sequence in the CB region is identical to that of the cardiac channel. Pre-incubation of the blots with calmodulin before the addition of the antibody blocked the labeling of this subunit by antibody, suggesting that the denatured α1S protein bound calmodulin at a site close to the antibody binding site. To assess the effects of calmodulin on the binding of the antibody to a channel in the presence of a nondenaturing detergent, we partially solubilized membranes in CHAPS and examined the ability of calmodulin to block the interaction with the antibody in an enzyme-linked immunoabsorbance assay (Fig. 7 B). Again, calmodulin blocked the interaction of the antibody with the DHPR. The L-type Ca2+ channel IQ domain can powerfully directICa facilitation (11Zuhlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W.

To test for possible L-type Ca2+ channel regulatory actions of CB,ICa was measured in cardiomyocytes dialyzed with CB-L-B under conditions favorable or adverse to Ca2+-CaM-dependent binding. CB-L-B enhancedICa facilitation compared with control cells in the presence of a physiologic intracellular Ca2+concentration (Fig. 8, a,b, and e), but CB-L-B was without effect onICa during increased intracellular Ca2+ buffering when extracellular Ca2+ was substituted for Ba2+ (Fig. 8, c, d, and e). These data support the hypothesis that CB helps to determine Ca2+-CaM-dependent regulation of L-type Ca2+ currents. L-type Ca2+ channels show Ca2+-dependent inactivation that requires CaM. Recent work has centered on the IQ-like domain in the carboxyl terminus of the α subunit in Ca2+ channels as representing the CaM binding site. However, this is an incomplete picture since voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels that do not show Ca2+-dependent inactivation bind CaM at their corresponding IQ-like sequences in the carboxyl terminus. This raises the question of why the binding of Ca2+-CaM to the IQ domain on the L-type channel leads to Ca2+-dependent inactivation, whereas the binding to IQ domains of the other channels does not. If the IQ domain is the primary binding site for CaM on these channels, the binding to the IQ domain of the L-type channel must lead to a secondary change that does not occur in the other channels. Recently Soldatov et al. (13Soldatov N.M. Oz M. O'Brien K.A. Abernethy D.R. Morad M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 957-963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), Zuhlke and Reuter (7Zuhlke R.D. Reuter H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3287-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and Peterson et al.(14Peterson B.Z. Lee J.S. Mulle J.G. Wang Y. de Leon M. Yue D.T. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1906-1920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) found that determinants outside of the IQ motif are necessary for Ca2+-dependent inactivation. Soldatov et al. (13Soldatov N.M. Oz M. O'Brien K.A. Abernethy D.R. Morad M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 957-963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) showed that the sequences IKTEG and LLDQV are required, and Zuhlke and Reuter (7Zuhlke R.D. Reuter H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3287-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) demonstrated the requirement for the IQ domain and residues 1630 and 1631 for Ca2+-dependent inactivation (7Zuhlke R.D. Reuter H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3287-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). These sequences immediately bracket the CB sequence in L-type channels that we have shown binds CaM. Petersen et al. (14Peterson B.Z. Lee J.S. Mulle J.G. Wang Y. de Leon M. Yue D.T. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1906-1920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the exchange of the sequence VVTL in the F helix of the putative EF hand with the corresponding sequence of the R channel abolished Ca2+-dependent inactivation. The widely spaced regions of the carboxyl tail involved in Ca2+-dependent inactivation suggest that some of these regions are involved in the CaM binding, whereas others may contribute to the regulation of the channel that occurs after CaM binds. Other portions might be crucial for the communication between these two domains. Our data with the different IQ and CB peptides are summarized in TableI. Consistent with the results of Peterson et al. (5Peterson B.Z. DeMaria C.D. Adelman J.P. Yue D.T. Neuron. 1999; 22: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar), we found that the IQ peptides matching the sequence from the L, P/Q, N, and R channels all bound Ca2+-CaM. However, only cardiac IQ-L was able to bind (in the presence of Ca2+) the CaMs mutated in the Ca2+ binding sites (B12 and B34) with an affinity comparable with that of wild type CaM. The P/Q and R channel IQ peptides bound B12 CaM and B34 CaM with reduced affinity compared with wild type CaM, and the N and L-sk IQ peptide showed no ability to bind these mutant CaMs. None of the peptides were able to bind to CaM in less than 10 nanomolar Ca2+ concentrations or to a CaM mutated at all four Ca2+ binding sites. These peptides do not, therefore, represent binding sites for apoCaM. The cardiac L-type channel and, to a lesser extent, the P/Q channels show Ca2+-dependent modulation. The other channels do not. The unique ability of the cardiac L-type IQ sequence to bind CaM that is not fully Ca2+ saturated may allow CaM to bind to this channel under resting Ca2+ conditions. Higher Ca2+ concentrations could then produce Ca2+-dependent inactivation. This is the first demonstration of a property of the IQ site on the L-type channels that sets it apart from the IQ sites on the other channels. We also found that a domain (CB) between the EF hand and the IQ domain of L-type channels was able to bind B12 CaM and wild type CaM in the presence of Ca2+. Mutations in Ca2+ binding sites 3 and 4 on CaM greatly reduced the affinity of CaM for this sequence. The Ca2+ dependence of the interaction of CB-L-B with CaM (EC50 = 100 nm) suggests that this interaction could also take place at resting Ca2+ levels in the cell, preparing the channel for inactivation when the Ca2+ reaches the appropriate levels. Half-maximal inhibition of Ca2+ channel activity by Ca2+occurs at about 4 μm Ca2+ (26Hofer G.F. Hohenthanner K. Baumgartner W. Groschner K. Klugbauer N. Hofmann F. Romanin C. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1857-1865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The CB-L-B peptide also enhanced ICa facilitation in cardiac myocytes in a Ca2+-dependent manner, suggesting that this sequence may have functional significance for regulating L-type Ca2+ channels. The P/Q, R, and N channels did not have comparable sequences that bound CaM. This is the second feature that distinguishes the cardiac L-type channels from the other voltage-dependent channels. The identified CaM binding sequence is within a domain previously suggested to play important roles in regulating Ca2+-dependent inactivation (7Zuhlke R.D. Reuter H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3287-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 13Soldatov N.M. Oz M. O'Brien K.A. Abernethy D.R. Morad M. J. Biol.

These findings suggest a role for calmodulin in regulating other aspects of L-type calcium channel function. In addition to the peptide data, other workers have found that amino acids within and bracketing this sequence are necessary for Ca2+-dependent inactivation of the channel. Our data support these findings. We have shown that calmodulin can block the interaction of an antibody to the CB-L-B sequence with both the SDS-denatured and the CHAPS-solubilized skeletal muscle L-type channel. Although these findings support a model in which the CB sequence is a CaM binding site, we cannot rule out the possibility that CaM binding to the nearby IQ sequence sterically hinders antibody binding to the CB sequence. Mutations of this region coupled to analysis of CaM binding will be necessary to resolve this issue. The carboxyl-terminal tail of the L-type channels has also been suggested to play a role in membrane targeting of this protein (18Gao T. Bunemann M. Gerhardstein B.L. Ma H. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25436-25444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The CB sequence that we demonstrate to bind CaM is within the region that has recently been suggested to play a role in membrane targeting of the L-type channels (18Gao T. Bunemann M. Gerhardstein B.L. Ma H. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25436-25444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). CaM binding may also contribute to this process. The IQ and CB regions of the cardiac L-type channel could either each bind a molecule of CaM or they could both contribute to the same CaM binding site. We have demonstrated that the interactions of the L-type IQ and CB peptides with CaM are competitive. Based on our findings, we propose a model in which the IQ and CB domains in the carboxyl-terminal tails of the L-type channels represent either two distinct binding sites for CaM or alternative sites for the interaction with partially and fully saturated CaM. One possibility is that only one CaM can bind to the carboxyl tail, and which site (IQ versus CB) is occupied is controlled by factors regulating the conformation of this region (for example, Ca2+ binding to the EF hand)."

However, the biochemical mechanism of the phosphorylation remains to be characterized. Here we show that expression of a constitutively active mutant of mouse 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1A280V) in Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing the insulin receptor was sufficient to induce PKB phosphorylation at Thr308 to approximately the same extent as insulin stimulation. Phosphorylation of PKB by PDK1A280Vwas not affected by treatment of cells with inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or by deletion of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of PKB. C2-ceramide, a cell-permeable, indirect inhibitor of PKB phosphorylation, did not inhibit PDK1A280V-catalyzed PKB phosphorylation in cells and had no effect on PDK1 activity in vitro. On the other hand, co-expression of full-length protein kinase C-related kinase-1 (PRK1/PKN) or 2 (PRK2) inhibited PDK1A280V-mediated PKB phosphorylation. Replacing alanine at position 280 with valine or deletion of the PH domain enhanced PDK1 autophosphorylation in vitro. However, deletion of the PH domain of PDK1A280V significantly reduced PDK1A280V-mediated phosphorylation of PKB in cells. In resting cells, PDK1A280V localized in the cytosol and at the plasma membrane. However, PDK1A280V lacking the PH domain localized predominantly in the cytosol. Taken together, our findings suggest that the wild-type PDK1 may not be constitutively active in cells. In addition, activation of PDK1 is sufficient to phosphorylate PKB at Thr308 in the cytosol. Furthermore, the PH domain of PDK1 may play both positive and negative roles in regulating the in vivo function of the enzyme. Finally, unlike the carboxyl-terminal fragment of PRK2, which has been shown to bind PDK1 and allow the enzyme to phosphorylate PKB at both Thr308 and Ser473, full-length PRK2 and its related kinase PRK1/PKN may both play negative roles in PKB-mediated downstream biological events.

Because PDK1 does not phosphorylate PKB at Ser473, it has been suggested that phosphorylation at this site is catalyzed by a distinct but yet to be characterized enzyme termed PDK2 (6Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been shown that PDK1, through an interaction with a PDK1-interacting fragment (PIF) derived from the carboxyl terminus of PRK2, can switch its substrate specificity to phosphorylate PKB at Ser473 in vitro (7Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it has recently been reported that phosphorylation of the wild-type but not the kinase-inactive PKB at Thr308 triggers phosphorylation at Ser473, suggesting that phosphorylation of PKB at Ser473 occurs through an autophosphorylation mechanism (8Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8271-8274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The current model of PKB activation suggests that the enzyme undergoes mitogen-stimulated translocation to the plasma membrane, which is mediated by the binding of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) products, namely PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, to the PH domain of PKB. This binding also leads to a conformational change that exposes Thr308 and Ser473 to the membrane-associated and constitutively activated upstream kinases PDK1 and PDK2, respectively. This model is supported by the finding that myristoylation/palmitoylation of PKB is sufficient to induce phosphorylation of the enzyme at Thr308 and Ser473 (9Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Frech M. Cron P. Cohen P. Lucocq J.M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31515-31524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). In addition, PDK1 purified from cells is constitutively active, and treatment of cells with mitogen does not stimulate PDK1 activity in vitro (4Alessi D.R. Deak M. Casamayor A. Caudwell F.B.

However, there are some data suggesting that the PH domain of PKB is not necessary for PKB phosphorylation and activation. First, it has been shown that PKB constructs lacking the PH domain can still be activated by insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (10Kohn A.D. Kovacina K. Roth R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4288-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 11Kohn A.D. Takeuchi F. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21920-21926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). In addition, the activity of a membrane-targeted PKB by myristoylation/palmitoylation is still sensitive to the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (9Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C.

These data suggest that activation of a PKB upstream kinase plays an important role in the phosphorylation and activation of PKB. In the current study, we examined the phosphorylation mechanism of PKB using a constitutively active mutant of mouse PDK1, PDK1A280V, in which the alanine at position 280 was replaced with valine. We have found that ectopic expression of PDK1A280V resulted in a marked increase in PKB phosphorylation at Thr308 to an extent similar to that induced by insulin stimulation. The PDK1A280V-mediated phosphorylation of PKB was not affected by treatment of cells with the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002, nor by ceramide, a compound known to indirectly inhibit PKB phosphorylation (12Zhou H. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Pittman R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16568-16575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Deletion of the PH domain of PKB had little effect on PDK1A280V-mediated phosphorylation of PKB. On the other hand, deletion of the PH domain of PDK1A280V inhibited the phosphorylation of PKB in cells. Taken together, our data suggest that wild-type PDK1 may not be constitutively active in cells. In addition, the PH domain of PDK1 may play both a positive and a negative role in regulating the function of the enzyme in cells. Finally, we have found that overexpression of the full-length PRK1/PKN or PRK2 inhibited PDK1A280V-mediated PKB phosphorylation, suggesting that these enzymes play negative roles in PKB-mediated downstream signaling. A Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line overexpressing the human insulin receptor (CHO/IR) and the cDNA encoding human PKBα were gifts from Dr. Richard A.

Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar) using customized primers. All site-directed mutagenesis products were confirmed by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. The kinase inactive mutant PDK1K114G was described previously (13Dong L.Q. Zhang L.-B. Langlais P. He H. Clark M. Zhu L. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8117-8122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding mouse PDK1 or PDK1A280V with a truncation in the PH domain (PDK1(ΔPH) and PDK1A280V(ΔPH); residues 1–459) were generated by PCR, using either PDK1 or PDK1A280V cDNA as a template. The PCR primers used were: 5′-GCGAATTCGACTTGGGGCTCATGGCC-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGACTGGTGCCAAGGGTTTCC-3′, with the added restriction sites underlined. After restriction digestion with EcoRI and XbaI, the cDNA fragments were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1-Myc-His-A (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), in-frame with a sequence encoding a Myc-tag at the 3′-end. cDNAs encoding the PH domain-truncated mutant of PKB were amplified by PCR using human PKBα cDNA as a template. The forward PCR primers for full-length and the PH domain-deleted PKB were: 5′-CCGGAATTCTATTGTGAAGGAGGGTTGG-3′ and 5′-CCGGAATTCCATCCAGACTGTGGCTGAC-3′, respectively. The reverse primer for both constructs was 5′-CTAGTCTAGAGTAGGAGAACTGGGGGAAG-3′, with the added restriction sites underlined. The cDNA fragments were subcloned into the EcoRI/XbaI sites of pFLAG-CMV2 vector (Sigma), in-frame with the sequence encoding a FLAG-tag at the 5′-end. CHO/IR cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Co-transfections of CHO/IR cells were normally performed in 60-mm plates with 2 μg of each recombinant plasmid, using LipofectAMINE reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were serum-starved for 2–4 h, treated with or without 10 nm insulin, and lysed in 120–400 μl of Buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm microcystin-LR, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The homogenate was centrifuged (10,000 × g, 4 °C, 10 min), and the supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation or Western blot experiments. For immunoprecipitation studies, cell lysates were incubated with specific antibodies bound to protein G beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 4–6 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. After incubation, immunoprecipitates were washed extensively with ice-cold Buffer B (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100). Proteins bound to the beads were eluted by heating at 95 °C for 4 min in SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer. The eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and detected with specific antibodies. The expression of various proteins was detected by Western blot of cell lysates with antibodies specific to the Myc or FLAG-tag or to the protein. Quantitation of the relative increase in PKB phosphorylation (expressed as percentage of maximum phosphorylation) was performed by analyzing Western blots using the National Institutes of Health IMAGE 1.58 program and was normalized for the amount of PKB expression in each experiment. All experiments were repeated independently at least three times to ensure the consistency of the results. CHO/IR cells overexpressing Myc-tagged wild-type PDK1, PDK1A280V, or PH domain-deleted mutants of PDK1 or PDK1A280V were serum-starved for 4 h, treated with or without 10 nm insulin for 5 min, and lysed in Buffer A. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the proteins in the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with antibody to the Myc-tag. After washing the immunocomplexes twice with Buffer B and once with Buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm NaF, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), autophosphorylation of PDK1 was initiated with the addition of 30 μl of Buffer C plus 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. Bound proteins were eluted by heating at 95 °C for 4 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted to a nitrocellulose membrane. Phosphorylation of PDK1 was visualized by autoradiography and quantitated using the NIH IMAGE 1.58 program. CHO/IR cells were seeded in 24-well plates containing coverslips and transfected with plasmids encoding Myc-tagged PDK1, PDK1A280V, or the PH domain-deleted mutant forms of PDK1 or PDK1A280V using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies). 24 h after transfection, cells were serum-starved for 1 h, treated with or without 10 nm insulin for 10 min, and then fixed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were permeabilized and blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Triton X-100 and 10% normal goat serum. The expression of Myc-tagged full-length or the PH domain-deleted mutants of PDK1 or PDK1A280V was detected by incubation with the anti-Myc-antibody, followed by a rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (KPL). Images were captured by an Olympus Fluoview confocal fluorescence microscope. To characterize the biochemical mechanism by which PKB is phosphorylated and activated by PDK1, we generated a mutant mouse PDK1 in which the alanine at position 280 was replaced with valine (PDK1A280V). Mutation at the equivalent position in the Caenorhabditis eleganshomologue of mammalian PDK1 has been shown to increase PDK1 kinase activity and bypass the requirement for AGE1/PI3K in transducing upstream signals to PKB (16Paradis S. Ailion M. Toker A. Thomas J.H. Ruvkun G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1438-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). To test whether PDK1A280Vconstitutively phosphorylated PKB in cells, we co-transfected CHO/IR cells with PKB and either wild-type, A280V, or the kinase-defective mutant (PDK1K114G (13Dong L.Q. Zhang L.-B. Langlais P. He H. Clark M. Zhu L. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8117-8122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar)) of PDK1. Western blot analysis using phospho-specific antibodies directed against either Thr308 or Ser473 of PKB showed little PKB phosphorylation under basal conditions or in cells co-expressing wild-type PDK1 or the kinase-defective mutant PDK1K114G(Fig. 1 A, top andsecond panels, lanes 1, 2, and4). On the other hand, co-expression of PDK1A280V with PKB resulted in a marked increase in PKB phosphorylation at Thr308 to a level approximately equal to that attained by insulin treatment (Fig. 1 A, top panel, lane 3 versus lane 5). Concomitantly, a modest increase of phosphorylation at Ser473 was also observed (Fig. 1 A, second panel, lane 3 versus 1). Overexpression of PDK1A280V did not stimulate the phosphorylation of MAP kinase (data not shown). A recent study has shown that PDK1 can phosphorylate Ser473 of PKB upon binding the PDK1-interactive fragment (PIF) derived from PRK2 (7Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). To test whether PDK1A280V was able to phosphorylate PKB at Ser473, we co-expressed Myc-tagged PKB and Myc-tagged PDK1A280V in CHO/IR cells together with either FLAG-tagged PRK2 or PRK1 (also named PKN), a PRK2-related protein that has recently been found to interact with PDK1 in intact cells (17Dong L.Q. Landa L.R. Wick M.J. Zhu L. Mukai H. Ono Y. Liu F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5089-5094Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Our results showed that overexpression of PRK1/PKN significantly inhibited PDK1A280V-stimulated PKB phosphorylation at Thr308 (Fig. 1 B, top panel,lane 4 versus lane 3) and Ser473 (Fig. 1 B, second panel,lane 4 versus lane 3). A lesser inhibition of PKB phosphorylation was observed in cells expressing PRK2 (Fig. 1 B, top and second panels, lane 5 versus lane 3), probably due to lesser expression of this protein compared with PKN (Fig. 1 B,bottom panel, lane 5 versus lane 4). These findings suggest that full-length PKN and PRK2 play negative roles in PKB-mediated downstream events. It is possible that the interaction of full-length PRK1/PKN or PRK2 with PDK1 induced a conformational change that was different from that induced by the PIF fragment. To test this possibility, we co-expressed Myc-tagged PKB in CHO/IR cells together with either a control plasmid (Fig. 1 C, lanes 1 and 2), Myc-tagged PDK1A280V (Fig. 1 C, lane 3), Myc-tagged PDK1A280V plus the FLAG-tagged carboxyl terminus of PRK1/PKN (AF3-PKN) (14Takahashi M. Mukai H. Toshimori M. Miyamoto M. Ono Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11566-11571Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 C, lane 4), or Myc-tagged PDK1A280V plus the GST-PIF fusion protein (Fig. 1 C, lane 5). Overexpression of either AF3-PKN or GST-PIF had no significant effect on the expression levels of PKB (Fig. 1 C, third panel) or PDK1 (Fig. 1 C, fourth panel). However, overexpression of these proteins significantly inhibited PDK1A280V-induced PKB phosphorylation at Thr308 (Fig. 1 C,top panel, lane 3 versus lane 4 or 5). Although co-expression of PDK1A280V and AF3-PKN did not significantly stimulate PKB phosphorylation at Ser473 (Fig. 1 C, second panel, lane 3 versus lane 4), co-expression of PDK1A280V and the GST-PIF fusion protein led to a 3-fold increase in the phosphorylation at this site (Fig. 1 C, second panel, lane 3 versus lane 5). These results are in agreement with the recent finding that binding of PIF fragment enables PDK1 to phosphorylate PKB at Ser473 (7Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). To test whether PI3K is required for PDK1A280V-mediated phosphorylation of PKB, we co-transfected PKB into CHO/IR cells together with either a pcDNA control plasmid or a plasmid encoding PDK1A280V and examined PKB phosphorylation in the presence or absence of PI3K inhibitors. In the absence of PDK1A280V, insulin treatment led to a significant increase in PKB phosphorylation at Thr308 (Fig. 2 A, top panel,lane 1 versus lane 2). This insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of PKB at Thr308 was blocked by either wortmannin (Fig. 2 A, top panel,lane 3) or LY294002 (Fig. 2 A, top panel, lane 4). In agreement with our earlier findings (Fig. 1 A, top panel), co-expression of PDK1A280V with PKB resulted in a marked increase in PKB phosphorylation at Thr308 (Fig. 2 A, top panel, lane 5), which was only slightly enhanced after insulin treatment (Fig. 2 A, top panel, lane 6). However, neither wortmannin nor LY294002 inhibited the PDK1A280V-stimulated PKB phosphorylation at Thr308 (Fig. 2 A, top panel,lane 5 versus lanes 7 or8). To further understand the mechanism of PKB phosphorylation, we investigated the phosphorylation of PKB by PDK1 in the presence or absence of C2-ceramide, a cell-permeable reagent that indirectly inhibits PKB phosphorylation and activity (12Zhou H. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Pittman R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16568-16575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Consistent with the results of others (18Wang C.N. O'Brien L. Brindley D.N. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 19Summers S.A. Garza L.A. Xhou H. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5457-5464Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), we found that treatment of CHO/IR cells with ceramide inhibited PKB phosphorylation at both Thr308 (Fig. 2 B,top panel, lane 1 versus lanes 2 and 3) and Ser473 (Fig. 2 B,second panel, lane 1 versus lanes 2 and 3) but had no significant effect on the autophosphorylation of the IR and the tyrosine phosphorylation of IR substrate-1 (IRS-1) (data not shown). The inhibition of PKB phosphorylation by ceramide was partially prevented by overexpression of wild-type PDK1 and almost completely blocked by overexpression of PDK1A280V (Fig. 2 B, top panel, lanes 4–9). In addition, we have found that ceramide did not inhibit PDK1 activity in vitro (data not shown). It has recently been shown that phosphorylation by PDK1 in vitro triggers the phosphorylation at Ser473 in kinase-active, but not thermally inactivated PKB (8Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8271-8274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). To test whether phosphorylation of PKB at Thr308 is sufficient to initiate the phosphorylation of PKB at Ser473 in intact cells, we co-expressed Myc-tagged wild-type PKB, PKBT308A, or a kinase-inactive PKBK179A in CHO/IR cells together with either a control plasmid or Myc-tagged PDK1A280V. Cells were treated with or without insulin, and the phosphorylation of PKB at Thr308and Ser473 was examined. Stimulation of cells with insulin (Fig. 3, top panel, lane 1 versus lane 2) or overexpression of PDK1A280V (Fig. 3, top panel, lane 1 versus lane 3). led to a marked increase in the phosphorylation at Thr308 of wild-type PKB. As expected, the PKBT308A mutant was not phosphorylated in the activation loop under these conditions (Fig. 3, top panel,lanes 4–6). Inactivation of the kinase by replacing the ATP-binding site lysine residue (Lys179) with alanine resulted in a 70% decrease in the insulin- or PDK1A280V-stimulated phosphorylation at Thr308(Fig. 3, top panel, lanes 2 and3 versus 8 and 9). However, replacing Ser473 with alanine had essentially no effect on PKB phosphorylation at Thr308 (data not shown). Consistent with the findings of others (8Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8271-8274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), a mutation at Thr308inhibited the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation at Ser473(Fig. 3, second panel, lane 5). Inactivation of PKB also resulted in a marked decrease in the insulin-stimulated PKB phosphorylation at Ser473 (Fig. 3, second panel,lane 2 versus lane 8). However, quantitation analysis revealed that approximately 46% of Ser473 phosphorylation remained for this kinase-inactive mutant. Together, these finding suggest that phosphorylation at Thr308 and the kinase activity of PKB play an important role in the phosphorylation of the enzyme at Ser473. However, because PKBK179A was still able to undergo insulin-stimulated phosphorylation at Ser473 in cells, a mechanism other than or in addition to autophosphorylation may play a role in the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of PKB at this site. To test whether the PH domain of PKB is required for PDK1A280V-catalyzed phosphorylation of PKB, we co-transfected CHO/IR cells with PDK1A280V and either the wild-type or a PKB mutant in which the PH domain (residues 1–102) was deleted. Western blot studies showed that insulin treatment led to an increase in PKB phosphorylation at Thr308 (Fig. 4 A, top panel,lane 1 versus lane 2). This insulin-stimulated phosphorylation was abolished for the PH domain-deleted mutant PKB(ΔPH) (Fig. 4 A, top panel, lane 5). On the other hand, only a partial inhibition of the PDK1A280V-mediated phosphorylation was observed for PKB(ΔPH) compared with that of the full-length enzyme (Fig. 4 A, top panel, lane 3 versus lane 6). Because the PH domain of PKB has been shown to be necessary for the translocation of the enzyme to the plasma membrane (1Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar), our findings suggest that PDK1A280V is able to phosphorylate PKB(ΔPH) in the cytosol. This is also consistent with our earlier finding that treatment of cells with PI3K inhibitors did not block PDK1A280V-mediated phosphorylation of PKB (Fig. 2 A). The PH domain of PDK1 has been shown to bind phosphoinositides and be necessary for PDK1-mediated phosphorylation and activation of PKB (20Anderson K.E. Coadwell J. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 684-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 21Currie R.A. Walker K.S. Gray A. Deak M. Casamayor A. Downes C.P. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Lucocq J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). To test whether the PH domain is required for PDK1A280V-mediated phosphorylation of PKB at Thr308, we generated mutants of PDK1 and PDK1A280V in which the PH domains were deleted. Co-expression of PKB with wild-type PDK1 or PDK1(ΔPH) had no significant effect on basal PKB phosphorylation at Thr308(Fig. 4 B, top panel, lanes 1 and 2). Conversely, co-expression of PDK1A280V with PKB markedly increased the phosphorylation of PKB at this site (Fig. 4 B, top panel,lane 3). The PDK1A280V-stimulated phosphorylation of PKB at Thr308 was markedly decreased by deletion of the PH domain of PDK1A280V (Fig. 4 B,top panel, lane 3 versus lane 4). In addition, overexpression of the PDK1(ΔPH) or PDK1A280V(ΔPH) inhibited insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of PKB at Thr308 (Fig. 4 B,top panel, lane 5 versus 6and lane 7 versus 8). These findings indicate that the PH domain of PDK1 is important for the enzyme to interact with and phosphorylate PKB in cells. One explanation for the inhibition of PKB phosphorylation by PDK1(ΔPH) or PDK1A280V(ΔPH) might be that removal of the PH domain rendered the enzyme inactive. To test this possibility, we examined the autophosphorylation of wild-type and PH domain-deleted mutants of PDK1 and PDK1A280V. Wild-type PDK1 and PDK1A280V isolated from both serum-starved and insulin-treated cells were autophosphorylated in vitro (Fig. 4 C). Deletion of the PH domain or replacing alanine at 280 with valine led to approximately a 2- and 3-fold increase in the autophosphorylation of PDK1, respectively. However, deletion of the PH domain did not further stimulate the autokinase activity of PDK1A280V (Fig. 4 C). Therefore, deletion of the PH domain increased, rather than inhibited, PDK1 catalytic activityper se. The finding that deletion of the PH domain did not affect PDK1A280V autophosphorylationin vitro but prevented the enzyme from phosphorylating PKB in cells suggested that the PH domain plays a role in the interaction of PDK1A280V with its substrates. To test this idea, we examined the cellular localization of PDK1, PDK1A280V, and their PH-domain-deleted mutants by confocal immunofluorescence studies. In unstimulated CHO/IR cells, PDK1A280V localized both at the plasma membrane and in the cytosol in a punctate manner (Fig. 5, a and b). Plasma membrane association of PDK1A280V was also observed in cells treated with insulin (Fig. 5, c and d). On the other hand, no significant plasma membrane immunofluorescence staining was observed for PDK1A280V(ΔPH) before or after insulin treatment (Fig. 5, e–h). Under serum-starved conditions, wild-type PDK1 (Fig. 5, i and j) and PDK1(ΔPH) (Fig. 5, m and n) resided predominantly in the perinuclear region. Although insulin treatment led to a decrease in the perinuclear staining of the wild-type PDK1 (Fig. 5, k and l), it had no significant effect on the intracellular translocation of PDK1(ΔPH) (Fig. 5, o andp). These findings are consistent with an earlier report that the PH domain is important for PDK1 translocation to the plasma membrane (20Anderson K.E. Coadwell J. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 684-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of PKB at Thr308 in the activation loop by PDK1 is considered essential for PKB activation. However, the biochemical and cellular mechanisms by which PKB is phosphorylated by upstream kinases remain unclear. In the present studies, we have examined the biochemical mechanism of PKB phosphorylation by using a constitutively active mutant of PDK1. Expression of the gain-of-function mutant PDK1 homologue has recently been shown to bypass the requirement for AGE-1/PI3K-mediated PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 production to induce dauer arrest in C. elegans (16Paradis S. Ailion M. Toker A. Thomas J.H. Ruvkun G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1438-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). In agreement with this finding, we have found that expression of PDK1A280V was sufficient to induce significant phosphorylation of PKB at Thr308 in intact cells (Fig. 1 A). Pretreatment of cells with either LY294002 or wortmannin, or deletion of the PH domain of PKB, had essentially no effect on PDK1A280V-mediated phosphorylation of PKB at Thr308 (Figs. 2 A and 4 A). These findings suggest that activation of PDK1 is sufficient to phosphorylate PKB at Thr308 in the cytosol. This is consistent with an earlier finding that a PKB mutant lacking its PH domain could be activated by either insulin or PDGF in several cell types (11Kohn A.D. Takeuchi F. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21920-21926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been found that insulin stimulates an increase of PKBβ phosphorylation in the cytosol (22Hill M.M. Clark S.F. Tucker D.F. Birnbaum M.J. James D.E. Macaulay S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7771-7781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistently, PDK1 has been found both at the plasma membrane and in the cytosol (20Anderson K.E. Coadwell J. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 684-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 21Currie R.A. Walker K.S. Gray A. Deak M. Casamayor A. Downes C.P. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Lucocq J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). While this manuscript was under revision, Filippa et al.(23Filippa N. Sable C.L. Hemmings B.A. Van Obberghen E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5712-5722Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) reported that overexpression of ΔPH-PDK1 activated ΔPH-PKB in 293 cells. Based on this finding, they suggest that the PH domain of PDK1 acts as a negative regulator of its enzyme activity. In agreement with their results, we have found that deletion of the PH domain stimulated PDK1 autokinase activity in vitro (Fig. 4 C). However, our results also show that the PH domain of PDK1 is necessary for PDK1-mediated PKB phosphorylation in cells, because overexpression of the PH-domain-deleted mutants of PDK1 or PDK1A280V inhibited phosphorylation of full-length PKB (Fig. 4 B). These findings suggest the PH domain plays a dual role in regulating PDK1 activity in cells. On one hand, the PH domain may be necessary for targeting the enzyme to a specific cellular location to interact with and phosphorylate its substrates. On the other hand, this domain may function as an autoinhibitory region to block the catalytic activity of PDK1 under basal conditions. This inhibitory mechanism may be important for preventing nonspecific phosphorylation and activation of PDK1 downstream substrates under non-stimulatory conditions. After growth factor stimulation, the binding of phospholipids to the PH domain may induce a conformational change that relieves the inhibitory blockage so that PDK1 becomes fully active. In addition to activating PDK1, the binding of phospholipids may also promote the plasma membrane translocation of the enzyme. Thus, the PH domain may function as a switch to regulate PDK1-mediated biological events in cells. Until recently, it has been suggested that PDK1 is constitutively active in cells and that phosphorylation and activation of its downstream substrates is mediated mainly by translocation and conformational changes of its substrates (24Belham C. Wu S. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R93-R96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 25Peterson R.T. Schreiber S.L. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R521-R524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, our data suggest that PDK1 can be activated above its basal level both in vitro and in cells. Consistent with this, a mutation at Ala280 or deletion of the PH domain significantly increased PDK1 autophosphorylation in vitro (Fig. 4 C). In addition, overexpression of PDK1A280V, but not wild-type PDK1, was able to phosphorylate PKB at Thr308 to the same extent as that stimulated by insulin (Fig. 1 A). Thus, although PDK1 is constitutively active in vitro, its activation may be tightly regulated in cells. This idea is consistent with a recent finding that PDK1 is activated by sphingosine bothin vitro and in vivo (26King C.C. Zende F.T. Dawson P.E. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Hemmings B.A. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18108-18113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has also recently been shown that treatment of cells with the phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid and calyculin A inhibited PKB phosphorylation at Thr308 (27Schubert K.M. Scheid M.P. Duronio V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13330-13335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), suggesting that phosphorylation plays a role in regulating PDK1 activity in cells. Consistent with the findings of others (28Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), we have found that phosphorylation of Ser244 in the activation loop of mouse PDK1 is essential for the autophosphorylation and kinase activity of the enzyme. 2M. J. Wilk, H. He, and F. Liu, unpublished results. Ceramide has been shown to be a potent inhibitor for PKB phosphorylation in cells (18Wang C.N. O'Brien L. Brindley D.N. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 19Summers S.A. Garza L.A. Xhou H. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5457-5464Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Because C2-ceramide does not inhibit insulin-stimulated PI3K activation in cells and has no effect on PKB catalytic activity in vitro, it has been hypothesized that its action may be due to the inhibition of an immediate upstream kinase for PKB (12Zhou H.

However, our data showed that ceramide-induced inhibition could be blocked by PDK1A280V(Fig. 2 B). In addition, ceramide did not inhibit PDK1 activity in vitro (data not shown). These findings suggest that the inhibition of PKB by ceramide is not mediated by direct inhibition of PDK1. These results are consistent with the findings that the inhibition of PKB phosphorylation by ceramide in cells is due to the activation of a protein phosphatase (27Schubert K.M. Scheid M.P. Duronio V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13330-13335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 29Salinas M. Lopez-Valdaliso R. Martin D. Alvarez A. Cuadrado A. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2000; 15: 156-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) rather than by the inhibition of the PKB upstream kinase PDK1. It has recently been suggested that phosphorylation of PKB at the PDK2 site is mediated by autophosphorylation (8Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8271-8274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). This conclusion is supported by the findings that incubation of purified PKB with PDK1 led to phosphorylation at both Thr308 and Ser473, and phosphorylation at Ser473 requires prior phosphorylation at Thr308 and the intrinsic catalytic activity of the enzyme (8Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8271-8274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). However, whether phosphorylation of PKB at Thr308 is sufficient to trigger autophosphorylation at Ser473 in intact cells is unknown. In our studies, we found that expression of a constitutively active PDK1 induced marked phosphorylation of PKB at Thr308 and to a lesser extent Ser473 (Fig. 1). Because PDK1 does not directly phosphorylate PKB at Ser473, these findings suggest that phosphorylation of Thr308 by PDK1 is able to induce PKB autophosphorylation at Ser473. This idea is consistent with a recent finding that phosphorylation of Ser473 may occur through an autophosphorylation mechanism (8Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8271-8274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). However, it should be pointed out that, in our studies, the PDK1A280V-induced PKB phosphorylation at Ser473 is normally less than 20% of that stimulated by insulin. In addition, it has previously been shown that a kinase-inactive, membrane-targeted mutant PKB can be phosphorylated at both Thr308 and Ser473 in unstimulated cells (9Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Frech M. Cron P. Cohen P. Lucocq J.M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31515-31524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, we have found that a disruption of the kinase activity of the enzyme inhibited PKB phosphorylation at both Thr308 and Ser473(Fig. 3). In addition, inactivation of PKB did not completely inhibit insulin-stimulated PKB phosphorylation at Ser473 (Fig. 3). Therefore, it remains to be established whether the growth factor-stimulated stoichiometric phosphorylation of PKB at this site is mediated by autophosphorylation, by a distinct kinase, or by both. It has recently been shown that, upon binding to the PIF fragment derived from PRK2, PDK1 is capable of phosphorylating PKB at Ser473 (7Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). In agreement with this finding, we found that co-expression of PDK1A280V with the PIF fragment led to an increase of PKB phosphorylation at Ser473 (Fig. 1 C, second panel, lane 3 versus 5). However, we also found that co-expression of full-length PRK2, its isoform PRK1/PKN, or the carboxyl terminus of PRK1/PKN (PKN-AF3) inhibited PDK1A280V-mediated PKB phosphorylation at both Thr308 and Ser473 (Fig. 1, B andC). These findings suggest the full-length PRK1/PKN and PRK2 play negative roles in PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of PKB in cells. We thank Dr. Richard A.

In this study, we report the structural requirements for the adherence and the minimum chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4S) structural motif that supports IRBC adherence. Partially sulfated C4Ss with varying sulfate contents were prepared by solvolytic desulfation of a fully sulfated C4S. These and other nonmodified C4Ss, with different proportions of 4-, 6-, and nonsulfated disaccharide repeats, were analyzed for inhibition of IRBC adherence to the placental CSPG. C4Ss containing 30–50% 4-sulfated and 50–70% nonsulfated disaccharide repeats efficiently inhibited IRBC adherence; C6S had no inhibitory activity. Oligosaccharides of varying sizes were prepared by the partial depolymerization of C4Ss containing varying levels of 4-sulfation, and their ability to inhibit the IRBC adherence was studied. Oligosaccharides with six or more disaccharide repeats inhibited IRBC adherence to the same level as that of the intact C4Ss, indicating that a dodecasaccharide is the minimum structural motif required for optimal IRBC adherence. Of the C4S dodecasaccharides, only those with two or three sulfate groups per molecule showed maximum IRBC inhibition. These data define the structural requirements for the IRBC adherence to placental CSPGs with implications for the development of therapeutics for maternal malaria.

Thus, in pregnant women, P. falciparum exploits the chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4S)1 chains in an opportunistic manner to colonize in the placenta (12Fried M. Duffy P.E.

A number of studies have shown that endothelial cell surface adhesion molecules and C4S can function as receptors for the sequestration of IRBCs to various organs of the host (13Rogerson S.J. Brown G.V. Parasitol. Today. 1997; 134: 70-75Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 18Baruch D.I. Gormely J.A. Ma C. Howard R.J. Pasloske B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although one or more of the endothelial cell receptors are involved in this process, C4S specifically mediates the accumulation of IRBCs in the intervillous spaces of human placenta (12Fried M. Duffy P.E. Science. 1996; 272: 1502-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar, 13Rogerson S.J. Brown G.V. Parasitol.

Although in vitrocultured endothelial cells can express CSPGs on their surfaces, and thus bind C4S-adherent IRBCs as reported (19Robert C. Pouvelle B. Meyer P. Muanza K. Fujioka H. Aikawa M.

Parasitol. 1997; 88: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), in vivo, endothelial cells express mainly HSPGs and they either lack or contain low levels of CSPGs. Thus, C4S-adherent IRBCs are present in very low levels in individuals other than pregnant women (22Rogerson S.J. Chaiyaroj S.C. Ng K. Reeder J.C. Brown G.V. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 23Chaiyaroj S.C. Angkasekwinai P. Buranakiti A. Looareesuwan S. Rogerson S.J. Brown G.V. Am. J. Trop. Med.

Chem. 2000; 275: 40344-40356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), the placental intervillous spaces contain relatively high levels of CSPGs, which can efficiently bind IRBCs. Apparently, the placenta provides an opportunity by presenting CSPGs for P. falciparum IRBCs to selectively accumulate in the intervillous spaces, and thus this phenotype multiplies to high density, causing maternal malaria. It is well known that pathogenic microorganisms use carbohydrate-protein mediated adhesion mechanisms for cell invasion and tissue colonization in the host. A number of bacteria, parasites, and viruses have been reported to use HS moieties of cell surface HSPGs as receptors for attachment and/or invasion of host cells (25Rostand K.S. Esko J.D. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Wadström T. Ljungh Ä. J. Med. Microbiol. 1999; 48: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In most cases, the GAG chain structural requirements for adherence have not been studied, and inhibition by highly charged heparin and lack of inhibition by CS or DS have been attributed to HS chain-specific binding (25Rostand K.S. Esko J.D. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although a question remains as to whether those observations merely represent nonspecific charge interactions by heparin, it is increasingly becoming clear that microbes use GAG chains of host cells for adherence (25Rostand K.S. Esko J.D. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Wadström T. Ljungh Ä. J. Med. Microbiol. 1999; 48: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 27Herold B.C.

Recently, it has been shown that a heparin dodecasaccharide is involved in Chlamydia trachomatis attachment and infectivity to the host cells (29Chen J.C.-R. Zhang J.P. Stephens R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11134-11140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Compared with the large number of microbes that appear to use HS as adhesion receptors, the evidence for pathogens exploiting CS or DS chain-specific binding is scarce (25Rostand K.S. Esko J.D.

PGs are macromolecules formed by the attachment of GAG chains to proteins, and they are ubiquitously present in eukaryotic cells and tissues, mainly as extracellular or cell surface molecules. PGs play a key role in several biological functions, including the normal physiology of cartilage tissues, and in the regulation of biological processes such as cell migration and proliferation, cell-cell recognition and adhesion, extracellular matrix organization, cell-matrix and substratum adhesion, and morphogenesis (31Bhavanandan V.P.

PGs are also involved in mobilizing growth factors, enzymes, cytokines, and protease inhibitors at the sites where they are secreted, to create reservoirs for efficient biological interactions and to protect proteins from proteolytic degradation (33Poole A.R.

Science. 1993; 261: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Many of the biological functions of PGs are mediated by the interactions of specific structural motifs of GAG chains (31–45), e.g. the binding of distinct heparin domains by type IV collagen (45Koliakos G.G.

The characterization of the fine structural requirements of GAG for ligand binding in microbial interactions with the host has implications for understanding these basic biological processes as well as for pharmacological applications. GAG chains contribute predominantly to the characteristic properties and functions of PGs. Structurally, GAGs share a common feature in that all have a linear, O-sulfated polysaccharide backbone consisting of alternating residues of uronic acid (GlcA in CS, IdoUA in DS, and IdoUA and GlcA in HS and heparin) and hexosamine (GalNAc in CS and DS, and GlcNAc or GlcNSO32− in HS and heparin) (31Bhavanandan V.P. Davidson E.A. Allen H.J. Kissilus E.C. Glycoconjugates. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1992: 167-202Google Scholar, 32Kjellen L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). Thus, C4S and C6S are made up of -GlcAβ1–3GalNAcβ1–4 disaccharide repeats with sulfate groups at O-4 or O-6 of GalNAc, respectively (31Bhavanandan V.P. Davidson E.A. Allen H.J. Kissilus E.C. Glycoconjugates. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1992: 167-202Google Scholar). GAGs in general are extremely heterogeneous with respect to their size, as well as levels, positions, and distribution of sulfate groups. C4Ss from different sources vary in distribution of nonsulfated and 4-sulfated disaccharide repeats, and some may also contain significant amount of 6-, 2,6-, and 4,6-disulfated units (31Bhavanandan V.P. Davidson E.A. Allen H.J. Kissilus E.C. Glycoconjugates. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1992: 167-202Google Scholar). Therefore, detailed studies using defined CS structures could furnish a complete understanding of the molecular interactions involved between C4S and the P. falciparum protein-mediated placental IRBC adherence. Although the results of several studies suggest that C4S mediates IRBC adherence to the placenta (12Fried M. Duffy P.E. Science. 1996; 272: 1502-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar, 13Rogerson S.J. Brown G.V. Parasitol. Today. 1997; 134: 70-75Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 14Fried M.

Med. 1998; 76: 162-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), the precise nature of the CS chains and the structural requirements for the adherence of IRBCs to the placental CSPGs remain unclear. Previous studies have reported contradictory information regarding the minimum CS chain length requirement for IRBC binding (48Beeson J.G. Chai W. Rogerson S.J. Lawson A.M. Brown G.V. Infect.

This could be due to the use of nonrelevant receptors in those studies. In the preceding paper (24Achur R.N. Valiyaveettil M. Alkhalil A. Ockenhouse C.F. Gowda D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40344-40356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), we showed that the placental intervillous spaces contain high levels of CSPGs, and that these are the receptors for placental IRBC adherence. In this study, we established the IRBC binding specificity to the C4S chains of the placental CSPGs, determined the minimum CS chain motif involved, and defined structural requirements for IRBC adherence. C4S (sturgeon notochord), super special grade C6S (shark cartilage), C2,6diS (shark cartilage), C4,6diS (squid cartilage), HS (bovine kidney), chondroitin, Proteus vulgaris chondroitinase ABC, Flavobacterium heparinumheparitinase (113 units/mg), and Streptomyces hyalurolyticushyaluronidase (2000 turbidity reducing units/mg) were purchased from Seikagaku America (Falmouth, MA). Ovine testicular hyaluronidase (2160 units/mg) was from ICN Biomedicals. C4Ss (bovine trachea and whale cartilage), DS (porcine intestinal mucosa), HA (human umbilical cord), gelatin (300 bloom), and BSA were from Sigma. SYBR green fluorescent dye was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR).N,O-Bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide was from Aldrich. RPMI 1640 medium, glutamine, HEPES, p-aminobenzoic acid, heparin, and Giemsa stain reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. Human blood and serum were purchased from Interstate Blood Bank (Memphis, TN). Polystyrene Petri dishes (Falcon 1058) were from Becton-Dickinson Labware. Dowex 50W-X8, Bio-Gel P-2, and Bio-Gel P-6 were from Bio-Rad. The parasites were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, 29 mm sodium bicarbonate, 0.005% hypoxanthine,p-aminobenzoic acid (2 mg/liter), gentamycin sulfate (50 mg/liter), 10% O+ human serum using type O Rh+human red blood cells at 3% hematocrit. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 90% nitrogen, 5% oxygen, and 5% carbon dioxide. Parasites were synchronized as described previously at the early ring stage with 5% sorbitol for 5 min (51Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2761) Google Scholar). The C4S-adherent parasites (3D7 clone) were originally selected from the NF-54 laboratory strains by the panning procedure (52Ockenhouse C.F. Ho M. Tandon N.N. Van Seventor G.A. Shaw S. White N.J. Jamieson G.A. Chulay J.D. Webster H.K. J. Infect. Dis. 1991; 164: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Tissue culture plastic Petri dishes were coated overnight with a sterile 10 μg/ml solution of bovine trachea C4S in PBS, pH 7.2, at room temperature in a tissue culture hood, and then blocked with a 2% sterile solution of BSA in PBS for 1 h. Synchronized cultures of the parasites with 10–20% parasitemia at the late trophozoite or mid-schizont stage were harvested, washed two times with RPMI 1640 medium without serum, suspended at 2% hematocrit, layered on C4S-coated Petri dishes, and incubated at room temperature. After 1 h, unbound RBCs were aspirated, plates were washed gently three times with RPMI 1640 medium, and the bound cells were detached by vigorous pipetting several times with the culture medium. These parasites were cultured, the panning procedure repeated two more times, and the final isolate designated as the 3D7 clone. The selected IRBCs adhered at high density to CSPGs of placental intervillous spaces. The adherent property of IRBCs significantly decreases over a period of continuous culture; therefore, the parasites were panned every 6–8 weeks on placental CSPG-coated plates. The IRBCs were enriched by gelatin floatation as described by Jensen (53Jensen J.B. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1978; 27: 1274-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Briefly, the parasite cultures with 10–20% parasitemia were harvested at the late trophozoite stage. The cells were suspended in 0.65% gelatin in PBS, pH 7.2, and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Most uninfected erythrocytes and infected erythrocytes containing rings and early trophozoites settled to the bottom, and the IRBCs with mid-stage and late trophozoites remained in the supernatant. The supernatant was removed, centrifuged, and the enriched IRBCs (50–70% parasitemia) were washed twice with sterile PBS, pH 7.2. A 2% suspension of enriched IRBCs was used for the cytoadherence assays. In some experiments, parasite cultures with 20–25% parasitemia were used without further enrichment. The solutions (10–15 μl) of purified CSPGs in PBS, pH 7.2, were spotted on 150 × 15-mm plastic Petri dishes and allowed to coat overnight at 4 °C (52Ockenhouse C.F. Ho M. Tandon N.N. Van Seventor G.A. Shaw S. White N.J. Jamieson G.A. Chulay J.D. Webster H.K. J. Infect. Dis. 1991; 164: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The spots were then blocked with 20 μl of 2% BSA for 2 h at room temperature. The spots coated only with PBS (controls) were similarly blocked with BSA. After aspirating BSA, 15 μl of a 2% suspension of enriched parasite culture (50–70% parasitemia) in PBS, pH 7.2, was overlaid on each spot and incubated at room temperature. Uninfected RBCs layered on CSPG-coated plates were used as separate negative controls. After 40 min, the dishes were washed three times with PBS, pH 7.2. The bound cells were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde and stained with either 1% Giemsa or SYBR green fluorescent dye at 1:10,000 dilution of the stock solution as recommended by the supplier. The bound IRBCs were counted under light or fluorescent microscopy and photographed. All assays were carried out either in duplicate or triplicate. The CSPG was coated as circular spots on plastic Petri dishes (3.5 × 1 cm) as described above, and the entire inside surface was blocked with BSA. The plates were then incubated for 2 h with 1 ml of chondroitinase ABC (50 milliunits/ml) or testicular hyaluronidase (50 units/ml) at 37 °C, or heparitinase (20 milliunits/ml) at 43 °C in buffers containing protease inhibitors as described (54Oike Y.

The CSPG-coated plates were also treated with S. hyalurolyticus hyaluronidase (40 units/ml) at 60 °C for 2 h (57Hatae Y. Makita A. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 64: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The plates were washed three times with PBS, pH 7.2, and IRBC adhesion was assayed as described above. The solutions of oligosaccharides or polysaccharides at twice the indicated concentrations in PBS, pH 7.2, were mixed with equal volumes of 4% suspension of IRBCs in PBS, pH 7.2, in 96-well microtiter plates. The suspensions were incubated at room temperature for 30 min with intermittent mixing, and then layered on CSPG-coated spots on Petri dishes. After 40 min at room temperature, the unbound cells were washed and the bound cells were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde, stained with either Giemsa reagent or SYBR green, and measured as outlined above. The CS polysaccharides (20–100 mg) in 2–10 ml of 100 mm sodium acetate, 150 mm sodium chloride, pH 5.0, were treated with ovine testicular hyaluronidase (1000–5000 units) and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h (55Cowman M.K. Slahetka M.F. Hittner D.M. Kim J. Forino M. Gadelrab G. Biochem. J. 1984; 221: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The enzyme digests were heated in a boiling water bath for 5 min, and 1-ml aliquots corresponding to 10 mg of polysaccharide chromatographed on Bio-Gel P-6 columns (1.5 × 70 cm) in 100 mm pyridine, 100 mm acetic acid, pH 5.4. Fractions of 2 ml were collected and aliquots analyzed for oligosaccharide content by the carbazole method (58Dische Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1947; 167: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligosaccharide-containing fractions were separately pooled, lyophilized, and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Prior to lyophilization, tetrasaccharide-containing fractions were desalted on Bio-Gel P-2 columns (1.5 × 75 cm) in 100 mmpyridine, 100 mm acetic acid, pH 5.4. Aliquots containing 3–4 μg of CS oligosaccharides obtained by Bio-Gel P-6 chromatography or 30–50 μg of total digests were dissolved in 100 mm Tris base, 100 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.3, containing 2m sucrose; 0.2% bromphenol blue in the above buffer was used as tracking dye. The solutions were electrophoresed on 1.5-mm-thick 10% polyacrylamide gels (14 × 23.5 cm) in 100 mm Tris base, 100 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.3 (55Cowman M.K. Slahetka M.F. Hittner D.M. Kim J. Forino M. Gadelrab G. Biochem. J. 1984; 221: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The gels were stained with 0.3% Alcian blue in 3% aqueous acetic acid containing 50 mmMgCl2 for 4 h, and destained with the same solution (59Wall R.S. Gyi T.J. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 175: 298-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The gels were further stained with ammoniacal silver (60Krueger Jr., R.C. Schwartz N.B. Anal. Bochem. 1987; 167: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, gels were treated with 10% glutaraldehyde for 30 min, washed three times with water for 30 min. The gels were treated with ammoniacal silver, washed two times with water for 30 s, and then developed with 0.005% citric acid and 0.019% formaldehyde and washed with water. The sodium salt of sturgeon notochord C4S (20 mg) was converted into free acid using Dowex 50W-X8 (H+), neutralized with pyridine, and lyophilized (61Nagasawa K. Inoue Y. Tokuyasu T. J.

https://openalex.org/W2022688526,"DNA and RNA polymerase exhibit similarities in structures and catalytic mechanisms, suggesting that both classes of enzymes are evolutionarily related. To probe the biochemical and structure-function relationship between the two classes of polymerases, a large library (200,000 members) of mutant Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase I (Taq pol I) was created containing random substitutions within a portion of the dNTP binding site (motif A; amino acids 605–617), and a fraction of all selected active Taq pol I (291 of 8000) was tested for the ability to incorporate successive ribonucleotides; 23 unique mutants that added rNTPs into a growing polynucleotide chain were identified and sequenced. These mutants, each containing one to four substitutions, incorporate ribonucleotides at a efficiency approaching 103-fold greater than that of wild type Taq pol I. Several mutants added successive ribonucleotides and thus can catalyze the synthesis of RNA. Sequence analysis of these mutants demonstrates that at least two amino acid residues are involved in excluding ribonucleotides from the active site. Interestingly, wild type DNA polymerases from several distinct families selectively discriminate against rUTP. This study suggests that current DNA and RNA polymerases could have evolved by divergent evolution from an ancestor that shared a common mechanism for polynucleotide synthesis.

DNA polymerase I T. aquaticus wild type polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Molony murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase Both DNA and RNA polymerase can catalyze chain elongation reaction guided by single-stranded DNA templates to generate polynucleotide products (1Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar). The order of nucleotide addition proceeds in a 5′ → 3′ direction via metal-mediated phosphoryl transfer reaction resulting in the formation of phosphodiester bond and release of pyrophosphate (2Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1891-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). In addition, both DNA and RNA polymerases resemble in morphology a cupped human right hand and bind DNA template and the incoming nucleotide within the active site cleft (3Beese L.S. Derbyshire V. Steitz T.A. Science. 1993; 260: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 4Sousa R. Chung Y.J. Rose J.P. Wang B.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). DNA polymerases differ from RNA polymerases in utilizing 2′-deoxynucleotides (dTTP, dCTP, dGTP, and dATP) rather than ribonucleotides (rUTP, rCTP, rGTP, and rATP). A detailed analysis of the polymerase active site is crucial to understanding how these polymerases distinguish between dNTPs and rNTPs, as well as to provide insights on how the two types of polymerases co-evolved to adopt similar mechanisms. Despite the similarity in protein structure and function, there is almost no sequence identity between DNA and RNA polymerases. For example, nearly all of the over 40 prokaryotic and eubacteria DNA pol Is1 sequenced (includingThermus aquaticus pol I, Chlamydia trachomatispol I, and Escherichia coli pol I) contain the DYSQIELR sequence within the dNTP binding site (motif A; Ref. 5Patel P.H. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5095-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), yet RNA pols only have in common the catalytically essential aspartic acid residue (6Delarue M. Poch O. Tordo N. Moras D. Argos P. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). If evolution proceeded from an “RNA world” containing RNA synthesizing enzymes to a “DNA world” with genomes replicated by DNA synthesizing enzymes (7Joyce G.F. Nature. 1989; 338: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 8Joyce G.F. Curr. Biol. 1996; 8: 965-967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (33) Google Scholar), it might be possible to gain insights into this process by substituting random sequences within the active site of a polymerase. Analyses of high resolution x-ray crystal structures suggest that a single side chain prevents diverse polymerases from incorporating ribonucleotides (9Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7514-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 10Doublie S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T.

Rational approaches involving site-directed mutagenesis of this residue result in polymerases that facilitate ribonucleotide incorporation, but substitutions at this residue could not produce polymerases that efficiently incorporate successive ribonucleotides (12Astatke M. Ng K. Grindle N.D.F. Joyce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3402-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 13Gao G. Orlova M. Georgiadis M.M. Hendrickson W.A. Goff S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). A disadvantage of structure-guided site-directed studies is that, by substituting a catalytically important residue to a neutral amino acid, the overall enzyme activity can be impaired. In this report, we offer an alternative to structure based site-directed mutagenesis approach for creating enzymes with unique properties. Assuming that current RNA and DNA polymerases evolved from a common ancestor and share a basic mechanism, it should be possible to evolve one of these enzymes into the other, following extensive rounds of mutagenesis and stringent selection protocols. To explore this concept, we randomly mutated a portion of the active site of a eubacteria DNA polymerase, Taq pol I, selected for functioning mutants, and tested 291 mutant enzymes for the ability to synthesize RNA. Twenty-three different mutant polymerases containing substitutions in predominantly one of two amino acids were identified that incorporated ribonucleotides at a rate approaching 103-fold greater than that of WT Taq DNA polymerase. We show that the active site within several families of WT DNA polymerases is especially evolved to exclude rUTP. The construction of the random Taq pol I library (containing 200,000 individual clones) and genetic selection protocol that yields functional mutants in vivo has been described in detail in a previous publication (5Patel P.H. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5095-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The 350 colonies from the 8000 that complemented pol I temperature sensitive phenotype at 37 °C were isolated and grown in nutrient broth individually overnight at 30 °C. Each culture was grown to A595of 0.3 at 30 °C in 10 ml, and Taq pol I expression was induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubations continued for 4 h. Taq pols were partially purified (50 μl total volume) using a modified protocol from Refs. 14Grimm E. Arbuthnot P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4518-4519Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar and 15Desai U.J. Pfaffle P.K. BioTechniques. 1995; 19 (and 784): 780-782PubMed Google Scholar that allows efficient (>50%) purification of Taq pol I while removing endogenous polymerase and nuclease activities. Biochemical analysis of DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity of these 350 separate pols showed that 291 pols are active at elevated temperatures (>10% activity relative to WT enzyme). Each of the selected Taq pols that retain at least 10% activity relative to WT enzyme at 72 °C (291 total) were tested for the ability to incorporate ribonucleotides. Primer-template constructs were prepared by hybridizing 5′-32P end-labeled 23-mer primer (5′-cgc gcc gaa ttc ccg cta gca at) with 46-mer template (5′-gcg cgg aag ctt ggc tgc aga ata ttg cta gcg gga att cgg cgc g) using a 1:2 primer:template ratio (16Patel P.H. Preston B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The primer/template (5 nm) was incubated in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mmMgCl2, and 1 μl of partially purified Taq pols (0.1 to 0.01 units) in 10-μl volumes in the presence of 0–250 μm each rNTP. Reactions were terminated after 30 min of incubation at 55 °C with the addition of 2 μl of formamide containing stop solution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Products were analyzed by 14% denaturing PAGE (16Patel P.H. Preston B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Incorporation of ribonucleotides relative to deoxyribonucleotides onto nascent primers results in a slower migration on PAGE gels; only mutants that produced products with such migration patterns were considered rNTP incorporating polymerases. The RNA polymerase activity for several of these enzymes was confirmed by assaying for activity in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.1% Triton-X, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mg of activated calf thymus DNA, 10 μm each dCTP, dATP, and dTTP, 500 μm rGTP, 0.25 mCi of [α-32P]dTTP, and 1 μl of WT or mutant Taq pols (0.1 units). Incubations were at 72 °C for 5 min, and reactions were stopped with the addition of 100 μl 0.1 m sodium pyrophosphate, followed by 0.5 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid. Polymerase activity was quantified by collecting precipitated radioactive DNA onto glass filter papers, and the radioactive counts were measured by scintillation. Wild type and mutant (mutants 53, 65, 75, 94, 230, 265, 300, and 346) Taq pols were purified to homogeneity (>90% purity) using a modified procedure (17Engelke D.R. Krikos A. Bruck M.E. Ginsburg D. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 191: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). For step 1, bacteria cultures (DH5α cells; 2 liters) harboring pTaq or selected mutant pTaqLIB plasmid were harvested and lysed in the presence of buffer A (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mm glucose, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Tween 20, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) with lysozyme (4 mg/ml) by freezing and thawing at −70 °C and 70 °C. For step 2, Taq pol was precipitated by the addition of polyethyeneimine at a final concentration of 0.1%, recovered by centrifugation, washed with buffer containing low salt (0.025m KCl) buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Tween 20, 0.5% Nonidet P-40), and then solubilized in 0.15m KCl buffer C. For step 3, the enzyme was diluted to 50 mm KCl and loaded onto a pre-equilibrated HiTrap Heparin 5-ml column at 1 ml/min flow rate. The column was washed with 10 volumes of Buffer C (50 mm KCl), and the protein was eluted using a linear gradient from 50 to 750 mm KCl (60 ml). Fractions (1 ml) were assayed for polymerase activity by measuring incorporation of [α32P]dGTP at 70 °C using activated calf thymus DNA as a template with Mg2+ and all four dNTPs including [α32P]dGTP. Peak fractions with WT and mutant enzymes consistently eluted at approximately 300 mm KCl, were >90% pure upon analysis by SDS-PAGE, and were stored in 20% glycerol at −70 °C. Klenow DNA polymerase I (3′-5′ exo− or 3′-5′ exo+) and Vent polymerase (3′-5′ exo−) were obtained from New England Biolabs. MMLV RT (RNaseH−; SuperScript II) was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. A 47-mer template (3′-gcg cgg ctt aag ggc gat cgt tat agc tta agg cct tta aag ggc cc-5′) was hybridized with one of four primers: 23-mer (5′-cgc gcc gaa ttc ccg cta gca at), 24-mer (5′-cgc gcc gaa ttc ccg cta gca ata), 25-mer (5′-cgc gcc gaa ttc ccg cta gca ata t), or 26-mer (5′-cgc gcc gaa ttc ccg cta gca ata tc). All single nucleotide incorporation with dATP or rATP required 23-mer/47-mer primer/template; reactions with dTTP, dUTP, or rUTP required 24-mer/47-mer; reactions with dCTP or rCTP required 25-mer/47-mer; those with dGTP or rGTP required 26-mer/47-mer. The steady state Michaelis-Menten parameters Vmaxand Km were determined following incubations with limiting amounts of Taq pol in the presence of 5 nm primer/template and varying concentration of each dNTP or rNTP for 10 min at 55 °C for reactions containing Taqpol I or at 37 °C for reactions containing other polymerases as described in Ref. 18Boosalis M.S. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14689-14699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. The kinetic rate parameterkcat was calculated by dividingVmax by the enzyme concentration. All products were analyzed by 14% PAGE and quantified by phosphorimager analysis. Polymerization reactions in the presence of all four rNTPs were conducted with three template sequences: 47-mer 5′-ccc ggg aaa ttt ccg gaa ttc gat att gct agc ggg aat tcg gcg cg-3′; 46-mer 5′-gcg cgg tcg ctt ggc tgc cgt cta ttg cta gcg gga att cgg cgc g; and a template corresponding to the 3′ terminal 125 nucleotides encoding Taq polymerase. Templates were hybridized with 5′-32P-labeled 23-mer primer (5′-cgc gcc gaa ttc ccg cta gca at) to form either 23-mer/47-mer double-stranded DNA (primer-template), 23-mer/46-mer double-stranded DNA, or DNA corresponding to the 3′ terminus of T. aquaticus polA gene as described (16Patel P.H. Preston B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Polymerizations were conducted in vitroat 55 °C for 5–30 min in 10–40-μl reaction mixtures containing 5 nm primer-template, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.1% Triton-X, 2.5 mmMgCl2, all four rNTPs (50–500 μm each), and either WT or mutant Taq pol I (2–20 nm). Reactions were initiated with the addition of enzyme and stopped with the addition of sequencing loading buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). We measured the capacity of several subclasses of DNA polymerases to incorporate ribonucleotide triphosphates relative to dNTPs. DNA polymerases from the thermophile eubacterium T. aquaticus, from hyperthermophile archaea Thermococcus litoralis, from prokaryote E. coli, and from retrovirus MMLV were analyzed. These DNA polymerases represent three major subclasses (6Delarue M. Poch O. Tordo N. Moras D. Argos P. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar): prokaryotic pol I family (Taq pol I and E. coli pol I), mammalian pol α family (Vent pol), and RT (MMLV RT). Incorporation of individual ribonucleotides by WT Taq pol I requires greater amounts of polymerase and at least 1000-fold higher concentrations of each rNTP relative to the corresponding dNTP (Fig. 1). It is important to note that polynucleotide products containing a 3′ ribonucleotide migrate slower within polyacrylamide gels relative to 3′ deoxynucleotide products. This property is useful to monitor the nature of products, as well as to ensure the purity of dNTP and rNTP substrates. Hyperbolic curve fit of steady state rates plotted as a function of nucleotide concentration yields Michaelis-Menten parameters Vmax andKm, and the initial slope of this plot reflects the catalytic efficiency of each enzyme. WT Taq pol I incorporates dGTP, dATP, and dCTP up to 30,000 times more efficiently (kcat/Km) than the respective ribonucleotides (Tables I and III). The low efficiency of rNTP incorporation is largely due to a 1000-fold greater Km for rG, rC, and rA relative to the respective deoxynucleotides. Other DNA polymerases from pol I, pol α, and RT families also incorporate ribonucleotides inefficiently (also largely because of high Km for rNTPs relative to dNTPs; Table I).Table IEfficiency of dNTP and rNTP incorporation opposite complementary bases by diverse polymerasesProteinNucleotideVmax(rel)KmVmax/KmDiscrimination 1-aDiscrimination represents the efficiency (Vmax/Km) of dNTP incorporation divided by efficiency of the corresponding rNTP.

Although Taq pol I incorporates dTTP and dUTP opposite template dA residue with approximately equal efficiencies, the WT enzyme incorporates dTTP 106-fold more efficiently than rUTP (Table I). Selection against rUTP by Taq pol I is 100-fold more stringent than the other three ribonucleotides. DNA polymerases from pol I, pol α, and RT classes also exhibit a high propensity to exclude ribouracil. For example, Klenow pol (3′-5′ exo−) incorporates rCTP and rUTP 3100 and 130,000 times less efficiently relative to dCTP and dTTP, respectively, and ribonucleotide incorporation by Klenow pol (exo+) is less efficient, indicating the 3′-5′ proofreading domain excises ribonucleotides off the nascent primer. Efficiency of rATP incorporation opposite template dT is comparable with that of rCTP incorporation opposite template dG forTaq pol, Klenow pol, Vent pol, and MMLV RT (data not shown). Astatke et al. (12Astatke M. Ng K. Grindle N.D.F. Joyce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3402-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) reported that Klenow (exo−) discriminates against rCTP and rUTP by similar factors and that discrimination against rNTPs lies exclusively at the level ofkcat, where as we find the differences between rNTPs and dNTPs are at the Km level. In assays used by Astatke et al. (12Astatke M. Ng K. Grindle N.D.F. Joyce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3402-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), kcat refers to the rate of the conformation change and/or nucleotide incorporation;kcat in our steady state experiments corresponds to the rate of enzyme turnover. The nucleotide incorporation efficiency values (kcat/Km in steady state experiments and kcat/Kdin single turnover assays) in the two studies are consistent. These data indicate that several families of DNA polymerases have evolved a sophisticated mechanism to exclude ribonucleotides, especially uracil, from its catalytic site. Assuming that DNA and RNA polymerases are related mechanistically and in structure-function, it should be possible to distinguish residues responsible for dNTP versus rNTP substrate specificity following extensive mutagenesis of the polymerase active site and genetic selection of active mutants. We previously created a Taq pol I library composed of 8,000 active members containing substitutions within active site (motif A) residues. To determine whether this plasticity within the catalytic site architecture can confer altered substrate specificity, we further analyzed all 291 selected Taq pol I, including 27 with wild type amino acid sequence, for the ability to incorporate ribonucleotides. Briefly, this analysis involved incubation of 0.01–0.1 unit of Taq pol I with 32P-labeled oligonucleotide primer-template in the presence of all four rNTPs. Products were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by autoradiography. Incorporation of ribonucleotides relative to deoxyribonucleotides onto nascent primers results in a slower migration on PAGE gels; only mutants that produced products with such unique migration patterns were considered rNTP incorporating polymerases. This screen identified that a small subset of the selected enzymes (23 of 291) can incorporate rNTPs efficiently (TableII). None of the 27 WT Taqpols containing silent mutations could efficiently catalyze ribonucleotide incorporation above the sensitivity of this assay. The 23 ribonucleotide incorporating mutants contain amino acid substitutions at distinct loci and can be divided into two major classes. 1) Those encoding a hydrophilic substitution at Ile-614; these enzymes constitute the majority of rNTP incorporating mutants containing from 0 to 1 additional substitutions (suggesting that alterations at this site do not require secondary compensatory amino acid substitutions to maintain physiologic activity). 2) Those that encode a E615D substitution; these enzymes contain 1–3 other substitutions (suggesting that substitutions at this site require compensatory mutations to maintain physiologic activity). Mutants (mutants 53, 65, 75, 94, 230, 265, 300, and 346) were purified to homogeneity and tested for the ability to incorporate rGTP into a biologically relevant gapped calf thymus DNA substrate. Each of these polymerases conducts efficient synthesis in the presence of rGTP (as judged by incorporation of [α-32P]dTTP, whereas mutant polymerases containing other types of substitutions and WTTaq pol I controls produced significantly lower product yields. These data indicate that amino acid residues Ile-614 and Glu-615 within the evolutionarily conserved motif A are the primary amino acids involved in discriminating against ribonucleotide incorporation.Table IISequences of rNTP incorporating Taq polymerasesNo. of amino acid changesMutant605 LLVALDYSQ614 I615 EL617 R1 53 2-aUnderlining denotes mutants exhibit WT activity.K 75M2 65DP 94SN164VK187LK198MQ205LQ221VD230RF265NI273GD340VD346DD3 79DVD159ILK166MMD175 2-bThese two mutants differ in nucleotide sequence.FTD298VVK299TFW300 2-bThese two mutants differ in nucleotide sequence.FTD4 26MVVD 48RKDM2-a Underlining denotes mutants exhibit WT activity.2-b These two mutants differ in nucleotide sequence. Open table in a new tab To characterize the efficiency of dNTP relative to rNTP incorporation by WT and mutant enzymes, the steady state kcat andKm values of nucleotide incorporation were determined. The plots of nucleotide incorporation rates as a function of nucleotide concentration exhibited typical Michaelis-Menten saturation kinetics for all reactions containing either dNTPs or rNTPs with either mutant or WT enzymes. Thekcat/Km value obtained from fitting a hyperbolic curve directly measures the efficiency of nucleotide incorporation. Mutant homogenous enzymes containing specific substitutions at position 614 and 615 incorporate rGTP, rATP, and rCTP at an efficiency (kcat/Km) approaching110that of the corresponding dNTP (TableIII; dNTP/rNTP discrimination). The steady state rate (kcat) for each dNTP incorporation is similar to that of rNTP incorporation for these mutants, thus indicating that rate-limiting step (i.e.enzyme turnover) is comparable for the mutant enzymes during either dNTP or rNTP incorporation reactions. In contrast, the WT enzyme incorporates each of the rNTPs 10–100 times slower relative to the respective dNTPs. In addition, whereas the mutant enzymes exhibit 10–100-fold higher Km for rGTP, rATP, and rCTP incorporation relative to the respective dNTPs, the WT enzyme exhibits >1000-fold higher Km for these rNTPs relative to the respective dNTPs, and the WT enzyme exhibits ≈50,000-fold higherKm for rUTP relative to dTTP or dUTP. Overall, the mutants incorporate each ribonucleotide up to 3 orders of magnitude more efficiently than the WT polymerase (Table III; dNTP/rNTP Discrimination). Mechanistically, the ability of the mutant polymerases to efficiently incorporate ribonucleotide results from a >10-fold faster incorporation rate relative to WT enzymes and the ability to incorporate rNTPs at concentrations that are significantly below physiologic levels. The relatively fast catalytic rate of rNTP incorporation, coupled with the Km for rNTP significantly lower than the in vivo ribonucleotide concentration (approximately 1000 μm each), suggest these enzymes should be able to incorporate ribonucleotides at physiologic conditions. To determine whether these polymerases can function as RNA polymerases by incorporating multiple ribonucleotides sequentially, we incubated purified WT Taq pol I, a mutant containing a substitution at Ile-614, and a mutant containing a substitution at Glu-615 in the presence of increasing amounts of all four rNTPs (Fig. 2). Although the WT enzyme inefficiently incorporates and extends ribonucleotides, both rNTP utilizing mutant enzymes polymerize multiple ribonucleotides, even at rNTP concentrations below that found in cells. Interestingly, the strong pause sites produced at runs of template dAs is exactly what one would predict from the kinetic data (Tables I and III), demonstrating a specific decrease in incorporation (and perhaps a decreased extension of 3′-rU sequences). Extension past these runs is facilitated by either increasing incubation time or increasing ribonucleotide concentration. In the presence of a trace amount of a metal cofactor Mn+2(0.5 mm Mn+2 and 2.5 mmMg+2), this pause site is markedly reduced, and elongation proceeds up to the 5′ end of the template even in presence of low rNTP concentrations. Elongated RNA products are also efficiently generated by mutant polymerases containing substitutions at either Ile-614 or Glu615 using templates containing minimal template dA residues. Using such a template, RNA polymerization to the 5′ template terminus by specific mutant polymerases occurs in a time-dependent manner and within minutes of incubation (Fig. 3). RNA synthesis is inefficient with the WT Taq pol I even after prolonged incubation times, and the limited products formed by WT enzyme are resistant to alkali degradation. In contrast, addition of alkali degraded elongated products synthesized by mutant enzymes to regenerate the initial substrate, illustrating the products are RNA (Fig. 2, lane 32 C, and Fig. 3, lanes OH). From the time-dependent accumulation of products, we estimate that the mutant Taq pols can synthesize extended RNA products (containing >10 nucleotides) at a >1000-fold faster rate relative to WT Taq pol I. The ability to synthesize long RNA products correlates with the DNA polymerase activity of the mutant enzyme. For example mutant 94 (A608S,I614N) with low DNA polymerase activity as measured on activated calf thymus DNA does not efficiently synthesize long stretches of RNA. Mutant Taq pol Is exhibiting high DNA polymerase activity (mutants 75 (I614M), 265 (I614N,L616I), and 346 (A608D,E615D)) can synthesize nucleic acids containing as many as 100 successive ribonucleotides on templates with limited dA residues (data not shown). To our knowledge, this is the first report of a highly active polymerase that can efficiently synthesize long stretches of either DNA or RNA.Figure 3RNA synthesis.

Incubations (40 μl) were stopped by removing 10 μl of the incubation sample after 5, 15, and 30 min into formamide containing stop solution; the remaining 10 μl was further incubated in the presence of 1.0n NaOH for 10 min at 55 °C (lane sOH) prior to adding stop solution. The migration pattern of product bands by WTTaq pol I is not the same as that with mutant enzyme upon varying exposure intensity, and products formed by WT enzyme are resistant to alkali hydrolysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) There are two major conclusions from this study. First, DNA polymerases selectively exclude rUTP. Second, amino acid substitutions at two different positions within the DNA polymerase catalytic site can result in enzymes that incorporate ribonucleotides and synthesize RNA. These findings were not predicted by analysis of high resolution x-ray crystal structures. These observations link DNA and RNA polymerization mechanisms and may provide insights into the evolution of DNA polymerases during the postulated progression form an RNA into DNA world (7Joyce G.F. Nature. 1989; 338: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 8Joyce G.F. Curr. Biol. 1996; 8: 965-967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Taq pol I incorporates rUTP 1,000,000-fold less efficiently relative to dTTP or dUTP (Tables I and III). Joyce and co-workers (12Astatke M. Ng K. Grindle N.D.F. Joyce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3402-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) also showed that WT E. coli pol I discriminates against rUTP relative to dTTP by 106-fold. We extended this finding by comparing dNTP relative to rNTP incorporation by DNA polymerases from different families. Our results indicate that ribouracil triphosphate exclusion is a general property of many DNA polymerases. With WTTaq pol I, the 106-fold difference in nucleotide incorporation efficiency between dTTP or dUTP relative to rUTP incorporation is the highest discrimination factor that we have encountered with natural substrates. Although the concentration of each deoxynucleotide including dTTP is 25–100 μm in organisms, that of each ribonucleotides, including rUTP, is approximately 1000 μm (19Traut T.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar). We estimate that if WTTaq pol I were to replicate the entire 2 × 106 base pair eubacteria genome (20Moreira L.M. Da Costa M.S. Sa-Correia I. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 2: 92-102Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar), assuming the rUTP concentration is 10-fold greater than that of dTTP, WT Taqpol I should introduce approximately 10 rUMP into genomic DNA per replication cycle, and these substitutions would presumably be corrected by DNA repair. Other polymerases from prokaryotic pol I, eukaryotic pol α, and RT families also discriminate against ribouracil (Table I). This DNA polymerase property of specifically discriminating against ribouracil might have resulted from natural selection. Cells have evolved mechanisms to exclude uracil from DNA. When formed by deamination of cytadines (21Lindahl T. Nyberg B. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3405-3410Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), uracil is a potent promutagen inducing G·C→A·T transition mutations (22Duncan B.K. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 2: 750-755Crossref Google Scholar). Uracil lesions are also formed by the incorporation of dUTP by DNA polymerases because dUTP can readily substitute for dTTP (Table I and Ref. 23Olivera B.M. Manlapaz-Ramos P. Warner H.R. Duncan B.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 128: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Removal of uracil residues in DNA is accomplished by uracil-DNA glycosylase, and repair synthesis involves the generation of single-stranded breaks, a potential source of mutagenesis (24Bonura T. Schultz R. Friedberg E.C. Biochemistry. 1982; 10: 2548-2556Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 25Slupphaug G. Mol C.D. Kavli B. Arvai A.S. Krokan H.E. Tainer J.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). In cells, rUTP is present in millimolar concentrations, well in excess of dTTP and dUTP concentrations (on average, 40 and 0.2 μm, respectively; Refs. 19Traut T.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar and 23Olivera B.M. Manlapaz-Ramos P. Warner H.R. Duncan B.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 128: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and thus can be a potent source of damage (e.g. single-stranded breaks) if introduced into DNA in amounts that exceed the capacity of the cell for DNA repair. Analysis of a high resolution crystal structure of Taq pol I bound to DNA and dNTP (9Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7514-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) suggested that a single residue can sterically exclude the 2′-OH of an incoming rNTP (Fig. 4). This glutamic acid residue is conserved in over 35 prokaryotic and eubacteria pol I sequences, including that of E. coli pol I (GenBankTM; Ref. 5Patel P.H. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5095-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Polymerases in the pol α and RT families contain a planar ringed amino acid (usually Tyr or Phe) at this locus; within the HIV-1 RT structure bound with DNA and dNTP the homologous Tyr-115 residue is positioned adjacent to the incoming nucleotide and likely also prevents incorporation of ribonucleotides by sterically interfering with 2′-OH group (11Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar, 26Bonnin B. Lazaro J.M. Blanco L. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 1: 241-251Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Modeling the selected substitutions into WTTaq pol I structure, followed by energy minimization suggests there are at least two mechanisms by which the steric interference conferred by Taq pol I Glu-615 with the 2′-OH group of the incoming ribonucleotide can be alleviated. First, modeling studies in Taq pol I suggests alterations that reduce the length of the Glu-615 side chain should permit ribonucleotide binding (Fig. 4 and Table III). Joyce and co-workers (12Astatke M. Ng K. Grindle N.D.F. Joyce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3402-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) demonstrated that E710A substitution within E. coli pol I (Klenow), at a site identical to Taq pol I Glu-615 residue, permits ribonucleotide incorporation. We find substitutions to aspartic acid for Taq pol I Glu-615 facilitates ribonucleotide incorporation. So far, we have not yet detected a Glu → Ala substitution in the Taq pol I motif A active mutant library, as well as within an extensive motif A mutant library of E. coli pol I, presumably because of reduced catalytic activity of mutants not containing either Asp or Glu at this site (5Patel P.H. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5095-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). 2P. H. Patel and L. A. Loeb, J. Biol. Chem., in press.. Second, we find that diverse substitutions at the adjacent residue Ile-614 allow ribonucleotide incorporation and that evolved enzymes containing substitutions at position 614 utilize rNTPs at efficiencies equivalent to enzymes containing E615D substitutions (Fig. 3 and Table III). Analysis of Taq pol I structure model bound with DNA and a rNTP shows the ribose ring of the rNTP packs closely against Ile-614. Residue Ile-614 is located at a junction of a highly conserved β strand and α helix and is highly mutable. Energy minimizations of models of substitutions at this residue, which confers the ability to incorporate rNTPs, suggest that these substitutions cause this junction to be located further from the incoming nucleotide, thus allowing 2′-OH to fit. In summary, we find that motif A within the DNA polymerase active site is highly plastic and can tolerate numerous substitutions while preserving physiologic DNA polymerase activity, and we have used this flexibility in structure to evolve a set of enzymes with altered substrate specificity. Mutant polymerases that can synthesize both DNA and RNA may be useful for biotechnology and allow automated coupled polymerase chain reaction amplification and transcription by cycling nucleotide triphosphates within the reaction mixture. These polymerases could also be used for DNA sequence analysis, following specific incorporation of a ribonucleotide during polymerase chain reaction and subsequent alkali cleavage at the position of ribosubstitution (27Barnes W.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 119: 83-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition, these polymerases allow one to introduce nucleotide analogs containing adducts (e.g. fluorophores) attached to the 2′ ribose ring. The plasticity of the DNA polymerase active site should facilitate evolution within the laboratory of other polymerases for the incorporation of specific nucleotide analogs that are of mechanistic or medical importance.

If so, it would provide an explanation for the deleterious effects that have been associated with the overproduction or overadministration of this enzyme (12Omar B.A. Gad N.M. Jordan N.C.

Thus, the conversion of Fe(II) to Fe(III) can be followed at 420 nm (15Schellenberg K.A. Hellerman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 231: 547-556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): Fe(II) is not autoxidizable to a noticeable degree; Fe(II) has already been shown to reduce the active site Cu(II) of Cu,Zn-SOD (16Rotilio G. Morpurgo L. Calabrese L. Mondovi B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 302: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); and the rate of spontaneous reduction of Fe(III) by O⨪2 is slow with a rate constant at 25 °C of ∼2.7 × 102m−1 s−1 (17Zehavi D. Rabani J. J. Phys. Chem. 1972; 76: 3703-3709Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In what follows, we demonstrated that Cu,Zn-SOD can act as a Fe(II):O⨪2oxidoreductase (i.e. as a SOR) and an O⨪2:Fe(III) oxidoreductase (i.e. as a SOO), and we discussed the possible consequences of these activities.MATERIALS AND METHODSK4Fe(CN)6 was from Fisher Scientific, K3Fe(CN)6 was from J.

Bovine cream xanthine oxidase (XO) was prepared by Ralph Wiley (18Waud W.R. Brady F.O. Wiley R.D. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1975; 169: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Acetaldehyde was freshly distilled each day. It was used as the substrate for XO in place of xanthine because urate rapidly reduced Fe(CN)63−(19Fridovich I. Handler P. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 1581-1585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and also because acetaldehyde could be used at 20 mm,allowing relatively large fluxes of O⨪2 to be maintained without a significant depletion of the substrate. Reactions were performed at 23 °C in 50 mm MOPS, 0.1 mmDETAPAC, 20 mm acetaldehyde, 1.0 mm Fe(II) or 0.5 mm Fe(III), 0.2 mg/ml Cu,Zn-SOD, and enough XO to cause the production of 12 nmol of O⨪2/min/ml when Fe(II) oxidation was to be followed and 15 nmol of O⨪2/min/ml when Fe(III) reduction was to be followed. The rate of O⨪2 production was measured by replacing Fe(II) or Fe(III) with 0.020 mmferricytochrome c and decreasing [XO] by a factor of 5. The molar rate of cytochrome c reduction, which could be 100% inhibited by SOD, was equal to the rate of O⨪2production. Fe(II) oxidation or Fe(III) reduction was followed at 420 nm using E m−1cm−1 = 1020 (15Schellenberg K.A. Hellerman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 231: 547-556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other components when present are specified in the figure legends.DISCUSSIONWe have seen that Cu,Zn-SOD can catalyze the dismutation of O⨪2, the reduction of O⨪2 by Fe(II), or the oxidation of O⨪2 by Fe(III). That is to say that Cu,Zn-SOD can act as a SOD, SOR, or SOO. Although these activities were demonstrated using the decidedly unnatural Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox couple, it is possible that in the reducing environment of the cell, there is some natural redox pair that can interact with the active site of the Cu,Zn-SOD. Because a number of otherwise puzzling observations can be explained based on these multiple activities, it may be worthwhile to express the component reactions and their relationships more rigorously.SOD activity depends upon the sum of Reactions 1 and 2 as noted earlier. The SOR activity involves Reactions 3 and 2, whereas the SOO activity involves Reactions 4 and 1. E−Cu(II)+Fe(II)→E−Cu(I)+Fe(III) REACTION3and E−Cu(I)+Fe(III)→E−Cu(II)+Fe(II) REACTION4The rates of the component reactions can be written as follows.VI=kI[E−Cu(II)][O⨪2]Equation 1 VII=kII[E−Cu(I)][O⨪2]Equation 2 VIII=kIII[E−Cu(II)][Fe(II)]Equation 3 VIV=kIV[E−Cu(I)][Fe(III)]Equation 4 Under steady state conditions, the sum of the rates of the reduction of E − Cu(II) must equal the sum of the rates of the oxidation of E − Cu(I), hence,VI + VIII =VII + VIV. In the presence of a constant flux of O⨪2 and when [Fe(II)] ≫ [Fe(III)]VIV is negligible and thenVI+VIII=VIIEquation 5 or equivalentlykI[E−Cu(II)][O⨪2]+kIII[E−Cu(II)][Fe(II)]Equation 6 =kII[E−Cu(I)][O⨪2]When [Cu,Zn-SOD] is increased the VIIIterm increases in direct proportion because Fe(II) is in large excess and is effectively constant, but VI andVII will not increase proportionately because [O⨪2] will fall as [Cu,Zn-SOD] increases. It follows that increasing [Cu,Zn-SOD] will favor SOR activity over SOD activity. This effect was demonstrated in Fig. 1 B. Similarly, raising Fe(II) will also increase the SOR:SOD ratio.Anything that decreases [O⨪2] will favor the SOR reaction over the SOD reaction. This can be made obvious by rearranging Equation6.kIII[E−Cu(II)][Fe(II)]Equation 7 =(kII[E−Cu(I)]−kI[E−Cu(II)])[O⨪2]The left side of Equation 7 must fall as [O⨪2] falls, but the SOR:SOD ratio will rise because decreasing [O⨪2] will increase the [E − Cu(I)]:[E− Cu(II)] ratio. This is the case because O⨪2 is the only oxidant of E − Cu(I) under the conditions specified. We have seen that decreasing [O⨪2] by increasing [Cu,Zn-SOD], by adding Mn-SOD, or by lowering [XO] increased the SOR:SOD ratio in accordance with these deductions.The Fe(II)/Fe(III) couple has been shown here to support the SOR and SOO activities of Cu,Zn-SOD but not the activities of Mn-SOD because this redox couple interacts with the active site copper but not with the active site manganese. If the cell contains redox couples competent to interact with both active sites, both Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD could act as SORs and SOOs. Given that cell cytosols are reducing environments, SOR activity is more likely to occur in vivo than SOO activity.Whether the SOD enzymes act only in the SOD, SOR, or SOO modes, they have an effect on the amount of H2O2 produced from O⨪2. Thus, in the SOD reaction, 0.5 H2O2 is produced per O⨪2 consumed, whereas in the SOR mode, 1.0 H2O2 is the yield per O⨪2. In the SOO mode, no H2O2 would be made from O⨪2. Because we have seen that lowering [O⨪2] favors the SOR mode, we deduce that raising [Cu,Zn-SOD] would increase H2O2production only in the presence of a reductant capable of reducing the active site Cu(II). If O⨪2 were acting to initiate oxidative chain reactions, then the yield of H2O2/O⨪2 could be significantly greater than 1.0 H2O2/O⨪2. In such a situation SODs would decrease H2O2 production.If an endogenous reductant that can act as a SOR substrate is an essential molecule or if its oxidized form is toxic, we can understand the reports that overproduction (13Amstad P. Peskin A. Shah G. Mirault M.E. Moret R. Zbinden I. Cerutti P Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9305-9313Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 14Scott M.D. Meshnick J.R. Eaton J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2498-2501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or overadministration (12Omar B.A. Gad N.M. Jordan N.C. Striplin S.P. Russel W.T. Downey J.M. McCord J.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1990; 9: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) of SOD has deleterious effects. Thus, increasing [SOD] increases the SOR:SOD ratio because it lowers [O⨪2] and at the same time increases the net SOR action. The neurotoxic effect of the mutant forms of Cu,Zn-SOD that have been associated with the familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (22Estevez A. Crow J.P. Sampson J.B. Reiter C. Zhuang Y. Richardson G.J. Tarpey M.M. Barbeito L. Beckman J.S. Science. 1999; 286: 2498-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) may be because of SOR activity. Thus, the mutated Cu,Zn-SODs may be able to catalyze the oxidation of essential reductants within motor neurons by O⨪2, a SOR activity that is not exerted by the wild-type enzyme.O⨪2 is scavenged very effectively by desulfoferrodoxin (7Liochev S.I.

The SOD-mimic O-Mn(III)meso-tetrakis-(N-methylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin (MnTMPyP) has also been reported to act as a SOR within E. coli (11Faulkner K.M. Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23471-23476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given that low molecular weight SOD-mimics are certain to be less discriminating than the SODs themselves with regard to interaction with reductants, it seems probable that the biological effects of most of these mimics are because of SOR rather than SOD activity. The results of Offer et al. (23Offer T. Russo A. Samuni A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) who have reported that the nitroxide-catalyzed oxidation of Fe(II) by a flux of O⨪2 could be inhibited by low [Cu,Zn-SOD] but not by high [Cu,Zn-SOD] can now be understood in terms of the increase in SOR activity with increasing [Cu,Zn-SOD] as described above. It should be stressed that any agent acting as a SOR could be beneficial or detrimental depending on the nature of the reductant consumed and the oxidized product generated from thereon, the availability of that reductant and the possibility of its regeneration, and the magnitude of the flux of O⨪2 and the availability of critical targets for O⨪2 attack. Thus, not only the toxic effects of the nitroxides as Offer et al. (23Offer T. Russo A. Samuni A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) suggest but also their beneficial actions are explicable on the basis of their SOR activity. The family of superoxide dismutases (SODs)1 encompasses enzymes containing copper + zinc (1McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 224: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), manganese (2Keele B.B. McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol.

J. 1996; 318: 889-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) at their active sites. They provide a defense against oxidative stress by catalyzing the dismutation of O⨪2 into H2O2 plus O2 and do so at close to the limit imposed by diffusional encounters (5Klug D. Rabani J. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4839-4842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Rotilio G. Bray R.C. Fielden E.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 268: 605-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Their mechanism of action is based upon the reduction and reoxidation of the catalytic metal center by O⨪2 as illustrated in reactions 1 and 2 for the case of Cu,Zn-SOD. E−Cu(II)+O⨪2⇄E−Cu(I)+O2 REACTION1and E−Cu(I)+O⨪2+2H+⇄E−Cu(II)+H2O2 REACTION2If an electron donor other than O⨪2 was to reduce the active site Cu(II) to Cu(I), the SOD would then act as a reductant:O⨪2 oxidoreductase, i.e. as a superoxide reductase (SOR).

In such a situation SODs would decrease H2O2 production.If an endogenous reductant that can act as a SOR substrate is an essential molecule or if its oxidized form is toxic, we can understand the reports that overproduction (13Amstad P.

Thus, increasing [SOD] increases the SOR:SOD ratio because it lowers [O⨪2] and at the same time increases the net SOR action. The neurotoxic effect of the mutant forms of Cu,Zn-SOD that have been associated with the familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (22Estevez A. Crow J.P. Sampson J.B. Reiter C. Zhuang Y.

Thus, the mutated Cu,Zn-SODs may be able to catalyze the oxidation of essential reductants within motor neurons by O⨪2, a SOR activity that is not exerted by the wild-type enzyme.O⨪2 is scavenged very effectively by desulfoferrodoxin (7Liochev S.I.

The SOD-mimic O-Mn(III)meso-tetrakis-(N-methylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin (MnTMPyP) has also been reported to act as a SOR within E. coli (11Faulkner K.M. Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23471-23476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given that low molecular weight SOD-mimics are certain to be less discriminating than the SODs themselves with regard to interaction with reductants, it seems probable that the biological effects of most of these mimics are because of SOR rather than SOD activity. The results of Offer et al. (23Offer T. Russo A. Samuni A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) who have reported that the nitroxide-catalyzed oxidation of Fe(II) by a flux of O⨪2 could be inhibited by low [Cu,Zn-SOD] but not by high [Cu,Zn-SOD] can now be understood in terms of the increase in SOR activity with increasing [Cu,Zn-SOD] as described above. It should be stressed that any agent acting as a SOR could be beneficial or detrimental depending on the nature of the reductant consumed and the oxidized product generated from thereon, the availability of that reductant and the possibility of its regeneration, and the magnitude of the flux of O⨪2 and the availability of critical targets for O⨪2 attack. Thus, not only the toxic effects of the nitroxides as Offer et al. (23Offer T. Russo A. Samuni A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) suggest but also their beneficial actions are explicable on the basis of their SOR activity. We have seen that Cu,Zn-SOD can catalyze the dismutation of O⨪2, the reduction of O⨪2 by Fe(II), or the oxidation of O⨪2 by Fe(III). That is to say that Cu,Zn-SOD can act as a SOD, SOR, or SOO. Although these activities were demonstrated using the decidedly unnatural Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox couple, it is possible that in the reducing environment of the cell, there is some natural redox pair that can interact with the active site of the Cu,Zn-SOD. Because a number of otherwise puzzling observations can be explained based on these multiple activities, it may be worthwhile to express the component reactions and their relationships more rigorously. SOD activity depends upon the sum of Reactions 1 and 2 as noted earlier. The SOR activity involves Reactions 3 and 2, whereas the SOO activity involves Reactions 4 and 1. E−Cu(II)+Fe(II)→E−Cu(I)+Fe(III) REACTION3and E−Cu(I)+Fe(III)→E−Cu(II)+Fe(II) REACTION4The rates of the component reactions can be written as follows.VI=kI[E−Cu(II)][O⨪2]Equation 1 VII=kII[E−Cu(I)][O⨪2]Equation 2 VIII=kIII[E−Cu(II)][Fe(II)]Equation 3 VIV=kIV[E−Cu(I)][Fe(III)]Equation 4 Under steady state conditions, the sum of the rates of the reduction of E − Cu(II) must equal the sum of the rates of the oxidation of E − Cu(I), hence,VI + VIII =VII + VIV. In the presence of a constant flux of O⨪2 and when [Fe(II)] ≫ [Fe(III)]VIV is negligible and thenVI+VIII=VIIEquation 5 or equivalentlykI[E−Cu(II)][O⨪2]+kIII[E−Cu(II)][Fe(II)]Equation 6 =kII[E−Cu(I)][O⨪2]When [Cu,Zn-SOD] is increased the VIIIterm increases in direct proportion because Fe(II) is in large excess and is effectively constant, but VI andVII will not increase proportionately because [O⨪2] will fall as [Cu,Zn-SOD] increases. It follows that increasing [Cu,Zn-SOD] will favor SOR activity over SOD activity. This effect was demonstrated in Fig. 1 B. Similarly, raising Fe(II) will also increase the SOR:SOD ratio. Anything that decreases [O⨪2] will favor the SOR reaction over the SOD reaction. This can be made obvious by rearranging Equation6.kIII[E−Cu(II)][Fe(II)]Equation 7 =(kII[E−Cu(I)]−kI[E−Cu(II)])[O⨪2]The left side of Equation 7 must fall as [O⨪2] falls, but the SOR:SOD ratio will rise because decreasing [O⨪2] will increase the [E − Cu(I)]:[E− Cu(II)] ratio. This is the case because O⨪2 is the only oxidant of E − Cu(I) under the conditions specified. We have seen that decreasing [O⨪2] by increasing [Cu,Zn-SOD], by adding Mn-SOD, or by lowering [XO] increased the SOR:SOD ratio in accordance with these deductions. The Fe(II)/Fe(III) couple has been shown here to support the SOR and SOO activities of Cu,Zn-SOD but not the activities of Mn-SOD because this redox couple interacts with the active site copper but not with the active site manganese. If the cell contains redox couples competent to interact with both active sites, both Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD could act as SORs and SOOs. Given that cell cytosols are reducing environments, SOR activity is more likely to occur in vivo than SOO activity. Whether the SOD enzymes act only in the SOD, SOR, or SOO modes, they have an effect on the amount of H2O2 produced from O⨪2. Thus, in the SOD reaction, 0.5 H2O2 is produced per O⨪2 consumed, whereas in the SOR mode, 1.0 H2O2 is the yield per O⨪2. In the SOO mode, no H2O2 would be made from O⨪2. Because we have seen that lowering [O⨪2] favors the SOR mode, we deduce that raising [Cu,Zn-SOD] would increase H2O2production only in the presence of a reductant capable of reducing the active site Cu(II). If O⨪2 were acting to initiate oxidative chain reactions, then the yield of H2O2/O⨪2 could be significantly greater than 1.0 H2O2/O⨪2. In such a situation SODs would decrease H2O2 production. If an endogenous reductant that can act as a SOR substrate is an essential molecule or if its oxidized form is toxic, we can understand the reports that overproduction (13Amstad P. Peskin A. Shah G.

This is a consequence of the lack of success in crystallizing the protein, probably because of its sequence and post-translational heterogeneity, its instability, and its tendency to form oligomers and polymers of highly aberrant morphology in the presence of many of these drugs. The recent electron crystallographic determination of a relatively detailed structure for zinc-induced antiparallel tubulin protofilaments has provided insights into the paclitaxel/docetaxel site on these protofilaments, since docetaxel was used to enhance their stability during data accumulation (1Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar), and provided a scaffold on which to model other drug sites (2Downing K.H. Nogales E. Eur. Biophys. J. 1998; 27: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A limitation in such analysis, however, is that drugs that inhibit assembly have limited ability to bind to tubulin polymers containing linear pro- tofilaments. Alternative approaches to obtain preliminary information about drug binding sites have included “direct” photoaffinity labeling (e.g. Ref. 3Wolff J. Knipling L. Cahnmann H.J. Palumbo G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2820-2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), analog photoaffinity labeling (e.g. Ref. 4Rao S. Krauss N.E. Heerding J.M. Swindell C.S. Ringel I. Orr G.A. Horwitz S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3132-3134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and cross-link formation with chemically reactive analogs that retain biological activity (e.g. Ref. 5Bai R. Pei X.-F. Boyé O. Getahun Z. Grover S. Bekisz J. Nguyen N.Y. Brossi A. Hamel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12639-12645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In the first method, a drug-tubulin complex is exposed to light of an appropriate wave-length, and ligand-protein cross-link formation is evaluated. In the second, an active drug analog containing a photoreactive moiety is prepared and bound to tubulin, and cross-link formation is induced by exposure of the complex to light of an appropriate wavelength. In the third method, an active analog with a chemically reactive moiety is prepared and bound to tubulin, and cross-link formation occurs either spontaneously or, in principle, following a rapid change in reaction conditions. Generally, the reactive ligand is radiolabeled to permit quantitation of the reaction and identification of peptides in the protein involved in cross-link formation. In all cases, there are two major problems. The first is the potential for nonspecific protein alkylation by the ligand, which is generally excluded by demonstrating that excess nonreactive ligand substantially inhibits the covalent reaction. The second is that adequate radiolabel participates in cross-link formation to permit identification of the tubulin subunit (α or β), the peptide region of the subunit, and, ideally, the specific amino acid residue(s) involved. The tubulin-colchicine interaction has attracted a great deal of attention, probably because of its unusual chemical characteristics (for a review, see Ref. 6Hastie S.B. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 51: 377-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The drug (structure in Fig. 1) binds exceptionally slowly, but noncovalently, to tubulin, and, once formed, the drug-protein complex is highly stable. Although some have described the association reaction as “essentially irreversible” (6Hastie S.B. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 51: 377-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), the dissociation reaction has been carefully studied, and the half-life of the tubulin-colchicine complex varies from 14 to 77 h at 37 °C, depending on precise reaction conditions. In addition, the interaction of tubulin with colchicine appears to involve significant changes in conformation in both the drug and the protein. Photoaffinity analogs of colchicine have reacted predominantly with α-tubulin or with both subunits (7Williams R.F. Mumford C.L. Williams G.A. Floyd L.J. Aivaliotis M.J. Martinez R.A. Robinson A.K.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8515-8525Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In contrast, direct photoaffinity labeling, with irradiation at 350 nm (the absorbance maximum of the tropolonic C ring of colchicinoids), resulted in strongly preferential labeling of β-tubulin (3Wolff J. Knipling L. Cahnmann H.J. Palumbo G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2820-2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 9Uppuluri S. Knipling L. Sackett D.L. Wolff J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11598-11602Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). A cross-link was formed between radiolabeled colchicine and amino acid(s) in peptide sequence 1–36 or peptide sequence 214–241, but not with both peptides. Our own approach has been to place the small chloroacetyl group (about 3 Å in length) at various locations in analogs of colchicine and thiocolchicine. When placed in the side chain or the C ring, we observed no significant specific covalent reaction with tubulin. The derivatized A ring analogs 2CTC1 and 3CTC, however, are active colchicine site compounds that react covalently with β-tubulin (structures in Fig. 1). The reactions are specific in that they are extensively inhibited by colchicine site drugs, and the two reactions have different properties. We previously showed that 3CTC reacted predominantly with cysteine 354 of β-tubulin and noted that there was a minor reaction as well with cysteine 239 (5Bai R. Pei X.-F. Boyé O. Getahun Z.

In the present study, we demonstrate the reactivity of 2CTC predominantly with cysteine 239 but secondarily with cysteine 354 as well. We also attempted to construct a model for the A ring subsite of colchicine based on quantitative differences in the reactivity of 2CTC and 3CTC with the two cysteine residues and on the electron crystallographic model of tubulin (1Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar). Preparation of electrophoretically homogeneous bovine brain tubulin (10Hamel E. Lin C.M.

Radiopharm. 1992; 33: 293-299Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar) were described previously. Specific activity of the [14C]2CTC was 40 cpm/pmol. Decylagarose was from ICN Immunobiologicals; CNBr andN-ethylmaleimide were from Sigma; podophyllotoxin and formic acid were from Aldrich; “sequencing grade” trypsin and “sequencing grade” EP-GC (Staphylococcus aureus V8) were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; and precast Tricine-16% acrylamide polyacrylamide gels and PVDF membranes were from Novex. Kodak Biomax MR film was used for preparation of auto- radiographs. Reaction mixtures contained 25 μm(2.5 mg/ml) tubulin, 25 μm [14C]2CTC, podophyllotoxin as indicated, 1.0 m monosodium glutamate, 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 0.1 mm GDP, and 0.5 mm MgCl2. Incubation was for 30 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by addingN-ethylmaleimide to a final concentration of 5 mm. The mixture was left overnight at 4 °C, but precipitation of the tubulin was usually incomplete. The mixture was made 5% (v/v) in trichloroacetic acid, and, after an additional 30 min at 0 °C, the precipitated protein was harvested by centrifugation. The pellet was dissolved in a solution containing 4 mguanidine hydrochloride and 2 m NaCl (adjusted to pH 5.0 with HCl) and applied to a column of decylagarose (12Bai R. Lin C.M. Nguyen N.Y. Liu T.-Y. Hamel E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5606-5612Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Chromatography and analysis of protein peaks by SDS-PAGE was performed as described previously (5Bai R. Pei X.-F. Boyé O. Getahun Z. Grover S. Bekisz J. Nguyen N.Y. Brossi A. Hamel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12639-12645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Stoichiometry of [14C]2CTC associated with the β-tubulin peak was 0.17, and stoichiometry of that associated with the α-tubulin peak was 0.03. Only β-tubulin of least 90% purity was used in further studies, except in the podophyllotoxin inhibition study, in which unresolved tubulin was used. The [14C]2CTC-β-tubulin at 2.5 mg/ml was digested at 37 °C in the dark either with 75% formic acid for 96 h (13Landon M. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) or with CNBr (20 mg/ml) in 70% formic acid for 24 h. The formic acid and, if present, CNBr were removed by lyophilization, and the residue was washed twice with water, which was removed each time by lyophilization. For enzymatic digestions, the [14C]2CTC-β-tubulin was dissolved in 1.0 m Tris (pH 8.0 with HCl). The tubulin solutions were diluted 10-fold into 50 mm ammonium acetate (pH 4.0) for EP-GC or into water for trypsin, and the appropriate enzyme was added at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:50. The resulting reaction mixtures were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in the dark. At the end of the incubation, about 75% of the water in the samples was removed by lyophilization. Peptide separation was by SDS-PAGE on Novex precast gels, with the peptide solution to be analyzed dissolved in the Tricine-SDS sample buffer solution provided by Novex. Following electrophoresis, the separated peptides were transferred from the gel to a PVDF membrane (pore size, 0.2 μm) with an Enprotech semidry transblot system (1 h, 100 V). The membrane was stained with Coomassie Blue R250 and autoradiographed (24–72-h exposure). Radiolabeled peptides were cut from the membrane for sequencing. Automated Edman degradation for determination of amino acid sequence was performed with an Applied Biosystems model 494A Protein Sequenator. Identification of phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives was carried out with an Applied Biosystems model 140C Microgradient System and model 785A Programmable Absorbance Dectector. Identification of radiolabeled amino acid residues was performed by the University of Virginia Biomolecular Research Facility. Following each cycle of Edman degradation, the sample stream was analyzed by liquid scintillation counting for radiolabel instead of analyzed by HPLC to identify the derivatized amino acid residue. A two-stage modeling analysis was used, first to identify candidate binding sites on the tubulin dimer and, second, to dock the molecular structures of colchicinoids into these sites. The first procedure probes the Cαcoordinates of the tubulin dimer (1Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar) to determine exterior positions that are most likely to be found within a binding interface. This analysis uses information about local geometry and chemical composition of subregions of the target surface for selecting candidate sites. Relative rankings of these potential interaction sites are based on a scoring scheme derived from a statistical analysis of all known protein-ligand complexes. In applying this method to analysis of new crystal complexes, we have found that the correct ligand interface is found within the top 5% of candidate binding sites. 2D. Covell, unpublished data.

Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 717-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar. The second stage of the the analysis involves docking the test ligands at candidate binding sites. The initial docking is based exclusively on geometric considerations. This step uses a “geometric hashing technique” that has been found to rapidly determine a family of possible binding geometries for each ligand (17Covell D.G. Jernigan R.L. Wallqvist A. J. Mol. Struct. 1998; 423: 93-100Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Each of these possible binding arrangements is further refined to determine those positions with the maximum binding strength between ligand and target protein. A previously published model of ligand binding (18Wallqvist A. Jernigan R.L. Covell D.G. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1881-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) was used to select the best binding geometries. This model is based on the atomic preferences of adjacent surfaces buried within a binding interface (18Wallqvist A. Jernigan R.L. Covell D.G. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1881-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The model has been shown to predict accurately ligand binding strengths and assess the relative contributions of atomic interactions within a binding interface (17Covell D.G. Jernigan R.L. Wallqvist A. J. Mol. Struct. 1998; 423: 93-100Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Moreover, the model has been extended as an adjunct to computational docking (19Wallqvist A. Covell D.G. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1996; 25: 403-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), has proven effective for identifying ligands active against NCp7 targets (20Rice W.G. Turpin J.A.

The final stage of docking was obtained from successive in vacuo molecular dynamics and energy minimization calculations using the CVFF91 force field within Discover97.0 (Molecular Simulations, Inc., San Diego CA), based on the candidate geometries obtained from steps one and two, as outlined above. This final step resulted in small changes in geometries, both in the ligand and in the target protein, primarily to eliminate energetically unfavorable van der Waals interactions. These dynamics and minimization steps were performed repeatedly to achieve the final geometries. Exploration of these final geometries, which were used for our analysis, indicates trapping in a local energy minimum. The resulting geometries did not significantly alter the starting geometries of each ligand and were acceptable within the 3.6-Å resolution of the electron crystallographic structure of tubulin (1Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar). In our initial characterization of the interactions of 2CTC and 3CTC with tubulin (24Grover S. Boyé O. Getahun Z. Brossi A. Hamel E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1350-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), we found that these interactions were similar to that of colchicine with tubulin (slow, temperature-dependent binding; similar quantitative inhibitory effects on polymerization; similar binding stoichiometries), and both compounds were competitive inhibitors of the binding of [3H]colchicine to tubulin (apparent Kivalues of about 3 μm). Unlike colchicine, however, they formed a covalent bond with β-tubulin, and bond formation, as well as the initial binding reaction, was strongly inhibited by podophyllotoxin. The major difference between 2CTC and 3CTC was in the covalent reactions, which were studied most extensively with the compounds at 5 μm and tubulin at 20 μm. With 3CTC, the covalent reaction occurred almost simultaneously with binding, and about 57% of the bound drug formed a covalent bond with tubulin. With 2CTC, covalent bond formation was much slower than the binding reaction. After 30 min, about 26% and after 1 h 30% of the bound drug had covalently reacted with the tubulin. Finally, with superstoichiometric concentrations of both 2CTC and 3CTC the covalent reactions were more extensive, but there was a significant reduction in the apparent specificity of the covalent reactions (i.e. a smaller proportion of covalent bond formation was inhibited by podophyllotoxin). Because of the more extensive covalent reaction with 3CTC, we initially studied it in detail (5Bai R. Pei X.-F. Boyé O. Getahun Z. Grover S. Bekisz J. Nguyen N.Y. Brossi A. Hamel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12639-12645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), purifying the alkylated β-tubulin by decylagarose chromatography. Analysis of CNBr peptide digests resolved by HPLC were consistent with alkylation of Cys-354 and Cys-239 in roughly a 2:1 ratio, but formic acid peptide digests resolved by SDS-PAGE indicated a 9:1 ratio. In the studies presented here, we used 75% formic acid digestion for the initial analysis of [14C]2CTC-containing peptides. The primary cleavage site under the condition used is aspartylproline (13Landon M. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), and there are two such sites in β-tubulin (positions 31/32 and 304/305). Rao et al. (4Rao S. Krauss N.E. Heerding J.M. Swindell C.S. Ringel I. Orr G.A. Horwitz S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3132-3134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) termed the three resulting peptides A1 (residues 1–31), A2 (residues 32–304), and A3 (residues 305–445), and these peptides migrate as expected upon SDS-PAGE. In our hands, there are also secondary cleavage sites of β-tubulin in formic acid (5Bai R. Pei X.-F. Boyé O. Getahun Z. Grover S. Bekisz J. Nguyen N.Y. Brossi A. Hamel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12639-12645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), but the amino acid sequences of the less prominent bands suggested that secondary cleavage occurred subsequent to hydrolysis of the aspartylproline bonds (also see below). In an initial experiment with unresolved tubulin following its interaction with [14C]2CTC, we observed heavy labeling of both A2 and A3 by [14C]2CTC. Formation of both radiolabeled peptides was abolished in the presence of podophyllotoxin (data not presented), consistent with our previous observations (24Grover S. Boyé O. Getahun Z. Brossi A. Hamel E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1350-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus encouraged, we separated α- and β-tubulin on decylagarose following the reaction with [14C]2CTC prior to formic acid digestion. After formic acid treatment, the protein digest was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the peptides on the gel were electrotransferred to a PVDF membrane, which was stained and autoradiographed. Track I in Fig. 2 A shows the Coomassie Blue stain pattern obtained, with peptides A1, A2, and A3 indicated. Track II is the autoradiogram of the stained track I, showing the heavily labeled A2 and A3, with a number of minor radiolabeled bands between A2 and A3 and between A3 and A1. These presumptive assignments were confirmed by sequential Edman degradation for 15 cycles in the case of A2 and 10 cycles for A3 (Table I). In addition, sequence analysis was performed on minor radiolabeled bands running between A2 and A3 and between A3 and A1. In the former case, these were found to have the same amino-terminal sequence as A2 and, in the latter, the same amino-terminal sequence as A3 (data not presented). For comparison, we also include as track III in Fig. 2 A an autoradiogram of formic acid-digested β-tubulin following an identical incubation with [14C]3CTC. As previously (5Bai R. Pei X.-F. Boyé O.

Chem. 1996; 271: 12639-12645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), there was little radiolabel in A2, in contrast to the heavy radiolabel in A3 and A3 fragments. Densitometric analysis of gels II and III indicated that the ratio of A2 + fragments to A3 + fragments was about 0.7:1 following reaction with 2CTC and 0.1:1 following reaction with 3CTC (see Table II).Figure 1Structures of colchicine, thiocolchicine, 2CTC , and 3CTC.

To better define the two reactive amino acids following the covalent interaction of β-tubulin with [14C]2CTC, we next digested the decylagarose-isolated protein with CNBr, with subsequent PAGE and electrotransfer of the peptides to PVDF. An autoradiogram from a typical experiment is shown as track I in Fig. 2 B. Reproducibly, only two radiolabeled bands were observed, with the upper “peptide a” more heavily labeled than the lower “peptide b”. Sequential Edman degradation of peptides a and b yielded sequences consistent with CNBr-derived peptides spanning residues 234–257 (for 10 cycles) and 331–363 (17 cycles), respectively. The former peptide is entirely within the A2 peptide obtained with formic acid, and the latter is within the A3 peptide. We also reevaluated β-tubulin following its reaction with [14C]3CTC and CNBr digestion by the PAGE-electrotransfer methodology. A typical autoradiogram is shown as track II in Fig. 2 B. Note that the same two bands were radiolabeled with 3CTC as with 2CTC (confirmed by sequential Edman degradation; data not presented). The relative amounts of radiolabel in the a and b peptides in the two tracks shown in Fig. 2 B were 2:1 for the 2CTC sample and 0.4:1 for the 3CTC sample, as determined by densitometry (summarized in Table II). In our previous study, we had clearly established that the bound [14C]3CTC reacted primarily with Cys-354 of β-tubulin, but we had also obtained preliminary data consistent with a secondary reaction of bound 3CTC with Cys-239 (5Bai R. Pei X.-F. Boyé O. Getahun Z. Grover S. Bekisz J. Nguyen N.Y. Brossi A. Hamel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12639-12645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, the autoradiogram of the electroblot shown as track II in Fig. 2 B and the sequence data obtained from the peptide suggested that the secondary reaction was more substantial than we had previously thought. At the same time, the apparent identity of the CNBr peptides obtained from the [14C]3CTC-reacted β-tubulin and the [14C]2CTC-reacted β-tubulin strongly indicated that the two colchicine analogs alkylated the same cysteine residues in different proportions. The microsequencing Edman degradation procedure uses too little material for direct identification of the radiolabeled amino acid residue on peptides embedded in PVDF membranes (the degradation steps are performed directly on the membrane slice). In previous studies (5Bai R. Pei X.-F. Boyé O. Getahun Z. Grover S. Bekisz J. Nguyen N.Y. Brossi A. Hamel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1263"

Ca2+ waves mediated by inositol trisphosphate or ryanodine receptors propagate by Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release and therefore do not have an absolute requirement for a gradient in either inositol trisphosphate or cyclic ADP-ribose, respectively. In contrast, we report that although Ca2+ increases induced by nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) are amplified by Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release locally, Ca2+ waves mediated by NAADP have an absolute requirement for an NAADP gradient. If NAADP is increased such that its concentration is spatially uniform in one region of an egg, the Ca2+ increase occurs simultaneously throughout this area, and only where there is diffusion out of this area to establish an NAADP gradient is there a Ca2+ wave. A local increase in NAADP results in a Ca2+ increase that spreads by NAADP diffusion. NAADP diffusion is restricted at low but not high concentrations of NAADP, indicating that NAADP diffusion is strongly influenced by binding to immobile and saturable sites, probably the NAADP receptor itself. Thus, the range of action of NAADP can be tuned by its concentration from that of a local messenger, like Ca2+, to that of a global messenger, like IP3or cyclic ADP-ribose.

An increase in IP3 turns the cytoplasm into an excitable medium such that any increase in Ca2+ of sufficient magnitude is propagated as a regenerative Ca2+ wave (7Lechleiter J.D. Clapham D.E.

NAADP was originally shown to mobilize Ca2+ in the sea urchin egg (4Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol.

Uniquely, a pretreatment with a concentration of NAADP that does not release any Ca2+ can completely eliminate the response to a subsequent supramaximal concentration of NAADP (21Genazzani A.A.

This functional desensitization probably corresponds to irreversible binding of NAADP, suggesting that it occurs at the level of the NAADP receptor (22Aarhus R. Dickey D.M. Graeff R.M. Gee K.R.

In intact sea urchin eggs, the microinjection of NAADP has been shown to elicit a global regenerative Ca2+ wave (21Genazzani A.A. Empson R.M. Galione A. J. Biol.

We now report that the mechanism underlying NAADP-mediated Ca2+waves is fundamentally different from that of Ca2+ waves mediated by IP3 or ryanodine receptors. Specifically, global Ca2+ waves mediated by NAADP have an absolute requirement for an NAADP gradient. Nevertheless, functional coupling to either IP3 receptors or ryanodine receptors locally amplifies NAADP-mediated Ca2+ increases. At low concentrations NAADP is spatially restricted within a cell and acts as a local messenger, like Ca2+, whereas at high concentrations NAADP is more mobile and can act as a global messenger, like IP3 and cADPR. Sea urchin eggs of Lytechinus pictus were obtained by intracoelomic injection of 0.5 m KCl, shed into artificial sea water (in mm, NaCl 435, MgCl240, MgSO4 15, CaCl2 11, KCl 10, NaHCO3 2.5, EDTA 1), dejellied by passing through a 90-μm nylon mesh, and then washed twice. Eggs were transferred to polylysine-coated glass coverslips for microinjection and microscopy. Fluo-3 or Oregon Green 488 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) Dextran (Molecular Probes) was pressure-microinjected (Picospritzer, World Precision Instruments) to 50 or 10 μm, respectively, as estimated by comparison with a standard curve. The standard curve was prepared by imaging pipettes containing the dye at various known concentrations with free Ca2+ set at 100 nm by a 10 mmCa2+EGTA buffer. To ensure that solutions containing heparin or 8-amino-cADPR differed from the control solution by only the presence of the inhibitor(s), dried down aliquots of chelex-treated inhibitor solutions were solubilized in the control solution. The Ca2+-sensitive dye was imaged by laser-scanning confocal microscopy (TCS NT, Leica) using the 488-nm line of an argon ion laser for excitation, and the emission was long-pass filtered (515 nm) and detected with a photomultipler tube. Images were processed with the software NIH Image to create a self-ratio by dividing each image by an image acquired before stimulation to correct for any differences in path length and spatial differences in dye distribution. Caged NAADP (2′P-(1-(2-nitrophenyl)ethyl NAADP, Molecular Probes) was purified further by high pressure liquid chromatography to remove small amounts of contaminating free NAADP (24Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Gee K.R. Kestner T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4172-4178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), which can potently desensitize the NAADP response at concentrations less than those required for activating Ca2+ release (21Genazzani A.A. Empson R.M. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11599-11602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 22Aarhus R. Dickey D.M. Graeff R.M. Gee K.R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8513-8516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Caged NAADP and caged Ca2+ (2-nitrophenyl EGTA, Molecular Probes) were photolyzed with ultraviolet light (351- and 364-nm lines) from an argon ion laser (Enterprise Model 651, Coherent) that was directed into the scanning head by a quartz fiber optic cable. A shutter was placed in the light-path of the ultraviolet laser to control the position and duration of the photorelease. This resulted in a band of UV across the image with the position and width of the band being controllable. Although the absolute amount of compound photolyzed was unknown, the relative differences are proportional to the amount of UV delivered to the egg. The amount of UV was controlled by varying the intensity of the UV laser and neutral density filters. Intensity is expressed as either μW emitted from the objective lens or integrated UV illumination calculated as the product of power, neutral density attenuation, area illuminated, and number of frames. Where appropriate, data were subjected to analysis of variance with means separated by Fisher's least significant difference with probability set to 0.05. A regenerative Ca2+ wave shows a constant amplitude and velocity (7Lechleiter J.D. Clapham D.E. Cell. 1992; 69: 283-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 8Jaffe L.F. Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 736-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 9Parker I. Choi J. Yao Y. Cell Calcium. 1996; 20: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 25Yao Y. Parker I. J. Physiol. 1992; 458: 319-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), whereas a diffusive Ca2+wave shows a decrease in amplitude and velocity with time (26Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar). Photorelease of NAADP in a band at the edge of an egg resulted in an immediate increase in Ca2+ in this region, which then spread across the cell with a decrease in amplitude and velocity (Fig. 1 a, 25 μW UV). The spread of the Ca2+ increase appears diffusive, but this may have been due to insufficient NAADP being released to ignite a regenerative Ca2+ wave. To compare the amount of NAADP released among experiments, a UV dose was calculated. The normalized amplitude of the Ca2+ increase was proportional to the UV dose (Fig. 1 c), demonstrating that UV dose is a valid measure of the amount of NAADP released. When NAADP was photoreleased to a higher concentration, both the velocity and the amplitude of the response increased (Fig. 1 a, 50 μW UV) relative to the response to a lower concentration of NAADP (Fig. 1 a, 25 μW UV). Nevertheless, regardless of the amount of NAADP released, the velocity of the Ca2+ spread decreased with time (Fig. 1 b), as predicted for a process governed by diffusion. Moreover, the relationship between the position of the Ca2+increase versus time can be fit (r 2 = 0.99, 25 μW; r 2 = 0.94, 50 μW) to an equation that describes diffusion in three dimensions (Fig. 1 b), where distance = (6Dt)1/2and D is the diffusion coefficient (26Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar), providing quantitative evidence for a diffusive mechanism. For a non-regenerative Ca2+ wave the diffusion coefficient of the propagating molecule can be calculated directly from changes in the position of the wave front over time. Diffusion coefficients were obtained by fitting the diffusion equation to plots of distanceversus time, as shown in Fig. 1 b. The resulting diffusion coefficients varied with UV dose from approximately 50 to 150 μm2/s (Fig. 1 d). The estimate of the diffusion coefficient is based on diffusion in three dimensions. If it is based on diffusion in two dimensions or one dimension, the values are scaled larger by a factor of 1.5 or 3, respectively (26Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar), but the relative magnitude of the concentration dependence remains the same. The concentration dependence of the diffusion coefficient of NAADP is probably not due to metabolism of NAADP because its time constant for degradation in sea urchin homogenate is 118 min (27Wilson H.L. Galione A. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 837-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), which amounts to less than 1% degradation in 1 min. Rather, the concentration dependence suggests that NAADP diffusion is restricted by immobile buffers in the cytoplasm, as is the case for Ca2+ (28Allbritton N.L. Meyer T. Stryer L. Science. 1992; 258: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). The values of the calculated diffusion coefficient overlap with that for Ca2+ (approximately 100 μm2/s (28Allbritton N.L. Meyer T. Stryer L. Science. 1992; 258: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar) when free Ca2+ is 3 μm (the maximum reached during these experiments)). However, a local increase in Ca2+ of greater amplitude than the NAADP response remained highly localized (Fig. 1 d), demonstrating that the diffusion coefficient is for NAADP and not Ca2+. The EC50 of the UV dose is similar for both the amplitude of the Ca2+ increase (Fig. 1 c) and the value of the diffusion coefficient (Fig. 1 d), suggesting that the NAADP receptor itself is restricting NAADP diffusion. In conclusion, these experiments show that a local release of NAADP does not trigger a global regenerative Ca2+ wave propagated by CICR but rather results in a Ca2+ wave that spreads by NAADP diffusion. The dependence of spatial Ca2+ signaling on NAADP diffusion is strikingly similar to that reported recently for an agonist of the IP3 receptor, adenophostin (29Bird G.S.J. Takahashi M. Tanzawa K. Putney J.W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20643-20649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For adenophostin, the size of the Ca2+ signaling domain is dependent on adenophostin diffusion, which in turn is dependent on the concentration of adenophostin (29Bird G.S.J. Takahashi M. Tanzawa K. Putney J.W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20643-20649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The diffusion of adenophostin is both restricted and concentration-dependent because of the high affinity (∼1 nm) of adenophostin for the IP3 receptor (30Takahashi M. Tanzawa K. Takahashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 369-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of binding to its receptor on messenger diffusion should be much greater for NAADP than adenophostin because NAADP binding is irreversible (22Aarhus R. Dickey D.M. Graeff R.M. Gee K.R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8513-8516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). From a spatial perspective, we predict that the relative spread of an NAADP-mediated Ca2+ increase will be highly dependent on NAADP concentration. At low NAADP concentrations the receptors will be excess over free NAADP and bind most of the NAADP before it can diffuse, resulting in a localized spatial response. At high NAADP concentrations, however, the receptors will saturate and NAADP will be free to diffuse resulting in a more global spatial response. If NAADP-initiated Ca2+ waves are mediated by diffusion of NAADP, and NAADP diffusion is limited by endogenous and immobile buffers, then releasing NAADP slowly in part of an egg should limit the Ca2+ increase to that area of the egg. Only upon saturating the binding sites for NAADP would NAADP be able to diffuse and mediate the spread of the Ca2+ increase into other regions of the egg. To test this, we released NAADP with three periods of UV illumination in the same egg. The first photorelease of NAADP resulted in a Ca2+ increase that was mostly restricted to within the area of UV illumination (Fig. 2). Although the second photorelease of NAADP resulted in a larger Ca2+ increase, the Ca2+ increase was still mostly restricted to the area of UV illumination (Fig. 2). The third photorelease of NAADP was more prolonged, and although this resulted in only a slightly larger Ca2+ increase, this Ca2+ increase spread across the entire egg (Fig. 2). During the third photorelease the increase in Ca2+ was simultaneous in the three leftmost regions of interest in the area of irradiation and then transitioned into a regenerative-like spread through the rest of the egg with near constant velocity (3.6 μm/s) and amplitude (Fig. 2, rightmost plot). Propagation of the Ca2+ increase was primarily through the cortex, with the spread through the center of the egg arising from the collision of the two cortical Ca2+ waves. Even though the Ca2+ wave is propagated by NAADP diffusion, the wave does not decrease in velocity or amplitude because NAADP is continuously added to the other half of the egg. This result shows that a diffusive Ca2+ wave can resemble a regenerative Ca2+ wave when the concentration of NAADP is saturating as it diffuses throughout the egg.Figure 2NAADP-mediated Ca2+increases are spatially restricted at low but not high concentrations of NAADP. Within each row, the time between images is 3.4 s. The response to the third photorelease was used to create a plot of wave front position versus time. Each point corresponds to the time at which a region of interest in the cortex reached a ratio of 1.3. Other details are as described for Fig. 1. The points outside the UV zone are fitted to a straight line. The intracellular concentrations were: Oregon Green 488 BAPTA Dextran, 10 μm; caged NAADP, 0.5 μm. Data are representative of four similar experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It has been demonstrated previously that when intracellular IP3 is increased slowly by photorelease there is only a small increase in resting Ca2+ until a global Ca2+ wave is triggered, because the IP3 turns the cytoplasm into an excitable medium, and the resulting Ca2+ wave propagates by CICR (9Parker I. Choi J. Yao Y. Cell Calcium. 1996; 20: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 14Marchant J. Callamaras N. Parker I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5285-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 25Yao Y. Parker I. J. Physiol. 1992; 458: 319-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Because cADPR acts by sensitizing ryanodine receptors to CICR (13Galione A. Lee H.C. Busa W.B. Science. 1991; 253: 1143-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar), it should elicit a regenerative rather than diffusive Ca2+ wave similar to that induced by IP3 (9Parker I. Choi J. Yao Y. Cell Calcium. 1996; 20: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 14Marchant J. Callamaras N. Parker I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5285-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 25Yao Y. Parker I. J. Physiol. 1992; 458: 319-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To provide further evidence that NAADP-mediated Ca2+ waves are dependent on a non-regenerative diffusive mechanism, the responses of cADPR and NAADP were compared at their threshold concentrations for evoking Ca2+ release. The threshold was achieved by slowly increasing the messenger concentration with a low UV irradiation intensity applied for a long duration. As predicted, cADPR elicited only a small elevation in Ca2+(Fig. 3 a, arrow) until there was a rapid increase that propagated as a fast (14.7 ± 1.5 μm/s, n = 6) regenerative Ca2+wave throughout the irradiated area of the egg (Fig. 3, aand c). The decrease in Ca2+ wave amplitude in the center of the egg probably relates to spatial differences in sensitivity to Ca2+-releasing messengers, as discussed below; the important feature is the constant velocity throughout the irradiated area. This response is similar to that reported for IP3 when it was uncaged in half of a Xenopusoocyte because the resulting regenerative Ca2+ wave was limited to the half of the egg being irradiated (25Yao Y. Parker I. J. Physiol. 1992; 458: 319-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In both theXenopus oocyte (25Yao Y. Parker I. J. Physiol. 1992; 458: 319-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and the sea urchin egg (Fig. 3,a and c) the Ca2+ increase spread into the non-irradiated area, but this “spillover” is more noticeable in the sea urchin egg due to its smaller size (100 μmversus 1 mm). In contrast to the response to cADPR, low threshold concentrations of NAADP elicited a slowly spreading (1.4 ± 0.7 μm/s) Ca2+ increase that was graded with respect to both amplitude and distance traveled (Fig. 3, b andc). The direction of the Ca2+ wave is a precise reflection of the NAADP gradient but not of the cADPR gradient. The relatively slow spread of the NAADP-mediated Ca2+ increase is consistent with there being a gradient of NAADP resulting from restricted diffusion of NAADP. Indeed, continuous release of NAADP progressively overcame these effects and drove the NAADP gradient and Ca2+ increase across the entire egg (Fig. 3, band c). Both the Ca2+ increase and spread ceased if the UV irradiation stopped (similar to that shown in Fig. 2). In conclusion, these experiments show that cADPR mediates a regenerative Ca2+ wave propagated by CICR, whereas NAADP mediates a Ca2+ increase and spread that is governed by the diffusion and resulting gradient of NAADP. Regardless of whether NAADP or cADPR was photoreleased, the Ca2+ increase always initiates in the cortex (Fig. 3). Similarly, the responses to NAADP in Figs. 1 and 2 show that the Ca2+ increase initiated preferentially in, and then spread faster through, the cortex. These data suggest that the cortex is the area of the egg most sensitive to Ca2+-releasing messengers. Fertilization-induced Ca2+ waves also have been shown to propagate preferentially through the cortex at velocities greater than through the center of the egg (31Fontanilla R.A. Nuccitelli R. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 2079-2087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 32Stricker S.A. Dev. Biol. 1999; 211: 157-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). The origin of this differential regional sensitivity to NAADP is unknown but may relate to the differentially organized endoplasmic reticulum in the cortex (33Terasaki M. Jaffe L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) or the relative density of NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ release channels in the cortex, as demonstrated for the IP3 and ryanodine receptors (34Parys J.B. McPherson S.M. Mathews L. Campbell K.P. Longo F.J. Dev. Biol. 1994; 161: 466-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 35McPherson S.M. McPherson P.S. Mathews L. Campbell K.P. Longo F.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated previously that NAADP functionally interacts with other Ca2+ release pathways, possibly by CICR amplification (16Cancela J.M. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Nature. 1999; 398: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 36Santella L. Kyozuka K. Genazzani A.A. De Riso L. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8301-8306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To determine whether NAADP-mediated Ca2+ waves are amplified by coupling to IP3- and cADPR-sensitive Ca2+ release mechanisms, caged NAADP was photolyzed in eggs containing either heparin or 8-amino-cADPR (37Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) to block IP3- and cADPR-sensitive Ca2+ release mechanisms, respectively. In these experiments photorelease was restricted to approximately half of the egg so that the effects of the inhibitors could be determined simultaneously both in a region where NAADP was increasing uniformly and in a region where NAADP was forming a gradient by diffusion. As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, a continuous release of NAADP was required to push the Ca2+ increase across the entire egg (Fig. 4). Heparin (5 mg/ml) alone and 8-amino-cADPR (5 μm) alone decreased the amplitude of the Ca2+ increase, but neither inhibitor significantly affected any other Ca2+ wave parameter (Fig. 4, a and b). In contrast, when these inhibitors were present together, there was a 5-fold increase in latency, a 2-fold decrease in velocity, and a 2-fold increase in rise time (Fig. 4, a and b). As with the previous experiments, at no point was a regenerative Ca2+ wave triggered. From these data we conclude that during an NAADP-mediated Ca2+ increase, either the IP3- or cADPR-dependent pathway can provide amplification. Amplification could arise from either Ca2+-stimulated production of IP3 (38Swann K. Whitaker M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2333-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and cADPR, which would give rise to a regenerative response, or localized CICR. A regenerative Ca2+ wave was not triggered by an increase in Ca2+ alone (Fig. 1 d), indicating that amplification is probably due to local CICR. A necessary conclusion from this mechanism is that resting levels of IP3 and cADPR must be sufficiently elevated in resting eggs so that their target channels open in response to an increase in Ca2+. The redundancy of these two amplification pathways is similar to that reported previously for the Ca2+ wave that accompanies fertilization, which can propagate via either IP3 or ryanodine receptors (39Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Walseth T.F. Science. 1993; 261: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 40Galione A. McDougall A. Busa W.B. Willmott N. Gillot I. Whitaker M. Science. 1993; 261: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Functional coupling is not detected in sea urchin egg homogenates (4Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), suggesting that it is related to the architecture of the Ca2+ stores in the intact egg and is lost upon homogenization. The physical relationship between the NAADP-activated channels and the CICR channels might be analogous to that between the dihydropyridine receptors (Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane) and ryanodine receptors in cardiac cells (11Meissner G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 485-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). This arrangement enables precise delivery of extracellular Ca2+ directly to the ryanodine receptors, thereby activating them and amplifying the Ca2+ increase (11Meissner G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 485-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). A model showing how NAADP mediates spatial Ca2+signaling is presented in Fig. 5. A gradient in the concentration of NAADP defines the domain over which the wave propagates. The NAADP gradient could result from either local synthesis and diffusion of NAADP or locally different rates of NAADP synthesis to yield a phase wave. Functional coupling to either IP3 receptors or ryanodine receptors contributes to the amplitude of the Ca2+ increase, but the effect is spatially localized. Functional coupling has been reported between IP3 receptors and ryanodine receptors in both portal vein smooth muscle cells (41Boittin F.X. Coussin F. Marcrez N. Mironneau C. Mironneau J. Cell Calcium. 1998; 23: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and PC12 cells (42Koizumi S. Bootman M.D. Bobanovic L.K. Schell M.J. Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Neuron. 1999; 22: 125-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Both Ca2+ and NAADP could activate Ca2+ release from the clusters of channels, but unlike Ca2+, NAADP can diffuse between the clusters to coordinate a diffusive Ca2+ wave. The lower part of Fig. 5 shows how inhibition of amplification both reduces the Ca2+ increase and retards the position of the wave front, despite the fact that the two waves are dependent on the same underlying NAADP gradient. This is because it is not the NAADP concentration but the resulting Ca2+ increase that is monitored. The implication of the mechanism by which NAADP mediates spatial Ca2+ signaling is that NAADP can be tuned to be either a local or global messenger. In contrast, IP3 and cADPR are always global messengers (28Allbritton N.L. Meyer T. Stryer L. Science. 1992; 258: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar, 43Petersen O.H. J. Physiol. 1995; 89: 125-127Google Scholar), and Ca2+ is always a local messenger (28Allbritton N.L. Meyer T. Stryer L. Science. 1992; 258: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). A potentially important implication of diffusive NAADP-mediated Ca2+ waves is that they encode information such as the intensity of the originating signal, distance from the originating signal, and the direction of the signal. Uniquely, due to its ability to self-desensitize, this information could serve as a memory of the NAADP gradient such that past responses would affect subsequent responses. Although we are only now beginning to demonstrate a physiological role for NAADP in Ca2+ signaling (16Cancela J.M. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Nature. 1999; 398: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 44Albrieux M. Lee H.C. Villaz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14566-14574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we propose that the unique properties of NAADP may make it important in forming Ca2+ gradients such as those that may dictate cellular polarity and developmental patterning (3Jaffe L.F. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We thank F. Boittin, J. Cancela, B. Fruen, S. Patel, J. Thomas, and R. Webb for helpful discussion."

We show here that p38-MAPKs are activated upon stimulation by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) or cAMP. TSH caused the phosphorylation of p38-MAPK in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with the human TSH receptor but not in wild-type Chinese hamster ovary cells. The effect of TSH was fully mimicked by the adenylyl cyclase activator, forskolin, and by a permeant analog of cAMP. The effect of forskolin was reproduced in FRTL5 rat thyroid cells. TSH also stimulated the phosphorylation of MAPK kinase 3 or 6, over the same time scale as that of p38-MAPKs. TSH and forskolin stimulated the activity of the α-isoform of p38-MAPK assayed by phosphorylation of the transcription factor ATF2. The activity of MAPK-activated protein kinase-2 was stimulated by TSH and forskolin. This stimulation was abolished by SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38-MAPKs. The protein kinase A inhibitor H89 inhibited the stimulation of phosphorylation of p38-MAPKs by forskolin, whereas inhibitors of protein kinase C, p70S6k, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase were ineffective. Expression of the dominant negative form of Rac1, but not that of Ras, blocked forskolin-induced p38-MAPK activation. Diphenylene iodonium, a potent inhibitor of NADPH oxidase(s), and ascorbic acid, an effective free radical scavenger, suppressed TSH- or forskolin-stimulated p38-MAPK phosphorylation, indicating that the generation of reactive oxygen species plays a key role in signaling from cAMP to p38-MAPKs. Inhibition of the p38-MAPK pathway with SB203580 partially but significantly, attenuates cAMP- and TSH-induced expression of the sodium iodide symporter in FRTL-5 cells. These results point to a new signaling pathway for the Gs-coupled TSH receptor, involving cAMP, protein kinase A, Rac1, and reactive oxygen species and resulting in the activation of a signaling kinase cascade that includes MAPK kinase 3 or 6, p38-MAPK, and MAPK-activated protein kinase-2. p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38-MAPKs) are activated by cytokines, cellular stresses, growth factors, and hormones.

ERKs are preferentially activated in response to growth factors, cytokines, and mitogens, via the well known Ras/Raf-1/MEK pathway. JNKs and p38-MAPKs are activated in response to a variety of cell stresses, including UV irradiation, pro-inflammatory cytokines, protein synthesis inhibitors, osmotic shock, and chemical stress such as that induced by H2O2 and other reactive oxygen species. A variety of agonists acting on G protein-coupled receptors have also been shown to activate ERK, JNK, or p38-MAPK pathways (26Lopez-Ilasaca M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Heterogeneity exists in the mechanisms whereby G protein-coupled receptors activate MAP kinases. Much data suggest that the βγ subunits resulting from the dissociation of the heterotrimeric G proteins Gs, Gi/Go, or Gq/G11, can interact with effectors acting on the Ras-ERK pathway (27Faure M.

The receptor for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is a seven-transmembrane spanning receptor that is coupled to Gsand, in the human thyroid, to Gq/G11 (33Laugwitz K.L. Allgeier A. Offermanns S. Spicher K. Van Sande J. Dumont J.E. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Activation of Gs leads to the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase and activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). cAMP is a positive modulator of thyroid cell differentiation and proliferation. The direct activation of the cAMP pathway by forskolin, cholera toxin or cAMP analogs reproduces most of the effects of TSH (34Roger P.P. Hotimsky A. Moreau C. Dumont J.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1982; 26: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 35Tramontano D. Moses A.C. Veneziani B.M. Ingbar S.H. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In thyroid cells, TSH stimulates the expression of sodium iodide symporter (NIS) through the cAMP pathway (36Kogai T. Endo T. Saito T. Miyazaki A. Kawaguchi A. Onaya T. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2227-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), as well as that of other differentiation markers such as thyroperoxidase and thyroglobulin. However, the biochemical basis for the stimulatory effect of TSH and cAMP is not completely elucidated. Members of the CRE-binding (CREB) family of cAMP-responsive transcription factors are required but do not appear to be sufficient to fully mimic the cAMP-dependent DNA synthesis or the differentiated phenotype in thyroid cells (37Woloshin P.I. Walton K.M. Rehfuss R.P. Goodman R.H. Cone R.D. Mol Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1725-1733PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we examined whether TSH and cAMP activated p38-MAPK using CHO cells stably transfected with the human TSH receptor (hTSHR-CHO) (38Perret J. Ludgate M. Libert F. Gerard C. Dumont J.E. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Biochem. Cell Biol. Commun. 1990; 171: 1044-1050Google Scholar) and the thyroid FRTL-5 cell line. The latter retains most of the features of differentiated thyroid follicular cells, such as TSH-dependent growth and expression of differentiation markers. We find that TSH stimulates p38-MAPK activity in hTSHR-CHO cells. This activation is reproduced by cAMP in hTSHR-CHO cells and in FRTL-5 cells. Inhibition of the p38-MAPK pathway attenuates cAMP-induced expression of NIS. The activation of p38-MAPK is PKA-dependent and involves the small GTPase Rac1. TSH and cAMP also cause the activation of p38-MAPK through the generation of reactive oxygen species. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.

Serum was withdrawn from subconfluent cultures 48 h before stimulation with rhTSH. Wild-type CHO cells were cultured in the same conditions without geneticin. FRTL-5 cells (American Type Culture Collection CRL 8305) were grown in Coon's modified Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated FCS, bovine TSH (1 milliunit/ml), insulin (10 μg/ml), and transferrin (5 μg/ml). Serum and hormones were withdrawn from subconfluent cultures 48 h before stimulation.

The intracellular cAMP accumulation was determined according to Evans (41Evans T Smith M.M. Tanner L.I. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 26: 395-404PubMed Google Scholar). Transient transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent. Cells were incubated for 24 h in FCS medium after transfection and deprived of FCS for an additional 24 h before stimulation. Cell extracts were prepared in buffer A containing 80 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.4, 20 mm EGTA, 15 mm MgCl2, and a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (42Pomerance M. Thang M.N.

For immunoblotting with phospho-CREB or CREB antibodies, total cell lysates were prepared by scraping the cells into Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and the membranes were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin. The blots were probed overnight with the appropriate antibody. Antibody binding was revealed by ECL or by the alkaline phosphatase system. p38α-MAPK, HA-tagged p38α-MAPK and MAPKAP kinase-2 were immunoprecipitated from cell extracts containing 1% Triton X-100 by incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with 2 μg of polyclonal anti-p38-MAPK antibody (C20) or 5 μg of monoclonal anti-HA antibody or 3.6 μg of polyclonal anti-MAPKAP kinase-2 antibody, followed by an additional 1 h with protein G-Sepharose. The precipitates were washed twice with buffer A containing 1% Triton and three times with the appropriate kinase assay buffer (see below). RNA was extracted by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (43Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63148) Google Scholar) and analyzed by Northern blot as described previously (44Rachdaoui N. El Jamali A. Dib K. Correze C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 156: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Blots were hybridized with probes for NIS and GAPDH. The rat NIS cDNA probe was isolated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction with the following primers: sense (5′-CCTTCTGGACTTTCATAGTGGG-3′) and antisense (5′-TGGGACCAGTAAGGTAGCTGAT-3′) and cloned in pCR 2.1 TOPO vector (Invitrogen BV, Groningen, The Netherlands). The NH2-terminal domain of ATF2[1–109] was expressed as a glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein using the pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), purified, and used as a substrate. p38α-MAPK or HA-tagged p38-MAPK were assayed by incubating immunoprecipitates with GST-ATF2[1–109] for 20 min at 30 °C in kinase assay buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmNa3VO4, plus 40 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were stopped by adding Laemmli sample buffer. Phosphorylated products were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The radioactivity incorporated into GST-ATF2 was counted by liquid scintillation. MAPKAP kinase-2 was assayed by incubating immunoprecipitates with 0.125 mm of synthetic peptide (KKLNRTLSVA) substrate for 30 min at 30 °C in kinase assay buffer containing 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 9 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, plus 60 μmATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were stopped by centrifugation, and 25-μl aliquots of the supernatant were spotted on p81 phosphocellulose squares. These were washed in 0.75% H3PO4, and the radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation. The intracellular production of cAMP was measured as a function of rhTSH concentration in hTSHR-CHO and wild-type CHO cells. As expected, rhTSH stimulated cAMP production (20-fold) in cells expressing TSH receptors in a dose-dependent manner (ED50 = ∼0.1 milliunit/ml), but not in wild-type CHO cells (not shown). The involvement of p38-MAPK in the response to TSH was determined by incubating hTSHR-CHO cells and wild-type CHO cells with rhTSH. The phosphorylation of p38-MAPK was analyzed as a function of incubation time by immunoblotting using a specific anti-phospho-p38-MAPK antibody. rhTSH (1 milliunit/ml) stimulated the phosphorylation of p38-MAPK in a time-dependent manner in hTSHR-CHO cells (Fig. 1 A) but not in wild-type CHO cells (Fig. 1 B). p38-MAPK phosphorylation occurred after incubation for 20 min and reached a maximum at 60–90 min. The activator of stress-activated protein kinases, anisomycin, stimulated p38-MAPK phosphorylation in both cell types. The same nitrocellulose membranes were probed with an antibody for p38α-MAPK (Fig. 1,A and B, lower panels), showing that the amount of p38α-MAPK remained constant with time. Fig. 1 C shows that incubation of hTSHR-CHO cells for 60 min with increasing concentrations of rhTSH resulted in a dose-dependent phosphorylation of p38-MAPK (ED50 = 0.2 milliunit/ml). When hTSHR-CHO cells were incubated with 10 μm forskolin, a direct activator of adenylyl cyclase, the phosphorylation of p38-MAPK was stimulated with a time course similar to that of TSH (Fig. 2 A). Dideoxyforskolin (10 μm), a structural analog of forskolin that does not activate adenylyl cyclase, did not promote the phosphorylation of p38-MAPK. A permeant analog of cAMP, 8-bromo-cyclic AMP (0.5 mm), stimulated phosphorylation of p38-MAPK (Fig. 2 B). We also determined whether forskolin induced the phosphorylation of p38-MAPK in FRTL-5 cells. p38 MAPK phosphorylation was stimulated by forskolin (10 μm) in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2 C). The time course of stimulation was similar to that in hTSHR-CHO cells, with the maximum effect being obtained at 60 min. hTSHR-CHO cells were incubated with 5 μmof the protein kinase C inhibitor GF109203X for 1 h and then stimulated with TSH. The inhibitor had no effect on the TSH-induced phosphorylation of p38-MAPK (not shown). hTSHR-CHO cells were incubated with the PKA inhibitor H89 for 1 h and then stimulated with forskolin to determine whether PKA was involved in the cascade of p38-MAPK activation. p38-MAPK phosphorylation was inhibited by 10 and 20 μm H89 (Fig. 3 A). CREB phosphorylation was also inhibited by the same concentrations of H89 (Fig. 3 B). Blots were reprobed with antibodies against p38α-MAPK or CREB as a measure of protein loading (lower panels). The effect of H89 on EGF-induced phosphorylation of p38-MAPK was studied to check the specificity of H89. ER22 cells were chosen for this study because neither CHO cells nor FRTL-5 cells expressed EGF receptor. EGF (100 ng/ml) stimulated p38-MAPK phosphorylation by 2–3-fold, and H89 (5, 10 and 20 μm) did not inhibit this stimulation (not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that PKA is involved in the cAMP signaling pathway leading to p38-MAPK phosphorylation. We checked whether the phosphorylation of p38-MAPK resulted in an increase of its activity. hTSHR-CHO cells were incubated with rhTSH, forskolin, or anisomycin, the p38-MAPK was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts with an antibody against the α-isoform of p38-MAPK, and its activity was assayed using GST-ATF2 as a substrate (Fig. 4). The p38α-MAPK activity was increased 5-fold by rhTSH and 3-fold by forskolin. These increased kinase activities were similar to that obtained with anisomycin (5-fold). TSH stimulation was completely abolished by incubating the cells with SB203580. The activity of MAPKAP kinase-2, a substrate of p38-MAPK (14Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar) was measured in hTSHR-CHO cells treated with TSH or forskolin. MAPKAP kinase-2 was immunoprecipitated from untreated cells and from cells treated with rhTSH, forskolin, or anisomycin, and its activity was assayed using a synthetic peptide. Stimulation with TSH or forskolin led to a ∼5-fold increase in MAPKAP kinase-2 activity, similar to that obtained with anisomycin (Fig. 5). This stimulation is consistent with the activation of p38-MAPK obtained with TSH and forskolin. As expected, the MAPKAP kinase-2 activity stimulated by TSH was completely inhibited by incubating the cells with SB203580, confirming that the stimulation of MAPKAP kinase-2 activity was p38-MAPK-mediated. It has been reported that MAPKAP kinase-2 phosphorylates CREB in response to fibroblast growth factor in neuroblastoma cells (45Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether p38-MAPK was involved in TSH- or forskolin-induced CREB phosphorylation in hTSHR-CHO cells and in FRTL-5 cells. Cells were treated with forskolin in the presence and absence of SB203580, and CREB phosphorylation was analyzed by immunoblotting using a specific anti-phospho-CREB antibody. TableI shows that the inhibitor was without significant effect on forskolin-induced CREB phosphorylation in both cell types. Similar results were obtained with hTSHR-CHO cells stimulated by TSH (not shown).Table ISB203580 has no effect on Fk-stimulated phosphorylation of CREBTimeP-CREB/CREBhTSHR-CHO cellsFRTL-5 cells−SB+SB−SB+SB(min)102.24 (1)2.08 (1)1.86 ± 0.45 (6)1.81 ± 0.54 (6)202.11 ± 0.68 (5)2.61 ± 0.64 (5)1.95 ± 0.57 (6)1.98 ± 0.60 (6)602.38 ± 0.74 (6)2.42 ± 0.73 (6)1.61 ± 0.39 (5)1.60 ± 0.46 (5)hTSHR-CHO cells and FRTL-5 cells were treated (+SB) or not (−SB) with 20 μm SB203580 for 30 min, and then cells were treated with 10 μm forskolin for the indicated times.

We examined the possible involvement of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or/and p70S6k in TSH-induced p38-MAPK phosphorylation. hTSHR-CHO cells were incubated with 100 nm wortmannin for 30 min and then incubated with rhTSH. The drug had no effect on TSH-induced p38-MAPK phosphorylation (not shown). Incubation of hTSHR-CHO cells with 20 ng/ml rapamycin for 30 min had no effect on TSH-induced p38-MAPK phosphorylation (not shown). We also examined whether TSH activated the kinases MKK3 and MKK6 using an antibody against their phosphorylated forms. rhTSH (1 milliunit/ml) stimulated the phosphorylation of MKK3 and/or MKK6 in a time-dependent manner, consistent with the time course of p38-MAPK activation (Fig. 6 A). To determine whether TSH and forskolin activated p38-MAPK by a mechanism implicating Rac1 or Ras, hTSHR-CHO cells and FRTL-5 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding HA-tagged p38-MAPK with or without plasmids encoding the dominant negative forms of Myc-tagged Rac1 (Rac1N17) or HA-tagged Ras (RasN17). HA-tagged p38-MAPK was immunoprecipitated using an anti-HA tag antibody, and p38-MAPK activity was assayed using GST-ATF2 as a substrate. Forskolin stimulated HA-tagged p38-MAPK activity in hTSHR-CHO cells 2.7–3.5-fold, depending on the cotransfected empty vector (Fig. 6 B). This stimulation was completely abolished by transfection with Rac1N17, whereas no significant effect was observed by transfection with RasN17. Rac1N17 inhibited also p38-MAPK activity in FRTL-5 cells. Western blots of the cell lysates were performed using anti-tag (HA or Myc) antibodies as a control for protein expression. These data indicate that Rac1 is involved in the pathway leading to p38-MAPK activation. We investigated the molecular mechanisms leading to activation of p38-MAPK by examining the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in its activation. hTSHR-CHO cells were treated with 250 μm H2O2, and the time course of p38-MAPK phosphorylation was followed to assess the effect of H2O2 on p38-MAPK.

These data indicate that p38-MAPK in hTSHR-CHO cells can be regulated by a redox-sensitive mechanism. Therefore, hTSHR-CHO cells were incubated with DPI, a potent inhibitor of flavonoid-containing enzymes, such as NADPH oxidase and nitric-oxide synthase, or with two antioxidants, N-acetylcysteine and ascorbic acid.

Recently, bovine papillomavirus E1 was shown to be post-translationally modified by the addition of the SUMO-1 polypeptide. Here we show that the site of sumoylation maps to lysine residue 514. This lysine and the flanking sequences are well conserved in human papillomavirus (HPV) E1 proteins. Both HPV1a and HPV18 E1 proteins are substrates for sumoylation in vitro, which is consistent with this modification being a general property of E1 proteins. Mutations, which impair the sumoylation of bovine papillomavirus E1, prevent normal nuclear accumulation of E1 with a concomitant loss of replication capacity. These results suggest that sumoylation plays a role in nuclear transport and could regulate the E1 replication function by controlling access to the nuclear replication domains.

Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fundamental Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA1996: 947-978Google Scholar). E1 and E2 proteins are the only two viral proteins required to replicate the viral genome in vivo, whereas the rest of the replication machinery is provided by the host cell (2Melendy T. Sedman J. Stenlund A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7857-7867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ustav M. Stenlund A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). E1 is a DNA helicase that binds to specific sequences in the viral origin and unwinds the viral DNA for initiation of replication (4Wilson V.G. Ludes-Meyers J. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5314-5322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Yang L. Mohr I. Fouts E. Lim D.A. Nohaile M. Botchan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Clertant P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3201-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the interaction of E1 with E2 protein promotes specific binding and assembly of E1 protein on the viral origin to form an active initiation complex (7Seo Y.-S. Müller F. Lusky M. Gibbs E.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7044-7055Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Additional functions of E1 include recruiting cellular replication factors, such as the DNA polymerase α and replication protein A (9Bonne-Andrea C. Santucci S. Clertant P. Tillier F. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2341-2350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Park P. Copeland W. Yang L. Wang T. Botchan M.R. Mohr I.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

E1 also interacts with histone H1 (12Swindle C.S. Engler J.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1994-2001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and SW1/SNF5 (13Lee D. Sohn H. Kalpana G.V. Choe J. Nature. 1999; 399: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar), suggesting that E1 plays a role in chromatin remodeling at the viral origin. Recently, we demonstrated that BPV E1 protein is post-translationally modified by a novel process known as sumoylation (14Rangasamy D. Wilson V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30487-30495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Sumoylation involves the covalent attachment of the small ubiquitin-related proteins (SUMO-1, -2, or -3) to target substrates (15Saitoh H. Hinchey J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6252-6258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Sumoylation is achieved by a multistep process in a manner that is analogous to ubiquitinylation (reviewed in Ref. 16Yeh E.T.H. Gong L.M. Kamitani T. Gene (Amst. ). 2000; 248: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). SUMO is first activated by a heterodimeric enzyme termed Aos1/Uba2, and then the activated SUMO is covalently transferred to the SUMO-specific conjugating enzyme Ubc9 via a thioester linkage (17Desterro J.M.P. Rodriguez M.S. Kemp G.D. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10618-10624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Ubc9 physically interacts with various substrates and transfers SUMO to one or more lysine residues in the target protein. Unlike ubiquitinylation in which the primary function is targeting proteins for degradation, the effects of sumoylation are more substrate-specific and can result in alterations in function (18Gostissa M.

Wilson V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30487-30495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As BPV E1 is the first known viral replicator modified by SUMO-1, the biochemical and functional characterizations of the SUMO-conjugated E1 protein are likely to provide a paradigm for other viral and/or cellular replicative proteins. To further understand the role of E1 sumoylation, this study identified the major SUMO-1 attachment site in the BPV E1 protein and evaluated the functional properties of mutants defective in sumoylation. E1 mutants defective in Ubc9 interaction or lacking the SUMO-1 attachment lysine all demonstrated impaired replication as a consequence of defective nuclear localization. Furthermore, two HPV E1 proteins were also shown to be substrates for sumoylation in vitro, suggesting that this is a general feature of E1 proteins. Thus, the covalent modification of E1 proteins by SUMO-1 represents a potential novel mechanism to regulate E1 replication activity by controlling entry into the nucleus. Monoclonal anti-SUMO-1 antibody (21C7) was purchased from Zymed Laboratories, Inc. (South San Francisco, CA), and the rabbit polyclonal anti-E1 antibody was raised against amino acids 2–75 of BPV E1 (26Wilson V.G. Ludes-Meyers J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1129: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Vectors for in vitro translation of full-length and truncated forms of BPV E1 and vectors for HPV1a E1 and HPV18 E1 were described previously (14Rangasamy D. Wilson V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30487-30495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 27Gopalakrishnan V. Khan S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For in vivo experiments, NH2-terminally His-tagged E1 was expressed from pcDNA4/MAX (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), untagged E1 was expressed from pCGE1 (29Ustav M. Ustav E. Szymanski P. Stenlund A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4321-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) for replication assays, and GFP-E1 was expressed from pEGFP-C2 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). All site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the mutant plasmids were fully sequenced to exclude the possibility of second site mutations. Human SUMO-1 and the Ubc9 expression vectors were described previously (14Rangasamy D. Wilson V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30487-30495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Vectors and procedures for the two-hybrid experiments were reported by Rangasamy and Wilson (14Rangasamy D. Wilson V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30487-30495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). His-tagged SUMO-1 and glutathioneS-transferase-Ubc9 were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified as described by Gonzalez et al. (30Gonzalez A. Bazaldua-Hernandez C. West M. Woytek K. Wilson V.G. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). As a source of the SUMO-activating enzyme, protein extracts were prepared from confluent NIH 3T3 cells as described by Schwarz et al. (31Schwarz S.E. Matuschewski K. Liakopoulos D. Scheffner M. Jentsch S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). An extract prepared from ten 100-mm plates of cells was loaded on a 1-ml Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. Bound protein was eluted with 400 mm NaCl equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, concentrated with a Centricon-30, and used in thein vitro sumoylation assay. The in vitro SUMO-1 conjugation assay was carried out as described recently (14Rangasamy D. Wilson V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30487-30495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) except that the HeLa cell extract was replaced with the partially purified SUMO-activating enzyme. 2 μl of in vitro translated E1 protein were incubated with 20 μg of the Q-Sepharose fraction (as noted earlier) containing SUMO-1-activating enzymes Aos1/Uba2, 7 μg of purified SUMO-1, and 1 μg of Ubc9 in a 20-μl reaction with an ATP regenerating buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 3 units/ml creatine kinase, and 1 unit/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase). After 2 h at 30 °C, reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-sample buffer and heated at 70 °C for 4 min. Reaction products were analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and radioactively labeled bands were visualized and quantitated with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). COS-1 cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.1% non-essential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.) were transfected with LipofectAMINE PLUS reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). A total of 10 μg of plasmid DNA consisting of 4 μg of the His6-E1 vector encoding wild-type or mutant E1 proteins, 4 μg of the SUMO-1 vector, and 2 μg of the Ubc9 vector were co-transfected into 1 × 107 cells in 75-cm2 flasks. Control transfections used 4 μg of the His6-E1 plus 6 μg of the empty pcDNA 3.1 vector. 36 h after transfection, the COS-1 cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated as described previously using 5 μg of anti-E1 antibody (14Rangasamy D. Wilson V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30487-30495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Alternatively, E1 in the extracts was purified on nickel-affinity columns (Qiagen) as specified by the manufacturer. Immunoprecipitates and column eluates were subjected to SDS-8% polyacrylamide gels, and the proteins were transferred to a nylon membrane. Western blotting was performed following standard procedures with anti-E1 and anti-SUMO-1 antibodies. The proteins were detected using a chemiluminescence reagent, Super Signal Dura (Pierce). Approximately 1.4 × 106 Chinese hamster ovary cells were seeded into 60-mm dishes the day before transfection. The cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE PLUS reagents and had received 0.1 μg of pCGE2 (3Ustav M. Stenlund A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), 1 μg of pBOR (BPV origin in pUC19) (32Holt S.E. Wilson V.G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6525-6532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or pUC19 (nonorigin), and 1 μg of the respective pCGE1 expressing wild-type or mutant E1 proteins. After transfection, cells were trypsinized, and an equal number of cells was seeded into three 60-mm dishes. The cells were lysed at various times post-transfection, and the samples were digested for at least 16 h with a mixture of 15 units each ofDpnI and HindIII and 16 μg of RNase A. After digestion, Southern blots were performed according to standard procedures with radiolabeled pBOR DNA, and the blots were visualized and quantitated with a PhosphorImager. COS-1 cells were grown on four-well chamber slides (Nunc, Naperville, Ill), and 0.5 × 104cells/chamber were transfected with 250 ng of pGFP-E1 (either wild-type or mutant E1) DNA using LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent. After 24 h, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min at room temperature. The fixed cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and mounted in 90% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1%p-phenylenediamine. GFP was visualized on a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope combined with an Ultima Z confocal laser microscope with an oil immersion × 40 objective lens and appropriate filter. For E1 protein quantification, 1 × 105 cells were seeded onto 16-well tissue culture plates and transfected with 1 μg of either wild-type or mutant pGFP-E1. Transfected cells were directly lysed with SDS-sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-E1 antibody as noted earlier. The BPV E1 protein interacts with the Ubc9-conjugating enzyme and is modified by the addition of SUMO-1 both in vitro and in vivo(14Rangasamy D. Wilson V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30487-30495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As there are reports that some sumoylated proteins interact directly with SUMO-1 in the absence of Ubc9 (33Boddy M.N. Howe K. Etkin L.D. Solomon E. Freemont P.S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 971-982PubMed Google Scholar, 34Kawabe Y. Seki M. Seki T. Wang W.-S. Imamura O. Furuichi Y. Saitoh H. Enomoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20963-20966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), we examined the ability of E1 to interact with SUMO-1 in the same manner. However, in the two-hybrid assay the interaction of E1 and SUMO-1 was modest compared with E1/Ubc9 or Ubc9/SUMO-1 (Fig.1 A). Furthermore, we could not detect an E1·SUMO-1 complex in vitro using a glutathione S-transferase pulldown assay (data not shown). Based on these observations, we believe it is unlikely that SUMO-1 interacts directly with E1. The apparent interaction in the two-hybrid system probably represents a low level of covalent attachment of SUMO-1 to E1 protein via the endogenous yeast homolog of hUbc9 (31Schwarz S.E. Matuschewski K. Liakopoulos D. Scheffner M. Jentsch S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) rather than a noncovalent association. Our previous in vitro assay for E1 sumoylation used a crude HeLa cell extract as a source of SUMO-1-activating enzymes, but independent extracts were variable in activity perhaps because of different ratios of activating to desumoylating enzymes. To provide a more defined system for additional studies, a partially purified activating enzyme complex (31Schwarz S.E. Matuschewski K. Liakopoulos D. Scheffner M. Jentsch S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) was used in the current studies. The two most prominent products of the purification were proteins with apparent molecular masses of 40 and 90 kDa, consistent with the subunit sizes of the heterodimeric Aos1/Uba2 (Fig. 1 B). As noted before, sumoylation of E1 required the addition of SUMO-1 and Ubc9 as well as the activating enzyme component (Fig. 1 C), confirming that an authentic sumoylation process had been recapitulated. The presence of a single SUMO-1-modified species of E1 in vitro and the apparent molecular mass of this sumoylated E1 form are consistent with the addition of a single SUMO-1 moiety. To map the region of the E1 protein where SUMO-1 is conjugated, truncated forms of E1 protein were evaluated for sumoylation capacity in vitro (Fig.2 A). Truncations containing the NH2-terminal 312 or 459 amino acids of E1 were incapable of being sumoylated. In contrast, the COOH-terminal portion of E1 from residues 315 to 605 was effectively sumoylated, indicating that the COOH terminus of E1 contains all the information necessary for E1 to be recognized by the SUMO-1 conjugation system. Because E11–459 interacts effectively with Ubc9 (14Rangasamy D. Wilson V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30487-30495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), its inability to be sumoylated suggests that the actual site of addition is downstream between residues 460 and 605. A short consensus sequence (L/I)KXE has been described, which accounts for the SUMO-1 acceptor site in most of the known SUMO-1 substrates (reviewed in Ref. 16Yeh E.T.H. Gong L.M. Kamitani T. Gene (Amst. ). 2000; 248: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The BPV E1 sequence was searched for lysines present in this consensus or close matches, and four lysines were identified as possible sumoylation sites: Lys-89, Lys-155, Lys-288, and Lys-514. Whereas only Lys-514 was consistent with our truncation mapping data, each of the four residues was mutated independently in the context of full-length E1, and the mutant proteins were tested for in vitro sumoylation (Fig. 2 B). The E1 protein containing the conservative K514R substitution was unable to be sumoylated. In contrast, no effect on sumoylation was observed with mutations at Lys-89, Lys-155, or Lys-288. Thus, lysine 514 is most probably the residue where SUMO-1 attachment occurs, confirming the importance of this region identified by the truncation analysis. The similarity between this region of E1 and two other known sumoylation sites is shown in Fig. 2 D. In a previous study (14Rangasamy D. Wilson V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30487-30495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), we reported that the Leu-Lys motif at positions 420 and 421 of the E1 protein is critical for Ubc9 binding and that mutation of this motif drastically impairs the ability of E1 to bind Ubc9 protein. The inability to interact effectively with Ubc9 should eliminate or reduce sumoylation, and this was tested in thein vitro assay (Fig. 2 C). No sumoylation of the L420P/K421A double mutant was detectable, whereas the L420I/K421A mutant was weakly sumoylated to approximately 10–20% of the wild-type level. The residual sumoylation of the Ile-Ala mutant probably reflects a slight retention of Ubc9 interaction ability because of the more conservative amino acid substitutions. In contrast, the Pro-Ala mutant probably disrupts not only critical contact residues but also is more likely to alter the overall secondary structure of this region, resulting in complete loss of Ubc9 binding. A previous study on human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) E1 reported an interaction with Ubc9 in a yeast two-hybrid system, but no data were presented concerning sumoylation (35Yasugi T. Benson J.D. Sakai H. Vidal M. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 891-899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Examination of 30 HPV E1 protein sequences chosen at random (data not shown) revealed that 86% maintained a lysine at the position equivalent to BPV E1 residue 514 and that all retained theXPXL motif COOH-terminal to the lysine position (see motif in Fig. 2 D). To confirm that other E1 proteins can undergo SUMO-1 modification, we tested two different HPV E1 proteins in the in vitro conjugation assay (Fig.3). A truncated p53 protein (amino acids 72–390) (18Gostissa M. Hengstermann A. Fogal V. Sandy P. Schwarz S.E. Scheffner M. Del Sal G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6462-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) and BPV E1 were used as the positive controls for SUMO-1 modification. Incubation of both HPV1a E1 and HPV18 E1 with the complete sumoylation reaction resulted in the appearance of a higher molecular weight species that was consistent with the addition of SUMO-1. Sumoylation of both cutaneous and mucosal type HPV E1 proteins is consistent with this post-translational modification being a common feature of E1 proteins.Figure 1Interaction of E1 with the sumoylation machinery in vivo and in vitro.

E1 was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by Western blotting with both anti-E1 and anti-SUMO-1 antibodies to determine the extent of sumoylation. As previously reported (14Rangasamy D. Wilson V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30487-30495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), two species of wild-type E1 were detected with anti-E1, a major form at ∼82 kDa corresponding to full-length E1 and a minor form at ∼102 kDa (Fig.4, upper panel). Reprobing the blot with anti-SUMO-1 confirmed that this minor band contained SUMO-1. Consistent with the in vitro results, neither the L420P/K421A mutant nor the K514R mutant was sumoylated in vivo. In addition, sumoylated E1 was not detected for the L420I/K421A mutant. However, since the E1 L420I/K421A mutant protein was poorly sumoylated in vitro, it is likely that similar low levels of sumoylation in vivo were below our detection limit. As an alternative approach to immunoprecipitation, these experiments were repeated using nickel-affinity chromatography for the recovery of E1 because the E1 expression vectors used in Fig. 4produced His-tagged E1. The results obtained were identical to the immunoprecipitation data, and sumoylation of the L420I/K421A mutant was still not detected (data not shown). To obtain insight into the biological role of SUMO-1 modification of E1, we used a triple plasmid in vivoreplication assay to compare the replication activity of wild-type E1 with the replication activity of the Ubc9-binding deficient mutants and two different substitution mutants at the Lys-514 SUMO-1 conjugation site (Fig. 5 A). The E1 L420I/K421A mutant exhibited a 60% reduction in replication activity, whereas the mutant E1 L420P/K421A was completely unable to support the replication of the origin plasmid. Similarly, neither of the E1 proteins with substitutions at the sumoylation site was able to support any detectable replication activity. These replication defects were not attributable to decreased intracellular levels of the mutant proteins because all were expressed at comparable amounts (Fig. 5 B, data not shown) (14Rangasamy D. Wilson V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30487-30495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, compared with wild-type E1, mutants with defective sumoylation were significantly impaired for replication function. It was recently shown that the sumoylation of PML correlates with the formation of nuclear bodies (25Zhong S. Muller S. Ronchetti S. Freemont P.S. Dejean A. Pandolfi P.P.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar), whereas the conjugation of SUMO-1 to RanGAP1 is important for its targeting to the nuclear pore complexes (23Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar, 24Mahajan R. Gerace L. Melchior F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether sumoylation might influence the subcellular localization of E1 protein. To address this question, wild-type and mutant GFP-E1 fusion constructs were expressed in COS-1 cells, and the distribution of expressed E1 was analyzed by fluorescence confocal microscopy. In wild-type GFP-E1 transfected cells, E1 accumulated in intranuclear foci or speckles in addition to a diffuse nucleoplasmic distribution with little or no cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 6,A and B). In contrast, the Ubc9-binding, defective E1 mutants, L420P/K421A and L420I/K421A, exhibited predominantly cytoplasmic distribution (Fig. 6, C-F); a strong cytoplasmic signal was detected in at least 70% of the cells, and for L420P/K421A, the remaining cells exhibited diffuse nuclear staining either without any speckles or with a small number of clumps around the nuclear periphery. For GFP-E1 L420I/K421A, there was a punctate accumulation of E1 within the nucleus in less than 20% of the cells; however, the number and size of the speckles were less than those observed for wild-type E1, and the majority of E1 was still found in the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear rim (Fig. 6, C andD). Likewise, the SUMO-1 site-defective mutant E1 K514R was unable to localize to the nucleus and, instead, primarily accumulated in the cytoplasmic region of the nuclear rim (Fig. 6, G andH). Consistent with the Western blot data (Fig. 5), the amounts of mutant E1 proteins detected by fluorescence did not appear to be significantly different from wild-type E1, so it is unlikely that this factor accounts for the altered intracellular distributions. Thus, the difference in the accumulation patterns demonstrates that SUMO-1 modification of E1 protein is required for proper localization of E1 within the nucleus. The intermediate phenotype of the L420I/K421A mutant probably reflects a modest residual ability to interact with Ubc9, leading to a low level of sumoylation and subsequent deposition in the nucleus. BPV E1 is a multifunctional nuclear protein that is essential for viral DNA replication. E1 specifically interacts with the host cell enzyme Ubc9, leading to post-translation modification of E1 by the addition of a SUMO-1 moiety (14Rangasamy D. Wilson V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30487-30495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The data presented here extend this observation by identifying the site of SUMO-1 addition and by evaluating the functional effects of sumoylation. Similar to many other SUMO-1 substrates (16Yeh E.T.H. Gong L.M. Kamitani T. Gene (Amst. ). 2000; 248: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), BPV E1 is modified by the addition of SUMO-1 to a single lysine residue 514. Substitution mutation of this target lysine residue totally abolished E1 sumoylation in vitro andin vivo. Consistent with the high conservation among HPV E1 proteins of BPV E1 lysine 514 and its flanking sequences, HPV1a and HPV18 E1 proteins were sumoylated in vitro. Although the actual site of sumoylation in the HPV E1 proteins has not yet been determined, these results imply that sumoylation will be a general feature of E1 proteins. Interestingly, the SUMO-1 conjugation site of E1 lacks the glutamic acid residue typically found at two residues COOH-terminal to the target lysine (16Yeh E.T.H. Gong L.M. Kamitani T. Gene (Amst. ). 2000; 248: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Instead, this position is a proline followed by another proline and then by two leucines. This KXPXLL motif is also present in one of the sumoylation sites of PML and may represent an alternative recognition motif for SUMO-1 conjugation. Sumoylation appears to be a novel post-translational regulatory mechanism capable of modulating stability (21Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar), activity (18Gostissa M. Hengstermann A. Fogal V. Sandy P. Schwarz S.E. Scheffner M. Del Sal G.

Blood. 2000; 95: 2748-2753Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of various proteins. Analysis of E1 mutants defective for sumoylation has not demonstrated any overall effect on intracellular levels of E1 protein, although there are two possible caveats to our studies. First, the in vivoexperiments were all done with overexpression vectors, which may override normal controls on E1 steady state levels. Second, there could be subtle changes in E1 levels during cell cycle stages that may not be apparent in unsynchronized cultures especially with protein overexpression. Consequently, any effect of sumoylation on E1 stability will need further evaluation. In contrast to the apparent lack of effect on E1 levels, impaired sumoylation correlated with defective replication of a BPV origin plasmid in vivo. Three E1 mutants, L420P/K421A, K514A, and K514R, that were completely defective for sumoylation in vitro and in vivo demonstrated no replication in vivo. A fourth mutant, L420I/K421A, was weakly sumoylated in vitro and retained partial replication activity in vivo. Similarly, L420P/K421A, K514A, and K514R were all severely defective for intranuclear accumulation, whereas E1 L420I/K421A displayed an intermediate phenotype with some resemblance to the wild-type pattern although with quantitatively much reduced accumulation in the speckles and foci. Similar nuclear localization defects have been seen for SUMO-1 site mutants of PML and homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (22Kim Y.H. Choi C.Y. Kim Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12350-12355Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 25Zhong S. Muller S. Ronchetti S. Freemont P.S. Dejean A. Pandolfi P.P. Blood. 2000; 95: 2748-2753Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we conclude from our data that SUMO-1 modification of E1 is required for normal intranuclear accumulation and distribution of the E1 proteins and that the inability of the mutant E1 proteins to reach their required levels or sites in the nucleus resulted in the replication defect. Although the identity of the nuclear speckles and foci we observed with wild-type E1 has not been determined, at least some of these E1 accumulations likely represent the viral “replication compartments” that are localized in close proximity to ND10s (38Swindle C.S. Zou N.X. Van T.B.A. Shaw G.M. Engler J.A. Chow L.T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1001-1009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,39Day P.M. Roden R.B.S. Lowy D.R. Schiller J.T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 142-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the subcellular partitioning of E1 through post-translational modification by SUMO-1 may be of general importance as an additional mechanism for the regulation of viral replication by the host cell. Whether or not the mutations tested also have any direct impact on E1 replicative functions outside of preventing nuclear localization has not yet been determined. Likewise, the direct effect of the SUMO-1 moiety on wild-type E1 functions remains to be investigated. The mechanism by which sumoylation is required for intranuclear accumulation of E1 is unknown, although it may involve transport through the nuclear pores in as much of the unsumoylated E1 accumulated at the nuclear periphery. Because it is unlikely that all nuclear proteins are sumoylated, a generic requirement for sumoylation as part of the typical nuclear pore transport process seems doubtful. Intriguingly, E1 contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS)-like sequence, RKHK (residues 505–508), that is just NH2-terminal to the sumoylation site at residue 514. Whereas E1 is known to possess a bipartite NLS in the NH2-terminal region that is required for nuclear uptake (40Lentz M.R. Pak D. Mohr I. Botchan M.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1414-1423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Leng X. Wilson V.G. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 2463-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the possible contribution of this second potential site has not been evaluated. Sumoylation near this second site may be required to facilitate passage through the nuclear pore. Alternatively, E1 may possess a region inhibitory to nuclear transport that is counteracted by the addition of SUMO-1. Consistent with this second possibility, a small E1-derived polypeptide containing the bipartite NLS efficiently directed fused β-galactosidase to the nucleus (41Leng X. Wilson V.G. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 2463-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This result indicates that there is no sumoylation requirement for the nuclear uptake function of the known NLS when it is separated from the bulk of the E1 sequences as would be expected if inhibitory sequences were located elsewhere in the protein. Whereas these two models are appealing in their simplicity, other mechanisms are also possible, and further studies will be needed to resolve the role of sumoylation in nuclear uptake. Nonetheless, the E1 protein provides a relatively well characterized system for exploring what appears to be a new level of nuclear transport control."

Extensive studies of LTB4 and the search for the molecular identity of its receptors have resulted in the recent cloning of a LTB4 receptor (16Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar) (LTB4-R1). This protein is a cell surface receptor and belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily containing seven membrane-spanning domains. The LTB4 receptor binds LTB4 with high affinity, which in turn leads to intracellular signaling and chemotaxis. Among the major tissues tested, the receptor is expressed abundantly only in peripheral leukocytes (16Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the identification of a novel LTB4 receptor (LTB4-R2) that shares homology with LTB4-R1, and the finding that the two receptors are genetically linked. This novel receptor is highly expressed in several peripheral tissues such as liver, spleen, and intestine and binds LTB4 with high affinity. The ligand-receptor interaction activates the receptor leading to intracellular signal transduction. 3H-labeled LTB4 (∼200 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Human Marathon-ready cDNAs and RACE kit were fromCLONTECH. The 293-EBNA cell line was obtained from Invitrogen. Leukotrienes and other ligands were purchased from Sigma Chemicals and Cayman Chemical Co. 14,15-Dehydro-LTB4, LTB4-3-aminopropylamide, and U-75302 were purchased from BIOMOL Research laboratories, Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Oligonucleotides were custom-synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. Their sequences are: oligo347, 5′-ctaccacgcagtcaaccttctgcag; oligo348A, 5′-caccggaaggggccttggcgaagct; oligo348B, 5′-tgctctacgtcttcaccgctggaga, oligo358, 5′-gccgccaccatgtcggtctgctaccgtcc; oligo417, 5′-gccgccaccatgaacactacatcttctgcagc; oligo418, 5′-gtgcgcctccttccaccaggcctag; MM311, 5′-ctgacagcaggatgatagcca; 63U, 5′-tttttgttagtttgaggggaag; 480L, 5′-gcagaagggccgcctccattcc; and oligo359, 5′-gcaggttgtagggtctgctgtca. DNA sequencing was performed using the Big Dye Terminators sequencing agents (Applied Biosystems). The amino acid sequences of known G-protein-coupled receptors were used to conduct a BLAST search against expressed sequence tag data bases. The search identified a 397-base sequence as a putative GPCR fragment (HDPYA90R, see Fig. 1 A). A phylogenetic analysis (Wisconsin Package, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI) suggested that the sequence was related to a leukotriene receptor covering transmembrane domains 3 through 6. Further computational survey of public data bases identified contiguous sequences that resulted in a composite 2451-base sequence that contained a 888-base sequence at the 3′-end, which appeared to be a portion of an open reading frame of a GPCR (Met to TM6, see Fig. 1 A). A 3′-RACE was performed to obtain the missing 3′-portion of the putative open reading frame (ORF) by PCR using the Marathon RACE kit for PCR reactions and human liver Marathon-ready cDNA (CLONTECH) as a template. Primary PCR using oligo347 and AP1 (35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 3 min), secondary PCR using primers AP2 and oligo348A (35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min), and tertiary PCR using primers AP2 and oligo348B (35 cycles of 94 °C for 30s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min) resulted in a ∼400-base pair (bp) 3′-RACE product (see Fig. 1 A). To obtain a full ORF, a 5′-primer (oligo358) containing the ATG codon in the 888-base sequence and a 3′-primer (oligo359) containing the putative stop codon in the 3′-RACE sequence were generated. A PCR with this pair of primers and human liver cDNA as a template (35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min) yielded a PCR product of ∼1.1 kb (SP9030, Fig. 1 A). A genomic clone containing both LTB4-R2 (SP9030) and LTB4-R1 receptors was obtained by PCR screening a human PAC PCRable DNA pool (Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO) with primers 63U and 480L. PCR was performed using PCR Supermix (Life Technologies, Inc) with a thermal cycling of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s (35 cycles). The size of the intron was determined by PCR using Supermix HiFidelity (Life Technologies) with primers oligo347 and MM311 and the PAC DNA as a template (94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 5 min). The resulting PCR product (∼4.0 kb) was gel-purified with a Qiaex II gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and partially sequenced (∼600 bp) at each of the two ends of the fragment. COS-7 cells grown in DMEM/10% FCS at 80–90% confluency were transfected with SuperFect agent (Qiagen) at 20 μg of DNA/150-mm plate. 48 h after transfection, medium was changed to Opti-MEM or DMEM/Opti-MEM (1:1)/5%FCS. 72 h after transfection, the cells were washed with 20 ml of phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+/Mg2+ and incubated with 10 ml of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin at room temperature for 30 min. The cells were scraped off the plate and vortexed. The cell suspension was then centrifuged at 13,000g at 4 °C for 15 min. The pellets were resuspended in 1.8 ml of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and vortexed. The membranes were homogenized with a 23-gauge needle. The protein concentration of the membrane preparations was determined with the BCA agents (Pierce). For saturation binding, 150 μl of binding assay buffer (30 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.05% fatty acid free BSA (w/v), kept cold on ice) containing 24 μg of membranes were mixed with 50 μl of binding assay buffer containing 0 or 1 μm leukotriene in 2% (v/v) Me2SO. [3H]LTB4 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 50 nm) was added to the assays at increasing concentrations. The reactions were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with slow rotation. Binding solutions were filtered through Multiscreen FB filters (Millipore) presoaked with 50 μl of binding assay buffer for 1 h at room temperature, and the filters were washed twice with 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5 (ice-cold). Fifty μl of Microscint fluid was added to the filters and counted for the bound radioligands. For radioligand competition assays, 160 μl of binding assay buffer containing membranes were mixed with 20 μl of binding assay buffer containing various concentrations of competing compounds in 6% Me2SO (v/v). A final 20 μl of binding assay buffer containing 1 μl of [3H]LTB4(PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 50 nm, final concentration 0.25 nm) in 6% (v/v) Me2SO was added to start the binding reaction. The final concentration of ethanol as the solvent in the stock LTB4 solution was 0.5% (v/v). Binding data were analyzed with non-linear regression software (Prism; GraphPad, San Diego, CA). 293-EBNA cells grown in DMEM/10% FCS at 80–90% confluency were transfected with the SuperFect agent (Qiagen). On the next day the cells were trypsinized off the plate and washed with phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+/Mg2+. The cells were then seeded at a cell density of 35,000 cells/100 μl of medium into 96-well plates precoated with poly-d-lysine (Becton Dickinson). On the third day, the medium was removed, and 100 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution (without phenol red) containing 4 μm of Fluo-3, AM (Molecular Probes), 20 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 0.1% (w/v) BSA, and 250 mm probenecid were added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2for 1 h. The cells were then washed three times with 150 μl of buffer containing Hanks' balanced salt solution, 40 mmHepes, pH 7.4, and 250 mm probenecid. One hundred μl of the wash buffer was added after the final wash, and Ca2+flux was measured with a Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (Molecular Devices) after addition of 40 μl of the buffer containing appropriate concentration of ligands. 293 cells were transfected with plasmid DNA and the SuperFect agent. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, 100 ng/ml pertusis toxin (PTX) was added to the cells, which were incubated at 37 °C overnight. Immediately prior to assay, the cells were released from the plate by the cell dissociation buffer (Sigma), and pelleted by centrifuge at 2000 rpm, 5 min, at 4 °C in a 10-ml Ficon tube. The cells were resuspended and seeded at 50,000 cells/50 μl of stimulation buffer/per well of FlashPlate. Fresh LTB4 was prepared in Hanks'-HEPES buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.2% BSA (w/v), filtered, and stored at 4 °C). Fifty μl of LTB4 plus or minus 10 μm forskolin was added to the FlashPlate. Standard cAMP ranging from 0 to 1000 pmol/ml were arranged in the same plate. The plate was incubated on a rotating shaker at room temperature for 0.5 h. At the end of the incubation, the assay was terminated by addition of 100 μl of the adenylyl cyclase activation FlashPlate detection mixture (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The FlashPlate was covered and gently agitated on a shaker for 3–5 h. After the development, the FlashPlate was counted on a 96-well counter. A standard curve was prepared, and the counts were converted to mass (pmol of cAMP/ml). Cyclic AMP production data were analyzed with non-linear regression. Hybridization to Northern blots and dot blots (CLONTECH) was carried out using a PCR-generated 440-bp DNA fragment from the 5′-untranslated region of the open reading frame (ORF) of LTB4-R2. The DNA fragment was random prime-labeled with [32P]dCTP, and the blots were hybridized for 14 h in ExpressHyb (CLONTECH) containing ∼2 million cpm/ml radiolabeled probe. The following day the blots were washed according to the manufacturer's protocol and exposed to Kodak Biomax MS film for 6 days at −70 °C. The films were analyzed for relative expression levels using the MCID M4 image analysis system (Imaging Research, Ontario, Canada). For the known receptor LTB4-R1, a 425-bp fragment corresponding to nucleotides 49–474 of the published LTB4 open reading frame (16Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar) was generated by PCR. The Northern blot and dot blot analyses were carried out with the random-prime [32P]dCTP-labeled fragment, hybridized overnight at 65 °C with multiple tissue dot blots and Northern blots (CLONTECH). Sequence analysis of the 1.1-kb PCR product resulting from multiple RACE amplification steps identified a putative ORF of 1077 bp (Fig. 1 A), which encodes a protein of 358 amino acids (Fig. 1 B). Hydrophobicity analysis of the 358-amino acid sequence suggested that there are seven transmembrane-spanning regions. BLAST analysis with the amino acid sequence against the GenBank™ data base revealed homology of the amino acid sequence to the human leukocyte LTB4 receptor (LTB4-R1, 42%) (16Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B), the human CRTH2 (32%) (17Nagata K. Tanaka K. Ogawa K. Kemmotsu K. Imai T. Yoshie O.

The amino acid sequence of the receptor is only distantly related (∼18% homology) to the recently cloned leukotriene D4receptor (20Lynch K.R. O'Neill G.P. Liu Q. Im D.S. Sawyer N. Metters K.M.

The high amino acid sequence homology to LTB4-R1 and the presence in all seven transmembrane domains of conserved amino acid motifs indicated that this was a G-protein-coupled receptor. Thus the novel receptor was tentatively termed as LTB4-R2. Alignment of the cDNA of LTB4-R2 with the ORF of LTB4-R1 revealed that the 5′-untranslated region (UTRs) of the transcript (GenBank™ accession number D89079 (16Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar)) is identical to the coding region at the 3′-portion and the immediate downstream sequence in the 3′-UTR of the ORF of LTB4-R2. This analysis suggests that portions of both LTB4 receptors could exist on a single mRNA and the two LTB4 receptors are in the same chromosomal region. A genomic clone containing coding regions of LTB4-R2 and LTB4-R1 was obtained (PAC clone 159K10) by PCR screening of a human PAC library using primers 63U and 480L in the coding region of LTB4-R2 (Fig. 2 A). Direct sequencing of the PAC clone revealed no intervening sequences in the coding region of either receptor, thus both receptors are encoded by intronless ORFs (Fig. 2 A). A second PCR using primers oligo347 and MM311 revealed a single ∼3.6-kb intron 3′ downstream of LTB4-R2 and 5′ upstream of LTB4-R1 (Fig. 2 A). GenBank™ entry AL096870 is a genomic sequence from chromosome 14.

The 3′-untranslated sequence of LTB4-R2 is identical to the 5′-end of the intron, suggesting that this transcript contains only LTB4-R2 (Fig. 2 B). There were three GenBank™ entries that contained LTB4-R1 mRNAs: D89078, D89079, and U33448. D89079 (16Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar) contains the coding sequences of both LTB4-R2 and LTB4-R1 but does not have the 3.6-kb intron (Fig. 2 C). U33448 (22Raport C.J. Schweickart V.L. Chantry D. Eddy Jr., R.L. Shows T.B. Godiska R. Gray P.W. J. Leukoc.

D89078 also contains only the coding region of LTB4-R1; however, the 5′-untranslated region is identical to the middle portion of the 3.6-kb intron (Fig. 2 E). Dot blot and Northern blot analyses were performed to determine the expression of LTB4-R2 mRNA in human tissues. A dot blot containing mRNAs from 56 human tissues (CLONTECH) was hybridized to a 440-bp fragment derived from the 5′-UTR of LTB4-R2 cDNA. The highest expression of LTB4-R2 was detected in liver followed by small intestine, spleen, and fetal liver (20–40% of that of liver; Fig. 3 A). Adrenal gland and pituitary had expression levels between 10 and 20% of those in the liver. All of the other 49 tissues expressed LTB4-R2 at 10% of or less than that of the liver level (Fig. 3 A), including peripheral leukocytes in which LTB4-R1 is highly expressed (16Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Using the same fragment as probe to hybridize a Northern blot, a mRNA of approximately 1.6 kb with high abundance was seen in the liver and a weak band in kidney (Fig. 3 B). No expression was detected in heart, brain, placenta, skeletal muscle, and pancreas. Employing a quantitative PCR method (Taqman, PE Biosystems) with 27 cDNA preparations generated primarily from human fetal and diseased tissues as templates, the highest expression of LTB4-R2 was again detected in fetal small intestine, Crohn's colon, fetal liver, and fetal lung (not shown). As is the case for the novel LTB4 receptor, the LTB4-R1 mRNA appears to be widely distributed in human tissues based on the results of the dot blot. LTB4-R1 is most abundant in immune-related tissues, including spleen, peripheral blood leukocytes, and bone marrow. Although there is also low expression of the LTB4-R1 mRNA in liver, it is not as prominent as that for LTB4-R2. The Dot blot data for LTB4-R1 are consistent with the Northern blot analysis shown by Yokomizo et al. (16Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar) in which high expression was seen in peripheral leukocytes and low or no mRNA was detected in other tissues. Radioligand binding assays were performed to directly test the ability of LTB4-R2 to bind LTB4. The ORF of LTB4-R2 was cloned in expression vector pCR3.1 to form construct pCR3.1-LTB4-R2. COS-7 cells were transfected with the construct, and membranes were prepared for a [3H]LTB4 binding assay. As shown in Fig. 4 A, specific binding was observed with the membranes prepared from cells transfected with pCR3.1-LTB4-R2; in contrast, no specific binding was seen with membranes prepared from cells transfected with vector alone. Because serum used in the cell cultures may carry low concentrations of LTB4 (23Seggev J.S. Wiessner J.H. Thornton Jr., W.H. Edes T.E. Ann. Allergy Asthma Immunol. 1995; 75: 365-368PubMed Google Scholar), radioligand binding assays were performed in parallel with membranes prepared from cells grown for the last 24 h in either serum-free (Opti-MEM) or medium containing 5% (v/v) FCS. No difference in the abilities of the two membrane preparations to bind [3H]LTB4 were found (Fig. 4 A), indicating that the serum used in the experiments did not affect ligand-receptor interaction through potential effects of either desensitization or receptor down-regulation. Saturation radioligand binding assays employing membranes from cells cultured in serum yielded a Kd of 0.17 ± 0.07 nm andBmax of 70 ± 8 fmol/mg of membrane protein (n = 3) (Fig. 4 B). SimilarKd and Bmax values were obtained when membranes were prepared from cells cultured in serum-free medium: Kd = 0.21 ± 0.06 nm andBmax = 64 ± 7 fmol/mg of protein (not shown). The pharmacological profiles of LTB4-R2 and LTB4-R1 were compared in radioligand competition assays using [3H]LTB4 as the radioligand and a number of unlabeled leukotrienes, leukotriene analogs, leukotriene receptor antagonists, and 5-lipoxygenase products as competitors (TableI). LTB4, LTB5, and an LTB4 metabolite, 20-hydroxy-LTB4, have high affinities for both LTB-R2 (Ki ≤ 41 nm and relative affinity ≤ 18) and LTB4-R1 (Ki ≤ 3.7 nm and relative affinity ≤ 5.3) receptors (Table I and Fig. 5). A 5-lipoxygenase product, 15(S)-HETE, and an arachidonic acid derivative, 12-oxo-ETE, displayed moderate affinities for LTB4-R2 (relative affinity = 67–73) but had low binding affinities for LTB4-R1 (Ki > 1000 nm) (Table I and Fig. 5). The affinities of the three LTB4receptor antagonists (14,15-dehydro-LTB4 (24Shimazaki T. Kobayashi Y. Sato F. Iwama T. Shikada K.

The specificity of thrombin for PAR1 is enhanced by binding to a hirudin-like region (Hir) located in the receptor exodomain. Here, we examine the mechanism of thrombin-PAR1 recognition and cleavage by steady-state kinetic measurements using soluble PAR1 N-terminal exodomains. We determined that the primary role of the PAR1 Hir sequence is to reduce the kinetic barriers to formation of the docked thrombin-PAR1 complex rather than to form high affinity ground-state interactions. In addition, the exosite I-bound Hir motif facilitates the productive interaction of the PAR138LDPR/SFL44 sequence with the active site of thrombin. This locking process is the most energetically unfavorable step of the overall reaction. The subsequent irreversible steps of peptide bond cleavage are rapid and allosterically enhanced by the presence of the docked Hir sequence. Furthermore, the C-terminal exodomain product of thrombin cleavage, corresponding to the activated receptor, binds tightly to thrombin. This would suggest that an additional role of the Hir sequence in the thrombin-activated receptor is to sequester thrombin to the platelet surface and modulate cleavage of other platelet receptors such as the PAR4 thrombin receptor, which lacks a functional Hir sequence.

Thrombin activates PAR1 by binding and cleaving the N-terminal exodomain at LDPR41↓S42FL generating a new N terminus (S42FLLRN). The new N terminus functions as a tethered ligand, which activates PAR1 by binding to the body of the receptor (8Bahou W.F. Kutok J.L. Wong A. Potter C.L. Coller B.S.

The N-terminal exodomain also contains a sequence, K51YEPF55 (Hir), that resembles the C-tail of the leech anti-coagulant protein, hirudin.

Fenton J.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3266-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies indicate that the presence of the Hir sequence in the PAR1 exodomain confers significant enhancements in the efficiency of thrombin cleavage (11Liu L.W. Vu T. Esmon C.T.

Biol. 1995; 253: 787-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), it is possible that the Hir sequence may increase the probability that productive orientations occur at the active site by anchoring the LDPR region and by an induced fit mechanism. Thus, PAR4, which lacks a functional Hir sequence (16Nakanishi-Matsui M. Zheng Y.-W. Sulciner D.J. Weiss E.J. Ludeman M.J. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 404: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), is activated 20- to 70-fold slower by thrombin than PAR1 on human platelets (5Covic L. Gresser A.L. Kuliopulos A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5458-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). An unusual feature of thrombin-PAR interactions is that stoichiometric amounts of thrombin, rather than catalytic amounts, are required for platelet activation (5Covic L. Gresser A.L. Kuliopulos A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5458-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that the low turnover of thrombin could be due to tight binding and a slow off-rate from cleaved receptors. However, since fast enzymic reactions are not favored by strong ground-state interactions (17Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1985: 121-346Google Scholar, 18Kuliopulos A. Mildvan A.S. Shortle D. Talalay P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), it is paradoxical that thrombin activation of PAR1 on platelets is extremely rapid (5Covic L. Gresser A.L. Kuliopulos A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5458-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Indeed, previous studies (19Kuliopulos A. Covic L. Seeley S.K. Sheridan P.J. Helin J. Costello C.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4572-4585Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) established that the N-terminal exodomain of PAR1 (TR78) expressed in soluble form is also cleaved with high efficiency by thrombin. In this paper, we examine the mechanism of thrombin-PAR1 recognition and cleavage by conducting steady-state kinetic measurements with soluble PAR1 N-terminal exodomains. We determined that the PAR1 Hir sequence is essential for rapid association with thrombin to form a Hir-docked complex and does not provide tight ground-state binding. The subsequent step, whereby the LDPR/SFL sequence locks into the active site of thrombin, presents the highest energy barrier to the overall reaction. Peptide bond cleavage at Arg41-Ser42is allosterically enhanced by the docked Hir sequence. Interestingly, the cleaved exodomain product, TR62, which retains the Hir sequence, binds tightly to thrombin. Thus, the Hir sequence may play an additional role in preserving thrombin association with the cleaved PAR1 receptor, consequently favoring a low turnover of thrombin and tethering the protease near adjacent naive PAR receptors on the platelet surface.

Soluble PAR1 exodomains (TR78 and TR59) were produced in Escherichia colias KSI-PAR1-His6 fusions as described previously (19Kuliopulos A. Covic L. Seeley S.K. Sheridan P.J. Helin J. Costello C.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4572-4585Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Shorter PAR1 exodomain fragments TR26 (PAR1 residues Arg36-Glu60), TR26R41Q and LBS-1 (PAR1 residues85PAFISEDASGYL96-C) were synthesized at the Tufts University School of Medicine Peptide Core Facility. TR78 was produced using the expression plasmid pET31MØTR78. This plasmid was generated by subcloning the TR78 encodingNcoI/XhoI restriction fragment from pET22-KTRMH (19Kuliopulos A. Covic L. Seeley S.K. Sheridan P.J. Helin J. Costello C.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4572-4585Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) into pET31MØ, which is pET31b (Novagen, Madison, WI (20Kuliopulos A. Walsh C.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 4599-4607Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar)) with NcoI replacing theAlwNI site. Expression plasmids encoding the PAR1 exodomain mutants, TR78ΔHir (Δ51KYEPF55), TR78HirAla (51KYEPF55→AAAAK), TR78R41S, and TR78R41Q, were generated by a modification of the method of Zoller and Smith (21Kuliopulos A. Talalay P. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10271-10280Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The sequences encoding the exodomains were subcloned into pET22-KTRMH using the NcoI/XhoI restriction sites to produce pET22KTRMH-ΔHir1 and pET22KTRMH-Hir1Ala. Alternatively, sequences were subcloned into pET31MØ using theNcoI/XhoI restriction sites, generating pET31TR78-R41S and pET31TR78-R41Q. The plasmid expressing the TR59 fusion protein (pET31TR59) was generated by the polymerase chain reaction using a primer containing the 3′-XhoI restriction site. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested withNcoI and XhoI and ligated to theNcoI/XhoI sites of pET31MØTR78. The resulting plasmids were placed into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysSfor production of the PAR1 exodomain fusion proteins. The KSI-PAR1-His6 fusions were purified by Ni-chelate chromatography, and the PAR1 exodomains were released from KSI and His6 by CNBr cleavage and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography as described previously (19Kuliopulos A. Covic L. Seeley S.K. Sheridan P.J. Helin J. Costello C.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4572-4585Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Thrombin cleavage of PAR1 exodomains was monitored by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatographic analysis. Identity of peptide fragments was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. Lyophilized domains were reconstituted in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl (PBS), and the concentration was determined by UV absorption (ε278 (TR78) = 15,200m−1 cm−1; ε278(TR78ΔHir, TR78HirAla) = 13,800 m−1cm−1; ε278 (TR59) = 8300m−1 cm−1; ε278(TR26) = 6900 m−1 cm−1). Cleavage assays containing 5–570 μm exodomain in PBS were conducted at 37 °C and were initiated by the addition of human α-thrombin freshly diluted in ice-cold PBS/0.1% PEG 8000 (final thrombin concentration = 68 pm to 1 nm). PEG 8000 was included in the thrombin diluent to eliminate nonspecific binding of thrombin to the walls of the polyethylene tubes (22Wasiewski W. Fasco M.J. Martin B.M. Detwiler T.C. Fenton J.W. Thromb. Res. 1976; 8: 881-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 23Latallo Z.S. Hall J.A. Thromb. Res. 1986; 43: 507-521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The final concentration of PEG 8000 in all of the assays was 0.009%. Initial rates (kobs) were obtained by analyzing base-quenched samples taken at early time points where the progress curves were linear. Quantitation of cleavage products was performed by integrating peak areas and comparing them with calibration curves of fully digested samples (19Kuliopulos A. Covic L. Seeley S.K. Sheridan P.J. Helin J. Costello C.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4572-4585Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Thrombin cleavage of TR78, TR78HirAla, and TR26 was monitored by measuring the generation of the C-terminal product (TR62, TR62HirAla, and TR20, respectively) at 278 nm. Thrombin cleavage of TR78ΔHir and TR59 was monitored by measuring the generation of the N-terminal product (TR16) at 222 nm. TR16 was completely resolved from undigested exodomain. Initial rates were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Eq. 1) by non-linear least-squares regression to generate the kinetic parameterskcat and Km.kobs=kcatS/(Km+S)Equation 1 Cleavage of chromogenic substrates was determined by continuously monitoring the increase in absorbance at 405 nm at 37 °C in a 96-well format using a SPECTRAmax 340 microplate spectrophotometer. Cleavage assays were comprised of 5–400 μm substrate (CBS, H2N-LDPR-pNA, orN-acetyl-LDPR-pNA) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, and 150 mm NaCl (TBS) and were initiated by the addition of thrombin freshly diluted in ice-cold TBS/0.1% PEG 8000 (final thrombin concentration = 208 pm). Initial rates were determined by taking the initial slopes of the progress curves using SOFTmax PRO version 2.1. Quantification of the p-nitroanilide product was determined with the extinction coefficient (ε405 = 8300 m−1 cm−1), and data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Inhibition of thrombin cleavage of CBS was performed as above, with the exception that PAR1 exodomains were added at four to five different concentrations ranging from 5 to 300 μm, and assays were performed at 24 °C. Inhibition data were tested against 12 inhibition models (linear, hyperbolic, and parabolic models of competitive, noncompetitive, uncompetitive, and full-noncompetitive inhibition) by non-linear least-squares regression analysis. The model of best fit was determined by visual inspection of the slope and intercept replots, by the “goodness of fit” criterion, which is a normalized Akaike information criterion test, using EZFit 5.0 (Perrella Scientific, Inc., Amherst, NH) and by F-test using Grafit 3.0 (Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines, UK). Three patterns emerged from the inhibition of CBS cleavage by PAR1 exodomains: linear competitive (C) inhibition represented by Eqs. 2 and 3, linear noncompetitive (NC) inhibition, represented by Eqs. 4 and 5, and linear uncompetitive (UC) inhibition, represented by Eqs. 6 and 7: kobs=kcatS/(Km(1+I/Kis)+S)Equation 2 E+S ⇌Ks ES →kcat E+P+IKis⥮ EI kobs=kcatS/(Km(1+I/Kis)+S(1+I/Kii))Equation 3 E+S ⇌ Ks ES → kcat E+P+I+IKis⥮⥮Kii EI+S ⇌αKs ESI kobs=kcatS/(Km+S(1+I/Kii))Equation 4 E+S ⇌Ks ES →kcat E+P+I Kii⥮ ESIwhere I is inhibitor concentration,Kis is the slope inhibition constant, andKii is the intercept inhibition constant. Assays were performed as above in the presence of 0–30% sucrose viscogen. Relative viscosity (ηrel) of the assay solution was measured relative to PBS alone for the PAR1 exodomains or TBS alone for the chromogenic substrates in quadruplicate using an Ostwald viscometer. Initial velocities were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation, and the kinetic parameters were analyzed as a function of relative viscosity. Because solution viscosity affects the rates of diffusion-controlled steps, such as substrate association and dissociation, one can define the parameters shown in the following one-substrate reaction: E+S ⇌kdka ES →kf E+PEquation 5 where ka is the rate constant of substrate association, kd is the rate of substrate dissociation, kf is the rate of conversion to product, E is enzyme, S is substrate, ES is the enzyme-substrate complex, and P is product. Ideally, rates of steps not controlled by diffusion such as a conformational change or a chemical reaction step will remain unaffected by relative solution viscosity. A “sticky” substrate, which has a dissociation rate comparable to or slower than the rate of reaction to product, will decreasekcat/Km with increasing relative viscosity (24Cleland W.W. Bernasconi C.F. Investigation of Rates and Mechanisms of Reactions. Part 1. Wiley, New York1986: 791-970Google Scholar). Conversely, a nonsticky substrate, which binds in rapid equilibrium prior to conversion to product, will produce akcat/Km that is not affected by relative viscosity. Substrate stickiness was determined by plotting (kcat/Km)o/(kcat/Km) as a function of relative viscosity (ηrel)(see Fig. 2) according to Eq. 9:(kcat/Km) 0/(kcat/Km)=ηrel/(1+kd/kf)+(kd/kf)/(1+kd/kf)Equation 6 where the slope, (kcat/Km)η = 1/(1 + kd/kf), is equal to 1 for a sticky substrate and 0 for a nonsticky substrate, and (kcat/Km)o is determined in the absence of viscogen. The “stickiness” ratio (Sr =kf/kd) approaches zero for a nonsticky substrate, whereas it is large for sticky substrates. Association rate constants and Sr were determined by linear regression analysis of the viscosity data of fits to Eq. 10.1/(kcat/Km)=ηrel/ka+(kd/kf)/kaEquation 7 Figure 2Effect of relative solution viscosity onkcat /Km for thrombin cleavage of TR78 and TR78Δ Hir. Kinetic parameters were obtained for thrombin cleavage of TR78 and TR78ΔHir in the presence of varying concentrations of sucrose viscogen. Assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Lines represent the least-squares fit of the data. Each data point is from kcat/Km values derived from five different substrate concentrations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine the mechanism by which the Hir sequence enhances thrombin-PAR1 interactions, we measured the effects of the Hir sequence on steady-state kinetic parameters and substrate association/dissociation rates using an array of soluble PAR1 exodomain mutants (Fig. 1). The full-length PAR1 exodomain, TR78 (Ala26-Thr102), is an effective substrate for thrombin with a kcat of 58 s−1 and a Km of 26 μm (TableI). Deletion of the51KYEPF55 Hir sequence (TR78ΔHir) or substitution with 51AAAAK55 (TR78HirAla) causes an 8- to 30-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km). TheKm for both Hir mutants increased by 3-fold, whereaskcat decreased by 2.6-fold for TR78ΔHir and by 10-fold for TR78HirAla.Table ISteady-state kinetic parameters for the cleavage of soluble PAR1 exodomains and small chromogenic substrates by human α-thrombinSubstrateKmkcatkcat/KmRelative kcat/KmΔG ‡T1-aThe Gibb's free energy of activation (ΔG ‡T) for the second-order rate constant,kcat/Km, was calculated from ΔG ‡T =RT(ln(kT/h) − ln(kcat/Km)) (17).ΔΔG ‡Tμms−1m−1 s−1kcal/molTR78HirAla88 ± 86.0 ± 0.56.8 × 1040.03111.32.1TR28–45 1-bTR28–60 (PAR1 residues Pro29-Glu60), TR28–45 (PAR1 residues Pro29-Leu45), Tyrodes buffer, pH 7.4, 25 °C (12).900 353.9 × 1040.01811.11.9TR78ΔHir84 ± 1722 ± 12.6 × 1050.1210.51.3DPR-SFL 1-c50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 37 °C (36).3.6 × 1050.1610.31.1N-Ac-LDPR-pNA113 ± 11119 ± 51.1 × 1060.509.60.4H2N-LDPR-pNA66 ± 8121 ± 51.8 × 1060.829.30.1TR7826 ± 658 ± 62.2 × 1061.09.20TR5912.5 ± 3.5107 ± 98.6 × 1063.98.3−0.9TR265.1 ± 0.9104 ± 42.0 × 1079.17.8−1.4TR28–60 1-bTR28–60 (PAR1 residues Pro29-Glu60), TR28–45 (PAR1 residues Pro29-Leu45), Tyrodes buffer, pH 7.4, 25 °C (12). 101301.3 × 1075.97.7−1.5CBS 34.475.0 ± 0.8117 ± 72.3 × 107107.7−1.5Exodomains: 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 37 °C; chromogenic substrates: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 150 mm NaCl, 37 °C.1-a The Gibb's free energy of activation (ΔG ‡T) for the second-order rate constant,kcat/Km, was calculated from ΔG ‡T =RT(ln(kT/h) − ln(kcat/Km)) (17Fersht A.

The contribution of the Hir sequence to the binding events preceding PAR1 exodomain cleavage was obtained from the effects of viscosity on the reaction kinetics. Most strikingly, the viscosity experiments revealed that the association rate constant (ka) for TR78ΔHir is 73-fold slower than the ka for wild-type TR78 (Table II). We also determined the effect of the Hir sequence on the stickiness of the PAR1 exodomain to thrombin. A sticky substrate is a substrate with a slow rate of dissociation (kd) compared with the forward rate of conversion to product (kf) (Eq. 8). As shown in Fig. 2, the catalytic efficiency for thrombin cleavage of TR78 was not significantly affected by changes in relative viscosity as illustrated by the slope of (kcat/Km)o/(kcat/Km)versus ηrel((kcat/Km)η = 0.12) and a stickiness ratio of Sr = 0.12 (TableII). In contrast, a sticky substrate would display a slope of ∼1 and a large stickiness ratio (24Cleland W.W. Bernasconi C.F. Investigation of Rates and Mechanisms of Reactions. Part 1. Wiley, New York1986: 791-970Google Scholar). Thus, the PAR1 exodomain is not a sticky substrate for thrombin and a rapid pre-equilibrium between free and bound species occurs prior to hydrolysis. Unexpectedly, TR78ΔHir is a fully sticky substrate and itskcat/Km is affected considerably by solution viscosity 2Caution must be used when interpreting viscosity effects on reaction kinetics, because the large concentrations of sucrose may lead to nonspecific effects such as changes in dielectric constant and volume exclusion. However, since sucrose had no effect on the cleavage rates of wild-type TR78, H2N-LDPR-pNA, orN-acetyl-LDPR-pNA under identical conditions, this demonstrates that the effects of sucrose on thrombin cleavage of TR78ΔHir are due to changes in microviscosity. with (kcat/Km)η of 1.7. Stickiness, due to removal of the Hir sequence, could be attributed to a decrease in the rate of dissociation,kd, or to an increase in the rate of conversion to product, kf. Because deletion of the Hir sequence causes a 2.6-fold decrease inkf ∼ kcat, the stickiness of TR78ΔHir likely results from a much slower rate of dissociation.Table IIEffect of relative solution viscosity (ηrel) on kinetic parameters for cleavage of soluble PAR1 exodomains and small chromogenic substrates by human α-thrombinSubstrate(kcat/Km)η 2-a(kcat/Km)ηis the slope for the plot of (kcat/Km)0/(kcat/Km)versus relative viscosity (ηrel) according to Eq. 9.Sr 2-bSr is the stickiness ratio of kf/kd.ka 2-cka is the association rate constant of thrombin with substrate.RelativekaΔG ‡T 2-dThe Gibb's free energy of activation (ΔG ‡T) for the second-order association constant, ka, was calculated from ΔG ‡T =RT(ln(kT/h) − ln(ka)) (17).ΔΔG ‡Tm−1 s−1kcal/molTR78ΔHir1.773 2-eLower estimate from fit of data to the Michealis-Menten equation using measured values fork1 and k2.2.6 × 1050.01410.52.7TR780.120.121.9 × 1071.07.80Fibrinogen 2-f10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% PEG, 37 °C (34).0.814.9 × 1072.67.3−0.5CBS 34.470.330.605.1 × 1072.77.2−0.6N-Ac-LDPR-pNA0.0260.0288.6 × 1074.66.9−0.9H2N-LDPR-pNA0.0300.0301.2 × 1086.56.7−1.1Hirulog 2-g50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% PEG 6000, 37 °C (33).4.0 × 108216.0−1.8Exodomains: 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 37 °C; chromogenic substrates: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 150 mm NaCl, 37 °C.2-a (kcat/Km)ηis the slope for the plot of (kcat/Km)0/(kcat/Km)versus relative viscosity (ηrel) according to Eq. 9.2-b Sr is the stickiness ratio of kf/kd.2-c ka is the association rate constant of thrombin with substrate.2-d The Gibb's free energy of activation (ΔG ‡T) for the second-order association constant, ka, was calculated from ΔG ‡T =RT(ln(kT/h) − ln(ka)) (17Fersht A.

We measured the kinetics of thrombin cleavage of small peptides derived from active site-interacting P4-P1 residues of PAR1 (Fig. 1). The H2N-LDPR-pNA andN-acetyl-LDPR-pNA peptides are surprisingly good substrates for thrombin with catalytic efficiencies similar to TR78 and 3- to 5-fold higher than those exhibited by the P3-P3′ peptide DPR/SFL (Table I). Thekcat values (120 s−1) for thrombin cleavage of the LDPR substrates are 2-fold larger than for TR78 andKm values (66–113 μm) are similar to TR78ΔHir and TR78HirAla. Although these minimal LDPR substrates lack the Hir sequence, they demonstrate rapid rates of association and dissociation with thrombin and are nonsticky substrates. Association rate constants for the LDPR substrates obtained from viscosity measurements are 5-fold faster relative to TR78 and 330- to 460-fold faster relative to TR78ΔHir (Table II). The 16-fold size difference between LDPR-pNA and TR78 predicts a 2.4-fold difference in rates of association and dissociation. Therefore, appending a large exodomain to the LDPR sequence dramatically decreases the rate of productive binding of the P4-P1 residues to the active site (the locking step) unless offset by prior docking via the Hir sequence in wild-type PAR1. The events following PAR1 cleavage by thrombin are germane to thrombin-platelet interactions, because the Hir sequence remains behind as part of the cleaved PAR1 receptor. Thus, following proteolysis and dissociation of the N-terminal PAR1 cleavage fragment TR16, thrombin may remain bound to the cleaved PAR1 and kept in proximity to adjacent naive PAR1 and PAR4 receptors on the platelet surface. To determine the affinity of thrombin for the two TR78 cleavage products, TR16 (Ala26-Arg41) and TR62 (Ser42-Thr102), inhibition of cleavage of a small thrombin-optimized chromogenic substrate (CBS) was measured (Table III). The N-terminal cleavage product, TR16, was unable to inhibit thrombin at concentrations as high as 290 μm despite containing the LDPR sequence. In contrast, the C-terminal cleavage product, TR62, corresponding to the activated PAR1 receptor, is an excellent inhibitor of thrombin withKii of 9.4 μm. Because TR62 lacks P4-P1 active site binding residues, the uncompetitive pattern of inhibition (Eq. 7) indicates that the Hir sequence of TR62 binds to exosite I of thrombin and allosterically inhibits cleavage of the CBS substrate. Indeed, TR78HirAla is only able to inhibit the active site of thrombin with aKis of 35 μm in a competitive pattern (Eq. 3), and TR78ΔHir does not inhibit cleavage of CBS at 105 μm (Table III). The lower affinity of TR78ΔHir for thrombin may be a result of repulsive forces caused by the shifted WEDEE residues. Therefore, the presence of the exosite I-binding Hir motif is required for the formation of an ESI complex and inhibition of CBS cleavage.Table IIIInhibition of human α-thrombin cleavage of CBS 34.47 by soluble PAR1 exodomainsExodomainInhibition type 3-aNI, no inhibition; C, competitive inhibition; UC, uncompetitive inhibition; NC, noncompetitive inhibition as shown in Eqs. 3, 5, and 7, respectively.KisRelativeKisKiiRelativeKiiμmμmLBS-1NI(>300) 3-bNo inhibition was detected up to peptide concentrations indicated in parentheses.3-cNo inhibition of TR78 cleavage by LBS-1 at concentration up to 10"

Increases in serum PSA during endocrine therapy are generally considered as evidence for prostate cancer recurrence or progression to androgen independence. The mechanisms by which PSA up-regulation occurs in androgen-refractory prostate cancer cells are unknown. In this study, by using LNCaP and its lineage-derived androgen-independent PSA-producing subline, C4-2, we identified two cis-elements within the 5.8-kilobase pair PSA promoter that are essential for the androgen-independent activity of PSA promoter in prostate cancer cells. First, a previously reported 440-bpandrogen-responsive element enhancer core (AREc) was found to be important for the high basal PSA promoter activity in C4-2 cells. Both mutation analysis and supershift experiments demonstrated that androgen receptor (AR) binds to the AREs within the AREc and activate the basal PSA promoter activity in C4-2 cells under androgen-deprived conditions. Second, a 150-bp pN/H region was demonstrated to be a strong AR-independent positive-regulatory element of the PSA promoter in both LNCaP and C4-2 cells. Through DNase I footprinting and linker scan mutagenesis, a 17-bp RI site was identified as the key cis-element within the pN/H region. Data from electrophoretic mobility shift analysis and UV cross-linking experiments further indicated that a 45-kDa (p45) cell-specific transcription factor associates with RI in prostate cancer cells and may be responsible for driving the PSA promoter activity independent of androgen and AR. Furthermore, by juxtaposing AREc and pN/H, we produced a chimeric PSA promoter (supra-PSA) that exhibits 2–3-fold higher activity than the wild type PSA promoter in both LNCaP and C4-2 cells.

ARE-I and -II are located within the proximal region of the promoter, whereas ARE-III is contained within a 440-bp strong enhancer element core (AREc) located at −4.2 kb of the promoter (7Cleutjens K.B. van der Korput H.A. van Eekelen C.C. van Rooij H.C.

This study proposes that androgen regulation of the AREc in prostate cells might involve the formation of AR and prostate-specific factor nucleoprotein complexes on the multiple non-consensus AREs in the enhancer region (10Huang W.

It has been shown that serum PSA is proportional to tumor volume and correlates positively with the clinical stage of the disease (11Oesterling J.E. J. Urol. 1991; 145: 907-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). Progression of prostate cancer to androgen independence is commonly associated with a rebound of serum PSA (12Stamey T.A.

To understand the molecular pathways that may regulate PSA expression by androgen in normal prostate epithelium, and dysregulation during AI progression, much effort has focused on delineating the activities of AR in mediating androgen regulation of PSA expression in prostate cancer cells (2Young C.Y.

Due to the limited availability of AI yet PSA-producing prostate cancer cell lines, little is known about the androgen-independent regulation of PSA expression in hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells. The development of the androgen-independent PSA-producing C4-2 cell line from androgen-dependent parental LNCaP cells (29Horoszewicz J.S. Leong S.S. Kawinski E. Karr J.P. Rosenthal H. Chu T.M. Mirand E.A. Murphy G.P. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 1809-1818PubMed Google Scholar) has allowed us to study how PSA expression is regulated in an androgen- and growth factor-deprived environment. Like hormone-refractory prostate cancer, C4-2 was shown to be androgen-independent, defined here as cells that, when inoculated alone subcutaneously in immunocompromised mice without supporting extracellular matrices or stromal cells, form PSA-secreting tumors in castrated animals (30Thalmann G.N. Anezinis P.E. Chang S.M. Zhau H.E. Kim E.E. Hopwood V.L. Pathak S. von Eschenbach A.C. Chung L.W. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2577-2581PubMed Google Scholar, 31Thalmann G.N. Sikes R.A. Wu T.T. Degeorges A.

Cancer. 1994; 57: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). PSA expression in C4-2 cells also mimics clinical hormone-refractory prostate cancer in that the cells have acquired the ability to turn on the PSA promoter independent of androgen, thus synthesizing and secreting high amounts of PSA in the absence of androgen stimulus in vitro (32Wu H.C. Hsieh J.T. Gleave M.E. Brown N.M. Pathak S. Chung L.W. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 57: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In this report, we have taken advantage of the remarkable difference in basal PSA expression between two lineage-related LNCaP cell lines, LNCaP and C4-2, for the analysis of androgen-independent regulation of PSA promoter in prostate cancer cells. The molecular insights gained from this study will lead to the understanding of PSA rebound in hormonal-refractory prostate tumors. Through deletion analysis on PSA promoter, we provide evidence that AREc and a pN/H element within the proximal promoter region are responsible for conferring the higher AI PSA promoter activity in C4-2 cells. An AR-dependent but androgen-independent pathway appears to be involved in AREc activation, whereas a 17-bp RI site within the pN/H was shown to associate with cell-specific transcription factor and regulates the PSA promoter activity independent of AR or androgen. LNCaP and C4-2 were cultured in T-medium (33Gleave M. Hsieh J.T. Gao C.A. von Eschenbach A.C. Chung L.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3753-3761PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. For transfection, cells were grown in phenol red-free and serum-free RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.). LNCaP and C4-2 were plated at 3.3 × 105 cells/well in six-well plates 2 days before transfection. Plasmid DNAs were introduced into cells by complexing with DOTAP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Briefly, 2.5 μg of the tested DNA constructs and 0.5 μg of the internal control CMV/β-galactosidase DNA were mixed with 27 μl of 20 mmHEPES (pH 7.4) and added to separate tube containing 8 μl of DOTAP in 16 μl of HEPES with gentle mixing. DNA-lipid complexes were allowed to form for 15 min at room temperature prior to their addition to each well containing 1 ml of serum-free and phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium. The cells were incubated with the complexes at 5% CO2, 37 °C for 5 h. DNA-lipid containing medium was then replaced with fresh serum-free and phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium. Cells were collected after 36–48 h of additional incubation. All the transfections were carried out in the above serum-free conditions, unless specified otherwise. Cells were washed with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline/well and lysed in 300 μl of 1× lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Cell lysates were vortexed for a few seconds and spun for 3 min. For luciferase activity detection, 20 μl of the supernatant was mixed with 100 μl of luciferase substrate (Promega) and measured by a luminometer (Monolight 2010, Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, Sparks, MD). For β-galactosidase activity detection, 100 μl of the supernatant was mixed with an equal volume of 2× β-galactosidase substrate (Promega) and incubated at 37 °C for 15–30 min. The β-galactosidase activity was determined by plate reader at 405 nm wavelength. Data are expressed as relative luciferase activity (RLA), which is defined as luciferase activity normalized to internal control CMV/β-galactosidase activity for transfection efficiency. RLA is expressed as the mean ± standard error of the mean of at least three independent experiments. Immunoblotting was performed as described in Sambrook et al. (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a 0.42-μm nitrocellulose membrane. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. Antibody (PG-21-21A) against the amino terminus of AR was used as the primary antibody. Secondary antibody against the anti-AR IgG (horseradish peroxidase anti-rabbit antibody) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used in a 1:2000 dilution. Detection was performed with ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). PSA proteins were detected by the IMX (Abbott Laboratory, Chicago, IL) immunoassay method as described previously (35Zhau H.E. Goodwin T.J. Chang S.M. Baker T.L. Chung L.W. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 1997; 33: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). All plasmid constructs were prepared using standard methods (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The original p61-Luc and ARE-III-Luc were obtained from Dr. Jan Trapman (6Cleutjens K.B. van Eekelen C.C. van der Korput H.A.

The p61/pGL3 and the AREmIII used in this study were generated by inserting aHindIII fragment of the p61-Luc and ARE-III-Luc, respectively, in the multiple cloning site of pGL3-basic vector (Promega). Digesting p61/pGL3 with BglII andBamHI generated P61-2. Construct p61-3 was obtained by digesting p61/pGL3 partially with PstI. Construct p61-5 was generated by digesting the p61/pGL3 with BstEII, andXhoI. p61-4 was constructed by digesting p61/pGL3 withPstI and XhoI. The 440-bp AREc was first amplified by PCR using sequence-specific primers at both ends followed by TA cloning into a PCR vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). AREc was then cut out with PstI/XhoI and subcloned into a pGL3/TATA backbone. pPA8 was constructed by digesting the p61/pGL3 withEcoRI and KpnI. pN/H construct was generated by digesting the p61/pGL3 with NheI. Supra-PSA promoter (sPSA) was obtained by digesting p61-5 with PstI andNheI. p61/P2 is created by ligating NheI-digested p61/pGL3 and P2. P2/TATA is generated by ligating annealed oligos (5′-ctagggtgccagcagggcaggggcgg-3′, 5′-ctagcccgcccctgccctgctggcaccccctaggtac-3′) to the KpnI- and NheI-digested pGL3/TATA. Both L4 and A3a were generated by replacing the respective AREs with the GAL4 sequence (cggagtactgtcctccg). Briefly, two primers (L4, gtcctccgttgtcttgacagtaaacaaa, agtactccgtccagagtaggtctgttttc; A3a, gtcctccgttgcaaggatgcctgctttac, agtactccgatccaggcttgcttactgtc) each with half of the GAL4 site were designed to run PCR with the uncut AREc/TATA. P2 was generated similarly, except that pN/H was used as the template instead. The primers used for P2 mutants are 5′-agtactccgtggcacccagaggctgacca-3′ and 5′-gtcctccgtcctggggaatgaaggtttta-3′. Platinum Pfx enzyme (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used in the experiments to generate blunt-end PCR products. The PCR products were purified from 0.8% agarose gel and ligated at room temperature with a rapid ligation kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Clones were screened by PCR with a GAL4 primer (cggagtactgtcctccg) and GLprimer2 (ctttatgtttttggcgtcttcc) of the pGL3-basic vector. All clones were confirmed by DNA sequence. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-purified oligos (Sigma-Genosys, Woodlands, TX) were annealed by heating up to 95 °C and slowly cooled down to room temperature. The oligo sequences used as probes or competitors are as follows: ARE-III, 5′-tcgacgaggaacatattgtatcgagtcga-3′ (7Cleutjens K.B. van der Korput H.A. van Eekelen C.C. van Rooij H.C. Faber P.W.

The double-stranded probes were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly MA). Nuclear extracts were prepared from cells growing under 3-day complete serum-free condition (36Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar). 100,000 cpm of labeled probe and 5.6–10 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated with binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 4% glycerol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 1 mm KCl at 30 °C for 30 min. The samples were subjected to electrophoresis at room temperate on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5% TBE at 35 mA for 2 h. For experiments using SP-3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), 4 μg of antibody was added to the reaction mixture for 30 min after the incubation period of the probe and nuclear extracts; for experiments using AR antibody (CW2), nuclear extract and 2 μg of antibody were pre-incubated at 37 °C for 1 h before the addition of probe. In competition experiments, competitor oligos were incubated with nuclear extracts for 30 min at 30 °C before the addition of the probe. pN/H was labeled by Klenow (New England Biolabs) according to Current Protocols (36Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar). The binding reactions for DNase I footprinting were described previously (37Chi T. Lieberman P. Ellwood K. Carey M. Nature. 1995; 377: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 38Carey M. Smale S.T. Transcriptional Regulation in Eukaryotes: Concepts, Strategies, and Techniques. 1st Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar). 20,000 cpm of labeled probe and 10 μg of nuclear extracts from LNCaP or C4-2 cells were incubated in 13 μl of buffer containing 12.5 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 12.5% glycerol, 5 mmMgCl2, 70 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 60 mm mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 200 ng of poly(dI-dC). After 30 min at 30 °C, 2 μl of DNase I (Promega) was added to the reactions. The cleavage reactions were terminated after 1 min by addition of 100 μl of stop buffer containing 400 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.2), 0.2% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml yeast tRNA, and 100 μg/ml proteinase K (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The mixtures were incubated at 50 °C for 15 min, extracted with phenol/chloroform, and precipitated with ethanol. Precipitates were dissolved in formamide loading buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and analyzed on 6% sequencing gels. Bromodeoxyuridine-substituted probe was prepared according to the Current Protocols (36Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar). Briefly, a 50-bp synthetic oligo (containing the RI site) was annealed to a complementary 15-bp synthetic oligo and filled in with Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs). The binding reaction was set up in 96-well plate, containing 100,000 cpm labeled probe, 16 μg of C4-2 serum-free nuclear extract, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC). The reaction was then incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, followed by UV irradiation (∼305 nm) at 4 °C for 30 min. The samples were subjected to electrophoresis on a 4–12% SDS-gradient gel (Invitrogen) at room temperature for 1 h, fixed with 30% methanol, 3% glycerol solution for 20 min, and then dried. For competition experiments, 400 ng of the competitor was incubated with nuclear extracts for 30 min at 30 °C prior to the addition of probe. C4-2, a lineage-derived LNCaP subline, was shown previously to be able to grow in castrated hosts and exhibit metastatic potential in vivo (30Thalmann G.N. Anezinis P.E. Chang S.M. Zhau H.E. Kim E.E.

Cancer. 1994; 57: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). This cell line synthesizes and secretes a higher basal level of PSA than LNCaP cells in the absence of androgen stimulus in vitro (32Wu H.C. Hsieh J.T. Gleave M.E. Brown N.M. Pathak S. Chung L.W. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 57: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). This unique feature of C4-2 cells provides an opportunity to study PSA promoter regulation in prostate cancer cells with characteristics mimicking hormone-refractory status. To compare PSA secretion between parental LNCaP and its C4-2 subline in vitro, cells were first cultured in T-medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and switched to serum-free and phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium when they reached 80% confluence. After a 3-day incubation period, cells were counted and medium was collected for immunoassay of the PSA protein. C4-2 cells consistently secreted 4–5-fold (14.9 ± 1.12versus 2.89 ± 0.22 ng/ml/106 cells) more PSA protein than LNCaP cells into the medium in the complete absence of exogenous androgen and growth factor stimulus over a 3-day period. To investigate whether the up-regulation of PSA protein in C4-2 cells occurs at the transcriptional level, a 5.8-kb PSA promoter was inserted upstream to a luciferase reporter gene (p61/pGL3) and transfected into LNCaP and C4-2 cells for transient expression analysis. In parallel with PSA secretion results, the basal PSA promoter activity in C4-2 is 18 ± 3.7-fold higher than that observed in LNCaP cells. Thus, up-regulation of PSA protein expression in C4-2 is due to a high intrinsic basal PSA promoter activity. Since the PSA promoter contains multiple AREs, the up-regulation of PSA promoter activity in C4-2 may be explained by an elevated AR protein level in this AI cell line. A Western blot analysis of AR was performed with the total cell lysate of LNCaP and C4-2 (Fig. 1). Consistent with our previously published results (32Wu H.C. Hsieh J.T. Gleave M.E. Brown N.M. Pathak S. Chung L.W. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 57: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), AR protein was found to be expressed by these two cell lines at comparable levels. Moreover, we have sequenced both the ligand-binding domain and the DNA-binding domain of AR from LNCaP and C4-2 cell lines and have identified the reported single point mutation in the ligand-binding domain (39Veldscholte J. Ris-Stalpers C. Kuiper G.G. Jenster G. Berrevoets C. Claassen E. van Rooij H.C. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Mulder E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar) in both of these cell lines without additional mutations. 2H. Yang, H. Y. E. Zhau, and L. W. K. Chung, unpublished results. Comparison of AR binding affinity and capacity between LNCaP and C4-2 cells revealed that both of these cell lines contain high affinity and capacity AR (32Wu H.C. Hsieh J.T. Gleave M.E. Brown N.M. Pathak S. Chung L.W. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 57: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Thus, neither the steady-state level of AR expression nor additional AR mutations play a role in the up-regulation of the PSA promoter activity in C4-2 cells. Deletion analysis was performed to dissect out the cis-element(s) essential for conferring high PSA promoter activity in C4-2 cells under androgen-deprived conditions. Various deletion constructs were generated by restriction enzyme digestion (Fig. 2 A). The P61-2 construct containing a deletion between ARE-II and ARE-III retains all of the wild-type promoter activity. In contrast, a 1.5-kb terminal deletion immediately proximal to AREc (p61-5) caused a 50% drop in promoter activity only in C4-2, and not in LNCaP cells (Fig. 2 A). It is possible that the deletion has partially destroyed the 5′ end of the AREc element resulting in a sharp drop of PSA promoter activity in C4-2 cells. A further decrease of promoter activity was observed in C4-2 cells when the terminal deletion extended downstream to include the AREc (p61-4). The 500-bp AREc region was then removed in p61-3 to demonstrate the effect of AREc deletion in PSA promoter activity. As indicated in Fig. 2 A, p61-3 has a similar activity to p61-4. The AREc deletion reduced the promoter activity to 14% of the 5.8-kb promoter in C4-2 cells, but again without appreciably affecting the basal PSA promoter activity in LNCaP cells. Hence, AREc is a crucial cis-element for maintaining the androgen-independent PSA promoter activity in C4-2 cells.

P., and Wells, R. D. (1999) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 274, 23468–23479). This two-plasmid recombination system in <i>Escherichia coli</i> with derivatives of pUC19 and pACYC184 was used to investigate the effect of triplet repeat orientation on recombination and extent of expansions; tracts of 36, 50, 80, and 36, 100, and 175 repeats in length, respectively, in all possible permutations of length and in both orientations (relative to the unidirectional replication origins) revealed little or no effect of orientation of expansions. The extent of expansions was generally severalfold the length of the progenitor tract and frequently exceeded the combined length of the two tracts in the cotransformed plasmids. Expansions were much more frequent than deletions. Repeat tracts bearing two G-to-A interruptions (polymorphisms) within either 171- or 219-base pair tracts substantially reduced the expansions compared with uninterrupted repeat tracts of similar lengths. Gene conversion, rather than crossing over, was the recombination mechanism. Prior studies showed that DNA replication, repair, and tandem duplication also mediated genetic instabilities of the triplet repeat sequence. However, gene conversion (recombinational repair) is by far the most powerful expansion mechanism. Thus, we propose that gene conversion is the likely expansion mechanism for myotonic dystrophy, spinocerebellar ataxia type 8, and fragile X syndrome."

HIV IN is associated with DNA binding, specific DNA endonuclease activity, DNA joining, and disintegration (see Refs. 1Hindmarsh P. Leis J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 836-843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 2Chow S.A. Vincent K.A. Ellison V. Brown P.O. Science. 1992; 233: 723-726Crossref Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The mechanism for insertion of a donor DNA into an acceptor comprises IN processing the 3′ ends of viral LTRs, which are subsequently involved in a nucleophilic attack of phosphodiester bonds in the host DNA to covalently join the two DNAs. These reactions are catalyzed by IN alone (3Katz R.A. Merkel G. Kulkosky J. Leis J. Skalka A.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 87-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 4Craigie R.

During the strand transfer reaction, the host DNA is cut in a staggered manner to create small gaps between the 5′ ends of the viral DNA and 3′ ends of host DNA. The repair of these gaps at both ends produces the direct repeats that flank the inserted viral DNA. In the case of HIV-1, the size of these duplications is 5 base pairs (8Vincent K.A. York-Higgins D. Quirogga M. Brown P.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6045-6047Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 9Vink C. Groenink M. Elgersma Y. Fouchier R.A.M. Termette M. Plasterk R.H.A. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5626-5627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During the initial processing only the 3′ ends of the LTRs are shortened by two nucleotides. The complementary nucleotides on the opposite LTR strand form a 5′ two-nucleotide overhang after the strand transfer reaction. These overhangs have to be removed after the gaps are repaired so that the covalent joining of the cellular and viral DNA can be completed. The precise enzymes responsible for these reactions are not known, although it was reported that if presented with a nicked substrate, wild type IN or its central domain (10Kulkosky J. Katz R.A. Merkel G. Skalka A.M. Virology. 1995; 206: 448-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) is capable of removing the 5′ overhang and sealing the nick in a disintegration-like reaction (2Chow S.A.

Disintegration is a polynucleotidyl transfer reaction that is relatively independent of viral DNA sequence; DNA structure rather than sequence (12Balakrishnan M. Jonsson C.B. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1025-1035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Van Den Ent F.M.I. Vink C. Plasterk R.H.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7825-7832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is the major determinant of the site of nucleophilic attack. Although the processing and joining steps require a full-length IN protein, disintegration can be performed by the isolated catalytic domain (14Bushman F.D. Engelman A. Palmer I. Wingfield P. Craigie R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3428-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). This suggests that the catalytic domain includes the active site for polynucleotidyl transfer and is consistent with the crystal structure determined for this domain, which revealed a five-strand β-sheet and six α-helices similar to other polynucleotidyl transfer enzymes (15Dyda F. Hickman A.B. Jenkins T.M. Engelman A. Craigie R. Davies D.R. Science. 1994; 266: 1981-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). In this report we demonstrate with model substrates that the combination of RT and IN is sufficient to complete all of the late steps required for integration: filling in the gap, removing the 5′ overhang, and joining the second host DNA strand to the viral DNA. However, this reaction takes place with very low efficiency. We have also examined the ability of cellular proteins such as PCNA, HMG-(I/Y), or Flap endonuclease-1 (FEN-1) (16Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) to work in concert with RT and/or IN to increase the efficiency of the reaction. None of these enzymes stimulated IN-dependent closure of a nicked substrate with an overhang, whereas the addition of FEN-1 prevented this reaction. As expected from their known specificities, FEN-1 in combination with RT and DNA ligase quantitatively produced strand closure of gapped substrates with 5′ two-nucleotide overhangs.

Terminal deoxynucleotide transferase was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. AMV RT was purchased from U.S. Biochemical Corp. HMG-(I/Y) was purified as described by Nissen and Reeves (17Nissen M.S. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4355-4360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Vent DNA polymerase (2 units/μl) and T4 DNA ligase (400 units/μl) were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Nitrocellulose filters (Type US, 0.025 μm) were from Millipore Corp. (Bedford, MA). Oligodeoxyribonucleotides were purchased from Genosys Biotechnologies Inc. (The Woodlands, TX). Oligodeoxyribonucleotides were purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by reverse phase chromatography as described previously (18Aiyar A. Hindmarsh P. Skalka A.M. Leis J.

The U5 3AC4, U55GA6, and U54CGAT7 oligodeoxyribonucleotides were used to prepare HIV-1 donor concerted DNA integration substrates with mutations in the U5 terminus sequence. In each case, the sequence refers to the 3′ cleaved strand of the U5 LTR IN recognition sequence. The U5seq and U3seq oligodeoxyribonucleotides were used as sequencing primers. The U3seq primer is complementary to plasmid πvx nucleotides 312–326, and the U5 seq primer is complementary to plasmid πvx nucleotides 116–130. The strands A, B, C, and D refer to the duplex substrates described in Fig. 1. Model HIV-1 gapped substrates (see Fig. 1 B) were prepared by annealing strands A, B, and D. Nicked HIV-1 or ASV substrates were formed by substituting the respective strand C for D. For the HIV-1 mutant LTR substrates 4, 5, and 6 (see Fig. 1 A), the respective mutated strands A and B were substituted for the wild type strands A and B. Oligos were labeled either at the 5′ end (strands B or C) or at the 3′ end (strand B). The 5′ end was labeled with [γ-33P]ATP and T4 polynuleotide kinase (10 units/50 pmol of oligo). The 3′ end was labeled with [α-32P]ddATP and TdT as described by the manufacturer. Labeled oligos were purified by 20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The labeled strand was annealed with a 3-fold molar excess of unlabeled complimentary strands in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, by heating to 95 °C for 5 min followed by slow cooling to room temperature. Annealing was confirmed by the change in migration of the labeled oligos as analyzed by electrophoresis in nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. A 3-fold excess of the unlabeled complimentary strands resulted in >95% duplex formation (data not shown). Size markers for gel analysis are prepared by partial digestion of 5′33P-labeled oligodeoxyribonucleotides (39-mer and 21-mer) with snake venom phosphodiesterase, as described (19Katzman M. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Leis J. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 5319-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Escherichia coli DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.) and MC1061/P3 (Invitrogen) strains were used for these studies. MC1061/P3 is a derivative of MC1061 containing the episome, P3, which can be selected by the presence of an encoded Kanr gene. In addition, P3 possessesamp (Am) and tet (Am) genes. The expression of these genes can be rescued by the supF amber suppressor tRNA. Under these conditions, MC1061/P3 can be selected for ampicillin, tetracycline, and kanamycin resistance. Plasmid pHHIV2, which was used in this study as a template to amplify donor DNA, is a variation of pBCSK+ in which a wild type HIV-1 donor DNA polymerase chain reaction product was inserted into pBCSK+catalyzed by IN, resulting in the loss of 2 base pairs from the LTR ends. This plasmid was propagated in E. coli MC1061/P3 under the conditions described above. The integration acceptor was plasmid pBCSK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), which was propagated inE. coli DH5α. Plasmids were purified with Qiaprep columns (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions. The growth of DH5α containing pBCSK+ was selected for by addition of chloramphenicol (35 μg/ml). Integration donor DNA were amplified by using thermostable Vent DNA polymerase and the primers listed above. 25 pmol of each primer and 50 ng of pHHIV2 DNA as the template were used for each polymerase chain reaction. Vent DNA polymerase was used according to manufacturer's instructions. A total of 20 rounds of amplification were performed in each reaction. The amplification conditions were 94 °C for 2 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min for three rounds. This was followed by amplification conditions that used 94 °C for 2 min, 57 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 45 s for 17 additional rounds. The resultant product donor DNA was isolated after electrophoresis through 2% agarose gels equilibrated with 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA (6Hindmarsh P. Ridky T. Reeves R. Andrake M. Skalka A.M. Leis J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2994-3003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purified DNA (600 ng) was recovered using Qiaex-II resin (Qiagen) and then precipitated with ethanol. The recovered DNA was suspended in either TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) or deionized distilled water. The integration donors, which were approximately 300 base pairs in length, were internally labeled during the polymerase chain reaction by the inclusion of [α-32P]dCTP. The final concentrations of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates during amplification reactions were 0.25 mm each of unlabeled dATP, dGTP, and dTTP. The final dCTP concentration was 0.0502 mm (12 Ci/mmol, 0.6 mCi/ml). Overhang cleavage activity of FEN-1 was examined in a 15-μl reaction containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm βME, 145 μg/ml BSA, and 1 pmol of substrate. Where indicated, 5 ng of FEN-1, 500 ng of PCNA, 5 pmol of IN, or 110 μg of HIV-1 RT and 10 μm deoxyribonucleotides were added. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 16 μl of 95% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml bromphenol blue, and 0.1 mg/ml xylene cyanole. The tubes were heated to 95 °C for 5 min and loaded onto a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The reaction products were visualized by autoradiography. The coupled gap repair by RT and overhang removal by FEN-1 was assayed in a 15-μl reaction containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm βME, 145 μg/ml BSA, 10 μmdeoxyribonucleotides, and 1 pmol of substrate. Where indicated, 5 ng of FEN-1, T4 DNA ligase (400 units), and T4 DNA ligase buffer, HIV-1 RT (110 μg), or AMV RT (2 units) were added. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 16 μl of 95% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml bromphenol blue, and 1 mg/ml xylene cyanole. The reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis using denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gels. Bands were detected by autoradiography. Cleavage/ligation activity of IN was examined in a 15-μl reaction containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm βME, 145 μg/ml BSA, 6% dimethyl sulfoxide, and 10 pmol of substrate and HIV-1 IN. HMG-(I/Y) (200 ng) was added as indicated. Reaction products were extracted with phenol-chloroform, and oligos were precipitated from ethanol. The products were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described above. The repair of model substrates by viral enzymes was examined in a 15-μl reaction containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm βME, 145 μg/ml BSA, 10 μm dNTPs, 10 pmol of substrate, and HIV-1 RT or AMV RT. The reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C followed by a 30-min drop dialysis against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, using floating nitrocellulose filters (type US, 0.025 μm) as described (20Marusyk R. Sergeant A. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 105: 403-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). 10 μl of the reaction was recovered after dialysis, to which was added 5 μl containing 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmβME, 145 μg/ml BSA, 6% dimethyl sulfoxide, and 10 pmol of HIV-1 IN as indicated. The final reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by addition of 16 μl of 95% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml bromphenol blue, 1 mg/ml xylene cyanole, and reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis using 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gels as described above. The concerted integration reaction conditions were similar to those described by Hindmarsh et al. (6Hindmarsh P. Ridky T. Reeves R. Andrake M. Skalka A.M. Leis J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2994-3003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 15 ng (0.15 pmol of ends) of donor DNA was mixed with 50 ng of acceptor DNA (0.02 pmol) and 175 ng of HIV-1 IN (2.5 pmol) in a 8.5-μl preincubation reaction mixture containing, at final concentrations, 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 23 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5% polyethylene glycol 8000, 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1% glycerol, 1.6 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, and 3.3 mm EDTA. The IN was diluted in a buffer containing 30% glycerol, 0.5 mNaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA. Where specified 100 ng of HMG-(I/Y) was added to the reaction mixtures. The preincubation reaction mixtures were placed on ice overnight. The volume of each preincubation mixture was then increased to 10 μl with the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 7.5 mm, and the integration assay mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The reactions were stopped by increasing the volume to 150 μl by the addition of EDTA (final concentration, 4.25 mm), sodium dodecyl sulfate (final concentration, 0.44%), and proteinase K (final concentration, 0.06 mg/ml). After digestion for 60 min at 37 °C, the reaction mixtures were extracted with phenol followed by phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1 mixture). 15 μl of 3m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, was added along with 1 μl of glycogen (10 mg/ml stock solution). The reaction products were precipitated by the addition of 450 μl of 100% ethanol and washed twice with 70% ethanol prior to electrophoresis and autoradiography. The reaction products were separated on a 1% agarose gel run in 0.5× Tris borate, EDTA, and ethidium bromide at 10 V/cm for 2 h. Following electrophoresis, gels were submerged in 5% trichloroacetic acid for 20 min or until the bromphenol blue dye turned bright yellow. After being washed with water, the gels were dried on DE-81 paper (Whatman) in a Bio-Rad slab gel dryer at 80 °C for approximately 2 h under vacuum. The dried gels were exposed to autoradiographic film overnight at −80 °C in a film cassette with GAFMED TA-3 or Kodak mid speed screens. In all experiments, integration products pooled from several separate reactions were used directly for transformation of bacteria. The integration products were introduced into E. coli MC1061/P3 by electroporation, using a Bio-Rad electroporator with 0.1-cm electroporation cuvettes, 1.8-kV voltage, 25-microfarad capacitance, and 200-ohm resistance. The P3 episome is maintained at a low copy number. Therefore, only 40 μg/ml of ampicillin, 15 μg/ml of kanamycin, or 10 μg/ml of tetracycline were required for selection. Under these conditions, we detected no colonies after supF selection when the donor, acceptor, or donor and acceptor were electroporated into cells in the absence of IN. Plasmid DNAs were recovered from individual clones, and integration junctions were sequenced by using primers U3seq (for sequencing the U3 junction) and U5seq (for sequencing the U5 junction). Sequencing was performed using the Thermo-Sequenase kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). In the present study, we have employed a series of model HIV-1 and ASV oligodeoxyribonucleotide substrates to examine the action of viral and/or cellular enzymes in catalyzing the repair and strand closure reactions associated with integration of viral DNA. The substrates contain HIV-1 or ASV U5 LTR terminal sequences in which the conserved CA dinucleotide is covalently linked to an acceptor DNA sequence. Substrate 1 in Fig. 1 A depicts a simplified HIV-1 integration intermediate with a gap in only one of two strands, representing a single viral-host DNA junction. For this substrate, the gap is five nucleotides in length. The U5 HIV-1 LTR upper strand also contains at its 5′ end a two-nucleotide mismatch. To obtain fully repaired covalently closed DNA, the gap in substrate 1 has to be repaired, the 5′ overhang has to be excised, and the resultant nick has to be sealed. Substrate 2 in Fig. 1 A represents an HIV-1 DNA intermediate in which the gap is already repaired to form a nick but still contains the two-nucleotide 5′ overhang. Substrate 3 is comparable with substrate 2 but contains the ASV instead of the HIV-1 U5 LTR sequence, and the gap is six rather than five nucleotides in length. We have also examined several HIV-1 substrate variants in which base pair inversions were introduced at LTR positions 3–7, adjacent to and/or including the conserved CA dinucleotide. The number system used here refers to the ends of the unintegrated LTRs where the CA dinucleotide is at positions 3 and 4. Substrate 4 (Fig. 1 A) contains a 2-base pair substitution in the HIV-1 U5 LTR IN recognition sequences at positions 5 and 6. Substrate 5 and 6 contain base pair inversions at positions 4–7 and 3 and 4, respectively. For ease of discussion, we refer to the bottom covalently linked LTR cell DNA strand (36 mer) as strand A (Fig. 1 B). Strand B refers to the upper LTR strand with the two-nucleotide 5′ overhang (21-mer). Strand D refers to the upper cell DNA strand (12-mer) that serves as the primer to fill in the gap. Strand C (17-mer) represents the same strand as D, but to which repair of the gap has occurred to form a nick (Fig. 1 B). By placing a radioactive label on the 5′ or 3′ ends of the different strands B–D, we can examine gap repair, overhang removal, or ligation reactions independent of one another. To look for activities that would remove the two-nucleotide 5′ overhang, the HIV-1 gapped substrate 1 (Fig. 1 A) was prepared with a 5′33P end label on strand B. This substrate was incubated with different viral and/or cellular enzymes, and the gel electrophoresis analysis of the products is shown in Fig. 2. Incubation with purified HIV-1 RT in the presence or absence of deoxynucleotides (data not shown) or with IN (Fig. 2 A, lane 7) failed to release the mismatched nucleotides. In contrast and as a control, the addition of FEN-1, which is known to remove 5′ overhang strands from duplexes, resulted in the endonucleolytic release of the 5′ 33P label as a series of bands representing dimers to hexamers and/or larger products (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). The most abundant product was a tetranucleotide, even though the initial mismatch was only two nucleotides in length. The addition of PCNA to the reaction resulted in the release of larger 5′ labeled fragments (Fig. 2 A, lane 3), whereas the addition of HIV-1 RT and/or IN did not influence the removal of the overhang strand (Fig. 2 A, lanes 4 and 5). If unlabeled deoxynucleotides were added to the reaction with RT, a 22-mer 5′ end labeled product was observed, because of a nontemplated addition reaction to the 3′ end of the stand B (Fig. 2 A, lanes 5 and 6). If a nicked substrate with a 5′33P-labeled two-nucleotide overhang (Fig. 1 A, Substrate 2) was substituted for substrate 1, FEN-1 released the 5′ overhang, but the predominate product in this case was a dinucleotide. Some mononucleotides were detected (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2 and 3). The presence of HIV-1 IN had no significant effect on FEN-1-mediated removal of the 5′ mismatched sequences (Fig. 2 B, lane 4). To confirm the size of FEN-1 released products as well as to follow the exonuclease activity of FEN-1, strand B was prepared with a 3′ 32P end label (22-mer). In the presence of FEN-1, the 22-mer was converted to a series of smaller oligos ranging in size from 20 to 17 nucleotides or smaller (Fig. 2 C). A 21-mer was not detected. Although FEN-1 has the ability to release products greater than two nucleotides in length, we asked whether there was a transient formation of a nick that could be trapped by DNA ligase. Substrate 2 with a 3′ end label on strand B (22-mer) was incubated with FEN-1 in the presence or absence of T4 DNA ligase (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 3, respectively). In the presence of both FEN-1 and ligase (lane 2), there was a quantitative conversion of the 22-mer to a ligated 37-mer product that would represent a covalent fusion of strands B and C. This indicates that a nick had formed in all of these substrates that could be sealed by ligase. It has been reported that integrase alone is able to remove the overhang and seal the break with a substrate that contained a 5′ overhang at a nick via a “disintegration-like” reaction (2Chow S.A. Vincent K.A. Ellison V. Brown P.O. Science. 1992; 233: 723-726Crossref Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 10Kulkosky J. Katz R.A. Merkel G. Skalka A.M.

We therefore incubated substrate 2 with a 3′ 32P end label on strand B (22-mer) and looked for the appearance of a 37-mer product. As shown in Fig. 4 A (lane 3) a small percentage (1–2%) of the labeled 22-mer was converted to the expected covalently linked 37-mer product by the action of HIV-1 IN. If FEN-1 was added along with IN to this reaction, the 37-mer product was no longer detected (Fig. 4 A, lane 2). We further explored the specificity of the above trans-esterification reaction by presenting HIV IN with a nicked substrate mimicking the host DNA-U5 LTR junction of an ASV integration intermediate (substrate 3) again with the label introduced at the 3′ end of strand B. The results are shown in Fig. 4 B. Because strand B is a 16-mer in this substrate, the expected size of the covalently closed product would be a 32-mer. As shown in Fig. 4 B (lane 2), a 32-mer was detected. The extent of the reaction was similar to that observed with the HIV-1 model substrate shown in panel A. We confirmed that HIV-1 IN catalyzed both overhang removal and ligation by using substrate 3, which contained a 5′ 33P-end label introduced on strand C (18-mer). The expected product in this case would be a 31-mer, which was detected as shown in Fig. 4 C (lane 2).Figure 5Effect of base pair inversions in HIV-1 U5 LTR on various steps in the integration reaction.

Here we provide two lines of evidence from chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments that XIST RNA physically associates with the Xi chromatin. First, XIST RNA can be co-precipitated by antiserum against macroH2A, a histone H2A variant enriched in the Xi. Second, XIST RNA can be co-precipitated by antisera that recognize unacetylated, but not acetylated, isoforms of histones H3 and H4. The specificity ofXIST RNA association with hypoacetylated chromatin, together with the previous finding that hypoacetylated histone H4 is enriched at promoters of X-inactivated genes, raises the possibility that XIST RNA may contribute to the hypoacetylation of specific regions of the Xi so as to alter the expression of X-linked genes.

Hendrich B.D. Rupert J.L. Lafreniere R.G. Xing Y. Lawrence J. Willard H.F. Cell. 1992; 71: 527-542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). Mouse X chromosomes with targeted deletions of the Xist gene lose the ability to undergo X inactivation (2Penny G.D. Kay G.F. Sheardown S.A. Rastan S. Brockdorff N. Nature. 1996; 379: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 3Marahrens Y. Panning B. Dausman J. Strauss W. Jaenisch R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). In addition, ectopic expression of Xist RNA from multicopy transgenes during embryonic stem cell differentiation causes autosomes to exhibit features typically associated with X inactivation, such as late replication, histone H4 hypoacetylation, and transcriptional down-regulation (4Lee J.T. Strauss W.M. Dausman J.A. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1996; 86: 83-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 5Herzing L.B. Romer J.T. Horn J.M. Ashworth A. Nature. 1997; 386: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that the Xistlocus is required for X inactivation, but they do not distinguish between several possible modes of Xist action; one model is that the Xist genomic locus serves as a chromatin organizing region that, when transcribed, initiates changes in chromatin structure that are propagated in cis along the length of the Xi chromosome (6Brockdorff N. Ashworth A. Kay G.F. McCabe V.M. Norris D.P. Cooper P.J. Swift S. Rastan S. Cell. 1992; 71: 515-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). An alternative model is that the noncoding RNA expressed from the Xist gene is functional and directly participates in the silencing process (1Brown C.J. Hendrich B.D. Rupert J.L. Lafreniere R.G. Xing Y. Lawrence J. Willard H.F. Cell. 1992; 71: 527-542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). One observation suggesting that the XIST transcript may directly participate in silencing comes from fluorescence in situ hybridization experiments that show that XIST RNA colocalizes with the inactive X chromosome (1Brown C.J. Hendrich B.D. Rupert J.L. Lafreniere R.G. Xing Y. Lawrence J. Willard H.F. Cell. 1992; 71: 527-542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar, 7Clemson C.M. McNeil J.A. Willard H.F. Lawrence J.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 259-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). However, the limited resolution of microscopy analysis does not provide any information on the molecular basis or the consequences of this colocalization. To examine the nature of the colocalization between XIST RNA and the Xi chromatin, the chromatin IP assay was used to precipitate chromatin from human female cells and then RT-PCR was performed to determine whether XIST RNA was co-precipitated. The results indicate that XIST RNA is indeed co-precipitated with chromatin by antibodies directed against several histone species. Significantly, XIST RNA was co-precipitated with antibodies against unacetylated, but not acetylated, histones H3 and H4. Given the previous finding that histone H4 is hypoacetylated at promoters of X-inactivated genes (8Gilbert S.L. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999; 96: 13825-13830Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), these results raise the possibility thatXIST RNA may be associated with promoters of silenced genes, as well as other hypoacetylated regions of the Xi. 10-cm plates of confluent cells were incubated in PBS containing 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C. Chromatin immunoprecipitations were then performed using various polyclonal antisera as described previously (8Gilbert S.L. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999; 96: 13825-13830Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 9Alberts A.S. Geneste O. Treisman R. Cell. 1998; 92: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Briefly, sonication of cross-linked nuclei was performed in a cup horn (Branson Sonifier 450) under conditions that gave a range in DNA fragments from 200–1000 bps. Sonicated nuclear lysates were precleared and incubated with the following antisera: anti-histone H3 or H4 antibodies (10 μl; Upstate Biotechnology), anti-AcH3 or -AcH4 antibodies (5 μl; Upstate Biotechnology), or affinity-purified, polyclonal anti-macroH2A1.2 antiserum (5 μl; see Ref. 10Costanzi C. Pehrson J.R. Nature. 1998; 393: 599-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). The specificity of the anti-acetylated antibodies was confirmed in quality control testing by the manufacturer, as treatment of cells with the deacetylase inhibitor sodium butyrate greatly enhanced detection of the acetylated forms of histones H3 and H4 in immunoblot analysis of acid-extracted proteins. Further demonstration that the antibodies are specific in the chromatin IP assay comes from our previous work, in which antibodies against acetylated histone H4 were specifically unable to immunoprecipitate detectable levels of promoter-specific sequences of X-inactivated genes, whereas they were able to immunoprecipitate many other X-linked sequences (8Gilbert S.L. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999; 96: 13825-13830Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The specificity of the anti-macroH2A1.2 antibodies has been previously demonstrated by immunoblot analysis from a variety of cell types, including mouse liver cells (10Costanzi C. Pehrson J.R. Nature. 1998; 393: 599-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), undifferentiated and differentiated mouse embryonic stem cells (11Mermoud J.E. Costanzi C. Pehrson J.R. Brockdorff N. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1399-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and mouse blastocysts (12Costanzi C. Stein P. Worrad D.M. Schultz R.M. Pehrson J.R. Development. 2000; 127: 2283-2289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One-tenth of the chromatin immunoprecipitate was added to a 20-μl reaction mix containing 1.5 mmMgCl2, 50 mm potassium chloride, 10 mm Tris, pH 9.0, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 μmeach primer, 0.1 mm dNTPs, and 1 Unit of Taqpolymerase. After denaturation at 95 °C for 1.5 min, 30 cycles of PCR were performed where each cycle consisted of 1 min at 95 °C, 45 s at 60 °C, and 45 s at 72 °C. Products were then resolved on 4% NuSieve-agarose (FMC BioProducts) gels. PCR primer sequences were as follows: ZFX forward (5′-GTGCTGTGTTAAAGGATAGC-3′) and reverse (5′-AGGAGCCCAATTGGGTATGG-3′);SB1.8 3A (5′-AGGCATAGTGATGCTCCTGT-3′) and 4A (5′-CGATGTTTTTGAGATCTGTGC-3′), as described previously (13Brown C.J. Carrel L. Willard H.F. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 60: 1333-1343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar);RPS4X forward (5′-TGAGATGGATTGAATGTGGC-3′) and reverse (5′-TTAAAGAGGGTGCCCAGGTA-3′); and UBE1 forward (5′-AGTTTGTGGAGCGAACACTG-3′) and reverse (5′-TGCCGGATGTTGTTCGAGTA-3′). Chromatin immunoprecipitates were subjected to first strand cDNA synthesis using random primers and M-MLV RT (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacturer's instructions. One-quarter of the first strand synthesis was added to PCR reactions using the conditions described above. The following primer sets were used: XIST s1 (5′-CTCCAGATAGCTGGCAACC-3′) andXIST s2 (5′-AGCTCCTCGGACAGCTGTAA-3′), as described previously (13Brown C.J. Carrel L. Willard H.F. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 60: 1333-1343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); FIBRONECTIN forward (5′-TGATCATGCTGCTGGGACTT-3′) and reverse (5′-TGTGCCTCTCACACTTCCAC-3′); and 18 S forward (5′-TGCATGTCTAAGTACGCACG-3′) and reverse (5′-CCGGGTTGGTTTTGATCTGAT-3′). The 293 cell line was grown on slides that were incubated on ice for 30 s in Cytoskeletal Buffer (100 mm sodium chloride, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8), followed by a 30-s incubation in Cytoskeletal Buffer with 0.5% Triton X-100 and another 30-s incubation in Cytoskeletal Buffer. Slides were fixed in 4% PBS-buffered paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, quenched in PBS containing 0.2% Tween, and incubated in PBS blocking buffer that contained 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% Tween. The primary antibody was diluted 1:100 in blocking buffer and incubated with cells for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by washes with PBS/Tween and incubation with rhodamine-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cappel) for another hour at 37 °C. Slides were again washed with PBS/Tween, counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories), and viewed with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 immunofluorescence microscope. To investigate whether XIST RNA directly associates with the chromatin of the Xi, we used the chromatin IP/RT-PCR (ChIP/RT-PCR) assay, which is a variation of the previously described chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay (8Gilbert S.L. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999; 96: 13825-13830Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 14Braunstein M. Rose A.B. Holmes S.G. Allis C.D. Broach J.R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 592-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Chromatin fragments of 200–1000 bp in length were generated by sonication and immunoprecipitated with antibodies against known components of the Xi chromatin. After DNase digestion, immunoprecipitates were subjected to RT-PCR to assay for the presence of XIST RNA. The first antibodies used in the co-precipitation analysis were directed against macroH2A, a histone H2A variant. This protein is highly enriched in the Xi (10Costanzi C. Pehrson J.R. Nature. 1998; 393: 599-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), and this enrichment is dependent on continued expression of the Xist locus in differentiated cells (15Csankovszki G. Panning B. Bates B. Pehrson J.R. Jaenisch R. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 323-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence microscopy with polyclonal antibodies directed against the major splice variant of macroH2A confirmed that macroH2A was enriched in the two Xi chromosomes of 293 cells, a human female cell line that contains three X chromosomes (Fig.1 a). This pattern of staining, which is consistent with previous immunofluorescence reports (10Costanzi C. Pehrson J.R. Nature. 1998; 393: 599-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), provides a measure of antibody specificity. Further specificity controls with these antibodies were provided previously by immunoblot analysis in a variety of cell types, including mouse liver cells (10Costanzi C. Pehrson J.R. Nature. 1998; 393: 599-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), mouse embryonic stem cells (11Mermoud J.E. Costanzi C. Pehrson J.R. Brockdorff N. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1399-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and mouse preimplantation embryos (12Costanzi C. Stein P. Worrad D.M. Schultz R.M. Pehrson J.R. Development. 2000; 127: 2283-2289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When these anti-macroH2A antibodies were used in the chromatin IP/RT-PCR assay, they co-precipitated XIST RNA from 293 cells (Fig. 1 b, lane 5). The primers used in this assay are capable of distinguishing XIST RNA from genomic DNA, because they span two introns that are alternatively spliced to generate cDNA products of either 179 or 242 bps in length. Fig.1 b, lane 4 confirms that the PCR products were dependent upon the presence of reverse transcriptase. This indicates that the signal is due to co-precipitation of splicedXIST RNA rather than XIST genomic DNA. The specificity of anti-macroH2A antiserum in recovering XISTRNA was further demonstrated by control assays for the chromatin IP/RT-PCR, in which the abundantly expressed FIBRONECTINmRNA was not co-precipitated with anti-macroH2A antisera, although this mRNA did survive the cross-linking and sonication procedure (data not shown). We next examined whether XIST RNA could be recovered by antisera directed against other chromatin proteins. Histone hypoacetylation has been shown to feature prominently in X inactivation; microscopy studies have shown that histones H2A, H3, and H4 are underacetylated in the Xi as compared with other chromosomes (16Jeppesen P. Turner B.M. Cell. 1993; 74: 281-289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 17Belyaev N. Keohane A.M. Turner B.M. Hum. Genet. 1996; 97: 573-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Boggs B.A. Connors B. Sobel R.E. Chinault A.C. Allis C.D. Chromosoma (Berl. ). 1996; 105: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have recently shown by chromatin IP analysis from somatic cell hybrids containing a human Xi that histone H4 hypoacetylation is restricted to promoter regions of X-inactivated genes, whereas regions downstream of these promoters show a moderate level of acetylation (8Gilbert S.L. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999; 96: 13825-13830Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Antibodies capable of distinguishing between the acetylated and unacetylated isoforms of histones H3 and H4 were used to immunoprecipitate chromatin from 293 cells. The specificity of these antibodies was previously demonstrated in two ways. First, the manufacturer performed quality control testing, in which treatment of cells with the deacetylase inhibitor sodium butyrate greatly enhanced detection of the acetylated isoforms of histones H3 and H4 in immunoblot analysis of acid-extracted proteins. Second, our previous work showed that the antibodies against acetylated histone H4 were specifically unable to immunoprecipitate detectable levels of promoter-specific sequences of X-inactivated genes, whereas they were capable of immunoprecipitating many other X-linked sequences (8Gilbert S.L. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999; 96: 13825-13830Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). After performing immunoprecipitations with these antibodies, the resulting immunoprecipitates were subjected to RT-PCR to examine whetherXIST RNA was also recovered. The results demonstrate that spliced XIST RNA was co-precipitated by the antibodies against unacetylated H3 and H4 (Fig.2 a, lane 6 and Fig.2 b, lane 2). In contrast, XIST RNA was not co-precipitated by antibodies against acetylated H3 and H4 (Fig.2 a, lane 8 and Fig. 2 b, lane 3). Sequencing analysis confirmed the identity of the 242-bp band in Fig. 2 a, lane 6 and of the 179-bp band in Fig.2 b, lane 2 (data not shown). The precipitation profile suggests that this region of XIST RNA physically associates with unacetylated regions of the Xi chromatin. The abundantly expressed FIBRONECTIN mRNA, as well as 18 S rRNA, provided specificity controls for the H4 immunoprecipitations. Antibodies against either acetylated or unacetylated histone H4 failed to recover FIBRONECTIN mRNA or 18 S rRNA, despite the fact that these transcripts were still detectable in total input nuclear RNA after sonication (data not shown). This suggests that the ability of antibodies against unacetylated histones to co-precipitateXIST RNA is specific and not an in vitro artifact due to nonspecific interactions between histones and RNA molecules. Chromatin IPs performed in parallel with antibodies against histones H3 and H4 in their acetylated and unacetylated states indicated that the antibodies were indeed efficient in precipitating chromatin from 293 cells, which contain one active and two inactive X chromosomes. Although antibodies against unacetylated histone H4 immunoprecipitated X-linked chromatin with reduced efficiency (Fig. 2 c,lane 5), these antibodies were able to recoverXIST RNA, whereas the more efficient antibodies against acetylated H4 did not (Fig. 2 b). This experiment shows that the recovery of XIST RNA by some antisera but not others cannot be attributed to differences in their efficiency of precipitating chromatin. Finally, we showed that, as expected,XIST RNA was not recovered from BJEH human male cells (19Hahn W.C. Counter C.M. Lundberg A.S. Beijersbergen R.L. Brooks M.W. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1999; 400: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1979) Google Scholar), which do not express this RNA, by any of the anti-histone antisera (data not shown). This control rules out the possibility that the RT-PCR signal is attributable to contaminating RNAs introduced by the antibodies. Microscopy studies have shown that XIST RNA colocalizes with the Xi (1Brown C.J. Hendrich B.D. Rupert J.L. Lafreniere R.G. Xing Y. Lawrence J. Willard H.F. Cell. 1992; 71: 527-542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar, 7Clemson C.M. McNeil J.A. Willard H.F. Lawrence J.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 259-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Our results further demonstrate that this colocalization is likely the result of a physical association of processed XIST RNA with the Xi chromatin. Significantly, the data shows that XIST RNA preferentially associates with hypoacetylated histones H3 and H4. This strongly suggests thatXIST RNA is associated with hypoacetylated regions of the Xi. This may include the hypoacetylated promoters of X-inactivated genes (8Gilbert S.L. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999; 96: 13825-13830Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), as well as additional hypoacetylated regions of the Xi. A previous report suggested that XIST RNA was not an integral component of the Xi chromatin, as it remained with the nuclear matrix after near-complete removal of chromosomal DNA (7Clemson C.M. McNeil J.A. Willard H.F. Lawrence J.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 259-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). However, this observation was made after treating nuclei with a stringent set of conditions, including high salt and detergent, which may have dissociated XIST-containing complexes. Hence, these observations may not be inconsistent with the findings reported here, in which formaldehyde cross-linking had been used to stabilize protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions. The cross-linking step, if performed too extensively, could produce nonspecific coimmunoprecipitations, but it appears that this was not the case. The specificity of the cross-linking is shown by the fact that whereas antibodies against both acetylated and unacetylated histones H3 and H4 were capable of recovering chromatin, only the antibodies against unacetylated histones recovered XIST RNA. Nevertheless, this result does not address the nature of the association between XIST RNA and chromatin, which may be either direct or mediated through bridging factors. The finding that XIST RNA is associated with hypoacetylated regions of the Xi chromatin in human cells suggests the possibility that it may nucleate the assembly of ribonucleoprotein complexes that possess chromatin modifying activity. One apparent example of such a system is Drosophila dosage compensation. Here, X-linked gene expression is equalized by a converse strategy in which transcription is up-regulated from most genes on the single male X. This transcriptional up-regulation coincides with chromatin remodeling, whereby the male X acquires a rare acetylation of lysine 16 on histone H4, as well as a diffuse microscopic appearance (20Bone J.R. Lavender J. Richman R. Palmer M.J. Turner B.M. Kuroda M.I. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 21Turner B.M. Birley A.J. Lavender J. Cell. 1992; 69: 375-384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Genetic analysis has identified several MSL (male-specific lethal) proteins that are essential for both dosage compensation and the site-specific histone acetylation (20Bone J.R. Lavender J. Richman R. Palmer M.J. Turner B.M. Kuroda M.I. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 22Hilfiker A. Hilfiker-Kleiner D. Pannuti A. Lucchesi J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2054-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). One of the MSL proteins, Mof, is homologous to histone acetyltransferases, supporting the notion that the MSL complex may function to covalently modify nucleosomes on the regulated male X (23Gu W. Szauter P. Lucchesi J.C. Dev. Genet. 1998; 22: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These MSL proteins assemble into complexes that bind to hundreds of sites along the polytene male X in a reproducible pattern (24Kelley R.L. Meller V.H. Gordadze P.R. Roman G. Davis R.L. Kuroda M.I. Cell. 1999; 98: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that localization of the MSL complex is mediated by the noncoding RNAs (roX1 and roX2) expressed from the male X that provide nucleation sites for assembly of the MSL complexes and their subsequent spreading in cisalong the male X (25Meller V.H. Gordadze P.R. Park Y. Chu X. Stuckenholz C. Kelley R.L. Kuroda M.I. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 136-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). By analogy to the mechanism of dosage compensation employed byDrosophila, it is possible that expression ofXIST RNA from the Xi nucleates the assembly of ribonucleoprotein complexes that possess chromatin modifying activity, as well as the spread of these complexes along the Xi incis. The observation that macroH2A localization to the Xi is dependent upon XIST RNA expression suggests thatXIST RNA may play a role in recruiting macroH2A to the Xi (15Csankovszki G. Panning B. Bates B. Pehrson J.R. Jaenisch R. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 323-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Consistent with a possible interaction between XISTRNA and the macroH2A protein is the observation that macroH2A contains a putative RNA-binding domain (26Pehrson J.R. Fuji R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2837-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). If the XIST-containing complexes indeed assemble on the Xi chromatin, one possible function of these complexes may be to mediate the promoter-specific hypoacetylation of histone H4, which correlates with X inactivation in somatic cell hybrids (8Gilbert S.L. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999; 96: 13825-13830Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1984675480,"Retroviral integration is mediated by viral preintegration complexes (PICs), and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) PICs treated with high salt lose their in vitrointegration activity. Barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF) is a host protein that efficiently restores PIC activity, but the mechanism(s) by which BAF participates in HIV-1 integration remains largely unknown. Here we developed a gel shift assay to study BAF DNA binding, and analyzed 14 mutant proteins containing substitutions of conserved residues for binding and PIC reconstitution activities. Although wild-type BAF efficiently bound double-stranded DNA, binding to single-stranded DNA, RNA, or an RNA/DNA hybrid was not detected, suggesting that BAF associates with retroviral cDNA relatively late during reverse transcription. Although some of the BAF mutant proteins efficiently bound DNA, others were defective for binding. Mutants that bound DNA efficiently reconstituted HIV-1 integration, even though in one case binding was just 0.2% of wild-type BAF. Although misfolded mutants did not reconstitute integration, a structurally intact DNA binding-defective mutant displayed partial activity at high BAF concentration. We therefore conclude that both BAF protein structure and its DNA binding activity play roles in reconstituting HIV-1 integration in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1971457109,"Our previous work (Dudenhöffer et al., 1999) unveiled a link between the capacity of p53 to regulate homologous recombination processes and to specifically bind to heteroduplex junction DNAs. Here, we show that p53 participates in ternary complex formation after preassembly of nucleoproteins, consisting of the human recombinase hRad51 and junction DNA. The cancer-related mutant p53(273H), which is defective in inhibiting recombination processes, displays a reduced capacity to associate with hRad51-DNA complexes, even under conditions which support DNA-binding. This suggests that hRad51-p53 contacts play a role in targeting p53 to heteroduplex joints and indicates an involvement in recombination immediately following hRad51-mediated strand transfer. To study the initial phase of strand exchange, when heteroduplex joints arise, we applied oligonucleotide based strand transfer assays. We observed that hRad51 stimulates exonucleolytic DNA degradation by p53, when it generates strand transfer intermediates. In agreement with this observation, artificial 3-stranded junction DNAs, designed to mimic nascent recombination intermediates, were found to represent preferred exonuclease substrates, especially when comprising a mismatch within the heteroduplex part. From our data, we propose a model according to which, p53-dependent correction of DNA exchange events is triggered by high-affinity binding to joint molecules and by stabilizing contacts with hRad51 oligomers.

A central role in the photosynthetic process is played by the photosynthetic reaction center (RC),1 an integral membrane protein-pigment complex. The RCs from purple bacteria, which catalyze the light-induced reduction of ubiquinone to ubihydroquinone (or ubiquinol) involving the uptake of two protons from the cytoplasm and the oxidation of cytochrome c2in the periplasm, are the best characterized membrane protein complexes (see Refs. 1Blankenship, R.

The RC of the non-sulfur purple bacteriumRhodopseudomonas (Rp., more recently suggested to be reclassified as Blastochloris (5Hiraishi A. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1997; 47: 217-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar)) viridis is composed of four polypeptides, namely the L, M, H, and C (a tightly bound tetra-heme cytochrome c) subunits (6Thornber J.P. Cogdell R.J. Seftor R.E. Webster G.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 593: 60-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and fourteen cofactors (four heme molecules, four bacteriochlorophyll b, two bacteriopheophytin b, one carotenoid, one non-heme iron, and two quinones, as described previously (7Deisenhofer J. Michel H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2149-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). The four heme molecules are covalently bound by the C subunit, and all other cofactors are non-covalently bound by the L and M subunits. The complex has eleven membrane-spanning helices, five in the L, five in the M, and one in the H subunit. Large parts of the L and M subunits and their associated cofactors are related by a 2-fold rotational symmetry axis perpendicular to the plane of the membrane (7Deisenhofer J. Michel H.

This proton transport produces a transmembrane electrochemical potential that drives ATP synthesis through the ATP synthase (17Mitchell P. Science. 1979; 206: 1148-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). The electrons that are released upon quinol re-oxidation are cycled back to the reaction center via a small soluble protein, cytochromec2 (18Meyer T.E. Donahue T.J. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 725-745Google Scholar), and ultimately re-reduce D+via the tetra-heme C subunit.For the investigation of the mechanism of the primary electron transfer reactions, RC mutants where the energetics of D* and D+ are changed by the removal or addition of hydrogen bonds between the special pair and amino acid side chains have been extensively studied (see Ref. 19Woodbury N.W. Allen J.P. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 527-557Google Scholar for a review). In both Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Rp. viridis RCs, histidine L168 donates a hydrogen bond to the ring I acetyl group of DL (see Ref. 20Lancaster C.R.D. Ermler U. Michel H. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 503-526Google Scholar for a review). In a mutant RC from Rp. viridis, where His L168 is replaced by phenylalanine (HL168F), the D/D+ redox potential is 80 mV lower than that of the wild-type RC (21Arlt T. Bibikova M. Penzkofer H. Oesterhelt D. Zinth W. J. Phys. Chem. 1996; 100: 12060-12065Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The decay of the excited electronic state D* is accelerated by more than a factor of three. This leads to a remarkable increase in the population of BA−, thus providing strong support for a stepwise electron transfer mechanism from D* to φA with the accessory bacteriochlorophyll BA as a short-lived real electron carrier (21Arlt T. Bibikova M. Penzkofer H. Oesterhelt D. Zinth W. J. Phys. Chem. 1996; 100: 12060-12065Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 22Zinth W. Huppmann P. Arlt T. Wachtveitl J. Phil. Trans. Royal Soc. Lond.

The data collected to resolve the nature of the changes introduced by this mutation turned out to be of sufficient quality to also reliably describe the mode of binding of the triazine inhibitor terbutryn (2-t-butylamino-4-ethylamino-6-methylthio-s-triazine) to the QB site. Although the terbutryn binding site had been localized by x-ray crystallographic analysis of the RC-terbutryn complex, based on 38,663 unique reflections up to a resolution of 2.9 Å (R-factor = 23.8% (23Michel H. Epp O. Deisenhofer J. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2445-2451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), description of the exact nature of protein-terbutryn interactions has had to await the refinement of this higher resolution structure. In addition, possibly biologically relevant modifications of the atomic model also include the crystallographic assignment of a large number of additional tightly bound water molecules, which are of particular relevance to the discussion of proton transfer pathways to the QB site.RESULTSThe structure of the HL168F RC in complex with terbutryn is summarized in Table I. This is the best-defined Rp. viridis reaction center structure to date, and the crystallographic R-factor andR freeT are 19.4% and 21.8%, respectively, for all data between 10.0 and 2.00 Å (Table I). The position error is estimated to be 0.15 Å. Simulated annealing omit electron density maps (31Hodel A. Kim S.-H. Brünger A.T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1992; 48: 851-858Crossref Scopus (392) Google Scholar) were calculated for the site of mutation (Fig. 1) and the terbutryn binding site (Fig. 2). All residues of interest can be detected clearly in the electron density.As can be seen in Fig. 1 A, the Phe side chain of the exchanged residue L168 adopts a conformation very similar to the wild-type His. In the wild-type RC, the His Nε atom donates a hydrogen bond to the ring I acetyl oxygen of bacteriochlorophyll DL (23Michel H. Epp O. Deisenhofer J. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2445-2451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The position of this oxygen atom in the wild-type RC structure is not covered by the mutant RC electron density (Fig. 1,A and B). In the refined structure of the HL168F RC, this acetyl group has undergone a 20° rotation relative to the wild-type RC, thus shortening the distance between the acetyl oxygen atom and the Mg2+ center of bacteriochlorophyll DM from 4.1 to 3.0 Å. The distance between the Mg2+ centers of bacteriochlorophylls DM and DL has decreased from 7.7 to 7.4 Å, mainly because of a slight displacement of the DM-Mg2+ toward the DL acetyl oxygen (Fig. 1 C). In addition to the acetyl group rotation, an approximately 3° rotation of DLis apparent, leading to a displacement of ring I by between 0.2 (for the NB atom) and 0.4 Å (for the C3B atom), relative to the wild-type RC structure. A slight reduction in the distance between D and BA, as monitored by the distance between the C2B atom of DM and the C2D atom of BA (5.45 Å in the wild-type RC and 5.3 Å in the HL168F RC), is as large as the estimated position error (Table I).Terbutryn BindingThe pattern of hydrogen bonding geometry for the RC-terbutryn complex (Fig. 2) is very similar to that reported earlier for the binding of atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine) and other triazine inhibitors (30Lancaster C.R.D. Michel H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 883-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the following, the respective donor-acceptor distances are given in parentheses. The hydrogen bonding pattern includes, firstly, two tightly bound water molecules, one of which is apparently involved in accepting a hydrogen bond from His L190 Nδ (2.9 Å) and in donating a second hydrogen bond to the N1 of the terbutryn ring (3.0 Å). The other apparently completes the hydrogen-bonding web with hydrogen bonds to the first water molecule (2.7 Å) and to the Oε of Glu L212 (2.9 Å). Secondly, the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Tyr L222 is within hydrogen-bonding distance of the terbutryn t-butylamino nitrogen (3.3 Å). In the original RC-terbutryn complex (23Michel H. Epp O. Deisenhofer J. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2445-2451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), only the two hydrogen bonds from the backbone amide of Ile L224 to the N5 of the terbutryn ring (here, 3.1 Å) and from the aminoethyl nitrogen to Ser L223 Oγ (here, 3.0 Å) had been inferred. In summary, the terbutryn molecule is apparently bound to the protein directly by three hydrogen bonds on the “distal” side and only indirectly via water molecules (and four hydrogen bonds) on the “proximal” side, which is oriented toward the non-heme iron and its ligand His L190. In analogy to the water molecules in the QB site of the QB-depleted RC (3PRC (27Lancaster C.R.D. Michel H. Structure. 1997; 5: 1339-1359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), the two water molecules associated with terbutryn binding are linked by hydrogen bonds to the water molecules of the hydrogen-bonded web (not shown) from the cytoplasmic surface to the QB site discussed earlier (27Lancaster C.R.D. Michel H. Structure. 1997; 5: 1339-1359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, in Fig. 2,C and D, the refined RC complex with terbutryn is compared with the structure of the RC complex with atrazine (5PRC (30Lancaster C.R.D. Michel H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 883-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar)), where the aromatic ring of Phe L216 is not parallel to the atrazine ring plane at an interplanar angle of 24°. In the RC-terbutryn complex, the Phe L216 ring plane is rotated by 14° to be aligned more parallel to the plane of the terbutryn ring, which itself is tilted by 6° compared with the atrazine ring plane.Water MoleculesThe original (1PRC (10Deisenhofer J. Epp O. Sinning I. Michel H. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 429-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar)) structure contained 201 tentative, ordered water molecules, and a QB-depleted RC structure (3PRC (27Lancaster C.R.D. Michel H. Structure. 1997; 5: 1339-1359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) contained 425. In the new structure presented here, 585 tentative water molecules were included, based on electron density maps and local chemistry. Of these, 328 water molecules (68 more than in 3PRC) are in the periplasmic region of the molecule, three (the same as in 3PRC) are in the transmembrane region, and 254 (68 more than in 3PRC) are in the cytoplasmic region. The latter are of particular interest, because they create new connectivities within the previously described (27Lancaster C.R.D. Michel H. Structure. 1997; 5: 1339-1359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) “web” of hydrogen bonds involving amino acid side chains and water molecules and proposed to be relevant for proton uptake from the cytoplasm and proton transfer to the QB site. A detailed analysis of this further-defined web will be presented elsewhere.

Although the terbutryn binding site had been localized by x-ray crystallographic analysis of the RC-terbutryn complex, based on 38,663 unique reflections up to a resolution of 2.9 Å (R-factor = 23.8% (23Michel H. Epp O. Deisenhofer J. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2445-2451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), description of the exact nature of protein-terbutryn interactions has had to await the refinement of this higher resolution structure. In addition, possibly biologically relevant modifications of the atomic model also include the crystallographic assignment of a large number of additional tightly bound water molecules, which are of particular relevance to the discussion of proton transfer pathways to the QB site. RESULTSThe structure of the HL168F RC in complex with terbutryn is summarized in Table I. This is the best-defined Rp. viridis reaction center structure to date, and the crystallographic R-factor andR freeT are 19.4% and 21.8%, respectively, for all data between 10.0 and 2.00 Å (Table I). The position error is estimated to be 0.15 Å. Simulated annealing omit electron density maps (31Hodel A. Kim S.-H. Brünger A.T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1992; 48: 851-858Crossref Scopus (392) Google Scholar) were calculated for the site of mutation (Fig. 1) and the terbutryn binding site (Fig. 2). All residues of interest can be detected clearly in the electron density.As can be seen in Fig. 1 A, the Phe side chain of the exchanged residue L168 adopts a conformation very similar to the wild-type His. In the wild-type RC, the His Nε atom donates a hydrogen bond to the ring I acetyl oxygen of bacteriochlorophyll DL (23Michel H. Epp O. Deisenhofer J. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2445-2451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The position of this oxygen atom in the wild-type RC structure is not covered by the mutant RC electron density (Fig. 1,A and B). In the refined structure of the HL168F RC, this acetyl group has undergone a 20° rotation relative to the wild-type RC, thus shortening the distance between the acetyl oxygen atom and the Mg2+ center of bacteriochlorophyll DM from 4.1 to 3.0 Å. The distance between the Mg2+ centers of bacteriochlorophylls DM and DL has decreased from 7.7 to 7.4 Å, mainly because of a slight displacement of the DM-Mg2+ toward the DL acetyl oxygen (Fig. 1 C). In addition to the acetyl group rotation, an approximately 3° rotation of DLis apparent, leading to a displacement of ring I by between 0.2 (for the NB atom) and 0.4 Å (for the C3B atom), relative to the wild-type RC structure. A slight reduction in the distance between D and BA, as monitored by the distance between the C2B atom of DM and the C2D atom of BA (5.45 Å in the wild-type RC and 5.3 Å in the HL168F RC), is as large as the estimated position error (Table I).Terbutryn BindingThe pattern of hydrogen bonding geometry for the RC-terbutryn complex (Fig. 2) is very similar to that reported earlier for the binding of atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine) and other triazine inhibitors (30Lancaster C.R.D. Michel H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 883-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the following, the respective donor-acceptor distances are given in parentheses. The hydrogen bonding pattern includes, firstly, two tightly bound water molecules, one of which is apparently involved in accepting a hydrogen bond from His L190 Nδ (2.9 Å) and in donating a second hydrogen bond to the N1 of the terbutryn ring (3.0 Å). The other apparently completes the hydrogen-bonding web with hydrogen bonds to the first water molecule (2.7 Å) and to the Oε of Glu L212 (2.9 Å). Secondly, the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Tyr L222 is within hydrogen-bonding distance of the terbutryn t-butylamino nitrogen (3.3 Å). In the original RC-terbutryn complex (23Michel H. Epp O. Deisenhofer J. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2445-2451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), only the two hydrogen bonds from the backbone amide of Ile L224 to the N5 of the terbutryn ring (here, 3.1 Å) and from the aminoethyl nitrogen to Ser L223 Oγ (here, 3.0 Å) had been inferred. In summary, the terbutryn molecule is apparently bound to the protein directly by three hydrogen bonds on the “distal” side and only indirectly via water molecules (and four hydrogen bonds) on the “proximal” side, which is oriented toward the non-heme iron and its ligand His L190. In analogy to the water molecules in the QB site of the QB-depleted RC (3PRC (27Lancaster C.R.D. Michel H. Structure. 1997; 5: 1339-1359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), the two water molecules associated with terbutryn binding are linked by hydrogen bonds to the water molecules of the hydrogen-bonded web (not shown) from the cytoplasmic surface to the QB site discussed earlier (27Lancaster C.R.D. Michel H. Structure. 1997; 5: 1339-1359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, in Fig. 2,C and D, the refined RC complex with terbutryn is compared with the structure of the RC complex with atrazine (5PRC (30Lancaster C.R.D. Michel H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 883-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar)), where the aromatic ring of Phe L216 is not parallel to the atrazine ring plane at an interplanar angle of 24°. In the RC-terbutryn complex, the Phe L216 ring plane is rotated by 14° to be aligned more parallel to the plane of the terbutryn ring, which itself is tilted by 6° compared with the atrazine ring plane.Water MoleculesThe original (1PRC (10Deisenhofer J. Epp O. Sinning I. Michel H. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 429-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar)) structure contained 201 tentative, ordered water molecules, and a QB-depleted RC structure (3PRC (27Lancaster C.R.D. Michel H. Structure. 1997; 5: 1339-1359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) contained 425. In the new structure presented here, 585 tentative water molecules were included, based on electron density maps and local chemistry. Of these, 328 water molecules (68 more than in 3PRC) are in the periplasmic region of the molecule, three (the same as in 3PRC) are in the transmembrane region, and 254 (68 more than in 3PRC) are in the cytoplasmic region. The latter are of particular interest, because they create new connectivities within the previously described (27Lancaster C.R.D. Michel H. Structure. 1997; 5: 1339-1359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) “web” of hydrogen bonds involving amino acid side chains and water molecules and proposed to be relevant for proton uptake from the cytoplasm and proton transfer to the QB site.

In the present study we describe a specific immunoaffinity chromatography purification of GR from liver cytosol from adrenalectomized rats that may be used to identify hitherto unknown cytosolic GR interacting proteins. We have identified the ubiquitously expressed 14-3-3 as well as Raf-1, a downstream effector of Ras, as GR co-purifying proteins. In our semi-quantitative analysis liganded/activated GR showed the strongest interaction with 14-3-3 and Raf-1, but 14-3-3 was also found to co-purify with GR in a nonliganded/nonactivated state. By extensive salt washes we were also able to demonstrate that the glucocorticoid induced interaction between GR, 14-3-3, and Raf-1, respectively, is remarkably stable and withstood 2.4 m salt. The interaction between GR and 14-3-3 was also verified by 14-3-3 co-immunoprecipitation studies. Our observations that GR and Raf-1 are found within the same protein complex (“receptosome”) in the cytoplasm of rat liver cells could provide a mechanistic explanation for glucocorticoid effects on the Raf-1-Ras signaling pathway.

In the cytoplasm, the nonliganded GR forms a multiprotein complex in which, among other proteins, a dimer of a heat shock protein (hsp) 90, as well as monomeric hsp70 and FKBP52 are known to be included. The proteins in this multiprotein complex play a role in the function of GR. For example the dimer of hsp90 keeps the GR inactive and in an optimal conformation for ligand binding (1Nemoto T.

Upon ligand binding, GR is activated (i.e. GR dissociates from the hsp complex), the nuclear localization signal within the ligand binding domain of GR is unmasked, and the receptor is able to translocate into the nucleus and regulate gene transcription (for a review see Bamberger et al. (2Bamberger C.M. Schulte H.M. Chrousos G.P. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar)). In various experimental systems GR has been reported to associate with proteins involved in other signaling pathways such as NF-κB (3Caldenhoven E. Liden J. Wissink S. Van de Stolpe A. Raaijmakers J. Koenderman L. Okret S. Gustafsson J.Å. Van der Saag P.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 401-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Ray A. Prefontaine K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar), STAT3 (5Zhang Z. Jones S. Hagood J.S. Fuentes N.L. Fuller G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30607-30610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and STAT5 (6Stocklin E. Wissler M. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Nature. 1996; 383: 726-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), suggesting that the GR-multiprotein complex in vivocould contain a larger number of proteins. One such protein is the 14-3-3 protein. In a yeast two-hybrid screening, 14-3-3η has been shown to be a GR-binding protein using the ligand-binding domain of GR as a bait (7Wakui H. Wright A.P. Gustafsson J. Zilliacus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8153-8156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the same study Wakui et al. (7Wakui H. Wright A.P. Gustafsson J. Zilliacus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8153-8156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) also showed, by glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments, that 14-3-3η interacted with liganded GR, whereas the addition of molybdate inhibited the GR-14-3-3 interaction, indicating that hsp90 prevented GR-14-3-3η interaction. Molybdate is known to stabilize the GR-hsp90 interaction (8Leach K.L. Dahmer M.K. Hammond N.D. Sando J.J. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11884-11890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins of the 14-3-3-family are highly conserved and widely distributed, and they have also been found to associate with proteins involved in cellular signaling, for example Cdc25, IRS-1, and Raf-1 (9Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). Members of the 14-3-3 protein family seem to have a variety of functions; for example they affect the cell cycle by binding to Cdc25 and thereby function as a nuclear export signal (10Lopez-Girona A. Furnari B. Mondesert O. Russell P. Nature. 1999; 397: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the 14-3-3 interaction with IRS-1 seems to interrupt the association between the insulin receptor and IRS-1 (11Ogihara T. Isobe T. Ichimura T. Taoka M. Funaki M. Sakoda H. Onishi Y. Inukai K. Anai M. Fukushima Y. Kikuchi M. Yazaki Y. Oka Y. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25267-25274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), whereas the 14-3-3 interaction with Raf-1 has been shown to be a prerequisite for plasma membrane recruitment and activation of Ras (12Roy S. McPherson R.A. Apolloni A. Yan J. Lane A. Clyde-Smith J. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3947-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 can exist as a dimer in vivo and thereby function as an adaptor protein (i.e. bind two different proteins at the same time). For example the proteins Bcr and Raf-1 have been shown to be connected through a dimer of 14-3-3 (13Braselmann S. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4839-4848Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Because the methods used to investigate GR-14-3-3 interaction have relied on the interaction of overexpressed proteins, we found it of interest to investigate whether GR interacts with 14-3-3 under conditions where GR and its associated partners are present at concentrations comparable to the in vivo situation. In the present study we describe a specific immunoaffinity chromatographic purification of GR in liver cytosol from adrenalectomized rats in which 14-3-3 was found to co-purify with GR. 14-3-3 co-purified with GR in several functional states: nonliganded/nonactivated, liganded/nonactivated (i.e. in the presence of molybdate) and liganded/activated. Liganded/activated GR showed the strongest 14-3-3 interaction in this semi-quantitative analysis. The 14-3-3 interaction with nonliganded GR suggested that 14-3-3 and GR could associate when GR is complexed to hsp90. However, a stringent washing procedure involving stepwise salt gradient washes from 50 mm to 2.4 m NaCl indicated that 14-3-3 interaction predominantly occurred with liganded/activated GR. Because glucocorticoids are involved in regulation of glucose homeostasis and also affect cellular growth rates, it was of interest to study whether we could observe possible 14-3-3-mediated GR interactions relevant for these processes. We found that Raf-1 was co-immunopurified with GR, whereas we were not able to demonstrate the presence of IRS-1 in the GR-associated complex. Our observations that GR and Raf-1 are found within the same protein complex in the cytoplasm of rat liver cells provide a mechanistic explanation for glucocorticoid inhibitory effects on the Raf-1-Ras signaling pathway reported by Croxtall et al. (14Croxtall J.D. Choudhury Q. Flower R.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 130: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Glucocorticoids could therefore exert rapid effects on Ras-Raf signaling pathways via GR, which interacts directly or possibly indirectly via 14-3-3 with Raf-1 in the cytoplasm. Rat liver cytosol was prepared from four 6–8-week-old adrenalectomized female rats (M&B, Ry, Denmark). The livers were perfused with EPG buffer (1 mm EDTA, 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol) and homogenized in EPG buffer (with 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin (Roche Diagnostics Scandinavia AB, Stockholm, Sweden), 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, and 200 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) added) and ultracentrifuged for 30 min at 210,000 × g at 4 °C. To obtain GR in different functional states the cytosol was prepared as follows: (a) in case of nonactivated GR, 20 mmNa2MoO4, was added to the EPG buffer in all steps; (b) in case of liganded GR, triamcinolone acetonide (20 nm) was added to the cytosol for 1 h at 4 °C; and (c) in case of activated GR, the cytosol was diluted 1:2 in EPG buffer and heat-activated at 25 °C for 30 min. The cytosol was filtered and then, at 4 °C, run through (a) a column with 1 ml of Sepharose 4B, (b) a column with 1 ml of normal mouse IgG (NMIgG) antibodies coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (referred to as the NMIgG column), and (c) a column with 1 ml of the GR-specific mouse monoclonal antibody 250 (originally called mAb 7) (15Okret S. Wikström A.C. Wrange O. Andersson B. Gustafsson J.Å. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1609-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (referred to as the 250 column). (The chromatography columns were from Bio-Rad and Sepharose 4B, and CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.) After washing with 15 ml of EPG buffer with 50 mm NaCl, 15 ml of EPG buffer with 150 mm NaCl (salt wash), and 15 ml of EPG buffer with 50 mm NaCl, respectively, four column volumes of the corresponding peptide D-12-E (synthesized by Neosystem, Strasbourg, France) (16McEwan I.J. Almlof T. Wikström A.C. Dahlman-Wright K. Wright A.P. Gustafsson J.Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25629-25636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at a concentration of 1.4 mg/ml in EPG buffer was used for elution of GR and GR-associated proteins at 4 °C. Because the elution efficiency was dependent on the functional state of GR, peptide elution was not sufficient to elute liganded/activated GR, which required 2.5 m NaSCN in EPG buffer for complete elution. The eluted proteins were precipitated with 0.02% sodium deoxycholate for 15 min and 20% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C overnight. After centrifugation at 3000 × gfor 30 min and washing with ice-cold acetone the proteins were resuspended in sample dilution buffer. The proteins were run on SDS-PAGE (7.2% or 9% polyacrylamide gel) under reducing conditions and blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R 250 (Fluka, Stockholm, Sweden), cut to obtain one lane per strip, and destained in methanol. After blocking with 5% defatted dry milk, the strips were incubated with the following primary antibodies; anti-GR mAb 250 (also called mAb 7) (15Okret S. Wikström A.C. Wrange O. Andersson B. Gustafsson J.Å. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1609-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), anti-hsp90 (17Akner G. Mossberg K. Sundqvist K.G. Gustafsson J.Å. Wikström A.C. Eur J. Cell Biol. 1992; 58: 356-364PubMed Google Scholar), anti-14-3-3, anti-Raf-1, and anti-IRS-1 (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), respectively, in PBS and 1% defatted dry milk for 2 h at room temperature. After washing in washing buffer (PBS + 0.5% Tween 20), the polyvinylidene difluoride strips were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted in PBS and 1% defatted dry milk for 1 h. The strips were again washed in washing buffer and incubated with SuperSignal® Substrate or SuperSignal®WestFemtoMaximumSensitivitySubstrate (Pierce) for 5 min. The signals were detected according to the protocol enclosed from Pierce. Liver cytosols were prepared as described above and 10 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.15m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, were added to the cytosol, which was then preabsorbed with agarose-coupled normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz). The preabsorbed cytosol (500 μg of the total amount of protein) was diluted to a total volume of 100 μl in 10 mmTris, pH 7.8, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and a slurry of 20 μl 14-3-3 agarose-coupled beads was added to it. The beads were gently agitated overnight and then washed three times in PBS. 20 μl of loading buffer was added to the agarose beads, which were boiled before analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. As a negative control, agarose-coupled normal rabbit antibodies from Santa Cruz were used. All steps were carried out at 4 °C. Liver cytosols from adrenalectomized rats were prepared to contain either nonliganded/nonactivated or liganded/activated GR as described above, and the cytosols were run, in parallel, through three subsequent columns; Sepharose, NMIgG, and 250 columns, respectively. A stepwise NaCl gradient elution of the 250 columns was performed using EPG buffer with the increasing salt concentrations: 30 ml + 20 ml of 50 mm, 20 ml of 300 mm, 20 ml of 600 mm, 20 ml of 1.2 m, and 20 ml of 2.4m. Thereafter, a 20-ml 50 mm wash followed by a 5-ml peptide elution and a 10-ml NaSCN elution was performed. The salt eluted fractions (apart from the first 30 ml of the first washing with 50 mm) as well as the peptide and NaSCN eluted fractions were precipitated as described above and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. To investigate cytosolic GR-interacting proteins we have established a GR immunoaffinity chromatographic purification method where GR was purified from cytosol prepared from livers of adrenalectomized rats. To avoid nonspecific binding, the cytosol was prepurified, first on a Sepharose column followed by a column containing NMIgG immobilized on a Sepharose matrix. The prepurified cytosol was subsequently applied to a column containing the anti-GR monoclonal antibody (mAb7 also denoted 250) (15Okret S. Wikström A.C. Wrange O. Andersson B. Gustafsson J.Å. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1609-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) coupled to a Sepharose matrix. A peptide corresponding to the identified epitope for mAb 250 (16McEwan I.J. Almlof T. Wikström A.C. Dahlman-Wright K. Wright A.P. Gustafsson J.Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25629-25636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used for elution of GR. The elution is mild and specific and allowed GR-interacting proteins to co-purify with the receptor. After the peptide elution, the column was eluted with NaSCN. Liganded/activated GR required NaSCN for complete elution. Peptide-eluted and NaSCN-eluted GR and its co-purifying proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE followed by blotting to polyvinylidene difluoride and Coomassie staining (Fig. 1, A and C). The pattern of GR and GR co-purifying proteins was analyzed with GR in different functional states: (a) nonliganded/nonactivated, (b) liganded/nonactivated, and (c) liganded/activated. To investigate the specificity of the GR immunoaffinity chromatographic purification, prepurified cytosol was also run through a normal mouse IgG column and eluted with peptide followed by NaSCN, as a negative control (Fig. 1, A,lane 4, and C, lane 3). GR was detected using immunostaining with the mAb 250 (Fig. 1 B). Several co-purifying proteins were observed in Fig. 1 (A,lanes 1–3, and C, lanes 1 and2). 14-3-3η protein has been reported to bind to GR in a yeast two-hybrid screening, by using the ligand binding domain of GR as a bait (7Wakui H. Wright A.P. Gustafsson J. Zilliacus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8153-8156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the same study it was shown that the 14-3-3 protein interacted with liganded GR, whereas molybdate inhibited this interaction as judged from a glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay. This indicates that, in vitro, hsp90 prevents 14-3-3 binding to GR. To further investigate possible 14-3-3 protein interaction with GR in a system using endogenous protein levels, immunoaffinity chromatographic purification of GR was performed in a semi-quantitative manner (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 2). Western blot analysis showed that 14-3-3 co-purified with GR in all functional states, even when molybdate was present in the cytosol. Although not formally quantitative, the Western blot signal intensity of a GR co-purified protein as compared with the GR signal intensity gives an indication of the amount of proteins co-purified with GR in the various states. In light of this, we noted that liganded/activated GR gave rise to a stronger 14-3-3 signal than the nonliganded/nonactivated GR (Fig. 2, compare A and C). This suggests that 14-3-3 and GR associate even when GR is bound to hsp90, although GR devoid of hsp90 showed a higher degree of binding to 14-3-3. This is somewhat in contrast to what has previously been described with methods using overexpressed protein levels (7Wakui H. Wright A.P. Gustafsson J. Zilliacus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8153-8156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The presence of hsp90 was used as an indicator of the functional state of GR in the various eluates; accordingly, the presence of hsp90 in Fig. 2 A indicates that GR in this experiment was in a nonactivated state, whereas the eluate in Fig. 2 C is devoid of hsp90 and thus indicates that GR was activated. We also noted a relative increase of hsp70, as compared with GR, co-immunopurified with activated GR in parallel to the increase of GR-interacting 14-3-3 (Fig. 2, compare A andC).Figure 214-3-3 co-purifies with GR from rat liver cytosol. Cytosol from four livers from adrenalectomized rats was divided into three equal parts and purified using the immunoaffinity chromatographic method as described in the legend to Fig. 1 to obtain a semi-quantitative analysis of GR and its co-purifying proteins. A polyclonal antibody directed against 14-3-3 was used to identify 14-3-3 as a GR co-purifying protein. hsp90 and hsp70 were also identified as GR co-purifying proteins by immunostaining. The panels show GR and the GR-co-purified proteins hsp90, hsp70 and 14-3-3 with GR in a nonliganded/nonactivated state (A), liganded/nonactivated state (B), and liganded/activated state (C). InA and B, GR is peptide eluted, and inC, GR is NaSCN eluted. The control is performed by omitting the primary antibody using only secondary antibody. Molecular mass markers are shown in kilodaltons.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We further investigated whether the previously reported 14-3-3 interacting proteins Raf-1 and IRS-1 were to be found among the GR co-purifying proteins. The presence of these two proteins in rat liver cytosol was first determined by Western blotting (data not shown) using commercially available polyclonal antibodies. Western blotting analysis of GR interacting proteins purified as presented in Fig. 1showed that Raf-1 co-purified with GR in the liganded/activated state (Fig. 3 B), whereas a Raf-1 signal was not detected in most experiments with GR in the nonliganded/nonactivated state (Fig. 3 A). Occasionally a weak Raf-1 signal could be detected when the receptor was nonactivated (not shown). IRS-1 was not detected as a GR co-purifying protein in rat liver cytosol (Fig. 3). By using specific rabbit antibodies to 14-3-3, we performed another set of co-immunoprecipitation studies to further corroborate the findings obtained when using GR antibodies. An agarose-coupled polyclonal antibody directed against 14-3-3 was used for precipitation of 14-3-3 in rat liver cytosol treated to obtain GR in two different functional states; nonliganded/nonactivated and liganded/activated. The 14-3-3 co-immunoprecipitates were analyzed on SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Both nonliganded/nonactivated and liganded/activated GR co-precipitated with 14-3-3 (Fig. 4). The precipitates were also analyzed for the presence of Raf-1 using immunostaining. Raf-1 was found in the 14-3-3 immunoprecipitate. Raf-1 co-immunoprecipitated with 14-3-3 to the same extent regardless of molybdate or glucocorticoid addition to the cytosol (Fig. 4). A slight background immunoprecipitation of Raf-1 was seen when using 20 μl of agarose-coupled NMIgG as negative control (Fig. 4). To examine the stability of the GR-antibody interaction and also to investigate the strength of GR interaction with 14-3-3 and Raf-1, a stepwise salt elution with increasing concentrations of NaCl from 50 mm to 2.4 m salt was performed. Liver cytosols from adrenalectomized rats were prepared to contain either nonliganded/nonactivated or liganded/activated GR, and the cytosols were run, in parallel, through three subsequent columns: Sepharose, NMIgG, and 250 columns, respectively. A stepwise salt gradient elution of the 250 columns was performed using EPG buffer with increasing salt concentrations: 50 mm, 300 mm, 600 mm, 1.2 m, and 2.4 m, followed by a salt washing out using 50 mm NaCl. Thereafter, a peptide elution followed by a NaSCN elution was performed. The salt eluted fractions as well as the peptide and NaSCN eluted fractions were precipitated and analyzed on SDS-PAGE and by Western blot. The immunoaffinity chromatographic purification of GR was found to be very stable, despite the extensive washing with increasing salt concentrations the column still retained GR that could be eluted using the epitope corresponding peptide or NaSCN (Fig. 5). Both nonliganded/nonactivated GR (Fig. 5 A) and liganded/activated GR (Fig. 5 B) were found to form stable bonds to the 250 column, and both of these two functional GR states withstood the salt washings. Some elution of nonliganded/nonactivated GR occurred from the 250 column at 50 mm, 300 mm, 600 mm, and 1.2m salt washing (Fig. 5 A), whereas the liganded/activated GR eluted at 300 and 600 mm NaCl (Fig. 5 B). This indicates that the liganded/activated GR binds with a higher affinity to the mAb 250 than the nonliganded/nonactivated GR. The salt washing fractions were also analyzed with regard to 14-3-3 and Raf-1 to investigate the strength of their binding to GR. Surprisingly, after the stepwise salt gradient, Raf-1 and 14-3-3 were still associated with GR, in its liganded/activated state, and both 14-3-3 and Raf-1 co-eluted with GR when eluting with the peptide as well as with the following GR elution using NaSCN (Fig. 5 B). The interaction between nonliganded/nonactivated GR and 14-3-3 was much weaker, and a first 30-ml salt washing with 50 mm NaCl seemed to be sufficient to abolish 14-3-3 interaction with the nonliganded/nonactivated GR (Fig. 5 A). In the case of Raf-1 and its association with nonliganded/nonactivated GR, we obtained varying results, showing on the one hand that the interaction was almost as strong as with the liganded/activated GR (Fig. 5 B) and on the other hand that the association was as weak as for 14-3-3 and nonliganded/nonactivated GR (not shown). The reason for this variability is further addressed under “Discussion.” Glucocorticoids have been reported to have effects independent of glucocorticoid receptor induced transcriptional activity. Patients with acute adrenal insufficiency show a response to glucocorticoid treatment, that is too fast to be explained by transcriptional activities (18Merry W.H. Caplan R.H. Wickus G.G. Reynertson R.H. Kisken W.A. Cogbill T.H. Landercasper J. Surgery. 1994; 116: 1095-1100PubMed Google Scholar). Also, mice with a dimerization-defective GR that renders GR unable to bind to GRE survive in contrast to GR knock-out mice that die shortly after birth (19Reichardt H.M. Kaestner K.H. Tuckermann J. Kretz O. Wessely O. Bock R. Gass P. Schmid W. Herrlich P. Angel P. Schutz G. Cell. 1998; 93: 531-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). A recent study showed that glucocorticoids very rapidly inhibited the activation of EGF receptors and that this effect was mediated via the GR but independent of transcription (14Croxtall J.D. Choudhury Q. Flower R.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 130: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Effects of steroid receptors could be dependent on alterations in their phosphorylation state. This mechanism of receptor activation has been documented for estrogen receptor, progestin receptor, and androgen receptor (for a review see Ref. 20Cenni B. Picard D. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 10: 41-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Rapid effects have been demonstrated with estrogen receptor α, which may be phosphorylated by mitogen-activated protein kinases upon stimulation by for example insulin-like growth factor I and thereby activated in the absence of estrogen (20Cenni B. Picard D. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 10: 41-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The relevance of glucocorticoid-induced phosphorylation of the glucocorticoid receptor has not been obvious in relation to glucocorticoid induced transcriptional events but may well be of relevance in GR interactions with other signaling pathways. A mechanistic option for rapid effects of glucocorticoids could be direct protein-protein interactions. Such interactions have been demonstrated to occur for GR with among others STAT3 (5Zhang Z. Jones S. Hagood J.S. Fuentes N.L. Fuller G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30607-30610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and STAT5 (6Stocklin E. Wissler M. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Nature. 1996; 383: 726-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) and has been implied for NF-κB and GR (3Caldenhoven E. Liden J. Wissink S. Van de Stolpe A. Raaijmakers J. Koenderman L. Okret S. Gustafsson J.Å. Van der Saag P.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 401-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Ray A. Prefontaine K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Some of these interactions may be dependent on phosphorylation events. In the cytoplasm, nonliganded/nonactivated GR has previously been demonstrated to exist in a multiprotein complex (see Ref. 21Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar and references therein). Several of the receptors in the nuclear receptor family including GR have been demonstrated to interact with cofactors (i.e. coactivators and corepressors present in nuclear extracts or detected in in vitro based systems probing for protein protein interaction). Based on findings in this study we would like to propose a multiprotein complex, a receptosome, in which GR participates, containing more proteins than previously suggested and existing not only in the cell nucleus but also in the cytoplasm harboring a number of putatively functionally relevant proteins, some of which may be of importance for rapid glucocorticoid effects. Such a receptosome may be a subset of a larger “signalosome,” a term often used to describe multiprotein complexes consisting of proteins participating in signal transduction (Refs. 22Van Aelst L.

Science. 1993; 260: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar; for a review see Ref. 24Burack W.R. Shaw A.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). We have developed a purification method for GR allowing the receptor to be purified in various functional states and also allowing detection of co-purifying proteins. By running parallel experiments with equal fractions of the same cytosol containing nonliganded/nonactivated or liganded/activated GR on equal-sized immunoaffinity columns, we have been able to perform semiquantitative comparisons of GR co-purifying proteins. As seen in Fig. 1, a number of proteins co-purify with GR and most of them are specific in the sense that they are not observed when substituting the anti-GR antibody for normal mouse immunoglobulins. We are in the process of identifying the GR co-purifying proteins and have found that it is possible to corroborate the previously demonstrated interaction of GR with 14-3-3 in this system. Because the GR/14-3-3 interaction has previously been demonstrated using yeast-two-hybrid and glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments, our findings confirm the validity of these experimental approaches in this particular case. Furthermore, the unexpected finding of Raf-1 in the GR multiprotein complex indicates the usefulness of our immunoaffinity-based technique in native systems to discover yet other currently unknown GR-protein interaction. It is at this point unclear whether GR interacts directly with Raf-1 or whether this interaction is mediated via 14-3-3. Studies of the effect of 14-3-3 on Raf-1 are so far not conclusive as 14-3-3 has been reported to either have no effect on Raf (25Suen K.L. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M.

A more recent study implies that 14-3-3 is bound to Raf-1 in the cytosol and that this binding is necessary for shuttling of Raf-1 to the cell membrane and for activation by Ras. This study also shows that 14-3-3 dissociates completely from Raf-1 at the plasma membrane (12Roy S. McPherson R.A. Apolloni A. Yan J. Lane A. Clyde-Smith J. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3947-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Because we have found several co-purifying proteins for liganded/activated GR in cytosolic extracts, any other protein present in the extract may actually mediate the GR-Raf-1-interaction. It could for instance be noted in Fig. 2 that hsp70 seems to be enriched in the liganded/activated fraction. Raf-1 is also known to complex with hsp90 (28Stancato L.F. Chow Y.H. Hutchison K.A. Perdew G.H. Jove R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21711-21716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but because we found that Raf-1 co-purified with GR in the liganded/activated state (i.e. when GR is dissociated from hsp90), we exclude that, in our experiments, the GR-Raf-1 interaction is mediated via hsp90. To be able to distinguish nonliganded/nonactivated from liganded/activated receptor, we used adrenalectomized rats to eliminate endogenous ligand and also included 20 mm molybdate to maintain the receptor in the nonactivated state (8Leach K.L. Dahmer M.K. Hammond N.D. Sando J.J. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11884-11890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we sometimes noted the presence of 14-3-3 and Raf-1 in the nonliganded/nonactivated GR co-purifying protein population albeit at lower levels. This may indicate that a low affinity interaction of GR, 14-3-3 and Raf-1 could occur regardless of ligand and GR activation state but that the conformational change of GR most likely induced by ligand binding as well as the concomitant detachment from hsp90 leads to an increased recruitment of 14-3-3 and Raf-1 to GR. Another possibility is that the experimental procedure involving dilution and washing with 150 mm NaCl leads to activation of a fraction of GR at low temperature and in the absence of ligand and that we observe presence of 14-3-3 and Raf-1 in the nonliganded/nonactivated GR fraction as a consequence of a unintentional GR activation. To further study the interaction between 14-3-3 and GR, we also used 14-3-3-antibodies to immunoprecipitate 14-3-3 and looked for co-precipitating proteins. The antibody we used recognized all 14-3-3 isomers including the 14-3-3η. We were able to co-immunoprecipitate a small amount of both GR and Raf-1 to a similar extent regardless of GR ligandation and activational state. This verifies the interaction but also probably reflects that only a fraction of 14-3-3, being an abundant protein with several isoforms, interacts with GR and that the activational state of GR is difficult to control under the experimental conditions of this particular co-immunoprecipitation study. The observation of 14-3-3 complexed with liganded/activated GR may indicate the need for GR to be continuously chaperoned in all functional states. The functional relevance of GR-Raf-1 interaction could be of special importance in regulation of cellular growth and differentiation. Glucocorticoids have been reported to affect cellular growth events in a cell- and context-dependent fashion; for example, glucocorticoids lead to induction of apoptosis in certain T lymphocyte populations and to growth arrest in G1 in lymphocytes (reviewed in Ref. 29King K.L. Cidlowski J.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 601-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), whereas in hepatoma cells apoptosis is suppressed by glucocorticoids (30Evans-Storms R.B. Cidlowski J.A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1854-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Raf-1 in turn is a key mediator of mitogen-activated growth responses and is recruited by Ras to further perpetuate mitogen responses via the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase pathway. In many cells Raf-1 and glucocorticoid signals would be expected to counterbalance one another, and a direct or indirect physical interaction of these two proteins may provide a route for cross-talk. Furthermore, 14-3-3 has been shown to transport Raf-1 both to and from the cell membrane where Ras is anchored (31Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar), and either or both of these transport steps of 14-3-3 may be affected by a GR/14-3-3 interaction (12Roy S. McPherson R.A. Apolloni A. Yan J. Lane A. Clyde-Smith J. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3947-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Glucocorticoids have been demonstrated by Croxtall et al. (14Croxtall J.D. Choudhury Q. Flower R.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 130: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) to exert inhibitory effects on the Ras/Raf signaling pathway in A549 human adenocarcinoma cells, an inhibition that could be reversed by the glucocorticoid antagonist, RU486. Because glucocorticoids play a role in insulin responsiveness and blood glucose control, with the liver constituting an important organ for these functions, we were interested to see if the previously reported interaction of 14-3-3 and IRS-1 could be observed also in our system. We were able to demonstrate the presence of immunoreactive IRS-1 at an expected molecular size of 131 kDa with commercially available antibodies in rat liver cytosol. However, we were not able to demonstrate presence of IRS-1 either in the GR co-purifying fraction or in the 14-3-3 immunoprecipitate. This may reflect a mutually exclusive binding of GR and IRS-1 to 14-3-3 or, in the case of lack of IRS-1 co-immunoprecipitation by 14-3-3 antibodies, experimental conditions different from those used by Ogihara and co-workers (11Ogihara T. Isobe T. Ichimura T. Taoka M. Funaki M. Sakoda H. Onishi Y. Inukai K. Anai M. Fukushima Y. Kikuchi M. Yazaki Y. Oka Y. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25267-25274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that cytosolic GR may exist together with other specific proteins in a tightly held together multiprotein complex, a receptosome, forming the biochemical basis for cross-talk between GR and other signaling pathways, one example of which is Ras/Raf-1. The presence of the 14-3-3 protein may facilitate GR interactions with other proteins. Because the GR-protein interactions studied in this investigation appeared to be significantly strengthened following ligand activation of GR, it is quite conceivable that introduction of glucocorticoids into this system might trigger changes in GR-protein interaction leading to rapid nongenomic effects. Ongoing studies are aimed at identifying other possible proteins participating in the formation of the GR containing receptosome. We acknowledge Marika Rönnholm for skillful technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W1993618034,"Proteins of the retinoblastoma family (pRb, p107, and p130) modulate cell proliferation, a function related to their capacity to control the activity of the E2F transcription factor family. The Rb proteins also control cell differentiation in different tissues. We have recently described their involvement in human epidermal keratinocyte differentiation (Paramio, J. M., Laı́n, S., Segrelles, C., Lane, E. B., and Jorcano, J. L. (1998) <i>Oncogene</i> 17, 949–957). Here we show that E2F proteins are also involved in this process. We found that E2F1 and E2F4 are expressed differentially during the <i>in vitro</i>differentiation of human epidermal keratinocytes, with the former uniformly present throughout the process, whereas the second is predominantly expressed at the onset of differentiation. This pattern is also observed in human skin by confocal microscopy. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that the complexes formed by E2F1 and E2F4 and Rb family proteins vary throughout <i>in vitro</i> keratinocyte differentiation. In agreement with this observation, several E2F-responsive genes are differentially regulated during this process. To test the functional implications of these observations, we transfected HaCaT keratinocytes with plasmids coding for E2F1 and E2F4. Transfected cells display opposite <i>in vitro</i> differentiation properties. Although E2F1-transfected cells are unable to differentiate, E2F4-transfected cells show an increased differentiation rate compared with Neo-transfected control cells. Our data demonstrate that the differential and coordinated expression and interaction of E2F and Rb proteins modulate the process of epidermal differentiation and provide clear evidence that members of the E2F family of transcription factors play specific and opposite roles during cell differentiation."

Weber M.J. Bishop J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In this approach, the kinase domain is genetically fused to the estrogen receptor ligand binding domain. It has been found that the catalytic activity of the fused kinase is stimulated if estrogen ligands are added to the cell culture media. This powerful technology has been used to characterize the targets and functions of raf kinase (3Samuels M.L. Weber M.J. Bishop J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 4Lenormand P. McMahon M. Ponyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15762-15768Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, the potentially unwanted biological impact of the additional estrogen receptor domain suggests that the development of alternative, complementary approaches is desirable. There are a number of reported examples where mutant, catalytically defective enzymes have been reactivated by introducing small molecules that have the requisite properties of the altered residues (12–23). By making slight structural changes in the small molecule activators, it is possible to learn more about the specific molecular contributions of the altered amino acid residue toward catalysis. Our goal was to apply this chemical rescue technique to a mutant, catalytically impaired protein kinase for eventual use in signaling studies. The catalytic loop of protein-tyrosine and -serine/threonine kinases is highly conserved among each of these enzyme families. In serine/threonine kinases, a lysine residue is found at the n+ 2 position, where n is a critical catalytic loop aspartate residue. In protein-tyrosine kinases, an arginine residue is instead present in the catalytic loop at either the n + 2 position or n + 4 position (Fig. 1). X-ray crystallography of a peptide substrate and ATP analogue complexed to the insulin receptor protein-tyrosine kinase catalytic domain has shown that this catalytic loop arginine residue is within hydrogen bonding distance of the substrate tyrosine phenol, as well as the highly conserved aspartate (Fig. 2) (24Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). To date, the functional role and contributions of this arginine to protein-tyrosine kinase catalysis have not been investigated in detail but we hypothesized that it might be a good candidate for external replacement given its variable site location in protein-tyrosine kinases.Figure 2Close-up of active site from x-ray crystal structure of insulin receptor protein-tyrosine kinase complexed to peptide substrate and ATP analogue (24Hubbard S.R.

Csk is a protein-tyrosine kinase with importance in inhibiting Src family members, because it catalyzes the site-specific phosphorylation of Src protein tails (25Okada M. Nakagawa H. J. Biol.

Csk has proven to be a particularly useful system for exploring mechanistic and substrate selectivity issues in protein-tyrosine kinase function (27Sondhi D. Cole P.A.

Reagents were purchased from commercially available sources unless otherwise indicated. Appropriate primers for the QuikChange® mutagenesis were purchased from Integrated Data Technologies and were purified by either preparative PAGE or standard desalting techniques prior to use. Catalytically inactive chicken Src K295M protein was expressed and purified fromEscherichia coli. 2D. Wang, X.-Y. Huang, and P. A. Cole, submitted for publication. The Csk gene was cloned into the pGEX-3Xb vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) via N-terminal NdeI and C-terminal HindIII restriction sites. All GST-Csk mutants were prepared using the QuikChange® procedure by Stratagene. For all mutants, DNA sequencing confirmed the presence of only the desired mutation. The proteins were overexpressed and purified analogously to previously described methods (27Sondhi D. Cole P.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11147-11155Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) with the exception that the DH5α strain ofE. coli cells were grown at 37 °C toA595 = 0.6 prior to induction with 0.4 mm IPTG at 16 °C for 22 h. GST-Csk and its mutants were estimated to be ∼70–80% pure by 10% SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 3). The protein yields ranged from between 2–5 mg/liter of E. colicell culture as calculated from Bradford analysis against BSA standard. All kinetic data reported were based on duplicate experiments. Results generally agreed within 20%. The limiting substrate in each case did not exceed 10% for the conditions used. Wild type and mutant GST-Csk kinase assays were performed analogously to previous methods monitoring phosphoryl transfer from [γ-32P]ATP to 4:1 poly(Glu,Tyr) (28Cole P.A. Burn P. Takacs B. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30880-30887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Optimal MnCl2 concentration was determined separately for each mutant and found to be ∼2 mm for wild type Csk and ∼12 mm for each mutant in the absence of activator. Substrate concentrations were at least 5-fold greater than enzyme concentrations for steady-state kinetic measurements. Reaction velocities were determined, and data was fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation as described previously (29Grace M.R. Walsh C.T. Cole P.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1874-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Conditions were essentially identical to those for the poly(Glu,Tyr) phosphorylation assay except that phosphorylated Src was visualized using 10% SDS-PAGE with Coomassie stain, and the protein band was cut out and immersed in scintillation fluid to determine cpms. Background (non-Csk mediated) phosphorylation of the Src K295M substrate was subtracted to determine the final reaction velocities. As in the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase, the catalytic loop arginine of Csk is present at the n + 4 position as referenced to the catalytic loop aspartate. To dissect the role of this arginine (Arg-318) in Csk action, this residue was initially replaced by site-directed mutagenesis with Ala, Gln, Ile, and Lys residues. To simplify the preparation of the mutant proteins, these enzymes were expressed and purified as GST fusion enzymes in E. coli. Previously, it was shown that the kinetic parameters obtained from bacterially expressed Csk are in reasonable agreement with those from rat-derived enzyme (30Cole P.A. Grace M.R. Phillips R.S. Burn P.R. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22105-22108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Contrary to an earlier report (33Bougeret C. Rothhut B. Jullien P. Fischer S. Benarous R. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1241-1247PubMed Google Scholar), the GST moiety did not significantly affect the Km of ATP orkcat value using the artificial substrate poly(Glu,Tyr), although it did result in a modest (4- to 5-fold) drop in Km for poly(Glu,Tyr) compared with that of the GST-free material (Table I).Table ISteady-state kinetic parameters for Csk, GST-Csk, and its mutantsProteinkcatKmpoly(Glu, Tyr)Km ATPmin−1μg/mLμmGST-Csk25 ± 310 ± 115 ± 1Csk25 ± 340 ± 49 ± 1GST-Csk R318A0.008 ± 0.00280 ± 1013 ± 2GST-Csk R318K0.14 ± 0.0440 ± 67 ± 1GST-Csk R318Q0.018 ± 0.00490 ± 914 ± 2GST-Csk A316R,R318A1.2 ± 0.211 ± 212 ± 2GST-Csk R318A 100 mmimidazole0.8 ± 0.1310 ± 40 1-aThe elevatedKm value for poly(Glu, Tyr) is likely because of the extreme sensitivity of this copolymer to ionic strength changes and does not predict a similar increase for protein substrates (29, 34).18 ± 2Assays were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.”1-a The elevatedKm value for poly(Glu, Tyr) is likely because of the extreme sensitivity of this copolymer to ionic strength changes and does not predict a similar increase for protein substrates (29Grace M.R.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab Assays were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each of the above mutants exhibited greatly decreased catalytic efficiency compared with wild type GST-Csk. For GST-Csk R318A and R318Q, the kcat values were reduced 2000- to 3000-fold (Table I). The effects on Km for substrate poly(Glu,Tyr) were relatively minor, with 8- to 10-fold elevations compared with wild type GST-Csk. Interestingly, the optimal manganese concentration for the mutant GST-Csk-catalyzed reactions (12 mm) was higher than that for the wild type reactions (2 mm). A reasonable explanation for this change in Mn dependence is a change in the rate-determining step for the wild typeversus the mutant Csk-catalyzed reactions. The higher Mn concentration may impede ADP release, which is likely the rate-limiting step for the wild type enzyme-catalyzed reaction (29Grace M.R. Walsh C.T. Cole P.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1874-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), yet augment the rate of the chemical step, which is likely rate-determining for the mutant Csk-catalyzed reactions. Similar behavior was seen in kinetic analyses with a previous Csk mutant (D314E) and in studies in which Mg was used in place of Mn (30Cole P.A. Grace M.R. Phillips R.S. Burn P.R. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22105-22108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The GST-Csk R318K mutant showed only about a 180-fold drop inkcat compared with that of wild type enzyme GST-Csk (Table I). The greater activity of R318K compared with R318A and R318Q suggests that the positive charge of the residue side chain could be important in facilitating catalysis. An alternative possibility for the enhanced activity of R318K compared with R318A and R318Q is the greater hydrophobicity of the lysine side chain. Arguing against this hypothesis however was the discovery that the hydrophobic GST-Csk mutant R318I was actually less catalytically active than R318A or R318Q mutants (data not shown). Given the great importance of the Arg residue in catalysis and its conserved location in the n + 2 or n + 4 positions of tyrosine kinases, we decided to investigate the impact of the GST-Csk double mutant A316R,R318A. We were intrigued to find that this second mutation (A316R) led to substantial recovery of the activity lost with the single Csk mutant (R318A). The overallkcat for the kinase activity of the double mutant was about 100-fold greater than that of the single mutant (TableI). This rate acceleration confirms that the Arg residue could be displaced N-terminally two positions along the Csk protein backbone and still subserve a salutary effect on kinase action. This result also provides a functional explanation for the presence of a key Arg at two different positions in protein-tyrosine kinases. This catalytic flexibility further bolstered our hypothesis that rescue of R318A by intermolecular addition of small guanidinium-like molecules might be successful. Analysis of the kinase activity of R318A as a function of guanidinium concentration showed that substantial stimulation (20-fold) of the activity could be observed with maximal activation at around 50 mm guanidinium for 1 μm enzyme. As in other examples of chemical rescue, a high concentration is required for saturation of the active site with a small molecule, indicating that the affinity of the activator for the enzyme is relatively weak (12–23). The Km values for ATP (Km = 40 ± 4 μm) and poly(Glu,Tyr) (Km = 115 ± 10 μg/ml) were only modestly affected by the addition of 50 mm guanidinium to R318A. As a control, it was shown that neither wild type GST-Csk nor GST-Csk R318Q was significantly activated (<2-fold) by 50 mm guanidinium. These data suggest that the guanidinium molecule substitutes for the role played by the missing arginine side chain of the R318A mutant. As discussed above, chemical rescue of mutant enzymes has been observed in a number of systems, but to our knowledge this result represents the first such example for a mutant protein kinase. Based on the guanidinium rescue, a number of analogs were studied to learn more about the detailed structural requirements for kinase activation (Table II and Fig. 4). Alkyl-substituted guanidiniums were somewhat less active in kinase rescue than the unsubstituted version. Replacing one of the nitrogens of guanidinium with an oxygen atom resulted in an analog (urea) that showed no ability to activate the kinase mutant. Interestingly, replacement of one of the guanidinium NH2 groups with a methyl group led to an analog (acetamidinium) that showed kinase rescue similar to guanidinium. The truncated analog ethylamine, however, showed no kinase rescue activity. From the findings with these analogs, it appeared that two proton-donating nitrogens with at least one carrying a positive charge were necessary and sufficient for kinase rescue.Table IIActivation of poly (Glu, Tyr) phosphorylation by GST-Csk R318A with various compoundsActivatorRelative velocitynone1imidazole60acetamidinium28guanidinium201,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidinium194-methylimidazole15formamidinium102-methylimidazole51,2,3-triazole32-aminopyridine3l-arginine2ethyl, methyl, or 1,1-dimethylguanidium5–7urea, thiazole, 2-methyloxazoline, pyrimidine, ethylamine, ammonium, benzimidazole, 2-aOnly 10 mmbenzimidazole was used because of solubility.2-methyl-2-imidazoline1Relative velocities of GST-Csk R318A phosphorylation of poly(Glu, Tyr) (1 mg/mL) by ATP (100 μm) in the presence of 50 mm activator.

Open table in a new tab Relative velocities of GST-Csk R318A phosphorylation of poly(Glu, Tyr) (1 mg/mL) by ATP (100 μm) in the presence of 50 mm activator. Assays were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Error from duplicate runs was less than 10% for each assay. In an attempt to optimize kinase rescue, a series of 5- and 6-membered ring compounds were tested, and of these, imidazole was found to be the best activator of all the small molecules examined (Table II and Fig. 4). ∼100-fold activation was observed with imidazole at 100 mm concentration, yielding a kcatvalue that is only ∼30-fold below wild type and similar to that of the Csk A316R,R318A double mutant (see Fig. 5 A and Table I). As in the case of guanidinium, imidazole did not significantly activate wild type GST-Csk (<2-fold activation). Other analogs showed a range of rescue activities, but the general rule was upheld that two hydrogen bond donating nitrogens with one carrying a positive charge were necessary for activation. The above results are consistent with the x-ray structure of the insulin receptor protein-tyrosine kinase where two nitrogens of Arg-1136 are within hydrogen bonding distance of (∼3 Å from) the substrate tyrosine-phenol hydroxyl and the highly conserved, catalytically important aspartate (24Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 30Cole P.A. Grace M.R. Phillips R.S. Burn P.R. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22105-22108Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The enhanced rescue activity of imidazole versus guanidinium was unexpected and to our knowledge is the first example in enzymology of a chemical rescue of an arginine mutation with imidazole. In the case of the protein-tyrosine kinase rescue, the enhanced action of imidazole over guanidinium is rationalized as likely resulting from 1) the planar, aromatic 5-membered ring with its extra ethylene group having favorable intermolecular interactions with the enzyme and/or substrates or 2) the lower pKa value of the imidazolium ion versus the guanidinium ion increasing hydrogen bond strength with the phenol oxygen or Asp carboxylate. Further experimentation will be needed to reveal which structural features are important for rescue. Interestingly, GST-Csk R318H is a very poor kinase compared with wild type GST-Csk (observed velocity similar to unactivated GST-Csk R318A). This suggests that the geometry of the covalently attached imidazole side chain in R318H is not optimal for forming key interactions with the enzymes or substrates and is consistent with the absence of catalytic loop histidines in place of arginines in protein-tyrosine kinases in nature. Because imidazole and its analogs should be cell permeable, and significant activation of poly(Glu,Tyr) phosphorylation at concentrations as low as 10 mm imidazole is observed, the use of this activator as a rescue agent for mutant protein-tyrosine kinase activity may hold promise for cell biology applications. As a precursor to examining activation within cells, we felt it was important to examine the ability of imidazole to rescue the phosphorylation of a physiologic substrate by GST-Csk R318A in vitro. To function as an in vitro substrate of GST-Csk and mutants, the Src used in this experiment contained a K295M mutation that reduced its kinase activity (34Sondhi D. Xu W. Songyang Z. Eck M.J. Cole P.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A comparison of velocities of the phosphorylation of Src K295M showed a drop in Src K295M phosphorylation (∼500-fold) catalyzed by GST-Csk R318Aversus wild type GST-Csk. This diminished rate of Src K295M phosphorylation by GST-Csk R318A was stimulated ∼20-fold by 100 mm imidazole (Fig. 5 B), whereas imidazole showed no effect on the phosphorylation rate catalyzed by wild type GST-Csk. Therefore the arginine rescue approach also extends to a physiologic protein substrate for the protein-tyrosine kinase Csk. It is our hope that the imidazole rescue results shown here may ultimately be exploited in providing direct, kinetically controlled information about kinase function in cell signaling pathways. We are grateful to Paul Thompson for helpful discussions, Xin-Yun Huang for providing the Src expression plasmid, and Kyonghee Kim for preparing the GST-Csk expression plasmid."

Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 2Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 3Steiner D.F. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). The activity of these enzymes is thought to be crucial for the appropriate processing of numerous proprotein and prohormone precursors before their secretion from synthesizing cells. Whereas some proprotein convertases (furin, PACE4, PC5-B, and PC7) process proteins in the constitutive secretory pathway, others (PC1, PC2, and PC5-A) exhibit their greatest activity in the maturing granules of the regulated secretory pathway (4De Bie I.

PCs characteristically cleave their substrates right after a pair of basic amino acids and share a common domain structure that includes an N-terminal signal peptide, a profragment region, a conserved subtilisin-like catalytic domain, a conserved region named P-domain, which possibly regulates the calcium and pH dependences of the processing activity (8Zhou A. Martin S. Lipkind G. LaMendola J. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11107-11114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and a C-terminal region, in which the greatest divergence between PCs occurs. The expression of PC1 (also known as SPC3) is restricted to endocrine and neuroendocrine tissues where it is responsible for the processing of several prohormones, as is strikingly demonstrated by the recent finding of naturally occurring mutations in the PC1gene in a patient with severe obesity associated with elevated plasma levels of proinsulin and pro-opiomelanocortin levels (9Jackson R.S. Creemers J.W. Ohagi S. Raffin-Sanson M.L. Sanders L. Montague C.T. Hutton J.C. O'Rahilly S. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Like the prohormones it activates, PC1 is synthesized as an inactive precursor, pro-PC1. Although the prosegment of PC1 is rapidly removed in early compartments of the secretory pathway (10Benjannet S. Rondeau N. Paquet L. Boudreault A. Lazure Chretien M. Seidah N.G. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 11Zhou Y. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5615-5623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the additional cleavage of the 135-amino acid-long C-terminal domain of PC1, which occurs specifically in secretory granules, has been shown to increase dramatically the activity of the enzyme for certain substrates (5Jutras I.

Chem. 1994; 269: 18408-18413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This finding has led to a model whereby the C-terminal domain would, at least in part, inhibit PC1 activity in early compartments of the secretory pathway, thereby preventing activation of certain substrates prior to entry in the secretory granules (5Jutras I. Seidah N.G. Reudelhuber T.L. Brechler V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15184-15188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For this model to be valid, however, PC1 (with its C-terminal tail attached) would have to be targeted efficiently to secretory granules where it could subsequently be activated and cleave its substrate. Indeed, the C-terminal domain has been suggested to play a role in proper sorting of PC1 to the secretory granules (12Zhou A. Paquet L. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21509-21516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The mechanism of protein sorting to the regulated secretory pathway remains a matter of debate, and in contrast to many cellular sorting events that take place throughout the secretory pathway (14Letourneur F. Gaynor E.C. Hennecke S. Demolliere C. Duden Emr S.D. Riezman H. Cosson P. Cell. 1994; 79: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 15Munro S. Pelham H.R.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2424-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), a consensus signal sequence has not been identified for sorting of proteins to the secretory granules. The mechanisms that result in protein storage in mature granules are thought to occur at the level of the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and nascent immature secretory granules. Hypotheses for sorting can be summarized by two models that are not mutually exclusive (17Arvan P. Castle D. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 593-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The first model proposes the existence of sorting receptors, capable of specifically binding to a putative structural sorting domain and capable of pulling sorted proteins into immature secretory granules. It was recently proposed that carboxypeptidase E (CPE) was just such a sorting receptor for a wide variety of prohormones including proinsulin (18Cool D.R. Normant E. Shen F. Chen H.C. Pannell L. Zhang Loh Y.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), but this model has been challenged by the finding that proinsulin storage was not impaired in pancreatic islets from CPE-deficient (CPEfat/CPEfat) mice (19Irminger J.C. Verchere C.B. Meyer K. Halban P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27532-27534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) or in cell lines derived from pancreatic β-cells of these mice (20Varlamov O. Fricker L.D. Furukawa H. Steiner D.F. Langley S.H. Leiter E.H. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4883-4892Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The second model predicts non-restricted or bulk-flow entry of proteins into immature granules and subsequent removal of proteins destined to other cellular compartments, paralleled with specific retention of proteins stored in mature granules. Extrusion of proteins from immature granules could occur by a receptor-mediated mechanism or result from capture of soluble proteins in small vesicles budding from the immature granules (21Klumperman J. Kuliawat R. Griffith J.M. Geuze H.J. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 22Kuliawat R. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Several stored proteins have been shown to aggregate under the calcium and pH conditions that prevail in sorting compartments (23Chanat E. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1505-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 24Colomer V. Kicska G.A. Rindler M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 48-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) or to associate with phospholipids of the granule membrane (25Laine J. Lebel D. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). These characteristics are postulated to be important in removing regulated secretory proteins from the soluble phase and consequently for efficient retention of these proteins in maturing granules. Irrespective of the sorting mechanism, the proposed models are compatible with the existence of specific sorting domains in regulated secretory proteins. Thus, in the current study, we have investigated the function of the C-terminal domain of PC1 in protein sorting to the regulated secretory pathway. Our results suggest that a predicted α-helix in the structure of the C-terminal region is important in protein sorting to secretory granules, possibly by mediating protein binding to membranes in the sorting compartments of the secretory pathway. Numbers in the following constructs correspond to amino acids in native mouse PC1 beginning at the initial methionine. Construction of expression vectors for native mouse PC1 and PC1ΔC under the control of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter has been described previously (5Jutras I. Seidah N.G. Reudelhuber T.L. Brechler V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15184-15188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Expression vectors containing portions of the C-terminal domain of mouse PC1 fused to a portion of the Fc fragment of the mouse immunoglobulin IgG2b heavy chain (preceded by the signal peptide and 6 amino acids of the prosegment of prorenin (26Brechler V. Chu W.N. Baxter J.D. Thibault G. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20636-20640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar)) were constructed as follows. The stop codon of the IgG2b heavy chain was deleted by polymerase chain reaction with the following oligonucleotide, 5′-CGAGATCTTTACCCGGAGAC-3′ antisense primer preceding the stop codon (generation of a BglII site, underlined). The C-terminal portions of mouse PC1 were added in frame by cohesive ligation of BglII/BamHI sites using the following oligonucleotides (generation of a BamHI site is underlined): 5′-CGGGATCCTGTGGAGAAGCG-3′ sense primer for Fc-PC1-(627–753) and Fc-PC1-(627–670); 5′-CGGGATCCCATGCTGCGAC-3′ sense primer for Fc-PC1-(667–713) and Fc-PC1-(667–753); 5′-CGGGATCCCTCCAAGCT-3′ sense primer for Fc-PC1-(711–753; 5′-GCGGATCCTAGAGTCGCAGCATGG-3′ antisense primer for Fc-PC1-(627–670) (generation of a stop codon in bold); 5′-GCGGATCCTAAAGCTTGGAGGGCTT-3′ antisense primer for Fc-PC1-(667–713) (generation of a stop codon in bold). Mutations in the Fc-PC1(Pro745,Pro749) construct were inserted using the following overlapping oligonucleotides: 5′-CATGGACATCCcAAATGAG-3′ sense primer and 5′-GGATGTCCATGgGAGCTT-3′ antisense primer (mutated nucleotides are in lowercase). All recombinant plasmid constructions were verified by sequencing of double-stranded DNA. The rat somatomammotrophic GH4 and mouse corticotrophic AtT-20 cell lines were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2 and 10% CO2 respectively. Stably transfected GH4 cells were established by transfecting 2 × 106 cells with 2 μg of the PSVneo expression vector (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 18 μg of the appropriate expression vector in a calcium-phosphate precipitate. Stably transfected cells were selected by incubating in 0.8 mg/ml geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 5 days. For transient transfections, 5 × 106 AtT-20 cells were mixed with 50 μg of the appropriate plasmid construct and electroporated as described previously (26Brechler V. Chu W.N. Baxter J.D. Thibault G. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20636-20640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). GH4 cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells in 35-mm wells and transfected 6 h later with 20 μg of the appropriate expression vector using the Lipofectin Reagent method (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transiently transfected AtT-20 and GH4 cells were replated in 25-mm wells 24 and 48 h after transfection, respectively. The next day, the cells were depleted of methionine for 1 h in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum, labeled with 300 μCi of [35S]methionine per well (pulse), and incubated in complete medium for the indicated times (chase). At the end of the chase period, GH4 cells were incubated for 20 min in medium containing 50 mm NaCl (basal secretion) following which the medium was replaced, and the cells were further incubated for 20 min in medium containing 50 mm KCl (stimulation of granule release). Stimulated release from AtT-20 cells was assessed by incubating parallel wells in the presence or in the absence of 10 μm forskolin. Culture supernatants were then immunoprecipitated with protein A-Sepharose alone or with protein A Sepharose-coupled anti-N-terminal PC1 antibody as described previously (10Benjannet S. Rondeau N. Paquet L. Boudreault A. Lazure Chretien M. Seidah N.G. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and gels were subjected to fluorography. Intensity of the bands was estimated by scanning densitometry of autoradiograms using an Alpha Imager 2000 Digital Imaging System (Alpha Innotech Corp.). Transiently transfected AtT-20 cells, grown on glass slides, were fixed and permeabilized as described previously (26Brechler V. Chu W.N. Baxter J.D. Thibault G. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20636-20640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The cells were stained with an anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated to fluorescein (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in a 1:50 dilution (1% milk in PBS). Labeled cells were mounted using the SlowFade Light Antifade Kit (Moleculer Probes) and visualized using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc.). Digital images were prepared using Adobe Photoshop. GH4 cells transiently transfected with the appropriate expression vector were labeled 30 min with [35S]methionine and incubated for 2 h in fresh medium at 20 °C. The cells were then rinsed twice in cold PBS and incubated on ice for 15 min with 0.25 mm of disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) (Pierce) in PBS. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and the cells were lysed in 0.1% SDS and 1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with protein A-Sepharose. GH4 cells stably transfected with the appropriate expression vector were rinsed twice and scraped in cold PBS. All the subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. The cells were pelleted, washed once with homogenization buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 6, 0.25 m sucrose, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer, in five times the volume of the cell pellet. Postnuclear supernatants were obtained by spinning in a microcentrifuge at 4500 rpm for 15 min and were incubated for 15 min with gentle agitation after the addition of 0.03% saponin (to permeabilize membranes) (23Chanat E. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1505-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) and 100 mm NaCl. Samples were sonicated twice for 10 s at maximal intensity and spun in a microcentrifuge at maximum speed for 30 min. The supernatants (soluble fraction) were removed, and the pellets (membrane fraction) were washed once in homogenization buffer containing 100 mm NaCl. Fc-containing proteins in supernatants, rinse buffer, and pellets were immunoprecipitated with protein A-Sepharose. Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with an anti-mouse IgG antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein structure predictions according to the Chou-Fasman and Garnier-Osguthorpe-Robson algorithms were carried out using the Genetics Computer Group sequence analysis program. To investigate the role of the C-terminal domain of PC1 in sorting to the regulated secretory pathway, we tested whether its complete deletion would impair the storage of PC1 in secretory granules and alter its stimulated release from cells. GH4 cells were transfected with either native PC1 or PC1ΔC, a C-terminally truncated PC1 construct (Fig. 1). Transfected cells were labeled with [35S]methionine for 2 h, chased for an additional 2 h, and incubated in the presence of NaCl to estimate basal protein secretion and, subsequently, in the presence of KCl to stimulate the release of secretory granule content. Expression of native PC1 in GH4 cells resulted in the secretion of the 87- and 66-kDa forms corresponding to C-terminally uncleaved and C-terminally cleaved PC1, respectively. During the pulse labeling and chase periods, both constitutive secretion and basal secretion of secretory granules occurs. The C-terminally cleaved PC1, which is generated in the secretory granules, thus appears in the supernatant during these secretion periods. After the 2-h chase period, the neo-synthesized PC1 content of the secretory granules was assessed. The 66-kDa form underwent stimulated release from the cells with a 5.3-fold stimulation, indicating sorting of PC1 to the regulated secretory pathway. This result also indicates exhaustive PC1 C-terminal cleavage within secretory granules since the 66-kDa form represents the only detectable form stored in this compartment. Transfection of GH4 cells with PC1ΔC leads to direct expression of the 66-kDa form, but in contrast to native PC1, the 66-kDa form was no longer sorted to the regulated secretory pathway as judged from the very modest 1.7-fold stimulated secretion. Instead, PC1ΔC appeared to undergo rapid constitutive secretion from GH4 cells. These results indicate that targeting of PC1 to the regulated secretory pathway is dependent on its C-terminal tail, which can thus be considered as the major granule-sorting domain of PC1. To characterize further the sequences in the C-terminal tail of PC1 that are responsible for its sorting to the regulated secretory pathway, various portions of the C-terminal domain were fused to a segment of mouse immunoglobulin 2b heavy chain (corresponding to part of the Fc fragment). We then tested whether the C-terminal tail of PC1 could function in rerouting the constitutively secreted Fc protein to the regulated secretory pathway (Fig. 2). While the Fc fragment alone (Fc) was not apparently sorted to secretory granules in transfected GH4 cells, as evidenced by the weak 1.58-fold increase in its secretion by potassium (TableI), an Fc fusion protein containing the entire C-terminal tail of PC1 (Fc-PC1 627–753) underwent stimulated release from the cells with a mean 3.25-fold stimulation (Table I). Furthermore, when the C-terminal domain was hooked up to a signal peptide followed by the hemagglutinin epitope (HA-1), the fusion protein was also found to undergo stimulated release (not shown). These results demonstrate that the C-terminal region of PC1 can function as a dominant sorting domain in the context of the Fc fusion protein.Figure 1The C-terminal domain of PC1 targets PC1 to the regulated secretory pathway. Stimulated release from GH4 cells was assessed in cells transfected with expression vectors for native PC1 or the C-terminally deleted PC1ΔC. A schematic representation is shown for each construct, indicating the signal peptide (sp), the proregion (pro), the subtilisin-like catalytic domain (catalytic), the P domain (P), the C-terminal domain (C-term), and its cleavage site (arrow). The cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 2 h (P), chased in complete medium for 2 h (Ch), and incubated during two subsequent 20-min periods, first in 50 mm NaCl and then in 50 mm KCl. Labeled PC1 proteins were immunoprecipitated from the supernatants after each period with an antibody directed against the N-terminal portion of PC1 and separated on SDS-PAGE.

Open table in a new tab Fc fusion proteins containing various portions of the C-terminal domain of PC1 were expressed in GH4 cells in order to identify the minimal sorting domain (Fig. 2). Results indicate that all the fusion proteins were expressed at comparable levels in the transfected cells and generated similar levels of secreted proteins during the pulse-labeling (not shown) and chase periods, suggesting that mis-folding was not a major problem. The mean values of stimulus-dependent secretion demonstrate that the peptide region spanning amino acids 627–670 was inefficient in sorting the Fc fusion protein to secretory granules (Table I). In contrast, portions spanning either amino acids 667–713 or 711–753 of the C-terminal domain resulted in stimulation folds comparable to that obtained with the entire C-terminal tail. Therefore, the C-terminal region of PC1 contains at least two minimal sorting domains (amino acids 667–713 and 711–753) that do not act additively since their combined presence did not augment the sorting efficiency of the fusion protein containing both regions (Fc-PC1-(667–753)). Efficient retention of Fc-PC1 proteins was not a particularity of GH4 cells since the same fusion proteins were also sorted into secretory granules of AtT-20 cells from which stimulated release of the labeled proteins could still be observed after an overnight chase period (Fig. 3 C and data not shown). Although primary sequence comparison of the two minimal sorting domains of the PC1 C-terminal tail did not reveal an apparent homologous peptide sequence, secondary structure predictions indicated that both the 667–713 and 711–753 regions were expected to contain an α-helix. In addition, nuclear magnetic resonance and circular dichroism spectroscopy of a peptide comprising amino acids 727–753 indicate that this peptide indeed forms an amphipathic α-helix. 2C. Lazure, personal communication. To test whether this structure could be involved in sorting of the fusion protein to the regulated secretory pathway, we altered this structure in Fc-PC1-(711–753) by converting two leucine residues at positions 745 and 749 to proline residues. Structural algorithms predict that this change, in contrast to more subtle changes that we have tested, ensures specific disruption of the predicted α-helix in the C-terminal portion of the resulting Fc-PC1-(711–753) fusion protein (Fig. 3 A). As shown in Fig. 3 B, the proline mutations did not reduce expression of the fusion protein in GH4 cells but dramatically reduced sorting to secretory granules. Indeed, Fc-PC1(Pro745,Pro749) showed a mean value of stimulus-dependent secretion comparable to the Fc protein alone (Table I), indicating constitutive secretion of the mutated fusion protein. Since long chase periods cannot be performed with GH4 cells because of their high rate of basal secretory granule release as mentioned above, AtT-20 cells were used to verify the altered retention of the fusion protein with the mutated α-helix. After an overnight chase period in labeled AtT-20 cells, Fc-PC1-(711–753) could still be released from the cells upon stimulation (Fig. 3 C); however, Fc-PC1(Pro745,Pro749) was undetectable in the supernatant, consistent with the absence of storage of this fusion protein in secretory granules. Immunofluorescence labeling carried out to confirm the intracellular localization of the fusion proteins was consistent with the results obtained from stimulated release assays in transfected cells. In AtT-20 cells transfected with Fc-PC1-(711–753), fluorescence could be detected at the tips of the cellular processes where the secretory granules are known to be localized (Fig. 4). However, in AtT-20 cells expressing the mutant Fc-PC1(Pro745,Pro749) construct, the bulk of the fluorescence was observed in a para-nuclear region consistent with localization of the protein passing through the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 4). Taken together, these results suggest that sorting of Fc-PC1 fusion proteins to the secretory granules is achieved by a mechanism dependent on the presence of an α-helical structure in the sorted protein. Whereas an α-helix appears to be necessary for sorting of the Fc-PC1 fusion proteins to the regulated secretory pathway, it is unclear whether this structure confers some necessary property to the protein itself (such as aggregation) or whether it enables the PC1 C-terminal domain to interact with other proteins that contribute to PC1 entry in nascent secretory granules. To test if specific protein-protein interactions were involved in selective sorting of Fc-PC1 fusion proteins, intracellular cross-linking in transfected GH4 cells was performed. Following a short labeling period, GH4 cells were chased for 1 h at 20 °C to block protein export from the TGN, the intracellular compartment where the sorting mechanism is expected be functional. The cells were then incubated with a membrane-permeable cross-linker (DSS) on ice for 15 min. Following lysis of the cells, the different species of Fc-containing proteins produced from the cross-linking reaction were immunoprecipitated. As shown in Fig. 5, less than 5% of total immunoprecipitated Fc appeared as a protein species of higher molecular weight, indicating little proximal protein association with Fc. In contrast, at least a third of the immunoprecipitated Fc-PC1 proteins were present as protein species of higher molecular weight, corresponding to the sizes expected for dimers of each fusion proteins. Cross-linked Fc-PC1-(667–753) and Fc-PC1-(711–753) proteins were also observed when the chase was performed at 37 °C, indicating the protein complex was stable following entry in secretory granules (not shown). However, at least 30% of Fc-PC1-(627–670), which is not efficiently sorted to secretory granules (Table I), also appeared incorporated in cross-linked protein species (Fig. 5), indicating that this characteristic could not discriminate between fusion proteins sorted to the constitutive or regulated secretory pathways. Although portions of the C-terminal region of PC1 mediate close protein interactions, most probably the formation of dimers, these interactions do not correlate with protein sorting to the secretory granules. To determine if sorting of Fc-PC1 fusion proteins involved specific membrane association of the stored proteins, a crude membrane fraction was prepared from GH4 cells stably transfected with the appropriate construct. Cells were homogenized in pH and calcium conditions resembling those present in the trans-Golgi network (23Chanat E. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1505-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 27Demaurex N. Furuya W. D'Souza S. Bonifacino J.S. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2044-2051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and the post-nuclear supernatants were sonicated in the presence of saponin, to favor complete disruption of vesicles, before pelleting the membranes. As shown in Fig. 6, at least half of the total immunoprecipitated Fc-PC1-(667–713) and Fc-PC1-(711–753) proteins, which are sorted to secretory granules (Table I), were found associated with the membrane pellet. In contrast, Fc-PC1-(627–670) and Fc-PC1(Pro745,Pro749), which are not sorted to the secretory granules (Table I), were mostly found in the supernatant with approximately 20% of the total immunoprecipitated proteins in the membrane pellet. These results indicate that the portions of the C-terminal region of PC1 capable of targeting an Fc fusion protein to the secretory granules also mediate binding of the fusion protein to membranes within the sorting compartments of the secretory pathway. The present results provide clear evidence that the C-terminal region of PC1 contains one or more peptide sequences capable of acting as sorting domains to the regulated secretory pathway. These results are in agreement with a previous report in which a C-terminally truncated form of PC1 was shown to undergo constitutive secretion from transfected AtT-20 cells (12Zhou A. Paquet L. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21509-21516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although mutations in the conserved RRGDL motif in the P domain of the PC1 convertase also result in impaired sorting of the protein (28Lusson J. Benjannet S. Hamelin J. Savaria D. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 29Rovere C. Luis J. Lissitzky J.C. Basak A. Marvaldi J. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12461-12467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), these mutations lead to substantial degradation of the mutant PC1 proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting that the mutant proteins are improperly folded. In contrast, several studies have shown that C-terminal deletions do not lead to improper folding of PC1 but rather to efficient expression of a form of the enzyme with enhanced proteolytic activity (5Jutras I. Seidah N.G. Reudelhuber T.L. Brechler V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15184-15188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12Zhou A. Paquet L. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21509-21516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 30Zhou Y. Rovere C. Kitabgi P. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24702-24706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, the inefficient sorting of PC1 missing its C-terminal tail is not likely due to improper folding of the protein. We have previously shown that the C-terminal domain of PC1 partially inhibits the activity of PC1 in the constitutive secretory pathway, a mechanism that could explain the observed secretory granule-specific processing of certain proproteins by PC1 (5Jutras I. Seidah N.G. Reudelhuber T.L. Brechler V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15184-15188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain thus ensures targeting of PC1 activity to the regulated secretory pathway by two mechanisms both presumed to occur in the TGN as follows: first, by partially inhibiting its catalytic activity prior to PC1 entry in the secretory granules, and second, by mediating sorting of the protein to the secretory granules. The search for the minimal sorting domain in the C-terminal region of PC1 revealed that two independent segments were sufficient to target an Fc fusion protein to the regulated secretory pathway. Both of these segments contained regions predicted to form α-helices. Disruption of the predicted α-helix in the sorting domain that composes the last 40 amino acids of the C-terminal region resulted in constitutive secretion of the fusion protein, suggesting that the helical structure is crucially important for protein targeting to the secretory granules and that this α-helix could represent the minimal requirement for granule sorting to occur. Insertion of the L745P and L749P mutations in the entire PC1 resulted in premature cleavage of the C-terminal region in the secretory pathway, making it impossible to judge the role of this α-helix on the sorting of native PC1 because the sorting domain is lost prematurely (data not shown). Data on the three-dimensional structure of PC1 protein will evidently be informative in defining the multiple interactions involving the C-terminal domain as well as the functional importance of these interactions. The reaction of Fc-PC1 fusion proteins with cross-linking agents in the TGN did not reveal specific associations with other proteins residing in the TGN such as chromogranins, which have been shown to enhance the storage of endogenous hormones in AtT-20 cells (31Natori S. Huttner W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4431-4436Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In addition, if a specific sorting receptor contributes to protein entry in nascent secretory granules, an expected Fc-PC1-receptor complex should have been observed with fusion proteins undergoing sorting to secretory granules. In line with this, when a fusion protein containing the entire C-terminal tail of PC1 was overexpressed in AtT-20 cells, the sorting to the secretory granules of both the fusion protein and PC1 (which is endogenously expressed in these cells) appeared unaltered, indicating that the sorting mechanism was not easily saturable (not shown). Our results are thus consistent with the sorting of PC1 not occurring by a saturable protein-receptor-mediated mechanism. Our analysis of membrane preparations demonstrated that the fusion proteins, which had been shown to undergo efficient sorting to secretory granules, were consistently found associated with the membrane pellet. In addition, this feature could clearly distinguish proteins sorted to secretory granules from constitutively secreted proteins. Based on these observations, we propose that the amphipathic α-helix in the C-terminal region of PC1 mediates binding to lipid components of the membrane in the TGN or the immature granules. Association with membranes could serve in removing PC1 from the soluble phase and preventing its entry in constitutive-like vesicles budding from immature granules (17Arvan P. Castle D. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 593-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The interaction of the C-terminal domain with membranes might induce a conformational change, which possibly triggers the C-terminal autocatalytic cleavage and subsequent maximal activation of the enzyme, events known to occur in the secretory granules. The C-terminal domain has been postulated to be involved in membrane binding of the protein because of the predicted amphipathic helical segment near its extremity (32Seidah N.G. Marcinkiewicz M. Benjannet S. Gaspar L. Beaubien G. Mattei M.G. Lazure C. Mbikay M. Chretien M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 33Smeekens S.P. Avruch A.S. LaMendola J. Chan S.J. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Previous studies that have investigated the association of PC1 with the membrane fraction have not found a requirement of the C-terminal domain for membrane association (34Hill R.M. Ledgerwood E.C. Brennan S.O. Pu L.P. Loh Y.P. Christie D.L. Birch N.P. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2318-2326Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 35Vindrola O. Lindberg I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1088-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, it is possible that some of the methods used to prepare membrane fractions lead to incomplete lysis of the secretory granules in which the C-terminally truncated form of PC1 would then remain trapped. Studies with CPE have suggested a link between the capacity of the protein to associate with membranes and CPE targeting to the secretory granules, since the C-terminal region of CPE, which also contains a putative amphipathic α-helix, has been shown to mediate membrane binding of both CPE and an albumin fusion protein (36Mitra A. Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19876-19881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yet the role of membrane binding in targeting CPE to the secretory granules was recently questioned because fusion proteins containing portions of the C-terminal of CPE underwent constitutive secretion even though they appeared to associate with membranes (37Varlamov O. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6077-6083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although the correlation we have observed between the association of Fc-PC1 fusion proteins with membranes and their sorting to secretory granules could be circumstantial, the dramatic effect of the L745P and L749P mutations in disrupting both membrane binding and protein sorting suggests that these interactions are indeed involved in the sorting process. Binding of regulated secretory proteins to the phospholipid constituents of membranes has been shown to occur in an acidic pH-dependent manner (25Laine J. Lebel D. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Whether the interaction of the C-terminal domain of PC1 with specific lipid microdomains is involved in the retention of PC1 in secretory granules remains to be determined. We are grateful to Dr. Véronique Brechler for initiating these studies by preparing the PC1ΔC construct and to Dr. Christian Deschepper for critical reading of the manuscript.

The extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1 MAPK) pathway was one of the first phosphorylation cascades to be well characterized following mitogenic stimulation by peptide growth factors (1Boulton T.G. Yancopoulos G.D. Gregory J.S. Slaughter C. Moomaw C. Hsu J. Cobb M.H. Science. 1990; 249: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Specifically, the steps following the engagement of specific growth factor receptor at the plasma membrane include the activation of the small G-protein Ras, with Ras·GTP then directly interacting with and regulating the activation of the Ser/Thr kinase, Raf. Raf in turn phosphorylates the dual specificity kinase MEK (MAPK kinase), which then phosphorylates and activates the ERK MAPKs. This signaling cascade of Ras → Raf → MEK → ERK MAPKs has been implicated in the regulation of cellular differentiation, transformation, and proliferation through activation of intracellular substrates including transcription factors, such as Elk-1, c-Jun, and ATF2, and other protein kinases, including p90RSK (2Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3188) Google Scholar).Other subfamilies of Ser/Thr kinases, collectively called stress-activated MAPKs, have been characterized following their preferential activation in response to extracellular stress stimuli such as osmotic shock, UV light, oxidative stress, low pH, or heat shock (3Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2408) Google Scholar). These stress-activated protein kinases, which include the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase MAPKs (JNK MAPKs) and p38 MAPKs, act within phosphorylation cascades that show overall similarity in organization but are distinct from the ERK MAPK cascade (4Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). Thus the stress-activated protein kinases are regulated by distinct dual specificity kinases that are in turn regulated by specific upstream kinases. These kinase pathways are implicated in signaling apoptosis, cell differentiation, and transformation (4Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar).Although specific MAPKs function exclusively within their respective pathways, it has been recently shown that a single stimulus can activate two or more MAPK cascades to varying degrees (5Canman C.E. Kastan M.B. Nature. 1996; 384: 213-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 6Rausch O. Marshall C.J. J. Biol.

Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5027) Google Scholar). The regulation of a cellular response may therefore be the result of several signaling cascades working in concert. It is now clear that the ERK MAPKs can be activated by various stress stimuli including heat shock, hydrogen peroxide, arsenite, and osmotic shock (8Chen F. Torres M. Duncan R.F. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 9Muda M. Boschert U. Dickinson R. Martinou J.C. Martinou I. Camps M. Schlegel W. Arkinstall S. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 18: 5178-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This dispels the earlier model of ERK MAPK activation exclusively by mitogenic stimuli (1Boulton T.G. Yancopoulos G.D. Gregory J.S. Slaughter C. Moomaw C. Hsu J. Cobb M.H. Science. 1990; 249: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar).It still remains to be clarified whether all forms of cellular stress and mitogenic stimuli activate identical signaling events to activate the ERK MAPKs. The increasing complexity of these signaling events revealed through recent research suggests that this is not the case. Although a number of studies have demonstrated that the classical pathway of Ras → Raf → MEK mediates ERK MAPK activation in response to oxidative stress and arsenite (10Aikawa R. Komuro I. Yamazaki T. Zuo Y. Kudoh S. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Yazaki Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1813-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 11Chen W. Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. Liu Y. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar), the ERK MAPK activation following exposure to pervanadate was not mediated by this series of events (13Krady M.-M. Malviya A.N. Dupont J -L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This has led to the suggestion that there may be MEK-independent routes to ERK MAPK activation when cells are exposed to different forms of stress (13Krady M.-M. Malviya A.N. Dupont J -L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar).In the current study, we have investigated heat shock-induced activation of the MAPK cascades in the IL3-dependent, murine pro-B cell line, BaF3. Surprisingly, we have now found that heat shock stimulated the phosphorylation and activation of the ERK MAPKs. Furthermore, the “stress-activated” JNK MAPKs but not the p38 MAPKs were phosphorylated and activated. The robust activation of ERK MAPK was unexpected. We focused on characterizing the delayed kinetics of ERK MAPK activation following heat shock. This suggested a novel stress-activated signaling pathway to ERK MAPKs which, in addition, was more potent than that elicited following the exposure to the cytokine IL3. We have demonstrated that heat shock activates ERK MAPKs via a pathway that involves MEK but is independent of Ras and Raf activation. We present evidence that suggests that heat shock activated the ERK MAPKs, not through a sequence of upstream “on” signals but instead by deactivating a serine/threonine phosphatase-dependent “off” signal. The resulting activation of ERK MAPKs appears to play a role in maintaining cell viability following the heat shock insult.DISCUSSIONIt is now recognized that both the extent and kinetics of ERK MAPK activation are critical determinants of the cellular response to growth factors and cytokines (35Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar). Transient ERK MAPK activation is most commonly associated with cellular proliferation, whereas prolonged ERK MAPK has been associated with nuclear translocation of these kinases and cellular differentiation (36Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Presumably the translocation of ERK MAPKs to the nucleus following prolonged activation permits access to different subsets of transcription factor substrates essential for the differentiation process (35Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar).There is now increasing evidence that activation of the ERK MAPKs can also be stimulated by a variety of stress stimuli. In most cases, ERK MAPK activation in response to these stresses is transient. For example, ERK MAPK activation by hydrogen peroxide, arsenite, or osmotic stress is maximal within 10–20 min and rapidly returns to basal levels within the 1st hour of exposure (11Chen W. Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5178-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 12Guyton K.Z. Liu Y.S. Gorospe M. Xu Q.B. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 8922-8931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Heat shock has been well documented as a stress that initiates long term changes within cells. The best characterized of these changes is the stimulation of heat shock protein synthesis in a protective response to prevent further cell damage (39Benjamin I.J. McMillan D.R. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 40Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 1151-1191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, heat shock has been proposed as an experimental method for enhancing heat shock protein synthesis to protect against further cell insults such as ischemia (39Benjamin I.J. McMillan D.R. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Few studies have considered earlier events in the detection of heat shock by cells or whether heat shock also activates cytoplasmic protein kinase signaling cascades. In a number of cell types, heat shock apparently fails to activate ERK MAPKs but does activate the stress-activated MAPKs such as the JNK MAPKs (3Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2408) Google Scholar, 38Elbirt K.K. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R, J. Bonskovsky H.L. J. Biol.

However, these responses are apparently cell type-dependent, and heat shock prevents activation of JNK MAPKs and p38 MAPKs in U937 cells but does activate ERK MAPKs in H56 hepatoma cells, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, human HeLa cells, human KB carcinoma cells, or during whole animal hyperthermia (41Gabai V.L.

In all of these examples, the activation of ERK MAPK was not examined beyond an initial 60 min of heat shock, and so any long term effect on signaling pathways was not evaluated.In the present study, we have demonstrated that ERK and JNK MAPKs, but not p38 MAPKs, are activated by 42 °C heat shock at 60 and 120 min (Fig. 1). In the heat-shocked BaF3 cells, we observed maximal phosphorylation and activation of JNK MAPKs at 60 min. Due to the lack of a specific chemical inhibitor of the JNK MAPKs and their complex pathways of upstream regulators, the elucidation of the mechanisms underlying this activation and its subsequent cellular effects would prove difficult. Furthermore, the activation of JNK MAPKs by heat shock was first reported when these protein kinases were cloned (3Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2408) Google Scholar) and has been subsequently shown in numerous studies (for recent examples see Refs. 46Meriin A.B. Yaglom J.A. Gabai V.L. Mosser D.D. Zon L. Sherman M.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2547-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 47Li S. Chien S. Branemark P.I. J. Orthop.

Therefore, we further examined the activation of ERK MAPKs by heat shock, concentrating on the mechanism of activation and the possible downstream events regulated by this signal transduction pathway.We characterized the kinetics of ERK MAPK activation in the IL3-dependent proB cell line BaF3 as sustained at maximal levels over a 2-h period (Fig. 2). We have observed similar results in the IL3-dependent myeloid cell line NFS-60.2Activation was also delayed (Fig. 2), and this suggested that in these cells ERK MAPK is activated either by a novel pathway or by the classical MAPK pathway following the release of growth factors and/or cytokines.Apart from these important aspects of the long duration and delayed nature of ERK MAPK activation by heat shock in our system, it was also apparent that the level of ERK MAPK activation exceeded that stimulated by the cytokine IL3 (Fig. 2). IL3 is a critical requirement for the proliferation and survival of these cells. We were therefore interested in identifying the upstream events stimulated by heat shock that would potently activate the ERK MAPKs. Specifically we evaluated whether heat shock stimulated the well characterized Ras → Raf → MEK → ERK MAPK cascade or whether a more potent alternative pathway to ERK MAPK activation may be recruited when these cells were stressed by exposure to elevated temperatures. An alternative pathway could provide a rational approach to designing alternative ways to stimulate ERK MAPKs in these cells, thus altering cell proliferation and/or survival, independent of the effects of IL3.MEK was implicated in heat shock signaling in the BaF3 cells when we showed that the MEK-specific inhibitor, PD98059, inhibited heat shock-stimulated ERK activity (Fig. 4). The specificity of this inhibitor has been documented (21Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar), and it is now widely used in evaluating the functional consequences of ERK MAPK activation. Furthermore, heat shock stimulated phosphorylation of MEK.2However, the current study also demonstrated that a dominant-negative mutant of Ras (RasAsn-17) failed to attenuate heat shock stimulation of ERK MAPK activity (Fig. 5). This was confirmed when we demonstrated that Ras·GTP levels were not elevated during heat shock (Fig. 6). These data support a model in which a Ras-independent signaling pathway leads to potent ERK MAPK activation under these stress conditions.It has been previously reported that the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade can be regulated independently of Ras through PKC directly regulating Raf through serine phosphorylation (49Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummerl R. Vahidl H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). Although this Ras-independent, PKC-dependent mechanism has only been infrequently reported to follow stimulation with a stress factor (50Ping P. Zhang J. Cao X. Li R.C.X. Kong D. Tang X.-L. Qiu Y. Manchikalapudi S. Auchampach J.A. Black R.G. Bolli R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: H1468-H1481PubMed Google Scholar, 51Zhuang S. Hirai S.I. Ohno S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C102-C109Crossref Google Scholar), the role of PKC was nevertheless investigated. We have subsequently eliminated participation of PKC in heat shock signaling when a PKC-specific chemical inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide I, and down-regulation of phorbol ester-sensitive PKC isoforms upon prolonged TPA exposure failed to attenuate consistently heat shock-stimulated ERK MAPK activity (data not shown). More surprisingly, additional analysis of Raf activation revealed that none of the three Raf isoforms (Raf-1, A-Raf, and B-Raf) were activated during the 1st hour of heat shock (Fig. 7).We have further established that heat shock-stimulated ERK MAPK activity does not involve an autocrine release of growth factors or cytokines. There is some evidence that supports cytokine induction following whole body heat shock (52Robins H.I. Kutz M. Wiedemann G.J. Katschinski D.M. Paul D. Grosen E. Tiggelaar C.L. Spriggs D. Gillis W. d'Oleire F. Cancer Lett. 1995; 97: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is evidence that the activation of ERK MAPKs in response to stress may be mediated by an autocrine release of growth factors or cytokines then acting via their specific receptors to stimulate the classical Ras-dependent ERK MAPK pathway (11Chen W. Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5178-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 12Guyton K.Z. Liu Y.S. Gorospe M. Xu Q.B. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). Most of this evidence comes from the use of suramin that has been demonstrated to bind to heparin-binding growth factor receptors such as the epidermal growth factor receptor, fibroblast growth factor receptor, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (28Stein C.A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2239-2248PubMed Google Scholar, 53Baird A. Schubert D. Ling N. Guillemin R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2324-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). To examine whether growth factor receptors may be involved in our system, we exposed BaF3 cells to suramin before and during the heat shock treatment. We found that suramin attenuated the heat shock activation of ERK MAPKs (Fig. 8,A and B). We sought further support for a role of growth factors, and we noted that heat shock-stimulated ERK MAPK activity remained sustained following a 60-min recovery period (Fig. 8 C). This supported the idea that heat-shocked BaF3 cells were producing secondary signaling molecules, which would remain to stimulate the pathway even after the removal of the heat shock stimulus.When we continued investigation of the involvement of growth factors, we found that medium conditioned in the presence of heat-shocked cells failed to stimulate ERK MAPK activity.2 This indicated that any autocrine growth factors were not released into media. This may be possible when cell surface-binding proteoglycans, such as heparin sulfate, bind growth factors and act as growth factor reservoirs to facilitate ligand receptor interaction at the cell surface (53Baird A. Schubert D. Ling N. Guillemin R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2324-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Alternatively, heat shock may stimulate ERK MAPK activity through a more direct influence on the growth factor receptors. The physical state of the cell membrane has been recognized to change in response to stress such as increased temperature, and this may modulate membrane-associated events such as receptor activation (54Vigh L. Maresca B. Harwood J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 369-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In support of this general notion, the exposure of cells to ultraviolet light and osmotic stress perturbs the cell surface and alters the conformation of a number of different receptors leading to their clustering, activation, and subsequent alterations in MAPK signaling (55Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Similarly, the activation of the platelet-derived growth factor-α receptor following mechanical stress of vascular smooth muscle cells occurs by perturbation of the receptor without engagement of the platelet-derived growth factor-binding site of the receptor (56Hu Y. Metzler B. Xu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9113-9119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, our failure to observe enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation following heat shock (Fig. 3) also opens the question of whether a growth factor-mediated pathway is in operation.More recently there have been reports of ERK activity being regulated by mechanisms other than the traditional Raf → MEK → ERK MAPK cascade. Meriin et al. (46Meriin A.B. Yaglom J.A. Gabai V.L. Mosser D.D. Zon L. Sherman M.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2547-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) described the activation of JNK MAPKs by heat shock through a decreased rate of protein dephosphorylation (46Meriin A.B. Yaglom J.A. Gabai V.L. Mosser D.D. Zon L. Sherman M.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2547-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In this model, the basal activity of the MAPKs and MEK of non-stimulated cells is controlled by various serine/threonine phosphatases such as PP1 and PP2A. If the phosphatases are inhibited in any way, phosphorylation of their substrates will be favored. We have shown that okadaic acid, an inhibitor of the serine/threonine kinases PP1 and PP2A, stimulated ERK activity and MEK phosphorylation with delayed kinetics which resembled the activation following exposure to heat shock (Fig. 9). Surprisingly, the stimulation of MEK and ERK MAPK by okadaic acid was also sensitive to inhibition by suramin (Fig. 9), presumably revealing another nonspecific action of suramin in addition to its effects on a number of important intracellular signal transduction regulators including protein-tyrosine phosphatases, PKC, Cdc2, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (see Ref. 58Zhang Y.-L. Keng Y.-F. Zhao Y. Wu L. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12281-12287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar and references therein). We propose that heat shock may activate MAPKs through the novel mechanism of inhibiting serine/threonine phosphatases.The potent activation of ERK MAPK prompted our investigation into the physiological role that potent activation of ERK MAPK may play in heat shock signaling. We should emphasize, however, that we have not discounted a role for JNK MAPKs in the response to heat shock, but rather we have chosen to focus on the effects that the potentially-protective ERK MAPK pathway may play by exploiting the use of the specific MEK inhibitor PD98059 (21Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar). Heat shock is synonymous with the universal down-regulation of general transcription and translation with a concurrent increase in the production of a set of specific proteins, termed heat shock proteins (HSPs) (40Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 1151-1191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins serve protective roles against cellular damage caused by the stress stimuli (39Benjamin I.J. McMillan D.R. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Transcription of several HSPs, such as Hsp70, have been found to be regulated by heat shock transcription factor 1. Although there is some evidence that heat shock transcription factor 1 can be phosphorylated by MAPKs in vitro, the regulation of HSPs by these kinases remains undefined (59Kim J. Nueda A. Meng Y.-H. Dynan W.S. Mivechi N.F. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 67: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated a relationship between ERK MAPK activity and cell viability. Attenuation of ERK MAPK activity with a MEK-specific inhibitor (PD98059) resulted in a loss of viability (Fig. 10), suggesting the activation of the ERK MAPK cascade may be involved in maintaining long term cell survival. This confirms previous studies demonstrating the requirement for ERK MAPK for cell survival following exposure to stress stimuli (e.g. Refs. 12Guyton K.Z. Liu Y.S. Gorospe M. Xu Q.B. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar, 57Finlay D. Healy V. Furlong F. O'Connell F.C. Keon N.K. Martin F. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 302-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, and 60Cho S.Y. Klemke R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar).In summary, we propose a model whereby the signaling mechanism activated by heat shock for 60 min involves a deactivation of serine/threonine phosphatases that negatively regulate MEK and ERK. A recent study suggests phosphatase regulation by a chaperone heat shock protein (46Meriin A.B. Yaglom J.A. Gabai V.L. Mosser D.D. Zon L. Sherman M.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2547-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism of phosphatase regulation of ERK MAPK signaling will require further investigation. The cellular responses to a huge variety of external stimuli are mediated by sophisticated arrays of phosphorylation cascades. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1 MAPK) pathway was one of the first phosphorylation cascades to be well characterized following mitogenic stimulation by peptide growth factors (1Boulton T.G. Yancopoulos G.D. Gregory J.S. Slaughter C. Moomaw C. Hsu J. Cobb M.H. Science. 1990; 249: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Specifically, the steps following the engagement of specific growth factor receptor at the plasma membrane include the activation of the small G-protein Ras, with Ras·GTP then directly interacting with and regulating the activation of the Ser/Thr kinase, Raf. Raf in turn phosphorylates the dual specificity kinase MEK (MAPK kinase), which then phosphorylates and activates the ERK MAPKs. This signaling cascade of Ras → Raf → MEK → ERK MAPKs has been implicated in the regulation of cellular differentiation, transformation, and proliferation through activation of intracellular substrates including transcription factors, such as Elk-1, c-Jun, and ATF2, and other protein kinases, including p90RSK (2Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3188) Google Scholar). Other subfamilies of Ser/Thr kinases, collectively called stress-activated MAPKs, have been characterized following their preferential activation in response to extracellular stress stimuli such as osmotic shock, UV light, oxidative stress, low pH, or heat shock (3Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2408) Google Scholar). These stress-activated protein kinases, which include the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase MAPKs (JNK MAPKs) and p38 MAPKs, act within phosphorylation cascades that show overall similarity in organization but are distinct from the ERK MAPK cascade (4Ky"

In this study, we investigated the structures, regulations of expression, and putative functions of these transcripts. Northern blot, rapid amplification of cDNA ends-polymerase chain reaction, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and sequencing experiments demonstrated that they are antisense RNAs complementary to theMCH gene. Two classes of antisense RNAs could be discriminated as follows: 1) non-coding unspliced RNAs that overlap mainly the coding part of the MCH gene; 2) spliced variant mRNAs complementary to the 3′-flanking end of the MCHgene and that encode putative proteins containing DNA/RNA binding domains. We named this new transcriptional unit AROM forantisense-RNA-overlapping-MCH gene. Spliced variant AROM mRNAs are expressed in a broad range of rat organs. Western blot and immunohistochemistry experiments revealed several proteins with cytoplasmic but also nuclear localization in PC12 cells. Time course studies during nerve growth factor and lithium treatment of PC12 cells indicated a reciprocal regulation of theMCH and AROM gene transcripts, reflected also at the level of AROM proteins. The major translational product is a 64-kDa protein (AROM-p64). Recombinant AROM-p64 displayed high binding to single-stranded DNA and poly(A) homopolymers suggesting that this protein could play a role in mRNA maturation/metabolism.

Hoeger C. Rivier J. Vale W. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 1660-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Synthesis of MCH was localized almost exclusively in a large population of neurons present in the zona incerta and lateral hypothalamus area of the mammalian brain (3Skofitsch G. Jacobowitz D.M.

The MCH axonal network projected widely throughout the brain and posterior pituitary but innervated poorly the external part of the median eminence in resting animals (5Bittencourt J.C. Presse F. Arias C. Peto C. Vaughan J. Nahon J.L. Vale W. Sawchenko P.E. J. Comp. Neurol. 1992; 319: 218-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). This particular cellular and axonal distribution argued in favor of a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator role for MCH in a large spectrum of functions in the central nervous system (reviewed in Refs. 6Baker B.B.

Recently, several laboratories have demonstrated changes in different behaviors following intracerebroventricular injection of MCH in the rat brain. In particular, MCH plays a particularly important role in the regulation of feeding behavior and associated pathologies such as obesity (8Presse F. Sorokovsky I. Max J.P. Nicolaidis S. Nahon J.L.

Given the important biological functions of MCH, it is of great interest to define the mechanisms that regulate the expression of its cognate gene. A single MCH-encoding gene has been identified in both rat and mouse (12Thompson R.C. Watson S.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 13Breton C. Presse F. Hervieu G. Nahon J.L. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1993; 4: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and two distinct MCH gene systems have been found in primates (14Breton C. Schorpp M. Nahon J.L. Mol. Brain. Res. 1993; 18: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 15Viale A. Ortola C. Richard F. Vernier P. Presse F. Schilling S. Dutrillaux B. Nahon J.L. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1998; 15: 196-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The regulation of MCH gene expression has been most extensively investigated with in vivo models (reviewed in Ref. 7Nahon J.L. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1994; 8: 221-262PubMed Google Scholar). However, we established recently that production of mature MCH mRNA (0.95 kb in length) can be induced in PC12 cells following treatment with nerve growth factor (NGF) and lithium (16Presse F. Cardona B. Borsu L. Nahon J.L. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 52: 270-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 17Presse F. Borsu L. Cardona B. Nahon J.L. Pretel S. MCH and Seizures: Neuromolecular and Neuroendocrine Aspects. Research Signpost, Trivandrum, India1997: 31-42Google Scholar). Interestingly, we identified MCH RNA species of high molecular weight (1.4, 3.5, and 4.0 kb in length) in unstimulated PC12 cells; those transcripts transiently disappearing after a short term treatment with NGF and lithium. Because the increase in MCH mRNA content was not apparently associated with transcriptional activation, we hypothesized that some of the largeMCH gene-related transcripts could be involved in the regulation of the processing or degradation of the MCH mRNA (16Presse F. Cardona B. Borsu L. Nahon J.L. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 52: 270-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 17Presse F. Borsu L. Cardona B. Nahon J.L. Pretel S. MCH and Seizures: Neuromolecular and Neuroendocrine Aspects. Research Signpost, Trivandrum, India1997: 31-42Google Scholar). In the present study, we described the isolation and characterization of the high molecular weight MCH RNAs in PC12 cells and in rat tissues. Interestingly, they are derived from a new gene located on the opposite DNA strand to the MCH gene, with extensive overlap existing between the 3′ end of this gene and the MCH transcriptional unit. Some of the antisense MCH RNAs display alternative splicing and encode new DNA/RNA-binding proteins, whereas other putative transcripts lack extensive open reading frames suggesting different functions for the two classes of antisense MCH RNAs. PC12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium or RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 5% fetal calf serum, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin as described elsewhere (16Presse F. Cardona B. Borsu L. Nahon J.L. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 52: 270-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were plated in 100-mm dishes and used at about 107 cells/dish on the day of the experiments. Inducers were added to the culture medium at the final concentration of 50 ng/ml NGF (laboratory-made preparation) and 20 mm LiCl. At the end of the treatments, cells were washed twice with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution and directly used for RNA or protein extraction. Adult (3 months; 180–250 g) male Wistar rats (Institut de Pharmacologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire-CNRS, Valbonne, France) were maintained in a 12-h light-dark cycle with food and water given ad libitum. Hypothalamus and different peripheral tissues (colon, jejunum, ileum, spleen, lung, liver, testis, thymus, kidney, muscle, heart, stomach, and hypophysis) were carefully dissected, immediately frozen in dry ice, and stored at −80 °C until required. Total RNA was extracted by a phenol-guanidinium isothiocyanate method (18Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). RNA samples were electrophoresed through a 1.2% agarose-gel containing 2.2m formaldehyde, transferred to Hybond (N) nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and UV-cross-linked with a Stratagene apparatus. The RNA blot was incubated at 42 °C for 5 h in a prehybridization buffer containing 50% (v/v) formamide as described previously (Presse et al. (16Presse F. Cardona B. Borsu L. Nahon J.L. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 52: 270-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)). Hybridization was performed overnight in the same buffer with 32P-labeled cDNA or oligoprobes (see DNA probes below). Washing was performed successively twice in 5× SSPE (1× SSPE is 0.18 m NaCl, 0.01 m NAH2PO4), (pH 7.4), 0.1% SDS, and 2× SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 50–60 °C. Filters were visualized by exposing them against X-Omat AR film at −70 °C with intensifying screens for 3–10 days). The levels of expression of specific mRNAs were quantified by using a computerized image analysis system (bioimaging analyzer, BAS-1500, Fujifilm). The rat MCH cDNA probe was pRMCH 11 cDNA (19Nahon J.L. Presse F. Bittencourt J.C. Sawchenko P. Vale W. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 2056-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The rat tyrosine hydroxylase cDNA probe was a fragment of pT51 cDNA (20Grima B. Lamouroux A. Blanot F. Faucon Biguet N. Mallet J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Open table in a new tab RACE reactions were performed according to the user manual of Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH Laboratories) with 1 μg of total RNAs isolated from PC12 cells grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium in the absence of NGF and lithium. Oligoprimers used for the first PCR were RMCH6/AP1 and RMCH20/AP1 for identification of the 5′ and 3′ ends of the antisense MCH RNAs, respectively (see Table I). Composition of RACE-PCR buffer and added components were as described previously (15Viale A. Ortola C. Richard F. Vernier P. Presse F. Schilling S. Dutrillaux B. Nahon J.L. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1998; 15: 196-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The PCR profile was 94 °C, 1 min, followed by 5 cycles, with 30 s at 94 °C, 4 min at 72 °C, then 5 cycles with 30 s at 94 °C, 4 min at 70 °C and finally 25 cycles with 20 s at 94 °C and 4 min at 68 °C. To improve specificity, secondary PCRs were performed using 5-μl aliquots of a 1:50 dilution of the primary PCR solution with oligoprimers ARMCH2/AP2 and RMCH2/AP2 for the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively (see Fig. 3 B), using the same PCR profiles as described above except that only 20 cycles were performed at the last step. Specific fragments were identified by Southern blotting analysis with genomic probes. Total RNAs from tissues were reverse-transcribed with oligo(dT) or the specific primer 9, and the subsequent PCRs were performed under conditions described elsewhere (16Presse F. Cardona B. Borsu L. Nahon J.L. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 52: 270-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) with primers shown in Table I and Fig. 5 A. The reaction products were analyzed on a 0.8% agarose gel, blotted onto nylon membrane (Hybond N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), probed with MCH genomic probes (see Fig. 1 A), and autoradiographed. Bands of interest corresponding to RACE or RT-PCR products were excised from 0.8% agarose gels, purified using Wizard PCR Peps DNA purification (Promega, France), and sub-cloned in pGEM-T easy vector (Promega).Escherichia coli XL1 bacteria were transformed by high voltage electroporation (1500 V, 282 ohms, 40 microfarads) with a 2-μl aliquot of the ligation mixture. Plasmids from individualized colonies were prepared and sequenced as described elsewhere (16Presse F. Cardona B. Borsu L. Nahon J.L. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 52: 270-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Antisera were raised against glutathione S-transferase (GST)-AROM fusion proteins and prepared as described below. DNA sequences encoding rat AROM-p50 and AROM-p17 proteins were amplified and subcloned into the pGEX3X vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in frame with the sequence of GST. Constructs were checked by sequencing. Fusion protein expression was induced by adding 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. After 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separation and copper staining, GST-AROM-p50 and GST-AROM-p17 fusion proteins were excised from acrylamide gels and lyophilized. New Zealand female rabbits were immunized with 400 μg of fusion protein in the presence of complete Freund's adjuvant and boosted 1 month later with 200 μg of the immunogen and incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Rabbits were bled 15 days after the last boost. Crude antiserum was sequentially incubated 16 h at 4 °C with 500 μg of GST and with 500 μg of fusion protein previously transferred to Hybond C-extra nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Specific antibodies were recovered by a 2-min elution with 0.1 mglycine, 5.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Immediately after elution, purified antibodies were brought to pH 7.6 with 1 m Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 0.5% BSA. A PCR product encoding mouse AROM-p64 was obtained by amplifying a cDNA clone (GenBankTM accession number AA139022) and subcloned initially in the pGEM-T easy vector. A DNA fragment encoding rat AROM-p50 was purified after amplification by RT-PCR of total RNA from unstimulated PC12 cells. Sequence was checked before the fragment encompassing AROM-p64 or AROM-p50 was introduced into a pVL1392 vector (PharMingen). pVL-AROM-p64 or pVL-AROM-p50 vector was co-transfected with linearized baculovirus DNA (BaculoGold, PharMingen) into Sf9 cells following the manufacturer's recommendations. Supernatant containing recombinant viruses was harvested 72 h after transfection. Expression of AROM-p64 or AROM-p50 in infected Sf9 cells was checked by immunoblot analysis of total proteins as described below. Baculovirus infected Sf9 cells were harvested 72 h after infection, washed with PBS solution, and lysed at 4 °C with a buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mm iodoacetamide. The cell suspension was homogenized and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Pellet and supernatant were stored at −20 °C until use. Total proteins extracts from PC12 cells were prepared after washing the cells twice with PBS 1× and putting them in a lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% aprotinin) with 0.3% Nonidet P-40 and complete inhibitor protease (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Proteins were isolated from the nucleus and cytoplasm according to a method derived from Greenberg and Ziff (22Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B. Nature. 1984; 311: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2009) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were sonicated, and proteins were stored as described above. Rat tissues were homogenized using a Potter apparatus in buffer containing 15 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA (pH 7.5), 2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.25 msucrose, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Triton X-100. The suspension was then centrifuged at 1000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was retained for further studies. Protein samples were denatured with 2% β-mercaptoethanol in Laemmli's sample buffer, separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto a Hybond C-extra membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Non-fat dry milk (5% in TBS) was used as blocking agent (1 h at room temperature) and for antibody dilutions. Primary antibodies were incubated 16 h at 4 °C. Dilutions of the primary antibodies are indicated in the figure legends, and the secondary antibody (Immunotech F(ab′)2) was used at 1:2500 dilution. Blots were washed after incubation with either primary or secondary antibodies, with a solution of TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Antibody complexes were revealed by chemiluminescence (ECL +, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). PC12 cells (passage 16–17) were placed on coverslips precoated with 0.25 mg/ml polylysine (Sigma) and grown for 24 h as described above. The cells were washed with PBS solution and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. The slides were incubated for 20 min with 3% normal goat serum, 0.1 m Tris-buffered saline (TBS solution) in 0.5% BSA. Then primary antiserum was applied for 45–90 min at room temperature in 1× TBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100 (Ol 72 Ab, Ha 43 Ab a preimmune serum at 1/500 final; anti-mouse tyrosine hydroxylase (Chemicon) at 1/400 final). After two washings in TBS solution, anti-IgG from sheep or mouse coupled to peroxidase (AEC substrate; Sigma) was used to reveal AROM immunoreactivity and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity, respectively. Controls to ensure non-cross-reactivity of secondary antisera with inappropriate antigens were carried out and were negative. DNA/RNA affinity chromatographies were performed essentially as described by Kadonaga (23Kadonaga J.T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 10-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells that produced mouse AROM-p64 or rat AROM-p50 were lysed either with a solution containing 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and complete inhibitor protease (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (solution A) or in the same buffer where 12.5 mm MgCl2 replaced 0.2 mm EDTA (solution B). Sf9 cell sonicate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, and the pellet and supernatants were stored at −20 °C. Denatured calf thymus DNA-conjugated to agarose or cellulose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used for DNA binding reactions. Ribonucleotide polymers (poly(A) and poly(U) from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and poly(C) and poly(G) from Sigma) were used for RNA binding reactions. 200 μl of pellet containing AROM proteins was incubated at 4 °C for 1–3 h with RNA- or DNA-conjugated agarose/cellulose-Sepharose beads. After a brief spin in a microcentrifuge, the beads were pelleted, and the supernatant (BT) was stored. The beads were washed four times with 150 μl of binding buffer (solution A or B) to remove unspecific protein binding. Generally, bound protein was eluted from DNA/RNA resins by successive washings with increased ionic strengths (150 μl of solution A or B containing from 0.2 to 1.0 m KCl). Finally, the beads were washed once with 40 μl of the solution A or B and denatured with 2% β-mercaptoethanol Laemmli's sample buffer. Proteins were analyzed by Western blots as described below. We determined first the degree of overlapping with the MCH gene of the large transcripts identified in PC12 cells. Identical Northern blots containing two RNA samples (lanes A and B; Fig. 1 B) isolated from untreated control cells (C), or treated with NGF/lithium for 12 h (T12), were hybridized either with a MCH cDNA probe, different MCH PCR fragments covering the flanking regions of theMCH gene (probes A–D), or sense oligoprobes RPCR4 and RMCH6 (Fig. 1 A). Hybridization with 32P-labeled MCH cDNA probe confirmed the expression of large MCH transcripts of 4.0, 3.5, and 1.4 kb in unstimulated PC12 cells (C samples) and revealed the absence of the largest transcripts in 12 h-treated cells (T12 samples) (Fig. 1 B, top right panel). As expected (16Presse F. Cardona B. Borsu L. Nahon J.L. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 52: 270-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the 0.95-kb band, which corresponds to mature MCH mRNA, was identified by using the MCH cDNA probe only in the NGF/lithium-treated PC12 cells (T12 samples). The 4.0-kb transcript was identified with genomic probes B–D as well as MCH cDNA probe demonstrating that this transcript overlaps the coding region of the MCH gene and extends into both the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions. However, probe A did not display hybridization to the 4.0-kb RNA in the C samples suggesting that it does not extend far upstream from the 5′ end of the MCHgene. Interestingly, the 3.5-kb RNA species was clearly detected with probes C and D but not with probes A and B suggesting that this transcript contains essentially sequences of the 3′-flanking region of the MCH gene. In sharp contrast, the 1.4-kb RNA species was visualized with probe B but not with probes A, C, and D indicating that this RNA overlaps essentially with the immediate 5′-flanking region of the MCH gene. Finally, hybridization with oligoprobes RPCR4 and RMCH6 revealed a pattern similar to this found with probe B, suggesting that at least the 4.0- and 1.4-kb RNA species must be transcribed in the opposite direction to that encoding the MCH mRNA. By using additional Northern blot analysis, antisense RNAs corresponding to the 1.4-kb transcripts were further demonstrated with single-stranded MCH RNA probe (data not shown). We used a RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) protocol to characterize the antisense MCH RNAs. By using primer RMCH2, we found only cDNAs ending with a stretch of dT residues in untreated PC12 cells, confirming the synthesis of antisense MCH mRNA (Fig. 2 B). Further evidence that this was the true orientation was the presence of canonical poly(A) addition sites at the expected distances from the A regions in these RACE-PCR products (bracket in Fig. 3). In contrast, extension of the cDNAs using primers oriented in the opposite direction (including ARMCH2) produced numerous RACE products lacking a poly(dT). Bands corresponding to a broad range in length of RACE products were purified, subcloned into a PGEM-T cloning vector, and sequenced (Fig. 2 B). All the RACE products overlapped the coding part and large portions of the 3′-flanking region of the MCH gene but differed markedly in their 5′ end and exhibited internal heterogeneity. These observations indicate that a gene extending past the 3′-flanking region of the MCH gene but on the opposite DNA strand generates several transcripts through alternative promoter use or/and alternative splicing. We named this new gene AROM forantisense-RNA-overlapping-MCH gene (Fig. 2 A, GenBankTM accession number nkit 356009; AF303035). We screened one gene data base (GenBankTM) and an"
https://openalex.org/W1991574778,"The novel pore-forming toxin hemolysin E (HlyE, ClyA, or SheA) consists of a long four-helix bundle with a subdomain (beta tongue) that interacts with target membranes at one pole and an additional helix (alpha(G)) that, with the four long helices, forms a five-helix bundle (tail domain) at the other pole. Random amino acid substitutions that impair hemolytic activity were clustered mostly, but not exclusively, within the tail domain, specifically amino acids within, adjacent to, or interacting with alpha(G). Deletion of amino acids downstream of alpha(G) did not affect activity, but deletions encompassing alpha(G) yielded insoluble and inactive proteins. In the periplasm Cys-285 (alpha(G)) is linked to Cys-87 (alpha(B)) of the four-helix bundle via an intramolecular disulfide. Oxidized HlyE did not form spontaneously in vitro but could be generated by addition of Cu(II) or mimicked by treatment with Hg(II) salts to yield inactive proteins. Such treatments did not affect binding to target membranes nor assembly into non-covalently linked octameric complexes once associated with a membrane. However, gel filtration analyses suggested that immobilizing alpha(G) inhibits oligomerization in solution. Thus once associated with a membrane, immobilizing alpha(G) inhibits HlyE activity at a late stage of pore formation, whereas in solution it prevents aggregation and consequent inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2328149883,"The chimeric gene EWS/FLI-1, the hallmark of the Ewing's sarcoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumor family, encodes a fusion protein with enhanced transcriptional activation properties and preserved recognition of canonical ETS binding sites. Although EWS/FLI-1 alters the expression of various genes, the precise mechanism by which EWS/FLI-1 acts as an oncogene remains to be defined. In this study we report that members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, ERK1 and ERK2, are constitutively activated in NIH 3T3 cells expressing EWS/FLI-1. Interference with ERK activation by either highly specific inhibitors of MEK1 or a dominant negative ras mutant profoundly impaired the ability of EWS/FLI-1 to transform NIH3T3 cells to growth in semi-solid medium. An EWS/FLI-1 mutant defective in DNA-binding and transcriptional activation failed to activate ERK and was also defective in 3T3 cell transformation. Constitutive ERK activation was also evident in several human Ewing's sarcoma tumor-derived cell lines. Interestingly, cells expressing the type II EWS/FLI-1 fusion, recently demonstrated more potent in transcriptional activation, showed even greater MAPK activation than cells expressing the more common type I fusion. These results implicate ERK activation in EWS/FLI-1 transformation and suggest that this signaling pathway may be important in the pathogenesis of Ewing's sarcoma."
https://openalex.org/W2053461052,"Alloproteins, proteins that contain unnatural amino acids, have immense potential in biotechnology and medicine. Although various approaches for alloprotein production exist, there is no satisfactory method to produce large quantities of alloproteins containing unnatural amino acids in specific positions. The tyrosine analogue azatyrosine,l-β-(5-hydroxy-2-pyridyl)-alanine, can convert theras-transformed phenotype to normal phenotype, presumably by its incorporation into cellular proteins. This provided the stimulus for isolation of a mutant tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) capable of charging azatyrosine to tRNA. A plasmid library of randomly mutatedEscherichia coli tyrS (encoding TyrRS) was made by polymerase chain reaction techniques. The desired TyrRS mutants were selected by screening for in vivo azatyrosine incorporation of E. coli cells transformed with the mutanttyrS plasmids. One of the clones thus isolated, R-6-A-7, showed a 17-fold higher in vivo activity for azatyrosine incorporation than wild-type TyrRS. The mutant tyrS gene contained a single point mutation resulting in replacement of phenylalanine by serine at position 130 in the protein. Structural modeling revealed that position 130 is located close to Asp182, which directly interacts with tyrosyladenylate. Kinetic analysis of aminoacyl-tRNA formation by the wild-type and mutated F130S TyrRS enzymes showed that the specificity for azatyrosine, measured by the ratios ofkcat/Km for tyrosine and the analogue, increased from 17 to 36 as a result of the F130S mutation. Thus, the high discrimination against azatyrosine is significantly reduced in the mutant enzyme. These results suggest that utilization of F130S TyrRS for in vivo protein biosynthesis may lead to efficient production of azatyrosine-containing alloproteins.

Makabe O. Nagahara H. Nishimura S. Mol. Carcinogen. 1989; 2: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The same phenomenon was also observed with the human pancreatic cancer cell line PSN-1; these cells have an activated c-Ki-ras mutation (G12R), a p53 mutation, and c-myc amplification (1Shindo-Okada N. Makabe O. Nagahara H. Nishimura S. Mol. Carcinogen. 1989; 2: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, NIH3T3 cells transformed by hst or srcwere not converted to the normal phenotype on treatment with azatyrosine (1Shindo-Okada N. Makabe O. Nagahara H. Nishimura S. Mol. Carcinogen. 1989; 2: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). When c-erbB-2-transformed NIH3T3 cells were treated with azatyrosine, phosphorylation of c-Raf and c-Jun was inhibited, whereas the amount of GTP-bound Ras p21 and phosphorylation of c-ErbB-2 were not altered (2Monden Y. Nakamura T. Kojiri K. Shindo-Okada N. Nishimura S. Oncol. Rep. 1996; 3: 33-40PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggested that the azatyrosine effect is somewhere in the ras signal transduction pathway. Several indirect lines of evidence indicated that the effect of azatyrosine on conversion of the transformed phenotype to normal is due to its incorporation into cellular protein (3Monden Y. Nakamura T. Kojiri K. Shindo-Okada N. Nishimura S. Oncol. Rep. 1996; 3: 625-629PubMed Google Scholar). Radioactive azatyrosine was incorporated into a small amount of cellular protein, and the amount of azatyrosine incorporated decreased upon the addition of tyrosine to the tissue culture medium, concomitant with the inability to convert the transformed phenotype to normal (3Monden Y. Nakamura T. Kojiri K. Shindo-Okada N. Nishimura S. Oncol. Rep. 1996; 3: 625-629PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of azatyrosine needed for phenotype conversion was quite high (250–500 μg/ml) (1Shindo-Okada N. Makabe O. Nagahara H. Nishimura S. Mol. Carcinogen. 1989; 2: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 2Monden Y. Nakamura T. Kojiri K. Shindo-Okada N. Nishimura S. Oncol. Rep. 1996; 3: 33-40PubMed Google Scholar, 3Monden Y. Nakamura T. Kojiri K. Shindo-Okada N. Nishimura S. Oncol. Rep. 1996; 3: 625-629PubMed Google Scholar). This hampered further study of the crucial protein(s) involved in phenotype conversion by azatyrosine incorporation. Previously, we showed that a chemically synthesized epidermal growth factor fragment containing azatyrosine in place of tyrosine is not efficiently phosphorylated by epidermal growth factor receptor kinase (4Monden Y. Hamano-Takaku F. Shindo-Okada N. Nishimura S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 886: 109-121Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that the activity of a protein important in the ras signal transduction pathway is affected by having azatyrosine instead of tyrosine. To aid further analysis of azatyrosine function, a mutant tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS)1 was desired that would charge azatyrosine efficiently to tRNA. We used Escherichia coli for this purpose because of the ease of genetic manipulation and tyrS mutant selection. Furthermore, if such a mutanttyrS became available, it could be used (together with theE. coli tRNATyr gene) for transfection of mammalian cells to bring about selective incorporation of azatyrosine into particular protein positions because E. coli TyrRS and tRNATyr do not recognize mammalian TyrRS and tRNATyr and thus do not cross-charge (5Doctor B.P.

Plasmids pQE-YRS and pQE-F130S were constructed by introducing the wt TyrRS gene and F130S gene, respectively, downstream of the histidine tag gene of the pQE-30 vector (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) for purification. Azatyrosine,l-β-(5-hydroxy-2-pyridyl)-alanine, was prepared in the Banyu Tsukuba Research Institute from the culture broth ofStreptomyces sp. S.E.-1346 (FERM BC-1536) by the method of Inoue et al. (9Inoue S. Shomura T. Tsuruoka T. Ogawa Y. Watanabe H. Yoshida J. Niida T. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1975; 23: 2669-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The purity of this azatyrosine preparation was shown to be more than 99.9% by high performance liquid chromatography. l-[Methylene-3H]azatyrosine was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Two oligonucleotides were synthesized. Primer 1 (5′-ATGGCAAGCAGTAACTTGA-3′) was located near the 5′-end of the TyrRS gene (8Barker D.G. Bruton C.J. Winter G. FEBS Lett. 1982; 150: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Primer 2 (5′-GAATACTCATACTCTTCCT-3′) was located in the pBR322 gene near the SspI cloning site.E. coli tyrS was amplified and mutagenized by a modified polymerase chain reaction method using the synthesized primers as described by Leung et al. (10Leung D.W. Chen E. Goeddel D.V. Technique (Phila. ). 1989; 1: 11-15Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction products were digested with MunI, 25 base pairs from 5′-end of the TyrRS gene and SspI, and inserted into pYRS instead of the wt TyrRS gene at theSspI/MunI site to generate a mutant library. The library of the recombinant randomly mutated plasmids was introduced into E. coli JM109. Single colonies of the transformants were picked and transferred to the wells of 96-well plates with 100 μl of M9 minimum medium. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h, and 20 μl of cultures were transferred to filtration plates (MHVB N45 plate; Millipore) with 100 μl of M9 medium containing l-[3H]tyrosine or l-[3H]azatyrosine at final concentrations of 0.5 μm. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, 50 μl of 5% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) were added into each well of the filtration plates. The precipitates were filtered and washed three times with 5% TCA, and then the filtration plates were dried, and 50 μl of liquid scintillator (MICROSCINT-0; Packard) were added to each well. Radioactivities were measured with a microplate liquid scintillation counter (TopCount; Packard). The transformant in which the incorporation ratio of azatyrosine to tyrosine was higher than that in E. coli JM109 transformed by pYRS (JM109/pYRS) was selected. JM109/pYRS and E. coli JM109 transformed by pF130S (JM109/pF130S) were inoculated into M9 minimum medium and incubated at 37 °C. After the A600reached about 0.6, 20-μl portions of cultures were transferred to MHVB N45 plates with 100 μl of M9 medium containingl-[3H]tyrosine orl-[3H]azatyrosine at a final concentration of 50 μm. After further incubation for 10 min, 50 μl of 5% TCA were added. The precipitates were filtered, and radioactivities were measured with a microplate liquid scintillation counter. JM109/pQE-YRS or JM109/pQE-F130S were cultured in 2 liters of LB medium at 37 °C and harvested when A600 reached 0.8. The expression of histidine tag-fused wt TyrRS (His-wt TyrRS) or thistidine tag-fused F130S (His-F130S) was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at a final concentration of 1 mm, followed by incubation with vigorous shaking at 37 °C for 3.5 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 15 min. The cell pellets were washed twice with 0.85% NaCl. The cell pellets were then resuspended in buffer A (50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol) and lysed by sonication. PEG8000 was added to the lysates at a final concentration of 7.5%, and the lysates were centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatants were applied to a Ni-NTA column (Qiagen), and proteins were fractionated using a 0–500 mm imidazole gradient in buffer A. Fractions containing His-wt TyrRS or His-F130S were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50% glycerol. Using purified His-wt TyrRS or His-F130S, aminoacylation assays were performed at 30 °C for 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, or 120 s in 40 μl of reaction mixture containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1.6 mm ATP, 3.2 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 5–50 mg/ml E. coli unfractionated tRNA, 1–50 nmHis-wt TyrRS or 5–50 nm His-F130S TyrRS, and 1–60 μml-[3H]tyrosine or 3–125 μml-[3H]azatyrosine. The reaction mixtures were spotted on Whatman 3MM filter disks presoaked in 10% TCA. The disks were then washed with 10% TCA, and radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. The initial rate was determined at various tyrosine or azatyrosine concentrations from the time course. Kinetic parameters were obtained from Lineweaver-Burk plots according to the procedures as described previously (11Hoben P. Söll D. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 12Sever S. Rogers K. Rogers M.J. Carter Jr., C. Söll D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). TheKm and kcat values ofE. coli wt TyrRS for tyrosine were in good agreement with those published previously by Buorocore et al. (13Buorocore V. Harris M.H. Schlesinger S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4843-4849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). JM109/pYRS and JM109/pF130S were inoculated into M9 minimum medium and grown to 0.5A600 at 37 °C. Two hundred μl of cultures were then inoculated into 1 ml of M9 medium containingl-[3H]tyrosine orl-[3H]azatyrosine at a final concentration of 50 μm, incubated with vigorous shaking at 37 °C for 10 min, and centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 10 min. The cell pellets were resuspended in 20 μl of loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 700 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 0.0 1% bromphenol blue, and 1% glycerol) and boiled for 10 min. Aliquots of these crude lysates (15 μl) were developed by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and proteins were visualized by silver staining. For localization of radiolabeled proteins, the gel was dried at 80 °C, exposed to an imaging plate (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan) for 4 days, and then analyzed with BAS2000 (Fuji Film). A three-dimensional structure model ofE. coli TyrRS was constructed on the basis of the x-ray crystal structure of Bacillus stearothermophilus TyrRS complexed with tyrosinyl adenylate in the Protein Data Bank (14Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P., E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26227) Google Scholar), entry3TS1 (15Brick P. Bhat T.N. Blow D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 83-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). This x-ray crystal structure lacks residues of a disordered C-terminal domain (319 to 418), but the region is far from the binding pocket of tyrosyl adenylate. Therefore, the model of E. coliTyrRS does not have residues corresponding to 319–418 of B. stearothermophilus TyrRS. Protein modeling was performed on a workstation NEC EWS 4800/350 using the BIOCES[E] program (NEC Co., Tokyo, Japan). The backbones and side chains of the insertion regions and the side chains of the substituted amino residues were minimized on a Silicon Graphics Power Indigo2 using a Chemistry at Harbard Molecular mechanics force field (16Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13767) Google Scholar). A distance-dependent dielectric constant was used. The docking of tyrosyl adenylate into the model was performed manually on the basis of the structure of the B. stearothermophilusTyrRS and tyrosyl-adenylate complex. For alloprotein synthesis in vivo, we wanted to generate an E. coli TyrRS mutant that could recognize azatyrosine efficiently. This is not an easy task, because with few exceptions (17Kohno T. Kohda D. Haruki M. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6931-6935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Koide H. Yokoyama S. Kawai G. Ha J.-M. Oka T. Kawai S. Miyake T. Fuwa T. Miyazawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6237-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases recognize their natural counterpart more efficiently than unnatural amino acids (19Ibba M. Kast P. Hennecke H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7107-7112Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). At first we attempted a directed approach inspired by the B. stearothermophilusTyrRS crystal structure (15Brick P. Bhat T.N. Blow D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 83-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). We realized that the amino acid residues in the tyrosine binding site (YCGFD at positions 37–41) are conserved in E. coli TyrRS and reasoned that mutagenesis of these residues might be the best way of changing the substrate specificity of TyrRS. However, extensive cassette mutagenesis failed to generate any mutant TyrRS with the desired properties. 2F. Hamano-Takaku, T. Iwama, S. Saito-Yano, K. Takaku, Y. Monden, M. Kitabatake, D. Söll, and S. Nishimura, unpublished results. Changes in these amino acids may cause too much debilitation of amino acid recognition (20Fersht A.R. Shi J.-P. Knill-Jones J. Lowe D.M. Wilkinson A.J. Blow D.M. Brick P. Carter P. Waye M.M.Y. Winter G. Nature. 1985; 314: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar, 21Lowe D.M. Winter G. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6038-6043Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore we attempted random mutagenesis of the whole tyrS gene followed by large-scale screening. Error-prone, efficient polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis (10Leung D.W. Chen E. Goeddel D.V. Technique (Phila. ). 1989; 1: 11-15Google Scholar) was used. After re-cloning, the mutant plasmid population was transformed into E. coli cells, and the incorporation of radioactive azatyrosine was measured. The chromosomal wt tyrS copy in the E. coli transformants did not interfere in the assay because its gene product was expressed much less (about 1%) than the mutant genes on the plasmids (data not shown). Using this screening method, we selected one positive clone (R-6-A-7) among the 1,400 transformants analyzed. To examine in detail azatyrosine incorporationin vivo of the R-6-A-7 clone, we measured incorporation of [3H]azatyrosine or [3H]tyrosine into the TCA-insoluble fraction of the JM109/pYRS and R-6-A-7 clones. The amount of tyrosine incorporated into protein in the R-6-A-7 transformed strain was 4.9-fold lower than that of JM109/pYRS (Fig. 1). In contrast, the amount of azatyrosine incorporated by the R-6-A-7 clone was 3.6-fold higher than that incorporated by JM109/pYRS. Thus, compared with tyrosine, the R-6-A-7 clone had a 17-fold higher ability to incorporate azatyrosine into protein. Plasmid DNA was purified from R-6-A-7 cultures, and its DNA sequence was determined by dideoxy sequencing. Analysis revealed that the mutanttyrS gene had two changes: (a) at residue 389 (from T to C), and (b) at residue 903 (from T to C). The former change results in an amino acid replacement of Ser instead of Phe at position 130, whereas the second mutation is silent (the third position in a tyrosine codon). Position 130 is not located in the tyrosine binding site as defined by the B. stearothermophilus TyrRS crystal structure (15Brick P. Bhat T.N. Blow D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 83-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). This mutant was designated F130S, and clone R-6-A-7 was renamed JM109/pF130S. The mutant TyrRS is temperature-sensitive. Preincubation of the pure enzyme at 50 °C for 10 min almost completely inactivated F130S, whereas this treatment did not affect wt TyrRS (data not shown). However, the enzyme was stable enough to be purified and analyzed. Because the wt enzyme had the same specific activity in both the unmodified and His-tagged forms, we purified the His-tagged versions of the wt and F130S enzyme by Ni-NTA column chromatography and determined the Km and kcat values for tyrosine and azatyrosine (Table I). TheKm of F130S for tyrosine was almost 20-fold higher than that of wt TyrRS, showing that affinity of F130S to tyrosine was greatly reduced. On the other hand, the Km of F130S for azatyrosine was only increased 2-fold over that of wt TyrRS. The specificity against azatyrosine can be determined from the ratios ofkcat/Km for the two amino acids: the specificity constant (22Gay G.D. Duckworth H.W. Fersht A.R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 23Agou F. Quevillon S. Kerjan P. Mirande M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11309-11314Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) is 36 for wt TyrRS, whereas it is only 19 for the F130S mutant. Clearly, the mutant has a greatly reduced discrimination against azatyrosine. Combined with the fact that its Km for tyrosine is very much above physiological tyrosine levels (24Tempest D.W. Meers J.L. Brown C.M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1970; 64: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), it is understandable why E. coli transformed with the F130S plasmid incorporates much of azatyrosine into protein (Fig. 1).Table IAminoacylation kinetics of normal and mutated TyrRSs with tyrosine or azatyrosineEnzymeSubstrateTyrosineAzatyrosineWild type Km(μm)3.3 ± 0.817.7 ± 2.9 kcat (s−1)0.74 ± 0.060.11 ± 0.02F130S Km(μm)66.1 ± 16.537.6 ± 6.3 kcat (s−1)1.4 ± 0.30.042 ± 0.020 Open table in a new tab To confirm that azatyrosine is incorporated into some nascent polypeptide chain without the interruption of peptide elongation, we cultured E. coli cells with [3H]azatyrosine or [3H]tyrosine and fractionated the lysate of the cells by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 2, many high molecular weight proteins were detected in the lysate of E. coli cultured with [3H]azastyrosine, and JM109/pF130S had a higher activity for incorporation of azatyrosine into protein in vivo than did E. coli with wt TyrRS (lanes 6 and 8). It is of interest that the density and the pattern of azatyrosine-containing proteins are different from those of tyrosine-containing proteins. Azatyrosine may not be evenly incorporated into all proteins but preferentially incorporated into particular ones. To find out more about how the F130S substitution affects aminoacylation of azatyrosine and tyrosine, we examined the crystal structure of B. stearothermophilus TyrRS complexed with tyrosyl adenylate (15Brick P. Bhat T.N. Blow D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 83-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Because there is a great sequence similarity (56% amino acid identity) between E. coli and B. strearothermophilus, we felt that this would be meaningful. The mutation site (position 130) is located near the attachment site for tyrosyl adenylate (Fig. 3, a and b); amino acid 130 is close to D182, which interacts directly with the aminoacyl adenylate. The F130S replacement may influence the conformation of the attachment site through its interaction with D182, thus affecting enzymatic specificity. E. coli TyrRS and B. strearothermophilus TyrRS are homodimeric enzymes (24Tempest D.W. Meers J.L. Brown C.M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1970; 64: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 26Jakes R. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 3344-3350Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Position 130 is also relatively close to the dimer interface (Fig. 3 a). Because proper dimerization is crucial for correct amino acid binding, it is also possible that the F130S mutation might affect dimerization and subsequently affect the environment of the amino acid binding site (20Fersht A.R. Shi J.-P. Knill-Jones J. Lowe D.M. Wilkinson A.J. Blow D.M. Brick P. Carter P. Waye M.M.Y. Winter G. Nature. 1985; 314: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar, 21Lowe D.M. Winter G. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6038-6043Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase mutants with altered amino acid specificity would be of great interest. Very few studies on their generation have been reported (22Gay G.D. Duckworth H.W. Fersht A.R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 23Agou F. Quevillon S. Kerjan P. Mirande M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11309-11314Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar); they are certainly toxicin vivo due to the presence of misacylated tRNAs, which may be corrected or further altered by editing mechanisms (25Ibba M. Söll D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 617-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). A fine example of switching the amino acid specificity of human glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase to glutamate charging was based on inspired sequence/structure comparisons (23Agou F. Quevillon S. Kerjan P. Mirande M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11309-11314Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The amino acid specificity ofB. stearothermophilus TyrRS was also modified by structure-based amono acid changes in the amino acid binding site (22Gay G.D. Duckworth H.W. Fersht A.R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Here we show the generation of an E. coli TyrRS mutant that, compared with wt TyrRS, displays less discrimination against the tyrosine analogue azatyrosine. Because TyrRS is not known to have an editing mechanism (27Fersht A.R. Shindler J.S. Tsui W.C. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5520-5524Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), this would provide an explanation of the increased azatyrosine incorporation into proteins observed in E. coli strains harboring the F130S tyrS gene (Fig. 1). Ibba et al. (19Ibba M. Kast P. Hennecke H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7107-7112Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) reported that mutation of Ala294 located in the amino acid binding site of E. coli phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase resulted in acceptance ofp-chlorophenylalanine, suggesting that change of the amino acid binding pocket size influences amino acid specificity. Contrary to this, the site of the mutation of our E. coli mutant TyrRS was found to be near the amino acid binding site; residue 130 interacts with Asp182 at the binding site (Fig. 3, a andb). In addition, the models of wt TyrRS with azatyrosyl adenylate, F130S TyrRS with tyrosyl adenylate, and F130S TyrRS with azatyrosyl adenylate were constructed in the same manner as described above (see “Experimental Procedures”). With these models, we calculated the binding energy of each substrate against each TyrRS. We found that mutant TyrRS with tyrosyl adenylate is energetically comparable with mutant TyrRS with azatyrosyl adenylate, whereas normal TyrRS with tyrosyl adenylate was energetically more stable than that with azatyrosyl adenylate. 3T. Iwama, F. Hamano-Takaku, Y. Monden, and S. Nishimura, manuscript in preparation. This result is consistent with the difference in Km of each substrate against each TyrRS. This energy calculation may be useful to identify which residues should be mutated to obtain mutant TyrRS enzymes with greater specificity for azatyrosyl adenylate. An in vivo screen for isolation of a mutant aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase was reported recently by Liu and Schultz (28Liu D.R. Schultz P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4780-4785Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Because this method does not require radioactive amino acids, it may be useful for isolation of a mutant aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase that can activate a large number of unnatural amino acids. Because we focused only on one amino acid, we adopted a simple but rather laborious procedure in which incorporation of radioactive azatyrosine into protein was measuredin vivo without previous selection. Clearly, a high-throughput screening procedure is desirable for the isolation of more mutant TyrRS enzymes. In this regard, it should be mentioned that the growth of E. coli strains that harbor the pF130S plasmid is retarded by the addition of azatyrosine to the culture medium.2 The TyrRS:tRNATyr system differs from those of other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in the sense that prokaryotic tRNATyr possesses a unique structural feature distinct from that of eukaryotic tRNATyr (29Sprinzl M. Hartmann T. Weber J. Blank J. Zeidler R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: r1-r172Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Thus, TyrRS from prokaryotes and eukaryotes only recognizes cognate tRNA from the same species (5Doctor B.P. Loebel J.E. Kellogg D.A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1966; 31: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 6Hayashi H. J. Mol. Biol. 1966; 19: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 7Wakasugi K. Quinn C.L. Tao N. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This property of TyrRS may provide an excellent opportunity to produce azatyrosine-containing alloproteins. Transfection of the E. coli F130S mutant tyrSgene (endowed with an appropriate promoter) together with the E. coli tRNATyr gene into oncogene-transformed mammalian cells should clarify the mechanism of action of azatyrosine for converting the transformed phenotype to the normal phenotype. In addition, the use of an E. coli amber suppresser tRNATyr in place of the normal tRNATyr should allow the exclusive insertion of azatyrosine into specific positions in proteins by introducing the corresponding gene that contains the UAG codons in the positions where azatyrosine should be inserted. The mutated TyrRS can also be used for large-scale production of azatyrosyl-tRNATyr by in vitro protein biosynthesis (30Kigawa T. Yabuki T. Yoshida Y. Tsutsui M. Ito Y. Shibata T. Yokoyama S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar)."

Although the archaeal resolvase shares certain biochemical properties with other non-archaeal junction resolvases, no amino acid sequence similarity has been identified. To investigate the structure-function relationship of this new Holliday junction resolvase, we constructed a series of mutant<i>hjc</i> genes using site-directed mutagenesis targeted at the residues conserved among the archaeal orthologs. The products of these mutant genes were purified to homogeneity. With analysis of the activity of the mutant proteins to bind and cleave synthetic Holliday junctions, one acidic residue, Glu-9, and two basic residues, Arg-10 and Arg-25, were found to play critical roles in enzyme action. This is in addition to the three conserved residues, Asp-33, Glu-46, and Lys-48, which are also conserved in the motif found in the type II restriction endonuclease family proteins. Two aromatic residues, Phe-68 and Phe-72, are important for the formation of the homodimer probably through hydrophobic interactions. The results of these studies have provided insights into the structure-function relationships of the archaeal Holliday junction resolvase as well as the universality and diversity of the Holliday junction cleavage reaction."

Importantly, AOP-MIP-1αP is about 10-fold more active than AOP-RANTES at inhibiting HIV entry, making it the most effective chemokine-based inhibitor of HIV entry through CCR5 described to date. Surprisingly, the enhanced receptor interactions of AOP-MIP-1αP do not translate into increased chemotaxis or coupling to calcium ion fluxes, suggesting that this protein should be viewed as a partial, rather than a full, agonist for CCR1 and CCR5.

As such, they have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases. Their biological effects are mediated by a group of heptahelical G-protein-coupled receptors expressed on the surface of their target cells. Interactions between chemokines and their receptors are complex, but in many cases the amino-terminal domain of the chemokine plays an important part in regulating affinity and receptor activation (5–16) Thus, by modifying this region of the protein it is possible to generate variants that have enhanced receptor affinity and/or antagonistic activity. These variants have begun to reveal the nature of chemokine/receptor interactions and could be of use in the development of therapies targeting chemokine receptors. Indeed, such variants have been used experimentally to inhibit chemokine receptor activity in animal models of disease (17Teixeira M.M. Wells T.N. Lukacs N.W. Proudfoot A.E. Kunkel S.L. Williams T.J.

Of particular interest is the gp120 protein in the envelope of the HIV1 virus, as this protein uses chemokine receptors, along with CD4, to mediate viral entry into target cells (reviewed in Ref. 25Cairns J.S. D'Souza M.P. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In vitro, many chemokine receptors are able to act as HIV co-receptors, but in vivotwo receptors, CCR5 and CXCR4, appear to be predominantly used. This is starkly demonstrated by the protective effects of polymorphisms in CCR5, its ligands, or the CXCR4 ligand stromal-derived factor-1, on the transmission of the virus and/or the development of AIDS (26Dean M.

The ligands for these receptors (MIP-1α, MIP-1β, monocyte chemoattractant protein-2 (MCP-2) and RANTES for CCR5; stromal-derived factor-1 for CXCR4) can inhibit HIV entry in vitro (25Cairns J.S.

Targeting these receptors may help in therapeutic regulation of HIV infection (25Cairns J.S. D'Souza M.P. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and CCR5 in particular has been the focus of intensive research aimed at identifying small molecules or modified chemokines that can act as HIV entry inhibitors (10Arenzana-Seisdedos F.

Of particular relevance here, is an amino-terminal modified form of RANTES (aminooxypentane (AOP)-RANTES) that is markedly more potent than RANTES at inhibiting HIV entry through CCR5 (11Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Picard L. Offord R.E. Rosenkilde M.M. Schwartz T.W. Buser R. Wells T.N.C. Proudfoot A.E. Science. 1997; 276: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that this is due to decreased recycling of CCR5 following AOP-RANTES (compared with RANTES) binding and internalization, the consequence of which is more effective removal of CCR5 from the cell surface (38Mack M. Luckow B. Nelson P.J. Cihak J. Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Signoret N. Marsh M. Stangassinger M. Borlat F. Wells T.N. Schlondorff D. Proudfoot A.E. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1215-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that a non-allelic isoform of MIP-1α present in humans, MIP-1αP (or LD78β), is the most effective natural CCR5 agonist yet described, and moreover is the most potent natural inhibitor of CCR5-dependent HIV entry identified to date (39Nibbs R.J. Yang J. Landau N.R. Mao J.H. Graham G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17478-17483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Indeed, MIP-1αP shows equivalent anti-HIV activity to AOP-RANTES in these assays. Here, we have generated an AOP variant of MIP-1αP and examined its biological activity in comparison with MIP-1αP, RANTES, and AOP-RANTES. Our results show that AOP addition to MIP-1αP enhances its affinity for CCR1 and CCR5. Importantly, we also show that AOP-MIP-1αP is a more potent inhibitor of HIV entry through CCR5 than either MIP-1αP or AOP-RANTES. In fact, AOP-MIP-1αP is the most effective chemokine-based inhibitor of CCR5-mediated HIV entry described to date. Additionally, we present data that suggests that the enhanced affinity of AOP variants for CCR1 and CCR5 is not consistently reflected by enhanced signaling and chemotactic activity, and in fact AOP-MIP-1αP should be viewed as a partial receptor agonist. AOP variants of RANTES and MIP-1αP were synthesized by Gryphon Bioscience (San Francisco, CA). MIP-1αP and murine MIP-1α (mutant PM2) were generated as described elsewhere (40Graham G.J. Freshney M.G. Donaldson D. Pragnell I.B. Growth Factors. 1992; 7: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 41Graham G.J. MacKenzie J. Lowe S. Tsang M.L. Weatherbee J.A. Issacson A.

All chemokines were resuspended to 0.1 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), aliquoted, and stored at −20 °C until use. Cells were maintained in the following media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Seromed, Berlin, Germany), 4 mm glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, United Kingdom) and antibiotics: CHO cells (Special Liquid Medium (Life Technologies, Inc.)), HEK293 cells (Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Sigma, Poole, Dorset, UK)), CEM cells (RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.)), CEMx174 cells (RPMI 1640 plus 0.1 mHEPES), THP1 cells (RPMI 1640 plus 20 μmβ-mercaptoethanol). CHO and HEK293 receptor transfectants were grown in medium containing 1.6 and 0.8 mg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.), respectively. CCR5 expressing CEM or CEMx174 cells (CEM-CCR5 and CEMx174-CCR5) were grown in medium plus 0.5 μg/ml puromycin. Chemokines were labeled with 125I as described elsewhere (42Graham G.J. Zhou L. Weatherbee J.A. Tsang M.L. Napolitano M. Leonard W.J. Pragnell I.B. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 137-146PubMed Google Scholar) using IODO-GEN (Pierce, Rockford, IL). 300 nm stock solution of radiolabeled chemokine was stored at 4 °C. The derivation of CHO cells stably transfected with human CCR1, CCR5, and D6, and the displacement assays have been described previously (43Nibbs R.J. Wylie S.M. Yang J. Landau N.R. Graham G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32078-32083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 105 CHO cells were incubated overnight in each well of a 24-well plate, washed in PBS, then 250 μl of complete medium was added containing 20 mm HEPES, 0.5% sodium azide, radioiodinated chemokine, and PBS or a given concentration of unlabeled chemokine in PBS. Final concentrations of 20, 20, and 3 nm125I-mMIP-1α were used for CCR1, CCR5, and D6 transfectants, respectively. After 1.5–2 h at room temperature, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, lysed with 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, transferred to a counting vial and counted for 1 min in a Beckman Gamma 5500B counter (Beckman, High Wycombe, UK). For CEM-CCR5 and THP1 cells, 2 × 105 cells were transferred to a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube, washed, and incubated as above. For HEK293 transfectants, cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed, 2 × 105 cells transferred to 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes and incubated as above. For binding assays done in suspension, cells were counted directly without lysis. In all experiments, each point was done in triplicate and each experiment was done at least twice. Determination of intracellular Ca2+ was determined as detailed elsewhere (43Nibbs R.J. Wylie S.M. Yang J. Landau N.R. Graham G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32078-32083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells loaded for 45 min with Fura-2-AM (Sigma) in SR buffer (136 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 5 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm CaCl2, 0.025% bovine serum albumin) were incubated at 37 °C in a LS50 spectrophotometer (Instrument settings: 340 nm (λex); 500 nm (λem)) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Norwalk, CT) for 2 min to warm the cells, fluorescent readings then started and chemokine (diluted in PBS) added after a further 30–60 s. Fluorescent emission was recorded for a further 1–2 min and additional chemokines added where appropriate. The ability of THP1 or CEM-CCR5 cells to migrate in response to chemokines was analyzed using a Transwell assay. Cells were labeled for 30 min at 37 °C in 1 μmCalcein-AM (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) and washed twice in chemotaxis buffer (RPMI 1640, 1% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm HEPES) by centrifugation at 1000 × gfor 5 min. The cells were resuspended in buffer at 2 × 106/ml and 300 μl was added to 3-μm pore HTS Fluoroblok inserts (Becton Dickinson, Le Pont de Claix, France). The inserts were held in 24-well companion plates (Becton Dickinson) containing 700 μl of the appropriate chemokine diluted in chemotaxis buffer, and incubated for 1 h 45 min at 37 °C. The plates were read on a Fluostar fluorescent plate reader (BMG LabTechnologies, Offenburg, Germany). Chemotaxis seen in the presence of chemotaxis buffer alone was set at 1, and chemotaxis in chemokine-containing wells calculated relative to this control. Each point was done in triplicate, and experiments were performed at least twice. Viral internalization into CEMx174-CCR5 cells was examined using luciferase reporter viruses pseudotyped with envelope glycoprotein of HIV strains JR-FL, ADA, or JC2, or the amphotropic murine leukemia virus. Experiments were performed as described previously (39Nibbs R.J. Yang J. Landau N.R. Mao J.H. Graham G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17478-17483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 × 104 CEMx174-CCR5 cells were pretreated for 30 min with chemokine in medium containing 4 μg/ml Polybrene. Reporter virus was then added (2–3 ng of p24). The next day, medium was changed without adding additional chemokine and 2–4 days later luciferase activity was measured using commercially available reagent (Promega, Inc., Madison, WI). The extent of inhibition of HIV entry was determined by luciferase activity of chemokine-treated cells, with untreated control cells. 5 × 105cells were washed in ice-cold FACS buffer (PBS, 1% fetal calf serum, 0.25% sodium azide), then incubated for 30 min on ice in the presence of either phycoerythrin conjugated anti-human CCR5 (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) or an appropriate isotype control (Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After two further washing steps the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, PBS and analyzed on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). Control experiments demonstrated that chemokine bound to surface CCR5 did not interfere with binding to the anti-CCR5 antibody (not shown). To study the internalization of CCR5, CEM-CCR5 cells were incubated at 37 °C in the presence of chemokine. At various times following addition of chemokine, 5 × 105 cells were removed and processed for FACS as described above. To analyze the re-emergence of CCR5, CEM-CCR5 cells were incubated for 45 min in 100 nmchemokine. The cells were then washed four times in medium at room temperature and further incubated at 37 °C. At the desired time points, 5 × 105 cells were removed and processed for FACS as described above. As a negative control, cells were incubated for the required times in medium alone. Relative fluorescence intensity was calculated as (mean channel fluorescence [chemokine] − mean channel fluorescence [negative control])/(mean channel fluorescence [medium alone] − mean channel fluorescence [negative control]). To determine whether the addition of AOP to the NH2 terminus of MIP-1αP alters its interaction with chemokine receptors, we performed heterologous displacement studies using RANTES, MIP-1αP, and their AOP derivatives. CHO cells expressing known human receptors for MIP-1αP and RANTES (CCR1, CCR5, or D6) were incubated with a set concentration of radioiodinated murine (m) MIP-1α (125I-mMIP-1α), and a range of concentrations of unlabeled chemokine as competitor. For CCR1 and CCR5 binding, the addition of the AOP moiety to the NH2 terminus of either chemokine dramatically decreased the IC50, i.e.the concentration at which 50% of the labeled protein was displaced (Fig. 1, A and B). With CCR1 transfectants, AOP-MIP-1αP had an IC50 of 7 nm, at least 20-fold lower than MIP-1αP (Fig. 1 A). Despite AOP-RANTES having a relatively high IC50 (∼80 nm), this ligand was much more effective than RANTES in this assay which at the highest concentration tested (400 nm) only displaced 15% of the125I-mMIP-1α from CCR1. For CCR5 binding similar trends were seen, with the addition of AOP to MIP-1αP decreasing the IC50 for 125I-mMIP-1α displacement by 10-fold (20 nm for MIP-1αP versus 2 nm for AOP-MIP-1αP). Likewise, AOP-RANTES exhibited more effective displacement of the labeled chemokine from CCR5 than RANTES (Fig. 1 B). With D6, however, the AOP variants were less able to displace 125I-mMIP-1α than their unmodified counterparts, reflected by an increase in their IC50 values of 2–3-fold (Fig. 1 C). Thus, AOP addition has a similar effect on RANTES and MIP-1αP on all three receptors, enhancing displacement of125I-mMIP-1α from CCR1 and -5, but reducing it from D6. Similar effects were seen with MIP-1αP or AOP-MIP-1αP when these proteins themselves were radiolabeled and displaced from receptor by excess of the same, but unlabeled, ligand, i.e. homologous displacement assays (not shown). Our previous work (39Nibbs R.J. Yang J. Landau N.R. Mao J.H. Graham G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17478-17483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) has shown that for variants of MIP-1α, greater affinity for CCR1 or CCR5 in heterologous displacement studies is associated with more potent chemokine signaling through these receptors, as assessed by the induction of calcium ion fluxes. Thus, it was anticipated that the AOP chemokines would elicit more robust fluxes into cells than the unmodified chemokines. To examine this, HEK293 cells expressing CCR1 or CCR5 were assessed for their ability to mobilize Ca2+ in response to ligand stimulation. Initially, radioligand displacement experiments were done and importantly showed that, as with the CHO cell transfectants above, the AOP variants had enhanced affinity for CCR1 and CCR5 expressed in these cells (not shown). Curiously, however, when Ca2+ flux assays were performed, AOP-MIP-1αP signaling through CCR1 and CCR5 induced fluxes that were of similar magnitude to those seen with MIP-1αP (Fig. 2,A and B, fluxes after arrow 1). Additionally, despite its enhanced ability to displace mMIP-1α, AOP-RANTES showed weaker signaling through CCR1 than an equimolar concentration of RANTES (Fig. 2 C). However, AOP-RANTES induced a more robust Ca2+ flux through CCR5 than an equivalent concentration of RANTES (Fig. 2 D). These observations were seen across a range of ligand concentrations (not shown). Also, the ability of AOP-MIP-1αP to block a second signal induced with the unmodified protein was examined. For CCR5, a second flux induced with a 10-fold molar excess of MIP-1αP was considerably smaller if AOP-MIP-1αP had been used as the first stimulant (Fig. 2,A and B, fluxes after arrow 2). Likewise, with the CCR1 transfectants (Fig. 2 A), 5 nm AOP-MIP-1αP completely prevents a detectable second flux induced with 50 nm MIP-1αP, while 5 nmMIP-1αP does not. Thus, while the addition of AOP to MIP-1αP does not cause enhanced coupling to Ca2+ flux induction, increased receptor occupancy appears to result in a more effective block of subsequent MIP-1αP-induced signals. Signals induced by the AOP variants through CCR1 and CCR5 will regulate their chemotactic activity. To examine chemotaxis, MIP-1αP, RANTES, and their AOP variants were used in Transwell chemotaxis assays to attract CEM-CCR5 cells, or THP1 cells (that express CCR1 but not CCR5) (Fig. 3). While they gave similar profiles, MIP-1αP consistently appeared to be marginally more active than AOP-MIP-1αP at attracting CEM-CCR5 cells (Fig. 3 A). Thus, 0.1 nm MIP-1αP in the bottom of the chemotaxis plate attracted significant numbers of cells through the filter, but the same concentration of AOP-MIP-1αP was ineffective. However, equal numbers of CEM-CCR5 cells were attracted toward 0.3 nm of each chemokine. With THP1 cells, MIP-1αP and AOP-MIP-1αP produced near identical dose-response profiles (Fig. 3 B). AOP-RANTES, on the other hand, was a more potent chemotactic agent for CEM-CCR5 cells than RANTES (Fig. 3 C): considerably more cells migrated when 1 or 10 nmAOP-RANTES was added to the bottom well of the chemotaxis plate compared with the same concentration of RANTES. In contrast, AOP-RANTES was less effective at attracting THP1 cells through CCR1 (Fig. 3 D) with virtually no cells being attracted toward 10 nm AOP-RANTES, while the same concentration of RANTES was an effective stimulus. Thus, with MIP-1αP, RANTES, and their AOP derivatives, the Ca2+ flux data closely mirrors the chemotaxis data, suggesting that although AOP variants of MIP-1αP and RANTES have enhanced interactions with CCR1 and -5, this does not consistently result in an equivalent enhancement of bioactivity. D6-mediated signaling or chemotaxis was not tested. This receptor has shown no signaling or chemotactic activity when expressed in heterologous cells under assay conditions in which other chemokine receptors show robust signals. 2R. J. B. Nibbs and G. J. Graham, unpublished data. We have shown previously (39Nibbs R.J. Yang J. Landau N.R. Mao J.H. Graham G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17478-17483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) that, in vitro, MIP-1αP is a potent inhibitor of HIV entry through CCR5, and is consistently as effective as AOP-RANTES in this context. Thus, it was anticipated that AOP-MIP-1αP may show even greater potency at inhibiting viral entry due to its enhanced ability (compared with MIP-1αP) to bind to CCR5. To test this, the ability of AOP-MIP-1αP to prevent pseudotyped reporter virus entry into CEMx174-CCR5 cells was compared with MIP-1αP and AOP-RANTES. Remarkably, 0.1 nmAOP-MIP-1αP was able to almost completely inhibit entry of JR-FL and ADA pseudotyped virus (Fig. 4). AOP-RANTES and MIP-1αP were less effective than AOP-MIP-1αP, and only reduced viral entry by 60–70% at 0.1 nm. Indeed, a 10-fold higher concentration of these ligands was required before complete inhibition of entry of JR-FL pseudotyped virus was seen, while some viral entry (5–10%) was still seen with the ADA-pseudotyped virus at this concentration. Infection by viruses pseudotyped with envelope from a CXCR4-tropic virus, JC2 (which uses CXCR4 on CEMx174 cells to gain entry) or an amphotropic murine leukemia virus, was unaffected by all the chemokines tested (data not shown). These assays show AOP-MIP-1αP to be the most effective chemokine-based inhibitor of CCR5-mediated HIV entry currently known. CCR5 internalization and recycling may contribute to the HIV entry inhibitory properties of chemokines (38Mack M. Luckow B. Nelson P.J. Cihak J. Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Signoret N. Marsh M. Stangassinger M. Borlat F. Wells T.N. Schlondorff D. Proudfoot A.E. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1215-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Thus, we wished to compare the ability of MIP-1αP and RANTES, and their AOP derivatives, to internalize and recycle CCR5 in CEM-CCR5 cells using FACS analysis to detect cell surface CCR5. First, cells were incubated with 5 nm of each chemokine and CCR5 expression determined over time. As seen in Fig. 5 A, AOP-MIP-1αP more rapidly internalizes CCR5 from the surface of transfected CEM cells, than MIP-1αP, RANTES, or AOP-RANTES. With AOP-MIP-1αP, nearly 60% of detectable cell surface CCR5 had been removed within 5 min, with a further 20% internalized by 30 min. When MIP-1αP or AOP-RANTES were used, 50% of the surface CCR5 was removed after 30 min, while RANTES hardly internalized any of the CCR5 (Fig. 5 A). However, by 45 min, equivalent levels of CCR5 remained on the surface of the CEM cells treated with MIP-1αP or AOP-MIP-1αP. Thus, the AOP-coupled chemokines more rapidly cause the internalization of CCR5 into these cells than the unmodified chemokines, with AOP-MIP-1αP being more effective than AOP-RANTES. With 100 nm MIP-1αP, AOP-MIP-1αP, or AOP-RANTES, CCR5 internalization was broadly similar with more than 80% of cell surface CCR5 internalized by 15 min (Fig. 5 B). However, RANTES removed only about 50% over 45 min. Next, we wished to examine whether CCR5 was able to recycle to the cell surface after internalization by MIP-1αP or AOP-MIP-1αP. CEM-CCR5 cells were treated for 45 min with 100 nm chemokine, washed thoroughly, reincubated in medium, and the re-emergence of CCR5 assessed by FACS analysis (Fig. 5C). After 2 h, cells treated with MIP-1αP have 65% of the control levels of CCR5 back on the surface while those treated with AOP-MIP-1αP have just above 30%. Therefore, AOP-MIP-1αP brings about a more persistent down-regulation of cell surface CCR5 than an equimolar concentration of MIP-1αP. There are also reproducible differences in the rate of re-emergence between the two proteins, particularly over the first 30 min after washing away the chemokine. Very little AOP-MIP-1αP associated CCR5 returns to the surface over this time peri"

Here we show that the active E2Ad12 promoter is associated with acetylated histone H4 whereas an E2-CRE point-mutated promoter which is transcriptionally inactive due to its inability to assemble this ternary complex is not bound by acetylated histone H4. The histone deacetylase 1 as well as Roscovitine, which blocks the activation of the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity of CBP by cyclin E-Cdk2, prevents E2Ad12 promoter activation through E1A12S. p300/CBP counteracts the repressive function of histone deacetylase 1 in a HAT domain-dependent manner whereas the p300/CBP-associated factor PCAF failed to rescue E2Ad12 promoter activity. E1A12S bound p300/CBP displays strong HAT activity. Most interestingly, E1A12S-mediated activation of the E2Ad12promoter correlates well with the ability of the viral protein to associate with the HAT activity of p300/CBP in vivo.

Latter interaction is thought to induce local changes in chromatin structure that promote access of the transcriptional machinery on responsive promoters.

Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar) was a major step forward in unraveling one mechanism how co-factors could function in transcriptional regulation. As nucleosomes are potent repressors of transcription in vitro and in vivoit is assumed that acetylation of histones disrupts the nucleosomal structure thereby facilitating access of DNA-binding factors and the transcriptional apparatus (13Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar). p300/CBP has also been shown to acetylate non-histone proteins, like general as well as sequence-specific transcription factors (14Gu W.

Nature. 1998; 395: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The Ad E1A oncoprotein is a potent transcriptional regulator (19Brockmann D. Esche H. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 199: 81-112PubMed Google Scholar) which interferes with a variety of cellular processes such as modulation of gene expression, inhibition of cellular differentiation, promotion of cell-cycle progression, and transformation (20Moran E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 21Baylay S.T. Mymryk J.S. Int. J. Oncol. 1994; 5: 425-444PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have clearly demonstrated a correlation between the modulation of these processes and the functional interaction of E1A with p300/CBP (Ref. 6Giordano A. Avantaggiati M.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 218-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, and references therein). Molecular analyses identified three binding domains within p300/CBP for E1A (22Kurokawa R. Kalafus D.

Interestingly, the C/H3-binding site is located immediately adjacent to the HAT domain of p300/CBP suggesting that E1A might affect cellular processes by interfering with this enzymatic activity. However, the modulation of the p300/CBP HAT activity by E1A remains unclear. On the one hand, several reports suggest that E1A inhibits the HAT activity of p300 (24Chakravarti D. Ogryzko V. Kao H-J.

Nakatani Y. Kedes L. Cell. 1999; 96: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), whereas on the other hand no modulation (11Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar) or even a stimulation of CBP's HAT activity through the adenoviral protein was reported (26Ait-Si-Ali S. Ramirez S. Barre F.-X. Dkhisse F. Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Girault J.A. Robin P. Knibiehler M. Pritchard L.L. Ducommun B. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A. Nature. 1998; 396: 184-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to analyze the functional relationship between the Ad E1A12S protein and the HAT activity of p300/CBP in the process of the E2Ad12 promoter activation. The Ad E2 gene encodes for proteins essential for viral replication and its expression is therefore of fundamental importance for the viral life cycle (27Swaminathan S. Thimmapaya B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 199: 177-195PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently shown that the E1A12Sprotein of Ad12 activates the E2Ad12 promoter through the E2-CRE (28Fax P. Lipinski K.S. Esche H. Brockmann D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8911-8920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our results indicate that transactivation of this viral promoter requires the assembly of a ternary complex consisting of CREB-1/ATF-1, E1A12S, and CBP on the E2-CRE. However, the viral genome is rapidly chromatinized after infection (Refs. 29Dery C.V. Toth M. Brown M. Horvath J. Allaire S. Weber J.M. J. Virol. 1985; 66: 2671-2684Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar and 30Luo R.X. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar, and references therein). Therefore the question arises whether E1A12S-mediated activation of the E2Ad12 promoter requires the HAT activity of p300/CBP. Here we show that HDAC-1 and Roscovitine, which blocks CBP HAT activation (26Ait-Si-Ali S. Ramirez S. Barre F.-X. Dkhisse F. Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Girault J.A. Robin P. Knibiehler M. Pritchard L.L. Ducommun B. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A. Nature. 1998; 396: 184-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), suppress the E1A12S-mediated activation of the E2Ad12 promoter and that p300/CBP counteracts the HDAC-1-mediated repression in a HAT domain-dependent manner. In contrast, the histone acetyltransferase PCAF failed to counteract the HDAC-1-mediated repression indicating the necessity of a specific HAT activity for promoter activation. The active E2Ad12 promoter is associated with acetylated histone H4 whereas an E2Ad12 promoter rendered inactive through a mutation in the E2-CRE is not associated with acetylated H4. Most interestingly, activation of the E2Ad12 promoter through E1A12S correlates well with an association of the adenoviral protein with the HAT activity of p300/CBP. Taken together our data suggest that recruitment of the HAT activity of p300/CBP by E1A12S and acetylation of promoter bound histones are important steps in the activation process of the E2Ad12promoter. The expression vectors pRc/RSV-235R and pRc/RSV-Gal4-E1A12S encoding the E1A12S protein of Ad12 E1A or a Gal4-E1A12S fusion protein, respectively, were described elsewhere (31Brockmann D. Tries B.

Virol. 1997; 78: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Expression vectors encoding the E1A12S mutants as Myc/His-tagged fusions were constructed by cloning their respective cDNAs amplified by PCR into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of pcDNA3.1-A-Myc/His (Invitrogen). The bacterial and eukaryotic E1A expression vectors as well as the reporter constructs E2Ad12-CAT and E2Ad12pmCRE-CAT have been described (23Lipinski K.S. Fax P. Wilker B. Hennemann H. Brockmann D.

KB (human oral epidermoid carcinoma cells), HeLa (human cervix carcinoma cells), and COS7 cells (SV40-transformed African green monkey kidney cells) were maintained in Dulbecco‘s modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For transient expression assays 2.5 × 105 KB or HeLa cells were co-transfected with 1 μg of the respective E2Ad12 reporter construct and different amounts of expression vectors as indicated in the Figure legends using Polyfectine according to the manufacturer's instructions (Biontex, Martinsried, Germany). Transfections were stopped after 6 h and cells were harvested 24 h later to determine CAT activity (33Gorman C. Merlino G. Willingham M. Pastan L. Howard B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6777-6781Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). In some experiments Roscovitine was added to the medium 14 h before harvesting. GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 bacteria and purified as described (34Brockmann D. Bury C. Kröner G. Kirch H.-C. Esche H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10754-10763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). His6-E1A12S was purified from bacterial extracts according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). For GST pull-down assays 10 μg of the appropriate GST-E1A fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads was incubated with 2 mg of whole cell extract prepared from KB cells in IP + 150 buffer (50 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mmKCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm Pefabloc, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) for 1 h at 4 °C. After extensive washings bound proteins were assayed for HAT activity. Liquid HAT assays with either recombinant proteins or protein complexes obtained by immunoprecipitations were performed in 30 μl of HAT buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Tween 20, 10 mm Na-butyrate) for 45 min at 30 °C using 1 μl [14C]acetyl-CoA (40–60 mCi/mmol, ICN) and 2 μg of a biotinylated synthetic peptide corresponding to the first 24 aa of histone H4 (12Ogryzko V.V.

Thereafter, radiolabeled peptide was captured on streptavidin-agarose beads, washed twice with washing buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) and incorporated [14C]acetyl was determined by liquid scintillation counting. For detection of acetylated histones, protein complexes obtained by GST pull-down assays were resolved by 18% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by fluorography. For Western blot analyses one-third of the pulled down protein was resolved on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies specific to CBP (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or p300 (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described (23Lipinski K.S. Fax P. Wilker B. Hennemann H. Brockmann D. Esche H. Virology. 1999; 255: 94-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). 1.6 × 106 COS7 cells were transfected with expression vectors for Myc/His-tagged wild type E1A12S or E1A12S mutants as described above. Transfected cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and lysed in IP + 150 buffer. Precleared lysates were incubated with 2 μg of anti-Myc mouse monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen) or anti-CBP rabbit polyclonal antibody (A-22, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were captured by adding Protein A/G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at 4 °C, washed three times in 1 ml of IP + 150 buffer and twice in HAT assay buffer. Afterward, immune complexes were used to determine HAT activity or to analyze E1A content by Western blotting using the Ad12 E1A antiserum as described previously (28Fax P. Lipinski K.S. Esche H. Brockmann D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8911-8920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed as described (30Luo R.X.

After 40 h, formaldehyde was added (final concentration 1%) to the culture medium. After incubation for 10 min at 37 °C, cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and scraped. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5 mm Pefabloc, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) for 10 min at 4 °C. Lysates were sonicated 5 times for 10 s and cleared by centrifugation. One-third of the lysate was used to quantitate the total amount of the respective reporter construct. Two-thirds of the lysates were diluted 5-fold with lysis buffer followed by incubation with 5 μl of anti-acetylhistone H4 antibody (UBI) or normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz) as control overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected, washed, and eluted as described (36Braunstein M. Rose A.B. Holmes S.G. Allis C.D. Broach J.R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 592-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of protein-DNA complexes was reversed at 65 °C for 5 h, followed by treatment with Proteinase K. DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated. Pellets were analyzed by PCR using primers specific for the E2Ad12 promoter (5′-E2Ad125′-AGGCGTGGGAATATCTTTACT-3′; 3′-E2Ad125′-CGCAGAAGCTCTGTTCAATAA-3′). To analyze whether the activity of the E2Ad12 promoter is modulated in an acetylation/deacetylation-dependent manner we performed transient expression assays. The reporter construct E2Ad12-CAT which carries the minimal promoter inducible by E1A12S (Fig. 1A; Ref. 28Fax P. Lipinski K.S. Esche H. Brockmann D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8911-8920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), was co-transfected with expression vectors coding for E1A12S and/or HDAC-1 in KB cells. CAT activity was determined 24 h later. As shown in Fig. 1 A, HDAC-1 strongly represses the E1A12S-induced CAT gene expression indicating that histone acetylation plays an important role in the activation of the E2Ad12 promoter. To confirm this assumption we made use of the drug Roscovitine. It has been shown that Roscovitine blocks proliferation signals which mediate CBP HAT activation (26Ait-Si-Ali S. Ramirez S. Barre F.-X. Dkhisse F. Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Girault J.A. Robin P. Knibiehler M. Pritchard L.L. Ducommun B. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A. Nature. 1998; 396: 184-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). E2Ad12-CAT was transfected in KB cells and Roscovitine was added at the indicated concentrations (Fig. 1 B) 14 h before harvesting the cells. The E1A12S mediated activation of the E2Ad12promoter in the absence of Roscovitine was set as 100% in these experiments (Fig. 1 B). Roscovitine inhibits the E1A12S-mediated activation of the E2Ad12promoter in a dose-dependent manner and nearly completely blocks CAT-gene expression at a concentration of 25 μm(Fig. 1 B). To exclude that Roscovitine inhibits indirectly the activation of the E2Ad12 promoter by interfering with the expression of E1A12S we made use of the Gal4 expression system. The reporter construct G5-E1BTATA-CAT which contains five binding sites for the yeast transcription factor Gal4 was co-transfected with pRc/RSV-Gal4-E1A12S in KB cells in the presence or absence of Roscovitine. PRc/RSV-Gal4-E1A12Scodes for a fusion protein consisting of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain and the E1A12S protein. Of note, its expression is controlled by the same RSV promoter as E1A12S used in the experiments summarized in Fig. 1 A. Gal4-E1A12Sstrongly activates CAT gene expression from G5-E1BTATA-CAT (Fig. 1 C; Ref. 32Lipinski K.S. Kröner-Lux G. Esche H. Brockmann D. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Roscovitine does not repress the Gal4-E1A12S-dependent activation of the G5-E1BTATA promoter (Fig. 1 C) indicating that this drug inhibits the E2 promoter directly and not via an indirect mechanism. Furthermore, Western blot analyses demonstrated a comparable E1A12S protein concentration in transiently transfected KB cells in the presence or absence of Roscovitine (data not shown). Taken together these data suggest that the activity of the E2Ad12promoter is modulated in an acetylation/deacetylation-dependent mechanism.Figure 4p300/CBP bound to E1A12S of Ad12 displays HAT activity. Whole cell extract prepared from KB cells was incubated with GST-E1A12S, GST-Δ1–79/E1A12S, or the GST leader sequence immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. After extensive washings bound complexes were analyzed in a liquid HAT assay using [14C]acetyl-CoA and either a biotinylated synthetic peptide corresponding to the first 24 aa of histone H4 (A) or calf thymus histones (B) as substrates. A,acetylated peptide was captured on streptavidin-agarose beads and incorporated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. B, acetylated histones were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by fluorography.C, aliquots of the GST pull-down experiments were used for Western blot analyses using an anti-CBP or anti-p300 antiserum.Lane 3 shows proteins bound to the wild type E1A12S protein (GST-E1A12S), lane 2represents the GST leader sequence, lane 4 represents the E1A12S mutant lacking the N terminus and CR1 (GST-Δ1–79/E1A12S).

We therefore performed transient expression assays co-transfecting the E2Ad12-CAT reporter construct with expression vectors for HDAC-1, p300/CBP, and/or E1A12S. For this experiment the concentration of each expression vector was titrated to be able to measure the effect of E1A12S as well as p300/CBP. As already shown in Fig. 1 A, HDAC-1 represses the E1A12S-mediated activation of the E2Ad12promoter (Fig. 2, A andB). p300 as well as CBP restores E1A12S-dependent transactivation of the E2Ad12 promoter in the presence of HDAC-1 (Fig. 2,A and B). Most importantly, a CBP mutant which is completely defective in HAT activity due to a deletion of aa 1431–1569 in the HAT domain (37Ait-Si-Ali S. Polesskaya A. Filleur S. Ferreira R. Duquet A.

This finding demonstrates the necessity of the HAT activity of p300/CBP for promoter activation in the presence of HDAC-1 and excludes the possibility that the co-factor circumvents the HDAC-1-mediated repression by a HAT-domain independent mechanism. In the presence of the mutant Δ1–79/E1A12S, which lacks aa 1–79 essential for the activation of the E2Ad12 promoter (Fig. 2 A, Ref. 28Fax P. Lipinski K.S. Esche H. Brockmann D. J. Biol.

Interestingly, p300/CBP does not activate the E2Ad12 promoter in the absence of HDAC-1 indicating that the endogenous co-activator concentration is not limiting with respect to promoter activation in the absence of overexpressed HDAC-1 under the conditions used (Fig. 2 A). These data are consistent with observations of Chen and co-workers (38Chen H. Lin R.J. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M.

Finally, the HAT P/CAF, which binds to E1A12S (39Reid J.L. Bannister A.J. Zegerman P. Martı́nez-Balbás M.A. Kouzarides T.

This result suggests that the activation of the E2Ad12 promoter depends on a specific HAT activity, namely on that of p300/CBP. Taken together these results support our hypothesis that the HAT activity of p300/CBP is necessary for the activation of the E2Ad12promoter.

When sufficient electrons have accumulated on the MoFe protein, the bound substrate (N2, H+, acetylene, etc.) is reduced to product at the FeMoco cofactor center located within the α subunit of the MoFe protein. Eight electrons are typically required to reduce dinitrogen and two protons to ammonia and H2 (N2 + 8H+ + 8e = 2NH3 + H2) accompanied by the hydrolysis of 16–20 ATPs. Nitrogenase also reduces a variety of other non-physiological substrates using DT as reductant with similar ATP requirements.With the discovery and characterization (7Watt G.D. Reddy K.R.N. J. Inorg.

This behavior was proposed to arise from operation of the [Fe4S4]2+/[Fe4S4]0redox couple with transfer of two electrons to the MoFe protein accompanied by hydrolysis of only two ATPs. Utilization of about one-half as much ATP per Fe protein is the impetus for studying how [Fe4S4]0 interacts with and transfers two electrons to the MoFe protein yet requires hydrolysis of only two molecules of ATP per Fe protein cycle. To better understand this two-electron transfer process and gain insights into the role of the MoFe protein in accommodating both one- and two-electron transfer reactions and coupling them to substrate reduction, we examined several aspects of nitrogenase catalysis involving use of both the [Fe4S4]2+/[Fe4S4]1+and the [Fe4S4]2+/[Fe4S4]0redox couples.Such characteristic reactions as component protein titrations (6Thorneley R.N.F.

Here we describe several fundamental nitrogenase reactions using Ti(III) as reductant under conditions where the [Fe4S4]2+/[Fe4S4]0redox couple operates and compare the results with those obtained using DT as reductant, where only the [Fe4S4]2+/[Fe4S4]1+redox couple can operate.MATERIALS AND METHODSAll reactions involving the storage and handling of air-sensitive solids or solutions were conducted in a Vacuum Atmospheres glove box under N2 (O2 < 0.1 ppm). TiCl3 was purchased from Aldrich as a 10% TiCl3 solution in concentrated HCl. Water and HCl were removed to provide solid anhydrous TiCl3(evap) by allowing the solution to stand in a vacuum desiccator over anhydrous CaCl2 and NaOH while inside a vacuum atmospheres glove box (11Nyborg, A. C., Erickson, J. A., Johnson, J. L., Gunn, A., Truscott, S. M., and Watt, G. D. (2000) J. Inorg. Biochem.Google Scholar). Stock 83 mm Ti(III) in 0.20 m citrate and 0.30 m Tris, pH 8, solutions were prepared in the glove box, standardized optically (ε340 = 730m−1 cm−1), and used for the experiments described below (11Nyborg, A. C., Erickson, J. A., Johnson, J. L., Gunn, A., Truscott, S. M., and Watt, G. D. (2000) J. Inorg. Biochem.Google Scholar).Azotobacter vinelandii MoFe and Fe proteins with specific activities of 1800–2000 nmol of H2 min−1mg−1 component protein, determined from dithionite assays, were prepared and characterized as described previously (22Burgess B.K. Jacobs D.B. Stiefel E.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 614: 196-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Rick Baer at Exxon Research and Engineering Corporation prepared Cp component proteins with comparable activities. The L127Δ mutant was a gift from Lance Seefeldt at Utah State University and was prepared as previously reported (23Lanzilotta W.N. Fisher K. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7188-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Standard nitrogenase assays were conducted using both dithionite and Ti(III) as reductants in 5.0- or 12-ml vials under the conditions outlined below using limiting ATP and/or the ATP regeneration system under argon or 10% acetylene in argon. The nitrogenase-catalyzed reaction was quenched after 1–10 min by addition of 0.1 ml of 0.6 m trichloroacetic acid followed by analysis of the gaseous products by gas chromatography. When the regeneration system was used, ATP hydrolysis was measured as inorganic phosphate by the Fiske and Subbarow method (24Fiske C.H. Subbarow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). For reactions using limiting ATP, nucleotides were measured using an high pressure liquid chromatography method reported previously (10Erickson J.A. Nyborg A.C. Johnson J.L. Truscott S.M. Gunn A. Nordmeyer F.R. Watt G.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14279-14285Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Lag phase experiments using either Ti(III) or DT were conducted in 12-ml assay vials. The reaction was started by adding Fe protein to the reaction mixture, and 0.2 ml of the gas was removed from the head space and injected into a Hewlett-Packard 5890 series II gas chromatograph every 2 min. No more than six samples were removed from each reaction vial and corrections were made for the change in volume of the headspace gas due to the removal of consecutive 0.2-ml aliquots. Dilution experiments were carried out as described previously using 20 mm DT or 5.0–7.0 mm Ti(III) as reductant (25Johnson J. Nyborg A. Wilson P.E. Tolley A.M. Nordmeyer F.R. Watt G.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1543: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).Heterologous cross-reaction activity assays were performed using the same techniques as reported above. Assays were run using 1:1 Fe:MoFe protein ratios, a generating system, and excess reductant. Controls were run using the homologous proteins, and H2 formation was measured by gas chromatography. Additional assays to determine heterologous cross complex formation were performed containing MgATP (no generating system), however the assays were not acid-quenched. Samples from these assays were run on 7% non-stacking native polyacrylamide gels. Polyacrylamide is not readily O2-permeable as verified by addition of the redox-active dye bromphenol blue, which is colorless when reduced. Bromphenol blue is readily oxidized by O2, but no blue color was observed during electrophoresis, demonstrating that the proteins remained anaerobic. Large protein molecular weight standards were run along side the assay mixture to monitor protein progress and indicate molecular weight size of the bands.DISCUSSIONCharacteristic nitrogenase reactions were conducted to determine if differences in reactivity of the Fe protein occur depending on whether DT or Ti(III) is used as reductant during nitrogenase catalyzed H2 evolution and acetylene reduction. Under all conditions, the Fe protein could only be reduced by one electron using DT and consequently only the [Fe4S4]2+/[Fe4S4]1+redox couple operated, transferring a single electron to the MoFe protein. However, using Ti(III) as reductant under proper conditions, the Fe protein was reduced to the [Fe4S4]0 state and the [Fe4S4]2+/[Fe4S4]0redox couple operated, transferring two electrons per MoFe·Fe interaction. Comparison of the results obtained using these two reductants provides information about how the different Fe protein redox couples operate during nitrogenase catalysis and how they influence electron transfer and ATP hydrolysis during the interaction of the two component proteins.The titration of the MoFe protein with Fe protein (Fig. 1) was conducted under conditions where either the [Fe4S4]2+/[Fe4S4]1+(DT) or the [Fe4S4]2+/[Fe4S4]0(Ti(III)) redox couple functions, and similarVmax values near 580 μmol of H2min−1 were observed. At these high Fe:MoFe protein ratios, product formation occurs at the same maximal rate and is independent of which redox state of the Fe protein is functioning. This is understandable, because in either case the Fe protein saturates the MoFe protein and the rate of product formation is limited by the rate at which the MoFe protein processes electrons to product. At high Fe protein concentrations, the [Fe4S4]2+/[Fe4S4]1+redox couple transfers two electrons via two separate Fe·MoFe interactions at a rate comparable to a single two-electron transfer using the [Fe4S4]2+/[Fe4S4]0redox couple. However, it is important to recognize that, although the maximum rate of reduced product formation is constant and independent of the operating Fe protein redox couple, operation of the [Fe4S4]2+/[Fe4S4]0redox couple causes a 2-fold decrease in ATP utilization.It is of interest now to consider the behavior produced by these two different reductants shown in Fig. 1 as the Fe:MoFe protein ratio decreases. At Fe:MoFe protein ratios below complete saturation of the MoFe protein, the rate at which the MoFe protein generates product is essentially identical and independent of the redox couple that is operating. Stated differently, the transfer of two electrons via two, single-electron steps using the [Fe4S4]2+/[Fe4S4]1+redox couple occurs at the same rate as the transfer of two electrons via one two-electron step using the [Fe4S4]2+/[Fe4S4]0redox couple. However, at all ratios studied, the ATP requirement was decreased by 2-fold using the [Fe4S4]2+/[Fe4S4]0redox couple. The results of Fig. 1 suggest that the electron flux through the MoFe protein cannot be increased using the two electron [Fe4S4]2+/[Fe4S4]0redox couple, because the MoFe protein controls the rate of electron transfer, but the ATP hydrolysis can be decreased by 2-fold because in this case the Fe protein redox state controls the amount of ATP required in the reaction.The results in Fig. 5 are consistent with that just discussed by showing that the affinity of the Fe protein for the MoFe protein in either of its reduced states ([Fe4S4]1+ or [Fe4S4]0) is invariant with concentration over the range investigated. Combining the results of Figs. 1 and 5 shows that at a 1:1 Fe:MoFe protein ratio near 0.25 μm, the rate of electron transfer through the MoFe protein is constant and independent of whether a one- or a two-electron transfer reaction occurs from the Fe protein. Additionally, the dilution data show that the rate of product formation at a 1:1 Fe:MoFe protein ratio or any other protein ratio is comparable for the two redox couples over a wide range of concentrations.In contrast to the results just discussed, a much different behavior is observed when the Fe protein is titrated with the MoFe protein. The Fe protein specific activity curve using DT as reductant has a peak activity of about 2000 nmol of H2 min−1mg−1 Fe protein at a MoFe:Fe protein ratio of about 1:1 to 2:1. At MoFe:Fe protein ratios above 2:1, the activity decreases due to MoFe inhibition. MoFe inhibition is a characteristic nitrogenase reaction common to all nitrogenases thus far examined and is manifest as decreasing product formation with increasing MoFe protein concentration at constant Fe protein concentration. A proper explanation has remained elusive, although such reactivity has been used to suggest possible stoichiometric relationships for nitrogenase complex formation during catalysis and to assess the specific activity of the Fe protein (29Orme-Johnson W.H. Davis L.C. Lovenberg W. Iron-Sulfur Proteins: Structure and Metabolic Mechanisms. Academic Press, New York1977: 15-60Google Scholar, 30Mortenson L.E. Walker M.N. Walker G.A. Newton W.E. Nyman C.J. Proceedings of the 1st International Symposium on Nitrogen Fixation. Washington State University Press, Pullman, WA1976: 117-149Google Scholar). MoFe inhibition was proposed by Johnsonet al. (26Johnson J. Nyberg A. Wilson P.E. Tolley A.M. Nordmeyer F.R. Watt G.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1543: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) to be due to two Fe proteins interacting cooperatively with one active site of the MoFe protein. If this is the case, significantly different behavior would be expected using Ti(III) as is verified in Fig. 2, which shows that, using Ti(III) as the reductant, MoFe inhibition is eliminated and the peak activity is near 3100 nmol of H2 min−1 mg−1 Fe protein. In other experiments, activities as high as 4200 nmol of H2 min−1 mg−1 Fe protein were observed. The elimination of MoFe inhibition suggests that, when the [Fe4S4]2+/[Fe4S4]0redox couple is operating, two electrons instead of one are transferred from the Fe protein to the same catalytic site of the MoFe protein, and product formation occurs with each interaction. With the elimination of MoFe inhibition using the [Fe4S4]2+/[Fe4S4]0redox couple, nitrogenase catalysis follows a simple hyperbolic curve suggesting a simple Michaelis-Menten behavior for the Fe·MoFe protein interaction. It is interesting that under these conditions the Fe protein increases in activity to greater than 3100 nmol of H2 min−1 mg−1 Fe protein only when the [Fe4S4]2+/[Fe4S4]0redox couple is operating. This is because the rate-limiting step with a large excess of MoFe protein is the rate with which the Fe protein can transfer electrons to the MoFe protein. Consequently, transfer of two electrons by the [Fe4S4]2+/[Fe4S4]0redox couple, in the presence of excess MoFe protein, can generate product at almost twice the rate of the [Fe4S4]2+/[Fe4S4]1+redox couple under identical conditions.Another characteristic nitrogenase reaction studied here is the delay in product formation occurring at high MoFe:Fe protein ratios as initially reported by Hageman and Burris (17Hageman R.V. Burris R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2699-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In the original report, Hageman and Burris found that it took approximately 8 min for the product formation to reach steady state. When the linear portion of the curve was extrapolated backward in time, it fitted to approximately a 4.3-min lag phase. This experiment was interpreted as a random transfer of electrons from the Fe protein to the MoFe protein with product formation occurring only when two electrons accumulate in the same catalytic center of the MoFe protein. The difference in reactivity between a completely random one-electron electron transfer reaction using the [Fe4S4]2+/[Fe4S4]1+redox couple and a two-electron electron transfer reaction using the [Fe4S4]2+/[Fe4S4]0redox couple would be quite different. With the random [Fe4S4]2+/[Fe4S4]1+redox couple, a significant delay in product formation would be expected before a steady-state rate of product formation is observed. However, if a concerted two-electron transfer occurs at the same catalytic site on the MoFe protein, then the delay in product formation should be eliminated and product formation would be observed upon initiation of the reaction. Figs. 3 and 4 demonstrate this difference between the [Fe4S4]2+/[Fe4S4]1+and [Fe4S4]2+/[Fe4S4]0redox couples and suggest that the latter operates by transferring two electrons at a time to the MoFe protein center. The difference between our results and those of Hageman and Burris is the protein used here was significantly more active, and this is the reason our reactions were performed at 300:1 MoFe:Fe protein ratio rather than 100:1.To demonstrate that protein activity influenced the length of the lag phase for the [Fe4S4]2+/[Fe4S4]1+redox couple, we examined a partially inactive Fe protein (∼300 nmol of H2 min−1 mg−1 Fe protein). By doing this we were able to more closely replicate the results of Hageman and Burris. Fig. 4 shows the difference between DT and Ti(III) assays run with the 100:1 MoFe:Fe protein ratio and the low activity Fe protein. The DT assay yielded a lag phase of 4.1 ± 0.7 min, whereas the Ti(III) assay generated product linearly from time zero. Because little has been reported regarding what happens to an Fe protein when it is inactivated, it is difficult to speculate as to why the Ti(III) reaction were 4-fold more active than the DT reaction.Heterologous crosses have been well studied and in general Fe·MoFe crosses from all diazotrophs are active except for crosses with Cp. We reported previously (10Erickson J.A. Nyborg A.C. Johnson J.L. Truscott S.M. Gunn A. Nordmeyer F.R. Watt G.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14279-14285Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) that Cp2 could form the [Fe4S4]0 and that a 5:1 Cp2·Cp1 mixture under Ti(III) decreases the ATP/2e by 2-fold (10Erickson J.A. Nyborg A.C. Johnson J.L. Truscott S.M. Gunn A. Nordmeyer F.R. Watt G.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14279-14285Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Here we report that whether DT or Ti(III) is used as the reductant, the Cp·Av crosses are inactive. The Av1·Cp2 cross yielded a stable complex in the presence of DT but generated no measurable product, because it could not transfer more than one electron per MoFe protein interaction. The Cp1·Av2 heterologous cross did not form a stable complex nor was it active using DT. The Ti(III) assays performed under similar conditions were inactive even though Ti(III) was used as reductant (one turnover may have occurred, but this amount of product was below our detection limit). To determine if the Av1·Cp2 complex forms in the presence of Ti(III), we ran native gels and found that a component protein complex formed and appeared to be the same as that formed with DT. Additionally, when L127Δ Fe protein was assayed with native Av1 and analyzed by native gel electrophoresis, a stable complex formed in both cases independent of the reductant used. It appears that the [Fe4S4]0 is similar to [Fe4S4]1+ in its ability to interact with the MoFe protein and form a complex. The [Fe4S4]0 does not cause a more favorable interaction in the case of a heterologous cross.The questions that accompanied the discovery of the all-ferrous Fe protein were: 1) Is it physiologically relevant; and 2) Does it behave differently from the DT reduced Fe protein. The results presented here specifically address the second question and show that distinct differences and similarities are observed between the [Fe4S4]2+/[Fe4S4]0and the [Fe4S4]2+/[Fe4S4]1+redox couples. We suggest that their differences arose from a two-electron transfer reaction as opposed to the traditionally observed single-electron transfer. With regard to physiological relevance, previous data (7Watt G.D. Reddy K.R.N. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1994; 53: 281-294Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 10Erickson J.A. Nyborg A.C. Johnson J.L.

M., and Watt, G. D. (2000) J. Inorg. Biochem.Google Scholar), along with the data presented here, suggest that the [Fe4S4]2+/[Fe4S4]0redox couple is operative at physiologically attainable redox potentials and can in fact transfer two electrons with each Fe·MoFe interaction. The ATP/2e ratio is a sensitive measure of this reactivity and indicates an increased efficiency of the nitrogenase-catalyzed reduction of substrates when this redox couple is functioning. Both the [Fe4S4]2+/[Fe4S4]0and [Fe4S4]2+/[Fe4S4]1+redox couples can be functional during in vitro nitrogenase catalysis. Are these in vitro results relevant to in vivo nitrogenase catalysis? ATP/2e values of 2.5 for Cp (30Mortenson L.E. Walker M.N. Walker G.A. Newton W.E. Nyman C.J. Proceedings of the 1st International Symposium on Nitrogen Fixation.

Moreover, treatment of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and its derivative strain stroke-prone SHR with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II AT1 receptor blockers inhibits VSMC polyploidization (4Owens G.K.

This pathway delays the exit from mitosis if the chromosomal segregation cannot be properly completed by preventing the inactivation of the M-phase promoting complex (Cdc2, cyclin B, and associated proteins) (23Murray A.W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 24Rudner A.D. Murray A.W. Curr. Opin.

Recent data indicate that, in mammalian cells, M-phase growth arrest is accomplished in part by down-regulation of Cks1 (26Hixon M.L. Flores A.I. Wagner M.W. Gualberto A. Mol. Cell.

Cells in which the mitotic checkpoint fails to down-regulate Cks1 expression cannot maintain cyclin B protein expression and M-phase growth arrest, and are predisposed to undergo cell cycle re-entry and polyploidization (26Hixon M.L. Flores A.I. Wagner M.W. Gualberto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6224-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).The incidence of polyploidy in vascular smooth muscle of hypertensive individuals prompted us to investigate the activity of the mitotic spindle cell cycle checkpoint in VSMC. The status of this pathway was studied in cultures of VSMC isolated from multiple vascular beds of normal and hypertensive rats. We provide functional and biochemical evidence of a specific mitotic spindle cell cycle checkpoint defect in cultures of VSMC isolated from capacitance arteries of SHR. These cells express high levels of Cks1 protein and fail to down-regulate Cks1 in response to mitotic inhibitors. VSMC isolated from resistance arteries of SHR had low Cks1 expression and normal mitotic checkpoint status. Treatment of SHR with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril reduced Cks1 and ploidy levels in aortic smooth muscle. Furthermore, activation of the renin-angiotensin system in the normotensive rat strain WKY by renal artery clipping, or angiotensin II infusion, induced Cks1 protein levels and VSMC polyploidization at aortic smooth muscle. In addition, treatment of primary cultures of WKY VSMC with angiotensin II induced Cks1 up-regulation and failure to control cyclin B expression in response to a mitotic spindle inhibitor. Finally, ectopic expression of Cks1 in VSMC isolated from normotensive rats reproduced the altered mitotic spindle cell cycle checkpoint phenotype observed in VSMC of hypertensive rats. In summary, these data demonstrate that Cks1 regulates VSMC ploidy and suggest that Cks1 up-regulation may contribute to the phenomena of VSMC polyploidization during hypertension.

Additionally, activation of the renin-angiotensin system by occlusion of a renal artery, or Goldblatt's operation, increases aortic VSMC ploidy in these animals (17Owens G.K. Schwartz S.M. Circ. Res. 1983; 53: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Moreover, treatment of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and its derivative strain stroke-prone SHR with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II AT1 receptor blockers inhibits VSMC polyploidization (4Owens G.K. Schwartz S.M. Circ. Res. 1982; 51: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 18Rosen E.M. Goldberg I.D. Shapiro H.M. Levenson S.E. Halpin P.A. J. Hypertens.

However, despite extensive investigation, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying VSMC polyploidization has eluded characterization. Mammalian cells are protected from cell cycle re-entry at mitosis by the activity of the mitotic spindle cell cycle checkpoint (20Cahill D.P. Lengauer C., Yu, J. Riggins G.J. Willson J.K.

This pathway delays the exit from mitosis if the chromosomal segregation cannot be properly completed by preventing the inactivation of the M-phase promoting complex (Cdc2, cyclin B, and associated proteins) (23Murray A.W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 24Rudner A.D. Murray A.W. Curr. Opin.

Recent data indicate that, in mammalian cells, M-phase growth arrest is accomplished in part by down-regulation of Cks1 (26Hixon M.L. Flores A.I. Wagner M.W. Gualberto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6224-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), a Cdc2 adapter protein that promotes cyclin B metabolism (27Basi G. Draetta G. Mol. Cell.

Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1503-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Cells in which the mitotic checkpoint fails to down-regulate Cks1 expression cannot maintain cyclin B protein expression and M-phase growth arrest, and are predisposed to undergo cell cycle re-entry and polyploidization (26Hixon M.L. Flores A.I. Wagner M.W. Gualberto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6224-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The incidence of polyploidy in vascular smooth muscle of hypertensive individuals prompted us to investigate the activity of the mitotic spindle cell cycle checkpoint in VSMC. The status of this pathway was studied in cultures of VSMC isolated from multiple vascular beds of normal and hypertensive rats. We provide functional and biochemical evidence of a specific mitotic spindle cell cycle checkpoint defect in cultures of VSMC isolated from capacitance arteries of SHR. These cells express high levels of Cks1 protein and fail to down-regulate Cks1 in response to mitotic inhibitors. VSMC isolated from resistance arteries of SHR had low Cks1 expression and normal mitotic checkpoint status. Treatment of SHR with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril reduced Cks1 and ploidy levels in aortic smooth muscle. Furthermore, activation of the renin-angiotensin system in the normotensive rat strain WKY by renal artery clipping, or angiotensin II infusion, induced Cks1 protein levels and VSMC polyploidization at aortic smooth muscle. In addition, treatment of primary cultures of WKY VSMC with angiotensin II induced Cks1 up-regulation and failure to control cyclin B expression in response to a mitotic spindle inhibitor. Finally, ectopic expression of Cks1 in VSMC isolated from normotensive rats reproduced the altered mitotic spindle cell cycle checkpoint phenotype observed in VSMC of hypertensive rats. In summary, these data demonstrate that Cks1 regulates VSMC ploidy and suggest that Cks1 up-regulation may contribute to the phenomena of VSMC polyploidization during hypertension. We thank Paul E.

Ji J. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In nearly every cell line analyzed, dGTP represents just 5–10% of the sum of the four dNTP pools (dATP + dCTP + dGTP + dTTP). A possible explanation for this asymmetry came from the discovery that the mutT gene product in Escherichia coli is a nucleoside triphosphatase, with particular activity against an oxidized guanine nucleotide, 8-oxo-dGTP (2Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar), and that mammalian cells contain a similar enzyme (3Sakumi K. Furuichi M. Tsukuki T. Kakuma T. Kawabata S. Maki H. Sekiguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23524-23530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An 8-oxo-dGMP residue in DNA stimulates mutagenesis via a transversion pathway because of its ready tendency to base pair with dAMP (4Shibutani S. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Nature. 1991; 349: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar). Therefore, the mutT gene product and its homolog are thought to minimize replication errors by eliminating from the cell an oxidized nucleotide, 8-oxo-dGTP, whose incorporation into DNA would otherwise be a strongly mutagenic event. We hypothesized that turnover of dGTP, via its oxidation and subsequent degradation, might contribute to its underrepresentation in the DNA precursor pool, and we asked whether culturing cells at low oxygen tension, where guanine nucleotide oxidation might be minimized, would cause dGTP to accumulate. However, as detailed below, we found that culturing V79 hamster lung cells in an artificial atmosphere containing 2% oxygen instead of at its natural abundance of 20%, did allow dGTP to accumulate, but so also did dATP and dTTP. Surprisingly, the dCTP pool was diminished under these conditions. Probst and co-workers (5Probst H. Schiffer H. Gekeler V. Kienzle-Pfeilsticker H. Stropp U. Stötzer K.-E. Frenzel-Stötzer I. Cancer Res. 1988; 43: 2053-2060Google Scholar, 6Brischwein K. Engelcke M. Riedinger H.-J. Probst H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 286-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) have made similar observations in studies on Ehrlich ascites tumor cells, and they proposed that dCTP depletion is the basis for specific inhibition of DNA replication in hypoxic cells. They further hypothesized that the basis for dCTP depletion at low O2 is a special sensitivity of the reduction of CDP by ribonucleotide reductase (RNR).1 The type I RNR, which is found in all mammalian systems examined to date, requires O2 for formation of a catalytically essential diferric iron center and tyrosine radical (7Ochiai E.-I. Mann G.J. Gräslund A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15758-15761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Bollinger Jr., J.M. Edmondson D.E. Huynh B.H. Filley J. Norton J.R. Stubbe J.

Riedinger H.-J. Probst H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 286-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) proposed that hypoxic conditions somehow affect ribonucleotide reductase activities so that the dCTP pool is specifically lowered, either by a direct or indirect mechanism, and that the dCTP pool size, as proposed earlier (10Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar), exerts a specific regulatory effect upon the DNA replication machinery. Because of the role of oxygen in ribonucleotide reductase action, the premise that oxygen limitation acts on DNA replication through ribonucleotide reductase is plausible. However, a direct effect of hypoxia upon rNDP reductase specificity is difficult to reconcile with the concept that the four RNR-catalyzed reactions almost certainly proceed by identical mechanisms. On the other hand, because we have developed a ribonucleotide reductase assay protocol that monitors the four activities of RNR simultaneously in a single reaction mixture (11Hendricks S.P. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2861-2865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 12Hendricks S.P. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29512-29518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we were in a position to test the hypothesis that oxygen limitation affects rNDP reductase specificity. This paper describes the results of that test. V79 hamster lung cell cultures were maintained as described previously (13Arecco A.L. Mun B. Mathews C.K. Mutat. Res. 1988; 200: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For growth under hypoxic conditions, cells were cultured in 80-cm2 straight neck flasks with sealable airtight caps. After seeding the cells, and each time the flasks were opened, the flasks were flushed for 30 s each with a gas mixture containing 2% O2, 5% CO2, and 93% N2 and then capped tightly. For dNTP pool analysis under hypoxia, cells were synchronized by a double aphidicolin block (14Matherly L.H. Schuetz J.D. Westin E. Goldman I.D. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) to bring most of them into S phase at the time the measurements were done. Cells were seeded at low density, and 8 h later, aphidicolin was added to a concentration of 3 μm. Twelve h later the aphidicolin-containing medium was removed, and the cells were washed and transferred to aphidicolin-free medium. After an additional 9 h, aphidicolin was re-added, also to 3 μm, and incubation was continued for another 14 hours. At this time more than 90% of the cells were at the G1-S border, as shown by flow cytometry. Again, the cells were washed and transferred to aphidicolin-free medium. After 100 min, flow cytometry showed that 65% of the cells were in S phase, with most of the remainder moving into S. At 120 min, more than 90% of the cells were in S. One hundred min was taken as time zero for collection (over a 60-min interval), extraction, and analysis of dNTP pools by the DNA polymerase-based enzymatic method, as described previously (15North T.W. Bestwick R.K. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6640-6645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For this study we used recombinant mouse ribonucleotide reductase. Cloned cDNAs for the R1 and R2 proteins were kindly provided by Dr. Lars Thelander, Umeå University, Sweden. Induction and purification of the recombinant proteins was carried out as described elsewhere. 2K. Chimploy and C. K. Mathews, submitted for publication. Generally the four-substrate assay was carried out as described previously by our laboratory (11Hendricks S.P. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2861-2865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 12Hendricks S.P. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29512-29518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For assays carried out in an anaerobic chamber, the reaction mixture (100 μl), assembled within the chamber, contained 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.2, 5 mmMgCl2, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μmFe(NH4)2(SO4)2, 1 μm mouse R1 protein, 4 μm R2 protein, and, unless otherwise indicated, nucleotide substrates and effectors at their estimated physiological concentrations (16Traut T.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar): 850 μmADP, 70 μm CDP, 160 μm GDP, 160 μm UDP, 2.5 mm ATP, 60 μm dATP, 15 μm dGTP, and 50 μm dTTP. Unless otherwise indicated, reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min, followed by termination of the reactions and HPLC analysis of the nucleotide contents, as described previously (11Hendricks S.P. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2861-2865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 12Hendricks S.P. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29512-29518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For experiments involving pretreatment under anaerobic conditions, enzyme subunits were mixed, bubbled gently with argon gas, and incubated in an anaerobic chamber on ice for 20, 40, or 60 min, followed by addition of the remaining reaction components and incubation, also in the anaerobic chamber, at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by addition of 5 μl of 50% perchloric acid. Reaction mixtures were passed through a boronate column to remove ribonucleotides, as described previously (11Hendricks S.P. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2861-2865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 12Hendricks S.P. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29512-29518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), followed by ion-exchange high pressure liquid chromatography separation and quantitation of the deoxyribonucleoside diphosphate products. The pH value used for the assay reactions, 8.2, was based upon our earlier determination of the pH optima for RNRs of vaccinia virus and cultured BSC40 monkey kidney cells (17Slabaugh M.B. Mathews C.K. J. Virol. 1984; 52: 501-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When we ran the four-substrate assay with the mouse enzyme at pH 7.6, under our quasi-physiological conditions, we found the activity to be decreased by about 25% compared with the activity determined at pH 8.2 and the overall product profile to be substantially the same (data not shown). The original aim of this investigation was to understand why mammalian cells, which use elaborate control mechanisms to regulate DNA precursor biosynthesis, maintain steady-state dNTP pools that are highly asymmetric (1Mathews C.K. Ji J. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In particular, dGTP pools usually represent just 5–10% of the sum of the four dNTPs. The discovery (2Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar, 3Sakumi K. Furuichi M. Tsukuki T. Kakuma T. Kawabata S. Maki H. Sekiguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23524-23530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that bacterial and mammalian cells both contain an active nucleoside triphosphatase (the MutT protein inE. coli), with specificity toward an oxidized guanine nucleotide, 8-oxo-dGTP, presented a possible explanation. If oxidation of dGTP to 8-oxo-dGTP is significant, then oxidation and subsequent breakdown of the dGTP pool could increase its turnover to the extent that it would diminish the steady-state pool of this nucleotide relative to the dATP, dCTP, and dTTP pools. We reasoned that dGTP oxidation and consequent turnover of the dGTP pool might be minimized if cells were grown in a low oxygen atmosphere. Accordingly, we selected V79 hamster lung cells as an appropriate cell culture system and ascertained that they grew well in an artificial atmosphere containing oxygen at 2%, rather than its 20% representation in the natural atmosphere. Because cells not in the S phase of the cell cycle contain substantial dNTP pools, whose turnover is very slow (18Leeds J.M. Mathews C.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 1987; 7: 532-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), it was essential that our dNTP pool measurements be carried out in cultures enriched in S phase cells. Accordingly, we treated cells with aphidicolin, which causes them to accumulate at the G1-S interface. After release from the aphidicolin block, we followed dNTP pools in cells grown both in air and at 2% oxygen. As shown in Fig. 1, the results did not conform to the hypothesis. To be sure, the dGTP pool expanded severalfold in the hypoxic culture, relative to the control, but so also did the dATP and dTTP pools. By contrast, the dCTP pool was diminished by 2-fold or more under these conditions.Figure 3Effects of hypoxic conditions upon the four activities of mouse ribonucleotide reductase. R2 was subjected to hydroxyurea treatment and regeneration as described in the legend to Fig. 2, except that regeneration was carried out in nitrogen-oxygen mixtures containing O2 at the indicated percentages. In addition, all assays were carried out with rNDP substrates and all allosteric effectors present at their estimated in vivoconcentrations.

Cell cultures were grown in air or in an artificial atmosphere containing O2 at 2%. Subconfluent cultures were treated twice in succession with 3 μm aphidicolin, a treatment that prevents their progression from G1 into S phase, as described in “Experimental Procedures.” One hundred min after release from the second aphidicolin block (time zero on the figure), the culture was sampled over a 60-min interval for extraction and assay of dNTP pools. Each data point represents the ratio of the respective dNTP pool size in the hypoxic conditions compared with that in the aerobic culture.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In considering this result, we must account for the likelihood that dNTP pool alterations were caused by the aphidicolin treatment itself, which does cause dNTP pools in V79 cells to expand. 3M. L. Tassotto and S. A. Martomo, unpublished results in this laboratory. However, our measurements were made some 2 h after release from the aphidicolin block, an interval that should minimize effects of the inhibitor on pools. In addition, we saw essentially the same results when we examined asynchronous hypoxic cell cultures, which had not been exposed to aphidicolin. 4M. L. Tassotto, unpublished results. We are not the first to have observed a specific decline in the dCTP pool in hypoxic mammalian cells. Probst et al. (5Probst H. Schiffer H. Gekeler V. Kienzle-Pfeilsticker H. Stropp U. Stötzer K.-E. Frenzel-Stötzer I. Cancer Res. 1988; 43: 2053-2060Google Scholar) observed a rapid inhibition of DNA replication during transient hypoxia in Ehrlich ascites cells, and Brischwein et al. (6Brischwein K. Engelcke M. Riedinger H.-J. Probst H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 286-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) observed a specific decline in the dCTP pool under these conditions and also a decline in the ribonucleotide reductase free radical content of the cells. Similar results have been noted for cultured human cell lines (19Probst G. Riedinger H.-G. Martin P. Engelcke M. Probst H. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1371-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). O2 is required for formation of the oxygen-bridged iron center that participates in forming the catalytically essential tyrosine free radical for ribonucleotide reductase (7Ochiai E.-I. Mann G.J. Gräslund A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15758-15761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Bollinger Jr., J.M. Edmondson D.E. Huynh B.H. Filley J. Norton J.R. Stubbe J. Science. 1991; 253: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 9Sjöberg B.-M. Struct. Bonding. 1997; 88: 139-173Crossref Google Scholar). For this reason, Brischwein et al. (6Brischwein K. Engelcke M. Riedinger H.-J. Probst H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 286-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) proposed that hypoxic conditions affect ribonucleotide reductase so as to cause a specific decline in the dCTP pool, either directly, by modifying the specificity of the enzyme for different rNDP substrates, or indirectly, by an unknown mechanism. The most direct way for hypoxia to affect dNTP pools differently would be through variable sensitivity of its four activities to oxygen limitation. This is not a particularly compelling hypothesis, because the iron center and its associated tyrosine radical are essential for all four reactions; so the most straightforward expectation is that all four activities would be affected equally. However, this model could explain experimental observations, and, moreover, it can be tested in a straightforward manner by the use of our four-substrate assay, in which we monitor the four activities of the enzyme when assayed in atmospheres of varying oxygen content. For these experiments we used recombinant mouse ribonucleotide reductase, prepared from cloned cDNAs, as described by Thelander and co-workers (20Mann G.J. Gräslund A. Ochiai E.-I. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 21Davis R. Thelander M. Mann G.J. Behravan G. Soucy F. Beaulieu P. Lavallée P. Gräslund A. Ochiai E.-I. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23171-23176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our original intention was to carry out the four-substrate assay at a range of subatmospheric oxygen partial pressures and observe the loss of each individual activity as a function of reducedpO2, asking whether CDP reduction was the most sensitive of the four activities. Because rather little is known about the stability of the oxygen-bridged iron center in the mouse enzyme at low pO2, we first determined the effect of incubation in an anaerobic atmosphere upon the four rNDP reductase activities. Enzyme solutions were bubbled with argon gas and then placed on ice in an anaerobic chamber. At intervals, samples were removed anaerobically, mixed with other reaction components, and subjected to the four-substrate assay, also anaerobically, with nucleoside diphosphates present at 0.15 mm each and 2.5 mm ATP and 10 μm dTTP as the only allosteric effectors. However, preincubation for as long as 60 min failed to inhibit any of the activities by more than 50% (Fig. 2). In fact, one activity (ADP reduction) was increased after 20 and 40 min of anaerobic incubation. Thus, a different strategy was necessary for measuring enzyme activity loss as a function of reduced pO2. An alternative approach was to destroy the radical with hydroxyurea, then remove the hydroxyurea, regenerate the radical at reducedpO2, and then assay its four activities at the same pO2. First it was essential to show that no activity was regained when regeneration was carried out anaerobically and that full, or nearly full, activity was regained during regeneration in air. For this experiment, R2 protein was incubated at 37 °C in an anaerobic chamber with 1 m hydroxyurea (earlier experiments with lower hydroxyurea concentrations had failed to give complete inactivation under our conditions). After 10 min the hydroxyurea was removed by the use of a Centri-Sep spin column, also in the anaerobic chamber. Hydroxyurea-free R2 protein (4 μm) was then added to an assay mixture containing 1 μm R1, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm ferrous ammonium sulfate, and nucleotide substrates and effectors at their “physiological” concentrations. Regeneration and enzyme activity were allowed to proceed simultaneously during a 5-min incubation period at 37 °C. During this time the reaction mixture was slowly bubbled either with air or with an anaerobic gas mixture (5% H2, 5% CO2, 90% N2). As shown in TableI, activity was largely regained during regeneration in air, whereas no detectable activity was regained during anaerobic incubation. Thus, the stage was set for examining sensitivity of the four rNDP reductase reactions to loweredpO2, by observing regeneration of activity in nitrogen-oxygen mixtures containing subatmospheric proportions of O2.Table IAerobic regeneration of ribonucleotide activities after hydroxyurea treatmentTreatmentDeoxyribonucleoside diphosphate formationdCDPdUDPdADPdGDPnmol/min/mg of R1 ± S.D.None18.8 ± 2.78.7 ± 0.98.6 ± 0.25.7 ± 0.2Regeneration in air, no HU treatment15.7 ± 3.97.7 ± 0.57.3 ± 1.65.2 ± 1.1HU treatment, aerobic regeneration12.9 ± 1.07.0 ± 0.26.8 ± 1.14.9 ± 0.6HU treatment, anaerobic regeneration<0.1<0.1<0.1<0.1HU not removed before aerobic regeneration<0.1<0.1<0.1<0.1Mouse R2 protein was incubated anaerobically with 1 mhydroxyurea.

Averaged results of two experiments, depicted in Fig. 3, showed that one of the four activities of RNR was indeed more sensitive than the others to oxygen limitation but that activity was not CDP reduction, as would be expected from the model being tested, but instead was GDP reduction. At each of the three O2 abundances tested, 3.0, 1.5, and 0.5%, the GDP reductase activity was the lowest observed, relative to the aerobic control. At 1.5% O2, GDP reduction was inhibited 75% relative to the control, whereas the corresponding values for ADP, CDP, and UDP were 46, 35, and 31%, respectively. One possible explanation for the apparent selective sensitivity of GDP reduction to O2 limitation is that regeneration of GDP reduction for some reason is slower than for the other four substrates and that our 5-min regeneration/reaction time does not suffice for full reactivation of GDP reductase activity. This seems quite unlikely, because, as shown in Table I, GDP reductase was fully regenerated during a 5-min treatment in air. Actually, regeneration is probably considerably faster; studies on E. coli R2 protein under comparable conditions show complete regeneration of the radical in just a few seconds (7Ochiai E.-I. Mann G.J. Gräslund A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15758-15761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Sjöberg B.-M. Struct. Bonding. 1997; 88: 139-173Crossref Google Scholar), and mouse R2 behaves similarly (22Schmidt P.P. Rova U. Katterle B. Thelander L. Gräslund A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21463-21472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Therefore, we believe that regeneration is rapid in comparison to the total incubation time. Nevertheless, we performed an experiment in which regeneration was carried out at 1.5% O2, with sampling and analysis of the reaction mixtures at 5, 10, and 15 min. As shown in Fig. 4, there was no evidence for GDP reduction catching up with the other three reactions during longer incubations. The product profile after 15 min of incubation (29% dADP, 36% dCDP, 12% dGDP, 23% dUDP) was similar to that seen after 5 min (18% dADP, 49% dCDP, 8% dGDP, 25% dUDP). Therefore, we believe that regeneration of GDP reductase activity is rapid, but incomplete, during treatment at reduced pO2. It was of interest to learn whether different forms of the enzyme, which result from binding of different allosteric effectors in their two sites, respond similarly to oxygen depletion and also whether the low oxygen atmosphere affects enzyme specificity. Accordingly, we carried out an experiment similar to that shown in Fig. 4. However, in the experiment of Fig. 4, the regeneration/reaction mixture contained rNDP substrates and nucleoside triphosphate effectors at their physiological concentrations. In the experiment of Fig. 5, the substrates were also present at physiological concentrations. However, in Fig. 5 A, only ATP and dTTP were present as effectors. GDP reduction was activated and considerably higher than the other three activities. In Fig. 5 B, ATP and dGTP were present as allosteric effectors. ADP reduction was most active, CDP reduction was less active, and reduction of GDP and UDP was so low as to be nearly undetectable. These results are quite similar to those seen in analysis of the mouse enzyme under normal conditions of the four-substrate assay.2 Thus, allosteric control of rNDP reductase regenerated at 1.5% O2 is quite similar to that of the enzyme in air, suggesting that variations in allosteric configurations of the enzyme are not a factor in explaining the differential response of the four RNR activities to oxygen limitation. The principal aim of this investigation was to determine whether the effect of hypoxic conditions upon dNTP pools in mammalian cells results from a direct effect of oxygen limitation upon ribonucleotide reductase, which, in the simplest model, would reduce its relative activity toward CDP and lead to a specific decrease in the dCTP pool. Our results with the four-substrate assay of mouse ribonucleotide reductase contradict this model; we saw no evidence that oxygen limitation affects CDP reduction disproportionately. On the other hand, we were surprised to see a specific diminution of GDP reductase activity at subatmospheric pO2. At present we do not know the mechanism of this effect, but we have ruled out a couple of obvious explanations for the phenomenon. However, the disproportionate inhibition of GDP reductase by oxygen limitation may help to explain natural dNTP pool asymmetries. The dGTP underrepresentation in cultured mammalian cells, which we and others have observed repeatedly (1Mathews C.K. Ji J. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), is not an artifact of cell culture. Moleet al. (23Mole L.M. Hunter D.L. Gao P. Lau C. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 259: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) observed the same asymmetry in extracts of whole rat embryos. In that study the percentages of the total dNTP pool represented by dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP were 17, 17, 7, and 42, respectively. Most cells in a multicellular animal sense oxygen at much lower partial pressures than that seen in air, in fact, at values close to those analyzed in our experiments. If the activity of ribonucleotide reductase toward GDP is inhibited by this natural oxygen limitationin vivo, that inhibition could affect steady-state dGTP pools, leading to the apparent underrepresentation of dGTP in most mammalian cells. Finally, it is worth commenting upon the evident stability of the oxygen-bridged iron center under anaerobic incubation conditions. Sixty min of incubation in an anaerobic chamber, followed by enzyme assay, also under anaerobiosis, led to only partial inhibition of each of the four rNDP reductase activities, with that inhibition being less than 50%. The role of oxygen in forming the diferric iron center and the catalytically essential tyrosine radical is well established (7Ochiai E.-I. Mann G.J. Gräslund A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15758-15761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Bollinger Jr., J.M. Edmondson D.E. Huynh B.H. Filley J. Norton J.R. Stubbe J.

Bonding. 1997; 88: 139-173Crossref Google Scholar), and the overall process can be summarized as follows.R2(FeII) 2Y+O2+2H++Fe2+→R2(FeIII­O­FeIII)Y·+H2O+Fe3+Reaction1 The catalytic role of the tyrosine radical involves an electron transport chain that moves an unshared electron some 30 Å, from R2 to the active site in R1 (9Sjöberg B.-M. Struct. Bonding. 1997; 88: 139-173Crossref Google Scholar). It seems likely that this electron transport process need not be repeated in every catalytic cycle, and that, once formed, the tyrosine radical need not be regenerated repeatedly by the above process. Because the retention of activity implies that the iron center is retained during anaerobic preincubation, our data suggest that oxygen is not lost from R2 under these conditions and that turnover of the iron center is relatively slow once catalysis begins; otherwise, the lack of oxygen would make it impossible for the iron center and radical to reform, and catalysis would cease. Therefore, our data provide indirect support for the concept that the iron center, once formed under aerobic conditions, is stable during repeated catalytic cycles. As long ago as 1983, Thelander et al. (24Thelander L. Gräslund A. Thelander M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 110: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) reached a similar conclusion, based upon their studies of the kinetics of anaerobic CDP reduction by mouse RNR previously activated in air. Their data suggested that the enzyme completed about 30 catalytic cycles before losing activity. This value is consistent with our own observations, although our anaerobic incubations were not run long enough to exhaust the activity of the enzyme.

This process involves several distinct steps such as recognition of the origins, unwinding of double-strand (ds)1 DNA, and priming (for reviews, see Refs. 1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman, San Fransisco1992Google Scholar and 2Dutta A. Bell S.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 293-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Genomes consisting of a linear dsDNA molecule with a terminal protein (TP) covalently linked to their 5′-ends have been found in bacteriophages (e.g. φ29, φ15, Nf, B103, GA-1, Cp-1, and PRD1), animal viruses (e.g.adenoviruses), plasmids (e.g. S1 and Kalilo), and bacteria (e.g. Streptomyces). In most of these cases, initiation of replication has been shown to occur via a so-called protein-priming mechanism, which has been studied extensively for theBacillus subtilis phage φ29 (for reviews, see Refs. 3Salas M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 39-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar and4Salas M. Miller J.T. Leis J. DePamphilis M.L. DePamphilis M.L. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 131-176Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows a schematic representation of in vitro φ29 DNA replication. Initiation of φ29 DNA replication starts with recognition of the origin of replication, i.e. the TP-containing DNA ends, by a TP/DNA polymerase heterodimer. The TP linked to the 5′ DNA ends is called parental TP, and the TP present in the complex with DNA polymerase is called primer TP. The viral ds DNA-binding protein p6 forms a nucleoprotein complex that would help to open the DNA ends (5Serrano M. Salas M. Hermoso J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 202-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), facilitating the formation of the covalent linkage between dAMP and the OH group of Ser232 residue of the primer TP, catalyzed by φ29 DNA polymerase (6Blanco L. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5325-5329Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 7Hermoso J.M. Méndez E. Soriano F. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 7715-7728Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The formation of this first TP-dAMP covalent complex is directed by the second nucleotide at the 3′-end of the template; then, the TP-dAMP complex slides back one nucleotide to recover the information of the terminal nucleotide (8Méndez J. Blanco L. Esteban J.A. Bernad A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9579-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Next, the φ29 DNA polymerase synthesizes a short elongation product before dissociating from the TP (9Méndez J. Blanco L. Salas M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2519-2527Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Replication, which starts at both DNA ends, is coupled to strand displacement. This results in the generation of so-called type I replication intermediates consisting of full-length double-stranded φ29 DNA molecules with one or more single-stranded DNA branches of varying lengths. When the two converging DNA polymerases merge, a type I replication intermediate becomes physically separated into two type II replication intermediates. Each of these consists of a full-length φ29 DNA molecule in which a portion of the DNA, starting from one end, is double-stranded and the portion spanning to the other end is single-stranded (10Inciarte M.R.

This complex recognizes the origin of replication, probably through protein-protein interactions between primer and parental TP (13Gutiérrez J. Vinós J. Prieto I. Méndez E. Hermoso J.M. Salas M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 15073-15079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Secondary structure predictions of φ29 TP showed that the region between residues 84 and 118 has a high probability to form a coiled coil structure. A coiled coil is a structural motif formed between two or more amphipatic α-helices (15Cohen C. Parry D.A. Science. 1994; 263: 488-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 16Lupas A. van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3471) Google Scholar, 17Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). The coiled coil motif is characterized by a heptad repeat denoted abcdefg. Residuesa and d are normally occupied by hydrophobic residues (18Hodges R.S. Curr. Biol. 1992; 2: 122-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) falling on the same side of the helix and forming the hydrophobic interface between two (or more) helices. These hydrophobic interactions provide the major driving force for formation and stability of the coiled coil (19Hu J.C. O'Shea E.K. Kim P.S. Sauer R.T. Science. 1990; 250: 1400-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 20Zhou N.E. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2664-2670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Zhou N.E. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5739-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The residues located at the opposite face participate in intrahelical interactions. These positions generally contain charged residues, which may lead to intrahelical electrostatic attractions or repulsions, thereby stabilizing or destabilizing the coiled coil (22Kohn W.D. Monera O.D. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25495-25506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, coiled coil motifs are often important structures for the formation of protein di- or multimerization. The identified putative coiled coil region in the φ29 TP may provide an appropriate surface for the interaction between parental and primer TP and, hence, it may have an important role in the recognition of the origin of replication. In order to test this hypothesis we constructed site-directed mutants of φ29 TP in which hydrophobic residues located at position a of the predicted amphipatic α-helix were substituted by alanine. In addition, mutants were constructed in which positively charged residues located at position f of the predicted amphipatic α-helix were substituted by the negatively charged residue glutamic acid. The functionality of the purified mutant TPs was analyzed by differentin vitro φ29 DNA replication assays; i.e.initiation, elongation, and amplification. The results obtained indicate that the region of φ29 TP predicted to form an amphipatic α-helix is important for recognition of the origin of replication.

Epicurian coliTM XL1-blue supercompetent cells were used in combination with the QuickchangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit. When necessary, chloramphenicol and ampicillin were added to E. coli cultures at final concentrations of 10 and 100 μg/ml, respectively. All DNA manipulations were carried out according to Sambrook et al. (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes were used as indicated by the suppliers. [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. TP-DNA was prepared as described (25Peñalva M.A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method (26Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Protein sequences were analyzed using version 6.7 of the PCGene Analysis Program (Intelligenetics Inc., Mountain View, CA) and online through the ExPASy Webpage links and the PredictProtein server in Heidelberg. The QuickchangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used as indicated by the supplier for the introduction of mutations in φ29 gene 3, encoding TP.

In these cases template DNAs were denatured for 1 min at 94 °C. Next, DNA fragments were amplified in 30 cycles of denaturation (30 s, 94 °C), primer annealing (1 min; 50 °C), and DNA synthesis (3 min, 73 °C).

In these cases only one of the two sequences is given. The wild-type φ29 TP gene was amplified using the primers Alex1 and Alex2 (see Table I) and φ29 DNA as template. The polymerase chain reaction product obtained was purified, digested with BamHI and NotI, and cloned into pBluescript II Ks+, digested previously with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid was named pBluescript+p3. Next, the QuickchangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit was exploited to introduce mutations in gene 3 using the appropriate primers (TableI) and pBluescript+p3 as template DNA. The presence of the desired mutations and the absence of additional mutations in the resulting plasmids were confirmed by sequence analysis. Next, each of theBamHI-NotI fragments containing either the wild-type φ29 gene 3 or those with the desired mutations were isolated and cloned into the corresponding restriction sites of pUSH1 (28Schön U. Schumann W. Gene (Amst .). 1994; 147: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). As a result, the various gene 3 regions were cloned in-frame behind the His6-tag encoding sequence of pUSH1. The absence of additional mutations in the resulting plasmids was confirmed by sequence analysis. The E. coli strain JM109 was used as a host to overexpress the various His6-tag labeled mutants of TP. For this purpose, overnight cultures were diluted 100-fold in fresh prewarmed LB-medium and grown to an A600 of 0.6 to 0.7. Expression, induced upon isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside addition to a final concentration of 1 mm, was allowed for 2 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at −70 °C until further use. Frozen cells were thawed at 4 °C and ground with twice their weight of alumina powder (Merck) for 20 min. The slurry was resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol) using 4 volumes per gram of cells. To remove the alumina and intact cells the mixture was centrifuged at 2,500 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 2 volumes of buffer A and centrifuged again as before. The pooled supernatants were next centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 × g to pellet the insoluble proteins. These insoluble proteins were resuspended in 2 volumes of 2.5 m guanidine chloride and centrifuged for 30 min at 30,000 × g. The supernatant was first dialyzed against buffer A containing 1 m NaCl, and then against buffer B (50 mm NaPO4 buffer, pH 7.8, 0.5m NaCl, 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The cell extract was centrifuged again for 15 min at 15,000 × gand the supernatant was subsequently passed twice over a 1-ml Ni2+-NTA resin column equilibrated in buffer B. Next, the column was washed with at least 10 column volumes of buffer B containing 20, 30, 40, and 45 mm imidazole, respectively. The recombinant protein was then eluted with 5 ml of buffer B containing 200 mm imidazole. Finally, the eluate was dialyzed against buffer A containing 200 mm NaCl and 50% glycerol, and the protein was stored at −70 °C in aliquots. Wild-type or mutant TPs were incubated, in 0.25 ml, with φ29 DNA polymerase (5 and 10 μg of each protein, respectively; molar ratio 1:1) for 30 min at 4 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mmammonium sulfate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4% glycerol, and 20 μg of BSA. The samples were loaded on top of linear 15–30% glycerol gradients (4 ml) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.45m NaCl, 20 mm ammonium sulfate, 2 mm ZnSO4, 1 mm EDTA, and 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol. In addition, 20 μg of BSA was loaded on the gradients to serve as internal molecular weight marker. The gradients were centrifuged for 24 h at 58,000 rpm in a TST 60.4 Beckman rotor, at 4 °C. After centrifugation the gradients were fractionated from the bottom and aliquots of each fraction were subjected to SDS-PAGE. TP and DNA polymerase were detected by Western blotting. The incubation mixtures contained (in 25 μl) 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm ammonium sulfate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 0.1 μm[α-32P]dATP (1 μCi), 0.5 μg of φ29 TP-DNA, the indicated amount of wild-type or mutant φ29 TP, and 10 ng of φ29 DNA polymerase. After incubation for 5 min at 30 °C, in conditions shown to be linear with time and enzyme amount, the reactions were stopped by adding EDTA to 10 mm and SDS to 0.1%. The samples were filtered through Sephadex G-50 spin columns in the presence of 0.1% SDS. The excluded volumes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The relative amounts of incorporated [α-32P]dAMP were calculated by densitometric analysis of the autoradiographs. In the case of the template-independent assays, TP-DNA was omitted from the reaction mixtures and 1 mmMnCl2 was used as metal activator instead of MgCl2. These latter reactions were carried out for 12 h at 4 °C. The incubation mixtures contained (in 25 μl) 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm ammonium sulfate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 0.5 μg of φ29 TP-DNA, 20 μm each dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, and [α-32P]dATP (1 μCi), the indicated amount of wild-type or mutant φ29 TP, and 10 ng of φ29 DNA polymerase. After incubation for the indicated time at 30 °C the reactions were stopped by adding EDTA to 10 mmand SDS to 0.1%. Next, the samples were filtered through Sephadex G-50 spin columns in the presence of 0.1% SDS. Quantitation of the DNA synthesized in vitro was carried out from the amount of radioactivity (Cerenkov radiation) corresponding to the excluded volume. The size of the synthesized DNA was determined by alkaline-agarose gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. The incubation mixtures contained (in 10 μl) 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm ammonium sulfate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 5 ng of φ29 TP-DNA, 80 μm each dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, and [α-32P]dATP (1 μCi), 8 μg of protein p5 (ssDNA binding protein), 10 μg of protein p6, the indicated amount of wild-type or mutant φ29 TP, and 10 ng of φ29 DNA polymerase. After incubation for the indicated time at 30 °C, the reactions were stopped and the samples were filtered as described above. The DNA amplification factor was calculated as the ratio between the amount of DNA at the end of the reaction (input φ29 DNA plus synthesized DNA) and the amount of input φ29 DNA. Quantitation of the DNA synthesizedin vitro was carried out from the amount of radioactivity (Cerenkov radiation) corresponding to the excluded volume (2.66 nmol of dNTP incorporated, which corresponds to 0.93 × 106cpm, allows the synthesis of 887 ng of dsDNA). The size of the synthesized DNA was determined by alkaline-agarose gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. To study the parental TP function of the class I mutant TPs and the class II TP mutant “VIA” amplification assays, using the same conditions, were carried out for 80 min. Next, additional TP/DNA polymerase heterodimers (5 and 10 μg of TP and DNA polymerase, respectively, in the case of the class I mutant TPs and 20 and 10 μg of TP and DNA polymerase, respectively, in the case of the class II TP mutant) were added and the amplification assay was prolonged up to another 90 min. Aliquots of the reaction mixtures were withdrawn at appropriate times and processed as described above. Like φ29, the genomes of the related Bacillus phages φ15, PZA, BS32, B103, M2, Nf, and GA-1 contain a linear double-stranded DNA molecule of approximately 20 kilobases with a TP molecule linked to their 5′ ends. Based upon complete or partially known DNA sequences these phages have been classified into three groups (29Pecenkova T. Paces V. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 48: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The first group includes phages φ29, φ15, PZA, and BS32, the second group includes B103, M2, and Nf, and the third group contains GA-1 as its sole member. The DNA sequences of the regions encoding the TP are available for φ29 and PZA of group one, Nf and B103 of group two, and GA-1 of group three. These TPs are very similar in size, ranging from 265 to 267 amino acids, sharing an overall similarity of 40.1% (not shown). Analysis of the amino acid sequences of these TPs, using the algorithms of Lupaset al. (16Lupas A. van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3471) Google Scholar), showed that in all these cases the region located between approximately amino acids 80 and 120 has a high probability to form an α-helical coiled coil structure (results not shown). An alignment of this region is shown in Fig. 2 A. Since protein di- or multimerization is often formed through interactions of the hydrophobic sides of amphipatic α-helices (15Cohen C. Parry D.A. Science. 1994; 263: 488-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 16Lupas A. van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3471) Google Scholar, 17Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar), this conserved region of the TP may be a protein-protein interaction domain. In this study we analyzed whether the putative coiled coil domain of φ29 TP, described above, is involved in recognition of the origin of replication through interactions between the α-helices of the primer and parental TP. For this, we introduced various mutations in the DNA region of the φ29 TP encoding the putative coiled coil (see “Materials and Methods”) and studied the behavior of the purified mutant TP proteins in in vitro φ29 DNA replication assays. Fig. 2 B shows a helical wheel presentation of the putative coiled coil region and the position of the various mutations introduced. On one hand hydrophobic residues predicted to form part of the hydrophobic interface (position a) were changed into alanine residues. Thus, in mutant “VIA” the residues Val84 and Ile91 were changed, in mutant “VMA” residues Val105 and Met112 were changed, and in mutant “4A” the four residues Val84, Ile91, Val105, and Met112 were changed into Ala. Whereas these residues are predicted not to change the ability to form an α-helix, the hydrophobic interactions between the α-helices may be altered. On the other hand, positively charged residues located at the non-hydrophobic side of the α-helix (positionf) were replaced by the negatively charged residue glutamic acid with the aim to interfere with possible intrahelical electrostatic attractions. Thus, in mutant “RKE” the residues Arg103and Lys110, and in mutant “3E” the residues Arg96, Arg103, and Lys110 were changed into glutamic acid, respectively. After site-directed mutagenesis (see “Materials and Methods”), the corresponding DNA fragments were cloned in-frame into the N-terminal His6 cloning vector pUSH1 (28Schön U. Schumann W. Gene (Amst .). 1994; 147: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Similarly, the wild-type φ29 TP encoding gene was cloned into pUSH1. After overexpression and purification (see “Materials and Methods”) the various TPs were analyzed in the assays described below. In these assays the protein containing the His6-tag fused to the wild-type TP was considered as wild-type. To evaluate the primer function of mutant TPs, the formation of the TP-dAMP initiation complex (initiation reaction) was studied. Although with a low efficiency, the DNA polymerase is able to deoxynucleotidylate TP in the absence of any template (30Blanco L. Bernad A. Esteban J.A. Salas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1225-1230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which allows to study a possible direct effect of the TP mutations on the initiation reaction, i.e. to analyze the effect on the primer TP function exclusively. Thus, TP-dAMP formation in the absence of template DNA was carried out as described under “Materials and Methods.” Table II shows that the amount of dAMP that was incorporated to the mutant TPs VMA and 3E was at least as efficient as to the wild-type TP. This implies that these mutants interact correctly with the φ29 DNA polymerase and that they are able to serve as a primer when interactions with parental TP are not required. Mutant TPs VIA and RKE were less efficient in these reactions (24 and 30% relative to the wild-type TP, respectively, see Table II), suggesting that the proper interaction with the DNA polymerase could be affected. Finally, compared with the wild-type TP, less than 1% of dAMP was incorporated to the TP mutant 4A indicating that its functional interaction with the DNA polymerase could be severely affected. Alternatively, the mutations introduced in mutants VIA, RKE, or 4A might directly affect the catalysis of the reaction between Ser232 in the TP and dAMP.Table IIPrimer function of wild-type and mutant φ29 TPsφ29 TPTP-dAMP formation 2-aNumbers indicate the activity of mutant TPs with respect to the wild-type TP in %.TP-DNA replication 2-bValues correspond to the relative amount of incorporated dAMP after 10 min reaction time.Absence of templateTP-DNAwt100100100Class IVMA1531141293E1038595Class IIVIA243252RKE305676Class III4A<1<19Assays were carried out with 10 ng of φ29 DNA polymerase and 20 ng of wild-type (wt) or mutant TP.

Open table in a new tab Assays were carried out with 10 ng of φ29 DNA polymerase and 20 ng of wild-type (wt) or mutant TP. Data, mean value of three independent experiments, are given in percentages. The efficiency of the in vitro initiation reaction is enhanced in the presence of template TP-DNA (13Gutiérrez J. Vinós J. Prieto I. Méndez E. Hermoso J.M. Salas M. Virology. 1986; 155: 474-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To study whether the presence of TP-DNA could restore the primer function of the mutant TPs that showed a decreased activity in initiation reactions without template DNA these assays were carried out in the presence of 500 ng of TP-DNA. In addition, these experiments serve to determine whether the presence of parental TP affects the primer function of the mutant TPs. The results, presented in Fig. 3 and Table II, show that the behavior of the mutant TPs was similar to that obtained in initiation reactions lacking template TP-DNA. These results indicate (i) that the presence of TP-DNA does not restore the affected primer function of TP mutants VIA, RKE, or 4A and (ii) that the parental TP has no overall effect on the primer function of the mutant TPs. In summary, based on its primer function the mutant TPs can be divided into three classes. Class I, comprising mutants VMA and 3E, behave as wild-type TP. Class II, comprising mutants VIA and RKE are moderately affected, and class III, comprising mutant 4A is severely affected in its priming function. During φ29 DNA replication the formation of the first TP-dAMP is directed by the second nucleotide at the 3′-end of the template. Then, the TP-dAMP complex slides-back one nucleotide to recover the information of the terminal nucleotide (8Méndez J. Blanco L. Esteban J.A. Bernad A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9579-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). After this step the φ29 DNA polymerase synthesizes a short elongation product before dissociating from the TP (transition step; Ref. 9Méndez J. Blanco L. Salas M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2519-2527Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It is only after the sliding-back and the transition step that the φ29 DNA polymerase carries out highly processive elongation, which is coupled to strand-displacement, to complete replication of the parental strand. To study possible effects of the mutations introduced in the TP on DNA polymerase elongation, replication assays were carried out in which one full round of replication is allowed (see “Materials and Methods”). The results, presented in Fig. 4 and Table II, show that the classification of the mutant TPs in three groups based upon their activity in initiation reactions can be extended to the replication assays. Thus (i) the amount of full-length φ29 DNA synthesized after 10 min using mutants VMA and 3E was similar to that synthesized using wild-type TP, (ii) those synthesized using mutants VIA and RKE were lower and, (iii) the amount of full-length φ29 DNA synthesized was only 9% compared with the wild-type in case of mutant 4A. Only 0.5% of φ29 DNA was labeled in control reactions in the absence of TP (results not shown). These results suggest that most of the low activity of muta"

During this ATPase cycle, the actin-myosin interaction undergoes a cyclic transition between the strong- and weak-binding states. In the absence of a nucleotide or in the presence of ADP,i.e. in the strong-binding state, myosin binds tightly with actin through two hydrophobic sites at the distal ends of the upper and lower 50K subdomains (1Fisher A.J.

Deletion of one of these hydrophobic sites of myosin, i.e.the myopathy loop, resulted in loss of this strong binding with actin (3Sasaki N. Asukagawa H. Yasuda R. Hiratsuka T. Sutoh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37840-37844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) showing that cooperative binding of these hydrophobic sites of myosin to actin is essential for establishing the strong-binding state. However, in the presence of ATP, i.e. in the weak-binding state, myosin associated with actin only weakly through ionic interactions between negatively charged residues of actin and positively charged residues in the 50K/20K loop (loop 2) (Fig. 1). In fact, mutations to increase or decrease the number of positively charged residues in loop 2 dramatically altered the apparent affinity of actin and myosin in the presence of ATP (4Rovner A.S.

The upper and lower 50K subdomains separated by the 50K cleft are connected to each other by three loops (1Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I.

Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. Cohen C. Cell. 1998; 94: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The switch II loop is at the bottom of the 50K cleft, whereas the other two loops are at the distal end of the cleft. The strut loop has a stretched conformation, encompassing two α-helices in the upper and lower 50K subdomains. Therefore, the loop is expected to play a role as a strut and keep the relative disposition of the two subdomains. The sequence and length of the strut loop are strongly conserved among all myosin family members, suggesting the functional importance of the loop. To examine the functional roles of this loop, especially in a transition between the strong- and weak-binding states during the ATPase cycle, we used the Dictyostelium expression system (8O'Halloran T.J. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8110-8114Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 9Kubalek E.W. Uyeda T.Q. Spudich J.A. Mol. Biol.

Nature. 1994; 368: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). By means of this system, a single residue was inserted into or deleted from the strut loop of Dictyostelium myosin II. Detailed examination of these mutant myosins and their fragments showed that these mutations, especially the insertion mutations, selectively abolished the strong-binding state. An alanine, aspartic acid, or proline residue was inserted into the strut sequence by site-directed mutagenesis of the heavy-chain gene ofDictyostelium myosin II to generate four types of insertion mutants, KADP, KDAP, KDDP, and KDPP. Asp590 in the strut sequence was deleted by site-directed mutagenesis to generate a deletion mutant, Δ590. Each of these mutant heavy-chain genes was fused to the Dictyostelium actin-15 promoter and actin-6 terminator and finally inserted into a multicopy extrachromosomal vector, pBIG, to drive its expression in Dictyosteliumcells. The plasmid carrying one of these mutant heavy-chain genes was introduced into Dictyostelium myosin-null cells in which the myosin II heavy-chain gene had been knocked out (14Manstein D.J. Titus M.A. De L.A. Spudich J.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar).Dictyostelium cells thus transformed were selected as before (3Sasaki N. Asukagawa H. Yasuda R.

The heavy chain was truncated at Glu836 by introducing a stop codon at the corresponding location of the myosin heavy-chain gene. After fusing the actin-15 promoter and actin-6 terminator, each of these S1 genes was inserted into a multicopy vector, PTIKLOE (3Sasaki N. Asukagawa H. Yasuda R. Hiratsuka T. Sutoh K. J. Biol.

The regulatory light-chain gene was modified in such a way that a histidine tag (His6) was attached at its N terminus for easy purification of S1 by inserting the corresponding synthetic oligonucleotides between the start codon and the coding sequence of the light chain. The resulting vector was introduced into Dictyostelium AX2 cells, and transformants were selected. Phosphorylated full-length myosin was prepared as described (3Sasaki N. Asukagawa H. Yasuda R.

S1 was extracted from transformedDictyostelium cells and precipitated as actoS1 after dialysis against a solvent comprising 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MOPS, pH 6.8, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Then, S1 was extracted from the precipitate with a solvent comprising 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 0.25 m NaCl, 7 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm ATP. The extract was directly applied to an NTA-Ni2+-agarose column (QIAGEN). Some mutant S1s, however, failed to form the actoS1 precipitate. For purification of each of these mutant S1s, the extract from Dictyostelium cells was dialyzed against a solvent comprising 0.3 m KCl, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, and 2 mm MgCl2. The supernatant after ultracentrifugation was then directly applied to the NTA-Ni2+ column. After the column had been washed with 1-column volume of the above solvent supplemented with 1 mmATP, S1 was eluted with 200 mm imidazole, pH 7.4. The elute was concentrated with Ultrafree (Millipore) and then applied to a POROS-Q column (Perceptive). Proteins were eluted by a gradient of NaCl from 0 to 1 m. The eluted fractions were dialyzed against a solvent containing 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, and 2 mm MgCl2. They were then centrifuged at 100,000 rpm for 30 min (Beckman TL100) before use. Concentrations of full-length myosin were determined by Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). Determination of S1 concentrations was based onA280 = 105,600 m−1cm−1. ATPase activities were measured as described (15Shimada T. Sasaki N. Ohkura R. Sutoh K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14037-14043Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 16Sasaki N. Shimada T. Ohkura R.

The time courses of binding of mant-ATP or mant-ADP or release of mant-ADP to and from wild-type or mutant S1 were recorded by a stopped-flow apparatus with a fluorescence detector (Applied Photophysics SX18) (19Kuhlman P.A. Bagshaw C.R. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 491-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Binding of wild-type or mutant S1 to pyrene actin was measured as described (3Sasaki N.

For co-precipitation experiments, F-actin (10 μm) was mixed with wild-type or mutant S1 (2 μm) in 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, and 2 mm MgCl2, or in 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2 and ADP. The mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C(Beckman TL100). The supernatant and precipitate were separated and analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis to determine the relative amount of S1 co-precipitated with F-actin. In vitromotility assays were performed in the presence of 0.2 or 0.7% methylcellulose as described previously (16Sasaki N. Shimada T. Ohkura R. Sutoh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20334-20340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The sequence of the strut loop ofDictyostelium myosin II, Asp590-Pro591-Leu592-Gln593, is conserved among myosin family members. The loop has a stretched conformation, connecting two α-helices embedded in the upper and lower 50K subdomains. Although the peptide backbone of the loop is exposed to the solvent, the side chains of Leu592 and Gln593 are in contact with other hydrophobic side chains in the upper 50K subdomain, whereas those of Asp590 and Pro591 are somehow exposed (1Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 2Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Therefore, the N-terminal half of the loop is a good target of site-directed mutations. To increase the length of the strut loop, a single Ala residue was inserted between Lys589 and Asp590 or between Asp590 and Pro591. The former mutant was designated as KADP and the latter as KDAP. An Asp or Pro residue was also inserted between Asp590 and Pro591 to make two additional insertion mutants, KDDP and KDPP. Furthermore, the most conserved residue in the strut loop, Asp590, was deleted to make a deletion mutant, designated as Δ590. As a control for these insertion or deletion mutants, we generated a mutant myosin, designated as the Ala mutant, in which two residues in the strut sequence, Asp590 and Pro591, were replaced by two alanine residues. These mutant myosins were expressed inDictyostelium myosin-null cells to examine whether they were functional in vivo. Transformants expressing the insertion or deletion mutants exhibited phenotypes very similar to those of myosin-null cells: they neither grew in suspension nor formed fruiting bodies upon starvation, indicating that insertion or deletion of a single residue in the strut sequence abolished in vivo motor functions of myosin. Unlike these insertion or deletion mutants, the Ala mutant completely complemented the phenotypic defects of myosin-null cells, showing that although the residues in the strut sequence are conserved among various types of myosins, their side chains are not essential for maintainingin vivo functions of myosin. These results imply that the particular length, and not the sequence, of the strut loop is critical for the motor functions of myosin. Because insertion or deletion of a single residue in the strut sequence resulted in the loss of in vivo functions of myosin, the in vitro properties of these mutant myosins as well as the Ala mutant were examined by using purified proteins. First, basal and actin-activated MgATPase activities of wild-type and mutant myosins were measured (Table I). The basal levels of MgATPase activity of KDDP, KDPP, KDAP, and KADP myosins were 0.07, 0.04, 0.04, and 0.07 s−1, respectively, very similar to that of wild-type myosin (0.07 s−1). Unlike these insertion mutants, the deletion mutant exhibited highly elevated basal ATPase activity (0.64 s−1). The insertion and deletion mutations reduced actin-activated ATPase activity.Vmax values of the actin-activated ATPase activity of KDDP, KDPP, KDAP, and KADP myosins were 0.39, 0.24, 0.13, and 0.37 s−1, respectively, whereas that of the wild type was 1.57 s−1. Although weakly, actin clearly activated the MgATPase activity of these insertion mutants (3–5-fold activation). Km values of actin-activated ATPase activity of the insertion mutants were lower than that of wild type, although it is difficult to quantitatively compare these lowKm values with large errors. Loss of strong binding would rarely affect Km because it mainly reflects weak interactions of actin and myosin. The insertion mutations may have induced conformational changes of loop 2, which is closely located to the strut loop and is the main binding site with actin in the weak-binding state, resulting in observed changes inKm. Actin only slightly activated the ATPase activity of the deletion mutant (1.2–1.4-fold activation), which exhibited a high level of basal activity even in the absence of actin. The Ala mutant exhibited similar basal ATPase activity (0.09 s−1) to that of wild type, although the level of actin-activation of the ATPase activity was reduced by the mutation;Vmax was 0.56 s−1 for the mutant and 1.57 s−1 for the wild type.Table IIn vitro functions of wild-type and mutant myosinsMg-ATPase activityActin activated Mg-ATPase activityKmIn vitro motilitys−1s−1μmμm/secWT0.07 ± 0.011.57 ± 0.110.56 ± 0.061.2 ± 0.2KAA0.09 ± 0.010.56 ± 0.050.28 ± 0.120.5 ± 0.2KADP0.07 ± 0.010.37 ± 0.010.38 ± 0.05non-motileKDAP0.04 ± 0.010.13 ± 0.000.18 ± 0.03non-motileKDDP0.07 ± 0.010.39 ± 0.140.35 ± 0.01non-motileKDPP0.04 ± 0.010.24 ± 0.050.20 ± 0.04non-motileΔ5900.64 ± 0.051.31 ± 0.050.08 ± 0.09non-motile Open table in a new tab The motor functions of these mutants were further investigated by means of in vitro motility assays. Under standard motility assay conditions, continuous, one-directional sliding of actin filaments was observed for the wild-type and Ala mutants. The velocity of sliding of actin filaments was 1.2 ± 0.2 μm/sec and 0.5 ± 0.2 μm/sec for the wild type and the mutant, respectively (Table I). As expected from the observation that neither insertion nor deletion mutants complemented phenotypic defects of myosin-null cells, these insertion or deletion mutants could not drive the sliding of actin filaments. The basal MgATPase activities of wild-type and mutant S1s were determined (Table II). Consistent with the results obtained for full-length myosins, the insertion mutants as well as the Ala mutant showed normal levels of basal ATPase activity, whereas the deletion mutant exhibited highly elevated activity.Table IIKinetic parameters of wild-type and mutant S1sWTKADPKDAPKDDPKDPPΔ590Mant-ATP association (μm −1 s −1)1.58 ± 0.061.43 ± 0.072.27 ± 0.121.58 ± 0.110.94 ± 0.150.95 ± 0.10Mant-ADP association (μm −1 s −1)1.53 ± 0.050.46 ± 0.130.44 ± 0.040.73 ± 0.080.38 ± 0.110.63 ± 0.05Mant-ADP release (s −1)2.0 ± 0.33.6 ± 0.13.6 ± 0.03.6 ± 0.05.3 ± 0.14.9 ± 0.1Turn-over rate (s −1)0.07 ± 0.050.16 ± 0.000.09 ± 0.010.12 ± 0.010.07 ± 0.000.63 ± 0.20 Open table in a new tab To investigate further how the insertion or deletion mutations perturbed the structures around the ATPase site, the rates of binding of mant-ATP to wild-type and mutant S1s were determined (Table II). The rates of binding and release of mant-ADP to and from wild-type and mutant S1s were also determined (Table II). These results showed that these rates were similar for all of the mutants and the wild type. Thus, as far as the insertion mutants are concerned, these mutations affected neither the basal ATPase activity nor the rates of binding and release of a nucleotide to and from the ATPase site, implying that structural changes induced by these mutations were confined to the mutation site and did not propagate toward the ATPase site. The notion was further supported by our observation that the insertion mutants exhibited an initial ADP-burst with a burst size of about 0.3 (data not shown); an indication that the rate-limiting step of the ATPase cycle was unchanged by these mutations. Unlike the insertion mutations, the deletion mutation seems to have induced some structural changes at the ATPase site, as shown by the high level of basal ATPase activity, although the rates of binding or release of a nucleotide to or from the ATPase site remained virtually unchanged, as in the case of the insertion mutants. First, effects of the mutations on actin-S1 interactions were examined by using pyrene-labeled F-actin. As shown in Fig. 2 a, pyrene-fluorescence conjugated on actin was quantitatively quenched upon addition of wild-type S1 in the absence of a nucleotide, an indication that the rigor complex was formed. When any of the insertion or deletion mutant S1s was mixed with pyrene-labeled actin, however, pyrene-fluorescence was rarely quenched at the concentrations used in this study, showing that the insertion or deletion mutants virtually lost the ability to form strong, hydrophobic bonds with actin even in the absence of a nucleotide. Similar results were obtained in the presence of ADP (Fig. 2 b), although the association of actin and wild-type S1 was slightly weakened compared with the binding in the absence of a nucleotide, as previously shown. To exclude the possibility that the deletion or insertion mutants tightly bound to actin without quenching the pyrene fluorescence, binding of actin and S1 was also directly determined by co-precipitation experiments (Fig. 2 c). In the absence of a nucleotide, wild-type S1 was co-precipitated with F-actin quantitatively by ultracentrifugation. On addition of ADP, the binding of wild-type S1 to actin was slightly weakened as shown by the pyrene-quenching, but was still strong so that all of S1 were precipitated with excess amount of actin (Fig. 2 c). On addition of ATP, most (about 90%) of wild-type S1 was released into the supernatant. Under all conditions examined here, i.e. in the absence of a nucleotide, in the presence of ADP or in the presence of ATP, similar amounts of the mutant S1s (about 80%) remained in the supernatant even when excess amounts of actin were added. It is unlikely that the mutant S1s were denatured and partially lost the ability to bind to actin, considering the observation that the amount of bound S1 gradually increased with increasing actin concentration up to 10 μm for one of the mutants (KDDP) (Fig. 2 d); an indication that the mutant S1 bound weakly to actin. This notion is supported by the fact that basal ATPase activities of wild-type and mutant S1s were similar to each other (Table II). Taking all of these results into account, it is very likely that both the insertion and deletion mutations virtually abolished the strong binding of S1 to actin, driving the mutants to take the weak binding state even in the absence of a nucleotide or in the presence of ADP. The notion was supported by our observation that the remaining binding of mutant S1s detected by the co-precipitation experiments was lost when 0.5m NaCl was included in the solvent (data not shown). All these results obtained by the co-precipitation experiments were consistent with the pyrene-quenching experiments shown above. During the ATP hydrolysis cycle, myosin cyclically undergoes a transition between the strong- and weak-binding states, depending on the state of the nucleotide in the ATPase site. Coupling of this transition with swinging of the lever arm appears to be essential for successful power strokes. In fact, we previously showed that deletion of the myopathy loop of Dictyostelium myosin II, one of the hydrophobic binding sites to actin, resulted in the loss of the strong-binding state and thereby the virtual loss of motor functions (3Sasaki N. Asukagawa H. Yasuda R. Hiratsuka T. Sutoh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37840-37844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This result implies that cooperative binding of two hydrophobic sites on myosin (one at the myopathy loop in the upper 50K subdomain and the other at the distal end of the lower 50K subdomain) with actin is essential for establishing the strong-binding state and achieving successful power strokes. The strut loop is one of the three loops connecting the upper and lower 50K subdomains of myosin, encompassing two α-helices in these subdomains. Because the other two loops connecting the upper and lower 50K subdomains are very flexible, the strut loop that has a stretched conformation and bulky side chains is expected to be a strut for determining the relative disposition of these two subdomains. Thus, we tried to change the relative disposition of the two hydrophobic sites at the distal ends of these two subdomains by inserting or deleting a single residue in the strut loop. All of the insertion and deletion mutations caused loss of in vivo and in vitromotor functions of full-length myosin. In the case of the insertion mutations, this loss is likely to have resulted from loss of the strong-binding state, which was caused by local structural changes at the strut loop. The structural changes by the insertion mutations seem to have been confined to the strut loop and not propagated to other sites, considering the fact that full-length myosin and S1 of these insertion mutants exhibited similar levels of activities to wild type in assays performed in the absence of actin (see Tables I and II). Unlike the insertion mutations, the deletion mutation seems to have caused not only local structural changes around the strut loop but also changes around the ATPase site, possibly at the back door located at the base of the 50K cleft (20Yount R.G. Lawson D. Rayment I. Biophys. J. 1995; 20 (; Discussion 47S–49S): 44S-47SGoogle Scholar), resulting in loss of the strong-binding state and highly elevated basal ATPase activity without much affecting the rates of nucleotide-binding and release (Table II). When the two conserved residues of the strut sequence, Asp590 and Pro591, were replaced with alanine, the mutants were still functional in vivo. Consistent with the in vivo results, purified proteins exhibited in vitro motor functions (Table I). Thus, it is very likely that the side chains in the strut sequence, especially Asp590 and Pro591, were not essential for the transition between the strong- and weak-binding states. The observed defects of the insertion or deletion mutants, therefore, may have resulted from changes in length of the strut loop, not from sequence changes. This notion is consistent with the fact that similar effects were observed by insertion of different types of residues at different locations. The crystal structure of the Dictyostelium myosin motor domain with bound ADP/BeFx seems to correspond to the M or M.ADP state,i.e. the strong-binding state, whereas that with ADP/Vi seems to correspond to the M*.ATP or M**.ADP.Pi state,i.e. the weak-binding state (1Fisher A.J.

Nature. 1998; 396: 380-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Comparison of these two crystal structures shows that the length and conformation of the strut loop are almost identical between them. However, the relative disposition of the upper and lower 50K subdomains around the strut loop is slightly different between the two states because of rotations of the two domains around this rigid loop. Although further changes in the relative orientation of the two domains are expected upon the transition between the strong- and weak-binding states (22Rayment I. Holden H.M. Whittaker M. Yohn C.B. Lorenz M. Holmes K.C. Milligan R.A. Science. 1993; 261: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar), the strut loop may set a limit for such changes. Thus, judging from our observation that only a slight change in the length of the strut loop abolishes the strong-binding state, the transition between the strong- and weak-binding states during the ATPase cycle may involve only restricted rotations of the two hydrophobic binding sites on the motor domain, i.e. the myopathy loop in the upper 50K subdomain and the hydrophobic residues at the distal end of the lower 50K subdomain, around the strut loop. Structural changes around the ATPase site induced by binding and hydrolysis of ATP (1Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I.

These cooperative motions would allow myosins to “run” along an actin filament by repeated hydrolysis of ATP.

https://openalex.org/W1988444525,"Human γ-glutamyl hydrolase (hGH) is a central enzyme in folyl and antifolylpoly-γ-glutamate metabolism, which functions by catalyzing the cleavage of the γ-glutamyl chain of substrates. We previously reported that Cys-110 is essential for activity. Using the sequence of hGH as a query, alignment searches of protein data bases were made using the SSearch and TPROBE programs. Significant similarity was found between hGH and the glutamine amidotransferase type I domain of Escherichia colicarbamoyl phosphate synthetase. The resulting hypothesis is that the catalytic fold of hGH is similar to the folding of this domain in carbamoyl phosphate synthetase. This model predicts that Cys-110 of hGH is the active site nucleophile and forms a catalytic triad with residues His-220 and Glu-222. The hGH mutants C110A, H220A, and E222A were prepared. Consistent with the model, mutants C110A and H220A were inactive. However, the Vmax of the E222A hGH mutant was reduced only 6-fold relative to the wild-type enzyme. The model also predicted that His-171 in hGH may be involved in substrate binding. The H171N hGH mutant was found to have a 250-fold reducedVmax.

Folate is required as a cofactor by several enzymes in thede novo biosynthesis of DNA precursors and several amino acids. Antifolates (for example, methotrexate (MTX)) have been the traditional treatment for many cancers. When the cell takes up folates or antifolates, they are poly-γ-glutamylated by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase (EC 6.3.2.17) (1McGuire J.J. Coward J.K. Blakely R.L. Benkovic S.L. Folates and Pterins. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1984: 135-190Google Scholar). These polyglutamates are retained intracellularly and are generally better substrates or inhibitors of the target enzymes (2Galivan J. Mol.

GH alters these properties by catalyzing the removal of the polyglutamate chain (1McGuire J.J. Coward J.K. Blakely R.L. Benkovic S.L. Folates and Pterins.

Although GH is known to cleave folylpolyglutamates, ultimately yielding folylmonoglutamate and glutamate, its role in the intracellular folate-dependent pathways remains unclear. Similarly, the role of GH in folate deficiencies is ambiguous. Increased GH activity (7Rhee M.S. Wang Y. Nair M.G. Galivan J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2227-2230PubMed Google Scholar, 8Yao R. Rhee M.S.

Recently, the ratio of folylpolyglutamate synthetase and GH activities has been demonstrated to be an indicator of MTX polyglutamylation in acute lymphocytic leukemia (13Longo G.S. A Gorlick R. Tong W.P. Lin S. Steinherz P. Bertino J.R. Oncol. Res. 1997; 9: 259-263PubMed Google Scholar), and inherent resistance to MTX in acute myelogenous leukemia (14Rots M.G. Pieters R. Peters G.J.

However, clarification of the role of GH in these outcomes is unavailable. Therefore, definition of the active site residues and mechanism of human GH (hGH) will be necessary steps in developing specific inhibitors to assess its cellular function. Despite the important role of GH in folate function and antifolate therapeutics, no structural studies of the enzyme have been carried out. The catalytic mechanism of GH is not known. It has been established that the rat and human GH proteins are inhibited by iodoacetic acid (1McGuire J.J. Coward J.K. Blakely R.L. Benkovic S.L. Folates and Pterins. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1984: 135-190Google Scholar, 15Rhee M.S. Lindau-Shepard B. Chave K.J. Galivan J. Ryan T.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 1040-1046PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that at least one cysteine is important for activity. In a previous study (16Chave K.J. Galivan J. Ryan T.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 551-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using site-directed mutagenesis, we altered the cDNA for hGH to encode four different proteins, each with one of four cysteine residues changed to alanine. Three of the mutant proteins had activities similar to wild-type hGH and were inhibited by iodoacetic acid, whereas the C110A mutant protein had no activity. Cys-110 is conserved among the human, rat, and mouse GH amino acid sequences. These results indicate that Cys-110 is essential for enzyme activity and suggest that GH is a cysteine peptidase. The present study extends this earlier work by using comparative molecular modeling to predict the catalytic fold and presents the first molecular model for hGH. The catalytic fold of hGH is predicted to be similar to that of the glutamine amidotransferase type I (GATase) domain of the small subunit of carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase (CPS, EC 6.3.5.5) from Escherichia coli (eCPS). In the model, Cys-110 is proposed as the active site nucleophile, and His-220 and Glu-222 are predicted to be the other amino acids in the putative catalytic triad. The model also predicts that His-171 is involved in substrate binding but not catalysis. Site-directed mutagenesis of these conserved amino acids followed by characterization of the purified mutant proteins was used to test the predictions of the model. Determination of the active site fold is the first step in defining the structure of hGH in order to develop specific inhibitors that can be used to understand the role of this enzyme in folate homeostasis and antifolate therapy. A two-step process was used to generate the sequence alignment model. First, using the sequence of hGH as the query, a search of Swiss-Prot plus TrEMBL data bases was made using the program SSearch (17Pearson W.R. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1145-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), which uses the Smith-Waterman algorithm to identify statistically significant sequence similarities. The set of protein sequences obtained from this search was then used as a starting set for analysis using the program TPROBE (18Neuwald A.F. Liu J.S. Lipman D.J. Lawrence C.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1665-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). TPROBE performs a Gibbs alignment of this set, and it generates motif models based on this alignment. These alignment motifs are next used to search the non-redundant data bases to extract additional sequences that fit the alignment model. TPROBE then purges sequences that are closely related so that each pair of sequences in the set has a BLAST maximal segment pair score less than a cutoff score. For our analysis, the cutoff score was set at 150. TPROBE then performs a Gibbs alignment on this set and generates a new alignment model. This process is repeated until the number of recruited sequences does not increase significantly. As described unde “Results,” this process identified seven motifs of the GATase family of proteins. The motifs of the GATase domains of proteins of known structure were then aligned with the corresponding motifs in hGH. The SEGMOD module of GeneMine (Molecular Applications Group, Palo Alto, CA) was then used to generate a molecular model by homology between hGH and the most similar sequence with known structure. This procedure uses a data base search strategy and energy minimization algorithm (19Levitt M. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 170: 723-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 20Levitt M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 507-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The coordinates of the known structure are used as a basis to derive predicted coordinates of the target protein. The coordinates of the parent are combined with coordinates of target homologous segments from the structural data base to construct 10 initial models. Then an average model based on these 10 is derived. Energy minimization is employed to reduce steric overlap and produce the final predicted structure. The cDNA for the mature forms of wild-type and C110A hGH were subcloned from pET24a (16Chave K.J. Galivan J. Ryan T.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 551-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into the NdeI andBamHI sites of the pET28b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) using standard molecular biology protocols (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). This added an N-terminal His tag to the proteins. The final expressed protein had the N-terminal sequence Met-Gly-Ser-Ser-His-His-His-His-His-His-Ser-Ser-Gly-Leu-Val-Pro-Arg-Gly-Ser-Met before Arg-1 of the previously described sequence of the mature enzyme (15Rhee M.S. Lindau-Shepard B. Chave K.J. Galivan J. Ryan T.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 1040-1046PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the QuickChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol using the expression vector for the wild-type enzyme as the template, except that 100 ng of each oligonucleotide was used, and the annealing temperature was reduced to 53 °C. Oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis of wild-type hGH to H220A, E222A, and H171N were as follows: GHH220A+, 5′-TGT CCA GTG GGC TCC AGA GAA AGC-3′; GHH220A−, 5′-GCT TTC TCT GGA GCC CAC TGG ACA-3′; GHE222A+, 5′-GTG GCA TCC AGC GAA AGC ACC TT-3′; GHE222A−, 5′-AAG GTG CTT TCG CTG GAT GCC AC-3′; GHH171N+, 5′-CTG CCA ATT TCA ATA AGT GGA GCC TCT CCG-3′; GHH171N- 5′-CGG AGA GGC TCC ACT TAT TGA AAT TGG CAG-3′. The nucleotides altered during site-directed mutagenesis are underlined. After mutagenesis, plasmids were purified using the QIAfilter plasmid midi kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol, and the entire hGH open reading frame was sequenced on an ABI 377 sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Wild-type enzyme or mutants of hGH were expressed in an E. coli expression system (Novagen) as described previously (16Chave K.J. Galivan J. Ryan T.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 551-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type or mutant hGH proteins were purified to homogeneity by a two-step procedure. The clarified sonicate from 1 liter of culture was purified by nickel chelate chromatography on a HisBind column (6.3 × 1.0 cm) at either room temperature or 4 °C following the manufacturer's protocol (Novagen). Eluate containing hGH protein was dialyzed into 0.05 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 0.05 m 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 m NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Aliquots (2 ml) were further purified by gel filtration chromatography at 4 °C on a Sephacryl S-200 column (2.5 × 95 cm) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the same buffer with a flow rate of 20 ml/h. Fractions (2.5 ml) containing hGH protein were pooled, and the protein was concentrated using an Amicon (Beverley, MA) stirred cell with a YM-10 membrane. Protein concentrations were determined as described previously (16Chave K.J. Galivan J. Ryan T.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 551-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was measured using the substrate 4-NH2-10-CH3PteGlu2(MTXG2, Shirck Laboratories, Jona, Switzerland) as described previously (16Chave K.J. Galivan J. Ryan T.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 551-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and kinetic constants were determined as described previously (16Chave K.J. Galivan J. Ryan T.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 551-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results presented are an average of at least two protein preparations and three sets of assays per protein preparation. To determine the secondary structure of wild-type and mutant hGH proteins, measurements were made on a Jasco 720 spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). Three scans were made at 20 nm/min between 260 and 200 nm in a 0.05-, 0.02-, or 0.01-cm cell at 25 °C. After subtraction of the buffer spectra, the data were converted to molar ellipicity units. The Selcon program (22Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar) was used to calculate the α helix, β sheet, turns, and random structure. By using the SSearch and TPROBE programs, a statistically significant similarity was found between the GATase type I group of proteins and hGH. TPROBE generated an alignment model with seven motifs. A total of 391 sequences were identified as members of this superfamily. The Sequence Logo alignment model (23Schneider T.D. Stephens R.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6097-6100Crossref PubMed Scopus (2463) Google Scholar) illustrated in Fig. 1 uses 47 of these sequences since TPROBE purges sequences that are too closely related. The numbering used corresponds to that for mature hGH (15Rhee M.S. Lindau-Shepard B. Chave K.J. Galivan J. Ryan T.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 1040-1046PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, the well characterized GATase catalytic residues cysteine, histidine, and a putative third residue, glutamate, are strongly conserved in the sequence alignment model. Among the set of sequences that belong to the identified superfamily, the small subunit of eCPS (24Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), GMP synthetase from E. coli (25Tesmer J.J.G. Klem T.J. Deras M.L. Davisson V.J. Smith J.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 74-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), and anthranilate synthase from Sulfolobus solfataricus (26Knochel T. Ivens A. Hester G. Gonzalez A. Bauerle R. Wilmanns M. Kirschner K. Jansonius J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9479-9484Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) have known high resolution x-ray structures with Protein Data Bank accession numbers1jdb, 1gpm, and 1qdl, respectively. A molecular model of hGH is presented in Fig. 2. The image was generated with the program MolScript (27Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and rendered by the program Raster3D (28Merritt E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3878) Google Scholar). The model was generated by first aligning amino acid sequences in hGH with the corresponding sequence in eCPS and then using eCPS as a template structure for the SEGMOD module of GeneMine. The other structures were aligned as well, but the modeling software selected eCPS, which is the most similar sequence to hGH, with a 17% similarity. The superimposition of the α-carbon atoms of the hGH model with 1jdb chain C, 1qdl chain B, and 1gpm chain A had root mean square deviation Cα values of 1.02, 4.76, and 8.37 angstroms, respectively. The regions that can be predicted with confidence are those that in the alignment model have a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) score that is positive or close to zero maximum. In hGH, these regions are residues 95–124, 199–223, 59–82, 21–48, and 157–181, corresponding to 254–283, 332–356, 226–249, 190–217, and 298–322 in 1jdb chain C. Each individual motif is colored in Fig. 2 in order of descending statistical significance as follows: orange 95–124, blue 199–223,gold 59–82, salmon 21–48, sea green157–181. Red regions represent those sequences outside of the five significant motifs. There are four regions in hGH that are sequence insertions with respect to eCPS. The sequence insertion in hGH of residues 142–159 has corresponding but slightly smaller insertion regions in 1gpm chain A and 1qdl chain B compared with 1jdb chain C. The other three insertions are unique to hGH, since they do not occur in the other structures. These insertions are shown in redin Fig. 2.Figure 2Molecular model of human γ-glutamyl hydrolase. The model was generated using the TPROBE alignment and the SEGMOD module in GeneMine. Red regions are those outside the five significant motifs identified by SEGMOD. The significant motifs are in color: residues 95–124 (orange), residues 199–223 (blue), residues 59–82 (gold), residues 21–48 (salmon), and residues 157–181 (sea green). The residues corresponding to the proposed catalytic triad of hGH are Cys-110 (yellow), His-220 (pale blue), and Glu-222 (bisque). Catalytically important His-171 in hGH is shown in pale blue. A, the entire molecular model of hGH.B, magnification of the area containing the catalytic amino acids.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As a test of the proposed structure, a model structure for the subunit of GMP synthetase, 1gpm chain A, was calculated using the same procedure. The percent similarity of the alignment between 1gpm chain A and 1jdb chain C is 19%. Since this value is close to the 17% similarity between hGH and 1jdb chain C, the model structure for 1gpmchain A can be used as a positive control to validate the molecular modeling of hGH. The region 7–207 of 1gpm chain A was modeled using1jdb chain C as a template structure. The region starts with the first motif identified by TPROBE and ends with the last motif. The region includes the two non-significant motifs. A structural superimposition of the five significant motifs between the 1gpm chain A model and the known 1gpm chain A structure (25Tesmer J.J.G. Klem T.J. Deras M.L. Davisson V.J. Smith J.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 74-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) had a root mean square deviation Cα of 3.86 Å, and the overall superimposition had a root mean square deviation Cα of 4.99 Å. The overall fold of the model was similar to the known structure. As expected, the model of the loop, 1gpm chain A 117–131, corresponding to the insertion in 1gpm, is not accurate, and the five significant motifs (1gpm chain A 71–100, 160–184, 44–67, 9–36, and 129–153) overlap quite well. The model predicts that Cys-110 in hGH (yellow in Fig. 2) is analogous to Cys-269 in eCPS. eCPS contains two domains and catalyzes the synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate from bicarbonate, glutamine, and two molecules of MgATP. The smaller subunit is the site of glutamine hydrolysis to produce ammonia for delivery to the larger subunit. eCPS and other members of the GATase I family of enzymes contain a Cys-His-Glu catalytic triad (25Tesmer J.J.G. Klem T.J. Deras M.L. Davisson V.J. Smith J.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 74-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Cys-269 in eCPS functions as the active site nucleophile in the small subunit, attacking the γ-carbonyl of glutamine to form a glutamyl thioester intermediate (29Thoden J.B. Miran S.G. Phillips J.C. Howard A.J. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8825-8831Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). His-220 (pale blue in Fig. 2) and Glu-222 in hGH (bisque in Fig. 2) are predicted to be the other two amino acids in the proposed catalytic triad corresponding to His-353 and Glu-355 in eCPS. The alignment model also predicts that His-171 in hGH (pale blue in Fig. 2) is analogous to His-312 in eCPS. The addition of an N-terminal HisTag to hGH enabled the purification to homogeneity of large quantities of wild-type and mutant proteins from the E. coli expression system (Fig. 3). The wild-type enzyme and mutant proteins reacted with a polyclonal antibody raised against hGH expressed in insect cells (Fig. 3) (15Rhee M.S. Lindau-Shepard B. Chave K.J. Galivan J. Ryan T.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 1040-1046PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the secondary structures of wild-type and mutant hGH proteins by circular dichroism (TableI) indicated that they were essentially the same, demonstrating that the site-directed mutagenesis did not significantly alter the protein folding.Table ISecondary structure prediction of wild-type and mutant hGH proteinsProteinα-helixβ-sheetTurnRandom%%%%Wild type27.7 ± 3.328.3 ± 5.524.9 ± 1.218.0 ± 5.7C110A30.0 ± 3.027.1 ± 4.126.3 ± 0.716.3 ± 3.8H220A33.0 ± 1.721.5 ± 3.426.1 ± 0.819.1 ± 2.6E222A31.0 ± 5.223.1 ± 5.425.6 ± 1.219.6 ± 3.4H171N28.9 ± 1.027.5 ± 4.525.6 ± 1.222.4 ± 2.1Circular dichroism spectra were generated between 260 and 200 nm.

The purified wild-type and mutant hGH proteins were assayed for activity with MTXG2 (Table II). The kinetic constants obtained for the wild-type hGH protein with an N-terminal His tag were similar to previous results with a non-His-tag hGH protein (16Chave K.J. Galivan J. Ryan T.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 551-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the addition of the N-terminal His tag had no effect on hGH activity. As predicted by the molecular modeling and previous results in a non-His-tag expression system (16Chave K.J. Galivan J. Ryan T.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 551-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), mutation of Cys-110 to alanine in the His-tag construct produced inactive enzyme. Mutation of His-220 to alanine also produced an inactive enzyme, confirming the critical role of this amino acid in catalysis. Mutation of Glu-222 to alanine produced active enzyme, with a Km similar to that of the wild-type hGH and a 6-fold reduced Vmax (Table II). Mutating His-171 to asparagine produced an enzyme with a 250-fold reduction inVmax (Table II) but an unchangedKm.Table IIKinetic constants for wild-type and mutant hGH proteinsProteinKmVmaxμmnmol product min−1 μg−1 proteinWild type29.45 ± 6.062.49 ± 1.90C110AInactive 2-aLess than 0.05% wild-type hGH activity.H220AInactive 2-aLess than 0.05% wild-type hGH activity.E222A21.45 ± 4.570.41 ± 0.03H171N29.90 ± 3.400.012 ± 0.005Km and Vmax were determined using variable concentrations of 4-NH2-10-CH3PteGlu2as substrate and capillary electrophoresis to determine product (15Rhee M.S.

The results presented are the mean and S.D. of at least two protein preparations and three assays per preparation. The proposed molecular model predicted the catalytic triad based on homology with the GATase domain of eCPS. In agreement with our previous study of the four hGH cysteine residues in which Cys-110 was identified as essential for activity (16Chave K.J. Galivan J. Ryan T.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 551-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), expression of the C110A hGH mutant in an E. coli expression system using a construct with a HisTag attached to the N terminus produced inactive enzyme. Amino acid Cys-110 was confirmed as necessary for catalytic activity and predicted by homology to Cys-269 in eCPS to be the active site nucleophile that attacks the γ-carbonyl of the susceptible Glu-Glu bond in poly-γ-glutamate substrates to form a thioester intermediate. A similar mutation in eCPS produced protein that bound but did not hydrolyze glutamine (30Rubino S.D. Nyunoya H. Lusty C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11320-11327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The production of an inactive hGH mutant by mutating His-220 to alanine is consistent with the predicted role in the catalytic mechanism. The equivalent residue in eCPS (His-353) is suggested to have several roles: to activate the cysteine nucleophile, to protonate the leaving group, and to activate the water molecule that attacks the thioester intermediate (29Thoden J.B.

Rauchel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16158-16166Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Mutating His-353 to asparagine in eCPS produced an enzyme with greatly reduced activity, which still bound glutamine (31Miran S.G. Chang S.H. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7901-7907Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The same mutation in a mammalian CPS yielded a protein with a 164-fold lower kcat, a 4-fold higherKm, and an unmeasurably low rate of thioester formation (32Hewagama A. Guy H.I. Chaparian M. Evans D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1388: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The mutation of the equivalent histidine in the GATase domain of anthranilate synthase decreased both activity and sensitivity to 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine, suggesting that this histidine residue plays a role in the formation of the thioester intermediate (35Amuro N. Paluh J.L. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14844-14849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results presented here indicate that Glu-222 is not catalytically essential in hGH. When this residue was mutated to alanine there was a 6-fold reduction in Vmax, indicating that the E222A hGH mutant retains more activity than the equivalent mutant of eCPS. The thermal stability for the hGH E222A mutant protein was also decreased, and a lower yield of purified E222A was observed (results not shown). These observations are consistent with results obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of the putative third member of the catalytic triad of papain (36Vernet T. Tessier D.C. Chatellier J. Plouffe C. Lee T.S. Thomas D.Y. Storer A.C. Menard R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16645-16652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Mutation of this asparagine to glutamine and alanine reduced the kcat/Km3.4- and 150-fold, respectively. It was also found that these mutants had increased aggregation, proteolytic susceptibility, and decreased thermal stability, suggesting that this residue was also structurally important. The role of Glu-355 as a member of a catalytic triad in eCPS has recently been the subject of some debate. Glu-355 is conserved in all known GATase type I sequences and was proposed to be a member of the catalytic triad based on analogy to other hydrolyzing enzymes. The location of this conserved glutamate within hydrogen-bonding distance of His-353 in the crystal structures of eCPS (24Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and the equivalent histidine in E. coli GMP synthetase (25Tesmer J.J.G. Klem T.J. Deras M.L. Davisson V.J. Smith J.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 74-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) added strength to this hypothesis. Only recently has site-directed mutagenesis been performed to test this hypothesis. When this residue was mutated to glycine in mammalian CPS, an enzyme was generated that had an unalteredKm but 47-fold lower kcat(32Hewagama A. Guy H.I. Chaparian M. Evans D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1388: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and poor thioester formation. An E355A mutation in eCPS (33Huang X. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15909-15914Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) produced an enzyme with a 47-fold higher Km in glutamine-dependent reactions but an unalteredVmax. In p-aminobenzoate synthetase (37Roux B. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3763-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), a 35-fold increased Km, 4-fold decreasedVmax, and reduced thioester formation were observed after mutation of the equivalent glutamate residue. The retention of some activity when the active site glutamate was mutated to alanine argues against Glu-355 being absolutely essential for catalysis, but poor thioester formation suggests that it may have an indirect role in catalysis. The absolute conservation of this glutamate residue in GATase domains and also in GH proteins suggests a critical role for this residue. In hGH, Glu-222 may play more of a role in structural integrity than in catalysis. The model predicted that His-171 in hGH would function like His-312 in eCPS. His-312 in eCPS has been suggested to be involved in substrate binding but not catalysis (31Miran S.G. Chang S.H. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7901-7907Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Mutating His-171 in hGH to asparagine reduced enzyme activity. Asparagine was chosen as it is sterically conservative and may maintain some hydrogen-bonding patterns but cannot perform the acid/base reactions characteristic of the the imidazole ring. However, unlike the equivalent mutation in eCPS, Vmax and not Km was altered in hGH. This absence of a reduction in Kmsuggests that His-171 in hGH functions differently than His-312 in eCPS. The large reduction in Vmax for the H171N mutation implies some unknown role in the catalytic mechanism of hGH. The crystal structure of eCPS indicates that the imidazole ring of His-312 points away from the catalytic triad and is approximately 5 Å from the catalytic cysteine (24Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). His-312 was proposed to be involved in glutamine binding rather than catalysis based on biochemical analysis of an H312N mutant eCPS protein. This mutant had a 47-fold increase in the Km for the glutaminase reaction but an unaltered Vmax (31Miran S.G. Chang S.H. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7901-7907Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, in the crystal structure of the H353N eCPS mutant, where the thioester intermediate has been trapped (29Thoden J.B. Miran S.G. Phillips J.C. Howard A.J. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8825-8831Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), there are no apparent electrostatic interactions between His-312 and the substrate. Therefore, the role of this residue in substrate binding remains unknown. The hypothesis that the two enzymes use a similar catalytic mechanism is consistent with the similarity of the biochemical reactions catalyzed by hGH and the GATase domain of eCPS. It has previously been shown that the products of the hGH-catalyzed reaction on folypolyglutamates are glutamate or di-γ-glutamate (15Rhee M.S. Lindau-Shepard B. Chave K.J. Galivan J. Ryan T.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 1040-1046PubMed Google Scholar). The amide group hydrolyzed in the polyglutamate chain is the N-terminal of one glutamate linked to the γ-carbonyl of the preceding glutamate. The GATase domain of eCPS removes the γ-NH2 from glutamine to produce glutamate and ammonia (24Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 25Tesmer J.J.G. Klem T.J. Deras M.L. Davisson V.J. Smith J.L. Nat. Struct.

Rauchel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16158-16166Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The reaction proceeds by attack of the active site cysteine on the γ-carbonyl of glutamine to form a thioester intermediate and ammonia (24Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 29Thoden J.B. Miran S.G. Phillips J.C. Howard A.J. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M.

Huang X. Rauchel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16158-16166Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It can be envisioned that if the catalytic mechanism of eCPS is applied to hGH, the active site cysteine would attack the γ-carbonyl of the poly-γ-glutamate to form the thioester, and the γ-linked glutamate would be released. hGH has been shown to be inhibited by glutamine analogues such as azaserine and 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine (38Waltham M.C. Li W.W. Gritsman H. Tong W.P. Bertino J.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), also suggesting that the active site could be similar to the glutamine binding GATase domain of eCPS. These results indicate that hGH is a member of the cysteine peptidase family of enzymes with Cys-110 as the active site nucleophile and His-220 as the proton donor. The catalytic fold appears to be similar to that of the GATase type I domain, with His-171 having an essential but as yet undetermined role in enzyme activity. Ollis et al. (39Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar) identify the α/β hydrolase fold common to several hydrolytic enzymes with different catalytic function and phylogenetic function. The x-ray structure of GMP synthetase (25Tesmer J.J.G. Klem T.J. Deras M.L. Davisson V.J. Smith J.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 74-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) indicates that the GATase type I domain has a fold different than that of the α/β hydrolase fold. However, some of the elements of the α/β hydrolase fold are retained. For example, the “nucleophile elbow” is present. In this structural feature, the catalytic cysteine is the last amino acid of a β-sheet and the first of an α-helix, forcing it into an unusual orientation (39Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar). To maintain this structure, the amino acids +2 and −2 around the catalytic cysteine must be small (39Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar). In hGH residues 108 and 112 are both glycines. Therefore, hGH may also contain a nucleophile elbow. X-ray crystallography studies are under way to test this hypothesis and to determine the role of His-171. The results presented here define the active site fold and catalytic residues of hGH and should facilitate the design of high affinity inhibitors specific for GH to test whether inhibition of GH activity would lead to increased retention of folyl- and antifolylpolyglutamates within the cell.

A truncated splicing variant, iFer, was also cloned. iFer is devoid of both the tyrosine kinase domain and a functional SH2 domain but displays a unique 42-residue C terminus and retains the ability to form oligomers with Fer. Expression of both Fer and iFer proteins are strikingly increased upon differentiation of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts to adipocytes. Platelet-derived growth factor treatment of the cultured adipocytes caused rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of Fer and its recruitment to complexes containing platelet-derived growth factor receptor and the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase. Insulin treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes stimulated association of Fer with complexes containing tyrosine phosphorylated IRS-1 and PI 3-kinase but did not stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of Fer. PI 3-kinase activity in anti-Fer immunoprecipitates was also acutely activated by insulin treatment of cultured adipocytes. These data demonstrate the presence of Fer tyrosine kinase in insulin signaling complexes, suggesting a role of Fer in insulin action.

Rogers J.A. Peters K.L. Li J. Briggs S.D. Lionberger J.M. Cheng H. Shibata A. Scholtz B. Schreiner S. Dunham N. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1998; 9: 43-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The 94-kDa isoform of Fer and Fes share the same conserved domain organization, which consists of a long N-terminal domain, a central SH2 domain, and a C-terminal kinase domain. Contained within the N-terminal domain are three coiled-coil domains, which have been shown to be required for oligomerization and have been shown to trimerize in vivo (2Craig A.W. Zirngibl R. Greer P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19934-19942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 3Kim L. Wong T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4553-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The extreme N terminus of Fer also contains a Fes/CIP4 homology domain, which has also been found in proteins involved in regulating the actin cytoskeleton, and may function in microtubule binding (4Aspenstrom P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 479-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 5Tian L. Nelson D.L. Stewart D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7854-7861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Fer is ubiquitously expressed in a wide number of cell types and tissues (6Feldman R.A. Tam J.P. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 6: 1065-1073Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 7MacDonald I. Levy J. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2543-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Through both subcellular fractionation and immunocytochemistry, Fer has been shown to be localized to the cytoplasm and the nucleus (8Hao Q.L. Ferris D.K. White G. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1180-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although the cellular function of Fer is not known, its tyrosine phosphorylation has been shown in A431 and Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts following activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor or the PDGF1 receptor (3Kim L. Wong T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4553-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). PDGF stimulation also results in an increase in Fer tyrosine kinase activity. These results indicate that Fer may function in signaling by growth factor receptors. One potential role Fer may have in signaling is in the regulation of cellular adhesion complexes. It has been previously demonstrated that the N-terminal region of Fer is constitutively bound to a cell adhesion complex protein p120cas , which itself is tyrosine phosphorylated upon growth factor stimulation (3Kim L. Wong T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4553-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Fer also co-immunoprecipitates with β-catenin, another component of cell adhesion complexes. Overexpression of Fer in embryonic fibroblasts elevates tyrosine phosphorylation of both p120cas and β-catenin and decreases the amount of α-catenin and β-catenin that associates with E-cadherin. This indicates that Fer overexpression results in the dissolution of adheren junction complexes (9Rosato R. Veltmaat J.M. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5762-5770Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Recently the SH2 domain of Fer has been also shown to bind to the F-actin-binding protein cortactin. A dominant negative mutant in Fer inhibits the ability of macrophage colony stimulating factor to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin (10Kim L. Wong T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23542-23548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus it is possible that Fer may also link growth factor signaling to cytoskeletal elements. During a screen of SH2-binding proteins using a 3T3-F44A adipocyte expression library, we identified a large number of clones consisting of the C-terminal kinase domain of Fer. In these differentiated adipocyte cells, insulin has the unique ability to activate a number of metabolic pathways such as glucose uptake (11Czech M.P. Covera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1865-1868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). This led us to speculate that Fer might possibly also have a role in insulin signaling. In the present study we show that Fer expression increases upon 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation and that these cells express a splicing isoform that lacks most of the SH2 domain and all of the C-terminal kinase domain. We also show that insulin stimulation results in the formation of complexes between Fer with tyrosine phsophorylated IRS-1 and p85 phosphatidylinositol kinase. 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody and monoclonal p85 (N-SH2) antibody used for immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Rabbit polyclonal IRS-1 (SC559) and PDGF receptor antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mouse monoclonal antibody HA antibody (12CAS) was purchased from BABCO. Rabbit anti-HA antibody was raised against a peptide corresponding to the HA epitope and purified on protein A-Sepharose. Mouse monoclonal Myc antibody was obtained from cell culture supernatants of hybridoma cell line 10E2. Anti-Fer serum used for both immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting (FerN) was prepared by immunizing rabbits with a GST fusion protein that contain residues 224–467 of the Fer sequence. Anti-Fer serum used for immunoblotting (FerK) that is specific for kinase domain of Fer was provided kindly by Dr. Tony Pawson. Anti-iFer serum was prepared by immunizing rabbits with a peptide containing the last 15 C-terminal amino acids of iFer. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts (2–3 days post confluent) were differentiated into adipocytes by incubating with DMEM containing 25 mm glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 units/ml penicillin, 0.5 mmisobutylmethylxanthine, 0.25 μm dexamethasone, and 5 μg/ml insulin for 3 days and then grown in DMEM with 10% Fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin for an additional 5–8 days. COS-1 cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin. A λ-Zap mouse 3T3-F442A was screened for Grb2-binding proteins using the method described in Singh et al. (12Singh H. Clerc R.G. LeBowitz J.H. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 252-261PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 40,000 plaque forming units of this library were plated on to eighteen 15-cm LB plates in LB top agar and incubated for 3 h at 42 °C. Nitrocellulose filters that were soaked in 10 mmisopropylthio-β-d-galactoside were placed on the plates and incubated for an additional 10 h at 37 °C. Plates were cooled to 4 °C, after which filters were removed and washed three times in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmdithiothreitol) under constant agitation. Filters were then blocked with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% nonfat milk and washed several times in binding buffer. GST-Grb2 fusion protein was produced from a pGEX-2TK construction (13Cherniack A.D. Klarlund J.K. Conway B.R. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1485-1488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). GST-Grb2 fusion protein was 32P-labeled by incubating fusion protein bound to GST beads with approximately 25 units of protein kinase A (Sigma) and 1 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 100 μl of phosphorylation buffer (100 mm, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were then washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline. Labeled Grb2 fusion protein was removed from the beads with 500 μl of 100 mm reduced glutathione and then incubated with filters in binding buffer overnight at 4 °C. The next day, filters were washed with five changes of binding buffer, dried, and exposed to film. Positive plaques were then isolated and purified by further rounds of screening. Excisions of Bluescript phagemids were preformed according to the manufacturer's protocol and dideoxy sequenced on an ABI 377 automatic sequencer. A 3T3-F44A adipocyte clone library was screened with a 32P-labeled probe made against a fragment consisting of sequences between nucleotides 669 and 1397 of the mouse Fer coding sequence by random priming (14Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar). The library was plated out according to manufacturer's instructions, and plaques were transferred to Nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) for 2 min. Nitrocellulose circles were then denatured in 1.5m NaCl and 0.5 m NaOH for 5 min, neutralized in 1.5 m NaCl and 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 5 min, and then washed with 2× SSC for 2 min. DNA from plaques were fixed to nitrocellulose membranes for 2 h at 80 °C, and membranes were prehybridized in buffer 1 (50% formamide, 5× SSPE, 2% SDS, 10× Denhardt's solution, and 100 μg/ml boiled salmon sperm DNA) for 2 h at 42 °C. Denatured 32P-labeled probes were hybridized to filters in fresh buffer 1 (106 cpm/ml) overnight at 42 °C. Library filters were washed three times with 2× SSC and 0.05% SDS at room temperature for 5 min, one time in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 5 min, and three times with 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min. Membranes were exposed to X-Omat AR (Kodak) film overnight, and positive plaques were identified, isolated, and purified through further rounds of screening. Bluescript phagemids were excised according to manufacturer's instructions and dideoxy sequenced on an ABI 377 automatic sequencer. Six independent clones were isolated and were entirely sequenced. Three hemaglutinin epitopes were attached to the 5′ end of iFer and Fer by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the Kpn and SmaI sites of PCMV5. Myc-HA-Fer was constructed by adding a Myc epitope to the 5′ end of 3× HA Fer. On the day before transfections, COS-1 cells were seeded at 750,000 cells/100-mm plate and transfected with 5 μg of each construction using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Cells were lysed 48 h after transfection. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1 ml of cold lysis buffer (30 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml each leupeptin, aprotinin, and 1 mm benzamidine). Lysates were then clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were removed and assayed for total protein content using the Bradford method (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Supernatants were incubated on an end-over-end mixer with antibodies or preimmune serum overnight and then were sedimented with protein A-Sepharose for 2 h. The Sepharose was pelleted by centrifugation at 15000 × gfor 2 min at 4 °C. Pellets were washed five times with cold wash buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, and 1 mmNa3VO4), and SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to the pellet after the final wash. Samples were loaded on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to either nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes. Membranes were probed with antibodies and were visualized using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's specifications. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were lysed with the lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm NaF, 0.5 mmNa3PO4, 30 mm NaPPi, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin), and Fer was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C. with anti-Fer or preimmune serum. The next day protein A-Sepharose was added to each immunoprecipitate, incubated end-over-end for 2 h at 4 °C and pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed two times with wash buffer 1 (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 500 mm LiCl), one time with wash buffer 2 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA), and one time with reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, and 120 μm adenosine). Sepharose-bound immune complexes were then incubated for 10 min at 30 °C with 40 μl of reaction buffer with 100 μm phosphatidylinositol, 100 μmphosphatidylserine, and 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were quenched with HCl, and extracted with methanol:chloroform (1:1). Labeled phospholipids were spotted onto PE SIL G plates, and phosphatidylinositol monophosphates were separated by borate thin layer chromatography. Through screening a 3T3-F44A adipocyte expression library for proteins that bind to SH2 domain of Grb2, we isolated several clones consisting of the C-terminal portion of Fer including its tyrosine kinase. To determine which isoforms of Fer are expressed in this cell line, we screened this library with 32P-labeled DNA probes consisting of a portion of the Fer coding sequence. Six independent clones that hybridized to this probe were isolated. Four of these clones, which we designated as iFer, contained the entire Fer coding sequence except for a 65-base pair deletion within the region that encodes for the SH2 domain. This deleted region begins with the sequence GT, which is consistent with it being the beginning of an alternately spliced intron. The iFer splicing deletion results in a nonsense mutation which encodes a 60-kDa protein with a partial SH2 domain and a unique C-terminal region (Fig. 1). Both Fer and iFer were tagged with HA epitopes and expressed in COS-1 cells to determine whether they encode active kinases. Consistent with previously published results, Fig. 2 Ashows that overexpressed 94-kDa Fer in COS-1 cells is constitutively active and becomes autophosphorylated on tyrosine residues. The protein encoded by the iFer splicing variant lacks a functional tyrosine kinase domain but contains one of three major Fer tyrosine phosphorylation sites (2Craig A.W. Zirngibl R. Greer P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19934-19942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 2 A, iFer fails to get tyrosine phosphorylated when overexpressed in COS cells, indicating that a functional Fer kinase domain is required for this phosphorylation to occur. Because the N-terminal region of Fer contains the domain that is required for its oligomerization, we reasoned that iFer is still capable of forming complexes with Fer. To test this, we overexpressed HA-tagged iFer, along with Fer that is tagged with both the Myc and HA epitope, and immunoprecipitated Fer oligomers with anti-Myc antibodies. Fig. 2 B shows that iFer can co-immunoprecipitate with Fer. Furthermore co-expression of Fer and iFer also results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of iFer, which strongly implicates that its tyrosine phosphorylation site can be phosphorylated in trans by an active Fer kinase. Fer has been shown to be ubiquitously expressed in most tissues and cell lines that have been studied. To confirm that Fer is also expressed in differentiated adipocytes, total cell lysates from both 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes were separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF filters, and blotted with anti-Fer antibodies. As seen in Fig. 3 A, Fer is expressed in both adipocytes and preadipocytes, but its expression is induced approximately 5-fold by differentiation. To substantiate that iFer is also expressed in these cell lines, we raised antibodies to a peptide composed of the last 15 amino acids of the predicted iFer coding sequence. This sequence does not have any significant homology to any proteins currently deposited in nonredundant protein sequence data bases. Western blot analysis revealed a band of approximately 72 kDa that is expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes but not in fibroblast hybridizes to anti-iFer antiserum (Fig. 3 B). This band is not recognized by preimmune serum. The difference in the mobility of this band to that of the predicted molecular mass of iFer based on its sequence may be due to post-translational modifications, and insulin stimulation does not effect the mobility of this band on SDS-PAGE. In mouse Swiss 3T3 fibroblast cell lines, PDGF stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of Fer and complex formation of Fer with activated PDGF receptors (3Kim L. Wong T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4553-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Because 3T3-L1 adipocytes are highly responsive to PDGF stimulation, we were interested in ascertaining whether a similar response to this growth factor occurs in this cell type (16Isakoff S.J. Taha C. Rose E. Marcusohn J. Klip A. Skolnik E.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10247-10251Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To determine this, we stimulated serum-starved 3T3-L1 adipocytes with PDGF for 5 min and immunoprecipitated cell lysates with anti-Fer antibody. These complexes were separated on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-Fer and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Fig. 4shows that similar to Swiss 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, PDGF stimulation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes results in an increase of Fer tyrosine phosphorylation (top panel). Furthermore, Fer also co-immunoprecipitates with tyrosine phosphorylated PDGF receptor. PDGF stimulation also results in the recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to tyrosine phosphorylated PDGF receptor. Thus PDGF stimulation should produce PDGF receptor complexes containing Fer and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting of anti-Fer immunoprecipitates reveals that p85 does in fact bind to complexes containing Fer in a PDGF-dependent manner (Fig. 4, middle panel). Only a small amount of p85 binds to Fer in the absence of PDGF stimulation. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, many genes required for insulin signaling pathways, such as insulin receptor and GLUT-4, become highly expressed upon differentiation (17Reed B.C. Kaufmann S.H. Mackall J.C. Student A.K. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4876-4880Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 18Garcia de Herreros A. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol.

U A. 1994; 93: 10723-10728Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Because Fer is also highly expressed upon differentiation, we reasoned that it may also have a role in insulin signaling. To test this possibility, we stimulated serum-starved 3T3-L1 adipocytes with insulin for 5 min and immunoprecipitated lysates with anti-Fer antibody. Unlike PDGF stimulation of cultured adipocytes, insulin treatment results in little if any increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Fer (Fig. 5,middle panel). However, insulin stimulation does result in a marked increase in complex formation between Fer and tyrosine phosphorylated IRS-1. Similar to PDGF, insulin stimulation also promotes complex formation between Fer and p85 (Fig. 5, bottom panel). We also blotted these immunoprecipitates for the presence of Grb2, but we were unable to detect Grb2 (data not shown). This indicates that the original finding of Fer in a screen for proteins that bind to the Grb2 SH2 domain is probably due to the ability of the kinase domain of Fer to catalyze tyrosine phosphorylation of Grb2 binding positive plaques. The time course of the formation of Fer/IRS-1 and Fer/p85 complexes was determined by immunoprecipitating Fer from 3T3-L1 adipocytes stimulated with insulin for various times. Fig. 6 shows that within 30 s of insulin stimulation Fer is maximally bound to both tyrosine phosphorylated IRS-1 and p85. The binding of Fer to both these molecules is fully sustained 1 h after initial insulin stimulation. To determine whether active phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is associated with Fer, immunoprecipitates were assayed for their ability to label phosphatidylinositol with [γ-32P]ATP. As seen in Fig. 7, maximal phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is bound to Fer within 1 min of insulin receptor activation and is not diminished for at least 20 min. Little if any activity is found bound to Fer preimmune serum.Figure 7Insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity associated with anti-Fer immunoprecipitates. Lysates from serum-starved and insulin-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were immunoprecipitated with anti-Fer or preimmune serum.

In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we found a unique splicing variant, iFer, which displays a 65-base pair deletion in the Fer open reading frame. The finding that iFer deletion encodes a protein without a functional kinase indicates that the iFer protein probably has a role in regulating some aspect of Fer function. There are many examples in which alternative splicing of genes produce truncated regulatory forms of proteins. In one case, alternate splicing produces a 26-base pair deletion in the message for the growth hormone receptor that encodes a truncated protein that lacks most of its intracellular domain. This splicing variant produces a soluble circulating form of the growth hormone receptor, which regulates the ability of growth hormone to activate its cellular receptor (19Dastot F. Sobrier M.L. Duquesnoy P. Duriez B. Goossens M. Amselem S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U A. 1994; 93: 10723-10728Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar). More recently a truncated splicing variant of protein kinase C δ containing 83-base pair insertion variant was identified. Similar to iFer this splicing variant PKC δIII produces a protein that lacks a functional kinase domain, but retains the regulatory domain (20Ueyama T. Ren Y. Ohmori S. Sakai K. Tamaki N. Saito N. Biochem. Cell Biol. Commun. 2000; 269: 557-563Google Scholar). The role of this truncated protein in PKC regulation has yet to be determined. Because iFer retains N-terminal coiled-coil domains, one possible function of iFer could be to regulate Fer oligomerization and activation. It has been hypothesized that like receptor tyrosine kinases, oligomerization activates Fer through the trans-phosphorylation of subunits. In the case of Fes, incubation of wild type full-length Fes with isolated N-terminal domains does in fact suppress Fes autophosphorylation (21Read R.D. Lionberger J.M. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18498-18503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, in a different study, an N-terminal deletion mutant of Fer, which cannot oligomerize, was found to retain the ability to autophosphorylate itself. Furthermore, overexpression of the N-terminal region of Fer in COS-1 cells had no effect on Fer activity in in vitro kinase assays (2Craig A.W. Zirngibl R. Greer P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19934-19942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Here we show that in COS-1 cells, overexpressed iFer that immunoprecipitates with Fer is tyrosine phosphorylated. This result is consistent with iFer not regulating Fer kinase activity. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether these results reflect an actual biochemical difference between how Fes and Fer are activated or whether they actually reflect a difference because of the experimental design. Another possible function of iFer is to regulate the binding of Fer to other proteins. In initial experiments, we have been able to detect a small amount of iFer associated with both p85 and IRS-1 (data not shown), but this is probably due to an association with full-length Fer in these complexes, as opposed to a direct binding to either IRS-1 or p85. It might be possible that iFer regulates the binding of the N-terminal domain of Fer to the cellular adhesion protein p120cas , which could possibly prevent its tyrosine phosphorylation in response to growth factor stimulation. Further studies are needed to determine exactly what targets this Fer domain might bind in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The 94-kDa full-length isoform of Fer is a ubiquitously expressed protein and has been found in almost every cell line studied (6Feldman R.A. Tam J.P. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell.

However, there are other cases where Fer expression is increased. Fer has been shown to be absent in pre-B cells but accumulates upon their induction to antibody producing cells (22Halachmy S. Bern O. Schreiber L. Carmel M. Sharabi Y. Shoham J. Nir U. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2871-2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Fer expression has also shown to be enhanced in cell extracts from human prostate cancer cell lines (23Allard P. Zoubeidi A. Nguyen L.T. Tessier S. Tanguay S. Chevrette M. Aprikian A. Chevalier S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 159: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The increased expression in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells might indicate that Fer has a role in promoting adipogenesis. Alternatively, this might indicate that Fer has a role in regulating insulin signaling pathways in adipocytes. In the current work, we show that in 3T3-L1 adipocytes insulin, like PDGF, results in the association of Fer with tyrosine phosphorylated signaling complexes. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, PDGF results in the binding of Fer to PDGF receptors, whereas insulin activation results in complex formation between Fer and tyrosine phosphosphorylated IRS molecules. We also show that Fer binds to complexes containing phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. In the case of PDGF stimulation, it is likely that this complex formation is the result of the binding of both Fer and p85 SH2 domains to the same tyrosine phosphorylated PDGF receptors. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the SH2 domain of p85 binds directly to tyrosine phosphorylated Fer. Because there is little if any increase of Fer tyrosine phosphorylation in response to insulin, it seem unlikely insulin sensitive complex formation between Fer and p85 is the result of this sort of direct interaction. It is most likely that Fer binds to p85 through tyrosine phosphorylated adaptors such as IRS-1. We cannot rule out the possibility that Fer binds constitutively to IRS-1, because the amount of IRS-1 bound to Fer was below the sensitivity that we are able to detect on immunoblots probed with anti-IRS-1 antibodies (data not shown). It is also possible that Fer binds to p85 through other adaptor proteins that are tyrosine phosphorylated in response to insulin such as IRS-2. Although it is has been hypothesized that cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases such as Fer may have a role in insulin signaling, very little is actually known about their function (24Kanzaki M. Watson R.T. Artemyev N.O. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7167-7575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For example, insulin stimulation results in both the binding of the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Fyn to IRS-1 and c-Cbl and its dissociation from Sirm (25Sun X.J. Pons S. Asano T. Myers M.G. Glasheen E. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 271: 10583-10587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 26Ribon V. Saltiel A.R. Biochem.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6989-6997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Yet the significance of these associations has yet to be determined. Our data show that Fer might also have a role in insulin signaling. Although Fer is believed to be involved in cross-talk between PDGF receptors and cellular adhesion complexes, there appears to be differences between how Fer responds to PDGF and insulin stimulation. PDGF, unlike insulin, results in the increase of tyrosine phosphorylation of Fer. This suggests that PDGF but not insulin stimulation results in a increase of the catalytic activity of Fer kinase. Thus, although it is possible that Fer may be involved in both insulin and PDGF signaling, Fer might also mediate signaling pathways in 3T3-L1 adipocytes that are unique to PDGF. Further studies to determine the substrates of Fer in this cell type will help unravel these pathways. We thank Dr. Tony Pawson for providing us with anti-Fer antibody and Sarah Nicoloro for helpful discussions."

It is striking to note that both of these proteins behave as homotetramers, but one behaves as a more compact molecule than the other. These observations suggest that these two presumptive motors could cross-link microtubules into bundles with different spacing. Both motors localize to mitotic spindles, and antibody microinjection experiments suggest that they have mitotic functions. Thus, one of these kinesin-related proteins may cross-link spindle microtubules into loose bundles that are “tightened” by the other.

A classic model system for studying mitosis and cytokinesis is the early echinoderm embryo where MTs and MT-based motor proteins are thought to position mitotic centrosomes, centrosomes dictate the positioning of the spindle, and the spindle in turn positions the cleavage plane (1Rappaport R. Cytokinesis in Animal Cells. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1996: 1-386Google Scholar). Antibody microinjection experiments are useful for probing the functions of MT-motors in sea urchin embryonic cell division (2Scholey J.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 39: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar); previously, the microinjection of pan-kinesin antibodies suggested that some kinesin motors, but apparently not conventional kinesin or heterotrimeric kinesin II, play important roles in mitosis and cell division (3Wright B.D.

One of these motors is a 110-kDa polypeptide, KRP110, that reacts with an antibody, CHO1, to the mammalian mitotic motor, MKLP1 (3Wright B.D. Terasaki M. Scholey J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). MKLP1 is an anti-parallel MT-MT sliding motor that appears to be required for the organization of midzonal MTs and progression through mitosis and cytokinesis in several systems (7Adams R.R.

The mechanism of how MKLP1 family members might function to cross-link microtubules and bundle them into the anti-parallel arrays required for cytokinesis is still unclear, because the size and subunit composition of the native holoenzyme is unclear. The microinjection of the CHO1 antibody into sea urchin embryonic cells caused a prophase or metaphase arrest, suggesting that KRP110 is a functional homologue of MKLP1 and is required for mitosis and cell division in this system (3Wright B.D. Terasaki M. Scholey J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Work done in several systems suggests that interdigitating MTs in the spindle midzone are required to signal the proper progression of the contractile ring and completion of cytokinesis. However, in echinoderm cells, cleavage furrows can form, and subsequent cytokinesis can occur between two adjacent MT asters in the absence of such midzonal MTs (1Rappaport R. Cytokinesis in Animal Cells. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1996: 1-386Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that the MKLP1 homologue in echinoderm embryos, KRP110, may be localized to the MT asters rather than the central spindle (13Robinson D.N. Spudich J.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 228-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Another putative MT cross-linking motor that is also likely to participate in sea urchin embryonic mitosis is KRP170, a member of the phylogenetically diverse bipolar bimCkinesin subfamily. Bipolar bimC kinesins are homotetramers that move slowly toward the plus-end of MTs (14Cole D.G. Saxton W.M. Sheehan K.B. Scholey J.M. J. Biol.

It has been proposed that bipolar kinesins serve to push spindle poles apart by cross-linking and sliding MTs in relation to one another, and thus play important roles in the maintenance and elongation of bipolar mitotic spindles (18Sharp D.J.

Here, we report the molecular characterization of native KRP110 and KRP170, which reveals that they are homotetrameric members of the MKLP1 and bipolar bimC kinesin families, respectively. Localization and functional studies of KRP110 and KRP170 suggest that they both play important roles in mitotic cell division in sea urchin embryos. All chemicals used for studies described below were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Sea urchinsStrongylocentrotus purpuratus were collected at Point Arena, CA. Lytechinus variegatus and Lytechinus pictuswere obtained from Susan Decker and Marinus, Inc., respectively. To monitor the purification of KRP110 and KRP170, we used immunoblotting with (a) CHO1 IgM and a peptide antibody to detect KRP110; and (b) a rabbit polyclonal antibody to KRP170 (15Kashina A.S. Baskin R.J. Cole D.G. Wedaman K.P. Saxton W.M. Scholey J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and a mouse polyclonal antibody to the KRP170 stalk/tail to detect KRP170. Buffers used were as follows: (a) protease mixture (1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaN3, 20 μg/ml benzamidine, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mg/mlp-tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester); (b) PME (85 mm K2PIPES, 15 mm acid PIPES, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgSO4, 5 mm EGTA), pH 6.9; (c) PE (85 mmK2PIPES, 15 mm acid PIPES, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgSO4, 5 mm EGTA), pH 6.9; (d) PME + high salt (PME, 300 mm KCL), pH 6.9; (e) low salt PIPES for HiTrap SP (50 mm PIPES, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgSO4, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm KCl), pH 6.9; (f) high salt PIPES for HiTrap SP (50 mm PIPES, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgSO4, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 1.0 m KCl), pH 6.9; (g) sucrose gradient buffer (5 or 20% sucrose) in gel filtration buffer PME + high salt; 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm ATP, no other protease inhibitors, pH 6.9; (h) low salt PIPES for hydrodynamic data (PME, 150 mm KCl), pH 6.9. Sea urchin (S. purpuratus) unfertilized egg extracts and high-speed supernatant was prepared as described (20Buster D. Scholey J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 14: 109-115Crossref Google Scholar, 21Scholey J.M. Neighbors B. McIntosh J.R. Salmon E.D. J. Biol.

All steps were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise specified. Starting with 200 ml of sea urchin high-speed supernatant, GTP and taxol were added to a final concentration of 1 mm and 20 μm, respectively, to promote endogenous microtubule polymerization. 200 μl of 10 mg/ml cytochalasin D in Me2SO was added to inhibit actin polymerization. Then, AMPPNP was added to 1 mm final concentration, and the solution was stirred for an additional 20 min. The mixture was layered on top of a 15% sucrose cushion in PME buffer at a 5:1 ratio and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 1 h in a JA20 rotor. The MT pellets were washed with 15 ml of PE buffer and centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 30 min in a Ti50.2 rotor; the motors and MAPs were eluted from the MT pellets in 15 ml of PME buffer with 50 mm KCl and 10 mm MgATP on ice for 2 h, and the MT pellets were collected by centrifuging at 40,000 rpm for 30 min in a Ti50.2 rotor. A second elution using 15 ml of high salt buffer (PME plus 300 mm KCl and 10 mmMgATP) was performed on ice for 4 h, and the supernatant (high salt eluate) was collected after centrifuging at 40,000 rpm for 30 min in a Ti50.2 rotor. The high salt eluate was concentrated down to 3–5 ml (15-ml spin concentrator, 50-kDa cut off, Millipore) and loaded onto a Superose 6 FPLC gel filtration column (AK16/70, 100-ml bed volume, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The peak fractions of KRP170 and KRP110 were pooled separately and diluted 1:1:1 (v/v/v) with a low salt PIPES buffer and water and loaded onto a disposable 1-ml HiTrapSP column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 100–500 mm KCl in PME buffer over 30 min. Fractions containing either KRP110 or KRP170 were further concentrated to less than 200 μl using a Nanosep spin concentrator (0.5-ml, Omega membrane, 10-kDa cut off, Pall Filtron). The concentrated material was loaded onto 5-ml, 5–20% linear sucrose density gradients and centrifuged at 55,000 rpm for 9 h in a SW55 rotor. Alternatively, the gel filtration fractions containing KRP110 or KRP170 were concentrated to less than 2 ml, and exogenously polymerized bovine phosphocellulose-purified tubulin and 2 mm AMPPNP were added to promote the binding of KRPs to MTs. The bound material was pelleted by centrifugation and eluted differentially, first with 100 mm KCl and 10 mm MgATP in PME, then followed by 300 mm KCl and 10 mm MgATP in PME. The high salt eluate was loaded directly onto the sucrose density gradient and centrifuged as described above. To microsequence KRP110 and KRP170 peptides, samples of the purified proteins were excised from polyvinylidene membranes and digested with Endo-LysC followed by high pressure liquid chromatography purification. Digests were analyzed by MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight) mass spectroscopy, and selected peptides were sequenced using Edman degradation (16Kashina A.S. Scholey J.M. Leszyk J.D. Saxton W.M. Nature. 1996; 384: 225Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The Stokes radii of KRP170 and KRP110 were determined by gel filtration chromatography in the presence of either high salt or low salt PME buffers using a Superose 6 column calibrated with the following: ferritin (6.1 nm), thyroglobulin (8.5 nm), catalase (5.2 nm), aldolase (4.8 nm), myosin (19.9 nm), bovine serum albumin (3.5 nm), beta-amylase (5.4 nm), alcohol dehydrogenase (4.6 nm), carbonic anhydrase (2.0 nm), cytochrome c (1.7 nm), blue dextran (void), and ATP (included volume). The sedimentation coefficients of KRP170 and KRP110 were determined from 5–20% sucrose density gradients. Bovine serum albumin (4.3 S), aldolase (7.3 S), and catalase (11.3 S) were used as standards. The “low salt” data were obtained from cytosol in 150 mm KCl that was clarified (∼100,000 × g) and filtered prior to loading onto gel filtration columns or sucrose density gradients but was not further fractionated. The standards were run under both high and low salt conditions, and no significant difference was observed (with the exception of myosin that was only run in high salt for gel filtration to prevent the effects caused by filament formation, which occurs in low salt). The native molecular weights of KRP170and KRP110 were calculated (23Siegel L. Monty K. Biochim. Biolphys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar) using partial specific volumes of 0.713 for KRP170 and 0.717 for KRP110 (24Zamyatnin A.A. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1972; 24: 107-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). A partial cDNA fragment encoding residues 137–250 of KRP170 was obtained in a polymerase chain reaction screen (25Rogers G.C. Hart C.L. Wedaman K.P. Scholey J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and was used to screen a S. purpuratus cDNA library and thus to obtain two overlapping clones that encoded full-length KRP170. A polymerase chain reaction screen using degenerate primers based on conserved MKLP1 family sequences, namely, NHNMYVA and NKMVPY, yielded products that encoded amino acid residues 272–401 of KRP110. This region was subsequently used as a probe to screen out the rest of the 3′-end by conventional library screening. The 5′-end was identified by 5′-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends). The KRP110 tail peptide CTRGGGRAVQFTDVEK, obtained from microsequence data of KRP110 and incorporating an extra Cys forN-hydroxysuccinimide coupling, was synthesized (Stanford PAN Facility, Stanford University) and conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (26Field C.M. Oegema K. Zheng Y. Mitchison T.J. Walczak C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 298: 525-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Half of the material used as antigen was coupled by N-hydroxysuccinimide coupling and the other half using glutaraldehyde; then, they were mixed and injected into rabbits to produce antiserum according to standard protocols. GST170 stalk/tail recombinant protein was affinity-purified using glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography, diluted 1:1 with Titermax (CytRx Corp.), and injected into mice for ascites preparation. Antibodies against KRP170 stalk/tail region were affinity-purified on GST170 stalk/tail resin. Indirect confocal immunofluorescence of KRP110 and KRP170 was performed on methanol-fixed embryos stained with primary antibodies (25 μg/ml), followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:200 diluted) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Inc.) and DAPI (3Wright B.D. Terasaki M. Scholey J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Fertilized eggs were injected with ∼40 plicoliters of 7 mg/ml mouse polyclonal anti-KRP170stalk/tail antibodies, control mouse IgG at an identical concentration (<5% cell volume), affinity-purified dominant-negative fusion protein GST-KRP170 Coil4Tail, or GST at 57 μm in aspartate injection buffer; those that survived the injection process were monitored using differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy and filmed or photographed as described (5Morris R.L. Scholey J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of the two presumptive mitotic motors, KRP110 and KRP170, were deduced from the corresponding cDNA clones (GenBankTM accession numbers AF292394 and AF292395) and axnalyzed using standard procedures to generate maps shown in Fig.1, A and B. The cloned cDNAs are likely to encode the KRP110 and KRP170 polypeptides that are recognized by pan-kinesin antibodies and co-purify with sea urchin egg MTs based on antibody reactivity (Fig. 1 C). This idea was confirmed by a comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences with partial peptide sequences obtained from the corresponding MT-affinity-purified polypeptides (Fig. 1, A and B, and Fig. 2,D and E).Figure 2Partial purification of KRP110and KRP170. .

The 249-residue stalk contains a region (aa 550–693) that is predicted to form a 22-nm coiled-coil rod. There is an unusually high degree of sequence similarity (42–57% identity in the motor domain) to members of the MKLP1 family of kinesins, although KRP110 is unique in containing a proline-rich segment (aa 178–193) that may be a target for proline-directed protein kinase. The deduced sequence of KRP170 predicts a tripartite 122-kDa, 1081-amino acid residue polypeptide organized into motor (aa 1–348), stalk (aa 349–800), and tail (aa 801–1081) domains. The 451-residue stalk contains a region (aa 356–772) that is predicted to contain three coiled-coil segments that form a 62-nm long rod. There is an unusually high degree of sequence identity (50–72% identity) in the motor region and bimC box (aa 934–946) with members of the bipolar bimC family of kinesins. Anti-KRP110 and KRP170antibodies were used to probe for the presence of KRP110and KRP170 in subcellular fractions prepared from sea urchin egg cytosolic extract (Fig. 2). We observed that KRP110 and KRP170 co-sedimented with MTs in the presence and absence of AMPPNP or ATP (Fig.1 C). Both proteins were eluted from MT pellets by differential centrifugation in high ionic strength buffers and then subjected to gel filtration chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, or MT-affinity binding and sucrose density gradient centrifugation (Fig. 2, A–E). To investigate whether the high salt elution conditions might dissociate a loosely bound accessory protein, we also performed hydrodynamic experiments under low salt conditions on clarified and filtered cytosol that was not subjected to prior fractionation steps (Table I).Table IHydrodynamic properties of native KRP110 and KRP170HoloenzymeStokes radiusS valueEstimated native molecular massAxial ratioProposed compositionSchematicsnmSkDakDaKRP110 High salt11.59.8464<204 × 110 Low salt11.810.7510KRP170 High salt16.59.061060–804 × 170 Low salt19.68.8708 Open table in a new tab From the fractionation data, it was clear that KRP110 and KRP170 behaved as two separate monodisperse peaks under high salt conditions, indicative of two distinct holoenzymes (Fig.2 A and Table I). Both proteins appeared to lack accessory subunits (Fig. 2, B and C), as the only other polypeptides present in the KRP110- and KRP170-containing fractions were variable and highly substoichiometric to the major band (<0.1:1.0 mol/mol), with the exception of tubulin, which contaminated KRP170 following the MT-affinity purification step (Fig. 2 E). Based on the Stokes radius (R S) of 11 nm and a sedimentation coefficient of 9.8 S obtained under high salt conditions (Table I), we estimated that the KRP110 holoenzyme is a compact, asymmetric molecule with an axial ratio of <20 and a native molecular mass of 464 kDa, consistent with the hypothesis that KRP110 is a homotetramer of four identical 110-kDa subunits (Table I). However, under low salt conditions, there was a major peak of KRP110 for which the predicted molecular mass is somewhat higher (Table I). It is possible that this small difference in apparent molecular mass reflects variations due to experimental errors, but it is also consistent with the hypothesis that a 50-kDa polypeptide may associate with the holoenzyme under low salt, but not high salt, conditions. Based on a R S of 16 nm and sedimentation coefficient of 9.0 S, we estimated that the KRP170 holoenzyme is a homotetramer with a native molecular weight of 610 kDa and a high axial ratio of 60–80, indicative of an elongated asymmetric shape. Under low salt conditions, the estimated molecular mass is elevated somewhat, but both estimates are consistent with a homotetramer (predicted molecular mass = 680 kDa). KRP170 is thus likely to be a stable bipolar homotetramer like other members of the bipolar bimCkinesin family. The purification protocol was useful in providing enough pure material for protein microsequencing and for measuring the hydrodynamic properties of KRP110 and KRP170. Unfortunately, however, it has not so far proved feasible to obtain sufficient amounts of pure protein to examine the structure of either KRP110 or KRP170 by rotary shadow electronmicroscopy or to test their predicted ability to cross-link MTs into bundles. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that KRP110 and KRP170 are associated with sea urchin embryonic mitotic spindles. KRP110 displayed a somewhat punctate staining pattern (Fig.3, a–d). During prophase, KRP110 was concentrated in a broad band that circumscribes the nucleus (Fig. 3 a), and subsequently in metaphase it was concentrated throughout the entire mitotic apparatus (Fig.3 b). In unextracted anaphase cells, the protein was present in a broad band throughout the spindle interzone, between segregating sister chromatids (Fig. 3 c). Following detergent lysis of anaphase cells, the KRP110 antibody staining of the interzone region was greatly enhanced,and clear staining of spindle poles became evident (Fig. 3 c, inset). In the pre-extracted cells, the interzonal staining appeared to peak at the equatorial plane, which predicts the position of the future cleavage furrow. Faint but detectable punctate staining in the spindle asters was present in both extracted and unextracted anaphase spindles. During telophase, some KRP110 appeared to redistribute to the asters surrounding the reforming nuclei, but the staining of the spindle equator persisted as two intensely fluorescent bands located at the midbody (Fig. 3 d, arrow and inset). The anti-KRP170 antibody produced a fibrous, albeit punctate, staining pattern. During prophase, staining of the asters associated with separating centrosomes was observed (Fig.3 e). KRP170 appears to associate with both spindle fibers and spindle poles during metaphase (Fig. 3 f) and at this stage we observed clear, albeit faint, staining of apparent interzonal MT bundles that cross the metaphase plate, similar to those that were stained with anti-KLP61F antibody in Drosophilaembryos (18Sharp D.J. McDonald K.L. Brown H.M. Matthies H.J. Walczak C. Vale R.D. Mitchison T.J. Scholey J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 125-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The fibrous localization of KRP170 persisted through anaphase (Fig. 3 g), but during early telophase, anti-KRP170 produced punctate perinuclear staining with no specific staining of the midzone (Fig. 3 h). Previously, we showed that the microinjection of an anti-KRP110 antibody into one-cell sea urchin embryos leads to a prophase or metaphase arrest depending upon the time of injection (3Wright B.D. Terasaki M. Scholey J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The timing of the prophase arrest corresponds to a time when KRP110 displays a broad perinuclear distribution, whereas the metaphase arrest occurs just prior to the relocalization of KRP110 from the metaphase asters and half spindles to the spindle interzone (Fig. 3). In the present study, we used a similar approach to investigate the function of KRP170. When antibodies against the KRP170 stalk/tail region were injected into L. pictus blastomeres, 86% of the injected embryos were arrested in prophase at the one-cell or two-cell stage (n = 35) with swollen nuclei containing disc-shaped structures (Fig. 4 and TableII). This prophase arrest occurs at a time when KRP170 is associated with the prophase asters (Fig. 3 E), and the arrest persists for more than 8 h before the cell dies. During a time period corresponding to the arrest of the injected cell, control embryos divided to form normal multicellular blastulae (Fig. 4, top panels). Immunofluorescence microscopy of injected embryos revealed that MT arrays appeared to emanate from two or sometimes four foci, which may correspond to separated ectopic microtubule-organizing centers associated with each nucleus (Fig. 4, bottom right; TableIII). Curiously, we observed that approximately 14% of the anti-KRP170-injected blastomeres arrested in anaphase rather than prophase (Table II). In a complementary experiment, a dominant-negative fusion protein consisting of GST fused to the distal stalk/tail domains of KRP170(GST170Coil4Tail; Fig. 1 B) was also microinjected into sea urchin embryos and produced identical mitotic defects to those observed using antibody inhibition (Table II). Thus, although the inhibition of KRP110 activity appears to induce a prophase or metaphase arrest (3Wright B.D. Terasaki M. Scholey J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), a loss of function of KRP170appears to result in a prophase or anaphase arrest.Table IIMicroinjection of anti-KRP170 stalk/tail antibody or GST-KRP170Coil4Tail resulted in mitotic arrestInjected reagentDisplaying mitotic arrest%(n)Anti-KRP170stalk/tail antibody100(35) 2-aOf these cells, 22.9% arrested during prophase (1-cell stage), 62% during prophase (2-cell stage), and 14.3% during anaphase (1-cell stage).Non-specific mouse IgG0(12)K2.4 anti-kinesin II antibody0(3)GST-KRP170Coil4Tail100(5) 2-bOf these cells, 40% arrested during prophase (1-cell stage), 20% during prophase (2-cell stage), and 40% during anaphase (1-cell stage).GST0(2)Anti-KRP110(CHO1) 2-cFrom Wright et al.(3).100(107)2-a Of these cells, 22.9% arrested during prophase (1-cell stage), 62% during prophase (2-cell stage), and 14.3% during anaphase (1-cell stage).2-b Of these cells, 40% arrested during prophase (1-cell stage), 20% during prophase (2-cell stage), and 40% during anaphase (1-cell stage).2-c From Wright et al.(3Wright B.D.

Based on hydrodynamic data, KRP110 and KRP170are thought to be homotetramers, at least when partially purified by MT affinity binding and elution under high salt conditions. Because bipolar bimC kinesins from Drosophila and yeast are bipolar, with motor domains at opposite ends of a central rod (15Kashina A.S. Baskin R.J. Cole D.G. Wedaman K.P. Saxton W.M. Scholey J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar,17Gordon D.M. Roof D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28779-28786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), it is likely that KRP170 has a similar structure; hydrodynamic data obtained at both low and high ionic strength are consistent with this idea. Although our data are consistent with the notion that KRP110 consists of four 110-kDa polypeptides in the native protein complex, we cannot formally exclude the possibility that the native protein is a lower order multimer that contains undetected accessory polypeptides; but this seems unlikely in light of the fact that the contaminants detected in the preparations are variable and substoichiometric, and yet the protein behaves as a monodisperse peak during fractionation. Also, we cannot exclude the possibility that the difference in the predicted native molecular mass of KRP110 obtained under low salt conditions may be due to the presence of a small (50 kDa) accessory polypeptide that is dissociated from the complex under high salt conditions. Candidate associated polypeptides include Caenorhabditis elegansCyk-4 (28Jantsch-Plunger V. Gonczy P. Romano A. Schnabel H. Hamill D. Schnabel R. Hyman A.A. Glotzer M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1391-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) and polo kinase (7Adams R.R. Tavares A.A. Salzberg A. Bellen H.J. Glover D.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1483-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 27Lee K.S. Yuan Y.L. Kuriyama R. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7143-7151Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), which are implicated in MKLP1 function in other systems, where they also play a role in central spindle formation and cytokinesis. We speculate that KRP110 also has a bipolar organization, although further structural studies are needed to test this idea. A bipolar homotetrameric structure would allow both KRP110and KRP170 to bind MTs and cross-link them into bundles, but regardless of whether KRP110 is in fact bipolar, it is likely, based on hydrodynamic studies, to be a compact holoenzyme (axial ratio ≤ 20) with a coiled-coil rod that is only 22 nm long. KRP170 is predicted to be more elongated (axial ratio of 60–80) with an α-helical rod ∼62 nm in length; this would predict that KRP110 cross-links MTs into tighter, more-closely packed bundles than KRP170. Both KRP110 and KRP170 bind MTs in a nucleotide-insensitive fashion, but MT-cross-linking remains to be demonstrated. To test our hypothesis, it would be of interest to perform immunoelectronmicroscopic studies to visualize KRP110 and KRP170 cross-bridges within spindles. Such experiments are being initiated using the homologous proteins, PAV-KLP and KLP61F in Drosophila embryos, where we have already visualized KLP61F cross-bridges in situ(18Sharp D.J. McDonald K.L. Brown H.M. Matthies H.J. Walczak C. Vale R.D. Mitchison T.J. Scholey J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 125-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). An alternative hypothesis is that the bipolar structure of homotetrameric plus end-directed kinesins like KRP110 and KRP170 allows these motors to transport a cargo and localize it to the spindle interzone. Thus, rather than cross-linking and sliding anti-parallel MTs, these bipolar motors would move to the plus ends of MTs within MT bundles, concentrating in the region of overlap as a consequence of being “trapped” there (28Jantsch-Plunger V. Gonczy P. Romano A. Schnabel H. Hamill D. Schnabel R. Hyman A.A. Glotzer M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1391-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). This would allow bipolar kinesins to localize regulatory molecules like the polo kinase and Cyk-4 to the interzone. Further work would be needed to address this hypothesis. Our finding that sea urchin embryonic cells contain a member of the bipolar bimC kinesin subfamily, KRP170, which is homotetrameric and is required for progression through mitosis, is consistent with work done in several other systems (29Walczak C.E. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 943-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Our localization data are consistent with the hypothesis that KRP170 associates generally with spindle MTs, and inhibiting the function of KRP170 leads to mitotic arrest. These results are consistent with the model that KRP170 may cross-link MTs into relatively loose bundles and slide them apart during the assembly and elongation of the mitotic spindle, consistent with data from Drosophila that implicate KLP61F in bipolar spindle maintenance and elongation (19Sharp D.J. Brown H.M. Kwon M. Rogers G.C. Holland G. Scholey J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, KLP61F is sequestered in the nucleus during prophase and does not participate in the initial separation of the spindle poles, but only following nuclear envelope breakdown can KLP61F interact with MTs and exert forces that push apart the poles (18Sharp D.J. McDonald K.L. Brown H.M. Matthies H.J. Walczak C. Vale R.D. Mitchison T.J. Scholey J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 125-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 19Sharp D.J. Brown H.M. Kwon M. Rogers G.C. Holland G. Scholey J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Our data on sea urchin embryonic cells is consistent with the hypothesis that in this system, KRP170 associates with cytoplasmic MTs where it interacts with MTs to help push apart the centrosomes during initial spindle assembly and anaphase spindle elongation, so that inhibiting its function leads to prophase or anaphase arrest (6Rogers G.C. Chui K.K. Lee E.W. Wedaman K.P. Sharp D.J. Holland G. Morris R.L. Scholey J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 499-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Our characterization of KRP110 as a MKLP1 homologue that localizes to mitotic spindles extends our previous work showing that the microinjection of an antibody to mammalian MKLP1, CHO1, causes a mitotic arrest in sea urchin blastomeres (3Wright B.D. Terasaki M. Scholey J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The injected antibody arrested mitosis at one of two distinct points, namely prophase and metaphase, depending upon the time of injection. KRP110localizes to perinuclear regions during prophase and to spindles during metaphase, which are both regions of high MT density. In mammalian cells, Nislow et al. (30Nislow C. Sellitto C. Kuriyama R. McIntosh J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 511-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) saw a similar metaphase arrest; but no corresponding prophase arrest was seen, perhaps because MKLP1 is localized to metaphase spindles but is sequestered in the nucleus at prophase, where it cannot interact with MTs. Thus, we propose that KRP110 functions to cross-link MTs into tight bundles and that inhibiting this process leads to a prophase or a metaphase arrest by interfering directly with spindle mechanics, by activating spindle assembly checkpoints, or by interfering with the localization of regulatory components of the spindle. As in mammalian cells, the microinjection of the CHO1 antibody did not reveal any effects on later stages of mitosis or cytokinesis, suggesting that earlier mitotic defects may obscure any subsequent defects. However, the most striking localization pattern of KRP110 was a faint staining of the asters and an intense concentration in the spindle interzone and midbody during anaphase and telophase, respectively. In the interzone and midbody, the homotetrameric KRP110 motor could bind loosely organized, anti-parallel, midzonal MTs and cross-link them into the tight bundles that are thought to localize the components of the cleavage furrow and facilitate progression through cytokinesis (7Adams R.R. Tavares A.A. Salzberg A. Bellen H.J. Glover D.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1483-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 8Nislow C. Lombillo V.A. Kuriyama R. McIntosh J.R.

A role for KRP110 in the formation of tight midzonal MT bundles is consistent with the defects in midzonal MT organization seen in mammalian, Drosophila, and C. elegans cells when MKLP1 function is impaired. The low but detectable pool of KRP110 present in anaphase and telophase asters could be responsible for cross-linking anti-parallel MTs emanating from two adjacent asters, thereby signaling the formation of the cleavage furrow between the two asters in the absence of an associated central spindle (1Rappaport R. Cytokinesis in Animal Cells. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1996: 1-386Google Scholar). These data improve our understanding of the roles of MT-based motors in sea urchin embryonic mitotic cell divisions by suggesting that KRP110 and KRP170 are homotetramers that play important roles in mitosis. We hypothesize that the long KRP170 motors cross-link MTs into relatively loose bundles and slide them apart during centrosome separation, whereas the compact KRP110 motors organize MTs into more closely packed bundles that are required for progression through mitosis and completion of cytokinesis. In sea urchin embryos, as in other systems (19Sharp D.J. Brown H.M. Kwon M. Rogers G.C. Holland G. Scholey J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), multiple mitotic motors are likely to function in a coordinated fashion.

The fluorescence intensity of IAEDANS attached to the Cys374 residue of actin was smaller in filaments from ADP-actin than in filaments from ATP-actin monomers, which reflected a nucleotide-induced conformational difference in subdomain 1 of the monomer. Radial coordinate calculations revealed that this conformational difference did not modify the distance of Cys374 from the longitudinal filament axis. Temperature-dependent fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements between donor and acceptor molecules on Cys374 of neighboring actin protomers revealed that the inter-monomer flexibility of filaments assembled from ADP-actin monomers were substantially greater than the one of filaments from ATP-actin monomers. Flexibility was reduced by phalloidin in both types of filaments.

Flexibility was reduced by phalloidin in both types of filaments. fluorescence resonance energy transfer N-((iodoacetyl)amino(ethyl)-5-naphthylamine-1-sulfonate 5-(iodoacetamido)fluorescein sodium azide Actin is one of the most abundant proteins in biological systems and responsible for a number of cell functions in vivo (1Carlier M.-F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 12-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 2Reisler E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Two principal forms of actin exist in living cells, the monomeric and the filamentous. Actins biological function depends on the actual dynamic and conformational properties of the protein and on the dynamic equilibrium between the two principal forms (1Carlier M.-F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 12-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 2Reisler E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The polymerization of actin monomers with bound ATP is accompanied by the parallel hydrolysis of the nucleotide. However, the biological relevance of ATP hydrolysis by actin is still not well understood. Interestingly, ADP-monomeric actin also forms filaments (3Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), therefore, the presence of ATP and its hydrolysis are not essential for filament assembly. Previously, the hydrolysis of actin-bound ATP was assumed to play a key role in the steady-state treadmilling of actin filaments (4Wegner A. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 109: 139-150Google Scholar). Alternatively, Carlier (5Carlier M.-F. Adv. Biophys. 1990; 26: 51-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 6Carlier M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that ATP hydrolysis facilitated the rapid de-polymerization of actin. Recently, Janmey and colleagues (7Janmey P.A. Hvidt S. Oster G.F. Lamb J. Stossel T.P. Hartwig J.H. Nature. 1990; 347: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) provided evidence that actin filaments polymerized from ATP-actin monomers were significantly stiffer than the ones obtained from ADP-monomers. Considering that both types of filaments consist mainly of ADP-actin protomers, this observation was explained by the assumption that the ATP-actin monomers were conformationally trapped following the hydrolysis of ATP, and the energy released during the hydrolysis was stored as elastic energy (7Janmey P.A. Hvidt S. Oster G.F. Lamb J. Stossel T.P. Hartwig J.H. Nature. 1990; 347: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The authors proposed that this elastic energy could play an important role when the actin filament interacted with actin-binding proteins. Although this exciting observation was later supported by other laboratories, a number of experimental results were contradictory. The direct effect of ATP on actin filaments was confirmed and extended to phalloidin-labeled actin by fluorescence microscopy experiments (8Burlacu S. Janmey P.A. Borejdo J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: 569-577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three-dimensional reconstructions from electron micrographs revealed similar effects of the nucleotides on the flexibility of actin filament (9Orlova A. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 10Orlova A. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The results of phosphorescence spectroscopic experiments apparently also supported the conclusion of Janmey's group (7Janmey P.A. Hvidt S. Oster G.F. Lamb J. Stossel T.P. Hartwig J.H. Nature. 1990; 347: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). By measuring steady-state phosphorescence anisotropy these authors found that filaments prepared from actin monomers in the presence of ADP were more flexible than the ones obtained from ATP-monomers (11Rebello C.A. Ludescher R.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14529-14538Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). On the other hand, evidence provided from electron microscopy experiments and by measuring the dynamic elasticity and viscosity on actin solutions that filaments assembled from either ATP-actin or ADP-actin were indistinguishable (12Pollard T.D. Goldberg I. Schwarz W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20339-20345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rheometric studies on filament solutions reached a similar conclusion (13Newman J. Zaner K.S. Schick K.L. Gershman L.C. Selden L.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 1559-1566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Furthermore, fluorescence microscopy of individual rhodamine-labeled actin filaments revealed no difference between the persistence lengths of actin filaments (9 ± 0.5 μm) assembled from ATP-actin monomers or from ADP-actin monomers (14Isambert H. Venier P. Maggs A.C. Fattoum A. Kassab R. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11437-11444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the proper description of the effect of the monomer-bound nucleotide on the flexibility of generated filaments requires further investigations. None of the results cited above provided information regarding the nucleotide-dependent differences between the two forms of actin filaments with respect to molecular events occurring on a nanosecond time scale. Accordingly, the application of fluorescence spectroscopy seems to be reasonable for better understanding the biological importance of the nucleotide dependence of filament flexibility. A fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)1 method first described by Taylor et al. (15Taylor D.L. Reidler J. Spudich J.A. Stryer L. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 89: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) allows one to determine the radial coordinate (which is defined as the distance between the residue and the longitudinal filament axis) of a labeled side chain within the filament (Fig. 1 b). In earlier studies this method was applied to determine the radial coordinate of a number of labeled amino acids in the actin filament (15Taylor D.L. Reidler J. Spudich J.A. Stryer L. J.

FRET spectroscopy was also used to characterize the flexibility of the protein matrix between a donor and an acceptor molecule (23Somogyi B. Matko J. Papp S. Hevessy J. Welch G.R. Damjanovich S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3403-3411Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and to study the dynamic properties of the actin filament (24Nyitrai M. Hild G. Belagyi J. Somogyi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12996-123001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The spectroscopic results presented here revealed local conformational differences around the Cys374 residue of the actin protomer during the comparison of filaments polymerized from ATP- or ADP-actin monomers. Furthermore, the inter-monomer flexibility was found to be greater in filaments from ADP-monomers than in the ones from ATP-actin monomers. Interestingly, some of these properties of the actin filament were influenced by phalloidin, while others were unchanged in the presence of this toxic peptide, which suggested that the overall effect of phalloidin on the actin filament was complex. Relying on these spectroscopic results we propose that the conformational and dynamic differences resolved here might appear due to the presence of nucleotide-induced conformational changes in the actin monomer (25Gaszner B.

Fluorescence labeling was carried out in the same buffer. Cys374 of actin was labeled with the donor (IAEDANS) following polymerization as described earlier (28Miki M. dos Remedios C.G. Barden J.A.

The solution of actin filaments (approximately 46 μm) was incubated in the presence of 10-fold molar excess of IAEDANS at 25 °C for 1 h. Then the samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 2 h at 4 °C so that free fluorophores could be separated from the protein. Acceptor labeling of Cys374 was carried out in separate samples by incubating monomeric actin with 15-fold molar excess of IAF for 20–25 h at 4 °C. Following IAF labeling actin was polymerized by adding 2 mm MgCl2 and 100 mm KCl, and centrifuged in a way similar to the one used during IAEDANS labeling. In the case of either donor or acceptor labeling the actin pellets were incubated for 2 h in buffer A, homogenized, and resuspended in buffer A. Subsequently, the samples were dialyzed overnight against the same buffer. Actin concentration and labeling ratios were determined by measuring the absorption spectra of samples with a Shimadzu UV-2100 spectrophotometer. The following extinction coefficients were applied in the calculations: 1.11 mg ml−1 cm−1 at 280 nm or 0.63 mg ml−1 cm−1 at 290 nm (29Houk Jr., T.W. Ue K. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 62: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) for monomeric actin with a relative molecular mass of 42,300 Da (30Elzinga M. Collins J.H. Kuehl W.M. Adelstein R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 2687-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), 6,100 m−1 cm−1 at 336 nm for IAEDANS (31Hudson E.N. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4154-4161Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), and 77,000 m−1cm−1 at 496 nm for IAF (32Takashi R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5164-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) at pH 8.0. When required, the measured absorption data at 280 or 290 nm were corrected for the contribution of fluorescent labels. The labeling ratios were determined by calculating the ratio of fluorophore concentration to the actin concentration. Accordingly, the labeling ratios were 0.8–0.9 for IAEDANS and 0.7–0.8 for IAF. Prior to inter-monomer FRET experiments the solutions of unlabeled, donor-labeled, and acceptor-labeled monomers were mixed so that the desired concentrations of donor, acceptor, and actin would be adjusted. The Ca2+ bound by the actin monomers was replaced by Mg2+ in these samples by adding EGTA and MgCl2at final concentrations of 0.2 and 0.1 mm, respectively. The samples were incubated for 10–15 min at room temperature (33Strzelecka-Golaszewska H. Moraczewska J. Khaitlina S.Y. Mossakowska M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To obtain filaments from ATP-monomeric actin the samples were polymerized with 2 mm MgCl2 and 100 mm KCl (final concentrations) after the cation exchange. When filaments were designed to assemble from ADP-monomers, ATP was replaced by ADP in Mg2+-actin monomers prior to polymerization in a way described by Drewes and Faulstich (34Drewes G. Faulstich H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5508-5513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the nucleotide exchange procedure hexokinase, glucose, and ADP were added to actin monomer solutions at final concentrations of 1.65 mg/ml, 0.5 mg/ml, and 1 mm, respectively, and the samples were then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. To test the reliability of these exchange procedures, both the cation and the nucleotide exchanges were followed in control experiments by monitoring the kinetics of fluorescence emission of IAEDANS attached to the Cys374 residue of the actin monomer. During the preparation of filaments from ADP-actin monomers the polymerization was initiated similarly to the way described in the case of ATP-actin monomer polymerization after the nucleotide exchange procedure. The polymerization of ADP-actin is substantially slower than the one of ATP-actin (3Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Therefore, to assure complete filament assembly, both types of actin were polymerized for 12 h at room temperature. Furthermore, the fluorescence experiments were also carried out after the incubation of the actin filaments for 4 h at room temperature in the presence of equimolar concentration of phalloidin, a cyclic peptide. Phalloidin is known to stabilize actin filaments and to shift the monomer-filament equilibrium toward the filamentous form (35Dancker P. Löw I. Hasselbach W. Wieland T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 400: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The fluorescence experiments were carried out in samples containing 30 μm actin at pH 8.0. Fluorescence was measured with a PerkinElmer LS50B luminescence spectrofluorimeter. The excitation wavelength was 350 nm for the IAEDANS. Considering that the absorption of the samples was not negligible at the excitation and emission wavelengths the fluorescence spectra were corrected for the inner filter effect over the emission wavelength range by using the measured absorption spectra as follows, Fcorr(λ)=F(λ)antilog(ODex+ODem(λ))Equation 1 where Fcorr (λ) and F (λ) are the corrected and measured fluorescence intensities, respectively. ODex and ODem (λ) are the optical densities of the samples at the excitation wavelength and emission wavelengths, respectively. It should be noted that the optical densities were determined for the actual optical paths calculated from the geometric parameters of the applied cuvettes. In energy transfer experiments the donor emission was detected between 400 and 470 nm so that the contribution of acceptor fluorescence to the measured intensities could be excluded. The optical slits were set to 5 nm in both the excitation and emission paths. The efficiency of the FRET (E) is defined as follows,E=kt/(kt+kf+k0)Equation 2 where kt and kf are the rate constants of the fluorescence resonance energy transfer and the fluorescence transition, respectively, and ko is the sum of rate constants characteristic of all the other processes resulting in the de-excitation of the fluorophore. This transfer efficiency can be calculated from the under-curve areas of the donor fluorescence in the following way,E=1−(φDA/φD)Equation 3 where φDA and φD are the fluorescence quantum yields of the donor measured in the presence and in the absence of acceptor, respectively. The Förster's critical distance (R0) is defined as the donor-acceptor distance where the FRET efficiency is 0.5. In order to calculate the donor-acceptor distance (R) from transfer efficiency (E) the value of R0 needs to be obtained as follows,Ro6=(8.79×10−11)n−4κ2φDJEquation 4 where n is the refractive index of the medium, κ2 is the orientation factor, φD is the fluorescence quantum yield of the donor in the absence of acceptor, andJ is the overlap integral given inm−1 cm−1 nm4. In this study the refractive index (n) and the orientation factor (κ2) were taken to be 1.4 and 2/3, respectively. In the determination of the fluorescence quantum yield of the donor the fluorescence intensity was detected over a wide range of emission wavelengths (between 400 and 700 nm). In these experiments the quantum yield was calculated by comparing the emission of the donor to the one of a reference substance (quinine sulfate in 1 n NaOH). The fluorescence quantum yield of the reference was taken to be 0.53 under these experimental conditions (36Kouyama T. Kinosita Jr., K. Ikegami A. Biophys. J. 1985; 47: 43-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The overlap integral (J) is defined as follows,J=∫FD(λ)ɛA(λ)λ4dλ/∫FD(λ)dλEquation 5 where FD(λ) is the fluorescence emission spectrum of the donor and EA(λ) is the absorption spectrum of the acceptor. If the transfer efficiency (E) and Förster's critical distance (R0) are known the distance between the donor and acceptor molecules (R) for a single donor-single acceptor system can be calculated from the following equation.E=Ro6/(Ro6+R6)Equation 6 The mean value of the rate constant for the fluorescence resonance energy transfer, <kt>, is an appropriate parameter used to monitor local fluctuations of a macromolecule (23Somogyi B. Matko J. Papp S. Hevessy J. Welch G.R. Damjanovich S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3403-3411Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The normalized efficiency of FRET, f′, was introduced in a following way so that the value of <kt> could be approximated experimentally (23Somogyi B. Matko J. Papp S. Hevessy J. Welch G.R. Damjanovich S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3403-3411Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). f′=E/φDAEquation 7 It should be noted that in our present FRET experiments a single donor usually transferred energy to more than one acceptors. In such a complex system the measured normalized energy transfer parameter is the sum of the normalized energy transfer efficiencies that characterize the individual donor-acceptor systems (37Gennis R.B. Cantor C.R. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 2509-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, after appropriate spectral consideration (23Somogyi B. Matko J. Papp S. Hevessy J. Welch G.R. Damjanovich S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3403-3411Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar),f′=<kti/kf>=c<Ri−6κi2>Equation 8 where c is a constant involving the refractive index (n) and the overlap integral (J). The subscript “i” refers to the value of the given parameter for thei th population, taking a momentary picture, and the brackets (<>) denotes average values. In the analysis of the temperature dependence of FRET efficiency the presence of the donor molecules without a fluorescence energy transfer pair on neighboring protomers should also be considered due to the incomplete acceptor labeling (the acceptor labeling ratio was 0.66 in these experiments). If one takes into account the probability that a monomer is not labeled with an acceptor (0.34), the probability that none of the four closest monomers is acceptor labeled around a donor labeled monomer is only 0.013 (0.344). Accordingly, we considered the concentration of the donors, which did not have an acceptor pair, as negligible in the interpretation of fluorescence measurements. The fluorescence intensities used for the calculation of FRET parameters were routinely measured after heating the samples to appropriate temperatures. To exclude the effects of either a possible time dependence of the FRET parameters, or the presence of irreversible temperature-induced changes in the protein structure, control experiments were carried out. The fluorescence parameters were re-measured after overnight incubation of the samples at 4 °C, or by obtaining these parameters by cooling back the samples from the highest to the lowest temperature. Taking advantage of the helical symmetry of the actin filament, a method had been developed to determine the radial coordinate (Fig. 1 b) of a residue in the actin filament (15Taylor D.L. Reidler J. Spudich J.A. Stryer L. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 89: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In the present study, FRET experiments were carried out to determine the radial coordinate of Cys374 at 22 °C. In these experiments, Cys374 was labeled with either a donor or an acceptor molecule (Fig. 1 a) on different actin protomers. The solutions of labeled monomers were mixed so that the appropriate value of the donor and acceptor concentrations would be adjusted. After polymerization, the radial coordinate can be determined from the dependence of the measured FRET efficiency on the acceptor molar ratio. In such an analysis it is assumed that the polymerization of monomers forming long actin filaments is random. It has been shown that polymerization of actin monomers into filaments was random in the presence of phalloidin (20Moens P.D.J. Yee D.J. dos Remedios C.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12108-13102Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). An arrangement can be defined by considering five actin monomers as a donor in the central monomer and m acceptors on neighboring monomers (where m can take integer values from 0 to 4). The permutation of the m acceptors on the four neighboring monomers does differentiate between arrangements. Accordingly, under the geometric conditions applied here, 16 arrangements can be considered. Assuming an acceptor molar ratio of γ, the probability of an arrangement with m acceptor can be calculated as follows.pm=γ m(1−γ) (4−m)Equation 9 At a given acceptor molar ratio (γ) the total efficiency of the transfer (E) can be taken as a weighted sum of the individual efficiencies,E=Σm(pmEm)Equation 10 where Em is the transfer efficiency characteristic of the m th arrangement. During the calculation of this parameter it should be taken into account that a single donor could potentially transfer energy to more than one acceptors. In this case Equation 6 transforms to (37Gennis R.B. Cantor C.R. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 2509-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 38Bay Z. Pearlstein R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1963; 50: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar),E=Σn(Ro/Rn) 6/{1+Σn(Ro/Rn) 6}Equation 11 where Rn denotes the appropriate individual donor-acceptor distances. The individual distances (Rn) between the donor (n = 0) and adjacent acceptors (n = −2, −1, 1, or 2, see Fig. 1 a) should be calculated so that the value of assembled transfer efficiency can be obtained. In this calculation the geometric parameters of the actin filament need to be considered. In this study the half-pitch of the genetic helix was taken to be 27.5 Å, and the relative rotation of actin monomers along this helix was assumed to be 166o (Fig. 1, b and c). In these calculations it was also assumed that the efficiency of transfer occurring between the donor and acceptors located in more distant monomers was negligible. Accordingly, if we have a radial coordinate ofr, the individual distances (Rn) can be calculated as follows (15Taylor D.L. Reidler J. Spudich J.A. Stryer L. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 89: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).Rn={r2(1−cos(n×1660)) 2+r2sin2(n×1660)+(n×27.5) 2)} 1/2Equation 12 Using these equations an algorithm was constructed to fit the simulated data to the experimental results. In these fitting procedures the only free parameter is the radial coordinate, which allows the determination of its value. The fitting algorithm was written in MATLAB 5.2 (MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA). Previous reports provided evidence that the fluorescence emission of IAEDANS (attached to the Cys374 residue) was an appropriate parameter to follow Ca2+-Mg2+ (39Frieden C. Lieberman D. Gilbert H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8991-8993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or ATP-ADP (25Gaszner B. Nyitrai M. Hartvig N. Koszegi T. Somogyi B. Belagyi J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12885-12892Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) exchange in actin monomers. Accordingly, in this study the kinetics of fluorescence intensity of IAEDANS was monitored in monomeric actin samples (Fig. 2) during the exchange procedures in control experiments. The results obtained in these measurements were in good agreement with the ones published earlier (25Gaszner B. Nyitrai M. Hartvig N. Koszegi T. Somogyi B. Belagyi J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12885-12892Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 39Frieden C. Lieberman D. Gilbert H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8991-8993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which indicated that both the cation and nucleotide exchanges were appropriately completed during the sample preparation. On the other hand, according to these results the first, relatively fast conformational change in the actin monomer, which occur simultaneously with the nucleotide exchange (25Gaszner B. Nyitrai M. Hartvig N. Koszegi T. Somogyi B. Belagyi J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12885-12892Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) was already complete by the time when polymerization was initiated (Fig. 2). The fluorescence intensity of IAEDANS was measured in actin filaments as well. This intensity was greater in actin filaments polymerized from ATP-actin monomers than in filaments from ADP-actin monomers (Fig. 3). The spectra of the latter type of filaments were red-shifted as compared with that of the former ones (Fig. 3). In the presence of acceptor (IAF) the fluorescence of the donor (IAEDANS) was decreased due to the presence of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (Fig. 3). FRET efficiency was measured as a function of acceptor molar ratio so that the radial coordinate of Cys374 would be determined. The tendency of FRET efficiency of filaments from ATP- and ADP-actin monomers was different (Fig. 4). On the other hand, in the presence of phalloidin the FRET efficiencies were identical within the limits of experimental error with the ones measured in its absence in the case of both types of actin filaments (inset in Fig. 4). The independence of FRET efficiencies from the presence of phalloidin indicates that the contribution of nonrandom monomer assembly to the measured FRET parameters can be excluded (20Moens P.D.J. Yee D.J. dos Remedios C.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12108-13102Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The radial coordinates were determined from the experimental data by using the mathematical treatment described earlier (15Taylor D.L. Reidler J. Spudich J.A. Stryer L. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 89: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and a fitting algorithm written in MatLab 5.2. To carry out these calculations it was necessary to determine the Förster's critical distance (R0) for the IAEDANS-IAF pair in both types of filaments (Equation 4). This parameter was determined to be 47.74 and 40.83 Å for filaments from ATP- or ADP-actin monomers, respectively. According to these data, the radial coordinate of Cys374 was found to be 17.3 ± 1.1 Å in filaments from ATP-actin monomers and 16.7 ± 1.4 Å in filaments assembled from ADP-actin monomers. These results are in good agreement with the radial coordinate range of 12–23 Å, which was published recently for the Cys374 (20Moens P.D.J. Yee D.J. dos Remedios C.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12108-13102Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The inter-monomer flexibility of actin filaments was characterized by measuring the temperature profile of the normalized FRET efficiency,f′. In the case of actin filaments obtained from ATP-actin monomers the increase of f′ was relatively small (20%) between 6 and 34 °C (Fig. 5). When the filaments were polymerized from ADP-actin monomers, however, f′ increased progressively over the same temperature rang"

TXAS and prostaglandin I2synthase (PGIS), respectively, convert the same substrate, prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), to thromboxane A2 and prostaglandin I2, which have opposite biological functions. Our topology studies have indicated that the N-terminal region of TXAS has a longer N-terminal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane anchor region compared with the same segment proposed for PGIS.

A synthetic peptide corresponding to the N-terminal membrane anchor domain (residues 1–35) of TXAS, which adopted a stable helical structure and exhibited a membrane anchor function in the membrane-bound environment, was used to interact with a stable PGH2 analog, U44069.

TXA2 produced from PGH2 by TXAS has been implicated in various pathophysiological conditions as a proaggregative and vasoconstricting mediator (9Needleman P. Turk J. Jackschik B.A. Morrison A.R.

Prostaglandins and the Cardiovascular System. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1982: 15-58Google Scholar). PGH2 is also converted to PGI2 (prostacyclin) by PGIS. PGI2 is the main AA metabolite in the vascular wall and has opposing biological properties to TXA2, representing the most potent endogenous inhibitor of platelet aggregation (11Bunting S. Gryglewski R. Moncada S. Vane J.R. Prostaglandins. 1976; 12: 8897-8913Crossref Scopus (763) Google Scholar). PGI2 is also a strong anti-hypertensive agent through its vasodilatory effect on vascular beds. PGIS is mainly present in vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells (12Moncada S. Herman A.G. Higgs E.A. Vane J.R. Thromb. Res. 1977; 11: 323-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 13Weksler B.B. Ley C.W. Jaffe E.A. J. Clin.

As PGI2 and TXA2 play important roles in physiological and pathological actions, both PGIS and TXAS and the receptors of PGI2 and TXA2 have become important targets for pharmacological intervention. Studies of the structure/function relationship of PGIS and TXAS are important to increase our understanding of the physiological and pathological controls of PGI2 and TXA2 production and their roles in cardiovascular diseases. The studies of the biosynthetic mechanism of PGI2 and TXA2 formation performed by Hecker and Ullrich (16Hecker M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 141-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using stable PGH2analogs, U44069 and U46619 with modification of the endoperoxide oxygen atom at the C-9 or C-11 position of PGH2 (Fig. 1), suggested that the C-9 endoperoxide oxygen of PGH2 is likely to interact with the heme ferric iron of TXAS molecule. In contrast, the C-11 endoperoxide oxygen of PGH2 interacts with the heme ferric iron of PGIS (16Hecker M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 141-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). So far, little experimental evidence is available to understand how TXAS and PGIS recognize the same substrate, PGH2, differently. But the stable binding of U44069 and U46619 to TXAS and PGIS active sites provided a way to characterize the specific recognition of the two synthases for the common substrate PGH2. Results from our TXAS and PGIS N-terminal membrane anchor peptide studies using CD, two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, peptide antibodies, and peptidoliposome reconstitution indicate that PGIS is similar to conventional P450s in having only one membrane anchor segment in the N-terminal anchor domain, compared with the longer membrane anchor segment proposed for the TXAS N-terminal anchor domain (7Ruan K.H.

The differences in their interactions with the ER membrane may have an important impact on their initial interaction with their common substrate, PGH2, which must cross the membrane from the luminal side to the cytoplasmic side of the ER into their active sites that are just above the N-terminal membrane anchor domains (7Ruan K.H.

In addition, we have identified that a synthetic peptide corresponding to the first 35 residues of TXAS is able to form a stable helical structure and is incorporated into the lipid membrane in DPC micelles or liposomes (8Ruan K.H.

In this paper we directly determine the interaction of the N-terminal peptide with a PGH2 analog,U44069, in a membrane-mimicking environment using high resolution two-dimensional NMR techniques. Three-dimensional structure of U44069in DPC micelles was determined, and its conformational change induced by the N-terminal membrane anchor domain of TXAS was identified. In addition, a solution structure of the unstable substrate, PGH2, was simulated using a combination of the solution structural information of U44069 and U46619. DPC-d38, trifluoroethanol-d3(TFE-d3), and D2O were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). U44069 and U46619were from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor). Trifluoroacetic acid was obtained from Millipore (Bedford, MA), and trifluoroethanol (TFE) was obtained from Sigma. A peptide corresponding to TXAS N-terminal 35 residues (TXASLP1) was synthesized manually using fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-polyamide solid phase methods (20Merrifield R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 2149-2154Crossref Scopus (6680) Google Scholar, 21Merrifield R.B. Vizili L.D. Borman H.G. Biochemistry. 1982; 22: 1970-1974Google Scholar, 22Ruan K.H. Stiles B.G. Atassi M.Z. Biochem.

After cleavage with trifluoroacetic acid, the peptides were purified to homogeneity by HPLC on a Vydac C4 reversed phase column with a gradient of 0–80% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Molecular weights of the purified peptides were determined by mass spectrometry (23Moore W.T. Caprioli R.M. Villafranca J.J. Techniques in Protein Chemistry II. Academic Press, New York1991: 511-528Google Scholar). The HPLC-purified peptides U44069and U46619 were dissolved in water and lyophilized three times to remove completely trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile and were then dissolved in 0.02 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. The samples were lyophilized and rehydrated at a final concentration of 5 mm in H2O containing 10% D2O or 225 mm DPC-d38. Proton NMR experiments were carried out on a Bruker AMX-600 spectrometer with five different molecule mixtures as follows: U44069 alone (in H2O or in DPC-d38), U46619 alone (in H2O), TXASLP1 alone (in DPC-d38), and TXASLP1 andU44069 mixture (in DPC-d38). All two-dimensional experiments (TOCSY and NOESY) were performed under identical conditions with temperature at 298 K and pH 6.0. NOESY spectrum was recorded with mixing time of 300 ms. TOCSY spectrum was carried out with MLEV-16 mixing sequence with total mixing time of 50 ms. All spectra were composed of 2048 complex points in the F2 dimension and 512 real points in the F1 dimension with 32–128 scans pert1 increment. Quadrature detection was achieved in F1 by the time proportional phase increment method. The NMR data were processed using Felix 97 (Molecular Simulation, Inc., San Diego, CA). All free induction decays were zero-filled to 2K × 2K before Fourier transformation, and a 0–30° (for TOCSY) or 90° (for NOESY) shifted sine bell window function was used in both dimensions. Complete 1H NMR spectrum assignments were obtained using standard methods and Felix assigned strategy (24Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids.

The overall structures of theU46619 and U44069 with or without TXASLP1 peptide in H2O or DPC-d38 were determined through the use of the interproton and sequential NOEs from the NOESY spectrum. The NOE cross-peaks were first assigned, and the volumes were then calculated. Felix 97 program was used for converting the volumes into upper bonds of the interproton distances as the NOE constraints, which were used for the structure calculations. The energy refinement calculations including restrained energy minimization/dynamics were carried out in the best distance geometry structures using Discover programs within the Insight II package (Molecular Simulation, Inc., San Diego, CA). Two-dimensional NMR spectra, NOESY (Fig. 2) and TOCSY (data not shown), of the two PGH2 analogs, U44069 andU46619, were recorded in H2O with 10% acetonitrile-d3. The proton resonance assignments for the PGH2 analogs were accomplished using the standard sequential assignment technique based on the proton chemical shifts (24Wüthrich K.

The major different assignments for U44069 and U46619 were at the positions of H9 and H11 protons in both NOESY spectra due to the structural difference of the two molecules for the position of oxygen (Fig. 2). The complete proton resonance assignments for the U44069 and U46619 were summarized in Table I. The identification of interproton NOE cross-peaks allowed further construction of three-dimensional structures of the analogs and showed the detailed structural differences of the two analogs in solution.Figure 2The expanded region of NOESY spectra of U46619 (A) and U44069 (B) in H2O.

Those NOE constraints were then used for the structural calculation on the basis of the initial structures created by the Biopolymer program within the Insight II package. 20 NOE constraints (Fig. 2 B) from the NOESY spectrum for U44069 and 23 NOE constraints (Fig. 2 A) for the U46619, which include two inter-side chain NOEs (H6/H18 and H14/H4), were obtained and used as distance restraints for the structural calculations that agree with the data using the Insight II program. The calculation includes energy minimization that was carried out using NOE constraints, and the distance range and force were set to 0.1 Å and 800, respectively. The three-dimensional structural models of two PGH2 analogs were constructed, energy-minimized, and then used to run dynamics that provide the simulation of the motion of atoms at temperature of 300 K (room temperature) and a force of 80. After 2000 iterations, 11 three-dimensional structural models of two PGH2 analogs have been built (Fig. 3, A andB). In addition, the average conformations of two analogs were superimposed for the comparison (Fig. 3 C). The structural differences observed were the little turn of the head part conformations of the analogs, and the oxygen position was at C-9 inU44069 and at C-11 in U46619. The hairpin structures of both analogs remain almost the same.Table IINOEs constraints used for the structural calculationsIn H2OIn DPCU44069U46619U44069U44069+ TXASLP1DistanceDistanceDistanceDistanceÅÅÅÅH9/H64.50H14/H113.7491HC/H112.561HC/H83.53H13/H152.58H9/H64.500H4/H51.862HC/H83.64H13/H114.05H5/H33.642HC/H112.511HC/H112.56H13/H103.17H14/H183.36H14/H122.45H4/H51.86H13/H83.55H14/H173.71H13/H82.722HC/H112.51H14/H183.83H15/H183.09H13/H152.51H14/H122.45H14/H164.06H2/H32.57H9/H114.08H13/H82.72H14/H122.77H9/H103.82H14/H113.86H13/H152.51H14/H114.34H7/H62.96H14/H183.16H9/H114.08H8/H62.77H5/H43.10H13/H10b3.21H14/H113.86H15/H182.98H14/H122.81H14/H163.75H14/H183.16H9/H74.48H13/H122.81H9/2HC3.97H13/H10b3.12H2/H32.57H13/H81.95H13/H113.64H14/H163.75H4/H32.74H6/H81.95H9/1HC3.81H9/2HC3.97H9/H103.92H15/H163.67H13/H122.991HC/H73.43H8/H92.24H11/H103.61H6/H185.511HC/H10b3.97H15/H163.31H11/H123.74H14/H44.892HC/H43.21H14/H153.99H14/H152.29H13/H113.64H6/H183.83H9/H82.55H9/1HC3.81H14/H43.40H12/H84.111HC/H10a4.02H4/H32.69H13/H122.99H6/H183.36H6/H185.71H14/H43.10H14/H43.15H15/H114.62For all proton definitions see Fig. 1.

In this case the initial docking conformations of the hydrophobic PGH2 analogs must be in the membrane environment. To mimic the membrane environment, two-dimensional NMR spectra, NOESY (Fig. 4) and TOCSY (data not shown), of theU44069 were recorded in a membrane-mimicking environment using deuterated DPC micelles which is a membrane mimetic reagent with a structure accepted to resemble that of membrane phospholipid. The complete assignment of proton resonances of U44069 (Fig. 4) was made using the same strategy for the spectra recorded in H2O solution (Fig. 2 B). 17 NOE constraints including two inter-side chain NOEs (Table II) from the NOESY spectrum that were calculated as described above were used as distance constraints for three-dimensional structural calculation using Felix and Insight II program package. Fig. 7 A shows the overlay of 11 three-dimensional structures obtained from the structural calculations for U44069 in DPC micelles. This PGH2 analog in the membrane-mimicking environment adopts similar conformation compared with that of the analog in solution (Fig. 5).Figure 7Eleven three-dimensional structures of U44069 in the absence (A) and presence (B) of the TXASLP1 were obtained by dynamic studies using the corresponding cross-peak constraints from NOESY spectra (Fig. 6).

The two-dimensional NMR spectrum was also performed for the peptide itself. The assignment of proton resonances of U44069 in the presence of peptide was made by comparison with the assignment of the analog or the peptide itself. Several cross-peaks (1HC/H8,2HC/H8, 2HC/H4, and H15/H11) from the U44069structures appeared in NOESY spectrum of the mixture of U44069 and the peptide but were absent from the NOESY spectrum of U44069 or the peptide alone under the same conditions (Fig. 6). This indicates that the conformational change of U44069 resulted from the interaction with the peptide. By constructing the three-dimensional structure of U44069using the method described above, detail conformational change upon the interaction with the TXAS membrane anchor domain can be identified. 24 NOE constraints including the two inter-side chain NOEs (Table II) obtained from NOESY spectrum of U44069 and peptide mixture were used as distance restraints, and the structure calculation was carried out within the Discover program of Insight II package. Three-dimensional conformation of U44069 with the interaction of the peptide was then created under the membrane-mimicking environment (Fig. 7 B). To show the differences between the structure of U44069 with the peptide and without the peptide constructed above (Fig. 7 A), the two models were superimposed (Fig. 7 C). The hairpin structure of U44069alone was widely opened with a distance of 8.25 Å away. After the interaction with the peptide, the hairpin structure of U44069 became closer with a distance change from 8.25 to 4.93 Å. By comparison of the NOESY spectra of U44069 in the presence and absence of the TXAS peptide, and the peptide alone, a cross-peak only appeared in the NOESY spectrum of U44069 in the presence of the peptide was identified (Fig. 8). The D1 (first dimension of the two-dimensional NMR experiment) position of the cross-peak belonged to H9 of U44069 (Fig. 8). Through complete assignments of the two-dimensional NMR spectra, TOCSY, NOESY, and DQF-COSY of the TXAS N-terminal peptide (the data will be published separately), the D2 (second dimension of the two-dimensional NMR experiment) position of the cross-peak is identified as Val-16 of the peptide (Fig. 8).

The topology models developed for PGIS and TXAS have their catalytic domains on the cytoplasmic site of the ER, opposite the orientation for PGHS in respect to the ER membrane. The substrate channels of all three enzymes opened at or near the ER membrane surface. This suggests that the coordination between PGHS and PGIS or TXAS in the biosynthesis of TXA2 and PGI2 may be affected by the anchoring of the enzyme in the lipid membrane. Results from our molecular modeling, site-specific antibody, and peptidoliposomal studies for TXAS, PGIS, and P450 2C1 have also indicated that the overall models predict the opening of the substrate access channels of PGIS and TXAS are immediately adjacent to the N-terminal membrane anchor domains and near the membrane surface. 2S.-P. So, D. Li, and K.-H. Ruan, unpublished data. This arrangement is consistent with the crystallographic identification of substrate recognition/docking sites in the N-terminal domains of P450BM3 and P450ter (32Peterson J.A. Graham-Lorence S.E. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995: 151-198Crossref Google Scholar). These results led us to hypothesize that the N-terminal membrane anchor domains of PGIS and TXAS may have substrate recognition/docking sites, which facilitate or guide substrate-efficient access to the active sites. This hypothesis is supported from our current preliminary experiments in which the replacement of the N-terminal region of TXAS with the corresponding anchor segment from PGIS resulted in a significantly lower rate of TXA2 production using 30 and 60 s of incubation compared with the wild type of TXAS.2 The aim of this work is to characterize the interaction of the N-terminal membrane anchor domain of TXAS with its substrate in the membrane-bound environment. A way to evaluate the potential actions of the membrane anchor domain in facilitating the delivery of its substrate to its active site channel is to identify the substrate conformational changes induced by the membrane anchor domain. Our previous CD experiments (17Lin Y.Z. Wu K.K. Ruan K.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 352: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and NMR (18Ruan K.H. Li D.W. Ji J. Lin Y.Z. Gao X.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 822-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) spectroscopic studies have found that the N-terminal membrane anchor domain of TXAS could adopt a stable helical conformation and incorporate it into phospholipid in DPC micelles, a membrane-bound environment, which suggest that the membrane anchor domain is likely able to mimic that portion of the protein function. This finding provided a basis for investigation of the interaction between the membrane anchor domain and the substrate in the membrane-mimicking environment. Due to the instability of TXAS substrate, PGH2 in solution, two PGH2 analogs, U44069 and U46619, with stable structures were used to replace PGH2 for the interaction. The conformation of U44069 changed by the presence of the membrane anchor domain of TXAS in DPC micelles (Fig. 7) provided evidence of the interaction between the TXAS domain and the PGH2 analog. Specifically, the change of the hairpin distance of U44069 from 8.25 to 4.93 Å (Fig. 7 C) suggested that the membrane anchor domain may play an important role in facilitation or guiding of its substrate to the active site channel of TXAS by reducing the three-dimensional size of PGH2, which allows the docking into the active site with lower energy. The interaction between U44069 and TXASLP1 was determined by the extra peak found in the NOESY spectrum of U44069 in the presence of the peptide (Fig. 8 C). This further suggested that the TXAS N-terminal membrane anchor segment is involved for the initial substrate recognition. The overall structures of U44069 and U46619 (Fig. 1) are identical to PGH2 except for one endoperoxide oxygen that was replaced with carbon at C-11 and C-9, respectively (Fig. 1). The three-dimensional structures of U44069 and U46619 determined provided complemented structural information for the modified endoperoxide of PGH2. The C-9 endoperoxide structural information is available from the structure of U44069, and the C-11 endoperoxide structure is provided from U46619. Combination of the solution structures of U44069 and U46619 provided full three-dimensional solution structural information for PGH2, which is difficult to characterize for its solution structure due to its instability in solution. The initial structure of PGH2 was first built using the Biopolymer program with the endoperoxide at C-9 and C-11. Due to the endoperoxide of U44069 at C-9, the constraints ofU44069 from the NOESY spectrum of proton distance from H1 to H10 (7 constraints) were used. As the position of endoperoxide is at C-11 forU46619, the constraints of proton distance from H8 to H2O were extracted from the NOESY spectrum of U46619 (11 constraints). A total of 18 constraints were used together for the structural calculation and the energy minimization, and dynamic studies were carried out using the Discover program within the Insight II package as described above. The constructed three-dimensional solution model of PGH2 was shown in Fig. 9. The simulated solution structure of PGH2 can be used as an initial structure for further structural characterization of the interaction between the synthases and PGH2. PGH2 is a common substrate for eicosanoid-synthesized enzymes including PGI2, PGE2, PGD2, and TXA2 synthases. Identification of the interaction between the N-terminal membrane anchor domain of TXAS with PGH2 analog implies the presence of the substrate interaction sites in the N-terminal membrane anchor domains of PGI2, PGE2, and PGD2 synthases. Characterization and comparison of the interactions of the different synthases with the common substrate is highly attractive for the future studies of understanding the mechanism of the biosynthesis of individual eicosanoid. Determination of solution structures of U44069 and U46619 also provides a basis to characterize the interaction of TXA2 and its receptor in structural terms because they are agonists for TXA2 receptor. By using the U44069 and U46619 conformation as basis, detailed studies for identification of the ligand-receptor interactions are under investigation in my laboratory.

Support was provided by the Robert A. Welch Foundation Grant E-1270 and the W. M. Keck Center for Computational Biology for computer resource support."
