https://openalex.org/W2747182905,"Nitrification, the oxidation of ammonia (NH3) via nitrite (NO2-) to nitrate (NO3-), is a key process of the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle. For decades, ammonia and nitrite oxidation were thought to be separately catalysed by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA), and by nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB). The recent discovery of complete ammonia oxidizers (comammox) in the NOB genus Nitrospira, which alone convert ammonia to nitrate, raised questions about the ecological niches in which comammox Nitrospira successfully compete with canonical nitrifiers. Here we isolate a pure culture of a comammox bacterium, Nitrospira inopinata, and show that it is adapted to slow growth in oligotrophic and dynamic habitats on the basis of a high affinity for ammonia, low maximum rate of ammonia oxidation, high growth yield compared to canonical nitrifiers, and genomic potential for alternative metabolisms. The nitrification kinetics of four AOA from soil and hot springs were determined for comparison. Their surprisingly poor substrate affinities and lower growth yields reveal that, in contrast to earlier assumptions, AOA are not necessarily the most competitive ammonia oxidizers present in strongly oligotrophic environments and that N. inopinata has the highest substrate affinity of all analysed ammonia oxidizer isolates except the marine AOA Nitrosopumilus maritimus SCM1 (ref. 3). These results suggest a role for comammox organisms in nitrification under oligotrophic and dynamic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2748258095,"Antiskyrmions, in which the magnetization rotates both as a transverse helix and as a cycloid, are found in acentric tetragonal Heusler compounds over a wide range of temperatures. Skyrmions, topologically stable, vortex-like spin textures, are of great interest for the development of a new generation of magnetic devices, in which they could carry or store information while remaining robust against disturbances. So far, only two types of skyrmion have been observed experimentally, the Bloch skyrmion and the Néel skyrmion, but Stuart Parkin and colleagues have now observed another type to join the family: the antiskyrmion. These are observed in a type of magnetic material called a centric tetragonal Heusler compound, which has unusual crystal symmetry. An antiskyrmion lattice state appears when magnetic fields are applied along the tetragonal axis, over a wide temperature interval. Because antiskyrmions break the cylindrical symmetry and carry a quadrupolar moment, their properties may differ from those of Bloch and Néel skyrmions and so they offer new opportunities for control. Magnetic skyrmions are topologically stable, vortex-like objects surrounded by chiral boundaries that separate a region of reversed magnetization from the surrounding magnetized material1,2,3. They are closely related to nanoscopic chiral magnetic domain walls, which could be used as memory and logic elements for conventional and neuromorphic computing applications that go beyond Moore’s law. Of particular interest is ‘racetrack memory’, which is composed of vertical magnetic nanowires, each accommodating of the order of 100 domain walls, and that shows promise as a solid state, non-volatile memory with exceptional capacity and performance4,5. Its performance is derived from the very high speeds (up to one kilometre per second) at which chiral domain walls can be moved with nanosecond current pulses in synthetic antiferromagnet racetracks. Because skyrmions are essentially composed of a pair of chiral domain walls closed in on themselves, but are, in principle, more stable to perturbations than the component domain walls themselves, they are attractive for use in spintronic applications, notably racetrack memory. Stabilization of skyrmions has generally been achieved in systems with broken inversion symmetry, in which the asymmetric Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction modifies the uniform magnetic state to a swirling state6,7. Depending on the crystal symmetry, two distinct types of skyrmions have been observed experimentally, namely, Bloch7,8 and Néel skyrmions9. Here we present the experimental manifestation of another type of skyrmion—the magnetic antiskyrmion—in acentric tetragonal Heusler compounds with D2d crystal symmetry. Antiskyrmions are characterized by boundary walls that have alternating Bloch and Néel type as one traces around the boundary. A spiral magnetic ground-state, which propagates in the tetragonal basal plane, is transformed into an antiskyrmion lattice state under magnetic fields applied along the tetragonal axis over a wide range of temperatures. Direct imaging by Lorentz transmission electron microscopy shows field-stabilized antiskyrmion lattices and isolated antiskyrmions from 100 kelvin to well beyond room temperature, and zero-field metastable antiskyrmions at low temperatures. These results enlarge the family of magnetic skyrmions and pave the way to the engineering of complex bespoke designed skyrmionic structures."

https://openalex.org/W2748864067,"Nuclear small RNA pathways safeguard genome integrity by establishing transcription-repressing heterochromatin at transposable elements. This inevitably also targets the transposon-rich source loci of the small RNAs themselves. How small RNA source loci are efficiently transcribed while transposon promoters are potently silenced is not understood. Here we show that, in Drosophila, transcription of PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) clusters-small RNA source loci in animal gonads-is enforced through RNA polymerase II pre-initiation complex formation within repressive heterochromatin. This is accomplished through Moonshiner, a paralogue of a basal transcription factor IIA (TFIIA) subunit, which is recruited to piRNA clusters via the heterochromatin protein-1 variant Rhino. Moonshiner triggers transcription initiation within piRNA clusters by recruiting the TATA-box binding protein (TBP)-related factor TRF2, an animal TFIID core variant. Thus, transcription of heterochromatic small RNA source loci relies on direct recruitment of the core transcriptional machinery to DNA via histone marks rather than sequence motifs, a concept that we argue is a recurring theme in evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2747407286,"Defective mitophagy linked to dysfunction in the proteins Parkin and PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) is implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Although the mechanism by which Parkin mediates mitophagy in a PINK1-dependent manner is becoming clearer, the triggers for this mitophagy pathway remain elusive. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been suggested as such triggers, but this proposal remains controversial because ROS scavengers fail to retard mitophagy. Here we demonstrate that the role of ROS in mitophagy has been underappreciated as a result of the inefficiency of ROS scavengers to control ROS bursts after high-dose treatment with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone. Supporting this, combinatorial treatment with N-acetyl-l-cysteine and catalase substantially inhibited the ROS upsurge and PINK1-dependent Parkin translocation to mitochondria in response to carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone treatment. In addition to the chemical mitophagy inducer, overexpression of voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) induced Parkin translocation to mitochondria, presumably by stimulating ROS generation. Similarly, combined N-acetyl-l-cysteine and catalase treatment also suppressed VDAC1-induced redistribution of Parkin. Alongside these observations, we also found that the elevated protein level of PINK1 was not necessary for Parkin translocation to mitochondria. Thus, our data suggest that ROS may act as a trigger for the induction of Parkin/PINK1-dependent mitophagy. In addition, our study casts doubt on the importance of protein quantity of PINK1 in the recruitment of Parkin to mitochondria.

Accumulating evidence from studies of mutations in familial PD-related genes, including Parkin and PINK1, has revealed that dysfunctions in mitochondrial quality control contribute to the pathogenesis of PD (1Rugarli E.I.

Upon mitochondrial depolarization, PINK1 selectively accumulates on the damaged mitochondria and undergoes autophosphorylation at Ser-228 and Ser-402 (7Okatsu K. Oka T. Iguchi M. Imamura K. Kosako H.

Subsequently, activated Parkin translocates to mitochondria, where it physically associates with mitochondrial substrates such as VDAC1 (13Sun Y. Vashisht A.A. Tchieu J. Wohlschlegel J.A. Dreier L.

When anchored to mitochondria, Parkin mediates global polyubiquitination of the outer mitochondrial membrane proteins, triggering convergence of the autophagic machinery with mitochondria to ensure proper execution of mitophagy (15Chan N.C.

Parkinson's disease carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone dihydroethidium N-acetyl-l-cysteine blue fluorescent protein. Notwithstanding advances in the knowledge of this area, there are concerns regarding the existing model of Parkin/PINK1-dependent mitophagy. In particular, our understanding of the triggers of such mitophagy makes it difficult to reconcile this model with the physiological scenario (18Whitworth A.J. Pallanck L.J. PINK1/Parkin mitophagy and neurodegeneration: what do we really know in vivo?.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2017; 44: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). For example, chemically induced mitochondrial depolarization has popularly been utilized to trigger Parkin/PINK1-dependent mitophagy. However, the commonly used mitophagy inducer, i.e. the protonophore CCCP, is usually applied at high concentrations, which disrupts mitochondrial potential to an extent beyond physiological relevance (19McWilliams T.G. Muqit M.M. PINK1 and Parkin: emerging themes in mitochondrial homeostasis.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2017; 45: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 20Grenier K. McLelland G.L. Fon E.A. Parkin- and PINK1-dependent mitophagy in neurons: will the real pathway please stand up?.Front. Neurol. 2013; 4: 100Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the mitochondrial matrix was shown to promote mitophagy (21Jin S.M. Youle R.J. The accumulation of misfolded proteins in the mitochondrial matrix is sensed by PINK1 to induce PARK2/Parkin-mediated mitophagy of polarized mitochondria.Autophagy. 2013; 9: 1750-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), but its role in PD or neurodegeneration is not unequivocal (22Pellegrino M.W. Haynes C.M. Mitophagy and the mitochondrial unfolded protein response in neurodegeneration and bacterial infection.BMC Biol. 2015; 13: 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Of note, ROS are promising candidates of the physiological triggers for mitophagy, as ROS naturally exist in cells and have been linked to the pathogenesis of PD because of their detrimental effects on lipids, proteins, and DNA (23Zhou C. Huang Y. Przedborski S. Oxidative stress in Parkinson's disease: a mechanism of pathogenic and therapeutic significance.Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2008; 1147: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Moreover, mitochondrial DNA defects caused by ROS may result in the presence of faulty proteins in the electron transport chain, which boosts ROS generation and mitochondrial DNA impairment, creating a vicious cycle (24Wallace D.C. Mitochondrial DNA mutations in disease and aging.Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 2010; 51: 440-450PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable that the mitophagy machinery may sense the excessive mitochondrial damage caused by ROS and subsequently eliminate impaired mitochondria beyond repair. However, several independent groups reported the failure of ROS scavengers to suppress CCCP-induced Parkin recruitment in HeLa cells (2Narendra D. Tanaka A. Suen D.F. Youle R.J.

Genet. 2012; 21: 4888-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), challenging the establishment of ROS as a trigger for mitophagy. To clarify the role of ROS in Parkin/PINK1-dependent mitophagy, Parkin translocation to mitochondria was utilized in this study as an indicator for the initiation of mitophagy. ROS status was closely monitored in CCCP-treated or VDAC1-overexpressing cells in the presence or absence of ROS scavenger(s). We show that ROS, induced by CCCP treatment or VDAC1 overexpression, play an essential role in the recruitment of Parkin to mitochondria. In addition, we reveal that an elevated protein level of PINK1 is not necessary for translocation of Parkin to mitochondria. Thus, our study contributes to the understanding of the role of ROS and PINK1 in mitophagy. The results from previous studies using CCCP treatment and ROS scavengers indicated a dispensable role of ROS in Parkin/PINK1-dependent mitophagy (2Narendra D. Tanaka A. Suen D.F. Youle R.J.

ROS-dependent regulation of Parkin and DJ-1 localization during oxidative stress in neurons.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2012; 21: 4888-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Here we revisited the current model of mitophagy induced by CCCP treatment, notwithstanding that the protonophore CCCP may produce other effects that complicate mitophagy (27Padman B.S. Bach M. Lucarelli G. Prescott M. Ramm G. The protonophore CCCP interferes with lysosomal degradation of autophagic cargo in yeast and mammalian cells.Autophagy. 2013; 9: 1862-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 28Berezhnov A.V.

Chem. 2016; 291: 8701-8708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). First we examined the mitochondrial potential and ROS levels in HeLa cells in response to CCCP stress using the fluorescent dyes JC-1 and dihydroethidium (DHE), respectively. As expected, treatment with 10 μm CCCP led to mitochondrial depolarization in a time-dependent manner. CCCP treatment significantly disrupted mitochondrial potential 30 min after it was added to the cells and reached its maximal effects at 1 h (Fig. 1, A–C). In addition, the effects of CCCP treatment on mitochondrial potential were dose-dependent. Treatment of cells with a low concentration (2.5 μm) of CCCP enhanced mitochondrial potential, whereas CCCP treatment at concentrations higher than 5 μm depolarized mitochondria. Mitochondrial depolarization became more severe with increasing concentrations of CCCP beyond 5 μm (Fig. 1D). Similarly, treatment of cells with 10 μm CCCP led to an increase in ROS level with time (Fig. 1, E–G). Low-dose CCCP treatment (2.5 μm) mildly decreased ROS production, whereas CCCP treatment at concentrations higher than 5 μm boosted ROS generation, and this effect was amplified with increasing concentrations of CCCP (Fig. 1H). Given our findings that CCCP treatment led to a ROS burst in the cells, we then asked whether ROS scavengers could quench CCCP-stimulated ROS efficiently and affect CCCP-induced Parkin recruitment to mitochondria. Consistent with previous studies, neither NAC nor catalase treatment alone suppressed Parkin translocation to mitochondria (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). This has been interpreted previously as evidence to support that ROS play an insignificant role in CCCP-induced Parkin recruitment (2Narendra D. Tanaka A. Suen D.F. Youle R.J. Parkin is recruited selectively to impaired mitochondria and promotes their autophagy.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 795-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (2842) Google Scholar, 25Ding W.X. Ni H.M. Li M. Liao Y. Chen X. Stolz D.B. Dorn 2nd, G.W. Yin X.M. Nix is critical to two distinct phases of mitophagy, reactive oxygen species-mediated autophagy induction and Parkin-ubiquitin-p62-mediated mitochondrial priming.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 27879-27890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). However, the efficacy of these scavengers to control ROS production induced by CCCP treatment was unknown. Therefore, we examined the ROS status of HeLa cells exposed to both CCCP and ROS scavengers. First, we examined whether catalase added to cells did ablate the intracellular ROS spike using flow cytometry. Indeed, catalase treatment substantially reduced 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein intensity in the cells in response to Earle's balanced salt solution treatment, which does not contain pro-oxidant, indicating that catalase treatment can attenuate endogenous ROS production (supplemental Fig. S2). A total concentration of 1000 units/ml of catalase quenched ROS generation induced by 10 μm CCCP at the first 30 min, but this effect gradually diminished beyond 30 min (Fig. 1I). In contrast, 2 mm NAC treatment suppressed ROS production induced by 10 μm CCCP from 1 h after the drug was added but failed to do so at 30 min (Fig. 1J). These data indicate that failure of the ROS scavengers to inhibit CCCP-induced Parkin translocation to mitochondria may be due to their inability to extinguish CCCP-induced ROS generation at appropriate time points. Based on our findings that the ROS scavengers did not inhibit CCCP-induced ROS production completely, we reconsidered the role of ROS in the recruitment of Parkin. 2 mm NAC treatment failed to impede 10 μm CCCP-induced Parkin translocation to mitochondria (supplemental Fig. S1). However, as demonstrated above, 2 mm NAC was also insufficient to quench 10 μm CCCP-induced ROS at 30 min (Fig. 1J). Because 7.5 μm CCCP triggered substantially less ROS production than 10 μm CCCP (Fig. 1H), we examined Parkin recruitment induced by 7.5 μm CCCP and the effect of 2 mm NAC under this condition. At this concentration, CCCP treatment induced Parkin translocation to mitochondria in ∼90% of the cells (Fig. 2, A and B). However, in the presence of 2 mm NAC, co-localization of Parkin and mitochondria could only been seen in ∼40% of cells, indicating significant attenuation of CCCP-induced Parkin translocation (Fig. 2B). Similarly, our earlier time course experiments demonstrated that suppression of 10 μm CCCP-induced ROS using 2 mm NAC did not occur until after 30 min. Therefore, we checked ROS levels after 30-min incubation of cells with 7.5 μm CCCP and 2 mm NAC. Our result showed that 2 mm NAC reduced 7.5 μm CCCP induced-ROS production to a similar level as that in the NAC-treated cells (Fig. 2C). Moreover, depolarization of mitochondria was not significantly affected (supplemental Fig. S3A). In addition, treatment of cells with 10 mm NAC suppressed Parkin translocation to mitochondria induced by 10 μm CCCP (supplemental Fig. S4). However, 10 mm NAC failed to inhibit 20 μm CCCP-induced Parkin translocation to mitochondria (supplemental Fig. S4), which is consistent with a previous report (25Ding W.X. Ni H.M. Li M. Liao Y. Chen X. Stolz D.B. Dorn 2nd, G.W. Yin X.M. Nix is critical to two distinct phases of mitophagy, reactive oxygen species-mediated autophagy induction and Parkin-ubiquitin-p62-mediated mitochondrial priming.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 27879-27890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). These data suggest a dose-dependent effect of NAC treatment on Parkin translocation to mitochondria induced by CCCP treatment. The earlier time course experiments also showed that catalase treatment efficiently suppressed ROS production during the first 30 min (Fig. 1I), but not beyond this time, whereas NAC treatment had an opposite effect (Fig. 1J). Therefore, we asked how the combination of NAC and catalase would affect Parkin recruitment and whether they could act in synergy to attenuate the burst of ROS production stimulated by CCCP treatment. Indeed, we found that combinatorial treatment with 2 mm NAC and 1000 units/ml catalase almost completely blocked 10 μm CCCP-induced Parkin accumulation on mitochondria (Fig. 2, D and E). Furthermore, the same combinatorial treatment quenched ROS production stimulated by treatment with 10 μm CCCP (Fig. 2F) and inhibited removal of mitochondria after the cells were exposed to CCCP treatment for 24 h (supplemental Fig. S5). However, we also noted that this combinatorial treatment affected mitochondrial potential in the presence or absence of CCCP treatment (supplemental Fig. S3B). In addition, to determine whether CCCP treatment induces Parkin translocation to mitochondria by altering the bioenergetics of the cells, an ATP assay was performed 2 h or 24 h after cells were exposed to CCCP treatment at a series of concentrations. Treatment of cells with CCCP moderately decreased ATP generation at 2 h, and this effect became more substantial at 24 h in a dose-dependent manner (supplemental Fig. S6), indicating that changes in the bioenergetics may not be involved in Parkin translocation to mitochondria shortly after CCCP was added to the cells. Taken together, our data suggest that ROS may be important for Parkin recruitment to mitochondria, as ROS scavengers are able to block CCCP-induced Parkin recruitment when they effectively suppress ROS production. Because ROS scavenger may affect both mitochondrial depolarization and ROS production in response to CCCP treatment in our study, we sought to find a different approach to stimulate ROS production without altering mitochondrial potential. However, chemicals such as CCCP and paraquat usually depolarize mitochondria and trigger ROS generation concurrently (2Narendra D. Tanaka A. Suen D.F. Youle R.J. Parkin is recruited selectively to impaired mitochondria and promotes their autophagy.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 795-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (2842) Google Scholar), suggesting that these cellular phenomena may be linked. In addition, a photosensitizer, KillerRed, which stimulates ROS production upon photoactivation and triggers Parkin-mediated mitophagy, also disrupts mitochondrial potential (29Wang Y. Nartiss Y. Steipe B. McQuibban G.A. Kim P.K. ROS-induced mitochondrial depolarization initiates PARK2/PARKIN-dependent mitochondrial degradation by autophagy.Autophagy. 2012; 8: 1462-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Hence, we decided to employ a genetic approach to separate these two events. VDAC1 is known to mediate the release of ROS from the mitochondrial intermembrane space to the cytoplasm (30West A.P.

Keinan N. Arbel N. VDAC, a multi-functional mitochondrial protein regulating cell life and death.Mol. Aspects Med. 2010; 31: 227-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Moreover, VDAC1 has recently been identified as a mitochondrial substrate for Parkin after CCCP treatment (13Sun Y. Vashisht A.A. Tchieu J. Wohlschlegel J.A. Dreier L. Voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs) recruit Parkin to defective mitochondria to promote mitochondrial autophagy.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 40652-40660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Our immunoprecipitation assay replicated a physical interaction between Parkin and VDAC1 (supplemental Fig. S7). We next examined the effect of VDAC1 overexpression on mitochondrial recruitment of Parkin. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, Parkin was recruited to mitochondria in ∼30% of the cells concurrently overexpressing VDAC1. Western blot analysis was performed to evaluate the protein level of the overexpressed VDAC1 (supplemental Fig. S8). To determine whether VDAC1-induced Parkin recruitment is PINK1-related, a PINK1 knockdown HeLa cell line was generated. Both full-length PINK1 and its processed form failed to accumulate in response to CCCP or MG132 treatment in PINK1 knockdown cells (supplemental Fig. S9). Next, we co-transfected VDAC1 and Parkin into stable PINK1 knockdown cells and found that Parkin recruitment to mitochondria occurred in less than 5% of the cells expressing VDAC1 and Parkin (Fig. 3, C and D). Notably, VDAC1 overexpression in native HeLa cells did not affect the level of PINK1 expression compared with that in vector-overexpressing control cells (Fig. 3E), suggesting that the elevated level of PINK1 may not be necessary for PINK1-dependent Parkin recruitment to mitochondria. This result also suggests that mitochondrial potential is not disrupted by VDAC1 overexpression, as PINK1 would otherwise accumulate upon mitochondrial depolarization. To test whether ROS play a fundamental role in Parkin translocation induced by VDAC1 overexpression, we first examined whether the cellular level of ROS was changed by VDAC1 overexpression. VDAC1 plasmids with fluorescent tags at either terminus were constructed for subsequent analysis using flow cytometry. However, VDAC1 with either an N-terminal or C-terminal GFP tag was distributed evenly or with a punctum-like pattern in the cells (supplemental Fig. S10), suggesting that the GFP tag compromised proper localization of VDAC1 to the outer mitochondrial membrane. We therefore designed a blue fluorescent protein (BFP)-T2A-FLAG-VDAC1 plasmid construct that consists of a T2A sequence between the BFP and the FLAG tag. The T2A sequence is skipped by the ribosome during translation, leading to its “self-cleavage” and separation of the adjacent proteins (32Kim J.H. Lee S.R. Li L.H. Park H.J. Park J.H. Lee K.Y. Kim M.K. Shin B.A. Choi S.Y. High cleavage efficiency of a 2A peptide derived from porcine teschovirus-1 in human cell lines, zebrafish and mice.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e18556Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). When expressed in the cells, the BFP tag is used as a reporter to indicate the presence of ectopic VDAC1, whereas the FLAG tag can be immunostained to show the distribution pattern of VDAC1. Immunostaining showed that the BFP signals were ubiquitously distributed in the cells, whereas the FLAG signals showed perfect colocalization with the mitochondrial marker Tom20 (supplemental Fig. S11A), indicating functional VDAC1 for the downstream live-cell assays. The protein level of overexpressed VDAC1 using BFP-T2A-FLAG-VDAC1 is shown compared with that in cells expressing vector (supplemental Fig. S11B). We then examined ROS production and mitochondrial potential in HeLa cells overexpressing BFP-T2A-FLAG-VDAC1 by flow cytometry. VDAC1 overexpression increased ROS production by approximately 30% (Fig. 4A) but had little effect on mitochondrial potential (Fig. 4B). Next, we asked whether the ROS scavengers were able to attenuate VDAC1-induced Parkin translocation to mitochondria. Similar to its inhibition of CCCP-induced Parkin translocation to mitochondria, combinatorial treatment with 2 mm NAC and 1000 units/ml catalase dramatically impeded VDAC1-induced Parkin accumulation to mitochondria, whereas treatment with NAC or catalase alone had little effect (Fig. 4, C and D). Consistently, combinatorial treatment, but not treatment with NAC or catalase alone, was sufficient to quench ROS generation induced by VDAC1 overexpression (Fig. 4E). In addition, combinatorial treatment of NAC and catalase did not affect the protein expression levels of VDAC1 or Parkin (Fig. 4F), excluding the possibility that ROS scavengers blocked VDAC1-induced Parkin translocation by altering the levels of VDAC1 and/or Parkin. Moreover, combinatorial treatment of the ROS scavengers attenuated the overlap of LC-3 and mitochondria induced by VDAC1 overexpression (supplemental Fig. S12). Together, our data suggest that ROS may play an important role in VDAC1 overexpression–induced mitophagy. Starvation has been shown to stimulate ROS production and trigger general autophagy (33Scherz-Shouval R. Shvets E. Fass E. Shorer H. Gil L. Elazar Z.

https://openalex.org/W2746403472,"Multiple populations of wake-promoting neurons have been characterized in mammals, but few sleep-promoting neurons have been identified. Wake-promoting cell types include hypocretin and GABA (γ-aminobutyric-acid)-releasing neurons of the lateral hypothalamus, which promote the transition to wakefulness from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Here we show that a subset of GABAergic neurons in the mouse ventral zona incerta, which express the LIM homeodomain factor Lhx6 and are activated by sleep pressure, both directly inhibit wake-active hypocretin and GABAergic cells in the lateral hypothalamus and receive inputs from multiple sleep-wake-regulating neurons. Conditional deletion of Lhx6 from the developing diencephalon leads to decreases in both NREM and REM sleep. Furthermore, selective activation and inhibition of Lhx6-positive neurons in the ventral zona incerta bidirectionally regulate sleep time in adult mice, in part through hypocretin-dependent mechanisms. These studies identify a GABAergic subpopulation of neurons in the ventral zona incerta that promote sleep."
https://openalex.org/W2749651548,"Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) have a pivotal role in the establishment and maintenance of immunological self-tolerance and homeostasis. Transcriptional programming of regulatory mechanisms facilitates the functional activation of Treg cells in the prevention of diverse types of inflammatory responses. It remains unclear how Treg cells orchestrate their homeostasis and interplay with environmental signals. Here we show that liver kinase B1 (LKB1) programs the metabolic and functional fitness of Treg cells in the control of immune tolerance and homeostasis. Mice with a Treg-specific deletion of LKB1 developed a fatal inflammatory disease characterized by excessive TH2-type-dominant responses. LKB1 deficiency disrupted Treg cell survival and mitochondrial fitness and metabolism, but also induced aberrant expression of immune regulatory molecules including the negative co-receptor PD-1 and the TNF receptor superfamily proteins GITR and OX40. Unexpectedly, LKB1 function in Treg cells was independent of conventional AMPK signalling or the mTORC1-HIF-1α axis, but contributed to the activation of β-catenin signalling for the control of PD-1 and TNF receptor proteins. Blockade of PD-1 activity reinvigorated the ability of LKB1-deficient Treg cells to suppress TH2 responses and the interplay with dendritic cells primed by thymic stromal lymphopoietin. Thus, Treg cells use LKB1 signalling to coordinate their metabolic and immunological homeostasis and to prevent apoptotic and functional exhaustion, thereby orchestrating the balance between immunity and tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2735314732,"Epithelial organs undergo steady-state turnover throughout adult life, with old cells being continually replaced by the progeny of stem cell divisions. To avoid hyperplasia or atrophy, organ turnover demands strict equilibration of cell production and loss. However, the mechanistic basis of this equilibrium is unknown. Here we show that robustly precise turnover of the adult Drosophila intestine arises through a coupling mechanism in which enterocyte apoptosis breaks feedback inhibition of stem cell division. Healthy enterocytes inhibit stem cell division through E-cadherin, which prevents secretion of mitogenic epidermal growth factors (EGFs) by repressing transcription of the EGF maturation factor rhomboid. Individual apoptotic enterocytes promote divisions by loss of E-cadherin, which releases cadherin-associated β-catenin (Armadillo in Drosophila) and p120-catenin to induce rhomboid. Induction of rhomboid in the dying enterocyte triggers activation of the EGF receptor (Egfr) in stem cells within a discrete radius. When we blocked apoptosis, E-cadherin-controlled feedback suppressed divisions, and the organ retained the same number of cells. When we disrupted feedback, apoptosis and divisions were uncoupled, and the organ developed either hyperplasia or atrophy. Together, our results show that robust cellular balance hinges on the obligate coupling of divisions to apoptosis, which limits the proliferative potential of a stem cell to the precise time and place at which a replacement cell is needed. In this way, localized cell-cell communication gives rise to tissue-level homeostatic equilibrium and constant organ size."

Water or Met was administered orally. Maxillae were fixed and scanned using Micro-computed Tomography (μCT) to quantitate linear and bone volume/tissue volume (BV/TV) volumetric bone loss. Histopathological characteristics were assessed through immunohistochemical staining for MMP-9, COX-2, the RANKL/RANK/OPG pathway, SOD-1, and GPx-1. Additionally, confocal microscopy was used to analyze osteocalcin fluorescence. UV-VIS analysis was used to examine the levels of malondialdehyde, glutathione, IL-1β and TNF-α from gingival tissues. Quantitative RT-PCR reaction was used to gene expression of AMPK, NF-κB (p65), and Hmgb1 from gingival tissues. Significance among groups were analysed using a one-way ANOVA. A p-value of p<0.05 indicated a significant difference.Treatment with 50 mg/kg Met significantly reduced concentrations of malondialdehyde, IL-1β, and TNF-α (p < 0.05). Additionally, weak staining was observed for COX-2, MMP-9, RANK, RANKL, SOD-1, and GPx-1 after 50 mg/kg Met. OPG and Osteocalcin showed strong staining in the same group. Radiographically, linear measurements showed a statistically significant reduction in bone loss after 50 mg/kg Met compared to the ligature and Met 200 mg/kg groups. The same pattern was observed volumetrically in BV/TV and decreased osteoclast number (p<0.05). RT-PCR showed increased AMPK expression and decreased expression of NF-κB (p65) and HMGB1 after 50 mg/kg Met.Metformin, at a concentration of 50 mg/kg, decreases the inflammatory response, oxidative stress and bone loss in ligature-induced periodontitis in rats."
https://openalex.org/W2746186765,"In two previously described donors, the extracellular domain of LAIR1, a collagen-binding inhibitory receptor encoded on chromosome 19 (ref. 1), was inserted between the V and DJ segments of an antibody. This insertion generated, through somatic mutations, broadly reactive antibodies against RIFINs, a type of variant antigen expressed on the surface of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes. To investigate how frequently such antibodies are produced in response to malaria infection, we screened plasma from two large cohorts of individuals living in malaria-endemic regions. Here we report that 5-10% of malaria-exposed individuals, but none of the European blood donors tested, have high levels of LAIR1-containing antibodies that dominate the response to infected erythrocytes without conferring enhanced protection against febrile malaria. By analysing the antibody-producing B cell clones at the protein, cDNA and gDNA levels, we characterized additional LAIR1 insertions between the V and DJ segments and discovered a second insertion modality whereby the LAIR1 exon encoding the extracellular domain and flanking intronic sequences are inserted into the switch region. By exon shuffling, this mechanism leads to the production of bispecific antibodies in which the LAIR1 domain is precisely positioned at the elbow between the VH and CH1 domains. Additionally, in one donor the genomic DNA encoding the VH and CH1 domains was deleted, leading to the production of a camel-like LAIR1-containing antibody. Sequencing of the switch regions of memory B cells from European blood donors revealed frequent templated inserts originating from transcribed genes that, in rare cases, comprised exons with orientations and frames compatible with expression. These results reveal different modalities of LAIR1 insertion that lead to public and dominant antibodies against infected erythrocytes and suggest that insertion of templated DNA represents an additional mechanism of antibody diversification that can be selected in the immune response against pathogens and exploited for B cell engineering."

In the current study we found a novel role of hypoxia via HIF-2α in activating YAP1. Moreover, the increase in YAP1 by HIF-2α is essential for cell growth during hypoxic stress in colon-derived cell lines. The study provides a novel HIF-2α/YAP1-signaling pathway that maybe targeted in cancer treatment. To investigate the mechanisms of HIF-2α-induced cell proliferation, RNA-sequencing data were analyzed in a mouse model of HIF-2α overexpression specifically in intestinal epithelial cells (HIF2αLSL/LSL;VillinCre) (24Xie L.

Interestingly, the data showed an increased expression of several well-characterized YAP1 target genes: Cyr61, Ctgf, Tgfbr2, and Tead1. To assess the global regulation of YAP1 target genes by HIF-2α, data were compared from the HIF2αLSL/LSL;VillinCre mice and global gene expression profiles from mice, which have a constitutive activated YAP1 in intestinal epithelial cells (17Barry E.R. Morikawa T. Butler B.L. Shrestha K. de la Rosa R. Yan K.S. Fuchs C.S. Magness S.T. Smits R. Ogino S. Kuo C.J. Camargo F.D. Restriction of intestinal stem cell expansion and the regenerative response by YAP.Nature. 2013; 493: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). 484 genes (279 down-regulated and 205 up-regulated genes) were commonly regulated in YAP1- and HIF-2α-overexpressing mice (Fig. 1, A and B). This suggests a potential cross-talk between HIF-2α and YAP1 signaling. These commonly regulated genes by HIF-2α and YAP1 are involved in not only Hippo signaling pathway but also several other pathways including MAPK, PI3K-AKT, and TGF-β signaling pathways (Fig. 1, A and B). To confirm these changes Western blot analyses and quantitative PCR (qPCR) were performed in HIF2αLSL/LSL;VillinCre mice for YAP1 signaling and target genes. In the HIF2αLSL/LSL;VillinCre mice a significant increase in total-YAP1 protein levels and YAP1 target genes, Cyr61, Ctgf, and Tgfbr2 were observed, whereas HIF-1α overexpression decreased YAP1 target genes Tgfbr2 and Tead1 (Fig. 2A). This indicates that HIF-2α, but not HIF-1α, increases YAP1 activity. To demonstrate this was a cell autonomous function of HIF-2α, an oxygen-stable HIF-2α was stably overexpressed in HCT116 colon cancer cell line (Fig. 2B). Consistent with in vivo data, the overexpression of HIF-2α in HCT116 significantly increased YAP1 target genes Cyr61 and Ctgf expression (Fig. 2C). Western blotting and immunofluorescent staining showed that HIF-2α overexpression significantly increased both total YAP1 (T-YAP1) and phospho-YAP1 (p-YAP1) protein levels and nuclear YAP1 localization without altering the p-YAP/T-YAP1 ratio (Fig. 1, E and F). These data confirm that HIF-2α increases the expression of YAP1 target genes.Figure 2HIF-2α increased YAP1 target genes.

Consistent with a previous study, YAP1 significantly increased Cyr61 and GTIIC promoter activities in all of the cell lines assessed (Fig. 3, A and B). Interestingly, HIF-2α increased basal Cry61 activity in SW480 and HEK293 cell lines (Fig. 3A) and potentiated the YAP1 transcriptional activity on the Cyr61 and GTIIC promoter in the cell lines assessed (Fig. 3, A and B). These data indicated that HIF-2α potentiates YAP1 activity. YAP1 is important for cell proliferation, adenoma formation, and cancer development (27Harvey K.F. Zhang X. Thomas D.M.

To further understand if HIF-2α is essential for YAP1 activation after APC disruption, a novel mouse model was generated using a tamoxifen-inducible colon-specific Cre (CDX2ERT2cre) (30Feng Y. Sentani K. Wiese A. Sands E. Green M. Bommer G.T. Cho K.R. Fearon E.R.

The CDX2ERT2cre mice were crossed to the Apc floxed mice (CDXERT2Cre/ApcF/F) or crossed to the Apc and Hif2α floxed mice (CDXERT2Cre ApcF/F/Hif2αF/F). 7-Days after tamoxifen treatment, Hif2α and HIF-2α target gene Scl11a2 were significantly decreased in Hif2α floxed mice (CDXERT2Cre ApcF/F/Hif2αF/F) compared with CDXERT2Cre/ApcF/F group (Fig. 4A). Consistent with previous work (31Zhang H. Ramakrishnan S.K. Triner D. Centofanti B. Maitra D. Gyrffy B. Sebolt-Leopold J.S. Dame M.K. Varani J. Brenner D.E. Fearon E.R. Omary M.B. Shah Y.M. Tumor-selective proteotoxicity of Verteporfin inhibits colon cancer progression independently of YAP1.Sci. Signal. 2015; 8: ra98Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), Cyr61 and CTGF genes were induced in both CDXERT2CreApcF/F and CDXERT2CreApcF/F/Hif2αF/F mice compared with littermate controls ApcF/F mice, but there was no significant change in YAP1 target genes in the CDXERT2CreApcF/F/Hif2αF/F mice compared with CDXERT2CreApcF/F mice (Fig. 4A). Moreover, the increase of p-YAP1 and T-YAP1 protein after Apc disruption was not altered in mice with a HIF-2α disruption (Fig. 4B). Immunofluorescence staining with Ki67 and H&E staining showed increased cell proliferation in CDXERT2CreApcF/F mice, whereas HIF-2α knock-out did not alter the tissue proliferation (Fig. 4, C and D). These results indicate that HIF-2α is not essential for the increase of YAP1 and its target gene expression in sporadic CRC models. Src family kinases can promote proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells through activation of YAP1, which contributes to the proper regulation of intestinal epithelial cell turnover and intestinal homeostasis (32Imada S. Murata Y. Kotani T. Hatano M. Sun C. Konno T. Park J.H. Kitamura Y. Saito Y. Ohdan H. Matozaki T. Role of Src family kinases in regulation of intestinal epithelial homeostasis.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2016; 10.1128/MCB.00311-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To assess if HIF-2α potentiates YAP1 through Src, YAP1 reporter assays were performed after treatment with the Src inhibitor, SU6656. Cyr61 promoter luciferase was significantly increased when the cells were transfected with both HIF-2α and YAP1, but this potentiation was not inhibited when treated with SU6656 (Fig. 5A, left panel). The Src activity inhibition with SU6656 was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5A, right panel). The PI3K-AKT pathway is essential for cell survival (33Nicholson K.M. Anderson N.G. The protein kinase B/Akt signalling pathway in human malignancy.Cell Signal. 2002; 14: 381-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar). AKT also alters YAP1 activity (34Basu S. Totty N.F. Irwin M.S. Sudol M. Downward J. Akt phosphorylates the Yes-associated protein, YAP, to induce interaction with 14-3-3 and attenuation of p73-mediated apoptosis.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 11-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar); however, AKT (MK2206) inhibitor did not affect the potentiation of YAP1 activity by HIF-2α (Fig. 5B, left panel). The phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) inhibition by MK2206 was confirmed using Western blot analysis (Fig. 5B, right panel). Recently we showed a novel cross-talk of HIF-2α with MEK1-ERK1/2 signaling (35Zhu C. Yu J. Pan Q. Yang J. Hao G. Wang Y. Li L. Cao H. Hypoxia-inducible factor-2 α promotes the proliferation of human placenta-derived mesenchymal stem cells through the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 35489Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). MAPK pathways increase YAP1 activity (36Liao T. Wen D. Ma B. Hu J.Q. Qu N. Shi R.L. Liu L. Guan Q. Li D.S. Ji Q.H. Yes-associated protein 1 promotes papillary thyroid cancer cell proliferation by activating the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway.Oncotarget. 2017; 8: 11719-11728Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Inhibition of MEK1 using two different inhibitors (GSK1120212 or PD325901) significantly decreased ERK activity, as the phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK) was inhibited (Fig. 5C, right panel). The inhibition of MEK1 using GSK1120212 significantly decreased the CYR61 promoter activity induced by YAP1, but neither inhibitor decreased the HIF-2α-induced potentiation to levels observed with YAP1 transfection (Fig. 5C, left panel). To test if HIF-2α and YAP1 could directly interact, FLAG-tagged YAP1 (YAP1-FLAG) and HIF-2α plasmids were co-transfected into HCT116 cells. A pulldown of FLAG and Western blot analysis for HIF-2α did not demonstrate any interaction (Fig. 5D). Similarly, cells were transfected with NTAP (N-terminal affinity purification)-tagged HIF-2α (HIF-2α-NTAP) and YAP1-FLAG plasmids. A pulldown of NTAP and blotting for FLAG also indicated no interaction between HIF-2α and YAP1 (Fig. 5D). These data indicated that there is no direct protein binding between HIF-2α and YAP1. A recent study demonstrates that PGE2 and the synthase needed for PGE2 production, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), are essential in YAP1 expression and transcriptional activity in CRC (37Kim H.B. Kim M.

The COX2-PGE2 pathway is critical in CRC progression and non-steroidal inflammatory drugs, which are potent and selective inhibitors of COX2, are effective chemopreventative agents in CRC (38Sostres C.

The role of COX-2 in intestinal inflammation and colorectal cancer.Oncogene. 2010; 29: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). PGE2 production is highly elevated in CRC via a HIF-2α-dependent activation of COX2 (7Xue X. Shah Y.M.

To assess if HIF-2α leads to potentiation of YAP1 via COX2-PGE2 signaling loop, a colon tumor model dependent on HIF-2α activation was assessed (6Xue X. Taylor M. Anderson E. Hao C. Qu A.

Mice with an intestine-specific disruption of Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein led to constitutive HIF activation and an increase in HIF1α and HIF2α target genes Slc11a2, DcytB, Vegf, PDK1, and Ankrd37 (Fig. 6A) (40Shah Y.M.

These mice crossed to a sporadic intestinal tumor model Apcmin/+ leads to a robust increase in colon tumors that is dependent on HIF-2α (but not HIF-1α) (VhlΔIE;Apcmin/+) (6Xue X. Taylor M.

Hypoxia-inducible factor-2α activation promotes colorectal cancer progression by dysregulating iron homeostasis.Cancer Res. 2012; 72: 2285-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Moreover, our previous study demonstrates that intestinal epithelial cell activation of HIF-1α does not increase carcinogenesis or progression of colon cancer (41Xue X. Ramakrishnan S.K. Shah Y.M. Activation of HIF-1α does not increase intestinal tumorigenesis.Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2014; 307: G187-G195Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). VhlΔIE;Apcmin/+ and littermate control mice (VhlF/F;Apcmin/+) were treated with the COX2 inhibitor nimesulide. Tumor tissue from both VhlF/F;Apcmin/+ and VhlΔIE;Apcmin/+ mice had significant increases of Cyr61 and Ctgf gene expression compared with normal tissue (Fig. 6B). Nimesulide treatment significantly suppressed YAP1 target gene expression in VhlF/F;Apcmin/+ tumor tissue (Fig. 6B). HIF-2α stabilization led to a further increase in Cyr61 and Ctgf, consistent with our data showing that HIF-2α can potentiate YAP1 signaling. Nimesulide did not decrease the HIF-2α potentiation of YAP1 target genes in tumor tissues (Fig. 6B). This suggests that the cross-talk between HIF-2α and YAP1 was PGE2-independent. Currently the mechanism by which HIF-2α leads to YAP1 potentiation is not clear. However, to understand if YAP1 activation is essential in hypoxia or HIF-2α-induced colon cancer cell growth, proliferation assays were assessed. RKO, SW480, and KM12 cell lines were incubated in either normoxia (21% O2) or hypoxia (1% O2) conditions. All three cell lines demonstrated a significant increase in HIF-1α and HIF-2α protein expression in hypoxia (Fig. 7A). YAP1 was shown to be essential in hypoxic growth, as using our previously validated YAP1 siRNAs (siYAP1) (31Zhang H. Ramakrishnan S.K. Triner D. Centofanti B. Maitra D. Gyrffy B. Sebolt-Leopold J.S.

https://openalex.org/W2748307435,"Primary cilia are hairlike extensions of the plasma membrane of most mammalian cells that serve specialized signaling functions. To traffic properly to cilia, multiple cilia proteins rely on palmitoylation, the post-translational attachment of a saturated 16-carbon lipid. However, details regarding the mechanism of how palmitoylation affects cilia protein localization and function are unknown. Herein, we investigated the protein ADP-ribosylation factor-like GTPase 13b (ARL13b) as a model palmitoylated ciliary protein. Using biochemical, cellular, and in vivo studies, we found that ARL13b palmitoylation occurs in vivo in mouse kidneys and that it is required for trafficking to and function within cilia. Myristoylation, a 14-carbon lipid, is shown to largely substitute for palmitoylation with regard to cilia localization of ARL13b, but not with regard to its function within cilia. The functional importance of palmitoylation results in part from a dramatic increase in ARL13b stability, which is not observed with myristoylation. Additional results show that blockade of depalmitoylation slows the degradation of ARL13b that occurs during cilia resorption, raising the possibility that the sensitivity of ARL13b stability to palmitoylation may be exploited by the cell to accelerate degradation of ARL13b by depalmitoylating it. Together, the results show that palmitoylation plays a unique and critical role in controlling the localization, stability, abundance, and thus function of ARL13b. Pharmacological manipulation of protein palmitoylation may be a strategy to alter cilia function."
https://openalex.org/W2751978230,"Sex differences in the development of the normal heart and the prevalence of cardiomyopathies have been reported. The molecular basis of these differences remains unclear. Sex differences in the human heart might be related to patterns of gene expression. Recent studies have shown that sex specific differences in gene expression in tissues including the brain, kidney, skeletal muscle, and liver. Similar data is limited for the heart. Herein we address this issue by analyzing donor and post-mortem adult human heart samples originating from 46 control individuals to study whole-genome gene expression in the human left ventricle. Using data from the genotype tissue expression (GTEx) project, we compared the transcriptome expression profiles of male and female hearts. We found that genes located on sex chromosomes were the most abundant ones among the sexually dimorphic genes. The majority of differentially expressed autosomal genes were those involved in the regulation of inflammation, which has been found to be an important contributor to left ventricular remodeling. Specifically, genes on autosomal chromosomes encoding chemokines with inflammatory functions (e.g. CCL4, CX3CL1, TNFAIP3) and a gene that regulates adhesion of immune cells to the endothelium (e.g., VCAM1) were identified with sex-specific expression levels. This study underlines the relevance of sex as an important modifier of cardiac gene expression. These results have important implications in the understanding of the differences in the physiology of the male and female heart transcriptome and how they may lead to different sex specific difference in human cardiac health and its control."
https://openalex.org/W2752989654,"Allergic and autoimmune diseases had been attributed to lack of exposure to biodiversity, an important factor in regulating immune homeostasis in a healthy host. We posit that the microbiome of healthy dairy farmers (DF) will be richer than non-farmers (NF) living in urban settings due to exposure to a greater biodiversity in the dairy environment. However, no studies have investigated the relationships between microbiota of dairy farmers (DF) compared with urban non-farmers (NF). We compared the nasal and oral microbiota of dairy farmers (N_DF, O_DF, respectively) with nasal and oral microbiota of NF in the same geographical area. The N_DF showed high microbial diversity with hundreds of unique genera that reflected environmental/occupational exposures. The nasal and oral microbiomes clustered separately from each other using Principal Coordinate Analysis, and with DF harboring two-fold and 1.5-fold greater exclusive genera in their nose and mouth respectively, than did non-farmers. Additionally, the N_DF group had a lower burden of Staphylococcus spp. suggesting a correlation between higher microbial diversity and competition for colonization by staphylococci. The N_DF samples were negative for the mecA gene, a marker of methicillin-resistance in staphylococci. The lower burden of staphylococci was found to be independent of the abundance of Corynebacterium spp. Exposure to greater biodiversity could enhance microbial competition, thereby reducing colonization with opportunistic pathogens. Future studies will analyze whether exposure to livestock microbiomes offers protection from acute and chronic diseases."

Many tumor cells exhibit altered NADPH metabolism to fuel their rapid proliferation. However, little is known about how NADPH metabolism is coordinated in tumor cells. Here we report that ME1 increases the PPP flux by forming physiological complexes with 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD). We found that ME1 and 6PGD form a hetero-oligomer that increases the capability of 6PGD to bind its substrate 6-phosphogluconate. Through activating 6PGD, ME1 enhances NADPH generation, PPP flux, and tumor cell growth. Interestingly, although ME1 could bind either the dimer-defect mutant 6PGD (K294R) or the NADP+-binding defect 6PGD mutants, only 6PGD (K294R) activity was induced by ME1. Thus, ME1/6PGD hetero-complexes may mimic the active oligomer form of 6PGD.

Three main isoforms of malic enzyme (ME) have been reported: cytoplasmic NADP+-dependent isoform (ME1), mitochondrial NADP+/NAD+-dependent isoform (ME2), and mitochondrial NADP+-dependent isoform (ME3). However, ME1 and ME2 appear to be main isoforms as ME3 is nearly undetectable in many mammalian cells assessed (10Jiang P. Du W. Mancuso A. Wellen K.E. Yang X. Reciprocal regulation of p53 and malic enzymes modulates metabolism and senescence.Nature. 2013; 493: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Through sustaining cellular NADPH levels and adjusting TCA cycle flux, malic enzyme promotes tumor growth and prevents senescence (10Jiang P. Du W. Mancuso A. Wellen K.E. Yang X. Reciprocal regulation of p53 and malic enzymes modulates metabolism and senescence.Nature. 2013; 493: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Although it has become increasing clear that alteration of NADPH metabolism is critical for cell proliferation and survival, the mechanisms underlying how NADPH metabolic pathways are coordinated remain poorly understood. Here we report that ME1 enhances PPP through direct binding and activating 6PGD, leading to tumor cell proliferation. To explore the intrinsic relationship among NADPH metabolic pathways, we examined whether ME1 coordinates PPP to promote cell proliferation. The human osteosarcoma U2OS cells stably infected with retroviral vector expressing ME1 grew faster than control cells under in vitro culture condition. Interestingly, supplementation of 6-aminonicotinamide (6-AN), a competitive G6PD and 6PGD inhibitor (13Lange K. Proft E.R. Inhibition of the 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase in the rat kidney by 6-aminonicotinamide.Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmakol. 1970; 267: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 14Köhler E. Barrach H. Neubert D. Inhibition of NADP dependent oxidoreductases by the 6-aminonicotinamide analogue of NADP.FEBS Lett. 1970; 6: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), blocked cell proliferation regardless of ME1 status (Fig. 1A). These findings raise a possibility that ME1-mediated cell proliferation may be dependent on the PPP activity. To directly investigate whether ME1 affects the PPP flux, we performed 13C isotope tracing experiments. U2OS cells stably expressing ME1 or control vector were cultured in medium containing [1,2-13C2] glucose, and the oxidative PPP flux was measured on the basis of the rate of glucose consumption and the generation of 13C-labeling lactate (M1) determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Interestingly, we found that ME1 expression led to an increase in the oxidative PPP flux, whereas silencing of ME1 caused a significant drop in the oxidative PPP flux (Fig. 1B). We next investigated the mechanism by which ME1 promotes the PPP flux. By analyzing PPP enzymes activities, we observed that ME1 affected 6PGD activity. Stable overexpression of ME1 noticeably enhanced the enzymatic activity of 6PGD in U2OS cells (Fig. 1C, left panel). Similar results were observed in human lung cancer A549 cells (Fig. 1C, right panel). Conversely, knockdown of ME1 expression resulted in reduced 6PGD activity in these cell lines (Fig. 1D). To test whether the effect of ME1 on the cell proliferation is mediated by 6PGD, we knocked down 6PGD in control cells and ME1-overexpressed cells. Consistently, 6PGD silencing impaired cell proliferation and phenocopied 6-aminonicotinamide treatment (Fig. 1E). Moreover, in soft agar, an in vitro measure of tumorigenicity, tumor cells transduced with ME1 showed enhanced anchorage-independent growth, whereas silencing of 6PGD reduced the anchorage-independent growth of both control cells and ME1-overexpressed cells, minimizing the difference between these two cell types (Fig. 1F). Together, these data suggest that ME1 modulates PPP activity and promotes cell proliferation at least partially via 6PGD. As shown in Fig. 1, the levels of the 6PGD protein remained unchanged by either overexpression or depletion of ME1, suggesting that ME1-mediated stimulation of 6PGD activity is not due to the enhancement of protein synthesis or stabilization. To investigate the mechanism by which ME1 increases 6PGD activity, we performed immunofluorescence assay using cells co-expressing FLAG-tagged ME1 (FLAG-ME1) and enhanced green fluorescence protein-fused 6PGD (GFP-6PGD) or eGFP vector control. Results showed that ME1 and 6PGD co-localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2A). These findings led us to examine whether ME1 binds 6PGD. Immunoprecipitation assays revealed that FLAG-ME1 specifically associated with GFP-6PGD in 293T cells (Fig. 2B). Moreover, the interaction between ME1 and 6PGD occurred at endogenous levels (Fig. 2C). To investigate whether ME1 and 6PGD association is direct or influenced by other factors, we purified these proteins and performed the binding assay in vitro. As we expected, a notable association between ME1 and 6PGD was observed (Fig. 2, D and E). Moreover, analysis of the ME1–6PGD binding in real time using surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore) showed that ME1 and 6PGD bound each other with dissociation constant (Kd) of ∼14.3 μm (Fig. 2F). Together, these findings suggest that ME1 binds to 6PGD directly. To test whether ME1 can form complexes with 6PGD, we employed cell lysates from 293T cells transfected with FLAG-ME1 and 6PGD fused with either GST or GFP to perform sequential immunoprecipitation experiments. An initial immunoprecipitation assay using an anti-FLAG antibody against FLAG-ME1 pulled down both GST-tagged and eGFP-tagged 6PGD (Fig. 2G, lane 4). The immunocomplexes were eluted, and GST-6PGD was subsequently precipitated by an anti-GST antibody. ME1 and GFP-6PGD were present in the anti-GST-6PGD precipitates (Fig. 2G, lane 6). Conversely, using anti-GST antibody to pull down GST-6PGD in the first round of immunoprecipitation and anti-HA antibody to precipitate HA-ME1, we could subsequently observe that 6PGD is able to form complexes with both HA-ME1 and GFP-ME1 (Fig. 2H). Thus, these data reveal that ME1 physically forms complexes with 6PGD. To investigate whether the direct association underlines the mechanism for the regulation of 6PGD activity by ME1, we purified recombined FLAG-ME1 and His-tagged 6PGD (rHis-6PGD) proteins and carried out an enzymatic activity assay in vitro. However, protein may undergo structural or conformational changes during purification, leading to inhibition or even loss of activity. To exclude this possibility, we examined the enzymatic activity of each of the purified proteins in vitro. As we anticipated, purified FLAG-ME1 protein exhibited high capability of converting NADP+ to NADPH in the presence of sufficient substrate malate and showed high enzymatic activity (supplemental Fig. 1, A–C). Similar results were observed with purified His-6PGD proteins (supplemental Fig. 1, D–F), suggesting that enzymatic activities of the recombinant proteins were sustained during the process of purification. Having these recombined proteins, we next investigated the effect of ME1 on 6PGD activity in vitro. ME1 incubation with rHis-6PGD increased NADPH production rates of 6PGD and enhanced the 6PGD activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3, A–C). To exclude the possibility that the increased 6PGD activity might be due to nonspecific conversion of 6PGD substrate (6PG) by ME1 or the ME1-associated cellular 6PGD during purification by protein A/G affinity chromatography, we examined whether ME1 possessed “6PGD enzymatic activity.” In the presence of 6PG and NADP+, ME1 failed to elevate NADPH production, in other words, no 6PGD activity exhibited by recombined ME1 was observed, indicating that ME1 increased 6PGD activity directly and specifically (Fig. 3D, supplemental Fig. 2A). Increased 6PGD enzymatic activity might be induced by higher affinity to its substrate. To confirm this, we assayed the effect of ME1 on 6PGD enzymatic activity in vitro with increasing amounts of substrate 6PG (Fig. 3E). Surprisingly, at each dose of 6PG, FLAG-ME1 supplementation increased 6PGD activity, suggesting that ME1 enhances the capability of 6PGD binding to it substrate. Additionally, no activity was detected when 6PG is absent (0), underscoring the specificity of the assay. To rule out the possibility that different fusion tags may change 6PGD activity induced by ME1, we thus switched to a FLAG tag for 6PGD protein purification. Indeed, FLAG-6PGD showed higher activity than His-6PGD, which may be caused by fusing tag or activity loss during purification (Fig. 3, F versus C). Nevertheless, consistent with above findings, ME1 noticeably elevated 6PGD activity in a dose-dependent manner regardless of different tags used (Fig. 3F). By contrast, FLAG alone failed to affect 6PGD enzymatic activity (Fig. 3F). To determine whether these effects of ME1 are mediated by its own enzymatic activity, we generated two ME1 mutations (ME1mut1 and ME1mut2), each of which exhibited little or no enzymatic activity as described previously (10Jiang P. Du W. Mancuso A. Wellen K.E. Yang X. Reciprocal regulation of p53 and malic enzymes modulates metabolism and senescence.Nature. 2013; 493: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both mutants were able to markedly increase 6PGD enzymatic activity and 6PGD-mediated NADPH generation in vitro (Fig. 3F, supplemental Fig. 2B). Similarly, these effects were also observed in 293T cells. Cells transfected with increasing amounts of either wild-type ME1 showed increased 6PGD enzymatic activities and NADPH generation ability compared with control cells (supplemental Fig. 2, C and D). Expression of these two mutant forms of ME1 led to augmentation of 6PGD activity, in which both ME1 mutants were still able to interact with 6PGD (Fig. 3G, supplemental Fig. 2E). Together, these data suggest that ME1 directly promotes 6PGD activation independent of its own activity. Next, we wanted to investigate the effect of these ME1 mutants on cell proliferation. Consistent with our previous findings (10Jiang P. Du W. Mancuso A. Wellen K.E. Yang X. Reciprocal regulation of p53 and malic enzymes modulates metabolism and senescence.Nature. 2013; 493: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), ME1mut1 and ME1mut2 failed to remarkably promote cell proliferation under normal condition (supplemental Fig. 2, F and G, columns 1–4). This may due to the dominant negative effect of ME1 mutants on endogenous ME1. To test this possibility, we knocked down endogenous ME1 by introducing ME1 siRNA into the cells stably expressing RNAi-resistant ME1 or ME1 mutants. Notably, when endogenous ME1 was absent, expression of mutant ME1 led to increased cell proliferation to a similar extent as that of wild-type ME1 (supplemental Fig. 2, F and G, columns 5–8). Similar results were obtained with the anchorage-independent growth. Like wild-type ME1, these mutant forms of ME1 increased the number of colonies (Fig. 3H). Together, these findings suggest that ME1 promotes cell proliferation independent of its enzymatic activity, correlating with its effect on 6PGD (Fig. 3G). To extend our findings to other species, we tested the effect of ME1 on yeast 6PGD protein. Similarly, ME1 enhanced the yeast 6PGD activity and the ability of yeast 6PGD to generate NADPH in a dose-dependent manner (supplemental Fig. 3, A–C). Together, these results show that ME1 directly enhanced 6PGD enzymatic activity, which is independent of its own enzymatic activity. 6PGD is an equilibrium of inactive monomer and active oligomer. Studies mentioned above reveal that ME1 formed complexes with 6PGD (Fig. 2, G and H) and increased 6PGD activity (Fig. 3E). These findings led us to further investigate whether ME1 promotes the formation of ME1–6PGD hetero-oligomer, thereby increasing the binding affinity between 6PGD and its substrate 6PG. In U2OS cells, the lack of ME1 resulted in a decrease in 6PGD-associated oligomers (Fig. 4A). Consistently, stably overexpressing ME1 increased the formation of 6PGD-associated oligomers (Fig. 4B). Moreover, co-expression of GST-6PGD and FLAG-ME1 in 293T cells resulted in a significant increase in both 6PGD-associated oligomers and ME1-associated oligomers (Fig. 4C). Together with findings mentioned above (Fig. 2, G and H), these data indicate that ME1 and 6PGD may form a hetero-oligomer that harbors elevated 6PGD activity. Conversely, we sought to examine whether the formation of ME1/6PGD oligomer also exhibits increased enzymatic activity of ME1. Intriguingly, ME1 activity remained unaffected when 6PGD was present, indicating that formation of hetero-oligomers increased 6PGD activity unilaterally (Fig. 4D). Expectedly, ME1 failed to restore or increase the enzymatic activity of a mutant 6PGD, 6PGDmut1 (G10I, L11N, A12K, V13K, M14K, G15I), with a defect in binding to its cofactor NADP+ (Fig. 4E, supplemental Fig. 4, A–C), but even this mutant was still able to bind to ME1 (Fig. 4F, third lane). To further confirm this, we generated another 6PGD mutation, 6PGDmut2 (H187N, D188L), which exhibits no enzymatic activity (supplemental Fig. 4, A and B). Immunoprecipitation assays showed that this mutant 6PGD lost the ability to bind to ME1 (Fig. 4F, fourth lane), and consistently, no enhanced 6PGD enzymatic activity was observed when ME1 was present (Fig. 4E, supplemental Fig. 4C). These data suggest that direct protein-protein association is required for ME1-mediated 6PGD activation. 6PGD activity can be modulated by post-translational modification such as acetylation (9Shan C. Elf S. Ji Q. Kang H.B. Zhou L. Hitosugi T. Jin L. Lin R. Zhang L. Seo J.H. Xie J. Tucker M. Gu T.L. Sudderth J. Jiang L. et al.Lysine acetylation activates 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase to promote tumor growth.Mol. Cell. 2014; 55: 552-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We, therefore, generated two acetyl-deficient 6PGD mutants (6PGD K76R and K294R), which exhibited decreased enzymatic activity compared to wild-type 6PGD (Fig. 4H). Mechanistically, K76R mutation reduced NADP+-binding ability of 6PGD, whereas K294R mutation impaired the formation of active 6PGD dimmers (9Shan C. Elf S. Ji Q. Kang H.B. Zhou L. Hitosugi T. Jin L. Lin R. Zhang L. Seo J.H. Xie J. Tucker M. Gu T.L. Sudderth J. Jiang L. et al.Lysine acetylation activates 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase to promote tumor growth.Mol. Cell. 2014; 55: 552-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated whether ME1 could reverse the reduction of enzymatic activity of these mutants. First, we tested the interaction between ME1 and 6PGD (K76R) or 6PGD (K294R) by performing an immunoprecipitation assay. Although K76R or K294R mutation decrease the binding ability of 6PGD to ME1, a significant interaction between ME1 and 6PGD (K76R) or 6PGD (K294R) was observed (Fig. 4G). Interestingly, a substantial increase in the oligomerization of each of these mutants was detected related to wild-type 6PGD proteins in the presence of ME1 (supplemental Fig. 4D). Consistently, ME1 markedly restored the activity of both 6PGD (K294) and 6PGD (K76R) mutants (Fig. 4H). Together, these results suggest that ME1 forms hetero-oligomers with 6PGD to enhance 6PGD activity. As a key factor required for both antioxidant defense and reductive biosynthesis, NADPH can be produced from multiple pathways, of which PPP, malic enzymes, and folate metabolism are the three major contributors to cellular NADPH generation. Here we show that PPP and malic enzyme pathway are coordinated intrinsically to orchestrate NADPH metabolism. ME1 enhances PPP flux by forming hetero-complexes with 6PGD. Interestingly, although direct interaction between ME1 and 6PGD is required, the ME1 enzymatic activity is totally dispensable for the activation of 6PGD by ME1. Subsequent immunoprecipitation and cross-linking assays demonstrate that ME1/6PGD can form hetero-oligomers, which may mimic the active form of 6PGD homo-oligomer. Thus, this conformational simulation may lead to an increase in the binding ability of 6PGD to its substrate. To support this, we also generated the NADP+-binding defect 6PGDmut1 with no enzymatic activity. Similar to ME1, this mutant 6PGD could interact and form oligomers with the wild-type 6PGD (supplemental Fig. 5, A and B) and increase wild-type 6PGD activity (supplemental Fig. 5C). Hence, ME1 may act as a structural analogue of 6PGD that helps to activate 6PGD by forming ME1/6PGD hetero-oligomerization when cellular 6PGD level is low or insufficient. Consistent with hypothesis, 3D structure comparison revealed that 6PGD dimers and ME1 dimers shared similar conformation (15Hsieh J.Y. Li S.Y. Chen M.C. Yang P.C. Chen H.Y. Chan N.L. Liu J.H. Hung H.C. Structural characteristics of the nonallosteric human cytosolic malic enzyme.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1844: 1773-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 5D). Besides this, hetero-oligomerization formation enhanced activity of 6PGD but not ME1. Therefore, further structural analysis might help us to gain insight into how the ME1/6PGD hetero-oligomers function. Like 6PGD, the other NADPH-producing enzyme G6PD could also co-localized with ME1 (supplemental Fig. 6A) and directly bind ME1 with a Kd of ∼1.243 μm (supplemental Fig. 6, B–D). Consistently, ME1 stimulated G6PD activity and enhanced the capability of G6PD to bind its substrate glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) (supplemental Fig. 6, E and F). Likewise, mutant forms of ME1 dose-dependently activated G6PD (supplemental Fig. 6, E and F). Thus, given the existence of multiple NADPH-generating enzymes within the cells, it would be interesting to further determine the coordination network of these NADPH metabolic pathways. Moreover, some metabolic enzymes share the same coenzyme or substrate; therefore, the existence of the intrinsic coordination via conformational simulation between these metabolic enzymes might enable efficient metabolic adaptation to different stresses. Overall, our findings have highlighted the direct cross-talk between the malic enzyme pathway and the pentose phosphate pathway and may reveal an alternative mechanism for signaling transduction via conformation simulation among the metabolic enzymes. The antibodies against the following proteins were purchased from the indicated sources: ME1 and phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); FLAG (Sigma); GFP (Seajet Scientific); GST (CMCTAG); actin (Proteintech). The following reagents were all purchased from Sigma: G6P, 6PG, β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 2′-phosphate (NADP+), 6PGD from yeast, trichostatin A, FLAG peptide, and anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel except disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) from Thermo Scientific and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) from Amresco. HCT116 cells and 293T cells were cultured in DMEM (Macgene). U2OS cells were maintained in McCoy's 5A Medium (HyClone). Cells were cultured in standard culture conditions without any antibiotic. siRNAs for ME1 and 6PGD were purchased from Invitrogen. siRNA sequences were 5′-AUAACAAUCAGGUAGAAUCUGGUCA-3′ (human ME1), 5′-GCCCAGGCCUUUGAGGAUUGGAAUA-3′ (human 6PGD), and 5′-GUGCGUUGCUAGUACCAACUU-3′ (scrambled siRNA). siRNAs were transfected into U2OS cells using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Transfection Agent (Invitrogen). To generate cells with stable overexpression of ME1, U2OS and HCT116 cells were infected with pBabe vector or pBabe-ME1, and then cells were selected with puromycin (1 μg/ml) for 2 weeks. For the 6PGD enzyme activity assay, cell lysates or purified proteins were measured by the conversion of NADP+ to NADPH in the presence of 6PG. For the ME1 activity assay, cell lysates or purified proteins were analyzed in the reaction buffer containing 67 mm triethanolamine, 3.3 mm l-malic acid, 0.3 mm β-NADP+, and 5.0 mm manganese chloride, and the increase in 341 nm absorbance (OD341) as a measure of NADPH production was obtained every 30 s for 30 min. The mutation primers for 6PGD were: mut1, 5′-GACATCGCGCTGATCATAAATAAGAAGAAGATCCAGAACTTAA-3′ and 5′-CAGAATTAAGTTCTGGATCTTCTTCTTATTTATGATCAGCGCG-3′; mut2, 5′-GAAGATGGTGGACCTCGGGATAGAGTATGG-3′ and 5′-CTCTATCCCGAGGTCCACCATCTTCACGAAG-3′; K76R, 5′-ATCATCCTCCTGGTGAGGGCTGGGCAAG-3′ and 5′-CACAGCTTGCCCAGCCCTCACCAGGAGG-3′; K294R, 5′-TGCTTATCATCTCTGAGGGATGAGAGAA-3′ and 5′-TTGAATTCTCTCATCCCTCAGAGATGAT-3′. Overlapping PCR was performed to construct 6PGD mutation. FLAG-ME1, FLAG-ME1-mut1, FLAG-ME1-mut2, FLAG-6PGD, FLAG-6PGD-mut1, FLAG-6PGD-mut2, FLAG-6PGDK76R, and FLAG-6PGDK294R were expressed in HEK293T cells and purified by anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel. His-6PGD and His-ME1 were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid His bind resin (GE Healthcare). GST-tagged 6PGD, 6PGDK76R, and 6PGDK294R were expressed in HEK293T cells and purified by glutathione beads (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). For immunoprecipitation, HEK293T cells were transfected with FLAG-ME1 and GFP-6PGD for 48 h, and then cells were lysed in IP lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton-100, and protease inhibitors for 30 min. Anti-FLAG M2 affinity gels were adding to supernatants and incubated for 8 h. After incubation, beads were washed 3 times with lysis buffer and eluted by FLAG peptide. Protein samples were boiled in 5× loading buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. As for sequential immunoprecipitation, HEK293T cells were transfected with FLAG-ME1, GST-6PGD, and GFP-6PGD for 48 h. Anti-FLAG M2 affinity gels and glutathione beads were used in the first round IP and the second round IP, respectively. In addition, HEK293T cells were transfected with GST-6PGD, HA-ME1, and GFP-ME1 for 48 h. Glutathione beads and HA beads were used in the first round IP and the second round IP, respectively. The flux of PPP was measured based on the rate of glucose consumption and the ratio of 13C incorporated into lactate determined by LC-MS (16Rao X. Duan X. Mao W. Li X. Li Z. Li Q. Zheng Z. Xu H.

Briefly, cells were cultured in medium with or without 5 mm [1,2-13C2]glucose. After 12 h, medium was collected, and cells were treated with cold 80% methanol. Metabolites were extracted and analyzed by LC-MS. Flux analysis was performed on TSQ Quantiva Triple Quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) with positive/negative ion switching. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode was used for data acquisition. Mobile phase A was prepared by adding 2.376 ml of tributylamine and 0.858 ml of acetic acid to HPLC-grade water, then HPLC-grade water to a 1-liter volume. Mobile phase B was HPLC-grade methanol. Synergi Hydro-RP 100A column was used for polar metabolites separation with a column temperature at 35 °C. The measured mass isotopomer distributions were corrected for natural enrichments. For cell proliferation assay cells were seeded in 6-well cell culture dishes in triplicate at a density of 20,000 cells as indicated per well in 2 ml of medium containing 10% FBS. After the indicated days of culture, cells were counted using a Bio-Rad cell counter. For soft agar assay, cells were suspended in 1 ml of 10% FBS DMEM medium containing a 0.3% agarose and plated on a firm 0.6% agarose base in 6-well plates (5000 cells per well). Cells were then cultured in a 37 °C and 5% CO2 incubator for 2 weeks. Colonies were fixed and stained with 0.005% crystal violet (for 1 h) and visible colonies were counted. Surface plasmon resonance analysis was carried out at 25 °C with a Biacore T200 biomolecular interaction analysis system (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. FLAG-tagged 6PGD was immobilized on the surface of a CM5 sensor chip in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) and functioned as the stationary phase. As the mobile phase, purified His-ME1 protein flowed through the sensor chip surface at 8 different concentrations in a running buffer of PBS at a flow rate of 30 μl min−1. After each cycle of binding and dissociation, the surface was regenerated with 10 mm glycine (pH 2.0). The affinity parameters were analyzed by BIAcore T200 evaluation software. P.

Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs, the cytosolic RNA PRRs), RIG-I and MDA5, play pivotal roles in response to bunyavirus infections (20Wuerth J.D. Weber F.

MAVS recruits further members of the signal transduction cascade, including the crucial kinases, such as TBK1/IKKϵ and IKKα/IKKβ, which direct the activation of the transcription factors IRF3 and NF-κB, respectively (18Sun L.

The understanding of the viral factor(s) governing viral infectivity and pathogenicity is urgently required for the development of antiviral therapies and safe vaccines. As phleboviruses, SFTSV/HRTV-group viruses contain a tri-segmented negative-sense RNA genome. The large (L) and medium (M) segments of the genome encode the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the glycoprotein (GP) precursor, respectively, and the small segment (S) encodes the nucleoprotein (NP) and the nonstructural protein (NSs) by an ambisense coding strategy. Previous studies by us and others have shown that SFTSV antagonizes IFN induction by NSs hijacking of signaling molecules including a TBK1-IRF3 complex into NSs-induced inclusion bodies (IBs) (35Ning Y.J.

Virol. 2014; 88: 3067-3076Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar); however, whether and how HRTV can interfere with the host innate immune response is unknown. In this study we showed that HRTV NSs (HNSs) also functions as a robust antagonist of host innate immunity, thus promoting viral replication. Although its expression appears not to induce noticeable IB formation in multiple cell lines we tested, HNSs can inhibit RLR-mediated antiviral signaling and virus-infection-triggered IFN and inflammatory cytokine expression. Mechanistically, we found that HNSs disrupt the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) activation by interfering with IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation; furthermore, HNSs interact with TBK1 and likely hinder TBK1-IRF3 association, thus disabling IRF3 activation and IFN and cytokine induction. SNSs is localized to SNSs self-induced IBs potentially with versatile roles (35Ning Y.J. Wang M. Deng M. Shen S. Liu W. Cao W.C. Deng F. Wang Y.Y. Hu Z. Wang H. Viral suppression of innate immunity via spatial isolation of TBK1/IKKϵ from mitochondrial antiviral platform.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2014; 6: 324-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To elucidate the function of HNSs, we first compared the subcellular localization of HNSs and SNSs. HEK293 cells transfected with plasmids expressing SNSs or HNSs were fixed to visualize the localization of the viral proteins by laser confocal microscopy after immunofluorescence assays (IFA). Consistent with our previous studies (35Ning Y.J. Wang M. Deng M. Shen S. Liu W. Cao W.C. Deng F. Wang Y.Y. Hu Z. Wang H.

Virol. 2015; 89: 4227-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), SNSs remarkably induces the formation of cytoplasmic IBs where SNSs is located (Fig. 1A); however, intriguingly, HNSs is located diffusely in cytoplasm rather than in any noticeable IB-like structures. The distinct subcellular localization of these NSs proteins could also be observed in other cell types including HepG2 (human hepatocyte), HUVEC (human umbilical vein endothelial cell), HeLa (human cervical cancer cell), HEK293T (a variant of HEK293, human kidney cell), Huh7.5 (human hepatocyte), Vero (green monkey kidney cell), and H9c2 (rat cardiac mytoblast) (Fig. 1, B–D, and data not shown). Previous studies by us and others have shown that SNSs is a robust antagonist of type I IFN induction (35Ning Y.J. Wang M. Deng M. Shen S. Liu W. Cao W.C. Deng F. Wang Y.Y. Hu Z. Wang H.

To determine whether HNSs plays such a role, we examined the influence of HNSs expression on IFN-β promoter activation by viral infection with DLR assays. As shown in Fig. 2A, Sendai virus (SeV) infection strongly triggered IFN-β promoter activation, whereas this activation was significantly attenuated in the context of SNSs expression, consistent with the previous reports (35Ning Y.J. Wang M. Deng M. Shen S. Liu W. Cao W.C. Deng F. Wang Y.Y. Hu Z. Wang H. Viral suppression of innate immunity via spatial isolation of TBK1/IKKϵ from mitochondrial antiviral platform.J. Mol.

Evasion of antiviral immunity through sequestering of TBK1/IKKϵ/IRF3 into viral inclusion bodies.J. Virol. 2014; 88: 3067-3076Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Interestingly, expression of HNSs, but not HRTV NP (HNP), also resulted in a remarkable suppression of SeV-triggered IFN-β promoter activation, comparable with that mediated by SNSs (Fig. 2A, left and middle). Meanwhile, the expression of these viral proteins in the DLR assays was also monitored by Western blotting (WB) analyses, and a representative result was presented on the right panel of Fig. 2A showing the comparable expression levels of the viral proteins. These data suggest that, like SNSs, HNSs can also act as a potent antagonist of IFN induction. Furthermore, the effects of HNSs on virus-stimulated expression of IFNB1 and inflammatory cytokine gene RANTES were evaluated by real-time quantitative PCR analyses. As expected, HNSs significantly inhibited SeV-triggered expression of IFNB1 and RANTES (Fig. 2B), confirming the obstruction of the innate immune responses by HNSs. Wu et al. (39Wu X. Qi X. Liang M. Li C. Cardona C.J. Li D. Xing Z. Roles of viroplasm-like structures formed by nonstructural protein NSs in infection with severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus.FASEB J. 2014; 28: 2504-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) showed that SFTSV replication could be increased by the overexpression of SNSs. Given the capacity of HNSs to impair the innate immunity, we further explored whether HNSs expression can also bolster viral replication. HEK293 cells were transfected with the plasmids encoding HNSs or SNSs or the empty plasmid (vector), and at 24 h post transfection, the transfected cells were infected with SFTSV. At the indicated time points post infection, the titers of the infectious viruses in culture media were measured. As shown in Fig. 2C, the expression of both HNSs and SNSs substantially enhanced the replication of SFTSV, the representative virus of the SFTSV/HRTV-related virus group. These data suggest that HNSs is a functional analogue of SNSs and bolsters viral replication by counteracting the cellular antiviral responses and enhancing viral adaptation on host cells. IFN-β promoter contains several distinct regulatory domains to which specific transcription factors can bind (40Maniatis T. Falvo J.V. Kim T.H. Kim T.K. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Wathelet M.G. Structure and function of the interferon-β enhanceosome.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In response to viral infection, transcription factors IRF3 and NF-κB are of particular importance for IFN-β promoter activation. To identify the transcription factor-mediated signaling targeted by HNSs, we investigated the capacity of HNSs to interfere with the activation of the individual regulatory elements bound by IRF3 or NF-κB with DLR assays. Similar to SNSs, HNSs greatly suppressed SeV-induced activation of ISRE, the IRF3-binding element (Fig. 3A). In contrast, neither of the two NSs proteins exhibited such an inhibitory effect on the NF-κB-responsive element (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that HNSs likely specifically targets the ISRE activation to block IFN/cytokine induction by viral infection. Additionally, as a control, HNP did not noticeably affect the activation of both the transcription factor-responsive elements (Fig. 3, A and B), which is consistent with the observation that HNP did not interfere with the IFN-β promoter activation (Fig. 2A). During viral infection and in particular the early stage, IRF3 can be phosphorylated by the protein kinase TBK1 and subsequently translocated to nuclei as activated transcription factor (41Sato M. Tanaka N. Hata N. Oda E. Taniguchi T.

Biol. 1998; 18: 2986-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Given the targeting of ISRE activation by HNSs, we next examined the effects of HNSs on the activity of endogenous IRF3. HEK293 cells transfected with the HNSs expression plasmid or the control plasmid (vector) were mock infected or infected with SeV for 6 h followed by the detection of IRF3 phosphorylation with WB analyses. SeV infection led to a notable IRF3 phosphorylation, which, however, was diminished in cells transfected with the HNSs expression plasmid (Fig. 4A). Subsequently, the nuclear translocation of endogenous IRF3 was also assessed by IFA. HEK293 cells were transfected with the plasmids expressing EGFP-tagged HNSs (EGFP-HNSs) or EGFP alone (as the control), followed by SeV stimulation. As shown in Fig. 4, B and C, SeV infection remarkably triggered IRF3 translocation to nuclei regardless of EGFP expression. By contrast, the nuclear accumulation of IRF3 was substantially blocked in cells expressing EGFP-tagged HNSs (Fig. 4, B and C). Collectively, these findings indicate that HNSs prevents IRF3 signaling to repress ISRE activation and, hence, the induction of type I IFNs and other cytokines. IRF3 is a downstream molecule involved in the antiviral signaling mediated by RLRs that likely play important roles in the cellular recognition of bunyavirus infection (20Wuerth J.D. Weber F. Phleboviruses and the type I interferon response.Viruses. 2016; 8: E174Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 21Kell A.M. Gale Jr., M.

Bunyaviruses and the type I interferon system.Viruses. 2009; 1: 1003-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Considering the blockade of IRF3 signaling by HNSs, we tested the effects of HNSs on RLR signaling with DLR assays. The activation of IFN-β promoter by the overexpression of RIG-IN (a constitutively active form of RIG-I) or MDA5 was significantly reduced in cells transfected with the HNSs expression plasmid, even at a low transfection dosage (Fig. 5, A and B), suggesting that HNSs can efficiently block RLR signaling. Furthermore, we addressed the step of the antiviral signaling cascade targeted by HNSs. Signaling proteins downstream of RLRs including the adaptor MAVS, the kinase TBK1, and a constitutively active form of the transcription factor IRF3 (IRF3/5D) were next used to trigger IFN-β promoter activation. As shown in the following DLR assays, HNSs inhibited IFN-β promoter activation induced by the overexpression of MAVS and TBK1 (Fig. 5, C and D), suggesting that HNSs acts at the level of TBK1 or further downstream. However, IRF3/5D-induced activation of IFN-β promoter was not markedly affected by HNSs (Fig. 5E), indicat"

Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either a standard or energy-dense diet for six weeks prior to mating and throughout pregnancy and lactation. Male and female offspring were weaned onto normal diet on postnatal day (pnd) 21. Brains were collected on pnd 30 or 100 for qRT-PCR to determine Kiss1 mRNA levels. Maternal obesity increased Kiss1 mRNA expression in the MePD of pre-pubertal male and female offspring, whereas Kiss1 expression was not affected in the ARC or AVPV at this age. Maternal obesity reduced Kiss1 expression in all three brain regions of 3 month old female offspring, but only in MePD of males. The role of MePD kisspeptin on puberty, estrous cyclicity and preovulatory LH surges was assessed directly in a separate group of post-weanling and young adult female rats exposed to a normal diet throughout their life course. Bilateral intra-MePD cannulae connected to osmotic mini-pumps for delivery of kisspeptin receptor antagonist (Peptide 234 for 14 days) were chronically implanted on pnd 21 or 100. Antagonism of MePD kisspeptin delayed puberty onset, disrupted estrous cyclicity and reduced the incidence of LH surges. These data show that the MePD plays a key role in pubertal timing and ovulation and that maternal obesity may act via amygdala kisspeptin signaling to influence reproductive function in the offspring."
https://openalex.org/W2747302065,"Mitochondria are organelles indispensable for maintenance of cellular energy homeostasis. Most mitochondrial proteins are nuclearly encoded and are imported into the matrix compartment where they are properly folded. This process is facilitated by the mitochondrial heat shock protein 70 (mtHsp70), a chaperone contributing to mitochondrial protein quality control. The affinity of mtHsp70 for its protein clients and its chaperone function are regulated by binding of ATP/ADP to mtHsp70’s nucleotide-binding domain. Nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs) play a crucial role in exchanging ADP for ATP at mtHsp70’s nucleotide-binding domain, thereby modulating mtHsp70’s chaperone activity. A single NEF, Mge1, regulates mtHsp70’s chaperone activity in lower eukaryotes, but the mammalian orthologs are unknown. Here, we report that two putative NEF orthologs, GrpE-like 1 (GrpEL1) and GrpEL2, modulate mtHsp70’s function in human cells. We found that both GrpEL1 and GrpEL2 associate with mtHsp70 as a hetero-oligomeric subcomplex and regulate mtHsp70 function. The formation of this subcomplex was critical for conferring stability to the NEFs, helped fine-tune mitochondrial protein quality control, and regulated crucial mtHsp70 functions, such as import of preproteins and biogenesis of Fe–S clusters. Our results also suggested that GrpEL2 has evolved as a possible stress resistance protein in higher vertebrates to maintain chaperone activity under stress conditions. In conclusion, our findings support the idea that GrpEL1 has a role as a stress modulator in mammalian cells and highlight that multiple NEFs are involved in controlling protein quality in mammalian mitochondria.

Mitochondria are essential organelles involved in multiple aspects of physiological functions, including energy metabolism, redox homeostasis, apoptosis, and metabolic switch. The constitutive functions of mitochondria are regulated by a plethora of proteins, acting together to maintain cellular and organellar homeostasis. Although mitochondria contain their own genome, most of the mitochondrial proteins are nuclearly encoded and translocated inside the organelle through dedicated translocases present on the outer and inner membranes (1Bolender N.

Recent discoveries highlight moonlighting functions for various components of the mitochondrial protein transport machinery. Differential expression of DnaJC15, a cochaperone of mtHsp70 at the import motor, is responsible for altering the sensitivity of patients to chemotherapeutic drugs. A recent report has linked it as a modulator of cell death pathways through regulation of mitochondrial permeability transition (26Sinha D. D'Silva P.

Magmas, which regulates mtHsp70’s activity at the import channel, additionally functions as a reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulator and assists in maintenance of redox homeostasis (30Sinha D. Joshi N. Chittoor B. Samji P. D'Silva P. Role of Magmas in protein transport and human mitochondria biogenesis.Hum. Mol.

Magmas functions as a ROS regulator and provides cytoprotection against oxidative stress-mediated damages.Cell Death Dis. 2014; 5: e1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Interestingly, preliminary reports in yeast have shown that activity of the NEF Mge1 is sensitive to oxidative stress (33Marada A. Allu P.K. Murari A. PullaReddy B. Tammineni P. Thiriveedi V.R. Danduprolu J. Sepuri N.B. Mge1, a nucleotide exchange factor of Hsp70, acts as an oxidative sensor to regulate mitochondrial Hsp70 function.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2013; 24: 692-703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This further supports the view of high involvement of human NEFs in multiple pathways with potential moonlighting functions in mitochondria. Previous in vitro reconstitution studies have shown that GrpEL1 functions as a nucleotide exchange factor for mtHsp70 in humans that could replace ADP with ATP and promote mtHsp70 chaperone activity (34Goswami A.V. Chittoor B. D'Silva P. Understanding the functional interplay between mammalian mitochondrial Hsp70 chaperone machine components.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 19472-19482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in silico and experimental evidence from the mammalian system reveals the existence of a second mitochondrial NEF, GrpEL2 (35Naylor D.J. Stines A.P. Hoogenraad N.J. Høj P.B. Evidence for the existence of distinct mammalian cytosolic, microsomal, and two mitochondrial GrpE-like proteins, the co-chaperones of specific Hsp70 members.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21169-21177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This is an intriguing observation because other species except mammals encode for a single NEF for the mitochondrial function. Despite having two NEFs as cochaperones for mtHsp70 machinery, their specific role in fine-tuning import and folding pathways in the maintenance of organellar homeostasis in humans is still elusive. The current studies highlight the nucleotide exchange abilities of two NEFs, EL1 and EL2, in regulating human mtHsp70's function. The human NEFs showed significant difference in their complex organization as compared with the yeast NEF Mge1. Human NEFs EL1 and EL2 function as a heterosubcomplex at the import channel by stabilizing the aggregation-prone individual homo-oligomers. Strikingly, our findings reveal that EL2 has evolved as a stress resistance protein in higher vertebrates to regulate threshold mtHsp70 activity and thus modulates overall organellar function under stress conditions. Together, we propose that the interplay between the two human NEFs is utilized by the cell to regulate mitochondrial functions. The nucleotide exchange ability of EL1 for human mtHsp70 has been documented previously using purified proteins (34Goswami A.V. Chittoor B. D'Silva P.

Chem. 1998; 273: 21169-21177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A sequence alignment utilizing the UniProt database also proposed the existence of two NEF paralogs, EL1 and EL2, in human mitochondria in contrast to a single yeast ortholog, Mge1 (Fig. 1A). Sequence alignment of NEF homologs revealed that yeast Mge1 shares 39% identity with EL1 and 33% identity with EL2, whereas EL1 and EL2 share 45% sequence identity with each other (Fig. 1A). Foremost, to establish the physiological relevance of two NEF paralogs, the precise subcellular location of EL1 and EL2 in human cells was determined by microscopic analysis. Both EL1 and EL2 fused with C-terminal GFP tags were expressed separately in HeLa cells. The cells were cotransfected with mitochondrially targeted mtDsRed to counterstain the organelle. An overlap of GFP-EL1 fluorescence with mtDsRed marker establishes its mitochondrial localization (Fig. 1B). Similarly, the GFP-EL2 overlapped with red fluorescence of mtDsRed, indicating mitochondrial distribution of the protein (Fig. 1C). The cellular localization of EL1 and EL2 was further confirmed by an alternative approach using subcellular fractionation analysis. The mitochondrially enriched fraction was isolated, and the relative distribution of EL1 and EL2 was determined through Western blotting using protein-specific antibodies. The blot was probed with antibodies specific for different mitochondrial, nuclear, and cytosolic markers. Both EL1 and EL2 were enriched in the mitochondrial fraction along with another organelle-specific marker (Tim23), thereby confirming the mitochondrial localization of EL1 and EL2 (Fig. 1D). As negative controls, the blot was probed for marker proteins such as anti-GAPDH (cytosol), anti-cathepsin D (lysosome), anti-catalase (peroxisome), and anti-MCM3 antibody (nucleus) (Fig. 1D). To further establish the submitochondrial location of EL1 and EL2, the membrane and matrix fractions of mitochondria were separated using ultracentrifugation and immunoblotted using specific antibodies. Both EL1 and EL2 were separated in the matrix fraction similarly to Hep1, which served as control for matrix-targeted proteins, and membrane proteins Tim23 and Tim44 were probed as controls for inner membrane-associated proteins (Fig. 1E). The nucleotide exchange activity of NEF is dependent on a physical interaction with Hsp70 (22Voos W. Gambill B.D. Laloraya S. Ang D. Craig E.A. Pfanner N. Mitochondrial GrpE is present in a complex with hsp70 and preproteins in transit across membranes.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6627-6634Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To establish this, His6-GrpEL1 and His6-GrpEL2 proteins were affinity-purified to homogeneity using Ni-NTA chromatography (Fig. 1F). The purified proteins were also used to generate protein-specific antibodies. The specificity of the respective antibodies was further confirmed in the mitochondrial lysate, which showed a single band corresponding to protein EL1 or EL2 (Fig. 1G). To determine physical interaction between mtHsp70 and EL1 or EL2, in vitro coimmunoprecipitation (coIP) analysis was performed using purified EL1/EL2 and mtHsp70. Indeed, equimolar mixtures of EL1/EL2 and mtHsp70 resulted in coimmunoprecipitation of mtHsp70 with antibody specific for EL1 or EL2, thus indicating that both NEFs physically associate with mtHsp70 (Fig. 2, A and B). The relative affinity of interaction of EL1 and EL2 with mtHsp70 was estimated through biolayer interferometry. Both EL1 and EL2 interacted robustly with mtHsp70. The affinity of EL1 for mtHsp70 (KD = 39 nm) was comparable with the affinity of bacterial GrpE for DnaK (KD = 30 nm) (36Harrison C.J. Hayer-Hartl M. Di Liberto M. Hartl F. Kuriyan J. Crystal structure of the nucleotide exchange factor GrpE bound to the ATPase domain of the molecular chaperone DnaK.Science. 1997; 276: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). However, EL2 showed a 5-fold lower affinity for mtHsp70 (KD = 190 nm) (Fig. 2, C–E). The reduced affinity of EL2 is mainly attributed to an ∼4-fold slower dissociation rate (Koff) and ∼21-fold slower association rate (Kon) as compared with EL1 (Fig. 2, C–E). The mitochondrial import motor consists of chaperone mtHsp70 as the core component together with a heterodimer of cochaperones J-proteins/J-like proteins, NEF, and scaffold protein Tim44. Optimum activity of the mitochondrial import motor for the efficient translocation of precursor proteins requires synchronized recruitment of ATP-mtHsp70 and NEF on the Tim44 scaffold (23D'Silva P. Liu Q. Walter W. Craig E.A. Regulated interactions of mtHsp70 with Tim44 at the translocon in the mitochondrial inner membrane.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The presence of two NEFs in human mitochondria raises an important question, whether both NEF paralogs are recruited to the import site through interaction with mtHsp70, which is tethered to Tim23 channel via Tim44 scaffold. The mode of association of NEFs with the import channel was first assessed by testing whether the NEFs are recruited to the channel individually or as a heteromeric complex. To assess their recruitment to the import channel, a coIP analysis was performed using an anti-Tim44 antibody in the purified mitochondrial lysates. CoIP analysis of EL1/EL2 together with mtHsp70 and Tim44 suggested the recruitment of both NEFs to the mitochondrial import motor. Because interaction of NEF-mtHsp70-Tim44 complex is known to be ATP-sensitive in nature, the coIP was performed in the presence of 2 mm ATP. None of the import motor components were immunoprecipitated in the presence of hydrolyzable nucleotides (ATP), suggesting that co-recruitment of EL1-EL2 is very specific at the import channel. Peroxiredoxin 3, a mitochondrial matrix protein that is not a component of the human import motor, was probed as a negative control (Fig. 2F). The association of both EL1 and EL2 with the import channel suggests that both NEF paralogs are co-recruited to the import motor as homo- or heterosubcomplexes. To analyze the nature of their association, coIP was performed in the mitochondrial lysates by coexpressing hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged EL1 (EL1-HA) and FLAG-tagged EL2 (EL2-FLAG) at the C terminus. The coIP analysis was performed using an anti-HA antibody that showed the presence of both EL1-HA and EL2-FLAG together with mtHsp70 and Tim44. Addition of ATP in the immunoprecipitates resulted in the dissociation of mtHsp70 and Tim44, but the EL1-EL2 subcomplex remained stable, indicating that in humans the NEF paralogs associate with the import motor as a heterosubcomplex (Fig. 2G). To further validate the direct association between these two NEFs, EL1-HA and N-terminal His6-tagged EL2 (His6-EL2) were cloned in a bicistronic vector, pRSFduet, and expressed in Escherichia coli. The complex was purified from bacterial lysate using Ni-NTA chromatography followed by an ATP wash to remove any bacterial DnaK contamination. The EL1-EL2 complex was copurified to homogeneity as determined by SDS-PAGE, which showed the presence of a single band corresponding to ∼25 kDa (Fig. 2H). The complex was further resolved by native PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. Probing with anti-HA and anti-His antibodies resulted in detection of both EL1 and EL2 at a molecular size higher than that of their heterodimer or individual homodimer (Fig. 2I). Conversely, separation of the observed complex on a second dimension denaturing gel revealed the existence of both EL1 and EL2 as a part of a single subcomplex, which potentially existed in a higher-order oligomeric complex (Fig. 2J). In His tag-dependent affinity chromatography, the detection of HA tag is possible if the two proteins are physically interacting with each other. A direct physical interaction between EL1 and EL2, resulting from the formation of heterocomplex, was further established by biolayer interferometry using biotinylated EL1 as a ligand on a sensor chip. A robust interaction was observed as a function of time upon using two concentrations of EL2 as analyte (Fig. 2K). The oligomeric state of human NEFs was determined by size exclusion chromatography of purified proteins. The size exclusion experiment was performed in the presence of ATP to rule out any possible interference of residual bacterial DnaK. The purified individual proteins EL1 and EL2 and EL1-EL2 heterosubcomplex eluted as a higher molecular mass oligomeric complex (150–160 kDa), which is consistent with native and 2D SDS-PAGE results (Fig. 3A). The recruitment of EL1 and EL2 as a hetero-oligomer raises an important question, whether the heterosubcomplex retains the ability to function as an NEF in the chaperone cycle. The major function of NEFs is to replenish ATP by exchanging it with ADP at the nucleotide-binding site of mtHsp70 in a chaperone cycle. Therefore, the nucleotide exchange ability of EL1, EL2, and EL1-EL2 complex was assessed by monitoring the rate of ATP hydrolysis using radiolabeled [γ-32P]ATP-mtHsp70 complex under single turnover conditions. The inhibition of the [γ-32P]ATP hydrolysis rate due to exchange with unlabeled cold ATP was measured as the exchange activity of NEFs (34Goswami A.V. Chittoor B. D'Silva P.

In the presence of cold ATP, both EL1 and EL2 showed similar exchange activity and inhibited ATP hydrolysis at saturating concentrations (Fig. 3, B and C). However, at equivalent concentrations, EL1 retained better exchange activity as compared with EL2 due to its higher affinity for mtHsp70. Stoichiometric association of both NEFs as a h"

Lifestyle and health behavior changes play an important role in the primary and secondary prevention of ACS recurrence. Changes in unhealthy lifestyles after an acute coronary event have been analyzed by considering separate behaviors individually, even though research on the healthy population has demonstrated that unhealthy behaviors tend to co-occur. Purpose The aim of this study was to identify lifestyle profiles of ACS patients and to explore their pathways of change for one year after their first coronary event by adopting a typological approach. Methods Two hundred and twenty-three patients (84% male; mean age = 57.14) completed self-report measures of health-related behaviors at the beginning of cardiac rehabilitation, and six months and twelve months after. At each wave depression, anxiety and heart rate were also evaluated. Cluster analysis was performed to identify lifestyle profiles and to analyze their change over time. Differences in psychological factors and heart rate among clusters were assessed. Results Patients' diet, physical activity, and smoking behavior greatly improved six months after their first coronary event. No further improvements were detected after one year. At each wave specific lifestyle profiles were identified, ranging from more maladaptive to healthier clusters. Patients with multiple unhealthy behaviors experience greater difficulties in maintaining a healthier lifestyle over time. Moreover, the results demonstrated the association between lifestyle profiles at twelve months after the acute coronary event and depression measured six months earlier. Finally, the most maladaptive lifestyle profile had many members with elevated heart rate at twelve months after the cardiac rehabilitation. Conclusions Current findings may have a strong practical impact in the development and implementation of personalized secondary prevention programs targeting lifestyles of ACS patients."
https://openalex.org/W2752245670,"Studies have reported that some animals, including humans, can taste mixtures of glucose oligomers (i.e., maltooligosaccharides, MOS) and that their detection is independent of the known T1R2/T1R3 sweet taste receptor. In an effort to understand potential mechanisms underlying the taste perception of glucose oligomers in humans, this study was designed to investigate: 1) the variability of taste sensitivity to MOS with low degree-of-polymerization (DP), and 2) the potential role of hT1R2/T1R3 in the MOS taste detection. To address these objectives, a series of food grade, narrow-DP-range MOS were first prepared (DP 3, 3–4, 5–6, and 6–7) by fractionating disperse saccharide mixtures. Subjects were then asked to discriminate these MOS stimuli as well as glucose (DP 1) and maltose (DP 2) from blanks after the stimuli were swabbed on the tongue. All stimuli were presented at 75 mM with and without a sweet taste inhibitor (lactisole). An α-glucosidase inhibitor (acarbose) was added to all test stimuli to prevent oral digestion of glucose oligomers. Results showed that all six stimuli were detected with similar discriminability in normal tasting conditions. When the sweet receptor was inhibited, DP 1, 2, and 3 were not discriminated from blanks. In contrast, three higher-DP paired MOS stimuli (DP 3–4, 5–6, and 6–7) were discriminated from blanks at a similar degree. Overall, these results support the presence of a sweet-independent taste perception mechanism that is stimulated by MOS greater than three units."
https://openalex.org/W2747047497,"Introduction Hot flashes have been postulated to be linked to systemic inflammation. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between hot flashes, pro-inflammatory factors, and leukocytes in healthy, non-obese postmenopausal women. Participants and design In this cross-sectional study, a total of 202 women aged 45–60 years were stratified into one of four groups according to their hot-flash status: never experienced hot flashes (Group N), mild hot flashes (Group m), moderate hot flashes (Group M), and severe hot flashes (Group S). Variables measured in this study included clinical parameters, hot flash experience, leukocytes, and fasting plasma levels of nine circulating cytokines/chemokines measured by using multiplex assays. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the associations of hot flashes with these pro-inflammatory factors. Settings The study was performed in a hospital medical center. Results The mean values of leukocyte number were not different between these four groups. The hot flash status had a positive tendency toward increased levels of circulating IL-6 (P-trend = 0.049), IL-8 (P-trend < 0.001), TNF-α (P-trend = 0.008), and MIP1β (P-trend = 0.04). Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that hot-flash severity was significantly associated with IL-8 (P-trend < 0.001) and TNFα (P-trend = 0.007) among these nine cytokines/chemokines after adjustment for age, menopausal duration, BMI and FSH. Multivariate analysis further revealed that severe hot flashes were strongly associated with a higher IL-8 (% difference, 37.19%; 95% confidence interval, 14.98,63.69; P < 0.001) and TNFα (51.27%; 6.64,114.57; P < 0.05). Conclusion The present study provides evidence that hot flashes are associated with circulating IL-8 and TNF-α in healthy postmenopausal women. It suggests that hot flashes might be related to low-grade systemic inflammation."

Design Cross-sectional analysis of national early infant diagnosis (EID) database. Methods 365,841 Kenyan infants were tested for HIV from January 2007-July 2015 and results, demographics, and treatment information were entered into a national database. HIV risk factors were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. Results 11.1% of infants tested HIV positive in 2007–2010 and 6.9% in 2014–2015. Greater odds of infection were observed in females (OR: 1.08; 95% CI:1.05–1.11), older children (18–24 months vs. 6 weeks-2 months: 4.26; 95% CI:3.87–4.69), infants whose mothers received no PMTCT intervention (vs. HAART OR: 1.92; 95% CI:1.79–2.06), infants receiving no prophylaxis (vs. nevirapine for 6 weeks OR: 2.76; 95% CI:2.51–3.05), and infants mixed breastfed (vs. exclusive breastfeeding OR: 1.39; 95% CI:1.30–1.49). In 2014–2015, 9.1% of infants had mothers who were not on treatment during pregnancy, 9.8% were not on prophylaxis, and 7.0% were mixed breastfed. Infants exposed to all three risky practices had a seven-fold higher odds of HIV infection compared to those exposed to recommended practices. The highest yield of HIV-positive infants were found through targeted testing of symptomatic infants in pediatric/outpatient departments (>15%); still, most infected infants were identified through PMTCT programs. Conclusion Despite impressive gains in Kenya’s PMTCT program, some HIV-infected infants present late and are not benefitting from PMTCT best practices. Efforts to identify these early and enforce evidence-based practice for PMTCT should be scaled up. Infant testing should be expanded in pediatric/outpatient departments, given high yields in these portals."

We asked whether the interaction between B cells and pDCs stimulated with RNA-containing immune complexes affects peripheral B cell subsets. Methods B cells and pDCs were isolated from blood of healthy individuals and stimulated with immune complexes consisting of SLE-IgG and U1snRNP (RNA-IC). Expression of cell surface molecules as well as IL-6 and IL-10 production were determined by flow cytometry and immunoassays. Gene expression profiles were determined by a NanoString nCounter expression array. Results We found a remarkable increase of double negative CD27-IgD- B cells, from 7% within fresh CD19+ B cells to 37% in the RNA-IC-stimulated co-cultures of B cells and pDCs, comparable to the frequency of double negative B cells in SLE patients. Gene expression analysis of the double negative CD27-IgD- and the CD27+IgD- memory B cells revealed that twenty-one genes were differentially expressed between the two B cell subsets (≥ 2-fold, p<0.001). The, IL21R, IL4R, CCL4, CCL3, CD83 and the IKAROS Family Zinc Finger 2 (IKZ2) showed higher expression in the double negative CD27-IgD- B cells. Conclusion The interactions between B cells and pDCs together with RNA-containing IC led to an expansion of B cells with similar phenotype as seen in SLE, suggesting that the pDC-B cell crosstalk contributes to the autoimmune feed-forward loop in SLE."

Methods Four groups of patients were recruited. Group1 included 22 feet of 11 healthy controls (age 48.6 years), Group2 included 36 feet of 28 RA patients with deformed non-operated feet (age 64.8 years, Disease activity score assessing 28 joints with CRP [DAS28-CRP] 2.3), Group3 included 27 feet of 20 RA patients with metatarsal head resection-replacement arthroplasty (age 60.7 years, post-operative duration 5.6 years, DAS28-CRP 2.4), and Group4 included 34 feet of 29 RA patients with metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint-preserving arthroplasty (age 64.6 years, post-operative duration 3.2 years, DAS28-CRP 2.3). Patients were cross-sectionally examined by F-SCAN II to evaluate walking plantar pressure, and the self-administered foot evaluation questionnaire (SAFE-Q). Twenty joint-preserving arthroplasty feet were longitudinally examined at both pre- and post-operation. Results In the 1st MTP joint, Group4 showed higher pressure distribution (13.7%) than Group2 (8.0%) and Group3 (6.7%) (P<0.001). In the 2nd-3rd MTP joint, Group4 showed lower pressure distribution (9.0%) than Group2 (14.5%) (P<0.001) and Group3 (11.5%) (P<0.05). On longitudinal analysis, Group4 showed increased 1st MTP joint pressure (8.5% vs. 14.7%; P<0.001) and decreased 2nd-3rd MTP joint pressure (15.2% vs. 10.7%; P<0.01) distribution. In the SAFE-Q subscale scores, Group4 showed higher scores than Group3 in pain and pain-related scores (84.1 vs. 71.7; P<0.01) and in shoe-related scores (62.5 vs. 43.1; P<0.01). Conclusions Joint-preserving arthroplasty resulted in higher 1st MTP joint and lower 2nd-3rd MTP joint pressures than resection-replacement arthroplasty, which were associated with better patient-based outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2753667670,"Objective Atherosclerosis is exaggerated in African American (AA) systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, with doubled cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk compared to White patients. The extent to which common Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) risk alleles (RA) contribute to this trend is unknown. This retrospective cohort study assessed prevalent atherosclerotic disease across APOL1 genotypes in AA SLE patients. Methods One hundred thirteen AA SLE subjects were APOL1-genotyped and stratified as having: zero risk alleles, one risk allele, or two risk alleles. Chart review assessed CVD manifestations including abdominal aortic aneurysm, angina, carotid artery disease, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, and vascular calcifications. Associations between the genotypes and a composite endpoint defined as one or more CVD manifestations were calculated using logistic regression. Symptomatic atherosclerotic disease, excluding incidental vascular calcifications, was also assessed. Results The 0-risk-allele, 1-risk-allele and 2-risk-allele groups, respectively, comprised 34%, 53%, and 13% of the cohort. Respectively, 13.2%, 41.7%, and 60.0% of the 0-risk allele, 1-risk-allele, and 2-risk-allele groups met the composite endpoint of atherosclerotic CVD (p = 0.001). Adjusting for risk factors–including smoking, ESRD, BMI >25 and hypertension–we observed an association between carrying one or more RA and atherosclerotic CVD (OR = 7.1; p = 0.002). For symptomatic disease, the OR was 3.5 (p = 0.02). In a time-to-event analysis, the proportion of subjects free from the composite primary endpoint, symptomatic atherosclerotic CVD, was higher in the 0-risk-allele group compared to the 1-risk-allele and 2-risk-allele groups (χ2 = 6.5; p = 0.04). Conclusions Taken together, the APOL1 RAs associate with prevalent atherosclerotic CVD in this cohort of AA SLE patients, perhaps reflecting a potentiating effect of SLE on APOL1-related cardiovascular phenotypes."

This work focuses on the physicochemical evaluation of faveleira oil, as well as it investigates the bioactive properties of faveleira seeds, faveleira oil and the press cake obtained during the oilseed processing. The seeds were cold pressed and the following tests were performed: physicochemical characteristics (acidity, peroxide values, moisture and volatile matter, density and viscosity) and fatty acid profile of faveleira oil; total phenolic and flavonoid content of faveleira seed and press cake; antibacterial activity of seed, oil and press cake; and antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging activity, reducing power assay, total antioxidant capacity, superoxide radical scavenging assay and oxygen radical absorbance capacity) of seed, oil and press cake. Our work demonstrated that the faveleira seed oil has low acidity (0.78 ± 0.03% oleic acid) and peroxide value (1.13 ± 0.12 mEq/1000g), associated with the relevant concentration of linoleic acid (53.56%). It was observed that important phenolics (398.89 ± 6.34 mg EAG/100 g), especially flavonoids (29.81 ± 0.71 mg RE/g) remain in the press cake, which indicates that the by-product of the faveleira oilseed production constitutes a rich residual source of bioactive compounds. No bacterial growth inhibition was detected, but all samples including faveleira seeds, press cake, oil and its fractions have potent antioxidant activities, mainly the press cake, with oxygen radical absorbance capacity of 28.39 ± 4.36 μM TE/g. Our results also show that faveleira oil has potential to be used as edible oil and the press cake should be used to contain the most antioxidants from seed."

We report here that seaweed-derived fucan activates cells expressing human Dectin-1 but not mouse Dectin-1. Low-valency β-glucan components within fucan appeared to be responsible for this activation, as the ligand activity was eliminated by β-glucanase treatment. The low-valency β-glucan laminarin also acted as an agonist for human Dectin-1 but not for mouse Dectin-1, whereas the high-valency β-glucan curdlan activated both human and mouse Dectin-1. Reciprocal mutagenesis analysis revealed that the ligand-binding domain of human Dectin-1 does not determine its unique sensitivity to low-valency β-glucan. Rather, we found that its intracellular domain renders human Dectin-1 reactive to low-valency β-glucan ligand. Substitution with two amino acids, Glu2 and Pro5, located in the human Dectin-1 intracellular domain was sufficient to confer sensitivity to low-valency β-glucan in mouse Dectin-1. Conversely, the introduction of mouse-specific amino acids, Lys2 and Ser5, to human Dectin-1 reduced the reactivity to low-valency β-glucan.

Dectin-1 is a type II transmembrane protein expressed by myeloid cells and consists of an extracellular carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) and a cytoplasmic domain containing an ITAM-like motif (hemITAM). Upon recognition of multivalent β-glucan via its CRD, Dectin-1 multimerizes and is phosphorylated at a tyrosine residue in the hemITAM, providing a binding site for the Syk kinase. The recruited Syk then activates the CARD9-Bcl10-MALT1 and NF-κB pathways to induce inflammatory cytokines, co-stimulatory molecules, and dendritic cell maturation, which promotes Th1 and Th17 responses to orchestrate immunity to pathogens (7LeibundGut-Landmann S.

Hence, Dectin-1 agonists hold potential as vaccine adjuvants that may facilitate protective immune responses against pathogens or cancer in mouse models and human patients. Given this potential, it is important to characterize in detail the function of human Dectin-1 in comparison with the evidences accumulating for the more extensively studied mouse Dectin-1 (10Taylor P.R.

The inconsistency within studies on the “low-valency” Dectin-1 ligand may be partly due to interspecies difference of Dectin-1. In addition, the function of the cytoplasmic domain, other than its identity as a hemITAM, is not well-characterized. In this study, we found that low-valency β-glucan can activate cells expressing human Dectin-1, but not mouse Dectin-1. Reciprocal mutagenesis studies revealed that the intracellular domain of human Dectin-1 confers this activity. Furthermore, we found that two intracellular amino acids, which are conserved in primates, play a critical role for enhancing the sensitivity of Dectin-1 independently of the hemITAM. To search for novel CLRs that recognize natural polysaccharides, we employed nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT)-GFP reporter cells expressing various CLRs. After screening several candidates, we found a seaweed-derived, fucose-containing polysaccharide called fucan activated reporter cells expressing human Dectin-1 (hDectin-1) (Fig. 1). Indeed, hDectin-1 induced reporter activity in response to fucan in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). A hDectin-1 isoform lacking the stalk region (hDectin-1B) similarly responded to fucan (supplemental Fig. S1). However, fucan did not activate cells expressing either forms of mouse Dectin-1 (mDectin-1) (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S1). In contrast, curdlan, a high-molecular weight β-1,3-glucan, comparably activated the reporter for either hDectin-1 or mDectin-1 (Fig. 2B). From these observations, we initially hypothesized that hDectin-1 but not mDectin-1 binds to fucan.Figure 2Fucan activates 2B4 NFAT-GFP reporter cells expressing hDectin-1 but not mDectin-1. A and B, 2B4 NFAT-GFP reporter cells transduced without (Syk) or with hDectin-1 or mDectin-1 were stimulated with the indicated concentration of fucan (A) or curdlan (B) for 18 h and expression of GFP analyzed by flow cytometry. All data are presented as the mean ± S.D., and representative results from three independent experiments with similar results are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As β-1,3-glucan is a well-established component recognized by Dectin-1 (4Brown G.D. Gordon S. Immune recognition: a new receptor for β-glucans.Nature. 2001; 413: 36-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar), we next examined whether treatment with Westase, a β-1,3- and β-1,6-glucanase, eliminates the activity of fucan. As expected, Westase treatment completely suppressed the ability of curdlan to activate cells via hDectin-1 and mDectin-1 (Fig. 3A, left). Likewise, fucan treated with this enzyme failed to activate cells expressing hDectin-1 (Fig. 3A, right), suggesting that β-glucan-like components included in fucan are responsible for this activity. Size-exclusion separation revealed that the ligand activity was detected in low-molecular weight fractions (supplemental Fig. S2). We therefore characterized the species-specific ligand activity of laminarin, low-molecular weight β-glucan derived from brown seaweed. As with fucan, laminarin activated the reporter cells expressing hDectin-1, but not mDectin-1, and this activity was sensitive to Westase (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that low-valency, soluble β-glucans may selectively activate cells via hDectin-1 but not mDectin-1. As the CRD of Dectin-1 mediates direct ligand binding (16Adachi Y. Ishii T. Ikeda Y. Hoshino A. Tamura H. Aketagawa J. Tanaka S. Ohno N. Characterization of β-glucan recognition site on C-type lectin, dectin 1.Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 4159-4171Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), we initially suspected that the slightly different amino acid sequences within the CRDs comparing hDectin-1 and mDectin-1 might determine the reactivity to soluble β-glucan. To address this possibility, we generated a chimeric mDectin-1 protein harboring the CRD from hDectin-1 (mDectin-1hCRD chimera) (Fig. 4A). Contrary to our initial assumption, the reporter cells expressing the mDectin-1hCRD chimera were not activated by laminarin similar to mDectin-1-bearing cells (Fig. 4B, mD1hCRD), although they showed substantial activity upon stimulation with high-valency curdlan (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that the direct ligand-binding domain, CRD, is not responsible for determining laminarin sensitivity to hDectin-1. We therefore created a hDectin-1 chimera harboring the CRD from mDectin-1 (hDectin-1mCRD) and found that the combination of mouse CRD and human non-CRD acted as a functional activating receptor for laminarin (Fig. 4B, hD1mCRD), suggesting that mouse CRD is capable of recognizing low-valency β-glucan. Indeed, fluorescence-labeled laminarin did bind to mDectin-1 as well as hDectin-1 (supplemental Fig. S3). Furthermore, soluble Ig-fusion protein derived from mDectin-1 and hDectin-1 showed comparable binding to laminarin (Fig. 4D). Taken together, these findings suggest that the non-CRD region of hDectin-1 confers the sensitivity to laminarin. Given the observation that mDectin-1 binds low-valency β-glucan but is unable to deliver activating signaling, we next examined whether these ligands act as antagonists for mDectin-1. To assess this, we added a graded amount of fucan or laminarin to mDectin-1 cells in the presence of suboptimal concentrations of a high-valency ligand zymosan. Indeed, both ligands suppressed mDectin-1-induced reporter activation (Fig. 5A), in sharp contrast to their agonistic effects on hDectin-1 (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that low-valency β-glucan acts oppositely on mDectin-1 and hDectin-1. As the stalk region of hDectin-1 is dispensable for the reactivity to fucan and laminarin (supplemental Fig. S1A), we next focused on the cytoplasmic domain of hDectin-1. To this end, we generated a series of chimeric mDectin-1 proteins in which each region of the cytoplasmic domain was replaced with the corresponding region of hDectin-1 (Fig. 6A). In contrast to full-length (WT) mDectin-1, mDectin-1 possessing 30 amino acids of the human N-terminal region (mDectin-1hN30) normally responded to laminarin (Fig. 6, B and C). Further chimeric analysis revealed that as little as a 10-amino acid sequence at the N terminus of hDectin-1 (mDectin-1hN10) was sufficient to confer reactivity to low-valency β-glucan to mDectin-1 (Fig. 6B). Within the 10-amino acid N-terminal sequence, hDectin-1 differs from mDectin-1 in four residues: Glu2, Pro5, Asp6, and Leu7 (Fig. 7A). We therefore individually substituted these 4 amino acids of mDectin-1 with the corresponding human-specific residues (Fig. 7B). Mutants carrying the combination of K2E and S5P substitutions selectively responded to laminarin (Fig. 7C, mD1K2E/S5P/H6D/I7L, mD1K2E/S5P/I7L, mD1K2E/S5P/H6D, and mD1K2E/S5P). Conversely, the introduction of mouse-specific Lys2 and Ser5 substitutions into hDectin-1 (hDectin-1E2K/P5S) resulted in the reduction of its reporter activity against laminarin (supplemental Fig. S4). Taken together, these results suggest that two amino acids derived from mDectin-1, Lys2 and Ser5, are critical for “desensitizing” Dectin-1 to low-valency β-glucan. The importance of these 2 amino acids are also supported by Dectin-1 derived from another species, rat. Although rat Dectin-1 (rDectin-1) shares high homology with mDectin-1, it uniquely lacks the N-terminal 9-amino acid sequence that contains Lys2 and Ser5 in mouse (Fig. 8, A and B, and supplemental Fig. S7). In the reporter cell assay, rDectin-1 was found to respond well to laminarin (Fig. 8, C and D), supporting our idea that inactivation of Lys2 and Ser5 may sensitize Dectin-1 to low-valency β-glucan.Figure 8Rat Dectin-1 activates reporter cells in response to laminarin.

All data are representative results from two independent experiments with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm the observed hDectin-1-specific phenomenon using primary cells, we finally compared the reactivity of human and murine myeloid cells to low-valency Dectin-1 ligand in a non-biased manner by stimulating human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (hMoDCs) and mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (mBMDCs) with laminarin. Laminarin potently activated hMoDCs to induce a set of inflammatory genes including IL1B, IL1A, and CLEC4E, which are reportedly induced by CLR-mediated signaling (17Steele C. Rapaka R.R. Metz A.

Med. 2009; 206: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In contrast, the majority of mouse orthologues of genes up-regulated in hMoDCs did not show substantial induction in mBMDCs (Fig. 9). Note that mBMDCs constitutively expressed Dectin-1 (see GSE98814 and GSE98825), and responded normally to other stimuli, such as LPS (supplemental Fig. S5). Collectively, these data support the idea that hDectin-1, but not mDectin-1, is an activating receptor for low-valency β-glucan. In this study, we report that hDectin-1 responds to low-valency β-glucan and its cytoplasmic region is critical for this function. Within the cytoplasmic N terminus, we show that Glu2 of hDectin-1 is one of the critical residues controlling the sensitivity of hDectin-1 to low-valency β-glucan, as a substitution of a mouse-specific residue in this position (hDectin-1E2K) impaired this activity. It appears that it is important that the residue at position 2 be a “non-Lys” residue, as substitutions to other residues did not reduce the activity (hDectin-1E2A or hDectin-1E2D) (supplemental Fig. S6). In line with these observations, Lys residues of mDectin-1 are reported to undergo ubiquitination, which results in the degradation and desensitization of mDectin-1 upon ligand binding (19Xiao Y. Tang J. Guo H. Zhao Y. Tang R. Ouyang S. Zeng Q. Rappleye C.A. Rajaram M.V. Schlesinger L.S. Tao L. Brown G.D. Langdon W.Y. Li B.T. Zhang J. Targeting CBLB as a potential therapeutic approach for disseminated candidiasis.Nat. Med. 2016; 22: 906-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, the inactivation of the Lys2 residue might be one of the reasons that sensitize hDectin-1. Meanwhile, the precise role of hDectin-1 Pro5, which is conserved in primates, is not yet clear. The reciprocal single substitution (mDectin-1S5P and hDectin-1P5S) had no impact (Fig. 7 and data not shown), whereas mDectin-1 carrying the double mutation (mDectin-1K2E/S5P) was active, suggesting that Pro5 renders hDectin-1 sensitive, albeit it is not sufficient in and of itself. One potential explanation is that mouse Ser5, which is conserved in most non-primates mammals (supplemental Fig. S7), may act to reduce the receptor signaling by promoting protein modification as Ser phosphorylation is linked to ubiquitination in several signaling molecules (20Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U.

Alternatively, Ser5 may interfere with the function of hemITAM through phosphorylation or other modifications. Indeed, phosphorylation of the Ser residue in the cytoplasmic region of FcRγ and Igα is reported to inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of their own ITAMs, which then inhibits downstream signaling (23Shah S. Gibson A.W. Ji C. Darrington E. Mobley J. Kojima K. Edberg J.C. Kimberly R.P. Regulation of FcRγ function by site-specific serine phosphorylation.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2017; 101: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 24Müller R. Wienands J. Reth M. The serine and threonine residues in the Ig-α cytoplasmic tail negatively regulate immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif-mediated signal transduction.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 8451-8454Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). More detailed analysis is needed to clarify whether Pro5 (human) cancels the negative function of Ser5 (mouse), or, alternatively, actively promotes downstream signaling. From the analysis of the phylogenic comparisons, one could speculate that “elimination” of Lys2 and Ser5 by substitution (human) or truncation (rat) (Fig. 8A and supplemental Fig. S7) might be a common strategy to increase the sensitivity of Dectin-1 to low-valency β-glucan during evolution. In support of this idea, the 5′-UTR of the mRNA for rDectin-1 contains a sequence corresponding to the Ser5 found in mice (Fig. 8A), suggesting that Ser5 is preserved as a relic in rDectin-1, which has been inactivated by the introduction of a downstream start codon, as speculated in other immune receptors (25Arase H. Lanier L.L. Specific recognition of virus-infected cells by paired NK receptors.Rev. Med. Virol. 2004; 14: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Despite the different sensitivities to low-valency β-glucan, the various Dectin-1 mutants used in this study retained substantial reactivities to curdlan. This suggests that Dectin-1, like other ITAM-coupled receptors such as the TCR and BCR, has the capacity to sense the quality of ligand. Recently, another CLR, mMincle and hMincle, recognize different ligands and induce distinct responses (26Kiyotake R. Oh-Hora M. Ishikawa E. Miyamoto T. Ishibashi T. Yamasaki S.

Chem. 2014; 289: 15405-15412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that the CLR family members might have modulated their sensitivities and ligand spectrums during evolution to adapt to their environment, an idea that warrants further investigation. Thus, the role of Dectin-1 in fungal infection characterized by use of gene-deficient mice (10Taylor P.R. Tsoni S.V. Willment J.A. Dennehy K.M. Rosas M. Findon H. Haynes K. Steele C. Botto M.

These findings demonstrate that the therapeutic approaches targeted to Dectin-1 requires re-evaluation of its functions in vivo by generating models expressing hDectin-1 in future studies.

https://openalex.org/W2747235100,"Programmed cell death (PCD) is a prerequisite for successful development and it limits the spread of biotrophic pathogens in a rapid hypersensitive response at the site of infection. KDEL-tailed cysteine endopeptidases (KDEL CysEP) are a subgroup of papain-type cysteine endopeptidases expressed in tissues undergoing PCD. In Arabidopsis, three KDEL CysEPs (AtCEP1, AtCEP2, and AtCEP3) are expressed. We have previously shown that AtCEP1 is a factor of basal resistance to powdery mildew caused by the biotrophic ascomycete Erysiphe cruciferarum, and is expressed in spatiotemporal association with the late fungal development on Arabidopsis leaves. The endoplasmic reticulum-localized proenzyme of AtCEP1 was further visualized at the haustorial complex encased with callose. The AtCPR5 gene (CONSTITUTIVE EXPRESSION OF PR GENES 5) is a regulator of expression of pathogenesis related genes. Loss of AtCPR5 leads to spontaneous expression of chlorotic lesions which was associated with enhanced expression of AtCEP1. We used the atcpr5-2 mutant plants and the atcep1 atcpr5-2 double mutants harboring a non-functional reporter (PCEP1::pre-pro-3xHA-EGFP-KDEL) for visualization of AtCEP1 promoter activity. We found the specific up-regulation of AtCEP1 in direct neighborhood of spreading leaf lesions thus likely representing cells undergoing PCD. Furthermore, we found a strong resistance of atcpr5 mutant plants against infection with E. cruciferarum. Loss of AtCEP1 had no obvious influence on the strong resistance of atcpr5-2 mutant plants against infection with E. cruciferarum. However, the area of necrotic leaf lesions associated with E. cruciferarum colonies was significantly larger in atcpr5-2 as compared to atcep1 atcpr5-2 double mutant plants. The presence of AtCEP1 thus contributes to AtCPR5-controlled PCD at the sites of powdery mildew infection."
https://openalex.org/W2749866978,"Background Fourth generation assays detect simultaneously antibodies for HIV and the p24 antigen, identifying HIV infection earlier than previous generation tests. Previous studies have shown that the Alere Determine HIV-1/2 Combo has lower than anticipated performance in detecting antibodies for HIV and the p24 antigen. Furthermore, there are currently very few studies evaluating the performance of Standard Diagnostics BIOLINE HIV Ag/Ab Combo. Objective To evaluate the performance of the Alere Determine HIV-1/2 Combo and the Standard Diagnostics BIOLINE HIV Ag/Ab Combo in a panel of frozen serum samples. Study design The testing panel included 133 previously frozen serum specimens from the UCLA Clinical Microbiology & Immunoserology laboratory. Reference testing included testing for HIV antibodies by a 3rd generation enzyme immunoassay followed by HIV RNA detection. Antibody negative and RNA positive sera were also tested by a laboratory 4th generation HIV Ab/Ag enzyme immunoassay. Results Reference testing yielded 97 positives for HIV infection and 36 negative samples. Sensitivity of the Alere test was 95% (88–98%), while the SD Bioline sensitivity was 91% (83–96%). Both assays showed 100% (90–100%) specificity. No indeterminate or invalid results were recorded. Among 13 samples with acute infection (HIV RNA positive, HIV antibody negative), 12 were found positive by the first assay and 8 by the second. The antigen component of the Alere assay detected 10 acute samples, while the SD Bioline assay detected only one. Conclusions Both rapid assays showed very good overall performance in detecting HIV infection in frozen serum samples, but further improvements are required to improve the performance in acute infection."
https://openalex.org/W2747959511,"Losing a species from a community can cause further extinctions, a process also known as coextinction. The risk of being extirpated with an interaction partner is commonly inferred from a species’ host-breadth, derived from observing interactions between species. But observational data suffers from imperfect detection, making coextinction estimates highly unreliable. To address this issue and to account for data uncertainty, we fit a hierarchical N-mixture model to individual-level interaction data from a mutualistic network. We predict (1) with how many interaction partners each species interacts (to indicate their coextinction risk) and (2) how completely the community was sampled. We fit the model to simulated interactions to investigate how variation in sampling effort, interaction probability, and animal abundances influence model accuracy and apply it to an empirical dataset of flowering plants and their insect visitors. The model performed well in predicting the number of interaction partners for scenarios with high abundances, but indicated high parameter uncertainty for networks with many rare species. Yet, model predictions were generally closer to the true value than the observations. Our mutualistic plant-insect community most closely resembled the scenario of high interaction rates with low abundances. Median estimates of interaction partners were frequently much higher than the empirical data indicate, but uncertainty was high. Our analysis suggested that we only detected 14-59% of the flower-visiting insect species, indicating that our study design, which is common for pollinator studies, was inadequate to detect many species. Imperfect detection strongly affects the inferences from observed interaction networks and hence, host specificity, specialisation estimates and network metrics from observational data may be highly misleading for assessing a species’ coextinction risks. Our study shows how models can help to estimate coextinction risk, but also indicates the need for better data (i.e., intensified sampling and individual-level observations) to reduce uncertainty."

Methods Using standardized practices, we searched Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection (WoSCC) (indexes: Science Citation Index-Expanded [SCIE], & Social Science Citation Index [SSCI]) and Scopus (areas: Health Sciences, Life Sciences, & Social Sciences and Humanities) to identify a large sample of articles related to EDs. We then submitted our sample of articles to bibliometric and graph theory analyses to identify co-authorship and social network patterns. Results We present a large number of detailed findings, including a clear pattern of scientific growth measured as number of publications per five-year period or quinquennium (Q), a tremendous increase in the number of authors attracted by the ED subject, and a very high and steady growth in collaborative work. Conclusions We inferred that the noted publication growth was likely driven by the noted increase in the number of new authors per Q. Social network analyses suggested that collaborations within ED follow patters of interaction that are similar to well established and recognized disciplines, as indicated by the presence of a “giant cluster”, high cluster density, and the replication of the “small world” phenomenon—the principle that we are all linked by short chains of acquaintances."
https://openalex.org/W2752436416,"Artificial reefs, in the Eastern Mediterranean (Cyprus,) became a popular and frequently used tool, in fisheries and biodiversity conservation management. Even though evaluation studies about the efficacy of artificial reefs are plentiful in the rest of the Mediterranean (Central and Western), in the Eastern Basin they are largely absent. As the Eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea is characterised by unique physical parameters, the necessity to study artificial reefs under these contrasting regimes increases. The epibenthic communities of two unintentional artificial reefs (modern shipwrecks) in Cyprus (Zenobia) and Lebanon (Alice-B) were evaluated in 2010. Both shipwrecks are at similar depth, type of sea bottom, made of the same material (steel) and were sunk approximately the same period of time. However, Alice-B shipwreck off the coast of Lebanon is constantly exposed to higher levels of nutrients than Zenobia in Cyprus. Significant dissimilarities were observed in the composition, percentage of benthic cover of predominant taxonomic groups and development of the epibenthic communities. Differences in physical and chemical parameters between sides lay mainly in the nutrient and thermal regimes affecting the shipwrecks and most likely bring about the differences in the observed community structure. The results of this study suggest that epibenthic communities could be highly impacted by eutrophication caused by anthropogenic activities, leading to less biodiverse communities dominated by specific species that are favoured by the eutrophic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2752162868,"Memory B cells are long-lived cells that generate a more vigorous response upon recognition of antigen (Ag) and T cell help than naïve B cells and ensure maintenance of durable humoral immunity. Functionally distinct subsets of murine memory B cells have been identified based on isotype switching of BCRs and surface expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD80 and co-inhibitory molecule PD-L2. Memory B cells in a subpopulation with low surface expression of CD80 and PD-L2 are predominantly non-isotype switched and can be efficiently recruited into germinal centers (GCs) in secondary responses. In contrast, a CD80 and PD-L2 positive subset arises predominantly from GCs and can quickly differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells (PCs). Here we demonstrate that single transient acquisition of Ag by B cells may be sufficient for their long-term participation in GC responses and for development of various memory B cell subsets including CD80 and PD-L2 positive effector-like memory cells that rapidly differentiate into class-switched PCs during recall responses."
https://openalex.org/W2746224647,"The common gonadotrophic hormone α-subunit (GTHα) has been previously isolated by our research group from A. gigas pituitaries; in the present work the cDNA sequences encoding FSHβ and LHβ subunits have also been isolated from the same species of fish. The FSH β-subunit consists of 126 amino acids with a putative 18 amino acid signal peptide and a 108 amino acid mature peptide, while the LH β-subunit consists of 141 amino acids with a putative 24 amino acid amino acid signal peptide and a 117 amino acid mature peptide. The highest identity, based on the amino acid sequences, was found with the order of Anguilliformes (61%) for FSHβ and of Cypriniformes (76%) for LHβ, followed by Siluriformes, 53% for FSHβ and 75% for LHβ. Interestingly, the identity with the corresponding human amino acid sequences was still remarkable: 45.1% for FSHβ and 51.4% for LHβ. Three dimensional models of ag-FSH and ag-LH, generated by using the crystal structures of h-FSH and h-LH as the respective templates and carried out via comparative modeling and molecular dynamics simulations, suggested the presence of the so-called ""seat-belt"", favored by a disulfide bond formed between the 3rd and 12th cysteine in both β-subunits. The sequences found will be used for the biotechnological synthesis of A. gigas gonadotrophic hormones (ag-FSH and ag-LH). In a first approach, to ascertain that the cloned transcripts allow the expression of the heterodimeric hormones, ag-FSH has been synthesized in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, preliminarily purified and characterized."
https://openalex.org/W2748305676,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is one of the most aggressive tumours and is typically diagnosed too late. Late diagnosis requires an urgent decision on an effective therapy. An individualized test of chemosensitivity should quickly indicate the suitability of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. No ex vivo chemosensitivity assessment developed thus far has become a part of general clinical practice. Therefore, we attempted to explore the new technique of coherence-controlled holographic microscopy to investigate the motility and growth of live cells from a head and neck squamous cell carcinoma biopsy. We expected to reveal behavioural patterns characteristic for malignant cells that can be used to imrove future predictive evaluation of chemotherapy. We managed to cultivate primary SACR2 carcinoma cells from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma biopsy verified through histopathology. The cells grew as a cohesive sheet of suspected carcinoma origin, and western blots showed positivity for the tumour marker p63 confirming cancerous origin. Unlike the roundish colonies of the established FaDu carcinoma cell line, the SACR2 cells formed irregularly shaped colonies, eliciting the impression of the collective invasion of carcinoma cells. Time-lapse recordings of the cohesive sheet activity revealed the rapid migration and high plasticity of these epithelial-like cells. Individual cells frequently abandoned the swiftly migrating crowd by moving aside and crawling faster. The increasing mass of fast migrating epithelial-like cells before and after mitosis confirmed the continuation of the cell cycle. In immunofluorescence, analogously shaped cells expressed the p63 tumour marker, considered proof of their origin from a carcinoma. These behavioural traits indicate the feasible identification of carcinoma cells in culture according to the proposed concept of the carcinoma cell dynamic phenotype. If further developed, this approach could later serve in a new functional online analysis of reactions of carcinoma cells to therapy. Such efforts conform to current trends in precision medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2752474613,"Dormant spores of Bacillus species lack ATP and NADH and contain notable levels of only a few other common low mol wt energy reserves, including 3-phosphoglyceric acid (3PGA), and glutamic acid. Recently, Bacillus subtilis spores were reported to contain ~ 30 μmol of L-malate/g dry wt, which also could serve as an energy reserve. In present work, L-malate levels were determined in the core of dormant spores of B. subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus megaterium and Clostridium difficile, using both an enzymatic assay and 13C-NMR on extracts prepared by several different methods. These assays found that levels of L-malate in B. cereus and B. megaterium spores were ≤ 0.5 μmol/g dry wt, and ≤ 1 μmol/g dry wt in B. subtilis spores, and levels of L-lactate and pyruvate in B. megaterium and B. subtilis spores were < 0.5 μmol/g dry wt. Levels of L-malate in C. difficile spores were ≤ 1 μmol/g dry wt, while levels of 3PGA were ~ 7 μmol/g; the latter value was determined by 31P-NMR, and is in between the 3PGA levels in B. megaterium and B. subtilis spores determined previously. 13C-NMR analysis of spore extracts further showed that B. megaterium, B. subtilis and C. difficile contained significant levels of carbonate/bicarbonate in the spore core. Low mol wt carbon-containing small molecules present at > 3 μmol/g dry spores are: i) dipicolinic acid, carbonate/bicarbonate and 3PGA in B. megaterium, B. subtilis and C. difficile; ii) glutamate in B. megaterium and B. subtilis; iii) arginine in B. subtilis; and iv) at least one unidentified compound in all three species."
https://openalex.org/W2750379683,"Category representations can be broadly classified as containing within-category information or between-category information. Although such representational differences can have a profound impact on decision-making, relatively little is known about the factors contributing to the development and generalizability of different types of category representations. These issues are addressed by investigating the impact of training methodology and category structures using a traditional empirical approach as well as the novel adaptation of computational modeling techniques from the machine learning literature. Experiment 1 focused on rule-based (RB) category structures thought to promote between-category representations. Participants learned two sets of two categories during training and were subsequently tested on a novel categorization problem using the training categories. Classification training resulted in a bias toward between-category representations whereas concept training resulted in a bias toward within-category representations. Experiment 2 focused on information-integration (II) category structures thought to promote within-category representations. With II structures, there was a bias toward within-category representations regardless of training methodology. Furthermore, in both experiments, computational modeling suggests that only within-category representations could support generalization during the test phase. These data suggest that within-category representations may be dominant and more robust for supporting the reconfiguration of current knowledge to support generalization."
https://openalex.org/W2750664569,"Climate change driven alterations to patterns of Arctic marine primary production, with increasing phytoplankton- and decreasing ice algal production, have the potential to change the resource utilisation and trophic structure of the benthic communities relying on the algae for food. To predict the benthic responses to dietary changes, we studied the macroinfaunal community compositions, and used the faunal δ13C and δ15N signatures to investigate their main food sources and trophic positions in North Water (NOW) and Lancaster Sound (LS) polynyas in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Macroinfaunal density (10 952 ind. m-2) and biomass (3190 mg C m-2) recorded in NOW were higher than previously found in the Arctic at depths >500m, and significantly higher than in LS (8355 ind. m-2 and 2110 mg C m-2). This was attributed to higher particulate organic matter fluxes to seafloor in NOW. Polychaetes were significant taxa at both sites in terms of density and biomass, and in addition crustacean density in NOW and bivalve density in LS were high. Facultative filter and surface deposit feeders were highly prevalent at both sites, suggesting feeding plasticity is a successful strategy for accessing different food sources. The macrofaunal δ13C signatures reflected the signatures of pelagic particulate organic matter at the sites, and an isotope mixing model confirmed phytoplankton as the main food source for most taxa and feeding guilds. The food web length in LS was longer than in NOW (3.2 vs. 2.8 trophic levels). This was attributed to a larger reliance on reworked organic matter by the benthic community in LS, whereas the high export fluxes at the highly productive NOW resulted in higher rates of selective consumption of fresh algal matter. Despite studies suggesting that loss of ice algae from consumer diets in the Arctic might have a negative impact on the benthos, this study suggests that Arctic macrobenthic communities thrive using phytoplankton as their main food source and should thus be able to cope or even benefit from predicted changes to patterns of primary production."
https://openalex.org/W2751997385,"SecB, a small tetrameric chaperone in Escherichia coli, plays a crucial role during protein export via the general secretory pathway by binding precursor polypeptides in a nonnative conformation and passing them to SecA, the ATPase of the translocon. The dissociation constants for the interactions are known; however to relate studies in vitro to export in a living cell requires knowledge of the concentrations of the proteins in the cell. Presently in the literature there is no report of a rigorous determination of the intracellular concentration of SecB. The values available vary over 60 fold and the details of the techniques used are not given. Here we use quantitative immunoblotting to determine the level of SecB expressed from the chromosome in E.coli grown in two commonly used media. In rich medium SecB was present at 1.6 ± 0.2 μM and in minimal medium at 2.5 ± 0.6 μM. These values allow studies of SecB carried out in vitro to be applied to the situation in the cell as SecB interacts with its binding partners to move precursor polypeptides through the export pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2748872131,"†Sorbinicharax verraesi is a marine teleostean fish from the Upper Cretaceous of Nardò (Italy). It was first attributed to the otophysan order Characiformes, which represents potential evidence for the controversial marine origin of the clade. Through a review of all the available material, we demonstrate that this species is not an otophysan since it lacks key structures that would allow for its inclusion in this group. †Sorbinicharax has a body shape that recalls ground fishes classically assigned to Acanthomorpha. However, no unambiguous feature allows us to relate it to this clade. In fact, the presence of cellular bony tissue supports its exclusion from Eurypterygii. Since no feature permits the definitive attribution of †Sorbinicharax to any teleost group, it remains as Teleostei incertae sedis. We infer that the morphology of †Sorbinicharax indicates a benthic ecology. It displays: an anteriorly wide body with enlarged ribs; large pectoral fins, while anal and dorsal fins are reduced; a large head measuring ¼ of the total body length; and a mouth opening dorsally in a high position. Such morphology was so far undescribed in Nardo. It is surprisingly displayed by a non-eurypterygian teleost fish which means by a fish which does not belong to the clades that diversify since the upper Cretaceous and include the extant families that show ground ecomorphologies."
https://openalex.org/W2751146544,"Affective analysis of images in social networks has drawn much attention, and the texts surrounding images are proven to provide valuable semantic meanings about image content, which can hardly be represented by low-level visual features. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for visual affective classification (VAC) task. This approach combines visual representations along with novel text features through a fusion scheme based on Dempster-Shafer (D-S) Evidence Theory. Specifically, we not only investigate different types of visual features and fusion methods for VAC, but also propose textual features to effectively capture emotional semantics from the short text associated to images based on word similarity. Experiments are conducted on three public available databases: the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), the Artistic Photos and the MirFlickr Affect set. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach combining visual and textual features provides promising results for VAC task."
https://openalex.org/W2750069254,"Consistent evidence suggests that the way we reach and grasp an object is modulated not only by object properties (e.g., size, shape, texture, fragility and weight), but also by the types of intention driving the action, among which the intention to interact with another agent (i.e., social intention). Action observation studies ascribe the neural substrate of this ‘intentional’ component to the putative mirror neuron (pMNS) and the mentalizing (MS) systems. How social intentions are translated into executed actions, however, has yet to be addressed. We conducted a kinematic and a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study considering a reach-to-grasp movement performed towards the same object positioned at the same location but with different intentions: passing it to another person (social condition) or putting it on a concave base (individual condition). Kinematics showed that individual and social intentions are characterized by different profiles, with a slower movement at the level of both the reaching (i.e., arm movement) and the grasping (i.e., hand aperture) components. fMRI results showed that: (i) distinct voxel pattern activity for the social and the individual condition are present within the pMNS and the MS during action execution; (ii) decoding accuracies of regions belonging to the pMNS and the MS are correlated, suggesting that these two systems could interact for the generation of appropriate motor commands. Results are discussed in terms of motor simulation and inferential processes as part of a hierarchical generative model for action intention understanding and generation of appropriate motor commands."
https://openalex.org/W2751025023,"In this paper, we study a network of Izhikevich neurons to explore what it means for a brain to be at the edge of chaos. To do so, we first constructed the phase diagram of a single Izhikevich excitatory neuron, and identified a small region of the parameter space where we find a large number of phase boundaries to serve as our edge of chaos. We then couple the outputs of these neurons directly to the parameters of other neurons, so that the neuron dynamics can drive transitions from one phase to another on an artificial energy landscape. Finally, we measure the statistical complexity of the parameter time series, while the network is tuned from a regular network to a random network using the Watts-Strogatz rewiring algorithm. We find that the statistical complexity of the parameter dynamics is maximized when the neuron network is most small-world-like. Our results suggest that the small-world architecture of neuron connections in brains is not accidental, but may be related to the information processing that they do."
https://openalex.org/W2752028718,"Pathogen transmission across species drives disease emergence; however, mechanisms by which multi-host pathogens cross species boundaries are not well identified. This knowledge gap prevents integrated and targeted control in an epidemiologically continuous ecosystem. Our goal is to describe the impact of host species heterogeneity on the epidemiology of Neospora caninum circulating between livestock and wildlife in southeastern Ohio. We collected biological samples from Père David's deer (Elaphurus davidianus) located at an outdoor wildlife conservation center; from cattle raised at farms adjacent to the center; and from wild white-tailed deer that roamed across farm and center boundaries. We designed nested infectious disease models of competing hypotheses about transmission and used collected data to fit the models, thereby estimating important immunological and transmission quantities which describe the species-specific contribution to the persistence of this pathogen in the community. We applied these data and models to suggest appropriate species-specific disease control methods. Results show that immunity in cattle and Pére David's deer wanes over time, while in white-tailed deer immunity appears to be lifelong. Transmission quantities for cattle were estimated at values below the threshold for an outbreak (Rt < 1), meaning that chains of transmission are not maintained within this population and infections must occur due to reintroduction from an outside source. Pére David's deer and white-tailed deer both could maintain continuous chains of transmission within their group (Rt > 1). Therefore, we propose that control of contact with outside sources will be useful for disease control in cattle; boosting immunity with vaccines might be an avenue to prevent infection in cattle and Père David's deer. White-tailed deer are a potential maintenance host for infection and require further study to determine optimal control methods. Community-level investigations like this allow us to better evaluate heterogeneities in transmission processes that ultimately guide targeted control."
https://openalex.org/W2748107098,"Background In the late 1990s, American tobacco companies began offering limited cessation assistance to smokers by posting links on their company websites to government-sponsored smoking cessation resources. Philip Morris USA (PM) went further, funding youth cessation programs and creating its own online cessation program, QuitAssist. We explore why PM entered the cessation arena, and describe the variety of options considered and how PM-supported cessation programs were evaluated and promoted. Methods We retrieved and analyzed archival PM documents from 1998–2005. We supplemented information from the documents with scholarly articles assessing QuitAssist and archived versions of the PM and QuitAssist websites. Results PM’s Youth Smoking Prevention department began funding youth cessation projects and programs soon after its creation in 1998, motivated by the same issue that drove its interest in youth smoking prevention: regulatory threats posed by public and policymaker concern about youth smoking. The department took a similar approach to youth smoking cessation as it did with prevention, rejecting curricula with “anti-industry” themes. In 2002, a “cessation exploration team” examined a variety of rationales for and approaches to company support for adult smoking cessation. Ultimately, PM chose QuitAssist, a limited and less expensive option that nonetheless provided opportunities for engagement with a variety of public health and government officials. Independent research indicates that QuitAssist is not an effective cessation tool. Conclusions While the transformation of ambitious plans into a mundane final product is a recurring theme with PM’s corporate responsibility efforts, it would be inappropriate to dismiss PM’s smoking cessation endeavors as half-hearted attempts to appear responsible. Such endeavors have the potential to inflict real harm by competing with more effective programs and by helping to maintain a tobacco-favorable policy environment. If PM truly wanted to support cessation, it could drop legal and other challenges to public policies that discourage smoking."
https://openalex.org/W2751740676,"In this study, genetic parameters were obtained for growth and cold tolerance of 99 Fenneropenaeus chinensis juvenile families by means of indoor artificial cooling (starting from 14°C, 2°C/d). A linear mixed model was fitted to estimate variance components using the ASReml software package. Heritabilities estimated for body weight (BW) and body length (BL) of F. chinensis juveniles were 0.078 ± 0.124 and 0.131 ± 0.133, respectively. The estimates of heritability were low in magnitude for both traits. The differences between the heritabilities estimated for the two growth traits were not significant with each other, and the heritabilities were not significantly different from zero (P > 0.05). The phenotypic and genetic correlation coefficients between BW and BL were as high as 0.9408 ± 0.0040 and 0.9562 ± 0.0551, respectively, and both were significantly different from zero (P < 0.01). The heritabilities of temperature at death (TAD) and cooling degree hours (CDH) were 0.265 ± 0.091 and 0.077 ± 0.058, respectively. The heritability estimates for TAD was moderate and significantly different from zero (P < 0.01). The correlation analysis indicated that the phenotypic correlation coefficient between TAD and CDH was -0.5470 ± 0.0174, and the genetic correlation coefficient was -0.6707 ± 0.3635. In the analysis of growth traits and cold tolerance traits, the values of phenotypic correlation coefficient were floating between -0.1055 and 0.1098, both were significantly different from zero (P < 0.05), while the genetic correlation had a larger range (0.0526 ~ 0.9914), and all were not significantly different from zero (P > 0.05). In this study, there was a low correlation between growth and cold tolerance traits, indicating that growth traits and cold tolerance traits should be considered collectively in the breeding program of shrimp."
https://openalex.org/W2748014562,"Paracoccidioides brasiliensis yeast was reported to express paracoccin, a GlcNAc-binding protein that displays N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase (NAGase) activity. Highly specific anti-paracoccin antibodies have been previously used to examine the localization of paracoccin in yeast and inhibit its growth in vitro. In the present study, anti-paracoccin antibodies were used to characterize, by scanning confocal microscopy, the distribution of paracoccin in P. brasiliensis hyphae, transition forms from hyphae to yeast, and mature yeast. In the mycelial phase, paracoccin was detected mainly in the hyphae tips, where it demonstrated a punctate distribution, and was associated with the cell wall. During the first 48 hours after a temperature shift from 26°C to 37°C, paracoccin expression in the differentiating hyphae was mainly detected in the budding regions, i.e. lateral protrusions, and inside the new daughter cells. There was an increased number of chlamydoconidia that expressed a high concentration of paracoccin on their surfaces and/or in their interiors 72-96 hours after the temperature shift. After 120 hours, yeast cells were the predominant form and their cytoplasm stained extensively for paracoccin, whereas Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA) staining was predominant on their exterior walls. After 10 days at 37°C, the interior of both mother and daughter yeast cells, as well as the budding regions, stained intensely for paracoccin. The comparison of mRNA-expression in the different fungal forms showed that PCN transcripts, although detected in all evaluated morphological forms, were higher in hypha and yeast-to-hypha transition forms. In conclusion, the pattern of paracoccin distribution in all P. brasiliensis morphotypes supports prevalent beliefs that it plays important roles in fungal growth and dimorphic transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2745580489,"myo-Inositol phosphates (IPs) are important bioactive molecules that have multiple activities within eukaryotic cells, including well-known roles as second messengers and cofactors that help regulate diverse biochemical processes such as transcription and hormone receptor activity. Despite the typical absence of IPs in prokaryotes, many of these organisms express IPases (or phytases) that dephosphorylate IPs. Functionally, these enzymes participate in phosphate-scavenging pathways and in plant pathogenesis. Here, we determined the X-ray crystallographic structures of two catalytically inactive mutants of protein-tyrosine phosphatase-like myo-inositol phosphatases (PTPLPs) from the non-pathogenic bacteria Selenomonas ruminantium (PhyAsr) and Mitsuokella multacida (PhyAmm) in complex with the known eukaryotic second messengers Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 and Ins(1,4,5)P3. Both enzymes bound these less-phosphorylated IPs in a catalytically competent manner, suggesting that IP hydrolysis has a role in plant pathogenesis. The less-phosphorylated IP binding differed in both the myo-inositol ring position and orientation when compared with a previously determined complex structure in the presence of myo-inositol-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate (InsP6 or phytate). Further, we have demonstrated that PhyAsr and PhyAmm have different specificities for Ins(1,2,4,5,6)P5, have identified structural features that account for this difference, and have shown that the absence of these features results in a broad specificity toward Ins(1,2,4,5,6)P5. These features are main-chain conformational differences in loops adjacent to the active site that include the extended loop prior to the penultimate helix, the extended Ω-loop, and a β-hairpin turn of the Phy-specific domain."
