https://openalex.org/W2017216895,"Large contrasts are observed between the messenger RNA populations of different tissues and of embryos at different stages of development. Nevertheless, coding sequences for genes not expressed in a cell appear to be present in its nuclear RNA. Though many nuclear RNA transcripts of single copy DNA sequences are held in common between tissues, an additional set, probably consisting of non-message sequences, is not shared. Nuclear RNA also contains transcripts of repetitive DNA sequences. Certain repeat families are represented at high levels in the nuclear RNA of particular tissues and much lower levels in others. It is surprising that both complements of most repeat sequences are present in nuclear RNA. These observations lead to model for regulation of gene expression in which the formation of repetitive RNA-RNA duplexes controls the production of messenger RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2002367555,"Chick ciliary ganglionic neurons require an interaction with their peripheral targets for survival during a critical period of their embryonic development in vivo. It has recently been shown that survival of these neurons in dissociated cell cultures is supported by extract from whole chick embryo. In this study, an assay system based on microwell cultures of ciliary ganglionic neurons was used to demonstrate that a very rich source of trophic factor for them is the intraocular target tissues they innervate. Out of 8000 trophic units present in a 12-day embryo, 2500 were contained in the eye. A subdissection of the eye showed its activity to be localized in a fraction containing the ciliary body and choroid coat, with a specific activity almost 20-fold higher than that of the whole embryo. This selective intraocular distribution at a time when survival or death of ciliary ganglionic neurons is decided in vivo suggests that this soluble factor may be involved in the normal development of the ciliary ganglion."
https://openalex.org/W2064415043,"The opiate antagonist naloxone has been used to treat shock following acute blood loss in conscious rats. Naloxone treatment rapidly increased mean arterial pressure and pulse pressure in this new shock model. More importantly, these blood pressure changes were sustained and survival was significantly increased with maloxone as compared with placebo treatment. From these findings, it may be inferred that endorphins may play a role in the pathophysiology of hypovolemic shock. It is suggested that narcotic antagonists may prove to be of therapeutic value in the treatment of shock."
https://openalex.org/W2005273920,"The action of penicillin on synaptically evoked dendritic activity was examined with the use of hippocampal slice preparations. Orthodormic activation of CA1 pyramidal neurons produced an excitatory-inhibitory postsynaptic potential sequence recorded intracellularly in the dendrites. Treatment with penicillin resulted in the appearance of spontaneous and synaptically evoked multipeaked field potentials and associated depolarization shifts and spike burst generation in CA1 cells. Intracellular recordings revealed that penicillin produced no detectable change in passive membrane properties of the postsynaptic dendrites. However, the inhibitory postsynaptic potential was suppressed by penicillin, resulting in the release of intrinsic dendritic burst firing during synaptic activation. These findings emphasize the role of normal patterns of dendritic burst generation in the production of intense neuronal discharge during penicillin-induced epileptiform activities."
https://openalex.org/W1998621721,"Two different ultrastructural alterations were observed in liver cells of chimpanzees inoculated with plasma derived from two different patients with non-A, non-B hepatitis. During the acute phase of illness in one group of four chimpanzees, peculiar tubular structures, composed of two unit membranes with electron-opaque material in between, were observed in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes. In contrast, these structures were never detected in the liver cells of the second group of five chimpanzees that received the second inoculum, However, nuclear changes, usually associated with aggregates of 20- to 27-nanometer particles, were found in hepatocytes of the latter animals. Although these particles resembled viruses, they were not as uniform as small virus particles often appear. In five other chimpanzees inoculated with non-A, non-B hepatitis material not known to be related to the first two inocula, cytoplasmic structures were found in four, and nuclear structures were found in the remaining one. Thus, all 14 chimpanzees inoculated with transmissible non-A, non-B hepatitis agents could be classified as having either nuclear or cytoplasmic changes. These observations add support to epidemiologic data suggesting that there may be more than one agent of non-A, non-B hepatitis."
https://openalex.org/W2033661628,"Thirteen of 31 rabbits immunized repeatedly with bovine brain galactocerebroside developed experimental allergic neuritis, manifested by flaccid paresis and hypesthesia of four limbs, 2 to 11 months after the initial inoculation. Electrophysiological studies revealed multifocal conduction block of peripheral nerves. Perivenular demyelinative lesions associated with phagocytic mononuclear cells occurred in spinal ganglia, roots, and less frequently in distal nerves."
https://openalex.org/W2062966210,"Echolocating bats (Eptesicus fuscus) can detect changes as small as 500 nanoseconds in the arrival time of sonar echoes when these changes appear as jitter or alternations in arrival time from one echo to the next. The psychophysical function relating the bat's performance to the magnitude of the jitter corresponds to the half-wave rectified cross-correlation function between the emitted sonar signals and the echoes. The bat perceives the phase or period structure of the sounds, which cover the 25- to 100-kilohertz frequency range, as these are represented in the auditory system after peripheral transformation. The acoustic image of a sonar target is apparently derived from time-domain or periodicity information processing by the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2057821209,"The trajectory of the intracortical noradrenergic fibers has been characterized by histochemical analysis following the production of cortical lesions in the rate. A large group of noradrenergic fibers enters the cortex at the frontal pole and proceeds caudally through the deep layers of dorsolateral cortex. Branches arise from these longitudinally directed fibers and form a uniform pattern of innervation throughout lateral cortex. Because these fibers travel long distances rostrocaudally within the gray matter, a large area of cortex can be deprived of noradrenergic innervation by a relatively small lesion of frontal cortex. The medial and lateral cortex can be selectively and differentially denervated of noradrenergic fibers, and there is a medial to lateral topographic relationship between deep longitudinally running fibers and overlying cortex."
https://openalex.org/W1995106688,"Lesions of the medial septum were produced in 7 of 14 rabbits prior to classical conditioning of the nictitating membrane response. Lesions significantly altered the hippocampal electroencephalogram, attenuated conditioned hippocampal unit responses, and slowed the behavioral rate of acquisition. The contrast of the behavioral results with those of studies of massive septal or hippocampal ablation suggests a functional subdivision of the septo-hippocampal system in learning."
https://openalex.org/W2055993571,"Close study of 3-hydroxybutyrate uptake by brain suggests that its metabolism is limited by permeability. Furthermore, the permeability characteristics vary from region to region; areas known to have no blood-brain barrier show the highest rate of utilization. The results imply that rather than substitute fuels, ketone bodies should be considered supplements which partially supply specific areas but are incapable of supporting the entire energy requirement of all brain regions."
https://openalex.org/W2031222436,"The reduction of glycolysis by hypoglycemia or the glucose analog 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) stimulates compensatory sympathetic alterations of metabolism. Considerable attention has been focused on the hypothalamus as the probable locus of requisite metabolic signal detection. We report, however, that unanesthetized chronically decerebrate rats are capable of exhibiting sympathoadrenal hyperglycemia in response to the metabolic challenge presented by 2DG. This findings demonstrates that the forebrain is not necessary for glucoprivic stimulation of this reflex. Since cervical cord transection has been shown to eliminate hyperglycemia induced by 2DG, we conclude that the caudal brainstem contains an essential part of the neural mechanism which both detects metabolic need and ameliorates that need through the release of stored fuels."
https://openalex.org/W2070258252,"Performance on verbal and spatial matching tasks was assessed every 15 minutes for 8 hours. Significant 60- to 100-minute oscillations were observed for each task. These oscillations were 180 degrees out of phase, supporting the hypothesis that in humans the basic rest activity cycle involves alternating activation of processing systems residing in the two cerebral hemispheres."
https://openalex.org/W1980595683,"Blockade of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor function by direct microinjection of the GABA receptor antagonist bicuculline into the nucleus ambiguus of the brainstem produced a marked, dose-related depression of heart rate and blood pressure which was mediated by the vagus nerve. This effect was not obtained in other regions of the brainstem and was reversed by the GABA receptor agonist muscimol. These data indicate that the nucleus ambiguus may be the site of a GABA receptor-mediated inhibition of vagal outflow."
https://openalex.org/W2071388810,Three-day-old rats that were separated from their mothers and deprived of food were found to be capable of feeding either from small puddles of milk or when milk was infused into the front of their mouths. Such feeding was accompanied by a dramatic increase in behavioral activity and only occurred in a warm environment. These data demonstrate that neural systems for ingestive behavior are present at birth and suggest the existence of feeding-related arousal or motivational systems.
https://openalex.org/W1967723373,The hypothesis of less direct interaction between hemispheres in young children was supported by a behavioral test. Fabric samples were compared with either the same hand (same hemisphere) or with opposite hands (between hemispheres). Crossed errors were a significantly larger proportion of total errors in 3-year-olds than in 5-year-olds.
https://openalex.org/W2033131402,"The specificity of the neurotoxic agent, kainic acid, for destroying cell bodies while sparing terminals and fibers of passage was examined by infusing this agent into the axons of the dorsal noradrenergic bundle and measuring the degree of depletion of noradrenaline concentrations and the reduction in noradrenaline uptake in cortex and hippocampus. Extensive neuronal loss and gliosis were observed around the injection site. In addition, a significant and consistent 25 percent depletion of hippocampal-cortical noradrenaline was also obtained. The results suggest that although kainic acid has its greatest destructive action on neuronal perikarya, a significant amount of damage to axons of passage may also occur."
https://openalex.org/W1991231981,"In the cone pedicules, the digitations of horizontal cell process lateral to the synaptic ribbon disappear after dark adaptation. This disappearance is correlated with the loss of color opponency and cone function shown in ganglion cell recordings in isolated retinas. Cone function and color-opponent responses are restored by reapplying background light."
https://openalex.org/W2025167018,"Inspecting a radial flow pattern depressed visual sensitivity to changes in the size of a small test square, but only when the square was located near the focus of the flow pattern. The result suggests that precise visual judgments of one's direction of forward motion with respect to the outside world may be mediated by an already known neural organization sensitive to changes in the size of small objects."
https://openalex.org/W1980262844,"Children from an entire biracial geographical population were examined for blood pressure. A sample of 278 children, stratified by diastolic blood pressure, was reexamined 1 to 2 years later. Dopamine beta-hydroxylase, renin activity, and resting heart rate were observed in black and white children. In the group with high blood pressure, whites had higher heart rates and greater renin activity than blacks. Dopamine beta-hydroxylase concentrations in blacks were lower than in whites over the entire spectrum of blood pressure levels. High blood pressure seems to have a different metabolic background in the two races which may influence the early natural history of essential hypertension. Therefore, the rationale of prevention, and possibly treatment, of early hypertension in blacks and whites may differ."
https://openalex.org/W2070928033,"The concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)2D], calcium, and phosphorus were measured in the serum of rats during pregnancy and at various stages of lactation. The concentration of 1,25-(OH)2D hormone increased almost two-fold during pregnancy and the latter part of lactation, but decreased to control levels or very low values immediately after birth and weaning, respectively. Furthermore, the concentration of 1,25-(OH)2D was inversely correlated with the concentration of calcium, suggesting that circulating 1,25-(OH)2D fluctuates in concert with calcium demands during the reproductive cycle. Parathyroidectomy in lactating rats caused a 70 percent inhibition of the normally observed 1,25-(OH)2D increase, indicating that parathyroid hormone, in response to changes in serum calcium, is a primary modulator of 1,25-(OH)2D during lactation."
https://openalex.org/W2003282939,"Some individuals, with severe or recurrent infection with Neisseria species, have been identified as lacking a component in the terminal attack sequence of complement (complement components 5 to 9). The relevance of the terminal attack sequence to various phases of host defense was tested with the use of the C-11 strain of meningococci and human serum genetically deficient in complement component 8 (C8-D). The C8-D serum was comparable to normal serum in supporting ingestion and intracellular killing by leukocytes but was not bactericidal in the fluid phase unless reconstituted with C8. Thus, serum complement-dependent bactericidal activity may be especially critical for the host's defense against invasive Neisseria species."
https://openalex.org/W2062551480,"The synthesis of four enkephalinamide analogs is described in which the peptide bond between residues 4 and 5 is reversed with or without simultaneous reversal of the carboxyl-terminal amide bond. These so-called partially modified retro-inverso-isomers are new, potent, topochemical analogs of the enkephalins. Tests, both in vitro and in vivo, have shown that these analogs are considerably longer acting than any previously studied enkephalins. Thus, partial reversal of the peptide bonds of the backbone can result in peptides with enhanced activity compared to a parent compound, provide that the structural complementarity of both the side chains and end groups are conserved."
https://openalex.org/W1979910975,"Rats were exposed to sodium nitrite in food or water at concentrations of 0, 250, 1000, and 2000 parts per million. Lymphoma was increased in all groups fed nitrite; the overall combined incidence was 5.4 percent in 573 control rats and 10.2 percent in 1383 treated rats. The mechanism of cancer induction did not appear to be through the formation of nitrosamines but through a more direct effect of nitrite on the lymphocyte."
https://openalex.org/W2036238540,"Implants of embryonic neural tissue from all regions of the neuraxis survive grafting to the brains of adult rats. After implantation, neurogenesis and differentiation continue, and connections are formed with the mature host brain. Thus, the intracephalic implants provide excellent model systems for studying cellular interactions that regulate synaptogenesis and determine the cytoarchitectonic organization of developing neural tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2087115920,"Children identified nonsense shapes by touch better with their left hand and words better with their right hand. Bigrams were processed by boys as shapes and by girls as words, which suggests a sexual dimorphism of brain functioning for bigrams. A relative specialization of the hemisphere for stereognostic processing is also suggested, since the accuracy of identification by both hands was greater than chance for all three types of stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2082017088,"Human erythrocytes have specific insulin receptors. When studied in an insulin radioreceptor assay, erythrocytes from adult-onset, nonobese diabetic subjects bound at least 42 percent less insulin than the normal subjects at insulin concentrations from 0.1 to 100 nanograms per milliliter. The diabetic subjects had 190 insulin receptor sites per cell as compared with the 380 insulin receptor sites per cell for the normal subjects. The deficit of insulin binding in the diabetic subject was thus associated with a fewer number of insulin binding sites per cell with little or no change in affinity. The erythrocyte is a readily available cell for the evaluation of cellular insulin receptor activity."
https://openalex.org/W1979923921,"Horseradish peroxidase injected into 18 single, physiologically identified geniculate X and Y cells permitted a detailed morphological correlate to be determined for the physiological properties of each neuron. Class 1 morphological characteristics were associated with Y cells, class 3 with X cells, and class 2 structural traits were seen in both physiological types."
https://openalex.org/W2067304480,"Injecting radioactive transmitters into the rat substantia nigra led to retrograde neuronal labeling either in the dorsal raphe nucleus, after 3H-labeled serotonin injection, or in the caudoputamen, after 3H-labeled gamma-aminobutyric acid injection. This differential labeling in projections whose transmitter has been established provides the basis for a histochemical tracing method indicating both connectivity and transmitter specificity of neural pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2025454188,"Lidocaine infusion of a CA755 mammary adenocarcinoma growing in the hind leg of BDF1 mice results in a significant increase in the animals' survival when combined with heating for 1 hour in a 43.5°C water bath. This ability of local anesthetics to prolong survival following hyperthermia is consistent with the hypothesis that increases in membrane fluidity influence sensitivity to heat. In view of the extensive clinical experience with local anesthetics, the delay between clinical application and the observation that they potentiate the action of hyperthermia in animals may be reduced."
https://openalex.org/W2019173945,"Erythrosin B is a member of a class of fluorescein dyes that are suggested to elicit hyperkinesis when ingested by susceptible children. We found that erythrosin B inhibits dopamine uptake in rat caudate synaptosomes ""uncompetitively"" in the 10- to 800-micromolar range. Half maximal inhibition of uptake occurred at 45 micromolar. Uncompetitive inhibition denotes a decrease in efficacy of the dopamine membrane transport mechanism with an increase in affinity of dopamine to the carrier. Erythrosin B also decreased nonsaturable binding of dopamine to the synaptosome membrane. The inhibitory action of erythrosin B on dopamine uptake is consistent with the hypothesis that erythrosin B can act as a central excitatory agent able to induce hyperkinetic behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2021019824,"The serendipitous mating of a male gibbon, Hylobates moloch, and a female siamang, Symphalangus syndactylus, has produced two female offspring born 1 year apart. The hybrid karyotype of 47 chromosomes comprises the haploid complements of the parental species, 22 for the gibbon and 25 for the siamang. Chromosomal G and C banding comparisons revealed no clear homologies between the parental karyotypes except for the single chromosome in each species containing the nucleolus organizer region. The lack of homology suggests that the structural rearrangement of chromosomes has played a major role in the process of speciation for these lesser apes."

The morphology of these intraerythrocytic protozoa and the range of hosts that could be infected experimentally suggested that the parasite was B. gibsoni. Although this tick-bourne disease is enzootic in wild and domestic Canidae in Africa and Asia, it appears to be new to the Americas."

https://openalex.org/W2077255334,"A prototypic problem in screening of electroencephalograms in the automatic classification of stationary electroencephalogram time series is treated here by the Kullback-Leibler nearest neighbor rule approach. In that problem, the category or state of an individual is classified by comparison of his or her electroencephalogram with those taken from other individuals in the alternative categories. The Kullback-Leibler nearest neighbor classification rules yield a statistically reliable estimate of the smallest possible probability of electroencephalogram misclassification with a relatively small number of labeled sample electroencephalograms. The automatic classification of anesthesia levels L1 and L3, respectively the anesthesia levels insufficient and sufficient for deep surgery, is treated by machine computation on the electroencephalogram alone."
https://openalex.org/W2004044020,"Male rats consumed a diet containing 0, 12, or 48 percent sucrose on days 16 to 30 of life. Thereafter, they had simultaneous access to all three diets until day 63. No relationship was detected between sucrose consumption early in life and subsequent preference for sucrose. The onset of puberty was associated with a decreased appetite for sucrose among animals of both sexes."
https://openalex.org/W2027425896,"Daily (12-hour) urine collections taken throughout the menstrual cycle were obtained from 30 young women who by genetic analysis were at risk for familial breast cancer, and from 30 control women carefully matched for age, height, and reproductive history. Steroids in the urine were extracted by glucuronidase hydrolysis, and the primary glucocorticoid, androgen, and estrogen hormones and their metabolites were measured by radioimmunoassay. Highly significant differences were observed only in the case of estrone and estradiol, with the high-risk subjects exhibiting lower values that the controls. This endocrine abnormality in young women at risk for breast cancer may be a potential discriminant for identifying women at risk for the disease in the population at large."

https://openalex.org/W1965811373,"When fluid secretion by the pancreas was mechanically blocked, amylase secretion into the duct ceased. When flow was reduced in a graded fashion by the application of a back pressure, amylase output was reduced proportionately and amylase concentration in secretion was maintained constant. Thus, the secretion of digestive enzyme from the cell into the duct appears to be dependent upon the concentration of enzyme in the duct system. This behavior is most simply explained by diffusion-like (concentration dependent, bidirectional) fluxes of digestive enzyme across the plasma membrane. A unidirectional process, such as exocytosis, whose rate should be unaffected by fluid flow, cannot readily explain these results."
https://openalex.org/W1981566062,"Rates of cerebral perfusion were obtained from measurements of the disappearance (wash-out) of oxygen-15 after in situ tissue activation with 45-million-volt x-rays. In an anesthetized cat, typical values were 90 milliliters per minute per 100 grams of tissue, with 55 percent wash-out. In a specific radiotherapy patient, the value was 65 milliliters per minute per 100 grams of tissue, with 63 percent wash-out of oxygen-15 through incorporation into tissue water."
