https://openalex.org/W1976385326,"Apoptosis plays an important role during neuronal development, and defects in apoptosis may underlie various neurodegenerative disorders. To characterize molecular mechanisms that regulate neuronal apoptosis, the contributions to cell death of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family members, including ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), JNK (c-JUN NH2-terminal protein kinase), and p38, were examined after withdrawal of nerve growth factor (NGF) from rat PC-12 pheochromocytoma cells. NGF withdrawal led to sustained activation of the JNK and p38 enzymes and inhibition of ERKs. The effects of dominant-interfering or constitutively activated forms of various components of the JNK-p38 and ERK signaling pathways demonstrated that activation of JNK and p38 and concurrent inhibition of ERK are critical for induction of apoptosis in these cells. Therefore, the dynamic balance between growth factor-activated ERK and stress-activated JNK-p38 pathways may be important in determining whether a cell survives or undergoes apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2068113812,"A yeast two-hybrid system was used to identify a protein that interacts with and enhances the human progesterone receptor (hPR) transcriptional activity without altering the basal activity of the promoter. Because the protein stimulated transactivation of all the steroid receptors tested, it has been termed steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1). Coexpression of SRC-1 reversed the ability of the estrogen receptor to squelch activation by hPR. Also, the amino terminal truncated form of SRC-1 acted as a dominant-negative repressor. Together, these results indicate that SRC-1 encodes a coactivator that is required for full transcriptional activity of the steroid receptor superfamily."
https://openalex.org/W2016562510,"A heptadecapeptide was identified and purified from porcine brain tissue as a ligand for an orphan heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptor (LC132) that is similar in sequence to opioid receptors. This peptide, orphanin FQ, has a primary structure reminiscent of that of opioid peptides. Nanomolar concentrations of orphanin FQ inhibited forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in cells transfected with LC132. This inhibitory activity was not affected by the addition of opioid ligands, nor did the peptide activate opioid receptors. Orphanin FQ bound to its receptor in a saturable manner and with high affinity. When injected intracerebroventricularly into mice, orphanin FQ caused a decrease in locomotor activity but did not induce analgesia in the hot-plate test. However, the peptide produced hyperalgesia in the tail-flick assay. Thus, orphanin FQ may act as a transmitter in the brain by modulating nociceptive and locomotor behavior."

https://openalex.org/W2064557078,A blood donor infected with human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) and a cohort of six blood or blood product recipients infected from this donor remain free of HIV-1-related disease with stable and normal CD4 lymphocyte counts 10 to 14 years after infection. HIV-1 sequences from either virus isolates or patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells had similar deletions in the nef gene and in the region of overlap of nef and the U3 region of the long terminal repeat (LTR). Full-length sequencing of one isolate genome and amplification of selected HIV-1 genome regions from other cohort members revealed no other abnormalities of obvious functional significance. These data show that survival after HIV infection can be determined by the HIV genome and support the importance of nef or the U3 region of the LTR in determining the pathogenicity of HIV-1.

https://openalex.org/W2005185079,"Positron emission tomography was used to measure changes in the regional cerebral blood flow of normal people while they searched visual displays for targets defined by color, by motion, or by a conjunction of color and motion. A region in the superior parietal cortex was activated only during the conjunction task, at a location that had previously been shown to be engaged by successive shifts of spatial attention. Correspondingly, the time needed to detect a conjunction target increased with the number of items in the display, which is consistent with the use of a mechanism that successively analyzes each item in the visual field."
https://openalex.org/W2012408584,"The Janus tyrosine kinases (Jaks) play a central role in signaling through cytokine receptors. Although Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2 are widely expressed, Jak3 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells and is known to associate only with the common gamma (gamma c) chain of the interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15 receptors. Homozygous mutant mice in which the Jak3 gene had been disrupted were generated by gene targeting. Jak3-deficient mice had profound reductions in thymocytes and severe B cell and T cell lymphopenia similar to severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID), and the residual T cells and B cells were functionally deficient. Thus, Jak3 plays a critical role in gamma c signaling and lymphoid development."
https://openalex.org/W2132505135,Haematopoietic stem cells in umbilical cord blood are an attractive target for gene therapy of inborn errors of metabolism. Three neonates with severe combined immunodeficiency were treated by retroviral–mediated transduction of the CD34+ cells from their umbilical cord blood with a normal human adenosine deaminase complementary DNA followed by autologous transplantation. The continued presence and expression of the introduced gene in leukocytes from bone marrow and peripheral blood for 18 months demonstrates that umbilical cord blood cells may be genetically modified with retroviral vectors and engrafted in neonates for gene therapy.
https://openalex.org/W2014215007,"Biochemical studies of signaling mediated by many cytokine and growth factor receptors have implicated members of the Jak family of tyrosine kinases in these pathways. Specifically, Jak3 has been shown to be associated with the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor gamma chain, a component of the receptors for IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15. Mice lacking Jak3 showed a severe block in B cell development at the pre-B stage in the bone marrow. In contrast, although the thymuses of these mice were small, T cell maturation progressed relatively normally. In response to mitogenic signals, peripheral T cells in Jak3-deficient mice did not proliferate and secreted small amounts of IL-2. These data demonstrate that Jak3 is critical for the progression of B cell development in the bone marrow and for the functional competence of mature T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2018096072,"Severe childhood autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy (SCARMD) is a progressive muscle-wasting disorder common in North Africa that segregates with microsatellite markers at chromosome 13q12. Here, it is shown that a mutation in the gene encoding the 35-kilodalton dystrophin-associated glycoprotein, gamma-sarcoglycan, is likely to be the primary genetic defect in this disorder. The human gamma-sarcoglycan gene was mapped to chromosome 13q12, and deletions that alter its reading frame were identified in three families and one of four sporadic cases of SCARMD. These mutations not only affect gamma-sarcoglycan but also disrupt the integrity of the entire sarcoglycan complex."

https://openalex.org/W1995418425,"An argument is proposed to explain the origin of large metazoans, based on the regulatory processes that underlie the morphogenetic organization of pattern in modern animals. Genetic regulatory systems similar to those used in modern, indirectly developing marine invertebrates are considered to indicate the Precambrian regulatory platform on which were erected innovations that underlie the development of macroscopic body plans. Those systems are genetic regulatory programs that produce groups of unspecified ""set-aside cells"" and hierarchical regulatory programs that initially define regions of morphogenetic space in terms of domains of transcription factor expression. These ideas affect interpretation of the development of arthropods and chordates as well as interpretation of the role of the genes of the homeotic complex in embryogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2030063045,"The period (per) gene likely encodes a component of the Drosophila circadian clock. Circadian oscillations in the abundance of per messenger RNA and per protein (PER) are thought to arise from negative feedback control of per gene transcription by PER. A recently identified second clock locus, timeless (tim), apparently regulates entry of PER into the nucleus. Reported here are the cloning of complementary DNAs derived from the tim gene in a two-hybrid screen for PER-interacting proteins and the demonstration of a physical interaction between the tim protein (TIM) and PER in vitro. A restricted segment of TIM binds directly to a part of the PER dimerization domain PAS. PERL, a mutation that causes a temperature-sensitive lengthening of circadian period and a temperature-sensitive delay in PER nuclear entry, exhibits a temperature-sensitive defect in binding to TIM. These results suggest that the interaction between TIM and PER determines the timing of PER nuclear entry and therefore the duration of part of the circadian cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2056393772,"The clock gene timeless (tim) is required for circadian rhythmicity in Drosophila. The accumulation of tim RNA followed a circadian rhythm, and the phase and period of the tim RNA rhythm were indistinguishable from those that have been reported for per. The tim RNA oscillations were found to be dependent on the presence of PER and TIM proteins, which demonstrates feedback control of tim by a mechanism previously shown to regulate per expression. The cyclic expression of tim appears to dictate the timing of PER protein accumulation and nuclear localization, suggesting that tim promotes circadian rhythms of per and tim transcription by restricting per RNA and PER protein accumulation to separate times of day."
https://openalex.org/W2085666970,"In early Xenopus embryos, in which ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) are not transcribed, rDNA replication initiates and terminates at 9- to 12-kilobase pair intervals, with no detectable dependence on specific DNA sequences. Resumption of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis at late blastula and early gastrula is accompanied by a specific repression of replication initiation within transcription units; the frequency of initiation within intergenic spacers remains as high as in early blastula. These results demonstrate that for rRNA genes, circumscribed zones of replication initiation emerge in intergenic DNA during the time in metazoan development when the chromatin is remodeled to allow gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1988895895,"UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 3-O-acyltransferase (LpxA) catalyzes the transfer of (R)-3-hydroxymyristic acid from its acyl carrier protein thioester to UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. LpxA is the first enzyme in the lipid A biosynthetic pathway and is a target for the design of antibiotics. The x-ray crystal structure of LpxA has been determined to 2.6 angstrom resolution and reveals a domain motif composed of parallel beta strands, termed a left-handed parallel beta helix (L beta H). This unusual fold displays repeated violations of the protein folding constraint requiring right-handed crossover connections between strands of parallel beta sheets and may be present in other enzymes that share amino acid sequence homology to the repeated hexapeptide motif of LpxA."
https://openalex.org/W2031964174,"Arthropods exhibit great diversity in the position, number, morphology, and function of their limbs. The evolutionary relations among limb types and among the arthropod groups that bear them (insects, crustaceans, myriapods, and chelicerates) are controversial. Here, the use of molecular probes, including an antibody to proteins encoded by arthropod and vertebrate Distal-less (Dll and Dlx) genes, provided evidence that common genetic mechanisms underlie the development of all arthropod limbs and their branches and that all arthropods derive from a common ancestor. However, differences between crustacean and insect body plans were found to correlate with differences in the deployment of particular homeotic genes and in the ways that these genes regulate limb development."
https://openalex.org/W2037954444,"The BRCA1 gene product was identified as a 220-kilodalton nuclear phosphoprotein in normal cells, including breast ductal epithelial cells, and in 18 of 20 tumor cell lines derived from tissues other than breast and ovary. In 16 of 17 breast and ovarian cancer lines and 17 of 17 samples of cells obtained from malignant effusions, however, BRCA1 localized mainly in cytoplasm. Absence of BRCA1 or aberrant subcellular location was also observed to a variable extent in histological sections of many breast cancer biopsies. These findings suggest that BRCA1 abnormalities may be involved in the pathogenesis of many breast cancers, sporadic as well as familial."
https://openalex.org/W2103774849,"Crystallographic analysis of 2.2 angstrom resolution shows that guanosine triphosphate (GTP) hydrolysis triggers conformational changes in the heterotrimeric G-protein alpha subunit, Gi alpha 1. The switch II and switch III segments become disordered, and linker II connecting the Ras and alpha helical domains moves, thus altering the structures of potential effector and beta gamma binding regions. Contacts between the alpha-helical and Ras domains are weakened, possibly facilitating the release of guanosine diphosphate (GDP). The amino and carboxyl termini, which contain receptor and beta gamma binding determinants, are disordered in the complex with GTP, but are organized into a compact microdomain on GDP hydrolysis. The amino terminus also forms extensive quaternary contacts with neighboring alpha subunits in the lattice, suggesting that multimers of alpha subunits or heterotrimers may play a role in signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2006758553,"Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) typify a class of stable aromatic pollutants that are targeted by bioremediation strategies. In the aerobic degradation of biphenyl by bacteria, the key step of ring cleavage is catalyzed by an Fe(II)-dependent extradiol dioxygenase. The crystal structure of 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenase from a PCB-degrading strain of Pseudomonas cepacia has been determined at 1.9 angstrom resolution. The monomer comprises amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains. Structural homology between and within the domains reveals evolutionary relationships within the extradiol dioxygenase family. The iron atom has five ligands in square pyramidal geometry: one glutamate and two histidine side chains, and two water molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2018873867,"The Drosophila genes timeless (tim) and period (per) interact, and both are required for production of circadian rhythms. Here the positional cloning and sequencing of tim are reported. The tim gene encodes a previously uncharacterized protein of 1389 amino acids, and possibly another protein of 1122 amino acids. The arrhythmic mutation tim01 is a 64-base pair deletion that truncates TIM to 749 amino acids. Absence of sequence similarity to the PER dimerization motif (PAS) indicates that direct interaction between PER and TIM would require a heterotypic protein association."

https://openalex.org/W2055239042,"To determine the interaction energy between cross-strand pairs of side chains on an antiparallel β sheet, pairwise amino acid substitutions were made on the solvent-exposed face of the B1 domain of streptococcal protein G. The measured interaction energies were substantial (1.8 kilocalories per mole) and comparable to the magnitude of the β sheet propensities. The experimental results paralleled the statistical frequency with which the residue pairs are found in β sheets of known structure."
https://openalex.org/W2057321580,"The human beta-globin locus control region (LCR) controls the transcription, chromatin structure, and replication timing of the entire locus. DNA replication was found to initiate in a transcription-independent manner within a region located 50 kilobases downstream of the LCR in human, mouse, and chicken cells containing the entire human beta-globin locus. However, DNA replication did not initiate within a deletion mutant locus lacking the sequences that encompass the LCR. This mutant locus replicated in the 3' to 5' direction. Thus, interactions between distantly separated sequences can be required for replication initiation, and factors mediating this interaction appear to be conserved in evolution."

https://openalex.org/W2063302995,"Two-dimensional deconvolution techniques are used here to reconstruct age-specific human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection rates in the United States from surveillance data on acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This approach suggests that 630,000 to 897,000 adults and adolescents in the United States were living with HIV infection as of January 1993, including 107,000 to 150,000 women. The estimated incidence of HIV infection declined markedly over time among white males, especially those older than 30 years. In contrast, HIV incidence appears to have remained relatively constant among women and minorities. As of January 1993, prevalence was highest among young adults in their late twenties and thirties and among minorities. An estimated 3 percent of black men and 1 percent of black women in their thirties were living with HIV infection as of that date. If infection rates remain at these levels, HIV must be considered as endemic in the United States."
https://openalex.org/W2022200790,"Development of the mammalian nervous system is regulated by neural impulse activity, but the molecular mechanisms are not well understood. If cell recognition molecules [for example, L1 and the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM)] were influenced by specific patterns of impulse activity, cell-cell interactions controlling nervous system structure could be regulated by nervous system function at critical stages of development. Low-frequency electrical pulses delivered to mouse sensory neurons in culture (0.1 hertz for 5 days) down-regulated expression of L1 messenger RNA and protein (but not NCAM). Fasciculation of neurites, adhesion of neuroblastoma cells, and the number of Schwann cells on neurites was reduced after 0.1-hertz stimulation, but higher frequencies or stimulation after synaptogenesis were without effect."
https://openalex.org/W2054706403,"Opioid analgesia, the selective suppression of pain without effects on other sensations, also distinguishes between different types of pain: severe, persistent pain is potently inhibited by opioids, but they fail to conceal the sensation of a pinprick. The cellular basis for this specificity was analyzed by means of patch-clamp experiments performed on fluorescently labeled nociceptive neurons (nociceptors) that innervate rat tooth pulp. Activation of the μ opioid receptor inhibited calcium channels on almost all small nociceptors but had minimal effect on large nociceptors. Somatostatin had the opposite specificity, preferentially inhibiting calcium channels on the large cells. Because persistent pain is mediated by slow-conducting, small nociceptors, opioids are thus likely to inhibit neurotransmitter release only at those primary synapses specialized for persistent pain."
https://openalex.org/W1967897970,"Cell proliferation and cell fate specification are under strict spatiotemporal control in the developing Drosophila eye. Cells excluded from five-cell preclusters synchronously enter a single additional cell cycle, the second mitotic wave, after which the remaining cells are sequentially recruited. When the second mitotic wave was blocked with the human cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21CIP1/WAF1, each cell type was still specified. Hence, cell fate determination is regulated independently of the division pattern of precursor cells. However, the second mitotic wave is needed to generate appropriate numbers of each cell type. Moreover, p21 can arrest precursor cell proliferation and allow appropriate fate choice in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2025701708,"Immune evasion by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is unexplained but may involve the mutation of viral antigens. When cytotoxic T lymphocytes engaged CD4-positive cells that were acutely infected with HIV bearing natural variant epitopes in reverse transcriptase, substantial inhibition of specific antiviral lysis was observed. Mutant viruses capable of these transactive effects could facilitate the persistence of a broad range of HIV variants in the face of an active and specific immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2047122601,"The assembly and transport of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules require interaction with the invariant chain. A fragment of the invariant chain, CLIP, occupies the peptide-binding groove of the class II molecule. At endosomal pH, the binding of CLIP to human MHC class II HLA-DR molecules was counteracted by its amino-terminal segment (residues 81 to 89), which facilitated rapid release. The CLIP (81-89) fragment also catalyzed the release of CLIP(90-105) and a subset of other self-peptides, probably by transient interaction with an effector site outside the groove. Thus, CLIP may facilitate peptide loading through an allosteric release mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2038272313,"The protein sigma 54 associates with Escherichia coli core RNA polymerase to form a holoenzyme that binds promoters but is inactive in the absence of enhancer activation. Here, mutants of sigma 54 enabled polymerases to transcribe without enhancer protein and adenosine triphosphate. The mutations are in leucines within the NH2-terminal glutamine-rich domain of sigma 54. Multiple leucine substitutions mimicked the effect of enhancer protein, which suggests that the enhancer protein functions to disrupt a leucine patch. The results indicate that sigma 54 acts both as an inhibitor of polymerase activity and as a receptor that interacts with enhancer protein to overcome this inhibition, and that these two activities jointly confer enhancer responsiveness."

https://openalex.org/W1997332093,"Some growth factors are therapeutically useful partly because restricted expression of their receptors limits their action to particular cell types. However, no unique stimulatory factor is known for many clinically relevant cell types, such as CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells. Here, soluble alpha receptor (R alpha) components for interleukin-6 (IL-6) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) were targeted in an active form to cells expressing surface markers such as CD34 or CD45, thereby rendering those cells responsive to IL-6 or CNTF. The targeting of R alpha components may provide the means to create ""designer"" cytokines that activate a desired cell type expressing a specific cell surface marker."
