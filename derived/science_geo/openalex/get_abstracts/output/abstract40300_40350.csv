https://openalex.org/W1972992388,"Epstein-Barr virus expresses a cytoplasmic and plasma membrane protein (LMP) in latently infected growth transformed lymphocytes. The gene specifying LMP has now been expressed in NIH3T3 and Rat-1 cells. Expression of the gene in these cells resulted in altered cell morphology and some resistance to the growth inhibiting effect of medium containing low serum. In Rat-1 cells, LMP expression often led to loss of contact inhibition and anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. Rat-1 cells expressing LMP were uniformly tumorigenic in nude mice. Thus, LMP is a transforming gene which is likely to account for many aspects of EBV induced cell transformations. This is the first demonstration of a transforming gene in Epstein-Barr virus, a ubiquitous human pathogen associated with neoplasia."
https://openalex.org/W1604272930,"We have investigated the subcellular localization of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor in rat adrenal gland using the high affinity ligand 3H-labeled 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide ([3H]PK11195). The autoradiographic pattern of [3H]PK11195 binding sites in tissue sections of adrenal gland is similar to the histochemical distribution of the mitochondrial marker enzymes, cytochrome oxidase and monoamine oxidase, which are present in high concentrations only in the cortex. Subcellular fractionation studies of homogenates of adrenal gland indicate that the recovery and enrichment of [3H]PK11195 binding sites in the nuclear, mitochondrial, microsomal, and soluble fractions correlate closely with cytochrome oxidase activity, but not with markers for the nuclei, lysosomes, peroxysomes, endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane, or cytoplasm, indicating an association of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor with the mitochondrial compartment. Titration of isolated mitochondria with digitonin results in the simultaneous release of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor and of monoamine oxidase, but not cytochrome oxidase, indicating association of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor with the mitochondrial outer membrane. Scatchard analysis and drug displacement studies of the binding of [3H] PK11195 to intact mitochondria and to the outer membrane-enriched digitonin extract further confirm the localization of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor to the mitochondrial outer membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2166947359,"We show that the germline specificity of P element transposition is controlled at the level of mRNA splicing and not at the level of transcription. In the major P element RNA transcript, isolated from somatic cells, the first three open reading frames are joined by the removal of two introns. Using in vitro mutagenesis and genetic analysis we demonstrate the existence of a third intron whose removal is required for transposase production. We propose that this intron is only removed in the germline and that its removal is the sole basis for the germline restriction of P element transposition."
https://openalex.org/W2019019911,"Mx+ mice are much more resistant to influenza virus than Mx- strains. The resistance is mediated by interferon (IFN) alpha/beta. After IFN treatment, Mx+ but not Mx- cells accumulate Mx protein and become specifically resistant to orthomyxoviruses. cDNA encoding Mx protein was cloned and sequenced. Southern analyses indicate that Mx- alleles derive from their Mx+ counterpart by deletions. IFN-treated Mx+ cells contained a 3.5 kb Mx mRNA, while Mx- cells showed only traces of shorter Mx RNA. Mx- cells transformed with Mx cDNA expressed Mx protein constitutively to varying extents; resistance of individual cells to influenza virus correlated with Mx protein expression. Thus, specific resistance to influenza virus in vivo may be attributed to Mx protein expression and is independent of other IFN-mediated effects."
https://openalex.org/W1983170203,"Sialyltransferase (Gal beta 1,4GlcNAc alpha 2,6 sialyltransferase) was localized by immunoelectron microscopy in rat liver hepatocytes using affinity-purified antibodies. Immunoreactivity for sialyltransferase was found in the Golgi apparatus, where it was restricted to an interconnected system consisting of the trans-cisternae and the trans-tubular network. This region of the Golgi apparatus exhibited both TPPase and CMPase activity and was the intracellular site where sialic acid residues bound to glycoprotein were detected using the Limax flavus lectin. Sialyltransferase and sialic acid residues were not detected in medial and cis-cisternae of the Golgi apparatus. These findings suggest that in rat hepatocytes sialylation of N-linked glycoproteins occurs in the complex formed by the trans-cisternae and the trans-tubular network of Golgi apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W1549875078,"We have determined the nucleotide sequence of the Ri TL-DNA region from an Agrobacterium rhizogenes agropine-type plasmid using subcloned regions from the essentially identical Ri TL-DNAs from strains A4 and HRI. This sequenced region of 21,126 base pairs (bp) contains the complete TL-DNA region of the Ri plasmid as determined by analysis of TL-DNA borders in the genome of infected, clonal, Convolvulus arvensis plants. The left and right borders of the TL-DNA are flanked by 25-bp sequences which match the 25-bp terminal sequences found near the borders of T-DNA regions of Agrobacterium tumefaciens Ti plasmids. Other DNA sequences similar to these 25-bp terminal sequences are found within the TL region, and some of these sequences appear to be associated with Ri TL-DNA structures found in transformed tobacco plants. The TL-DNA region contains 18 open reading frames, many of which have 5' and 3' regulatory elements similar to those found in eukaryotic genes. In many cases, CCAAT and TATA elements were found upstream from putative transcriptional initiation codons, and poly(A) addition (AATAAA) elements were observed in presumed 3'-noncoding regions. Comparison of Ri TL-DNA coding and noncoding sequence regions with T-DNA sequence regions from octopine type Ti plasmid pTi15955 reveals no extensive sequence homologies."
https://openalex.org/W2168656510,"The lin-12 gene of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans controls certain binary decisions during development. The lin-12 locus was cloned by means of Tc1 transposon tagging: spontaneous lin-12 null alleles were isolated in a genetic background permissive for Tc1 transposition, and seven independently isolated mutations were found to be associated with Tc1 insertion events. All of these Tc1-induced mutations mapped to a single 2.9 kb restriction fragment within a 50 kb region examined. The DNA sequence of this fragment revealed that, although it does not contain the entire gene, it does include three complete exons. These three exons together encode 11 peptide units that are homologous to one another. The repeated peptide motif is also homologous to a set of mammalian proteins that includes epidermal growth factor."
https://openalex.org/W1967925725,"The role of the phosphoinositide turnover-protein kinase C pathway in mediating PDGF-stimulated c-myc expression and cell proliferation was studied. Both direct activators of kinase C (e.g. phorbol ester analogues) and hormones that activate kinase C via receptor-mediated phosphoinositide turnover (e.g. PDGF, bradykinin, or vasopressin) elicited a rapid increase in c-myc mRNA expression. Desensitization of the kinase C pathway by prolonged exposure to phorbol abolished the induction of c-myc by subsequent phorbol challenge and attenuated c-myc induction by PDGF and bradykinin, but did not affect PDGF-stimulated mitogenesis. Bradykinin and phorbol esters stimulated the same magnitude of c-myc expression as PDGF but elicited less than one-tenth the PDGF-induced mitogenic response. We conclude that stimulation of c-myc expression is a common response to a diverse group of agents that elicit phosphoinositide turnover and activate protein kinase C, and that neither activation of protein kinase C nor enhanced c-myc expression is sufficient for the mitogenic action of PDGF."
https://openalex.org/W2027562868,"Granulocytes and macrophages can be produced in vitro when progenitor cells from mouse bone marrow are stimulated by any of four distinct colony stimulating factors, Multi-CSF (IL-3), GM-CSF, G-CSF, and M-CSF (CSF-1). At 0°C the four CSFs do not cross-complete for binding to bone marrow cells, indicating that each has a specific cell surface receptor. However, at 21°C or 37°C, Multi-CSF inhibits binding of the other three CSFs and GM-CSF inhibits binding of G-CSF and M-CSF. Rather than competing directly for receptor binding, the binding of Multi-CSF, GM-CSF, or G-CSF to their own receptor induces the down-modulation (and thus activation) of other CSF receptors at 37°C. The pattern and potency of down-modulation activity exhibited by each type of CSF parallels the pattern and potency of its biological activity. We propose a model in which the biological interactions of the four CSFs are explained by their ability to down-modulate and activate lineage-specific receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1972693622,"The fushi tarazu (ftz) gene of Drosophila acts early in embryogenesis to regulate body segmentation. The localization of the ftz protein product in embryos was examined using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Antibodies were prepared against a beta-galactosidase-ftz hybrid protein made in E. coli. The ftz protein was first detectable in blastoderm-stage embryos as seven stripes of nuclei encircling the embryos transversely. The stripes persist through the early events of gastrulation, but disappear before overt segmentation is visible. The ftz protein is expressed a second time in some nuclei of the developing nervous system. In contrast to the early pattern, at the later stage, ftz is expressed in each of fifteen metameric subunits of the embryo."
https://openalex.org/W2059415989,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulates expression of a ""competence"" gene family in Balb/c-3T3 cells. The competence family contains the c-myc and c-fos genes together with several functionally uncharacterized genes (JE, KC, and r-fos) that have been isolated as cDNA clones. We show that double-stranded ribonucleic acid is a potent inducer of the competence gene family. Infection with vesicular stomatitis virus also induces expression of this gene family. Conversely, PDGF stimulates expression of genes hitherto characterized as responsive to double-stranded ribonucleic acids, including the beta-fibroblast interferon and (2'-5')-oligoadenylate synthetase genes. These PDGF-inducible genes could conceivably function in a feedback loop to control 3T3 cell growth. Some of the genes, such as c-fos and c-myc, are induced quickly by PDGF and may initiate a round of cell division. Others, such as beta-fibroblast interferon and (2'-5')-oligoadenylate synthetase, are induced more slowly and may function as feedback inhibitors of the growth response to PDGF."
https://openalex.org/W2057461143,"Cyclic AMP stimulation of chemotactically competent Dictyostelium amebas labeled with [32P]orthophosphate transiently increases phosphorylation in the heavy chain and the 18,000 dalton light chain of myosin. Immediately before the increase, heavy chain phosphorylation transiently decreases. These phosphorylation changes also occur when cAMP-induced activation of adenylate cyclase is blocked by pretreatment of amebas with caffeine. The time course of these phosphorylation responses correlates with the shape changes induced in amebas exposed to a temporal increase in cAMP concentration. The dose dependence of the phosphorylation responses is the same as that previously determined for chemotaxis. The phosphorylation responses exhibit adaptation properties in common with those of the shape change response and chemotaxis. Increases in the rate of myosin heavy chain and light chain phosphorylation can be observed in vitro by stimulating unlabeled amebas with cAMP and then lysing the cells into a γ-[32P]ATP-containing reaction mixture."
https://openalex.org/W1995580291,"In T4-infected cells, the gene 32 monocistronic mRNA is very stable. To study the molecular basis for this stability, we have constructed chimeric plasmids containing the monocistronic promoter and the gene 32 translation initiation sequence fused to either most of the E. coli lac operon or only a segment of the lacZ gene, followed by the gene 32 transcription terminator. The resulting hybrid transcripts are unstable in uninfected cells. In phage-infected cells, however, the hybrid mRNAs are at least as stable as gene 32 mRNA itself. Analysis of other plasmid constructs indicates that the sequences on the gene 32 mRNA from its 5' end to slightly beyond the initiation codon suffice to stabilize these hybrids. Studies with a series of deletions of the gene 32 leader sequence suggest that an RNA sequence near the gene 32 initiation codon is involved. Various models to explain this mRNA stabilization are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1533895575,"Specific binding of 3H-labeled platelet-activating factor (PAF) to rabbit platelet membranes was found to be regulated by monovalent and divalent cations and GTP. At 0 degrees C, inhibition of [3H]PAF binding by sodium is specific, with an ED50 of 6 mM, while Li+ is 25-fold less effective. On the contrary, K+, Cs+, and Rb+ enhance the binding. The divalent cations, Mg2+, Ca2+, and Mn2+ enhance the specific binding 8-10-fold. From both Scatchard and Klotz analyses, the inhibitory effect of Na+ is apparently due to an increase in the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of PAF binding to its receptors. However, the Mg2+-induced enhancement of the PAF specific binding may be attributed to an increased affinity of the receptor and an increased availability of the receptor sites. In the presence of Na+, PAF receptor affinity decreased with increasing temperature with a 100-fold sharp discontinuous decrease in receptor affinity at 24 degrees C. In contrast, the Mg2+-induced increase is independent of temperature suggesting that the Mg2+ regulatory site is different from Na+ regulatory site. [3H]PAF binding is also specifically inhibited by GTP; other nucleotides have little effect. PAF also stimulates hydrolysis of [gamma-32P]GTP with an ED50 of 0.7 nM, whereas 3-O-hexadecyl-2-O-acetyl-sn-glyceryl-1-phosphorylcholine showed no activity even at 10 microM. Moreover, such stimulatory effect of PAF is dependent on Na+ and can be abolished by the PAF-specific receptor antagonist, kadsurenone, but not by an inactive analog, kadsurin B. These results suggest that the PAF receptor may be coupled with the adenylate cyclase system via an inhibitory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein."
https://openalex.org/W1954984650,"125I-Labeled colony-stimulating factor (CSF) 2 alpha (interleukin 3, multi-CSF, and mast cell growth factor) was used to characterize receptors specific for this lymphokine on the cell surface of the factor-dependent cell line FDC-P2. CSF-2 alpha binding to these cells was specific and saturable. Among a panel of lymphokines and growth factors, only unlabeled CSF-2 alpha was able to compete for the binding of 125I-labeled CSF-2 alpha to cells. Equilibrium binding studies revealed that CSF-2 alpha bound to 434 +/- 281 receptors/cell with a Ka of 8.7 +/- 3.9 X 10(9) M-1. Affinity cross-linking experiments with the homobifunctional cross-linking reagents disuccinimidyl suberate, disuccinimidyl tartrate, and dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) produced a radiolabeled band of Mr = 97,000 on intact cells and in purified cell membranes, while an additional band of Mr = 138,000 was produced upon cross-linking to intact cells only. The relationship between these two bands is discussed. The results indicate that the receptor for CSF-2 alpha on FDC-P2 cells consists at a minimum of a subunit of Mr = 72,500."
https://openalex.org/W1984830582,"The replication initiator protein of the plasmid R6K binds to seven contiguous 22 bp direct repeats that form an indispensable part of the three replication origins α, β, and γ. Binding of the initiator to the direct repeats induced a marked bending of the region of γ replication origin. Binding of the initiator also promoted unwinding of the origin DNA by at least two turns. Distamycin appeared to antagonize the binding of the initiator to the seven 22 bp direct repeats. At the appropriate DNA and protein concentrations the initiator enhanced topoisomerase-induced catenation of the origin containing supercoiled DNA but not of DNA lacking the origin sequence. Thus, the initiator protein caused significant changes in the secondary and tertiary structures of the replication origin."
https://openalex.org/W1606180605,"Abstract Complementary DNA clones for human glucocerebrosidase were isolated from a human hepatoma library in lambda gt11. The complete nucleotide sequence of the 1805-base pair cDNA insert has been determined. In addition to 5' and 3' untranslated regions (51 and 206 base pairs, respectively), the cDNA insert contains 1548 base pairs that completely encode human glucocerebrosidase. All possible N-linked glycosylation sites are identified. Examination of the 19 amino acids of the leader polypeptide beginning with the ATG at position 52 revealed a hydrophobic core and a carboxyl-terminal glycine at the peptidase cleavage site, features consistent with the leader sequences described for other human translocated proteins. The Mr of 57,000 calculated from the 516 amino acids deduced from cDNA sequence is in good agreement with that identified by immunoprecipitation following in vitro translation of human placental mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1530724292,"4 beta-Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) modified the metabolic actions of three calcium-dependent hormones in different ways. The stimulations of glycogenolysis ureogenesis and phosphatidylinositol labeling produced by alpha 1-adrenergic agonist was blocked by the phorbol ester. In contrast, PMA slightly increased the stimulation of ureogenesis produced by low concentration of angiotensin II without modifying the maximal response. No effect of PMA was observed on the stimulation of ureogenesis induced by vasopressin. The stimulation of phosphatidylinositol labeling induced by vasopressin was decreased by PMA, whereas that induced by angiotensin II was not affected. In intact freshly isolated hepatocytes, [3H]prazosin binds with high affinity to a site which displays the characteristics of alpha 1-adrenergic receptor. Competitive inhibition studies with (-)-epinephrine reveal two different sites for this agonist: a high affinity site (Kd 9 nM) and a low affinity site (Kd 2 microM). In the presence of phorbol esters, (-)-epinephrine binding data now show the presence of a single class of low affinity sites, with similar affinity to those present in control cells. Thus, the inhibition of hepatocyte alpha 1-adrenergic action by PMA may be related to the loss of high affinity binding sites caused by the tumor promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1986472179,"A novel family of micronuclear elements termed telomere-bearing elements (TBEs) is described. All 1900 family members are eliminated during macronuclear development. We conclude that they are transposons, first because the members are moderately conserved in sequence and probably dispersed in the genome. Second, in two cases, sequence comparison of the termini and flanks of the element with the corresponding empty site indicate that elements cause 3 bp target duplications (AAT) upon insertion; the 3 bp are part of the 5 bp target sequence, AATGA. Lastly, both elements carry 77 or 78 bp inverted terminal repeats. The tip of each inverted terminal repeat is the 17 bp telomere-like sequence 5' C1A4C4A4C4. At least half of the elements have these 17 bp or an extremely similar sequence. One possible pathway for transposition into new micronuclear sites starts in the developing macronucleus with excision to create a free linear form to which telomeres are added, followed by a low frequency of movement to the micronucleus, and insertion into the germ-line micronuclear DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2100256724,"The germ-line micronuclear genome of the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila contains approximately 10(2) chromosome-internal blocks of tandemly repeated C4A2 sequences (mic C4A2). This repeated sequence is the telomeric sequence in the somatic macronucleus. Each of six cloned micC4A2 was found to be adjacent to a conserved 30 bp sequence, which we propose is the terminal inverted repeat of a family of DNA elements (the Tel-1 family). This 30 bp sequence contains a site for the infrequently cutting restriction enzyme Bst XI, which allows full-length Tel-1 elements to be cut out of the micronuclear genome. BAL 31 exonuclease digestion of Bst XI-cut micronuclear DNA showed the majority of micC4A2 blocks to be associated with the ends of the Tel-1 family. We propose that Tel-1 elements are transposable and suggest a novel mechanism to account for the origin of micC4A2, in which telomeric repeats are added to the ends of free linear forms of the transposable elements prior to reintegration."
https://openalex.org/W1533512868,"The cytoplasmic pH of human neutrophils was determined fluorometrically using carboxylated fluorescein derivatives. When normal neutrophils were activated by the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) in Na+-containing medium, the cytoplasmic pH initially decreased but then returned to near normal values. In Na+-free media or in Na+ medium containing amiloride, TPA induced a marked monophasic intracellular acidification. The cytoplasmic acidification is associated with net H+ equivalent efflux, suggesting metabolic acid generation. The metabolic pathways responsible for the acidification were investigated by comparing normal to chronic granulomatous disease neutrophils. These cells are unable to oxidize NADPH and generate superoxide. When treated with TPA in Na+-free or amiloride-containing media, chronic granulomatous disease cells did not display a cytoplasmic acidification. This suggests that in normal cells NADPH oxidation and/or the accompanying activation of the hexose monophosphate shunt are linked to the acidification. Unlike normal neutrophils, chronic granulomatous disease cells treated with TPA in Na+-containing medium displayed a significant cytoplasmic alkalinization. The alkalinization was Na+-dependent and amiloride-sensitive, indicating activation of Na+/H+ exchange. Thus, the Na+/H+ antiport, which can be indirectly stimulated by the metabolic cytoplasmic acidification, is also directly activated by the phorbol ester."
https://openalex.org/W1649091276,"The adaptation of the myocardium to mechanical overload which results in cardiac hypertrophy involves several membrane functions. The digitalis receptor in sarcolemma vesicles from hypertrophied rat hearts is characterized by binding of [3H]ouabain and ouabain-induced inhibition of (Na+,K+)-ATPase. The results show the existence of two families of ouabain binding sites with apparent dissociation constants (Kd) of 1.8-3.2 X 10(-8) M and 1-8 X 10(-6) M, respectively, which are similar to those found in normal hearts. The presence of the high affinity receptor in hypertrophied rat heart is correlated to a detectable inhibition of the (Na+,K+)-ATPase (IC50 = 1-3 X 10(-8) M). However, the high and low affinity sites in hypertrophied hearts bind and release ouabain at 4-5-fold slower rates than the corresponding sites in normal hearts. These properties are similar to that we observed in newborn rat cardiac preparations. Taken together with the expression of myosin isoforms (Schwartz, K., Lompre, A.M., Bouveret, P., Wisnewsky, C., and Whalen, R.G. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 23, 14412-14418), our data show that the physiological adaptation of the heart also involves the resurgence of the neonatal forms of the digitalis receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1535808294,"We have previously characterized two distinct pools of phosphatidylinositol (PI) in the WRK-1 rat mammary tumor cell, one whose metabolism is enhanced in response to vasopressin and another which is insensitive to hormonal manipulation. The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship between cellular phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and each of the two PI pools. We have found that in WRK-1 cells, vasopressin induces the rapid loss of PIP2 and the accumulation of inositol phosphates. By making use of kinetic differences in 32Pi uptake into the two pools of PI and assessing radioactivity levels in the 1-phosphate of PIP2, we have determined that hormone-sensitive PI is the precursor of approximately 60% of the cellular PIP2; the remainder is synthesized from the hormone-insensitive pool. Additional data indicate that PIP2 derived from hormone-sensitive PI is likewise hormone-sensitive, while that synthesized from hormone-insensitive PI remains stable over a long period of time and is not affected by the presence of vasopressin."
https://openalex.org/W1571082818,"The phosphoinositides are metabolized by phospholipase C in response to hormone or agonist stimulation in many cell types to produce diglyceride and water-soluble inositol phosphates. We have recently shown that the phospholipase C reaction products include cyclic phosphate esters of inositol. One of these, inositol 1, 2-cyclic 4,5-trisphosphate, is active in promoting Ca2+ mobilization in platelets and in inducing changes in conductance in Limulus photoreceptors similar to those produced by light (Wilson, D. B., Connolly, T. M., Bross, T. E., Majerus, P. W., Sherman, W. R., Tyler, A., Rubin, L. J., and Brown, J. E. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 13496-13501. In the current study, we have examined the metabolism of the inositol phosphates. We find that both cyclic and non-cyclic inositol trisphosphates are metabolized by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphomonoesterase, to inositol 1,2-cyclic bisphosphate and inositol 1,4-bisphosphate, respectively. However, the apparent Km of the enzyme for the cyclic substrate is approximately 10-fold higher than for the non-cyclic substrate. These inositol bisphosphates are more slowly degraded to inositol 1,2-cyclic phosphate and inositol 1-phosphate, respectively. Inositol 1,2-cyclic phosphate is then hydrolyzed to inositol 1-phosphate, which in turn is degraded to inositol and inorganic phosphate by inositol 1-phosphate phosphatase. The human platelet inositol 1,2-cyclic phosphate hydrolase enzyme and a similar rat kidney hydrolase do not utilize the cyclic polyphosphate esters of inositol as substrates. These results suggest that the inositol cyclic phosphates and the non-cyclic inositol phosphates are metabolized separately by phosphatases to cyclic and non-cyclic inositol monophosphates. The cyclic monophosphate is then converted to inositol 1-phosphate by a cyclic hydrolase. We suggest that the enzymes that metabolize the inositol phosphates may serve to regulate cellular responses to these compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1578633222,"Stabilization and inhibition of hepatic microsomal glucose-6-P phosphohydrolase (EC 3.1.3.9) by F- requires the presence of Al3+ ions. At millimolar concentrations, reagent grade NaF inhibited glucose-6-P hydrolysis and protected the enzyme against inactivation induced by heat in the presence of 0.025% (w/v) Triton X-100 or by reaction of the catalytic site with the histidine-specific reagent, diethyl pyrocarbonate. The presence of millimolar EDTA in all test systems abolished the effectiveness of NaF, yet EDTA by itself was without significant influence on the kinetics of phosphohydrolase reaction, the thermal stability of the enzyme or its reactivity with diethyl pyrocarbonate. Although ultrapure NaF was ineffectual in all test systems, its potency as a competitive inhibitor or protective agent was markedly increased by micromolar AlCl3 or when assays were carried out in flint glass test tubes. The latter response is explained by the well documented ability of fluoride solutions to extract Al3+ from glass at neutral pH. Our analysis indicates that the effectiveness of fluoride in all test systems derives from the formation of a specific complex with Al3+, most likely Al(F)4-. The apparent dissociation constant for interaction of the enzyme and Al(F)4- is 0.1 microM. The combination of NaF and AlCl3 holds promise as an unusually effective and versatile means to stabilize this notoriously labile enzyme during efforts to purify it."
https://openalex.org/W2061375987,"RF/J mice carry three endogenous ecotropic murine leukemia proviruses designated Emv-1, Emv-16, and Emv-17. Two of these proviruses, Emv-16 and Emv-17, are tightly linked and segregate with the high viremia phenotype in backcrossed mice. During the derivation of an SWR/J strain congenic for Emv-16 and Emv-17, we found that many of the progeny derived from female virus carriers acquired new germline ecotropic proviruses. Additional genetic crosses suggested that these proviruses are acquired early in development by virus infection and that this strain combination is particularly susceptible to these events. The frequency of proviral acquisition was only about 10-fold lower than the frequency of P element acquisition in dysgenic crosses of Drosophila melanogaster. Since virus integration in these hybrids occurs at many different sites, these types of hybrids may ultimately be useful for generating virally induced mutations that are amenable to study at the molecular level."
https://openalex.org/W1507245927,"Site-specific recombination in bacteriophage P1 occurs between two loxP sites in the presence of the Cre recombination protein. The structure of the 34-base pair loxP site consists of two 13-base pair inverted repeats separated by an 8-base pair spacer region. A mutation in the loxP site has been constructed which deletes one of the internal bases of the spacer region at the axis of dyad symmetry. This mutant loxP site shows a 10-fold reduction in recombination activity with a wild-type site both in vivo and in vitro. This low level of intramolecular recombination between a wild-type loxP site and the mutant loxP501 site is observed in vitro only when the DNA substrate is supercoiled. The majority of the supercoiled substrate is relaxed by the Cre protein, and on longer incubations, single-stranded nicks accumulate in the DNA. We have determined that these nicks occur in both the wild-type and the mutant sites. The positions of these nicks correspond to the positions of cleavage found during recombination of two wild-type sites, suggesting that the Cre protein is attempting to carry out recombination with the mutant site but most of the time this reaction is abortive. We have determined that the Cre protein relaxes a supercoiled topoisomer of a DNA substrate containing one wild-type site and one mutant site to yield a distribution of topoisomers whose linking numbers differ by steps of one, indicating that Cre can act as a type I topoisomerase."
https://openalex.org/W1976942424,"The noncoding regulatory region of polyoma (Py) virus regulates early and late mRNA transcription as well as DNA replication (Tyndall et al., NAR 9, 6231-6250, 1961). This segment of the viral genome also enhances the transcription of heterologous genes in chimeric plasmids (de Villiers and Schaffner, NAR 9,6251-6264, 1961) in a manner analogous to the SV40 enhancer and the LTR region of retroviruses (for review, see Khoury and Gruss, Cell 33, 313-314, 1963). The Py enhancer is of particular interest because sequence rearrangements in this region of the genome have been found frequently among “natural” viral strains (Ruley and Fried, J. Virol. 47 233-237, 1983). Moreover, the activity of the enhancer can be studied in the mouse, the most genetically well characterized mammal. Recently, much attention has been focused on the regulatory region of Py mutants that have a broader host range than wild type (wt) virus strains (such as those growing on embryonal carcinoma or trophoblast undifferentiated cells; Kelly and Condamine, BBA 657, 105-141, 1982; Tanaka et al., EMBO J. 7, 1521-1527, 1982); and Py mutants that grow at a higher rate on differentiated cells which further differentiate in vitro (such as neuroblastoma and Friend erythroleukemic cells; Maione et al., EMBO J. 4, in press; Delli Bovi et al., J. Virol. 49,566-571, 1984; De Simone et al., MCB 5, 2142-2146, 1985). Most of these mutants are characterized by rearrangements of the regulatory region. These rearrangements consist of either duplications or deletions that affect one or both of the two domains involved in the control of DNA replication and mRNA transcription, variously termed a and /I (Muller et al., J. Virol. 47, 586-599, 1983) or A and B (Herbomel et al., Cell 39, 653-662, 1984). The simplest wt Py strain, PyA2, carries a single copy of each of the two domains. Other naturally occurring Py strains (TOR, P16, and CSP) contain a duplication of the A domain, in addition to a few base pair changes (see figure). Sequence analysis of the regulatory region of Py mutants selected for their ability to grow in nonpermissive (undifferentiated) cells indicates that the rearrangements required for viral gene expression and replication in a new environment are host-specific and involve changes that are extensive in some cases and minor in others. The ability of Py mutants to grow on embryonal carcinoma PCC4 cells is always associated with extensive rearrangements (Vasseur et al., PNAS 77; 1068-1072, 1980; Katinka et al., Cell 20, 393-399, 1980; Melin et al., EMBO J. 4, 17991803,1985). Limited base alterations are sufficient for viral growth on the embryonal carcinoma F9 cell line, although Minireview"
https://openalex.org/W1580183193,"Treatment of amino acids, peptides, and proteins with aqueous solution of dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) resulted in the oxidation of methionine to methionine sulfoxide. In addition to methionine, SH groups are also oxidized, but this reaction proceeds after a lag period of 2 h. Other amino acids are not modified by aqueous Me2SO/HCl. The reaction is strongly pH-dependent. Optimal conditions are 1.0 M HCl, 0.1 M Me2SO, at 22 degrees C. The reaction exhibits pseudo-first order kinetics with Kobs = 0.23 +/- 0.015 M-1 min-1 at 22 degrees C. Incubation of methionine sulfoxide with dimethyl sulfide and HCl resulted in the conversion of methionine sulfoxide to methionine. This reaction is fast (t1/2 = 4 min at room temperature) and quantitative at relatively anhydrous condition (i.e. at H2O:concentrated HCl:dimethyl sulfide ratio of 2:20:1). Quantitative conversions of methionine sulfoxide back to methionine are obtained in peptides and proteins as well, with no observable other side reactions in amino acids and proteins. The wide applications of this selective oxidation and reduction of methionine residues are demonstrated and discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2048531934,"Genomic DNA encoding Sex-lethal, a developmental switch gene in Drosophila melanogaster that regulates sex determination and dosage compensation has been isolated. Wild-type DNA sequence organization of the gene has been compared at the restriction level with those of 17 female-specific, loss-of-function and five male-specific, gain-of-function mutant alleles. DNA lesions associated with 12 of these mutations delimit an 11 kb DNA region that is necessary for proper Sex-lethal function in females. Males who are deleted for this region are both viable and fertile. Loss-of-function alleles are associated with gross DNA alterations as well as true point mutations; the former are located throughout the region. In contrast, all five gain-of-function alleles are associated with DNA insertions that are clustered within a 1 kb portion of the Sxl gene region."
https://openalex.org/W1582324808,"Transport of long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) across the cytoplasmic membrane of Escherichia coli requires functional fadL and fadD genes. The fadD gene codes for an acyl-CoA synthetase (fatty acid: CoA ligase (AMP forming] which has broad chain length specificity and is loosely bound to the cytoplasmic membrane. The fadL gene codes for a 43,000-dalton cytoplasmic membrane protein which, acting by an unknown mechanism, is needed specifically for LCFA transport. As a first step to define the role of the fadL gene product, studies were performed to determine if it functions as a LCFA receptor. The LCFA-binding activity was quantitated in intact cells in the absence of LCFA transport by comparing the binding of LCFA in fadD fadL and fadD fadL+ strains. These studies revealed that (i) fadD fadL+ strains bind 6-fold more LCFA than fadD fadL strains; (ii) fadD fadL strains harboring a plasmid containing the fadL gene bind 16-fold more LCFA than fadD fadL strains harboring only the plasmid vector; and (iii) the fadL-specific LCFA-binding activity is regulated by the fadR gene and catabolite repression. Studies with fadL strains harboring fadL plasmids containing in vitro constructed deletions indicate that mutations which alter the physical properties of the 43,000-dalton fadL gene product also affect fadL gene product-specific LCFA-binding activity. Overall, these studies suggest that one role of the fadL gene product in the LCFA transport process is to sequester LCFA at sites in the cell membrane for transport."
https://openalex.org/W1597639234,"The nucleotide sequence of 1964 base pairs of the Escherichia coli K12 chromosome containing the autogenously regulated regulatory gene tyrR has been determined. The site of initiation of transcription of tyrR has been mapped by primer-extension analysis, and the initiation codon has been identified by site-specific deletion mutagenesis. The nucleotide sequence predicts a subunit molecular weight of 53,099 for the TyrR protein. Codon usage in the tyrR structural gene shows a bias toward those synonymic codons which are used rarely in efficiently expressed E. coli genes. The nucleotide sequence of a 22-base pair region adjacent to the promoter and distal to the structural gene exhibits considerable identity with corresponding regions of other genes regulated by tyrR. It is proposed that this is a site for repression by the TyrR protein."
https://openalex.org/W1523173873,"The chromatin structure of the 3'-nontranscribed spacer of the linear rRNA gene molecules of Tetrahymena thermophila was examined. This region includes the transcription termination site, two sets of recently identified conserved spacer repeats (Type IV and V repeats (Challoner, P. B., Amin, A. A., Pearlman, R. E., and Blackburn, E. H. (1985) Nucleic Acids Res. 13, 2661-2680], and the terminus of the molecule. Using sensitivity to nucleases as a probe, a unique chromatin structure was found in this rDNA region. Proceeding from the end of the rDNA molecule, the telomeric repeated sequence, (CCCCAA)n, was packaged in a non-nucleosomal complex adjacent to three phased nucleosomes. This nucleosomal structure was disrupted at the Type V repeat region, which, compared with the neighboring nucleosomal region, was more accessible to nucleases and, from both micrococcal nuclease and DNase I digestion results, was packaged in chromatin differently from the sequences flanking it on both sides. The region between the Type V repeats and adjacent to the transcription termination site was in yet another distinguishable chromatin structure as judged by its sensitivity to nucleases. It includes sites protected in chromatin and sites which were cleaved in chromatin but not detectably digested in DNA controls, suggesting that specific proteins are also associated with this region."
https://openalex.org/W1552602507,"The monoglycerol acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.22) (recommended name acylglycerol palmitoltransferase) activities from rat intestinal mucosa and suckling liver microsomes were compared in order to determine why substrate specificities differed in the two tissues. Suckling liver monoacylglycerol acyltransferase activity was highly specific for sn-2-mono-C18:1 glycerol and acylated rac-1-mono-C18:1 glycerol and 1- and 2-mono-C18:1 glycerol ethers poorly. In contrast, the substrate specificity of intestinal monoacylglycerol acyltransferase activity was broad. 1-Acyl- and 1- and 2-alkylglycerols were acylated at rates that were 45-78% of the rate observed with the preferred substrate sn-2-mono-C18:1 glycerol. Partial heat inactivation did not alter these relative specific activities, making it unlikely that intestinal microsomes contained a second acyltransferase capable of acylating the alternate substrates. The hypothesis that intestine and liver contain non-identical monoacylglycerol acyltransferase activities was further tested. Intestinal mucosa monoacylglycerol acyltransferase was much more thermolabile than the liver activity. Incubation with 50 microM diethylpyrocarbonate inactivated liver monoacylglycerol acyltransferase activity 84% but had little effect on the intestinal activity. Hydroxylamine completely reversed diethylpyrocarbonate inactivation, suggesting that critical histidine residues were more accessible in liver monoacylglycerol acyltransferase. 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid inactivated hepatic monoacylglycerol acyltransferase more than the intestinal activity, suggesting that critical lysine residues were more accessible. The intestinal and liver activities were also differently affected by acetone, detergents, MgCl2, phospholipids, and bovine serum albumin. Taken as a whole, the data strongly suggest that rat intestinal mucosa and suckling liver contain tissue-specific monoacylglycerol acyltransferase isoenzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1526553691,"The kinetic properties of highly purified human placental cytoplasmic 5'-nucleotidase were investigated. Initial velocity studies gave Michaelis constants for AMP, IMP, and CMP of 18, 30, and 2.2 microM, respectively. The enzyme shows the following relative Vmax values: CMP greater than UMP greater than dUMP greater than GMP greater than AMP greater than dCMP greater than IMP. The activity was magnesium-dependent, and this cation binds sequentially with a Km of 14 microM for AMP and an apparent Km of 6 mM for magnesium. A large variety of purine, pyrimidine, and pyridine compounds exert an inhibitory effect on enzyme activity. IMP, GMP, and NADH produce almost 100% inhibition at 1.0 mM. Nucleoside di- and triphosphates are potent inhibitors. ATP and ADP are competitive inhibitors with respect to AMP and IMP as substrates with Ki values of 100 and 15 microM, respectively. Inorganic phosphate is a noncompetitive inhibitor with Ki values of 19 and 43 mM. Nucleosides and other compounds studied produce only a modest decrease of enzyme activity at 1 mM. Our findings suggest that the enzyme is regulated under physiological conditions by the concentrations of magnesium, nucleoside 5'-monophosphates, and nucleoside di- and triphosphates. The nucleotide pool concentration regulates the enzyme possibly by a mechanism of heterogeneous metabolic pool inhibition. These properties of human placental cytoplasmic 5'-nucleotidase may be related to the control of nucleotide degradation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1577771017,"The effect of the alkaloid lycorine on viral protein synthesis was studied in poliovirus-infected HeLa cells. The incorporation of [3H]leucine was inhibited by lycorine in a dose-dependent way, although lycorine never completely abolished translation. Using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the viral proteins were identified as derived from the P1 (5‘ terminal), P2 (middle), or P3 (3‘ terminal) region of the poliovirus translation unit. The residual labeling of viral proteins in the presence of lycorine was mainly due to synthesis of P1 proteins and slightly less to P2 proteins, while virtually no P3-derived proteins were made. It is suggested that lycorine may act at the level of termination."
https://openalex.org/W2008808598,"Nuclear extracts from human cells infected with pseudorabies virus (PRV) exhibited higher levels of accurate transcription of RNA polymerase II genes than did control extracts from mock-infected cells. Stimulation was maximal at low DNA concentrations and was not gene-specific. It was heat sensitive in extracts from cells infected with a virus containing a temperature sensitive mutation in the immediate early (IE) gene. The stimulatory activity copurified from the IE protein and was also heat sensitive when purified with cells infected with tsG, further indicating that the IE protein was responsible for this stimulation. These results thus demonstrate an in vitro system that mimics, at least in part, the in vivo stimulatory action of the PRV IE protein. They further imply that the IE protein acts not by increasing the amounts of cellular transcription factors, but rather by directly or indirectly altering their activities."
https://openalex.org/W1484045790,"Restriction fragments of genomic Rhodospirillum rubrum DNA were selected according to size by electrophoresis followed by hybridization with [32P]mRNA encoding the two B880 holochrome polypeptides. The fragments were cloned into Escherchia coli C600 with plasmid pBR327 as a vector. The clones were selected by colony hybridization with 32P-holochrome-mRNA and counterselected by hybridization with Rs. rubrum ribosomal RNA, a minor contaminant of the mRNA preparation. Chimeric plasmid pRR22 was shown to contain the B880 genes by hybrid selection of B880 holochrome-mRNA. We report a restriction map of its 2.2-kilobase insert and the sequence of a 430 base pair fragment thereof. Genes alpha and beta are nearly contiguous, indicating that they are transcribed as a single operon. The predicted amino acid sequences coincide with the sequences of the alpha and beta polypeptides established in other laboratories, except for additional C-terminal tails of 10 and 13 amino acid residues, respectively. We suggest that these tail sequences may serve, during membrane assembly, to give these intrinsic membrane proteins their peculiar orientation with their C-terminus facing the periplasm and their N terminus facing the cytoplasm. Intraspecific sequence homology between the alpha and beta genes of R. rubrum is low, showing no evolutionary relatedness. This is in contrast to the high interspecific homology between the corresponding sequences of Rs. rubrum and Rhodopseudomonas capsulata B880 genes."
https://openalex.org/W1988355510,"To determine the function of c-fps in chicken macrophages and granulocytic cells we have infected chicken bone marrow cells with retroviruses containing the v-fps oncogene. Normal chicken macrophage progenitors, M-CFCs, give rise to macrophage colonies in semisolid cultures when macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) is added into the culture medium. Upon infection with v-fps bearing retroviruses, we observed that M-CFCs were induced to develop macrophage colonies in vitro without exogenous M-CSF. This activation results from a direct effect of v-fps on the M-CFCs. No leukemic transformation was observed in the infected colonies. By comparing the effects of several retroviruses, we showed that the induction of M-CFC development is specific to v-fps containing viruses and mediated by the v-fps protein. These observations support the hypothesis that the c-fps gene is involved in the control of proliferation and/or differentiation of myeloid cells."
https://openalex.org/W1570668711,"Five monoclonal anti-Z-DNA antibodies were characterized with respect to their binding of synthetic nucleic acid polymers and of supercoiled circular plasmid DNA. All of the antibodies reacted only with DNA in the Z-conformation; however, they fell into two classes on the basis of sequence specificity. One class, with broad specificity, reacted well with all sequences in the Z-form, including poly(dG-dC), poly(dG-dm5C), and poly (dG-dBr5C) in linear polymers and poly(dG-dC)n and poly[(dC-dA)n.(dT-dG)n] sequences in supercoiled plasmids. The other class bound only Z-DNA formed by poly(dG-dC). Binding of the monoclonal antibodies specifically to inserts of Z-DNA-forming sequences in plasmids was mapped directly by cross-linking of antibody to the DNA, digestion with restriction nuclease, and electrophoretic analysis of both the unbound fragments and the bound fragments recovered from immune complexes. The monoclonal antibodies were used for indirect immunofluorescence staining of Drosophila polytene chromosomes fixed by two procedures. One procedure yielded chromosomes with Z-specific antibody binding in many interbands, a few specific bands, and parts of some puffs. On chromosomes fixed by the second procedure, antibody staining appeared to follow the DNA concentration, staining all bands brightly. For each fixation procedure, chromosomes showed the same staining pattern with each of the broad specificity monoclonal antibodies that had been seen with polyclonal antibodies. The antibodies that reacted only with poly(dG-dC) and poly (dG-dC)n plasmid inserts did not stain chromosomes fixed by either protocol. We conclude that stretches of poly(dG-dC)n sequences do not contribute significantly to the presence of Z-DNA in fixed polytene chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster."
https://openalex.org/W1481040308,"Purified preparations of insulin, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors were compared for their abilities to phosphorylate purified hen oviduct progesterone receptors. The specific activities of all three peptide hormone-induced receptor kinases were first defined using a synthetic tridecapeptide tyrosine protein kinase substrate. Next, equivalent ligand-activated activities of the three receptor kinases were tested for their abilities to phosphorylate hen oviduct progesterone receptor. Both the insulin and EGF receptors phosphorylated progesterone receptor at high affinity, exclusively at tyrosine residues and with maximal stoichiometries that were near unity. In contrast, the PDGF receptor did not recognize progesterone receptor as a substrate. Insulin decreased the Km of the insulin receptor for progesterone receptor subunits as substrates, but had no significant effect on Vmax values. On the other hand, EGF increased the Vmax of the EGF receptor for progesterone receptor subunits as substrates. Phosphorylation of progesterone receptor by the insulin and EGF receptor kinases differed in two additional ways. 1) EGF-activated receptor phosphorylated the 80- and 105-kDa progesterone receptor subunits to an equal extent, whereas insulin-activated receptor preferentially phosphorylated the 80-kDa subunit. 2) Phosphopeptide fingerprinting analyses revealed that while insulin and EGF receptors phosphorylated one identical major site on both progesterone receptor subunits, they differed in their specificities for other sites."
https://openalex.org/W1565066293,"Rat growth hormone (rGH) gene expression is regulated by glucocorticoids in vivo and in cultured pituitary cells. After the co-transfer of a plasmid containing the rGH gene into mouse L-cells (with or without the simian virus 40 enhancer), little or no normal rGH mRNA is produced. Instead, the predominant rGH gene transcripts are about 0.75 kilobase pairs (kb); these lack the first two exons of the rGH but possess a 3' end that terminates accurately. Nevertheless, the levels of these transcripts are increased by glucocorticoids. When all of the rat sequences 5' to an Xho1 site located 7 nucleotides downstream from the rGH gene physiological cap site are deleted and the mutant gene introduced into L-cells, the transfectant cell lines still produce the 0.75-kb transcripts; however, in addition, these cells produce a more abundant 1.1-kb mRNA that has a 3' terminus similar to that of rGH mRNA, but whose 5' termini begin in the region of, but not at, the initiation site used in pituitary cells. Both of these transcripts are increased 3- to 5-fold by 1 microM concentration of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone. These data indicate that 1) deletion of all of the rGH gene 5' flanking sequences allows formation of approximately full length transcripts and 2) sequences containing information for regulation of rGH gene expression in L-cells by glucocorticoids are contained in the structural portion of the gene and/or the 3' flanking sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1570948688,"Abstract Flavocytochrome c552 from Chromatium vinosum catalyzes the oxidation of sulfide to sulfur using a soluble c-type cytochrome as an electron acceptor. Mitochondrial cytochrome c forms a stable complex with flavocytochrome c552 and may function as an alternative electron acceptor in vitro. The recognition site for flavocytochrome c552 on equine cytochrome c has been deduced by differential chemical modification of cytochrome c in the presence and absence of flavocytochrome c552 and by kinetic analysis of the sulfide:cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity of m-trifluoromethylphenylcarbamoyl-lysine derivatives of cytochrome c. As with mitochondrial redox partners, interaction occurs around the exposed heme edge at the front face of cytochrome c. However, the domain recognized by flavocytochrome c552 seems to extend to the right of the heme edge, whereas the site of interaction with mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase and reductase is more to the left. Km but not Vmax of the electron transfer reaction with mitochondrial cytochrome c increases with increasing ionic strength. The correlation of chemical modification and ionic strength dependence data indicates that the electrostatic interaction between the two hemoproteins involves fewer ionic bonds than that with other redox partners of cytochrome c."
https://openalex.org/W1544639978,"A rapid light-induced decrease in cGMP is thought to play a role in regulating the permeability or light sensitivity of photoreceptor membranes. Photo-excited rhodopsin activates a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G-protein) by catalyzing the exchange of bound GDP for GTP. This G-protein X GTP complex activates the phosphodiesterase resulting in a decrease in cGMP concentration. We have observed two processes in vitro which may be relevant for the regulation of G-protein activation. First, we have found that free GDP binds to G-protein with an affinity similar to that of GTP. These two nucleotides appear to compete for a common site. Since G-protein X GDP does not activate phosphodiesterase, light-induced changes in the GTP/GDP ratio known to occur on illumination may serve to reduce G-protein activation and hence reduce phosphodiesterase activation. Second, addition of cGMP in the presence of equimolar GTP and GDP causes GTP binding to G-protein to be enhanced compared to GDP binding. This effect increases as the cGMP concentration is increased from 0.05 to 2 mM. Thus, light-induced decreases in cGMP concentration may also act as a feedback control in reducing G-protein activation. One or both of these processes may be involved in the desensitization (light adaptation) of rod photoreceptors."
https://openalex.org/W1486637516,"A nuclease S1 mapping procedure was used to identify sites accessible to nucleases in the 3'-noncoding region of the rabbit globin mRNAs. A complex structure was evident in the alpha-globin species, with one highly accessible single-stranded site, large portions in an accessible double-stranded configuration, and a portion not accessible to any of the nucleases. In the beta-globin mRNA, the region was more uniformly accessible to RNase T1 and to a cobra venom enzyme specific for double-stranded RNA, but it had only a single site highly accessible to a bulkier Neurospora endonuclease. The patterns of cleavage were nearly identical in the deproteinized mRNAs and in the mRNAs associated with polyribosomes in reticulocyte extracts. In both species, a zone of secondary structure occurred around the poly(A) junction. In each species, virtually all the molecules had a poly(A) sequence of at least 20-25 AMP residues. A periodicity in poly(A) size distribution was observed. These results indicate that the beginning of this sequence is well protected against degradation inside the cell and that zones of partial protection occur at measured intervals. In crude extracts, where the poly(A) is covered with proteins, this sequence was protected against nuclease digestion."
https://openalex.org/W1531853780,"Regulation of the biosynthesis of the sodium- and potassium-activated adenosine triphosphatase (Na,K-ATPase) (EC 3.6.1.3) was studied in the developing brine shrimp, Artemia salina. Measurement of levels of the subunits of the Na,K-ATPase by radioimmunoassay indicated the presence of both alpha and beta subunits in undeveloped cysts and developing embryos prior to the appearance of enzymatic activity. The quantity of each subunit increased dramatically between 8 and 24 h of development and then reached a plateau at about 32 h. The quantities of translationally active mRNA alpha and mRNA beta were also determined. Undeveloped cysts contained mRNA alpha and mRNA beta, and the amounts increased 9- and 3-fold, respectively, during the first 24 h of development. The data suggest that the increase in Na,K-ATPase activity was at least in part due to increases in protein synthesis related to changes in mRNA levels. The data also suggest involvement of additional regulatory mechanisms. The alpha-subunit has been detected as two molecular weight forms (alpha 1 and alpha 2) which demonstrate changes in relative amounts during development (Peterson, G. L., Churchill, L., Fisher, J. A., and Hokin, L. E. (1982) J. Exp. Zool. 221, 295-308). We show here that this was not due to changes in mRNA alpha 1 and mRNA alpha 2."
https://openalex.org/W1520646618,Certain structural features of secreted proteins may function as sorting to direct the various steps required in the secretory pathway. In order to identify and study the function of these signals we have cloned a complete cDNA gene encoding rat serum albumin (RSA) and expressed this gene in COS-1 cells via an SV40-plasmid shuttle vector. The gene was constructed by splicing together a segment of genomic DNA and three cDNA fragments excised from recombinant plasmids. DNA endonuclease digestion and ligation at restriction sites common to overlapping regions of these four RSA DNA fragments assured the maintenance of the translation reading frame during the construction of this gene. COS-1 cells transfected with the recombinant vector containing the full-length RSA gene (pSV2rsa) synthesize and secrete RSA immunoreactive material into the culture medium. This mammalian expression system provides a means to study the signals and processes involved in intracellular transport of secreted proteins.
https://openalex.org/W1592532195,"Amino acid transport was studied in C1 cells which contain amplified levels of sodium- and potassium-activated adenosine triphosphatase (Na,K-ATPase), in C4 cells which are ouabain-sensitive revertants, and in parental HeLa S3. Sodium-dependent uptake of aminoisobutyric acid and alanine was increased 2-fold in the amplified C1 cells. After a 6 h amino acid starvation period, the rate of sodium-dependent uptake of methylaminoisobutyric acid was 70-90% greater for C1 than for C4 and HeLa. This uptake was inhibitable by ouabain and the apparent Km values for high affinity uptake were similar in all three lines. Overall, neutral amino acid uptake through Systems A, ASC, and L was 2-fold higher in the Na,K-ATPase amplified C1 cells relative to C4 or HeLa. The induction of System A uptake of methylaminoisobutyric acid after starvation was more rapid in both the amplified C1 cells and the revertant C4 when compared to HeLa, which suggests that the selection for amplification of the Na,K-ATPase produced membrane alterations affecting the adaptive regulation of System A."
https://openalex.org/W1571575413,"To clarify the function of cyclic nucleotides in rod outer segments (ROS) of frog retinas, we studied cyclic nucleotide-dependent phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of protein. cGMP or cAMP with [gamma-32P]ATP in the dark enhanced the phosphorylation of two ROS proteins with Mr = 10,500 (Band 1) and 8,500 (Band 2) according to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. The phosphorylation was maximally enhanced at 2.0 mM cGMP and cAMP in the presence of Mg2+. The cGMP-activated protein kinase showed near-optimal activity between pH 6.5 and 8.0. GMP, GDP, GTP, AMP, and ADP did not enhance the phosphorylation. The stoichiometry of the phosphate incorporated into Bands 1 and 2 could not be calculated because the amount of Bands 1 and 2 was too small to measure. Both 32P-phosphorylated Bands 1 and 2 (32P-Bands 1 and 2) were solubilized during preparation and the molecular weight of each, in the native preparation, was 19,000. Their isoelectric point was 5.2. The sites of phosphorylation were the serine residue(s). DEAE-Sephadex A-50 column chromatography gave a good separation of Bands 1 and 2 from other 32P-phosphoproteins at 60 mM NaCl. Dephosphorylation of 32P-Bands 1 and 2 in dark-adapted ROS suspension required Mn2+ or Mg2+; the former was more effective than the latter at concentrations below 0.5 mM. Both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation were inhibited by Zn2+."
