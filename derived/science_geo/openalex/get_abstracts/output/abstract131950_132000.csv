https://openalex.org/W2056204715,"T cells with variable region V δ 1 γδ T cell receptors (TCRs) are distributed throughout the human intestinal epithelium and may function as sentinels that respond to self antigens. The expression of a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I–related molecule, MICA, matches this localization. MICA and the closely related MICB were recognized by intestinal epithelial T cells expressing diverse V δ 1 γδ TCRs. These interactions involved the α1α2 domains of MICA and MICB but were independent of antigen processing. With intestinal epithelial cell lines, the expression and recognition of MICA and MICB could be stress-induced. Thus, these molecules may broadly regulate protective responses by the V δ 1 γδ T cells in the epithelium of the intestinal tract."

Genetic and biochemical studies revealed that OxyR is activated through the formation of a disulfide bond and is deactivated by enzymatic reduction with glutaredoxin 1 (Grx1). The gene encoding Grx1 is regulated by OxyR, thus providing a mechanism for autoregulation. The redox potential of OxyR was determined to be –185 millivolts, ensuring that OxyR is reduced in the absence of stress. These results represent an example of redox signaling through disulfide bond formation and reduction."

The solar wind interaction with Mars is in many ways similar to that at Venus and at an active comet, that is, primarily an ionospheric-atmospheric interaction. No significant planetary magnetic field of global scale has been detected to date (&lt;2 × 10 21 Gauss–cubic centimeter), but here the discovery of multiple magnetic anomalies of small spatial scale in the crust of Mars is reported."
https://openalex.org/W2108643025,"Process improvements in silica membrane fabrication, especially the use of clean-room techniques, resulted in silica membranes without detectable mesoscopic defects, resulting in significantly improved transport properties. Supported membranes calcined at 400°C were 30 nanometers in thickness, showed a H 2 permeance at 200°C of 2 × 10 −6 moles per square meter per second per Pascal (mol m −2 s −1 Pa −1 ), and had a CH 4 permeance more than 500 times smaller. Molecules larger than CH 4 were completely blocked. Silica membranes calcined at 600°C showed no detectable CH 4 flux, with a H 2 permeance of 5 × 10 −7 (mol m −2 s −1 Pa −1 ) at 200°C. These results signify an important step toward the industrial application of these membranes such as purification of H 2 and natural gas as well as the selective removal of CO 2 ."

Correctly folded proteins are exported from the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas incorrectly folded proteins are retained by a quality control system. The type I membrane-protein calnexin and its soluble homologue calreticulin are constituents of this system that recognize monoglucosylated N-linked glycans that are present on unfolded glycoproteins. Although several components of the quality control apparatus are well characterized, it is not known whether and how they interact with enzymes that catalyze protein folding. The endoplasmic reticulum protein ERp57 is homologous to protein-disulfide isomerase and can be cross-linked to the same monoglucosylated glycoproteins that bind to calnexin and calreticulin. The present study demonstrates that the disulfide isomerase activity of ERp57 on the refolding of monoglucosylated ribonuclease B is much greater when this glycoprotein is associated with calnexin or calreticulin. This result is in contrast to protein-disulfide isomerase, whose activity on monoglucosylated ribonuclease B is decreased in the presence of these lectins. No direct binding of monoglucosylated ribonuclease B or monoglucosylated glycans to ERp57 could be detected, but we show that ERp57 interacts directly with calnexin.

The quality control system of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase; RNase B, ribonuclease B; G1, monoglucosylated; UGGT, UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase; ΔTMC, lumenal domain of canine calnexin; CB, Coomassie Blue; AR, autoradiography; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Endo H, endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H. 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase; RNase B, ribonuclease B; G1, monoglucosylated; UGGT, UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase; ΔTMC, lumenal domain of canine calnexin; CB, Coomassie Blue; AR, autoradiography; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Endo H, endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H. ensures that only folded proteins proceed further along the secretory pathway. Some of the abundant ER proteins are components of molecular chaperone systems that bind to unfolded proteins, retaining them in the ER. The folding enzymes are also abundant in the ER and comprise several disulfide isomerases and prolyl peptidyl isomerases (1Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 2Bose S. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). How chaperones and folding enzymes interact to facilitate protein folding in the ER is not known.Calnexin and calreticulin participate in a molecular chaperone system that integrates the processes of N-glycosylation and quality control (3Bergeron J.J.M. Brenner M.B. Thomas D.Y. Williams D.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 4Helenius A. Trombetta E.S. Hebert D.N. Simons J.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 193-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). They both are lectins that bind N-glycans of the form GlcNAc2Man9Glc1 that result from the removal of the two outer glucoses from GlcNAc2Man9Glc3 oligosaccharides by the sequential action of glucosidases I and II. Removal of the last glucose by glucosidase II prevents binding by calnexin and calreticulin. Then, if the glycoprotein is unfolded, a glucose residue is added back to the high mannose core by the enzyme UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT),which recognizes unfolded proteins (5Sousa M. Parodi A.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4196-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Consequently, during folding glycoproteins undergo cycles of binding and release from calnexin and calreticulin, which are driven by the addition and removal of a glucose residue (4Helenius A. Trombetta E.S. Hebert D.N. Simons J.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 193-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). As a result of the specificity of UGGT, only unfolded glycoproteins bind to calnexin and calreticulin in vivo (6Ou W.J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 7Peterson J.R. Ora A. Van P.N. Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), even though these lectins do not recognize the conformation of their protein substrates (8Rodan A.R. Simons J.F. Trombetta E.S. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6921-6930Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 9Zapun A. Petrescu S.M. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 29-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar).Monoglucosylated glycoproteins, in addition to binding to calnexin and calreticulin, can also be cross-linked to the ER protein ERp57 (also known as ER-60, ERp60, ERp61, GRP58, P58, HIP-70, or Q-2; Ref. 10Oliver J.D. van der Wal F.J. Bulleid N.J. High S. Science. 1997; 275: 86-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar; Ref.11Elliott J.G. Oliver J.D. High S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13849-13855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar and references therein). ERp57 is homologous to protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) and has been shown to exhibit thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase activity in vitro (12Bourdi M. Demady D. Martin J.L. Jabbour S.K. Martin B.M. George J.W. Pohl L.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).We demonstrate here, using an in vitro system that reconstitutes the binding of monoglucosylated RNase B (G1-RNase B) to the lumenal domain of calnexin, that ERp57 exhibits a remarkably increased disulfide isomerase activity on a calnexin-bound substrate.DISCUSSIONPDI has been studied for 35 years, and its activity seemed sufficient to account for the rapid formation of disulfide bonds in the ER. Indeed, an amount of PDI equivalent to that found in an ER extract produced similar in vitro refolding rates of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor as the total extract (23Zapun A. Creighton T.E. Rowling P.J.E. Freedman R.B. Proteins. 1992; 14: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Other thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases similar in sequence to PDI were later also found in the ER, but their functions have remained elusive. Currently, five additional PDI-like proteins have been identified in mammals: ERp57, ERp72, P5 (reviewed in Ref. 1Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), PDIR (24Hayano T. Kikuchi M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 210-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and PDIp, which is specific to the pancreas (25Desilva M.G. Lu J. Donadel G. Modi W.S. Xie H. Notkins A.L. Lan M.S. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). That ERp57 could be cross-linked to the same substrates as calnexin and calreticulin was the first indication that the various PDI-like proteins might be dedicated to different classes of proteins (10Oliver J.D. van der Wal F.J. Bulleid N.J. High S. Science. 1997; 275: 86-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), and we show here that this is associated with a functional difference between Erp57 and PDI.We demonstrate that the catalysis of disulfide bond rearrangement by ERp57 is more efficient on G1-glycoproteins in the presence of calnexin or calreticulin. This apparent specificity does not result from a direct recognition of the glycans by ERp57. A simple model to account for the greater efficiency of ERp57 on glycoproteins that are bound to calnexin or calreticulin is depicted in Fig. 3. As both the substrate and the enzyme are brought into close proximity by their respective interaction with the lectin, their relative local concentration is increased, producing an apparent enhancement of the catalytic activity of ERp57.In addition to the function of calnexin of retaining unfolded proteins in the ER, the affinity of calnexin for ERp57 serves to recruit this enzyme where it is needed. Disulfide bond formation and rearrangement, catalyzed by ERp57, can then occur while the glycoprotein is bound to calnexin. Therefore, the retention of unfolded proteins and the facilitation of their folding can be coordinated by calnexin and ERp57. In contrast, no cooperation between the PDI-like protein ERp72 or P5 and the chaperones BiP and GRP94 could be detected in vitro(26Rupp K. Birnbach U. Lundstrom J. Van P.N. Soling H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2501-2507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).For proteins with multiple oligosaccharides such as influenza hemagglutinin, simultaneous binding to a multivalent calnexin may constrain the conformation of the protein so as to inhibit folding. Locking influenza hemagglutinin onto calnexin has been shown to inhibit the formation of disulfide bonds (27Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2961-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). This class of glycoprotein may require at least partial release from calnexin, driven by glucosidase II, to undergo folding and disulfide bond formation, which may then be catalyzed by ERp57.Following cross-linking, ERp57 has been found in ternary complexes containing ERp57, a substrate protein and either calnexin or calreticulin (11Elliott J.G. Oliver J.D. High S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13849-13855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In view of the increased activity of ERp57 on G1-RNase B in the presence of calreticulin, it is likely that ERp57 also interacts directly with calreticulin. An interaction between PDI and calreticulin, possibly dependent on Zn2+ ions, has also been reported (28Baksh S. Burns K. Andrin C. Michalak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31338-31344Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). That PDI binds unfolded proteins is supported by the chaperone activity, which PDI exhibits (29Puig A. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7764-7771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) even on a protein without disulfide bonds (30Cai H. Wang C.C. Tsou C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24550-24552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and which can be separated from the oxidoreductase activity by alkylating the active site cysteines (31Quan H. Fan G. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17078-17080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). When substrates are bound to calnexin or calreticulin, their binding to PDI may be restricted, thus impeding the isomerase activity. Either ERp57 has a conformation that avoids this problem of steric hinderance or the role of handling the substrate is played entirely by the lectins.The elution properties of ΔTMC in size exclusion chromatography indicate an apparent molecular mass of 280 kDa, corresponding to a pentamer or hexamer, which is in agreement with some estimates of size of the complex in vivo (6Ou W.J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) but not others, which indicated that most calnexin may be monomeric (32Tatu U. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We do not yet have an explanation for these discrepancies.The functional interaction between ERp57 and calnexin or calreticulin demonstrates that N-glycosylation does not only contribute to quality control but also to accelerating productive folding. This study also suggests that other overlooked or difficult to detect interactions may add functionality to the other members of the PDI family. The speculative ER matrix formed by a loose association of resident ER proteins (32Tatu U. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) may be a network that creates powerful synergies between the various chaperone systems of the quality control machinery and the enzymes that accelerate folding. The quality control system of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase; RNase B, ribonuclease B; G1, monoglucosylated; UGGT, UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase; ΔTMC, lumenal domain of canine calnexin; CB, Coomassie Blue; AR, autoradiography; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Endo H, endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H. 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase; RNase B, ribonuclease B; G1, monoglucosylated; UGGT, UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase; ΔTMC, lumenal domain of canine calnexin; CB, Coomassie Blue; AR, autoradiography; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Endo H, endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H. ensures that only folded proteins proceed further along the secretory pathway.

Indeed, an amount of PDI equivalent to that found in an ER extract produced similar in vitro refolding rates of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor as the total extract (23Zapun A. Creighton T.E. Rowling P.J.E. Freedman R.B. Proteins. 1992; 14: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Other thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases similar in sequence to PDI were later also found in the ER, but their functions have remained elusive. Currently, five additional PDI-like proteins have been identified in mammals: ERp57, ERp72, P5 (reviewed in Ref. 1Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), PDIR (24Hayano T. Kikuchi M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 210-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and PDIp, which is specific to the pancreas (25Desilva M.G. Lu J. Donadel G. Modi W.S. Xie H. Notkins A.L. Lan M.S. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). That ERp57 could be cross-linked to the same substrates as calnexin and calreticulin was the first indication that the various PDI-like proteins might be dedicated to different classes of proteins (10Oliver J.D. van der Wal F.J. Bulleid N.J. High S. Science. 1997; 275: 86-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), and we show here that this is associated with a functional difference between Erp57 and PDI. We demonstrate that the catalysis of disulfide bond rearrangement by ERp57 is more efficient on G1-glycoproteins in the presence of calnexin or calreticulin. This apparent specificity does not result from a direct recognition of the glycans by ERp57. A simple model to account for the greater efficiency of ERp57 on glycoproteins that are bound to calnexin or calreticulin is depicted in Fig. 3. As both the substrate and the enzyme are brought into close proximity by their respective interaction with the lectin, their relative local concentration is increased, producing an apparent enhancement of the catalytic activity of ERp57. In addition to the function of calnexin of retaining unfolded proteins in the ER, the affinity of calnexin for ERp57 serves to recruit this enzyme where it is needed. Disulfide bond formation and rearrangement, catalyzed by ERp57, can then occur while the glycoprotein is bound to calnexin. Therefore, the retention of unfolded proteins and the facilitation of their folding can be coordinated by calnexin and ERp57. In contrast, no cooperation between the PDI-like protein ERp72 or P5 and the chaperones BiP and GRP94 could be detected in vitro(26Rupp K. Birnbach U. Lundstrom J. Van P.N. Soling H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2501-2507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For proteins with multiple oligosaccharides such as influenza hemagglutinin, simultaneous binding to a multivalent calnexin may constrain the conformation of the protein so as to inhibit folding. Locking influenza hemagglutinin onto calnexin has been shown to inhibit the formation of disulfide bonds (27Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2961-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). This class of glycoprotein may require at least partial release from calnexin, driven by glucosidase II, to undergo folding and disulfide bond formation, which may then be catalyzed by ERp57. Following cross-linking, ERp57 has been found in ternary complexes containing ERp57, a substrate protein and either calnexin or calreticulin (11Elliott J.G. Oliver J.D. High S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13849-13855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In view of the increased activity of ERp57 on G1-RNase B in the presence of calreticulin, it is likely that ERp57 also interacts directly with calreticulin. An interaction between PDI and calreticulin, possibly dependent on Zn2+ ions, has also been reported (28Baksh S. Burns K. Andrin C. Michalak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31338-31344Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). That PDI binds unfolded proteins is supported by the chaperone activity, which PDI exhibits (29Puig A. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7764-7771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) even on a protein without disulfide bonds (30Cai H. Wang C.C. Tsou C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24550-24552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and which can be separated from the oxidoreductase activity by alkylating the active site cysteines (31Quan H. Fan G. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17078-17080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). When substrates are bound to calnexin or calreticulin, their binding to PDI may be restricted, thus impeding the isomerase activity. Either ERp57 has a conformation that avoids this problem of steric hinderance or the role of handling the substrate is played entirely by the lectins. The elution properties of ΔTMC in size exclusion chromatography indicate an apparent molecular mass of 280 kDa, corresponding to a pentamer or hexamer, which is in agreement with some estimates of size of the complex in vivo (6Ou W.J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) but not others, which indicated that most calnexin may be monomeric (32Tatu U. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We do not yet have an explanation for these discrepancies. The functional interaction between ERp57 and calnexin or calreticulin demonstrates that N-glycosylation does not only contribute to quality control but also to accelerating productive folding. This study also suggests that other overlooked or difficult to detect interactions may add functionality to the other members of the PDI family. The speculative ER matrix formed by a loose association of resident ER proteins (32Tatu U. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) may be a network that creates powerful synergies between the various chaperone systems of the quality control machinery and the enzymes that accelerate folding.

(1995) Free Radical Biol. & Med. 18, 421–429). Here we demonstrate that this reducing activity extended to hydroperoxides of phosphatidylcholine, was similar in HDL2 and HDL3, was independent of arylesterase and lecithin:cholesteryl acyltransferase activity, was unaffected by sulfhydryl reagents, and was expressed by reconstituted particles containing apoAI or apoAII only, as well as isolated human apoAI. Concomitant with the reduction of lipid hydroperoxides specific oxidized forms of apoAI and apoAII formed in blood-derived and reconstituted HDL. Similarly, specific oxidized forms of apoAI accumulated upon treatment of isolated apoAI with authentic cholesteryl linoleate hydroperoxide. These specific oxidized forms of apoAI and apoAII have been shown previously to contain Met sulfoxide (Met(O)) at Met residues and are also formed when HDL is exposed to Cu2+ or soybean lipoxygenase. Lipid hydroperoxide reduction and the associated formation of specific oxidized forms of apoAI and apoAII were inhibited by solubilizing HDL with SDS or by pretreatment of HDL with chloramine T. The inhibitory effect of chloramine T was dose-dependent and accompanied by the conversion of specific Met residues of apoAI and apoAII into Met(O). Canine HDL, which contains apoAI as the predominant apolipoprotein and which lacks the oxidation-sensitive Met residues Met112 and Met148, showed much weaker lipid hydroperoxide reducing activity and lower extents of formation of oxidized forms of apoAI than human HDL. We conclude that the oxidation of specific Met residues of apoAI and apoAII to Met(O) plays a significant role in the 2-electron reduction of hydroperoxides of cholesteryl esters and phosphatidylcholine associated with human HDL. Human high density lipoproteins (HDL) can reduce cholesteryl ester hydroperoxides to the corresponding hydroxides (Sattler W., Christison J. K., and Stocker, R.

Willett W.C. Hennekens C.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 325: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). This is generally thought to be due to the participation of HDL in removal of cholesterol from peripheral tissues and its ensuing transport to the liver for excretion (3Pieters M.N. Schouten D. Van Berkel T.J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1225: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). HDL has other potential anti-atherogenic properties, such as its ability to inhibit the oxidation of low density lipoproteins (LDL) (4Parthasarathy S. Barnett J. Fong L.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) and the pro-atherogenic activities of oxidized LDL (5Navab M. Imes S.S. Hama S.Y. Hough G.P. Ross L.A. Bork R.W. Valente A.J.

Fogelman A.M. Navab M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2882-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). LDL oxidation appears to be a key event in atherogenesis (see e.g. Ref. 7Berliner J.A. Heinecke J.W. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1996; 20: 707-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar), and oxidized lipids, particularly those of cholesteryl esters, are present in human atherosclerotic lesions (8Suarna C. Dean R.T. May J. Stocker R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1616-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). HDL, but less so LDL, can reduce cholesteryl ester hydroperoxides (CE-OOH) to the corresponding cholesteryl ester hydroxides (CE-OH) (9Sattler W. Christison J.K. Stocker R. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1995; 18: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We have proposed (9Sattler W. Christison J.K. Stocker R. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1995; 18: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 10Christison J.K. Karjalainen A. Brauman J. Bygrave F. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 739-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) that this reducing activity of HDL is potentially anti-atherogenic based on the following: (i) by reducing CE-OOH to CE-OH, HDL converts potentially reactive species to relatively inert species, less likely to give rise to further radicals and hence secondary radical reactions (9Sattler W. Christison J.K. Stocker R. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1995; 18: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); (ii) HDL also reduces CE-OOH transferred from oxidized LDL via cholesteryl ester transfer protein (11Christison J. Rye K.-A. Stocker R. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2017-2026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thus can potentially detoxify pro-atherogenic oxidized LDL; (iii) the reduction of HDL CE-OOH occurs in and is selectively accelerated by rat liver perfusate (10Christison J.K. Karjalainen A. Brauman J. Bygrave F. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 739-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar); (iv) HDL CE-O(O)H are rapidly and selectively removed by Hep G2 cells in culture (12Sattler W. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and in situ perfused rat liver (10Christison J.K. Karjalainen A. Brauman J. Bygrave F. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 739-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar); and (v) in rats, HDL CE-OH are rapidly cleared from the circulation by the liver and secreted into bile (13Fluiter K. Vietsch H. Biessen E.A. Kostner G.M. van Berkel T.J.C. Sattler W. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), indicating a physiologically plausible (3Pieters M.N. Schouten D. Van Berkel T.J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1225: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) detoxification and exit route for oxidized lipids associated with HDL. The underlying mechanism(s) for HDL's CE-OOH reducing activity has not been elucidated. Here we report evidence for lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) being reduced by specific Met residues of apoAI and apoAII in HDL. Chloramine T, phenylacetate, 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB), and p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid (PCMPS) were purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals, solvents, and materials were obtained from the sources indicated in the accompanying paper (14Garner B. Witting P.K. Waldeck A.R. Christison J.K. Raftery M. Stocker R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6080-6087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Human and canine HDL and human HDL2 and HDL3 were isolated rapidly from freshly obtained EDTA plasma by the 4-h two-step density gradient ultracentrifugation using a TL100.4 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) described previously (15Sattler W. Mohr D. Stocker R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). This method produces two major HDL bands that have been shown previously to correspond to the HDL2 and HDL3 subfractions (15Sattler W. Mohr D. Stocker R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In experiments where total human HDL was used both subfractions were collected and pooled. This rapid isolation method results in minimal oxidative damage to HDL during isolation (14Garner B. Witting P.K. Waldeck A.R. Christison J.K. Raftery M. Stocker R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6080-6087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 15Sattler W. Mohr D. Stocker R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). After isolation, HDL was gel-filtered, supplemented with 1 mm EDTA, and kept on ice under argon overnight before use (14Garner B. Witting P.K. Waldeck A.R. Christison J.K. Raftery M. Stocker R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6080-6087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Where HDL paraoxonase/arylesterase (EC 3.1.8.1) activity was studied, HDL was isolated from heparinized human plasma into 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, and not exposed to either phosphate buffer or EDTA unless specifically indicated. HDL protein concentrations were estimated and apoAI isolated as described (14Garner B. Witting P.K. Waldeck A.R. Christison J.K. Raftery M. Stocker R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6080-6087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Spheroidal reconstituted HDL containing apoAI only (3 molecules of apoAI/particle, rHDLAI) or apoAII only (6 molecules of apoAII dimer/particle, rHDLAII) were generated by incubating discoidal rHDL prepared by cholate dialysis, with purified lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) and LDL (16Rye K.A. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10298-10303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As judged by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis, the rHDLAI and rHDLAII each comprised a single, homogeneous population of particles. The molar ratio of phospholipids/cholesteryl esters/unesterified cholesterol/protein of the particles were 32.4:18.9:5.0:1 for rHDLAI and 32.6:19.1:5.1:2 for rHDLAII. All compositional analyses were performed on a Cobas Fara autoanalyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland). The stoichiometry varied by <5% for all components in two independent preparations of each rHDL. The majority of the cholesteryl esters was cholesteryl palmitate and cholesteryl oleate; however, cholesteryl linoleate was also present at ≈0.65 mol/mol unesterified cholesterol, presumably derived from LDL during the conversion of the discoidal rHDL to spheroidal rHDLAI(16Rye K.A. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10298-10303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated HDL (1.5–2.0 mg of protein/ml) was oxidized in PBS containing 1 mm EDTA by aerobic incubation for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence of AAPH (4–7.5 mm), a generator of aqueous peroxyl radicals. After oxidation, AAPH was removed by gel filtration and HDL supplemented with 1 mm EDTA, unless specified otherwise. To selectively oxidize Met residues (17von Eckardstein A. Walter M. Holz H. Benninghoven A. Assmann G. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 1465-1476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), HDL (∼1.5 mg of protein/ml) was incubated for 1 h at 22 °C in PBS, 1 mm EDTA and in the presence of chloramine T (50–500 μm). Unreacted chloramine T was removed subsequently by gel filtration and HDL was then either analyzed immediately or oxidized with AAPH as above, the radical generator removed and CE-OOH reducing activity assessed by incubation at 37 °C in the presence of 1 mmEDTA under argon and in the dark. In other experiments HDL was pretreated with H2O2 (1- 200 mm) or HOCl (50 μm) instead of chloramine T. HDL (∼1.5 mg of protein/ml) was also incubated for 4 h at 22 °C in PBS (1 mm EDTA) with 2 mm DTNB or 2 mm PCMPS to derivatize thiols associated with the lipoprotein. Since apoAI does not contain Cys and the sole Cys residue of apoAII forms a disulfide giving rise to the apoAII homodimer, the major targets for these reagents were most likely to be the quantitatively minor HDL apolipoproteins and HDL-associated proteins, notably LCAT. Loss of endogenous fluorescence of Trp residues was determined in SDS-solubilized HDL or different apoAI forms after HPLC separation (14Garner B. Witting P.K. Waldeck A.R. Christison J.K. Raftery M. Stocker R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6080-6087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Analysis of HDL's unoxidized lipids, CE-OOH, CE-OH, and phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxides (PC-OOH), was by HPLC as described (14Garner B. Witting P.K. Waldeck A.R. Christison J.K. Raftery M. Stocker R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6080-6087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). For determination of PC-OOH plus phosphatidylcholine hydroxides (PC-O(O)H), HPLC with UV234 nm instead of chemiluminescence detection was used. Unoxidized apoAI and apoAII and their oxidized forms were determined by HPLC as described (14Garner B. Witting P.K. Waldeck A.R. Christison J.K. Raftery M. Stocker R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6080-6087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). HDL (20–40 μg of protein), isolated in the absence of EDTA, was added to 950 μl of 25 mm Tris/HCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm phenylacetate, and the increase in absorbance at 270 nm was recorded for at least 60 s (6Watson A.D. Berliner J.A. Hama S.Y. La Du B.N. Faull K.F. Fogelman A.M. Navab M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2882-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 18Gan K.N. Smolen A. Eckerson H.W. La Du B.N. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1991; 19: 100-106PubMed Google Scholar). Arylesterase activity was calculated using the molar extinction coefficient of 1,310m−1 cm−1 and defined as 1 μmol of phenylacetate hydrolyzed per min, with the specific activity given as units/mg HDL protein. Arylesterase activity was inhibited by pretreating HDL with 3 mm EDTA for 90 min at 37 °C under argon (6Watson A.D. Berliner J.A. Hama S.Y. La Du B.N. Faull K.F. Fogelman A.M. Navab M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2882-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). EDTA was then removed by gel filtration, the HDL oxidized, and CE-OOH and PC-OOH reduction assessed as described above but in 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mmCaCl2. Reducing activity and arylesterase activity were assessed in parallel with HDL or “chelated HDL” in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EDTA, respectively. Esterase activity was determined before and after AAPH-induced oxidation of HDL and at the end of the time course experiments where CE-OOH and PC-OOH reduction was also assessed. HDL (1.2 mg of protein in 200 μl), in the absence and presence of 1% SDS, was subjected to size exclusion chromatography using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) fitted with a Superose-12 (Pharmacia) column (30 × 1.5 cm inner diameter) eluted with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8; 4 °C) at 0.25 ml/min and 279 nm. By using radiolabeled CE-OOH, we have demonstrated previously that HDL (much more effectively than LDL) reduces this class of LOOH in a stoichiometric fashion to CE-OH (9Sattler W. Christison J.K. Stocker R. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1995; 18: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We sought here to confirm this and in addition to determine whether PC-OOH was also reduced by HDL incubated at 37 °C. For this, we first mildly oxidized HDL using AAPH and assessed reduction of CE-OOH and PC-OOH subsequent to removal of AAPH (see “Experimental Procedures”). In agreement with previous results (9Sattler W. Christison J.K. Stocker R. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1995; 18: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the proportion of total oxidized cholesteryl esters present as CE-OH increased as time progressed (Fig. 1 A), and there was a near stoichiometric conversion of CE-OOH to CE-OH (Fig. 1 A, inset). Fig. 1 B shows, for the first time, that the proportion of total oxidized phosphatidylcholine present as phosphatidylcholine hydroxides (PC-OH) also increased as time progressed. By contrast, the levels of PC-OOH decreased rapidly and those of PC-OOH plus PC-OH (i.e. PC-O(O)H) remained unaltered (Fig. 1 B, inset), indicating that PC-OOH was reduced to PC-OH. The addition of 1% (w/v) SDS to HDL inhibited both CE-OOH and PC-OOH reduction (Fig. 1). The presence of SDS disrupted the structural integrity of HDL. Thus, in the absence of SDS, a single major peak, corresponding to native HDL particles, eluted from the gel filtration column, whereas in the presence of 1% SDS, a series of broad and ill-defined peaks were observed (Fig. 2). This suggests that an intact HDL particle was required in order for both CE-OOH and PC-OOH reduction to occur efficiently. Studies performed using HDL2 and HDL3 subfractions showed that the CE-OOH reducing activity of both subfractions was similar to that of HDL (Fig. 3).Figure 3HDL CE-OOH reducing activity is similar in HDL2 and HDL3. HDL2 and HDL3 were pre-oxidized with 4 mm AAPH for 2 h at 37 °C, the AAPH removed, and the subsequent reduction of CE-OOH determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The increase in the proportion of CE-OH of CE-OOH plus CE-OH (CE-O(O)H) in HDL2 (•) and HDL3 (○) is shown. Data are means ± S.E. of three experiments each using HDL from different donors.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To understand the mechanism(s) by which HDL reduces CE-OOH and PC-OOH, we first investigated a possible contribution of HDL-associated paraoxonase/arylesterase (EC 3.1.8.1). This enzyme hydrolyzes aryl esters of carboxylic acids and organophosphates (18Gan K.N. Smolen A. Eckerson H.W. La Du B.N. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1991; 19: 100-106PubMed Google Scholar) and oxidized (but not native) fatty acyl chains of phospholipids (6Watson A.D. Berliner J.A. Hama S.Y. La Du B.N. Faull K.F. Fogelman A.M. Navab M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2882-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar), requires Ca2+ for its activity, and is inhibited effectively by EDTA (19Chung-Liang K. La Du B.N. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1995; 23: 935-944PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore treated isolated HDL with EDTA (referred to as chelated HDL) and determined its impact on CE-OOH and PC-OOH reducing and arylesterase activities. Chelated HDL was almost totally devoid of arylesterase activity (Fig. 4 A), yet maintained its CE-OOH or PC-OOH reducing activity (Fig. 4, B and C). Arylesterase activity in freshly isolated HDL was 5.2 ± 1.7 units/mg (mean ± S.D., n = 3) and decreased to 45 ± 12% of that (mean ± SD, n = 3) after AAPH-induced oxidation and a further 19 h incubation at 37 °C, demonstrating that although the absolute activity was lower, arylesterase remained active throughout the entire time course studied. In separate experiments, HDL was incubated with 2 mm DTNB to inhibit the activity of HDL-associated LCAT. DTNB oxidizes Cys residues which are thought to be critical for enzyme activity (20Stokke K.T. Norum K.R. Scand. J. Clin. Invest. 1971; 27: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), and others have shown that 0.2–1.5 mm DTNB inhibits LCAT activity (see e.g. Ref. 21Francone O.L. Gurakar A. Fielding C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7066-7072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, treatment of HDL with 2 mm DTNB had no discernible effect on subsequent CE-OOH reducing activity (Fig. 5). Similarly, PCMPS, another LCAT inhibitor, also failed to affect CE-OOH reducing activity (Fig. 5). Thus, neither arylesterase nor LCAT activities play a role in the CE-OOH or PC-OOH reducing activity of HDL. To prove unambiguously that HDL's apolipoproteins rather than associated enzymes/proteins support the observed reducing activity, we tested CE-OOH reduction by rHDLAI and rHDLAII. The purity of the protein composition of these rHDL was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with silver staining (data not shown) and by reversed phase HPLC. rHDLAI contained only apoAI, whereas rHDLAII contained apoAII with traces (<5%) of apoAI, and both particles clearly reduced CE-OOH to CE-OH, with rHDLAII being somewhat more efficient than rHDLAI (Fig. 6). These results imply that apoAI and apoAII are responsible for the LOOH reducing activity associated with native human HDL. Since apoAI does not contain Cys and apoAII does not contain Trp, these results also demonstrate that Cys and Trp are not essential for CE-OOH reduction. Cys is thought to be present almost exclusively as a disulfide in apoAII, giving rise to the homodimeric structure of human apoAII (22Lux S.E. John K.M. Ronan R. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7519-7527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous reports have documented the sensitivity of certain Met residues of apoAI and apoAII to oxidation (14Garner B.

Based on this evidence, we speculated that Met oxidation in apoAI and apoAII might be responsible for the reduction of LOOH. To investigate this possibility, pre-oxidized HDL was incubated at 37 °C under argon (i.e. conditions that support CE-OOH and PC-OOH reducing activity) and the formation of oxidized forms of both apoAI and apoAII followed by HPLC (see “Experimental Procedures”). A representative chromatogram of apolipoproteins in native HDL is given in Fig. 7 A. As shown previously (14Garner B. Witting P.K. Waldeck A.R. Christison J.K. Raftery M. Stocker R. J. Biol.

ApoAIIa contains a single Met(O) in place of one of the two Met26 residues of apoAII dimer (23Anantharamaiah G.M. Hughes T.A. Iqbal M. Gawish A. Neame P.J. Medley M.F. Segrest J.P. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 309-318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas apoAI+16 and apoAI+32 contain one and two Met(O) residues per apoAI monomer, respectively (14Garner B. Witting P.K.

Benninghoven A. Assmann G. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 1465-1476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chromatogram shown in Fig. 7 B is derived from pre-oxidized HDL and is representative of changes occurring to apoAI and apoAII when the intact lipoprotein is exposed AAPH for restricted periods (14Garner B. Witting P.K. Waldeck A.R. Christison J.K. Raftery M. Stocker R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6080-6087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The observed specific formation of apoAI+16, apoAI+32, and apoAIIa during exposure of HDL to AAPH is not due to direct oxidation of the apolipoproteins by AAPH-derived radicals (14Garner B. Witting P.K. Waldeck A.R. Christison J.K. Raftery M. Stocker R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6080-6087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Incubation of such pre-oxidized HDL subsequent to the removal of all AAPH resulted in a further time-dependent decrease in unoxidized apoAI and apoAII and a concomitant increase in the formation of apoAI+16, apoAI+32, and apoAIIa (Fig. 7, B–D). Inclusion of 1% (w/v) SDS significantly inhibited the formation of oxidized forms of apoAI and apoAII (Fig. 8), to an extent comparable with the inhibition of LOOH reduction (cf. Fig. 1). We next confirmed that formation of the oxidized forms of apoAI and apoAII occurred concomitantly with HDL LOOH reduction in both rHDLAI and rHDLAII. As shown in Fig. 9, the rate of apoAII oxidation was greater than that of apoAI in the corresponding rHDL. This result is in agreement with the faster rate of CE-OOH reduction observed with rHDLAII versus rHDLAI (Fig. 6). Similar to the situation with intact HDL, reduction of LOOH by rHDLAI and rHDLAII resulted in a time-dependent decrease in unoxidized apoAI and apoAII and a concomitant increase in (apoAI+16 and apoAI+32) and apoAIIa, respectively (not shown). Together, these results demonstrate that the reduction of LOOH in HDL is related to the formation of oxidized forms of apoAI and apoAII, characterized by the conversion of Met residues to Met(O). In the absence of sulfhydryl groups, chloramine T selectively oxidizes Met residues (24Shechter Y. Burstein Y. Patchornik A. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4497-4503Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), including Met112and Met148 in apoAI of intact HDL (17von Eckardstein A. Walter M. Holz H. Benninghoven A. Assmann G. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 1465-1476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the role of apoAI and apoAII Met residues in CE-OOH reduction, we pretreated HDL with chloramine T before pre-oxidation with AAPH and subsequent assessment of CE-OOH reducing activity. As expected, treatment of HDL with increasing concentrations of chloramine T caused an increased proportion of the Met(O)-containing oxidized forms of apoAI and apoAII (Fig. 10 A), reminiscent of the situation with AAPH-oxidized HDL incubated at 37 °C after removal of the radical generator. There was no discernible decrease in the Trp fluorescence in the chloramine-T-oxidized samples, as indicated by unaltered ratios of UV214 nm absorbance to Trp fluorescence in the unoxidized and oxidized forms of apoAI after HPLC separation (see “Experimental Procedures”). In addition, Trp fluorescence in intact HDL directly after treatment with 50, 100, and 500 μm chloramine T was 92 ± 9, 94 ± 4, and 90 ± 5% (mean ± S.D., n = 4) of the nontreated, native HDL, respectively. This indicated that Trp residues in apoAI were not appreciably oxidized upon treatment of HDL with chloramine T. Furthermore, such treatment did not result in severe lipid damage. Thus, even at the highest chloramine-T concentration used, the levels of cholesteryl linoleate and α-tocopherol were ≈95 and ≈75% of control values. Importantly, there was a dose-dependent decrease in both the levels of CE-OH formed during the 2-h pre-oxidation period and the CE-OOH reducing activity when HDL was treated with increasing concentrations of chloramine T (Fig. 10 B). This effect was already evident at the zero time point as illustrated by the lower degree of CE-OH detected at the higher chloramine-T concentrations used (Fig. 10 B). Pretreatment of HDL with the Met-oxidizing species H2O2 (1–200 mm) or HOCl (50 μm) similarly inhibited HDL CE-OOH reducing activity (data not shown). Together, these data show that prior selective oxidation of Met residues of HDL's apoAI and apoAII results in a dose-dependent inhibition of subsequent LOOH reducing activity. If Met residues of apoAI and apoAII were important for the CE-OOH reducing activi"

We previously established KB cell lines that were stably integrated with various MDR1 promoter deletion constructs fused to the CAT reporter gene (6Uchiumi T. Kohno K. Tanimura H. Matsuo K. Sato S. Uchida Y. Kuwano M. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 147-157PubMed Google Scholar). Of these cell lines, we used four cell lines, Kst-6, Kac-7, Kxh-28, and Khp-2, into which pMDRCAT1, pMDRCAT5, pMDRCAT7, and pMDRCAT8, respectively, were introduced (TableI). To determine whether YB-1 is directly coupled with genotoxic stress-induced MDR1 gene activation, we introduced the antisense expression constructs, AS 1.1 YB-1 and AS 0.7 YB-1, into the transfected cell lines. We first assessed whether transient transfection of AS 0.7 YB-1 reduced the cellular levels of YB-1 in Kst-6 cells. Fig. 1 Ashows that transient transfection of YB-1 antisense expression constructs resulted in a significant decrease in the cellular level of YB-1 to about 30% of that observed with the vector alone. In contrast, there were similar protein levels of thioredoxin in cells transfected with vector alone and antisense YB-1.Table IStable transfectants of various MDR1 promoter CAT constructsCell linesPlasmidsPromoterY-box elementKst-6pMDRCAT1−1974 ∼ +121+Kac-7pMDRCAT5−258 ∼ +121+Kxh-28pMDRCAT7−136 ∼ +121+Khp-2pMDRCAT8−78 ∼ +121− Open table in a new tab Because Koike et al. (26Koike K. Uchiumi T. Ohga T. Toh S. Wada M. Kohno K. Kuwano M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) demonstrated that nuclear translocation of YB-1 was induced by UV irradiation, we compared nuclear levels of YB-1 protein in cells treated with or without UV irradiation. In comparison with the vector alone, introduction of the antisense plasmid also reduced YB-1 levels in the nucleus by 70–80% (Fig. 1 B). UV irradiation increased the YB-1 level in the nucleus 2–3-fold in control cells, but it was unchanged in cells transfected with the antisense plasmid (Fig. 1 B). A gel mobility assay was used to determine whether the cellular amount of YB-1 correlated with the DNA binding activity of the nuclear fraction (Fig. 2). A gel mobility assay with nuclear extracts indicated that UV irradiation induced the activation of an inverted CCAAT box (Y-box) binding protein in KB cells (6Uchiumi T. Kohno K. Tanimura H. Matsuo K. Sato S. Uchida Y. Kuwano M. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 147-157PubMed Google Scholar). The enhancement of DNA binding activity to the Y-box was abolished when cells were transfected with antisense YB-1 plasmids (Fig. 2). Thus, UV-induced activation of a Y-box DNA binding protein appears to be correlated with the nuclear amount of YB-1 protein. We next examined whether a reduction of YB-1 levels in the nucleus could affect MDR1 promoter activity in response to genotoxic stress. After introduction of vector alone, MDR1 promoter activity in Kst-6 cells was increased about 10-fold by UV irradiation (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, transfection of either AS 0.7 YB-1 or AS 1.1 YB-1 blocked UV-induced activation of MDR1 promoter activity by 50–70% of that observed using vector alone (Fig. 3 A). Transfection of the YB-1 antisense plasmids did not in itself inhibit the basal promoter activity in Kst-6 cells (data not shown). Transient transfection of various amounts of AS 0.7 YB-1 inhibited UV-induced promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 B). To further confirm the direct involvement of YB-1 in the UV-induced activation of the MDR1 promoter, other stable CAT reporter transfectants derived from KB, including Kac-7, Kxh-28, and Khp-2, were used (Table I). Two MDR1 promoter-driven CAT reporter constructs, pMDRCAT5 (−258 ∼ +121) and pMDRCAT7 (−138 ∼ +121), which were stably integrated in Kac-7 and Kxh-28, contain the Y-box element, whereas pMDRCAT8 (−78 ∼ +121) integrated in Khp-2 lacks the Y-box element (Table I). CAT activity was increased 5–10-fold in UV-irradiated Kac-7 and Kxh-28 cells over the untreated control, but no increase of CAT activity was observed in UV-irradiated Khp-2 cells (Fig. 4, A–C), suggesting the necessity of the Y-box element in UV-induced MDR1 promoter activation. Transient transfection of either AS 0.7 YB-1 or AS 1.1 YB-1 blocked the UV-induced activation of MDR1 promoter in Kac-7 and Kxh-28. Additionally, the YB-1 antisense constructs had no inhibitory effect on the CAT activity in untreated Kac-7, Kxh-28, and Khp-2 cells (Fig. 4, A–C), suggesting that basal MDR1 promoter activity does not depend on YB-1 or the presence of the Y-box. Moreover, Koike et al. (26Koike K. Uchiumi T. Ohga T. Toh S. Wada M. Kohno K. Kuwano M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) have shown that UV irradiation itself did not change the cellular level of YB-1, but that UV irradiation enhanced the nuclear translocation of YB-1. Transient transfection of YB-1 antisense expression constructs induced a significant decrease in the cellular level of YB-1, resulting in the nuclear level of YB-1 and the inhibition of the UV-induced CAT activity. Finally, we examined the effects of the YB-1 antisense plasmids on MDR1 promoter activity induced by two cytotoxic anticancer agents, cisplatin and etoposide. Exposure to cisplatin or etoposide induced a dramatic increase in the CAT activity (Fig. 5, A and B). However, introduction of both YB-1 antisense plasmids, AS 1.1 YB-1 and AS 0.7 YB-1, reduced the anticancer agent-dependent activation of MDR1 promoter activity to 20–30% of control levels (Fig. 5, A and B). Therefore, MDR1 promoter activation in response to genotoxic stress induced by UV irradiation or anticancer agents could be attenuated by reducing cellular YB-1 levels. The transcriptional factor YB-1 is involved in transcriptional control of various genes through the inverted CCAAT element (Y-box) in their promoters (20Wolffe A.P. Tafuri S. Ranjan M. Familari M. New Biol. 1992; 4: 290-298PubMed Google Scholar, 21Ladomery M. Sommerville J. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Sundseth et al. (30Sundseth R. Macdonald G. Ting J. King A.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) have reported that NF-Y, but not YB-1, binds to a CCAAT site in human MDR1 promoter using a gel mobility assay. In our present study, however, transient transfection of YB-1 antisense expression constructs reduced the cellular level of YB-1 and the enhancement of DNA binding activity to the Y-box in human MDR1 promoter. Moreover, we found that glutathioneS-transferase-YB-1 fusion protein specifically recognized and bound to the Y-box in the MDR1 promoter (data not shown). We thus favor the notion that UV-induced MDR1 promoter activity is rather specifically activated through the interaction of YB-1 to the Y-box in this promoter. However, it remains unclear whether NF-Y is involved in the UV-induced MDR1 promoter activity in our assay system. YB-1 is mainly located in the cytoplasm of various human cell lines (18Ohga T. Koike K. Ono M. Makino Y. Itagaki Y. Tanimoto M. Kuwano M. Kohno K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4224-4228PubMed Google Scholar), but appears to be activated by genotoxic stress, resulting in its translocation into the nucleus (26Koike K. Uchiumi T. Ohga T. Toh S. Wada M. Kohno K. Kuwano M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In our present study, introduction of YB-1 antisense plasmids decreased the nuclear levels of YB-1 in exponentially growing human KB cells. The decrease in YB-1 levels also abrogated UV-induced activation of the MDR1 promoter. Moreover, decreased levels of YB-1 also resulted in a decrease in the MDR1 promoter activity induced by etoposide and cisplatin (Fig. 5). Based on these findings, nuclear YB-1 expression appears to be closely associated with genotoxic stress induced by MDR1 promoter activation. The nuclear localization of YB-1 is closely correlated with overexpression of the MDR1 gene encoding P-gp in both human breast cancer cells in culture and untreated primary breast tumors (25Bargou R.C. Jurchott K. Wagener C. Bergmann S. Metzner S. Bommert K. Mapara M.Y. Winzer K.-J. Dietel M. Dorken B. Royer H.-D. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). A recent study by Osborn et al. (9Osborn M.T. Chambers T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30950-30955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that MDR1 gene expression is often co-activated with c-Jun NH2-terminal protein kinase in response to genotoxic stress. We have shown previously that a protein kinase inhibitor, H-7, blocks MDR1 promoter activation by UV irradiation (13Uchiumi T. Kohno K. Tanimura H. Hidaka K. Asakuno K. Abe H. Uchida Y. Kuwano M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 14Sato S. Kohno K. Izumi H. Hidaka K. Wada M. Kuwano M. Cell. Pharmacol. 1995; 2: 153-157Google Scholar). Thus, nuclear translocation of YB-1 is also blocked by the protein kinase inhibitor, H-7 (26Koike K. Uchiumi T. Ohga T. Toh S. Wada M. Kohno K. Kuwano M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). c-Jun NH2-terminal protein kinase or other protein kinases might play a key role in the UV and other genotoxic stress-induced activation of MDR1, possibly through translocation of YB-1. The molecular mechanism by which YB-1 is transformed into an active form in the nucleus in response to genotoxic stress and in vivo needs further study. In conclusion, YB-1 appears to have a key role in the cellular response to genotoxic damage as well as modulating MDR1 gene expression. Further study of the regulation of the YB-1 promoter (22Makino Y. Ohga T. Toh S. Koike K. Okumura K. Wada M. Kuwano M. Kohno K.

Cadherins are a family of structurally and functionally related molecules that mediate Ca2+-dependent cell-cell interactions in a homophilic manner (1Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2966) Google Scholar). They are subdivided according to their primary structures into several groups, such as the classical cadherins and the protocadherins (2Kemler R. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 317-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). The classical cadherins, including the E-, P-, and N-cadherins, are highly conserved transmembrane glycoproteins with similar domains for homophilic binding, Ca2+-binding, and interaction with intracellular proteins termed catenins (α-, β-, and γ-catenins) (1Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2966) Google Scholar, 2Kemler R. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 317-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). The function of cadherins depends on their association with the actin cytoskeleton. Deletion or truncation of the cytoplasmic domain of cadherin results in a loss of function despite their continued expression on the cell surface (3Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). The interaction of cadherins with the cytoskeleton is mediated by α-, β-, and γ-catenins (4Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R.

Consistent with the role of the catenins in the linking of cadherins to the cytoskeleton, a loss of the cadherin function has been correlated with alterations in catenins (6Shimoyama Y. Nagafuchi A.

Cells have to regulate the strength of their adhesiveness, and post-translational modifications such as tyrosine phosphorylation may be one mechanism of regulation. In v-src transfected cells, β-catenin in the cadherin·catenin complex is preferentially tyrosine-phosphorylated, and the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin is apparently associated with a dysfunction of cadherin (31Matsuyoshi N. Hamaguchi M. Taniguchi S. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. Takeichi M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 32Behrens J. Vakaet L. Friis R. Winterhager E. Van Roy F.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Treatment of adenocarcinoma cells with growth factors results in the accumulation of phosphorylated tyrosine residues on β- and γ-catenin, concomitant with a loss of cadherin-mediated adhesion (34Shibamoto S. Hayakawa M. Takeuchi K. Hori T. Oku N. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. Takeichi M. Ito F. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 1: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the degree of tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin is a critical parameter controlling cadherin function, possibly by regulating the association of cadherin with the cytoskeleton. In the case of Ras-transformed mammary cells, p120 cas seems to displace β-catenin for cadherin binding upon elevated tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins (35Kinch M.S. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The dissociation of tyrosine-phosphorylated β-catenin from N-cadherin has also been reported (36Balsamo J. Leung T.C. Ernst H. Zanin M.K.B. Hoffman S. Lilien J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 801-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Our knowledge on the dysfunctional state of cadherin induced by the tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin, however, remains fragmentary. In this study, we have examined the consequence of tyrosine phosphorylation of β- and γ-catenin on cadherin function and the composition of the cadherin·catenin complex. We find that the tyrosine phosphorylation of β- and γ-catenin induced by pervanadate treatment of cells does not result in the dissociation of these proteins, instead causing a significant decrease in the amount of α-catenin in the E-cadherin·catenin complex. Sodium orthovanadate, okadaic acid, and cytochalasin D were purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal antibodies against α-, β-, and γ-catenins were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. DECMA-1, a monoclonal antibody to E-cadherin, and monospecific antibodies to α-catenin were described previously (37Vestweber D. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1985; 13: 3393-3398Crossref Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 38Tsutsui J. Moriyama M. Arima N. Ohtsubo H. Tanaka H. Ozawa M. J. Biochem.

Human leukemia K562 cells (kindly provided by Dr. K. Sekiguchi, Research Institute, Osaka Medical Center for Maternal and Child Health) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The E-cadherin cDNA encoding the wild-type or mutant proteins, EΔC37 (5Ozawa M. Ringwald M. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4246-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar) or ED134A (39Ozawa M. Engel J. Kemler R. Cell. 1990; 63: 1033-1038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), was cloned into a mammalian expression vector, pCAGGS neo (40Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene. 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4524) Google Scholar) (a gift from Dr. K. Yamamura, Kumamoto University). For the expression of an E-cadherin-α-catenin chimeric protein, the ClaI-EcoRV fragment of E-cadherin cDNA that encodes the 71 amino acid, including catenin-binding domain of E-cadherin, was replaced with a 2469-base pairEco47III-EcoRV fragment that encodes the carboxyl-terminal two-thirds of α-catenin (amino acids 301–906). K562 cells (5 × 106) were transfected with the expression vectors (10 μg) by electroporation using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser set at 280 V and 960 microfarads. For immunoblot analysis, cells (1 × 105) were boiled for 5 min in Laemmli SDS gel sample buffer, run on 8% polyacrylamide gels, and then electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with monoclonal antibodies and finally peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). After washing with the buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20, the protein bands were visualized with an ECL detection kit (Amersham Corp.). Immunoprecipitation was carried out as described previously (4Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsufonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 25 μg/ml aprotinin. The E-cadherin·catenin complex was collected with either rabbit anti-E-cadherin or α-catenin antibodies, both of which had been preabsorbed to protein A-Sepharose CL4B. The immune complex was washed with the same buffer four times and then boiled in the SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The cell aggregation assay was performed as described previously (5Ozawa M. Ringwald M. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4246-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar) except that the cells were passed through Pasteur pipettes several times to obtain single cells. For the cell dissociation assay, cells (2 × 106) were cultured overnight in 60-mm plastic dishes and then incubated for another 1 h after the addition of reagents dissolved in a minimum volume of an appropriate solvent. A commonly used method devised by Takeichi and co-workers (41Nagafuchi A. Shirayoshi Y. Okazaki K. Yasuda K. Takeichi M. Nature. 1987; 329: 341-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) to examine potential homophilic adhesive properties of surface molecules includes the transfection of mouse L fibroblasts with the cDNA of interest and analysis of the adhesive properties of the transfectants. Although L cells have no endogenous cadherin activity, they exhibit adhesiveness and form aggregates after overnight culture in suspension, suggesting that they have cell-cell adhesion molecules other than cadherin. To determine the conditions that modulate the cadherin activity of the preformed cell-cell contacts, L cells were less suitable because of their cadherin-independent adhesiveness. A human leukemia cell line, K562, was chosen for analysis because it expresses no endogenous cadherin and grows in suspension as non-adhesive single cells. K562 cells transfected with an E-cadherin expression vector and selected for G418 resistance exhibited two different phenotypes. One type grows as aggregates and the other as single cells. On immunofluorescence staining with E-cadherin antibodies, the clones growing as aggregates were found to be positive for E-cadherin expression, whereas those growing as single cells were negative (not shown). The aggregation of K562 cells expressing E-cadherin (EK cells) was inhibited in the presence of the E-cadherin antibody, DECMA-1 (Fig. 1, A and E). The aggregation of EK cells is Ca2+-dependent since no aggregation was observed in the presence of 5 mm EGTA (data not shown). Recently, cadherin-mediated adhesion was postulated to have two states (42Takeda H. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1839-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The aggregates in the weak state are easily dissociated into single cells on passage several times through Pasteur pipettes, whereas the aggregates in the strong state are hardly affected by the same treatment. According to this definition, the state of EK cell aggregates is weak, because they were dissociated into single cells when passed several times through a Pasteur pipette. Absent expression in K562 cells of ZO-1, which binds to α-catenin and actin filaments (43Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Moroi S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar), may explain why EK cells remain in the weak state. The aggregates treated with cytochalasin D (1 μg/ml) to disrupt the actin cytoskeleton did not dissociate into single cells, although the cells became rounded and the aggregates seemed to be more decompacted (data not shown). To confirm that the observed aggregation of K562 cells expressing E-cadherin was dependent on E-cadherin, two additional cell clones expressing mutant forms of E-cadherin were established. ED134AK cells express E-cadherin with an amino acid substitution in the Ca2+-binding motif (ED134A), i.e. with an aspartic acid at residue 134 being replaced by alanine, and therefore exhibit no adhesive activity in L cells (39Ozawa M. Engel J. Kemler R. Cell. 1990; 63: 1033-1038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). EΔC37K cells express another form of mutant E-cadherin with a deletion in the cytoplasmic domain (EΔC37) (5Ozawa M. Ringwald M. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4246-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). This mutant form of E-cadherin cannot associate with catenins because of the deletion and is also nonfunctional when expressed on L cells. As expected, K562 cells expressing either of these mutant E-cadherin proteins showed no aggregation (Fig. 1). Because cadherin expression has been shown to induce the up-regulation of catenins in L fibroblasts (44Nagafuchi A. Ishihara S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 45Kowalczyk A.P. Palka H.L. Luu H.H. Nilles L.A. Anderson J.E. Wheelock M.J. Green K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31214-31223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we assessed the steady-state levels of the α-, β-, and γ-catenin proteins in these different cell lines by immunoblot analysis. Very low levels of α-, β-, and γ-catenin were observed in the parental K562 cells, the control transfectants (NK), and EΔC37K cells (Fig. 2). In contrast, cells expressing E-cadherin with the intact catenin-binding site (EK and ED134AK) showed markedly increased steady-state levels of α-, β-, and γ-catenins (Fig. 2). Cadherin·catenin complex formation was studied by means of co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine, and E-cadherin was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with E-cadherin antibodies. Three proteins migrating to positions corresponding to 102, 88, and 82 kDa were coprecipitated with E-cadherin (120 kDa) in the case of EK cells (Fig. 3). These coprecipitated proteins were identified as α-, β-, and γ-catenin by subjecting the immunoprecipitates to immunoblot analysis with the respective antibodies (data not shown, but see below). The addition of pervanadate (0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate + 1.5 mm H2O2), an inhibitor of phosphotyrosine phosphatases, to EK cell aggregates formed on overnight culture resulted in almost complete dissociation of the aggregates into single cells within 1 h (Fig. 4). Okadaic acid (up to 500 nm), an inhibitor of serine-threonine phosphatase, induced morphological changes, including blebbing of individual cells, in the aggregates, but it had no effect on the aggregates of EK cells (not shown). We examined whether the amounts of the components of the cadherin·catenin complex were changed after pervanadate treatment. Immunoblot analysis showed that there was almost no difference in the amounts of E-cadherin, α-, β-, γ-catenins, or p120 cas between the untreated and treated EK cell aggregates (Fig. 5). A small but reproducible shift was detected in the electrophoretic mobility of β- catenin, γ-catenin, and p120 cas (Fig. 5). We next examined whether pervanadate treatment affected the association of E-cadherin with catenins by immunoblot analysis of immunoprecipitates collected with E-cadherin antibodies. In untreated EK cell aggregates, E-cadherin was associated with α-, β-, and γ-catenin, and no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins was observed after blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 6). After pervanadate treatment, similar amounts of β- and γ-catenin (with modified electrophoretic mobilities of 90 and 84 kDa, respectively) were found associated with E-cadherin. The amount of α-catenin in the complex was, however, significantly decreased to less than one-half that of untreated aggregates (Fig. 6). The anti-phosphotyrosine antibody specifically reacted with three bands, at 120, 90, and 84 kDa, for the treated aggregates. Immunoprecipitation with E-cadherin antibodies under stringent conditions revealed that E-cadherin was tyrosine phosphorylated upon pervanadate treatment (data not shown). A similar analysis of α-catenin collected with α-catenin antibodies revealed that α-catenin was not detectably phosphorylated (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that, upon increased tyrosine phosphorylation of components of the cadherin·catenin complex, α-catenin is released from the complex. Conversely using anti-α-catenin antibodies, we again collected the E-cadherin·catenin complex from untreated and pervanadate-treated cells. In untreated EK cell aggregates, α-catenin antibodies co-precipitated E-cadherin and β- and γ-catenins. In treated aggregates, reduced amounts (less than one-half) of β- and γ-catenin were co-precipitated with α-catenin, and consequently there was a reduced amount of E-cadherin (Fig. 7). The β- and γ-catenin co-precipitated with α-catenin from the untreated and treated aggregates showed small differences in electrophoretic mobility as compared with those associated with E-cadherin. To test our hypothesis that the dissociation of α-catenin from the E-cadherin·catenin complex underlies the dysfunction of E-cadherin, we constructed a cDNA for an E-cadherin-α-catenin chimeric molecule consisting of (a) the entire extracellular and transmembrane domains of E-cadherin as well as the first 80 amino acids of its cytoplasmic domain, excluding the region shown to associate with β- or γ-catenin (5Ozawa M. Ringwald M. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4246-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar), and (b) amino acids 301–906 of α-catenin, which include the domains necessary for association with α-actinin and actin (23Nieset J.E. Redfield A.R. Knudsen K.A. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Rimm D.L. Koslov E.R. Kebriaei P. Cianci C.D. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8813-8817Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), but not the domain essential for association with β- and γ-catenins (22Obama H. Ozawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11017-11020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 23Nieset J.E. Redfield A.R. Knudsen K.A. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 8 A). This chimeric cDNA was transfected into K562 cells. Clones expressing the chimeric protein on their surface (E-αCNK) were confirmed by immunofluorescence staining (data not shown), and by immunoblotting with anti-E-cadherin (Fig. 8B) and anti-α-catenin antibodies (not shown), both reacted with a protein of 170 kDa, the expected molecular mass of the chimera. The cells form aggregates (Fig. 8 C) in an E-cadherin-dependent manner in that the aggregation was inhibited by the E-cadherin antibody (data not shown). In contrast to EK cell aggregates, the preformed aggregates were not dissociated upon treatment with pervanadate (Fig. 8 D). The functions of cadherins are regulated from the cytoplasmic side, and these regulations are thought to be of great importance in the development of organs and in tumor metastasis. To understand the mechanisms regulating the cadherin function, especially to identify intrinsic factors involved in the inactivation of cadherin, we expressed E-cadherin on K562 leukemia cells. Since the formation of aggregates by the transfected K562 cells was solely mediated by E-cadherin, the system seems to be suitable for the analysis of cellular factors or of changes that lead to inactivation of cadherin. The aggregates dissociate into single cells on the addition of pervanadate. In pervanadate-treated cells, β- and γ-catenins exhibit increased tyrosine phosphorylation and conformational changes, and these changes are correlated with reduced association of α-catenin to the E-cadherin·catenin complex. Since the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of β- and γ-catenins and E-cadherin did not affect their interactions with each other, one of the molecular events resulting in the inactivation of E-cadherin is apparently the dissociation of α-catenin from the complex. Consistent with this idea, the E-cadherin chimeric molecule covalently linked with α-catenin was not inactivated by pervanadate treatment. However, in these cells, numerous proteins exhibit increased tyrosine phosphorylation, and it will be important in the future to determine if any other factors contribute to the inactivation of E-cadherin. With elevated tyrosine phosphorylation, there is a rapid reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and a modulation of intercellular adherens-type junctions in epithelial and endothelial cells (46Volberg T. Zick Y. Dror R. Sabanay I. Gilon C. Levitzki A. Geiger B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1733-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 47Ayalon O. Geiger B. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 547-556PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by cytochalasin D did not, however, affect aggregation. The correlation between the presence of phosphorylated tyrosine residues on β- catenin and the loss of cadherin-mediated adhesion is consistent with reports from other laboratories. The dissociation of α-catenin from the cadherin·catenin complex has not, however, been reported previously. Instead, the displacement of β-catenin in the complex by p120 cas (35Kinch M.S. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), the dissociation of β-catenin from the complex (36Balsamo J. Leung T.C. Ernst H. Zanin M.K.B. Hoffman S. Lilien J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 801-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and no apparent changes in the composition of the complex upon tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin have been reported (31Matsuyoshi N. Hamaguchi M. Taniguchi S. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. Takeichi M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 32Behrens J. Vakaet L. Friis R. Winterhager E. Van Roy F.

Commun. 1994; 1: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Differences in the protein kinases involved in the phosphorylation of these proteins could explain this discrepancy. BCR-ABL oncogene product exhibiting increased tyrosine kinase activity in K562 cells (48Konopka J.B. Watanabe S.M. Witte O.N. Cell. 1984; 37: 1035-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) is a candidate for the kinases responsible for the tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin and γ-catenin in the pervanadate-treated cells. Association with the actin cytoskeleton and possible involvement in the cell adhesion of BCR-ABL protein has been reported (49McWhirter J.R. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1553-1565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies are needed to determine the nature of the protein-tyrosine kinases responsible for the elevated tyrosine phosphorylation of E-cadherin and β- and γ-catenins in pervanadate-treated EK cell aggregates. Besides protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B-like phosphatase, which has been shown to be involved in regulation of N-cadherin function in chicken retina cells (36Balsamo J. Leung T.C. Ernst H. Zanin M.K.B. Hoffman S. Lilien J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 801-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), several other protein tyrosine phosphatases have been shown to interact with E-cadherin or β-catenin, including receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase μ (50Brady-Kalnay S.M. Rimm D.L. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), a member of the leukocyte antigen-related protein-related transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase family (51Kypta R.M. Su H. Reichardt L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1519-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and protein-tyrosine phosphatase κ (52Fuchs M. Müller T. Lerch M.M. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16712-16719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The protein-tyrosine phosphatases involved in keeping the tyrosine phosphorylation of β- and γ-catenins at low levels also should be identified. The mechanism by which the tyrosine phosphorylation of β- and γ-catenins results in the dissociation of α-catenin from these proteins is unknown at present. In the case of tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin induced by epidermal growth factor, the phosphorylated tyrosine residues are located in either the amino- or the carboxyl-terminal domain of the protein (53Hoschuetzky H. Aberle H. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1375-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, the α-catenin-binding site of both β- and γ-catenins has been localized to the amino-terminal domain of these proteins (11Aberie H. Butz S. Stappert J. Weissig H. Kemler R. Hoschuetzky H. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3655-3663PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hülsken J. Birchmeier W. Behrens J. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1520-1526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Analysis by alanine mapping of the α-catenin binding site of the proteins has revealed that hydrophobic amino acids are indispensable for the interaction with α-catenin, suggesting that hydrophobic interactions stabilize the heterodimeric complex (17Aberle H. Schwartz H. Hoschuetzky H. Kemler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1520-1526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The amino acid substitution of the tyrosine residue in the site of β- and γ-catenin with alanine (Y142A and Y133A, respectively) also strongly reduces the ability of these proteins to bind to α-catenin (17Aberle H. Schwartz H. Hoschuetzky H. Kemler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1520-1526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences surrounding this tyrosine residue seem, however, not to conform to the consensus sequence of previously identified tyrosine kinases. An alternative possibility to be considered is that phosphorylation of tyrosine residues not in the α-catenin binding site induces a conformational change, which in turn weakens the interaction with α-catenin or masks the binding site. Upon pervanadate treatment resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation, β- and γ-catenins show a slower electrophoretic mobility, suggesting a phosphorylation-induced conformational change of these proteins. It has been reported that after the treatment of cells with serine-threonine phosphatase inhibitors (okadaic acid and calyculin A), β-catenin was phosphorylated on serine and to a lesser extent on threonine residues, and showed a slower electrophoretic mobility (54Serres M. Grangeasse C. Haftek M. Durocher Y. Duclos B. Schmitt D. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We thank Drs.

However, a basic carboxyl-terminal domain of IGFBP-3, known to be involved in its interaction with the acid-labile subunit, is shared by IGFBP-5, suggesting the possibility of ternary complexes containing IGFBP-5. We now demonstrate using three independent methods that human IGFBP-5, when occupied by IGF-I or IGF-II, forms ternary complexes of approximately 130 kDa with the acid-labile subunit. IGFBP-3 competes with approximately twice the potency of IGFBP-5 for the formation of such complexes. No other IGFBP complexes with the acid-labile subunit itself or competes with IGFBP-5 for complex formation. As observed for IGFBP-3, ternary complexes containing IGFBP-5 form preferentially in the presence of IGF-I, even though IGFBP-5 has a preferential affinity for IGF-II over IGF-I. By size fractionation chromatography, serum IGFBP-5 co-elutes predominantly with ternary complexes. The demonstration of IGFBP-5-containing ternary complexes indicates an unrecognized form of IGF transport in the circulation and an additional mechanism for regulating IGF bioavailability.

Metabolism. 1995; 44: 12-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). They circulate in at least three forms: unbound, in binary complexes with IGF-binding protein (IGFBP) 1 to 6, and in ternary complexes containing an IGFBP and the approximately 85-kDa leucine-rich glycoprotein known as the acid-labile subunit (ALS) (4Zapf J. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 132: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 5Baxter R.C. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 4: 91-96Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The circulating half-lives of IGF-I and IGF-II are reported to be about 10 min in the free form, less than 30 min in binary complexes, and 12–15 h in the ternary complexed form (6Guler H.-P. Zapf J. Schmid C. Froesch E.R. Acta Endocrinol. 1989; 121: 753-758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IGFBP-3 has been extensively documented as being unique among the IGFBPs in its ability to form ternary complexes with the IGFs and ALS (4Zapf J. Eur. J.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1649-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These complexes are thus thought to form a circulating reservoir of IGFBP-3 and IGFs because, unlike free and binary complexed IGFs, they appear unable to undergo transcapillary passage to tissues and have a long circulating half-life, predominantly due to the stabilizing effect of ALS (11Binoux M. Hossenlopp P. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1988; 67: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 12Lewitt M.S. Saunders H. Phuyal J.L. Baxter R.C. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2404-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). An inability of IGFs to form a ternary complex may lead to profound hypoglycemia (13Daughaday W.H. Kapadia M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6778-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).IGFBP-5 has both structural and regulatory similarities to IGFBP-3, raising the possibility that IGFBP-5 might also form ternary complexes with ALS. IGFBP-3 (14Wood W.I. Cachianes G. Henzel W.J. Winslow G.A. Spencer S.A. Hellmiss R. Martin J.L. Baxter R.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 1176-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) and IGFBP-5 (15Shimasaki S. Shimonaka M. Zhang H.P. Ling N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10646-10653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have a common highly basic 18-amino acid sequence in their carboxyl-terminal region that, in the case of IGFBP-3, has been implicated in the interaction with ALS (16Firth S.M. Ganeshprasad U. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2631-2638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5 levels in serum each show a high correlation with serum IGF levels (17Mohan S. Libanati C. Dony C. Lang K. Srinivasan N. Baylink D.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 80: 2638-2645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), contrary to the findings for IGFBP-1, IGFBP-2, IGFBP-4, and IGFBP-6 (18Lee P.K.D. Conover C.A. Powell D.R. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1993; 204: 4-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 19Clemmons D.R. Snyder D.K. Busby Jr., W.H. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Since steady-state serum IGF and IGFBP-3 levels are believed to be dependent on the stabilizing effect of complexes with ALS, we hypothesized that serum IGFBP-5 might also be stabilized by ALS. We now report that IGFBP-5, like IGFBP-3, binds to ALS in the presence of IGFs and is detectable in high molecular weight form in human serum.DISCUSSIONComplexes of IGFBP-5 with ALS and IGF-I or IGF-II have been demonstrated using three independent methods: gel permeation chromatography, immunoprecipitation with ALS antiserum, and affinity labeling. Although the basic carboxyl-terminal domain of IGFBP-3 has been specifically implicated in ALS binding (16Firth S.M. Ganeshprasad U. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2631-2638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), the role of the corresponding domain in IGFBP-5 remains to be definitively demonstrated. This sequence, comprising 18 residues in the carboxyl-terminal region of both IGFBPs (IGFBP-3 [215–232] and IGFBP-5 [201–218]) is highly positively charged, with 10 basic and no acidic residues, and has been postulated to serve as a nuclear localization signal for IGFBP-3 (35Radulescu R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In contrast, IGFBP-1, for example, has only two basic residues, and three acidic residues in the corresponding region, IGFBP-1 [183–200] (36Drop S.L.S. Schuller A.G.P. Lindenbergh-Kortleve D.J. Groffen C. Brinkman A. Zwarthoff E.C. Growth Regul. 1992; 2: 69-79PubMed Google Scholar).Peptides corresponding to this basic domain have been shown to inhibit IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5 binding to endothelial cells (37Booth B.A. Boes M. Andress D.L. Dake B.L. Kiefer M.C. Maack C. Linhardt R.J. Bar K. Caldwell E.E.O. Weiler J. Bar R.S. Growth Regul. 1995; 5: 1-17PubMed Google Scholar), and mutation of IGFBP-3 residues 228–232 (KGRKR) to the corresponding residues of IGFBP-1 (MDGEA) prevents IGFBP-3 cell association (16Firth S.M. Ganeshprasad U. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2631-2638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The same mutation reduces ALS binding to IGFBP-3 by over 90% (16Firth S.M. Ganeshprasad U. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2631-2638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The unique sharing of this basic structural domain involved in ALS binding, between IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5, which are suggested to have evolved from a common gene (38Kou K. James P.L. Clemmons D.R. Copeland N.J. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Rotwein P. Genomics. 1994; 21: 653-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), may account for their shared ability to form ALS complexes and indeed for other shared functions such as cell surface and matrix binding (37Booth B.A. Boes M. Andress D.L. Dake B.L. Kiefer M.C. Maack C. Linhardt R.J. Bar K. Caldwell E.E.O. Weiler J. Bar R.S. Growth Regul. 1995; 5: 1-17PubMed Google Scholar, 39Arai T. Parker A. Busby Jr., W. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20388-20393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of these two proteins.Whereas IGFBP-5 has a higher affinity for IGF-II than IGF-I (40Clemmons D.R. Dehoff M.L. Busby W.H. Bayne M.L. Cascieri M.A. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 890-895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), IGFBP-5 formed an ALS complex more potently with IGF-I than IGF-II. This parallels our previous findings for IGFBP-3 (25Baxter R.C. Martin J.L. Beniac VA. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11843-11848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where C and D domain residues of IGF-I were identified as contributing to the binding affinity for ALS (41Baxter R.C. Bayne M.L. Cascieri M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 60-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further, the presence of either IGF-I or IGF-II was required for detectable IGFBP-5 binding to ALS; that is, IGFBP-5·ALS complexes formed to an unmeasurably low extent. This suggests that formation of a binary complex of IGF-I or IGF-II with IGFBP-5 produces a conformational change in IGFBP-5 and increases its affinity for ALS. We have similarly reported that human IGFBP-3 binding to ALS is unmeasurably weak in the absence of IGFs, although it can be stabilized by covalent cross-linking (25Baxter R.C. Martin J.L. Beniac VA. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11843-11848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Baxter R.C. Martin J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6898-6902Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Other studies using rat proteins or nonglycosylated recombinant human IGFBP-3 have reported somewhat stronger formation of IGFBP-3·ALS complexes in vitro (42Lee C.Y. Rechler M.M. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4982-4989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Barreca A. Ponzani P. Arvigo M. Giordano G. Minuto F. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 80: 1318-1324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We have demonstrated that IGFBP-5 in human serum is present in a predominantly high molecular mass form characteristic of a ternary complex with IGF-I or IGF-II and ALS. In some experiments, IGFBP-5 derived from ternary complexes appeared partially as an ∼18-kDa proteolyzed form comparable to the 30-kDa form of IGFBP-3 that can be detected in 150-kDa complexes when analyzed similarly (44Bang P. Brismar K. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 78: 1119-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Whether this proteolysis occurs in vivo or during the analysis is not fully understood; however, it is clear that even in the case of pregnancy, when all of the immunoreactive IGFBP-3 appears in a 30-kDa form by this analysis, it is still capable of carrying a normal concentration of serum IGFs in ternary complexes (33Suikkari A-M. Baxter R.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1991; 73: 1377-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The significance of limited IGFBP-5 proteolysis in ternary complexes therefore remains to be determined.Our observation that much of the immunoreactive IGFBP-5 in serum co-elutes with immunoreactive ALS challenges the previous report that described serum IGFBP-5 only in fractions corresponding to the molecular mass of binary complexed IGFBP-5 or smaller (17Mohan S. Libanati C. Dony C. Lang K. Srinivasan N. Baylink D.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 80: 2638-2645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The possibility that IGFBP-3 was inadvertently detected in the present study is highly unlikely since the antiserum used was found to detect rhIGFBP-5 sensitively while showing no measurable cross-reactivity with IGFBP-3. In seeking an explanation for the discrepancy between the two results, the calibration of the Superose 6 column used in the earlier study may be called into question. This is suggested by the fact that Superose 6 has a fractionation range stated by the manufacturer to be 5–5000 kDa and an exclusion limit of 40,000 kDa. The elution profile described in the Superose 6-fractionated serum (17Mohan S. Libanati C. Dony C. Lang K. Srinivasan N. Baylink D.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 80: 2638-2645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is thus quite consistent with a molecular mass of >100 kDa for IGFBP-5 in the first elution peak. In the study we describe with the Sephadex G-100 column, the immunoreactive IGFBP-5 in human serum eluted in fractions with similar mobility to bovine gamma globulin and was found repeatedly to co-elute with immunoreactive ALS. Furthermore, that IGFBP-5 circulates in ternary complexes to a significant extent is consistent with the demonstration of in vitro IGFBP-5 ternary complex formation, and competition between IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5 for ALS would not be expected in human serum in vivo due to the excess ALS concentration in serum relative to IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5.Whatever the explanation for the previously published results, ourin vitro evidence of ternary complex formation by IGFBP-5 (under conditions similar to the formation of IGFBP-3 ternary complexes), combined with the size distribution of endogenous serum IGFBP-5 corresponding to high molecular mass forms, together support the view that ternary complex formation by IGFBP-5 is a natural and physiologically significant phenomenon. Other less direct evidence for the existence of endogenous IGFBP-5 ternary complexes in serum is consistent with this finding. The highly significant association between IGFBP-3 and IGF concentrations seen in the human circulation under a variety of conditions is believed to be due predominantly to the stabilization of IGFBP-3 when occupied by IGF-I or -II in complexes with ALS (4Zapf J. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 132: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 5Baxter R.C. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 4: 91-96Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). A similar strong correlation between serum IGFBP-5 levels and IGF-I and -II has recently been reported (17Mohan S. Libanati C. Dony C. Lang K. Srinivasan N. Baylink D.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 80: 2638-2645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5 levels show a parallel age-dependence (45Mohan S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 3817-3820Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), suggesting a commonality in their regulatory processes that would best be explained if IGFBP-5 is also complexed to a significant extent with ALS. Moreover, growth hormone (GH) therapy causes parallel increases in both IGF and IGFBP-5 levels in GH-deficient subjects (46Ono T. Kanzaki S. Yoshiki S. Baylink D.J. Mohan S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 2111-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), just as it also increases IGFBP-3 levels. An IGFBP-5 ternary complex in serum would be expected to be GH-dependent, as its existence and stability would depend on the GH-dependent protein ALS (27Baxter R.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1990; 70: 1347-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In contrast, in a variety of studies, IGFBP-1, -2, -4, and -6 either have no association or an inverse relationship with GH and IGF levels (18Lee P.K.D. Conover C.A. Powell D.R. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1993; 204: 4-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 19Clemmons D.R. Snyder D.K. Busby Jr., W.H. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1991; 73: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 20Honda Y. Landale E.C. Strong D.D. Baylink D.J. Mohan S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 1389-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 21Baxter R.C. Saunders H. J. Endocrinol. 1992; 134: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). IGFBP-5 in ternary complexed form in serum may not have been detected until now due to limited availability of sensitive immunoassay methods, and the presumably smaller amount of ternary-complexed IGFBP-5 relative to IGFBP-3 complexes.Circulating IGFBP-5 ternary complexes might serve to deliver IGFs to tissues in association with IGFBP-5. This could occur through the dissociation of ALS from the complexes, perhaps mediated by interaction with glycosaminoglycans (47Baxter R.C. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 773-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); alternatively, there may be mechanisms such as limited proteolysis that increase the dissociation of IGFs from the complex while still in the vascular compartment. The possibility of IGFs complexed either to IGFBP-3 or IGFBP-5 reaching the tissues from the circulation raises the question whether these binary complexes would have different and possibly competing actions on cells. IGFBP-5 in a binary complex has been shown to act as a local extracellular IGF reservoir through binding to extracellular matrix and to potentiate IGF access to cells by binding to cell surfaces (48Jones J.I. Gockerman A. Busby Jr., W.H. Camacho-Hubner C. Clemmons D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 49Andress D.L. Birnbaum R.S. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1996; 271: E1029-E1035PubMed Google Scholar). In bone, IGFBP-5 binary complex is the major extracellular reservoir of IGFs and has been speculated to be partially serum-derived (51Nicolas V. Mohan S. Honda Y. Prewett A. Finkelman R.D. Baylink D.J. Farley J.R. Calcif. Tissue. Int. 1995; 57: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). IGFBP-3, in contrast, is inhibitory to IGF action in the majority of situations, although stimulatory effects are also well documented (52Blum W.F. Jenne E.W. Reppin F. Kietzmann K. Ranke M.B. Bierich J.R. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 53Conover C.A. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3191-3199Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). IGFBP-3 in general has an antiproliferative action in fibroblasts, breast cancer cells, and other cell types (54Goldstein S. Moerman E.J. Baxter R.C. J. Cell Physiol. 1993; 156: 294-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 55Huynh H. Yang X. Pollak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1016-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and also induces apoptosis (56Rajah R. Valentinis B. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12181-12188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Although some of these effects occur independently of IGF receptors, they are not necessarily IGF-independent, since IGF-I acts in a receptor-independent manner to inhibit IGFBP-3 binding to cell surfaces (57Conover C.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1354-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Serum-derived IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5 complexes might be differentially targeted to various tissues or may compete at the same tissue sites.Although ALS is predominantly found in serum, IGFBP-3 in skin interstitial fluid is found in 150-kDa complexes, implying the presence of ALS (58Xu S. Cwyfan-Hughes C. van der Stappen J.W.J. Sanson J. Burton J.L. Donnelly M. Holly J.M.P. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 80: 2940-2945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and both synovial fluid (59Khosravi M.J. Diamandi A. Mistry J. Krishna R.G. Khare A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 3944-3951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and ovarian follicular fluid 2R. C. Baxter, unpublished data. contain high levels of immunoreactive ALS. Furthermore, ALS messenger RNA has been identified in at least two other non-hepatic tissue types: bone and renal cortex (60Chin E. Zhou J. Dai J. Baxter R.C. Bondy C.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2398-2405Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar), both tissues that contain abundant IGFBP-5 (15Shimasaki S. Shimonaka M. Zhang H.P. Ling N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10646-10653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 61Conover C. Kiefer M.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 76: 1153-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It may therefore be speculated that, in addition to its role in the circulation, ALS functions at a tissue level by interacting with binary complexes containing either IGFBP-3 or IGFBP-5. Tissue IGFBP-5 ternary complexes containing ALS of non-hepatic origin might provide a local stable reservoir of IGFs and IGFBP-5, possibly involved in regulating local IGF actions. If ALS binds to a cell-association domain of IGFBP-5 as it does to IGFBP-3, locally produced ALS might block actions of these proteins that require interaction with cell surfaces.In summary, we have made the novel observations that IGFBP-5, like IGFBP-3, is able to form heterotrimers by combining with IGF-I or -II and ALS, and that endogenous human serum IGFBP-5 is largely detectable in high molecular mass complexed forms. The demonstration of IGFBP-5-containing ternary complexes will demand a re-evaluation of current views on IGF transport in the circulation, release to the tissues, and regulation at the cellular level.

Metabolism. 1995; 44: 12-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). They circulate in at least three forms: unbound, in binary complexes with IGF-binding protein (IGFBP) 1 to 6, and in ternary complexes containing an IGFBP and the approximately 85-kDa leucine-rich glycoprotein known as the acid-labile subunit (ALS) (4Zapf J. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 132: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 5Baxter R.C. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 4: 91-96Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The circulating half-lives of IGF-I and IGF-II are reported to be about 10 min in the free form, less than 30 min in binary complexes, and 12–15 h in the ternary complexed form (6Guler H.-P. Zapf J.

These complexes are thus thought to form a circulating reservoir of IGFBP-3 and IGFs because, unlike free and binary complexed IGFs, they appear unable to undergo transcapillary passage to tissues and have a long circulating half-life, predominantly due to the stabilizing effect of ALS (11Binoux M. Hossenlopp P. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1988; 67: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 12Lewitt M.S. Saunders H. Phuyal J.L. Baxter R.C.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6778-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). IGFBP-5 has both structural and regulatory similarities to IGFBP-3, raising the possibility that IGFBP-5 might also form ternary complexes with ALS. IGFBP-3 (14Wood W.I. Cachianes G. Henzel W.J.

Ganeshprasad U. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2631-2638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5 levels in serum each show a high correlation with serum IGF levels (17Mohan S. Libanati C. Dony C. Lang K. Srinivasan N. Baylink D.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Since steady-state serum IGF and IGFBP-3 levels are believed to be dependent on the stabilizing effect of complexes with ALS, we hypothesized that serum IGFBP-5 might also be stabilized by ALS. We now report that IGFBP-5, like IGFBP-3, binds to ALS in the presence of IGFs and is detectable in high molecular weight form in human serum. DISCUSSIONComplexes of IGFBP-5 with ALS and IGF-I or IGF-II have been demonstrated using three independent methods: gel permeation chromatography, immunoprecipitation with ALS antiserum, and affinity labeling. Although the basic carboxyl-terminal domain of IGFBP-3 has been specifically implicated in ALS binding (16Firth S.M. Ganeshprasad U. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2631-2638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), the role of the corresponding domain in IGFBP-5 remains to be definitively demonstrated. This sequence, comprising 18 residues in the carboxyl-terminal region of both IGFBPs (IGFBP-3 [215–232] and IGFBP-5 [201–218]) is highly positively charged, with 10 basic and no acidic residues, and has been postulated to serve as a nuclear localization signal for IGFBP-3 (35Radulescu R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In contrast, IGFBP-1, for example, has only two basic residues, and three acidic residues in the corresponding region, IGFBP-1 [183–200] (36Drop S.L.S. Schuller A.G.P. Lindenbergh-Kortleve D.J.

Synthetic seismograms were computed from a hybrid method, which handles seismic wave propagation through two-dimensional complex structures. Long-period precursors were explained by Gaussian-shaped ULVZs of 60 to 80 kilometers height with P velocity drops of at least 7 percent over 100 to 300 kilometers. Short-period precursors suggest the presence of smaller scale anomalies accompanying these larger Gaussian-shaped structures.

The predicted PKD1 protein is a large glycoprotein with a signal peptide and multiple transmembrane domains. Its large extracellular region of approximately 2557 amino acids contains multiple protein motifs that are associated with cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, such as leucine-rich repeats, a C-type lectin domain, immunoglobulin-like repeats, and four type III fibronectin-related domains (reviewed in Ref. 6Grantham J.J. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1996; 28: 788-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The short C-terminal cytoplasmic tail consists of a novel domain of 226 amino acids. In normal human adult kidneys, cellular proliferation is a rare and unusual event. The bulk of renal mitogenesis and morphogenesis occurs before birth, with the remainder completed within the first years of life. In early development, PKD1 appears to regulate the proliferation and maturation of tubular epithelial cells. PKD1 is highly expressed in fetal kidney in areas of rapid proliferation and developmental induction, such as the ureteric bud and the condensating mesenchyme (5Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O.

In the present study, we demonstrate that the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of PKD1 triggers the activation of AP-1, a transcription factor that modulates a variety of cellular programs, including growth response and apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 22Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2289) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PKD1-induced AP-1 activity was mediated at least in part through activation of protein kinase C and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Thus, we have shown that PKD1, a protein essential for normal tubulogenesis, activates a signaling cascade involved in cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Genistein (Calbiochem), staurosporine (Calbiochem), calphostin C (Calbiochem), BAPTA-acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes), wortmannin (Calbiochem), and human epidermal growth factor (Clonetics) were used at concentrations as indicated. The C-terminal domain of PKD1 was expressed as a CD16-CD7 fusion protein (CD16.7.PKD1) (15Tsiokas L. Kim E. Arnould T. Sukhatme V.P. Walz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The c-Fos promoter construct (kindly provided by Bender GmBH) and the cAMP-response element promoter construct (kindly provided by K.

The dominant-negative form of PKC δ was generated through site-directed mutagenesis replacing the lysine at 377 with arginine (23Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar). 293T cells seeded in 6-well plates were transiently transfected with a luciferase reporter construct, a β-galactosidase expression vector (kindly provided by C. Cepko), and a vector directing the expression of CD16.7.PKD1. Total DNA amount was 1–2.5 μg/well. Cells were serum starved for 24 h, harvested in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 200 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega) for 15 min at room temperature. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 3 min to remove insoluble material. Luciferase activity was determined using a commercial assay system (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions and normalized for β-galactosidase activity to correct for the transfection efficiency. Pharmacological inhibitors were added for 8 h before the assay. The immune complex kinase assays were carried out after co-transfecting 293T cells with HA-tagged MAP kinases and the CD16.7.PKD1 construct at a 1:1 ratio. Cells from one 10-cm dish were lysed 24 h after transfection in 1 ml of cold lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Boehringer Mannheim). After centrifugation for 15 min at 4 °C, the HA-tagged kinases were immunoprecipitated from the cleared lysate with 5 μg of monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Boehringer Mannheim) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were immobilized by adding 30 μl of Gamma-Bind Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The immune complexes were washed three times in lysis buffer and twice in kinase reaction buffer (25 mmHepes, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mmdithiotreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, pH 7.6). The immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 3 μg of substrates phosphorylated heat- and acid-stable protein-1 (Stratagene) for HA-p38 and HA-p44 or GST-c-Jun (1–79) (Stratagene) for HA-JNK1. The assay was carried out in the presence of 20 μm unlabeled ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 30 °C, stopped by the addition of 30 μl of SDS sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. The reaction mixture was fractionated on a 12% SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated substrates were visualized by autoradiography and quantitated by scanning with a Molecular Dynamics densitometer. JNK immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot, using the anti-HA monoclonal antibody in combination with a goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase antibody (Dako) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). PKC activities were determined using a colorimetric PKC assay with neurogranin as a dye-labeled synthetic peptide substrate (Pierce). Cells were harvested and lysed on ice for 10 min in 45 μl of cold hypotonic buffer (1 mm Hepes, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml pepstatin). Isotonicity was reestablished by adding 5 μl of Hepes (200 mm, pH 7.4) and 25 μl of an equilibrium buffer (20 mm Hepes, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4). The PKC reaction was performed at 30 °C for 30 min using 10 μl of cleared lysates following the instructions of the manufacturer. The absorbance of the phosphorylated substrates was spectrophotometrically determined at 570 nm, and a microprotein assay (Bio-Rad) was used to normalize the PKC activities for the protein content. 293T cells were transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate method. After incubation for 24 h, cells were lysed in sample buffer, fractionated on SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (NEN Life Science Products). Western blot analysis was performed with an anti-CD16 monoclonal antibody followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Dako). Immobilized antibodies were detected by chemiluminescence (Pierce). Results were expressed as means ± S.D. Analysis of variance with a subsequent Scheffe's test was used to determine significant difference in multiple comparisons. Values of p < 0.05 were considered to be significant. Previous studies indicate that ADPKD epithelial cells arrest in a less than terminally differentiated state, leading to cystogenesis. To identify potential signaling pathways of PKD1, we coexpressed the cytoplasmic tail of PKD1 with luciferase reporter constructs transactivated by defined DNA-binding sites. The C-terminal 226 amino acids of PKD1 were fused to the extracellular domain of CD16 and the transmembrane domain of CD7. The combination of CD16 together with a CD7 transmembrane domain has previously been shown to target cytoplasmic domains to the plasma membrane without altering effector function (18Kolanus W.

The expression of CD16.7.PKD1, monitored by Western blot analysis, consistently triggered a 5–10-fold activation of the AP-1 reporter construct containing four AP-1-binding sites (Figs.1, 3, and 5), and a more than 5-fold activation of a collagenase promoter construct containing a single AP-1 site (24Schule R. Rangarajan P. Yang N. Kliewer S. Ransone L. Bolado J. Verma I.M. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6092-6096Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). PKD1-mediated AP-1 activation was highly specific, involving only AP-1 and the Jun2TRE (Fig. 1). Cytoplasmically expressed FLAG-tagged PKD1, lacking both leader sequence and transmembrane domain, completely lost the ability to activate AP-1 (data not shown), suggesting that membrane localization of PKD1 is requisite for AP-1 activation. Likewise, a control protein of the extracellular domain of CD16 fused to the transmembrane domain of CD7 had no effect (Fig. 1). AP-1 activation induced by PKD1 exceeded activation by both epidermal growth factor and serum by 2-fold (data not shown). AP-1 is a transcriptional activator composed of Jun, Fos, or activating transcription factor 2 homodimers and heterodimers that bind to a common DNA sequence, the TRE. AP-1 is activated by a large variety of extracellular stimuli, including growth hormones and cytokines; its activity is controlled both at the transcriptional level and through post-translational modifications of c-Fos and c-Jun (reviewed in Ref.22Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2289) Google Scholar). Several kinase cascades have been demonstrated to regulate AP-1 activity (25Marshall C.J.

Results were compared with the PKC activity of cells stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (1 μm for 60 min) or untransfected cells. Results were expressed as fold increase of the vector control. The number of tests performed is indicated above the bars. Differences were highly significant (***, p < 0.001). B, a dominant-negative PKC α mutant (DNM), but not a dominant-negative PKC βII or δ mutant, blocks the PKD1-mediated AP-1 activation. 293T cells were transiently co-transfected with the C-terminal domain of PKD1 (CD16.7.PKD1) or a vector control (CD16.7) and dominant-negative mutants of PKC α, PKC β, and PKC δ isoenzymes or PKC α wild type (WT) as indicated. Transactivation of AP-1 was determined after 36 h of incubation and expressed as relative light units (RLU) after normalization for β-galactosidase activity. Results are composed of two different experimental sets, each representative of two experiments performed in triplicate. (***, p < 0.001; ###, significantly different from PKD1-transfected cells with p < 0.001; N.S., not significant).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further delineate the signaling pathway through which PKD1 may generate AP-1, we examined the activity of several kinase cascades in 293T cells expressing the C terminus of PKD1. HA-tagged p38, p44, and JNK1 were co-expressed with the C-terminal domain of PKD1 fused to CD16.7 (CD16.7.PKD1) or the control vector (CD16.7). After serum starvation for 16 h, HA-tagged kinases were immunoprecipitated, and the activity of the different kinases was determined using an in vitro kinase assay. Expression of the cytoplasmic domain of PKD1 increased JNK activity, but not that of p38 or p44 (Fig. 2). Activation of JNK was specific for PKD1 and was not detectable in 293T cells expressing full-length PKD2 (data not shown). These results together with our findings that PKD1 triggers the Jun2TRE, but not the c-Fos promoter, suggests that PKD1-induced AP-1 activation may be mediated through the formation of c-Jun and activating transcription factor 2 dimers. JNKs are typically activated by growth factors, cytokines, osmotic stress, or UV light, triggering c-Jun dimerization through phosphorylation at residues Ser-63 and Ser-73 (27Derijard B. Hibi M.

Zamarripa J. Blumberg D. Maue R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 648-656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many of these conditions result in the concomitant activation of p38 and JNK, although selective activation of JNK can occur. MEK kinases, specific mixed lineage kinases, transforming growth factor-β activated kinase, tumor progression locus 2 (Tpl-2), and p21-activated kinases have all been demonstrated to activate the JNK pathway (reviewed in Ref. 29Fanger G.R. Gerwins P. Widmann C. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), whereas selective activation of JNK has been reported through the specific activation of MKK4 by germinal center kinase (30Pombo C.M.

It appears that protein-activated kinases, MEK kinases, mixed lineage kinase 3, and Raf are regulated upstream by low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins (25Marshall C.J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25731-25734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Recently, two members of this family, Rac-1 and Cdc42, have been demonstrated to activate JNK (33Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar). To determine the role of small GTP-binding proteins Rac-1 and Cdc42 in the PKD1-mediated activation of JNK, we co-expressed the C-terminal domain of PKD1 with the dominant-negative mutants Rac-1(N17) and Cdc42(N17) (33Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar). Although wild-type Rac-1 and Cdc42 had no affect on the PKD1-mediated JNK activation (data not shown), both molecules nearly abrogated the PKD1-mediated JNK activation (Fig. 3 A). A comparable inhibition of PKD1-mediated AP-1 activation by Rac-1(N17) and Cdc42(N17) was observed (Fig. 3 B). Thus, Rho family members Rac-1 and Cdc42 appear to play a central role in the signaling pathway triggered by the C terminus of PKD1. To define additional downstream components of PKD1-mediated signaling, we examined the ability of various pharmacological agents to disrupt PKD1-mediated AP-1 activation. Staurosporine, BAPTA, and calphostin C inhibited PKD1-induced AP-1 activation in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 4), whereas genistein and wortmannin had no effect (data not shown). Consistent with the profound effect of staurosporine and calphostin C, PKD1 caused an elevation of total protein kinase C activity; a comparable increase in PKC activity was obtained after stimulation of 293T cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (1 μm) for 60 min (Fig. 5 A). Because PKD1-mediated PKC activation was inhibited by both staurosporine (200 nm) and BAPTA (10 μm), we speculated that PKD1-induced AP-1 activation is mediated by a calcium-dependent PKC isoenzyme. PKC is a family of proteins with at least 13 different members (36Bell R.M. Burns D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4661-4664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but only the conventional PKCs, α, βI, βII, and γ, are regulated by calcium. A dominant-negative form of the calcium-dependent PKC α (37Rosson D. O'Brien T.G. Kampherstein J.A. Szallasi Z. Bogi K. Blumberg P.M. Mullin J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14950-14953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) suppressed PKD1-mediated AP-1 activation, whereas equally well expressed dominant-negative forms of PKC βII and PKC δ had no effect (Fig. 5 B). These findings suggest that PKC α may mediate PKD1 signaling. PKC α has been reported to activate MAP kinase and TRE/AP-1 in other signaling pathways (38Hata A. Akita Y. Suzuki K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9122-9129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Cadwallader K. Beltman J. McCormick F. Cook S. Biochem.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6157-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), perhaps by dephosphorylating c-Jun at one or more of three critical serine/threonine residues that negatively regulate its DNA binding activity (41Boyle W.J. Smeal T. Defize L.H. Angel P. Woodgett J.R. Karin M. Hunter T. Cell. 1991; 64: 573-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). This study demonstrates that the cytoplasmic domain of PKD1 activates AP-1 and JNK and that PKC α, Cdc42, and Rac-1 are critical components of these signaling events. The mediators immediately downstream of PKD1 that engage these proteins are yet to be delineated. Recent reports indicate that the coiled-coil structure in the C-terminal domain of PKD1 serves as a docking site for several proteins including PKD2 (15Tsiokas L. Kim E. Arnould T. Sukhatme V.P. Walz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6965-6970Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar,42Qian F. Germino F.J. Cai Y. Zhang X. Somlo S. Germino G.G. Nat.

J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8 (abstr.): 380Google Scholar). In addition to several potential PKC−/PKA− and tyrosine phosphorylation sites, a putative 14-3-3-binding domain and a putative SH3-binding domain in the C terminus of PKD1 may serve as docking sites for cytoplasmic signaling proteins. Binding of 14-3-3 to the C terminus of PKD1 has recently been demonstrated in the yeast two-hybrid system (45Kim K. Sharma C.P. Arnaout M.A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8 (abstr.): 375Google Scholar); interestingly, 14-3-3 adapter proteins have been shown to activate certain PKC isoenzymes (46Acs P. Szallasi Z. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 47Tanji M. Horwitz R. Rosenfeld G. Waymire J.C. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1908-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Further mapping of the C terminus of PKD1, such as point mutations that destroy the 14-3-3 and SH3-binding domain, could distinguish discrete sites involved in PKD1-mediated AP-1 activation and facilitate the identification of pertinent docking proteins that modulate PKC, GTP-binding proteins, and other effectors. A role of Rho family GTP-binding proteins is to regulate the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and influence cell motility, shape, and adhesion (reviewed in Refs. 48Tapon N. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar and 49Narumiya S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). We postulate that aberrant activation of several small GTP-binding proteins could underlie some of the anomalies evident in ADPKD cysts, such as abnormalities of cell polarity and protein sorting (50Wilson P.D. Sherwood A.C. Palla K. Du J. Watson R. Norman J.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: F420-F430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Wilson P.D. Am. J.

In this model of ADPKD, disregulation of PKD1 function would pathologically affect the activation or recruitment of these small GTP-binding molecules. The role of AP-1 during renal development remains to be elucidated. We hypothesize that a burst of transcriptional activity, mediated in part by PKD1, triggers cellular proliferation and differentiation, followed by a decline in proto-oncogene expression. In cells lacking PKD1, proto-oncogene levels remain pathologically elevated. Indeed, certain genes implicated in cystogenesis in ADPKD contain AP-1-binding sites. These include α1 (I) collagen and several matrix metalloproteinases, genes normally involved in the synthesis and remodeling of the extracellular matrix during normal tubulogenesis (56Borden P. Heller R.A. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expr. 1997; 7: 159-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 57Doyle G.A.R. Pierce R.A. Parks W.C. J. Biol.

Aberrant expression of these gene products may underlie the accumulation of an abnormal extracellular matrix in ADPKD (reviewed in Ref. 61Norman J. Kuo N.T. Gatti L. Orphanides C. Wilson P.D. Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 727-728Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Another potential candidate of AP-1 regulation is hepatic nuclear factor (HNF). HNF-1 and HNF-4 are reduced in both cpk mouse and cy rat models of cystic disease (reviewed in Ref. 62Calvet J.P. Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 715-716Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), indicating a certain minimal requirement for these AP-1-dependent transcription factors during renal development. Lastly, AP-1 has been implicated in the induction of differentiation (63Davis A.F. Meighan-Mantha R.L. Riegel A.T. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 65: 308-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 64Yang D. Tournier C. Wysk M. Lu H.T. Xu J. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2289) Google Scholar); the latter appears to be tightly controlled by Bcl-2 (65Bossy-Wetzel E. Bakiri L. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1695-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, mice lacking Bcl-2 develop cystic disease despite massive apoptosis, perhaps as the result of an inbalance between Bcl-2 and PKD1 activity. Our results suggest that the C-terminal domain of PKD1 triggers cellular functions important for normal renal development. Future experiments will be necessary to analyze the PKD1 motifs and the nature of PKD1-binding adapter proteins involved in this activation."

Characterization of the transmembrane topology of G6Pase should facilitate the identification of amino acid residues contributing to the active site and broaden our understanding of the effects of mutations that cause glycogen storage disease type 1a. Using N- and C-terminal tagged G6Pase, we show that in intact microsomes, the N terminus is resistant to protease digestion, whereas the C terminus is sensitive to such treatment. Our results demonstrate that G6Pase possesses an odd number of transmembrane helices, with its N and C termini facing the endoplasmic reticulum lumen and the cytoplasm, respectively. During catalysis, a phosphoryl-enzyme intermediate is formed, and the phosphoryl acceptor in G6Pase is a His residue. Sequence alignment suggests that mammalian G6Pases, lipid phosphatases, acid phosphatases, and a vanadium-containing chloroperoxidase (whose tertiary structure is known) share a conserved phosphatase motif. Active-site alignment of the vanadium-containing chloroperoxidase and G6Pases predicts that Arg-83, His-119, and His-176 in G6Pase contribute to the active site and that His-176 is the residue that covalently binds the phosphoryl moiety during catalysis. This alignment also predicts that Arg-83, His-119, and His-176 reside on the same side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, which is supported by the recently predicted nine-transmembrane helical model for G6Pase. We have previously shown that Arg-83 is involved in positioning the phosphate during catalysis and that His-119 is essential for G6Pase activity. Here we demonstrate that substitution of His-176 with structurally similar or dissimilar amino acids inactivates the enzyme, suggesting that His-176 could be the phosphoryl acceptor in G6Pase during catalysis.

During catalysis, a phosphoryl moiety is transferred from Glu-6-P to a His residue in G6Pase, forming a phosphoryl-enzyme intermediate (11Nordlie R.C. Lygre D.G. J. Biol.

These studies also show that His-119 is essential for G6Pase activity, suggesting that this His residue could be the phosphoryl acceptor (14Lei K.-J. Shelly L.L. Pan C.-J. Liu J.-L. Chou J.Y. J.

Recently, the tertiary structure of a vanadium-containing chloroperoxidase from the fungus Curvularia inaequalis has been determined (15Messerschmidt A. Wever R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Acta. 1981; 678: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), is structurally similar to phosphate. Moreover, apochloroperoxidase can function as a phosphatase (17Hemrika W. Renirie R. Dekker H.L. Barnett P. Wever R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2145-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis indicates that the amino acids contributing to the active site of the vanadium-containing chloroperoxidase are also conserved in lipid phosphatases, acid phosphatases, and mammalian G6Pases (17Hemrika W.

Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), even though their overall amino acid identities are very low. Therefore, the vanadium-containing chloroperoxidase structure could provide clues to the structure of G6Pase. Alignment of the active-site residues of the vanadium-containing chloroperoxidase with the proposed phosphate-binding site of G6Pase (19Hemrika W. Wever R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 317-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) supports our earlier proposal (14Lei K.-J. Shelly L.L. Pan C.-J. Liu J.-L. Chou J.Y. J. Biol.

However, this alignment predicts that His-176 is the residue that covalently binds the phosphoryl moiety (19Hemrika W. Wever R.

If His-176 is the phosphoryl acceptor, the six-transmembrane helical model of G6Pase must be re-evaluated because it places His-176 on the opposite side of the ER membrane from Arg-83 and His-119 (14Lei K.-J.

Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 347: 166-170Google Scholar) predict that G6Pase contains nine transmembrane helices, which would place Arg-83, His-119, and His-176 on the same side of the ER membrane (19Hemrika W. Wever R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 317-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The number of transmembrane helices dictates the luminal or cytoplasmic location of the N or C terminus of G6Pase. The nine-transmembrane helical model predicts that only one terminus of G6Pase faces the cytoplasm, which will be sensitive to protease digestion. On the other hand, the six-transmembrane helical model predicts that both the N and C termini of G6Pase face either the ER lumen or the cytoplasm, and thus, both termini should have the same sensitivity to protease digestion. In this study, we performed protease protection assays using N- and C-terminal tagged G6Pase and showed that G6Pase contains an odd number of transmembrane helices, with its N terminus facing the ER lumen and its C terminus facing the cytoplasm. To examine the role of His-176 in G6Pase during catalysis, we substituted codon 176 with amino acids of different structures by site-directed mutagenesis and analyzed G6Pase activity after transient expression of wild-type (WT) and mutantG6Pase cDNAs in COS-1 cells. The phG6Pase-DraIII construct, which contains an additionalDraIII site at nucleotides 614–622 but retains the primary amino acid sequence of WT human G6Pase and exhibits WT enzymatic activity (14Lei K.-J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 11882-11886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), was used as a template for mutant construction by polymerase chain reaction. The eight-amino acid FLAG marker peptide DYKDDDDK (Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems) was used to tag the N and C termini of G6Pase. The 5′-primer for the N-terminal FLAG-tagged G6Pase (G6Pase-5′FLAG) contained an ATG initiation codon followed by the 24-base pair FLAG coding sequence (5′-GACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAG-3′) and nucleotides 80–98 of human G6Pase (9Lei K.-J. Shelly L.L. Pan C.-J. Sidbury J.B. Chou J.Y. Science. 1993; 262: 580-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar); the 3′-primer contained nucleotides 625 to 602 (I-2) of humanG6Pase-DraIII (14Lei K.-J. Shelly L.L. Pan C.-J. Liu J.-L. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11882-11886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The amplified fragment was ligated into the pSVLhG6Pase-DraIII 3′-fragment (14Lei K.-J. Shelly L.L. Pan C.-J. Liu J.-L. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11882-11886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The 5′-primer for C-terminal FLAG-tagged G6Pase (G6Pase-3′FLAG) contained nucleotides 611–634 (I-1) of human G6Pase-DraIII (14Lei K.-J. Shelly L.L. Pan C.-J. Liu J.-L. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11882-11886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar); the 3′-primer contained the last coding nucleotides (1150 to 1133) of human G6Pase (9Lei K.-J. Shelly L.L. Pan C.-J. Sidbury J.B. Chou J.Y. Science. 1993; 262: 580-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) followed by the 24-base pair FLAG coding sequence and a termination codon. The amplified fragments were ligated into the pSVLhG6Pase-DraIII 5′-fragment (14Lei K.-J. Shelly L.L. Pan C.-J. Liu J.-L. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11882-11886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The 5′-primer for G6Pase-(5–357) and G6Pase-(5–357)-3′FLAG, with an N-terminal deletion of residues 1–4, contained nucleotides 92–110 of human G6Pase, and the ATG initiation codon was provided by nucleotides 92–94 of human G6Pase. The 5′-primer for G6Pase-(14–357) and G6Pase-(14–357)-3′FLAG, with an N-terminal deletion of residues 1–13, contained an ATG initiation codon followed by nucleotides 119–139 of human G6Pase. The 3′-primer for G6Pase-(5–357) and G6Pase-(14–357) is I-2, and after polymerase chain reaction, the amplified fragment was ligated into the pSVLhG6Pase-DraIII 3′-fragment. The 3′-primer for G6Pase-(5–357)-3′FLAG and G6Pase-(14–357)-3′FLAG contained the last coding nucleotides (1150 to 1133) of human G6Pase followed by the 24-base pair FLAG coding sequence and a termination codon. After polymerase chain reaction, the amplified fragment was ligated into the pSVL vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The two outside polymerase chain reaction primers for codon 176 (nucleotides 605–607) mutants are nucleotides 77–96 (sense) and nucleotides 1130–1156 (antisense) of human G6Pase (9Lei K.-J. Shelly L.L. Pan C.-J. Sidbury J.B. Chou J.Y. Science. 1993; 262: 580-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Codon 176 (CAT) mutant primers (nucleotides 598–616) are as follows: H176A, GCT; H176I, ATT; H176K,AAG; H176M, ATG; H176N,AAT, H176S, TCT; and H176R, CGT. The amplified fragments were ligated into the pSVL vector. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. COS-1 cells were grown at 37 °C in HEPES-buffered Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium supplemented with streptomycin, penicillin, and 4% fetal bovine serum. The G6Pase construct in a pSVL vector was transfected into COS-1 cells by the DEAE-dextran/chloroquine method (21Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing/Wiley-Interscience, New York1992: 9.2.1-9.2.6Google Scholar). Mock transfections of COS-1 cells with the pSVL vector alone were used as controls. After incubation at 37 °C for 3 days, the transfected cultures were either harvested for G6Pase assays and Western blot analysis or lysed for RNA isolation. RNA was isolated by the guanidinium thiocyanate/CsCl method (22Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar), separated by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gels containing 2.2m formaldehyde, and transferred to Nytran membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The filters were hybridized at 42 °C in the presence of the phG6Pase-1 probe as described previously (9Lei K.-J. Shelly L.L. Pan C.-J. Sidbury J.B. Chou J.Y. Science. 1993; 262: 580-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis of tagged G6Pase, microsomal proteins were separated by electrophoresis through a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The filters were incubated with a monoclonal antibody against the FLAG epitope (Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems). The immunocomplex was then incubated with a second antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and visualized by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate (Kirkegarrd & Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Microsomal preparations and phosphohydrolase assays in intact or disrupted microsomes were performed essentially as described (8Shelly L.L. Lei K.-J. Pan C.-J. Sakata S.F. Ruppert S. Schutz G. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21482-21485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Appropriate amounts of microsomal proteins were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min in reaction mixtures (100 μl) containing 50 mm sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5, 10 mm Glu-6-P, and 2 mm EDTA. Sample absorbance was determined at 820 nm and is related to the amount of phosphate released using a standard curve constructed by a stock of inorganic phosphate solution. Disrupted microsomal membranes were prepared by incubating intact membranes in 0.2% deoxycholate for 20 min at 0 °C. Nonspecific phosphatase activity in microsomes was estimated by preincubating microsomal preparations at pH 5 for 10 min at 37 °C, a condition that inactivates the thermolabile G6Pase (23Hers H.G. Adv. Metab. Disord. 1964; 1: 1-44Crossref Google Scholar). The latency or intactness of microsomal preparations was assessed by comparing mannose-6-phosphohydrolase activities in intact and detergent-disrupted microsomes (1Nordlie R.C. Sukalski K.A. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1985: 349-398Crossref Google Scholar). Liver microsomes with latency values of 93–95% were used in this study. Mouse liver microsomes or cell homogenates from G6Pase-WT-, G6Pase-5′FLAG-, or G6Pase-3′FLAG-transfected COS-1 cells were used for protease protection assays. Microsomes or cell homogenates were treated with trypsin (Type XIII, 500 μg/mg of protein) or proteinase K (50 μg/mg of protein) for 30 min at room temperature. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (final concentration of 5 mm) was then added to inactivate proteinase K, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and trypsin inhibitor (final concentration of 6 mg/mg of protein) were added to inactivate trypsin. The reaction mixtures were diluted 100-fold to 10 ml with cold buffer A (0.25 m sucrose and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The microsomal pellets were resuspended in buffer A and used for either phosphohydrolase assays or Western blot analysis. Microsomes or cell homogenates treated first with 0.5% deoxycholate and then with trypsin or proteinase K were used as controls. G6Pase is tightly associated with the ER membrane (1Nordlie R.C. Sukalski K.A. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1985: 349-398Crossref Google Scholar). Therefore, protease protection assays using N- and C-terminal taggedG6Pase constructs should allow us to assess whether G6Pase possesses an even or odd number of transmembrane segments as well as the location of its N and C termini with respect to the ER lumen. We have previously shown that the eight C-terminal residues of human G6Pase are not required for activity (14Lei K.-J. Shelly L.L. Pan C.-J. Liu J.-L. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11882-11886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), suggesting that a small C-terminal tag should not markedly disturb G6Pase activity. To investigate whether N-terminal perturbation affects G6Pase, we examined the effects of N-terminal deletions on enzymatic activity. While deletion of residues 1–13 (G6Pase-(14–357)) abolished G6Pase activity, deletion of residues 1–4 yielded mutant G6Pase (G6Pase-(5–357)) retaining ∼60% of WT enzymatic activity (Fig. 1), suggesting that a small N-terminal tag should also not greatly disturb G6Pase activity. To tag G6Pase, we used the eight-amino acid FLAG marker peptide DYKDDDDK, which is small and hydrophilic and should offer minimal disruption to the native protein configuration of the enzyme. As expected, the N-terminal (G6Pase-5′FLAG) and C-terminal (G6Pase-3′FLAG) tagged G6Pase constructs retained >70% of WT enzymatic activity when analyzed after transient transfection in COS-1 cells (Fig. 1). Moreover, the G6Pase-(5–357)-3′FLAG construct also retained >60% of WT activity. Northern blot analysis of G6Pasetranscripts showed that WT and N-terminal deleted and taggedG6Pase constructs directed the expression of similar levels of G6Pase mRNA in transfected cells (Fig. 1). Our data show that G6Pase mRNA expression was not affected by the addition of N- or C-terminal FLAG or by the deletion of up to 14 N-terminal residues. Therefore, the decrease in enzymatic activity of the tagged or G6Pase-(5–357) constructs and the loss of activity of the G6Pase-(14–357) and G6Pase-(14–357)-3′FLAG constructs were not due to a decrease in transfection efficiency. The nine-transmembrane helical model (19Hemrika W. Wever R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 317-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 20Hoffman K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 347: 166-170Google Scholar) predicts that the N and C termini of G6Pase would be situated at the opposite sides of the ER membrane. On the other hand, the six-transmembrane helical model (10Klein P. Kanehisa M. DeLisa C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 815: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 14Lei K.-J. Shelly L.L. Pan C.-J. Liu J.-L. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11882-11886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) predicts that both the N and C termini of G6Pase would be situated at the same side of the ER membrane. Therefore, the FLAG tag at the luminal N or C terminus should be resistant to proteolysis, whereas the FLAG tag at the cytoplasmic N or C terminus should be sensitive to protease digestion. Intact microsomes, isolated from G6Pase-5′FLAG- and G6Pase-3′FLAG-transfected COS-1 cells, were subjected to digestion by two serine proteases, proteinase K and trypsin, in the absence or presence of deoxycholate. Proteinase K is a broad spectrum protease exhibiting no pronounced cleavage specificity (24Ebeling W. Hennrich N. Klockow M. Metz H. Orth H.D. Lang H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 47: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), whereas trypsin cleaves peptide bonds between Lys or Arg and an unspecific amino acid (25Smyth D.G. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 214-231Crossref Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The presence of the FLAG epitope was visualized by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2). Regardless of the transmembrane topology, the C-terminal domain of human G6Pase contains a trypsin cleavage site (KKSL, amino acids 354–357), and there is none at the N-terminal domain (9Lei K.-J. Shelly L.L. Pan C.-J. Sidbury J.B. Chou J.Y. Science. 1993; 262: 580-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). However, tagging the N or C terminus of G6Pase with the FLAG peptide DYKDDDDK generated an artificial trypsin cleavage site at each terminus. In the absence of detergent, the C-terminal FLAG tag in G6Pase was removed by both proteinase K and trypsin, whereas the N-terminal FLAG tag was resistant to digestion by both proteases (Fig. 2). This indicates that human G6Pase possesses an odd number of transmembrane helices, with the N terminus localized in the ER lumen and the C terminus in the cytoplasm. As expected, in detergent-permeabilized microsomes, both N- and C-terminal FLAG tags were cleaved by proteinase K and trypsin (Fig. 2). To efficiently cleave the C-terminal FLAG tag in human G6Pase, we used a trypsin concentration (500 μg/mg of microsomal protein) that was at least 50-fold higher than previously used for intact liver microsomes (4Nilsson O. Dallner G. FEBS Lett. 1975; 58: 190-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 5Nilsson O.S. Arion W.J. Depierre J.W. Dallner G. Ernster L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 82: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 6Waddell I.D. Burchell A. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 7Speth M. Schulze H.-U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 590-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effects of proteinase K and of a higher concentration of trypsin on hepatic microsomal G6Pase activity in the absence or presence of deoxycholate (TableI). In the absence of proteases, G6Pase activity in intact hepatic microsomes was lower than the activity in detergent-permeabilized microsomes (Table I), a characteristic of mammalian microsomal G6Pase (1Nordlie R.C. Sukalski K.A. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1985: 349-398Crossref Google Scholar). Both proteinase K and trypsin moderately inhibited G6Pase activity in intact liver microsomes. However, enzymatic activity increased when detergent was added to intact microsomes after prior inactivation of either protease (TableI). On the other hand, both proteases markedly inhibited G6Pase activity in detergent-disrupted microsomes.Table IEffects of proteinase K and trypsin on microsomal G6Pase activityPhosphohydrolase activityIntact microsomesDisrupted microsomesMicrosomes disrupted after proteolysisMicrosomes disrupted before proteolysisnmol/min/mgMouse liver None100.0 ± 2.5160.6 ± 7.0 Proteinase K82.0 ± 3.2168.2 ± 3.33.3 ± 0.5 Trypsin79.4 ± 2.6136.4 ± 1.544.5 ± 0.8G6Pase-WT None98.1 ± 1.8172.7 ± 1.7 Proteinase K57.0 ± 4.0115.8 ± 1.41.1 ± 0.1 Trypsin71.0 ± 6.0167.2 ± 4.917.7 ± 3.5G6Pase-5′FLAG None82.9 ± 8.5143.8 ± 2.3 Proteinase K59.1 ± 5.1122.6 ± 1.411.2 ± 2.5 Trypsin74.1 ± 3.5155.2 ± 5.252.4 ± 3.0G6Pase-3′FLAG None69.1 ± 0.6126.5 ± 7.1 Proteinase K41.5 ± 0.384.3 ± 3.54.5 ± 0.6 Trypsin53.5 ± 4.5132.5 ± 2.023.9 ± 3.3 Open table in a new tab To demonstrate that in vitro expressed WT or tagged G6Pases in intact microsomes are also resistant to limited proteolysis, we examined microsomal G6Pase activity from G6Pase-WT-, G6Pase-5′FLAG-, and G6Pase-3′FLAG-transfected COS-1 cells after digestion by proteinase K or trypsin in the absence or presence of deoxycholate (Table I). In the absence of proteases, G6Pase activity in intact microsomes isolated from G6Pase-WT-, G6Pase-5′FLAG-, or G6Pase-3′FLAG-transfected cells was lower than the activity in detergent-permeabilized microsomes, as was observed with hepatic microsomes (Table I). Treatment of intact microsomes isolated from G6Pase-WT-, G6Pase-5′FLAG-, or G6Pase-3′FLAG-transfected cells with either proteinase K or trypsin moderately decreased G6Pase activity, and enzymatic activity increased when detergent was added to the microsomes after inactivation of either protease (Table I). As expected, proteinase K or trypsin greatly reduced G6Pase activity in detergent-permeabilized microsomes (TableI). Therefore, protease sensitivity of in vitro expressed G6Pase is comparable to that of the endogenous liver enzyme, and catalytic activity of G6Pase was not affected by the addition of an N- or C-terminal FLAG tag. Our study demonstrates that G6Pase possesses an odd number of transmembrane helices, supporting the new nine-transmembrane helical model (19Hemrika W. Wever R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 317-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 20Hoffman K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 347: 166-170Google Scholar). According to this model, Arg-83, His-119, and His-176, which are predicted to contribute to the active site of G6Pase, reside on the same side of the ER membrane (Fig. 3). In an earlier study, we have shown that Arg-83 is involved in positioning the phosphoryl moiety and that His-119 is absolutely required for G6Pase activity (14Lei K.-J. Shelly L.L. Pan C.-J. Liu J.-L. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11882-11886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Active-site alignment of vanadium-containing chloroperoxidase and mammalian G6Pases suggests that Arg-83 in G6Pase is a candidate for positioning the phosphate, His-119 is a proposed acid-base group in catalysis, and His-176 is the residue that covalently binds the phosphoryl moiety (17Hemrika W. Renirie R. Dekker H.L. Barnett P. Wever R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2145-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 19Hemrika W. Wever R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 317-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). If His-176 is indeed the phosphoryl acceptor, then this residue should be essential for G6Pase activity. Therefore, we generated mutant G6Pase constructs with seven different substitutions at codon 176 (Ala (H176A), Ile (H176I), Lys (H76K), Met (H176M), Asn (H176N), Ser (H176S), and Arg (H176R)), and the resulting G6Pase activity was analyzed after transient expression in COS-1 cells (Table II). Consistent with our hypothesis, none of these codon 176 mutants had detectable G6Pase activity.Table IIG6Pase activity of codon 176 mutant constructsConstructsPhosphohydrolase activitynmol/min/mgMock13.1 ± 0.1G6Pase-WT121.2 ± 9.8H176A11.3 ± 1.0H176I12.0 ± 1.2H176K11.5 ± 0.5H176M12.3 ± 0.6H176N13.0 ± 0.6H176S13.8 ± 2.0H176R12.2 ± 0.71 Open table in a new tab Northern blot hybridization analysis of G6Pase transcripts from transfected cells showed that WT as well as the various codon 176 mutant G6Pase mRNAs were expressed at similar levels (data not shown). This indicates that the reduction in enzymatic activity was due to the defect in the G6Pase protein and not due to a decrease in transfection efficiency. In this study, we have characterized the orientation of human G6Pase in the ER and demonstrated that this enzyme contains an odd number of transmembrane helices, with the N terminus localized in the ER lumen and the C terminus in the cytoplasm. Our data best support the nine-transmembrane helical model for G6Pase (19Hemrika W. Wever R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 317-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 20Hoffman K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 347: 166-170Google Scholar), rather than the six-transmembrane helical model (14Lei K.-J. Shelly L.L. Pan C.-J. Liu J.-L. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11882-11886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) previously predicted (10Klein P. Kanehisa M. DeLisa C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 815: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). According to the nine-transmembrane helical topology, the residues predicted to compose the active center in G6Pase, Arg-83, His-119, and His-176, are all situated on the luminal side of the ER membrane (Fig. 3). Our data support the proposal that helices 2–5 are in close contact and form the core of the catalytic center of G6Pase (19Hemrika W. Wever R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 317-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of mammalian G6Pases, acid phosphatases, lipid phosphatases, and vanadium-containing chloroperoxidase has identified a conserved phosphatase sequence motif, KXXXXXX RPX 12–54PSGHSRXXXXXHXXXD (17Hemrika W.

Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This supports the results of our earlier study, which demonstrated that Arg-83 and His-119 in G6Pase (the two boldface residues in this motif) are essential for G6Pase activity (14Lei K.-J. Shelly L.L. Pan C.-J. Liu J.-L. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11882-11886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). During catalysis, a phosphoryl-enzyme intermediate is formed, and a His residue in G6Pase is the phosphoryl acceptor (11Nordlie R.C. Lygre D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3136-3141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Feldman F. Butler L.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 268: 698-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 13Countaway J.L. Waddell I.D. Burchell A. Arion W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2673-2678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of the known tertiary structure of vanadium-containing chloroperoxidase suggested that the function of Arg-83 in G6Pase is to position the phosphoryl moiety (19Hemrika W. Wever R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 317-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), as we originally proposed (14Lei K.-J. Shelly L.L. Pan C.-J. Liu J.-L. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11882-11886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This alignment also suggests that His-119 provides the proton needed to liberate the glucose moiety and that His-176 acts as the nucleophile forming the phosphohistidine-enzyme intermediate (19Hemrika W. Wever R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 317-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies confirmed that His-119 is absolutely essential for G6Pase activity, and it was suggested that His-119 could be the phosphoryl acceptor in G6Pase (14Lei K.-J. Shelly L.L. Pan C.-J. Liu J.-L. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11882-11886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We now show that codon 176, proposed to covalently bind the phosphoryl moiety, is another residue absolutely required for G6Pase activity. Whether His-176 is indeed the phosphoryl acceptor in G6Pase will be the focus of future studies. Alignment of the active sites of vanadium-containing chloroperoxidase and mammalian G6Pases suggests that, in addition to Arg-83, Lys-76 and Arg-170 in human G6Pase also participate in positioning the phosphoryl moiety, and Ser-117 and Gly-118 may participate in hydrogen bonding (Fig. 3). It will be of interest to study the roles of these residues during G6Pase catalysis. Microsomes are closed vesicles with a defined cytoplasmic-side out orientation (26Wessels H.P. Beltzer J.P. Spiess M. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 287-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, protein domains exposed on the outside of the ER can be selectively digested by proteases. G6Pase activity in intact liver microsomes is resistant to limited proteolysis, suggesting that the active site is not on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane (4Nilsson O. Dallner G.

In this study, we demonstrate that G6Pase activity in intact microsomes isolated from mouse liver as well as from G6Pase-WT-, G6Pase-5′FLAG-, and G6Pase-3′FLAG-transfected COS-1 cells is resistant to limited proteolysis. Therefore, the orientation of the in vitro expressed G6Pase in the ER is similar to that of liver microsomal G6Pase. To date, at least 29 mutations have been identified in the G6Pase gene of GSD-1a patients (9Lei K.-J. Shelly L.L. Pan C.-J. Sidbury J.B. Chou J.Y.

Seventeen amino acids in human G6Pase were altered by the known missense and codon deletion mutations. Thirteen missense mutations and the codon deletion mutation (ΔF327) uncovered in this laboratory were shown to abolish or greatly reduce G6Pase activity in transient expression assays (9Lei K.-J.

The 17 amino acids mutated in the G6Pase gene of GSD-1a patients are illustrated in Fig. 3. According to the nine-transmembrane helical topology of G6Pase, the four loops facing the cytoplasm are relatively short, varying from 8 to 12 residues. The two large loops, which are situated between helices 2 and 3 (37 residues, loop 1L) and helices 6 and 7 (33 residues, loop 3L), are located on the luminal side of the ER. Among the 17 amino acids mutated in GSD-1a patients, 14 are situated in transmembrane helices 1–9, two are located in loop 1L, and one in loop 3L (Fig. 3). No missense or codon deletion mutations have yet been identified in the four cytoplasmic loops or N- and C-terminal domains of human G6Pase. Therefore, G6Pase activity depends on the structural integrity of the transmembrane helices, and residues in the two large luminal loops also play crucial roles. It is tempting to suggest that during catalysis, the structural requirement of the cytoplasmic loops and N- and C-terminal domains are less stringent than the other features of human G6Pase. It is worth noting that the apparent molecular mass of the G6Pase protein in intact microsomes was not notably altered after digestion by either proteinase K or trypsin. This was demonstrated by Western blot analysis of the G6Pase-5′FLAG protein before and after proteolysis. This is expected since trypsin is predicted to cleave off a small peptide (KSL, amino acids 355–357 of human G6Pase) of 0.3 kDa, which would not substantially reduce the apparent molecular mass of the G6Pase protein. Additionally, G6Pase activity increased to the levels of the permeabilized control microsomes when detergent was added to intact microsomes, after inactivation of either protease. Our data indicate that only a small number of C-terminal residues were removed by either proteinase K or trypsin and that the tertiary structure of G6Pase remained intact after proteolysis. It appears that the short cytoplasmic loops are not readily accessible to proteolysis, suggesting that they are closely associated with the ER membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2073002157,"STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) is a key transcription factor mediating the signals for a variety of cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6). The Stat3 gene itself is activated by IL-6 signals. We show that the region of the signal-transducing subunit, gp130, essential for STAT3 activation, is also required for activation of the Stat3 gene. To elucidate the mechanisms activating the Stat3 gene, we identified an IL-6 response element (IL-6RE) in the Stat3gene promoter containing both a low affinity STAT3-binding element and a cAMP-responsive element (CRE). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that IL-6 induced a slowly migrating complex on the IL-6RE containing a STAT3 homodimer and an unidentified CRE-binding protein. With the combination of transient transfection assays using mutantStat3 promoter-reporter constructs and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we found that the formation of a slowly migrating complex was required for full activation of the Stat3 gene. Thus, STAT3 activates the Stat3gene in cooperation with an unidentified CRE-binding protein. This regulatory mechanism is similar to that of the junB gene, which is activated by IL-6 through the junB IL-6RE, which contains a low affinity STAT3-binding site and a CRE-like site.

Furthermore, several growth factors (such as epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and fibroblast growth factor) and non-receptor tyrosine kinases (including c-Src, c-Abl, and their v-oncogene products) have been shown to activate STAT proteins (13Ruff Jamison S.

Thus, three different types of tyrosine kinases, Janus kinases, receptor-type tyrosine kinases, and certain Src family tyrosine kinases, can all activate STAT proteins, probably by directly phosphorylating the tyrosine residue critical for causing the STAT molecules to form homo- or heterodimers through their SH2 domains (20Schindler C.

Tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT dimers enter the nucleus and activate the target genes by binding to their specific target DNA sequences (26Shuai K. Ziemiecki A. Wilks A.F. Harpur A.G. Sadowski H.B. Gilman M.Z. Darnell J.E. Nature. 1993; 366: 580-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The cis-acting DNA sequences recognized by STAT dimers, the STAT-binding element (SBE), have the general structure TTN5AA (1Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4973) Google Scholar, 27Seidel H.M. Milocco L.H. Lamb P. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stein R.B. Rosen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3041-3045Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The sequence and the size of the spacer region affect the binding of the respective STAT dimers (27Seidel H.M. Milocco L.H. Lamb P. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stein R.B. Rosen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3041-3045Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). In certain cases, STAT proteins bind to the target DNA in combination with other DNA-binding proteins. For instance, the STAT3 homodimer forms a complex with p36 CRE-binding protein for an IL-6 response element in the junB gene (JRE-IL6) (28Kojima H. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 547-554PubMed Google Scholar) or with c-Jun for the α2-macroglobulin APRE (29Schaefer T.S. Sanders L.K. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9097-9101Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The STAT1 homodimer has been shown to make a complex with Sp1 for the interferon-γ response element of the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 gene (30Look D.C. Pelletier M.R. Tidwell R.M. Roswit W.T. Holtzman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30264-30267Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Stocklin et al. (31Stocklin E. Wissler M. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Nature. 1996; 383: 726-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) showed that the glucocorticoid receptor can act as a coactivator and enhance STAT5-dependent transcription by making complexes with STAT5. STAT dimers even form complexes with other STAT dimers through their amino-terminal regions on the repeated low affinity SBEs in the interferon-γ gene intron (32Xu X. Sun Y.L. Hoey T. Science. 1996; 273: 794-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Therefore, in addition to the sequence of a SBE itself, the sequence outside the SBE is also critical for determining the target gene specificity because the complex formation with other proteins or other STAT dimers sometimes changes the binding specificity or increases the affinity of the complex for the DNA (21Qureshi S.A. Salditt Georgieff M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3829-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar,28Kojima H. Nakajima K. Hirano T.

Other important determinants for STAT function might be the intensity and duration of the STAT activity and the amounts of STAT proteins ready to be activated in the cells. All of these factors eventually determine the range of target genes and the duration and intensity of target gene activation and thereby often determine the outcome, such as differentiation, growth, and cell survival or death. We have previously shown that STAT3 is critical for IL-6-induced gene regulation, including the repression of c-myb and c-myc, the induction of junB and IRF1, and IL-6-induced growth arrest and terminal macrophage differentiation in M1 leukemic cells (33Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Nakae K. Kojima H. Ichiba M. Kiuchi N. Kitaoka T. Fukada T. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3651-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 34Yamanaka Y. Nakajima K. Fukada T. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Moreover, STAT3 activity is critical for the gp130-mediated anti-apoptotic signal in murine pro-B BaF/B03 cells (35Fukada T. Hibi M. Yamanaka Y. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Fujitani Y. Yamaguchi T. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Immunity. 1996; 5: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). To understand how STAT3-mediated signals affect growth, differentiation, and cell death or survival in different types of cells, it is important to study the regulatory mechanisms of Stat3 gene expression itself. In this study, we characterize the signals required for Stat3 gene activation and show that STAT3 activates the Stat3 gene promoter through a novel IL-6 response element containing two DNA motifs, a low affinity SBE and a CRE. This is similar to the mechanism for JRE-IL6, a previously characterized IL-6 response element in the junB promoter (36Nakajima K. Kusafuka T. Takeda T. Fujitani Y. Nakae K. Hirano T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3027-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). M1 murine myeloid leukemic cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% horse serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. M1 transformants expressing the chimeric receptors containing the extracellular domain of the GHR and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of gp130 have been described previously (34Yamanaka Y. Nakajima K. Fukada T. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Of those, seven clones for each (M1-GHR277, M1-GHR133, M1-GHR108, M1-GHR68, M1-GHR133F2, M1-GHR133F3, and M1-GHR133F2/3) were used in this study. HepG2 hepatoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). MH60 B cell hybridoma cells (37Matsuda T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 951-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 0.2 ng/ml recombinant human IL-6. Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the procedures recommended by the manufacturer. Total RNA (15 μg/sample) was separated by electrophoresis in formaldehyde-containing 1% agarose gels and transferred to Hybond N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Corp.). Membranes were hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA fragments overnight, washed three times with 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 56 °C, and subjected to autoradiography. The amount of loaded RNA was verified by ethidium bromide staining or by measuring the expression level of CHO-B mRNA. The probes used were the 2.5-kbSalI-BamHI fragment of pBSHA-STAT3 containing a full-length STAT3 cDNA and the 0.6-kbEcoRI-BamHI fragment of CHO-B cDNA (a gift from J. E. Darnell, Jr.). A mouse Stat3 5′-flanking region was obtained by PCR using the Promoter Finder DNA Walking kit (CLONTECH). Two gene-specific primers, 5′-CTCAGCGATCCGGTTAGGGCTCGTT-3′ (GSP1) and 5′-CAGGTTCCCCCTCCCTGTC TACACT-3′ (GSP2), were made based on the sequence of the mouse Stat3 cDNA reported by Akira et al. (38Akira S. Nishio Y. Inoue M. Wang X.J. Wei S. Matsusaka T. Yoshida K. Sudo T. Naruto M. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1994; 77: 63-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Primary PCR and secondary nested PCR were done using the GSP1 and GSP2 primers, the primers (AP1 and AP2) corresponding to the adaptor sequences, and adaptor-ligated genomic libraries. The resulting 2.2-kb PCR fragment was subcloned using the TA cloning vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). DNA sequencing was carried out using an automated sequencer, and data were obtained for both strands. A series of 5′-deletion mutations of the Stat3 5′-flanking region were made by subcloning the EcoRV-BamHI, SspI-BamHI, ScaI-BamHI, AflII-BamHI, StyI-BamHI, and PvuII-BamHI fragments into the reporter construct pSPLuc, containing a luciferase gene and SV40 poly(A) signal inserted into pSP72 between the PvuII and BamHI sites. The oligonucleotides used as probes or competitors were as follows: Stat3-IL-6RE-WT (where WT is wild-type), 5′-GTGTCTTGACGTCACGCACTGCCAGGAACT-3′ and 3′-AGAACTGCAGTGCGTGACGGTCCTTGAGTCG-5′;Stat3-IL-6RE-mSTAT, 5′-GTGTCTTGACGTCACGCACTGCCAGGTCCT-3′ and 3′-AGAACTGCAGTGCGTGACGGTCCAGGAGTCG-5′;Stat3-IL-6RE-mCRE, 5′-GTGTCTTGTCATCACGCACTGCCAGGAACT-3′ and 3′-AGAACAGTAGTGCGTGACGGTCCTTGAGTCG-5′. The underlined bases are the mutated ones. The APRE and somatostatin CRE probes were synthesized as reported previously (28Kojima H. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 547-554PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced at the STAT3-binding element or the CRE site of the Stat3IL-6RE in the context of the intact Stat3 promoter with the 2.2-kb upstream region by the overlap extension technique using PCR. The primers used for these mutations were as follows: for mSTAT, 5′-ACTGCCAGGTCCTCAGCTGAGTTTTCAG-3′ and 5′-AGCTGAGGACCTGGCAGTGCGTGACGT-3′; for mCRE, 5′-GTGTCTTGTCATCACGCACTGCCAGGAACT-3′ and 5′-AGTGCGTGATGACAAGACACTTTGAATGCCCT-3′; for the 5′-primer, 5′-CCCAAATGCTTAAGTGGGGTGACACCT-3′; and for the 3′-primer, 5′-AGCTCGGATCCACTAGTAACGGCCG-3′. The underlined bases are the mutated ones. After the PCR products were subcloned into pCR2.1, the sequences of the PCR products were verified by sequencing the products. The PCR products were digested with SacI and inserted at the proper position of p2166-Stat3-Luc-WT to make p2166-Stat3-Luc-mSTAT and p2166-Stat3-Luc-mCRE. The primers used to make the p478/229-Luc series were as follows: for the 5′-primer, 5′-AACGCTGCAGTTAAGTGGGGTGACACCTGG; and for the 3′-primer, 5′-CCAGGTACCCCAAGGGACGCGCAGAGGCC. The PCR products were digested with PstI and KpnI and inserted upstream of the minimal junB promoter at the PstI-KpnI sites of pSPBLuc. For transfection experiments, HepG2 cells were transfected with DNA using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method (36Nakajima K. Kusafuka T. Takeda T. Fujitani Y. Nakae K. Hirano T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3027-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Typically, 1.2 μg of one of the reporter plasmids containing the firefly luciferase gene and 1 μg of pEF-lacZ, an expression vector containing the lacZ gene encoding β-galactosidase as an internal control for transfection efficiency, were used. Three μg of pCAGGS-Neo (an expression vector without an insert; control) or pCAGGS-NeoHA-STAT1F or pCAGGS-NeoHA-STAT3F (expression vectors containing a cDNA encoding either HA-STAT1F or HA-STAT3F (33Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Nakae K. Kojima H. Ichiba M. Kiuchi N. Kitaoka T. Fukada T. Hibi M. Hirano T.

Cells were incubated with DNA precipitates for 16 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fed Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% fetal calf serum for 20–24 h, and stimulated with 100 ng/ml IL-6 for the last 16 h. Approximately 40–45 h after transfection, cells were collected in 120 μl of lysis buffer and subjected to assays for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities as described (28Kojima H. Nakajima K.

Oncogene. 1996; 12: 547-554PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extracts (10 μg) were incubated in a final volume of 20 μl of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 80 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) with each 32P-labeled probe (10,000 cpm, 0.5–1 ng) for 20 min at room temperature. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 4.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 2.5% glycerol in 0.25× TBE (1× TBE is 0.13 mTris base, 0.12 m boric acid, and 2.0 mm EDTA, pH 8.8) at room temperature and autoradiographed. For competition analysis, extracts were preincubated with a 50- or 250-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides for 5 min before the addition of labeled oligonucleotide. For antibody interaction studies, antisera or monoclonal antibody specific to several transcription factors was included in the binding reaction during a 30-min preincubation on ice. The antibodies used were as follows: anti-STAT1 N terminus (amino acids 1–194 of human STAT1; anti-ISGF3 G16920) monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY); anti-STAT3 C terminus (amino acids 702–770 of human STAT3) polyclonal antibody (28Kojima H. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 547-554PubMed Google Scholar); anti-CREB rabbit polyclonal antibody (9192; New England Biolabs Inc.); anti-CRE-BP1 (ATF2) rabbit polyclonal antibody (SC187X; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); anti-c-Jun/AP-1 goat polyclonal antibody recognizing the DNA-binding domains of c-Jun, JunB, and JunD (SC44X; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.); anti-ATF3 rabbit polyclonal antibody (SC188X; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.); and anti-ATF4 mouse monoclonal antibody (SC244X; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The effectiveness of the antibodies including anti-STAT1, anti-STAT3, anti-c-Jun, anti-ATF2, and anti-CREB was verified in electrophoretic mobility shift assays using the Stat3 IL-6RE probe and appropriate nuclear extracts containing the endogenous proteins or exogenously expressed ATF2, c-Jun, or CREB (data not shown). Anti-ATF3 and anti-ATF4 antibodies for gel shift assays were used following the manufacturer's instructions. Akiraet al. (38Akira S. Nishio Y. Inoue M. Wang X.J. Wei S. Matsusaka T. Yoshida K. Sudo T. Naruto M. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1994; 77: 63-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar) reported that treatment with IL-6 increases the level of Stat3 mRNA severalfold in liver. Also, we showed that IL-6 treatment of M1 cells increases the protein level of STAT3 and that the increased level is sustained for >48 h (33Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Nakae K. Kojima H. Ichiba M. Kiuchi N. Kitaoka T. Fukada T. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3651-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). To begin a deeper analysis of STAT3 regulation, we first determined a detailed time course for the IL-6-induced mRNA expression of the Stat3 gene in M1, HepG2, and IL-6-dependent MH60 B cell hybridoma cells. In M1 cells, the level of Stat3mRNA started to increase at 1 h in response to IL-6 and reached its maximum level at 3 h. After reaching its maximum, Stat3 mRNA levels showed a slight transient decrease at 6 h and then increased again for over 48 h (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1–6). The induction of Stat3 mRNA was also tested in the presence of cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor. Treatment of M1 cells with cycloheximide failed to inhibit the IL-6-induced activation of the Stat3 gene (Fig. 1 A, lanes 7–9), indicating that the induction of Stat3 by IL-6 did not require new protein synthesis. The rapid induction of Stat3 mRNA by IL-6 was also observed with HepG2 cells (Fig. 1 B) and MH60 cells (data not shown). We next analyzed which part of gp130 was necessary for the induction of Stat3 gene expression. Using M1 transformants expressing chimeric receptors consisting of the extracellular domain of the GHR and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of gp130 with progressive C-terminal truncations and point mutations at the tyrosine residues (34Yamanaka Y. Nakajima K. Fukada T. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), we proceeded to identify the cytoplasmic region of gp130 required for Stat3 gene transactivation. Growth hormone enhanced Stat3 gene expression in the transformants expressing the chimeric receptors containing at least 133 amino acid residues of the gp130 cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 2, lanes 1–6). Chimeric receptors with further truncation of gp130 to 108 or 68 amino acid residues (GHR108 and GHR68) were unable to induce Stat3gene expression (Fig. 2, lanes 7–12). GHR133F2, which contains a Tyr-to-Phe mutation at the second tyrosine (Tyr-2), could activate the Stat3 gene (Fig. 2, lanes 13–15), but GHR133F3, which has a Tyr-to-Phe mutation at the third tyrosine (Tyr-3), and GHR133F2/3, which has Tyr-to-Phe mutations at both Tyr-2 and Tyr-3, did not activate the Stat3 gene (lanes 16–21). These results show that the cytoplasmic region of gp130 from amino acids 108 to 133, with an intact YXXQ motif at Tyr-3, is required for activating the Stat3 gene. As this region corresponds to the region required for activating the STAT3 protein, it is likely that STAT3 participates in the transcriptional activation of its own promoter. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms activating the Stat3 gene promoter, we obtained a 2.2-kb fragment of the Stat3 gene 5′-flanking region by genomic PCR. The sequence of the proximal region up to −478 bp with the known DNA motifs is shown in Fig. 3 A. The sequence published by Shi et al. (39Shi W. Inoue M. Minami M. Takeda K. Matsumoto M. Matsuda Y. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 1996; 8: 1205-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) is missing a 0.25-kb region between positions −424 and −169. We first constructed a reporter gene containing the 2.2-kb Stat3 gene 5′-flanking region linked to the luciferase reporter gene and tested whether this 2.2-kb fragment showed IL-6 responsiveness by transfecting the reporter gene construct into HepG2 cells, followed by IL-6 stimulation for 16 h. Dominant-negative STAT3 and STAT1 expression vectors were also cotransfected with the promoter-reporter construct to test whether STAT3 is involved in the IL-6 activation of the Stat3 gene promoter. As shown in Fig. 3 B, IL-6 increased the promoter activity of the 2.2-kb 5′-flanking region by ∼5-fold, and this induction was effectively inhibited by dominant-negative STAT3 (DN-Stat3), but not by dominant-negative STAT1 (DN-Stat1), indicating that the IL-6 activation of the 2.2-kb Stat3 gene promoter was dependent on STAT3. Next, to localize the region containing the IL-6 response element, a series of 5′-deletion mutations of the Stat3 gene promoter constructs were made and tested for IL-6 responsiveness as described above. The promoter regions retained a similar level of IL-6 responsiveness when the promoter contained up to position −478 (Fig. 3 C). However, deletion up to position −229 substantially decreased the IL-6 responsiveness, suggesting that an IL-6 response element(s) resides in the −478/−229 region (Fig. 3 C). To test whether the −478/−/229 region alone has the ability to render a heterologous minimal promoter responsive to IL-6, we assayed the IL-6 responsiveness of a luciferase construct containing the −478/−229 DNA fragment inserted upstream of the minimal junBpromoter-luciferase gene construct (p478/229-Luc). As shown in Fig. 4 A, IL-6 increased the transcription of the reporter gene driven by the −478/−229 fragment by ∼10-fold. As expected, dominant-negative STAT3 (DN-Stat3), but not STAT1 (DN-Stat1), effectively inhibited the IL-6 responsiveness of the −478/−229 region. These results indicate that STAT3 activates its own transcription through the −478/−229 region. We next searched for STAT3-binding sequence(s) within the −478/−229 DNA region. Although we could not find a typical STAT3-binding sequence (a TT-AA motif with a spacing of 5 bp) within the −478/−229 DNA region, instead we found an atypical SBE (TGCCTGGAA) and a CRE (TGACGTCA) with a 5-bp spacing between the motifs, which is very similar to the junB response element for IL-6 (JRE-IL6) (Fig. 3 A) (28Kojima H. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 547-554PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether both the SBE and CRE were responsible for IL-6 responsiveness, we made two different p478/229-Luc mutants containing mutations at the SBE (p478/229-Luc-mSTAT) or the CRE (p478/229-Luc-mCRE), as illustrated in Fig. 4 B, and tested them for IL-6 responsiveness. Mutations at the putative SBE reduced the IL-6 responsiveness by >90%, and mutations at the CRE reduced it by >80% (Fig. 4 B). These results indicated that both DNA motifs were required for IL-6 responsiveness. To assess the role of the two DNA motifs in the intact 2.2-kb Stat3 gene promoter, we introduced the same mutations as described above into the Stat3 IL-6RE in the intact 2.2-kb Stat3 promoter (p2166-Stat3-Luc-mSTAT and p2166-Stat3-Luc-mCRE). As shown in Fig. 4 C, mutations at the putative STAT3-binding site in the 2.2-kbStat3 promoter (p2166-Stat3-Luc-mSTAT) severely reduced the IL-6 responsiveness of the Stat3 promoter by >80%, and mutations at the CRE reduced the IL-6 responsiveness of the promoter by ∼60%. The weaker inhibition by the mutations at the CRE in the otherwise intact promoter compared with that by the mutations at the CRE in the context of the −478/−229 region alone may be due to the existence of unidentified region(s) cooperatively working with STAT3 outside the −478/−229 region. These results, in any case, indicate that the two DNA motifs in the Stat3 IL-6RE are the major determinants in the 2.2-kb Stat3 promoter for IL-6 responsiveness. We next examined the nature of the Stat3 IL-6RE-binding complexes in the nuclear extracts from IL-6-stimulated M1, HepG2, and MH60 cells by electrophoretic mobility shift assays using an oligonucleotide containing the Stat3 IL-6RE as a probe. We also used another oligonucleotide containing the α2-macroglobulin APRE (40Wegenka U.M. Buschmann J. Lukkicken C. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) as a control for STAT binding. Nuclear extracts from IL-6-stimulated MH60 cells showed a prominent IL-6-inducible Stat3IL-6RE-binding complex on the Stat3 IL-6RE probe (indicated as Stat3IL6RE-BC), which appeared rapidly at 15 min, declined transiently at 3 h, and returned to the level of 15 min at 6 h (Fig. 5 A, lanes 2–5). The mobility of the IL-6-inducedStat3 IL-6RE-binding complex is slower than that of the APRE-binding complex containing a STAT3 homodimer, called APRF (40Wegenka U.M. Buschmann J. Lukkicken C. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 A, lane 7). More important, the level of the IL-6-inducible complex is equivalent to that of APRF (Fig. 5 A, compare lanes 2 and 7). This IL-6-inducible complex could be seen more clearly in MH60 nuclear extracts than in M1 and HepG2 nuclear extracts, although similar IL-6-inducible complexes were present in the nuclear extracts from all three cell lines (data not shown). Therefore, only results with MH60 nuclear extracts are shown. To investigate the binding sites and binding specificities of the Stat3 IL-6RE-binding complex, we used two mutant Stat3 IL-6RE oligonucleotides containing mutations either at the CRE site (Stat3-IL-6RE-mCRE) or at the STAT3-binding element (Stat3-IL-6RE-mSTAT) as probes and other oligonucleotides as competitors, including the APRE, JRE-IL6, and somatostatin CRE. The Stat3-IL-6RE-mSTAT probe did not show any IL-6-inducible Stat3 IL-6RE-binding complexes (Fig. 5 A, lanes 8 and 9). On the other hand, the Stat3-IL-6RE-mCRE probe showed an IL-6-inducible complex with the same mobility as that of APRF (Fig. 5 A, lanes 10 and 11), and this complex was likely to be a STAT3 homodimer since anti-STAT3 antibody shifted the complex (data not shown). Both the APRE and JRE-IL6 oligonucleotides effectively competed with the Stat3 IL-6RE probe for forming the IL-6-inducibleStat3 IL-6RE-binding complex (Fig. 5 B, lanes 2–5), whereas the somatostatin CRE oligonucleotides competed for all of the CRE-binding complexes and the Stat3IL-6RE-binding complex, but made the appearance of a fast migrating IL-6RE-binding complex (lanes 6 and 7). The complex is likely to be a STAT3 homodimer since the complex migrated as APRF on the APRE probe, and anti-STAT3 antibody shifted the complex (data not shown). This STAT3 homodimer could barely be seen on the wild-type Stat3 IL-6RE probe (Fig. 5 A). These results indicate that formation of the Stat3 IL-6RE-binding complex requires both the STAT-binding element and the CRE and suggest that the STAT-binding element has a low affinity for STAT3 homodimers alone. Next, to test whether the IL-6-inducible Stat3IL-6RE-binding complex contained STAT3, STAT1, or other known CRE-binding proteins, we included the appropriate antibody against such molecules in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 5 C). Anti-STAT3 antibody, not anti-STAT1 antibody, shifted the inducible complex, indicating that the IL-6-inducibleStat3 IL-6RE-binding complex contained STAT3 as a constituent. None of the other antibodies against transcription factors that are known to bind the CRE sites, such as c-Jun, CREB, ATF2, ATF3, and ATF4, shifted or decreased the IL-6-inducible Stat3IL-6RE-binding complex (Fig. 5 C). These results indicated that the Stat3 IL-6RE-binding complex contained both a STAT3 homodimer and unidentified CRE site-binding protein(s) distinct from CREB, ATF1, ATF2, ATF3, or ATF4. In this study, we showed that STAT3 rapidly induced transcriptional activation of the Stat3 gene through an IL-6RE located at positions −335 to −314 in the Stat3 gene promoter. This IL-6RE was shown to consist of a low affinity SBE (TGCCAGGAA) and a CRE (TGACGTCA). The functional role of the two DNA motifs in the Stat3 IL-6RE was confirmed in two ways. First, mutations at either the SBE or CRE effectively inhibited the IL-6 responsiveness of the −478/−229 fragment linked to a heterologous promoter. Second, the same mutations at the DNA motifs in the otherwise intact 2.2-kb Stat3 promoter also effectively inhibited the IL-6 responsiveness of the promoter. The functional roles of the two DNA motifs were further confirmed by the demonstration that IL-6 rapidly induced the formation of complexes with the Stat3IL-6RE. A slowly migrating complex with the IL-6RE required both the SBE and CRE. We showed that this complex contained a STAT3 dimer and unidentified CRE-binding protein(s) distinct from CREB, ATF1, ATF2/CRE-BP1, ATF3, ATF4, or the c-Jun/AP-1 family of proteins. Ternary complex formation on other IL-6 response elements containing a SBE and CRE has been shown by us (28Kojima H. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 547-554PubMed Google Scholar), including the IL-6 response elements seen in the junB promoter, JRE-IL6 (36Nakajima K. Kusafuka T. Takeda T. Fujitani Y. Nakae K. Hirano T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3027-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and the IRF1 promoter, IR/IRF1 (41Harroch S. Revel M. Chebath J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1942-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). TableI compares the sequences of such IL-6 response elements with that of the Stat3 IL-6RE. The size of the spacing between the two DNA motifs also varies from 1 to 5 bp. The combination of the DNA motifs varies: a low affinity SBE with an atypical CRE (JRE-IL6), a high affinity SBE with an atypical CRE (IR/IRF1), and a low affinity SBE with a typical CRE (Stat3IL-6RE). Considering the binding specificity of the Stat3IL-6RE-binding complex shown here and the JRE-IL6-binding complexes shown by Kojima et al. (28Kojima H. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 547-554PubMed Google Scholar), similar CRE-like site-binding protein(s) may make complexes with the STAT3 homodimer on the Stat3 IL-6RE DNA. The identification of CRE-binding protein(s) would help prove such a structure.Table ISequence comparison of the Stat3 IL6-RE in the mouse Stat3 promoter, JRE-IL6 in the junB promoter, and the IL-6 response element in the human IRF1 gene promoterCRE SBEMouse Stat3IL-6RE−338TCTTGACGTCACGCACTGCCAGGAACTC−311Mouse junBIL-6RE(JRE-IL6)−125GGCTCGCGTCAC—-TGTCAGGAAGCG−148Human IRF1 IL-6RE (IR/IRF1)−102GCGTGCCGTCAT—-TTCGGGGAAATC−125 Open table in a new tab The results of the kinetics study of the IL-6 induction of Stat3 mRNA in wild-type M1 cells (Fig. 1 A) are fully consistent with the levels of STAT3 activity detected by tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and its DNA binding activity shown previously by us (33Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Nakae K. Kojima H. Ichiba M. Kiuchi N. Kitaoka T. Fukada T. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3651-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), supporting the notion of the STAT3-mediated activation of the Stat3 gene. It is remarkable that three of the IL-6 target genes inducible in M1 cells, junB, IRF1, and Stat3, contain very similar IL-6 response elements in their promoters. Interestingly, these genes can be activated by a low dose of IL-6 (such as 1 ng/ml) in M1 cells. 2M. Ichiba, K. Nakajima, Y. Yamanaka, N. Kiuchi, and T. Hirano, unpublished data. In contrast, in another case of IL-6-induced gene regulation, the IL-6 repression of c-myc and c-myb is turned on only by higher doses of IL-6 in the same cell line.2 The difference in sensitivity to IL-6 concentration may be explained by CRE or CRE-like site-binding proteins that may be crucial in recruiting small amounts of activated STAT3 to the IL-6 response element by making complexes with STAT3 and DNA. The identification and functional role of the unidentified CRE-binding protein would help to prove this model. It has been noted that in IL-6-stimulated M1 cells, STAT3 activity persists at a high level for >48 h (33Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Nakae K. Kojima H. Ichiba M. Kiuchi N. Kitaoka T. Fukada T. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3651-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). This activation pattern is not detected in other cell lines. The sustained STAT3 activity at high levels in M1 cells may be important in causing growth arrest and terminal differentiation. Therefore, it is likely that the activation of the Stat3 gene by STAT3 in conjunction with the cooperative CRE-binding protein forms an autoregulatory loop, and this may be one of the mechanisms by which the persistent activation of STAT3 protein in M1 cells is induced. Recently, O'Brien and Manolagas (42O'Brien C.A. Manolagas S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15003-15010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) showed that transcription of the signal-transducing β-subunit of the IL-6 receptor complex (gp130) is also activated by STAT3 through a STAT-binding element in the promoter. Their findings and ours suggest the existence of autoregulatory mechanisms in the IL-6 signal-transducing system at the levels of both the receptor and the signal-transducing transcription factor. We thank J. Ishikawa for technical assistance."

https://openalex.org/W1970305997,"The molecular mechanisms for regulating water balance in many tissues are unknown. Like the kidney, the eye contains multiple water channel proteins (aquaporins) that transport water through membranes, including two (AQP1 and AQP4) in the ciliary body, the site of aqueous humor production. However, because humans with defective AQP1 are phenotypically normal and because the ocular application of phorbol esters reduce intraocular pressure, we postulated that the water channel activity of AQP4 may be regulated by these agents. We now report that protein kinase C activators, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate strongly stimulate the phosphorylation of AQP4 and inhibit its activity in a dose-dependent manner. Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (10 microM) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (10 nM) reduced the rate of AQP4-expressing oocyte swelling by 87 and 92%, respectively. Further, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate significantly increased the amount of phosphorylated AQP4. These results demonstrate that protein kinase C can regulate the activity of AQP4 through a mechanism involving protein phosphorylation. Moreover, they suggest important potential roles for AQP4 in several clinical disorders involving rapid water transport such as glaucoma, brain edema, and swelling of premature infant lungs."

https://openalex.org/W1998113157,"Apoptosis requires the activation of caspases (formerly interleukin 1β-converting enzyme-like proteases), in particular those related to the caspase-3/7/6 subfamily. Recent data, however, revealed that, although caspase-specific inhibitors delay apoptosis, they are often incapable of preventing it. To obtain evidence for caspase-independent steps of apoptosis, we artificially created a high amount of short-lived or aberrant proteins by blocking the ubiquitin degradation pathway. A temperature-sensitive defect in the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 induced apoptosis independent of the activation of caspase-3 and -6 and the cleavage of their respective substrates poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and lamin A. In addition, neither the caspase 3/7-specific inhibitor<i>N</i>-benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethylketone nor the general caspase inhibitor<i>N</i>-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone were capable of blocking this type of cell death. By contrast, Bcl-2 overexpression effectively protected cells from apoptosis induced by a defect in the E1 enzyme at the nonpermissive temperature. Bcl-2 acted downstream of the accumulation of short-lived or aberrant proteins because it did not prevent the overexpression of the short-lived proteins p53, p27 <sup>kip1</sup>, and cyclins D1 and B1 under conditions of decreased ubiquitination. These results suggest the existence of short-lived proteins that may serve the role of caspase-independent effectors of apoptosis and attractive targets of the death-protective action of Bcl-2."

Distinct adaptor protein (AP) complexes are important components of CCVs: they are thought to mediate CCV assembly by binding to the cytoplasmic tails of proteins containing endosomal sorting signals and subsequently recruiting clathrin (2Schmid S.L.

AP-1 positive CCVs are associated with the trans-Golgi network, whereas AP-2 positive CCVs are mostly found on the plasma membrane although other intracellular locations have been reported (4Seaman M.N.

However, no interaction between individual components of AP-1 or AP-2 and any of the leucine signals has been reported so far. The invariant chain (Ii) contains two independent leucine signals in its cytoplasmic tail that are responsible for directing the major histocompatibility class II-Ii complexes to the endocytic compartments (7Pieters J.

Goud B. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30318-30321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent phage display-based study from our laboratory 2Bremmes, T., Lauvrak, V., Lindqvist, B., and Bakke, O. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, in press. 2Bremmes, T., Lauvrak, V., Lindqvist, B., and Bakke, O. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, in press. has identified a short conserved sequence in the medium chains of the adaptor complexes that recognized a variety of tyrosine and leucine sorting signals, including both Ii signals. We therefore decided to test the ability of recombinant μ1 and μ2 to interact with the endosomal sorting signals from Ii. The QIAexpress Type IV kit, Qiaex II DNA purification kit, and monoclonal anti-His antibody were from Qiagen. Materials for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated to goat anti-mouse IgG were from Bio-Rad. The PVDF membrane and ECL reagents were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Medprobe (Norway). Dynabeads coated with streptavidin were from Dynal. Other reagents were from Sigma. Peptides containing the first leucine-based (LI) signal from Ii and its alanine mutant were synthesized at the Biotechnology Center of Oslo (Norway). Their sequences were M1 DDQRDLISNNEQL14K and M1DAARDAASNNEQL14K, respectively. Note that Asp3 and Gln4 residues shown to be a part of the sorting motif (11Motta A. Bremnes B. Morelli M.A.C.

Aliquots of these peptides were biotinylated (1:1 molar ratio of peptide and biotin) for use in binding assays. Biotinylated peptides containing the second (ML) signal and its mutant were kindly provided by Dr. G. Banting (University of Bristol, United Kingdom). Their sequences were biotin-N10NEQLPMLGRR20 and biotin-N10NEQLPAAGRR20, respectively (numbers are given according to the position of the residue in the p33 form of Ii). DNA coding for mouse μ1 and rat μ2 was kindly provided by Dr. T. Kirchhausen (Harvard Medical School). The full-length medium chains were cloned in frame into the type IV pQE30 vector (Qiagen) to express constructs containing a histidine (His) tag at their N termini. The oligonucleotides used for PCR amplification were 5′-TCCCGGGGATCCATGTCCGCCAGCGCCGTCTAC-3′ and 5′-TCTAGGCAAAGCTTTCACTGGGTCCGGACCTGATA-3′ for μ1 and 5′-GAGCTCGGTACCATGATCGGAGGCTTATTCATC-3′ and 5′-TCTAGGCAAAGCTTCTAGCAGCGGGTTTCGTAAAT-3′ for μ2. Amplified constructs were purified with Qiaex II kit (Qiagen) and cloned into BamHI and HinDIII (for μ1) or KpnI and HindIII (for μ2) sites of pQE30. Proteins were expressed in the bacterial strain M15[pREP4] (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Both proteins formed inclusion bodies, which were solubilized in 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride containing 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were purified in one step under denaturing conditions on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) according to specifications of the manufacturer. Purified proteins were diluted to a concentration of 10–20 μg/ml and refolded in the Binding buffer (0.1 m Tris, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH = 7.5). Prior to the binding assay, proteins were centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g(Airfuge) to remove the insoluble matter. His-tagged dihydrofolate reductase was expressed from the control plasmid pQE16 supplied with the kit and purified according to manufacturer's recommendations. Protein concentration was determined from Coomassie-stained gels by comparison with protein standards. Biotinylated peptides containing leucine signals were immobilized on Dynabeads coated with streptavidin (Dynal) overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. The amount of Dynabeads used for a single assay was 20 μl, which was sufficient to immobilize about 0.05 μg of a biotinylated peptide. The unbound peptide was washed out with copious amounts of Binding buffer, and Dynabeads were further blocked with 5% BSA in Binding buffer for 60 min at room temperature. His-tagged medium chains were added to the immobilized peptides typically at 1–2 μg/assay (unless specified otherwise) in a total volume of 450 μl of Binding buffer containing 1% BSA and incubated on a rotating wheel for 60 min at room temperature. The peptides immobilized on Dynabeads were gently washed three times on a magnet with 1 ml of Binding buffer. Bound medium chains were rescued with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a mini-trans-blot electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad) in 25 mm Tris, 192 mmglycine, 10% methanol. Membranes were blocked overnight with 5% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. Membranes were then incubated with anti-His IgG (1:5,000 dilution) for 60 min at room temperature, washed with 0.2% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline, and further incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:3,000 dilution) for 1 h. Bands were detected with ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using Kodak X-Omat AR film. Images were scanned using Adobe Photoshop software, and band intensities were quantified with the Gel-Pro Analyzer program. Different exposures of films were quantified to ensure the linearity of the signal. High contrast prints of the images are shown. His-tagged μ1 (1 μg) was incubated with different amounts of competing peptides in 400 μl of Binding buffer overnight at 4 °C. The mixtures were added to LI peptide immobilized on Dynabeads and incubated for 60 min at room temperature in the presence of 1% BSA. Subsequent steps were performed as described for the binding assay. We first examined the interactions between the two leucine signals from Ii and μ1. Equal amounts of peptides encoding the wild type and the mutant signal immobilized on Dynabeads were incubated with μ1. As shown in Fig. 1 A, μ1preferentially bound to the peptide containing the first signal (LI signal hereafter). Interactions between μ1 and the peptide-containing alanine mutant of LI signal were over 5-fold weaker as compared with the wild type peptide (Fig. 1 B). Similarly, we found that μ1 interacted with the peptide containing the second leucine signal (ML signal hereafter) over 4-fold stronger than with the peptide containing mutated ML signal (Fig. 1, C and D). To rule out the possibility that the observed interactions were dependent on the short histidine tag and not on μ1 sequence itself, we investigated interactions between the peptides containing LI and ML signals and His-tagged dihydrofolate reductase. No binding to either LI or ML signal was observed (data not shown). We then investigated the dependence of binding of μ1 to LI signal on the concentration of the medium chain. Equal amounts of the LI peptide immobilized on Dynabeads were incubated with the increasing amounts of μ1. As shown in Fig. 2, binding reached saturation at about 2 μg of μ1. To further demonstrate the specificity of interactions between μ1 and LI signal, we studied them in the presence of competing peptides. A fixed amount of μ1(1 μg/assay) was incubated overnight with various concentrations of either wild type or mutant LI peptide (0–1,200 molar excess of a peptide over the medium chain), and the ability of μ1 to bind to the wild type LI signal was then assayed. As shown in Fig. 3 (A and B), binding of μ1 to LI signal was strongly inhibited by the wild type LI peptide, whereas the inhibition by the mutant peptide was much less pronounced.Figure 3Binding of μ1 to LI signal from the invariant chain in the presence of competing peptides containing the wild type LI signal or its alanine mutant. A, bound μ1 was immobilized on PVDF membrane by Western transfer and detected as described under “Materials and Methods.”B, binding was quantified by densitometry.

Barsrepresent the S.D. from three independent experiments (for the wild type peptide) or the S.D. based on the entire population from two independent experiments (for the mutant peptide).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We also studied the interactions between the leucine signals from Ii and μ2. As shown in Fig. 3 (A and B), binding of μ2 to the mutated LI signal was significantly less than to the wild type signal. However, no interactions between μ2 and ML signal could be detected in our system, as both the wild type ML signal and its alanine mutant bound μ2 at the background levels (data not shown). In this study we demonstrated that the full-length medium chain of the AP-1 adaptor complex interacted with both leucine sorting signals from the invariant chain in an in vitro assay. We also demonstrated interactions between the LI signal from Ii and the full-length medium chain of the AP-2 adaptor complex. These interactions were specific as medium chains bound wild type signals with higher affinity than the mutated ones (Figs. 1 and4). We chose to substitute residues important for endocytosis with alanines in the control peptides for two reasons. First, according to structure predictions based on NMR studies, the exchange of the residues in question to alanines does not distort the structure of the cytoplasmic tail of the invariant chain 3A. Motta, personal communications. and second, substitution of the residues in question for alanines led to inactivation of the sorting signals in vivo (7Pieters J. Bakke O. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 831-846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Bremnes B. Madsen T. Gedde-Dahl M. Bakke O. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2021-2032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Odorizzi C.G.

Bakke O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27165-27171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We also showed that binding of μ1 to the LI sorting signal from the invariant chain was saturable (Fig. 2). Finally, specificity of the interactions between μ1 and the LI sorting signal was confirmed using competition assay. Binding of μ1 to the LI signal was 75% inhibited in the presence of the 1,200 molar excess of the wild type peptide encoding LI signal over the medium chain (Fig. 3), whereas only 25% inhibition was observed with the same amount of the mutant peptide. A high excess of free peptide necessary to prevent the medium chain from binding to the immobilized peptide is probably due to the fact that only a minor fraction of the free peptide has the proper conformation for binding medium chains in the solution. Others have also found that a molar excess of 1,000–15,000 of a free peptide was required to inhibit binding of AP-1 and AP-2 complexes to various sorting signals (e.g. Refs. 13Sosa M.A. Schmidt B. von Figura K.

Interactions between AP-1 and AP-2 complexes and both leucine and tyrosine sorting signals have been well documented (Ref. 2Schmid S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 511-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar and references therein and Refs. 15Höning S. Griffith J. Geuze H.J. Hunziker W.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that interactions between tyrosine signals and AP-2 could be improved by the addition of phosphoinositides that are phosphorylated at the D-3 position of the inositol ring or when AP-2 was in the clathrin coat (18Rapoport I. Miyazaki M. Boll W. Duckworth B. Cantley L.C. Shoelson S. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2240-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Medium chains of AP-1 and AP-2 were shown to recognize a variety of tyrosine-based sorting signals in yeast two-hybrid system and in a number of in vitro assays (19Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.C.

Chem. 1997; 272: 27160-27166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and this recognition is believed to be the basis for interactions between the tyrosine signals and AP complexes although interactions between the β-chain of AP-2 and a signal from asialoglycoprotein receptor have also been reported (24Beltzer J.P. Spiess M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3735-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the leucine signal from CD3γ failed to interact with the medium chains in the two-hybrid system (19Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar), leading to an opinion that leucine signals might be recognized by a different AP subunit. However, a recent phage-display study2 has identified a sequence from the medium chains that was able to recognize a number of leucine-based signals. It is important to notice that this sequence was missing from some of constructs used in other studies (19Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar, 20Ohno H. Fournier M.C. Poy G. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 27160-27166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) that were still able to bind tyrosine signals. One could therefore hypothesize that the medium chains contain at least two sites that are able to interact with different endosomal sorting signals. The results presented here are mainly in line with those of Bremneset al., 2 but in contrast to the phage-display studies our approach did not demonstrate interactions between μ2 and ML signal. At present we are not able to explain this difference, but in the cell both LI and ML signals are independently involved in the internalization from the plasma membrane (8Bremnes B. Madsen T. Gedde-Dahl M. Bakke O. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2021-2032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this might indicate that the AP-2 complexes interact with both signals in vivo. Such interactions may require additional residues around ML signal that were not present on the peptide used in our experiments. We are also aware of possible pitfalls associated with extrapolation of in vitro results to an in vivosituation as other subunits of AP complexes may be involved in the recognition of endosomal sorting signals either directly or indirectly by influencing the conformation of medium chains in the complex or the degree of their exposure to the cytoplasm. Nevertheless, studies of potential interactions between individual chains of AP complexes and sorting signals is an essential first step in understanding the detailed mechanism of how sorting signals are recognized. We thank Dr. T. Kirchhausen for the medium chain DNA constructs and Dr. G. Banting for the peptides. We also thank Dr. A. Motta for sharing the structural information and T. Nordeng for critical reading of the manuscript."

Several binding partners of Bcl-2 and Bax have been isolated, but none of them has yet provided clues as to exactly how Bcl-2 and Bax work. According to one view, Bcl-2 and Bax interact with survival and death effector molecules, respectively, and neutralize each other through heterodimerization. Alternatively, Bcl-2 requires Bax for death protection, and additional proteins bind to the heterodimer to regulate its activity. Here we used a co-immunoprecipitation strategy to distinguish between these two possibilities. We show that the Bcl-2-Bax heterodimer is maintained, and no other protein associates stably in detectable amounts with Bcl-2, Bax, or the heterodimer in anti-Bcl-2 and anti-Bax immunoprecipitates from normal cells and cells exposed to apoptotic stimuli. Analysis of cells expressing various levels of Bcl-2 and Bax, however, revealed that the degree of protection against apoptosis does not correlate with the number of Bcl-2-Bax heterodimers but the amount of Bcl-2 that is free of Bax. In addition, the survival activity of Bcl-2 is unaffected when Bax expression is ablated by an antisense strategy. Our findings suggest that the Bcl-2-Bax heterodimer is a negative regulator of death protection, and that Bcl-2 requires neither Bax nor major, stable interactions with other cellular proteins to exert its survival function. We therefore propose that Bcl-2 acts as an enzyme (capturing substrates in a transient way), as a homodi- or multimer, or through the interaction with non-proteaceous targets (lipids, ions).

Bcl-2 is an oncogene product originally isolated from human follicular lymphomas harboring a t(14;18) chromosomal translocation (1Cleary M.L. Smith S.D. Sklar J. Cell. 1986; 47: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). Compared with other transforming genes it has the unusual property of increasing cell numbers by preventing programmed cell death (apoptosis) rather than stimulating cell multiplication (2Reed J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2386) Google Scholar). The death-protective activity of wild-type Bcl-2 seems to be proportional to its expression level (3Yin D.X. Schimke R.T. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4922-4928PubMed Google Scholar). No natural activating mutant of Bcl-2 has yet been found in normal or transformed cells. Thus, to study the molecular action of Bcl-2, the protein has been overexpressed in many mammalian cells and shown to counteract programmed cell death induced by various stimuli (2Reed J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2386) Google Scholar). Both endogenous and exogenous Bcl-2 are anchored via their carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic tails to the outer membranes of mitochondria, nuclei, and the endoplasmic reticulum with the bulk of the protein facing the cytoplasm (4Nguyen M.

Both proteins were shown to contribute to nuclear fragmentation and apoptosis via the activation of cytoplasmic caspases.To understand better the molecular function of Bcl-2, it is necessary to identify the molecules with which Bcl-2 interacts. So far, such molecules have been searched only under non-apoptotic situations. Using interaction cloning, yeast two-hybrid and recombinant baculovirus systems, various Bcl-2-binding proteins have been discovered. Among them are R-Ras, a Ras-related protein implicated in cell adhesion and apoptosis (31Fernandez-Sarabia M.J. Bischoff J.R.

Although all of these proteins could be forced to interact with Bcl-2 when mixed in recombinant forms in vitro or co-overexpressed at high levels in intact cells, there has been no conclusive evidence that they are partners and/or regulators of Bcl-2 under physiological concentrations/conditions. We have shown recently that, in contrast to previous reports (34Wang H.-G. Miyashita T. Takayama S. Sato T. Torigoe T. Krajewski S. Tanaka S. Hovey L. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C.

Otter I. Monney L. Wartmann M. Borner C. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Moreover, using various approaches to down-regulate Raf activity, we demonstrated that Bcl-2 does not use a Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway to confer cell survival (44Olivier R. Otter I. Monney L. Wartmann M. Borner C. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Bcl-2 belongs to a family of related proteins. Whereas some members such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Bfl-1, Mcl-1, A1, and BHRF act as death repressors (anti-apoptotic subfamily) (45Gibson L. Holmgreen S.P. Huang D.C.S. Bernard O. Copeland N.G.

Selective pairs of anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic proteins, such as for example Bcl-2 and Bax, dimerize via highly homologous regions (BH 1The abbreviations used are: BH, Bcl-2 homology; DTT, dithiothreitol; BFA, brefeldin A; ECL, enhanced chemiluminescence; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; Ab, antibody; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: BH, Bcl-2 homology; DTT, dithiothreitol; BFA, brefeldin A; ECL, enhanced chemiluminescence; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; Ab, antibody; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. regions) present in all family members (49Oltvai Z.N.

The same BH regions are also required for the anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic activities of Bcl-2 and Bax, respectively, as if survival/death activity and heterodimerization capacity were non-separable functions (51Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 356: 768-774Google Scholar, 52Sedlak T.W. Oltvai Z.N. Yang E. Wang K. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5589-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). These findings suggest two models for the regulation of apoptosis by Bcl-2 and Bax. (i) Bcl-2 binds unknown factors crucial for its survival activity via the BH1/BH2 regions, and Bax binds unknown factors crucial for its killing activity via the BH3 region. The Bcl-2-Bax heterodimer disrupts these interactions and serves a negative regulatory role for both Bcl-2 and Bax. (ii) Alternatively, the Bcl-2-Bax heterodimer is the active component for death protection (in analogy to the Myc-Max complex that stimulates transcription; see Ref. 55Amati B. Brooks M.W. Levy N. Littlewood T.D. Evan G.I. Land H. Cell. 1993; 72: 233-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), and additional proteins bind to it to regulate its survival function.To distinguish between the two possibilities, we embarked on a co-immunoprecipitation strategy to detect the proteins that bind to Bcl-2, Bax, or the heterodimer in response to various apoptotic stresses. We show that Bcl-2 and Bax co-localize in intact cells and are firm partners during four different apoptotic stresses. However, no additional proteins associate stably in significant amounts with Bcl-2, Bax, or the heterodimer under these conditions.DISCUSSIONTo our knowledge this is the first study describing the binding properties, subcellular localizations, and biological activities of Bcl-2 and Bax in cells exposed to apoptotic stimuli. It shows that (i) Bcl-2 and Bax co-localize to the same subcellular compartment and form strong, equimolar heterodimers under both normal and apoptotic conditions; (ii) the protection against apoptosis does not necessitate Bax expression and correlates with the amount of the Bcl-2 protein that is free of Bax; and (iii) no other cellular protein associates stably with Bcl-2, Bax, or the Bcl-2-Bax heterodimer in anti-Bcl-2 or anti-Bax immunoprecipitates.The conditions used for cell fractionations and immunoprecipitations were as physiological as possible (143 mm KCl, pH 7.5). However, because both Bcl-2 and Bax are integral membrane proteins they had to be solubilized in 0.2% Nonidet P-40. Although such a treatment might disrupt protein-protein interactions, several membrane complexes including Bcl-2-Bax have been isolated previously in the presence of 0.2–1% non-ionic detergent (50Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5838) Google Scholar, 56Wang H.-G. Takayama S. Rapp U. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7063-7068Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported recently that non-ionic detergents promoted rather than disrupted dimerizations among members of the Bcl-2 family (59Hsu Y.-T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13829-13834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Disruption of the Bcl-2-Bax complex, however, occurred when 0.5% deoxycholate and/or 0.1% SDS (RIPA buffer conditions) were added, suggesting an intermediate binding affinity between the two proteins (Ref. 50Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5838) Google Scholar and data not shown). Since we did not detect any Bcl-2-binding protein under the stringent RIPA buffer conditions, no cellular protein seems to bind stronger to Bcl-2 than Bax and vice versa.There was no obvious reason why proteins with an affinity similar to Bax would not have been co-immunoprecipitated with anti-Bcl-2 antibodies, especially in cells where a high amount of the Bcl-2 protein was accessible, i.e. free of Bax (R6-Bcl-2#9). Interference by the antibodies used was considered minimal as both the anti-Bcl-2 antibody 27-6 and the anti-Flag antibody detect epitopes outside of the BH1–4 domains essential for the survival activity of Bcl-2 (26Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.-L. Ng S.-C. Fesik S.W.

In addition, we have reported recently that Bax was the only cellular protein that was specifically retained by a GST-Bcl-2 affinity column incubated with radiolabeled extracts from non-stressed or apoptotically stressed cells, although this method was antibody-independent (44Olivier R. Otter I. Monney L. Wartmann M. Borner C. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Compared with other binding techniques (yeast two-hybrid, interaction cloning) co-immunoprecipitation is the method of choice if one wants to study protein-protein interactions that may only occur in response to cellular treatments with apoptotic stimuli. However, the following disadvantages should be considered. First, proteins that bind transiently or with low affinities are difficult to co-immmunoprecipitate. Although we tried to optimize buffer conditions for extraction and/or immunoprecipitation, complexes of Bcl-2 or Bax with other cellular proteins may not have been maintained after cell disruption. To overcome this problem we lysed cells by repeated freeze-thawing cycles and added the bifunctional cross-linker dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) to the extract before solubilization in detergent. However, even under these conditions no additional Bcl-2-binding proteins were found (data not shown). Second, the binding between Bcl-2 and its partners may depend on post-translational modifications. It has been reported previously that the binding of Bcl-2 to c-Raf-1 and/or Ras is phosphorylation-sensitive (35Blagosklonny M.V. Schulte T. Nguyen P. Trepel J. Neckers L.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1851-1854PubMed Google Scholar, 60Chen C.-Y. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2376-2379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Moreover, Bax was shown to form disulfide-linked dimers in response to chemotherapeutic drugs (58Thomas A. El Rouby S. Reed J.C. Krajewski S. Silber R. Potmesil M. Newcomb E.W. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1055-1062PubMed Google Scholar). However, the absence or presence of phosphatase inhibitors or DTT had only a minor effect on the protein pattern in our immunoprecipitates, and no disulfide-linked Bax homodimers were found. Third, the binding partners of Bcl-2 and/or Bax may not be sufficiently abundant to be detected by immunoprecipitations because they exhibit a high turnover rate. We have recently obtained evidence for the involvement of short lived proteins in apoptosis induced by decreased ubiquitination (61Monney L. Otter I. Olivier R. Ozer H.L. Haas A.L. Omura S. Borner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6121-6131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Fourth, the binding proteins may not contain enough methionine and/or cysteine residues to be radiolabeled and detected on autoradiographs after immunoprecipitation (for example, heat shock protein 27; Ref. 62Hickey E. Brandon S.E. Potter R. Stein G. Stein J. Weber L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4127-4129Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). This issue is currently being addressed by labeling cellular proteins with other amino acids or detecting them in immunoprecipitates by silver staining.It was surprising that none of the previously reported Bcl-2-binding proteins was detected in our anti-Bcl-2 immunoprecipitates (31Fernandez-Sarabia M.J.

Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). Such effects have been, for the most part, attributed to the release of NO or related reactive nitrogen oxide species. However, biochemical mechanism(s) leading to the dissociation of S–NO bond under in vivo conditions are at this time largely unknown. Under in vitro conditions, RSNOs are reasonably stable (over a period of several hours) in physiological buffers in the presence of a chelator of transition metals. The breakdown of S–NO bond can be induced by UV light (4Stamler J.S. Jaraki O. Osborne J. Simon D.I. Keaney J. Vita J. Singel D. Valeri C.R. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7674-7677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar) and certain metal ions such as Hg2+ or Cu+ (5Saville B. Analyst. 1958; 83: 670-672Crossref Google Scholar, 6Askew S.C. Barnett D.J. McAninly J. Williams D.L.H. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1995; 2: 741-745Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar); however, neither of these reactivities can be considered to be of physiological importance. Additional reactivities of RSNOs which may be operative under in vivo conditions include thiol- and glutathione peroxidase-mediated decomposition, respectively (7Pietraforte D. Mallozzi C. Scorza G. Minetti M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7177-7185Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 8Hou Y. Guo Z. Li J. Wang P.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Available evidence suggests that thiol-mediated degradation of RSNOs results in the formation of nitroxyl anion rather than NO (9Hogg N. Singh R.J. Kalyanaraman B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), whereas the reaction between RSNOs and glutathione peroxidase causes the deactivation of the enzyme due to the modification of selenocysteine residue at its active center (10Asahi M. Fujii J. Suzuki K. Seo H.G. Kuzuya T. Hori M. Tada M. Fujii S. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21035-21039Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In this report, we present the evidence that RSNOs formed by low molecular weight biological thiols (l-cysteine and glutathione) are degraded in the presence of superoxide. Since the propensity for the generation of superoxide under aerobic conditions is a ubiquitous property of biological systems, the interaction of superoxide with RSNOs is likely to represent a biological route of RSNO catabolism which is not confined to specific tissues or organs. Furthermore, relatively slow rates of superoxide-mediated decomposition of RSNOs indicate that this process may be of physiological importance in mediation of more prolonged, tonic effects of RSNOs exerted simultaneously by the modification of fluxes of oxygen-derived free radicals and by reactive nitrogen oxide species released by the decomposition of S–NO bond. Ammonium sulfamate, catalase,l-cysteine, diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA), reduced glutathione, N-ethylmaleimide, nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT), superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn form), xanthine, xanthine oxidase (XO, specific activity 0.11 unit/mg of protein at pH 7.5), and sulfanilamide were purchased from Sigma. Dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR) was a product of Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and obtained from standard vendors. The solutions were prepared in deionized, ultrafiltered water with resistance >18 megohms. Spectrophotometric measurements were carried out using a Hitachi U-2000 UV/VIS spectrophotometer. Fluorometric analysis was performed on a Perkin-Elmer Fluorescent Spectrophotometer, model 204-A. Stock solutions of S-nitrosocysteine (CYSNO) and S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) were prepared fresh for each experiment by incubating 10 mm thiol with 10 mmNaNO2 in 20 mm HCl, 1 mm DTPA for 15 min at room temperature in the dark followed by the addition of 1 mm ammonium sulfamate to remove unreacted nitrite. The concentration of RSNOs was determined from the absorbance at 336 nm (molar absorptivity 900 m−1cm−1). Working solutions were prepared by dilution of stock solutions into 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (KPB), 1 mm DTPA, pH 7.8. The incubations were carried out at 25 °C in the absence of light in media containing 50 mm KPB, 1 mm DTPA, pH 7.8, 200 μm xanthine and concentrations of RSNOs as described in the text in a final volume of 0.5 ml. The reaction was initiated by the addition of XO (approximately 6–50 μg of protein/ml) to obtain the desired rates of superoxide production (see below). At the end of incubation period, the aliquots of reaction mixtures (0.1–0.5 ml) were diluted into 1 ml of Griess reagent (Ref. 11Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10881) Google Scholar; final volume 1.5 ml) followed by the analysis of nitrite/RSNO content by Saville method (5Saville B. Analyst. 1958; 83: 670-672Crossref Google Scholar). Samples were incubated for 10 min at room temperature in the dark followed by photometric reading at 545 nm for the determination of nitrite content. The samples were then reacted with 20 μl of 20 mm HgCl2 and the second photometric reading was taken either after 10 (CYSNO) or 15 min (GSNO) incubation. Different incubation times reflect the different sensitivities of S–NO bonds of respective RSNOs to mercuric salt in the presence of DTPA. RSNO concentration was determined from HgCl2-induced increment in photometric signal using molar absorption coefficient of 50,000m−1 cm−1. Control samples were processed identically except for the absence of XO. No significant degradation of RSNOs was observed in control samples at reaction times used in the study. For simultaneous analysis of nitrite/RSNO and nitrate, the incubations were carried out in a final volume of 2 ml. The determination of nitrate utilized the Cd-mediated reduction to nitrite (12Boltz D.F. Taras M.J. Boltz D.F. Howell J.A. Colorimetric Determination of Non-Metals. John Wiley & Sons, New York1974: 197-251Google Scholar) followed by detection in Griess assay. Reliable determination of nitrate in reaction mixtures containing xanthine/XO required the removal of hydrogen peroxide to prevent an additional formation of nitrate resulting from the decomposition of residual amounts of RSNOs in the course of analysis. Hydrogen peroxide was removed by the incubation of samples for 10 min with 0.5 mm2-mercaptoethanol followed by the addition of 2.5 mm N-ethylmaleimide to eliminate the unreacted thiol. Decomposition of RSNOs was carried out by the addition of 0.2 mm HgCl2 to the samples supplemented by 200 mm HCl, 100 μm ammonium sulfamate. Under such conditions, the nitrosonium equivalent of RSNOs was converted quantitatively (>99%) to nitrogen (13Park J.K.J. Kostka P. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 249: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The rate of superoxide-mediated reduction of NBT in competition experiments with CYSNO and GSNO was measured by continuous monitoring of absorbance at 560 nm (molar absorptivity 15,000 m−1cm−1) in a media containing 50 mm KPB, 1 mm DTPA, pH 7.8, 50 μm xanthine, 56 μm NBT and various concentrations of RSNOs in a final volume of 1 ml. The reaction was initiated by addition of XO (25–40 μg of protein/ml) to yield the rate of absorbance change in the absence of RSNO between 0.015 and 0.025 units/min. The measurements proceeded for 5 min and the reaction rate was determined from the change of absorbance between 60 and 300 s to allow for the equilibration of superoxide concentration during the first minute after the addition of XO. The determination of the rates of superoxide generation in experiments on superoxide-mediated degradation of RSNOs was conducted similarly except for the adjustment of reaction times as mandated by the protocols of RSNO degradation and the increase in xanthine concentration to 200 μm to prevent substrate depletion in assays employing longer incubation times. Under such conditions, the activity of XO represented approximately 80% of that seen with 50 μm xanthine due to the susceptibility of the enzyme to substrate inhibition (16Fridovich I. Greenwald R.A. Handbook of Methods for Oxygen Radical Research. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1985: 51-53Google Scholar). Superoxide flux was calculated based on the stoichiometry of 2 mol of superoxide/1 mol of monoformazan (17Bielski B.H.J. Shlue G.G. Bajuk S. J. Phys. Chem. 1980; 84: 830-833Crossref Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The rates of superoxide production detected in NBT reduction assay corresponded to the rates of urate formation within the margin of error <15%. Formation of urate in the reaction between xanthine and XO was determined in 50 mm KPB, 1 mm DTPA, pH 7.8 (final volume 1 ml) by continuous monitoring of absorbance at 295 nm (molar absorptivity 11,000m−1 cm−1; Ref. 16Fridovich I. Greenwald R.A. Handbook of Methods for Oxygen Radical Research. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1985: 51-53Google Scholar). Oxidation of DHR was monitored by measuring the fluorescent intensity of rhodamine 123 (excitation/emission wavelengths 500 and 530 nm, respectively; Ref. 18Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar) in media containing 50 mm KPB, 1 mm DTPA, pH 7.8, 200 μm xanthine, XO (40–45 μg of protein/ml), 50 μm DHR, and 100–150 μm RSNO in a final volume of 2.5 ml. Stock solution of DHR was prepared in dimethyl formamide as described previously (19Miles A.M. Bohle D.S. Glassbrenner P.A. Hansert B. Wink D.A. Grisham M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 40-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Unless indicated otherwise, data are presented as mean ± S.E. of measurement with the number of experiments indicated in parentheses. Significance of effects was determined by analysis of variance with post-hoc Scheffe's test. Incubation of either CYSNO or GSNO in reaction mixtures consisting of 50 mm KPB, 1 mm DTPA, pH 7.8, 200 μm xanthine and different concentrations of XO resulted in a degradation of RSNOs which was more pronounced at higher rates of superoxide production (Fig. 1). These observations indicate that the rate of RSNO degradation was proportional to the concentration of superoxide in reaction mixtures, the latter being related to the magnitude of superoxide flux and to the rates of superoxide degradation either by spontaneous dismutation or in reaction with RSNO. No significant degradation of RSNOs was observed when the reaction mixtures were supplemented with SOD (5 units/ml) or when the incubations were carried out in the absence of XO. The rate of formation of uric acid by xanthine/XO under similar reaction conditions was unaffected by up to 500 μm CYSNO or GSNO (not shown). Inclusion of catalase at concentrations up to 1 unit/ml failed to elicit a significant change in the rate of superoxide-mediated decomposition of either RSNO; higher concentrations of the enzyme caused a partial inhibition. Such an inhibition could be attributed to the reduction in superoxide flux (most likely due to the contamination of catalase by superoxide dismutase) as indicated by the findings that the presence of catalase at concentrations >1 unit/ml inhibited the superoxide-mediated reduction of NBT (Fig. 2). These observations are consistent with the notion that the degradation of RSNOs observed in the presence of xanthine/XO resulted from the reaction of RSNOs with superoxide as opposed to the reaction with the species formed in the course of its further catabolism (hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals). Additional support for such a contention is provided by findings that hydrogen peroxide (up to 1 mm) did not promote the degradation of RSNOs (20Naseem K.M. Chirico S. Mohammadi B. Bruckdorfer K.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 759-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). 2S. Aleryani and P. Kostka, unpublished observations. Superoxide-mediated decomposition of RSNOs was accompanied by the accumulation of nitrite and nitrate in reaction mixtures. Quantitatively, the sum of concentrations of nitrite and nitrate represented >90% of nitrosonium equivalent of RSNOs degraded during the incubation. The proportion of nitrite in reaction mixtures (34–38% of total nitrite/nitrate content) was found to be remarkably stable for either CYSNO or GSNO, irrespective of the initial RSNO concentration, magnitude of superoxide flux, and presence or absence of catalase. Time course of the reaction of superoxide with RSNOs at constant, non-limiting rates of superoxide production (5–10-fold excess relatively to the rates of RSNO degradation) is illustrated in Fig. 3 A. Under such conditions, the actual concentrations of superoxide are determined primarily by the rate of spontaneous dismutation and can be anticipated to be relatively constant over the time period of the assay. 3The relative proportion of superoxide consumed in the reaction with RSNO (vRSNO) in relation to the overall flux at steady state (V =v RSNO + v dism) can be expressed by the relationship (21Kuthan H. Ullrich V. Estabrook R.W. Biochem. J. 1982; 203: 551-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), v RSNO/V =k RSNO[RSNO] n[O·̄2]/{k RSNO[RSNO] n[O·̄2] +k dism[O·̄2]2}, wherev dism represents the rate of spontaneous dismutation. Under conditions whenk RSNO[RSNO] n[O·̄2] ≪ k dism[O·̄2]2, the contribution of RSNO degradation to the overall rate of superoxide catabolism can be regarded as being negligible and the relationship will be simplified to v RSNO=k′RSNO[RSNO] n, wherek′RSNO =k RSNO[O·̄2] and n is the reaction order in respect to RSNO. The model assumes first order kinetics in respect to superoxide as supported by the findings showing a lack of direct effect of catalase on the reaction rate. Plot of the natural logarithms of residual RSNO concentrations at different time intervals of incubation followed straight lines for either CYSNO or GSNO (Fig. 3 B), indicating that under such conditions the reaction obeys a pseudo-first order kinetics with respect to RSNO concentrations. Such a kinetics would imply a bimolecular reaction between superoxide and RSNOs governed by the rate equation, v = k [O·̄2][RSNO]. The determination of rate constants for such a reaction by conventional methods of kinetic analysis is hampered by uncertainty about the actual concentrations of superoxide in reaction mixtures. An alternative approach undertaken in this study consisted of the examination of relative rates of NBT reduction at different concentrations of RSNOs (22Bors W. Michel C. Saran M. Greenwald R.A. Handbook of Methods for Oxygen Radical Research. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1985: 181-188Google Scholar, 23Takabe T. Asami S. Akazawa T. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3985-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Bimolecular reaction between superoxide and RSNOs would predict a linear relationship between the reciprocal values of relative rates of NBT reduction in the presence of RSNOs and the ratios of concentrations of RSNOs to NBT, with the slope equal to the ratio of rate constants, V/v=1+kRSNO[RSNO]/kNBT[NBT]Equation 1 where V and v are the rates of NBT reduction in the absence and presence of RSNO, and k RSNO, k NBT are second order rate constants of superoxide-mediated RSNO decomposition and NBT reduction, respectively. Experimental data were found to be consistent with such a kinetic model (Fig. 4). Usingk NBT of 6 × 104m−1 s−1 (16Fridovich I. Greenwald R.A. Handbook of Methods for Oxygen Radical Research. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1985: 51-53Google Scholar), the values of k RSNO determined from the competition experiments were (7.69 ± 0.64) × 104m−1 s−1 (CYSNO, n= 4) and (1.28 ± 0.05) × 104m−1 s−1 (GSNO, n= 4), respectively. Table I shows the magnitude of superoxide-mediated decomposition of RSNOs when the reactions were carried out at non-limiting concentrations of RSNOs (initial concentrations approximately 100 μm). The values of k CYSNO and k GSNO would predict that under such conditions the rate of spontaneous dismutation of superoxide at fluxes used in this study would be quantitatively insignificant (second order rate constant for spontaneous dismutation at pH 7.8 is approximately 79,000 m−1s−1, Ref. 24Bielski B.H.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1978; 28: 645-649Crossref Scopus (440) Google Scholar), with near-quantitative consumption of superoxide in reaction with RSNOs. As illustrated by data in Table I, the magnitude of superoxide-mediated degradation at high initial concentrations of RSNOs was not significantly different between GSNO and CYSNO. The ratios between the concentrations of RSNOs consumed in the reaction and the superoxide flux were found to be significantly different from 1 (p < 0.01) while non-significantly different from 0.5 (p > 0.2) and remained unchanged by further increase in the initial RSNO concentrations (not shown). Such ratios are consistent with the stoichiometric requirement of consumption of 2 mol of superoxide in reaction with 1 mol of RSNO.Table IDegradation of CYSNO and GSNO at rate-limiting flux of superoxideCYSNOGSNORSNO (μm) −XO107.6 ± 0.9 (4)104.3 ± 0.5 (4) +XO101.3 ± 0.7 (4)98.5 ± 0.5 (4)ΔRSNO (μm)6.3 ± 1.15.8 ± 0.7O·̄2 flux (μm/15 min)12.5412.54ΔRSNO/O·̄2flux0.50 ± 0.090.46 ± 0.06 Open table in a new tab The implications of 2:1 stoichiometry for the reaction mechanism of superoxide-mediated decomposition of RSNOs are at this time unknown and await further investigations. One of the possible mechanisms may involve the initial formation of NO by superoxide-mediated breakdown of S–NO bond. Since NO reacts with superoxide at nearly diffusion limited rate (25Huie R.E. Padmaja S. Free Rad. Res. Commun. 1993; 18: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (2028) Google Scholar), such a mechanism would lead to the consumption of 2 molecules of superoxide and result in the formation of peroxynitrite as a principal metabolite of nitrosonium equivalent of RSNO. Indirect support for such a mechanism is provided by findings that nitrate is a predominant end-product of nitrosonium moiety of RSNOs (see above). The main pathways leading to the formation of nitrate under our experimental conditions may include either the hydrogen peroxide-mediated oxidation of nitrosonium ion (or related species with reactivities similar to those of acidified nitrite) or the decomposition of peroxynitrite (26Pryor W.A. Squadrito G.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L699-L722PubMed Google Scholar). The participation of the former pathway of nitrate production is unlikely since the experimental manipulations which suppressed the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (presence of catalase, increased initial concentrations of RSNOs) failed to influence the nitrate/nitrite ratios. In this context, it may be of interest to note that the relative proportion of nitrate in reaction mixtures observed in this study (62–66%) was nearly identical to that observed by Ischiropoulos et al. (27Ischiropoulos H. Zhu L. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar) in the study of peroxynitrite formation by activated macrophages. The potential formation of peroxynitrite in the reaction of superoxide with RSNOs was evaluated by monitoring the oxidation of DHR in the course of incubation of RSNOs with xanthine/XO. It has been shown previously that the oxidation of DHR requires the presence of a strong oxidant such as hydroxyl radicals, whereas superoxide or hydrogen peroxide alone were ineffective in oxidizing this compound (18Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 19Miles A.M. Bohle D.S. Glassbrenner P.A. Hansert B. Wink D.A. Grisham M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 40-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Recently, Miles et al. (19Miles A.M. Bohle D.S. Glassbrenner P.A. Hansert B. Wink D.A. Grisham M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 40-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) have reported that DHR could be oxidized by the product formed during the spontaneous decomposition of spermine/NO adduct in the presence of superoxide. Such a product was presumed to be peroxynitrite. We have observed a similar oxidation of DHR during superoxide-mediated decomposition of RSNOs. The results obtained with CYSNO are illustrated in Fig. 5. Incubation of CYSNO in the presence of XO caused a time-dependent increase in the fluorescent signal of rhodamine 123 in the reaction mixtures supplemented with 50 μm DHR and 1 unit/ml of catalase. The formation of rhodamine 123 in the absence of RSNO was reduced to approximately 10–15% of that seen in the presence of CYSNO and was likely related to the generation of hydroxyl radicals in the xanthine/XO system. No appreciable formation of rhodamine 123 was observed when XO was omitted from the reaction mixtures. In conclusion, the findings of this study provide evidence for the involvement of superoxide in the metabolism of CYSNO and GSNO. The findings are particularly relevant to the studies of physiological and pharmacological effects of RSNOs as the relative contributions of different routes of RSNO degradation with ensuing generation of reactive nitrogen oxide species in biological systems will be influenced by the fluxes of oxygen-derived free radicals. At the same time, the biological responses elicited by RSNOs will be related in part to the alterations in the metabolic effects exerted by superoxide and related free radical species formed in the course of its catabolism.

https://openalex.org/W2059794050,"The transfer RNA (tRNA) multigene family comprises 20 amino acid-accepting groups, many of which contain isoacceptors. The addition of isoacceptors to the tRNA repertoire was critical to establishing the genetic code, yet the origin of isoacceptors remains largely unexplored. A model of tRNA evolution, termed ""tRNA gene recruitment,"" was formulated. It proposes that a tRNA gene can be recruited from one isoaccepting group to another by a point mutation that concurrently changes tRNA amino acid identity and messenger RNA coupling capacity. A test of the model showed that an Escherichia coli strain, in which the essential tRNAUGUThr gene was inactivated, was rendered viable when a tRNAArg with a point mutation that changed its anticodon from UCU to UGU (threonine) was expressed. Insertion of threonine at threonine codons by the ""recruited"" tRNAArg was corroborated by in vitro aminoacylation assays showing that its specificity had been changed from arginine to threonine. Therefore, the recruitment model may account for the evolution of some tRNA genes."

Arterial SMC of the chick ascending and thoracic aorta are of a neural crest origin (14Topouzis S. Majesky M.W. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 430-445Crossref Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 15Le Douarin N.M.

Morphol. 1975; 34: 125-154PubMed Google Scholar), and various members of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily can instructively promote differentiation of primary cultured neural crest cells into neuronal cells or SMC (12Shah N.M. Groves A.K. Anderson D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 331-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, our ability to work with neural crest cells in primary culture has been limited by the difficulty of obtaining quantities sufficient for biochemical and genetic analysis. This problem was solved recently by the generation of an immortalized neural crest cell line, Monc-1, by retroviral transfection of mouse neural crest cells with the v-myc gene (17Sommer L. Shah N. Rao M. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1245-1258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 18Rao M.S. Anderson D.J. J. Neurobiol. 1997; 32: 722-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that Monc-1 cells could be used to develop an in vitro SMC differentiation system. We describe in this report the culture conditions under which Monc-1 cells can be differentiated efficiently into SMC. Exclusive Monc-1 to SMC differentiation was indicated by cellular appearance and induction of the SMC markers smooth muscle α-actin, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, calponin, SM22α, and APEG-1. Also, a 20–30-fold increase in the activity of the SMC-specific promoter SM22α coincided with the formation of new DNA-protein complexes during differentiation. The Monc-1 cell line was kindly provided by David Anderson (Pasadena, CA). Monc-1 cells were cultured in the undifferentiated state on fibronectin-coated plates in an L-15 CO2-based medium supplemented with chick embryo extract, hereafter referred to as complete medium, as described by Stemple and Anderson (11Stemple D.L. Anderson D.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 973-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Differentiation down the neuronal and glial pathways was performed on plates coated sequentially with poly-d-lysine (0.5 mg/ml) and fibronectin (0.25 mg/ml) in complete medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) plus 5 mm forskolin (Sigma) as described (17Sommer L. Shah N. Rao M. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1245-1258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). SMC differentiation was induced by application of M199 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), hereafter referred to as SMC differentiation medium (SMDM). Total RNA from cultured cells was prepared by guanidinium isothiocyanate extraction and centrifugation through cesium chloride (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). RNA from mouse aorta was prepared by the RNAzol B method (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was fractionated on a 1.3% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to nitrocellulose filters, which were hybridized with the appropriate, randomly primed,32P-labeled probe (19Sambrook J.

Lessard (Cincinnati, OH); the angiotensin type II receptor (AT2) cDNA was provided by A. D. Strosberg (Paris, France). The calponin cDNA was isolated from a mouse aortic cDNA library. mRNAs for the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain isoforms SM1 and SM2 were detected by reverse transcription PCR with primers designed from the mouse SM1 and SM2 cDNAs (GenBank™ accession numbers D85923 andD85924, respectively). The forward primer 5′ AGGAAACACCAAGGTCAAGCA 3′ and the reverse primer 5′ GGGACTGTACCACAGGTTAG 3′ were used to amplify a 324-base pair SM1 fragment and a 363-base pair (alternatively spliced) SM2 fragment. To control for efficiency of reverse transcription, an aliquot of template cDNA was analyzed by PCR with a forward primer (5′ TGAAGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATTTGGC 3′) and a reverse primer (5′ CATGTAGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC 3′) designed from the mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA sequence. Monc-1 cells were grown on glass slides coated with fibronectin or fibronectin plus poly-d-lysine in the appropriate medium (see “Cell Culture and Reagents”). Immunostaining for smooth muscle α-actin, calponin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and peripherin was performed as described (12Shah N.M. Groves A.K. Anderson D.J.

Proteins from undifferentiated and differentiated Monc-1 cells and mouse aortas were prepared according to standard procedures (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Proteins were resolved on 5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar), transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell), and incubated with a rabbit anti-smooth muscle myosin heavy chain antibody (23Groschel-Stewart U. Schreiber J. Mahlmeister C. Histochemistry. 1976; 46: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Ute Groschel-Stewart of London, UK) diluted 1:5000, followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody diluted 1:4000. Membranes were processed with an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce) and exposed to film. A 1.4-kilobase fragment of the SM22α promoter was obtained by PCR with mouse genomic DNA and the following primers: forward 5′ CAGTGGCTGGAAAGCAAGAGC 3′ and reverse 5′ GGGCTGGGGCAGACGGGC 3′. The promoter fragment was subcloned into the pGL2-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Generation of the multimerized CArG and CArG mutant constructs in the pGL2-Basic vector will be described elsewhere. 2M. T. Chin and M. E. Lee, manuscript in preparation. Monc-1 cells were transfected transiently by electroporation as described (24Kho C.-J. Huggins G.S. Endege W.O. Hsieh C.-M. Lee M.-E. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3845-3851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were prepared 48–72 h after transfection, and luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described (25Braiser A.R. Tate J.E. Habener J.F.

Each construct was transfected at least six times. Data for each construct are presented as the mean ± S.E. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Ritzenthaler et al. (27Ritzenthaler J.D. Goldstein R.H. Fine A. Lichtler A. Rowe D.W. Smith B.D. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis was performed as described (28Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 29Yoshizumi M. Hsieh C.-M. Zhou F. Tsai J.-C. Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Lee M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3266-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In brief, double-stranded oligonucleotide probes synthesized according to the sequence of the SM22α CArG element 5′ TCGAGACTTGGTGTCTTTCCCCAAATATGGAGCCTGTGTGGAGTG 3′ were radiolabeled as described (21Yoshizumi M. Lee W.-S. Hsieh C.-M. Tsai J.-C. Li J. Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Endege W.O. Schlegel R. Lee M.-E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2275-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min and analyzed by 5% native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 0.25 × TBE buffer (22 mm Tris base, 22 mm boric acid, and 0.5 mm EDTA). A 250-fold excess of specific or nonspecific oligonucleotide was used for competition experiments. For supershift experiments, 1 μl of antibody to serum response factor (sc-335x, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-YY1 antibody (sc-281x, Santa Cruz) was incubated with nuclear extracts and probes. Monc-1 cells on fibronectin-coated plates can be maintained in the undifferentiated state in an L-15 CO2-based medium supplemented with chick embryo extract (11Stemple D.L. Anderson D.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 973-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 17Sommer L. Shah N. Rao M. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1245-1258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). After confirming that Monc-1 cells incubated in this complete medium expressed the low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor (data not shown), a marker for undifferentiated neural crest cells (11Stemple D.L. Anderson D.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 973-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 12Shah N.M. Groves A.K. Anderson D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 331-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar,17Sommer L. Shah N. Rao M. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1245-1258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), we looked for culture conditions that would allow us to differentiate the Monc-1 cells down the smooth muscle lineage. Although several media had little effect on the Monc-1 phenotype, culturing the cells in M199 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) induced a dramatic morphologic change. We studied two different lots of fetal bovine serum and observed no difference in their ability to induce Monc-1 cell differentiation. Within 24 h of placement in this SMDM, the cells began to assume a flat, fusiform appearance and the size of the cytoplasm increased. By 4 days of culture in SMDM nearly 100% of the cells had assumed this form (Fig. 1 A, bottom). In comparison with undifferentiated Monc-1 cells (Fig. 1 A, top), cells cultured in SMDM grew much more slowly. At confluence the differentiated cells took on the “hill and valley” appearance characteristic of differentiated SMC (not shown). Immunostaining with antibodies specific to smooth muscle α-actin (Fig. 1 B) and calponin (Fig. 1 C), two well established markers of the smooth muscle lineage (2Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar), revealed robust expression of these genes in Monc-1 cells cultured in SMDM for 4 days but not in controls. As expected, differentiation of Monc-1 cells into glial and neuronal cells (17Sommer L. Shah N. Rao M. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1245-1258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 18Rao M.S. Anderson D.J. J. Neurobiol. 1997; 32: 722-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) was accompanied by immunoreactivity to glial acidic fibrillary protein (Fig. 1 D) and peripherin (not shown). In contrast, SMC differentiated from Monc-1 cells did not stain for glial acidic fibrillary protein or peripherin (not shown). We also measured expression of the mRNAs for these and other smooth muscle markers over the course of Monc-1 cell differentiation in SMDM (at 2, 5, and 8 days). RNA from mouse aorta was used as a positive control for differentiated SMC. As a negative control, Monc-1 cells were induced to differentiate down the neuronal and glial pathways (17Sommer L. Shah N. Rao M. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1245-1258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 18Rao M.S. Anderson D.J. J. Neurobiol. 1997; 32: 722-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) in a parallel experiment. Smooth muscle α-actin and calponin mRNA expression increased as early as 2 days after placement in SMDM (Fig. 2). Neither message was detected after differentiation down the neuronal pathway. Another well studied marker of SMC is the SM22α gene (2Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar, 28Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol.

Development (Camb .). 1996; 122: 2415-2425PubMed Google Scholar), which is expressed exclusively in vascular and visceral SMC in adult animals (28Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). As with the smooth muscle α-actin and calponin mRNAs, expression of the SM22α mRNA increased after incubation in SMDM (Fig. 2). APEG-1, a nuclear protein preferentially expressed in vascular SMC, was cloned recently by our laboratory (33Hsieh C.-M. Yoshizumi M. Endege W.O. Kho C.-J. Jain M.K. Kashiki S. de los Santos R. Lee W.-S. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17354-17359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because its expression is high in arterial SMC in vivo and undetectable (by passage 3) in dedifferentiated arterial SMC in culture (33Hsieh C.-M. Yoshizumi M. Endege W.O. Kho C.-J. Jain M.K. Kashiki S. de los Santos R. Lee W.-S. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17354-17359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), APEG-1 represents a sensitive marker for differentiated SMC. Expression of APEG-1 mRNA also increased during Monc-1 cell culture in SMDM (Fig. 2), indicating that these cells share properties of differentiated vascular SMC. The last marker we tested in this experiment, the AT2, is expressed in the vasculature and many other tissues during embryogenesis (34Lenkei Z. Palkovits M. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortes C. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 373: 322-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Although AT2 expression is down-regulated in the adult vasculature, it continues in adult neuronal cells (34Lenkei Z. Palkovits M. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortes C. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 373: 322-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As Fig. 2 shows, AT2 mRNA was expressed in undifferentiated Monc-1 cells (day 0). Although AT2 receptor mRNA was still visible after 2 days of incubation in SMDM, it disappeared after 5 and 8 days of incubation. AT2 mRNA expression increased as neuronal/glial cell differentiation progressed, as reported previously (34Lenkei Z. Palkovits M. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortes C. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 373: 322-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Expression of these five genes in the Monc-1 cell to SMC differentiation system was similar to that in the aorta, where SMC are highly differentiated. To determine whether smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, a specific marker of differentiated SMC, is expressed in Monc-1 cells, we performed reverse transcription PCR with a pair of primers that amplify 324- and 363-base pair fragments of the SM1 and SM2 isoforms, respectively. The SM1 and SM2 DNA fragments were both amplified from reverse transcribed mouse aorta RNA (Fig. 3 A). SM1 was amplified from differentiated but not undifferentiated Monc-1 cell RNA. We then used primers for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to amplify a specific band from all RNA samples. SM1 and SM2 were both detected in samples prepared from mouse aortas by high resolution Western analysis with an antibody to smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (23Groschel-Stewart U. Schreiber J. Mahlmeister C. Histochemistry. 1976; 46: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 B). Although undifferentiated Monc-1 cells expressed only non-muscle myosin heavy chain (Fig. 3 B, asterisk), differentiated Monc-1 cells expressed SM1. Taken together, these data indicate the presence of SM1 in SMC differentiated from Monc-1 cells. The molecular mechanisms regulating expression of the SM22α gene are very well characterized. For example, we know that a cis-acting element, the CArG box (CC A/T6 GG), is critical for expression of SM22α in vascular SMC, in vitro and in vivo (28Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 30Li L. Miano J.M. Mercer B. Olson E.N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 32Moessler H. Mericskay M. Li Z. Nagl S. Paulin D. Small J.V. Development (Camb .). 1996; 122: 2415-2425PubMed Google Scholar). To see whether the same cis-acting element is critical to induction of SM22α in Monc-1 cells differentiated down the smooth muscle lineage, we performed transient transfection assays with the SM22α promoter. First we generated a luciferase reporter construct, −1.4 kilobase SM22α, containing 1.4 kilobases of the SM22α promoter. Monc-1 cells were transfected by electroporation and cultured in complete medium or SMDM, and luciferase activity was measured in cell lysates 72 h after transfection. The −1.4 kilobase SM22α promoter was minimally active in undifferentiated Monc-1 cells (Fig. 4 A). After differentiation into SMC, however, promoter activity increased by 20–30-fold. We then generated two more reporter constructs to see whether the CArG element was critical to regulation of SM22α promoter activity after Monc-1 cell to SMC differentiation in vitro. The first, CArG (3X) (Fig. 4 A), contained three SM22α CArG elements upstream of the luciferase reporter gene, and the second, mt CArG (3X) (Fig. 4 A), contained three CArG elements in which the core sequence had been modified from 5′ CCAAATATGG 3′ to 5′ CCACACATGG 3′. This mutated sequence cannot function as an enhancer in SMC. Like the activity of the native SM22α promoter, the activity of the multimerized CArG reporter construct increased dramatically (Fig. 4 A) after Monc-1 cell to SMC differentiation, again by about 20-fold. The mutated CArG construct was not active after neural crest cell to SMC differentiation. We hypothesized that specifictrans-acting factors may be induced after Monc-1 differentiation that would bind to the CArG element and thereby regulate SM22α expression. We tested this hypothesis in electrophoretic mobility shift assays with the CArG (3X) oligonucleotide used as a probe. Five specific DNA-protein complexes (Fig. 4 B) were revealed. Complexes 1 and 4 appeared in nuclear extracts from differentiated Monc-1 cells but not in those from undifferentiated cells. Complex 2 was present under both conditions but appeared to intensify after differentiation. Antibody supershift experiments showed that complex 4 (shifted to 5) contains a protein antigenically identical or related to serum response factor, whereas complex 2 (shifted to 3) contains a protein related to YY1. Complex 1 was the only one visible solely in nuclear extracts from Monc-1 cells after differentiation. The protein contained in this novel complex is currently under investigation. A 0.4-kilobase region of the SM22α promoter, within which lie two CArG elements, has been shown to confer expression only in the arterial SMC of transgenic mice (28Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 30Li L. Miano J.M. Mercer B. Olson E.N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Because mutation of the proximal CArG element eliminates all SM22α expression in transgenic animals, this element appears to be necessary and sufficient for directing high level expression restricted to the SMC lineage (28Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). We show here that the activity of the SM22α promoter and a multimerized reporter construct containing the proximal CArG element increased markedly in Monc-1 cells after differentiation down the smooth muscle lineage (Fig. 4 A). These data suggest that specific factors induced by differentiation bind to the CArG element and activate the SM22α promoter. Indeed, three DNA-protein complexes (Fig. 4 B) were seen in nuclear extract from differentiated but not undifferentiated Monc-1 cells by gel mobility shift analysis, and the intensity of a fourth complex increased (Fig. 4 B) in extract from differentiated Monc-1 cells. Our analysis shows that these four complexes contain proteins identical or antigenically related to serum response factor and YY1, two factors known to synergistically activate the CArG box of SM22α and other genes (28Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Together our studies of the SM22α promoter suggest that the genetic program normally instituted in SMC in vivo is recapitulated during Monc-1 cell to SMC differentiation in vitro. Because the excessive proliferation of vascular SMC is critical to the development of occlusive vascular diseases such as heart attack and stroke, the identification of nodal regulators of SMC differentiation is essential to the design of strategies for treating vascular disease. These nodal genes have been difficult to identify because there has been no system for producing differentiated SMC in vitro. We believe that the Monc-1 cell to SMC differentiation system described here represents the equivalent of the 10T1/2 cell system used to study regulators of skeletal muscle differentiation in vitro (2Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). Further study in the Monc-1 cell to SMC system may permit identification of analogous regulators of vascular SMC differentiation. The Monc-1 cell line was kindly provided by D. J. Anderson (Pasadena, CA), the antibody to smooth muscle myosin heavy chain by U. Groschel-Stewart (London), and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers by A. Räisänen-Sokolowski (Boston). We thank G. K. Owens, L. Wang, N. M. Shah, and M. S. Rao for helpful suggestions, M. A. Perrella for reviewing the manuscript, B. Ith for technical assistance, and T.

https://openalex.org/W2071796772,"Alanine substitution mutagenesis of Escherichia coli DNA topoisomerase I, a member of the type IA subfamily of DNA topoisomerases, was carried out to identify amino acid side chains that are involved in transesterification between DNA and the active site tyrosine Tyr-319 of the enzyme. Twelve polar residues that are highly conserved among the type IA enzymes, Glu-9, His-33, Asp-111, Glu-115, Gln-309, Glu-313, Thr-318, Arg-321, Thr-322, Asp-323, His-365, and Thr-496, were selected for alanine substitution. Each of the mutant enzymes was overexpressed, purified, and characterized. Surprisingly, only substitution at Glu-9 and Arg-321 was found to reduce the DNA relaxation activity of the enzyme to an insignificant level. The R321A mutant enzyme, but not the E9A mutant enzyme, was found to retain a reduced level of DNA cleavage activity. Two additional mutant enzymes R321K and E9Q were also constructed and purified. Replacing Arg-321 by lysine has little effect on enzymatic activities; replacing Glu-9 by glutamine greatly reduces the supercoil removal activity but not the DNA cleavage and rejoining activities. From these results and the locations of the amino acids in the crystal structure of the enzyme, it appears that Glu-9 has a critical role in DNA breakage and rejoining, probably through its interaction with the 3′ deoxyribosyl oxygen. The positively charged Arg-321 may also participate in these reactions by interacting with the scissile DNA phosphate as a monodentate. Because of the strict conservation of these residues, the findings for the E. coli enzyme are likely to apply to all type IA DNA topoisomerases."
https://openalex.org/W1981179161,"The origin recognition complex (ORC), a six-subunit protein, functions as the replication initiator in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Initiation depends on the assembly of the prereplication complex in late M phase and activation in S phase. One subunit of ORC, Orc5p, was required at G 1 /S and in early M phase. Asynchronous cells with a temperature-sensitive orc5-1 allele arrested in early M phase. In contrast, cells that were first synchronized in M phase, shifted to the restrictive temperature, and then released from the block arrested at the G 1 /S boundary. The G 1 /S arrest phenotype could not be suppressed by introducing wild-type Orc5p during G 1 . Although all orc2 and orc5 mutations were recessive in the conventional sense, this dominant phenotype was shared with other orc5 alleles and an orc2 allele. The dominant inhibition to cell-cycle progression exhibited by the orc mutants was restricted to the nucleus, suggesting that chromosomes with mutant ORC complexes were capable of sending a signal that blocked initiation on chromosomes containing functional origins."

In addition, both the E196 deletion and the R483P mutant had shorter half-lives than the wild-type enzyme, whereas the half-life of the G291S mutant was comparable with that of the normal protein. These results directly link the clinical situation with the three mutations and suggest that G291 is important for the catalytic activity of P450c21.

In addition, both the E196 deletion and the R483P mutant had shorter half-lives than the wild-type enzyme, whereas the half-life of the G291S mutant was comparable with that of the normal protein. These results directly link the clinical situation with the three mutations and suggest that G291 is important for the catalytic activity of P450c21. Cytochrome P450s are a superfamily of enzymes essential for the oxidative metabolism of different endogenous compounds and xenobiotics (1Nelson D.R. Kamataki T. Waxman D.J. Guengerich F.P. Estabrook R.W. Feyereisen R. Gonzalez F.J. Coon M.J. Gunsalus I.C. Gotoh O. Okuda K. Nebert D.W. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar). For many members of the family, enzyme activity varies between individuals due to polymorphisms in the coding parts of the genes. Four cytochrome P450 enzymes are involved in the synthesis of cortisol in the adrenal cortex (2Miller W.L. Endocr. Rev. 1988; 9: 295-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). Impaired production of cortisol due to reduced function of any of these enzymes causes increased secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the pituitary and congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) 1The abbreviations used are: CAH, congenital adrenal hyperplasia; CYP21, the steroid 21-hydroxylase gene;CYP21P, the steroid 21-hydroxylase pseudogene; P450c21, steroid 21-hydroxylase; 17-OHP, 17-hydroxyprogesterone; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. (3Miller W.L. Levine L.S. J. Pediatr. 1987; 111: 1-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Of particular interest is the cytochrome P450 steroid 21-hydroxylase (P450c21) since more than 90% of all cases of CAH are due to mutations in the gene encoding the enzyme. P450c21 participates in the synthesis of both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. In addition to lack of cortisol and aldosterone, P450c21 deficiency leads to overproduction of adrenal androgens. The disorder has a wide spectrum of manifestations (4White P.C. New M.I. Dupont B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1987; 316: 1519-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), ranging from a life-threatening neonatal condition in both sexes with ambiguous genitalia in girls, to inconspicuous symptoms of hyperandrogenism in adult women. P450c21 is a protein of 494 amino acids (5White P.C. New M.I. Dupont B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5111-5115Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 6Higashi Y. Yoshioka H. Yamane M. Gotoh O. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2841-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The gene locus has a complicated structure, with an active gene (CYP21) and a highly homologous inactive pseudogene (CYP21P) (5White P.C. New M.I. Dupont B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5111-5115Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 6Higashi Y. Yoshioka H. Yamane M. Gotoh O. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Misalignment followed by recombination events between the two homologous genes during meiosis with transfer of sequences from CYP21P to CYP21 account for around 95% of the mutations of P450c21 that lead to CAH (9Wedell A. Thilén A. Ritzén E.M. Stengler B. Luthman H. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 78: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Rarely, mutations also arise independently of the pseudogene. We have charcterized three such rare missense mutations, which were found in patients with CAH. To investigate the molecular mechanisms behind the impaired enzyme function displayed by the patients, the mutations were reconstructed by in vitro site-directed mutagenesis, and normal and mutant enzyme was transiently expressed in COS-1 cells. Enzyme activities toward the two natural substrates, 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) and progesterone, were determined. In addition, to assess whether the impaired function resulted from reduced stability of the mutant proteins, their half-lives were determined by pulse-chase experiments followed by immunoprecipitation. The CYP21 mutations were found in five patients with CAH. The siblings numbers B39 and B40, as well as patient number B103, have been reported previously (10Wedell A. Ritzén M.E. Haglund-Stengler B. Luthman H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7232-7236Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 11Wedell A. Luthman H. Hum. Genet. 1993; 91: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), whereas the younger brother of B103, patient E. I., as well as patient number 1293 have not been described. Genotyping was performed by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (12Wedell A. Luthman H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and direct sequencing of CYP21 (10Wedell A. Ritzén M.E. Haglund-Stengler B. Luthman H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7232-7236Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Numbering of nucleotides and amino acids follows the reference sequence of White et al. (5White P.C. New M.I. Dupont B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5111-5115Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Subjects numbers B39 and B40 were compound heterozygotes, with the unique R483P mutation on one allele and the well-known I172N mutation (13Amor M. Parker K.L. Globerman H. New M.I. White P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1600-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) on the other. They had a moderate form of the disease, with early clitoral enlargement in the female sibling but without salt-wasting. Subject number B103 and his younger brother E. I. had inherited the unique G291S mutation on their paternal allele, whereas the maternal allele was deleted. They had the most severe, salt-wasting form of CAH. Patient number 1293 was a compound heterozygote for the I172N mutation and a novel sequence aberration, where nucleotides 1158–1160 (AGG) in exon 5 of CYP21 were deleted, causing loss of a glutamic acid residue at position 196 in P450c21, delE196 (Fig. 1). This female patient was born in Norway in 1968 and was affected with a moderate form of CAH with some signs of prenatal virilization but without salt-wasting. pGEM constructs as well as pCMV4 expression vectors were constructed to contain the cDNAs encoding the wild-type and the three mutant enzymes, essentially as described previously (14Nikoshkov A. Lajic S. Holst M. Wedell A. Luthman H. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The plasmids thus generated were named pGEM-CYP21 (encoding the wild-type enzyme), pGEM-CYP21(delE196), pGEM-CYP21(G291S), pGEM-CYP21(R483P), and pCMV4-CYP21, pCMV4-CYP21(delE196), pCMV4-CYP21(G291S), and pCMV4-CYP21(R483P). All constructs were sequenced to verify the correct incorporation of the mutations and to exclude additional aberrations. Enzymatic activities of the mutants and the wild-type enzyme were determined in intact COS-1 cells after transient expression, using 17-OHP and progesterone as substrates (14Nikoshkov A. Lajic S. Holst M. Wedell A. Luthman H. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Estimation of translation efficiency was performed using the TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. An ATG sequence was present in the multiple cloning site of pGEM-CYP21, upstream of CYP21, but in a different reading frame. This initiation codon was destroyed by SphI cleavage, T4 polymerase treatment, and blunt-end ligation, which resulted in the removal of four nucleotides in this region. Two μg of plasmids pGEM-CYP21, pGEM-CYP21(delE196), pGEM-CYP21(G291S), and pGEM-CYP21(R483P) were used for transcription/translation, incubation times were 5, 10, 15, and 20 min, and [35S]methionine incorporation was measured by scintillation counting after trichloroacetic acid precipitation of translation products. The translation products obtained after a 60-min incubation were subjected to SDS-PAGE to verify the integrity of the 55-kDa 21-hydroxylase protein. COS-1 cells were transfected (14Nikoshkov A. Lajic S. Holst M. Wedell A. Luthman H. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) with the expression constructs pCMV4-CYP21, pCMV4-CYP21(delE196), pCMV4-CYP21(G291S), or pCMV4-CYP21(R483P) and incubated for 30 h. Cells were then labeled (100 μCi of [35S]methionine) and immunoprecipitated as described (15Dorner A.J. Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 577-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. The rabbit P450c21 antiserum used was kindly provided by Dr. Peter F. H. Hall, Prince of Wales Hospital, Randwick, Australia. Labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography, and their intensities were quantified using a phosphoimager (Fujix Bas 1000 Bio-Imaging Analyzer, Fuji, Japan). For each time point examined (within each mutant), immunoprecipitated material corresponded to equal total cell protein as determined by Bradford (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar). The degradation profiles and half-lives of the different P450c21s were calculated using a curve-fitting program (FigP, Elsevier Biosoft Ver. 5.0). TableI shows that all mutants had a fraction of the activity of the wild-type enzyme. The delE196 mutant retained 6% activity toward 17-OHP and 23% activity toward progesterone. The G291S mutant displayed 0.8% of normal activity in both cases, whereas the R483P mutant displayed 1% of normal activity toward 17-OHP and 2.2% activity toward progesterone. The activity of the wild-type enzyme was defined as 100%.Table IPercentage of wild-type activity for P450c21 mutants (delE196, G291S, and R483P) in intact COS-1 cells17-OHPProgesteronedelE1966.0 ± 1.523 ± 2.3G291S0.8 ± 0.40.8 ± 0.4R483P1.0 ± 0.072.2 ± 0.91-a Activities are expressed as percentage of wild-type activity that is arbitrarily defined as 100%.

To investigate whether the three sequence alterations of CYP21 had any effect on the translation of the gene, an in vitro-coupled transcription/translation assay was employed. None of the mutations affected the rate of translation in this in vitro system (data not shown). Fig. 2 shows the degradation profiles of immunoprecipitated wild-type and mutant P450c21s for chase periods of up to 4 h.

To examine whether this was the case for three novel mutant P450c21s from patients with CAH, we studied the enzymatic activities and half-lives of the mutants. All three mutations impaired enzyme activity toward the two natural substrates of the enzyme when assayed after transient transfection in cultured cells. The delE196 mutant was partially active toward both substrates. P450c21 G291S resulted in a protein with less than 1% of normal activity, whereas the R483P mutant retained 1–2% of the activity of the native enzyme. This is in agreement with the clinical phenotypes of the patients. Those carrying delE196 and R483P had moderate forms of CAH and were compound heterozygotes with the I172N mutation on the other chromosome. The latter mutation is generally associated with the moderate, simple virilizing phenotype (9Wedell A. Thilén A. Ritzén E.M. Stengler B. Luthman H. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 78: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar,17Speiser P.W. Dupont J. Zhu D. Serrat J. Buegeleisen M. Tusie-Luna M.-T. Lesser M. New M.I. White P.C. J. Clin.

The brothers carrying G291S had deleted their 21-hydroxylase gene of the other chromosome and had the most severe, salt-wasting form of the disease. To examine whether the reduced enzymatic activity of the mutants was a consequence of reduced stability rather than decreased turnover of substrate, the half-lives of the wild-type and the three mutant enzymes were compared by pulse-chase experiments. The half-life of the wild-type P450c21 (1 h, 10 min) was longer than those of all mutants. The delE196 and R483P mutants were most rapidly degraded (half-lives 30 and 20 min, respectively). These data suggest that the phenotypes resulting from the delE196 and R483P mutants can be explained in view of little if any available P450c21. In contrast, since the half-life of G291S (55 min) and wild-type P450c21 (1 h, 10 min) were comparable, it seems that G291 plays an essential role in the maintenance of enzyme activity. Generally little is known about structure-function relationships of mammalian cytochrome P450 enzymes. One reason is that mammalian P450s contain hydrophobic segments and are therefore difficult to crystallize. However, three-dimensional structures of four nonmembrane-associated bacterial cytochrome P450s (P450cam (19Poulos T.L. Finzel B.C. Howard A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 687-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar), P450BM-3 (20Ravichandran K.G. Boddupalli S.S. Hasemann C.A. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J.

Biol. 1995; 2: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar)) have been determined. A correlation of important residues among different classes of cytochrome P450s has been made by Nelson and Strobel (23Nelson D.R. Strobel H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6038-6050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) after alignment of 34 different P450s, including P450c21 and P450cam (24Iida T. Nakahori Y. Komaki R. Mori E. Hayashi N. Tsutsumi O. Taketani Y. Nakagome Y. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1437-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). According to their model, G291 would be hydrogen-bonded with T295 to form together an oxygen-binding pocket. Another model obtained from the structural information of P450BM-3 (20Ravichandran K.G. Boddupalli S.S. Hasemann C.A. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1993; 261: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar) implies that residues 291–297 of human P450c21 are involved in proton transfer from water to heme. Thus, G291 is intricately involved in catalysis according to two different models, and our experimental data suggest that this particular residue is essential to maintain enzyme activity. In conclusion, enzymatic activity and stability analyses of three naturally occurring mutants of P450c21 from patients with CAH provided a potential explanation for the clinical symptoms and identified residues important for the in vitro stability and catalytic activity of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1983607362,"Unlike mammals, birds, and most other fishes, winter flounder completes spermatogenesis without replacing its germ cell histones with protamines. Instead, during spermiogenesis, these fish produce a family of high molecular weight (80,000–200,000) basic nuclear proteins (HM rBNPs) that bind to sperm chromatin containing the normal complement of histones. These large, basic proteins are built up of tandem iterations of oligopeptide repeats that contain phosphorylatable DNA-binding motifs. Although the HM rBNPs have no obvious homology to histones, protamines, or other sperm-specific chromatin proteins, we report here the isolation of a clone (2B) from a winter flounder genomic DNA library that establishes a link between the HM rBNPs and histone H1. The 2B sequence contains an open reading frame, which, when conceptually translated, encodes a 265-residue protein. At its N terminus the translation product contains numerous simple repeats that match the oligopeptides contained within the HM rBNPs. Unexpectedly, the C terminus of the putative protein shows 66% identity and 76% conservation to the histone H1 globular domain. This connection suggests that the HM rBNPs may have originated from the extended N-terminal tail region of a testis-specific, H1-like linker histone.

This connection suggests that the HM rBNPs may have originated from the extended N-terminal tail region of a testis-specific, H1-like linker histone. In almost all eukaryotic cells, histones have a fundamental role in organizing and condensing DNA (1Wolffe A. Chromatin Structure and Function. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1995Google Scholar, 2Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6991) Google Scholar). It is therefore not surprising that the sequences of the core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) are extremely well conserved and contain many basic residues. The fifth histone (H1), which may or may not sit outside the nucleosomal core (3Crane-Robinson C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 75-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), is the longest, most variable, and most lysine-rich member of the histone family. The structure of histone H1 can be subdivided into three domains: a variable N-terminal region of 35–40 residues with a net positive charge followed by a well conserved globular domain of 80 residues (4Ramakrishnan V. Finch J.T. Graziano V. Lee P.L. Sweet R.M. Nature. 1993; 362: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), which is thought to interact with both core histones and nucleosomal DNA, and a very basic C-terminal tail of ∼90 residues, 90% of which is lysine, alanine, and proline. Most organisms possess more than one tissue- or stage-specific histone H1 variant (5Gabrielli F. Hnilica L.S. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Histones and Other Basic Nuclear Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1989: 3-16Google Scholar, 6Kistler W.S. Hnilica L.S. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Histones and Other Basic Nuclear Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1989: 331-345Google Scholar). For example, sperm-specific histone H1 variants (H1T) are commonly found in mammals (6Kistler W.S. Hnilica L.S. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Histones and Other Basic Nuclear Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1989: 331-345Google Scholar), amphibians (7Kasinsky H.E. Mann M. Huang S.Y. Fabre L. Coyle B. Byrd Jr., E.W. J. Exp. Zool. 1987; 243: 137-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and invertebrates (8Carlos S. Jutglar L. Borrell I. Hunt D.F. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 26: 185-194Google Scholar, 9Schulze E. Trieschmann L. Schulze B. Schmidt E.R. Pitzel S. Zechel K. Grossbach U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 268: 2481-2485Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). H1Ts typically have a shorter C-terminal domain and tails that contain a higher proportion of positively charged residues (usually Arg) than their somatic counterparts, as well as a greater number of phosphorylation sites (6Kistler W.S. Hnilica L.S. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Histones and Other Basic Nuclear Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1989: 331-345Google Scholar). However, the sperm-specific H1 of sea urchin (SpH1) is longer than its somatic counterpart at both ends due to N- and C-terminal extensions composed of tetrapeptide repeats (SPXB, where X is usually basic, and B is K or R) (10Romano G. Cell Biol. Intl. Reports. 1992; 16: 197-206Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This trend to increased basicity and a higher arginine content in sperm-specific histones may facilitate condensation of the DNA into the sperm nucleus. In fact, the switch from somatic to sperm chromatin can be accomplished using a variety of proteins. One strategy used by some vertebrates and many invertebrates is to retain histones in a nucleosomal arrangement but to incorporate sperm-specific histone variants and/or other specialized basic proteins into the condensing chromatin (11Jutglar L. Borrell J.I. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8184-8191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kasinsky H.E. Hnilica L.S. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Histones and Other Basic Nuclear Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1989: 73-163Google Scholar). In mammals, birds, and most fishes, DNA condensation is ultimately accomplished using protamines. These small arginine-rich proteins replace the histones and by doing so eradicate the nucleosomal organization established by the histones. The winter flounder is one of the minority of bony fishes that retains its histones throughout spermatogenesis and does not replace them with protamines. Moreover, it does not synthesize significant quantities of sperm-specific histone variants (13Kennedy B.P. Davies P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2533-2539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The winter flounder does, however, produce a group of high molecular weight basic nuclear proteins (HM rBNPs) 1The abbreviations used are: HM rBNP, high molecular weight basic nuclear protein; ORF, open reading frame; UTR, untranslated region; kb, kilobase pair(s); bp, base pair(s). in mid- to late spermatids. These unique proteins are retained in the mature sperm, where they comprise >25% of the total acid-soluble proteins. As judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, there are at least 15 HM rBNPs that range in apparent molecular weight from 80,000 to 150,000, with a major band at ∼110,000 and trace quantities of larger proteins up to 200,000. Amino acid analysis revealed that this group of proteins is constructed primarily from four amino acids: Arg (24%), Ser (23%), Lys (15%), and Pro (14%), which reflects their underlying simple repetitive sequences of dodecapeptides, with the consensus sequence SPMRSRSPSRSK, and heptapeptides, with the sequence RRVXXPK (whereXX is QT or PS) (14Young D.C. Davies P.L. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1987; 65: 909-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). This simple composition and intermediate basicity suggests that the HM rBNPs might best fit in the class of chromatin proteins intermediate between histones and protamines (15Bloch D.P. Genetics. 1969; 61: 93-111PubMed Google Scholar). Although the extreme repetitiveness of the HM rBNPs has precluded us from directly sequencing the proteins and from isolating full-length cDNA and genomic clones, we have obtained partial nucleotide sequences including the proximal promoter, 5′ and 3′ UTRs and about 1.5 kb of the coding region (manuscript in preparation, see GenBank™ accession numbersU39735, U39845, and U39932). Using these tools, we have investigated the genomic structure of the HM rBNPs. Here we report the isolation of a winter flounder HM rBNP genomic clone, designated 2B. The ORF of this clone encodes a 30-kDa protein whose N-terminal sequence shows homology to the HM rBNPs. Most interestingly, the C-terminal region of the putative protein encodes a histone H1-like globular core domain. This finding sheds new light on the origin of the HM rBNPs and their function in the developing sperm of the winter flounder. A partialSau3A-digested winter flounder genomic DNA library was custom-made by Stratagene in λFixII. The amplified library was plated on Escherichia coli NM522, and plaques were transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell). The membranes were screened with 32P-labeled, HM rBNP cDNA clone 3′-5 (Genbank™ accession number U39735). Selected positive plaques were purified through two further rounds of screening. DNA from phage that had been banded twice on CsCl was digested with restriction enzymes and electrophoresed through a 0.8% agarose gel. The DNA was stained with ethidium bromide and photographed. A restriction enzyme map was constructed based on single and double digests. To identify regions of homology to the HM rBNP cDNA, the restriction enzyme fragments were also analyzed by Southern blotting using32P-labeled, HM rBNP cDNA clone 3′-5 (Genbank™ accession number U39735). The membrane was hybridized overnight at 68 °C in 25 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2) containing 7% SDS. After hybridization, the membrane was washed twice for 20 min at 68 °C with 0.1% SDS containing 0.5× SSC and then autoradiographed (XAR, Kodak). Regions of hybridization were subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene) and sequenced (Sequenase 2.0, U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Genomic DNA from an individual fish was isolated from frozen tissue as described (16Scott G.K. Hew C.L. Davies P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2613-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA (10 μg) and purified phage DNA (100 ng combined with 10 μg of calf thymus DNA) were digested with restriction enzymes, and the fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nylon membrane (Zeta-Probe GT, Bio-Rad). HM rBNP cDNA clone 3′-5 (Genbank™ accession number U39735) was radiolabeled and used to probe the bound DNA (see above). Dot matrix comparisons were performed using the Caltech DNA sequence analysis program, version 2.4. The sequences (2B from this paper and HM rBNP compiled from Genbank™ accession numbers U39845 and U39932) were compared using a stringency of 16 matches in a window of 20 bp. The HM rBNPs are a family of abundant proteins produced only in the testis during spermatogenesis. Their abundance was reflected in the frequency with which HM rBNP clones were isolated from a mid-spermatid stage testis cDNA library (17Watson, C. E. (1995) Structural Analysis of Flounder High Molecular Weight Sperm Chromatin Proteins and Their Genes. Ph. D. Dissertation, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada.Google Scholar). However, numerous attempts to recover a full-length cDNA have been hampered by the extreme repetitiveness of the sequence. As a result, we have had to piece together information about these proteins and their sequence using a number of different strategies. In an attempt to obtain information about HM rBNP gene structure and regulation, we screened a partialSau3A-digested winter flounder genomic DNA library using an incomplete cDNA clone. Approximately 200,000 plaque forming units (>3 genome equivalents) from the amplified library were screened using radiolabeled HM rBNP cDNA clone 3′-5. Over 50 hybridization signals of varying intensities were detected. 23 of the phage producing strong signals were plaque-purified, and restriction enzyme maps for 10 of these clones were constructed. The clones were grouped into two main classes (Fig. 1) based on the similarity and overlap of their restriction maps. Phage in class A formed a group of five overlapping clones (2B, 2D, 2E, 4B, and 1D) that spanned more than 20 kb. Each clone possessed a discrete region that hybridized strongly to the HM rBNP cDNA probe. With the exception of clone 4B (which was truncated in the region of hybridization), the match to the HM rBNP cDNA probe was restricted to a 1.6-kb SacI/HindIII fragment. Class B comprised three clones (3B, 3C, and 3F) representing ∼18 kb of genomic DNA. These phage also contained a single region of hybridization that was localized around a common SacI site. The remaining two clones (1C and 2A) appear to have unique restriction maps and showed hybridization only at one end of the phage insert. Based on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis experiments, the HM rBNPs range in size from 80 to 200 kDa, with the most abundant protein being approximately 110 kDa (13Kennedy B.P. Davies P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2533-2539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such size estimates predict a mRNA of at least 2 kb and suggest that the isolated genomic clones would probably not encode a full-length HM rBNP sequence. However, because these clones could possibly represent HM rBNP exons, pseudogenes, or related sequences and might therefore provide important information about these proteins and their genes, we chose to investigate one of the clones (2B) from class A. The 1.6-kbHindIII/SacI fragment (which hybridized to the HM rBNP cDNA) of genomic clone 2B and its flanking regions were subcloned and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence obtained contains a long ORF from bp 498–1324 (Fig. 2), which when conceptually translated (beginning at the first in-frame methionine codon) would encode a 265-amino acid-long, 30-kDa protein. This ORF is followed by two potential polyadenylation signals (AATAAA), 107 (bp 1431) and 225 bp (bp 1549) downstream from the predicted translation termination codon. The sequence reported here also extends over 500 bp on the 5′-side of the coding region. Portions of the nucleotide sequence of 2B showed a high degree of identity to a representative HM rBNP gene sequence. Dot matrix analysis of the two sequences (Fig. 3) using a stringency of >80% identity (16 out of 20) showed extensive areas of homology. These regions included portions of the proximal promoter, the 5′-UTR, and the coding sequence. Curiously, the putative CCAAT and TATA boxes identified in the proximal promoter region of the HM rBNP sequence were not conserved in 2B. DNA coding for the predicted N-terminal region of 2B showed extensive identity to the 5′-UTR and coding region of the HM rBNP gene. Although the region in 2B (bp 557–626) matching the HM rBNP 5′-UTR has been translated in Fig. 2, it is not known at this time if this sequence is 5′-UTR or coding sequence because it is only after the second in-frame ATG in 2B (bp 596–598) that HM rBNP-like sequences begin (see below). Dot matrix analysis comparing the coding regions of 2B and HM rBNP showed a high degree of identity and tandem repetition between these two sequences as indicated by the multiple lines parallel to the diagonal (Fig. 3). These regions of identity occurred over discontinuous stretches of about 100 bp in length, suggesting a closely related but distinct protein sequence. The similarity to the HM rBNP sequence ended abruptly around nucleotide 1075 of clone 2B (codon 184). The predicted amino acid sequence of the N-terminal region of 2B (residues 14–188) had an amino acid composition similar to that of the HM rBNPs. The same four amino acids Arg (21%), Ser (22%), Lys (17%), and Pro (11%) were by far the most abundant and together made up 71% of the composition. In addition, 2B contained numerous sequences (Figs. 2 and4) similar to the heptapeptide and dodecapeptide repeats obtained by endoproteinase Lys-C digestion of the HM rBNPs (14Young D.C. Davies P.L. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1987; 65: 909-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these repeats tend to occur in a defined order, interspersed with the sequences SPK and MRAKSPRRSK, such that they form a 32-amino acid sequence (Fig. 4). These larger repeats, with the consensus sequence KSPMRSRSPSRSKSPKRRVKTPKMRAKSPRRS, occurred four times (three linked in tandem) within the first 170 residues of the ORF and showed 71–90% identity to each other. Such repeats were also detected in the HM rBNP coding region (GenBank™ accession number 39735). The three HM rBNP repeats selected for comparison (x, y, and z) showed 80–90% similarity to the repeats in 2B. In addition, the predicted amino acid sequence of 2B contained four tandemly arrayed 7-amino acid repeats between residues 156–183 that overlap with the most C-terminal 32-amino acid repeat. These repeats (consensus sequence SPKMRAK) were distinct from both the heptapeptide repeats determined by peptide sequencing (RRVQTPK) and those present in the 32-amino acid repeats (RRVKTPK). They are more like the sequences that separate the dodecapeptide and heptapeptide repeats in the 32-amino acid repeats (SPK and MRAK). Therefore, residues 28–183 of clone 2B closely resemble the abundant HM rBNPs but with subtle differences in the repeat pattern. The nucleotide and amino acid match to the HM rBNP sequences ends around amino acid 183 (bp 1075). A data base search with the remaining 82 residues revealed high identity between this region and part of histone H1. In fact, residues 189–265 at the C terminus of 2B showed an indisputable similarity to the globular core region of histone H1 (Fig. 5). Typically, the core of histone H1 extends about 80 residues (from residues 35–40 to 115) and is highly conserved. By including a two-amino acid gap after residue 251 of 2B (to maximize identity), the overall alignment showed 66% identity and 76% conservation. By comparison to the known structures of the globular region of histones H1 and H5, this two-amino acid deletion occurs in the most flexible part of the structure, the β-hairpin between the last two β-strands (18Cerf C. Lippens G. Muyldermans S. Segers A. Ramakrishnan V. Wodak S.J. Hallenga K. Wyns L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11345-11351Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). That this region can accommodate such a deletion is nicely illustrated by the structural homolog, catabolite gene activator protein, which has a 4-amino acid deletion at the equivalent point that slightly shortens the β-hairpin (4Ramakrishnan V. Finch J.T. Graziano V. Lee P.L. Sweet R.M. Nature. 1993; 362: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Testis-specific histone H1 variants have been found in some organisms, and the cores of three such proteins are present in the alignment shown in Fig. 5. There are a number of “testis-specific” amino acid substitutions in the well conserved core. These include (using the human H1T numbering) K50E, V52L, K56Q, and V61M. Of the three, the last change was seen in 2B (residue 210). Because the λFixII library was propagated in a Rec+ host, it was possible that the clones obtained from this library had been subject to internal recombination/deletion. To address this question, representative clones 1D (the longest of the class A clones) and 3B (a class B clone) were examined by Southern blot hybridization (Fig. 6). The hybridizing fragments from the λ clones (digested with three different restriction enzymes) all aligned perfectly with bands in the genomic DNA lanes. Clone 1D gave rise to single bands of hybridization at 10, 3, and 10 kb with EcoRI, HindIII, and SacI, respectively, whereas clone 3B produced 6-, 6-, and 5-kb bands of hybridization after digestion with the same three enzymes, respectively. This suggested that the clones were not the result of internal recombination but were continuous genomic fragments. However, as the corresponding genomic bands were far less intense on the autoradiograph than other HM rBNP gene signals, they are presumed to encode minor variants of the HM rBNP gene family or possibly pseudogenes. The main purpose of spermiogenesis is to produce a streamlined, motile cell that can efficiently transfer the male's genetic material to the egg. One of the requirements of this streamlining is the condensation of the nucleus. Different organisms have used various approaches to meet this challenge but have generally accomplished it by increasing the positive charges present on the sperm chromatin proteins, either through the introduction of sperm-specific histone variants or the replacement of histones by protamines (12Kasinsky H.E. Hnilica L.S. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Histones and Other Basic Nuclear Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1989: 73-163Google Scholar). Among fish, both approaches are used. For example, rainbow trout (19Oliva R. Dixon G.H. Cohn W.E. Moldave K. Progress in Nucleic Acid Research and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1991: 26-94Google Scholar) and yellow perch (20Daisley S.L. Davies P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 698: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) replace histones with protamines, whereas grass carp retain their histones but produce a number of sperm-specific variants (21Kadura S.N. Khrapunov S.N. Chabanny V.N. Berdyshev G.D. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1983; 74B: 343-350Google Scholar). Prior to this study, it was thought that winter flounder used an extreme variation of the second approach. In addition to retaining their histones, they synthesize a novel group of sperm chromatin proteins, the HM rBNPs, that appear to be involved in binding and condensing DNA and are thus functionally related to protamines and linker histones (13Kennedy B.P. Davies P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2533-2539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kennedy B.P. Davies P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11160-11165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, characterization of the HM rBNPs in isolation failed to identify a link to either group or indeed to any other proteins. Their amino acid composition is intermediate between those of histones and protamines, but their size and amino acid sequence resembles neither one. Recent data base searches of Genbank™ and Swiss-prot with the HM rBNP peptide repeats and partial nucleotide sequences did not reveal any similar proteins. The isolation and sequencing of genomic clone 2B has at long last shed light on the origin of the HM rBNPs. The HM rBNPs are clearly related to linker histones because the putative coding region of 2B is homologous to the HM rBNPs at its N terminus and to the globular region of histone H1 at its C terminus. Also, the 5′-flanking region of the 2B ORF has very high sequence identity to the proximal promoter of the HM rBNP genes. It is important to emphasize that this linkage is not a recombination artifact. When the λ FixII genomic library was screened with HM rBNP cDNA, many hybridization signals were detected. Restriction enzyme analysis of 10 of these clones picked at random did not identify a full-length HM rBNP gene, despite their strong hybridization signal on phage DNA blots (see Fig. 5). Although one of the 10 clones isolated (1C) contained 1.5 kb from the 5′-end of a HM rBNP gene, this identity occurred at one end of the phage insert where the bulk of the repeat had been removed by the original Sau3A digestion (data not shown). The failure to isolate a full-length HM rBNP gene is entirely consistent with the extraordinary difficulties experienced in trying to clone these highly repetitive sequences at the cDNA level. However, because the host cells used to screen the genomic library (E. coli NM532) were Rec+, the possibility that the isolated clones had undergone recombination/deletion was investigated. Southern blot analysis of these clones alongside winter flounder genomic DNA indicates that they contain bona fide DNA fragments that have not been rearranged. It also suggests that gene 2B represents a minor constituent, perhaps a single copy gene, among the HM rBNP multi-gene family. Indeed, it is notable that the intransigence of the HM rBNP genes to cloning facilitated the isolation of clone 2B. It is quite likely that the progenitor of 2B and the HM rBNPs was a testis-specific variant of histone H1, which would account for the tissue and stage specificity of HM rBNP expression. Some testis-specific histones are notably more basic (and arginine-rich) than their somatic counterparts and have N- or C-terminal regions that contain short simple repeats of the SPKK motif (6Kistler W.S. Hnilica L.S. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Histones and Other Basic Nuclear Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1989: 331-345Google Scholar, 10Romano G. Cell Biol. Intl.

Amplification of similar repeats could have produced an extreme H1 variant like 2B to assist in regulated and reversible sperm chromatin condensation. Gene duplication, rearrangement, and loss of the globular H1-like domain in the HM rBNP progenitor have apparently given rise to this unique auxiliary sperm chromatin protein. Moreover, the demand for this protein seems to have led to the extensive expansion and amplification of its gene to the point where there are now at the very least 15 HM rBNP isoforms (13Kennedy B.P. Davies P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2533-2539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This recognition of HM rBNP origins is particularly interesting in relation to recent work on the “protamine-like” sperm proteins of the mollusk, Mytilus californianus. Carlos et al. (8Carlos S. Jutglar L. Borrell I. Hunt D.F. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 26: 185-194Google Scholar, 25Carlos S. Hunt D.F. Rocchini C. Arnott D.P. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 195-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that two of the three major protamine-like proteins in this invertebrate are in fact post-translational cleavage products of an H1-like protein. Specifically, PL-IV was the C-terminal peptide of this protein, and PL-II* (or φ2B) encompassed the N-terminal peptide linked to an 84-amino acid trypsin-resistant globular region that shows ∼40% similarity to the globular core of many histone H1s (11Jutglar L. Borrell J.I. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8184-8191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The third major protamine-like protein (PL-III) was homologous to the N-terminal region of PL-II* (26Rocchini C. Rice P. Ausio J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). PL-II*, PL-III, and related proteins are enriched in SPKK motifs and also contain stretches of alternating S(R/K) (27Giancotti V. Buratti E. Santucci A. Neri P. Crane-Robinson C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1119: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), both of which are prevalent and phosphorylatable in the flounder HM rBNPs (28Kennedy B.P. Davies P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4338-4344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these two instances, nonclassical, protamine-like sperm proteins have turned out to be histone H1 derivatives. Because fishes that do not produce protamines often have additional quantities of linker histones (29Saperas N. Ausio J. Lloris D. Chiva M. J. Mol. Evol. 1994; 39: 282-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), a common theme is beginning to emerge, that of extra linker histones and their derivatives compensating for the lack of protamine in the developing sperm nucleus. Indeed, it is quite likely that some of the additional sperm-specific proteins and other protamine-like proteins in the recent classification of Saperas et al. (29Saperas N. Ausio J. Lloris D. Chiva M. J. Mol. Evol. 1994; 39: 282-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) will turn out to be H1 derivatives. It is beginning to appear that the distinction among protamines, protamine-like proteins, and linker histones may simply be their stage of evolution. The idea that sperm basic chromatin proteins originated from histones was originally proposed by Subirana et al.(30Subirana J.A. Coxcolluela C. Plau J. Unzeta M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 317: 364-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This hypothesis has since been refined by Ausio and co-workers to suggest that such proteins arose from a primitive histone H1, and it is supported by their extensive biochemical analysis of sperm nuclear proteins from a wide variety of lower eukaryotes (31Rocchini C. Zhang F. Ausio J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15704-15712Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 32Rocchini C. Marx R.M. von Carosfeld J.S. Kasinsky H.E. Rosenberg E. Sommer F. Ausio J. J. Mol.

The isolation and characterization of winter flounder clone 2B provides evidence in vertebrates that specialized sperm chromatin proteins have evolved from the N-terminal tail of a progenitor linker histone.

https://openalex.org/W2058079727,"The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) is responsible for the clearance of several physiological ligands including a complex of proteinase and alpha2-macroglobulin (alpha2M) and for the entrance of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PEA) into cells. We have prepared expression plasmids for the full-length chicken LRP (designated LRP100) and two intermediates encoding 25 and 67% of the receptor (designated LRP25 and LRP67, respectively) using overlapping cDNA fragments. LRP25 and LRP67 encode the N-terminal 22 and 64%, respectively, of LRP100 plus the transmembrane and intracellular domains. Transient transfection of these plasmids into COS-7 cells yielded recombinant proteins of expected molecular mass and immunoreactivity. However, LRP100 was incompletely processed into alpha- (515-kDa) and beta- (85-kDa) chains and was poorly transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi compartment. Stable transformants of LRP100, LRP67, and LRP25 were generated in a mutant Chinese hamster ovary cell line that lacked expression of endogenous LRP and was resistant to PEA. All forms of recombinant LRP proteins were transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus in Chinese hamster ovary cells as shown by their sensitivity to endoglycosidase H and resistance to neuraminidase. Cell surface iodination and subcellular fractionation studies indicated that all three LRP variants were expressed on the plasma membrane. Furthermore, expression of the three LRP variants restored, to various degrees, sensitivity to PEA and the ability to degrade methylamine-activated alpha2M (alpha2M*). These data suggest that deletion of large internal portions of LRP, including the processing site, does not prevent transport of LRP to the plasma membrane, nor does it abolish the interaction of LRP with alpha2M* or PEA. This LRP expression system may allow for the characterization of domains within LRP responsible for its multifunctionality."

Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) 1The abbreviations used are: SHMT, serine hydroxymethyltransferase; PLP, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate; EMS, ethylmethanesulfonate; mel, maternal effect lethal; bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction. is a highly conserved, ubiquitous, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-containing enzyme that catalyzes the reversible conversion of serine and tetrahydrofolate to glycine and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (1Schirch L. Adv. Enzymol. 1982; 53: 83-112PubMed Google Scholar). The β-carbon of serine is the major source of one-carbon units in the one-carbon metabolic pool (2Garrow T.A. Brenner A.A. Whitehead V.M. Chen X.N. Duncan R.G. Korenberg J.R. Shane B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11910-11916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The methyl group passed on through the folate cofactor of SHMT is used in thymidylate, methionine, lipid, and purine biosynthesis. SHMT also catalyzes many secondary reactions, such as amino acid transaminations (for a full review of the reactions catalyzed by SHMT, see Ref. 1Schirch L. Adv. Enzymol. 1982; 53: 83-112PubMed Google Scholar). Eukaryotic organisms have two nuclear genes that encode two distinct isoforms of this enzyme, a cytosolic form and a mitochondrial form. Recent evidence suggests that there is a subcellular partitioning of the reactions catalyzed by SHMT, with the serine to glycine conversion occurring in the mitochondria, and the glycine to serine conversion occurring in the cytoplasm (3Narkewicz M.R. Sauls S.D. Tjoa S.S. Teng C. Fennessey P.V. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 991-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A comparison of the determined and predicted amino acid sequences of many SHMTs reveals a striking degree of homology between all the known forms of this enzyme (2Garrow T.A. Brenner A.A.

These alignments show that the amino and carboxyl termini of SHMT are less conserved but that the middle two thirds of the sequence have long stretches of very high identity. Serine hydroxymethyltransferase levels are elevated in rapidly proliferating cell lines and tumors (6Eichler H.G. Hubbard R. Snell K. Biosci. Rep. 1981; 1: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 7Nakshatri H. Bouillet P. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Chambon P. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 174: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). When lymphocytes are treated with a mitogenic stimulus, the enzymatic activity of SHMT is increased and the incorporation of the β-carbon of serine into DNA is increased (6Eichler H.G. Hubbard R. Snell K. Biosci. Rep. 1981; 1: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). SHMT activity is also increased during the S phase of the cell cycle, suggesting that a product of SHMT activity is utilized during cell division. Conversely, when cells stop proliferating, SHMT levels decrease. Retinoic acid treatment of P19 embryonal carcinoma cells stops proliferation and stimulates differentiation. Furthermore, it has been shown recently that retinoic acid causes a 50% decrease in SHMT transcript levels (7Nakshatri H. Bouillet P. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Chambon P. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 174: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, serine hydroxymethyltransferase has been proposed as a potential chemotherapy target (8Trakatellis A. Dimitriadou A. Exindari M. Christodoulou D. Malissiovas N. Antoniadis A. Haitoglou K. Postgrad. Med. J. 1994; 70: S89-S92PubMed Google Scholar). A chemical or drug that decreases SHMT activity may cause rapidly proliferating tumor cells to quiesce. Prior to this study, the only observable phenotype of SHMT deficiency was glycine auxotrophy. In Escherichia coli, when the single copy of SHMT (glyA) is mutated, glycine auxotrophy results (9Stauffer G.V. Plamann M.D. Stauffer L.T. Gene (Amst.). 1981; 14: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, glycine auxotrophy is observed only when both forms of SHMT and a third gene, glyA, are mutated (4McNeil J.B. McIntosh E.M. Taylor B.V. Zhang R. Tang S. Bognar A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9155-9165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggesting a functional redundancy in the glycine synthesis pathway. In addition, a line of Chinese hamster ovary cells that lack mitochondrial SHMT activity are glycine auxotrophs (3Narkewicz M.R. Sauls S.D. Tjoa S.S. Teng C. Fennessey P.V. Biochem.

This deficiency is rescued when the cells are transfected with a cDNA encoding the human mitochondrial SHMT (11Stover P.J. Chen L.H. Suh J.R. Stover D.M. Keyomarsi K. Shane B. J. Biol.

This report presents the cloning and characterization of aCaenorhabditis elegans SHMT homolog calledmel-32. Mutations in mel-32 result in amaternal effect lethal (Mel) phenotype. The C. elegans mel-32 mutation is the first reported case of a serine hydroxymethyltransferase deficiency causing lethality. All strains of C. elegans were grown at 20 °C on nematode growth medium plates streaked with E. coli OP50 as a food source. Standard genetic manipulation followed previously described protocols (12Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The analysis of sequence data, sequence comparisons, and data base searches were performed with ACeDB (a C. elegans data base) (13Durbin R. Thierry-Mieg J. C. elegans II.

PCR primers were designed with the aid of Oligo (17Rychlik W. Rhoads R.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 8543-8551Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). The cosmid clone of C05D11 (GenBank accession number U00048) was kindly provided by Dr. Alan Coulson (Medical Research Council, Hinxton, United Kingdom). A computer restriction analysis of C05D11 (MacDNASIS) revealed that coding elements 11 (SHMT) and 13 could be isolated as a 5052-base pair (bp)PvuII-ScaI (Life Technologies, Inc., Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) fragment (residues 36311–41363 of the GenBank entry). The plasmid pGV9 (Fig. 2.) was constructed by ligating the PvuII-ScaI fragment into EcoRV (Life Technologies, Inc.)-cut pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene). The plasmid pC05.11 (Fig. 2.) was constructed by cutting pGV9 with PstI (New England Biolabs) and religating, leaving a 3196-bp fragment of C05D11 (residues 36311–39507), containing only open reading frame 11 (SHMT), in pBluescript. The subclones containing the SHMT gene were injected into the syncytial gonad of adult wild-type (N2) C. elegans hermaphrodites together with the dominant markerrol-6(su1006) (18Kramer J.M.

Stable transgenic strains, those expressing the roller phenotype in successive generations, were used in the rescue experiments. DNA from individual C. elegans heterozygous for each of the SHMT mutations was isolated as described by Barstead et al. (20Barstead R.J. Kleiman L. Waterston R.H. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1991; 20: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) with the modifications of Williams et al. (21Williams B.D. Schrank B. Huynh C. Shownkeen R. Waterston R.H. Genetics. 1992; 131: 609-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PCR using Taq polymerase (BioCan Scientific) was performed as follows; 5 pmol of each of five sets of primers (synthesized by DNAgency, Malvern, PA) were used (TableI). The samples were incubated at 94 °C for 1 min on an Idaho Technology 1605 Air Thermo-Cycler before commencement of 30 cycles of amplification (94 °C for 10 s, 59 °C (62 °C for the D primer set) for 20 s, and 72 °C for 40 s). Following a 2-min incubation at 72 °C, 1.25 μl of EDTA (0.1 m, pH 7.5) was added to terminate the reaction. Heteroduplex analysis was performed using a mutation detection enhancement gel matrix (J.T. Baker) following the method of Nijbroek et al. (22Nijbroek G. Sood S. McIntosh I. Francomano C.A. Bull E. Pereira L. Ramirez F. Pyeritz R.E. Dietz H.C. Am. J. Hum.

The heteroduplex DNA was then resolved on a 0.5× mutation detection enhancement gel at 400 V for 16–20 h.Table IPCR primersPrimerSequenceProduct lengthbpA1ATGCATATACGTGTTGCC399A2TAATACCGAGCTCCAGGGB1GAAGCGGCAGCGTCGTGG408B2GAGACTTTGCGAGCTGGGC1TATGGGCCTCGATCTTCC483C2GTGTCAACTCCCTTTGCGD1CAACGACGCACAAGTCGC449D2GAGACGAATGCCTCCTGGE1CGGAGTTGAAGGAGCTCG474E2AAGTGATAAAATGGCGGG Open table in a new tab DNA from individual nematodes homozygous for the mel-32(SHMT) mutations was isolated and amplified with the same primers used in the heteroduplex analysis. A total of 0.5 μl of this template DNA was incubated at 95 °C for 3 min on a Precision Scientific GTC-2 Genetic Thermo Cycler before commencement of 35 cycles of amplification (94 °C for 45 s, 59 °C (62 °C for the D primer set) for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min) followed by a polishing step of 72 °C for 7 min. The PCR products from two separate reactions were pooled, purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and collected with a Qiagen QIAquick gel extraction kit. A total of 100–200 ng of each PCR product was sequenced on both strands using FS Taq terminator chemistry (Applied Biosciences) on a Perkin-Elmer GeneAmp PCR System. The reactions were run on an Applied Biosciences model 373A automated DNA sequence analyzer located at the Nucleic Acid-Protein Service Unit, University of British Columbia. A search of the ACeDB program revealed one SHMT homolog, C05D11.11, located on chromosome III within the area defined by the cosmid C05D11. The position of the CeSHMT gene was based on both a Genefinder 5P. Green and L. Hillier, manuscript in preparation. prediction and on five partial cDNAs isolated as part of the C. elegansgenome sequencing project. The predicted gene contains four exons coded in 1599 bp of genomic sequence. The predicted 484-amino acid protein sequence was used to search the GenBank data bank with the FASTA algorithm (14Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9393) Google Scholar, 15Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71458) Google Scholar), and the closest homologs were rabbit and human cytosolic SHMTs (61.7% and 61.3% identity, respectively, in a 470-amino acid overlap). A sequence comparison of SHMTs shows the highly conserved nature of this protein and reveals many conserved domains (Fig. 1). The amino- and carboxyl-terminal 50 amino acids are the least conserved, and the central three-quarters of the protein contain large stretches of completely conserved amino acids. The PLP cofactor binding site (residues 301–305 in the C. elegans protein) and the active site lysine (residue 306) are conserved in every case. Our laboratory is in the process of constructing a transgenic library of sequenced cosmids that can be used for high resolution genetic mapping (23Janke D.L. Schein J.E. Ha T. Franz N.W. O'Neil N.J. Vatcher G.P. Stewart H., I. Kuervers L.K. Baillie D.L. Rose A.M. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 974-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Stable transgenic arrays are generated, which can act as cosmid sized duplications in rescue experiments. If the genomic DNA present in the extrachromosomal array rescues the recessive lethality of an essential gene then the wild-type copy of the mutation must be present in the DNA defined by the transgenic. Previous rescue experiments in our laboratory (23Janke D.L. Schein J.E. Ha T. Franz N.W. O'Neil N.J. Vatcher G.P. Stewart H., I. Kuervers L.K. Baillie D.L. Rose A.M. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 974-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) have placed five essential genes in the genomic region defined by the cosmid C05D11. The genes let-713, let-721, let-725, let-756, and mel-32 are all rescued by C05D11, making these genes candidates for potential mutations in CeSHMT. The mel-32 mutant phenotype was rescued with CeSHMT genomic DNA, indicating that mel-32 encodes SHMT. All rescue experiments were performed with the canonical allele of mel-32, s2518, which was isolated in an EMS mutagenesis screen for maternal effect lethals. 6G. Vatcher, unpublished results. Subsequently, mel-32 was found to be allelic with 16 EMS-induced Mel alleles from a collection of maternal effect embryonic lethal mutations on chromosome III isolated by H. Schnabel and R. Schnabel. 7H. Schnabel and R. Schnabel, unpublished results. Hermaphrodites homozygous for the mel-32 mutations have no observable mutant phenotype, but their self-fertilized offspring display an embryonic lethal phenotype and arrest at about the 100 cell stage. The Mel phenotype of mel-32 was rescued with pGV9, which contains coding element 11 (SHMT) and 13 (Fig. 2). To determine in which of these two genes the mutations reside, a smaller subclone, pC05.11 (Fig. 2), containing only gene 11 (SHMT) was constructed. This subclone, pC05.11, gave a partial rescue of the Mel-32 phenotype. from mel-32;pC05.11 transgenic hermaphrodites, a small number of progeny hatch and grow to adulthood but are not themselves fertile. pGV9 contains the entire 1254 bp of intergenic sequence between gene 11 (CeSHMT) and gene 13, while pC05.11 contains only 416 bp upstream of the CeSHMT ATG start codon. The partial rescue by pC05.11 suggests that some important regulatory sequences are missing from the smaller subclone. The 17 alleles of mel-32 were analyzed by heteroduplex analysis to define more precisely the regions where the mutations occurred. Five sets of overlapping PCR products were generated from animals heterozygous for each allele. The primers used for PCR are listed in Table I, the exact location of each is shown in Fig. 3, and the overlap of each product is shown in Fig. 4. Each amplified DNA product was heat-denatured and allowed to cool slowly. Any PCR product that contains a mutation will have a mixture of homoduplexes and heteroduplexes, paired wild-type and mutant strands that contain base pair mismatches. These duplexes were run on a special mutation detection enhancement gel (see “Experimental Procedures”), which can reveal a single base pair mismatch in a short strand of DNA (24Keen J. Lester D. Inglehearn C. Curtis A. Bhattacharya S. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 5Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The presence of multiple bands indicates a mutation in that particular overlapping fragment. Using this procedure, 13 out of the 17 mutations were placed into specific regions of the gene.Figure 3Nucleotide sequence of the C. elegans SHMT genomic region and derived amino acid sequence.Intronic regions are in lowercase, the primers used in the heteroduplex and sequence analysis are underlined, a putative SL1 leader sequence is denoted by a dashed line, and the poly(A) signal is double underlined.

The active site is indicated by a shaded box.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) These mutations were distributed as follows. Region A (Fig. 4) contained one mutation: t1473 (which was also detected in region B; see below). Region B contained six mutations:t1473 (see below), t1555, t1597, t1665, t1679, and s2518. Region C contained three mutations: t1552, t1616, and t1631. Region D contained three mutations: t1456, t1474, and t1576. Region E contained a single mutation: t1632. For allele t1666, no mutations were detected in regions A, C, D, and E, but a single PCR product could not be obtained for region B. It was therefore assumed that the lesion in this allele was contained in region B, which was later confirmed by direct sequence analysis. The position of the molecular lesions in alleles t1520, t1607, and t1671 could not be detected using this procedure. The same oligonucleotide primers used to generate PCR products for the heteroduplex analysis (Table I) were used to amplify DNA from homozygous mutant animals from the region in which the mutation for each allele was detected. For alleles t1520, t1607, and t1671, in which heteroduplexes were not observed, DNA from all five regions was amplified from mutant strains. The PCR products were then directly sequenced in both orientations (see “Experimental Procedures”). The sequence analysis results are summarized in TableII and Fig. 4. Allele t1631contains the only nonsense mutation identified for mel-32. The codon for glutamine 171 is mutated into an amber stop codon. Any truncated protein produced in this mutant would lack the terminal two thirds of the enzyme, including the active site. This allele is assumed to be a null. The phenotype of this mutant is indistinguishable from the other 16 alleles, suggesting that all of the alleles may be null, or that all reduce the SHMT activity below the threshold required for embryonic survival.Table IImel-32 mutant allelesAlleleCodon mutationAmino acid mutation1t1456GGA → GAAGly-313 → Glu2t1473GCT → GTTAla-63 → ValCTT → TTTLeu-146 → Phe3t1474GGA → GAAGly-313 → Glu4t1520TCT → TTTSer-251 → Phe5t1552GGA → GAAGly-204 → Glu6t1555AGA → AAAArg-102 → Lys7t1576GGA → AGAGly-372 → Arg8t1597CGG → CAGArg-84 → Gln9t1607CAC → TACHis-259 → Tyr10t1616GCT → ACTAla-268 → Thr11t1631CAG → TAGGln-171 → Stop12t1632GGA → GAAGly-406 → Glu13t1665GGA → GAAGly-149 → Glu14t1666GCT → GTTAla-103 → Val15t1671TCT → TTTSer-251 → Phe16t1679GGC → GACGly-143 → Asp17s2518GCC → GTCAla-126 → Val Open table in a new tab Alleles t1456 and t1474 both contain the same base pair mutation, which changes glycine 313 to glutamic acid. In allele t1616, alanine 268 is changed to threonine. The amino acids at positions 313 and 268 of the SHMT consensus sequence (Fig. 1) are always either a glycine or an alanine. It is assumed that replacing a small, neutral amino acid with a larger acidic or polar one warps the secondary structure of SHMT enough to disrupt its enzymatic function. Eukaryotic forms of the SHMT holoenzyme exist as tetramers of identical subunits, and the predicted secondary structure contains alternating helices and strands, placing SHMT in the α/β class of proteins (5Usha R. Savithri H.S. Rao N.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1204: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 reveals that there are 22 completely conserved glycines in the SHMT consensus sequence. Most of the conserved glycines are located at predicted turns, indicating a probable tertiary structural conservation (5Usha R. Savithri H.S. Rao N.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1204: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This suggests that these glycines are structurally important, being located at turns, at positions where helices cross, or at other constrained locations. The importance of having a glycine at five of these positions is proven by this work. In allele t1576, glycine 372 is changed to arginine; in allele t1679, glycine 143 is changed to aspartic acid; in alleles t1552, t1632, and t1665, conserved glycines 204, 406, and 149, respectively, are all changed to glutamic acids. Replacing these constrained glycines with large charged groups probably has a deleterious effect on the structure of SHMT. Two of the mutations cause alanine to valine alterations, t1666 (alanine 103) and s2518 (alanine 126). These residues are conserved alanines in the SHMT consensus sequence. We assume there are very strong structural constraints at these positions, as the conservative change of an alanine to a valine disrupts the structure enough to affect SHMT activity. A single PCR product could not be obtained for allele t1666 with primer set B in the heteroduplex analysis, but the point mutation does not interfere with the primer binding site (Fig. 3.). To eliminate the possibility that t1666 contained a second mutation in one of the B primer binding sites, the overlapping regions, A and C, were sequenced. Neither region contained a mutation, so the failure of this allele to yield a single PCR product with the B primer set remains a mystery. Allele t1473 contains a double mutation, as suggested by the heteroduplex analysis where region A and B both indicated the position of a mutation. Alanine 63 is changed to valine, and leucine 146 is changed to phenylalanine. Residue 63 is an alanine four out of six times in the SHMT consensus sequence, but the E. coliprotein has an arginine at this position, so we assume that changing this alanine to valine would have a minimal steric effect. However, residue 146 is a conserved leucine in the SHMT consensus sequence, suggesting that the leucine to phenylalanine missense mutation is the primary cause of the mutant phenotype in allele t1473. In alleles t1671 and t1520, serine 251 is changed to phenylalanine. Residue 251 is only three amino acids away from the active site and is always small in the SHMT consensus sequence. The replacement of this small amino acid with a large aromatic one probably distorts the conformation of the active site and may also interfere with the PLP aromatic ring. In allele t1607, histidine 259 is changed to tyrosine. The mutation in allele t1607, residue 259 in the SHMT consensus sequence, is the only one from our collection that has been mutated previously. This histidine is in the conserved active site VTTTTHK(S/T) motif found in all SHMTs and is adjacent to the active site lysine. Every residue in this motif, except the valine, has been mutated in the E. coli isoform of SHMT to determine the effects on catalysis (Fig. 1.). When the active site histidine is changed to asparagine, there is no structural change in the enzyme, but the catalytic activity is greatly reduced (25Hopkins S. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3363-3369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the active site histidine is changed to aspartic acid, the activity of the physiological reactions is reduced, but the activity of some alternate reactions is increased (26Stover P. Zamora M. Shostak K. Gautam-Basak M. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17679-17687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A series of kinetic and spectral studies on these mutant enzymes revealed that the active site histidine is not catalytically essential and is not the base that accepts the α proton. These studies have also shown that the active site histidine interacts with the amino acid substrate or PLP. This histidine is believed to have a critical role in determining reaction specificity by determining the structure of the one-carbon binding site and controlling the orientation of the substrate and PLP ring (25Hopkins S. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3363-3369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Stover P. Zamora M. Shostak K. Gautam-Basak M. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17679-17687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because E. coli SHMT is catalytically active without an active site histidine, it is unlikely that the imidazole ring of histidine 259 participates as an electron donor or acceptor in the physiological reactions of CeSHMT. In allele t1607, inserting the aromatic ring of tyrosine at the active site may change the environment of the PLP aromatic ring such that it is no longer in line with critical residues required for catalysis. The PLP and substrate binding pocket would also be distorted. The E. coli active site is VTTTTHKT. Each of the threonine residues in this motif was changed to an alanine to determine the kinetic and spectral properties of the mutant enzymes (27Angelaccio S. Pascarella S. Fattori E. Bossa F. Strong W. Schirch V. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). When the first or fourth threonine is converted to alanine, the enzyme is essentially wild-type. When the second or fifth threonine is changed to alanine, the mutants are structurally unchanged but have shifted kinetic properties. These results indicated that these four threonines do not play a critical role in the mechanism of SHMT. However, when the third threonine is mutated to an alanine, the enzyme loses 97% of its catalytic activity. When this residue is mutated to a serine, the activity is essentially wild-type, so the presence of a hydroxyl-containing side chain is very important. These studies also revealed that none of these threonines bind PLP (27Angelaccio S. Pascarella S. Fattori E. Bossa F. Strong W. Schirch V. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The active site lysine in E. coli has also been mutated. When this lysine is changed to a glutamine, the enzyme catalyzes one turnover of product at wild-type levels, but cannot release the product (28Schirch D. Delle Fratte S. Iurescia S. Angelaccio S. Contestabile R. Bossa F. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23132-23138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the lysine is changed to arginine or histidine, the PLP cofactor cannot readily form the external aldimine. These results suggest that the active site lysine expels the product by converting the external aldimine to an internal aldimine and that lysine is not the base that removes the α proton of the substrate. It has been proposed that there are two bases at the active site of SHMT on opposite sides of the PLP ring (29Shostak K. Schirch V. Bioch"

https://openalex.org/W2027196450,"The pre-steady-state phase of the oxygenase reaction of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase with cis,cis-eicosa-11,14-dienoic acid has been studied using stopped flow techniques. Because some intermediate forms of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase are spectrally indistinguishable, the enzyme and substrate transformations were monitored in parallel to simplify the interpretation of the kinetics. Over a wide range of conditions, the formation of the enzyme intermediate II, the form of compound I containing the tyrosyl radical, precedes substrate oxidation. This result supports the occurrence of a unimolecular conversion of compound I into intermediate II. Furthermore, the rate of intermediate II formation was stimulated by increased concentration of dienoic acid, perhaps because of increased occupation of the fatty acid binding site. The importance of the unimolecular formation of intermediate II was confirmed by simulated kinetics of the oxygenase reaction. These results provide evidence that intermediate II is the primary oxidant in the reaction of prostaglandin synthase with the dienoic acid, as it is with arachidonic acid."
