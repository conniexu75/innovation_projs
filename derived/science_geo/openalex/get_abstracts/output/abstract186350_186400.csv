https://openalex.org/W1980811848,"Skeletal muscle formation and growth require the fusion of myoblasts to form multinucleated myofibers or myotubes, but few molecules are known to regulate myoblast fusion in mammals. The transcription factor NFATc2 controls myoblast fusion at a specific stage of myogenesis after the initial formation of a myotube and is necessary for further cell growth. By examining genes regulated by NFATc2 in muscle, this study identifies the cytokine IL-4 as a molecular signal that controls myoblast fusion with myotubes. Muscle cells lacking IL-4 or the IL-4alpha receptor subunit form normally but are reduced in size and myonuclear number. IL-4 is expressed by a subset of muscle cells in fusing muscle cultures and requires the IL-4alpha receptor subunit on myoblasts to promote fusion and growth. These data demonstrate that following myotube formation, myotubes recruit myoblast fusion by secretion of IL-4, leading to muscle growth."
https://openalex.org/W2120646148,"DNA in eukaryotic cells is associated with histone proteins; hence, hallmark properties of apoptosis, such as chromatin condensation, may be regulated by posttranslational histone modifications. Here we report that phosphorylation of histone H2B at serine 14 (S14) correlates with cells undergoing programmed cell death in vertebrates. We identify a 34 kDa apoptosis-induced H2B kinase as caspase-cleaved Mst1 (mammalian sterile twenty) kinase. Mst1 can phosphorylate H2B at S14 in vitro and in vivo, and the onset of H2B S14 phosphorylation is dependent upon cleavage of Mst1 by caspase-3. These data reveal a histone modification that is uniquely associated with apoptotic chromatin in species ranging from frogs to humans and provide insights into a previously unrecognized physiological substrate for Mst1 kinase. Our data provide evidence for a potential apoptotic ""histone code."""
https://openalex.org/W1998879017,"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is one of several neurological disorders caused by a CAG repeat expansion. In SCA1, this expansion produces an abnormally long polyglutamine tract in the protein ataxin-1. Mutant polyglutamine proteins accumulate in neurons, inducing neurodegeneration, but the mechanism underlying this accumulation has been unclear. We have discovered that the 14-3-3 protein, a multifunctional regulatory molecule, mediates the neurotoxicity of ataxin-1 by binding to and stabilizing ataxin-1, thereby slowing its normal degradation. The association of ataxin-1 with 14-3-3 is regulated by Akt phosphorylation, and in a Drosophila model of SCA1, both 14-3-3 and Akt modulate neurodegeneration. Our finding that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling and 14-3-3 cooperate to modulate the neurotoxicity of ataxin-1 provides insight into SCA1 pathogenesis and identifies potential targets for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2072471477,"C(alpha)-formylglycine (FGly) is the catalytic residue in the active site of eukaryotic sulfatases. It is posttranslationally generated from a cysteine in the endoplasmic reticulum. The genetic defect of FGly formation causes multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD), a lysosomal storage disorder. We purified the FGly generating enzyme (FGE) and identified its gene and nine mutations in seven MSD patients. In patient fibroblasts, the activity of sulfatases is partially restored by transduction of FGE encoding cDNA, but not by cDNA carrying an MSD mutation. The gene encoding FGE is highly conserved among pro- and eukaryotes and has a paralog of unknown function in vertebrates. FGE is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and is predicted to have a tripartite domain structure."
https://openalex.org/W2083921257,"In multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD), a human inherited disorder, the activities of all sulfatases are impaired due to a defect in posttranslational modification. Here we report the identification, by functional complementation using microcell-mediated chromosome transfer, of a gene that is mutated in MSD and is able to rescue the enzymatic deficiency in patients' cell lines. Functional conservation of this gene was observed among distantly related species, suggesting a critical biological role. Coexpression of SUMF1 with sulfatases results in a strikingly synergistic increase of enzymatic activity, indicating that SUMF1 is both an essential and a limiting factor for sulfatases. These data have profound implications on the feasibility of enzyme replacement therapy for eight distinct inborn errors of metabolism."

To understand the fluxes involved in this conversion, a quantitative metabolic flux model was developed and tested for the reaction network of glycolysis and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP). Developing Brassica napus embryos were cultured with [U-13C6]glucose, [1-13C]glucose, [6-13C]glucose, [U-13C12]sucrose, and/or [1,2-13C2]glucose and the labeling patterns in amino acids, lipids, sucrose, and starch were measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and NMR. Data were used to verify a reaction network of central carbon metabolism distributed between the cytosol and plastid. Computer simulation of the steady state distribution of isotopomers in intermediates of the glycolysis/OPPP network was used to fit metabolic flux parameters to the experimental data. The observed distribution of label in cytosolic and plastidic metabolites indicated that key intermediates of glycolysis and OPPP have similar labeling in these two compartments, suggesting rapid exchange of metabolites between these compartments compared with net fluxes into end products. Cycling between hexose phosphate and triose phosphate and reversible transketolase velocity were similar to net glycolytic flux, whereas reversible transaldolase velocity was minimal. Flux parameters were overdetermined by analyzing labeling in different metabolites and by using data from different labeling experiments, which increased the reliability of the findings. Net flux of glucose through the OPPP accounts for close to 10% of the total hexose influx into the embryo. Therefore, the reductant produced by the OPPP accounts for at most 44% of the NADPH and 22% of total reductant needed for fatty acid synthesis.

Ohlrogge J.B. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The main storage compounds in seeds of B. napus are oil (triacylglycerols) and storage proteins, which are derived from sugars and amino acids taken up from the surrounding endosperm liquid (11King S.P. Lunn J.E. Badger M.R. Furbank R.T. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 31SCrossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 12King S.P. Lunn J.E. Furbank R.T.

Morley-Smith E.R. Rawsthorne S. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Because of its high oil content and ease of genetic transformation, B. napus has also been a target for metabolic engineering of oil metabolism. However, some attempts to engineer plant oils have had limited success (for a review, see Ref. 24Thelen J.J. Ohlrogge J.B. Metab. Eng. 2002; 4: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In order to make advances in improving oil yield and quality, a more detailed understanding of metabolism during seed development is needed. In particular, a number of fundamental metabolic issues remain unresolved. These include the source(s) of reductant and ATP for fatty acid synthesis; the degree to which cytosolic, plastidial, and mitochondrial metabolic fluxes are integrated; and the chief metabolic and transport route(s) by which carbon flows from maternal sources to seed storage products.Fatty acid synthesis has a high demand for reductant, and in other systems there is evidence that the supply of reductant can limit lipid accumulation (25Katz J. Landau B.R. Bartsch G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 727-740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Geer B.W. Lindel D.L. Lindel D.M. Biochem. Genet. 1979; 17: 881-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, determining the source of reductant for fatty acid synthesis in developing oil seeds is important, and in particular the contribution of NADPH made by the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP) 1The abbreviations used are: OPPP, oxidative pentose phosphate pathway; C18, octadecanoic acid; C18:1, octadecenoic acid; C22, eicosanoic acid; C22:1, docosenoic acid; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; Fru-6-P, fructose 6-phosphate; GAP, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; Glc-6-P, glucose 6-phosphate; GC, gas chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; PEP, phosphoenol pyruvate; Rib-5-P, ribose-5-phosphate; Ru-5-P, ribulose 5-phosphate; Suc, sucrose; TAG, triacylglycerol; TA, transaldolase; TK, transketolase; Xu-5-P, xylulose 5-phosphate; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.1The abbreviations used are: OPPP, oxidative pentose phosphate pathway; C18, octadecanoic acid; C18:1, octadecenoic acid; C22, eicosanoic acid; C22:1, docosenoic acid; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; Fru-6-P, fructose 6-phosphate; GAP, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; Glc-6-P, glucose 6-phosphate; GC, gas chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; PEP, phosphoenol pyruvate; Rib-5-P, ribose-5-phosphate; Ru-5-P, ribulose 5-phosphate; Suc, sucrose; TAG, triacylglycerol; TA, transaldolase; TK, transketolase; Xu-5-P, xylulose 5-phosphate; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. to fatty acid synthesis is not known. Of the two reducing steps of fatty acid synthesis, in vitro data indicate that the first (3-ketoacyl-ACP reductase; EC 1.1.1.100) requires NADPH (27Sheldon P.S. Kekwick R.G.O. Smith C.G. Sidebottom C. Slabas A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1120: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), whereas the second (enoyl-ACP reductase, EC 1.3.1.9) requires NADH (28Slabas A.R. Sidebottom C.M. Hellyer A. Kessel R.M.J. Tombs M.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 877: 271-280Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). NADH can be provided by the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction in plastids, whereas it has long been thought that NADPH for reductive syntheses in nonphotosynthetic plastids is produced by the OPPP (29Neuhaus H.E. Emes M.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 51: 111-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). However, reductant could also be provided by steps in glycolysis (e.g. GAP-dehydrogenase; EC 1.2.1.13), by photosystems of green seeds, or by the import into the plastid of reducing equivalents generated in the mitochondria or cytosol. Thus, the OPPP represents one of several possible sources of reductant for oil synthesis in seeds, and the in vivo contribution of these alternatives has not been established.In recent years, it has become clear that measuring fluxes through the OPPP presents technical challenges and requires careful experimental design and interpretation. The effects of cycling among hexose, triose, and pentose pools via reversible reactions leads to label redistributions that must be quantitatively considered if one is to understand the sources of carbon and reductant (30Roscher A. Kruger N.J. Ratcliffe R.G. J. Biotechnol. 2000; 77: 81-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Understanding flux through metabolic networks that involve reversible, branching, and parallel pathways has been greatly aided by the development of steady state labeling methods using stable isotopes and isotopomer analysis (31Dieuaide-Noubhani M. Raffard G. Canioni P. Pradet A. Raymond P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13147-13159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 32Edwards S. Nguyen B.T. Do B. Roberts J.K.M.

Chem. 2002; 46: 43948-43960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Analysis of isotopomer distributions in intermediates and end-products of metabolism can provide information on the relative fluxes through alternative pathways and on flux ratios at branch points between pathways (see, for example, Refs. 35Szyperski T. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 41-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 36Dauner M. Sauer U. Biotechnol. Prog. 2000; 16: 642-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 37Wittmann C. Heinzle E. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1999; 62: 739-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). With in vivo labeling, this approach yields quantitative information on systems unperturbed by cell disruption, mutations, or transgenic manipulation. The results of this approach can therefore distinguish the relative contributions of competing pathways and help guide rational engineering of metabolism.To take advantage of such methods, we have recently established culture conditions for developing B. napus embryos that mimic in planta growth and allow steady state labeling during storage product accumulation (22Schwender J. Ohlrogge J. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 347-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). After feeding 13C-labeled carbon sources, the labeling pattern of various intermediates of central carbon metabolism are “imprinted” on seed oil and on the amino acids of seed protein; these can be measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and by NMR spectroscopy. Using these techniques, we deduced that the pyruvate that provides acetyl-CoA units for fatty acid is derived from Glc almost entirely by glycolytic cleavage (Embden-Meyerhof pathway) and that glycolysis rather than the OPPP accounts for most embryo hexose catabolism. Based on a preliminary analysis of labeling in fatty acids, we estimated that the net flux of Glc-6-P into OPPP is in the range of 5–10% of total influx of Glc-6-P. However, this preliminary estimate was based on making key assumptions about the reversibilities of transketolase (TK; EC 2.2.1.1) and transaldolase (TA; EC 2.2.1.2). In the present study, we have developed a quantitative model of glycolysis and OPPP and tested its ability to account for isotopomer labeling patterns and to yield reliable flux parameters in developing B. napus seeds.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—[U-13C6]Glc, [1,2-13C2]Glc, [1-13C]Glc, [6-13C]Glc, and [2-13C]Glc (all 99% 13C abundance) were purchased from Isotec (Miamisgurg, OH) and Omicron (South Bend, IN). Methoxyamine hydrochloride, α-amylase (EC 3.2.1.1) and Aspergillus niger amyloglucosidase (EC 3.2.1.3) were purchased from Sigma.Growth in the Presence of 13C-Labeled Sugars—Oilseed rape plants (B. napus L., cv. Reston) were grown as described before (22Schwender J. Ohlrogge J. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 347-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Siliques were harvested 20 days after flowering, and embryos were immediately dissected under aseptic conditions and transferred into culture medium (22Schwender J. Ohlrogge J. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 347-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In order to obtain fully labeled TAG and seed protein for analysis by GC/MS, five embryos were isolated at the early stage of oil accumulation (0.5–1 mg of fresh weight) and were grown for 14 days, each in 5 ml of growth medium under low light conditions (continuous light, 50 μmol m–2 s–1) under aseptic conditions. The growth medium contained Suc (80 mm), Glc (40 mm) and amino acids as carbon sources in concentrations that closely mimic in planta conditions during maximal oil synthesis (22Schwender J. Ohlrogge J. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 347-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). For different labeling experiments, part of the Glc or Suc was replaced by 13C-labeled sugars. A 1:10 isotopic dilution of 13C-labeled Glc was achieved by a mixture of, for example, [1,2-13C2]Glc/Glc/Suc (10:10:80) (mol % hexose units) or, in the case of uniformly 13C-labeled sugars, by a mixture of [U-13C6]Glc/Glc/[U-13C12]Suc/Suc (2:18:8:72) (mol % hexose units). Experiments with Glc labeled in different positions were also performed using, for example, [1-13C]Glc/[1,2-13C2]Glc/Suc (10:10:80) (mol % hexose units).In some experiments aimed at analysis of intermediates and starch, embryos were labeled for 3 days. In one such experiment, embryos were cultured with [U-13C6]Glc/Glc/[U-13C12]Suc/Suc (2:18:8:72) (mol % hexose units), and after 3 days labeled Suc, free amino acids, and starch were extracted and analyzed by GC/MS methods. In other experiments aimed at labeling free Suc and starch, 50 embryos in the early stage of oil accumulation (2–3 mg fresh weight) were grown for 3 days in 20 ml of growth medium with either [1-13C]Glc or [6-13C]Glc (99% 13C enrichment, 20 mm). Since Suc labeled at C-1 or C-6 of hexose units was not available, Suc in the growth medium was substituted by its analog palatinose (6-O-α-d-glucopyranosyl-d-fructofuranose, 80 mm), which is not taken up or metabolized in plants but which appears to have similar signal functions to Suc (38Fernie A.R. Roessner U. Geigenberger P. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 1967-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, in these experiments, the main carbohydrate carbon source was the labeled Glc, and the starch and seed oil in the embryos were substantially labeled. These experiments yielded 1–10 mg of free Suc, Glc (from starch), and seed oil for analysis by NMR spectroscopy. To ensure that the palatinose in the growth medium has no major artificial influence on the results, analogous experiments using [1-13C]Glc with unlabeled sucrose were also performed, which confirmed the experimental results with palatinose although with inferior accuracy due to the isotopic dilution of label from the unlabeled sucrose.Extraction of Lipids and Proteins—Labeled embryos were ground, and lipids were extracted with hexane/diethylether (1:1, v/v); proteins were extracted in a buffer containing sodium phosphate, pH 7.5 (10 mm), and NaCl (500 mm) as described by Schwender and Ohlrogge (22Schwender J. Ohlrogge J. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 347-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Extracted soluble proteins were precipitated by the addition of one-tenth volume of 50% trichloroacetic acid.Extraction of Sucrose—Embryos labeled for 3 days were ground in a glass homogenizer in methanol/H2O (1:1) (v/v) and extracted three times at 50 °C. The combined extracts were separated into a water-soluble and a lipid fraction by adding chloroform to a final ratio close to CHCl3/methanol/H2O (8:4:3) (39Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The aqueous phase containing mainly Suc was freeze-dried and dissolved in D2O for NMR analysis.Starch Degradation—After extraction of lipids and water/methanol-soluble compounds, the cell residue (equivalent to 50–100 mg fresh weight tissue) was washed three times with 5 ml of 80% (v/v) aqueous methanol and dried under vacuum. After the addition of 1 ml of H2O and sealing and heating at 110 °C for 1 h, starch was degraded to Glc by the addition of 1 ml of 0.1 m acetate buffer (pH 4.8), 20 units α-amylase, and 20 units amyloglucosidase with heating to 55 °C for 3 h. Proteins were precipitated by the addition of 1 volume of ethanol, sealing and heating to 100 °C for 5 min, and centrifugation. The supernatant was reduced in volume by evaporation under nitrogen, freeze-dried, and dissolved in D2O for 13C NMR spectroscopy or derivatized for GC/MS analysis.Measurement of Glucose Labeling—For analysis by GC/MS, Glc was derivatized to Glc methoxime penta-acetate. 1 ml of methoxyamine hydrochloride in pyridine (20 mg/ml) was added to 50–100 μg of Glc and heated to 50 °C for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, 1 ml of acetic acid anhydride was added, and the sample was again heated to 50 °C for 1 h. Finally, the derivative was extracted with toluene after adding 1 volume of H2O to the reaction. The ions m/z 360, m/z 289, and m/z 89 (C15H22O9N (Glc(1–6)), 2Carbon atoms in different molecules are denoted as subscripts. For example, Glc(1–3) refers to the part of the molecule comprising carbons 1, 2, and 3 of Glc, and pyruvate(1–2) refers to carbons 1 and 2 of pyruvate. C12H17O9N (Glc(3–6)), and C3H7O2N (Glc(1–2)), respectively) were monitored by GC/MS.Measurement of Lipid Labeling—For analysis by GC/MS or 13C NMR, the lipid fraction consisting mainly of TAG was hydrogenated (40Bao X.M. Focke M. Pollard M. Ohlrogge J. Plant J. 2000; 22: 39-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For analysis of fatty acids and glycerol by GC/MS, lipids were transesterified by heating to 90 °C in 5% (w/v) HCl in methanol for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, 1 volume of H2O was added, and fatty acid methyl esters were extracted with hexane (41Browse J. McCourt P. Somerville C. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 152: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The aqueous phase was freeze-dried, and the residue, containing glycerol, was derivatized with trifluoroacetic acid anhydride for 1 h at room temperature to obtain glycerol trifluoroacetate. Residual derivatization reagent was removed with a stream of nitrogen, and the derivatives were dissolved in toluene.Measurement of Label in Amino Acids of Storage Proteins—Proteins were hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl for 24 h at 100 °C. HCl was evaporated at 50 °C under a stream of nitrogen. Amino acids were dissolved in 0.1 n HCl and loaded on an H+ exchange column (AG 50W-X4; Bio-Rad). After washing with 5 volumes of H2O, amino acids were eluted with 2 n NH4OH. After most of the NH4OH was removed under a stream of nitrogen, the sample was lyophilized and then derivatized to their N,O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl derivatives by adding 100 μl of N-methyl-N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide/acetonitrile (1:1) to 100 μg of amino acids and heating at 120 °C for 1 h (36Dauner M.

Chromatogr. 1987; 392: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The identities of different fragments of the TBDMS amino acid derivatives in mass spectra were derived from the literature (36Dauner M. Sauer U. Biotechnol.

Chromatogr. 1987; 392: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).GC Conditions—One microliter of each derivatized sample (100–500 ng/μl) was analyzed with a HP 5890 II (Hewlett-Packard) gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (HP 5972 quadrupole MS). Carrier gas was helium at 1 ml/min. For fatty acid methyl esters, a DB23 column (30 m × 0.25 mm) was used (J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA). For N,O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl derivatives of amino acids, Glc methoxime penta-acetate, and glycerol trifluoroacetate, a 30 m × 0.25-mm DB1 column was used (J&W Scientific). The GC conditions for fatty acid methyl esters and N,O(S)-tert-butyldimethylsilyl derivatives of amino acids were as previously described (22Schwender J. Ohlrogge J. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 347-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). For glycerol trifluoroacetate, the injector temperature was 250 °C. Initial temperature was 60 °C for 2 min, increased to 240 °C at 20 °C/min and a final temperature at 240 °C for 10 min. Data were analyzed by the Chem Station Program (HP G1043C, Hewlett-Packard).Measurement of Fractional Labeling by Mass Spectrometry—In mass spectra of labeled compounds, selected molecular fragments were monitored. Single ion monitoring was generally used with >20-ms acquisition time for each ion. The mass spectra of each ion were integrated over the entire chromatographic peak to avoid the influence of possible isotope fractionation during GC separation. Background correction was performed with mass spectra taken just before each chromatographic peak. Reproducibility of isotope ratios was checked with unlabeled reference substances over a concentration range of 2 orders of magnitude. The ion clusters were corrected for natural isotope abundance in heteroatoms and in derivative residues as well as in the labeled molecule (43Lee W.N.P. Byerley L.O. Bergner E.A. Edmond J. Biol. Mass Spectrom. 1991; 20: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The molar abundances of molecule fragments containing i labeled carbons are referred to as m i. The identity of ions was checked by comparison of the measured mass distribution of a fragment of unlabeled compounds with the theoretical distribution, as derived from the elemental composition and natural isotope abundances (43Lee W.N.P. Byerley L.O. Bergner E.A. Edmond J. Biol. Mass Spectrom. 1991; 20: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Only fragments that were in good agreement with the theoretical mass distribution were used for measurements. In the case of TBDMS-amino acids and Glc methoxime penta-acetate, the ion purity was also verified by derivatization of 13C-labeled amino acids (hydrolysis of U-13C-labeled protein, 99% 13C; Isotec) and Glc ([1-13C]Glc, [6-13C]Glc, [1,2-13C2]Glc, and [U-13C6]Glc), respectively, which leads to mass shifts of the isotopomer clusters defined by the presence of one or more 13C-labeled carbon atoms in the monitored fragment. The fragmentation of glycerol trifluoroacetate during MS analysis was established by analogy to glycerol triacetate (44Neese R.A. Benowitz N.L. Hoh R. Faix D. LaBua A. Pun K. Hellerstein M.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: E1023-E1034PubMed Google Scholar). The fragment m/z 158 contains glycerol(1–3). In the mass spectra of saturated fatty acid methyl esters, the ion m/z 74 can be used to measured labeling in C18(1–2) (22Schwender J. Ohlrogge J. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 347-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Since in the extracted TAG, C18:1 dominated over C18 and since fatty acids were hydrogenated before GC/MS analysis, the measured C18(1–2) represents mainly C18:1(1–2).Comparision of Measured and Simulated Labeling in Glucose by Least Squares Fitting—Embryos were labeled for 14 days with [U-13C12]Suc/[U-13C6]Glc (each diluted 1:10 with unlabeled sugar). Labeling in the glucosyl units of starch was measured by GC/MS. The fractional 13C enrichment was measured in the fragments Glc(1–2), Glc(3–6), and Glc(1–6). The measured mass isotopomers 3The molar abundances of molecule fragments containing i labeled carbons are referred to as m i. m 1 and m 2 of Glc(1–2), m 1 to m 4 of Glc(3–6), and m 1 to m 6 of Glc(1–6) were compared with values predicted by the computer model. For each mass isotopomer i, the difference between measurement and prediction (Δi) was calculated. The sum of squared differences (ΣΔi2) was calculated as a measure for the similarity between measured and predicted mass isotopomers. By variation of the model parameters X, V TK, V TA, and V TPC, minima for ΣΔi2 were determined as shown in Figs. 3 and 4.Fig. 4Optimized flux parameter values and obtaining a global solution by experimental over determination. Embryos were labeled for 14 days with [U-13C12]sucrose/[U-13C6]Glc. Glc obtained by starch hydrolysis was derivatized and analyzed by GC/MS (see “Experimental Procedures”). The measured fractional enrichment in fragments Glc(1–2), Glc(3–6), and Glc(1–6) was compared with the fractional enrichments predicted by the model. The sum of squared differences (ΣΔi2; see “Experimental Procedures”) was calculated for a range of values in the V TK/V TA plane, with V TPC = 1.0. A, contour map showing lines of equal ΣΔi2 in the V TK/V TA plane. These contour lines were calculated using V TPC = 1 and X = 0.12. The contour line of ΣΔi2 = 2 × 10–4 surrounds an area (shaded) that corresponds to the limits of confidence that we place around the combination of V TK and V TA values (black point), which gives the best fit to the experimental data (where ΣΔi2 has its minimum). Depending on the value of X, the best fit combination of V TK and V TA changes (dashed arrow). Two such additional points are shown that correspond to V TK/V TA values that yield minima in ΣΔi2 when X = 0.05 and X = 0 (open circles). B shows the results of optimization of the fit for V TA and X for the same experiment and for A. In this case, there is no single minimum for ΣΔi2 but instead a set of points indicated by the dashed line with a confidence area again based on a 2 × 10–4 threshold for ΣΔi2 shaded in gray. The results of optimizing the fit for V TA and X for an experiment with [1,2-13C2]Glc/[1-13C]Glc (1:1) are also shown in B. In this case, mass spectroscopic data from C18:1(1–2) showing a m 1/m 2 ratio of 1.24 ± 0.04 (n = 3 independent experiments) was measured. A second dashed line shows the set of V TA/X points for which the simulated m 1/m 2 ratio matches the experimental value best. The area where m 1/m 2 = 1.24 ± 0.04 is indicated in gray. The two sets of optimized values for X and V TA for the two experiments intersect at X = 0.12, V TA = 0.01. This point defines a single overall optimum for the parameters X, V TK, V TA, and V TPC. The resulting confidence interval for X is indicated by a double-headed arrow along the x axis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)NMR Analysis—NMR analyses of aqueous extracts (containing predominantly Suc) of Glc (isolated from starch) and of storage lipids (mainly triacylglycerols) were performed with a Varian VXR 500 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm 13C-1H switchable probe. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured with a 90° pulse angle, 1H waltz decoupling during acquisition only (for 13C spectra), and full relaxation (recycle times = 60 s). Data processing included zero filling and multiplication of the free induction decays by an exponential function to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. NMR peak assignment for Glc, Suc, and TAG was performed using literature values (45Shachar-Hill Y. Pfeffer P.E. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance in Plant Biology.

https://openalex.org/W2007263769,"The liver is capable of completely regenerating itself in response to injury and after partial hepatectomy. In liver of old animals, the proliferative response is dramatically reduced, the mechanism for which is unknown. The liver specific protein, C/EBPalpha, normally arrests proliferation of hepatocytes through inhibiting cyclin dependent kinases (cdks). We present evidence that aging switches the liver-specific pathway of C/EBPalpha growth arrest to repression of E2F transcription. We identified an age-specific C/EBPalpha-Rb-E2F4 complex that binds to E2F-dependent promoters and represses these genes. The C/EBPalpha-Rb-E2F4 complex occupies the c-myc promoter and blocks induction of c-myc in livers of old animals after partial hepatectomy. Our results show that the age-dependent switch from cdk inhibition to repression of E2F transcription causes a loss of proliferative response in the liver because of an inability to induce E2F target genes after partial hepatectomy providing a possible mechanism for the age-dependent loss of liver regenerative capacity."

A number of protein kinases are known to be localized within mitochondria, including pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase Cδ, stress-activated protein kinase, and A-Raf, as well as an unidentified tyrosine kinase (1Thomson M.

While such methods provide information concerning the capability of these proteins to be phosphorylated during the actual time period of radiolabeling, they do not identify proteins already phosphorylated to significant levels prior to the labeling step. In addition, metabolically incorporating radiolabels, using standard doses and time courses, have previously been shown to induce DNA fragmentation, elevate p53 tumor suppressor protein levels, alter cell/nuclear morphology, and result in cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (11Yeargin J.

However, no broad-spectrum phosphoamino acid-reactive antibodies exist, and although high quality antibodies to phosphotyrosine residues are available, antibodies that specifically recognize phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues are typically sensitive to amino acid sequence context and do not provide universal detection of proteins phosphorylated at these sites (15Kaufmann H. Bailey J. Fussenegger M. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Consequently, even when three different immunoblots are probed with antibodies raised against the three most common phosphoamino acids, there is no guarantee that an exhaustive analysis of phosphoproteins has been achieved. Recently, a detailed human heart mitochondrial proteome data base of 615 proteins was generated using a combination of our sucrose gradient fractionation and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis method (16Hanson B.J. Schulenberg B. Patton W.F. Capaldi R.A. Electrophoresis. 2001; 22: 950-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), followed by mass spectrometry (17Taylor S.W. Fahy E. Zhang B. Glenn G.M.

We demonstrate an important extension of this approach for the comprehensive analysis of the mitochondrial phospho-proteome, using the sucrose gradient fractionation/gel electrophoresis separation approach in concert with fluorescence-based multiplexed proteomics staining technology and mass spectrometry (16Hanson B.J. Schulenberg B. Patton W.F. Capaldi R.A. Electrophoresis. 2001; 22: 950-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 18Patton W. Beechem J. Curr. Opin. Chem.

Mitochondrial multisubunit protein complexes are first separated by size using sucrose gradient centrifugation, and the individual subunits are then resolved by one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Subsequently, gels are fluorescently stained and imaged to reveal phosphorylation levels using a fluorescent phosphosensor dye (Pro-Q Diamond dye) followed by staining and imaging to reveal protein expression levels using a fluorescent total protein indicator (SYPRO® Ruby dye (Molecular Probes, Inc.))

Finally, peptide mass fingerprinting by MALDI-TOF 1The abbreviations used are: MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; ANT, adenine nucleotide translocase. mass spectrometry is employed to identify the phosphoproteins revealed by the dichromatic staining technique. This study is the first successful application of Multiplexed Proteomics technology to the discovery of novel phosphoproteins in a complex biological specimen. Fractionation of Mitochondria by Protein Complex Molecular Weight—Mitochondria were prepared from bovine heart as described previously (16Hanson B.J. Schulenberg B. Patton W.F. Capaldi R.A. Electrophoresis. 2001; 22: 950-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Purified mitochondria were then pelleted at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C (TLA100.2 rotor, Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, CA) and resuspended at a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml with 100 mm Tris/HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% lauryl maltoside, as well as 1/100 volume phosphatase inhibitor mixtures1 and 2 (Sigma). Mitochondria were incubated in the solution for 20 min on ice with stirring, before the extracted membranes were pelleted at 174,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was then layered on top of 4.5 ml of a15–35% sucrose step gradient. The gradient was centrifuged for 16.5 h at 128,000 × g at 4 °C using an SW 50.1 rotor. The sucrose gradient was fractionated into 500-μl aliquots, which were frozen at -80 °C. Proteins were quantified by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) solution assay using bovine serum albumin as the protein standard (22Smith P. Krohn R. Hermanson G. Mallia A. Gartner F. Provenzano M. Fujimoto E. Goeke N. Olson B. Klenk D. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). Phosphoprotein Separation and Detection Procedures—SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed by standard methods (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Proteins were concentrated using a chloroform/methanol precipitation procedure (24Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar) before resuspension in sample buffer and heating for 5 min at 95 °C. Samples were cooled to room temperature before gel loading and electrophoresis. For two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, mitochondrial proteins were prepared as described previously (16Hanson B.J. Schulenberg B. Patton W.F. Capaldi R.A. Electrophoresis. 2001; 22: 950-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). All samples were precipitated before two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to minimize unspecific staining due to phospholipids and other cell constituents. Approximately 100–150 μg of protein was separated for 80,000 V-h on pH 3–10 Immobiline Drystrip-immobilized pH gradient gels (Amersham Biosciences). After isoelectric focusing, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed using an Investigator two-dimensional system (Genomic Solutions, Ann Arbor, MI). Fluorescent staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels using Pro-Q Diamond phosphoprotein gel stain (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was performed by fixing the gels in 45% methanol, 5% acetic acid overnight, washing with three changes of deionized water for 10 to 20 min per wash, followed by incubation in Pro-Q Diamond phosphoprotein gel stain for 180 min, and destaining with successive washes of 15% 1,2-propanediol or 4% acetonitrile in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0. Useful images could be obtained 3 h after staining, employing three successive destaining washes. Following image acquisition, gels were stained for total protein with SYPRO Ruby protein gel stain (Molecular Probes) for serial dichromatic detection, permitting comparison of phosphoprotein and total protein profiles (20Berggren K. Chernokalskaya E. Steinberg T.H. Kemper C. Lopez M.F. Diwu Z. Haugland R.P. Patton W.F. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 2509-2521Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 21Berggren K. Schulenberg B. Lopez M. Steinberg T. Bogdanova A. Smejkal G. Wang A. Patton W. Proteomics. 2002; 2: 486-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Images were acquired on a Fuji FLA 3000 laser scanner (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) with 532 nm excitation and 580 nm band pass emission filter for Pro-Q Diamond dye detection and with 473 nm excitation and 580 nm band pass emission filter for SYPRO Ruby dye detection. For two-dimensional gels, computer-generated differential display maps of protein phosphorylation and protein expression patterns were generated using Z3 software (Compugen, Tel-Aviv, Israel) (25Smilansky Z. Electrophoresis. 2001; 22: 1616-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). With this system, spots from the reference gel appear green and those from the comparative gel appear magenta. When images are aligned, similarly intense spots in the overlay image appear gray or black, while those that differ in intensity levels appear green or magenta. This facilitates identification of differentially expressed protein spots by simple visual inspection. Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry—After detecting proteins in polyacrylamide gels with Pro-Q Diamond phosphoprotein gel stain and staining with SYPRO Ruby protein gel stain, protein bands were subjected to trypsin digestion and mass spectrometry, as described previously (19Steinberg, T., Agnew, B. Gee, K., Leung, W., Goodman, T., Schulenberg, B., Hendrickson, J., Beechem, J., Haugland, R., and Patton, W. (2003) Proteomics, in pressGoogle Scholar, 26Aggeler R. Coons J. Taylor S.W. Ghosh S.S.

Mass spectrometry was performed using an Axima CFR MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Kratos Analytical, Chestnut Ridge, NY) with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV, and profiles were internally calibrated using trypsin auto-proteolytic fragments. Peptide-mass fingerprinting data were evaluated using the Kratos Launchpad analysis package and the Protein Prospector data base. Western Blotting—Large format one-dimensional gels were electro-blotted according to published protocols (27Hart C. Schulenberg B. Diwu Z. Leung W.Y. Patton W.F. Electrophoresis. 2003; 24: 599-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acid-specific antibodies were visualized by chemiluminescence using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciencs). The anti-phosphoserine antibody was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA), whereas the anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-phosphothreonine antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Multiplexed Proteomics Analysis of Steady-state Protein Phosphorylation—A novel fluorescent phosphorylation sensor, referred to as Pro-Q Diamond dye, was recently described that is capable of detecting phosphorylated proteins in polyacrylamide gels (19Steinberg, T., Agnew, B. Gee, K., Leung, W., Goodman, T., Schulenberg, B., Hendrickson, J., Beechem, J., Haugland, R., and Patton, W. (2003) Proteomics, in pressGoogle Scholar). This study utilizes the technology to analyze the steady-state levels of phosphoproteins in mitochondria. Pro-Q Diamond dye has been shown to discriminate between phosphorylated and unphosphorylated proteins with a high specific-to-nonspecific staining ratio using several model proteins (19Steinberg, T., Agnew, B. Gee, K., Leung, W., Goodman, T., Schulenberg, B., Hendrickson, J., Beechem, J., Haugland, R., and Patton, W. (2003) Proteomics, in pressGoogle Scholar). However, in cells or organelles, the dynamic range of protein abundance can span six orders of magnitude. For this reason it is important to define the total protein profile, as was done in this case using SYPRO Ruby dye. The ratio of the Pro-Q Diamond dye signal to the SYPRO Ruby dye signal provides a measure of the phosphorylation levels with respect to amounts of each protein in the sample. Since both dyes bind to proteins noncovalently, phosphoproteins may subsequently be identified by standard peptide mass profiling procedures. Fig. 1 shows a representative SDS-polyacrylamide gel of the sucrose gradient fractions 1–9, as well as unfractionated bovine heart mitochondria, stained with Pro-Q Diamond dye (Fig. 1A) and then subsequently with SYPRO Ruby dye (Fig. 1B). Several proteins are obviously stained with the phosphoprotein-selective dye, and these proteins do not in general correspond to the most abundant proteins in the gradient fractions. As an example of the differential staining, the gel lane containing fraction 2 of the sucrose gradient was investigated further using image analysis software. Electrophoretic profiles were obtained for the lane after Pro-Q Diamond dye staining and then after SYPRO Ruby dye staining. The overlay of the two profiles (Fig. 2) demonstrates that a ∼40-kDa protein is stained significantly by the phosphate-selective dye. There was little or no staining of the other proteins present in this lane, confirming the earlier studies showing that the background of nonspecific labeling of unphosphorylated proteins is low (19Steinberg, T., Agnew, B. Gee, K., Leung, W., Goodman, T., Schulenberg, B., Hendrickson, J., Beechem, J., Haugland, R., and Patton, W. (2003) Proteomics, in pressGoogle Scholar). The treatment of phosphoproteins or phosphopeptides with a strong base (0.1 m Ba(OH)2) eliminates phosphoric acid from phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues through a β-elimination reaction (28Byford M. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). β-Elimination experiments confirmed phosphorylation of the protein from gradient fraction 2. Using in-gel barium hydroxide treatment at 37 °C for 1 h, led to loss of up to 50% of the Pro-Q Diamond dye binding to the ∼40-kDa protein compared with an untreated control gel, whereas no Pro-Q Diamond signal was obtained from ovalbumin after β-elimination of the serine phosphate residues (data not shown).Fig. 2Fluorescence intensity profile of the gel lane corresponding to sucrose gradient fraction 2 obtained after staining with Pro-Q Diamond dye (black trace) or SYPRO Ruby dye (gray trace). The respective lanes from the gel are shown to the right of the line traces (PD = Pro-Q Diamond dye, SR = SYPRO Ruby dye). One prominent phosphoprotein was observed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As a first operational screen, a Pro-Q Diamond dye-to-SYPRO Ruby dye fluorescence ratio (D/S) that was 1.5 times the averaged ratio obtained with the nonphosphorylated molecular mass markers bovine serum albumin, phosphorylase b, carbonic anhydrase, and β-galactosidase (in this case 0.36) was used to define phosphoproteins in gels of sucrose gradient fractionated mitochondrial extracts. All ratios were corrected for molecular mass, since a protein with 100 kDa mass will bind more SYPRO Ruby dye molecules than a 50-kDa protein and result in a 50% lower D/S ratio for the larger protein. By the cited criterion, there were five prominent phosphoproteins revealed in the SDS-polyacrylamide gel analysis indicated in Fig. 1. Identification of the 42-kDa Protein as a Novel Phosphoprotein in Complex I—To further investigate the phosphorylation of the ∼40-kDa protein, sucrose gradient fraction 2 was separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, the spots excised, digested with trypsin, and subjected to mass spectrometry analysis. The peptide mass profile identified the protein unequivocally as the bovine homologue of human NDUFA10 of Complex I, the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. Complex I catalyzes the first step of the electron transport chain, the transfer of two electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, coupled to the translocation of four electrons across the membrane. It is found in the inner mitochondrial membrane as an assembly with molecular mass of over 900 kDa and consists of ∼46 subunits (29Carroll J. Shannon R.J. Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. Hirst J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50311-50317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 30Murray J. Zhang B. Taylor S.W. Oglesbee D. Fahy E. Marusich M.F. Ghosh S.S. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol.

The identification of NDUFA10 was further confirmed and extended in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis experiments. The phosphorylated protein migrated to a similar position as the 42-kDa protein (NDUFA10) annotated on a previously published map of bovine complex I (29Carroll J. Shannon R.J. Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. Hirst J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50311-50317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, SYPRO Ruby dye staining revealed five isoforms for the protein (spots 1–5), three of which were phosphorylated, based upon Pro-Q Diamond dye staining. The most straightforward interpretation of the staining patterns of the NDUFA10 isoforms is as follows: spots 1 and 2 are two unphosphorylated forms, different in charge through amino acid differences or post-translational modifications other than phosphorylation. Spots 3 and 4 are the phosphorylated forms of each or are the mono- and diphosphorylated forms of one of them. Spot 5 is a phosphorylated form of a third variant of the polypeptide, whose nonphosphorylated form is buried in spot 4. Notably, the intensity ratio of phosphate-to-protein in spot 4 is close to twice that in spot 3. As the Pro-Q Diamond dye signal intensity correlates with the number of phosphate residues on a protein (19Steinberg, T., Agnew, B. Gee, K., Leung, W., Goodman, T., Schulenberg, B., Hendrickson, J., Beechem, J., Haugland, R., and Patton, W. (2003) Proteomics, in pressGoogle Scholar), it appears that the isoform in spot 4 is doubly phosphorylated and in spot 3 singly phosphorylated. Based upon Western blot analysis (Fig. 4) NDUFA10 contains only phosphothreonine residues, while a cAMP phosphorylation motif scan of the polypeptide sequence using the ProSite data base program (31Gattiker A. Gasteiger E. Bairoch A. Appl. Bioinform. 2002; 1: 107-108PubMed Google Scholar) identified two threonine phosphorylation motifs, KKmT and KKvT. No potential sites of protein kinase A-mediated serine phosphorylation were uncovered by this analysis.Fig. 4Western blot analysis of NDUFA10 using three different phosphoamino acid-specific antibodies, as indicated to the left of each image. Detection was performed by chemiluminescence using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The analysis indicates that NDUFA10 contains phosphothreonine residues, but not phosphoserine or phosphotyrosine residues.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The 18-kDa subunit of complex I (human NDUFS 4) has previously been reported to be phosphorylated by a cAMP-dependent protein kinase using exogenously added kinase and [γ-32P]ATP or by anti-phosphoserine immunoblotting of proteins from mitoplasts of activated cells (5Sardanelli A.M.

Phosphorylation of this subunit was not observed here using the described Multiplexed Proteomics technology (see Fig. 2), suggesting that the protein is not typically phosphorylated to a significant extent in resting mitochondria. Other proteins besides NDUFA10 for which the ratio of Pro-Q Diamond dye staining to SYPRO Ruby dye staining was more than 1.5 times the average background are listed in Table I. These are adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT), isocitrate dehydrogenase, flavoprotein of succinate dehydrogenase, NAD(P) transhydrogenase, aconitase, and the phosphate carrier protein. The other proteins that reacted significantly with the Pro-Q Diamond stain, but did not produce the 1.5 ratio of phosphate to protein stain used in the first cut off, are listed in Table I. These include α and β subunits of complex V, core proteins I and II of complex III, and creatine kinase. A phosphoprotein of ∼40 kDa in sucrose gradient fractions 7 and 8 was identified by monoclonal antibody reaction as the E1α subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase, but the identity of this protein could not be confirmed by mass spectrometry, probably because the bovine sequence is significantly different from the human sequence used in the analysis. This latter group of proteins probably represents those for which only a fraction of the total are phosphorylated in the steady state under conditions present in heart tissue. It is important to note that some of the proteins listed in Table I have previously been identified as phosphoproteins (9Bykova N. Egsgaard H. Møller I.

Importantly it is clearly possible to distinguish between phosphorylation of the different isoforms of a polypeptide with this technology. Here we focus on NDUFA10 of Complex I, whose identification as a phosphoprotein is novel and intriguing. The phosphorylation of this subunit could serve two distinct functions. One might be to control the activity of Complex I through binding of NADH (33Yamaguchi M. Belogrudov G.I. Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267 (Tokyo): 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Additionally, since it has been noted that the NDUFA10 subunit of Complex I is easily lost during purification of complex I, the phosphorylation might influence the binding affinity of NDUFA10 and in turn regulate the amount of fully active Complex I in the inner-membrane of mitochondria. We are grateful to Dr. James Murray of the University of Oregon as well as Drs. Thomas Steinberg, Brian Agnew, and Richard Haugland of Molecular Probes, Inc. for intellectual contributions to this project. Their input was critical to the success of the research."

Thus, it is possible that other PR proteins may also be substrate-specific proteases. Of the genomes that have been completely sequenced, as many as 2% of the gene products encode known proteases, many of which regulate physiological processes such as blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, the complement system, and the processing of protein hormone precursors by specific convertases. Prohormones and neuropeptides (3–40 amino acids), important coordinators of cellular function in the endocrine and nervous systems, are often synthesized as propeptides. The propeptide is subsequently processed by substrate-specific proteases to yield the mature bioactive form (1Docherty K. Steiner D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1982; 44: 625-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). As many of the substrate-specific proteases remain unidentified, predicting new bioactive peptides from cDNA sequences is presently difficult, if not impossible (2Bogyo M. Ploegh H. Nature. 1998; 396: 625-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 3Nakai K. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 134: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Linderström-Lang coined the term “limited proteolysis” to describe enzymes with restricted specificity (4Linderström-Lang K. Otteseen M. Nature. 1947; 159: 807-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity can be restricted by substrate structure, enzyme processing state, endogenous protease inhibitor levels or a combination of these factors (5Neurath H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10962-10963Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Peptides derived from prohormones are typically flanked by a pair of dibasic residues (Lys-Arg, Arg-Arg, Lys-Lys, or Arg-Lys) and are cleaved by proteases found in secretory vesicles (1Docherty K. Steiner D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1982; 44: 625-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). However, many precursor peptides contain multiple sets of basic residues, suggesting that highly substrate specific or differentially expressed proteases can determine processing outcomes. The venom of cone snails (predatory marine molluscs of the genus Conus) has yielded a rich source of novel neuroactive peptides (“conotoxins”) (6Olivera B.M. Cruz L.J. Yoshikami D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, the enzymes responsible for cleaving the conotoxins from their propeptide precursors have not been isolated. Here we report the purification, cloning, and initial characterization of Tex31, a protease from venom Conus textile. Interestingly, Tex31 sequence was found to be homologous to members of the PR protein superfamily. Substrate Design and Activity Assay—Based on the cDNA sequence of the propeptide and the mature amino acid sequence of the TxVIA peptide, a δ-conotoxin contained in the venom of C. textile, propeptide cleavage site substrate analogues were designed. The peptidic para-nitroanilide (pNA) 1The abbreviations used are: pNA, para-nitroanilide; Bistris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; Abu, 2-aminobutyric acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; AEBSF, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride; PR, pathogenesis-related. substrate analogues were synthesized by solid phase synthesis (7Abbenante G. Leung D. Bond T. Fairlie D. Lett. Pept. Sci. 2001; 7: 347-351Google Scholar). A typical reaction mixture consisted of 100 mm Bistris propane, pH 8.5, 100 μm pNA substrate (acetyl-KLNKR-pNA or Ac-LNKR-pNA) and protease from an appropriate source. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. All assays were carried out in 96-well plates and their absorbance measured at 405 nm on a Spectromax spectrometer. To confirm Tex31 could cleave amide bonds, an 11-residue peptidic substrate (acetyl-KLNKRWAbuKQSG-NH2), which is made up of five residues N-terminal and six residues C-terminal to the propeptide cleavage site, was assembled on Rink amide MBHA resin (Novabiochem) using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) SPPS chemistry (8Alewood P.F. Croft M. Schnolzer M. Kent S.B.H. Giralt E. Andreu D. Peptides 1990. ESCOM, Leiden, The Netherlands1990: 174-175Google Scholar). To prevent any possible interaction arising from the presence of a free cysteine residue, which in the native conotoxin propeptide may be involved in a disulphide bond, it was replaced with the cysteine isostere 2-aminobutyric acid (Abu). The peptide was deprotected and cleaved from the solid support with 95% trifluoroacetic acid, 2.5% triisopropylsilane, and 2.5% water (25 ml/g of resin) for 1 h at room temperature. The crude peptide was purified by reversed-phase HPLC. A typical peptide substrate reaction mixture contained 100 mm Bistris propane, pH 8, 10 mm CaCl2, 80 μm peptide substrate, and SEC I (150 pmol) purified protease. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C and the rate of digestion monitored by reversed-phase HPLC. The masses of resulting peptide fragments were confirmed by mass spectrometry. Isolation and Purification of Tex31—Venom ducts from three C. textile specimens were removed and homogenized with a mortar and pestle in chilled extraction buffer (100 mm Bistris propane, pH 7, containing 0.1% Triton X-100). Extracted material was collected and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min (4 °C). The supernatant was concentrated with an Ultrafree 15 Biomax 5K cutoff centrifugal filter (Millipore) in preparation for the purification of Tex31. The Tex31 isolated for sequencing was first purified on a reversed-phase C4 semi-preparative column eluted with a 1% gradient of 0–80% acetronitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Active fractions were pooled, concentrated, and applied to a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 150 mm NaCl. Active fractions contained a major protein with an apparent molecular weight of ∼28,000 and of >95% purity as assessed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A, lane 4). These fractions were pooled, concentrated, and applied to an analytical reversed-phase C4 HPLC column eluted with a 0.5% gradient of 40–70% acetronitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. A single major peak (C4) eluting at 52% acetronitrile, with an apparent molecular weight of ∼28,000 and purity >99% as assessed by SDS-PAGE, was collected and sequenced (Fig. 1A, lane 5). To confirm that activity was associated with the ∼28,000-Da band and to purify sufficient material for biochemical analysis, additional Tex31 was purified using a modified method. First, an ion-exchange DEAE-Fast Flow Hi-Trap column (Amersham Biosciences) was equilibrated, and crude venom duct extract was eluted with 20 mm Bistris propane, pH 7. Tex31 was eluted with a linear 0–1 m NaCl gradient in 20 mm Bistris propane, pH 7, and fractions assayed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. Pooled active fractions eluting at ∼150 mm NaCl were concentrated by ultrafiltration (as described above) and applied to a Biosep-SEC-S 2000 column (Phenomenex) equilbrated in 20 mm Bistris propane, pH 7, containing 150 mm NaCl. The eluted active fractions of > 95% purity as assessed by SDS-PAGE were pooled (SEC I) (Fig. 1B, lane 3) and used to characterize Tex31 proteolytic activity. This pooled fraction was reapplied to the SEC column eluted at 0.3 ml/min to obtain an active fraction that gave a single band on SDS-PAGE (SEC II) ∼28,000-Da protein (Fig. 1B, lane 4), confirming that proteolytic activity corresponded to the sequenced material. Mass Spectrometry and Sequencing—Electrospray quadrupole-time of flight mass spectra of Tex31, SEC II, and C4 were acquired on an API QSTAR pulsar mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). Purified C4 Tex31 was digested with trypsin (l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated, Sigma) for 6 h at 37 °C in 200 μm N-ethylmorpholine, pH 8.5. Digested peptides were purified on a reversed-phase C18 column (Zorbax C18–300SB). Amino acid sequencing was performed on both the intact Tex31 and tryptic peptides by Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems 477A protein sequencer. Cloning—TRIzol (Invitrogen) was used to extract total RNA from a single C. textile venom duct, previously stored in RNAlater (Ambion) at –20 °C, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Single-stranded cDNA was 3′ end-synthesized from total RNA templates using an oligo(dT)16 primer (PE Biosystems) extended with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Degenerate PCR oligonucleotide primers were designed based on the N-terminal protein sequence (5′-TAYTATTgYCTNACNCCNgCNCAYACNATg-3′) and the internal tryptic peptide (5′-CATRTTNgCNgCRTCNgTNACRTCNgC-3′), designated Pr1S and Pr2R, respectively. Touchdown PCR (64 °C to 50 °C) was carried out on C. textile cDNA using Red Hot DNA polymerase (Advanced Biotechnologies), 3 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dideoxynucleotides, primers Pr1S and Pr2R, producing a 140-bp cDNA fragment. The PCR fragment was ligated into a TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced using Big Dye terminator chemistry (Applied Biosystems). The SMART rapid amplication of cDNA ends (Clontech) kit was then used to clone the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions using the gene specific primers, Pr3S (5′-CgCgCACACAATgTCCTgA-3′) and Pr4R (5′-CATgTTggCAgCATCTgTTACgTCggCgCg-3′). The 5′ and 3′ cDNA PCR fragments were ligated into cloning vectors and sequenced as described above. The primers Pr5S (5′-gggAgTCACACAgACACAgC-3′) and Pr6R (5′-CgACgTCTTCAggTTggATT-3′) were used to amplify full-length Tex31 cDNA. Biochemical Characterization—The optimal pH for protease activity was determined over a pH range of 7.2–9.4 in 100 mm Bistris propane buffer. pNA substrate analogues based on the TxVIA conotoxin propeptide cleavage site along with three control substrates were assayed at 100 μm in 100 mm Bistris propane, pH 8.5 at 37 °C. Protease inhibitors were preincubated with Tex31 for 30 min at 37 °C before the addition of 100 μm Ac-LNKR-pNA and the reaction incubated for a further 1 h. RVKR-CMK (decanoyl-Arg-Val-Arg-Lys-chloromethylketone) was assayed at 100 μm, Kunitz-soy bean trypsin inhibitor, 100 μm; leupeptin, 100 μm; EGTA, 1 mm; EDTA, 1 mm; AEBSF (4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride) 100 μm, N α-tosyl-Lys-chloromethylketone, 100 μm; pepstatin A, 2 μm; E-64, 20 μm; and benzamidine, at 1 mm. Tex31 was preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C in buffers containing 2 mm metal ion, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm Bistris propane, pH 8.5, before the addition of 100 μm Ac-LNKR-pNA. Tex31 in 100 mm Bistris propane, pH 8.5, buffer was included as a control. Initial velocities (v) were determined with 0–150 μm Ac-KLNKR-pNA, Tex31 SEC I pool (200 pmol) in 100 mm Bistris propane, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 8.5, at 37 °C. Kinetic parameters were calculated from nonlinear regression of initial velocities as a function of seven substrate concentrations [S] using GraphPad Prism software. The k cat/K m values were calculated assuming Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Tex31 SEC I pool (200 pmol) and 100 μm Ac-LNKR-pNA was used unless stated. Tex31 protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Homology Modeling—The PR protein, Ves v 5, and P14a structures were overlaid within the InsightII (9Accelrys Inc.InsightII Modelling Enviroment. Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA2001Google Scholar) environment to ascertain structural homology. The structurally conserved regions were then formally superimposed using InsightII. The structural alignment and homology modeling of Tex31 was carried out using the homology module with subsequent refinement using Discover 3. The validity of the model was tested using WHATCHECK and PROCHECK (10Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Electrostatic potentials were calculated using GRASP (11Nicholls A. Sharp K. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5318) Google Scholar). Using a Ac-LNKR-pNA substrate based on the propeptide cleavage site of conotoxin TxVIA (12Woodward S.R. Cruz L.J. Olivera B.M. Hillyard D.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1015-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) in a simple colormetric assay, we isolated and purified to homogeneity a major protease Tex31 from the C. textile venom duct (Fig. 1). The venom duct contents contained the majority of Ac-LNKR-pNA-specific cleavage activity, suggesting that Tex31 is secreted from the venom duct tissue. Tex31 appeared not to be specifically associated with the insoluble granules found in the crude venom (data not shown). Under reducing conditions, Tex31 migrated with an apparent molecular weight of 28,000 on 12% SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 1A, lanes 3–5, and B, lanes 2–4). Mass spectral analysis of Tex31 showed a mass of 30,825 Da, as well as a number of slightly heavier masses (Fig. 1C) that may represent modified forms of the enzyme. Similar profiles of related masses were seen in batches of Tex31 prepared by two separate purification methods (SEC II and C4; data not shown). Edman degradation of C4 purified native Tex31 yielded a single N-terminal sequence, HHXDSKYYELTPAHTM. Based on this protein sequence, and a tryptic digest fragment ADVTDAANMLK, we designed two degenerate primers to PCR-amplify a 140-bp fragment of cDNA encoding Tex31. Utilizing this sequence, we designed specific primers to isolate the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions using SMART rapid amplication of cDNA ends. The final assembled cDNA sequence encoded a 300-amino acid protein (GenBank™/EBI data base: accession number AJ4913118) (Fig. 2). The predicted post-translationally processed secreted protein of 276 residues contains both the N-terminal and tryptic digest sequences and has a calculated molecular weight of 30,875. This result is consistent with SDS-PAGE (∼28,000 Da) and mass spectrometry (30,853 Da allowing for 11 disulfide bonds) data obtained from the native protease. A BLAST analysis (14Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) of the SwissProt and PIR databases indicated that Tex31 is a novel protein, with closest sequence identity to members of the pathogenesis-related (PR) protein family. The term pathogenesis-related protein was initially given to plant proteins that are induced in pathological or related situations (15Antoniw J. White R.F. Phytopathol. Z. 1980; 98: 331-341Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). There are fourteen recognized plant PR families, PR1-PR14. The up-regulation of all PR proteins in situations of disease or stress suggests they play a pivotal role in cellular defense (16Van Loon L.C. Van Strien E.A. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1999; 55: 85-97Crossref Scopus (1504) Google Scholar). Over sixty-five proteins with high sequence homology to the plant PR-1 family have now been identified in the animal (invertebrates and vertebrates, including humans) and fungal kingdoms. Proteins include the human brain tumor PR proteins GliPR (17Murphy E.V. Zhang Y. Zhu W. Biggs J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 159: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and RTVP-1 (18Rich T.

Microbiol. 1993; 139: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of PR proteins reveals a highly conserved core of amino acids (Fig. 3), suggesting that they may share a similar function. This conservation has been interpreted as evidence that PR proteins arose from a common ancestor and evolved into a large “PR protein superfamily” (23Syperski T. Fernandez C. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2262-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Among the PR proteins, Tex31 displays the highest sequence identity (36%) to a subfamily of PR proteins found in mammals and known as the cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISPs). Like the CRISP subfamily (24Eberspaecher U. Roosterman D. Kratzschmar J. Haendler B. Habenicht U.F. Becker A. Quensel C. Petri T. Schleuning W.D. Donner P. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 157-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), which includes Tpx-1 (19Kasahara M. Gutknecht J. Brew K. Spurr N. Goodfellow P.N. Genomics. 1989; 5: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and helothermine (20Mochca-Morales J Martin B. Possani L. Toxicon. 1990; 28: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), Tex31 possess a characteristic cysteine-rich C-terminal region, with 19 of its 22 cysteine residues found in the C terminus. Biochemical characterization confirms that Tex31 is proteolytic. Tex31 cleaved the conotoxin propeptide substrate Ac-KLNKRWAbuKQSG-NH2 at the predicted propeptide cleavage site (Fig. 4A). The generation of the two resulting peptide fragments, Ac-KLNKR-OH and H-WAbuKQSG-NH2, was confirmed by mass spectrometry. A number of pNA substrate analogues were used to assess the substrate specificity of Tex31 (Fig. 4B). Tex31 cleaved single basic amino acid pNA substrates inefficiently. However, the incremental addition of a second, third, and fourth residue increased cleavage activity by 13-, 2.4-, and 4.4-fold, respectively. A glycine substituted for the leucine residue at position P4 resulted in a 11-fold loss in activity, demonstrating that the substrate specificity of Tex31 preferred a leucine residue at position P4. Proteolytic activity was little altered with the addition of a lysine residue found in the native propeptide substrate. In contrast, the isostructural, but uncharged, norleucine caused ∼50% loss of activity. The substantial influence on cleavage activity of the P4 and P5 residues demonstrates that the specificity of Tex31 is influenced by residues far removed from the cleavage site. To investigate the selectivity toward other conotoxin family propeptides of Tex31, the substrate Ac-LEKR-pNA based on the cleavage site of the μ-conotoxin family propeptides was synthesized. Tex31 also cleaved this substrate efficiently, again demonstrating its preference for substrates with a leucine at P4 and suggesting that a related protease could be used by mollusc hunting cone snails to cleave μ-conotoxins. The ability of Tex31 to cleave the native substrate Ac-KLNKR-pNA was 4–33-fold greater than for control substrates Ac-EVKKQR-pNA, Ac-TTSTRR-pNA, and Ac-RTSKKR-pNA, which are the preferred substrates for the dengue 2 virus NS3 protease (25Leung D. Schroder K. White H. Fang N.X. Stoermer M.J. Abbenante G. Martin J.L. Young P.R. Fairlie D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45762-45771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), and 166-fold greater than for the Ac-R-pNA substrate, which is efficiently cleaved by trypsin (26Somorin O. Tokura S. Nishi N. Noguchi J. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1979; 85: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Tex31 is active over a broad pH range with maximal activity at pH 8.5 (Fig. 5A) near the pH of C. textile crude venom (pH ∼8). Tex31 cleaves the peptidyl Ac-KLNKR-pNA substrate efficiently, with an apparent affinity (K m) of 80 μm and a proteolytic efficiency (k cat/K m) of 8.7 × 103m–1 s–1 (Fig. 5B). To further characterize Tex31 activity, the effect of metal ions and serine, cysteine, aspartyl, and metalloprotease inhibitors were assessed (Fig. 5, C and D). The irreversible serine-protease inhibitors decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethylketone and Kunitz-soy bean trypsin inhibitor fully inhibited Tex31. Leupeptin, a reversible inhibitor of serine and cysteine proteases, inhibited 75% of the activity of Tex31, while the irreversible cysteine-protease inhibitor E-64 had no significant effect. In contrast, the irreversible serine inhibitor AEBSF caused significant inhibition. Diisopropyl phosphonofluoridate, which acts in a similar manner to AEBSF, was not tested due to its very toxic and unstable nature. The identification of catalytic residues modified by irreversible inhibitors using mass spectral peptide fragment analysis was made impossible due the protease resistant nature of Tex31. The addition of the metal chelators EDTA and EGTA (1 mm) reduced cleavage activity by 58 and 65%, respectively, whereas the addition of 1 mm Ca2+ caused a 5-fold increase in substrate cleavage (Fig. 5D). This result indicates that calcium ions may contribute to the structural stability (27McPhalen C.A. Strynadka N.C. James M.N. Adv. Protein Chem. 1991; 42: 77-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) of Tex31. Neither Mg2+ nor Zn2+ were found to effectively substitute for Ca2+ (Fig. 5D). Due to the nonselective nature of many protease inhibitors, the question of to which protease class Tex31 belongs may be more accurately answered by site-directed mutagensis studies. To explore the structure of Tex31, we constructed a homology model for two PR protein structures. The highly conserved core amino acids from two PR protein structures, namely the crystal structure of antigen 5 from V. vilgaris venom (Ves v 5) (28Henriksen A. King T.P. Mirza O. Monsalve R.I. Meno K. Ipsen H. Larsen J.N. Gajhede M. Spangfort M.D. Proteins. 2001; 45: 438-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and the NMR structure of the plant protein P14a (29Fernandez C. Szyperski T. Bruyere T. Ramage P. Mosinger E. Wutrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 576-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), were aligned with Tex31 and a model constructed in InsightII (Fig. 6A). Statistically, enzyme active sites are located in the largest cleft of an enzyme (30Laskowski R. Luscombe N Swindells M. Thornton J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2438-2452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On viewing the homology model, we identified His130 in close hydrogen bonding distance to Glu115 (Fig. 6B) within a large, well defined electronegative cleft (Fig. 6C). Given their proximity and placement, we propose that His130 and Glu115 are two members of a catalytic triad that cleaves basic peptides. A conserved serine nucleophile, typically the third element of the catalytic triad for serine proteases, which is predicted from the AEBSF inhibition studies (Fig. 4C), is less easily recognized from the homology model. However, the relatively conserved Ser80 (Fig. 3) is a possible candidate, since it is located on a loop that could position it in close proximity to His130 and Glu115. Tex31 is the first member of the PR protein superfamily with a defined function. Substrates comprising at least four residues N-terminal of the cleavage site, and including a hydrophobic leucine at P4, characterize proteolysis by Tex31. A possible basic substrate recognition site, which includes the likely catalytic residues His130 and Glu115, was identified in a Tex31 homology model. Given that the proposed catalytic residues in Tex31 fall within structurally conserved regions of the PR proteins, we suggest that PR proteins may include presently uncharacterized substrate-specific proteases. Lack of knowledge of the specific substrate requirements for PR proteins may have confounded attempts to identify their proteolytic activity. Tex31 may provide the first insight into the role played by PR proteins in the cell in response to disease and stress. We thank A. Jones for mass spectrometry, D. Leung for control pNA substrates, D. Adams for peptide synthesis, I. Sharpe for assistance with manuscript preparation, and T. Walsh (Queensland University of Technology) for support during this project."
https://openalex.org/W2042173490,"Transport of the essential amino acids arginine and lysine is critical for the survival of mammalian cells. The adaptive response to nutritional stress involves increased translation of the arginine/lysine transporter (cat-1) mRNA via an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) within the mRNA leader. Induction of cat-1 IRES activity requires both translation of a small upstream open reading frame (uORF) within the IRES and phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2alpha. We show here that translation of the upstream ORF unfolds an inhibitory structure in the mRNA leader, eliciting a conformational change that yields an active IRES. The IRES, whose activity is induced by amino acid starvation, is created by RNA-RNA interactions between the 5' end of the leader and downstream sequences. This study suggests that the structure of the IRES is dynamic and regulation of this RNA structure is a mechanism of translational control."
https://openalex.org/W2044737524,"Apoptosis is a fundamental biological process used to eliminate unwanted cells in a multicellular organism. An increasing number of regulatory proteins have been identified that either promote or inhibit apoptosis. For tumors to arise, apoptosis must be blocked in the transformed cells, for example by mutational overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins, which represent attractive target proteins for molecular therapy strategies. In a functional yeast survival screen designed to select new anti-apoptotic mammalian genes, we have identified the chromosomal high-mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1) as an inhibitor of yeast cell death induced by the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bak. The C-terminal 33 amino acids of HMGB1 are dispensable for this inhibitory function. HMGB1 is also able to protect mammalian cells against different death stimuli including ultraviolet radiation, CD95-, TRAIL-, Casp-8-, and Bax-induced apoptosis. We found high HMGB1 protein levels in human primary breast carcinoma. Hmgb1 RNA levels are changing during different stages of mouse mammary gland development and are particularly low during lactation and involution. These data suggest that HMGB1 may participate in the regulation of mammary gland apoptosis and that its high expression level promotes tumor growth because of its anti-apoptotic properties."
https://openalex.org/W2022563306,"To identify deneddylases, proteases with specificity for hydrolysis of Nedd8 derivatives, a facile method was developed for the synthesis of Nedd8 amidomethylcoumarin (a substrate) and Nedd8 vinyl sulfone (an inhibitor). Deneddylase activity is necessary to reverse the conjugation of Nedd8 to cullin, a modification that regulates at least some ubiquitin ligases. The reaction of Nedd8 vinyl sulfone with L-M(TK–) mouse fibroblast lysates identified two deneddylases. The deubiquitinating enzyme UCH-L3 is labeled by both ubiquitin vinyl sulfone and Nedd8 vinyl sulfone. In contrast, a second and more selective enzyme is labeled only by Nedd8 vinyl sulfone. This protein, DEN1, is a 221-amino acid thiol protease that is encoded by an open reading frame previously annotated as SENP8. Recombinant human DEN1 shows significant specificity for Nedd8 and catalyzes the hydrolysis of Nedd8 amidomethylcoumarin with a K m of 51 nm and a k cat of7s–1. The catalytic efficiency of DEN1 acting upon ubiquitin amidomethylcoumarin is 6 × 10–4 that of Nedd8 amidomethylcoumarin and its activity on SUMO-1 amidomethylcoumarin is undetectable. This selectivity was unexpected as DEN1 is most closely related to enzymes that catalyze desumoylation. This observation expands to four the number of DUB families with members that can process the C terminus of Nedd8.

Ubiquitin (Ub) 1The abbreviations used are: Ub, ubiquitin; Ubl, ubiquitin-like proteins, such as Nedd8, SUMO-1, ISG15, etc.; DUB, deubiquitinating; AMC, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin; Ub-VS, ubiquitin C-terminal vinyl sulfone; Nedd8-VS, Nedd8 C-terminal vinyl sulfone; MESNA, mercaptoethane sulfonic acid; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; UCH, ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases; ULP, ubiquitin-like proteases. and the ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubl) constitute a family of proteins that are post-translationally conjugated to other proteins to target them for specific localization (1Wilkinson K.D.

Thus, attachment of a Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chain targets proteins to the proteasome, the multicatalytic proteinase that is responsible for most regulated intracellular proteolysis (5Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar, 6Coux O. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2002; 29: 85-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination is also involved in numerous other processes, including DNA repair, establishment, and maintenance of chromatin structure, receptor internalization, and sorting, and modulation of signal transduction pathways (5Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar, 7Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6955) Google Scholar). All ubiquitin-like proteins are activated by evolutionarily related E1 enzymes, and passed on (as thiol esters) to a family of E2 conjugating enzymes. In some cases this E2-ubiquitin thiol ester can directly catalyze ubiquitination, whereas in most cases a third enzyme, the ubiquitin ligase, is required to conjugate ubiquitin (and ubiquitin-like proteins) to the target protein (7Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6955) Google Scholar). Several ubiquitin-like proteins are also conjugated to other proteins and likewise act as targeting signals for the attached proteins (8Hochstrasser M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E153-E157Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 9Yeh E.T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 248: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Nedd8 is about 50% identical to ubiquitin and its conjugation to the cullin component of several ubiquitin ligases is thought to increase the efficiency of polyubiquitination (4Wu K. Chen A. Tan P. Pan Z.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 516-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). SUMO-1, -2, and -3 are closely related proteins with about 20% identity to ubiquitin that are attached to numerous proteins in the nucleus and to septins that accumulate at the bud neck of yeast (2Wilson V.G. Rangasamy D. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 10Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7243-7249Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 11Kim K.I.

Whereas the precise sites of localization and the mechanisms by which it is accomplished are not known, several important cellular regulators are sumoylated. These include p53, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, topoisomerase II, promyelocytic leukemia protein, and IκBα (2Wilson V.G. Rangasamy D. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 10Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7243-7249Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 11Kim K.I. Baek S.H. Chung C.H.

Finally, ISG15 is an interferon-stimulated protein with two ubiquitin-like domains that is attached to a poorly characterized set of proteins and results in a cytoskeletal distribution of ISG15 conjugates (3Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8408-8419Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 13Malakhov M.P. Kim K.I. Malakhova O.A. Jacobs B.S. Borden E.C. Zhang D.E. J. Biol.

The removal of the ubiquitin domain is catalyzed by processing proteases that have been generically named deubiquitinating (DUB) 2Nomenclature used is as follows. Deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) is a general term for any protease with specificity for the hydrolysis of amide or ester bonds at the C terminus of Ub or Ubl. There are four well defined gene families that encode DUBs: UCH, ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase (Pfam motif PF01088); UBP/USP, ubiquitin-specific proteases (Pfam motif PF00443); ULP, ubiquitin-like protease (Pfam motif PF02902); and JAMM isopeptidases, the Jab1/MPN domain metalloenzymes exemplified by the RPN11 subunit of the proteasome and the CSN5 subunit of the COP9 signalosome. There probably are others. DUBs can be given descriptive names based on the reaction catalyzed by these DUBs. Thus, an enzyme that is specific for ubiquitin is designated as a deubiquitinase, one specific for hydrolysis of Nedd8 derivatives is a deneddylase, etc. enzymes (15D'Andrea A. Pellman D. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 337-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 16Wilkinson K.D. Hochstrasser M. Peters J.-M. Harris J.R. Finley D.J. Ubiquitin. Plenum, Inc., New York1998: 99-125Google Scholar). At least four gene families are well defined. Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCH) are thiol proteases with a 230-amino acid core catalytic domain and that show specificity for hydrolysis of leaving groups that are either small or disordered from the C terminus of ubiquitin (17Wilkinson K.D. Barrett A. Rawlings N. A Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, London1998: 660-663Google Scholar). These enzymes exhibit tight binding of ubiquitin derivatives but will also process small derivatives of Nedd8 (18Wada H. Kito K. Caskey L.S. Yeh E.T. Kamitani T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 688-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). There is one UCH in yeast and four in mammals. A family of enzymes more generally able to remove ubiquitin from folded proteins is the ubiquitin-specific protease family (UBP in yeast and USP in man). There are 16 of these enzymes in yeast and about 50 in man (19Amerik A.Y. Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 981-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The specificity of most of these enzymes is unknown, but it is generally thought that these are specific for ubiquitin. In addition to acting on ubiquitin, one UBP has been reported to hydrolyze ISG15 conjugates (20Malakhov M.P. Malakhova O.A. Kim K.I. Ritchie K.J. Zhang D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9976-9981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) and another to hydrolyze Nedd8 derivatives (21Gong L. Kamitani T. Millas S. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14212-14216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin-like proteases (ULP) remove SUMOs from other proteins, although the exact specificities are ill defined (22Schwienhorst I. Johnson E.S. Dohmen R.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 23Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). There are two such enzymes in yeast and seven in man. Finally, JAMM isopeptidases (24Yao T. Cohen R.E. Nature. 2002; 419: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 25Verma R. Aravind L.

The presence of so many DUBs suggests multiple roles for deubiquitination. These include processing of the Ubl proproteins, reversal of ubiquitination to down-regulate localization processes, and disassembly of polyubiquitin chains to recycle ubiquitin. DUBs have been shown to be oncogenes, to modulate gene silencing and chromatin structure, and to affect developmental processes such as neuronal migration and survival, chemotaxis, differentiation, and eye development (15D'Andrea A. Pellman D. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 337-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 16Wilkinson K.D. Hochstrasser M. Peters J.-M. Harris J.R. Finley D.J. Ubiquitin. Plenum, Inc., New York1998: 99-125Google Scholar). One of the outstanding challenges in this field is to define and understand substrate specificity and the physiological roles of these important modulators of the ubiquitin pathway. The only known substrates for Nedd8 conjugation (neddylation) are the cullins (27Hori T. Osaka F. Chiba T. Miyamoto C. Okabayashi K. Shimbara N. Kato S. Tanaka K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6829-6834Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Cullins are subunits of many ubiquitin ligases. These multimeric ligases are widespread and their substrate specificity is probably determined by the specific combination of cullins and adapter proteins in the assembled ligase. Optimal activity of these ligases requires neddylation of the cullin component (4Wu K. Chen A. Tan P. Pan Z.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 516-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 28Ohh M. Kim W.Y. Moslehi J.J. Chen Y. Chau V. Read M.A. Kaelin Jr., W.G.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4003-4012Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). This modification is thought to assist in recruiting the ubiquitin-E2 thiol ester substrate (4Wu K. Chen A. Tan P. Pan Z.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 516-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 28Ohh M. Kim W.Y. Moslehi J.J. Chen Y. Chau V. Read M.A. Kaelin Jr., W.G.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4003-4012Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Nedd8-specific DUBs (deneddylases) are required to process the primary gene product by removal of the C-terminal propeptide, as well as to remove Nedd8 from the cullins. Normally, cullin modification is limited to a single Nedd8, although cullins can be hyper-neddylated in vitro. The Deshaies group (26Cope G.A. Suh G.S. Aravind L. Schwarz S.E. Zipursky S.L. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2002; 298: 608-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) reported that mutations in the COP9 signalosome resulted in the accumulation of singly neddylated cullins. This suggests that the cullin-containing E3 ligases may be regulated by the metalloprotease activity of the signalosome. Processing of the proprotein of Nedd8 is less well defined, but may be accomplished by UCH enzymes (30Linghu B. Callis J. Goebl M.G. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The current work focuses on defining the DUBs that catalyze deneddylation. Using a technique we developed for identification of the corresponding ubiquitin-specific enzymes (31Borodovsky A. Ovaa H. Kolli N. Gan-Erdene T. Wilkinson K.D. Ploegh H.L. Kessler B.M. Chem.

This reactive vinyl group is subject to Michael addition and Nedd8-VS is an active site- directed irreversible inhibitor of deneddylases. The addition of an epitope tag to this inhibitor allowed us to purify and identify two deneddylases from L-M(TK–) mouse fibroblasts. The same approach can be utilized to synthesize Nedd8-AMC, the C-terminal amidomethylcoumarin of Nedd8, for use as a substrate. The results demonstrate that the DEN1 deneddylase is a member of the ULP family with exquisite specificity for Nedd8. Plasmid Construction and Protein Expression—A cDNA encoding residues 1–75 of human Nedd8 was amplified from pRSNedd8p 3B. N. Krantz and K. D. Wilkinson, unpublished data. by PCR using the primers 5′-CTATAGGGAGACCACAACGG-3′ and 5′-TCTCAGAGCCAACACCAGG-3′. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and inserted into pTYB2 (New England Biolabs) digested with NdeI and SmaI prior to ligation. For construction of the FLAG-tagged fusion protein the vector above was digested with NdeI and ligated to a cassette formed by hybridizing two oligonucleotides: 5′-pTATGATCGACTACAAAGACGATGACGATAAACA-3′ and 5′-pTATGTTTATCGTCATCGTCTTTGTAGTCGATCA-3′. DNA sequences of inserts were confirmed by automated sequencing. BL21(DE3) transformed with pTYB2-Nedd8 or pTYB2-FLAG-Nedd8 were grown in LB media to an A 600 nm of 0.6–0.8. Expression of the Nedd81–75-intein-CBD fusion protein was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 30 °C. FLAG-Nedd81–75-intein-CBD fusion protein was induced with 50 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 15 °C overnight. Cell pellets from 1 liter of cells were resuspended in 50 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. After sonication to break the cells, debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min. Affinity Purification of Nedd8-and FLAG-Nedd8 Thiol Esters—The clarified lysate (50 ml) was incubated with 2.5 ml of chitin beads equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, and incubated with the beads at 37 °C for 2 h. The beads were then poured into a column and the resin was washed with 25 ml of 20 mm HEPES, 50 mm CH3COONa, pH 6.5. The fusion protein was cleaved on the column by applying 2.5 ml of 50 mm MESNA and incubating at 37 °C overnight. The Nedd81–75 thiol ester (or the FLAG-tagged version) were eluted with 4 column volumes of 20 mm HEPES, 50 mm CH3COONa, pH 7.0. The eluted fractions were combined and concentrated 10-fold. Affinity binding, cleavage, and purification were monitored by SDS-PAGE and high performance liquid chromatography. Synthesis of Nedd8 Derivatives and Their Purification—Nedd8-amidomethylcoumarin (AMC) was synthesized by reacting 0.5 ml of Nedd81–75 thiol ester (1–3 mg/ml) with 2 ml of 50 mm glycyl-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin in 30% hydroxypropyl β-cyclodextrin and 0.1 ml of 2 m N-hydroxysuccinimide. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C overnight. FLAG-Nedd8-VS was synthesized by reacting 1 ml of FLAG-Nedd81–75 thiol ester (1–3 mg/ml) with 0.1 ml of 2 m glycine vinylmethyl sulfone tosylate, a generous gift of Hidde Ploegh (32Borodovsky A. Kessler B.M. Casagrande R. Overkleeft H.S. Wilkinson K.D. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5187-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), pH 7.0, 0.1 ml of 2 m N-hydroxysuccinimide, pH 7.2, and 0.04 ml of 0.5 m Tris base at 37 °C for 3 h. Nedd8 derivatives were purified by ion exchange chromatography as described previously for ubiquitin (33Wilkinson K.D. Rechsteiner M. Ubiquitin. Plenum Press, New York1988: 5-38Crossref Google Scholar). All steps of synthesis and purification of Nedd8 derivatives were monitored by high performance liquid chromatography as described (34Wilkinson K.D. Cox M.J. Mayer A.N. Frey T. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6644-6649Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The identity of the derivatives was confirmed by MALDI mass spectroscopic analysis. Preparation of L-M(TK – ) Cell Extracts—L-M(TK–) cells were cultured in spinner flasks with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics, at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 15 min. The cell pellets were resuspended in HR buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP) and lysed by a combination of three cycles of freezing and thawing. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The final concentration of total protein in the cell lysate was 10 mg/ml. Labeling of Cell Lysates with FLAG-Nedd8-VS and Ub-VS—Deneddylases in L-M(TK–) cell lysates were labeled by reacting with the indicated amount of FLAG-Nedd8-VS (0.2 mg/ml) with lysates (10 mg/ml total protein) for 30 min at 37 °C. For prelabeling with Ub-VS, 36 ml of L-M(TK–) cell lysate was incubated with 0.54 ml of 0.2 mg/ml Ub-VS for 30 min at 37 °C. After prelabeling, 0.72 ml of 0.2 mg/ml FLAG-Nedd8-VS was added for an additional 30 min at 37 °C. Affinity purification of FLAG-Nedd8-VS-labeled Proteins from L-M(TK – ) Cell Lysates—FLAG-Nedd8-VS-labeled proteins were isolated using anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma). The affinity gel (0.6 ml) was equilibrated by washing three times with 0.6 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.45, then once with 0.6 ml of 0.1 m glycine HCl, pH 3.0, then five times with 0.6 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.45. Labeled proteins were adsorbed onto the gel at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle mixing and the supernatant was removed from the gel. After washing the gel 10 times with 0.6 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.45, it was incubated with 0.6 ml of 0.225 mg/ml FLAG peptide in the same buffer at 4 °C for 30 min with gentle mixing. The eluted protein was removed and the affinity gel was eluted two more times with 0.6 ml of 0.15 mg/ml FLAG peptide. After elution, the affinity gel was stripped with 0.6 ml of 0.1 m glycine HCl, pH 3.0. All steps of the purification were monitored by Western blotting. Western Blotting Analysis—Western blotting was performed using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. Primary and secondary antibodies were prepared in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 containing 5% dry milk. New Nedd8-specific Inhibitors and Substrates—Identification of deneddylases will be facilitated by the availability of specific inhibitors and substrates. To synthesize inhibitors and substrates of the Ubl protein processing proteases we have adapted the intein fusion protein approach (35Chong S. Mersha F.B. Comb D.G. Scott M.E. Landry D. Vence L.M. Perler F.B. Benner J. Kucera R.B. Hirvonen C.A. Pelletier J.J. Paulus H. Xu M.Q. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 192: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) to produce ubiquitin-like proteins activated at their C terminus. In this method, the ubiquitin-like protein, lacking its C-terminal glycine, is produced in bacteria as a fusion protein with a self-splicing intein followed by a chitin binding domain (Fig. 1). Expressed fusion protein was adsorbed to a chitin column and contaminating proteins were removed by washing. Nedd81–75 (or FLAG-Nedd81–75) was isolated as the C-terminal thiol ester by incubating the column with MESNA. Cleavage from the column is quantitative and the yield of homogeneous Nedd81–75 thiol ester (expected mass 8626.13, observed mass 8626.92) was ∼3 mg/liter of bacterial culture. Reaction of this thiol ester with nucleophiles (in the presence of N-hydroysuccinimide as a catalyst) leads to a variety of C-terminal derivatives. For instance, reaction of the MESNA ester of FLAG-Nedd81–75 with glycyl vinylmethyl sulfone (32Borodovsky A. Kessler B.M. Casagrande R. Overkleeft H.S. Wilkinson K.D. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5187-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) resulted in the synthesis of FLAG-Nedd8-VS. After purification by ion exchange chromatography, the yield was about 30% (mass expected 9997.50, mass observed 9997.25). The results above also suggested that we could synthesize substrates of Nedd8-specific processing proteases (deneddylases) using the same chemistry. We chose to synthesize Nedd8-AMC, a substrate whose cleavage should result in the release of the intensely fluorescent AMC group (36Dang L.C. Melandri F.D. Stein R.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1868-1879Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). To increase the solubility of the nucleophillic coumarin, we took advantage of the fact that cyclodextrins increase the solubility of many hydrophobic compounds. Reaction of Nedd81–75 thiol ester with glycyl 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (50 mm) in the presence of 30% hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin resulted in the synthesis of C-terminal amidomethylcoumarin of Nedd8 (Nedd8-AMC) in about 5% yield. After purification on ion exchange chromatography, Nedd8-AMC was shown to exhibit the expected mass (Fig. 1), fluorescence spectra, and properties as a substrate (Fig. 2). Because the deubiquitinating enzyme UCH-L3 catalyzes the hydrolysis of Nedd8 derivatives we tested if UCH-L3 would hydrolyze Nedd8-AMC. As expected, Nedd8-AMC was completely and efficiently hydrolyzed by UCH-L3 (Fig. 2). When added to this reaction, FLAG-Nedd8-VS was an efficient and irreversible inhibitor of the hydrolysis of Nedd8-AMC by UCH-L3 (Fig. 2). This inhibition was complete, even when the more tightly bound substrate Ub-AMC was used, suggesting that the vinyl sulfone covalently modifies the enzyme. Thus, each of these derivatives was synthesized in good yield and possessed the expected specificity with UCH-L3, a known deneddylase. Detection of Deneddylases in Mammalian Cell Extracts—To detect and identify deneddylases in mammalian cells, we reacted a lysate of L-M(TK–) mouse fibroblasts with FLAG-Nedd8-VS. Based on similar experiments with Ub-VS (31Borodovsky A. Ovaa H. Kolli N. Gan-Erdene T. Wilkinson K.D. Ploegh H.L. Kessler B.M. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 1149-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 32Borodovsky A. Kessler B.M. Casagrande R. Overkleeft H.S. Wilkinson K.D. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5187-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), we expected that only deneddylases would be rapidly and specifically labeled by this reagent. Fig. 3A shows that when this reaction mixture is subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibodies two proteins are labeled. A major protein reacts to give an adduct with an apparent molecular weight of about 40,000 and a minor protein yields an adduct of apparent molecular weight of about 35,000. Similar results were obtained with lysates of COS and HeLa cells, although the Western blots showed that more cross-reactive background bands were present in the unmodified lysates (data not shown). As these bands would complicate purification of the authentic deneddylases we conducted the rest of our studies with L-M(TK–) lysates. To identify the proteins labeled by FLAG-Nedd8-VS we immunopurified the adducts formed by adsorbing the reaction mixture to anti-FLAG M2-Sepharose. Fig. 3A shows that immunoreactive FLAG-Nedd8 is completely adsorbed by the column and can be eluted with FLAG peptide as a competitor. The two most prominent adducts seen in the peptide eluates (lanes 4–6) were excised from the gel and subjected to mass spectroscopic analysis. The third band at 35 kDa was not analyzed because of its low abundance. The upper band at about 48 kDa was determined to be β-actin and that at about 40 kDa was determined to be UCH-L3 (data not shown). The same results were obtained using MALDI-TOF or LC MS/MS analysis of the digested proteins. β-Actin was also identified in control purifications where only lysate was applied to the antibody column and is probably non-specifically bound to the support. Thus, a major deneddylase appears to be UCH-L3 but the identity of the minor 35-kDa band (DEN1, see below) was not obtained in this experiment. To investigate the specificity of these labeling experiments, we first prelabeled the lysates with Ub-VS (to block any Ub-specific enzymes) and then added FLAG-Nedd8-VS to derivatize any Nedd8-specific enzymes (Fig. 3B). In this experiment, control Western blots showed two weak immunoreactive bands near, but not identical to, the observed adducts (* in Fig. 3B). Labeling with FLAG-Nedd8-VS alone yielded the pattern seen previously. However, reaction of the prelabeled lysates with FLAG-Nedd8-VS revealed an almost complete loss of adduct corresponding to UCH-L3 but persistence of the labeled band at 35 kDa. Increasing the concentration of FLAG-Nedd8-VS 10-fold did not result in the labeling of any additional species. Thus, UCH-L3 reacts with both Ub-VS and FLAG-Nedd8-VS while the adduct at 35 kDa arises from a protein that only reacts with FLAG-Nedd8-VS. This latter reaction can be completely eliminated by incubation with Nedd8 (data not shown), suggesting that the FLAG and vinyl sulfone moieties are not contributing significantly to the specificity of labeling. We propose that the enzyme modified by FLAG-Nedd8-VS to give the 35-kDa band be called deneddylase 1 (DEN1). Note that DEN1 is considerably less abundant than UCH-L3 in these lysates. Identification of DEN1—To identify DEN1, we purified the protein with anti-FLAG M2-Sepharose as described above for UCH-L3. The proteins eluted from the column with the FLAG peptide were separated by SDS-PAGE and the portion of the gel containing the adduct was excised from the gel, digested with trypsin, and subjected to LC MS/MS analysis (Fig. 4). Several peptides derived from β-actin and β-actin-binding proteins (ARP2/3 protein complex 34, tropomodulin, and tropomyosin) were present indicating contamination with cytoskeletal proteins (Table I). As suggested above, these are probably non-specifically bound. Similarly, the ribosomal proteins L5, S3a, and nascent-polypeptide-associated complex α were identified, suggesting that some contamination with abundant ribosomes was also observed. However, none of these proteins are expected to be modified by FLAG-Nedd8-VS and it is assumed that they are trace contaminants. As expected, the band analyzed also contained 4 peptides from Nedd8, as well as five peptides from a previously identified ubiquitin-like protease family mem"

Here we report the isolation, cloning, and characterization of a novel human Nedd8-specific protease called DEN1. Human DEN1 is encoded by AAH31411.1, a previously uncharacterized protein of 212 amino acids that shares homology with the Ulp1 cysteinyl SUMO deconjugating enzyme family. Recombinant human DEN1, purified from bacteria, selectively binds to Nedd8 and hydrolyzes C-terminal derivatives of Nedd8. Interestingly, DEN1 deconjugates cullin 1 (CUL1)-Nedd8 in a concentration-dependent manner. At a low concentration, DEN1 processes hyper-neddylated CUL1 to yield a mononeddylated form, which presumably contains the Lys-720CUL1-Nedd8 linkage. At elevated concentrations, DEN1 is able to complete the removal of Nedd8 from CUL1. These activities distinguish DEN1 from the COP9 signalosome, which is capable of efficiently cleaving the Lys-720CUL1-Nedd8 conjugate, but lacks Nedd8 C-terminal hydrolytic activity and poorly processes hyperneddylated CUL1. These results suggest a unique role for DEN1 in regulating the modification of cullins by Nedd8.

Nedd8 is a small ubiquitin (Ub) 1The abbreviations used are: Ub, ubiquitin; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; CUL1, cullin 1; SCF, Skp1-CUL1-F-box protein; CSN, COP9 signalosome; DTT, dithiothreitol; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid.1The abbreviations used are: Ub, ubiquitin; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; CUL1, cullin 1; SCF, Skp1-CUL1-F-box protein; CSN, COP9 signalosome; DTT, dithiothreitol; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid.-like protein that plays a critical regulatory role in cell proliferation and development. In fission yeast, Nedd8 is essential for cell viability (1Osaka F. Saeki M. Katayama S. Aida N. Toh-E A. Kominami K. Toda T. Suzuki T. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Kato S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3475-3484Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In animals, Nedd8 is required for development as inactivation of the Nedd8 pathway in either mouse (2Tateishi K. Omata M. Tanaka K. Chiba T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) or Drosophila (3Ou C.Y. Lin Y.F. Chen Y.J. Chien C.T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2403-2414Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) results in embryonic lethality. The critical biological function of Nedd8 is conferred by its biochemical activity as a protein modifier, being covalently attached to nearly all members of the cullin family (4Hori T. Osaka F. Chiba T. Miyamoto C. Okabayashi K. Shimbara N. Kato S. Tanaka K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6829-6834Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). This modification, neddylation, is reminiscent of the ubiquitination reaction. Neddylation occurs by the formation of an isopeptide-bond linking the ϵ-amino group of a conserved lysine residue typically within the C terminus of a cullin to the carboxyl-end of Nedd8 Gly-76 (5Hochstrasser M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 901-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The enzyme components of the neddylation reaction include a Nedd8-specific E1 activating enzyme comprised of the APP-BP1/Uba3 heterodimer, an E2 conjugating enzyme known as Ubc12 (6Gong L. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12036-12042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and the ROC1/Rbx1 RING finger protein (7Kamura T. Conrad M.N. Yan Q. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2928-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar).Using in vitro systems, several studies have shown that Nedd8 activates the ubiquitination of IκBα (8Read M.A. Brownell J.E.

These reactions are mediated by SCF E3 Ub ligases, in which CUL1 functions as a molecular scaffold (10Tan P. Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Wu K. Gomez C. Ronai Z. Pan Z.-Q. Mol.

Moslehi J.J. Chen Y. Chau V. Read M.A. Kaelin Jr., W.G. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In this case, Nedd8 was conjugated to CUL2 that assembles the von Hippel-Lindau protein E3 Ub ligase (reviewed in Ref. 14Conaway R.C. Brower C.S. Conaway J.W. Science. 2002; 296: 1254-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). These studies thus suggest a role for Nedd8 in the assembly of an active cullin-based E3 Ub ligase.We initially reported that conjugation of Nedd8 to CUL1 increases the ability of ROC1-CUL1, a sub-complex within the SCF E3 Ub ligase, to assemble polyubiquitin chains in a reaction catalyzed by the Cdc34 E2 conjugating enzyme (15Wu K. Chen A. Pan Z.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32317-32324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we showed that the activation function of Nedd8 in polyubiquitin chain assembly is critically dependent on its charged surface residues, suggesting that Nedd8 mediates electrostatic interactions to facilitate the recruitment of an E2 (16Wu K. Chen A. Tan P. Pan Z.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 516-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, it was shown that immunoprecipitates containing exclusively neddylated forms of cullin were more active in assembling polyubiquitin chains (17Lyapina S. Cope G.

Furthermore, Nedd8 conjugation was found to increase the interaction between SCFβTRCP and the Ubc4∼S∼Ub conjugate (19Kawakami T. Chiba T. Suzuki T. Iwai K. Yamanaka K. Minato N. Suzuki H. Shimbara N.

More recently, x-ray crystallographic studies have predicted that the covalent attachment of Nedd8 at CUL1 lysine residue 720 (Lys-720CUL1) positions Nedd8 within close proximity of ROC1/Rbx1 (20Zheng N.

These studies support a model suggesting that Nedd8 activates ubiquitination by increasing the recruitment of an E2, thereby facilitating the assembly of polyubiquitin chains.

Surprisingly, while characterizing proteolytic activities from HeLa extracts that deconjugated Nedd8 from CUL1, we purified a novel cysteinyl protease we called DEN1 (human deneddylase 1). DEN1 selectively binds Nedd8, efficiently processes the C terminus of Nedd8, and deconjugates hyper-neddylated CUL1. These data suggest a role for DEN1 in regulating the Nedd8 pathway.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIsolation of Native DEN1 and CSNDEN1—The protease was isolated from HeLa extracts based on its ability to cleave CUL1324–776-Nedd8, as monitored by both immunoblot and 32P-Nedd8 cleavage assays. HeLa cell extracts (1.3g of protein, 120 ml) were prepared as described previously (29Wobbe C.R. Dean F. Weissbach L. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5710-5714Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and dialyzed against Buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) plus 0.5 m NaCl, prior to chromatography through an active thiol-Sepharose column (3 ml; Amersham Biosciences). After washing with Buffer A plus 0.5 m NaCl, the bound protein was eluted by 20 mm DTT contained in Buffer A plus 50 mm NaCl. Half of the eluted material (102 mg of protein) was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C with a buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, and 1.7 m ammonium sulfate. After removing insoluble protein by centrifugation, the resulting supernatant was further clarified by filtration through a 0.22-μm Millex GP syringe-driven filter unit (Millipore) and then loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose column (2 ml; Amersham Biosciences). Bound protein was eluted with buffer (6 ml each) containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, and progressively decreased concentration of ammonium sulfate at 1.2, 0.7, 0.2, or 0 m. The active 0.2 m ammonium sulfate fraction was adjusted to 1 m ammonium sulfate and reloaded onto the phenyl-Sepharose column. Bound proteins were eluted using a 40-ml reverse gradient of 1.0–0 m ammonium sulfate in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8. Active fractions, eluted at ∼0.25 m, were pooled (1.35 mg total protein) and dialyzed against Buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) plus 25 mm NaCl, prior to chromatography through a Q-Sepharose column (0.5 ml; Amersham Biosciences). Bound proteins were eluted with a 20-ml gradient of 0.025–0.5 m NaCl in Buffer B. Active fractions, eluted at ∼0.15 m, were pooled (0.25 mg of protein) and concentrated 20-fold using a centrifugal filter (Millipore). An aliquot (0.2 ml) was then chromatographed by fast protein liquid chromatography using a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences).To identify DEN1, the peak fraction (number 21) from the Superdex 75 column was trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and size-fractionated by 4–20% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. Each band was then excised and analyzed via mass spectrometry as described previously (30Dias D.C. Dolios G. Wang R. Pan Z.-Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16601-16606Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). One detected tryptic peptide, with the sequence QQTESLLQLLTPAYITK, was matched to AAH31411.1 (see Fig. 2, A–C).CSN—The eight-subunit complex was affinity purified from 293 cells that constitutively express FLAG-CSN-2 and CSN-3-V5, generated following a procedure as described previously (30Dias D.C. Dolios G. Wang R. Pan Z.-Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16601-16606Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Forty 150-mm plates of cells were harvested, and the tagged CSN complex was purified based on a published protocol (30Dias D.C. Dolios G. Wang R. Pan Z.-Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16601-16606Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Briefly, the extracts were adsorbed to M2 beads (0.5 ml; Sigma). After extensive washes, the bound protein was eluted with FLAG peptide (1 mg/ml) in Buffer A plus 1 mm DTT and 0.5 m NaCl. The eluate was concentrated 4-fold, yielding CSN at a concentration of 0.5 pmol/μl (0.6 ml total).DEN1 Cloning, Expression, and Antibody PreparationDEN1 was cloned by PCR from a human fetal brain cDNA library (a gift from A. Chan, The Mount Sinai School of Medicine) using the sense 5′-caccctggttccgcgtggatccatggaccccgtagtcttg-3′ primer (the bold sequences encode a thrombin protease cleavage site) and the antisense 5′-ctactttttagcaagtgtgg-3′ primer designed based on the data base sequence for AAH31411.1. The PCR fragment was inserted into the Invitrogen Gateway entry vector pENTR/d-TOPO and verified by sequencing.Recombinant DEN1 was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein in BL21 (DE3) cells using the Gateway destination vector, pDEST 17 (Invitrogen). Cells were grown and induced, and extracts were prepared as described previously for GST-UBC12 (15Wu K. Chen A. Pan Z.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32317-32324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), except that 0.8 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was used for induction, and leupeptin, as well as antipain, were omitted from the lysis buffer. Glutathione-Sepharose purification was carried out as described previously for GST-UBC12 (15Wu K. Chen A. Pan Z.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32317-32324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), except with buffers that lacked protease inhibitors.To prepare GST-free DEN1, GST-DEN1 was incubated with biotinylated thrombin (1 unit/mg of protein; Novagen) at room temperature overnight. The thrombin and cleaved GST were then removed by passing the reaction mixture first through streptavidin-Sepharose and then glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The cleaved DEN1 was further purified by fast protein liquid chromatography on the Superdex 75 gel filtration column. Approximately 37.5 mg of pure DEN1 was obtained per liter of culture.Anti-DEN1 polyclonal antibody was prepared using purified, GST-free DEN1 as antigen (Covance). To affinity purify the anti-DEN1-specific antibody, serum (10 ml) was incubated with Affi-15 beads (0.5 ml; Bio-Rad) that had been cross-linked with purified GST-DEN1 (∼4 mg of protein per ml of beads). After extensive washing, bound antibody was eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5, immediately followed by neutralization with Tris-HCl, pH 8.3.Substrate PreparationPK-Nedd8 —The pET3a PK-Nedd8 expression plasmid was generated by inserting a DNA linker containing the cAMP-dependent kinase motif (LRRASV) sequence and flanking NdeI restriction site compatible ends (sense 5′-tatgcttagacgagcttctgtgcc-3′, antisense 5′-tagggcacagaagctcgtctaagca-3′) into the pET3a Nedd8 plasmid (a kind gift from C. Pickart, The Johns Hopkins University) at the NdeI site. PK-Nedd8 expression and purification were carried out as described for the wild type Nedd8 (15Wu K. Chen A. Pan Z.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32317-32324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), except PK-Nedd8 was found in the soluble fraction. The extracts containing PK-Nedd8 were first passed through Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). PK-Nedd8 bound to SP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was eluted with a 50–500 mm NaCl gradient. The peak fraction, judged by Coomassie staining following SDS-PAGE, was used for this study.pro-Nedd8 —The coding sequence for pro-Nedd8 was PCR-amplified from a human liver B-cell cDNA library (Stratagene). Primers contained an NdeI site at the initiator Met and a KpnI site after the stop codon. The PCR product was rescued into the TA vector (Invitrogen). The insert was excised by digestion with NdeI and KpnI and ligated into a similarly digested pRSET vector (Invitrogen). The protein was expressed in BL21 (DE3) cells and purified using the same protocol as published for ubiquitin. The protein was refolded before use by denaturation with 8 m urea followed by dialysis into 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6 (31Whitby F.G. Xia G. Pickart C.M. Hill C.P. J. Biol.

Xiong, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill), HA-tagged Fbx22 (GenBank™ accession number AY005144), His-tagged Skp1 (M. Pagano, New York University Medical School), and His-tagged ROC1. Cells were harvested, and Ni-NTA purification was carried out based on previously published procedures (32Cai J. Uhlmann F. Gibbs E. Flores-Rozas H. Lee C.G. Phillips B. Finkelstein J. Yao N. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12896-12901Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The resulting SCFHA-Fbx22 was further purified through Q-Sepharose and Superdex 200 chromatography.In Vitro Nedd8 Conjugation—Nedd8 was initially phosphorylated in a reaction mixture (200 μl) that contained PK-Nedd8 (15 μg), 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 12 mm MgCl2,2mm NaF, 50 mm NaCl, 25 μm ATP, 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 20 units of cAMP kinase (Sigma). The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. To conjugate 32P-Nedd8 to CUL1, a second reaction mixture was added to include 4 mm ATP, APP-BP1/Uba3 (20 ng), 10 μg of Ubc12, and 12 pmol of [HA-ROC1]-CUL1324–776 (see Fig. 5C, lane 1) (15Wu K. Chen A. Pan Z.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32317-32324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) or 6 pmol of SCFHA-Fbx22 (see Fig. 5C, lane 2). The reaction was further incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. To purify the 32P-Nedd8-CUL1 conjugates, the reaction mixtures were adsorbed to anti-HA antibody-linked agarose beads (Sigma), and the bound protein complex was eluted by HA-peptide (2 mg/ml) in Buffer A plus 1 mm DTT and 0.05 m NaCl.Fig. 5The cleavage activity of DEN1 with mono-neddylated CUL1.

After incubation at 37 °C for 60 min, the beads were washed, and the modified complexes were then eluted with 60 mm imidazole in Buffer A plus 1 mm DTT and 50 mm NaCl followed by dialysis and concentration. This procedure yielded hyper-neddylated SCFHA-Fbx22 (9.8 μg) (shown in Fig. 6B).Fig. 6DEN1 deconjugates hyper-neddylated CUL1. The Nedd8 cleavage reaction (10 μl) contained 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin, hyper-neddylated SCFHA-Fbx22 (20 nm), and DEN1 or CSN in amounts as indicated. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction products were then separated by 4–20% SDS-PAGE and visualized by immunoblotting using anti-CUL1 antibody (panel A).

The BamHI-SpeI fragment containing SUMO-1 coding sequence was then excised and inserted into pRSET-A (Invitrogen) that had been treated sequentially with EcoRI, T4 DNA polymerase, and BamHI. The positive pRSET-SUMO-1 clone, confirmed by DNA sequencing, was digested with BamHI and subsequently ligated with a synthetic linker that encodes for RRASV, the phosphorylation site by the cAMP-dependent kinase. The synthetic linker was generated by annealing two primers, 5′-GATCTGGTACCCGTCGTGCATCTGTTA-3′ and 5′-GATCTAACAGATGCACGACGGGTACCA-3′. SUMO-1 was expressed in BL21 (DE3) and purified using Ni-NTA as per the manufacturer's instructions.Nedd8 Protease Assays32P-Nedd8 Cleavage Assay—The reaction (10 μl) contained 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm NaF, 10 nm okadaic Acid, purified 32P-Nedd8-CUL1 conjugates in amounts as indicated, and DEN1 or CSN. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for times as specified. The reaction products were then separated by 4–20% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography.Nedd8 Hydrolase Assay—The reaction (20 μl) contained 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, 100 nm pro-Nedd8, and DEN1 or CSN in amounts as indicated. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for times as specified. The reaction products were then separated by 16% SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining.RESULTSIsolation of a Novel Human Nedd8 Protease, DEN1—To search for protease activities capable of deconjugating Nedd8 from a protein target, we developed a substrate containing a 32P-labeled Nedd8 that was conjugated to a CUL1 moiety. Initially, CUL1-[32P-Nedd8] substrates were prepared by conjugating the radioactive Nedd8 to the purified ROC1-CUL1324–776 complex (15Wu K. Chen A. Pan Z.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32317-32324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 5C, lane 1). The use of CUL1 C-terminal truncation was valid, because similar results were obtained with substrates containing either CUL1324–776 or full-length CUL1 (see Fig. 5). As revealed by autoradiographic/SDS-PAGE analysis, the purified ROC1-CUL1324–776-[32P-Nedd8] substrate contained primarily the CUL1324–776-Nedd81 conjugate and a small amount of CUL1324–776-Nedd82 (Fig. 1A, lane 1). This observation was consistent with our previous findings that under in vitro conditions, a small percentage of CUL1324–776 was conjugated with two Nedd8 moieties (15Wu K. Chen A. Pan Z.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32317-32324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Although the conjugation of Nedd8 to CUL1324–776 required Lys-720CUL1 (15Wu K. Chen A. Pan Z.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32317-32324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), it is presently unclear whether CUL1324–776-Nedd82 was formed by the assembly of a di-Nedd8 chain attached to Lys-720CUL1 or by the conjugation of two Nedd8 moieties to Lys-720CUL1 and an unidentified CUL1 C-terminal lysine residue.Fig. 1Gel filtration analysis of DEN1. The Q-Sepharose fraction of DEN1 was analyzed by Superdex 75 (SD75) gel filtration. Aliquots of fractions were analyzed by the 32P-Nedd8 cleavage assay (A), silver staining (B), and immunoblotting (C). In the cleavage reaction, [HA-ROC1]-CUL1324–776-[32P-Nedd8] (26.4 nm) was incubated with DEN1 SD75 fraction (3 μl), and the reaction products were separated by 4–20% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. In panel C, 20 μl of indicated fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-DEN1 antibody. Lane 1 contains 2 ng of purified recombinant DEN1 (shown in Fig. 4C, lane 1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Using the radioactive CUL1-Nedd8 substrate, we identified and subsequently purified a Nedd8 protease activity from extracts of HeLa cells that we have named DEN1 (human deneddylase 1). As shown, incubation of the ROC1-CUL1324–776-[32P-Nedd8] substrate with a highly purified DEN1 Q-Sepharose fraction resulted in reduction of the levels of CUL1324–776-Nedd82 and concomitant accumulation of the monomeric radioactive Nedd8 (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 1 and 2). The preferential cleavage of CUL1324–776-Nedd82 by DEN1 was because of the low concentration of native enzyme (∼1 nm) used in the assay (see below). Analysis of the DEN1 Q-Sepharose fraction by gel filtration revealed a single peak of Nedd8 cleavage activity (Fig. 1A, lanes 4–6), whose migration position corresponded to chymotrypsinogen (∼25 kDa), thereby suggesting that DEN1 is a small polypeptide.To determine its molecular identity, the proteins contained in the DEN1 activity peak fraction, number 21, were separated by SDS-PAGE, and individually excised polypeptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry. The results showed that the protein band of ∼24 kDa contained a mixture of tryptic peptides that corresponded to two proteins: thioredoxin peroxidase 1 and a previously uncharacterized protein, AAH31411.1/SENP8 (see Fig. 1B, lane 3 and Fig. 2, A–C). Intriguingly, the predicted AAH31411.1 open reading frame encodes for a protein that shares a strong homology with the Ulp1 SUMO-1 family of isopeptidases (33Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Subsequent immunoblot analysis, using polyclonal antibodies raised against the recombinant AAH31411.1 protein, detected a polypeptide of 24 kDa that peaked coincident with the DEN1 cleavage activity (Fig. 1C, lanes 3–5). These results, together with the subsequent demonstration of Nedd8 protease activities by the recombinant AAH31411.1 protein (see below), unequivocally identify that DEN1 is encoded by AAH31411.1.As revealed by sequence analysis, DEN1 contains a His/Asp/Cys catalytic triad, the signature motif for a large family of cysteinyl protease (Fig. 2D) (34Wilkinson K.D. Hochstrasser M. Peters J.-M. Harris J.R. Finley D. Ubiquitin and the Biology of the Cell. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1998: 99-125Crossref Google Scholar). Further, homologues of DEN1 are found in mouse, Drosophila, and Arabidopsis, the latter two of which exhibit ∼35% sequence identity and ∼58% overall amino acid conservation with the human counterpart. Taken together, these data suggest that DEN1 is an evolutionarily conserved cysteinyl protease.DEN1 Specifically Binds Nedd8 and Efficiently Processes"
https://openalex.org/W2119393589,"During myocardial ischemia, connexin 43 (Cx43) is dephosphorylated in vitro, and the subsequent opening of gap junctions formed by two opposing Cx43 hexamers was suggested to propagate ischemia/reperfusion injury. Reduction of infarct size (IS) by ischemic preconditioning (IP) involves activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), both of which can phosphorylate Cx43. We now studied in anesthetized pigs whether IP impacts on Cx43 phosphorylation by measuring the density of non-phosphorylated and total Cx43 (confocal laser) during normoperfusion and 90-min ischemia in non-preconditioned and preconditioned hearts. Co-localization of PKCalpha, p38MAPKalpha, and p38MAPKbeta with Cx43 and the activity of p38MAPK were assessed. IP by 10 min ischemia and 15 min reperfusion reduced IS. Non-phosphorylated Cx43 remained unchanged during ischemia in preconditioned hearts, while it increased from 35+/-3 to 75+/-8 AU (P<0.05) in non-preconditioned hearts. Co-localization of PKCalpha, p38MAPKalpha, and p38MAPKbeta with Cx43 during ischemia increased only in preconditioned hearts. While the ischemia-induced increase in p38MAPKalpha activity was comparable in preconditioned and non-preconditioned hearts, p38MAPKbeta activity was increased only in preconditioned hearts. Blockade of p38MAPK by SB203580 attenuated the IS-reduction and the increased p38MAPK-Cx43 co-localization by IP. We conclude that IP increases co-localization of protein kinases with Cx43 and preserves phosphorylation of Cx43 during ischemia."

This enzymatic activation of a proantimicrobial substance in seminal plasma following exposure to the vaginal milieu represents a novel mechanism to prevent infection following sexual intercourse. Antimicrobial peptides are important effector molecules of the innate immune system from insects to humans (1Zasloff M. Nature. 2002; 415: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (6575) Google Scholar, 2Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway C.A. Ezekowitz R.B. Science. 1999; 284: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar). The peptides are active against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as some fungi and enveloped viruses. These peptides may play a role in the regulation of the normal microflora (3Boman H.G. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 173: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In mammals, the antimicrobial peptides are of major importance for the antimicrobial efficacy of professional phagocytes such as neutrophils and macrophages, but the peptides are also expressed in epithelial cells (4Lehrer R.I. Ganz T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). In mammals, there are two large families of antimicrobial peptides, defensins and cathelicidins. Defensins are divided into the α-defensins found in neutrophils, macrophages, and Paneth cells in the small intestine, and the β-defensins, which are found widespread in epithelial cells. Cathelicidins are found mainly in neutrophils (5Zanetti M. Gennaro R. Romeo D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Members of this protein family share a highly conserved N terminus of 12 kDa, named cathelin after a protein isolated from porcine neutrophils (6Ritonja A. Kopitar M. Jerala R. Turk V. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Antimicrobial peptides are synthesized as preproproteins and (with the exception of defensins in neutrophils) stored as inactive proproteins (7Ganz T. CIBA Found. Symp. 1994; 186: 62-76PubMed Google Scholar). In order to become biologically active, the peptides must be liberated from the proproteins by proteolytic cleavage. The proteolytic generation of antimicrobial peptides is very important for the clearance of bacteria at sites of infection. In mice, α-defensins from Paneth cells in the small intestine are generated by matrilysin-mediated cleavage of prodefensins, and matrilysin knock-out mice have increased susceptibility to intestinal infections (8Wilson C.L. Ouellette A.J. Satchell D.P. Ayabe T. Lopez-Boado Y.S. Stratman J.L. Hultgren S.J. Matrisian L.M. Parks W.C. Science. 1999; 286: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Inhibition of activation of the porcine neutrophil cathelicidins by elastase impairs clearance of bacteria from wounds in vivo (9Cole A.M. Shi J. Ceccarelli A. Kim Y.H. Park A. Ganz T. Blood. 2001; 97: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The only human cathelicidin, hCAP-18, is a major protein of the specific granules of human neutrophils (10Sørensen O. Arnljots K. Cowland J.B. Bainton D.F. Borregaard N. Blood. 1997; 90: 2796-2803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is processed to the antimicrobial peptide LL-37 by extracellular cleavage by proteinase 3 from azurophil granules following exocytosis (11Sørensen O.E. Follin P. Johnsen A.H. Calafat J. Tjabringa G.S. Hiemstra P.S. Borregaard N. Blood. 2001; 97: 3951-3959Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). LL-37 has broad spectrum antimicrobial activity toward Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (12Turner J. Cho Y. Dihn N.-N. Waring A. Lehrer R.I. J. Antimicrob.

The strongest epithelial expression of hCAP-18 is found in the epididymis with a subsequent high concentration in seminal plasma (22Malm J. Sørensen O. Persson T. Frohm-Nilsson M. Johansson B.

How the epithelium-derived hCAP-18 is processed to generate an active antimicrobial peptide is not known. Because of the high concentration of hCAP-18 in seminal plasma, we chose this as a model to study the processing and antimicrobial activation of hCAP-18 expressed in epithelial cells. Vaginal fluid and freshly ejaculated semen was collected from healthy volunteers at an outpatient fertility clinic. The semen was allowed to liquefy for 1 h at room temperature followed by centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was collected. Both the seminal plasma and the vaginal fluid were then stored at –20 °C until further use. After thawing, the seminal plasma and vaginal fluid were used immediately for cleavage experiments. Semen was installed in the vagina of women undergoing insemination and collected after 4 h. Postcoital vaginal fluid was collected 10 h following sexual intercourse and stored at –20 °C until further analysis. Polyclonal anti-hCAP-18 antibodies were previously described (24Sørensen O. Cowland J.B. Askaa J. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 206: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). A monoclonal antibody against LL-37 was generated by immunization of mice with glutaraldehyde-cross-linked synthetic LL-37 using conventional hybridoma technology. 1G. S. Tjabringa, J. Aarbiou, D. K. Ninaber, J.-W. Drijfhout, O. E. Sørensen, N. Borregaard, K. F. Rabe, and P. S. Hiemstra, submitted for publication. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies against progastricsin (pepsinogen C) were purchased from U.S. Biological (Swampscott, MA). Synthetic LL-37 and ALL-38 were purchased from Schafer-N (Copenhagen, Denmark). The peptides were synthesized using the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) strategy, purified by reverse phase chromatography, and analyzed by HPLC coupled to a Shimadzu LCMS-QP8000 spectrometer. The purity of the peptides was greater than 95%. Gastricsin, purified as described, was generously provided by Pal B. Szecsi (25Szecsi P.B. Koch C. Foltmann B. FEBS Lett. 1988; 238: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The pH of samples of seminal plasma was adjusted to pH 4 by the addition of 0.5 m sodium acetate and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h. Following incubation, the pH was neutralized by the addition of Tris buffer, and the samples were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer. SDS-PAGE (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and immunoblottting (27Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For immunoblotting, the polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) 2The abbreviations used are: PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; PIPES, piperazine-N,N′-bis-2-ethanesulfonic acid; HOMOPIPES, homopiperazin-N,N′-bis-2-(ethansulfonsyre); HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; MSMS, tandem MS; cfu, colony-forming units. membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) were blocked for 1 h with 5% skimmed milk in phosphate-buffered saline after the transfer of proteins from the 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. For detection of hCAP-18 or fragments derived thereof, the PVDF membranes were incubated overnight with primary antibodies. The following day, the membranes were incubated for 2 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) and visualized by diaminobenzidine/metal concentrate and stable substrate buffer (Pierce). Fragments of hCAP-18, generated by cleavage of hCAP-18 in seminal plasma at pH 4, were affinity-purified on an anti-hCAP-18 antibody column. To identify the cathelin part, the eluted material was dialyzed against 25 mm Tris (pH 8.5) and subjected to anion exchange chromatography on a MonoQ column using Äkta-FPLC (Amersham Biosciences). Bound material was eluted with a gradient of NaCl from 25 mm to 1 m in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. One peak containing proteins of ∼14 kDa was eluted at 0.2 m NaCl. The protein was repurified and desalted by reverse phase HPLC employing a Vydac C4 column (2.1 × 150 mm) equilibrated with 10% solvent B and eluted with a 1%/min gradient from solvent A to solvent B (solvent A: 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B: 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile). The purified protein was reduced and derivatized with iodoacetamide, as described by Matsudaira (28Matsudaira P.T. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. Academic Press, Inc., New York1989: 20-23Google Scholar), followed by HPLC purification as described above. The derivatized cathelin was dissolved in 50 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0) and digested with 0.5 μg of endoproteinase Asp-N (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) overnight at 37 °C. Then 50 μl of 5% formic acid was added, and the reaction mixture was loaded onto a C18 ZipTip (Millipore), washed with 0.5% formic acid, and eluted with 10 μl of 0.5% formic acid in 50% acetonitrile. An aliquot of 2 μl of the purified peptide mixture was introduced into a Q-Tof-2 tandem mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) using the nanospray interface and analyzed in MS mode as well as in MSMS mode for selected fragments to confirm their structure. Amino acid sequence was analyzed on the PVDF-blotted protein in a 494 A Procise Protein Sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the blot cartridge and PVDF cycles. All reagents and solvents were supplied by PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Antibodies against gastricsin and normal rabbit immunoglobulins were incubated with Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7) with 0.5 m NaCl. The Sepharose particles were subsequently washed seven times in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5 m NaCl to remove unbound antibodies followed by incubation with seminal plasma at 4 °C for 4 h. 0.5 m NaCl were added to the seminal plasma before immunoprecipitation to prevent nonspecific absorption to the Sepharose particles. The Sepharose particles were pelleted by centrifugation. The supernatants were aspirated and immediately used for cleavage experiments. Seminal plasma was applied to an affinity chromatography column with anti-hCAP-18 antibodies immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) as described by the manufacturer. The column was washed extensively, and the bound protein was eluted with 0.2 m glycine HCl (pH 2.5). hCAP-18 was purified from specific granules of human neutrophils by affinity chromatography and by cation exchange chromatography as previously described (11Sørensen O.E. Follin P. Johnsen A.H. Calafat J. Tjabringa G.S. Hiemstra P.S. Borregaard N. Blood. 2001; 97: 3951-3959Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Growth Inhibition—The bacterial strains of Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922 and strain 1655 (genome-sequenced K12 strain)); Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923); Bacillus megaterium (Bm11), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 were tested for purity on trypticase soy agar (Oxoid CM131) and inoculated in M9 salts (29Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) with glucose and casamino acids (M9GC) overnight at 37 °C. LL-37 and ALL-38 were dissolved in M9CG at 100 μg/ml and sterile-filtered, and further 10-fold dilutions were prepared in sterile M9CG. The peptide containing M9GC was pipetted into 96-microwell plates in volumes of 200 μl. All concentrations were tested in duplicate. The plate included M9GC with no peptide as growth control and noninoculated M9GC for check of sterile conditions. Experiments were conducted with M9GC adjusted to pH 7 and M9GC adjusted to pH 5 (using HCl) to determine whether increased antibacterial activity was observed at the lower pH. The wells were inoculated with 20 μl of a 10-fold dilution of Bacillus and Staphylococcus and 20 μl of a 100-fold dilution of the two E. coli strains and of P. aeruginosa. This corresponded to the addition of 2 × 105 cfu to each well. Absorbance at 450 nm was read, and the plate was incubated at 37 °C. Absorbance was read after 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, and 10 days. At day 10, 10-fold dilution series were prepared from all wells with peptides where bacterial growth had not occurred (S. aureus and B. megaterium). Colony counts were made by surface plating on trypticase soy agar. It has previously been noted that the composition of the growth medium is important when testing the antibacterial activity of LL-37 (12Turner J. Cho Y. Dihn N.-N. Waring A. Lehrer R.I. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1998; 42: 2206-2214Crossref Google Scholar). Accordingly, we used a defined medium M9GC. In this medium, we repeatedly found a growth delay of S. aureus, which was not found in nutrient-rich media like brain heart infusion. This could be due to the autoinhibition, which has been described for other Gram-positive bacteria (30Tomas M.S. Bru E. Nader-Macias M.E. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 2003; 188: 35-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 31Georgalaki M.D. Van Den B.E. Kritikos D. Devreese B. Van Beeumen J. Kalantzopoulos G. De Vuyst L.

Bactericidal Activity against Log Phase Cells—E. coli MG1655 was precultured in M9GC and inoculated at ∼100 cfu/ml in M9GC and incubated at 37 °C with aeration. When A 450 nm reached 0.1, the culture was diluted 1000-fold in medium and mixed (400-μl volume) with sterile-filtered solutions of LL-37 and ALL-38 (125-μl volumes) dissolved in distilled water. Concentrations of peptides tested were 0, 3, 6, 12, 25, 50, and 100 μg/ml. The bacteria-peptide mixtures were incubated at 37 °C, and samples were taken immediately after mixing for colony counts and after 2, 6, and 24 h. Bactericidal Activity against Stationary Phase Cells—S. aureus was cultured in brain heart infusion (Oxoid CM225), and E. coli was cultured in M9GC overnight at 37 °C. The cultures were harvested at 3,500 × g for 3 min and resuspended in either PIPES (pH 7; Sigma catalog no. P6757) or HOMOPIPES (pH 4). Absorbance at 450 nm was adjusted to 0.2. The bacterial suspensions were mixed (equal volumes) with peptide ALL-38, resulting in final concentrations of 50 or 5 or 0.5 μg/ml at both pH values. Stock solutions of peptide were prepared in either PIPES or HOMOPIPES. Bacterial levels were determined by surface plating 0, 3, and 24 h after mixing. Cleavage of hCAP-18 in Seminal Plasma at Low pH— hCAP-18 is present in seminal plasma, appearing as a double band around 18 kDa as observed by immunoblotting (22Malm J. Sørensen O. Persson T. Frohm-Nilsson M. Johansson B. Bjartell A. Lilja H. Ståhle-Bäckdahl M. Borregaard N. Egesten A. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4297-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Incubation of seminal plasma at neutral pH for 6 h at 37 °C did not change the observed molecular forms of hCAP-18 (Fig. 1, A and B, lane a). However, following incubation at pH 4, bands were observed around 14 kDa together with a low molecular weight band at 5–6 kDa when immonoblotting was performed with polyclonal anti-hCAP-18 antibodies (Fig. 1A, lane b), but only the 5–6-kDa band was observed when blotting was done with the monoclonal anti-LL-37 antibody (Fig. 1B, lane b). Thus, cleavage of endogenous hCAP-18 in seminal plasma at low pH generates a fragment at the size of LL-37, which reacts with the monoclonal anti-LL-37 antibody. The bands at ∼14 kDa detected with the polyclonal anti-hCAP-18 antibodies were not detected by the monoclonal anti-LL-37 antibody. These fragments represent the cathelin part of hCAP-18 as further validated below. This corresponds to the cleavage of hCAP-18 found in exocytosed material from neutrophils, where LL-37 is cleaved from the cathelin part (11Sørensen O.E. Follin P. Johnsen A.H. Calafat J. Tjabringa G.S. Hiemstra P.S. Borregaard N. Blood. 2001; 97: 3951-3959Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). The double bands of hCAP-18 observed previously in seminal plasma (22Malm J. Sørensen O. Persson T. Frohm-Nilsson M. Johansson B. Bjartell A. Lilja H. Ståhle-Bäckdahl M. Borregaard N. Egesten A. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4297-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 32Martin R.C. Duquenne C. Treton D. Lefevre A. Finaz C. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1998; 49: 286-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) must be due to either posttranslational modifications or to proteolytic processing occurring during sampling of the ejaculate. To exclude an artifactual proteolysis occurring during sampling, endogenous hCAP-18 was removed, and the ability of seminal plasma to process purified hCAP-18 from neutrophil-specific granules was examined. Fig. 2 shows that purified hCAP-18 is processed to generate a low molecular weight band at low pH, which is recognized by the monoclonal anti-LL-37 antibody (Fig. 2B, lane b) and an additional single band of 14 kDa, which can be observed when immunoblotting is performed with the polyclonal anti-hCAP-18 antibodies (Fig. 2A, lane b). This argues that the endogenous epididymal-derived hCAP-18 and exogenous neutrophil-derived hCAP-18 are processed in a similar way in seminal plasma and that the double band appearance of epididymal-derived hCAP-18 is due to a possible posttranslational modification and not to proteolysis occurring during sampling. Identification of hCAP-18 Fragments Generated in Seminal Plasma at Low pH—To further identify the hCAP-18 fragments generated in seminal plasma at pH 4, these fragments were affinity-purified using an anti-hCAP-18 antibody column. An aliquot of the eluate from the antibody column was concentrated by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid and was subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted to a PVDF membrane. The low molecular mass fragment of 5–6 kDa was analyzed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the first 10 residues. These were identified as ALLGDFFRKS, consistent with the 38-amino acid peptide ALL-38. To purify the peptides of 14 kDa seen by immunoblotting with polyclonal anti-hCAP-18 antibodies, the remains of the eluate from the antibody column were subjected to anion exchange chromatography. The 14-kDa peptides eluted at ∼0.2 m NaCl. As expected, these peptides were not recognized by the monoclonal anti LL-37 antibody but only by the polyclonal anti-hCAP-18 antibodies (Fig. 1, A and B, lane c). The N terminus of hCAP-18 (and of the cathelin part) is blocked for protein sequence analysis (33Cowland J.B. Johnsen A.H. Borregaard N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). In order to further identify the purified 14-kDa peptides, fragments hereof were generated by cleavage with endoproteinase Asp-N and identified by mass spectrometry. All of the generated fragments corresponded to segments in the cathelin part of hCAP-18 (Fig. 3). The most C-terminal fragment identified was the fragment 98–102 DNKRF (Table I), which is the expected C terminus of the cathelin part of hCAP-18 if this is cleaved to liberate ALL-38.Table IAnalysis of fragments produced by endoproteinase Asp-N cleavage of the 14-kDa fragments of hCAP-18 generated in seminal plasma at low pHFragmentMolecular massExperimentalTheoreticalaIncluding carboxamide derivative of Cys residues.

Open table in a new tab The immunoblotting with the monoclonal anti-LL-37 antibody and the identity of purified fragments generated in seminal plasma demonstrated that hCAP-18 was cleaved between the cathelin part of the molecule and its C-terminal peptide ALL-38 in seminal plasma. Antimicrobial Activity of LL-37 and ALL-38 —To verify the assumed antimicrobial activity of ALL-38, both synthetic LL-37 and ALL-38 were generated. The antimicrobial activity of LL-37 and ALL-38 was tested against strains of E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and B. megaterium (Fig. 4), where no difference was found between the two peptides. Both E. coli strains were inhibited by 100 μg/ml for 2 days, after which normal growth occurred. The growth of P. aeruginosa was not affected by the presence of the peptides (data not shown). The Gram-positive strains were more sensitive, being inhibited by 100 and 10 μg/ml for 10 days. At day 10, 10-fold dilution series were made from samples with peptides where no growth had occurred (B. megaterium and S. aureus) (i.e. from wells where the absorbance remained as the sterile control). Colony counts were made by surface plating on trypticase soy agar. No growth was detected from wells inoculated with B. megaterium, whereas colonies were detected from S. aureus-containing wells where growth had not occurred. These findings indicate that the peptides had a bactericidal effect toward B. megaterium and a bacteriostatic effect toward the staphylococci. The same result was found for both LL-37 and ALL-38. The results also indicate that the peptides were stable over time, since the bacteriostatic effect was retained for more than a week. Exponentially growing E. coli cells were then exposed to the peptides in different concentrations. Initial concentrations of cells were approximately 106 cfu/ml. Immediately after mixing, the peptides caused a reduction in culturable count of approximately 1 log unit (Table II). At the sampling after 2 h, both LL-37 and ALL-38 caused a dramatic reduction of viable cells to or below 104 cfu/ml at 12–100 μg/ml. After 6 h, cell densities in the three highest concentrations were approximately 102 to 103 cfu/ml. Bacterial densities remained low in the highest concentrations of the two peptides 24 h after mixing, whereas growth resumed in the lower concentrations. Again, the antibacterial activity of ALL-38 was equal to that of LL-37.Table IIBacteriolytic effect of LL-37 and ALL-38 on growing cells of E. coli in M9GC at 37°CPeptideTimeBacterial levels0aConcentration of peptide in μg/ml.3.26.312.52550100hcfu/mlLL-3708.0 × 1051.1 × 1061.2 × 1067.0 × 1054.5 × 1052.9 × 1051.0 × 10537.2 × 1061.2 × 1073.4 × 1062 × 104<104<104<10463.0 × 1083.4 × 1081.8 × 1083 × 1051 × 1022.8 × 1031 × 103246.0 × 1081.3 × 1091.0 × 1091.0 × 1095.7 × 104<1025 × 102ALL-3801.2 × 1061.3 × 1061.2 × 1061.2 × 1063.6 × 1054.2 × 1055 × 10438.0 × 1061.1 × 1071.2 × 1071 × 105<104<104<10463.8 × 1084.5 × 1083.7 × 1086.5 × 1051 × 102<1021.0 × 102247.0 × 1089.0 × 1081.2 × 1091.2 × 1093.3 × 105<1026.0 × 102a Concentration of peptide in μg/ml. Open table in a new tab Since no difference was seen between the two peptides, only ALL-38 was used to test bacteriolytic activity on nongrowing cell suspensions. No bacteriolytic activity was seen when cells suspended in buffers were exposed to the peptide, independent of pH (Table III).

The cleavage of hCAP-18 was not inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride or aprotinin (general inhibitors of serine proteases), EDTA (inhibitor of metalloproteases), chymostatin (chymotrypsin-like protease inhibitor), or E-64 (cysteine protease inhibitor) (Fig. 5, lanes b–f). The cleavage of hCAP-18 was, however, totally abolished by pepstatin A (an aspartic protease inhibitor) (Fig. 5, lane g). Low pH activates the proform of the aspartic protease gastricsin (pepsin C) in seminal plasma (34Reid W.A. Vongsorasak L. Svasti J. Valler M.J. Kay J. Cell Tissue Res. 1984; 236: 597-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and the addition of the specific pepsin inhibitor, pepsinostreptin, totally abolished the cleavage of hCAP-18 (Fig. 5, lane h). To further validate that gastricsin was responsible for the cleavage of hCAP-18, gastricsin was immunoprecipitated from seminal plasma. Following precipitation with preimmune rabbit antibodies, cleavage was still observed at low pH (Fig. 6, lane b). However, following immunoprecipitation with antigastricsin antibodies, cleavage of hCAP-18 was abolished (Fig. 6, lane a). The antibodies used for immunoprecipitation of gastricsin reacted with purified gastricsin (data not shown). Cleavage Experiments with Purified Gastricsin—To further verify the gastricsin-mediated cleavage of hCAP-18 in seminal plasma, hCAP-18, purified from both neutrophils and seminal plasma, was incubated with gastricsin at pH 4. Gastricsin cleaved hCAP-18 from both sources (Fig. 7, A and B, lanes b and d). The cleavage of seminal plasma-derived hCAP-18 gave rise to two bands at ∼14 kDa, and the neutrophi"
https://openalex.org/W2069967133,"Dysregulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity is implicated in tissue destruction under inflammatory conditions. An important mechanism controlling enzymatic activity might involve reactive oxygen species generated by phagocytes. Myeloperoxidase, a heme protein secreted by neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages, uses hydrogen peroxide to generate hypochlorous acid (HOCl). We demonstrate that HOCl inhibits the activity of human matrilysin (MMP-7) in vitro, suggesting that it might limit proteolytic activity during inflammation. When MMP-7 was exposed to HOCl generated by myeloperoxidase, the proteinase lost activity. High performance liquid chromatographic analysis of the tryptic digest of the HOCl-treated proteinase demonstrated the absence of two peptides that were present in the untreated enzyme. Tandem mass spectrometric analysis revealed that both of the lost peptides contained methionine and tryptophan-glycine residues. The methionine residue of one of the peptides had been oxidized to methionine sulfoxide. In contrast, the major product from the other peptide was 4 atomic mass units smaller than its precursor (WG—4). This novel oxidation product was derived though modification of adjacent tryptophan and glycine residues in the catalytic domain of the enzyme. Loss of proteolytic activity was associated with conversion of the precursor peptide to WG—4 but not with methionine oxidation. In contrast, hydrogen peroxide failed to oxidize MMP-7 or to inactivate the enzyme. Thus, HOCl inactivates MMP-7, perhaps by site-specific conversion of tryptophan-glycine to WG—4. This inactivation mechanism is distinct from the well studied mechanisms involving tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases. Our findings suggest that local pericellular production of HOCl by phagocytes is a physiological mechanism for governing MMP activity during inflammation.

Loss of proteolytic activity was associated with conversion of the precursor peptide to WG—4 but not with methionine oxidation. In contrast, hydrogen peroxide failed to oxidize MMP-7 or to inactivate the enzyme. Thus, HOCl inactivates MMP-7, perhaps by site-specific conversion of tryptophan-glycine to WG—4. This inactivation mechanism is distinct from the well studied mechanisms involving tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases. Our findings suggest that local pericellular production of HOCl by phagocytes is a physiological mechanism for governing MMP activity during inflammation.

These zinc endopeptidases are produced as latent proteins; hence, mechanisms that convert pro-MMPs to catalytically active MMPs are essential for regulating enzyme function. Once activated, MMPs can be inactivated by endogenous tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (5Woessner J.F. Nagase H. Matrix Metalloproteinases and TIMPs. Oxford University Press, New York2000Google Scholar) or by internalization (7Walling H.W. Chan P.T. Omura T.H. Barmina O.Y. Fiacco G.J. Jeffrey J.J. Partridge N.C. J. Cell.

Dysregulation of this balance is implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases, such as atherosclerosis, aneurysm formation, emphysema, and tumor growth and metastasis (1Woessner J.F.

Matrix Metalloproteinases and TIMPs. Oxford University Press, New York2000Google Scholar). In the inactive state, this conserved thiol binds to the zinc atom of the catalytic domain preventing the latent enzyme from becoming inappropriately active. A pro-MMP can be activated in vitro by proteolytic cleavage of its prodomain, which releases the thiol-zinc interaction and consequently frees the catalytic site to interact with substrate. However, activation of pro-MMPs can be mediated by processes that disrupt the thiol-zinc interaction, and it is likely that proteolysis is not the sole mechanism controlling MMP activity (10Van Wart H.E.

Myeloperoxidase, a heme protein secreted by neutrophils, monocytes, and some populations of macrophages, is one potential source of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (17Hurst J.K.

Chem. 1976; 251: 1371-1374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). H2O2+Cl-+H+→HOCl+H2O(Eq. 1) HOCl is a potent cytotoxic oxidant that converts pro-collagenase-2, pro-gelatinase B, and pro-matrilysin (MMP-7) into their proteolytically active forms (11Weiss S.J.

Tryptophan residues in proteins also appear to be important targets for damage (25Finley E.L. Dillon J. Crouch R.K. Schey K.L. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2391-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Therefore, HOCl might control MMP activity by covalently modifying key amino acid residues in the enzyme (26Stadtman E.R. Science. 1992; 257: 1220-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (2377) Google Scholar).Pro-MMP-7, pro-collagenase-2, and pro-gelatinase B exposed to increasing concentrations of HOCl initially increase their proteolytic activities (11Weiss S.J.

We recently demonstrated that HOCl converts the thiol residue of the cysteine switch domain of pro-MMP-7 to the corresponding sulfinic acid (21Fu X. Kassim S.Y. Parks W.C. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41279-41287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Thiol oxidation is associated with autolytic cleavage of pro-MMP-7, strongly suggesting that oxygenation activates the latent enzyme. We have proposed that this pathway plays a critical role in the rupture of atherosclerotic lesions (18Daugherty A. Dunn J.L. Rateri D.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin.

These observations suggest that HOCl provides an oxidative mechanism for activating latent MMPs in vascular disease (28Steinberg D. J. Biol.

FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1113-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, hypercholesterolemic mice deficient in myeloperoxidase develop more atherosclerosis than do wild-type mice (30Brennan M.L. Anderson M.M. Shih D.M. Qu X.D. Wang X. Mehta A.C. Lim L.L. Shi W.

In the current studies, we have proposed potential mechanisms for enzyme inactivation and demonstrated that HOCl, but not H2O2, oxidizes methionine and tryptophan residues of active MMP-7. When a specific tryptophan is converted to a novel oxidation product, the active enzyme loses catalytic activity. These observations reveal a molecular mechanism for inactivating MMPs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsUnless otherwise indicated, all materials were purchased from Sigma. Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), H2O2, HEPES, trifluoroacetic acid, and HPLC-grade CH3CN were obtained from Fisher. Human matrilysin (MMP-7) was obtained from Chemicon International Inc. (Temecula, CA) and Calbiochem. Myeloperoxidase (A 430/A 280 ratio > 0.8) was purified from HL-60 cells by sequential lectin affinity, ion exchange, and size-exclusion chromatographies (32Heinecke J.W. Li W. Daehnke 3rd, H.L.

Reactions were initiated by adding oxidant and terminated by adding a 10-fold molar excess (relative to oxidant) of l-methionine. Concentrations of HOCl and H2O2 were determined spectrophotometrically (ϵ 292 = 350 m–1 cm–1 and ϵ240 = 39.4 m–1 cm–1) (35Morris J.C. J. Phys.

Biochem. 1972; 49: 474-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar).Proteolytic Digestion—MMP-7 (100 pmol) was incubated overnight at 37 °C with sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) at a ratio of 25:1 (w/w) MMP-7:trypsin in buffer C (10% CH3CN, 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0). Digestion was halted by freezing the mixture or acidifying (pH 2–3) it with formic acid or trifluoroacetic acid.Liquid Chromatography (LC) Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MS)—LC-MS analyses were performed in the positive ion mode with a Finnigan MAT LCQ ion trap instrument (San Jose, CA) coupled to a Waters 2690 HPLC system (Milford, MA) as described (21Fu X. Kassim S.Y. Parks W.C. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41279-41287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Tryptic peptides were separated at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min on a reverse-phase column (Vydac C18 MS column; 2.1 × 25 mm) using solvent A (0.2% formic acid in water) and solvent B (0.2% formic acid in 80% CH3CN, 20% water). Peptides were eluted using the following linear gradient: 0 to 15% B over 15 min; 15 to 30% B over 25 min; then 30 to 65% B over 20 min. The electrospray needle was held at 4500 volts. Nitrogen, the sheath gas, was set at 80 units. The collision gas was helium. The temperature of the heated capillary was 220 °C.Assay of MMP-7 Proteolytic Activity—MMP-7 activity was assayed using Invitrogen precast casein zymogram gels or in solution (21Fu X. Kassim S.Y.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with the fluorescent Mca peptide (7-methoxycoumarin-4-acetyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-β-(2,4-dinitrophenylamino)Ala-Ala-Arg-NH2) as the substrate. MMP-7 (15–30 ng) was added to individual wells of a 96-well microtiter plate containing 500 μl of buffer C (0.2 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.02% NaN3, 0.05% w/v Brij35) and 2 μm Mca peptide and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Fluorescence (λex = 328 nm, λem = 392 nm) was monitored using a microplate reader (SPECTRAmax GEMINI XS, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).RESULTSHOCl Inactivates MMP-7—To determine whether oxidants inactivate MMP-7 in vitro, we exposed activated enzyme to HOCl or H2O2 for 30 min at 37 °C in buffer B. Then we determined whether MMP-7 could cleave Mca, a synthetic fluorescent peptide. MMP-7 exposed to increasing concentrations of HOCl lost its proteolytic activity (Fig. 1). Zymographic analysis of MMP-7 with casein also showed that the enzyme lost activity when it was exposed to HOCl. MMP-7 was inactivated by the complete myeloperoxidase system, consisting of enzyme, H2O2, and chloride ion (data not shown). In contrast, the same concentrations of H2O2 did not inhibit the proteolytic activity of MMP-7 (Fig. 1). These observations indicate that HOCl generated by myeloperoxidase can convert active MMP-7 to an enzymatically inactive form.HOCl Oxidizes Specific Residues in MMP-7—To investigate the molecular basis for the oxidative inactivation of MMP-7, we first digested unmodified enzyme with trypsin and identified the resulting peptides through LC-MS and MS/MS analysis (Fig. 2). The 11 peptides detected by LC-MS accounted for 92% of the protein sequence. Importantly, they included all of the amino acid residues of MMP-7 known to be highly susceptible to oxidation by HOCl or H2O2 (tryptophan (W) and methionine (M); (Fig. 2, peptides 1, 8, 10, and 11). Because of poor retention on the HPLC column, we were unable to identify small peptides and single amino acid residues.Fig. 2Total ion chromatogram of tryptic peptides of MMP-7 exposed to H2O2 or HOCl. MMP-7 was incubated alone (Control) (A) or with oxidant (50:1, mol/mol, oxidant/protein) (B and C) for 30 min at 37 °C in buffer A. After the reaction was terminated with methionine, the protein was digested with trypsin overnight at 37 °C, and the tryptic digest was analyzed by LC-MS. Note that LC-MS identified all of the MMP-7 peptides containing methionine or tryptophan (M or W, underlined) and that MS/MS confirmed the identities of these peptides: peptide 1, WTSK; peptide 2, LYGK; peptide 3, VVTYR; peptide 4, IVSYTR; peptide 5, LSQDDIK; peptide 6, EIPLHFRK; peptide 7, DLPHITVDR; peptide 8, ALNMWGK; peptide 9, YSLFPNSPK; peptide 10, VVWGTADIMIGFAR; peptide 11, GAHGDSYPFDGPGNTLAHAFAPGTGLGGD AHFDEDERWTDGSSLGINFLYAATHEL GHSLGMGHSSDPNAVMYPTYGNGDPQNFK. 8* and 10*, peptides lost upon HOCl exposure; A↓, peptide generated upon HOCl exposure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether HOCl modifies MMP-7 at specific sites, we exposed MMP-7 to a concentration of oxidant (50:1, mol/mol, oxidant/protein) that resulted in ∼80% inhibition of the enzyme and then analyzed a tryptic digest of the enzyme by LC-MS. When the oxidant was H2O2, the total ion chromatogram of the tryptic digest was indistinguishable from that of the tryptic digest obtained from the native protein (compare Fig. 2, A and B). In striking contrast, peptides 8 and 10 were selectively absent from the tryptic digest of MMP-7 exposed to HOCl (Fig. 2C, 8* and 10*). Loss of the two peptides was associated with the appearance of one major peak of material (termed peptide A) and four peaks of material that were poorly seen in the total ion chromatogram. These observations suggest that HOCl modified specific amino acids of MMP-7 converting two of the original peptides of the enzyme to five or more new peptides.HOCl Selectively Oxygenates the Methionine Residue in Peptide 8 —To identify the site at which HOCl modifies peptide 8, we exposed MMP-7 to H2O2, HOCl, or H2O2 supplemented with myeloperoxidase for 30 min at 37 °C in buffer A. We then digested the protein with trypsin and analyzed the digest by LC-MS. The reconstructed ion chromatogram of unmodified MMP-7 revealed a peak of material with the anticipated mass to charge ratio (m/z) of singly protonated peptide 8 (Fig. 3A, m/z 819.4, [M + H]+, retention time 27.5 min). MS/MS analysis confirmed the sequence of the peptide, ALNMWGK, which contained methionine and tryptophan residues (underlined letters) potentially susceptible to oxidation. The abundance of this peptide barely changed when MMP-7 was exposed to H2O2 alone. In contrast, when MMP-7 was exposed to HOCl alone or to H2O2 supplemented with myeloperoxidase, peptide 8 was absent from the tryptic digest, and a new peak of material was seen (compare Fig. 3, A and B). The retention time of this singly charged material resembled that of peptide A, and its m/z was 835.4 (Fig. 3C), which is consistent with the addition of 16 atomic mass units to peptide 8 ([M + 16 + 2H]+). MS/MS analysis of the modified peptide indicated that the methionine residue of peptide 8 had gained 16 atomic mass units (Fig. 3D). These observations demonstrate that HOCl generated by the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-Cl– system, but not H2O2 alone, converts the alkylated thiol group of the methionine residue in peptide 8 of MMP-7 to the sulfoxide. LC-MS and MS/MS analysis indicated that the tryptophan residue adjacent to this methionine residue remained intact.Fig. 3LC-MS and MS/MS analyses of peptide 8 in a tryptic digest of MMP-7 exposed to H2O2, HOCl, or HOCl generated by myeloperoxidase (MPO). MMP-7 was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in buffer A alone (Control) or buffer A supplemented with H2O2, HOCl, or H2O2 containing 5 nm myeloperoxidase (50:1, mol/mol, oxidant/protein). Following the addition of methionine, the protein was digested with trypsin overnight at 37 °C, and the tryptic peptides were analyzed by LC-MS.

We therefore used LC-MS and MS/MS to determine the relative abundance of peptide 10 and its potential oxidation products in tryptic digests of untreated MMP-7 and MMP-7 exposed to oxidant. MS/MS analysis confirmed the sequence of doubly protonated peptide 10 in the digest of unmodified MMP-7 (Fig. 4A). The relative abundance of this peptide (Fig. 2, A and B) changed little when MMP-7 was exposed to H2O2 alone. In contrast, when MMP-7 was exposed to HOCl or to H2O2 supplemented with myeloperoxidase, peptide 10 disappeared and several small peaks of material appeared in the total ion chromatogram of the tryptic digest (Fig. 2C). LC-MS analysis with reconstructed ion chromatograms showed that the tryptic digest contained four new peaks of material that appeared to derive from peptide 10 (data not shown): two major products of m/z 766.6 ([M – 4 + 2H]+2) and m/z 774.6 ([M + 12 + 2H]+2); and two minor products of 776.6 ([M + 16 + 2H]+2) and 784.6 ([M + 32 + 2H]+2).Fig. 4MS/MS analysis of peptide 10 in a tryptic digest of MMP-7 exposed to HOCl. MMP-7 was incubated with HOCl (50:1, mol/mol, oxidant/protein) for 30 min at 37 °C in buffer A.

This approach indicated that when peptide 10 gained 16 atomic mass units ([M + 16 + 2H]+2) the tryptophan residue was oxygenated. When peptide 10 gained 32 atomic mass units, both the methionine residue and the tryptophan residue became oxygenated ([M + 32 + 2H]+2). These observations suggest that the tryptophan residue in peptide 10 is more readily oxygenated than the methionine residue. These observations indicate that tryptophan and methionine residues in different regions of MMP-7 are differentially susceptible to oxidation by HOCl, perhaps because of differences in flanking sequences or the secondary or tertiary structure in the two regions of the enzyme.HOCl Converts the Tryptophan Residue of Peptide 10 to a Novel Oxidation Product—We next characterized the two major products that we had detected in the tryptic digest of MMP-7 exposed to HOCl. MS/MS analysis of the peptide of m/z 766.6 ([M – 4 + 2H]+2) (Fig. 4D) confirmed that this material was derived from peptide 10; it also revealed two important features: (i) loss of the y12 (Trp) and y11 ions (Gly) found in native peptide 10 and (ii) major ions at y10 (m/z 1094.4), and y12 – 4 (m/z 1333.5). These observations suggest that peptide 10 is modified by a reaction that removes 4 atomic mass units from WG. Detection of an ion of m/z 240.1 ([WG – 4 + 2H]+) by MS/MS (Fig. 4D) supported this interpretation.MS/MS analysis of the material of m/z 774.6 ([M + 12 + 2H]+2) demonstrated a ladder of y ions (Fig. 4E). This result was similar to that observed in the material of m/z 766.6 ([M – 4 + 2H]+2) except that the methionine residue had gained 16 atomic mass units ([M + 16 – 4 + 2H]+2). These observations indicate that the tryptophan residue in peptide 10 was more susceptible than that peptide's methionine residue was to oxidation by HOCl. They also strongly suggest that HOCl oxidized WG by removing 4 atomic mass units.HOCl Generated by Myeloperoxidase Converts WG to WG–4 in MMP-7—To determine whether HOCl generated by myeloperoxidase also oxidizes WG of peptide 10, we exposed MMP-7 to H2O2 alone, HOCl alone, or H2O2 supplemented with myeloperoxidase (H2O2 + MPO) for 30 min at 37 °C in buffer A. Reconstructed ion chromatograms were used to monitor the ions derived from peptide 10 in the tryptic digest of the enzyme. The doubly charged peptide 10 (m/z 768.6, [M + 2H]+2) was present in the digests of the native enzyme and of MMP-7 exposed to H2O2 alone (Fig. 5A). When the enzyme was exposed to HOCl or H2O2 supplemented with myeloperoxidase, peptide 10 disappeared almost completely. Its disappearance was associated with the appearance of product peptides (Fig. 5, B and C) that had either lost 4 atomic mass units (m/z 766.6, [M – 4 + 2H]+2) or had both"
https://openalex.org/W2056694575,"A conserved mRNA surveillance system, referred to as nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), exists in eukaryotic cells to degrade mRNAs containing nonsense codons. This process is important in checking that mRNAs have been properly synthesized and functions, at least in part, to increase the fidelity of gene expression by degrading aberrant mRNAs that, if translated, would produce truncated proteins. Using computational modeling and experimental analysis, we define the alterations in mRNA turnover triggered by NMD in yeast. We demonstrate that the nonsense-containing transcripts are efficiently recognized, targeted for deadenylation-independent decapping, and show NMD triggered accelerated deadenylation regardless of the position of the nonsense codon. We also show that 5' nonsense codons trigger faster rates of decapping than 3' nonsense codons, thereby providing a mechanistic basis for the polar effect of NMD. Finally, we construct a computational model that accurately describes the process of NMD and serves as an explanatory and predictive tool."

However, in subfractionated cardiac membranes, ETAR immunoreactivity was detected only in the plasma membrane whereas ETBR immunoreactivity was detected predominantly in membranes of intracellular origin. Confocal microscopy demonstrated the presence of intracellular ETAR and ETBR in ventricular myocytes. ETAR were primarily on plasma membrane (surface membranes and transverse-tubules) and to a lesser extent on the nucleus while ETBR localized primarily to the nuclei. Western blot analysis of nuclei isolated from the heart indicated the presence of endothelin receptors: both ETAR and ETBR copurified with nucleoporin 62, whereas markers of endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi membranes were depleted. Radioligand binding studies revealed that isolated nuclei contain specific [125I]ET-1 binding sites. Specific [125I]ET-1 binding was reduced by 70–80% using the ETAR-selective antagonist BQ610 and 20–30% using the ETBR-specific antagonist BQ788. IRL-1620, an ETBR-specific agonist, also reduced [125I]ET-1 binding. Furthermore, ET-1 and IRL-1620 altered the incorporation of 32P into nuclear proteins and caused a transient increase in nuclear Ca2+ concentration. Hence, cardiac nuclei possess both ETAR and ETBR subtypes, which are functional with respect to ligand binding and are coupled to signaling mechanisms within the nuclear membrane.

It is now thought that ET-1 may act in an autocrine/paracrine manner in the cardiac ventricular myocyte. All three endothelins are synthesized as larger precursor proteins, prepro-ETs, which are subsequently cleaved to 37–41-amino acid proforms, referred to as big endothelins. Big endothelins are converted to mature endothelins by endothelin-converting enzymes (ECE). Splice variants of the ECE-1 isoform, ECE-1a and ECE-1c, have been detected in adult cardiac myocytes (40Ergul A. Walker C.A. Goldberg A. Baicu S.C. Hendrick J.W. King M.K. Spinale F.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: H2050-H2056PubMed Google Scholar), and ECE-1c expression is up-regulated 5-fold in myocytes during congestive heart failure (40Ergul A. Walker C.A. Goldberg A. Baicu S.C.

Liu E.D.K. Webb M.L. Mukherjee R. Hebbar L. Spinale F.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H2629-H2637PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that cardiomyocytes may contain storage vesicles for ET-1 analogous to the Weibel-Palade bodies found in endothelial cells. Finally, both ETAR and ETBR subtypes are present in the rat heart (44Ishikawa T. Li L.M. Shinmi O. Kimura S. Yanagisawa M. Goto K. Masaki T. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 918-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and on adult rat ventricular myocytes (ETAR: ETBR = 4:1 (45Allen B.G. Farah H. Phuong L.L. Chevalier D. Can. J. Physiol.

All cellular activities of the endothelins are currently thought to be mediated through its interactions with specific receptors located on the cell surface.

In addition, endocytosed ET-1·ETBR reduces prepro-ET-1 mRNA levels (53Sanchez R. MacKenzie A. Farhat N. Nguyen T.-D. Stewart D.J. Mercier I. Calderone A. Thorin E. J. Cardiovasc.

Considering the major role the ET-1 system has in regulating heart function and dysfunction, the objectives of the present study were to determine the existence, localization, and subtype of intracellular endothelin receptors in ventricular myocytes. Our findings reveal: 1) nuclear/perinuclear localization of ETAR and ETBR immunoreactivity; 2) nuclear endothelin receptors are capable of specific ligand binding; 3) stimulation of the nuclear endothelin receptors induce a transient increase in nuclear cisternal Ca2+ content; and 4) stimulation of nuclear endothelin receptors activate endogenous nuclear protein kinase activities.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6145-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This preparation provided 8 to 10 million cells/heart with 70 to 85% viability, as assessed by the presence of quiescent cells with rod-shaped morphology. No other cell types were detected.

Hence, fractions 2–5 comprise different membranes of intracellular origin. Each fraction was centrifuged for 30 min at 42,000 rpm in a Beckman 50.2 Ti rotor then resuspended in 1 ml of 20 mm histidine/HCl buffer (pH 6.8 at 5 °C) containing 0.3 m KCl, 2 mm DTT, and 10 μm leupeptin, frozen using liquid nitrogen, and stored at –70 °C. Isolation of Nuclei—Rat cardiac nuclei were isolated according to a modified version of a previously described method (59Dawn B. Xuan Y. Marian M. Flaherty M.P. Murphree S.S. Smith T.L. Bolli R.

Briefly, rat hearts were pulverized under liquid nitrogen, resuspended in cold PBS and homogenized (Polytron, 8000 rpm; 2 × 10 s). The homogenate is referred to as the total extract (Fraction 1). All subsequent steps were carried out on ice or at 5 °C. Homogenates were centrifuged for 15 min at 500 × g and the supernatants, referred to as Fraction 2, were diluted 1:1 with buffer A (10 mm K-HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mm Na3VO4), incubated 10 min on ice, and centrifuged for 15 min at 2000 × g. The resulting supernatant was discarded and the pellet, referred to as the crude nuclei (Fraction 3), was resuspended in buffer B (0.3 m K-HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 m KCl, 0.03 m MgCl2, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mm Na3VO4), incubated on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged for 15 min at 2000 × g. The supernatant was removed and the pellet, referred to as the enriched nuclear fraction (Fraction 4), was resuspended in buffer C (20 mm Na-HEPES (pH 7.9), 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm DTT, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mm Na3VO4) and either used fresh or aliquoted, snap-frozen using liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. Sheep nuclei were isolated as described previously (60Guihard G. Proteau S. Rousseau E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Preparation of Rat Brain Membranes—Membranes were prepared from fresh rat brains by homogenizing in 5 volumes of 20 mm imidazole/HCl buffer (pH 6.8 at 5 °C) containing 0.3 m sucrose, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm NaN3, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.4 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin using a 25-ml Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder (10 strokes). Homogenates were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation for 10 min at 1000 × g and 5 °C and then membranes were pelleted by centrifugation for 60 min at 100,000 × g and 5 °C. Membranes were resuspended in 1 volume of homogenization buffer, aliquoted, snap-frozen using liquid nitrogen, and stored frozen at –80 °C. Immunoblotting—Proteins were separated on 10–20% (w/v) acrylamide-gradient SDS-PAGE. Following SDS-PAGE, samples were transferred at 100 V and 5 °C for 90 min onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes in a buffer comprising 25 mm Tris base, 192 mm glycine, and 5% methanol. Membranes were blocked for 2 h using a solution of 5% (w/v) skimmed milk powder (Carnation) in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5 at 20 °C), 150 mm NaCl (TBS), and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBST). Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies, diluted 1:1000 with 1.0% bovine serum albumin in TBST, for 16 h at 5 °C, washed with TBST (3 × 10 min), reblocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBST (1 × 10 min), and incubated for 2 h with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratories) diluted 1:25,000 in 5% (w/v) nonfat milk powder. Following extensive washing with TBST, immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Renaissance Plus, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions using Bio-Max MR film. Confocal Microscopy—The intracellular localization of the ETAR and ETBR subtypes was studied using a scanning confocal fluorescence microscope (LSM 510 Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Freshly isolated adult ventricular myocytes were plated on laminin-coated coverslips for 1 h (37 °C, 95% O2, 5% CO2) and fixed for 20 min in 2% paraformaldehyde solution containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Coverslips containing fixed myocytes were rinsed three times in PBS and incubated overnight at 4 °C in PBS containing 10% donkey serum. Excess serum was removed and the cells were incubated for1hat room temperature with primary antibody diluted 1:100 in PBS containing 1.5% donkey serum. The coverslips were then rinsed gently three times with PBS, drained, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a 1:500 (v/v) dilution of the appropriate secondary antibody (TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody, or Alexa 488-conjugated anti-sheep antibody). The coverslips were gently washed three times with PBS, drained, and mounted onto glass slides using a drop of 0.1% diazabicyclo(2.2.2)octane/glycerol medium. Fluorescent myocytes were visualized as serial 0.5-μm thick optical sections in the z-axis plane of each cell. To obtain confocal images of dual-labeled cells, Alexa 488 and TRITC emissions were collected simultaneously and composite images were created using the Zeiss software. For each secondary antibody, control experiments were performed in the absence of primary antibody. Where indicated, image stacks were digitally deconvolved (Huygens Professional, Scientific Volume Imaging). Receptor Binding Assays—Radioligand binding assays were performed essentially as described previously (45Allen B.G. Farah H. Phuong L.L. Chevalier D. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2003; 81: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) in a binding buffer comprising 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4 at 24 °C), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 40 pm [125I]ET-1. Binding was at room temperature for 2 h in a reaction volume of 250 μl. Non-radioactive ET-1, BQ610, BQ788, and IRL-1620 were prepared as 10 mm stocks in 100% Me2SO. Buffer, ligand, and antagonists were combined in the tubes (12 × 75-mm polypropylene). Preliminary experiments were performed to ascertain that [125I]ET-1 binding was linear with respect to protein concentration and that ligand binding was less than 10% of total added ligand. Binding was initiated by the addition of either 25 (sheep) or 100 (rat) μg of isolated nuclei. The reaction was stopped by rapid filtration under reduced pressure through Whatman glass microfiber filters (GF/C) with a cell harvester (Brandel). Tubes and filters were rinsed three times with cold 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Before filtration, filters were blocked by incubation for 60 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 5% (w/v) skim milk powder (Carnation). Radioactivity on the filters was quantified using a γ-counter (LKB Wallac). To determine the specific activity of the [125I]ET-1 solution, 10-μl aliquots were quantified in quadruplicate by γ-counting during each binding assay. Data were analyzed using a non-linear curve-fitting program (Prism 3.0cx, GraphPad Software). SDS-PAGE—[125I]ET-1 binding to ETAR and ETBR is essentially irreversible (45Allen B.G. Farah H. Phuong L.L. Chevalier D. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2003; 81: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and for ETBR, but not ETAR, binding is stable during SDS-PAGE at reduced temperature (61Takasuka T. Adachi M. Miyamoto C. Furuichi Y. Watanabe T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 112: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 62Takasuka T. Akiyama N. Horii I. Furuichi Y. Watanabe T. J. Biochem.

Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1104-1113PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the apparent molecular mass of proteins binding [125I]ET-1 and [125I]IRL-1620, isolated nuclei were incubated with 2.0 nm [125I]ET-1 or 2.2 nm [125I]IRL-1620 plus 1 μm unlabeled ET-1, 1 μm BQ610, or 1 μm BQ788, where indicated, for 1 h on ice in buffer comprising 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.02% sodium azide. Samples were then solubilized with Laemmli sample buffer and resolved, along with prestained molecular mass markers (Bio-Rad), on 10–20% (w/v) acrylamide-gradient SDS-PAGE. The electrophoresis cells were cooled to 15 °C using an external, circulating refrigeration system. Gels were dried between two cellophane sheets, and exposed to Bio-Max BMR films for 48 h at –80 °C in the presence of an intensifying screen (Kodak Bio-Max TranScreen-HE). Fluorometric Measurement Calcium—The effects of endothelin receptor agonists upon the permeability of the nuclear membrane to calcium ions were measured by fluorometry using the membrane-permeable, ratiometric calcium indicator, fura-2/AM. Fura-2/AM was prepared fresh daily as a 5 mm stock solution in anhydrous 100% Me2SO. Rat heart nuclei were employed immediately after isolation. Aliquots of isolated ventricular nuclei were resuspended in 0.5 ml of a loading buffer comprising 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 100 mm KCl, 2 mm K2HPO4, and 4 mm MgCl2. Fura-2/AM was added to the suspension of nuclei to a final concentration of 7.5 μm and incubated for 45 min on ice. The fura-2-loaded nuclei were then diluted 1:2 and washed free of extranuclear fura-2/AM by centrifugation for 5 min at 2,700 × g and 4 °C, resuspended once in 1 ml of loading buffer, and then centrifuged and resuspended in 50 μl of loading buffer. Fura-2-loaded nuclei were incubated for 15 min on ice for final hydrolysis. Nuclei were then added to 50 μl of loading buffer containing 800 nm CaCl2 and seeded onto glass slides. Where indicated ET-1, IRL-1620, or vehicle (Me2SO) were added directly to the nuclei. Fluorescence was measured using an Ion Optix microspectrofluorimeter using excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm and emission at 509 nm. Calibration of the fluorescent signal was determined by sequential addition of 10 μm ionomycin plus 1 mm CaCl2 to obtain the maximal fluorescence ratio (R max) and 4 mm EGTA to obtain the minimum fluorescence ratio (R min). Autofluorescence was determined by measuring fluorescence from non-loaded nuclei and subtracting it from the fluorescence produced by fura-2-loaded nuclei. Determination of Protein Kin"
https://openalex.org/W2111091913,"The Type I IFN receptor-generated signals required for initiation of mRNA translation and, ultimately, induction of protein products that mediate IFN responses, remain unknown. We have previously shown that IFNα and IFNβ induce phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate proteins and downstream engagement of the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3′-kinase pathway. In the present study we provide evidence for the existence of a Type I IFN-dependent signaling cascade activated downstream of PI 3′-kinase, involving p70 S6 kinase. Our data demonstrate that p70 S6K is rapidly phosphorylated on threonine 421 and serine 424 and is activated during treatment of cells with IFNα or IFNβ. Such activation of p70 S6K is blocked by pharmacological inhibitors of the PI 3′-kinase or the FKBP 12-rapamycin-associated protein/mammalian target of rapamycin (FRAP/mTOR). Consistent with this, the Type I IFN-dependent phosphorylation/activation of p70 S6K is defective in embryonic fibroblasts from mice with targeted disruption of the p85α and p85β subunits of the PI 3′-kinase (p85α–/–β–/–). Treatment of sensitive cell lines with IFNα or IFNβ also results in phosphorylation/inactivation of the 4E-BP-1 repressor of mRNA translation. Such 4E-BP1 phosphorylation is also PI3′-kinase-dependent and rapamycin-sensitive, indicating that the Type I IFN-inducible activation of PI3′-kinase and FRAP/mTOR results in dissociation of 4E-BP1 from the eukaryotic initiation factor-4E (eIF4E) complex. Altogether, our data establish that the Type I IFN receptor-activated PI 3′-kinase pathway mediates activation of the p70 S6 kinase and inactivation of 4E-BP1, to regulate mRNA translation and induction of Type I IFN responses.

Engagement of the Type I IFN receptor results in activation of the Tyk-2 and Jak-1 kinases, which in turn regulate downstream phosphorylation/activation of the STAT1 and STAT2 transcriptional activators. The phosphorylated forms of STAT1 and STAT2 associate with IRF-9 (p48) to form the mature ISGF3 DNA-binding complex that translocates to the nucleus and regulates gene transcription via binding to ISRE elements in the promoters of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (1Pestka S.

STAT 1:1 homodimers, STAT 3:3 homodimers, STAT 1:3 heterodimers, STAT 5:5 homodimers, and CrkL:STAT5 heterodimers are formed in a Type I IFN-dependent manner and translocate to the nucleus where they bind to GAS regulatory elements in the promoters of IFN-activated genes to regulate gene transcription (2Darnell Jr., J.E.

The signals generated by the Type I interferon receptor to ultimately regulate mRNA translation are not known. We have previously demonstrated that Type I IFNs activate the insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-PI 3′-kinase pathway in human and mouse cells (42Uddin S. Yenush L. Sun X. Sweet M.E. White M.F.

Immunol. 1997; 158: 2390-2397PubMed Google Scholar) kinase activities of the p110 catalytic subunit of the PI 3′-kinase are activated during engagement of the Type I interferon receptor. In the present study we sought to determine whether the p70 S6 kinase is activated downstream of the PI 3′-kinase to mediate induction of Type I IFN responses. Our data demonstrate that the p70 S6 kinase is rapidly phosphorylated and activated during treatment of sensitive cell lines with IFNα or IFNβ. They also show that the IFNα-dependent phosphorylation/activation of the p70 S6 kinase is defective in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from p85α–/– p85β–/– double knock-out mice. In other studies we establish that the translational mRNA repressor 4E-BP1 is phosphorylated in a Type I IFN-dependent manner, and such phosphorylation is also PI 3′-kinase-dependent, further demonstrating that activation of PI 3-kinase/mTOR by Type I IFNs ultimately induces signals important for mRNA translation. Cells Lines and Reagents—Human recombinant IFNα2 was provided by Hoffmann-La Roche. Human recombinant consensus IFNα was provided by Amgen Inc. Human recombinant IFNβ was provided by Biogen Inc. Antibodies against the phosphorylated forms of p70 S6 kinase, mTOR, and 4EBP-1 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. An antibody against 4EB-P1 has been previously described (46Gingras A.-C. Kennedy S.G. O'Leary M.A. Sonenberg N. Hay N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 502-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). The FRAP/mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, and the PI 3′-kinase inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin were obtained from Calbiochem Inc. (La Jolla, CA). U266 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with fetal bovine serum and antibiotics.

The p85α–/–β–/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts were obtained from p85α–/–β–/– double knock-out mice. Briefly, mouse embryos were harvested at day 14; the limbs, head, and liver removed, and the resultant torso was finely minced. Following trypsinization, the single cell suspension was transferred onto gelatinized tissue culture dishes, and the mouse embryonic fibroblasts were immortalized after a few passages using SV40 large T antigen, expressed by a retroviral vector. The genotypes of the cells were determined by polymerase chain reaction. All transfections were performed using FuGENE 6, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Cell Lysis and Immunoblotting—Cells were stimulated with 1 × 104 units/ml of the indicated IFNs for the indicated times, then lysed in phosphorylation lysis buffer as previously described (49Yetter A. Uddin S. Krolewski J.J. Jiao H. Yi T. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18179-18182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting, using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) method, were performed as previously described (49Yetter A. Uddin S. Krolewski J.J. Jiao H. Yi T. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18179-18182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In the experiments in which pharmacological inhibitors of FRAP/mTOR or the PI 3′-kinase were used, the cells were pretreated for 60 min with the indicated concentrations of the inhibitors and subsequently treated for the indicated times with IFNs, prior to lysis in phosphorylation lysis buffer. In some of the experiments to determine the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, cell extracts were obtained by three freeze-thaw cycles, as previously described (46Gingras A.-C. Kennedy S.G. O'Leary M.A. Sonenberg N. Hay N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 502-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Chromatography on m7GDP-Agarose—Chromatography of cell extracts from IFN-treated cells on m7GDP-agarose was performed essentially as previously described (46Gingras A.-C. Kennedy S.G. O'Leary M.A. Sonenberg N. Hay N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 502-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 51Miron M. Verdu J. Lachanse P.E.D. Birnbaum M.J. Lasko P.F. Sonenberg N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell extracts were obtained by four freeze-thaw cycles, in cold cap-binding buffer, containing 100 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 50 mm NaF, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein extracts were subsequently incubated for 60 min with m7GDP-agarose resin (46Gingras A.-C. Kennedy S.G. O'Leary M.A. Sonenberg N. Hay N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 502-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 51Miron M. Verdu J. Lachanse P.E.D. Birnbaum M.J. Lasko P.F. Sonenberg N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) at 4 °C. The resin was then washed with cap-binding buffer, once with 500 ml and twice with 1 ml, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and boiled. p70 S6 Kinase Assays—Assays to detect the Type I IFN-dependent activation of the p70 S6 kinase were performed as previously described (52Cichy S.B. Uddin S. Danilkovich A. Guo S. Klippel A. Unterman T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6482-6487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in phosphorylation lysis buffer, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against p70 S6 kinase or control non-immune rabbit immunoglobulin (RIgG). In vitro kinase assays were performed using a synthetic peptide substrate (AKRRRLSSLRA), and p70 S6 kinase activity was measured using an S6 kinase assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions (52Cichy S.B. Uddin S. Danilkovich A. Guo S. Klippel A. Unterman T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6482-6487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Values were calculated by subtracting nonspecific activity, detected in RIgG immunoprecipitates, from kinase activity detected in anti-p70 S6K immunoprecipitates. Isolation of Normal Peripheral Blood Granulocytes—Informed consent was obtained from healthy volunteers, according to the guidelines established by the Institutional Review Board of Northwestern University Medical School. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes were separated from peripheral venous blood using the Mono-Poly resolving medium (M-PRM, ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH), as previously described (20Mayer I.A. Verma A. Grumbach I.M. Uddin S. Lekmine F. Ravandi F. Majchrzak B. Fujita S. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28570-28577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Briefly, after centrifugation at 300 × g for 30 min at room temperature, the plasma and the mononuclear leukocyte band were discarded, and the polymorphonuclear band was transferred into an individual tube. Cells were washed with culture medium and were subsequently resuspended in culture medium, prior to interferon treatment. Mobility Shift Assays—Actively growing cells were treated with IFNα for the indicated times, in the presence or absence of rapamycin, as indicated. 10 μg of nuclear extracts, from untreated or IFNα-treated cells, was analyzed using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, as described previously (19Verma A.

A double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ATTTCCCGTAAATCCC), representing a sis-inducing element (SIE) of the c-fos promoter, was synthesized and used in the gel shift assays. A double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (CTGTTGGTTTCGTTTCCTCAGA), representing an ISRE element from the ISG-15 gene, was also synthesized and used to detect ISGF3 complexes. Luciferase Reporter Assays—Cells were transfected with a β-galactosidase expression vector and either an ISRE luciferase construct or a luciferase reporter gene containing eight GAS elements linked to a minimal prolactin promoter (8X-GAS), using the SuperFect transfection reagent as per the manufacturer's recommended procedure (Qiagen). The ISRE-luciferase construct (16Uddin S. Majchrzak B. Woodson J Arunkumar P. Alsayed Y. Pine R Young P.R. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30127-30131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) included an ISG15 ISRE (TCGGGAAAGGGAAACCGAAACTGAAGCC) cloned via cohesive ends into the BamHI site of the pZtkLuc vector and was provided by Dr. Richard Pine (Public Health Research Institute, New York, NY). The 8X-GAS construct (53Horvai A.E. Xu L. Korzus E. Brard G. Kalafus D. Mullen T.-M. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1074-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Christofer Glass (University of California San Diego, San Diego, CA). Forty-eight hours after transfection, triplicate cultures were either left untreated or treated with 5 × 103 units/ml IFNα, and luciferase activity was subsequently measured using the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). The measured luciferase activities were normalized for β-galactosidase activity for each sample. The p70 S6 Kinase Is Activated by Type I Interferons Downstream of the Phosphatidylinositol 3′-Kinase—We initially sought to determine whether the p70 S6 kinase is phosphorylated/activated during treatment of Type I IFN-sensitive cell lines with IFNα or IFNβ. Molt-4 cells were incubated for 30 min in the presence or absence of IFNα. Cells were lysed in phosphorylation lysis buffer, and total cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an antibody against the phosphorylated form of p70 S6 kinase on threonine 421 and serine 424. IFNα treatment resulted in strong phosphorylation of the p70 S6 kinase, whereas there was no change in the amounts of p70 S6 kinase protein detected after IFNα stimulation (Fig. 1, A and B). Similarly, phosphorylation of p70 S6K was detectable when another Type I IFN, IFNβ, was used (Fig. 1, C and D). In experiments, in which the phosphorylation of the p70 S6 kinase by Type I IFNs was determined, we found that both IFNα (Fig. 2, A and B), as well as IFNβ (Fig. 2, C and D) are capable of inducing phosphorylation of the protein when used at doses as low as 100 IU/ml, further emphasizing the specificity of the process. Furthermore, the Type I interferon-dependent phosphorylation of the p70 S6 kinase was inducible in various cell types, including U2OS osteosarcoma cells (Fig. 3, A and B) or U-266 multiple myeloma cells (Figs. 2A, 2B, 3C, and 3D).Fig. 2Interferon-dependent phosphorylation of the p70 S6 kinase. A, U266 cells were treated with the indicated doses of IFNα for 30 min, as indicated. Equal amounts of total cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an antibody against the phosphorylated/activated form of the p70 S6-kinase. B, the blot shown in A was stripped and re-probed with an anti-p70 S6K antibody, to control for protein loading. C, Molt-4 cells were treated with the indicated doses of IFNβ for 60 min, as indicated. Equal amounts of total cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and"

In mammalian epithelial cells, it localizes to tight junctions, the most apical end of epithelial cell-cell junctions, and contributes to the formation of functional tight junctions. However, the mechanism by which PAR-3 localizes to tight junctions and contributes to their formation remains to be clarified. Here we show that the N-terminal conserved region, CR1-(1–86), and the sequence 937–1,024 are required for its recruitment to the most apical side of the cell-cell contact region in epithelial Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. We also show that CR1 self-associates to form an oligomeric complex in vivo and in vitro. Further, overexpression of CR1 in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells disturbs the distribution of atypical protein kinase C and PAR-6 as well as PAR-3 and delays the formation of functional tight junctions. These results support the notion that the CR1-mediated self-association of the PAR-3-containing protein complex plays a role during the formation of functional tight junctions.

These results support the notion that the CR1-mediated self-association of the PAR-3-containing protein complex plays a role during the formation of functional tight junctions. Cell polarity plays essential roles not only in cell functions but also in development and tissue maintenance. Recent studies have revealed that PAR-3, PAR-6, and their binding partner, atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), 1The abbreviations used are: aPKC, atypical protein kinase C; TJ, tight junctions; AJ, adherence junctions; JAM, junctional adhesion molecule; TER, transepithelial electrical resistance; PDZ, PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; MBS, m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester; BS3, bis-(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate; sPAR-3, short PAR-3. cooperate together to establish cell polarity in a variety of biological contexts (1Ohno S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). PAR-3 and PAR-6 are products of the par (partitioning-defective) genes required to establish anterior/posterior cell polarity of the Caenorhabditis elegans zygote. In the C. elegans one-cell embryo, PAR-3, PAR-6, and aPKC (PKC-3) become localized asymmetrically to the anterior periphery in a cell cycle-dependent manner. In Drosophila embryos and mammalian epithelial cells, PAR-3, aPKC, and PAR-6 are also required to establish cell polarity (1Ohno S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). PAR-3 is an evolutionarily conserved scaffold-like protein. PAR-3, Bazooka (Drosophila), and mammalian PAR-3 share three conserved regions (CR), CR1, CR2, and CR3 (Fig. 1A). CR3 is involved aPKC-binding sequences (2Izumi Y. Hirose T. Tamai Y. Hirai S.

Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 1161-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The deletion of a part of CR3 or a point mutation at one of the conserved Ser in CR3 causes defects in binding to aPKC (3Nagai-Tamai Y. Mizuno K. Hirose T. Suzuki A. Ohno S. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 1161-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 4Lin D. Edwards A.S. Fawcett J.P. Mbamalu G. Scott J.D. Pawson T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). CR2 contains three PDZ domains, which are protein-interacting modules initially recognized as a repeat of 80 amino acids in PSD-95, Drosophila Dlg-A, and ZO-1 (5Bilder D. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 511-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 6Harris B.Z. Lim W.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting their contribution to protein-protein interactions. In fact, in addition to PAR-6, the C terminus of type B ephrin (7Lin D. Gish G.D. Songyang Z. Pawson T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3726-3733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and the junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) (8Ebnet K. Suzuki A.

Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1351-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar) have been reported to bind to the PDZ domains of PAR-3. In addition to CR2 and CR3, PAR-3 contains a unique amino-terminal domain, whose amino acid sequences (PAR-3, 69–152 aa; Bazooka, 1–81 aa; mammalian PAR-3, 1–83 aa) are 37, 52, and 45% identical to one another and show no homology to any other proteins (2Izumi Y.

Although the conservation of the CR1 domain implies its importance, its function remains to be clarified. The function of mammalian PAR-aPKC is well characterized in epithelial cells, which have apico-basal polarity and an asymmetric junctional complex including adherence junctions (AJ) and tight junctions (TJ) that cap the most apical end of cells. In polarized epithelial cells, aPKC forms a ternary complex with PAR-3 and PAR-6, which co-localize at TJ (2Izumi Y. Hirose T. Tamai Y. Hirai S. Nagashima Y. Fujimoto T. Tabuse Y. Kemphues K.J.

Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1183-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Studies using cultured epithelial cells, such as MDCK cells, have revealed the importance of cell-cell junctions for the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity (11Eaton S. Simons K. Cell. 1995; 82: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 12Drubin D.G. Nelson W.J.

Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2930) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism underlying the biogenesis of epithelial-specific junctional structures has been analyzed by observations of wound healing processes or calcium-dependent reorganization of cell-cell adhesion of epithelial cells (calcium switch). At the initial stage of cell-cell contact of epithelial cells, primordial spot-like junctions are formed at the tips of thin cellular protrusions radiating from adjacent cells where E-cadherin and ZO-1 are concentrated (14Yonemura S. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 127-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). JAM, a transmembrane protein identified in TJ, co-localizes with E-cadherin at the tips of primordial spotlike junctions (8Ebnet K. Suzuki A. Horikoshi Y. Hirose T. Meyer Zu Brickwedde M.K. Ohno S. Vestweber D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3738-3748Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Then, as cellular polarization proceeds, E-cadherin and ZO-1 are completely sorted into epithelial-specific beltlike AJ and TJ, respectively. Occludin and then PAR-3 and aPKC accumulate gradually at the ZO-1-positive spotlike junctions during this process (15Suzuki A. Ishiyama C. Hashiba K. Shimizu M. Ebnet K. Ohno S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3565-3573Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Overexpression of a dominant negative form of aPKCλ (aPKCλkn) in MDCK cells results in mislocalization of PAR-3 and ZO-1 and a decline in transepithelial electrical resistance (TER), indicating that the formation of functional TJ is impaired under these conditions (10Suzuki A. Yamanaka T. Hirose T. Manabe N. Mizuno K. Shimizu M. Akimoto K. Izumi Y. Ohnishi T. Ohno S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1183-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the process of wound healing, the expression of aPKCλkn in MTD1-A epithelial cells does not inhibit the formation of primordial spotlike AJ, but it blocks the development into beltlike AJ and the formation of TJ (15Suzuki A. Ishiyama C. Hashiba K. Shimizu M. Ebnet K. Ohno S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3565-3573Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). These results clearly indicate that the kinase activity of aPKC is required for the maturation of TJ from primordial AJ. In addition, the kinase activity of aPKC is regulated by PAR-6; association of PAR-6 with aPKC suppresses its kinase activity, but this suppression is overcome by the binding of activated GTP-bound Cdc42 to PAR-6 (4Lin D.

The overexpression of a PAR-6 mutant lacking the aPKC-binding domain also disrupts the formation of functional TJ in MDCK (16Yamanaka T. Horikoshi Y. Suzuki A. Sugiyama Y. Kitamura K. Maniwa R.

Furthermore, overexpression of PAR-3, but not PAR-3 lacking the aPKC-binding domain, promotes TJ assembly (21Hirose T. Izumi Y. Nagashima Y. Tamai-Nagai Y. Kurihara H. Sakai T. Suzuki Y. Yamanaka T. Suzuki A. Mizuno K. Ohno S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2485-2495PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that in mammalian epithelial cells, the PAR-aPKC complex, which is recruited into the cell-cell contact region during the initial phase of cell polarization, contributes to the asymmetric development of initial cell-cell contacts to mature junctional complexes. However, the precise mechanisms by which PAR-3 and the PAR-aPKC complex localize to the cell-cell contact region during the maturation of epithelial junctional structures remains to be clarified. In this study, we show the self-association of PAR-3 mediated by CR1. We also show that CR1 is required for the correct recruitment of not only PAR-3 but also aPKC and PAR-6 to the cell-cell contact region in MDCK cells. Further, the ectopic CR1 fragment delays the development of functional TJ. These results suggest that the CR1-mediated self-association of PAR-3 plays a role during the development of epithelial junctional complexes and cell polarity.

Mouse anti-aPKCι and E-cadherin monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Mouse anti-Myc and T7 monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Calbiochem and Novagen, respectively. Rabbit anti-PAR-3 and PAR-6 antibodies were raised against glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of the N-terminal domain of PAR-3 (N2; amino acid residues 1–115), the PAR-3-specific C-terminal domain (A2; amino acid residues 1124–1137), and a synthetic peptide against the C terminus of human PAR-6β (BC32; amino acid residues 359–372). Alexa488-conjugated secondary antibodies and rhodamine-phalloidin were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR), and Cy3- and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL Western blotting detection reagents were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Cell Cultures and Transfections—COS1 cells, Caco-2 cells, and MDCK II cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences), penicillin, and streptomycin (Invitrogen). For immunoprecipitation, COS1 cells were transfected by an electroporation method using 16 μg of expression plasmids for 6 × 106 cells as previously described (22Osada S. Mizuno K. Saido T.C. Suzuki K. Kuroki T. Ohno S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3930-3938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and maintained in growth medium for 48 h. For immunofluorescence, Caco-2 cells and MDCK cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE PLAS reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression Plasmids—To obtain cDNA clone(s) encoding mouse PAR-3, we screened a mouse liver cDNA library (Clontech) using the entire coding region of rat PAR-3 (2Izumi Y. Hirose T. Tamai Y. Hirai S. Nagashima Y. Fujimoto T. Tabuse Y. Kemphues K.J. Ohno S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) as a probe. We identified cDNA clones encoding PAR-3 splice variants. T7-PAR-3 constructed with SRHis vector was previously described (2Izumi Y. Hirose T. Tamai Y. Hirai S. Nagashima Y. Fujimoto T. Tabuse Y.

Kemphues K.J. Ohno S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) was inserted into the XbaI restriction site of pEF-BOS to express PAR-3 without the tag sequence. Another rat PAR-3 clone coding the sequence corresponding to amino acids 93–1,337, mouse PAR-3 short type splicing isoform (1,034 amino acids) lacking amino acids 741–743 and 827–856, a DNA fragment corresponding to amino acids 258–708 of rat PAR-3 amplified by PCR, and the NaeI-NcoI fragment of mouse PAR-3 encoding amino acids 1–86 were inserted into the PvuII restriction site of SRHis vectors to generate T7-tagged PAR-3 expression vectors, T7-PAR-3 Δ1/92, T7-sPAR-3, T7-PAR-3-(258–708), and T7-PAR-3-(1–86), respectively. T7-sPAR-3 Δ1/92 was constructed by changing the BglII fragment of T7-PAR-3 Δ1/92 including the deletion site to that of T7-sPAR-3. For the preparation of PAR-3-(1–115)-Myc, a DNA fragment corresponding to amino acids 1–115 of rat PAR-3 was amplified by PCR and cloned into the XbaI restriction site of pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). pTER-T7-PAR-3-(1–86) was constructed with a NaeI-NcoI fragment of mouse PAR-3 and pTER plasmid (Clontech). Immunoprecipitation—Transfected COS1 cells and MDCK Tet-Off cell lines grown in 10-cm dishes were suspended in 800 μl of lysis buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml of leupeptin, 1 μg/ml of aprotinin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Nonidet P-40. After a 30-min incubation on ice, the lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min and incubated with antibodies preabsorbed on Protein G- or Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for2hat4 °C. After washing five times with lysis buffer, the immunoprecipitants were eluted with Laemmli's SDS-sample buffer. Electrophoresis and Western blot analysis were performed as previously described (10Suzuki A. Yamanaka T. Hirose T. Manabe N. Mizuno K. Shimizu M. Akimoto K. Izumi Y. Ohnishi T. Ohno S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1183-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—Yeast expression vectors for PAR-3-(1–115) were constructed in pAS2–1C (29Ohtoshi A. Maeda T. Higashi H. Ashizawa S. Hatakeyama M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 530-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) or pGAD424 (Clontech) and were simultaneously transformed into the yeast strain Y190 (MATa ura3–52 his3–200 ade2–101 lys2–801 trp1–901 leu2–3,112 gal4· gal80·· cyhr2 LYS2::GAL1 UAS -HIS3 TATA -HIS3 URA3::GAL1 UAS GAL1 TATA -LacZ; Clontech) as previously described (10Suzuki A. Yamanaka T. Hirose T. Manabe N. Mizuno K. Shimizu M. Akimoto K. Izumi Y. Ohnishi T. Ohno S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1183-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The transformants were restreaked onto synthetic plates lacking uracil, leucine, tryptophan, and histidine in the presence or absence of 30 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. After 5 days at 30 °C, the interaction between each pair of bait- /prey proteins was assayed by the growth on the plate in the presence of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole and by a filter assay for β-galactosidase activity (data not shown). The pair of pVA3 and pTD1 encode DNA-binding domain/murine p53, and activation domain/SV40 large T-antigen fusion proteins (Clontech) were used as positive control. Chemical Cross-link—To obtain recombinant PAR-3-(1–115), a DNA fragment corresponding to amino acids 1–115 of rat PAR-3 was amplified by PCR, inserted into pGEX-6P plasmid (Amersham Biosciences), and expressed as a GST fusion protein. After purification by affinity chromatography on a glutathione-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences), the fusion protein was cleaved with PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified proteins (6.6 μg/100 μl) were dialyzed against phosphate buffer (10 mm phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) and incubated with increasing concentrations of MBS and BS3 at room temperature for 20 min. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 μl of ethanolamine and SDS-sample buffer. The cross-linked species were identified by Western blotting with the anti-N-segment of PAR-3 antibody, N2. Cross-linking of T7-PAR-3-(1–86) in cell extracts was performed as follows. The MDCK Tet-Off cell line expressing T7-PAR-3-(1–86) (Clone 5) and parental cell lines were cultured in the absence of doxycycline for 3 days to induce sufficient amounts of T7-PAR-3-(1–86). Cells (10-cm dish) were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v)) on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min. Aliquots (100 μl) of extracts were incubated with the indicated concentrations of MBS and bis-maleimidohexane at 25 °C for 5 min. Immunofluorescence Labeling and Microscopy—Transfected Caco-2 cells, MDCK cells, and MDCK Tet-Off cell lines were plated on glass coverslips in 24-well plates or on 12-mm diameter Transwell filters with a pore size of 0.4 μm (Corning Coaster Corp.). Immunofluorescence labeling was performed as previously described (10Suzuki A. Yamanaka T. Hirose T. Manabe N. Mizuno K. Shimizu M. Akimoto K. Izumi Y. Ohnishi T. Ohno S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1183-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), and the results were observed under a fluorescence microscope (BX60; Olympus) and IP Lab (Photometrics) or analyzed by laser-scanning microscopy (μRadiance; Bio-Rad). Generation of MDCK Cell Lines Expressing T7-CR1—MDCK Tet-Off cell lines expressing T7-PAR-3-(1–86) were produced as described (16Yamanaka T. Horikoshi Y. Suzuki A. Sugiyama Y. Kitamura K. Maniwa R. Nagai Y. Yamashita A. Hirose T. Ishikawa H. Ohno S. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 721-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) using a Tet-Off gene expression system and MDCK Tet-Off cell lines (Clontech). The expression of T7-PAR-3-(1–86) was induced by decreasing the concentration of the tetracycline analogue doxycycline (Sigma) in the culture medium. Calcium switch and measurement of TER were performed as previously described (10Suzuki A. Yamanaka T. Hirose T. Manabe N. Mizuno K. Shimizu M. Akimoto K. Izumi Y. Ohnishi T. Ohno S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1183-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Self-association of PAR-3 through the Evolutionarily Conserved N-terminal Domain, CR1—Mammalian PAR-3 has several splicing isoforms. One of the major isoforms, sPAR-3, shares its N-terminal 1,024 residues with PAR-3 and has an additional 10-residue sequence at the C terminus (Fig. 1A) (21Hirose T. Izumi Y. Nagashima Y. Tamai-Nagai Y. Kurihara H. Sakai T. Suzuki Y. Yamanaka T. Suzuki A. Mizuno K. Ohno S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2485-2495PubMed Google Scholar, 23Fang C.M. Xu Y.H. Cell Res. 2001; 11: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). When low levels of PAR-3 or sPAR-3 were expressed in Caco-2 cells, sPAR-3 as well as PAR-3 distributed to the cell-cell contact region in a manner similar to endogenous PAR-3 (data not shown). However, in cells expressing large amounts of ectopic proteins, PAR-3 distributed as punctate clusters (Fig. 1B), whereas sPAR-3 and T7-tagged sPAR-3 distributed diffusely in the cytosol (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, when T7-sPAR-3 was co-transfected with PAR-3, T7-sPAR-3 distributed as punctate clusters and co-localized with PAR-3 (Fig. 1D, data not shown). The percentage of cells, in which T7-sPAR-3 forms punctate clusters, among the cells expressing excess amounts of T7-sPAR-3 depends on the ratio of the amounts of T7-sPAR-3 cDNA versus co-transfected PAR-3 cDNA (Fig. 1E). Although the physiological significance of the differences between sPAR-3 and PAR-3 remains unknown, their co-localization suggests that sPAR-3 interacts with PAR-3 in vivo. Interestingly, the diffused cytoplasmic distribution of a deletion mutant of sPAR-3 lacking CR1 (T7-sPAR-3 Δ1/92) was not affected by co-transfection with PAR-3 (Fig. 1E). This suggests the importance of CR1 for the interaction. The importance of CR1 for the interaction between PAR-3 and sPAR-3 was confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments using COS cells expressing various tagged PAR-3 deletion mutants; sPAR-3 but not sPAR-3 Δ1/92 co-immunoprecipitated PAR-3 and vice versa (Fig. 1F, lanes 2 and 3). Fig. 1G shows that PAR-3-(1–115) is enough to co-precipitate PAR-3 or sPAR-3 but not PAR-3 Δ1/92. Furthermore, PAR-3-(1–115) co-immunoprecipitated PAR-3-(1–86), suggesting that the CR1 domain is enough for the self-association of PAR-3 (Fig. 1H). Results obtained in a yeast two-hybrid system using PAR-3-(1–115) further support the self-association of CR1, suggesting that the interaction between CR1 fragments is direct (Fig. 2A). Pull-down experiments using purified CR1, GST-CR1, and MBP-CR1 failed to give reproducible results supporting a direct interaction, presumably because of weak or unstable interactions under the in vitro conditions. However, the recombinant PAR-3-(1–115) fragment was readily cross-linked in vitro by MBS and BS3 to form a slower migrating species with twice the molecular size of the uncross-linked species (Fig. 2B). In addition, higher molecular weight bands could be detected with high concentrations of chemical cross-linkers, where high concentrations of bovine serum albumin failed to be cross-linked to form even dimers (data not shown). The oligomerization of CR1 fragments occurs in lysates of MDCK cells overexpressing T7-PAR-3-(1–86) (Fig. 2C). The cross-linked T7-PAR-3-(1–86) migrates mainly as dimers in addition to trimers and tetramers. These results indicate that PAR-3 CR1 (1–86 aa) can self-associate directly in vivo. CR1 and Amino Acids 937–1,024 Are Involved in the Localization of PAR-3 at the Most Apical Side of the Cell-Cell Contact Region—PAR-3 localizes at TJ in epithelial tissues (2Izumi Y. Hirose T. Tamai Y. Hirai S. Nagashima Y. Fujimoto T. Tabuse Y. Kemphues K.J. Ohno S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 21Hirose T. Izumi Y. Nagashima Y. Tamai-Nagai Y. Kurihara H. Sakai T. Suzuki Y. Yamanaka T. Suzuki A. Mizuno K. Ohno S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2485-2495PubMed Google Scholar). In polarized MDCK cells, PAR-3 localizes at the apical side of the cell-cell contact region. To assess the role of CR1 in the cellular localization of PAR-3, we examined the distribution of T7-tagged PAR-3 in polarized MDCK cells (Fig. 3A). To avoid the artificial effect of overflowing ectopic proteins, we observed cells expressing the lowest level of T7-tagged proteins. As shown in Fig. 3, B and C, sPAR-3, like PAR-3, concentrates on the apical side of the cell-cell contact region with ZO-1, a component of TJ. In contrast, PAR-3-(1–936) lacking the C-terminal domain showed a diffused distribution in the cytosol in addition to weak staining throughout the cell surface (Fig. 3D), suggesting that residues 937–1,024 are required for the localization of PAR-3/sPAR-3 on the most apical side of the cell-cell contact region. However, residues 937–1,034 are not sufficient for the correct localization of PAR-3/sPAR-3 on the apical side of the cell-cell contact region, since GST-PAR-3-(937–1,034) distributes throughout the whole plasma membrane (data not shown). The first PDZ domain (residues 270–359) of PAR-3 binds to the C-terminal sequence of JAM, a membrane protein at TJ, and this binding is required for recruiting PAR-3 to the cell-cell contact region during cell polarization (8Ebnet K. Suzuki A. Horikoshi Y. Hirose T. Meyer Zu Brickwedde M.K. Ohno S. Vestweber D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3738-3748Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 9Itoh M. Furuse M. Morita K. Kubota K. Saitou M. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1351-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). However, PAR-3 Δ267/709, which lacks the PDZ domain, distributes to the most apical part of the cell-cell contact region, as in the case of the wild type (Fig. 3G), suggesting that the anchoring of the first domain of PAR-3 to JAM is not required for the recruitment of ectopic PAR-3 to mature TJ. Considering that PAR-3-(258–708) does not concentrate at the cell-cell contact region (Fig. 4B), PAR-3-JAM interaction is not sufficient for the stable localization of PAR-3 to TJ. Furthermore, the binding to aPKC is not required for localization, since deletion of the aPKC-binding domain, 709–928, does not affect the localization (Fig. 3H). On the other hand, PAR-3 Δ1/92 and sPAR-3 Δ1/92 showed diffuse distributions in the cytosol and on the cell surface (Fig. 3, E and F). Taken together with the fact that PAR-3-(1–86) did not concentrate on the apical side of the cell-cell contact region (Fig. 4A), these results suggest that the CR1 domain is not sufficient but is indispensable for the stable localization of PAR-3/sPAR-3 at TJ. Similar results were obtained when a series of T7-PAR-3 proteins were expressed in mouse epithelial MTD1-A cells (data not shown).Fig. 4Distribution of endogenous PAR-3, aPKCλ, PAR-6, and ZO-1 in T7-PAR-3-(1–86)-expressing cells. MDCK cells were transiently transfected with T7-PAR-3-(1–86) (A and C) or T7-PAR-3-(258–708) (B) and maintained for 43 h to form confluent monolayers. Cells were fixed, double-stained with antibodies for T7 tag (green) and endogenous proteins (red; for PAR-3, C2; for aPKCλ, λ1; for PAR-6, GW2AP) and analyzed under a confocal microscope. Weak staining of PAR-3, aPKCλ, and PAR-6 is seen in T7-PAR-3-(1–86)-expressing cells (A). The data shown are representative of 3–5 data experiments.

https://openalex.org/W2140403673,"Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) regulates growth plate chondrogenesis during development and postnatal bone growth, but the control mechanisms of BMP-2 expression in growth plate chondrocytes are unknown. Here we have used both in vitro and in vivo approaches to demonstrate that transcription factor, NF-κB, regulates BMP-2 gene expression in chondrocytes. Two putative NF-κB response elements were found in the –2712/+165 region of the BMP-2 gene. Cotransfection of mutant I-κBα expression plasmids with BMP-2 promoter-luciferase reporters into TMC-23 chondrocyte cell line suppressed BMP-2 transcription. Mutations in NF-κB response elements in the BMP-2 gene lead to decreases in BMP-2 promoter activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay using nuclear extracts from TMC-23 chondrocytic cells revealed that the NF-κB subunits p50 and p65 bound to the NF-κB response elements of the BMP-2 gene. Thus, NF-κB may positively regulate BMP-2 gene transcription. Consistent with these findings, expression of BMP-2 mRNA was significantly reduced in growth plate chondrocytes in NF-κB p50/p52 dKO mice, which associated with decreased numbers of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd)-positive cells in the proliferating zone of growth plate in these mice. Therefore, in postnatal growth plate chondrocytes, expression of BMP-2 is regulated by NF-κB, which may play an important role in chondrogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2165097339,"Noninvasive imaging of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the human brain in vivo is critical for elucidating the role of these receptors in normal brain function and in the pathogenesis of brain disorders. Here we report the first in vivo visualization of human brain areas containing nAChRs by using PET and 2-[18F]fluoro-3-(2(S)azetidinylmethoxy)pyridine (2-[18F]FA). We acquired scans from six healthy non-smoking volunteers after i.v. bolus administration of 2-[18F]FA (1.6 MBq/kg or 0.043 +/- 0.002 mCi/kg). This dose was sufficient for visualizing nAChRs in the thalamus up to 5 h after injection. There were no adverse effects associated with administration of no-carrier-added 2-[18F]FA (1.3-10 pmol/kg). Consistent with the distribution of nAChRs in human brain, accumulated radioactivity was greatest in thalamus, intermediate in the midbrain, pons, cerebellum, and cortex; and least in white matter. As approximately 90% of the injected radioactivity was eliminated via the urine (biological half-life ca. 4 h), the urinary bladder wall received the highest radiation dose. The estimate of radiation dose equivalent to the urinary bladder wall (ca. 180 +/- 30 mSv/MBq or 0.7 rem/mCi with a 2.4 h void interval) suggests that multiple studies could be performed in a single subject. The results predict that quantitative PET imaging of nAChRs in human brain with 2-[18F]FA is feasible."

https://openalex.org/W2127825615,"Extracellular ATP and other purines play a crucial role in the vasculature, and their turnover is selectively governed by a network of ectoenzymes expressed both on endothelial and hematopoietic cells. By studying the whole pattern of purine metabolism in human serum, we revealed the existence of soluble enzymes capable of both inactivating and transphosphorylating circulating purines. Evidence for this was obtained by using independent assays, including chromatographic analyses with 3H-labeled and unlabeled nucleotides and adenosine, direct transfer of gamma-terminal phosphate from [gamma-32P]ATP to NDP/AMP, and bioluminescent measurement of ATP metabolism. Based on substrate-specificity and competitive studies, we identified three purine-inactivating enzymes in human serum, nucleotide pyrophosphatase (EC 3.6.1.9), 5'-nucleotidase (EC 3.1.3.5), and adenosine deaminase (EC 3.5.4.4), whereas an opposite ATP-generating pathway is represented by adenylate kinase (EC 2.7.4.3) and NDP kinase (EC 2.7.4.6). Comparative kinetic analysis revealed that the Vmax values for soluble nucleotide kinases significantly exceed those of counteracting nucleotidases, whereas the apparent Km values for serum enzymes were fairly comparable and varied within a range of 40-70 micro mol/l. Identification of soluble enzymes contributing, along with membrane-bound ectoenzymes, to the active cycling between circulating ATP and other purines provides a novel insight into the regulatory mechanisms of purine homeostasis in the blood."
https://openalex.org/W2015805914,"The expression of genes required for the synthesis of molybdenum nitrogenase in Azotobacter vinelandii is controlled by the NifL-NifA transcriptional regulatory complex in response to nitrogen, carbon, and redox status. Activation of nif gene expression by the transcriptional activator NifA is inhibited by direct protein-protein interaction with NifL under conditions unfavorable for nitrogen fixation. We have recently shown that the NifL-NifA system responds directly to physiological concentrations of 2-oxoglutarate, resulting in relief of NifA activity from inhibition by NifL under conditions when fixed nitrogen is limiting. The inhibitory activity of NifL is restored under conditions of excess combined nitrogen through the binding of the signal transduction protein Av GlnK to the carboxyl-terminal domain of NifL. The amino-terminal domain of NifA comprises a GAF domain implicated in the regulatory response to NifL. A truncated form of NifA lacking this domain is not responsive to 2-oxoglutarate in the presence of NifL, suggesting that the GAF domain is required for the response to this ligand. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we demonstrate stoichiometric binding of 2-oxoglutarate to both the isolated GAF domain and the full-length A. vinelandii NifA protein with a dissociation constant of ∼60 μm. Limited proteolysis experiments indicate that the binding of 2-oxoglutarate increases the susceptibility of the GAF domain to trypsin digestion and also prevents NifL from protecting these cleavage sites. However, protection by NifL is restored when the non-modified (non-uridylylated) form of Av GlnK is also present. Our results suggest that the binding of 2-oxoglutarate to the GAF domain of NifA may induce a conformational change that prevents inhibition by NifL under conditions when fixed nitrogen is limiting. The expression of genes required for the synthesis of molybdenum nitrogenase in Azotobacter vinelandii is controlled by the NifL-NifA transcriptional regulatory complex in response to nitrogen, carbon, and redox status. Activation of nif gene expression by the transcriptional activator NifA is inhibited by direct protein-protein interaction with NifL under conditions unfavorable for nitrogen fixation. We have recently shown that the NifL-NifA system responds directly to physiological concentrations of 2-oxoglutarate, resulting in relief of NifA activity from inhibition by NifL under conditions when fixed nitrogen is limiting. The inhibitory activity of NifL is restored under conditions of excess combined nitrogen through the binding of the signal transduction protein Av GlnK to the carboxyl-terminal domain of NifL. The amino-terminal domain of NifA comprises a GAF domain implicated in the regulatory response to NifL. A truncated form of NifA lacking this domain is not responsive to 2-oxoglutarate in the presence of NifL, suggesting that the GAF domain is required for the response to this ligand. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we demonstrate stoichiometric binding of 2-oxoglutarate to both the isolated GAF domain and the full-length A. vinelandii NifA protein with a dissociation constant of ∼60 μm. Limited proteolysis experiments indicate that the binding of 2-oxoglutarate increases the susceptibility of the GAF domain to trypsin digestion and also prevents NifL from protecting these cleavage sites. However, protection by NifL is restored when the non-modified (non-uridylylated) form of Av GlnK is also present. Our results suggest that the binding of 2-oxoglutarate to the GAF domain of NifA may induce a conformational change that prevents inhibition by NifL under conditions when fixed nitrogen is limiting.

The NifL regulatory protein integrates the response to these environmental inputs to regulate the activity of its partner protein, the σ54-dependent transcriptional activator NifA, through protein-protein interactions (1Dixon R. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 169: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). NifL is a flavoprotein containing FAD as prosthetic group within an amino-terminal PAS domain and is competent to antagonize NifA activity when the flavin moiety is oxidized, irrespective of the nitrogen status (2Schmitz R.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 157: 313-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Hill S. Austin S. Eydmann T. Jones T. Dixon R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2143-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The carboxyl terminus of A. vinelandii NifL bears significant homology to the GHKL superfamily of ATPases and histidine protein kinases (4Dutta R. Inouye M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 24-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Although nucleotide hydrolysis or phosphotransfer has not been observed, binding of adenosine nucleotides to the GHKL domain plays a key role in transducing environmental signals by enhancing the inhibitory activity of NifL and stabilizing protein-protein interactions between NifL and NifA (5Eydmann T. Söderbäck E. Jones T. Hill S. Austin S. Dixon R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1186-1195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Money T. Jones T. Dixon R. Austin S. J.

Microbiol. 1998; 28: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). NifA activity is inhibited by NifL via a concerted mechanism in which catalytic activity, DNA binding, and potentially interaction with RNA polymerase are controlled (8Barrett J. Ray P. Sobczyk A. Little R. Dixon R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 480-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). NifA is a multidomain protein consisting of a carboxyl-terminal DNA-binding domain, a central catalytic (AAA+) domain required to couple nucleotide hydrolysis to activation of the σ54-RNA polymerase holoenzyme, and an amino-terminal domain of unknown function (9Buck M. Gallegos M.T. Studholme D.J. Guo Y. Gralla J.D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4129-4136Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 10Morett E. Segovia L. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6067-6074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amino terminus of NifA comprises a GAF domain, a ubiquitous signaling motif found in signaling and sensory proteins from all three kingdoms of life (11Aravind L. Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 458-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 12Ho Y.S. Burden L.M. Hurley J.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5288-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). GAF and PAS domains share strong structural similarities, suggesting an evolutionary relationship, and in common with the PAS domain family, GAF domains are able to bind small molecule co-factors such as 3′,5′ cyclic guanosine monophosphate and formate (13Anantharaman V. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1271-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 14Hopper S. Böck A. J.

This raises the possibility that the binding of a co-effector to NifA may be an integral part of nif gene regulation. We have recently demonstrated that the NifL-NifA system responds in vitro to the small metabolite 2-oxoglutarate, which counteracts the inhibitory function of NifL that is activated by the binding of adenosine nucleotides (16Little R. Reyes-Ramirez F. Zhang Y. van Heeswijk W.C. Dixon R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6041-6050Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The response to 2-oxoglutarate in vitro is within the physiological range observed in Escherichia coli, which varies from ∼100 μm under conditions of nitrogen excess to ∼1 mm under conditions of nitrogen limitation (17Senior P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 123: 407-418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When expressed in E. coli, the A. vinelandii NifL-NifA system is also apparently responsive to the 2-oxoglutarate concentration in vivo (18Reyes-Ramirez F. Little R. Dixon R. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3076-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). 2-Oxoglutarate is an intermediate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and provides the carbon skeleton for nitrogen assimilation; hence 2-oxoglutarate signals the carbon status (19Ninfa A.J. Jiang P. Atkinson M.R. Peliska J.A. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 2000; 36: 31-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This metabolite is also an allosteric effector of the PII-like signal transduction proteins, which mediate nitrogen metabolism and regulation, dependent upon their uridylylation status (19Ninfa A.J. Jiang P. Atkinson M.R. Peliska J.A. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 2000; 36: 31-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 20Arcondáguy T. Jack R. Merrick M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 80-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Under nitrogen excess conditions, the A. vinelandii PII protein (Av GlnK) is primarily in its unmodified form and interacts with the carboxyl-terminal kinase-like domain of NifL to promote inhibition of NifA (21Little R. Colombo V. Leech A. Dixon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15472-15481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 22Rudnick P. Kunz C. Gunatilaka M.K. Hines E.R. Kennedy C. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 812-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, this interaction is relatively insensitive to the concentration of 2-oxoglutarate, unlike the interactions between enteric PII proteins with their receptors (23Jiang P. Peliska J.A. Ninfa A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12802-12810Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 24Jiang P. Ninfa A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1906-1911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the interaction between Av GlnK and NifL overrides the effect of 2-oxoglutarate in relieving inhibition of NifA activity, and hence NifL is restored to its inhibitory form (16Little R. Reyes-Ramirez F. Zhang Y. van Heeswijk W.C. Dixon R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6041-6050Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Under conditions of fixed nitrogen limitation, Av GlnK is uridylylated, and the fully modified form of the protein, GlnK-UMP, is not competent to interact with NifL, allowing the NifL-NifA system to respond to 2-oxoglutarate (16Little R. Reyes-Ramirez F. Zhang Y. van Heeswijk W.C. Dixon R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6041-6050Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 21Little R. Colombo V. Leech A. Dixon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15472-15481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We therefore propose that the activity of the nitrogen fixation-specific regulatory proteins is responsive to 2-oxoglutarate under nitrogen-limiting conditions (16Little R. Reyes-Ramirez F. Zhang Y. van Heeswijk W.C. Dixon R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6041-6050Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In this report we have used purified components to investigate the interaction of 2-oxoglutarate with NifA and/or NifL. We observe specific interaction of 2-oxoglutarate with the NifA protein, and we demonstrate that this binding is a property of the isolated GAF domain of NifA. We further demonstrate that a truncated form of NifA, NifA-(191–522), lacking the GAF domain, is unable to bind 2-oxoglutarate, and although this truncated protein is inhibited by NifL, it is not responsive to 2-oxoglutarate. Furthermore, we show that the presence of 2-oxoglutarate alters the protease sensitivity of the GAF domain of NifA, suggesting that binding of this ligand may bring about a conformational change in the protein, enabling it to resist inhibition by NifL. Plasmids for Overexpression—Plasmids pTJ40, pTJ54, pDB737, and pAS1, used for overexpression of NifLHis6, NifL-(147–519)His6, NifA, and NifA-(191–522), respectively, have been described previously (7Söderbäck E. Reyes-Ramirez F. Eydmann T. Austin S. Hill S. Dixon R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 8Barrett J. Ray P. Sobczyk A. Little R. Dixon R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 480-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Plasmid pTM17 expressing the GAF domain of A. vinelandii NifA with a carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine tag (Av NifA-(1–203)His6) was prepared using primers “nifa-3” (5′-ATGTTCTCGAAGCCGTACTCGAGGCGCACCTCGCG-3′) and “05-97” (5′-GGGAATGCATATGAATGCAACCATCC-3′) to amplify a fragment containing residues 1–203 with plasmid pDB737 as a template; this resulted in the introduction of a new XhoI site downstream of the coding sequence for residue 203. Following NdeI/XhoI digestion, this fragment was cloned into pET23(b) vector (Novagen). Plasmid pRL08, which expresses the 180 amino-terminal residues of A. vinelandii NifA with an amino-terminal hexahistidine tag, Av NifAHis6-(1–180), was prepared by amplification with primers “Av GAFFor” (5′-GCAGCGGCCTGGTGCCGCGCGGCAGCC-3′) and “Av180 Rev” (5′-CGATGGATCCTTACAGGCGCACGGTCTGCGCCAGCAGG-3′) using pMB737, which expresses NifA in pET28b(+), as a template. After digestion with NdeI and BamHI, the fragment was cloned into pET15b. Plasmid pRL09, which expresses the first 178 residues of Klebsiella pneumoniae NifA with an amino-terminal hexahistidine tag, Kp NifAHis6-(1–178), was prepared by amplification and cloning into pET15b as described for pRL08, using primers “Kp180For” (5′-GGCATTCCTCATATGATCCATAAATCCGATTCGGACACCACCG-3′) and “Kp180Rev” (5′-CAACCGGATCCTTACAGGCGAATCGTCTGGGCGATCAG-3′). Nucleotide sequences of the PCR-generated DNA were found to be identical to those in sequence data bases. Protein Purification—In all cases protein overexpression was achieved in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Novagen). Cultures were grown aerobically in Luria-Bertani medium, and expression from the T7 promoter was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thioglactopyranoside to 1 mm. A. vinelandii NifA, NifA-(191–522), Av GlnK, K. pneumoniae σ54, and IHF were purified as described previously (8Barrett J. Ray P. Sobczyk A. Little R. Dixon R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 480-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 16Little R. Reyes-Ramirez F. Zhang Y. van Heeswijk W.C. Dixon R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6041-6050Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). NifL-(147–519)His6, Av NifA-(1–203)His6, Av NifAHis6-(1–180), and Kp NifAHis6-(1–178) were purified by metal chelate affinity chromatography. Two 1-ml HiTrap chelating HP columns (Amersham Biosciences) were connected in series and equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm potassium phosphate, 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). Purification was carried out using Biocad Sprint perfusion chromatography (PE Biosystems). Following immobilization of the target proteins, the columns were further washed with buffer A containing 10% glycerol. Protein was eluted using a linear gradient from 0 to 500 mm imidazole over a 30-ml elution volume. Open Complex Assays—NifA-promoted catalysis of open promoter complex formation by σ54-RNA polymerase was used to assay NifA activity and its inhibition by NifL as described previously (16Little R. Reyes-Ramirez F. Zhang Y. van Heeswijk W.C. Dixon R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6041-6050Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 21Little R. Colombo V. Leech A. Dixon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15472-15481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Linearized template DNA was provided by digesting plasmid pNH8 with EcoRI and BamHI to yield a 260-bp fragment, which contained the K. pneumoniae nifH promoter and upstream activator sequences and was 3′-end-labeled with [α-32P]dGTP at the BamHI site. Reactions (final volume of 15 μl) were carried out in TAP buffer (50 mm Tris acetate, 100 mm potassium acetate, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 3.5% polyethylene glycol 8000, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.9) and contained 5 nm template DNA, 3.4 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, 125 nm core RNA polymerase, 220 nm σ54, 75 nm IHF, and 3.5 mm ATP. GTP was present at a final concentration of 500 μm prior to heparin challenge to allow formation of initiated complexes, which are more stable than open promoter complexes. An ATP-regenerating system was provided by adding creatine kinase (20 units/ml) and creatine phosphate (12 mm). The reaction components were preincubated for 2 min at 30 °C. NifA alone (control samples) or NifA and NifL were incubated in the presence or absence (control samples) of 2-oxoglutarate for 10 min at 30 °C, and reactions were initiated by the addition of these samples to the reaction components. Following 20 min of incubation, reactions were mixed with 3 μl of dye mix containing 50% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 2 μg of heparin and immediately loaded onto a 4% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio, 80:1) in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 400 mm glycine, pH 8.6, which had been prerun at 180 V at room temperature down to a constant power of 2 W. Gels were run for 2.5–3.0 h at room temperature at 100 V. Gels were dried down, and the percentage of radioactivity in open complexes was quantitated with the Fujix BAS1000 phosphorimager. Limited Proteolysis—Limited proteolysis was performed at 20 °C in 50 mm Tris acetate, 100 mm potassium acetate, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.0. Final concentrations of NifA as well as other proteins and ligands added are indicated in the figure legends. A trypsin:NifA weight ratio of 1:600 was used. 15-μl samples were removed at the time intervals indicated in the figure legends to tubes containing a 10-fold weight excess of soybean trypsin-chymotrypsin inhibitor. To these samples were added 15 μl of gel loading buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 20% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, pH 8.6). Samples were heated at 100 °C for 4 min prior to electrophoretic separation. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—Experiments were performed in a VP-ITC isothermal titration calorimeter (MicroCal, Inc.) at 28 °C in a cell volume of 1.35 ml as described previously (21Little R. Colombo V. Leech A. Dixon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15472-15481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Buffer conditions were 50 mm Tris acetate, 100 mm potassium acetate, 50 mm KSCN, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5. NifA protein samples were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C prior to ITC, and protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Ligands were titrated from a 250-μl injection syringe into the sample cell, which was stirred at 450 rpm. Volumes of the ligand injections are indicated in the figure legends. The heat change for the dilution of the ligand in the absence of protein was measured for each experiment and was subtracted from the measured heat change of ligand binding to protein. Data analysis was performed with the Origin program, provided by MicroCal, using equations and curve-fitting analysis to obtain least squares estimates of the binding enthalpy, stoichiometry, and binding constant (25Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2438) Google Scholar). Binding stoichiometries were derived on the assumption that proteins and ligand were fully active with respect to binding. The GAF Domain of NifA Is Required for the Response to 2-Oxoglutarate—The role of the amino-terminal GAF domain of NifA proteins is not well defined, although in the gamma proteobacteria, which co-express nifL with nifA, this domain may play a role in modulating the NifL-NifA interaction. The inhibitory activity of NifL is stimulated by adenosine nucleotides to promote formation of the NifL-NifA complex (5Eydmann T. Söderbäck E. Jones T. Hill S. Austin S. Dixon R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1186-1195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Money T. Jones T. Dixon R. Austin S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4461-4468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Söderbäck E. Reyes-Ramirez F. Eydmann T. Austin S. Hill S. Dixon R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This protein-protein interaction sequesters NifA and inhibits ATP hydrolysis by the activator, thus preventing productive interactions with σ54-RNA polymerase and inhibiting transcriptional activation at nif promoters. We have demonstrated previously that the NifL-NifA system is directly responsive to the small molecular weight effector 2-oxoglutarate, which acts allosterically to relieve inhibition by NifL in the presence of adenosine nucleotides (16Little R. Reyes-Ramirez F. Zhang Y. van Heeswijk W.C. Dixon R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6041-6050Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), thus enabling NifA to interact with σ54-RNA polymerase holoenzyme. Because we had not detected any interaction between 2-oxoglutarate and NifL, we suspected that the amino-terminal GAF domain of NifA may be required for the response to this effector. Accordingly, we examined whether a truncated form of NifA lacking the GAF domain, NifA-(191–522), is responsive to 2-oxoglutarate in the presence of NifL. This truncated protein retains the ability to activate transcription and is responsive to NifL (8Barrett J. Ray P. Sobczyk A. Little R. Dixon R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 480-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For these assays, we measured the formation of open promoter complexes by NifA in the presence of σ54-RNA polymerase holoenzyme and integration host factor at the nifH promoter (5Eydmann T. Söderbäck E. Jones T. Hill S. Austin S. Dixon R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1186-1195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Open promoter complex formation by NifA was measured in the presence and absence of a truncated form of NifL, NifL-(147–519)His6, which lacks the redox-responsive PAS domain and thus avoids the necessity to perform assays under reducing conditions (7Söderbäck E. Reyes-Ramirez F. Eydmann T. Austin S. Hill S. Dixon R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous results, we observed that inhibition of wild-type NifA activity by NifL-(147–519)His6 in the presence of adenosine nucleotides was ablated at physiologically relevant concentrations of 2-oxoglutarate (Fig. 1, open squares). The assay was responsive between 0.01 and 2 mm 2-oxoglutarate to yield almost total relief of NifA activity from inhibition by NifL. However the response to 2-oxoglutarate was markedly different when the truncated NifA protein, NifA-(191–522), was examined. Although this truncated protein is susceptible to inhibition by NifL-(147–519)His6, little relief of inhibition was observed at concentrations of 2-oxoglutarate across the physiological range (Fig. 1, open triangles). Control experiments with NifA and NifA-(191–522) showed that these proteins did not give a significant response to 2-oxoglutarate in the absence of NifL (Fig. 1). These observations suggest that the GAF domain is necessary for the response to 2-oxoglutarate and that this response is exerted either directly or indirectly through the amino terminus of the NifA protein. Stochiometric Binding of 2-Oxoglutarate to NifA Measured by Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—We sought to directly measure binding of 2-oxoglutarate to the NifA protein using isothermal titration calorimetry. Titration of wild-type NifA with 2-oxoglutarate gave a K D of ∼57 μm (Fig. 2A, squares). Enthalpy values were negative, demonstrating that the binding of 2-oxoglutarate is an exothermic process. Data analysis of the binding isotherm gave a best fit to a single-site model with a binding stoichiometry of ∼1. The dissociation constant for the binding of 2-oxoglutarate to NifA compares favorably with the previously determined apparent k act of ∼150 μm for the interaction of 2-oxoglutarate with the NifL-NifA complex in vitro (16Little R. Reyes-Ramirez F. Zhang Y. van Heeswijk W.C. Dixon R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6041-6050Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The open complex assays demonstrated previously that this interaction was highly specific to 2-oxoglutarate, as 3-oxoglutarate and 2-oxobutyrate were not competent to relieve inhibition by NifL (16Little R. Reyes-Ramirez F. Zhang Y. van Heeswijk W.C. Dixon R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6041-6050Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To confirm the specificity of the interaction, a second portion of the same NifA sample was titrated with 3-oxoglutarate in the concentration range of 0–500 μm. No interaction was detected with 3-oxoglutarate across this concentration range (Fig. 2A, open circles). In comparable ITC experiments, we did not observe an interaction of 2-oxoglutarate with NifLHis6 (data not shown), indicating that this ligand binds to NifA but not to NifL. To investigate the possibility that 2-oxoglutarate interacts directly with the amino-terminal GAF domain of NifA, a construct comprising residues 1–203 with a carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine tag was prepared, and the expressed polypeptide was purified by nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. Titration of Av NifA-(1–203)His6 with 2-oxoglutarate gave a K D of ∼52 μm (Fig. 2B, squares). Data analysis of the binding isotherm gave a best fit to a single-site model with a binding stoichiometry of ∼0.82. Titration of 3-oxoglutarate with a second portion of the same Av NifA-(1–203)His6 preparation confirmed the specificity of the 2-oxoglutarate interaction (Fig. 2B, circles). Hence, these data show that 2-oxoglutarate, but not 3-oxoglutarate, binds to the isolated GAF domain of NifA. We also tested whether NifA could bind 2-oxoglutarate in the absence of the GAF domain using the truncated NifA derivative, NifA-(191–522). Titration up to a 54-fold excess of 2-oxoglutarate with NifA-(191–522) elicited only a very weak near-linear response (data not shown) with a fit to a K D of ∼7 mm, perhaps indicative of nonspecific binding. These results concur with the open complex assays and suggest that the GAF domain is the major site on the A. vinelandii NifA protein for the binding of 2-oxoglutarate. Sequence alignments with YKG9, the structural prototype for the GAF domain (12Ho Y.S. Burden L.M. Hurley J.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5288-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), indicate that the GAF domain of A. vinelandii NifA extends to residue 180. To determine whether this “minimal” GAF domain was competent to bind 2-oxoglutarate, we engineered a construct expressing residues 1–180. This polypeptide, Av NifAHis6-(1–180), gave a K D of ∼80 μm for binding to 2-oxoglutarate with a binding stoichiometry of ∼1 (Fig. 3A). Although GAF domains from other NifA proteins are not highly conserved, it is possible that the binding of 2-oxoglutarate could provide a common mechanism for regulating NifA activity, particularly for those NifA proteins which are inhibited by a NifL-like protein. The well-studied K. pneumoniae NifL and NifA proteins have several characteristics in common with their A. vinelandii counterparts, although these proteins have not been tractable to purification in their native forms (1Dixon R. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 169: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To determine whether NifA proteins from both organisms have common ligand binding properties, we expressed and purified the K. pneumoniae NifA GAF domain, which shows 44% identity to that of A. vinelandii. However, in contrast to the A. vinelandii GAF domain, binding of 2-oxoglutarate to the K. pneumoniae GAF domain construct, Kp NifAHis6-(1–178), was not detected by ITC (Fig. 3B). The Interaction of 2-Oxoglutarate with NifA Enhances Proteolytic Cleavage of the GAF Domain—We have shown previously that the amino-terminal region of NifA is particularly susceptible to proteolytic cleavage by trypsin. In the presence of nucleotides such as MgADP or MgATPγS, which bind to the central domain, the major cleavage products are 40- and 35-kDa polypeptides (which represent the central plus the carboxyl-terminal domain and the isolated central domain, respectively) and a 20-kDa polypeptide designated A6, which is a central domain subdomain fragment (Fig. 4A) (26Money T. Barrett J. Dixon R. Austin S. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The amino termini of these polypeptides result from cleavage at Arg-202, located within the linker between the GAF and central domains. We have also detected cleavages within the GAF domain itself at Arg-8, Arg-70, and Arg-165 (26Money T. Barrett J. Dixon R. Austin S. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We performed similar experiments to determine whether 2-oxoglutarate influences the pattern of proteolytic digestion of the GAF domain. Control experiments with wild-type NifA in the presence of 3.5 mm ATP revealed a similar pattern of digestion to that observed previously (Fig. 4B). The GAF domain was cleaved to yield the A1–A3 polypeptides, and we detected cleavage at Arg-202 to yield the 40-kDa central and DNA-binding domain fragment (A4) as well as the 35-kDa central domain polypeptide (A5) and its subfragment (A6). When NifA was preincubated with 2 mm 2-oxoglutarate, a similar pattern of digestion was observed, but the amino terminus was degraded far more rapidly to yield the A4, A5, and A6 polypeptides (Fig. 4B, lanes marked +). This suggests that 2-oxoglutarate exposes the amino terminus to cleavage by trypsin, probably as a consequence of a conformational change induced upon binding of this ligand. The change in trypsin sensitivity is apparently specific to 2-oxoglutarate, as the pattern of digestion was indistinguishable from that in the absence of ligand when 3-oxoglutarate was present (Fig. 4B, lanes marked 3). We have shown previously that when the NifL-NifA complex is formed, NifA is protected from proteolysis at Arg-202 and within the carboxyl-terminal region of the GAF domain, suggesting that NifL may restrict access to these cleavage sites or induce a conformational change (26Money T. Barrett J. Dixon R. Austin S. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Since the binding of 2-oxoglutarate to NifA prevents inhibition by NifL and potentially inhibits the interaction between the two proteins, we re-examined the influence of NifL on proteolysis of NifA in the presence of 2-oxoglutarate. Under the conditions used for proteolysis, NifL remained substantially resistant to trypsin digestion (Fig. 5A, lanes 2–4), and as anticipated, digestion of NifL was not influenced by 2-oxoglutarate (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 11–13 and 14–16). As observed previously in the presence of MgADP, the addition of NifL decreased the rate of trypsin digestion of full-length NifA (26Money T. Barrett J. Dixon R. Austin S. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, when 2-oxoglutarate was also present, this protection by NifL was significantly diminished (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 11–13 with 14–16), and digestion of NifA was more rapid (Fig. 5B, compare inverted triangles with diamonds). Loss of protection by NifL suggests that 2-oxoglutarate may inhibit the interaction between NifL and NifA, consistent with the increase in NifA activity under these conditions (Fig. 1). However, this relief from inhibition by NifL is overridden under conditions of excess fixed nitrogen. Our previous results demonstrated that the interaction of the non-modified form of Av GlnK with NifL restores inhibition of NifA activity in the presence of 2-oxoglutarate (16Little R. Reyes-Ramirez F. Zhang Y. van Heeswijk W.C. Dixon R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6041-6050Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 21Little R. Colombo V. Leech A. Dixon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15472-15481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Accordingly, when Av GlnK was also present, the rate of digestion of NifA decreased, implying that NifL again protected sites in NifA from proteolytic cleavage (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 14–16 with 17–19, and Fig. 5B, compare diamonds with circles). A mutant form of Av GlnK, GlnK E44C, which does not interact with NifL (21Little R. Colombo V. Leech A. Dixon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15472-15481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), did not protect NifA from cleavage in the presence of NifL (data not shown). Control experiments, where NifL was omitted from the reaction, indicated that Av GlnK itself did not protect NifA from digestion (Fig. 5A, lanes 5–10, and Fig. 5B, triangles and squares). Although it is clear that the NifL protein plays a major role in sensing the redox and fixed nitrogen status to control the activity of NifA, our results now demonstrate that its partner, NifA, also has an important role in signal perception through the response to 2-oxoglutarate. This study demonstrates that the GAF domain of A. vinelandii NifA binds one molecule of 2-oxoglutarate per monomer, enabling the protein to resist inhibition by the ADP-bound inhibitory form of NifL (Fig. 6). In the absence of 2-oxoglutarate, the interaction between NifL and NifA inhibits ATP hydrolysis by the activator (Fig. 6A), perhaps as a consequence of intramolecular repression mediated by the GAF domain (8Barrett J. Ray P. Sobczyk A. Little R. Dixon R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 480-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The limited proteolysis experiments suggest that the interaction with 2-oxoglutarate may alter the conformation of the GAF domain, decreasing the affinity for NifL (Fig. 6B) and hence releasing NifA from the complex to allow nucleotide triphosphate hydrolysis and consequent productive interactions with σ54-RNA polymerase. It is important to note that in the absence of NifL, transcriptional activation by NifA is not influenced by 2-oxoglutarate, and therefore this ligand does not apparently modulate NifA activity per se under our assay conditions (16Little R. Reyes-Ramirez F. Zhang Y. van Heeswijk W.C. Dixon R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6041-6050Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A truncated NifA protein lacking the GAF domain exhibits a weaker interaction with NifL but remains responsive to inhibition (6Money T. Jones T. Dixon R. Austin S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4461-4468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Barrett J. Ray P. Sobczyk A. Little R. Dixon R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 480-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, there appears to be an alteration in the response of the truncated protein to NifL because unlike the wild-type protein, the catalytic activity (nucleotide triphosphate hydrolysis) of the central domain is not inhibited by the presence of NifL (8Barrett J. Ray P. Sobczyk A. Little R. Dixon R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 480-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this study we have observed that the truncated protein is unable to respond to the presence of 2-oxoglutarate so that NifA activity remains inhibited. We predict that this would lead to a situation in which the truncated NifA is constitutively repressed by NifL in vivo. Unfortunately, we have not been able to test this hypothesis, as truncated forms of NifA lacking the GAF domain appear to be unstable in vivo. 2F. Reyes-Ramirez and R. Dixon, unpublished results. We have isolated two missense mutations in the NifA GAF domain, L120P and R155C, which render the protein insensitive to inhibition by NifL (27Reyes-Ramirez F. Little R. Dixon R. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6777-6785Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It is possible that these mutations lock NifA in a conformation that is resistant to NifL, even in the absence of 2-oxoglutarate. The allosteric effect of 2-oxoglutarate on NifA activity in the presence of NifL (Fig. 6B) is apparently overridden under oxidizing conditions or in fixed nitrogen excess. Our biochemical studies have show that the non-modified form of the signal transduction protein Av GlnK, which is prevalent under conditions of fixed nitrogen sufficiency, binds to the carboxylterminal domain of NifL to inactivate NifA (21Little R. Colombo V. Leech A. Dixon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15472-15481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This interaction occurs even at high 2-oxoglutarate concentrations in vitro, thus re-establishing inhibition by NifL even when the binding site on the GAF domain of NifA is saturated (Fig. 6C). Hence, the interaction with Av GlnK may induce a conformational change in NifL that compensates for the change brought about by the binding of 2-oxoglutarate to the GAF domain of NifA. The Av GlnK-NifL-NifA interaction is also complicated by the potential involvement of 2-oxoglutarate as an allosteric effector of Av GlnK. However, we have found that the binding constant of Av GlnK for 2-oxoglutarate is relatively high compared with that of enteric PII proteins and that binding of Av GlnK to NifL is not particularly responsive to the 2-oxoglutarate concentration (21Little R. Colombo V. Leech A. Dixon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15472-15481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Our studies have shown that 2-oxoglutarate binds to the GAF domain of A. vinelandii NifA, but not apparently to K. pneumoniae NifA. There are several differences in the mechanism in which the NifL-NifA systems from these organisms respond to fixed nitrogen. In K. pneumoniae, GlnK is required to prevent NifL from inhibiting NifA under nitrogen-limiting conditions (28He L. Soupene E. Ninfa A. Kustu S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6661-6667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Jack R. De Zamaroczy M. Merrick M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1156-1162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely in A. vinelandii, the non-uridylylated form of GlnK is required for NifL to inhibit NifA under conditions of nitrogen excess (21Little R. Colombo V. Leech A. Dixon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15472-15481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 22Rudnick P. Kunz C. Gunatilaka M.K. Hines E.R. Kennedy C. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 812-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Under conditions of nitrogen limitation, the binding of 2-oxoglutarate to A. vinelandii NifA is required to prevent inhibition by NifL, whereas in the K. pneumoniae system, the interaction with GlnK appears to provide this function. Therefore, there may not be a requirement for an additional ligand such as 2-oxoglutarate in the K. pneumoniae NifL-NifA system; it is possible that the GAF domain in this case is required for the interaction with GlnK. In diazotrophs that do not contain NifL, such as Azospirillum brasiliense, there is evidence that PII signal transduction proteins directly or indirectly modulate the activity of NifA via the GAF domain (30Arsene F. Kaminski P.A. Elmerich C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4830-4838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Liang Y.Y. de Zamaroczy M. Arsene F. Paquelin A. Elmerich C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 100: 113-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GAF domains are ubiquitous in organisms from all phyla and have been proposed to bind a diverse set of regulatory small molecules (11Aravind L. Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 458-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 12Ho Y.S. Burden L.M. Hurley J.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5288-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 13Anantharaman V. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1271-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, although more than 1200 GAF domain proteins have been identified, ligand binding has only so far been demonstrated with the cyclic nucleotide-responsive GAF domains (12Ho Y.S. Burden L.M. Hurley J.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5288-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 15Kanacher T. Schultz A. Linder J.U. Schultz J.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3672-3680Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and the FhlA transcriptional activator, a σ54-dependent activator related to NifA, which is responsive to formate (14Hopper S. Böck A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2798-2803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hopper S. Korsa I. Böck A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 199-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Korsa I. Böck A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 41-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our observation that NifA binds 2-oxoglutarate thus extends the range of small molecules bound by GAF domains. The physiological consequences of the interaction between 2-oxoglutarate and NifA are likely to be most apparent under conditions of nitrogen and oxygen limitation. Under nitrogen-limiting conditions, Av GlnK is primarily modified by uridylylation, and Av GlnK-UMP is not competent to interact with NifL (16Little R. Reyes-Ramirez F. Zhang Y. van Heeswijk W.C. Dixon R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6041-6050Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 21Little R. Colombo V. Leech A. Dixon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15472-15481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Provided that the flavin moiety in the PAS domain of NifL remains in a reduced state and the binding pocket in the carboxyl-terminal domain of NifL is saturated with adenosine nucleotide (7Söderbäck E. Reyes-Ramirez F. Eydmann T. Austin S. Hill S. Dixon R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), we predict that the ability of NifL to inhibit NifA under conditions of fixed nitrogen limitation will be dependent upon the concentration of 2-oxoglutarate. Clearly, the NifL-NifA system is responsive to 2-oxoglutarate within the physiological range (17Senior P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 123: 407-418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Reyes-Ramirez F. Little R. Dixon R. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3076-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although 2-oxoglutarate can undoubtedly provide an indirect readout of the nitrogen status, 2-oxoglutarate provides a key signal of the carbon status (19Ninfa A.J. Jiang P. Atkinson M.R. Peliska J.A. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 2000; 36: 31-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, whereas NifL perceives the oxygen and fixed nitrogen status to control NifA activity, the GAF domain of NifA may provide a sensor for carbon availability via its response to 2-oxoglutarate. The importance of 2-oxoglutarate as a signaling molecule is also beginning to emerge in other systems, particularly the cyanobacteria, whereby the activity of the global nitrogen regulator NtcA is influenced by interaction with 2-oxoglutarate (34Muro-Pastor M.I.

Although, not considered as nectins by this definition, the ectodomains of the poliovirus and vitronectin receptor CD155 (formerly PVR) (17Mendelsohn C.L. Wimmer E. Racaniello V.R. Cell. 1989; 56: 855-865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar) and that of its putative rodent homologue Tage4 (18Chadeneau C. LeMoullac B. Denis M.G. J. Biol.

Gene (Amst.). 2001; 265: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) share significant homology with nectins (54% amino acid identity between CD155 and nectin-2). In fact, the first members of the nectin gene family have been identified through their homology to CD155 (4Morrison M.E. Racaniello V.R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2807-2813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Eberle F. Dubreuil P. Mattei M.G. Devilard E. Lopez M.

Gene (Amst.). 1995; 155: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Together, CD155, Tage4, and nectins comprise a new group of Ig superfamily proteins. They are single span type I a transmembrane glycoproteins with three Ig-like domains (V-C2-C2) and a generally short cytoplasmic domain. The CD155 gene is expressed in four isoforms. Two of the four alternatively spliced variants, CD155α and CD155δ, are membrane-bound and serve as poliovirus receptor, whereas the significance of two secreted versions, CD155β and -γ, is not clear (20Koike S. Horie H. Ise I. Okitsu A. Yoshida M. Iizuka N. Takeuchi K. Takegami T. Nomoto A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3217-3224Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). CD155 mRNA is widely expressed, although in relatively low amounts, in human and CD155tg mouse tissues, including brain, spinal cord, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, spleen, leukocyte, liver, lung, and placenta (20Koike S. Horie H. Ise I. Okitsu A. Yoshida M. Iizuka N. Takeuchi K. Takegami T. Nomoto A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3217-3224Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 21Koike S. Taya C. Kurata T. Abe S. Ise I.

Cell. 1990; 63: 353-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In humans, CD155 is prominently expressed by enterocytes and cells of gastrointestinal lymphatic tissues (24Iwasaki A. Welker R. Mueller S. Linehan M. Nomoto A. Wimmer E. J Infect. Dis. 2002; 186: 585-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The ectodomain of CD155 establishes cell-matrix contacts by interaction with vitronectin (25Lange R. Peng X. Wimmer E. Lipp M. Bernhardt G. Virology. 2001; 285: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although the overall structure of CD155 as an Ig superfamily protein and the similarity to nectins suggests a possible role in cell-cell adhesion, no binding partners that would support such a notion have been identified thus far. In fact, in contrast to nectins, there is no evidence for CD155-mediated trans-homophilic cell-cell adhesion or for CD155 cis-homodimerization (8Aoki J. Koike S. Asou H. Ise I. Suwa H. Tanaka T.

Chem. 2000; 275: 613-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the short cytoplasmic domains of CD155α and CD155δ interact with Tctex-1, a light chain subunit of the dynein motor complex (26Mueller S. Cao X. Welker R. Wimmer E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7897-7904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This interaction is thought to mediate retrograde axonal transport of CD155 containing endocytic vesicles (26Mueller S. Cao X. Welker R. Wimmer E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7897-7904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In addition, the cytoplasmic domain of CD155α binds the mu1B subunit of the clathrin adaptor complex, an interaction that is responsible for sorting of the CD155α isotype protein to basolateral membranes in epithelial cells (27Ohka S. Ohno H. Tohyama K. Nomoto A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 941-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Studies of CD155 have been complicated by uncertainty over whether a functional rodent homologue of CD155 exists, a conundrum that has restricted and even misled earlier work. It is now clear that a mouse gene termed MPH, which was long held to be the mouse homologue of CD155, is, in fact, the homologue of human nectin-2 (formerly PRR2 or PVRL2) (4Morrison M.E. Racaniello V.R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2807-2813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Eberle F. Dubreuil P. Mattei M.G. Devilard E. Lopez M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 159: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The rodent Tage4 gene, sharing only 46% amino acid identity with CD155, has recently been proposed as the possible CD155 homologue based on conserved gene structure and syngenic chromosomal localization (19Baury B. Geraghty R.J. Masson D. Lustenberger P. Spear P.G. Denis M.G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 265: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, no functional relationship between these two molecules could be thus far established. Mice are not a natural host for poliovirus, and cultured mouse cells cannot be infected with poliovirus. Therefore, the development of transgenic mice expressing the human CD155 gene has greatly facilitated the study of CD155 function (21Koike S. Taya C. Kurata T. Abe S. Ise I. Yonekawa H. Nomoto A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 951-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 23Ren R.B. Costantini F. Gorgacz E.J. Lee J.J. Racaniello V.R. Cell. 1990; 63: 353-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). CD155tg mice are highly susceptible to poliovirus infection and develop disease symptoms very similar to poliomyelitis in humans, indicating that the human transgene functions similarly in mice as it does in humans. Here we show that nectin-3 interacts with CD155, leading to unidirectional recruitment of nectin-3 to cell-cell contacts with neighboring CD155-expressing cells. This interaction was found to depend on dimerization/multimerization of CD155, which appears to be promoted by cell type-specific cofactors. Mouse Tage4 (referred to below as mCD155) showed similar affinity for nectin-3, providing the first evidence for a functional relationship between CD155 and its mouse counterpart. In vivo, nectin-3 and CD155 colocalized at lateral cell-cell junctions in epithelia of proximal kidney tubules and of the amniotic membrane. We determined that CD155 and αv integrin colocalize to membrane microdomains on the cell surface of mouse fibroblasts and to cell-cell and cell-matrix junctions in the amniotic membrane. We propose that CD155 and nectin-3 are mediators of trans-heterophilic cell-cell adhesion and may provide a link between the classical cell-cell adhesion system (cadherin/nectin) and the cell-matrix adhesion system (integrin/CD155). Cells and Plasmids—Human embryonal kidney cells (HEK 293), HeLa cells, African green monkey kidney cells (COS-1), mouse fibroblast cells (L(tk–)), mouse neuroblastoma cells (Neuro2a), and rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12) were obtained from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing penicillin/streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) or 15% fetal bovine serum (PC12 cells). Fusing the coding sequence of the extracellular domains of CD155, nectin-3, or nectin-1 upstream of the open reading frame of the secreted, heat-stable human placental alkaline phosphatase (SEAP), 2The abbreviations used are: SEAP, secreted, heat-stable human placental alkaline phosphatase; AP, alkaline phosphatase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BS3, bis-(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate. in vector pAPtag2 (28Cheng H.J.

Flanagan) was used to express untagged SEAP protein. pCDNA-CD155(AO) (G. Bernhardt, University of Hannover, Germany) contains the entire CD155α cDNA in pCDNA3. For eukaryotic cell transfection, the full-length open reading frames of mouse nectin-1α, mouse nectin-2α, and mouse nectin-3α were cloned into pCDNA3.1, resulting in pCDNA-nectin-1, pCDNA-nectin-2, pCDNA-nectin-3, respectively. Two I.M.A.G.E. consortium clones, 4188634 and 4953896, containing the full-length open reading frame of mouse Tage4 in vector pCMV-Sport6 were obtained from ATTC. These plasmids afford eukaryotic expression and were used directly for DNA transfection. Plasmids encoding the human αv and β3 integrin subunits were kindly provided by Drs. Eric Brown and Mark Ginsberg. Stably transfected HEK 293 cell lines secreting CD155-AP, nectin-3-AP, or nectin-1-AP fusion proteins or untagged SEAP alone were produced by cotransfection of empty pCDNA3.1 vector (carrying a neo selection marker) with either pCD155-AP, pNectin-3-AP, pNectin-1-AP, or pAPtag4, respectively. Cells were subjected to selection with 500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen), and cell clones were isolated and screened for AP activity in the supernatant. HeLa, HEK 293, L(tk–) and Neuro2a, and PC12 cells stably expressing full-length CD155α, nectin-1α, nectin-2α, or nectin-3α were derived by DNA transfection with pCDNA-CD155(AO), pCDNA-nectin-1, pCDNA-nectin-2, or pCDNA-nectin-3, followed by selection with 500–750 μg/ml G418. The cell lines were subcloned in order to obtain lines with similar expression levels.

Ligand Binding Assays—Receptor-AP in situ ligand binding was performed as previously described (33Flanagan J.G. Cheng H.J. Feldheim D.A. Hattori M. Lu Q. Vanderhaeghen P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 34Flanagan J.G. Leder P. Cell. 1990; 63: 185-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Briefly, HEK 293 cell supernatants containing AP fusion protein probes were diluted with growth medium to obtain a uniform AP activity of 2500 A 405/ml*h for all probes. COS-1 cells transiently transfected with expression vectors for individual target proteins were incubated with AP fusion protein probes for 1 h at 37 °C. The probes were then aspirated, and cells were washed five times with warm Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS), containing 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The cells were then fixed with 4% formaldehyde and 60% acetone in PBS for 2 min and washed twice with HBSS/bovine serum albumin, followed by heating of the culture dishes at 65 °C for 4 h in order to inactivate cell endogenous, heat-labile AP. The monolayers were washed twice with double-distilled H2O, and bound AP fusion probes were detected by incubation with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium colorimetric AP substrate (Sigma). Alternatively, stable HEK 293, HeLa, L(tk–), and PC12 cell lines expressing individual target proteins were produced and processed as described above. To test the effect of cross-linked CD155 binding to nectin-3, CD155-AP supernatant was preincubated with anti-AP mAb 8B6 (1:500) for 1 h at room temperature before being added to the target cells. Alternatively, a fusion protein between the CD155 ectodomain and the Fc portion of mouse IgG2a (CD155-Fc) was used instead of CD155-AP (35Arita M. Horie H. Nomoto A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1066-1074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This protein is expressed as a dimer due to the biological activity of the Fc region (35Arita M. Horie H. Nomoto A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1066-1074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of CD155-Fc was assessed by subsequent incubation with anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies conjugated to AP. For antibody blocking of nectin-3-AP binding to CD155-expressing cells, the cells were preincubated with 10 μg/ml of an unrelated mouse mAb or mAb D171, P286, P403, or P275 for 30 min at 37 °C before the addition of nectin-3-AP. In order to quantitate cell-bound AP fusion proteins, confluent 6-well plates of HeLa, HeLa-CD155, L(tk–), and L(tk–)-CD155 cells were incubated with AP fusion probes as above. However, instead of fixing the cells after the washing step, cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton, and the lysate was incubated at 68 °C for 45 min. The amount of AP activity of each binding reaction was determined spectrophotometrically at 405 nm using 9 mg/ml p-nitrophenylphosphate (in 1 m diethanolamine, pH 9.8, 0.5 mm MgCl2) as a colorimetric, water-soluble substrate. In parallel, 105 cell equivalents of total lysate were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis with CD155-specific antiserum NAEZ-8 (1:5000)/anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000). Immune reactive bands were detected using Lumi-Light chemiluminescence substrate (Roche Molecular Biosciences). Coculture Assays, Tissue Sections, and Coimmunofluorescence Analysis—HeLa, HeLa-CD155, and HeLa-nectin-3 (or HeLa-nectin-2) cell lines were seeded on glass coverslips at a ratio of 3:1:1. Alternatively, HeLa and HeLa-nectin-3 cells were seeded 2 days prior to superseeding with Neuro2a-CD155 cells. Cells were incubated for an additional 2 days and then fixed with either –20 °C cold methanol/acetone (1:1) for 30 min or 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100. Adult kidneys and amniotic membranes (embryonic day 15.5) were recovered from pregnant, CD155tg female mice (ICR-PVRTg21) (21Koike S. Taya C. Kurata T. Abe S. Ise I. Yonekawa H. Nomoto A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 951-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Human amniotic membranes used in this study were discarded clinical samples from term deliveries (kindly provided by Dr. Diana Roth, Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY). Specimen were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 4 h, followed by perfusion with 25% sucrose in PBS. Tissues were then frozen in OCT cryo-protectant (Tissue-Tek™), and 10-μm-thick cryo-sections were collected on poly(L)-lysine-coated slides. Sections were air-dried and postfixed in cold 1:1 methanol/acetone for 90 min at –20 °C before processing. For immunofluorescence detection, sections were blocked with PBS containing 5% normal horse and 2% normal goat serum (PBS/HG) for 2 h at room temperature, followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with primary antibodies in PBS/HG at the dilutions stated above. After washing five times for 10 min with PBS, the sections were incubated with secondary antibody in PBS/HG for 1 h at 37 °C. The primary/secondary antibody combinations were either NAEZ-8/mAb 103-A1 with anti-rabbit (Alexa488)/anti-rat (Cy3), mAb D171/mAb 103-A1 with anti-mouse (Alexa488)/anti-rat (Cy3), or mAb 18/anti-αvβ3 with anti-mouse(Cy3)/anti-rabbit (Alexa488). The sections were washed five times for 20 min with PBS and mounted with Immu-Mount (Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA). Images were obtained with a Bio-Rad Radiance laser-scanning confocal microscope using the LaserSharp 2000 software package and processed with Adobe Photoshop software. Bis-(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3) Surface Cross-linking of CD155—10-cm dishes with confluent monolayers of HeLa-CD155 and L(tk–)-CD155 cells were washed three times with ice-cold HBSS, followed by incubation with 1 mm of the chemical cross-linker BS3 (Pierce) in HBSS under gentle agitation for 30 min at 4 °C. The monolayers were then washed twice with HBSS, and the cross-linking reaction was quenched with HBSS containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Cells were scraped off the plates and collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. The cell pellets were lysed by boiling in gel loading buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue), and 105 cell equivalents of lysate were subjected to CD155 Western blot as described above. Interaction of CD155 and Nectin-3 in Cell-based Ligand Binding Assays—In order to test for interactions between nectin/CD155 family members, we employed a method developed by Flanagan and Leder (33Flanagan J.G. Cheng H.J. Feldheim D.A. Hattori M. Lu Q. Vanderhaeghen P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 34Flanagan J.G. Leder P. Cell. 1990; 63: 185-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) that makes use of recombinant receptor-AP fusion proteins as affinity probes. Four affinity probes were expressed in HEK 293 cells by fusing the ectodomains of CD155, mouse nectin-1, mouse nectin-2, and mouse nectin-3 to SEAP (see Fig. 1A), a genetically modified derivative of the human PLAP-1 gene (36Berger J. Hauber J. Hauber R. Geiger R. Cullen B.R. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 66: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). The fusion proteins are targeted for secretion into the medium by virtue of the signal sequence endogenous to each of the receptor moieties. Between 2500 and 10,000 A 405/ml*h of AP activity was detected in the various culture supernatants, compared with 1–2 A 405/ml*h in supernatants of untransfected cells. Western blot analysis with anti-PLAP-1 mAb 8B6 was performed in order to ascertain the predicted size of the expressed proteins (Fig. 1B). All fusion proteins were detected as a single immune reactive band with no visible truncation products. Although the calculated molecular masses of the recombinant proteins were between 90 and 100 kDa, the apparent molecular masses were fo"
https://openalex.org/W1970199985,"The human Cdc25A phosphatase plays a pivotal role at the G1/S transition by activating cyclin E and A/Cdk2 complexes through dephosphorylation. In response to ionizing radiation, Cdc25A is phosphorylated by both Chk1 and Chk2 on Ser-123. This in turn leads to ubiquitylation and rapid degradation of Cdc25A by the proteasome resulting in cell cycle arrest. We found that in response to UV irradiation, Cdc25A is phosphorylated at a different serine residue, Ser-75. Significantly, Cdc25A mutants carrying alanine instead of either Ser-75 or Ser-123 demonstrate that only Ser-75 mediates protein stabilization in response to UV-induced DNA damage. As a consequence, cyclin E/Cdk2 kinase activity was high. Furthermore, we find that Cdc25A was phosphorylated by Chk1 on Ser-75 in vitro and that the same site was also phosphorylated in vivo. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that phosphorylation of Cdc25A on Ser-75 by Chk1 and its subsequent degradation is required to delay cell cycle progression in response to UV-induced DNA lesions.

Progression through the eukaryotic cell cycle involves the periodic activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk). 1The abbreviations used are: Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia mutated; ATR, ATM- and Rad53-related protein kinase; IR, ionizing radiation; HA, hemagglutinin; TPCK, l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone or tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone; TLCK, 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone or Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone; GST, glutathione S-transferase; WT, wild type.1The abbreviations used are: Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia mutated; ATR, ATM- and Rad53-related protein kinase; IR, ionizing radiation; HA, hemagglutinin; TPCK, l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone or tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone; TLCK, 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone or Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone; GST, glutathione S-transferase; WT, wild type. The activities of these enzymes are regulated by multiple mechanisms including binding to their activating proteins, the cyclins. Another layer of control derives from binding of inhibitor proteins of the Cdk but also from both activating and inactivating phosphorylations (1Pines J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E73-E79Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Cell cycle checkpoints responding to damaged or unreplicated DNA elicit signaling pathways that lead to inhibition of Cdks. At each checkpoint, the cell determines whether it is ready for progression to the next phase and halts progression if conditions are unfavorable, for example, if DNA damage has not been repaired (2Nyberg K.A. Michelson R.J. Putnam C.W. Weinert T.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2002; 36: 617-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Therefore, the survival of organisms depends on the accurate checkpoint regulation.The mammalian DNA damage response pathway consists of several families of conserved protein kinases. These include a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family member ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and the related kinase ATR (the ATM- and Rad53-related protein kinase). These kinases are sensitive to two different types of checkpoint signals. Although cells lacking ATM are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation (IR) but not hydroxyurea or UV, overexpression of a kinase-inactive form of ATR is sensitive to both hydroxyurea and UV as well as to IR. Downstream of ATM and ATR are two protein kinases, Chk1 and Chk2 (or Cds1). ATR functions as a direct upstream activator of Chk1 in human cells (3Zhao H. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Both checkpoint kinases directly target regulators of the cell cycle. The final gatekeeper that blocks entry of DNA-damaged cells into mitosis is the G2 checkpoint. The current model posits that DNA damage leads to the activation of Chk1 and Chk2, which in turn phosphorylate Ser-216 on Cdc25C and thus inhibits its phosphatase activity (4Peng C.Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A.S. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1997; 277: 1501-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar, 5Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). This in turn leads to an inhibition of Cdk1/Cyclin B and cell cycle arrest in G2 phase. The critical role for Chk1 in the implementation of the G2 checkpoint is underscored by the finding that Chk1–/– embryonic stem cells display a substantial reduction in G2 arrest following DNA damage (6Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar).Maintenance of the G1/S arrest after DNA damage is mediated by a Chk1- or Chk2-dependent phosphorylation of p53. This in turn results in the induction of the p21/Cip Cdk inhibitor. p21 can stoichiometrically bind and inhibit all of the cellular S-phase-promoting cyclin E/Cdk2. It has also been shown that in response to DNA damage, a p53-independent G1-checkpoint is induced. Upon UV radiation or replication block, human Chk1 phosphorylates Cdc25A, the tyrosine phosphatase that activates Cdk2/cyclin A or E complexes needed for DNA synthesis (7Hoffmann I. Draetta G. Karsenti E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4302-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 8Blomberg I. Hoffmann I. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5911-5920Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to binding of CIP/KIP inhibitors before the G1/S phase transition, phosphorylation of Cdk2 is used to accumulate and maintain cyclin E/Cdk2 complexes in a pre-active stage.The phosphorylation of Cdc25A by Chk1 induced by UV irradiation leads to a proteasome-dependent degradation of the protein (10Mailand N. Falck J. Lukas C. Syljuasen R.G. Welcker M. Bartek J. Lukas J. Science. 2000; 288: 1425-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that Cdc25A phosphatase is a target of the DNA replication checkpoint (11Molinari M. Mercurio C. Dominguez J. Goubin F. Draetta G.F. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Ionizing radiation also induces degradation of Cdc25A and requires both ATM and the Chk2-mediated phosphorylation of Cdc25A on Ser-123. Mutant Chk2 alleles associated with a variant form of Li-Fraumeni syndrome (12Bell D.W. Varley J.M. Szydlo T.E. Kang D.H. Wahrer D.C. Shannon K.E. Lubratovich M. Verselis S.J. Isselbacher K.J. Fraumeni J.F. Birch J.M. Li F.P. Garber J.E. Haber D.A. Science. 1999; 286: 2528-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar) failed to bind and/or phosphorylate Cdc25A. Recently, it has also been shown that Ser-123 is a target of Chk1 kinase in response to ionizing radiation (13Zhao H. Watkins J.L. Piwnica-Worms H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14795-14800Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). During the early embryonic cell cycle, Chk1 but not Chk2 is activated transiently at the mid-blastula transition and is essential for the cell cycle elongation and Cdc25A degradation at this transition (14Shimuta K. Nakajo N. Uto K. Hayano Y. Okazaki K. Sagata N. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3694-3703Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).Here we have performed a detailed molecular analysis of the regulation of Cdc25A by the checkpoint kinase Chk1 in human cells. We show that Ser-75 is a target of Chk1 kinase both in vitro and in vivo. Our data demonstrate that phosphorylation on Ser-75 by Chk1 is required for degradation of Cdc25A in response to UV-induced DNA damage. Phosphorylation of Cdc25A on Ser-123, however, leads to degradation of Cdc25A similar to the wild-type protein. These data suggest that phosphorylation of Ser-75 by Chk1 is necessary for the degradation of Cdc25A in response to UV-induced DNA damage, whereas phosphorylation of Ser-123 leads to destruction of Cdc25A in response to ionizing radiation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture, Antibodies, and Western Blotting—HeLa and U2OS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Biochrom) and 2 mml-glutamine (Sigma) at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a humidified chamber.The following antibodies were used: HE 111 for cyclin E immunoprecipitation; HE 12 for cyclin E Western blotting; anti-Cdc25A F6; anti-Chk1 G4 (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology for Western blotting); C2 for immunoprecipitation of Cdc25A (8Blomberg I. Hoffmann I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6183-6194Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar); anti-cyclin B1 (8Blomberg I. Hoffmann I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6183-6194Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar); anti-hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope tag (clone 16B12, Babco) for Western analysis; anti-HA (clone 3F10, Roche Applied Science) for immunoprecipitation; anti-Cdk2 (7Hoffmann I. Draetta G. Karsenti E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4302-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar); and anti-β-actin (clone C4, ICN). Harvested cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF) supplemented with protease inhibitors (aprotinin, leupeptin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, TPCK, TLCK, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and 0.1 mm Na3VO4 for 30 min on ice followed by centrifugation at 13000 rpm for 10 min. Cleared lysates were assayed for protein concentration using the Bio-Rad protein assay system and subjected to immunoblotting. Bound primary antibodies were detected with either horseradish peroxidase-goat anti-rabbit antibody or horseradish peroxidase-goat anti-mouse antibody (Jackson). Enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagents were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.Cdc25A Phosphatase and Histone H1 Kinase Assays—To prepare the substrate for a Cdc25A phosphatase assay, cyclin B1/Cdk1 was immunoprecipitated using anti-cyclin B1 antibodies from HeLa S3 cells that were arrested in S-phase by treatment with 10 mm hydroxyurea for 18 h. Under these conditions, Cdk1 complexed with cyclin B1 is phosphorylated on threonine 14 and tyrosine 15, causing an inactivation of its kinase activity. The cyclin B1 immunoprecipitate was incubated with recombinant or immunoprecipitated Cdc25A for 15 min at 30 °Cin 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and the resulting activity of the kinase was measured by phosphorylation of histone H1 as described previously (8Blomberg I. Hoffmann I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6183-6194Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). After immunoprecipitation, pellets were incubated at 30 °C in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [32P]μATP for 15 min. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. Cyclin E-dependent kinase activities were measured on histone H1 as substrate using the same assay conditions.Plasmids, Transfection, and UV Treatment of Cells—The HA epitope tag (YPYDVPDYA) was inserted at the 5′ end of pTriEx-Cdc25A digested with SmaI and SacI (New England Biolabs) using hybridized oligonucleotides (SmaI-HA-SacI).The HA-Cdc25A was cloned into the pX-vector (15Superti-Furga G. Bergers G. Picard D. Busslinger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5114-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) transferring SmaI-HA-Cdc25A-HindIII from pTriEX-HA-Cdc25A digested with SmaI and HindIII. A modified pET9d-vector including a His6 epitope tag (a kind gift from G. Stier, EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany) was used to generate pET9d-His-Cdc25A constructs. Point mutations were introduced into plasmid pX-HA-Cdc25A and pET9d-His-Cdc25A vectors by using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene), and successful mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing.Transfections were carried out by using the calcium phosphate method. For transfections, 1 × 106 HeLa or U2OS cells were plated/10-cm dish and allowed to grow for 24 h. Plasmid DNA was mixed with CaCl2, and this mixture was added to a 2× HBS (280 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm Na2HPO4, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0) solution and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The CaCl2/HBS precipitate was then added dropwise to the cell medium. After a 12-h incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2, cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and fresh medium was added to the cells for an additional 8–12 h of incubation. For UV treatment, the medium was removed and cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and then irradiated in uncovered tissues culture dishes with 254-nm UV light at a dose of 100 J/m2 delivered in a UV-Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene). Fresh culture medium was added back, and cells were further incubated for 60–90 min.Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—For the in vitro phosphoamino acid analysis, His6-Cdc25A was phosphorylated with GST-Chk1 or GSTChk2 purified from baculovirus-infected Hi5 cells, separated by SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. For the in vivo phosphoamino acid analysis, pX-HA-Cdc25A was transfected into HeLa cells for 36 h, metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (1 mCi/ml, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 4 h, and isolated by immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody (clone 3F10, Roche Applied Science) on protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) overnight. The phosphoamino acid analysis was performed as described previously (16Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar).Two-dimensional Phosphopeptide Mapping—Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping was performed as described previously (3Zhao H. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). U2OS cells transfected with pX-HA-Cdc25A WT or S75A mutant were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (1 mCi/ml) for 1 h in presence of 25 μg/ml LLnL (Sigma) to prevent Cdc25A degradation following the subsequent UV irradiation at 100 J/m2. Cells were then exposed to 100 J/m2 ultraviolet C light and further incubated with the labeling medium for 2 h. The cells were lysed in RIPA buffer, and the HA-tagged proteins were recovered by immunoprecipitation. After SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose membrane, the immobilized proteins were digested with 15 μg of trypsin (Worthington) and 5 μg of chymotrypsin (Roche Applied Science) in 200 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate at 37 °C overnight. The peptides were finally resolved on thin layer plates (Merck) in the first dimension with pH 1.9 buffer and in the second dimension with phosphochromatography buffer as described previously (16Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar).RESULTSAnalysis of Chk1 and Chk2 Phosphorylation Sites in Cdc25A—To analyze Cdc25A phosphorylation by the “checkpoint kinases” Chk1 and Chk2, we first performed in vitro kinase assays. GST-Chk1 and GST-Chk2 were purified from insect cells and used to phosphorylate recombinant His6-Cdc25A in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. We found that recombinant GST-Chk1 and GST-Chk2 kinases phosphorylated His6-Cdc25A efficiently in vitro (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 3). In contrast, the kinase-inactive GST-Chk1kin– and Chk2kin– proteins could not use His6-Cdc25A as substrate (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 4). We then carried out phosphoamino acid analysis from excised His6-Cdc25A proteins that were either phosphorylated in vitro by GST-Chk1 or GST-Chk2 or in vivo after labeling with [32P]orthophosphate in HeLa cells. Fig. 1B, left panel, shows that Chk1 phosphorylates Cdc25A both on serine and threonine residues, whereas Chk2 is able to phosphorylate Cdc25A only on serine residues (Fig. 1B, middle panel). However, HACdc25A labeled in vivo in the presence of [32P]orthophosphate contained phosphoserine exclusively (Fig. 1B, right panel), suggesting that endogenous Cdc25A is phosphorylated solely on serine residues. To analyze whether phosphorylation of Cdc25A with Chk1 would alter its phosphatase activity, GSTCdc25A was first phosphorylated by GST-Chk1 or GSTChk1kin– in the presence of ATP and then immunoprecipitated using antibodies specific for Cdc25A (C2) and analyzed for its ability to dephosphorylate tyrosine-phosphorylated cyclin B1/Cdk1. The activity of cyclin B1/Cdk1 was assayed as described previously (8Blomberg I. Hoffmann I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6183-6194Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Our results show that Cdc25A phosphatase activity decreases approximately 3-fold in vitro upon phosphorylation by Chk1 kinase (Fig. 1C). Thus, Cdc25A phosphatase activity can be directly inhibited through phosphorylation by Chk1, a process that might occur prior to protein degradation.Cdc25A Is Phosphorylated on Ser-75 in Response to UV-induced DNA Damage—The complexity of Chk1 phosphorylation of Cdc25A as demonstrated by two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps reveals that Chk1 phosphorylates Cdc25A at multiple sites (13Zhao H. Watkins J.L. Piwnica-Worms H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14795-14800Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). In addition to the identification of Ser-123 as a target for Chk1 phosphorylation, the human Cdc25A protein sequence contains additional six serine residues that corresponds to the consensus Chk1 and Chk2 phosphorylation motif (Arg-X-X-Ser) (17Chen P. Luo C. Deng Y. Ryan K. Register J. Margosiak S. Tempczyk-Russell A. Nguyen B. Myers P. Lundgren K. Kan C.C. O'Connor P.M. Cell. 2000; 100: 681-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Among them are Ser-75, Ser-123, and Ser-177 (Fig. 2A). To analyze whether these amino acids are phosphorylated by Chk1 in vitro, we prepared His-tagged fragments derived from the regulatory domain of Cdc25A wild type and with S75A, S123A, and S177A mutations and subjected them to phosphorylation by GST-Chk1. Fig. 2B shows that the phosphorylation of Cdc25A fragments is markedly decreased in the case of S123A and S177A mutants compared with the wild-type Cdc25A protein fragments. In the Cdc25A-(1–86) fragment where serine 75 is replaced by alanine, phosphorylation is completely abolished. These results suggest that in vitro Cdc25A undergoes phosphorylation by Chk1 on all of the three sites, namely Ser-75, Ser-123, and Ser-177.Fig. 2Chk1 phosphorylates Cdc25A on Ser-75, Ser-123, and Ser-177. A, the structure of human Cdc25A is schematically presented to show the location of catalytic and regulatory domains relative to Ser-75, Ser-123, and Ser-177 matching to the consensus Chk1 phosphorylation motif RXXR. B, His-Cdc25A WT (wt) and the mutant fragments were incubated with GST-Chk1.

One candidate serine residue is serine 75. Therefore, His6-Cdc25A wild type or the His6-Cdc25A S75A mutant was phosphorylated by GST-Chk1 digested first with trypsin followed by chymotrypsin. A comparison of phosphopeptide maps prepared from these samples showed that the two predominant phosphopeptides marked with arrows are missing from the map of the 32P-labeled Cdc25A S75A mutant, suggesting that Chk1 directly phosphorylates Cdc25A on Ser-75 in vitro (Fig. 3A). To analyze whether serine 75 is a site that is also phosphorylated in vivo, U2OS cells were transfected with HA-tagged Cdc25A or Cdc25A S75A proteins and then UV-treated at 100 J/m2. [32P]-HA-Cdc25A and [32P]-HA-Cdc25A S75A proteins were isolated by immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibodies and digested with trypsin followed by chymotrypsin. As seen in Fig. 3B, a phosphopeptide indicated with an arrow was present in two-dimensional maps of wild-type Cdc25A protein but absent in the S75A mutant protein. Taken together, these results suggest that Ser-75 is phosphorylated by Chk1 in vitro and that this site is also phosphorylated in vivo.Fig. 3Cdc25A is phosphorylated on serine75 in vitro and in vivo by Chk1. A, His6-Cdc25A and His6-Cdc25A S75A proteins were phosphorylated by GST-Chk1, separated on SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Radiolabeled Cdc25A proteins were isolated and digested with trypsin followed by chymotrypsin, and peptides were subjected to two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping. The first and second dimensions of separation are indicated. B, HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids encoding HA-Cdc25A and HACdc25A S75A and labeled in vivo using [32P]orthophosphate. HA-tagged Cdc25A was immunoprecipitated from extracts, digested, and analyzed as indicated in A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Stabilization of Cdc25A S75A in Response to UV Irradiation—Recent studies (13Zhao H.

Nature. 2001; 410: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar) show that both human Chk1 and Chk2 kinases phosphorylate Cdc25A at serine 123 and thereby target it for degradation. UV light-induced down-regulation of Cdc25A requires the activation of Chk1 (10Mailand N. Falck J. Lukas C. Syljuasen R.G. Welcker M. Bartek J. Lukas J. Science. 2000; 288: 1425-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the effect of UV irradiation on the stability of the different Cdc25A proteins with mutated Chk1 phosphorylation sites. U2OS cells were transfected with either HA-tagged Cdc25A wild type or the mutant protein S75A, S123A, or S177A and irradiated by UV light or not. Whereas the mutant proteins S123A and S177A were rapidly degraded similar to wild-type Cdc25A, only the S75A mutant was stable (Fig. 4A). To demonstrate that the stabilization is not cell type-specific, we also performed a similar experiment in HeLa cells. Also, in this cell line, the S75A mutant was resistant in response to UV irradiation. To exclude that the stabilization of the Cdc25A S75A mutant is not due to de novo protein synthesis, cells were treated after transfection of the different constructs into U2OS cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide in a time course and followed up to 90 min (Fig. 4B). Immunoblotting with anti-HA antibodies shows that both Cdc25A WT and the Cdc25A S123A were rapidly degraded while the Cdc25A S75A mutant was remarkably stable. Thus, the stabilization of the Cdc25A S75A mutant is not dependent on new protein synthesis. These results suggest that Ser-75 plays an important role in the regulation of Cdc25A stability in response to UV-induced DNA damage. Thus, phosphorylation at Ser-75 may represent a critical step toward initiation of checkpoint response to UV irradiation.Fig. 4Phosphorylation on serine 75 is required for Cdc25A degradation in response to UV-induced DNA damage. A, U2OS cells (upper panel) or HeLa cells (lower panel) were transiently transfected with wild-type HA-Cdc25A, HA-Cdc25A S75A, HA-Cdc25A S123A, or HA-Cdc25A S177A, respectively. Cells were then either irradiated with UV (100 J/m2) or left untreated. Cells were lysed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” resolved on SDS-PAGE, and analyzed for Cdc25A levels in immunoblots. β-Actin was used as loading control. B, U2OS cells were transfected with wild-type HA-Cdc25A, HA-Cdc25A S75A, and HA-Cdc25A S123A, respectively. Cycloheximide (CHX) was added for the times indicated. Cdc25A protein levels were determined as indicated in A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of Cdc25A Degradation on Cyclin E/Cdk2 Kinase Activity—It has previously been shown that UV-induced degradation of Cdc25A also declines the kinase activity of its downstream target cyclin E/Cdk2 (10Mailand N. Falck J. Lukas C. Syljuasen R.G. Welcker M. Bartek J. Lukas J. Science. 2000; 288: 1425-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wished to determine whether stabilization of Cdc25A by mutation of serine 75 to alanine also leads to a stabilization of cyclin E/Cdk2 activity. U2OS cells were transfected with vector alone (mock), HA-Cdc25A wild type, or HA-Cdc25A S75A, respectively. Similar to a study by Mailand et al. (10Mailand N. Falck J. Lukas C. Syljuasen R.G. Welcker M. Bartek J. Lukas J. Science. 2000; 288: 1425-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar), we observed that Cdc25A wild-type proteins and its associated phosphatase activity (not shown) declined within 30 min after exposure to UV. However, the S75A mutant remained stable. The endogenous levels of Chk1 protein were equal in the presence of either HA-Cdc25A WT or HA-Cdc25A S75A. The slower migrating form of Chk1 observed in response to UV treatment is induced by phosphorylation of Chk1 on Ser-345 (5Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar, 6Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). We further found that activation of the Cdc25A downstream target cyclin E/Cdk2 was inhibited in the presence of HA-Cdc25A wild type in response to UV-induced DNA damage (Fig. 5A). This inhibition would then lead to a block of entry into S-phase in response to checkpoint activation. The presence of HA-Cdc25A S75A mutant in the cell, however, causes no inhibition of cyclin E/Cdk2 kinase activity (Fig. 5B). We also found that the protein levels of both Cdk2 or cyclin E were not altered independently whether DNA damage was induced or not. Taken together, these data implicate that DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light leads to a Chk1-dependent phosphorylation of Cdc25A on serine 75 and subsequently to its degradation. Thus, the activation of Cdk2/cyclin E is prevented. The activation of cyclin E/Cdk2 kinase activity would be essential for the onset of DNA replication.Fig. 5UV-induced destruction of Cdc25A stabilizes cyclin E/Cdk2 kinase activity. A, U2OS cells were either mock-transfected or transfected with wild-type HA-Cdc25A or HA-Cdc25A S75A constructs and then irradiated or not with UV (100 J/m2). Extracts were prepared and analyzed for protein levels of Cdc25A or Chk1 (panel a), Cdk2, cyclin E, and cyclin E-associated H1 kinase activity (panel b). B, comparison of cyclin E-dependent kinase activities in U2OS cells expressing HA-Cdc25A wild type or the HA-Cdc25A S75A mutant protein. The results are the mean of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have analyzed the regulation of the human Cdc25A phosphatase in response to UV-induced DNA damage. We report that Cdc25A is phosphorylated on serine 75 following irradiation of cells with UV light, which in turn leads to its degradation. Furthermore, we show that Ser-75 is phosphorylated both in vivo and in vitro by Chk1. It has been reported previously that Cdc25A is phosphorylated on serine 123 by Chk2 kinase in response to IR (18Falck J. Mailand N. Syljuasen R.G. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nature. 2001; 410: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation induces a rapid proteasome-dependent degradation of Cdc25A and subsequent silencing of cyclin E/Cdk2 kinase activity. Interestingly, Cdc25A can also be phosphorylated by Chk1 kinase on serine 123 in vitro and in vivo (13Zhao H. Watkins J.L. Piwnica-Worms H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14795-14800Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems that Chk1 is also a target for the IR-induced S-phase checkpoint. Our findings support a role of Chk1"
https://openalex.org/W2148090249,"In contrast to adult cutaneous wound repair, early gestational fetal cutaneous wounds heal by a process of regeneration, resulting in little or no scarring. Previous studies indicate that down-regulation of HoxB13, a member of the highly conserved family of Hox transcription factors, occurs during fetal scarless wound healing. No down-regulation was noted in adult wounds. Here, we evaluate healing of adult cutaneous wounds in Hoxb13 knockout (KO) mice, hypothesizing that loss of Hoxb13 in adult skin should result in enhanced wound healing. Tensiometry was used to measure the tensile strength of incisional wounds over a 60-day time course; overall, Hoxb13 KO wounds are significantly stronger than wild-type (WT). Histological evaluation of incisional wounds shows that 7-day-old Hoxb13 KO wounds are significantly smaller and that 60-day-old Hoxb13 KO wounds exhibit a more normal collagen architecture compared with WT wounds. We also find that excisional wounds close at a faster rate in Hoxb13 KO mice. Biochemical and histochemical analyses show that Hoxb13 KO skin contains significantly elevated levels of hyaluronan. Because higher levels of hyaluronan and enhanced wound healing are characteristics of fetal skin, we conclude that loss of Hoxb13 produces a more ""fetal-like"" state in adult skin."
https://openalex.org/W1979301883,"The balance and cross-talk between natruretic and antinatruretic hormone receptors plays a critical role in the regulation of renal Na+ homeostasis, which is a major determinant of blood pressure. Dopamine and angiotensin II have antagonistic effects on renal Na+ and water excretion, which involves regulation of the Na+,K+-ATPase activity. Herein we demonstrate that angiotensin II (Ang II) stimulation of AT1 receptors in proximal tubule cells induces the recruitment of Na+,K+-ATPase molecules to the plasmalemma, in a process mediated by protein kinase Cβ and interaction of the Na+,K+-ATPase with adaptor protein 1. Ang II stimulation led to phosphorylation of the α subunit Ser-11 and Ser-18 residues, and substitution of these amino acids with alanine residues completely abolished the Ang II-induced stimulation of Na+,K+-ATPase-mediated Rb+ transport. Thus, for Ang II-dependent stimulation of Na+,K+-ATPase activity, phosphorylation of these serine residues is essential and may constitute a triggering signal for recruitment of Na+,K+-ATPase molecules to the plasma membrane. When cells were treated simultaneously with saturating concentrations of dopamine and Ang II, either activation or inhibition of the Na+,K+-ATPase activity was produced dependent on the intracellular Na+ concentration, which was varied in a very narrow physiological range (9–19 mm). A small increase in intracellular Na+ concentrations induces the recruitment of D1 receptors to the plasma membrane and a reduction in plasma membrane AT1 receptors. Thus, one or more proteins may act as an intracellular Na+ concentration sensor and play a major regulatory role on the effect of hormones that regulate proximal tubule Na+ reabsorption.

Thus, one or more proteins may act as an intracellular Na+ concentration sensor and play a major regulatory role on the effect of hormones that regulate proximal tubule Na+ reabsorption. Sodium excretion by the kidney is a tightly regulated process, and several cardiovascular diseases are usually associated with its abnormal regulation. Variations in salt intake may affect total body Na+ balance and induce a rise in blood pressure unless homeostasis is maintained (1Guyton A.C. Science. 1991; 252: 1813-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). The balance between natruretic and antinatruretic hormones plays a critical role in the regulation of renal Na+ transport and excretion (1Guyton A.C.

In proximal tubules, where more than 70% of filtered Na+ reabsorption occurs, the interplay between the antagonistic actions of the natruretic dopamine (DA) 1The abbreviations used are: DA, dopamine; Ang II, angiotensin II; NKA, Na+,K+-ATPase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; [Na+]i, intracellular Na+ concentration; OK, opossum kidney; PKC, protein kinase C; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; AP, adaptor protein; sulfo-NHS, N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide.1The abbreviations used are: DA, dopamine; Ang II, angiotensin II; NKA, Na+,K+-ATPase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; [Na+]i, intracellular Na+ concentration; OK, opossum kidney; PKC, protein kinase C; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; AP, adaptor protein; sulfo-NHS, N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide. and the anti-natruretic angiotensin II (Ang II) represents an important mechanism to regulate renal Na+ and water excretion (3Aperia A. Hotback U. Syren M.L. Svensson L.B. Fryckstedt J. Greengard P. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 436-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). During salt deprivation, enhanced Ang II production and AT1 receptor expression in proximal tubules increase Na+ and water reabsorption (4Cheng H.F. Becker B.N. Burns K.D. Harris R.C. J. Clin.

Conversely, Na+ load causes increased production of DA and DA receptor expression in proximal tubule epithelial cells promoting renal Na+ and water excretion (8Hegde S.S. Jadhav A.L. Lokhandwala M.F. Hypertension. 1989; 13: 828-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 9Bertorello A.M. Katz A.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F743-F755PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hussain T. Lokhandwala M.F.

Ang II antagonizes the natriuretic response elicited by DA stimulation of D1 receptors (3Aperia A. Hotback U. Syren M.L. Svensson L.B. Fryckstedt J. Greengard P.

Ther. 1991; 256: 486-491PubMed Google Scholar), and DA opposes the Ang II-induced stimulation of Na+ uptake in proximal tubules (13Sheikch-Hamad D. Wang Y.P. Jo O.D. Yanagawa N. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F737-F743PubMed Google Scholar, 14Cheng H.F. Becker B.N. Harris R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore, the balanced action of DA and Ang II has a primary impact on proximal tubule Na+ reabsorption. The process that determines the balance of hormonal action, and how DA can reduce proximal tubule Na+ reabsorption in the presence of saturating concentrations of the antagonistic Ang II, are some of the mechanistic aspects that remain to be elucidated. Although some insights regarding the regulation by DA have been reported by us and other researchers, the molecular mechanism by which Ang II regulates the activity of the proteins involved in proximal tubule Na+ reabsorption is still unknown (10Hussain T. Lokhandwala M.F. Hypertension. 1998; 32: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 11Aperia A.C. Annu. Rev.

In this study, we have investigated the cellular mechanisms beyond the antagonistic actions of Ang II and DA and how these mechanisms are dependent on changes in intracellular Na+ concentration.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Cells culture supplies were purchased from Invitrogen and Hyclone Laboratories (Logan, UT).

OK cells were maintained at 37 °C (10% CO2) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum and antibiotics (DMEM-10).

Briefly, annealed plasmid and oligonucleotides were subjected to PCR amplification with Pfu polymerase, followed by restriction of the original wild type template with DpnI.

Selection for cells expressing the highest level of rodent α subunit was achieved by exposing the cells to a medium containing 3 μm ouabain. Because the endogenous Na+ pump of OK cells is completely inhibited by this concentration of ouabain (22Pedemonte C.H. Pressley T.A. Cinelli A.R. Lokhandwala M.F. Mol.

Resistant colonies were expanded and maintained in DMEM-10 containing 3 μm ouabain. Experiments were performed with a mix of at least 20 independent clones for each cell line. The NKA of mock-transfected cells (vector alone, vector plus liposomes, or liposomes alone) had the same activity and sensitivity to ouabain as non-transfected host cells.Determination of Rb + Transport—Measurements of NKA-mediated transport by Rb+ uptake were performed with attached cells as described previously (22Pedemonte C.H. Pressley T.A. Cinelli A.R. Lokhandwala M.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 88-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 23Pedemonte C.H. Pressley T.A. Lokhandwala M.F. Cinelli A.R. J. Membr.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9884-9892Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transferred to serum-free DMEM containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (DMEM-HEPES), and either 3 μm or 5 mm ouabain (incubation medium). All treatments and determinations were performed at 23 °C. Then, a trace amount of [86Rb+]RbCl was added to the cell medium. After 20 min, cells were washed three times with ice-cold saline and dissolved with SDS, and accumulated radioactivity was determined. NKA-mediated Rb+ transport was calculated from the difference in tracer uptake between samples incubated in 3 μm and 5 mm ouabain. The ouabain-insensitive Rb+ transport (measured in the presence of 5 mm ouabain) was 25–30% of the total Rb+ transport measured. In some experiments, cells were treated with hormones, activators, and inhibitors before the Rb+ transport determination. The concentrations used and the time of treatment are described in the respective figures.Protein Biotin Labeling to Separate the Plasma Membrane Pool of NKA—The experiments were performed with OK cells expressing the rodent wild type α1 subunit and grown to 80–90% confluence in six-well plates. After treatment of the cells with Ang II, the medium was changed to ice-cold 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin. After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, the cells were scraped in immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, pH 7.3) containing a protease inhibitor mixture, frozen in liquid nitrogen, thawed rapidly, probe-sonicated twice on ice-water bath, and frozen-thawed again. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatant was separated, and protein concentration was determined. Aliquots containing equal amounts of protein were transferred to clean tubes, and 1% Triton X-100 and 0.2% SDS were added. Anti-α1 antibody was added, and the suspension was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with end-over-end shaking and overnight with protein A/G-agarose, which had been pre-washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and once with immunoprecipitation buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. After separation, the agarose beads were washed four times with immunoprecipitation buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% SDS and once with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and finally resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. Electrophoresis, Western blot analysis with extravidin-peroxide conjugate, and densitometric analysis were performed as described previously (24Efendiev R. Bertorello A.M. Pressley T.A. Rousselot M. Féraille E. Pedemonte C.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9884-9892Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).Determinations of DA and Ang II Receptors at the Plasma Membrane—The experiments were the same as described for the determination of plasma membrane NKA α1, except that antibodies against D1 and AT1 were used. Other details are described in the respective figures.Monitoring Ionic Changes in OK Cells—Optical determinations of the intracellular Na+ concentration ([Na+]i) with the Na+-binding benzofuran-isophthalate were performed as described previously (22Pedemonte C.H. Pressley T.A. Cinelli A.R. Lokhandwala M.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 88-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 23Pedemonte C.H. Pressley T.A. Lokhandwala M.F. Cinelli A.R. J. Membr.

Chem. 2002; 277: 11489-11496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Based on the changes in intracellular Na+ produced by different concentrations of monensin, the following equation was deduced: [Na+]i = (2.2 ± 0.1)·103 [monensin] + (8.9 ± 0.7) mm (26Efendiev R.

This equation was used to calculate the [Na+]i that corresponds to the concentration of monensin in the cell medium.Determination of AP1 and AP2 Co-precipitation with NKA α1—After treatment with Ang II, OK cells were dissolved, and the NKA α1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-α1 antibody. The precipitated material was separated by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to a piece of polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. This was assayed by Western blot analysis with anti-AP1 antibody. After development and scanning, the membrane was stripped and tested successively with anti-AP2 and anti-α1 antibodies. The protein bands were developed and scanned. Each experiment was repeated three times.Other Determinations and Data Analysis—Unless indicated otherwise, all treatments were performed at 23 °C. Reagents were dissolved in water, except for DA, which was dissolved in 0.5% sodium metabisulfite, PMA in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide, and monensin in 95% ethanol. For each assay, equal amounts of solvents were added to control and test samples. However, these amounts were minimal, and they did not appreciably change the ouabain-sensitive NKA-mediated Rb+ transport. Determinations of protein concentration and immunoprecipitation of NKA were performed as described previously (24Efendiev R. Bertorello A.M. Pressley T.A. Rousselot M. Féraille E. Pedemonte C.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9884-9892Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Comparisons between groups were performed by either Student's t test for unpaired data or analysis of variance, as indicated in the figure legends.RESULTSAng II Has a Biphasic Action on Proximal Tubule NKA— Picomolar concentrations of the hormone stimulate, whereas micromolar concentrations inhibit proximal tubule Na+ reabsorption (7Harris P.J. Hiranyachattada S. Antoine A.M. Walker L. Reilly A.M. Eitle E. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 1996; 23: S112-S118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Féraille E. Doucet A. Physiol.

A similar effect was described for the Ang II-induced activation of proximal tubule NKA (3Aperia A. Hotback U. Syren M.L. Svensson L.B. Fryckstedt J. Greengard P. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 436-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 28Bharatula M. Hussain T. Lokandwala M.F. Clin. Exp. Hypertens. [A]. 1998; 20: 465-480Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Importantly, under physiological conditions, only stimulating picomolar concentrations of Ang II are produced (18Féraille E. Doucet A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 345-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). We observed that treatment of OK cells with Ang II induced a concentration-dependent increase in Rb+ transport, and a maximal activation was achieved with 1 pm Ang II (Fig. 1A). The basal Rb+ transport was 7.6 ± 0.9 nmol/mg/min, and it was stimulated to a maximum of 10.6 ± 0.5 nmol/mg/min by 1 pm Ang II. Higher picomolar concentrations of Ang II resulted in lower stimulation of Rb+ transport (Fig. 1A). As reported by other researchers (7Harris P.J. Hiranyachattada S. Antoine A.M. Walker L. Reilly A.M. Eitle E. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 1996; 23: S112-S118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Féraille E. Doucet A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 345-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 27Harris P.J. Young J.A. Pflugers Arch. 1977; 367: 295-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), we also observed that micromolar concentrations of Ang II inhibited Rb+ transport (data not shown). At all tested picomolar concentrations of Ang II, activation of NKA was prevented by addition to the cell medium of 10 nm of the PKCβ inhibitor LY333531 (Fig. 1A). This inhibitor had no effect on the basal NKA-mediated Rb+ transport by itself. At the concentration used (10 nm), LY333531 is a very specific inhibitor of the β-isoforms of PKC (29Ishii H. Jirousek M.R. Koya K. Takagi C. Xia P. Clermont A. Bursell S.E. Kern T.W. Ballas L.M. Heath W.F. Stranum L.E. Feener E.P. King G.L. Science. 1996; 272: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar, 30Kowluru R.A. Jirousek M.R. Stranum L. Farid N. Engerman R.L. Kern R.S.

Therefore, Ang II induces the stimulation of NKA activity via activation of PKCβ.On the basis of pharmacological studies, the effects of Ang II on Na+ and fluid transport were attributed to AT1 receptors (32Quan A. Baum M. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1998; 275: F74-F78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Wong P.S. Johns E.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 124: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, Fig. 1B shows that the AT1 receptor antagonist candesartan (34Zhuo J.L. Imig J.D. Hammond T.G. Orengo S. Benes E. Navar L.G. Hypertension. 2002; 39: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) antagonized, in a concentration-dependent manner, the NKA stimulatory effect of a maximally effective dose (1 pm) of Ang II. In the absence of Ang II, candesartan had no effect on the basal Rb+ transport. Therefore, Ang II acting through AT1 receptors induced the stimulation of OK cell NKA-mediated Rb+ transport.Treatment of the cells with either 1 pm Ang II or 1 μm PMA produced about the same level of stimulation of Rb+ transport (Fig. 2A). This level of NKA activation was not further increased when cells were treated simultaneously with PMA and Ang II. The fact that the stimulatory effects of PMA and Ang II on Rb+ transport were not additive (PMA, 34.6 ± 7.5%; Ang II, 32.2 ± 4.5%; PMA plus Ang II, 36.8 ± 7.5%) suggests that PMA and Ang II share a common signaling pathway to activate the NKA. Consistent with this conclusion, we have demonstrated previously that PMA-induced activation of NKA is also mediated by the β-isoform of PKC (35Efendiev R. Bertorello A.M. Pedemonte C.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A also shows that 0.1 μm staurosporine prevented the stimulation of Rb+ transport by either PMA or Ang II. At the concentration of 0.1 μm, staurosporine inhibits all of the classic and novel PKC isoforms but not the atypical PKCζ (29Ishii H. Jirousek M.R. Koya K. Takagi C. Xia P. Clermont A. Bursell S.E.

FASEB J. 1997; 11: 649-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar).Fig. 2A, the stimulatory effects of Ang II and PMA on NKA-mediated Rb+ transport are not additive. Cells were treated with 1 μm PMA and/or 1 pm Ang II for 10 min before the Rb+ transport assay. When indicated, cells were treated with 0.1 μm staurosporine for 30 min. The percentage of change for each experimental condition was calculated with respect to a control in the absence of PMA and/or Ang II. *, p < 0.05 with respect to control. B, Ang II induces phosphorylation of NKA α1 Ser-11 and Ser-18 residues. OK cells stably transfected with the rodent α1 subunit wild type and the S11A and S18A mutants were treated with 1 pm Ang II for 10 min. NKA α1 was immunoprecipitated, and the phosphorylation level was determined using an anti-phosphoserine antibody. Representative Western blots with anti-phosphoserine (Ph-Ser) and anti-α1 (NKAα) antibodies are shown in the upper panel. The ratio of phosphorylation level (as determined in Ph-Ser) to protein (as determined in NKAα) was calculated for each experimental condition and presented in the lower panel as a percentage change of Ang II-induced phosphorylation with respect to a non-treated wild type control (WT). *, p < 0.05 with respect to the increase of phosphorylation produced by Ang II in the wild type α1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Ang II Induces Phosphorylation of the NKA α Subunit—Ang II induces a significant increase in the phosphorylation level of NKA α subunit (Fig. 2B). As α1 Ser-11 and Ser-18 are targets for phosphorylation by PKC (15Pedemonte C.H. Bertorello A.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 36Feschenko M.S.

The basic level (without Ang II) of α1 phosphorylation was not significantly different between the mutants and wild type α subunits (Fig. 2B). Ang II induced an increased phosphorylation of S11A and S18A α1 mutants, but the final level of phosphorylation was lower in either mutant than in wild type α1 (Fig. 2B). Taking into consideration the variations inherent to these measurements, the sum of the levels of phosphorylation in Ser-11 and Ser-18 approximately corresponds to the level of phosphorylation in wild type α1. Therefore, Ang II treatment induced the phosphorylation of both Ser-11 and Ser-18 in NKA α1.α1 Ser-11 and Ser-18 Are Essential for Ang II-induced Stimulation of NKA-mediated Rb + Transport—Activation of NKA by Ang II was not observed in cells expressing a truncated α1 in which the first 26 NH2-terminal amino acids of α1 were eliminated (Δ1–26; see Fig. 3A). To further characterize α1 amino acids involved in Ang II activation of NKA, experiments were performed in cells expressing the α1 S11A and S18A mutants. The basal ouabain-sensitive Rb+ transport was the same in cells transfected with wild type and mutant rodent α1 cDNAs (Fig. 3A). In cells expressing the rodent wild type α1, treatment with Ang II resulted in increased levels of ouabain-sensitive Rb+ transport. However, substitution of either Ser-11 or Ser-18 with alanine residues (S11A and S18A) greatly impaired the stimulation of Rb+ transport (Fig. 3A). The same results were observed with PMA (Fig. 3A). Because none of the mutations altered the basal Rb+ transport measured in the absence of either Ang II or PMA, the results illustrated in Fig. 3A suggest that either S11A or S18A mutations have affected specifically the mechanism of NKA activation and not the intrinsic mechanism of NKA activity. We have demonstrated previously that the effect of PMA was specific and mediated by PKC and that 4α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, a phorbol ester that does not stimulate PKC, had no effect on the level of ouabain-sensitive Rb+ transport (22Pedemonte C.H.

Rb+ transport mediated by NKA was determined in OK cells expressing the wild type and S11A, S18A, and Δ1–26 mutants of α1. S11A and S18A indicate substitutions by alanine residues of α1 Ser-11 and Ser-18. Δ1–26 represents a mutant in which amino acids 1–26 of the mature α1 subunit were deleted. The percentage of change in Rb+ transport for each condition was calculated with respect to a control in the absence of either Ang II or PMA. *, p < 0.05 with respect to control.

PML stimulates p53 activity by recruiting it to nuclear foci termed PML nuclear bodies. In contrast, MDM2 inhibits p53 by promoting its degradation. To date, neither a physical nor functional relationship between PML and MDM2 has been described. In this study, we report an in vivo and in vitro interaction between PML and MDM2 which is independent of p53. Two separate regions of PML are recognized which can interact with MDM2. The C-terminal half of PML, encoded by residues 300–633, can interact with the central region of MDM2 which includes the MDM2 acidic domain. In addition, PML amino acids 1–200, which encode the RING-finger and most of the B box zinc binding motifs, can interact with the C-terminal, RING-finger containing region of MDM2. Interestingly, PML mutants in which sumoylation at lysine 160 was inhibited displayed an increased association with MDM2, suggesting that sumoylation at this site may be a determinant of PML-MDM2 binding. Coexpression with MDM2 caused a redistribution of PML from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and this required the PML N terminus and the MDM2 RING-finger domain. These results suggest that interaction between the PML N terminus and MDM2 C terminus can promote PML nuclear exclusion. Wild-type MDM2 inhibited the ability of PML to stimulate the transcriptional activity of a GAL4-CBP fusion protein.

Wild-type PML is a tumor suppressor and ubiquitously expressed nuclear phosphoprotein. The PML gene was originally identified as a result of a reciprocal translocation t(15:17) associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia (1de The H. Lavau C. Marchio A. Chomienne C. Degos L. Dejean A.

Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 769-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The most striking feature of wild-type PML is its localization to distinct nuclear foci that have been termed PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), Kremer bodies, ND10 or PODs (for PML oncogenic domains). These PML-NBs are multiprotein complexes that are 0.1–0.2 μm in diameter, and cells typically contain 10–30 PML-NBs/nucleus, although their number and size can vary during the cell cycle (6Koken M.H. Linares-Cruz G. Quignon F. Viron A. Chelbi-Alix M.K. Sobczak-Thepot J. Juhlin L. Degos L. Calvo F. de The H. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1315-1324PubMed Google Scholar, 7Everett R.D. Lomonte P.

Reibel C. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 8: 3171-3182Crossref Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Current models suggest that sequestration of normal PML by PML-RARα inhibits the growth suppressive activity of PML, whereas sequestration of retinoid X receptor prevents the induction of differentiation (5Pandolfi P.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 769-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Inhibition of both of these pathways may be necessary for leukemogenesis.The PML protein contains well characterized zinc binding domains in its N-terminal half, including a RING-finger adjacent to two cysteine/histidine-rich motifs known as B boxes. These domains, together with an α-helical coiled-coil domain, comprise a conserved motif known as RBCC (12Jensen K. Shiels C. Freemont P.S. Oncogene. 2001; 49: 7223-7233Crossref Scopus (380) Google Scholar). PML is covalently modified by SUMO-1, a small ubiquitin-like polypeptide also known as sentrin-1, UBL-1, or PIC-1 (13Boddy M.N. Howe K. Etkin L.D. Solomon E. Freemont P.S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 971-982PubMed Google Scholar). Like ubiquitin, SUMO-1 is linked covalently to lysine residues on PML and other target proteins in an ATP-dependent manner (14Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7243-7249Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, SUMO-1 modification seems to modulate the localization of its target proteins rather than induce their degradation. Three major sites for SUMO-1 modification were identified in PML: Lys-65 in the RING-finger, Lys-160 in the first B box, and Lys-490 in the nuclear localization signal (15Kamitani T. Kito K.

Sumoylation of PML is essential for formation of PML-NBs and for its ability to recruit NB-associated proteins (17Muller S. Matunis M.J. Dejean A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 18Zhong S. Hu P. Ye T.Z. Stan R. Ellis N.A. Pandolfi P.P. Oncogene. 1999; 56: 7941-7947Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Sumoylation was also thought to be required for PML-dependent growth suppression. However, this latter hypothesis was challenged by a recent study in which a mutant PML deficient in sumoylation maintained its ability to inhibit growth when overexpressed (19Bischof O. Kirsh O. Pearson M. Itahana K. Pelicci P.G. Dejean A. EMBO J. 2002; 13: 3358-3369Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar).The mechanisms by which PML functions as a tumor suppressor and inhibits growth have not been fully clarified. Mice with a targeted disruption of the PML locus (PML–/–) display an increased incidence of carcinomas after treatment with tumor-promoting agents (20Wang Z.G. Delva L. Gaboli M. Rivi R. Giorgio M. Cordon-Cardo C. Grosveld F. Pandolfi P.P. Science. 1998; 279: 1547-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Further, cells derived from PML–/– mice are resistant to apoptosis in response to various apoptotic stimuli (21Wang Z.G. Ruggero D. Ronchetti S. Zhong S. Gaboli M. Rivi R. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These results suggest that PML plays a central role in apoptosis signaling. A relationship between PML and p53 was suggested by the finding that p53 could interact directly with PML and was recruited by PML into PML-NBs (22Fogal V. Gostissa M. Sandy P. Zacchi P. Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Pandolfi P.P. Will H. Schneider C. Del Sal G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6185-6195Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have shown that PML corecruits both p53 and CBP/p300 to PML-NBs. CBP/p300 then promotes the acetylation of p53, which increases p53 DNA binding affinity and thus leads to an activation of p53-responsive genes (23Pearson M. Carbone R. Sebastiani C. Cioce M. Fagioli M. Saito S. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Minucci S. Pandolfi P.P. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 2000; 406: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar, 24Ferbeyre G. de Stanchina E. Querido E. Baptiste N. Prives C. Lowe S.W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2015-2027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Perhaps the most compelling evidence that links the PML and p53 growth-suppressive pathways comes from studies of oncogene-induced senescence. In these studies, p53 activity was measured in PML+/+ and PML–/– cells infected with retroviruses expressing an activated ras oncogene (Ras V12). Ras V12 expression in PML+/+ cells resulted in the activation of p53, recruitment of p53 into PML-NBs, and the induction of premature senescence. In contrast, p53 was neither activated nor recruited into PML-NBs in PML–/– cells, and the cells were resistant to ras-induced senescence (23Pearson M. Carbone R. Sebastiani C. Cioce M. Fagioli M. Saito S. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Minucci S. Pandolfi P.P. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 2000; 406: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar, 24Ferbeyre G. de Stanchina E. Querido E. Baptiste N. Prives C. Lowe S.W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2015-2027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies provide strong evidence that PML is required for the efficient activation of p53 in response to aberrant oncogene signaling.p53 levels and activity are controlled in large part by MDM2, the product of a p53-inducible gene. MDM2 binds to the N terminus of p53 and inhibits the activity of p53 as a transcription factor (25Momand J. Zambetti G.P. Olson D. George D. Levine A.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1237-1245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2776) Google Scholar, 26Oliner J.D. Kinzler K.W. Meltzer P.S. George D. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1992; 358: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar). Importantly, MDM2 binding also promotes the ubiquitination of p53 and its subsequent degradation by the proteasome, as well as the export of p53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (27Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3658) Google Scholar, 28Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H.

Maki C.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 9: 569-573Crossref Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Insofar as PML and MDM2 have opposing effects on p53 activity, it is of interest to investigate the functional relationship between PML and MDM2. However, to date neither a physical nor functional interaction between PML and MDM2 has been described. The current report demonstrates an in vivo and in vitro interaction between PML and MDM2 which can occur independent of p53. Mapping studies indicate that PML and MDM2 can interact through at least two separate protein regions and that these interactions can affect both the localization and activity of PML.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid DNAs—FLAG-tagged PML expression DNA was obtained from Zhi-Min Yuan (Harvard School of Public Health). HA-tagged PML was generated from this clone by PCR. The 3′-primer for PCR was the SP6 primer (Promega), and the 5′-primer was 5′-GCGAATTCACCATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCTGAGCCTGCACCCGCCCG-3′.

DNAs encoding wild-type MDM2 and MDM2 Δ217–246 were obtained from Steve Grossman (Dana Farber Cancer Institute). FLAG-tagged MDM2 (2–202), (100–304) and (301–488) were generated by PCR using wild-type MDM2 DNA as a template. For MDM2 (301–488) the 5′-primer was 5′-CCGGGATCCCCAAAGAAGAAGAGGAAGGACTATTGGAAATGCACTTCATGC-3′, and the 3′-primer was 5′-CCGTCTAGATCAAGTTAGCACAATCATTTGAATTGG-3′. The resulting PCR products were digested with BamHI and XbaI and cloned downstream and in-frame with the FLAG epitope in pCDNA3.1. MDM2 (301–488) contains the SV40 large-T antigen NLS encoded within the 5′-primer. For MDM2 (2–202) the 5′-primer was 5′-CCGGGATCCTGCAATACCAACATGTCTGTACC-3′, and the 3′-primer was 5′-CCGGAATTCTCATATTACACACAGAGCCAGGC-3′. For MDM2 (100–304) the 5′-primer was 5′-CCGGGATCCTATACCATGATCTACAGGAACTTGG-3′, and the 3′-primer was 5′-CCGGAATTCTCATTTCCAATAGTCAGCTAAGG-3′. The resulting PCR products were digested with BamHI and EcoRI and cloned downstream and in-frame with the FLAG epitope in pCDNA3.1. MDM2 (6–339) was obtained from Arnold Levine.Tissue Culture, Immunoblots, Immunoprecipitation—Human osteosarcoma cell lines Saos-2 cells (p53-null) and U2OS (p53 wild-type), and 35-2 cells (murine p53 and MDM2 double knockout) were grown in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin. Transfections in Saos-2 and U2OS cells were done using the calcium phosphate method in 35-mm dishes when the cells were ∼80% confluent. 16–20 h after addition of the DNA precipitate, cells were washed twice with minimum essential medium minus serum and refed with minimum essential medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell extracts were prepared 8–10 h later. Transfections in 35-2 cells were done using FuGENE-6 (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunoblot analysis and coimmunoprecipitations, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin). The scraped cells were lysed on ice for 30 min with occasional light vortexing, followed by a 15-min centrifugation to remove cellular debris. Protein extracts were then either immunoprecipitated or resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a PolyScreen polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Antibodies used for immunoblotting were the anti-HA monoclonal antibody (HA.11 from Babco), an anti-MDM2 monoclonal antibody (SMP-14 from Santa Cruz), or an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M5 from Sigma). For immunoprecipitations, 300 μg of transfected cell extract was immunoprecipitated with 0.6 μg of the anti-HA polyclonal antibody Y-11 (from Santa Cruz) or 0.2 μg of anti-MDM2 (SMP-14). To detect sumoylated PML species, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 500 μl of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholic acid), and then sonicated for 10 pulses (setting 5, 50% output) using a Branson-450 sonifier. Lysates were centrifuged for 15 min prior to analysis to remove cellular debris.Immunofluorescence Staining—For immunofluorescence staining, cells were plated on glass coverslips and transfected, washed, and refed as described above. 24 h after transfection, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1 mm CaCl2 and1mm MgCl2 and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C. Paraformaldehyde was then replaced with 50 mm NH4Cl for 5 min, and cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 plus 0.2% bovine serum albumin. PML staining was carried out using the anti-HA monoclonal antibody HA.11 (Babco) as the primary antibody and rhodamine red-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Jackson Labs) as the secondary antibody. MDM2 staining was carried out using the anti-MDM2 polyclonal antibody N-20 (Santa Cruz) as the primary antibody, and either 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody, or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson Labs) as the secondary antibody. Specimens were then examined under a fluorescent microscope.GST Fusion Protein Production—GST-tagged PML wild-type DNA was generated by PCR using HA-PML wild-type as a template. The 3′-primer for PCR was 5′-GGCGCGGCCGCCTCACCAGGAGAACCCACTTTCATTG-3′, and the 5′-primer was 5′-CCGGGATCCGAGCCTGCACCCGCCCGATCTCCG-3′. The resulting PCR product was digested with BamHI and NotI restriction enzymes and cloned into the corresponding sites of pGEX-4T-3. GST-tagged PML K160R DNA was generated by PCR using the same primers but HA-PML K160R as a template. DNAs encoding GST alone or GST-PML were used to transform BL-21 bacterial cells, and transformed cells were grown at 37 °C until reaching log phase. GST protein expression was induced by incubation in 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-galactopyranoside for 3 h. To purify the GST proteins, cells were lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl), and the resulting lysate was incubated for 12 h at 4 °C with glutathione-Sepharose beads. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed with lysis buffer. For MDM2 binding, the GST-tagged proteins bound to beads were incubated with MDM2 protein in 300 μl of lysis buffer for 5–6 h. Unbound MDM2 protein was removed by five washes (1 ml each) with lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling for 10 min in 1 × loading buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and examined by immunoblot analysis with the anti-MDM2 antibody SMP-14.Expression and Isolation of MDM2 from Insect Cells—DNA encoding FLAG-tagged MDM2 that was either wild-type, lacked amino acids 217–246 (MDM2 Δp300BD), or lacked the C-terminal RING domain between residues 443 and 491 (MDM2 ΔCT) was cloned into a baculovirus expression system and used for expression in insect cells. MDM2 protein was isolated by passing insect cell lysate over a column of Sepharose beads conjugated to an anti-FLAG antibody. Bound proteins were washed several times and eluted with a peptide encoding the FLAG epitope.RESULTSPML protein levels increase upon exposure of cells to interferons (IFNs) through direct transcriptional activation of the PML gene. To test for an in vivo interaction between PML and MDM2, H1299 cells (p53-null) were exposed to IFN-γ for 48 h to induce endogenous PML expression, and the cells were then examined by immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy with antibodies against MDM2 and PML. These studies revealed colocalization between the endogenous PML and MDM2 proteins in IFN-γ–treated H1299 cells (Fig. 1A). Because H1299 cells lack p53 expression, these results suggest that MDM2 and PML can form an endogenous complex, either directly or indirectly, in the absence of p53. We also attempted to coimmunoprecipitate PML and MDM2 from IFN-γ-treated H1299 cells (not shown). However, we have been unable to immunoprecipitate large amounts of endogenous PML using our normal cell lysis conditions because the PML protein is insoluble under these conditions. We can solubilize PML under relatively harsh lysis conditions (high detergent), but these conditions are denaturing and therefore destroy any putative PML-MDM2 interactions. To examine the PML-MDM2 interaction further, Saos-2 cells (p53-null) were transfected with DNAs encoding MDM2 and epitope-tagged (HA-tagged) PML. Cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody and examined by immunoblotting with an antibody against MDM2. As shown in Fig. 1B, MDM2 coimmunoprecipitated with HA-PML in Saos-2 cells, again demonstrating that MDM2 and PML can interact in the absence of p53. To test the possibility that MDM2 and PML may interact directly, wild-type PML protein fused to GST was generated in bacteria, purified on glutathione-agarose beads, and mixed with partially purified, recombinant MDM2 protein produced in insect cells. Association between PML and MDM2 was then assessed in GST pull-down assays. As shown in Fig. 1C, wild-type (wt) MDM2 formed a complex with GST-PML wt, whereas no complex was observed between MDM2 and the GST protein alone. These results indicate that MDM2 and PML can interact with each other and suggest that this may be a direct interaction. An MDM2 protein lacking the C-terminal amino acids 443–491 (MDM2 ΔCT) also formed a complex with GST-PML wt but not with the GST protein control, indicating that this in vitro binding between PML and MDM2 does not require the MDM2 C terminus.We next wished to identify the regions of PML and MDM2 required for their interaction. PML contains several well characterized protein domains, including a RING-finger, two B boxes, and an α-helical coiled-coil (Fig. 2A) (for review, see Ref. 12Jensen K. Shiels C. Freemont P.S. Oncogene. 2001; 49: 7223-7233Crossref Scopus (380) Google Scholar). To map the regions of PML required for MDM2 binding, N-terminal deletion mutants of HA-PML were expressed with MDM2 in transiently transfected cells. Cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody and examined by immunoblotting with an antibody against MDM2. As shown in Fig. 2B, MDM2 coimmunoprecipitated with HA-tagged wild-type PML, consistent with the results of Fig. 1. Interestingly, deletion mutants of PML lacking 100 or 200 amino acids from the N terminus displayed a much stronger interaction with MDM2 compared with wild-type PML, whereas a PML deletion mutant lacking 400 amino acids from the N terminus was unable to bind MDM2. Similar binding results were obtained in the reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation, which involved first immunoprecipitating with an anti-MDM2 antibody, followed by immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody (Fig. 2C). In these studies, wild-type PML again displayed relatively weak binding to MDM2, whereas mutants lacking 100, 200, or 300 amino acids from the PML N terminus displayed stronger association with MDM2, and a mutant lacking 400 amino acids from the N terminus failed to bind MDM2. These results indicate that the C-terminal region of PML between residues 300 and 633 can form a complex with MDM2 and suggest that sequences within the N terminus of PML may be inhibitory to this PML-MDM2 complex formation.Fig. 2Binding of PML deletion mutants to MDM2.

B, U2OS cells were transfected with DNAs encoding wild-type MDM2 and either wild-type PML or the indicated deletion mutant of PML. PML protein was precipitated with an anti-HA antibody, and the immunoprecipitates (IP) were examined with an antibody against MDM2 (top panel).

Sumoylation is mediated by the sumo-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 and requires interaction between Ubc9 and the RING-finger domain within the first 100 amino acids of PML (16Duprez E. Saurin A.J. Desterro J.M. Lallemand-Breitenbach V. Howe K. Boddy M.N. Solomon E. de The H. Hay R.T. Freemont P.S. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 381-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that PML mutants lacking the first 100 amino acids displayed an increased association with MDM2 suggested that sumoylation of PML may be inhibitory to PML-MDM2 binding. To investigate this possibility, PML mutants were generated in which each sumo site lysine was converted to arginine either singly or in combination, and association between these mutants and MDM2 was monitored by coimmunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig. 3A, MDM2 coimmunoprecipitated with wild-type PML to a relatively small extent in cells transiently expressing both proteins. MDM2 also coimmunoprecipitated with"

To determine whether the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) mediates glucose regulation of mRNA expression, we treated primary cultured adipocytes for 18 h with insulin (25 ng/ml) and either glucose (20 mm) or glucosamine (2 mm). A ribonuclease protection assay was used to quantitate mRNA levels for FAS, ACC, and glycerol-3-P dehydrogenase (GPDH). Treatment with insulin and various concentrations of d-glucose increased mRNA levels for FAS (280%), ACC (93%), and GPDH (633%) in a dose-dependent manner (ED50 8–16 mm). Mannose similarly elevated mRNA levels, but galactose and fructose were only partially effective. l-glucose had no effect. Omission of glutamine from the culture medium markedly diminished the stimulatory effect of glucose on mRNA expression. Since glutamine is a crucial amide donor in hexosamine biosynthesis, we interpret these data to mean that glucose flux through the HBP is linked to regulation of lipogenesis through control of gene expression. Further evidence for hexosamine regulation was obtained using glucosamine, which is readily transported into adipocytes where it directly enters the HBP. Glucosamine was 15–30 times more potent than glucose in elevating FAS, ACC, and GPDH mRNA levels (ED50 ∼0.5 mm). In summary: 1) GPDH, FAS, and ACC mRNA levels are upregulated by glucose; 2) glucose-induced up-regulation requires glutamine; and 3) mRNA levels for lipogenic enzymes are up-regulated by glucosamine. Hyperglycemia is the hallmark of diabetes mellitus and leads to insulin resistance, impaired glucose metabolism, and dyslipidemia. We postulate that disease pathophysiology may have a common underlying factor, excessive glucose flux through the HBP.

Girard J. Ferre P. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1996; 36: 199-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar); however, the signaling pathway mediating glucose-induced mRNA regulation is poorly understood. One hypothesis is that glucose-6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) is the primary metabolite responsible for glucose-induced mRNA regulation. This has prompted several investigators to focus on glucose-6-phosphate-utilizing pathways (1Foufelle F. Girard J. Ferre P. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1996; 36: 199-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Products of the glycolysis pathway have been excluded as regulatory metabolites because pyruvate and lactate failed to up-regulate lipogenic enzymes (1Foufelle F. Girard J. Ferre P. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1996; 36: 199-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 2Foufelle F. Gouhot B. Pégorier J.-P. Perdereau D. Girard J. Ferré P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20543-20546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Intermediates of the pentose phosphate pathway have been proposed to mediate glucose regulation of gene expression based on the ability of xylitol to enter the pentose pathway and regulate pyruvate kinase and S14 genes in liver (3Doiron B.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Despite these studies, there is no clear mechanistic rationale for how Glc-6-P, or formation of glucose metabolites, could directly regulate mRNA levels The current studies were initiated to examine the hypothesis that the glucose-mediated up-regulation of lipogenic enzymes in isolated adipocytes is mediated by glucose flux through the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) and the subsequent regulation of lipogenic enzyme mRNA levels. The rationale for exploring this hypothesis is based on the 1991 discovery that glucose-induced desensitization of the glucose transport system is linked to hexosamine biosynthesis (5Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Marshall S. Garvey W.T. Traxinger R.R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3031-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). At that time, it was proposed that the HBP serves as a glucose sensor coupled to a metabolic transducer that regulates the insulin-responsive glucose transport system. Subsequent studies have expanded upon the idea of hexosamine-mediated regulation by implicating the HBP in the regulation of genes for pyruvate kinase, leptin, transforming growth factor α (TGFα), and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) (7Traxinger R.R.

Materials—Sources of materials were as follows: Porcine insulin, Sigma; collagenase, Worthington Biochemicals, Freehold, NJ; bovine serum albumin (CRG-7), Armour Company, Kankakee, IL.; penicillin-streptomycin and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), In-vitrogen; RNAzol B, Cinna/Biotecx, Friendswood, TX. All other reagents were from Sigma or Fisher, unless otherwise specified. Preparation of Sterile Isolated Adipocytes—Isolated adipocytes were obtained from the epididymal fat pads of male Sprague-Dawley rats (180–225 g) by collagenase digestion (15Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (16Marshall S. Garvey W.T. Geller M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6376-6384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, minced tissue (1–2 g) in 4 ml of DMEM containing collagenase (1 mg/ml) and albumin (40 mg/ml) was shaken in 4-oz sterile polypropylene containers at 37 °C for 45 min. At the end of the digestion period, cells were filtered through nylon mesh (1000 μm) and then washed three times in Hepes-buffered balanced saline solution (HBSS). HBSS contains 25 mm Hepes, 120 mm NaCl, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 5.4 mm KCl, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1% BSA, pH 7.6. After washing, adipocytes were resuspended as a 10% (w/v) solution in HBSS (final concentration about 5 × 105 cells/ml). Primary Culture of Adipocytes and Extraction of Total RNA—Adipocytes were maintained in primary culture as described previously (16Marshall S. Garvey W.T. Geller M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6376-6384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, adipocytes were added to sterile 250-ml polypropylene bottles or 50-ml polypropylene tubes and diluted to a final volume of 20 or 60 ml (∼2 × 105 cells/ml) in sterile incubation medium consisting of glucose-free DMEM supplemented with 1 mm pyruvate and 1% BSA (SIM0) or HBSS. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 18 h with various combinations of glucose (20 mm), insulin (25 ng/ml), glutamine (16 mm), or glucosamine (2 mm) unless otherwise indicated. After treatment, adipocytes were washed three times with HBSS. During the final wash, the infranatant was aspirated, and total RNA was extracted from adipocytes by adding 500 μl of RNAzol B, 200 μl of chloroform, and 200 μl of 10 mm Tris pH 7.4. After centrifugation for 15 min at 4 °C, the upper aqueous phase containing the RNA was precipitated at –20 °C for 90 min with 0.3 m sodium acetate and isopropanol. The RNA pellets were washed with 75% ethanol and then resuspended in 10 mm Tris pH 7.4. RNA was quantified by measuring A 260 and deemed pure (A 260:A 280 ∼2). RNA was stored at –80 °C prior to use in the ribonuclease protection assay. Plasmids—S2 Ribosomal protein (S2) cDNA from bp 121 to 906 (GenBank™ accession number X57432) was amplified from rat adipocyte cDNA using GeneAmp PCR kit with amplitaq (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and primers (Keystone BIOSOURCE, Foster City, CA) designed to facilitate subsequent cloning into the AscI/PacI sites of pJMR1 (17Marshall S. Duong T. Orbus R.J. Rumberger J.M. Okuyama R. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 314: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The sequences of the primers used were 5′-actggcgcgcccttaggggccgcggtcgtgg-3′ and 5′-aaattaattaattatgtggtagccactgctggagcct-3′. Cytosolic glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH; EC 1.1.1.8) cDNA from bp 1 to 1050 (GenBank™ accession number AB002558) was similarly cloned. The sequences of the GPDH primers were 5′-cagggcgcgccatggctggcaagaaagtctgcat-3′ and 5′-attttaattaatcacatgtgttccgggtggttctgc-3′. The hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL; EC 3.1.1.3) plasmid was a gift from Dr. Allan Green (Bassett Research Institute, Cooperstown, NY). The pCRII-FAS and pCRII-ACC plasmids were gifts from Sankyo Ltd. (Shinagawa, Japan). Generation of Nucleic Acid Probes—Portions of the various cDNAs (above) were subcloned into either pT7/T3-18 vector (Ambion, Austin, TX) or pJMR1. The resulting plasmids were subsequently linearized, gel-purified with GENECLEAN (Bio 101, La Jolla, CA), and then used as a template for T7 RNA polymerase-mediated in vitro transcription. The MAXIscript in vitro transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) and [α-32P]UTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were used to prepare antisense RNA probes that protect S2 mRNA (bases 734–906 of GenBank™ accession number X57432), FAS (bases 7340–7612 of GenBank™ accession number X14175), GPDH (bases 1–299 of GenBank™ accession number AB002558), ACC (bases 6827–7004 of GenBank™ accession number J03808), and HSL (bases 1–337 of GenBank™ accession number X51415). RNA probes were purified over a NucTrap push column (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) before use in the ribonuclease protection assay. Ribonuclease Protection Assay—The ribonuclease protection assay (RPA) was performed using the Ambion RPA II kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) following the manufacturer's instructions. Multiplexed antisense RNA probes (25–50,000 cpm/probe) were hybridized with 5–8 μg of total adipocyte RNA for 16 h at 42 °C. After RNase digestion, the protected probes were resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide-urea gel in Tris-Borate-EDTA buffer and then quantified using the Storm 840 phosphorimaging system (Molecular Dynamics, Piscataway, NJ). Northern Analysis—20 μg of total RNA was separated on a 1% (w/v) agarose-formaldehyde gel. RNA was transferred to nylon membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) and then cross-linked using the UV stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene). Hybridizations were performed with radiolabeled cDNA probe for5hat60 °C in ExpressHyb buffer (Clontech) containing 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. After washing the blot, hybridization signals were visualized using the Storm 840 phosphorimaging system. Each blot was stripped and reprobed with an S2 cDNA probe to control for equal loading of RNA. Glucose-induced Up-regulation of FAS and GPDH mRNA Levels—Primary cultured adipocytes were treated for 6–30hin glucose-free DMEM containing 25 ng/ml insulin (control) or insulin plus 20 mm glucose. Total RNA was extracted and used for quantitation of mRNA levels using a ribonuclease protection assay. Maximal changes in mRNA levels for FAS, GPDH, and ACC were observed between 12 and 24 h with little glucose regulation seen at 6 h (data not shown). Based on these preliminary studies, we decided to quantify mRNA levels at 18 h in all subsequent experiments. As can be seen by Northern analysis in Fig. 1A, glucose treatment resulted in up-regulation of mRNA levels for both FAS and GPDH. Since S2 mRNA levels were unchanged with glucose treatment, it can serve as an internal control. The ribonuclease protection assay was used as a quantitative method to measure FAS, GPDH, and S2 mRNA levels (Fig. 1B). Radiolabeled antisense probes for GPDH (299 bases), FAS (273 bases), and S2 (172 bases) were prepared using in vitro transcription and were then multiplexed in a hybridization reaction with RNA from control or glucose-treated adipocytes. After normalization to S2 mRNA levels, glucose treatment for 18 h resulted in a 241% increase in FAS mRNA levels and a 576% increase in GPDH mRNA levels. It is important to note that the addition of the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D (200 nm) completely blocked glucose-induced up-regulation of mRNA levels (data not shown). All subsequent measurements of mRNA levels were performed using the RPA. Fig. 1, C and D, depicts experiments in which adipocytes were treated for 18 h with 25 ng/ml insulin plus various sugars (all at a concentration of 20 mm). d-glucose effectively increased both FAS (Fig. 1C) and GPDH mRNA levels (Fig. 1D), whereas l-glucose had no effect. This indicates sugar specificity and eliminates osmolarity changes as a causative factor. Mannose was nearly as effective as glucose in elevating mRNA levels of FAS and GPDH, whereas fructose and galactose had much smaller effects. The differential effects of the various sugars on FAS and GPDH mRNA levels are most likely due to differences in uptake and metabolism of these sugars in isolated adipocytes. To better quantify glucose-induced up-regulation of mRNA levels, we incubated adipocytes for 18 h in glucose-free DMEM containing insulin and various concentrations of glucose (Fig. 2). Glucose treatment resulted in a dose-dependent increase in mRNA levels for both FAS (ED50 15.5 mm) and GPDH (ED50 7.5 mm). Maximal concentrations of glucose (40 mm) increased FAS mRNA >3-fold and elevated GPDH mRNA about 9-fold. The fact that FAS and GPDH mRNA levels were relatively unchanged in the hypoglycemic to euglycemic range (1–5 mm glucose) indicates that the glucose regulation of mRNA levels is not a consequence of glucose deprivation but rather is a result of hyperglycemia. We also examined the effect of xylitol on FAS and GPDH mRNA levels (Fig. 2 insets) because glucose flux into the pentose phosphate shunt has been postulated to mediate up-regulation of various glucose-responsive genes (3Doiron B. Cuif M.H. Chen R.H. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5321-5324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 4Leclerc I. Kahn A. Doiron B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Xylitol is known to directly enter the pentose phosphate shunt through the intracellular formation of xyulose-5-phosphate. Because xylitol treatment had no effect on either FAS or GPDH mRNA levels in insulin-treated cells, we conclude that the pentose phosphate shunt does not contribute significantly to glucose up-regulation of FAS and GPDH mRNA in isolated adipocytes. Facilitative Role of Insulin in Glucose-induced Up-regulation of mRNA Levels—Glucose regulation of gene expression can be either insulin-dependent or insulin-independent. Examples of insulin-dependent regulation include glucose-mediated up-regulation of FAS mRNA in liver (through activation of glucokinase); insulin-independent regulation is typified by glucose regulation of stearoyl-CoA desaturase mRNA in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in the absence of insulin (1Foufelle F. Girard J. Ferre P. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1996; 36: 199-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 18Jones B.H. Standridge M.K. Claycombe K.J. Smith P.J. Moustaid-Moussa N. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To examine the role of insulin in glucose-induced up-regulation of GPDH and FAS mRNA in isolated adipocytes, we treated cells for 18 h in HBSS in the absence or presence of 25 ng/ml insulin (Fig. 3). When compared with controls (no additions), insulin alone down-regulated FAS and GPDH mRNA levels. In contrast, treatment with insulin and glucose resulted in a glucose dose-dependent up-regulation of FAS and GPDH mRNA levels (Fig. 3). Since insulin is known to stimulate glucose transport in adipocytes by >10-fold, we believe that insulin facilitates glucose action by enhancing glucose uptake into cells. Glutamine Potentiates Glucose-induced Up-regulation of FAS and GPDH mRNA Levels—Glucose-induced insulin resistance in isolated adipocytes is mediated by glucose flux through the HBP (5Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence supporting this conclusion includes the finding that desensitization requires the presence of three components in the medium, glutamine, glucose, and insulin (5Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Marshall S. Garvey W.T. Traxinger R.R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3031-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Glutamine was necessary because it serves as an essential amide donor for the conversion of glucose to hexosamine products. Specifically, glutamine-fructose-6-P amidotransferase (the first and rate-limiting enzyme of the hexosamine pathway) requires glutamine for conversion of fructose-6-P to glucosamine-6-P. To investigate whether the HBP mediates glucose-induced up-regulation of FAS and GPDH mRNA, we incubated adipocytes with 25 ng/ml insulin and 20 mm glucose in the absence or presence of 16 mm glutamine. As shown in Fig. 3, inclusion of glutamine potentiated the glucose-induced increase of FAS and GPDH mRNA. This indicates that formation of hexosamine products underlies glucose regulation of FAS and GPDH mRNA levels. Ability of Glucosamine to Up-regulate FAS and GPDH mRNA Levels—To obtain additional evidence for hexosamine-mediated regulation of FAS and GPDH mRNA, we treated adipocytes for 18 h with 25 ng/ml insulin and various concentrations of glucosamine. Glucosamine was used because it is readily transported into adipocytes through the glucose transport system where it directly enters the hexosamine pathway at the level of glucosamine-6-phosphate (5Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data depicted in Fig. 4 show that glucosamine treatment resulted in a dose-dependent up-regulation of mRNA levels for FAS (ED50 ∼0.45 mm) and GPDH (ED50 ∼0.75 mm). Glucosamine was ∼15–30 times more potent than glucose in inducing FAS and GPDH mRNA levels. Regulation of Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase mRNA Levels by Glucose and Glucosamine—To explore whether the HBP may control other mRNAs involved in lipid metabolism, we evaluated the regulation of mRNA for the lipogenic enzyme ACC and the lipolytic enzyme HSL. As depicted in Fig. 5A, ACC mRNA levels were up-regulated by co-treatment with insulin and glucose, but the extent of up-regulation was significantly enhanced by the inclusion of glutamine. Treatment with insulin and glucosamine up-regulated ACC mRNA levels to a greater extent than glucose, suggesting that ACC represents another lipogenic enzyme under the control of the HBP. Considered together, these data suggest that ACC mRNA levels are also regulated through the HBP. As shown in Fig. 5, B and C, HSL mRNA levels were not up-regulated by glucose, glutamine, or glucosamine treatment. In fact, HSL mRNA levels were actually down-regulated with insulin treatment. Since HSL is a lipolytic enzyme, these data highlight the specificity of hexosamine action on lipogenic enzymes in isolated rat adipocytes. When food sources are readily available and consumed in excess, adipose tissue plays a major role in converting ingested metabolic fuel into lipids. Stored lipids then serve as an essential energy source during periods of famine. Facilitating fuel storage at the cellular level is a regulatory system in adipose and liver tissue that entails up-regulation of mRNA levels for lipogenic enzymes such as FAS and ACC. An important finding of the current study is that GPDH mRNA is also up-regulated by glucose in isolated adipocytes. This fits well with the established role of GPDH in forming the glycerol backbone of triglycerides (by catalyzing biosynthesis of glycerol-3-phosphate within the glycolysis pathway). The finding that GPDH mRNA is regulated by glucose in adipocytes is consistent with earlier observations that GPDH activity and mRNA levels are upregulated in the hyperinsulinemic obese Zucker rat (19Dugail I. Quignard-Boulangé A. Le Liepvre X. Ardouin B. Lavau M. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 607-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and agrees with studies showing that GPDH activity is nutritionally regulated in rat jejunum and liver (20Stifel F.B. Herman R.H. Rosensweig N.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 184: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although we found that glucose is more effective than fructose in elevating GPDH mRNA levels in adipocytes (Fig. 1), Stifel et al. (20Stifel F.B. Herman R.H. Rosensweig N.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 184: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) reported that fructose was more potent than glucose in activating GPDH activity in other tissues. Whether these divergent findings represent differences in the regulation of GPDH among tissues or tissue-specific differences in the uptake and metabolism of various sugars requires clarification. Although previous studies have established that intracellular glucose metabolism results in up-regulation of lipogenic enzyme mRNA levels, the cascade of metabolic events leading to up-regulation remains obscure. Formation of glucose-6-phosphate has been postulated to regulate lipogenic mRNA levels (1Foufelle F. Girard J. Ferre P. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1996; 36: 199-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 2Foufelle F. Gouhot B. Pégorier J.-P. Perdereau D. Girard J. Ferré P. J. Biol.

Girard J. Ferre P. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1996; 36: 199-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Another idea is that xyulose-5-phosphate functions as a metabolite regulator of mRNA levels (1Foufelle F. Girard J. Ferre P. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1996; 36: 199-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 2Foufelle F. Gouhot B. Pégorier J.-P. Perdereau D. Girard J. Ferré P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 26341-26346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To better understand the mechanism(s) underlying glucose-mediated regulation of lipogenic enzyme mRNA levels, we used isolated adipocytes maintained in primary culture as our model system so that we could investigate mRNA regulation under defined in vitro conditions. When adipocytes were treated for 18 h with 25 ng/ml insulin and various concentrations of d-glucose, we observed increases in mRNA levels for FAS (280%), ACC (93%), and GPDH (633%). The glucose ED50 values were ∼15 mm for FAS and ∼7 mm for GPDH. Sugar specificity studies revealed that mannose elevated mRNA levels almost as effectively as glucose, whereas galactose and fructose were only partially effective. l-glucose, which is a non-metabolizable analog of d-glucose, had no effect on mRNA levels. Insulin was required for the expression of glucose-induced up-regulation of mRNA levels. However, insulin itself appears to play no direct role in mRNA up-regulation since treatment of adipocytes with insulin alone (in the absence of glucose) resulted in an actual decrease in FAS and GPDH mRNA levels (Fig. 3). Since insulin enhances the rate of glucose uptake in isolated adipocytes by >10-fold, it is likely that insulin is required to facilitate glucose entry into cells. Two lines of evidence support the hypothesis that mRNA regulation of lipogenic enzymes is coordinately regulated by enhanced glucose flux through the HBP. First, we found that glutamine significantly augmented the stimulatory effect of glucose on mRNA expression of FAS and GPDH (Fig. 3). This is consistent with the idea that intracellular formation of hexosamine products requires a supply of both glucose (in the form of Fru-6-P) and glutamine (as a cofactor for glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase in the transfer of an amide group to Fru-6-P). The primary role of insulin in this scheme is to facilitate the uptake of glucose (about 10–20-fold). The second line of evidence for hexosamine involvement entailed the use of glucosamine, which has previously been shown to enter adipocytes through the glucose transport system (5Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) where it directly enters the hexosamine pathway distal to glutamine: fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (through formation of GlcN-6-P). In insulin-treated adipocytes, glucosamine was 15–30 times more potent than glucose in up-regulating FAS and GPDH mRNA levels. Considered together, these studies lead to the conclusion that the HBP plays an integral role in lipid metabolism by up-regulating mRNA levels for various lipogenic enzymes. In contrast, mRNA levels of the lipolytic enzyme HSL were unaffected by treatment of isolated rat adipocytes with glucose or glucosamine for 18 h. It should be mentioned that in human adipocytes and cultured 3T3-F442A adipocytes, prolonged glucose treatment for 48 h has been shown to culminate in up-regulation of HSL (23Smih F. Rouet P. Lucas S. Mairal A. Sengenes C. Lafontan M. Vaulont S. Casado M. Langin D. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 24Raclot T. Dauzats M. Langin D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 510-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The reason for the discrepancy between primary cultured rat adipocytes and other adipocyte model systems remains unclear. Up-regulation of mRNA levels can result from transcriptional activation and/or changes in mRNA stability. Although the exact mechanism(s) by which glucose regulates lipogenic mRNAs in primary cultured adipocytes remains to be elucidated, changes in both transcription rates and mRNA stability may be involved (25Clarke S.D. J. Anim. Sci. 1993; 71: 1957-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 26Foufelle F. Gouhot D. Perdereau D. Girard J. Ferre P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 893-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A glucose-inducible mRNA-binding protein has previously been shown to stabilize FAS mRNA levels in HepG2 cells (27Li Q. Chua M.S. Semenkovich C.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E577-E585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whether the hexosamine pathway regulates mRNA-binding proteins in rat adipocytes is unclear. Since we found that the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D completely inhibits the glucose-induced up-regulation of lipogenic mRNA levels in primary cultured adipocytes, this suggests that transcriptional regulation plays a prominent role in regulating mRNA levels. This conclusion fits well with previous studies implicating the hexosamine pathway in the transcriptional regulation of pyruvate kinase (7Traxinger R.R. Marshall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9718-9723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (13Kolm-Litty V. Sauer U. Nerlich A. Lehmann R. Schleicher E.D. J. Clin.

Hexosamine-mediated regulation of lipogenic enzymes at the level of transcription becomes even more compelling given that glucosamine was also found to be nearly six times more potent than glucose at inducing the glucose response element of TGFα (10McClain D.A. Paterson A.J. Roos M.D. Wei X. Kudlow J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8150-8154Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The model depicted in Fig. 6 schematically integrates the current data on regulation of mRNA levels with previous studies on glucose-induced insulin resistance (28Marshall S. Curr. Opin. Endocrinology Diabetes. 2002; 9: 160-167Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 29Marshall S. Rumberger J. Walker M. Hutler P. Rizza R.A. The Diabetes Annual/13. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York2000: 97-112Google Scholar). Upon entering adipocytes, glucose is phosphorylated to Glc-6-P and rapidly converted to Fru-6-P. From these two metabolites, glucose fluxes into various pathways involved in glucose storage and utilization. These include the glycogen biosynthesis pathway, the pentose phosphate shunt, and the glycolysis/lipogenesis pathway. Although these three pathways represent the major routes traversed by the vast majority of glucose, a small percentage of incoming glucose (about 1–2%) is routed into the HBP. It was originally proposed that the HBP serves as a glucose sensor coupled to a biological transduction system that functions to reduce glucose uptake as the rate of glucose transport exceeds the capacity of the major glucose-utilizing pathways (5Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In other words, the enhanced flux of glucose through the HBP culminates in insulin resistance of the glucose transport system. Based on the current study, it appears likely that the regulatory role of the HBP also encompasses control of lipid storage through gene regulation of lipogenesis enzyme mRNA levels. This coordinated response to hyperglycemia makes sense in that overall glucose uptake would be reduced (by the development of insulin resistance), and excess incoming glucose would be stored as triglycerides (through the enhancement of lipogenesis). Under hyperglycemic conditions, as occurs after eating, the body mounts a normal, adaptive response to re-establish glucose homeostasis. However, under prolonged hyperglycemic conditions, as occurs in diabetes mellitus, cellular adaptation to excessive glucose uptake may lead to many of the pathophysiological consequences of diabetes, including insulin resistance, impaired glucose metabolism, and dyslipidemia. Accordingly, it can be hypothesized that prolonged hyperglycemia and excessive glucose flux through the HBP may play a role in the etiology and pathogenesis of diabetes. Therefore, pharmacological intervention targeting the HBP may ameliorate hyperglycemia and/or hyperlipidemia and possibly prevent or delay the onset of diabetic complications that accompany disease progression."

Biol. 1995; 15: 2101-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) do not strongly support the hypothesis that sc-mtTFB is homologous to bacterial σ factor. The Xenopus equivalent (xl-mtTFB) having this activity has been characterized (11Bogenhagen D.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1983; 258: 14025-14033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, mtTFBs acts as a specific factor enabling the RNA polymerase to locate the appropriate start sites. Our knowledge about the transcription of human mtDNA, mainly based on the in vitro transcription system, is somewhat different and depends on a transcription factor (h-TFAM; formerly referred to as h-mtTFA) containing two HMG boxes (2Shadel G.S. Clayton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16083-16086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Fisher R.P. Clayton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11330-11338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Parisi M.A. Clayton D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 965-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The yeast homologue sc-mtTFA is an abundant protein composed almost entirely of two HMG boxes separated by a rather short linker region (18Fisher R.P. Lisowsky T. Parisi M.A. Clayton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3358-3367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). sc-mtTFA was originally described as ABF2, which could bind to the replication origin of yeast nuclear DNA but was later found to be localized in mitochondria (19Diffley J.F. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7864-7868Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Disruption of the ABF2 gene led to a loss of respiratory competence and mtDNA when cells were grown in the presence of glucose. Because expression of h-TFAM in the yeast abf2 strain improved the phenotype, a potential functional homology of h-TFAM to sc-mtTFA was confirmed (20Parisi M.A. Xu B. Clayton D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1951-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the role of sc-mtTFA in mtDNA transcription remains unclear since in vitro it can hardly activate transcription. By replacing the various regions of h-TFAM with the corresponding parts of the yeast homologue, the linker region and the C-terminal tail abbreviated in sc-mtTFA were shown to be significant for the recognition and transcriptional activation of the human mtDNA (21Dairaghi D.J. Shadel G.S. Clayton D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 11-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Mouse (22Larsson N.-G. Garman J.D. Oldfors A. Barsh G.S. Clayton D.A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and Xenopus mtTFA (25Bogenhagen D.F. Romanelli M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2917-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (will be referred to as m- and xl-TFAM hereafter, respectively) have been cloned and shown to have the long linker region and the C-terminal tail as h-TFAM does. xl-TFAM stimulates transcription in vitro up to 10-fold for the H-strand, but only ∼3-fold for the L-strand (23Antoshechkin I. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7032-7042Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For better understanding of the function of TFAM, the evolutionary variation of the control region of mtDNA may be worthwhile to be considered. This is the region between the genes for tRNAPro (tRNAGlu in birds) and tRNAPhe containing the H-strand replication origin, the promoters for transcription activation, and H- and L-strand start sites (24Clayton D.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 453-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). In Xenopus, the distance of the transcription start sites of the L- and H-strands is rather short, with 50 bp (25Bogenhagen D.F. Romanelli M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2917-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) versus 150 bp in the case of human (26Montoya J. Christianson T. Levens D. Rabinowitz M. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7195-7199Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Lower dependence of Xenopus mtDNA transcription on xl-TFAM compared with the human system can be due to this difference of the control region. From this aspect, chicken mtDNA provides an opportunity to expand our knowledge of mtDNA transcription in higher vertebrates. The chicken mitochondrial genome has a characteristic organization of the genes compared with other vertebrates (27Desjardins P. Morais R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 599-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar), and its H- and L-strand sites have no separating base pair (28L'Abbé D. Duhaime J.-F. Lang B.F. Morais R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10844-10850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have cloned and determined the cDNA sequence encoding chicken (c-)TFAM, which is more similar to xl-TFAM than to the human and mouse proteins. Targeted disruption of both c-tfam alleles in a chicken cell line DT40 showed that TFAM is essential for proliferation of this cell line. In cells with heterozygous disrupted c-tfam, mtDNA and its transcripts were reduced. Expression of exogenous wild type c-tfam cDNA in those cells increased mtDNA up to 4-fold in a dosage-dependent manner, whereas its transcripts increased only marginally. We thus show that c-TFAM is important for maintenance of the mtDNA copy number. Cell Culture, Gene Transfection, and Screening—DT40 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were split to 1 × 105/ml every third day. For DNA transfection, 107 cells were suspended in 0.5 ml of PBS containing 30 μg of linearized plasmid and electroporated with a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) at 550 V and 25 microfarads. The cells were transferred to 20 ml of fresh medium and incubated for 24 h. After resuspending in 100 ml of medium containing either 30 μg/ml mycophenolic acid or 2 mg/ml G418, cells were divided into five 96-well plates and cultured for 7–10 days. Drug-resistant colonies were transferred to 50 ml of T-flasks for preparation of genomic DNA to confirm heterozygous disruption of tfam alleles by Southern blotting. For screening of DT40 clones having both tfam alleles disrupted, the colonies with heterozygous disruption were subjected to another round of transfection/screening cycle using a medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml uridine and 110 μg/ml sodium pyruvate. To obtain the colony expressing exogenous c-tfam cDNA and its deletion mutants under the background of heterozygous tfam allele disruption, plasmids having either of these sequences and neomycin-resistance gene (neo r) in tandem, both under the control of β-actin promoters, were transfected to the cells with either tfam allele targeted by MPA, and the G418-resistant colonies were selected. The colonies positive to exogenous c-TFAM were further selected by Western blotting of the cell lysate. Screening and Sequencing of cDNA and Genomic DNA Clones—A chicken cDNA library in which mRNAs isolated from the day 5 embryos were reverse-transcribed using oligo-dT primers, and double-stranded cDNA were inserted into EcoRI-XhoI sites of λZAPII vector was a gift from Dr. Atsushi Kuroiwa. ∼1 × 107 phages were screened using the SalI fragment of h-tfam cDNA (17Parisi M.A. Clayton D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 965-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) as a probe in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. After hybridization (16 h, 53 °C), filters were washed 3 times with 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at room temperature and once with 0.2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 53 °C for 30 min and exposed to x-ray film (Fuji). Because the cDNA clones isolated from this library were found to encode only nuclear c-TFAM (GenBank™ accession number AB21166), the 5′ sequence encoding the N terminus of mt c-TFAM (GenBank™ accession number AB059657) was obtained by reverse transcription of RNA extracted from DT40 cells with SMART rapid amplification of cDNA ends cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) using a primer of 5′-CACCAGCTCCAAGCTGTTCAG-3′. The amplified fragment was sequenced with a primer of 5′-GCTGGTTGTCCCTCAGGAAG-3′. For transient expression of the nuclear or mt c-tfam cDNA tagged with a c-Myc sequence at 3′ end, either cDNA clone was amplified with 3′ primer of 5′-GCGGGATCCTTACAAGTCTTCTTCAGAAATAAGCTTTTGTTCTTCTTCAGATTTTTTCAGCTTCAGTTTCGCCAG-3′ paired with 5′-primer of 5′-CCCggTCgACACCGCGGTGGCGGCCGCCATGGGGCGGAGGGGCGGGCTG-3′ or 5′-GGCGGTCGACTCCGTGGGGAGGGTGGGCTGCGGCATG-3′, respectively. The amplified fragments were inserted downstream of β-actin promoter after SalI/BamHI digestion. A DT40 genomic DNA library with Sau3A partial digests (15–25 kb) inserted into the XhoI site of a λFIXII vector was a gift from Dr. Tatsuo Nakayama. ∼1 × 106 phages were screened at a hybridization temperature of 65 °C using a c-tfam cDNA clone as a probe. Genomic DNA clones were analyzed by restriction endonuclease mapping and Southern blot analysis. Pertinent restriction fragments were subcloned into pBluescript. DNA was sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide method on an Applied Biosystems (model 377) DNA sequencer. Preparation of Anti-chicken TFAM Antiserum—To express c-TFAM in Escherichia coli, the SacI-HindIII fragment of c-tfam cDNA coding for amino acid residues Ala-42 to Leu-248 was cloned into the SacI-HindIII sites of pQE31 (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). A bacterial culture harboring the plasmid was grown in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and expression was induced by 0.1 mm isopropil-1-thio-β-d-galactoside. The N-terminal His6 tag was utilized for purification of the product on a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid column according to the manufacture's instructions. New Zealand White rabbits were immunized by intramuscular injections of 0.3 mg of purified protein in complete Freund's adjuvant and boosted once with 0.3 mg of protein in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Sera were collected 4 weeks after initial injection. Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy—DT40 cells were grown on coverslips. After labeling with MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions, cells were fixed with methanol/water/acetic acid (95:4:1, v/v) for 15 min, permeabilized with cold methanol for 10 min, incubated with anti-c-TFAM antiserum or anti-c-Myc rabbit polyclonal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:500 or 1:100, respectively, in buffer A (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h, washed 4 times with PBS, incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Cappel; 1:100 dilution in buffer A) for 1 h, washed 4 times with PBS, and mounted in 90% (v/v) glycerol containing 2 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2 m 1,4-diazabicyclo-(2,2,2)octane. Western Blotting—Cell extracts corresponding to 10 μg of total protein were separated in 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Hybond enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) nitrocellulose (Amersham Biosciences). Filters were preincubated with 5% skim milk in PBS, incubated with anti-c-TFAM (1:500 in buffer A) for 1 h, washed 4 times with buffer A, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h, and washed with buffer A. Protein bands were visualized using the ECL Western blotting reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Chromosome Preparation and in Situ Hybridization—Chromosomal assignment of c-tfam was performed using the direct R-banding fluorescence in situ hybridization method as described (29Matsuda Y. Harada Y.N. Natsuume-Sakai S. Lee K. Shiomi T. Chapman V.M. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1992; 61: 282-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 30Matsuda Y. Chapman V.M. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Mitogen-stimulated splenocytes were cultured at 39 °C and synchronized by a thymidine block, and 5-bromodeoxyuridine was incorporated during the late replication stage for differential replication staining after release of excessive thymidine. R-bands were stained by exposure of Hoechst 33258-stained chromosome slides to UV light. Chromosome slides were heated at 65 °C for 2 h, denatured at 70 °C in 70% formamide in 2× SSC, and dehydrated in a 70, 85, 100% ethanol series at 4 °C. The 15-kb chicken genomic DNA fragment inserted into the SalI site of pBluescript was labeled by nick translation with biotin 16-dUTP (Roche Applied Science), ethanol-precipitated together with chicken whole genomic DNA, salmon sperm DNA, and E. coli tRNA, and denatured at 75 °C in 100% formamide for 10 min. The denatured probe was mixed with an equal volume of hybridization solution to a final concentration of 50% formamide, 2× SSC, 10% dextran sulfate, and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. 20 μl of the solution containing 250 ng of labeled DNA were put on the denatured slide, covered with Parafilm, and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Slides were washed in 50% formamide in 2× SSC at 37 °C for 20 min, and 2× and 1× SSC at room temperature for 20 min. After rinsing in 4× SSC, slides were incubated with Cy2-labeled streptavidin (Amersham Biosciences) at 1:500 dilution in 1% bovine serum albumin, 4× SSC at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing with 4× SSC, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in 4× SSC, and 4× SSC for 10 min each on a shaker, slides were rinsed with 2× SSC and stained with 0.75 μg/ml propidium iodide. Hybridization was visualized by excitation at 450–490 nm (Nikon filter set B-2A) and ∼365 nm (UV-2A), and recorded on Kodak Ektachrome 100 film. Southern Blotting—Genomic DNA was purified from DT40 cells with DNAZOL (Invitrogen). 10 μg of DNA were separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis after digestion with EcoRI, SalI, and/or PstI and transferred to Hybond N+ (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization was performed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5× Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA at 65 °C for 16 h. Filters were washed 3 times with 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min and once with 0.2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 30 min and analyzed with a Fuji BAS 2000 image analyzer. For the screening of DT40 clones, of which tfam was disrupted, a 0.5-kb probe (probe 1 in Fig. 3A) was prepared by amplifying the SalI-EcoRI fragment inserted in pBluescript KS(+) with a paired primer of 5′-TAGTTCCCTTTCTGTCAAAG-3′ and T7 primer and digesting it with EcoRI. For semi-quantification of mtDNA, the EcoRI-StuI fragment of chicken ATPase 6/8 cDNA was used. A 5-kb EcoRI fragment of tfam (probe 2 in Fig. 3A) was used for the normalization of the quantification of mtDNA. Because this probe sequence is localized outside of the targeted region, its signal cannot be affected by the disruption of tfam in DT40 cells. Northern Blotting—Total RNA was extracted by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method (31Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). 10 μg of RNA was separated by 1.5% formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to Hybond N+. Filters were hybridized to 32P-labeled probes in 5× standard saline phosphate -EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution, 50% formaldehyde, 0.1 mg/ml of denatured salmon sperm DNA at 42 °C for 16 h. Filters were washed 3 times with 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at room temperature and once with 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 30 min and analyzed with a Fuji Film BAS 2000 Image Analyzer. Probes for c-tfam, ATPase α, ATPase γ, and ATPase 6/8 mRNAs were individual cDNA clones isolated in our laboratory. Probes for β-actin RNA (5′-ATGGATGATGATATTGCTGC-3′; 5′-TTCATCGTACTCCTGCTTGC-3′), 12 S/16 S rRNA (5′-AAGCTAGGACCCAAACTGG-3′; 5′-GTGAAGAGTTGTGGTCTGTG-3′), and ND6 (NADH dehydrogenase subunit VI) mRNA (5′-CAACCCACGCACAAGCTC-3′; 5′-GTAGCGTCTGTGATAGG-3′) were prepared by reverse transcription-PCR of chicken RNA with primers designed based on the reported sequences. Targeting Vector Construction—As a source of targeting vectors, plasmids with MPA (32Mulligan R.C. Berg P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2072-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar) and neo r (33Buerstedde J.M. Takeda S. Cell. 1991; 67: 179-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) under the control of the chicken β-actin promoter were inserted into pBluescript II. Plasmids were gifts of Dr. Shunichi Takeda. Selection marker genes were sandwiched by a 1.8-kb sequence upstream of exon IM and a 4.6-kb sequence spanning the 3′ terminus of exon II through intron VI as left and right arms, respectively (cf. Fig. 3A). For the left arm insertion, a PstI site of the 1.8-kb SalI-PstI fragment was modified to a SalI site. For the right arm insertion, a BamHI-BamHI fragment was prepared by PCR using paired primers of 5′-CCCGGGATCCCTTCCTGAGGGACAACCAGC-3′ and 5′-CCCGGGATCCCACCTGTGCAGTACTCATCC-3′. Expression Vectors for TFAM Deletion Mutants—Paired c-tfam cDNA fragments that sandwich the domain to be deleted were prepared by PCR so as to have restriction ends of 5′-SalI/blunt-3′ or 5′-blunt/BamHI and were inserted downstream of β-actin promoter by a three-piece ligation technique. The deleted sequences of c-TFAM were Lys-46–Try-112 for the first HMG box, Lys-z13–Val-146 for the linker, Leu-147–Trp-213 for the second HMG box, and Glu-214–Glu-262E for the tail. A series of deletion mutants at the tail was also prepared; Val-218 to Glu-262 for del M, Ser-228 to Glu-262 for del R, Ser-244 to Glu-262 for del G, and Lys-254 to Glu-262 for del A. The vectors for expression of the mutants had neo r under the control of β-actin promoter for the selection of positive colonies. Sequence Analysis—General sequence editing and analysis were performed using MacDNASIS, version 3.7 (Hitachi Software). Similarity searches against the non-redundant GenBank™ data base (June 1999) were done using BLAST 2.0 (34Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). HMG boxes were compared with those of the Pfam data base (version 4.0; Ref. 35Bateman A. Birney E. Durbin R. Eddy S.R. Finn R.D. Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 260-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignments were performed with ClustalW (36Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). Pairwise comparisons were done using the BLOSUM62 matrix and default values for gap penalties. Quantification of the Blot Signals—A Southern blot was analyzed by a Fuji Film BAS 2000 Image Analyzer, and the radioactivity was quantified by determining the photostimulated luminescence count with a Fuji Film Image Gauge, version 3.4. The ECL signal Western blotting was semiquantified with Image ID program (Amersham Biosciences). cDNA Cloning of Nuclear and mt c-TFAMs—Low stringency screening of 1 × 107 independent cDNA clones of mRNAs expressed in the day 5 chicken embryos with h-tfam cDNA probes yielded five selected clones. Partial sequencing and restriction fragment analysis of the inserts showed that they share identical 3′-sequences with different extensions in the 5′ direction. Three clones had the same sequence (AB021166) of 1324 bp, whereas the other two clones contained sequences of 1174 and 1008 bp, respectively. The longest sequence encodes an open reading frame of 792 bp starting with ATG at the fourth base and terminating at TAA at the 769th base to code for a 264-residue amino acid sequence. Neither poly(A)-adding signal nor poly(A) tail was found. Attempts of rapid amplification of cDNA ends (37Frohman M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 340-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) using mRNA extracted from DT40 cells as the template yielded 5′-extended sequence (AB059657) encoding different N-terminal sequence (Fig. 1A), suggesting that chicken cells express two forms of c-TFAM. When these cDNA sequences obtained from the day 5 chicken embryos were transiently expressed in DT40 cells after tagging with the c-Myc sequence at the C terminus, indirect immunofluorescence staining of the cells with anti-c-Myc polyclonal IgG showed localization of the product into the nucleus, whereas the endogenous form in DT40 cells was localized in mitochondria (Fig. 1B; see below). We thus cloned mt and nuclear forms of c-TFAM. For mouse spermatocytes, a testis-specific TFAM isoform resulting from alternative splicing of a different exon IT has been characterized in addition to mt mouse m-TFAM, and this isoform is targeted to the nucleus (22Larsson N.-G. Garman J.D. Oldfors A. Barsh G.S. Clayton D.A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Screening of a DT40 genomic DNA library with the mt c-TFAM cDNA sequence as a probe yielded three overlapping fragments. Analysis of restriction sites and partial sequencing resulted in the exon/intron organization of c-tfam as shown in Fig. 1A. The N-terminal sequence of nuclear c-TFAM is encoded by exon IN, which is directly connected to exon II without insertion of an intron, whereas that of mt c-TFAM is encoded by exon IM and continued to the sequence encoded by exon II by splicing out of the exon IN. Thus, the mechanism of generating the nuclear and mt c-TFAMs is similar to m-tfam, but the exons encoding the mt and nuclear form-specific sequences (exon IN and exon IM) are positioned oppositely. The downstream cDNA sequence is encoded by additional six exons. All exon/intron boundaries had well conserved consensus sequences for splicing both at the 5′- and 3′-end of introns (not shown). Immunostaining of DT40 cells with antiserum prepared against c-TFAM showed staining of mitochondria well overlapping with that of living dye for mitochondria (MitoTracker Red), and no signal was indicated in the nuclear region (Fig. 1C). Sequence Comparison of c-TFAM with xl-, m-, and h-TFAMs—Alignment of the deduced c-TFAM amino acid sequence with those of xl- (23Antoshechkin I. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell.

Garman J.D. Oldfors A. Barsh G.S. Clayton D.A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) TFAMs in Fig. 2A shows an identity of 42, 37, and 40%, respectively. In contrast to h- and m-TFAMs, c-TFAM shares with xl-TFAM the C terminus-extended regions. Its calculated molecular mass (M r = 29,985) is larger than that of h- (M r = 29,097) and m-TFAM (M r = 27,988) but smaller than that of xl-TFAM (M r = 35,501). Its theoretical isoelectric point of 10.7 is comparable with that of Xenopus (pI ∼ 10.2), which is slightly more basic than that of h- and m-TFAMs (pI ∼ 9.7). As do other TFAMs, the chicken sequence contains two HMG boxes separated by a ∼35-amino acid residue linker. Whereas the HMG-box sequences show high correlations between the different species, the closest relationship between c- and xl-TFAMs in the whole sequences is mainly due to the similarities of the C-terminal extensions and the linker region. By replacing the various regions of h-TFAM with the corresponding parts of the yeast homologue, the significance of the linker region and the C-terminal tail for the recognition and transcriptional activation of the human mtDNA promoter has been established (21Dairaghi D.J. Shadel G.S. Clayton D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 11-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (157)"

The full-length cDNA for twitchin from the anterior byssus retractor muscle of the mussel Mytilus was obtained using PCR and 5′rapid amplification of cDNA ends, and its derived amino acid sequence showed a large molecule (∼530 kDa) with a motif arrangement as follows: (Ig)11(IgFn2)2Ig(Fn)3Ig(Fn)2Ig(Fn)3(Ig)2(Fn)2(Ig)2 FnKinase(Ig)4.

Correlation of the phosphorylation state of twitchin, using antibodies specific to D1 and D2, with mechanical properties suggested that phosphorylation of both D1 and D2 is required for relaxation from the catch state. Some molluscan smooth muscles exhibit a mechanical state known as “catch” (1von Uexkull J. Z. Biol. 1919; 58: 305-322Google Scholar, 2Bayliss W.M. Principles of General Physiology. 4th Ed. Longmans, Green and Co., New York1927: 534-540Google Scholar), which is characterized by long term force maintenance with a very low energy requirement (3Bozler E. J.

Catch muscles such as the anterior byssus retractor muscle (ABRM) 1The abbreviations used are: ABRM, anterior byssus retractor muscle; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; MLCK, myosin light chain kinase; MyBP-C, myosin-binding protein C; ECL, enhanced chemiluminescence; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; ASW, artificial seawater; mol P, mol phosphate. of the mussel Mytilus are innervated by cholinergic and serotonergic nerves. Cholinergic excitation gives rise to an increase in intracellular [Ca2+] and force output, but force is maintained in the catch state despite a subsequent decrease in [Ca2+] to near-resting levels (7Ishii N. Simpson A.W.M. Ashley C.C. Science. 1989; 243: 1367-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Serotonergic nerve activation results in rapid relaxation of catch force without any change in intracellular [Ca2+] (7Ishii N. Simpson A.W.M. Ashley C.C. Science. 1989; 243: 1367-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The relaxation is mediated by an increase in cAMP and activation of PKA (8Cole R.A. Twarog B.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1972; 43: 321-336Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 9Achazi R.K. Dolling B. Haakshorst R. Pflugers Arch. 1974; 349: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The central role of PKA in relaxation of catch force led to a series of experiments to identify the protein whose phosphorylation state has such a dramatic effect on regulation of force maintenance in this muscle. Only one protein, having a molecular mass of ∼600 kDa, showed a change in phosphorylation that corresponded to the release of catch force in permeabilized ABRM (10Siegman M.J. Mooers S.U. Li C.

Based on a partial cDNA of the purified isolated protein, it was found to be a homologue of the mini-titin, twitchin (11Siegman M.J. Funabara D. Kinoshita S. Watabe S. Hartshorne D.J. Butler T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5383-5388Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), that is associated with the thick filament (12Vibert P. Edelstein S.M. Castellani L. Elliott B.W. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1993; 14: 598-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which twitchin controls force output seems to reside in the ability of unphosphorylated twitchin to slow the detachment of calcium-free myosin from actin, primarily by slowing the rate of ADP release from attached cross-bridges (13Butler T.M. Mooers S.U. Li C. Narayan S. Siegman M.J. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1904-1914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 14Butler T.M. Narayan S.R. Mooers S.U. Hartshorne D.J. Siegman M.J. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the presence of phosphorylated twitchin, cross-bridge detachment is fast at low intracellular [Ca2+] (14Butler T.M. Narayan S.R. Mooers S.U. Hartshorne D.J. Siegman M.J. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In vitro studies on both native and reconstituted thick filaments from Mytilus also show the primary role that twitchin and its phosphorylation state play in regulation of the catch state (15Yamada A. Yoshio M. Kojima H. Oiwa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6635-6640Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Under in vitro conditions, phosphorylation of the purified twitchin by PKA indicates rapid incorporation of about 2 mol P/mol twitchin and on prolonged incubation the addition of another mol P/mol twitchin (16Funabara D. Kinoshita S. Watabe S. Siegman M.J. Butler T.M. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2087-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). From the proteolytic digests of isolated phosphorylated twitchin two phosphorylation sites were identified. Based on a partial amino acid sequence (from cDNA) one of these sites was located in the C-terminal region of twitchin. The location of the other site was not established, although there was some evidence to suggest it was closer to the N-terminal end of the molecule (16Funabara D. Kinoshita S. Watabe S. Siegman M.J. Butler T.M. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2087-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). An obvious limitation to a further understanding of the mechanism by which twitchin regulates the actin-myosin interaction was the absence of the complete primary structure for molluscan twitchin. In addition, it was not known how phosphorylation of the PKA sites related to the mechanical properties of catch muscle. In this report, the full-length cDNA for Mytilus twitchin was obtained using PCR and 5′-RACE, and its derived amino acid sequence is presented. Two major phosphorylation sites, i.e. D1 and D2 (16Funabara D. Kinoshita S. Watabe S. Siegman M.J. Butler T.M. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2087-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), were located, and both were in linker regions between Ig domains. Correlation of the phosphorylation state of twitchin, using antibodies specific to D1 and D2, with mechanical properties suggested that phosphorylation of both D1 and D2 is required for relaxation from the catch state. Mussels—Live specimens of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis for molecular biology experiments and in vitro phosphorylation of isolated twitchin were purchased from the Tokyo Central Wholesale Market. The ABRM were carefully dissected to avoid any possible contamination with visceral parts, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C until use. ABRM for mechanical and phosphorylation measurements on intact and permeabilized muscles were obtained from Mytilus edulis (Anastasi's Fish Market, Philadelphia, PA) and were isolated as described previously (10Siegman M.J.

Cell Motil. 1997; 18: 655-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). 5′-RACE—Total RNA was prepared from ABRM according to the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (17Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63187) Google Scholar). First strand cDNA was synthesized using a 5′-RACE kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's manual. The sequences of primers used for 5′-RACE are shown in Fig. 1. The starting primers, TWR1, TWR2, and TWR3, were designed from the sequence of the kinase domain of Mytilus twitchin described previously (11Siegman M.J. Funabara D. Kinoshita S. Watabe S. Hartshorne D.J. Butler T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5383-5388Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Other primers were designed from the sequence determined in the previous 5′-RACEs so that sequences overlap at least 100 bp. Totally, 43 primers were designed and used for cDNA cloning to cover the whole open reading frame. Each PCR was carried out as follows: denaturation at 98 °C for 1 s, annealing at 60 °C for 5 s, and polymerization at 72 °C for 15 s using a Z-Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa). This cycle was repeated 30 times without the final extension step. The regions amplified by PCR are shown in Fig. 1. The DNA fragments amplified by PCR were subcloned into a plasmid vector, pT7 Blue (Novagen), and sequencing was performed by using Dye Deoxy terminator cycle sequencing kits with a DNA sequencer model 373S (Applied Biosystems). Structural Analysis of Twitchin Motifs—The deduced amino acid sequence of Mytilus twitchin was analyzed by a Single Modular Architecture Research Tool (SMART) (18Ponting C.P. Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Mechanical Measurements—ABRM were dissected, and measurements of force production were performed under isometric conditions using an apparatus that was described previously (10Siegman M.J. Mooers S.U. Li C. Narayan S. Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Watabe S. Hartshorne D.J. Butler T.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1997; 18: 655-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 13Butler T.M. Mooers S.U.

Cell Motil. 1997; 18: 655-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) alone or with additions of acetylcholine (50 μm) or serotonin (10 μm). Muscles were permeabilized by incubation in 1% Triton X-100 (14Butler T.M. Narayan S.R. Mooers S.U. Hartshorne D.J. Siegman M.J. Biophys.

Muscles were frozen in liquid nitrogen while on the mechanical apparatus, pulverized in frozen 0.5 n HClO4, and following thawing and centrifugation, the protein precipitate was solubilized in SDS sample buffer (16Funabara D. Kinoshita S. Watabe S. Siegman M.J. Butler T.M. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2087-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE—SDS-PAGE was performed using buffer conditions of Laemmli (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar) and a total acrylamide of 5%. Preliminary gels containing the muscle protein samples were run and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and subjected to laser densitometry (Molecular Dynamics) and quantitative analysis (ImageQuant Software; Molecular Dynamics). This allowed adjustment of the protein loading on subsequent gels so that the same amount of twitchin was added for each sample used for immunoblotting. Antibodies, Immunoblotting, and Immunodetection—The antibodies used in this study are those described previously for the D1 and D2 sites in twitchin (16Funabara D. Kinoshita S. Watabe S. Siegman M.J. Butler T.M. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2087-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The anti-D1 and anti-phospho-D2 antibodies were used at dilutions of 14,000 and 500, respectively, for studies on ABRM proteins. Proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride and stained with 0.1% Amido Black. Before antibody treatment, the blot was scanned (Umax), and the relative amounts of twitchin in each lane were determined. Immunodetection was performed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) and Kodak X-OMAT AR imaging film (Eastman Kodak Co.). The film was scanned with a laser densitometer, and the signal was divided by the relative amount of twitchin on the blot. Each blot contained samples, as well as five standards ranging from unphosphorylated twitchin (from a permeabilized ABRM incubated in a rigor solution for ∼25 min) to maximally phosphorylated twitchin (from a permeabilized muscle incubated in ATP and cAMP). The phosphorylation level in the sample was determined by comparison to the ECL/protein versus phosphorylation level in the standards. Phosphopeptide Mapping—Isolated twitchin (16Funabara D. Kinoshita S. Watabe S. Siegman M.J. Butler T.M. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2087-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of PKA at 25 °C for 10 min in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm [γ-32P]ATP. This was followed by complete digestion with trypsin at 37 °C for 24 h. The resulting peptides were electrophoresed on a cellulose plate at 1,000 V for 30 min using 2.5% formic acid and 7.8% acetic acid as a running buffer. Thin layer chromatography was carried out for 9 h in a solution containing 37.5% n-butanol, 25% pyridine, and 7.5% acetic acid. After drying, the plate was exposed to x-ray film. Synthetic Peptides—The D1 peptide was RRPSLVDVIPDWPC and represented the sequence 1072 to 1084 with a C-terminal Cys residue. The D1 site is Ser-1075. To check on the selectivity of the D1 antibody a peptide containing Ser-1011, i.e. RRPSLVDSMKQHLC, was also synthesized. This is termed the DX peptide and represented the sequence 1008 to 1020 with a C-terminal Cys residue. These peptides were synthesized and purified to greater than 90% purity by Macromolecular Resources (Ft. Collins, CO). Both peptides were phosphorylated by PKA at 25 °C for 20 min under the following conditions: 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm peptide, and 0.5 μg/ml catalytic subunit of PKA (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Assays using [γ-32P]ATP indicated that under these conditions phosphorylation of the peptides reached a maximum at 3 min. The phosphorylated peptides in these assay conditions were used directly for dot blots. The two peptides were equivalent substrates for PKA. Dot Blots—The reactivity of the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated D1 and DX peptides with the affinity-purified antibody to the D1 peptide was monitored using dot blots. The peptide stock solutions (concentrations determined with the bicinchoninic acid reagent, BCA; Pierce) were prepared in 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Samples (10 μl) were applied in triplicate to nitrocellulose (Trans-Blot Transfer Medium, 0.2 μm; Bio-Rad), air-dried, blocked with 5% non-fat dried milk in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl (TBS) for 30 min, and washed twice for 5 min with TBS. Incubation with primary antibody (D1 antibody at 14,000× dilution) was for 1 h, followed by two 5-min washes in TBS. The goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibody (Chemicon) at 4000× dilution in 1% non-fat dried milk, TBS, was applied for 1 h, followed by two washes for 5 min in TBS. After incubation with the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) for 1.5 min the membrane was exposed for 5 min to Kodak X-OMAT AR film. The ECL signals were quantitated by densitometry with Labworks Image Acquisition and Analysis Software and a CD camera (UVP, Inc.). The threshold and outline diameter were set at 1% and 65, respectively. The mean integrated optical density from two or three blots was recorded (arbitrary units). Mass Spectrometry—Permeabilized ABRM from M. edulis were incubated in a relaxing solution (1 mm MgATP; pCa > 8) for 5 min and then an additional 5 min either with or without cAMP (100 μm). Muscles were frozen, and proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The twitchin-containing band was subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion, and the peptides were analyzed by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (PBS II; Ciphergen), in the Protein Chemistry Facility of the Kimmel Cancer Institute at Thomas Jefferson University. Complete Sequence of Mytilus Twitchin—Previously a partial sequence of Mytilus twitchin was reported (16Funabara D. Kinoshita S. Watabe S. Siegman M.J. Butler T.M. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2087-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and it consisted of the C-terminal 878 amino acids. Based on the estimated molecular mass (from SDS-PAGE) of twitchin of 600 kDa this represented only about one-sixth of the total molecule. This C-terminal fragment contained a kinase domain, four Ig motifs, and one of the sites phosphorylated by PKA, namely the D2 site. In the present study, additional sequencing from the kinase domain to the N terminus was carried out for Mytilus twitchin using fifteen successive rounds of 5′-RACE. This generated a new cDNA sequence of 11.7 kbp spanning the region from the kinase domain to the 5′-untranslated region, including the initiation codon. The new cDNA, when combined with that previously reported, contained 16.1 kbp and a coding region of 14.2 kbp. From the latter, the deduced amino acid sequence of full-length twitchin was obtained (Fig. 2), and it represented 4736 residues with a calculated molecular mass of 526,838. It contains 24 Ig and 15 fibronectin type III motifs, in addition to the single kinase domain. The fibronectin type III motifs are well conserved with homologies of 30 to 50%. The Ig motifs show lower homology, between 10 and 25%, except for the five Ig motifs at the N terminus that share about 40% homology. Other regions that should be pointed out include the following: the sequence 790 to 868, between Ig domains 6 and 7, in which more than 60% of the residues are Pro, Glu, Val, or Lys, and an ionic region, 982 to 1009, in which 18 of the 28 residues are charged. Phosphorylation Sites—Two phosphopeptides were isolated previously from Mytilus twitchin phosphorylated by PKA (16Funabara D. Kinoshita S. Watabe S. Siegman M.J. Butler T.M. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2087-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These were RPSLVDVIPDWP (D1 peptide) and RPSMSPAPEV (D2 peptide). As shown in Fig. 2, the D1 and D2 peptide sequences are 1073–1084 and 4314–4323, respectively and the D1 and D2 sites are Ser-1075 and Ser-4316, respectively. D2 is between the kinase domain and the C terminus in a linker region connecting Ig motifs 21 and 22, and D1 is in the N-terminal part of the molecule in a linker region between Ig motifs 7 and 8. The D1 and D2 peptides were isolated and sequenced. Attempts to identify additional sites for PKA by isolating and sequencing the phosphopeptides from twitchin were unsuccessful. Other putative PKA sites include Ser-1011 (termed DX), Ser-1043, and Ser-1067, with flanking sequences of RRPSLVD, RKLSRDN, and RRSSMQQ, respectively. In vitro phosphorylation of twitchin with the catalytic subunit of PKA incorporates approximately 3 mol P/mol twitchin. A phosphopeptide map of such phosphorylated twitchin is shown in Fig. 3. It shows two major spots containing similar radioactivities and a minor spot with much less radiolabeled peptide. These data raise the possibility that incorporation of 2 mol P/mol twitchin result from phosphorylation of two major sites and that the additional mol P/mol twitchin results from the sum of phosphorylation of several minor sites. Because the sequencing was done on twitchin from M. galloprovincialis, and the mechanical experiments were performed on M. edulis, comparative cDNA sequencing was performed on M. edulis using RT-PCR and primers based on the M. galloprovincialis twitchin sequence. These showed that the derived amino acid sequences of D1 and D2 in M. edulis were identical to the sequences of the D1 and D2 M. galloprovincialis peptides used to generate the phosphorylation-dependent antibodies. Of note with respect to the mass spectrometry experiments described below was a substitution of Val-4326 with Ile in M. edulis twitchin. Although this is not in the region included in the synthetic D2 peptide, it does change the mass of the tryptic peptide containing the D2 phosphorylation site in M. edulis. The other putative PKA sites near D1 and their flanking regions (RRPSLVD, RKLSRDN, and RRSSMQQ) are also the same in the two species. Because the DX site contained several residues identical to those in the D1 peptide (i.e. RRPSLVD) it was a concern whether the DX peptide cross-reacted with the D1 antibody. Thus the DX peptide was synthesized and compared in reactivity to the D1 antibody to the D1 peptide. The sequences around the other putative sites were not similar to the D1 peptide and thus were considered unlikely to cross-react with D1 antibody. Dot Blots—Dot blots were used to examine the sensitivity of the D1 antibody with phosphorylated and dephosphorylated D1 and DX peptides. The responses of the D1 antibody over a wide range of peptide amounts are shown in Fig. 4A. The unphosphorylated D1 peptide showed the strongest reaction. The unphosphorylated DX peptide also reacted, but with a reduced signal compared with D1. Phosphorylation of both peptides considerably reduced their response, and the signal from phosphorylated DX was not detected even at very high peptide amounts. The responses of the antibody over lower peptide amounts are shown in Fig. 4B. Detection of the unphosphorylated D1 peptide was the most sensitive, and a reduced response was observed for phosphorylated D1. Both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated DX were not detected over this range. The load of twitchin used in Western blots was between 0.2 and 1.0 μg, corresponding to about 0.4 to 1.9 pmols. The limit of detection in the dot blots for the dephosphorylated D1 peptide was between 1 and 2 ng, i.e. about 0.6 to 1.2 pmols. Thus, at the low levels of twitchin used on blots in the fiber experiments essentially all of the signal detected with the D1 antibody would come from the dephosphorylated D1 site. An important point is that phosphorylated D1 in twitchin would be detected only at concentrations of twitchin exceeding 6 pmols, i.e. considerably above the usual levels of loading. In addition, any signal from the potentially competitive DX peptide (i.e. with the D1 antibody) would not be detected. Phosphorylation of the D1 and D2 Sites in ABRM—We used the anti-D1 antibody and the previously described anti-phospho-D2 antibody (16Funabara D. Kinoshita S. Watabe S. Siegman M.J. Butler T.M. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2087-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) to develop an assay for D1 and D2 site phosphorylation in twitchin from intact and permeabilized ABRM. Permeabilized ABRM incubated in a rigor solution for ∼25 min was used as the source of unphosphorylated twitchin, whereas muscle incubated in ATP and cAMP was the source of maximally phosphorylated twitchin. Fig. 5A shows the relative ECL signals from different mixtures of these samples. The anti-D1 antibody showed no detectable signal from the phosphorylated sample and an almost linear increase as the fraction of phosphorylated sample was decreased. The anti-phospho-D2 antibody gave ∼8% of maximum signal from the unphosphorylated sample and increased with increasing fraction of phosphorylated sample. All phosphorylation measurements of the D1 and D2 sites using this technique are reported relative to the maximum phosphorylation of the site that is obtained with treatment of the muscle with 100 μm cAMP. Twitchin from permeabilized ABRM at pCa > 8 with and without cAMP was subjected to trypsin digestion and surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. Fig. 6 shows that in the absence of cAMP there is a peptide with a mass ([M+H]+) corresponding to the unphosphorylated D1 tryptic peptide (2030.4). cAMP treatment of the muscle results in the loss of this peptide and the appearance of a peptide 80 dalton larger, as expected from phosphorylation of the D1 site. The almost complete loss of the signal from the unphosphorylated D1 peptide suggests nearly 100% phosphorylation of the D1 site. Twitchin from the same sample also showed no reaction with the D1 antibody confirming the absence of an interaction of the antibody with the phosphorylated D1 site. The small amount of phosphorylated peptide in the mass spectrum from the sample without cAMP is consistent with the 11% phosphorylation of D1 determined on the same sample using the above described antibody technique. The smaller signal in the mass spectra from the phosphopeptide compared with the unphosphorylated peptide is not unusual (20Asara J.M. Allison J. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 10: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The only other instance of a cAMP-mediated decrease in one peak and an increase in another at 80 dalton higher [M+H]+ is 2062 to 2142. This does not match any expected unmodified tryptic peptide but might result from dihydroxylation of the D1 peptide. The unphosphorylated tryptic D2 peptide (1964.3) was not observed in either spectrum, but the phosphorylated sample showed a decrease in a peptide of m/z 1978, which might represent a methylated D2 tryptic peptide. Peaks corresponding to tryptic peptides containing putative phosphorylation sites at Ser-1011, Ser-1043, and Ser-1067 were not observed in the unphosphorylated sample, so possible phosphorylation of these sites could not be determined by this method. Intact Muscles—The four experimental designs used to determine the state of D1 and D2 phosphorylation in intact ABRM under different mechanical conditions are shown in Fig. 5B. Multiple successive activations with acetylcholine were used to maximize catch force maintenance (21Twarog B.M. Cole R.A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1972; 43A: 331-335Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar), whereas treatment with serotonin results in release of catch force. Fig. 5C shows that D2 phosphorylation is quite low in catch and high in the presence of serotonin when catch force is released. Interestingly, D1 site phosphorylation is about 40% in catch and increases to almost 100% in serotonin. The increase in phosphorylation of both D1 and D2 in serotonin is reversed when the muscle is subsequently put into catch. Permeabilized Muscles—To obtain a better understanding of the relationships between the phosphorylation of D1 and D2 and the mechanical response of the muscle, experiments were performed on permeabilized ABRM in which it was possible to vary [cAMP] and the degree of twitchin phosphorylation. Fig. 7A shows the design in which muscles were activated in pCa 5 and then switched to pCa > 8. In the absence of cAMP, high catch force is maintained, but as [cAMP] is increased, the catch force maintenance is decreased. Fig. 7B shows the force remaining 2 min after transfer to pCa > 8 (a measure of the catch force), as well as D1 and D2 phosphorylation as a function of [cAMP]. D1 phosphorylation is ∼30% even in the absence of cAMP and increases to almost 100% as catch force is decreased. D2 phosphorylation is very low in the absence of cAMP and increases to more than 80% as [cAMP] increases and catch force dissipates. Fig. 7C shows the relationships of catch force to D1 and D2 phosphorylation in individual muscles. D1 phosphorylations from 0 to 50% appear to have little effect on catch, but higher values are associated with release of catch force. On the other hand, D2 phosphorylation an"

Only MHM2.del23–88 failed to rescue the mice from the Purkinje cell death.

However, the complete resistance of PrP-deficient mice to prion infection indicates an essential role in the development of prion diseases and replication of prion (1Bueler H. Aguzzi A. Sailer A.

Disruption of a part of the Prnp intron 2, including its splicing acceptor, in all the ataxic lines leads to unusual intergenic splicing between Prnp and the downstream gene, designated Prnd, encoding PrPLP/Dpl. As a consequence, the PrPLP/Dpl gene comes under the control of the Prnp promoter, leading to the ectopic expression of PrPLP/Dpl in the neuron. In the physiological situation, PrPLP/Dpl mRNA is expressed at a high level in the testis and heart but is not detectable in the brain except for transient expression by brain endothelial cells around 1 week after birth (11Li A. Sakaguchi S. Shigematsu K. Atarashi R. Roy B.C. Nakaoke R. Arima K. Okimura N. Kopacek J. Katamine S. Am. J.

A study using PrPLP/Dpl-deficient mice has suggested a physiological role for PrPLP/Dpl in spermatogenesis (12Behrens A. Genoud N. Naumann H. Rulicke T. Janett F. Heppner F.L. Ledermann B. Aguzzi A.

Recent reports demonstrated that introduction of a transgene encoding PrPLP/Dpl rendered Zrch I Prnp0 /0 mice capable of reproducing the Purkinje cell degeneration observed in the Ngsk Prnp0 /0 mice (13Moore R.C. Mastrangelo P. Bouzamondo E. Heinrich C. Legname G. Prusiner S.B. Hood L. Westaway D. DeArmond S.J. Tremblay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. of Sci. U. S.

This is direct evidence confirming that both ectopic expression of PrPLP/Dpl and functional loss of PrP are required for the neurodegeneration in Ngsk Prnp0 /0 mice. PrPLP/Dpl, a glycoprotein expressed on the cell surface with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol moiety (14Silverman G.L. Qin K. Moore R.C. Yang Y. Mastrangelo P. Tremblay P. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E.

An NMR study revealed similarities in the tertiary structure between PrPLP/Dpl and the C-terminal half of PrP, both of which are composed of two short β-strands and three α-helices (15Mo H. Moore R.C. Cohen F.E. Westaway D. Prusiner S.B. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. of Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2352-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Interestingly, expression of a transgene encoding truncated PrP lacking N-terminal residues 32–121 or 32–134 in nonataxic Zrch I Prnp0 /0 mice also resulted in severe cerebellar degeneration, which was abrogated by reintroduction of the wild-type mouse PrP gene (16Shmerling D. Hegyi I. Fischer M. Blattler T. Brandner S. Gotz J. Rulicke T. Flechsig E. Cozzio A. von Mering C. Hangartner C. Aguzzi A. Weissmann C.

These results have suggested that PrPLP/Dpl and N-terminal-truncated (del32–121 or 32–134) PrP are toxic to neurons through similar mechanisms and that wild-type PrP may have a neuroprotective function. In the present study, to further elucidate mechanisms of the Purkinje cell death, we generated five different transgenic mouse lines expressing, respectively, heterologous, chimeric, and mutant PrPs on the Ngsk Prnp0 /0 background. A transgene encoding PrP-lacking N-terminal residues 23–88 failed to rescue the Ngsk Prnp0 /0 mice from Purkinje cell degeneration, indicating a crucial role for the residues. The roles of PrPLP/Dpl aggregation and impaired metabolism of reactive oxygen species in the brain tissues of Ngsk Prnp0 /0 mice were also evaluated. Mice—The mouse PrP (Mo.PrP) transgenic (Tg) mice with the Ngsk Prnp0 /0 background were as described previously (5Nishida N. Tremblay P. Sugimoto T. Shigematsu K. Shirabe S. Petromilli C. Erpel S.P.

In the current study, we introduced five types of PrP transgene into Ngsk Prnp0 /0 mice by mating them with the transgenic mouse lines, each harboring the corresponding transgene with the Zrch I Prnp0 /0 background (8Bueler H.

Prusiner, University of California, San Francisco, CA kindly provided the Tg mouse lines. The transgenes included a Syrian hamster wild-type PrP gene (SHa); two SHa/mouse chimeric PrP genes (MH2M and MHM2), MHM2 lacking residues 23 to 88 (MHM2.del23–88); and Mo.PrP gene with E199K substitution (Mo.E199K) (17Scott M.

They were constructed in a cosSHa.Tet. vector, encompassing the entire SHa Prnp locus but not containing the PrPLP/Dpl locus (Prnd) (6Moore R.C. Lee I.Y. Silverman G.L. Harrison P.M. Strome R.

MHM2 PrP has two amino acid substitutions from Mo.PrP, L108M and V111M, which are included in the epitope recognized by 3F4 anti-PrP antibody. MH2M PrP has five amino acid substitutions (L108M, V111M, I138M, Y154N, and S169N) from Mo.PrP. The E199K substitution in Mo.E199K PrP corresponds to that found in patients with familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (21Hsiao K. Meiner Z. Kahana E. Cass C. Kahana I. Avrahami D. Scarlato G. Abramsky O. Prusiner S.B. Gabizon R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 324: 1091-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Offspring carrying the transgenes were identified by PCR of tail DNA as described previously (5Nishida N. Tremblay P. Sugimoto T. Shigematsu K. Shirabe S. Petromilli C. Erpel S.P. Nakaoke R. Atarashi R. Houtani T. Torchia M. Sakaguchi S. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Katamine S. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 689-697PubMed Google Scholar). To distinguish Ngsk from Zrch I Prnp0 /0 genotypes, both a Zrch I-specific primer pair (MP685S, 5′-AACTTCACCGAGACCGATGT and MP215A, 5′-GAACCCTTTGCCTATGCTAA) and a Ngsk-specific primer pair (PGK468S, 5′-CGCTGTTCTCCTCTTCCTCA and NEO390A, 5′-GGTAGCCGGATCAAGCGTAT) were used in the PCR. The F2 offspring carrying transgenes with Ngsk Prnp0 /0 background, Tg/Ngsk Prnp0 /0, were subjected to analysis. Antibodies—The anti-PrP polyclonal mouse antiserum used was described previously (5Nishida N. Tremblay P. Sugimoto T. Shigematsu K. Shirabe S. Petromilli C. Erpel S.P. Nakaoke R. Atarashi R. Houtani T. Torchia M. Sakaguchi S. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Katamine S. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 689-697PubMed Google Scholar). We produced anti-PrPLP/Dpl polyclonal rabbit antiserum using full-length (27–155) recombinant mouse PrPLP/Dpl. 3F4 anti-PrP antibody was purchased from Dako. SAF-mix antibody was a kind gift from Dr. S. Lehmann (22Nishida N. Harris D.A. Vilette D. Laude H. Frobert Y. Grassi J. Casanova D. Milhavet O. Lehmann S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Western Blotting—Brain homogenates (10%, w/v) were prepared in a lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Postnuclear supernatants were collected after low speed centrifugation, and protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Samples were electrophoresed through SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Anti-PrP polyclonal mouse antiserum or anti-PrPLP/Dpl polyclonal rabbit antiserum was used as a probe, and immunoreactive bands were visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). PNGase F Digestion—PNGase F digestion of brain homogenates was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (New England Bio-labs). Briefly, glycoproteins of each sample were denatured by boiling for 10 min in 0.5% SDS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol. 110 volume of 10% Nonidet P-40, 110 volume of 0.5 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), and 2 μl of PNGase F (500 units/μl) were added to each sample. After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C, samples were subjected to Western blotting analysis. Detergent Insolubility of PrPLP/Dpl—Postnuclear supernatants were diluted to a 4 mg/ml protein concentration in the lysis buffer with or without Sarcosyl (1% final concentration). After incubation on ice for 30 min, samples were centrifuged at 108,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. Proteins in the pellets and supernatant were analyzed by Western blotting. Immunohistochemistry—Deparaffinized sections were digested with 1 mg/ml trypsin for 15 min at 37 °C and then placed in 3% H2O2 in methanol for 30 min at room temperature to abolish endogenous peroxidase activity. The tissue sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-spot 35 (calbindin) polyclonal antibody. To detect spot 35 immunoreactivities, we used the EnVision+, in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations (Dako). The antibody-bound peroxidase was revealed with 0.04% diaminobenzidine (Sigma). Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) and Glutathione Peroxidase (Gpx) Activities—Brain homogenates were prepared in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm EDTA and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and supernatants were subjected to analysis. The protein concentration of the supernatants was determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). The total SOD activity was measured by inhibition of the reduction rate of nitro blue tetrazolium, monitored at 560 nm using xanthine and the xanthine oxidase system. One unit of SOD activity was defined as the amount of the enzyme required to inhibit the reduction rate of nitro blue tetrazolium by 50%. The activity was expressed as units/mg of protein. To measure Mn-SOD activity, the reaction mixture was treated with 2 mm potassium cyanide. To obtain Cu/Zn-SOD activity, the amount of Mn-SOD activity was subtracted from the total SOD activity. The Gpx activity was measured by determining the rate of NADPH oxidation to NADP, monitored at 340 nm using glutathione reductase and the NADPH system. The activity was expressed as nmol/min/mg of protein. Rescue of Ngsk Prnp0 / 0 Mice from Neurodegeneration by Mo.E199K but Not MHM2.del23–88 PrP Mutants—We introduced five types of PrP transgene (SHa, MH2M, MHM2, MHM2.del23–88, and Mo.E199K) into Ngsk Prnp0 /0 and evaluated their effects on the phenotype. All the Tg/Ngsk Prnp0 /0 mice developed normally and initially showed no neurological symptoms. At about 13 months after birth, however, Tg-MHM2.del23–88/Ngsk Prnp0 /0 mice, as well as Ngsk Prnp0 /0 mice lacking a PrP transgene, began to exhibit progressive symptoms of ataxia, such as tremor and gait disturbance (Fig. 1A). Analysis of hind footprints confirmed that the ataxic mice could not walk in a straight line, and the length of their steps was shorter than that of the wild-type mice (Fig. 1B). Age at onset of Ngsk Prnp0 /0 and Tg-MHM2.del23–88/Ngsk Prnp0 /0 mice were 68.4 ± 5.6 and 67.0 ± 6.5 weeks (mean ± S.D.), respectively. The remaining Tg/Ngsk Prnp0 /0 lines have never shown any neurological symptoms up to 24 months of age, indicating that SHa, MH2M, MHM2, and MoE199K transgenes, but not MHM2.del23–88, were able to rescue the Ngsk Prnp0 /0 mice from ataxia. Immunostaining with anti-spot 35 (calbindin) antibody of the brain sections derived from 20-month-old Ngsk Prnp0 /0 and Tg-MHM2.del23–88/Ngsk Prnp0 /0 mice revealed an extensive loss of Purkinje cells throughout most of the cerebellar vermis (Fig. 2, B and G). No difference was found in the extent of Purkinje cell loss between the two mouse lines. In contrast, the Tg-SHa, Tg-MH2M, Tg-MHM2, and Tg-Mo.E199K/Ngsk Prnp0 /0 mice showed no Purkinje cell loss (Fig. 2, A, C, D, E, and F). Expression of Transgene-encoded PrP in the Brain Tissues of Tg/Ngsk Prnp0 / 0 Mouse Lines—Expression of the transgene products, PrPs, in the brain tissues of 4-month-old Tg mice was examined by Western blotting using polyclonal anti-PrP mouse serum (Fig. 3) and SAF-mix anti-PrP monoclonal antibody (data not shown). Two lines, Tg-MHM2 and Tg-MHM2.del23–88/Ngsk Prnp0 /0, overexpressed PrP about four to eight times more than wild-type mice. The expression levels of the remaining three, Tg-SHa, Tg-MH2M, and Tg-Mo.E199K/Ngsk Prnp0 /0, appeared to be equivalent to that of wild-type mice. As shown in Fig. 4A, after deglycosylation by PNGase F, SAF-mix visualized two clear bands of 18 and 27 kDa and a faint band of 21 kDa in the brain homogenates from Tg-SHa and Tg-MHM2/Ngsk Prnp0 /0 mice, but 3F4 monoclonal antibody failed to detect an 18-kDa product (Fig. 4B). It has been demonstrated that PrPC undergoes physiological proteolytic cleavage at amino acid residues 110/111 or 111/112, leading to the production of a C-terminal fragment, C1 (23Chen S.G. Teplow D.B. Parchi P. Teller J.K. Gambetti P. Autilio-Gambetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19173-19180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Because the cleavage occurs within the linear 3F4 epitope, C1 is recognized by SAF-mix but not by 3F4. The 18-kDa band is thus most likely to correspond to C1. The remaining 27- and 21-kDa bands are likely to be the full-length PrP and another C-terminal minor product, C2, respectively. The brain tissues from MHM2.del23–88/Ngsk Prnp0 /0 mice also expressed an 18-kDa band that reacted with SAF-mix but not 3F4, in addition to its full-length product of 20 kDa (lane 6 in Fig. 4, A and B). Expression Levels and Detergent Insolubility of PrPLP/Dpl in the Brain Tissues of Tg/Ngsk Prnp0 / 0 Mouse Lines—PrPLP/Dpl expression levels in the brains were examined by Western blotting with polyclonal anti-PrPLP/Dpl rabbit antiserum. Although the brain tissues of Prnp +/+ mice expressed no detectable PrPLP/Dpl, the Tg/Ngsk Prnp0 /0 mouse lines all exhibited PrPLP/Dpl expression at levels equivalent to those of Ngsk Prnp0 /0 mice (Fig. 5). The expression levels remained stable during aging, even after the onset of ataxia (data not shown). Accumulating evidence has indicated that certain neurodegenerative conditions are caused by aggregation of detergent-insoluble proteins, such as PrPSc, in the central nervous system (24Murphy R.M. Annu. Rev. Biomed. Eng. 2002; 4: 155-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). To evaluate the possibility of PrPLP/Dpl aggregation in the brain tissues, we examined the detergent-insolubility of PrPLP/Dpl in the brains of ataxic Ngsk Prnp0 /0 and Tg-SHa/Ngsk Prnp0 /0 mice at 98 weeks of age. As shown in Fig. 6A, PrPLP/Dpl was partially insoluble in the buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate but completely solubilized by 1% sarcosyl. The levels of Triton X-100-insoluble fraction of PrPLP/Dpl were similar between Ngsk Prnp0 /0 and Tg-SHa/Ngsk Prnp0 /0 mice even at 98 weeks of age and did not increase during aging (Fig. 6B). SOD and Gpx Activities in the Brain Tissues of Ngsk Prnp0 / 0 Mice Are Not Reduced—Finally, the possible involvement of the down-regulation of anti-oxidative enzyme activities in the neurodegeneration in Ngsk Prnp0 /0 mice was evaluated. The activities of SOD and Gpx in the brain tissues of Ngsk Prnp0 /0 mice at 6 months of age were measured and compared with those of two age-matched control mouse lines, Prnp +/+and Tg-Mo.PrP/Ngsk Prnp0 /0. Cu/Zn-SOD activities of Prnp +/+, Ngsk Prnp0 /0, and Tg-Mo.PrP/Ngsk Prnp0 /0 mice were 169.2 ± 3.1, 182.8 ± 14.9, and 183.4 ± 10.5 units/mg protein (mean ± S.D.), respectively, and Mn-SOD activities were 19.8 ± 2.3, 19.2 ± 2.7, and 18.2 ± 0.4 units/mg protein, respectively (Fig. 7A). There was no statistically significant difference. Gpx activities were also similar among the mouse lines: 67.1 ± 4.8, 63.7 ± 5.3, and 62.9 ± 0.8 nmol/min/mg protein, respectively (Fig. 7B). We previously demonstrated that wild-type Mo.PrP has the potential to prevent PrPLP/Dpl-induced neurodegeneration in Ngsk Prnp0 /0 mice (5Nishida N. Tremblay P. Sugimoto T. Shigematsu K. Shirabe S. Petromilli C. Erpel S.P. Nakaoke R. Atarashi R. Houtani T. Torchia M. Sakaguchi S. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Katamine S. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 689-697PubMed Google Scholar). The present study showed that Mo.E199K PrP, as well as heterologous hamster and hamster/mouse chimeric PrPs, but not MHM2.del23–88 PrP, could rescue Ngsk Prnp0 /0 mice from Purkinje cell death. Mo.E199K represents the E200K substitution in human PrP, which is commonly found in patients with familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (21Hsiao K. Meiner Z. Kahana E. Cass C. Kahana I. Avrahami D. Scarlato G. Abramsky O. Prusiner S.B. Gabizon R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 324: 1091-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The successful rescue by Mo.E199K strongly indicates that the mutant retains the major aspects of normal PrP function and thus argues against a dominant-negative role for the mutant. The solution structure of recombinant human PrP 90–231 with E200K was reported to be nearly identical to that of wild-type PrP (25Zhang Y. Swietnicki W. Zagorski M.G. Surewicz W.K. Sonnichsen F.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33650-33654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This finding also supports the notion that the amino acid substitution does not disrupt the structure critical for the normal function of PrP. Although various hypothetical models have been proposed, precise mechanisms for the neurodegeneration seen in Ngsk Prnp0 /0 mice remain to be elucidated. In addition to the structural similarities between PrP and PrPLP/Dpl, the previous finding that a recombinant C-terminal PrP (121–231) fragment could convert into a β-sheet-rich structure at acidic pH in vitro (26Hornemann S. Glockshuber R. Proc. Natl. Acad. of Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6010-6014Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) prompted us to examine the involvement of abnormal PrPLP/Dpl aggregation in the neurodegeneration. However, we failed to detect detergent-insoluble PrPLP/Dpl accumulation in the central nervous system of Ngsk Prnp0 /0 mice even after the onset of ataxia. PrPLP/Dpl contains two intramolecular disulfide bonds at the C-terminal portion (14Silverman G.L. Qin K. Moore R.C. Yang Y. Mastrangelo P. Tremblay P. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. Westaway D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26834-26841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in contrast to PrP with a single disulfide bond, which has been shown to be necessary for conversion to the pathogenic isoform, PrPSc. The structures determined by intramolecular disulfide bonds may account for the difference between the two proteins in the potential for structural conversion. It is noteworthy that the MHM2.del23–88 transgene, which encoded a product lacking almost the entire unique octapeptide-repeat region, failed to rescue Ngsk Prnp0 /0 mice from neurodegeneration. Little difference was observed in the pathology and onset of ataxia between Ngsk Prnp0 /0 and Tg-MHM2.del23–88/Ngsk Prnp0 /0 mice. The PrP expression level of Tg-MHM2.del23–88/Ngsk Prnp0 /0 mice was higher than that of Tg-SHa and Tg-MH2M/Ngsk Prnp0 /0 but similar to that of Tg-MHM2/Ngsk Prnp0 /0 mice. This strongly indicates that the N-terminal part of PrP is essential to the rescue from Purkinje cell death. In contrast, MHM2.del23–88 PrP was shown to retain the potential to convert into the pathogenic isoform in prion-infected cell cultures (27Rogers M. Yehiely F. Scott M. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. of Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3182-3186Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and brain tissues of Tg-MHM2.del23–88 mice (19Supattapone S. Bosque P. Muramoto T. Wille H. Aagaard C. Peretz D.

The N-terminal region could thus be a key factor for determining whether physiological function is maintained but is likely to be less important in pathogenic structural conversion. Because the unique octapeptide-repeat region has the potential to bind copper (28Hornshaw M.P. McDermott J.R. Candy J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), PrP may function in the transport or metabolism of copper in the neuron (29Brown D.R. Qin K. Herms J.W. Madlung A. Manson J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 33107-33110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Copper is involved in various aspects of reactive oxygen species metabolism (32Linder M.C. Hazegh-Azam M. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1996; 63: 797S-811SPubMed Google Scholar). It could thus be possible that impaired copper transport may result in reactive oxygen species accumulation, leading to cell death. Indeed, the reduced activity of Cu/Zn-SOD in the brains of Zrch I Prnp0 /0 mice has been reported (33Brown D.R. Besinger A. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). However, along with other contradictory reports (34Waggoner D.J. Drisaldi B. Bartnikas T.B. Casareno R.L. Prohaska J.R. Gitlin J.D. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7455-7458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), the present study failed to show reduced activities of Cu/Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD, and Gpx in the brains of Ngsk Prnp0 /0 mice. The fact that Cu/Zn-SOD-deficient mice have never developed any neurological signs such as ataxia (35Reaume A.G. Elliott J.L. Hoffman E.K. Kowall N.W. Ferrante R.J. Siwek D.F. Wilcox H.M. Flood D.G. Beal M.F. Brown Jr., R.H. Scott R.W. Snider W.D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar) also argues against a causal relationship between reduced activity of Cu/Zn-SOD and Purkinje cell death. Interestingly, Tg mice expressing PrP.del32–121 or 32–134 on the Zrch I Prnp0 /0 background also developed cerebellar cell death, but those with wild-type Prnp background did not (16Shmerling D.

The two mutant PrPs lack a part of or most of the hydrophobic region (111–134), in addition to the octapeptide-repeat region, which are also absent in PrPLP/Dpl. The structural similarities between PrP.del32–121/32–134 and PrPLP/Dpl strongly suggested that a common mechanism is involved in the neurodegeneration in the Tg mice and Ngsk Prnp0 /0 mice. Behrens and Aguzzi (36Behrens A. Aguzzi A. Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 150-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) have hypothesized an as yet unidentified ligand, which harbors affinities to both PrP and PrPLP/Dpl or the N terminus-truncated PrPs. In the absence of PrP, binding of the putative ligand to PrPLP/Dpl or PrP.del32–121/32–134 may trigger an apoptotic signal or prevent a survival signal. On the other hand, in the presence of PrP, the binding would be impeded because of much lower affinity. If this is the case, the failure of MHM2.del23–88 PrP in the phenotype rescue suggests that residues 23–88 include a site critical for ligand binding or functional transduction of ligand signals. Recent studies have demonstrated that copper binds not only to the octapeptide-repeat region but also to the C-terminal PrP-(91–231/121–231) fragments (37Cereghetti G.M. Schweiger A. Glockshuber R. Van Doorslaer S. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 516-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 38Jackson G.S. Murray I. Hosszu L.L. Gibbs N. Waltho J.P. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Proc. Natl. Acad. of Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8531-8535Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) and PrPLP/Dpl (39Qin K. Coomaraswamy J. Mastrangelo P. Yang Y. Lugowski S. Petromilli C.

Hence, copper could be one candidate for this hypothetical ligand, acting to raise a neurotoxic signal or prevent a survival signal through binding to PrPLP/Dpl or PrP.del32–121/32–134. We demonstrated that MHM2.del23–88 PrP, as well as full-length PrP, underwent proteolytic cleavage leading to the production of C1. This indicated that loss of the N-terminal residues 23–88 did not affect the cleavage, and C1 was not necessary for the phenotype rescue. It has also been shown that a N-terminal cleavage product, PrP-(23–110/111), designated N1, was released into the supernatant of cultured cells (40Vincent B. Paitel E. Frobert Y. Lehmann S. Grassi J. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35612-35616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). An intriguing hypothesis is that N1 may play a neuroprotective role outside of the cells. For instance, it may bind to copper or other molecules to produce a neuroprotective signal. The N1 derived from MHM2.del23–88 PrP lacking the octapeptide-repeat region is unlikely to preserve this function. It would be of value to examine the potential of N1 to rescue Ngsk Prnp0 /0 mice from the Purkinje cell death. Another model for the neurodegeneration to be evaluated is that the absence of PrP might make cerebellar cells vulnerable to a constitutive weak apoptotic signal transduced by PrPLP/Dpl (36Behrens A. Aguzzi A. Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 150-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). PrP could raise an anti-apoptotic signal independently and protect from the PrPLP/Dpl-induced apoptosis. Accumulating evidence has supported an anti-apoptotic role of PrP. For instance, overexpression of PrP protected human primary neurons from Bax-mediated apoptosis (41Bounhar Y. Zhang Y. Goodyer C.G. LeBlanc A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39145-39149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The protective effect was abolished by deletion of the octapeptide-repeat region, residues 56–88, of human PrP. Serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis of immortalized hippocampal cells derived from Prnp0 /0 mice was also prevented by overexpressed PrP or Bcl-2 (42Kuwahara C. Takeuchi A.M. Nishimura T. Haraguchi K. Kubosaki A. Matsumoto Y. Saeki K. Yokoyama T. Itohara S. Onodera T. Nature. 1999; 400: 225-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Chiarini et al. (43Chiarini L.B. Freitas A.R. Zanata S.M. Brentani R.R. Martins V.R. Linden R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3317-3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated evidence that a peptide capable of binding to residues 113–128 of PrP protected developing retina neurons from apoptosis via activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The same group has identified stress-inducible protein 1, a heat-shock protein, which binds residues 113–128 of PrP and promotes a neuroprotective signal (44Zanata S.M. Lopes M.H. Mercadante A.F. Hajj G.N. Chiarini L.B. Nomizo R. Freitas A.R. Cabral A.L. Lee K.S. Juliano M.A. de Oliveira E. Jachieri S.G. Burlingame A. Huang L. Linden R. Brentani R.R. Martins V.R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3307-3316Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Interestingly, expression of PrP.del32–121/32–134 in Zrch I Prnp0 /0 mice induced cerebellar neurodegeneration, but MHM2.del23–88 PrP preserving residues 113–128 did not. The absence of the potential to bind to stress-inducible protein 1 may be crucial for the neurotoxic effects of PrP.del32–121/32–134 and PrPLP/Dpl. In prion diseases, the constitutive conversion of PrP into the pathogenic isoform, PrPSc, is likely to result in the functional loss of normal PrP (45Yokoyama T. Kimura K.M. Ushiki Y. Yamada S. Morooka A. Nakashiba T. Sassa T. Itohara S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11265-11271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). If PrPSc mimics the neurotoxic role of PrPLP/Dpl or PrP.del32–121/32–134, Ngsk Prnp0 /0 mice lacking PrP but ectopically expressing PrPLP/Dpl in neurons could be a valuable model for the neurodegeneration. Alternatively, it is also possible that the mechanisms of neurodegeneration in mice are distinct from those of prion diseases, based on the present finding that no detergent-insoluble PrPLP/Dpl was detectable in mouse brain tissues. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the neurodegeneration in Ngsk Prnp0 /0 mice would provide new insights into the understanding of the pathogenesis of prion diseases and other neurodegenerative conditions, as well as the physiological function of PrP. We are grateful to Drs. Stanley B. Prusiner, Patrick Tremblay, and Sylvain Lehmann for providing mice and reagents. We thank Nobuhiko Okimura for technical support, Aimin Li for the anti-PrPLP/Dpl polyclonal rabbit antiserum, and Amanda Nishida for help in preparation of the manuscript."

Because of our increasing knowledge of the role of protein-protein interactions, we now know that single or complexed interacting factor(s) play an important role in regulating transcription.

Deciphering the regulatory interactions as mediated by protein-protein interactions is a prerequisite for our better understanding of the complex regulation of transcription. The DNA-binding regulatory transcription factor that plays a central role in dictating specific transcription (e.g. cell cycle, cell differentiation) consists of an activation/regulatory domain, which interacts with the basal transcription machinery and other protein-protein interactors (e.g. transcriptional cofactors), and the DNA-binding domain (DBD), 1The abbreviations used are: DBD, DNA-binding domain; GST; glutathione S-transferase; CBB, Coomassie Brilliant Blue; HA, hemagglutinin; TOF-MS, time-of-flight mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight.1The abbreviations used are: DBD, DNA-binding domain; GST; glutathione S-transferase; CBB, Coomassie Brilliant Blue; HA, hemagglutinin; TOF-MS, time-of-flight mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight. which specifies the target promoter (10Horikoshi M.

The DBD has been generally thought to possess a passive role to tether the activation/regulatory domain to the transcription machinery on the promoter, and functions other than its DNA binding activity have received little attention (17Wagner S. Green M.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 410-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We have, however, focused on the role of the DBD as a target of regulation, and have shown in the past for Sp1 (18Dynan W.S. Tjian R.

Kimura A Nagai R. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Much research on the activation mechanisms through Sp1 has focused on interaction through the activation domain (e.g. transcription machinery, chromatin factors) (8Naar A.M. Beaurang P.A. Zhou S.

To further understand functional regulation of Sp1 through its DBD, we have in the present study affinity-purified interacting factors and analyzed their functional effects on Sp1. Here we show interaction of Sp1 through its DBD with the histone chaperone TAF-I. Interaction between these proteins is specific. This interaction inhibits Sp1 DNA binding, and also likely as a result of such, inhibits promoter activation by Sp1; thus TAF-I functions as a negative regulator of Sp1. This novel regulatory interaction between DNA-binding regulatory transcription factor and histone chaperone adds to our understanding of the mechanisms of how DNA-binding regulatory transcription factors are regulated by protein-protein interactions. Preparation of Recombinant Proteins—The hexahistidine-tagged and GST-fusion Sp1 DBD constructs and purification have been described (22Suzuki T. Kimura A Nagai R. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The purification protocol for the hexahistidine-tagged protein was slightly modified. Bacterial supernatant was applied to HiTrap Heparin column (Amersham Biosciences), washed with buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.2 m KCl, 20% glycerol, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 μm ZnSO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin), and then eluted with a linear salt gradient of 0.2–2 m KCl. Pooled fractions were next applied to HisTrap column (Amersham Biosciences), washed with buffer A containing 500 mm KCl and 20 mm imidazole, and then eluted with a stepwise gradient up to 0.5 m imidazole. Pooled fractions were dialyzed against buffer B (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 150 mm KCl, 100 μm ZnSO4, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). For GST fusion proteins, glutathione-Sepharose resin (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the lysate, incubated, followed by repeated washes with Buffer A, and then eluted using Buffer A containing 20 mm reduced glutathione (Wako). The GST fusion full-length Sp1 construct was a gift from Dr. Hans Rotheneder. TAF-Iα, β, and mutant constructs (gifts of Dr. Kyosuke Nagata) were expressed in bacteria and purified using Probond resin (Invitrogen) with buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 0.5 m KCl, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). Washes were done with buffer C containing 20 mm imidazole, and then eluted with buffer C containing 0.2 m imidazole. All protein procedures were done at 4 °C. Preparation of Nuclear Extract—Nuclear extract from HeLa S3 cells was prepared as described (29Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed by glass Dounce homogenizer in Dignam's buffer A, then centrifuged for 10 min at 700 × g to pellet nuclei. The pellet was suspended in Dignam's buffer C, rotated for 60 min to extract nuclear protein, and then centrifuged for 15 min at 18,000 × g. Buffer B was used for final dialysis. Dialysate was centrifuged for 15 min at 18,000 × g, and the supernatant was used as nuclear extract. Isolation of Factors Interacting with Sp1 DNA-binding Domain—50 μg of hexahistidine-tagged Sp1 DBD was bound to 50 μl of Probond resin (Invitrogen), and after washing, incubated with 725 μg of HeLa S3 nuclear extract. Proteins were eluted with buffer B containing 0.5 m imidazole. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE analysis and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Protein Identification by MALDI/TOF Mass Spectrometry—Protein bands were excised, dehydrated with acetonitrile, and after removing acetonitrile, dried, and then in-gel digested with trypsin in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8. After soaking in 50% acetonitrile/5% tetrahydrofuran, the supernatant was collected, dried, and then reconstituted by adding 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% tetrahydrofuran and mixed with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. Mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS; Voyager-DE STR, Applied Biosystems) was used to analyze proteins. Masses were calibrated internally with peptides derived from trypsin autolysis, and accuracy was within 10 ppm. Data base searches were done against a nonredundant protein sequence data base of NCBI using the Protein Prospector program V.3.2.1 (UCSF mass spectrometry facility). Protein-Protein Interaction Assay—GST fusion proteins were immobilized to glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with hexahistidine-tagged proteins in buffer of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6 at 4 °C), 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, and 100 μm ZnSO4. Reactions were carried out at 4 °C for 2 h and washed twice with the same buffer. Bound proteins were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, immunoblotted with anti-HIS-probe (G-18) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and then visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Commercially available recombinant proteins were used for p53, MyoD, and NFκB (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—1 μg of anti-Sp1 antibody (PEP-2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or control IgG (sc-2027, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was bound to protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) followed by incubation with 1 mg of HeLa S3 cell extract. After washing with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin), immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and then immunoblotted using TAF-Iα (KM1715) and TAF-Iβ (KM1720) specific antibodies (gifts from Dr. Kyosuke Nagata). Gel-shift DNA Binding Assay—Gel-shift DNA binding assays were done essentially as described (22Suzuki T. Kimura A Nagai R. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Briefly, the Sp1 consensus binding sequence (top 5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′) was used as the probe (underlined nucleotides GG were substituted by TT for mutant analysis). Annealed double-strand probe was gel-purified, and then kinase-labeled by using [γ-32P]ATP (222 TBq(6000 Ci)/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Stratagene). Unincorporated radiolabeled ATP was separated by NucTrap purification column (Stratagene). Specific activity of the radiolabeled probe was adjusted by adding cold double-stranded probe. Binding reactions were done in binding buffer of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6 at 4 °C), 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, and 100 μm ZnSO4. Recombinant proteins were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min in binding buffer prior to addition of 1.0 × 104 cpm (1 ng) of labeled probe, followed by further incubation at 30 °C for 15 min before separation on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. Gels were dried and analyzed using BAS 1500 (Fuji Photo Film). Co-transfection Reporter Assay—25,000 HeLa cells were seeded and transfected 24 h later with the SV40 early promoter reporter (100 ng) and effector expression vectors by liposome-mediated transfer (Tfx-20; Promega). Full-length human Sp1 cDNA (a gift of Dr. James Kadonaga) was inserted into the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). pCHA-TAF-Iα and β were gifts of Dr. Kyosuke Nagata. p53-Luc, which contains 15 copies of a p53-binding sequence upstream of the luciferease reporter and the expression vector pFC-p53, were purchased from Stratagene. The total effector DNA amount in transfection reactions was corrected to 1 μg by addition of empty vector. Cells were harvested after 48 h and assayed for luciferase activity (luciferase assay system, Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized against protein concentration of cell lysates. Protein expression was examined by Western blot using anti-HA antibody (Roche Diagnostics) for TAF-I, and anti-Sp1 antibody (PEP2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for Sp1. Error bars denote S.E. The Histone Chaperone TAF-I Associates with Sp1 DNA-binding Domain—To isolate protein factors that interact with the DBD of Sp1, hexahistidine-tagged Sp1 DBD was bacterially expressed and purified to near homogeneity using heparin and Ni2+-chelating columns (Fig. 1A). HeLa S3 nuclear extract was applied to hexahistidine-tagged Sp1 DBD immobilized on Ni2+-chelating resin, and then proteins bound to the peptide were eluted with imidazole (Fig. 1B). Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining of the bound proteins as resolved by SDS-gel electrophoresis revealed several bands spanning molecular mass from 30 to 200 kDa, which were seen only when the binding reaction between the Sp1 DBD and HeLa nuclear extract was done (Fig. 1C, lane 2) and not when Sp1 DBD alone (lane 1) or HeLa nuclear extract alone (lane 3) was reacted with resin. Two major bands, which were the most abundant on CBB staining were of apparent molecular masses of 41 and 39 kDa and are hereafter referred to as p41 and p39, respectively. To identify the proteins, the p41 and p39 bands were excised, trypsinized, and then subjected to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The proteins were identified by peptide mass finger-printing with a computer search of the nonredundant protein sequence NCBI data base as available for the mammalian proteome, and then further subjected to post-source decay peptide sequencing. Surprisingly, mass spectra of p41 and p39 identified them to be the products of a single gene, template-activating factor-I (TAF-I) (Fig. 2, A–C) (30Matsumoto K. Nagata K. Ui M. Hanaoka F. J. Biol.

TAF-Iα and β are the alternative splicing products of a single gene and differ only in a short region of their amino-terminal ends (Fig. 2C) (31Nagata K. Kawase H. Handa H. Yano K. Yamasaki M.

TAF-Iβ is identical to the SET oncogene whose translocation has been implicated in leukemia (36Adachi Y. Pavlakis G.N. Copeland T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2258-2262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sp1 and TAF-I Interact in Vitro and in Vivo—To examine whether Sp1 DBD directly binds the TAF-I proteins, GST pull-down binding assays were done with recombinant TAF-Iα, β, and Sp1 DBD (Fig. 3A). Under the described binding conditions, both bacterially expressed hexahistidine-tagged TAF-Iα and β (lanes 1 and 2) bound to GST fusion Sp1-DBD (lanes 4 and 6) but not to GST alone (lanes 3 and 5) showing that Sp1 DBD directly binds both TAF-Iα and β. We have reproducibly seen that TAF-Iβ binds Sp1 DBD with a slightly higher affinity than TAF-Iα (lanes 4 and 6). To next see if TAF-I also binds full-length Sp1, GST pull-down binding assays were done with recombinant TAF-Iβ and full-length Sp1 (Fig. 3B). Under the described binding conditions, bacterially expressed hexahistidine-tagged TAF-Iβ (lane 1) bound to GST fusion full-length Sp1 (lane 3) but not to GST alone (lane 2) showing that full-length Sp1 directly binds TAF-I. TAF-I can therefore directly bind Sp1. To further see whether these proteins interact in the cell, immunoprecipitation was done using specific antibodies against TAF-Iα, β, and Sp1 (Fig. 3C). Sp1 was immunoprecipitated from HeLa cells followed by immunoblotting using TAF-Iα- and β-specific antibodies. TAF-Iα and β (lane 1) both bound Sp1 (lane 3) as compared with the control immunoprecipitation using normal IgG antibody (lane 2) confirming that these proteins do indeed interact in the cell. Collectively, TAF-I interacts with Sp1 in vitro and in vivo. Specific Interaction between Sp1 and TAF-I—To see whether interaction of Sp1 DBD with TAF-I is specific or common for histone chaperones, a GST pull-down binding assay of Sp1 DBD was done with the histone chaperone CIA (also known as ASF1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and RCAF in Drosophila complexed with histones) (37Le S. Davis C. Konopka J.B. Sternglanz R. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1029-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 38Munakata T. Adachi N. Yokoyama N. Kuzuhara T. Horikoshi M.

Nature. 1999; 402: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). Under conditions in which Sp1 DBD bound TAF-Iβ (lanes 4 and 5), Sp1 DBD did not bind CIA (lanes 1–3) showing that interaction between Sp1 DBD and TAF-I is specific. Therefore, interaction between Sp1 DBD and TAF-I is a specific property of these factors, and not a property common for histone chaperones. To next see whether interaction with TAF-I is specific for Sp1 or common for DNA-binding factors, a GST pull-down binding assay with the DNA-binding transcription factors p53, MyoD, and NFκB was performed (Fig. 4B). Under conditions in which Sp1 DBD bound TAF-Iβ (lanes 1–3), TAF-Iβ did not bind p53, MyoD, or NFκB (lanes 4–6) thus showing that interaction between Sp1 DBD and TAF-I is specific. A CBB stain of the GST fusion proteins is shown (Fig. 4C). Therefore, interaction between Sp1 DBD and TAF-I is a specific property of these two factors. Effects of the Acidic Carboxyl-terminal Regions of TAF-I in Interaction with Sp1—Histone chaperones including TAF-I have in common an acidic region (32Kawase H. Okuwaki M. Miyaji M. Ohba R. Handa H. Ishimi Y. Fujii-Nakata T. Kikuchi A. Nagata K. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 1045-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 34Matsumoto K. Nagata K. Okuwaki M. Tsujimoto M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 38Munakata T. Adachi N. Yokoyama N. Kuzuhara T. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 40Umehara T. Chimura T. Ichikawa N. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 59-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), but as Sp1 DBD did not bind CIA (Fig. 4A), we thought that the acidic region may not mediate interaction between TAF-I and Sp1 DBD. To address the effects of the acidic region of TAF-I on interaction with Sp1 DBD, GST pull-down binding assays using mutants of TAF-Iα and β, which lack the common acidic carboxyl-terminal end, TAF-IαΔC and TAF-IβΔC, respectively, were done (Fig. 5A). We have reproducibly seen that TAF-IαΔC binds Sp1 DBD with less affinity than TAF-IβΔC (Fig. 5B, lanes 3 and 6), which may suggest that the acidic carboxyl-terminal end participates in regulation of binding of TAF-Iα with Sp1 DBD greater than for TAF-Iβ. The acidic region of TAF-I may therefore be involved in modulation of binding affinity. TAF-I Inhibits DNA Binding Activity of Sp1—As TAF-I binds the DNA-binding domain of Sp1, we examined the effects of TAF-I proteins on the DNA binding activity of Sp1 by gel mobility shift analysis (Fig. 6A). Under conditions in which TAF-Iα and β did not show DNA binding activity (lanes 2 and 3), incubation of TAF-I with Sp1 DBD resulted in inhibition of specific DNA binding activity of Sp1 DBD to its cognate binding sites (lanes 4–6) as shown by the dose-dependent decrease in intensity of the shifted DNA-protein complex for TAF-Iα (lanes 7 and 8) and TAF-Iβ (lanes 9 and 10). TAF-Iβ inhibited the DNA binding activity of Sp1 DBD to a slightly greater extent than TAF-Iα (lanes 7 and 8 versus 9 and 10). Under identical conditions, the acetyltransferase p300 stimulates DNA binding activity of Sp1 DBD and thus this is not a nonspecific effect of TAF-I (data not shown and Ref. 22Suzuki T. Kimura A Nagai R. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Therefore, TAF-I inhibited the DNA binding activity of Sp1 DBD. TAF-I Inhibits Sp1-dependent Promoter Activation—As interaction of TAF-I proteins and Sp1 DBD inhibited the DNA binding activity of Sp1 DBD, we examined whether TAF-I would inhibit Sp1-dependent promoter activation as would be expected as a secondary result. Co-transfection analysis was performed with a luciferase-reporter construct harboring the SV40 early promoter which contains six Sp1 binding sites (Fig. 7A). As expected, under conditions in which transfection of an expression plasmid harboring full-length Sp1 showed dose-dependent activation of the SV40 early promoter reporter construct in HeLa cells (lanes 1–3) and in which TAF-I did not show activation of this reporter (TAF-Iα, lanes 10–12; TAF-Iβ, lanes 13–15), co-transfection of TAF-I with Sp1 resulted in inhibition of Sp1-dependent promoter activation (TAF-Iα, lanes 4–6; TAF-Iβ, lanes 7–9). Protein expression from the expression vectors was confirmed by Western blot. Both TAF-Iα and β showed increasing amounts of expression. Sp1 also showed increased expression, which shows that the effects of TAF-I on Sp1 are not due to inhibition of Sp1 expression from its expression vector. Further, as a control, we tested effects of TAF-I on p53 promoter activation as our binding studies showed that p53 does not associate with TAF-I. Under our tested conditions, TAF-I did not inhibit p53 promoter activation (Fig. 7B). TAF-I therefore negatively regulates Sp1-mediated promoter activation likely as a result of inhibition of DNA-binding. Here we have described a novel interaction between a DNA-binding transcription factor and histone chaperone. Specifically, we have described functional interaction between the DNA-binding transcription factor Sp1 and the histone chaperone TAF-I. Novel Activity of Histone Chaperone—Histone chaperones are a class of factors that possess activity to mediate assembly and/or disassembly of nucleosomal histones in an ATP-independent manner and include the factors TAF-I, CIA, nucleoplasmin, and NAP-1 among others (30Matsumoto K. Nagata K. Ui M. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10582-10587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Nagata K. Kawase H. Handa H. Yano K. Yamasaki M. Ishimi Y. Okuda A. Kikuchi A.

Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). While interaction with histones and their activity to assemble/disassemble nucleosomal histones has been well addressed, their interaction with DNA-binding transcription factors has not been explored. The present study shows that the histone chaperone TAF-I functionally interacts with the DNA-binding transcription factor Sp1 (Figs. 3, 6, and 7). This interaction is specific as another histone chaperone examined did not bind Sp1, and as other tested DNA-binding transcription factors did not bind TAF-I (Fig. 4). TAF-I acts to negatively regulate the DNA binding and likely as a result of such also promoter activation by Sp1 (Figs. 6, 7, 8). TAF-I has been similarly shown to negatively regulate promoter activation by the retinoic acid receptor using cell co-transfection studies (43Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Importantly, TAF-I may act to negatively regulate a subset of DNA-binding transcription factors that includes at least the zinc finger-type factors, which both Sp1 and nuclear receptors are. We note that TAF-I has been shown to stimulate transcription from in vitro chromatin template (35Okuwaki M. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34511-34518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The cell co-transfection assay used by us and others differs from the in vitro transcription reaction as the former is a cellular experiment in which a transfected episomal plasmid reporter is activated by forced expression of a transcription factor likely in the cytoplasm, in contrast to the latter biochemical study, which uses reconstituted components. The latter better reflects the involved fundamental reactions and allows for dissection of mechanisms of action; however, the former in contrast better reflects the collective surrounding regulatory reactions as seen in the cell albeit possible inherent limitations associated with compartmentation (e.g. cytoplasmic reaction) and concentration (e.g. effect of forced expression in contrast to basal endogenous levels). The apparent discrepancy in results between in vitro and in vivo experiments will be a topic needed to be addressed in further studies. The mechanism of how histone chaperones are involved in reactions associated with specific promoters has also remained elusive. Functional interaction between DNA-binding transcription factor and histone chaperone may play a role in specifying the site of the reaction as dictated by the gene- and site-specific targeting properties of the DNA-binding factor. In reference, the centromeric proteins (CENP-A,B,C) through its DNA-binding component (CENP-B) shows centromere sequence-specific binding and localization allowing the CENP complex to modulate centromeric nucleosomes (44Ando S. Yang H. Nozaki N. Okazaki T. Yoda K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 227: 2229-2241Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This is one example in which concerted action between sequence-specific DNA-binding factor with histone-associated catalytic protein(s) results in specific and localized chromosomal/nucleosomal processes. Functional sequelae of the interaction between DNA-binding transcription factor and histone chaperone may be dictation of site-specificity by DNA-binding transcription factors for catalytic events to be mediated by the histone chaperone (e.g. nucleosome assembly/disassembly). Regulatory Role of the DNA-binding Domain—Of additional importance, interaction of Sp1 with TAF-I was mediated through the DBD. Much focus on regulation of Sp1 through protein-protein interaction has focused on the role of the activation domain (e.g. interaction with the basal machinery dTAF110/hTAF130 and transcriptional complex ARC) (8Naar A.M. Beaurang P.A. Zhou S. Abraham S. Solomon W. Tjian R. Nature. 1999; 398: 828-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 23Gill G. Pascal E. Tseng Z.H. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) in contrast to the role of the DNA-binding domain, which has been poorly addressed. However, past studies by ourselves and others have shown that the DBD of Sp1 mediates important regulatory interactions such as with the cell cycle regulator E2F (24Karlseder J. Rotheneder H. Wintersberger E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 1659-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 25Lin S.Y. Black A.R. Kostic D. Pajovic S. Hoover C.N. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 1668-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), the acetyltransferase p300 (22Suzuki T. Kimura A Nagai R. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), the histone deacetylase HDAC1 (26Doetzlhofer A. Rotheneder H. Lagger G. Koranda M. Kurtev V. Brosch G. Wintersberger E. Seiser C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 5504-5511Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), the ATP-dependent nucleosomal remodeling enzyme SWI/SNF (27Kadam S. McAlpine G.S. Phelan M.L. Kingston R.E. Jones K.A. Emerson B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2441-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) as well as other zinc finger transcription factors including Krüppel-like factors (28Mackay J.P. Crossley M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Sp1 DBD interacts with all three major chromatin-related factors consisting of chemical modification enzymes (e.g. acetyltransferase p300), ATP-dependent nucleosome assembly factor (e.g. SWI/SNF) and histone chaperone (e.g. TAF-I), which is a finding which has only been shown for histones. This finding is of particular interest because it implicates the DBD to play a likely role in mediating transcriptional regulatory processes in eukaryotes at the chromatin level. Combined regulation of the transcription factor by interaction with chromatin-related complexes through its activation domain (e.g. ARC, DRIP, TRAP) and the three factors through the DBD likely results in coordinated transcriptional regulation at the chromatin level. Importantly, as the DBD specifies the target gene or DNA sequence, selective and ordered interaction of chromatin-related factor with the DBD of the transcription factor may play a role in gene- and factor-selective regulation. Selective interaction between histone chaperones with DNA-binding factors such as interaction of TAF-I with zinc-finger type transcription factors is further suggestive of a specific regulatory role in transcription. Cooperative Interaction of Histone Chaperone and DNA-binding Transcription Factor—Functional interaction between DNA-binding factor and histone chaperone is the most note-worthy new molecular mechanism, which results from our present study. As the interaction is specific, and as the histone chaperone negatively regulates activities of the DNA-binding factor, it is tempting to envision that TAF-I plays an important role to negatively regulate subsets of DNA-binding factors to affect selective gene expression. We, however, do not rule out the possibility that TAF-I may also participate in activation processes under certain regulatory conditions in consideration of the fact that TAF-I has been shown to possess stimulatory effects on transcription in vitro (35Okuwaki M. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34511-34518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The next important questions which need to be answered are whether TAF-I contributes to continuous regulation/inactivation or if this is a triggered event, and how histones which also bind histone chaperones contribute to this process. It is note-worthy that the chaperone proteins including the Hsp90-co-chaperone p23, Hsp90, and Hsp70 modulate assembly as well as disassembly of transcriptional complexes as shown for nuclear receptors (45Freeman B.C. Yamamoto K.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 285-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 46Freeman B.C. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 2002; 296: 2232-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 47Morimoto R.I. Cell. 2002; 110: 281-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). It is tempting to envision that histone chaperones also contribute to DNA-binding transcription factor regulation by mediating inactivation processes. Although the mechanisms of interaction of histone chaperone on DNA-binding factor are yet unclear, TAF-I may inhibit the activities of Sp1 by competitive interaction with the DNA-binding surface, but alternatively binding to the non-DNA-binding surface of Sp1 DBD may induce an allosteric/conformational change to Sp1 DBD making it transcriptionally incompetent/competent for further regulatory interactions (e.g. DNA binding, transcriptional activation). Based on our data centered on Sp1 DBD, we have shown in the past that p300 acetyltransferase facilitates promoter access (22Suzuki T. Kimura A Nagai R. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), therefore TAF-I as a negative regulator may act in concert with the acetyltransferase to mediate a balance of promoter activation and inactivation. Given that acetyltransferase and TAF-I have been shown to regulate acetylation and its inhibition on histones (43Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), respectively, this may be one of the signal modifications regulated by this concerted interaction (22Suzuki T. Kimura A Nagai R. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 43Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). As we have shown that Sp1 DBD is acetylated (22Suzuki T. Kimura A Nagai R. Horikoshi M. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), further experiments to investigate whether TAF-I regulates inhibition of acetylation of DNA-binding transcription factor will also add to our understanding of transcriptional regulation. Further, although it would seem that inactivation/activation is an energy-consuming process, as histone chaperones are essentially non-ATP-dependent factors, their contribution would likely facilitate this process and allow for efficient transcriptional regulation. Collectively, we have shown that the histone chaperone TAF-I negatively regulates a DNA-binding transcription factor. Our results provide an initial step in understanding the role of histone chaperones in the regulation of DNA-binding transcription factors. We thank Drs. James Kadonaga, Kyosuke Nagata, and Hans Rotheneder for constructs and reagents."

In wild type liver, p21 expression is induced in a biphasic manner following injection of CCl4, with an early peak of p21 expression occurring in pericentral hepatocytes at 6 h, prior to evidence of injury, and a second peak succeeding regenerative proliferation. In contrast, p27 is present throughout the quiescent liver, but its expression decreases following CCl4 injection.

Although they had the least injury, p21-deficient mice had the highest levels of hepatic proliferation that correlated with increases in hyperphosphorylated retinoblastoma protein and Cyclin A gene expression. Increased replication in p21-deficient livers was counteracted by an increase in hepatocyte apoptosis as detected by caspase-3 activation. p21 plays distinct and opposing roles regulating hepatocyte survival during injury and subsequent repair, with early induction of p21 contributing to necrotic injury and later expression to cessation of proliferation and hepatocyte survival.

In the adult mouse, p27 is expressed throughout the liver lobule, whereas expression of p21 protein cannot be detected. However, in the absence of p27, p21 protein accumulates, and at least one of these CKIs is needed for proper maintenance of hepatocyte quiescence (7Kwon Y.H. Jovanovic A. Serfas M.S. Kiyokawa H.

The liver provides an outstanding model for studying the physiological roles of CKIs in tissue repair and remodeling. It has the unique ability to regenerate following tissue loss because of chemical or physical injury (reviewed in Refs. 8Fausto N. J.

Regulation of the regenerative process must include signals that stop cell proliferation, once the liver has been restored to the appropriate size. Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) has been widely used to study mechanisms of hepatic injury and repair following toxin-induced injury (10Sell S.

It is metabolized in the centrilobular zone of the liver where the production of highly reactive trichloromethyl radicals leads to the necrotic death of pericentral hepatocytes (11Slater T.F.

One to 2 days following CCl4 injection, liver cells within the periportal and intermediate zones divide in response to the severe damage and cell death that occurs in the pericentral region. Previously we detected a dramatic increase in expression of mRNA encoding the CKI p21Waf1/Cip1 in mouse pericentral hepatocytes between 4 and 8 h after CCl4 injection, long before any clear evidence of liver injury was apparent. A second peak of p21 mRNA expression was observed between 1 and 2 days post-injection in periportal hepatocytes that had divided to replace the dead cells. The two peaks of p21 mRNA expression observed following CCl4-induced injury were detected in both wild type and p53-deficient mice, indicating that p21 gene expression was not p53-dependent (13Serfas M.S.

In the current study, we have addressed the roles of p21 and the related CKI p27 during the course of CCl4-induced liver injury and regeneration using mice deficient for p21 or p27. These studies provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating liver injury and repair following chemical injury, as toxins and liver cell necrosis play significant roles in a number of clinical liver diseases (reviewed in Ref. 14Rosser B.G. Gores G.J. Gastroenterology. 1995; 108: 252-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Animals—Conventionally raised viral antigen free wild type, p21–/– (15Brugarolas J.

Cell. 1996; 85: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar) male mice at 8–10 weeks of age were used in all experiments, unless otherwise indicated. At least three mice per genotype were examined per time point. Mice were fed a commercial diet and water ad libitum. To induce injury 10 μl/g body weight of a 10% solution of carbon tetrachloride in corn oil or corn oil alone was injected intraperitoneally, and mice were sacrificed at the times indicated. The left lobe of the liver was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and paraffin-embedded for sectioning. Other portions of liver were frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at –70 °C for preparation of protein lysates and total RNA. Immunoblotting—In general, 50 μg of total liver protein was separated on 12 or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). For pRb and p107 proteins, 150 μg of protein was loaded and separated on an 8% gel. All membranes were stained with Ponceau S to confirm equal loading and transfer of protein. Immunoblotting was performed using the following primary antibodies obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA: p21 (SC-397), p27 (SC-528), Cdk2 (SC-163), Cdk4 (SC-260), cyclin A (SC-596), cyclin E (SC-481), p107 (SC-318), and PCNA (SC-56). Other antibodies used included cyclin D1 (MS-210, NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA), phospho-Rb (9308, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), and β–actin (A-5441, Sigma). Immunoreactive bands were detected using the SuperSignal Substrate (Pierce). Immunoprecipitations were performed using anti-p21 antibody (PC55, Oncogene Research Products, San Diego). Rabbit IgG was used as a control for antibody specificity. Semi-quantitative and Quantitative PCR—Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed to examine expression of mouse p21, p27, and cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP 2E1) as described (7Kwon Y.H. Jovanovic A. Serfas M.S. Kiyokawa H. Tyner A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41417-41422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The following primer pairs and conditions were used for detecting expression of p21 (upstream primer, AGTGTGCCGTTGTCTCTTCG; downstream primer, ACACCAGAGTGCAAGACAGC; annealing temperature 62 °C, 30 cycles; product 311 bp), p27 (upstream primer, TCGCAGAACTTCGAAGAGG; downstream primer, TGACTCGCTTCTTCCATATCC; annealing temperature 62 °C, 30 cycles; product 300 bp), and CYP 2E1 (upstream primer, AGTGTTCACACTGCACCTGG; downstream primer, CCTGGAACACAGGAATGTCC; annealing temperature 57 °C, 20 cycles; product 125 bp). Expression of mouse S16 ribosomal protein was examined as an internal control as described previously (13Serfas M.S. Goufman E. Feuerman M.H. Gartel A.L. Tyner A.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 951-961PubMed Google Scholar). For each combination of primers, the kinetics of PCR amplification were studied; the number of cycles corresponding to plateau was determined, and PCR was performed within the exponential range. Amplified products were separated on either 1.2 or 2% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide staining. Quantitative real time PCR was performed to measure cyclin A gene expression (upstream primer, AGTACCTGCCTTCACTCATTGCTG; downstream primer, TCTGGTGAAGGTCCACAAGACAAG) using the ABI PRISM 7700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and SYBR Green technology. Mouse S18 expression was examined as a control using the primers described (17DeRyckere D. DeGregori J. Methods. 2002; 26: 57-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). 96-Well optical plates with reaction mixtures were heated for 2 min at 50 °C and 4 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of PCR consisting of 15 s at 95 °Cand20sat63 °C. At the end of the run, samples were heated to 95 °C with a ramp time of 10 s to construct dissociation curves to check that single PCR products were obtained. PCRs were also analyzed by gel electrophoresis to confirm that a single product of the expected size was amplified. Validation experiments were performed to demonstrate that efficiencies of target and reference amplifications were approximately equal. The comparative C T method for relative quantitation of gene expression described by Applied Biosystems was used to determine cyclin A expression levels. Experiments were carried out in triplicate for each data point. Sequence Detection Systems 1.7 software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was used for analysis. Assessment of Liver Injury—Levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were measured to assess the degree of hepatic necrosis. Serum was collected from animals and analyzed for ALT activity using an in vitro diagnostic kit from Sigma. The DeadEnd™ Fluorometric TUNEL System (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) was used to examine injury in the liver. Fluorescein-12-UTP-labeled DNA in liver sections was visualized using fluorescence microscopy. To examine caspase-3 activation in situ, liver sections were pretreated for antigen recovery and accessibility by microwave heating in 0.01 m citrate (pH 6.0) solution, 4× for 5 min. The Tyramide Signal Amplification kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and cleaved caspase-3 antibody (Asp-175, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) were used for immunohistochemistry. Autoradiographic Analyses—For determination of hepatocyte proliferation, 2 μCi of methyl-[3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences)/g body weight was injected intraperitoneally into three mice of each genotype 1 h prior to sacrifice. Tissue sections were dipped into NTB-2 emulsion and exposed for 17 days. Developed slides were counterstained with hematoxylin-eosin, and the number of hepatocytes incorporating [3H]thymidine was determined by counting 3H-labeled hepatocyte nuclei in 3 grids per field. At least 5 fields were counted on each slide, and 3 slides were analyzed for each sample. Differential Regulation of p21 and p27 following Liver Injury—Expression of p21 and p27 protein was examined in the liver during the course of CCl4-induced liver injury and regeneration in wild type mice and mice lacking p21 or p27. Wild type, p21–/–, and p27–/– mice injected with CCl4 or corn oil alone were sacrificed at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, and 168 h after injection. Total proteins were isolated and subjected to immunoblotting with antibodies against p21, p27, or β-actin (Fig. 1A). We were unable to detect p21 protein in wild type liver lysates, but its expression was induced by 3 h after CCl4 injection. Two peaks of p21 protein were detected at 6 and 48 h in wild type mice. p53-independent transcriptional regulation plays a key role in the induction of p21 following CCl4 injection (13Serfas M.S. Goufman E. Feuerman M.H. Gartel A.L. Tyner A.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 951-961PubMed Google Scholar), and the two peaks of p21 protein expression followed peak mRNA expression detected using RT-PCR (Fig. 1B). Significant p27 protein expression was detected in wild type quiescent liver, but shortly after CCl4 administration p27 levels decreased. Decreases in p27 protein levels after injury appear to be post-transcriptionally regulated, because p27 mRNA levels remain fairly constant during the course of regeneration (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, significant levels of p21 protein were detected in p27-deficient mice at the zero time point (Figs. 1A and 5B), although no increase in p21 RNA expression was detected in p27-deficient mice (Fig. 1B). Our earlier studies indicate that p21 accumulates in the livers of p27-deficient mice through a post-transcriptional mechanism and compensates for the absence of p27 in maintaining hepatocyte quiescence (7Kwon Y.H. Jovanovic A. Serfas M.S. Kiyokawa H. Tyner A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41417-41422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Differences in p21 expression were also detected at later time points in p27-deficient mice when compared with wild type mice (Figs. 1A and 5B). The early peak of p21 protein expression detected in wild type animals was muted, and the later peak of p21 expression occurred at 36 h in p27-deficient mice versus 48 h in the wild type mice. These data indicate that hepatocytes deficient for p27 differentially regulate expression of p21 at several time points. In p27-deficient mice the pattern of p21 RNA expression was very similar to that of wild type mice, suggesting that the differences in p21 expression are regulated post-transcriptionally in p27-deficient hepatocytes. We found previously (7Kwon Y.H. Jovanovic A. Serfas M.S. Kiyokawa H. Tyner A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41417-41422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) that p21 protein expression was regulated at the level of protein stability in cultured primary hepatocytes. Decreased Necrotic Injury in p21-deficient Mice—CCl4 is a classical inducer of centrilobular necrosis. When hepatocytes undergo necrosis, ALT is released from hepatocytes into the bloodstream, resulting in abnormally high serum levels of this enzyme. To assess the level of hepatocyte necrosis, we measured serum ALT levels throughout the course of liver injury and repair (Fig. 2). Peak levels of serum ALT were detected at 18 h post-CCl4 injection in both wild type and p27–/– mice. At this time point serum levels of ALT in p21-deficient mice were ∼5-fold less than in the other two genotypes. Release of ALT was delayed in p21-deficient mice, with peak levels appearing at 24 h. However, cumulative serum ALT in p21–/– animals never reached the levels detected in wild type and p27 null animals. p27-deficient mice had higher levels of serum ALT at 24 h post-injection than wild type mice, and the p27-deficient mice also express higher levels of p21 at this time point (see Figs. 1A and 5B). The decreased level of necrotic injury in p21-deficient mice following CCl4 injection was verified using a variety of different techniques. The basic histological subunit of the liver is the lobule, a hexagonal structure consisting of six portal triads surrounding a central vein (reviewed in Ref. 18Fausto N. Campbell J.S. Mech. Dev. 2003; 120: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Only hepatocytes surrounding the central vein are killed following the metabolism of CCl4. During the peak period of CCl4-induced injury, viable cells were detected by simple hematoxylin-eosin staining in the pericentral region of the p21–/– liver lobule but not in the wild type or p27–/– liver lobule (data not shown). To assess further the level of injury, TUNEL assays were performed. At 18 and 24 h after CCl4 injection, intense labeling of cells was detected in the pericentral regions of wild type and p27-deficient liver lobules but not in the livers of p21-deficient mice (Fig. 3A). It has been shown that the TUNEL assay fails to discriminate between apoptosis and necrosis in the liver (19Grasl-Kraupp B. Ruttkay-Nedecky B. Koudelka H. Bukowska K. Bursch W. Schulte-Hermann R. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 1465-1468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the TUNEL labeling indicated necrosis or apoptosis, immunohistochemistry was performed with parallel liver sections and antibodies specific for activated (cleaved) caspase-3. The vast majority of TUNEL-positive cells in wild type and p27-deficient livers were negative for cleaved caspase-3, indicating that the cells were necrotic. However, in p21-deficient livers, cells near the central vein were found to be undergoing apoptosis. Cleaved caspase-3 antibody reactivity at 24 h when peak levels of ALT are released in p21-deficent mice is shown in Fig. 3B. The cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) metabolizes CCl4 and is constitutively expressed in pericentral hepatocytes. The importance of this enzyme in CCl4 metabolism was demonstrated using CYP2E1-deficient mice, which are resistant to CCl4-induced injury (20Wong F.W. Chan W.Y. Lee S.S. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1998; 153: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Decreased injury in response to CCl4 in p21-deficient mice led us to ask if CYP2E1 was efficiently expressed in these animals. We examined CYP2E1 mRNA levels in wild type and p21–/– mice before treatment and 18 h after CCl4 injection, when peak serum ALT was detected in wild type animals (Fig. 4). Wild type and p21-deficient mice expressed comparable levels of CYP2E1 mRNA at the zero time point. By 18 h post-CCl4 injection, it became difficult to detect CYP2E1 mRNA in wild type mice, probably due to the high level of necrotic death of CYP2E1-expressing cells. However, CYP2E1 mRNA was still readily detected in the p21-deficient animals. Thus, decreased CYP2E1 expression is not responsible for the decrease in necrotic injury in the p21-deficient mice. Our ability to detect CYP2E1 mRNA in p21-deficient mice at 18 h post-CCl4 injection is an additional indicator of increased cell viability in the centrilobular zone. Increased Regenerative Proliferation and Expression of Cyclin A in Mice Lacking p21 following CCl 4 -induced Liver Injury—Expression of Cdk2, Cdk4, Cyclin A, Cyclin D1, Cyclin E, and PCNA was examined during the course of CCl4-induced regeneration in wild type, p21–/–, and p27–/– mice (Fig. 5A). Expression of most of these genes was increased during the proliferative phase of liver regeneration (36–72 h) in these mice. A notable prolonged increase in Cyclin A expression was detected in the livers of p21–/– mice when compared with wild type controls and p27–/– mice. In Fig. 5A relative amounts of protein expressed at different time points in each genotype are displayed. However, differences in experimental conditions preclude making comparisons regarding absolute levels of protein expressed at each time point between livers of mice of each genotype. To compare directly protein expression levels in the different genotypes, 50 μg of liver protein from wild type and p21- and p27-deficient mice at 0, 6, 24, 36, and 48 h post-CCl4 injection were loaded on the same gel, and immunoblotting was performed (Fig. 5B). Increased p21 protein levels were detected in the liver at the zero time point and 24 and 36 h post-CCl4 injection in mice lacking p27, whereas reduced levels of p21 are expressed at 6 h in the p27-deficient animals. Increased Cdk and PCNA expression was also present at the zero time point in p27 null mice (see also Ref. 7Kwon Y.H. Jovanovic A. Serfas M.S. Kiyokawa H. Tyner A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41417-41422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A substantial increase in Cyclin A levels was detected in p21–/– liver samples at 48 h post-CCl4 injection. To determine whether p21 or p27 are necessary for regulation of hepatocyte proliferation following CCl4-induced injury, [3H]thymidine was injected into wild type, p21–/–, and p27–/– mice 1 h prior to the time of sacrifice at 24, 36, 48, 72, and 168 h following CCl4 injection, and [3H]thymidine incorporation was examined in liver sections (Fig. 6). Significant regenerative proliferation was not observed at the 24- and 168-h time points in any of the genotypes. In all genotypes of mice, peak proliferation was detected at 36 h post-CCl4 injection. Mice deficient for p21 had the highest level of proliferation, with ∼30% more hepatocytes incorporating [3H]thymidine in the 1-h period in p21–/– mice than in wild type mice. Higher levels of cell proliferation were maintained in p21 null mice at 48 and 72 h post-CCl4 injection. The p27-deficient animals had lower levels of cell proliferation at all time points. This may be due in part to the growth inhibitory effect of increased expression of p21 in the livers of these mice (see Fig. 5B). Immunoprecipitations were performed with p21 antibodies and wild type and p27-deficient liver lysates, and immunoblotting was performed with antibodies against different Cdks and cyclins. We easily detected association of p21 with Cdk2, Cdk4, and cyclin D1 in p27-deficient liver lysates (Fig. 7). Because lower levels of p21 are expressed in wild type liver, longer exposure times were required to detect the same co-immunoprecipitated proteins leading to increased background levels. At 6 h post-CCl4 injection, p21 was complexed with Cdk2, and the p21-Cdk2 complex was more abundant in wild type mice. However, no increase in proliferation was detected in p21-deficient mice at the 6-h time point (data not shown). Prolonged Hepatocyte Proliferation Correlates with Increased Phosphorylation of pRb and Induction of Genes Required for S-phase Progression in p21-deficient Mice—Hyperphosphorylation of members of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) family by Cdks leads to inhibition of the growth-suppressive functions of members of the pRb family, activation of the E2F family of transcription factors, and gene expression required for cell cycle progression. p21 is an inhibitor of pRb phosphorylation raising the possibility that p21-deficient mice might have increased phosphorylation of members of the pRb family. We examined phosphorylation of pRb in the livers of p21–/– and wild type mice following CCl4 administration (Fig. 8A). Hyperphosphorylated pRb levels were highest at the 48-h time point post-CCl4 injection in wild type mice. Peak p21 protein induction is also detected at 48 h in wild type mice, which prevents the sustained proliferation detected in livers of p21-deficient mice. In p21-deficient mice, prolonged hyperphosphorylation of pRb was detected from 24 to 72 h post-CCl4 injection in the liver, indicating that p21 activity is important for inhibiting pRb hyperphosphorylation during liver regeneration. Increases in levels of the pRb-related protein p107 were also detected in the p21–/– mouse livers between 36 and 72 h after CCl4 injection. Increased phosphorylation of members of the pRb family leads to the alleviation of repression and induction of genes required for S-phase progression such as Cyclin A (21DeGregori J. Kowalik T. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4215-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 22Nevins J.R. Leone G. DeGregori J. Jakoi L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Because Cyclin A promoter activity is regulated by pRb (23Knudsen K.E. Fribourg A.F. Strobeck M.W. Blanchard J.M. Knudsen E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27632-27641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we examined Cyclin A mRNA expression levels using quantitative real time PCR. In p21-deficient animals the increased phosphorylation and inhibition of pRb repressive functions corresponded with increased Cyclin A mRNA (Fig. 8B) and protein expression (Fig. 5). The increased levels of Cyclin A may contribute to the prolonged proliferation observed in the p21–/– liver during regeneration. Increased Apoptosis Counteracts Increased Proliferation in p21-deficient Mice—Although the lowest levels of necrosis were detected in p21-deficient mice, these animals had highest levels of hepatocyte proliferation during regeneration. In many different systems, expression of p21 has been correlated with an inhibition of apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 24Gartel A.L. Tyner A.L. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2002; 1: 639-649PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether apoptosis plays a role in regulating liver mass in p21-deficient mice, we used antibodies specific for activated caspase-3 to examine apoptosis in the livers of wild type and p21-deficient mice. Many hepatocytes were positive for activated caspase-3 in p21-deficient livers, but not in wild type livers, at 36 h post-CCl4 administration, when proliferation is at its peak (Fig. 9). Diffuse green staining in wild type liver sections represents background that is specific for the injured region of the liver lobule. Results obtained using three different wild type and p21-deficient mice from three independent experiments are presented in Fig. 9. We do detect some variability in the numbers of cleaved caspase-3-positive cells in the p21-deficient animals, which may be due in part to differences in metabolic activity in the liver arising from variations in feeding, because the animals have free access to food. Still, in all cases the p21-deficient mice have a significant increase in apoptotic cell number. Thus, in the absence of p21 there is more proliferation at 36 h post-CCl4 injection, but this proliferation is counteracted by an increase in programmed cell death. The liver is the largest gland in the body and the site where drugs and chemicals are metabolized. Toxins produced during metabolism may give rise to injury, but the healthy liver is capable of repairing itself. We explored the roles of p21 and p27 throughout the course of liver injury and repair following CCl4-induced liver injury, and we have determined the functions of the early and late peaks of p21 expression following CCl4 injection. The early peak of p21 expression promotes necrotic injury, and this is one of the first reports that suggests a role for p21 in necrosis. The later peak of p21 induction serves as a cell cycle checkpoint and inhibitor of cell proliferation during regeneration. For the most part, p27-deficient mice responded like wild type mice, although increased p21 expression in p27-deficient mice led to a slight increase in necrotic injury at 24 h (Fig. 2) and decreased proliferation at later time points (Fig. 6). Although animals of all three genotypes recovered from the liver injury, it appears that p21 plays a major role in regulating proliferation and cell viability following toxin-induced injury and subsequent regeneration. Although p21 expression was not detected in the uninjured liver, high levels were expressed within 3–6 h specifically in pericentral hepatocytes after CCl4 injection (13Serfas M.S. Goufman E. Feuerman M.H. Gartel A.L. Tyner A.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 951-961PubMed Google Scholar). In p21-deficient mice no significant aberrant proliferation was detected during the first 24 h post-CCl4 injection. However, p21-deficient animals displayed a marked decrease in the level of necrotic injury, indicating that p21 expression promotes necrosis. Disruption of the p21 gene did not lead to altered expression of CYP2E1, which plays an essential role in CCl4-induced necrosis. The mechanisms underlying the dependence of necrotic injury on induction of p21 remain unclear. The immediate early genes c-fos and c-myc are rapidly induced in the pericentral region before p21 is expressed following CCl4 injection (13Serfas M.S. Goufman E. Feuerman M.H. Gartel A.L. Tyner A.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 951-961PubMed Google Scholar), and the expression of these genes with opposing growth regulatory functions in the pericentral region may set the stage for ensuing events that lead to necrosis. To try to explore further the mechanism underlying regulation of necrosis, we isolated primary hepatocytes from wild type and p21-deficient mice and treated them with CCl4. However, these isolated hepatocytes did not respond like hepatocytes within the three-dimensional structure of the adult liver, and p21 was not induced in the cultured wild type cells in response to CCl4. It appears that a number of signals are provided by the complex liver architecture, and this system is not recapitulated in vitro. p21 expression decreased after 6 h post-CCl4 injection and was expressed at low levels until it was induced again from 36 to 72 h, coincident with the major phase of regenerative proliferation that occurs following toxin-induced injury. The second peak of p21 expression is consistent with a role for p21 as a cell cycle checkpoint protein and an inhibitor of cell proliferation following the initial wave of hepatocyte replication. We examined cell proliferation in wild type, p21–/–, and p27–/– mice during the course of CCl4-induced injury and repair. In all cases peak proliferation as measured by tritiated thymidine incorporation was detected at 36 h post-CCl4 injection. The highest numbers of proliferating cells were detected in p21–/– mice at all time points examined (Fig. 6). The extended time course of hepatocyte proliferation in animals lacking p21 at 48 and 72 h post-CCl4 injection was not observed following partial hepatectomy, after which accelerated early peak proliferation, but no prolonged proliferation, was observed in p21–/– female mice (25Albrecht J.H. Poon R.Y. Ahonen C.L. Rieland B.M. Deng C. Crary G.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2141-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). p21 expression was higher in p27–/– liver when compared with wild type livers at several time points examined, and p27-deficient animals had lowest levels of proliferation. We showed previously that p21 protein accumulates in the p27-deficient liver where it can inhibit hepatocyte proliferation (7Kwon Y.H. Jovanovic A. Serfas M.S. Kiyokawa H. Tyner A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41417-41422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). pRb and p107 have been shown to have overlapping functions in the developing liver (26Lee M.H. Williams B.O. Mulligan G. Mukai S. Bronson R.T. Dyson N. Harlow E. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1621-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). We observed increased levels of hyperphosphorylated pRb and increased expression of p107 post-CCl4 injection in the livers of p21 null mice. Hyperphosphorylation of pRb abrogates its growth-suppressive functions and disrupts its ability to bind members of the E2F family, leading to activation of a number of genes required for DNA synthesis (reviewed in Ref. 27Kaelin Jr., W.G. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 950-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Increased expression of Cyclin A would support the longer duration of DNA replication detected in p21–/– animals following CCl4 injury. Recently it was reported that expression of another E2F target gene, the Cdk-activating phosphatase Cdc25A, is higher in p21-deficient livers, and this may also contribute to the increased cell proliferation detected in p21–/– mice (28Jaime M. Pujol M.J. Serratosa J. Pantoja C. Canela N. Casanovas O. Serrano M. Agell N. Bachs O. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 1063-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We asked how liver mass is properly maintained in p21-deficient mice, which had the lowest levels of liver injury but highest levels of cell proliferation. By performing immunohistochemistry with antibodies specific for activated caspase-3, we found that livers from the p21-deficient mice had significantly higher levels of apoptosis, particularly during the peak of proliferation. Thus apoptosis is important for control of liver size in the face of too much cell proliferation during the course of liver regeneration. Many reports have indicated that p21 induction may inhibit apoptosis by a variety of mechanisms (reviewed in 24), and our data suggest an apoptosis inhibiting role for p21 in the liver. Increased E2F activity, which may occur as a consequence of disruption of the p21 gene, could contribute to increased apoptosis by a number of p53-dependent and independent mechanisms (reviewed in Refs. 29Phillips A.C. Vousden K.H. Apoptosis. 2001; 6: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 30Ginsberg D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 122-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 31Sears R.C. Nevins J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11617-11620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). It was reported recently (32Nahle Z. Polakoff J. Davuluri R.V. McCurrach M.E. Jacobson M.D. Narita M. Zhang M.Q. Lazebnik Y. Bar-Sagi D. Lowe S.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) that deregulation of E2F activity may directly contribute to the regulation of caspase expression. Increased apoptosis of hepatocytes during the proliferative phase of liver regeneration may also be regulated by environmental signals, as the liver is remodeled and there is an increased number of cells in an organ with restricted size as a consequence of p21 disruption. We have shown here that p21 plays a central role in regulating both proliferation and cell viability in the toxin-injured liver. The importance of counteracting excessive proliferation with increased cell death has been recognized as a necessary mechanism for preventing the development of cancer (33Evan G.I. Vousden K.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (2763) Google Scholar). We are currently investigating the susceptibility of p21-deficient mice to developing liver tumors after treatment with specific carcinogens. Both decreased and increased p21 expression have been correlated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (34Hui A.M. Kanai Y. Sakamoto M. Tsuda H. Hirohashi S.

Because of its abilities to regulate both proliferation and cell death, modulation of p21 activity following liver injury may have therapeutic benefits in patients with liver disease. We are indebted to Andrei Gartel, Nissim Hay, Jason Poole, and Robert Streit for helpful discussions and comments about the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1991680309,"The unselective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor S-flurbiprofen and its-in terms of COX-inhibition-""inactive"" enantiomer R-flurbiprofen have been previously found to inhibit tumor development and growth in various animal models. The underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, we show that both R- and S-flurbiprofen reduce survival of three colon cancer cell lines, which differ in the expression of COX-2 (HCT-15, no COX-2; Caco-2, inducible COX-2; and HT-29, constitutive COX-2). The IC50 for S- and R-flurbiprofen ranged from 250 to 450 microM. Both flurbiprofen enantiomers induced apoptosis in all three cell lines as indicated by DNA- and PARP-cleavage. In addition, R- and S-flurbiprofen caused a G1-cell cycle block. The latter was associated with an activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), an increase of the DNA binding activity of the transcription factor AP-1 and down-regulation of cyclin D1 expression. Western blot analysis, as well as supershift experiments, revealed that the AP-1 activation was associated with a change of AP-1 composition toward an increase of JunB. The JNK inhibitor SP600125 antagonized R- and S-flurbiprofen-induced AP-1 DNA binding, suppression of cyclin D1 expression, and the G1-cell cycle block. However, JNK inhibition had no effect on flurbiprofen-induced apoptosis. Hence, the cell cycle arrest is obviously mediated, at least in part, through JNK-activation, whereas R- and S-flurbiprofen-induced apoptosis is largely independent of JNK. Although in vitro effects of R- and S-flurbiprofen were indistinguishable, only R-flurbiprofen inhibited HCT-15 tumor growth in nude mice, suggesting the involvement of additional in vivo targets, which are differently affected by R- and S-flurbiprofen."
https://openalex.org/W2028884143,"The paradox of high substrate turnover occurring within the confines of a deep, narrow gorge through which acetylcholine must traverse to reach the catalytic site of acetylcholinesterase has suggested the existence of transient gorge enlargements that would enhance substrate accessibility. To establish a foundation for the experimental study of transient fluctuations in structure, site-directed labeling in conjunction with time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy were utilized to assess the possible involvement of the omega loop (Ω loop), a segment that forms the outer wall of the gorge. Specifically, the flexibility of three residues (L76C, E81C, and E84C) in the Cys69–Cys96 Ω loop and one residue (Y124C) across the gorge from the Ω loop were studied in the absence and presence of two inhibitors of different size, fasciculin and huperzine. Additionally, to validate the approach molecular dynamics was employed to simulate anisotropy decay of the side chains. The results show that the Ω loop residues are significantly more mobile than the non-loop residue facing the interior of the gorge. Moreover, fasciculin, which binds at the mouth of the gorge, well removed from the active site, decreases the mobility of 5-((((2-acetyl)amino)ethyl)amino)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid reporter groups attached to L76C and Y124C but increases the mobility of the reporter groups attached to E81C and E84C.

Curiously, catalysis shows high efficiency despite the cross-sectional dimension of acetylcholine is nearly equal to the width of the narrowest portion of the 20-Å-long and tortuous gorge leading to the catalytic center (Fig. 1A) (3Sussman J.L.

This paradox suggests the existence of an enlarged solution conformational state(s) of the active-center gorge. Molecular dynamics simulations support the existence of breathing or gating motions that could enhance substrate accessibility to the active site (8Gilson M.K. Straatsma T.P. McCammon J.A.

One segment of the gorge that may play a major role in gorge enlargement is the large Ω loop (defined by the Cys69–Cys96 disulfide bond) that corresponds to the activation loop (Cys60–Cys97) of Candida rugosa lipase, a related carboxyl esterase with an α,β-hydrolase fold (11Grochulski P.

Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 82-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic analysis of the apo form of this lipase shows the activation loop occluding the active site in the absence of substrate and folding backward allowing substrate access when lipid is bound. We previously demonstrated by examining the steady-state emission from selective acrylodan-labeled side chains that AChE-inhibitor binding induces distinctive conformational changes in certain regions of the mouse AChE Cys69–Cys96 Ω loop (13Shi J. Boyd A.E. Radic Z. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42196-42204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To determine whether the Cys69–Cys96 Ω loop could contribute to gorge enlargement, we used site-directed labeling with IAEDANS at various positions in conjunction with time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy to compare the backbone flexibility of three residues in the Ω loop (L76C, E81C, and E84C) with the flexibility of a residue in the active-site gorge, but not part of the Ω loop (Y124C). We also examined the influence of two inhibitors on conformational flexibility, one of which interacts directly with the Ω loop at the gorge entry (fasciculin), whereas the other (huperzine) associates with side chains of the loop near the gorge base. IAEDANS replaced acrylodan in this study, because it is conjugated more readily to active-site gorge residues than thioreactive fluorescein derivatives, and because its relatively long emission lifetime allows better resolution of whole body from local depolarization processes. Additionally, molecular dynamics simulations of side chain motions of the four individual residues where cysteine was substituted showed agreement with anisotropy decay parameters of the wild type (wt) enzyme. We found that the conjugated Ω loop residues were significantly more flexible than the non-loop residue. Also, the effects of the inhibitors were consistent with the flexibility of the Ω loop contributing to transient gorge enlargement that could enhance substrate accessibility and product egress. Materials—Acetylthiocholine iodide, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Ellman's reagent), and dithiothreitol were purchased from Sigma. (–)-Huperzine A was purchased from Calbiochem. 5-((((2-Iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)amino)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (IAEDANS) was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene OR). Fasciculin 2 (purified from the venom of Dendroaspis angusticeps) was a gift of Dr. Pascale Marchot (University of Marseille, France). Drs. Yacov Ashani and Bhupendra P. Doctor (Walter Reed Army Research Center, Washington, D. C.) kindly provided procainamide-linked Sepharose CL-4B resin. All other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available. Expression, Mutagenesis, and Purification of mAChE—Mouse AChE was produced by transfection of expression plasmid (pcDNA3, Invitrogen) containing an encoding cDNA where the AChE sequence was terminated at position 548. The plasmid was transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. Cells were selected with G418 to obtain stable producing cell lines, and AChE was expressed as a secreted soluble enzyme in serum-free media. Mutant enzymes were generated by standard mutagenesis procedures, and cassettes containing the mutation were subcloned into pcDNA3. Nucleotide sequences of the cassettes were confirmed by double-stranded sequencing to ensure that spurious mutations were not introduced into the coding sequence. Affinity chromatography using (m-aminophenyl) trimethyl ammonium linked through a long chain to Sepharose CL-4B resin (Sigma) permitted one-step purification of L76C, E81C, and E84C mAChE. Procainamide-linked Sepharose CL-4B resin was utilized in the purification of Y124C mAChE. From 4 to 6 liters of media, mutant and wild type enzyme were purified in quantities ranging between 5 and 25 mg (14Marchot P. Ravelli R.B. Raves M.L. Bourne Y. Vellom D.C. Kanter J. Camp S. Sussman J.L. Taylor P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 672-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Purity was ascertained by SDS-PAGE and by measurements of specific activity. IAEDANS Labeling—Mutant and wt enzymes were pretreated with 0.25 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at room temperature to ensure the introduced cysteine was in a reduced state. Dithiothreitol was removed by use of a G-50 Sephadex spin column (Roche Applied Science) equilibrated in 10 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 40 mm MgCl2, pH 8.0. IAEDANS (1 μl) at 100 times the enzyme concentration was slowly mixed with the enzyme to achieve approximately a 10-fold molar excess of IAEDANS to enzyme. Labeling was allowed to proceed for 12–16hat4 °C, and excess reagent was removed by fractionation on a Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated with 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7. Enzyme concentrations were determined from absorbance at 280 nm, ϵ = 1.14 × 105m–1 cm–1 (14Marchot P. Ravelli R.B. Raves M.L. Bourne Y. Vellom D.C. Kanter J. Camp S. Sussman J.L. Taylor P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 672-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Labeling stoichiometries were determined to be close to 1.0 from the ratio of absorption at 340 to 280 nm for the labeled enzymes. Because the absorption peak wavelength of IAEDANS at 340 nm, ϵ = 5.7 × 103m–1 cm–1, is close to that for the protein, these ratios only provide rough estimates of labeling. Specificity of labeling was assessed by comparison of areas under the fluorescence emission curves for IAEDANS-treated mutant with wild type enzymes. Steady-state Emission Spectra—Steady-state emission spectra were measured at room temperature using a Jobin Yvon/Spex FluoroMax II spectrofluorometer (Instrument S.A., Inc., Edison, NJ) with the excitation and emission bandwidths set at 5 nm. Time-resolved Fluorescence Anisotropy—Time-resolved emission anisotropy was monitored on time-correlated single photon-counting instrument. Its custom-built fabrication included an IBH (Edinburgh, UK) UV-NanoLED™ flash lamp run at 1 MHz and an IBH model TBX-04 photon detector. Vertically (I∥(t)) and orthogonally (I⊥(t)) polarized emission components were collected by exciting samples with vertically polarized light while orienting the emission polarizer (Polaroid HNP′B dichroic film) in either a vertical or orthogonal direction. Excitation and emission bands were selected with a Corning 7-60 interference filter and a Schott KV-450 nm cut-on filter, respectively. Typically, 2 × 104 peak counts were collected in 1–2 min when the emission polarizer was vertically oriented. The orthogonal emission decay profile was generated over the same time interval used to generate the vertical emission decay profile. Samples were held at 22 °C. To minimize convolution artifacts, flash lamp profiles were recorded by removing the emission filter and monitoring light scatter from a suspension of latex beads. The data analysis software corrected the wavelength-dependent temporal dispersion of the photoelectrons by the photomultiplier. The polarization bias (G) of the detection instrumentation was determined by measuring the integrated photon counts/6 × 106 lamp flashes that were detected while the samples were excited with orthogonally polarized light and the mission monitored with a polarizer oriented in the vertical and orthogonal direction (G = 0.9936). Emission anisotropy, r(t), is given by the expression shown in Equation 1, r(t)=I∥(t)-G·I⊥(t)I∥(t)+2G·I⊥(t)(Eq. 1) From this and the expression for the total emission, S(t), for a macroscopically isotropic sample, S(t)=I∥(t)+2G·I⊥(t)(Eq. 2) was deconvolved simultaneously from the individual polarized emission components expressed as shown in Equations 3 and 4, I∥(t)=S(t)3(1+2r(t))(Eq. 3) and I⊥(t)=S(t)3(1-r(t))(Eq. 4) Thus, both I∥(t) and I⊥(t) were determined by the same fitting functions, S(t) and r(t), and fitting parameters. Fluorescence lifetimes were determined by initially generating a total emission profile from I∥(t) and I⊥(t) with Equation 2, and then fitting this decay profile to a biexponential decay expression with the Globals Unlimited™ (Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics, Urbana, IL) software package. The resulting lifetimes were entered and fixed in the second step of the analysis process where I∥(t) and I⊥(t) were simultaneously analyzed for the parameters of S(t) and r(t) with the Globals Unlimited™ program. Here r(t) is a nonassociative anisotropy decay function as shown in Equation 5. r(t)=r0fxbexp(-t/ϕfast)+r0(1-fxb)exp(-t/ϕslow)(Eq. 5) where r 0 is the amplitude of the anisotropy at time 0; f xb is the fraction of the anisotropy decay associated with the fast decay processes, and ϕ is rotational correlation time of the anisotropy decay. Rotational correlation times are measured for the two (fast and slow) processes. This nonassociative model assumes that the rotational correlation times are common to each of the emission relaxation times. Goodness of fit was evaluated from the value of χ2 and visual inspection of the difference between the experimental data and the empirical anisotropy decay model. (It is worth noting that the observed r 0 values typically are less than the fundamental anisotropy of the reporter group (0.33). This most probably reflects the fact that the very fast depolarizing motions produced by tether arm movements are not resolvable by commercial instruments.) Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Anisotropy Decay—The decay of anisotropy because of side chain and segmental motions was simulated utilizing the approach developed by Ichiye and Karplus (15Ichiye T. Karplus M. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2884-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Specifically, the anisotropy decay of a fluorophore conjugated to a protein side chain was represented as the decay in the time correlation function shown in Equation 6, ρ(τ)=x003C;P2[μ^(t)·μ^(t-τ)]x003E;t(Eq. 6) where μ^ is a normalized vector properly chosen to represent the local motion being reported by the fluorophore. In our calculations, μ^ was chosen to be a normalized vector representing the direction that goes from the α-carbon to an atom near the tip of the wild type residue. To wit, for the glutamate residue, we used the average of the two normalized Cα–Oϵ vectors; for leucine, the normalized Cα–Hγ vector; and for tyrosine, the normalized Cα–OH vector. For this study, the previously reported 10-ns molecular dynamics simulation of the unliganded wt mAChE (16Tai K. Shen T. Borjesson U. Philippopoulos M. McCammon J.A. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 715-724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) was extended to afford a 15-ns trajectory. Frames (snapshots of the trajectory containing the coordinates of all the atoms) were calculated at 1-ps time intervals, and the rotational degrees of freedom were removed by superimposing all frames into a reference frame, minimizing the root mean squared deviations. With these trajectories on a nanosecond time scale, it was possible to simulate anisotropy decay due to just the combination of side chain and segmental motions; deconstruction of the vectors to resolve the side chain and the segmental motions was not attempted. Characterization of Labeled Mutants—Acetylthiocholine hydrolysis kinetics of the cysteine-substituted mutants were shown previously to be similar to the wt enzyme suggesting that all mutant enzymes fold correctly despite the presence of the substituted cysteines (13Shi J. Boyd A.E. Radic Z. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42196-42204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, the specific labeling for each mutant was estimated to be 71–80%, 89–93%, 79–80%, and 74–84% for L76C, E81C, E84C, and Y124C, respectively. Substrate and inhibitor recognition by the IAEDANS-labeled mutants is evident from both fasciculin (1.3 μm) and huperzine (4 μm) producing greater than 95% inhibition of the rate of acetylthiocholine hydrolysis (data not shown). This is not surprising, because previous kinetic studies showed that k on and k off of fasciculin were unaltered in the cysteine mutants (17Boyd A.E. Marnett A.B. Wong L. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22401-22408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the absence of ligand, the emission maxima of the four IAEDANS-labeled mutants were similar ranging between 482 and 489 nm (Table I). The active-site ligand, (–)-huperzine A, a herbal alkaloid used in Chinese traditional medicine, binds at the base of active-site gorge and should have no direct interaction with all cysteine-conjugated sites based on the x-ray crystal structure of the huperzine-AChE complex (Fig. 1C) (18Raves M.L. Harel M. Pang Y.P. Silman I. Kozikowski A.P. Sussman J.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Huperzine only affected the steady-state emission properties of the E81C- and E84C-labeled mutants, red shifting the emission maxima 5 and 7 nm and decreasing the relative quantum yields by 18 and 23%, respectively (Table I). This pattern suggests that the huperzine increases the polarity of the microenvironment around the Glu81 and Glu84 but not around the Leu76 and Tyr124 side chains.Table IEffect of huperzine and fasciculin on steady-state emission parameters of IAEDANS-labeled mouse AChEEmission maxima (nm)aThe excitation wavelength was 340 nm.Relative quantum yieldbRelative quantum yields were determined by comparison of areas under the emission spectra of each labeled mutant in the absence of ligand with its spectra in the presence of the indicated ligand.

Open table in a new tab Fasciculin, a peptidic peripheral site inhibitor that caps the mouth of the active-site gorge, influences the microenvironment of the substituted positions in a complex manner. The crystal structure of fasciculin-mAChE complex shows hydrogen bonding between the guanidino moieties of Arg11 and Arg37 in fasciculin and the carbonyl oxygens of Glu84 and Leu76 on the AChE, respectively (Fig. 1D) (4Bourne Y. Taylor P. Marchot P. Cell. 1995; 83: 503-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Met33 of fasciculin also is in close proximity but not “in van der Waals contact” with Tyr124 in the AChE. The largest spectral changes were observed with the labeled Y124C mutant where fasciculin blue-shifted the emission maxima 13 nm and increased the relative quantum yield by 55% (Table I). A similar pattern was seen with the L76C conjugate, but the blue shift was 7 nm, and the relative quantum yield enhancement was 11%. The emission properties of E81C- and E84C-labeled mutants were much less affected by fasciculin binding; the emission maxima were red-shifted 3 and 2 nm, and the relative intensities were decreased by 10 and 3%, respectively (Table I). These results indicate that fasciculin dramatically decreased the polarity around the reporter groups attached to Y124C and to a lesser extent around L76C. Also, fasciculin slightly increased the polarity around the reporter groups attached to E81C and E84C, which is qualitatively the result found using acrylodan instead of IAEDANS (13Shi J. Boyd A.E. Radic Z. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42196-42204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Emission and Anisotropy Decay—For brevity, just the parallel and perpendicular emission decay profiles of one labeled mutant (E84C) along with the corresponding anisotropy decay profile are illustrated in Fig. 2. The total emission decay profiles (S(t), Equation 2) of all the mutants were best fit to a three-exponential decay function whose geometric averaged lifetimes are summarized in Table II and ranged from 10.0 to 14.6 ns.

Open table in a new tab Anisotropy decay profiles for the IAEDANS conjugates, with the exception of the labeled Y124C mutant complexed to fasciculin, were well fit by a nonassociative biexponential model (Equation 5). These profiles are illustrated in Fig. 3, and the best fit parameters are summarized in Table II. Except for the huperzine-bound E84C mutant, the processes associated with the “slow” rotational correlation times accounted for 60–80% of the total resolvable anisotropy decay, and the values of these rotational correlation times ranged between 69 and 132 ns (Table II). This range of values is greater than what might be predicted from a protein with 547 amino acids and three N-linked oligosaccharides of average mass determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry. However, sedimentation equilibrium measurements for this protein correlate best with a molecular mass of 122,000 Da, suggesting that at higher concentrations the molecule may form a reversibly associating dimer. 2D. Comoletti, unpublished observations. The longest emission lifetimes (18.2–27.9 ns) are long enough to allow estimation of a global rotational correlation time. The crystal structure shows mAChE to have limited dimensional asymmetry so only a single rotational correlation would be resolvable. Because faster emission decay step(s) are also present, deconvolution of components of the intermediate and slow phase is subject to uncertainty. Consequently, slow internal fluctuations contributing to the decay rate cannot be ruled out. For the case of huperzine-bound E84C mutant, the ϕslow values ranged between 80 and 260 ns. This broader range of values probably reflects a greater uncertainty in ϕslow measurements when the slow decay processes represent a small fraction of the total resolvable anisotropy decay, as was the case for the huperzine-bound E84C mutant (31%; Table II). Comparison of the fast anisotropy decay components of the apo form of the labeled mutants show two features. First, reporter groups attached to substituted cysteines whose native side chains in the crystal structure project into the active-site gorge (L76C and Y124C) are less mobile than reporter groups attached to Ω loop-substituted cysteines located on the outer surface of the enzyme (E81C and E84C). This conclusion is seen in the time 0 anisotropy and f xb/ϕfast values (Table II). The time 0 anisotropy values (r 0), which likely reflect very fast and unresolvable tether-arm motions (19Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic and Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 321-345Crossref Google Scholar, 20Gangal M. Cox S. Lew J. Clifford T. Garrod S.M. Aschbaher M. Taylor S.S. Johnson D.A.

A. 1999; 96: 12394-12399Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), are higher for the L76C (0.27) and Y124C (0.28) than the E81C (0.25) and E84C (0.25) labeled mutants (Table II). This would suggest, not surprisingly, greater hindrance to the tether-arm movements of the gorge-residing residues. The f xb/ϕfast values of reporter groups attached to the residues that project into the gorge are smaller (L76C, 0.07 and Y124C, 0.05) than the f xb/ϕfast values of reporter groups that are on the outer surface of the enzyme (E81C, 0.13 and E84C, 0.15; Table II). Because the f xb /ϕfast ratio is on the time scale of backbone motions and can be analyzed in terms of the diffusion rate in a “diffusion-in-a-cone model” (22Kinosita Jr., K. Kawato S. Ikegami A. Biophys J. 1977; 20: 289-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar), these results indicate that the ranking of segmental mobility of the residues examined is as follows: E84C > E81C ≫ L76C > Y124C. The second feature that emerges from a comparison of the fast anisotropy decay parameters, r 0 and f xb/ϕfast, is that the reporter groups attached to the substituted cysteines in the Cys69–Cys96 Ω loop (L76C, E81C, and E84C) are more mobile than the reporter group attached to the non-Ω loop residue (Y124C) (Table II). Ligand Binding and Anisotropy Decay—The influence of huperzine and fasciculin on the anisotropy decay parameters of the labeled mutants studied is complex and ligand-dependent. Huperzine, which should not interact with the modified Ω loop residues (Fig. 1C), selectively increased the mobility of just the labeled E81C and E84C residues without affecting the mobility of the labeled L76C or Y124C residues. This is evidenced in the f xb/ϕfast values of the labeled-E81C and E84C mutants that increased upon huperzine binding from 0.13 to 0.18 and from 0.15 to 0.25, respectively (Table II; Fig. 3). The fact that the fluctuations of just the E81C and E84C were perturbed, and not L76C in the Ω loop, is indicative of a lack of conformational coupling between Leu76 and Glu81/Glu84 positions in the Ω loop. Hence, the Ω loop does not behave as a rigid flap. Consistent with the crystal structure showing fasciculin hydrogen bonding (from the guanidino moi"
https://openalex.org/W2097431266,"DNA mismatch repair (MMR) couples recognition of base mispairs by MSH2·MSH6 heterodimers to initiation, hundreds of nucleotides away, of nascent strand 3′-5′ or 5′-3′ excision through the mispair. Mismatch-recognition complexes have been hypothesized to move along DNA to excision-initiation signals, in eukaryotes, perhaps ends of nascent DNA, or to remain at mismatches and search through space for initiation signals. Subsequent MMR excision, whether simple processive digestion of the targeted strand or tracking of an excision complex, remains poorly understood. In human cell-free extracts, we analyzed correction of a mismatch in a 2.2-kilobase pair (kbp) circular plasmid containing a pre-existing excision-initiation nick for initiation, and measured MMR excision (in the absence of exogenous dNTPs) at specific locations. Excision specificities were ∼100:1 for nicked versus continuous strands, 80:1 for mismatched versus homoduplex DNA, and 30:1 for shorter (0.3-kbp) versus longer (1.9-kbp) nick-mispair paths. To test models for recognition-excision coupling and excision progress, we inserted potential blockades, 20-bp hairpins, into nick-mispair paths, using a novel technique to first generate gapped plasmid. Continuous strand longer-path hairpins did not affect mismatch correction, but shorter-path hairpins reduced correction 4-fold, and both together eliminated it. Shorter-path hairpins had little effect on initiation of (3′-5′) excision, measured 30–60 nucleotides 5′ to the nick, but blocked subsequent progress of excision to the mismatch; longer-path hairpins blocked the (lower level) 5′-3′ excision to the mismatch. Thus, (a) MMR excision protein(s) cannot move past DNA hairpins. Hairpins at both ends of substrate-derived 0.5-kbp DNA fragments did not prevent ATP-induced dissociation of mismatch-bound human MSH2·MSH6, so recognition complexes at mismatches might provoke excision at nicks beyond hairpins, or loosely sliding MSH2·MSH6 dimers might move to the nicks.

Evolutionarily conserved prokaryotic and eukaryotic mismatch-repair (MMR) 1The abbreviations used are: MMR, mismatch repair; hMutsα, human MSH2·MSH6 protein heterodimers; hMutLα, human MLH1·PMS2 protein heterodimer; dsDNA, double-strand DNA; ssDNA, single-strand DNA; nt, nucleotides; kbp, one thousand DNA base pairs; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen. systems promote genomic stability by correcting DNA replication errors, antagonizing homeologous recombination between diverged DNA sequences, and responding to a variety of DNA lesions (for reviews, see Refs. 1Buermeyer A.B.

The Escherichia coli pathway, fully reconstituted from purified proteins, provides a mechanistic paradigm. Here, MutS homodimers bind to DNA mismatches and MutH proteins recognize hemi-methylated d(GATC) sequences, transitory consequences of a brief post-replication delay in GATC-adenine methylation of nascent DNA, to thus provide the two requisite specificity elements for correction. Interaction of MutL homodimers with MutS-mismatch complexes activates DNA-strand nicking of nascent DNA at unmethylated d(GATC) sites. DNA helicase II (UvrD protein) loads at the nick if and only if MutS, a DNA mismatch, and MutL are present; one or more steps in this chain of events require ATP hydrolysis. UvrD presumably separates strands to facilitate excision of the nicked strand toward and beyond the mismatch, by one of several 3′-5′ or 5′-3′ ssDNA-specific exonucleases, depending on the nick-mismatch orientation. Gap filling by the replicative DNA polymerase III holoenzyme and DNA ligation follow. In eukaryotes, mismatches are recognized by heterodimers with different specificities: base mismatches, and one or two looped-out extra nucleotides by MSH2·MSH6 and a range of extrahelical loopouts by MSH2·MSH3 in most eukaryotes (1Buermeyer A.B. Deschenes S.M. Baker S.M. Liskay R.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 533-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 2Harfe B.D. Jinks-Robertson S. Annu. Rev.

Dev. 2000; 10: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), a subset of base-base mismatches by an additional MSH2·MSH7 in plants (4Culligan K. Hays J.B. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 991-1002PubMed Google Scholar). The high similarity between MutS and its eukaryotic homologs suggests conservation of the biochemistry of MMR initiation. In contrast, although MutL-homolog MLH1·PMS2 (MLH1·PMS1 in yeast) heterodimers are required for mismatch correction, neither homologs of UvrD or MutH, nor of any ssDNA-specific exonucleases, have been implicated in eukaryotic MMR. This suggests less evolutionary conservation of post-recognition mechanisms. The absences of DNA-adenine methylation and, apparently, of MutH orthologs, indicate that different nascent-DNA features, perhaps leading-strand 3′ ends and lagging-strand 3′ or 5′ ends, are used to strand-specifically initiate excision toward the mismatch. In mammalian cell extracts, mismatches provoke initiation of excision at pre-existing nicks or gaps in exogenous DNA substrates, with high efficiency and specificity (5Holmes J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 6Iams K. Larson E.D. Drummond J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30805-30814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Despite the apparent divergence of mechanisms of MMR excision, numerous partial-reaction studies with purified proteins suggest general conservation of the initial steps involving MutS and MutL homologs. However, the mechanism by which mismatch-recognition is coupled to site-specific initiation of excision remains controversial. In one class of coupling models, mismatch-bound MutS/MSH dimers are postulated to bind ATP and then to move away along the DNA contour, searching for excision-initiation signals either by ATP hydrolysis-dependent translocation (7Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich M. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 14: 4467-4470Crossref Scopus (268) Google Scholar), or by ATP binding-dependent diffusional sliding, with hydrolysis occurring later (8Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Or searching might be performed by more elaborate sliding complexes, to which other proteins have been recruited (25Bowers J. Tran P.T. Joshi A. Liskay R.M. Alani E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 957-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), Alternatively, MutS homolog proteins complexed with MutL homolog proteins and ATP are proposed to remain at or near mismatches, where they use DNA looping to search through space for excision initiation signals (9Junop M.S. Obmolova G. Rausch K. Hsieh P. Yang W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 10Schofield M.J. Nayak S. Scott T.H. Du C. Hsieh P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28291-28299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Mechanisms of subsequent progressive excision are poorly understood, especially in eukaryotes. Most simply, an exonuclease might progressively digest one strand of dsDNA, as does the 5′-3′ activity of eukaryotic exonuclease I, which has been firmly implicated in MMR (11Genschel J. Bazemore L.R. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13302-13311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 12Wei K. Clark A.B. Wong E. Kane M.F. Mazur D.J. Parris T. Kolas N.K. Russell R. Hou Jr., H. Kneitz B. Yang G. Kunkel T.A. Kolodner R.D. Cohen P.E. Edelmann W. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). No similar eukaryotic 3′-5′ exonuclease has been linked to MMR, but the recent observation that aphidicolin inhibits 3′-5′ excision points to exonucleases integral to the DNA replication polymerase ϵ and δ (13Wang H. Hays J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26143-26148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Remarkably, recent reports show exonuclease I to be required for both 5′-3′ and 3′-5′ excision in MMR in cell-free extracts (11Genschel J. Bazemore L.R. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13302-13311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Other mechanisms might involve DNA helicases that track along either strand and/or the DNA binding activities of MutLα (14Hall M.C. Wong H. Erie D.A. Kunkel T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, internal DNA structures that can block protein movement might interfere with coupling of mismatch recognition to initiation of excision, and/or progress of excision toward the mismatch. We have used two recently described techniques (13Wang H. Hays J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26143-26148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 15Wang H. Hays J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26136-26142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) to investigate both coupling of mismatch recognition to initiation of excision and the subsequent excision process. First, we have employed our new method for production of gapped circular plasmids (16Wang H. Hays J.B. Mol. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) to create multiple gaps, into which we ligated not only mismatch-creating oligomers, but also other oligomers containing DNA hairpins, which might be expected to (a) block translocation of putative searching complexes and/or (b) impede progress of excision, in either case preventing mismatch correction. We also measured excision, near the nicks and elsewhere, to distinguish between case a, where no excision would be initiated, and case b, where it would be initiated but blocked before reaching the mismatch. We find a hairpin in the shorter nick-mismatch path to severely inhibit mismatch correction, but not initiation of excision; however, excision proves unable to continue past the hairpin. Plasmids—Plasmid pUC19Y was previously derived (15Wang H. Hays J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26136-26142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) from pUC19 by removal of all recognition sequences for the sequence-specific nicking endonucleases N.BstNBI (5′-GAGTCNNNN↓) and N.AlwI (5′-GGATCNNNN↓). Further modification by standard techniques generated plasmids pUC19ASP, pUC19PPH, pUC19PA, and pUC19APH (Fig. 1, A–D). Unprimed positions refer to the bla sense strand, and primed coordinates to the antisense strand; base pair 1/1′ is the first C/G in the EarI endonuclease recognition site. Positions of incision sites for sequence-specific endonucleases refer to immediately preceding (5′) nucleotides. All four new plasmids contain a site at position 23 for nicking endonuclease N.Bpu10I (5′-GC↓TNAGG), new N.AlwI nicking sites at positions 331 and 361, and a XhoI endonuclease site at position 339, overlapping a near site for endonuclease HindIII (Figs. 1 and 2). Each plasmid encodes one or more sites in the antisense strands, for nicking endonuclease N.BstNBI: unique sites at position 499′ in pUC19ASP; four sites in pUC19PPH, at 160′, 190′, 469′, and 499′; two in pUC19PA, 160′ and 190′; and two in UC19APH, 469′ and 499′.Fig. 2MMR substrates. Substrates containing indicated mismatches, hairpins, and nicks were constructed from plasmids pUC19ASP (A), pUC19PPH (B), pUC19PA (C), and pUC19APH (D), as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and designated s19ASPgt, s19PPHgtdhp, s19PAgtshp, and s19APHgtlhp, respectively. The G/T mismatch is in a sequence such that correction in favor of G (excision of nicked strand) restores a site for endonuclease XhoI, and correction in favor of T (excision of continuous strand) restores a HindIII site. The site for AseI endonuclease, and the location of position 1/1′, shown for substrate A, are the same in all substrates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Construction of Substrates—After the four plasmids described above were digested with endonuclease N.AlwI, the 30-nt oligomers between nicks were removed by heating to 85 °C and reannealing to room temperature, over roughly 60 min, in the presence of a 50-fold excess of a synthetic oligomer complementary to the displaced 30-mer. Gapped plasmids were then purified by benzoylated-naphoylated-DEAE cellulose (BND-cellulose) chromatography, as described previously (16Wang H. Hays J.B. Mol. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We ligated oligomer XHMM30a, 5′-ACGTAAGCTTCGAGGTGAATAGGATCATCG, into the N.AlwI gaps to create T/G mismatches (T) whose correction to C/G or T/A would yield a site for XhoI (CTCGAG) or HindIII endonuclease (AAGCTT), respectively, and purified the resulting supercoiled substrates, correspondingly designated s19ASPgt, s19APHgt, s19PPHgt, and s19PAgt. We used endonuclease N.Bpu10I to singly nick s19ASPgt, generating substrate A (Fig. 2). We doubly nicked s19APHgt with endonuclease N.BstNBI and, as described above, created a new N.BstNBI gap in the potential longer nick-mispair path, into which we ligated oligomer HP1, designed to form a hairpin (underlined; 20-bp stem, (CC) loop): 5′-TCTATGCGACGTTAAGGCTGCTACCCTTCTGCCGT(CC)ACGGCAGAAGGGTAGCAGCCCATGGAGAGTCGCTC. The supercoiled product, s19APHgtlhp, was then singly site-specifically nicked with endonuclease N.Bpu10I to produce substrate D (Fig. 2). We similarly inserted hairpin-forming oligomer HP1 into a N.BstNBI gap in the potential shorter nick-mispair path, forming s19PAgtshp, after which N.Bpu10I nicking yielded substrate C (Fig. 2). To produce doubly gapped molecules from substrate s19PPHgt, we digested exhaustively with endonuclease N.BstNBI, removed the 30-nt oligomers by heating and reannealing as described above, and isolated putative doubly gapped (quadruply nicked) products by BND-cellulose chromatography. To remove any DNA containing one or no gaps, we digested with endonuclease HpaI, whose only sites are in the potential gap regions and that cannot cleave ssDNA, then treated with exonuclease V to destroy any linear dsDNA. We ligated oligomer HP1 into both N.BstNBI gaps and purified the covalently closed product, designated s19PPHgtdhp. Single nicking with endonuclease N.Bpu10I yielded substrate B (Fig. 2). To prepare the homoduplex control substrate s19A-SPhm from pUC19ASP, we proceeded as described for substrate A, except that the 30-nt oligomer inserted created a G/C base pair instead of a mismatch, then singly N.Bpu10I-nicked the product, s19ASPgc. To prepare the hairpin-containing homoduplex substrate s19PAgcshp, we ligated oligomer HP1 into a single N.BstNBI gap, producing plasmid pUC19PAgcshp. Although no nicked substrate (analogous to A, B, C, and D and HMA) was derived from pUC19PAgcshp, we designate it HMC in Fig. 6 and in the associated text, for convenience. Verification of Hairpin Structures by Gel Electrophoresis—We used endonucleases AflIII and BglII to cut at the respective unique sites in substrates s19ASPgc (HMA), s19ASPgt (A), s19PPHgtdhp (B), s19PAgtshp (C), s19APHgtlhp (D), and s19PAgcshp (HMC) (for convenience, non-nicked substrates are given here the same designations as the mismatched (A, B, C, and D) or homoduplex (HMA, HMC) substrates generated from them by N.Bpu10I nicking, as described above under “Construction of Substrates”). Double cleavage with endonucleases AflIII and BglII at positions 511 and 22, respectively, generated two products: a larger ABL fragment (1.7 kbp), identical among all substrates; smaller ABS fragments (0.48 kbp) containing one (ABS-C, ABS-D, and ABS-HMC), two (ABS-B), or no (ABS-A and ABS-HMA) hairpins, as shown in Fig. 3 (left panel). Treatment with DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment (3′ exo–), in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP only, radiolabeled the 3′ recessed ends generated by endonuclease AflIII, presumably with equal specific activities. After phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, resuspended fragments were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 5% native polyacrylamide-gel (acrylamide:bisacrylamide at 37.5:1) and autoradiography (Fig. 3, right panel). Mismatch-Repair Reactions in HeLa Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts were prepared from HeLaS3 cells (purchased from the National Cell Culture Center, Minneapolis, MN), as previously described (15Wang H. Hays J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26136-26142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In brief, proteins were extracted with 0.15 m salt from nuclei released from cells broken by homogenization, then precipitated with ammonium sulfate. Standard MMR mixtures (15 μl) contained 100 ng of indicated substrates, 100 μg of nuclear extract, and 0.75 μg of bovine serum albumin, plus the following components at the indicated concentrations: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1.5 mm ATP, 1 mm glutathione, four dNTPs, each 0.1 mm, 5 mm MgCl2, 110 mm KCl. Mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 12 min unless otherwise indicated. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 30 μl of stop solution (25 mm Na2EDTA, 0.67% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 90 μg/ml proteinase K). After further incubation of mixtures at 37 °C for 15 min, DNA was extracted twice with an equal volume of phenol, and then precipitated with ethanol. DNA was resuspended in H2O and digested with 2 units of AseI endonuclease, plus 2 units of endonuclease HindIII or XhoI, as indicated, and 1 μg of RNase A, at 37 °C for 2 h in 15 μl of digestion buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Digested products were separated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels made in 1× TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, 2 mm EDTA). Correction of G/T mismatches to G/C restores a site for XhoI endonuclease, which thus cuts substrates already linearized by AseI endonuclease into 0.9- and 1.3-kbp fragments. DNA bands were visualized by staining with ethidium bromide, then imaged with UVP ImageStore 7500 and analyzed using ImageQuant software. Repair yield equals the ratio of the summed intensities of the 0.9- and 1.3-kbp fragments to the total of this sum plus the intensity of the 2.2-kbp band corresponding to singly cut (uncorrected) DNA. Analysis of Excision Gaps—To freeze excision gaps generated during MMR, exogenous dNTPs were omitted from a standard reaction mixture containing nicked mismatched-DNA substrate or various control substrates. After incubation at 37 °C for 7 min, DNA was extracted and precipitated as described under “MMR Reactions in HeLa Nuclear Extracts,” and digested at 37 °C for 2 h with 4 units of AhdI endonuclease plus 1 μg of RNase A in 15 μlof AhdI digestion buffer (20 nm Tris acetate, pH 7.9, 50 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). After addition of 0.5 pmol of a particular 32P-labeled oligomer probe (Fig. 5), the mixture was incubated at 85 °C for 5 min, then slowly cooled down to room temperature. Probes annealed to substrates were separated from free oligomers by electrophoresis in 1.2% agarose gels in 1× TAE buffer. After ethidium-stained DNA bands from agarose gels were measured quantitatively, as described under “Mismatch-Repair Reactions in HeLa Nuclear Extracts,” gels were dried and the radioactivity in each sample measured by phosphorimaging. Dye-intensity measurements of bands from agarose gels were used to normalize radioactivity measurements for any variations in DNA recovery and loading. Purification of hMutSα and Analysis of Electrophoretic Mobility Shift—Human hMutSα protein heterodimers were prepared essentially as described (17Wang H. Lawrence C.W. Li G.-M. Hays J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16894-16900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 30–65% ammonium sulfate fraction from HeLaS3 nuclear extracts was passed through a single-stranded DNA cellulose column and fractions were subsequently eluted with 1 mm ATP, then chromatographed on a 1-ml Pharmacia HR 5/5 Mono Q column. Purified hMutSα was made 1.0 mg/ml in bovine serum albumin and 10% (w/v) in sucrose, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining showed the purified protein to be nearly homogeneous (>98% pure). For mobility shift analyses, 1 μg (∼0.9 pmol) each of potential (not yet nicked) substrate DNA was treated with endonucleases AflIII and BglII and radiolabeled, essentially as described above under “Verification of Hairpin Structures by Gel Electrophoresis” (and again designated HMA, HMC, and A, B, C, D, for convenience), but with the following changes. Products were immediately separated by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel (without ethidium bromide); respective 0.48-kbp ABS fragments were cut out of the gels and recovered using a gel-extraction kit (Qiagen) as recommended by the manufacturer, after a narrow slice of each sample gel was stained with ethidium bromide to locate the fragments. Radiolabeling of 3′-recessed AflIII and BglII ends employed equal DNA inputs, measured by PicoGreen (Molecular Probes, Inc.) fluorescence, plus PolI Klenow (3′ exo–) and 0.2 μm [α-32]dCTP and [α-32P]dTTP, plus 16.7 μm dATP and dGTP, to ensure that little ssDNA remained at the ends; specific radioactivities were nearly identical among the five ABS fragments. DNA samples were extracted with phenol, precipitated, and resuspended in TE buffer. Equal amounts of ABS fragments (determined by radioactivities) were used for band-shift analyses. Binding reactions (25 μl) contained 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 110 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4% glycerol, 0.25 pmol of purified hMutSα, 6 fmol (2 ng) of 32P-labeled ABS fragments, and 125 ng of a 1-kbp DNA ladder (catalog number 15615-016, Invitrogen) as nonspecific competitor. Mixtures were either incubated on ice for 15 min without ATP; or ATP (200 μm) was added after 10 min and incubation continued on ice for 5 min. After addition of 5 μl of 50% sucrose, mixtures were immediately loaded onto a 5% polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed at 6 V/cm in TBE buffer (89 mm Tris boric acid, 2 mm EDTA) with cooling. Protein-DNA complexes and free DNA were visualized by autoradiography after gel drying, and quantified by phosphorimaging. Construction and Verification of Substrates—To test effects of internal DNA-hairpin structures on initiation and excision phases of mismatch correction, we constructed substrates A, B, C, and D in three stages (Figs. 1 and 2). First, we generated gaps at specific locations in circular substrates and ligated mismatch-creating oligomers into them. Second, we generated additional gaps, either on one side of the mismatch, or on the other side, or on both sides, and ligated hairpin-forming oligomers into the gaps. Finally, we specifically nicked the non-hairpin strand at an asymetrically located point, such that one hairpin site would be in a shorter nick-mismatch excision path and the other hairpin site in a longer-path. To incorporate hairpins into mismatch-repair substrates, we needed to anneal into gaps 72-nt oligomers that formed intramolecular stem-loop structures without significant intermolecular dimerization. When we tested three different 72-mers with different 42-nt hairpin structures and/or different flanking sequences, two of them mostly formed self-dimers under the annealing conditions tested, but the third (oligomer HP1) reproducibly formed a single structure with an electrophoretic mobility consistent with an intramolecular hairpin (data not shown). The respective sequences do not suggest any obvious explanation for this interesting phenomenon. The 20-bp stem is identical to one of several open-end cruciform or Y structures previously placed at the ends of mismatched linear DNA (10Schofield M.J. Nayak S. Scott T.H. Du C. Hsieh P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28291-28299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and shown to prevent dissociation of bacterial MutS proteins from mismatched oligomers, even in the presence of ATP. We ligated oligomer HP1 into gapped circular plasmids and purified the supercoiled products, which were, as expected, resistant to endonuclease HpaI, the site for which is interrupted by the hairpin. The hairpin-containing structure remained mostly (>90%) supercoiled for at least 12 min at 37 °C in the HeLa nuclear extracts under standard mismatch-correction conditions, indicating that the hairpin was not cleaved or nicked. We considered it essential to verify the structure and purity of the hairpin- and mismatch-containing structures, which had been prepared by a technically demanding multistep process. To that end, we cleaved the substrates with endonuclease AflIII at position 511, 20 bp right of the right-hand hairpin site, and with endonuclease BglII at position 22, 153 bp left of the left-hand hairpin site, generating the same 1.7-kbp ABL fragment from all substrates, plus 0.48-kbp ABS fragments containing the respective mismatch and hairpin features (Fig. 3, left panel). We then 32P-labeled the 3′-recessed AflIII ends and separated the fragments by electrophoresis in native 5% acrylamide gels (1:37.5 bisacrylamide:acrylamide), as shown in Fig. 3 (right panel). The ABS-HM and ABS-A fragments from the no-hairpin homoduplex and G/T substrates migrated the fastest (lanes HMA and A). The hairpin near the right-hand end of fragment ABS-D retarded it slightly (lane 5), whereas the more interior left-hand hairpin retarded fragment ABS-C more dramatically (lane 4); fragment ABS-B, containing both hairpins, was retarded the most (lane 3). No detectable amounts of other structures were identified, and the sharpness of the ABS-B, ABS-C, and ABS-D bands suggests that the hairpins are stable, i.e. do not migrate as a mixture of partially unwound molecules or other structures, even though one hairpin is only 20 bp from the open end. Correction of Mismatches in Hairpin-containing Substrates—In all substrates, mismatch correction via removal of the continuous strand (restoration of HindIII sites) was negligible (Fig. 4, lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7). This confirms the nick requirement for initiation of MMR excision and the absence of adventitious nicks. We previously observed a plateau in mismatch correction after 10 min at 37 °C when the mispair-nick separation was 0.15 kbp (15Wang H. Hays J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26136-26142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Here we measured correction yields (restoration of XhoI sites) after 12 min (Fig. 4, lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8). The 65% yield for the non-hairpin substrate A (Fig. 4, lane 2) remained constant up to 30 min (data not shown). The yield for the longer-path hairpin substrate D was not significantly lower (Fig. 4, lane 8). However, the shorter-path hairpin reduced the yield for substrate C to only 18% (Fig. 4, lane 6), and both hairpins virtually abolished repair of substrate B. Interestingly, extension of the incubation to 25 min increased the yield for substrate C to 27%; further incubation up to 40 min had no effect (data not shown). Differential Effects of Hairpins on Initiation and Progress of MMR Excision—The levels of excision gaps generated at various positions during 7 min incubation in nuclear extracts at 37 °C were measured by binding of specific short radiolabeled ssDNA oligonucleotide probes (F"
https://openalex.org/W2134869717,"Two counteracting processes determine accumulation of human vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in atherosclerotic lesions: cell proliferation and apoptosis. SMCs synthesize insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which potently inhibits apoptosis. The terminal complement complex C5b-9 interacts with SMCs in early human atherogenesis. In this study, we investigated whether C5b-9 may activate the IGF-1 system in SMCs, resulting in the inhibition of SMC apoptosis. C5b-9 generation on SMCs in vitro markedly reduced CD95-mediated apoptosis as assessed by flowcytometric analysis of annexin V binding and in caspase 3 assays. C5b-9 induced both significant IGF-1 release and up-regulation of IGF-1 binding sites in SMCs. Immunoneutralization of IGF-1 with a monoclonal IGF-1 antibody abolished the antiapoptotic effects of C5b-9. We conclude that C5b-9 inhibits apoptosis in SMCs by inducing an autocrine IGF-1 loop. This mechanism may contribute to the accumulation of SMCs in early human atherosclerotic lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2045342417,"Coordination between the nucleotide-binding site and the converter domain of myosin is essential for its ATP-dependent motor activities. To unveil the communication pathway between these two sites, we investigated contact between side chains of Phe-482 in the relay helix and Gly-680 in the SH1-SH2 helix. F482A myosin, in which Phe-482 was changed to alanine with a smaller side chain, was not functional in vivo. In vitro, F482A myosin did not move actin filaments and the Mg2+-ATPase activity of F482A myosin was hardly activated by actin. Phosphate burst and tryptophan fluorescence analyses, as well as fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements to estimate the movements of the lever arm domain, indicated that the transition from the open state to the closed state, which precedes ATP hydrolysis, is very slow. In contrast, F482A/G680F doubly mutated myosin was functional in vivo and in vitro. The fact that a larger side chain at the 680th position suppresses the defects of F482A myosin suggests that the defects are caused by insufficient contact between side chains of Ala-482 and Gly-680. Thus, the contact between these two side chains appears to play an important role in the coordinated conformational changes and subsequent ATP hydrolysis.

Thus, the contact between these two side chains appears to play an important role in the coordinated conformational changes and subsequent ATP hydrolysis. Myosin is an actin-based motor, which converts chemical energy liberated by the ATP hydrolysis into directed movement of actin filaments. Myosin head consists of a globular motor domain and an extended α-helical carboxyl-terminal domain (so-called “lever arm domain”), to which two light chains bind. In the currently prevailing swinging lever arm model for the mechanism of force generation, the lever arm domain tilts relative to the motor domain while the motor domain is bound to an actin filament, resulting in net displacement between actin and myosin backbone (1Cooke R.

Structural changes in myosin motor domain during ATP hydrolysis were investigated by x-ray crystallography using crystals of motor domains bound to different nucleotide analogs (6Smith C.A.

One is called “open state,” because the nucleotide-binding pocket is open. Another is called “closed state,” because the nucleotide-binding pocket is closed. Intensive spectroscopic studies using several nucleotides and nucleotide analogs showed that the open state corresponds to M†·ATP and the closed state corresponds to M*·ATP and M*·ADP·Pi (Scheme I), where the dagger (†) represents the quenched fluorescence and the asterisk (*) represents the enhanced fluorescence of conserved Trp-501 (amino acid residue numbers are of Dictyostelium myosin II throughout this article) (16Malnasi-Csizmadia A.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12727-12737Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Comparison of the structure of the open state with the closed state demonstrated a substantial conformational change during ATP hydrolysis (18Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 19Sablin E.P. Fletterick R.J. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Namely, the converter region rotates by about 70° and the lever arm swings concomitantly. This shows that the converter region communicates with the nucleotide-binding site, although the two regions are apart. How do the two regions communicate with each other? At least two communication pathways are suggested. One is through the interaction between the relay helix and the converter (15Dominguez R. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. Cohen C. Cell. 1998; 94: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Recently, Sasaki et al. (21Sasaki N. Ohkura R. Sutoh K. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 90-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have provided clear evidence for this interaction. They have shown that disruption of a hydrophobic linkage between Ile-499 in the relay helix and the converter region uncouples the converter swing from the ATP hydrolysis cycle. They have also shown that disruption of a hydrophobic linkage between Phe-692 in the SH1-SH2 helix and the converter region uncouples alike (21Sasaki N. Ohkura R. Sutoh K. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 90-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The second candidate for the communication pathway is through the interaction between the relay helix and the SH1-SH2 helix (22Houdusse A. Kalabokis V.N. Himmel D. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Cell. 1999; 97: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 23Houdusse A. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11238-11243Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In this paper we investigated the latter possibility, namely communication from the relay helix to the SH1-SH2 helix. The small conformational change of the switch region at the open-closed transition is accompanied by a rotational movement of the relay helix around its axis (14Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 15Dominguez R. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. Cohen C.

Cell. 1999; 97: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1a). The rotational movement of the relay helix is accompanied with a contact between several side chains in the relay helix and the SH1-SH2 helix. In this paper we focused analyses to the contact between the side chain of Phe-482 in the relay helix and the side chain of Gly-680 in the SH1-SH2 helix. This contact is observed only in the closed structure (6Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 14Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that this contact plays an important role in the closed structure. Specifically, we hypothesized that this contact is one of the central mechanisms by which the nucleotide-binding site communicates with the converter region (Fig. 1b). To examine this hypothesis, we changed Phe-482 of Dictyostelium myosin II to alanine whose side chain is much smaller than the side chain of phenylalanine (F482A mutant) and examined whether this mutation abolished the transmission of conformational changes. We also made the F482A/G680F double mutant to see if the G680F mutation rescued the defect of the F482A mutant. Our results have clearly shown that the contact between Phe-482 and Gly-680 mediates communication between the nucleotide-binding site and the converter region and is essential for the conformational change and the subsequent ATP hydrolysis in myosin. Reagents—N-Methylanthraniloyl derivatives of 2-deoxy-ADP (mant-ADP) was obtained from Molecular Probes (Portland, OR). Restriction enzymes and modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). EDTA, EGTA, DTT, 1The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; GFP, green fluorescent protein. and ATP were purchased from Wako Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). Protease inhibitors and phalloidin were purchased from Sigma. Construction and Expression of Mutant Myosin and S1—Mutations of F482A and G680F were made by site-directed mutagenesis using ExSite PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The sequences of the oligonucleotides used to create the mutations were 5′-GCAATTTGCTAATCACCATATGTTCAAATTGGAACAAG-3′ and 5′-TGGAGTTTTTCATTGGTATAATTGATACATAATTG-3′ for F482A, and 5′-TTCGTATTACGCGTAAAGGT-3′ and 5′-TTCCTTCGAGGACAAAATTG-3′ for G680F. G680V myosin was kindly provided by B. Patterson. Double mutant myosins (F482A/G680F and F482A/G680V) were made by inserting the BglII/NcoI-digested fragment (0.64-kb) of G680F or G680V into BglII/NcoI-digested pMyDap (24Egelhoff T.T. Manstein D.J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 18773-18780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After purification, all myosins were phosphorylated using bacterially expressed myosin light chain kinase that carried a T166E mutation (29Smith J.L. Silveira L.A. Spudich J.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6075-6083Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), according to the method of Ruppel et al. (27Ruppel K.M. Uyeda T.Q. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18773-18780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of each myosin was checked by urea-SDS-glycerol polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (27Ruppel K.M. Uyeda T.Q. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18773-18780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant and wild-type S1 were prepared by the method of Manstein and Hunt (30Manstein D.J. Hunt D.M. J.

Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). The concentrations of actin, S1, and myosin were determined spectrophotometrically using extinction coefficients of 0.62 cm2/mg at 290 nm for actin (33Gordon D.J. Yang Y.Z. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7474-7479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 0.80 cm2/mg at 280 nm for S1 (26Uyeda T.Q. Tokuraku K. Kaseda K. Webb M.R. Patterson B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9525-9534Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and 0.53 cm2/mg at 280 nm for myosin (27Ruppel K.M. Uyeda T.Q. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18773-18780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Vitro Motility Assay—Movement of F-actin labeled and stabilized by rhodamine-phalloidin over nitrocellulose surfaces coated with phosphorylated myosin was observed at 24 °C according to the method described by Uyeda et al. (34Uyeda T.Q. Kron S.J. Spudich J.A. J. Mol. Chem. 1990; 214: 699-710Google Scholar). Phosphorylated myosin in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 250 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT was mixed with 0.5 mg/ml (final concentration) of rabbit skeletal muscle F-actin and incubated on ice for 10 min. After an addition of 2 mm ATP, the mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C and 200,000 × g to remove denatured myosin that bound irreversibly to actin (35Kron S.J. Toyoshima Y.Y. Uyeda T.Q. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). After centrifugation, the supernatants were introduced into a chamber having a depth of 0.12–0.17 mm. Before introduction of F-actin labeled with rhodamine-phalloidin, myosin-coated flow cells were treated with unlabeled F-actin and Mg2+-ATP to block residual denatured myosin. The velocities were determined by measuring displacements of smoothly moving actin filaments over a period of 4 s. Concentrations of myosin solutions used on the surfaces were 0.3–0.5 mg/ml for wild-type and F482A/G680F myosins because smooth movements of actin filaments were observed within this concentration. For F482A myosin, motility assay was carried out at concentrations between 0.3 and 2.0 mg/ml. ATPase Assays—Steady state ATPase activities were determined by measuring released phosphate using the method of Kodama et al. (36Kodama T. Fukui K. Kometani K. J. Biochem. 1986; 99: 1465-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) under the conditions described by Ruppel et al. (27Ruppel K.M. Uyeda T.Q. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18773-18780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures for the assay of basal Mg2+-ATPase activity contained 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 25 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, and 0.13 mg/ml S1. The reaction mixtures for the assay of actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity contained 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 25 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, and 0.1 mg/ml myosin with F-actin. The reactions were started by the addition of ATP and performed at 30 °C. Cosedimentation Assays in the Presence of ATP—The affinity of S1 for actin in the presence of ATP was measured using cosedimentation assays as described previously (37DasGupta G. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1836-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 38Giese K.C. Spudich J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8465-8473Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Phalloidin-actin (3 μm) and S1 at concentrations of 1.5–15 μm were mixed in the assay buffer (25 mm Hepes, 25 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT) and incubated at 22 °C for 10 min before adding 3 mm ATP and spinning at 200,000 × g for 10 min. Pellets were resuspended in the assay buffer, and the concentration of S1 was determined by scanning Coomassie Blue-stained gels using an EPSON GT-7000S image scanner and by analyzing the band densities using the NIH Image software. Transient Kinetic Experiments—All kinetic experiments were done in 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT at 22 °C using a KinTek SF-2001 or an Applied Photophysics SX18MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer. Release of mant-ADP from acto-S1 was monitored by the decrease of its fluorescence accompanying dissociation of mant-ADP from the acto-S1·mant-ADP complex (39Murphy C.T. Spudich J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6738-6744Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Mant-ADP was excited at 295 nm and emission was observed after passing through a 389-nm cutoff filter. Acto-S1·mant-ADP complex was mixed with excess ATP to suppress the reassociation of mant-ADP to S1. The concentration of S1, mant, ADP, and actin stabilized by phalloidin and ATP was 1 μm, 2.5 μm, and 5 μm, and 4 mm, respectively. The decrease in mant fluorescence was fitted to a single exponential, which expresses a k –AD. Dissociation of acto-S1 by ATP was monitored through changes in fluorescence intensities of pyrene-labeled actin stabilized by phalloidin. The concentration of acto-S1 was 0.5 μm. Pyrene-actin was excited at 365 nm and the fluorescence was detected after passing through a 389-nm cutoff filter (40Batra R. Geeves M.A. Manstein D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6126-6134Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Tryptophan Fluorescence—Tryptophan fluorescence spectra of 0.2 mg/ml S1 were recorded at room temperature using a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer in a medium containing 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 25 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm DTT and in the presence and absence of 0.1 mm ATP. Excitation wavelength was 293 nm. Tryptophan fluorescence spectra of completely denatured proteins were also recorded after treating them in 6 m guanidine HCl, and normalized each other to confirm that the observed difference in the tryptophan fluorescence arose from conformation change. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)—FRET assays were done as described previously (41Suzuki Y. Yasunaga T. Ohkura R. Wakabayashi T. Sutoh K. Nature. 1998; 396: 380-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Initial Burst in ATP Hydrolysis—The initial burst of phosphate liberation from ATP was measured at 23 °C using the method of Kodama et al. (36Kodama T. Fukui K. Kometani K. J. Biochem. 1986; 99: 1465-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures for the assay of Mg2+-ATPase activity contained 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 25 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.3 mm ATP, and 3 μm S1. After 15, 30, 45, or 60 s of incubation, the ATPase reaction was stopped by adding perchloric acid. The size of the initial phosphate burst was determined by extrapolating to zero time. A straight line was drawn by linear regression. Phenotypes of Dictyostelium Cells Expressing Mutant Myosins—Dictyostelium myosin II-null cells could not undergo normal cytokinesis and grew only slowly in suspension culture up to the density of ∼1 × 106 cells/ml, becoming multinucleated cells (Fig. 2, Null). This is consistent with previous reports (42Sasaki N. Shimada T. Sutoh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20334-20340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 43DeLozanne A. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 44Manstein D.J. Ruppel K.M. Spudich J.A. Science. 1989; 246: 656-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). When a plasmid containing the wild-type myosin gene was introduced into the myosin II-null cells, they regained the ability to undergo cytokinesis and grow in suspension up to a density of ∼2 × 107 cells/ml with a doubling time of 11 h (Fig. 2, WT). The growth curve of the transformed cells was almost the same as that of wild-type cells having an endogenous copy of the myosin heavy chain gene. However, myosin II-null cells expressing F482A myosin could not grow in suspension (Fig. 2, F482A), suggesting that F482A myosin is not functional. We reasoned that if this functional defect of F482A myosin is caused by the lack of the collision between the side chains of Ala-482 and Gly-680, it should be possible to rescue this defect by changing Gly-680 to an amino acid having a larger side chain that would touch Ala-482. Indeed, myosin II-null cells expressing F482A/G680F myosin could divide and grow in suspension culture up to the density ∼2 × 107 cells/ml with a doubling time of 11 h (Fig. 2, F482A/G680F). This result demonstrates that doubly mutated F482A/G680F myosin is functional and the G680F mutation suppressed the defect of the F482A mutant. In contrast, myosin II-null cells expressing F482A/G680V myosin could not grow in suspension culture (Fig. 2, F482A/G680V), indicating that the G680V mutation could not suppress the defect of the F482A mutant. This result suggests that there is a minimum size of the side chain at this position to suppress the F482A mutation. Myosin II is also required for the development of fruiting bodies (45Springer M.L. Patterson B. Spudich J.A. Development. 1994; 120: 2651-2660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Myosin II-null cells were arrested at the mound stage (Fig. 3, Null) under the starvation condition, whereas myosin II-null cells expressing wild-type myosin II made fruiting bodies (Fig. 3, WT). When F482A myosin was expressed in myosin II-null cells, it did not suppress the defect of the phenotype of myosin II-null cells (Fig. 3, F482A), consistent with the results of growth experiments in suspension culture. In contrast, myosin II-null cells expressing F482A/G680F myosin made fruiting bodies, although they had slightly deformed sorocarps (Fig. 3, F482A/G680F). Thus, the experiments of the development of fruiting bodies confirmed that F482A myosin is non-functional and F482A/G680F myosin is functional. ATPase Activities—Yields and purities of all the recombinant myosins and S1s prepared were almost the same as those of wild-type. Basal Mg2+-ATPase in the absence of actin of F482A S1 was similar to that of wild-type S1 (Table I). Addition of 24 μm actin to wild-type myosin enhanced its Mg2+-ATPase activity by 15-fold. However, the Mg2+-ATPase of F482A myosin was hardly activated by actin (only 1.2-fold activation in the presence of 24 μm actin). In contrast, Mg2+-ATPase activity of F482A/G680F myosin was activated up to 25-fold by 24 μm actin.Table ISteady-state ATPase activitiesMg2+-ATPaseMg2+-ATPase + 24 μm actinWT0.17 ± 0.022.5 ± 0.3F482A0.11 ± 0.010.13 ± 0.006F482A/G680F0.054 ± 0.011.4 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab V max and K app values of the actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase of the mutant myosins were determined from the dependence of the activation on actin concentration (Fig. 4). Each value shown in Fig. 4 is net actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity obtained by subtracting the basal-Mg2+-ATPase activity from the measured value of the actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase. V max of wild-type, F482A, and F482A/G680F myosin were 2.7 s–1, 0.025 s–1, and 1.5 s–1, respectively, and K app were 5.1, 0.79, and 2.2 μm, respectively. In Vitro Motility Assays—As expected from the phenotype of cells expressing F482A myosin, F482A myosin could not drive the sliding of actin filaments in vitro (Fig. 5). Although actin filaments attached to the F482A myosin-coated surface in the absence of ATP, the majority of the actin filaments dissociated on addition of ATP. Some stayed near the surface and exhibited random, lateral motion without making noticeable unidirectional axial movement. Up to 2.0 mg/ml F482A myosin did not move actin, whereas 0.3 mg/ml wild-type myosin caused continuous actin movement (see also “Experimental Procedures”). Addition of methylcellulose to the motility assay buffer reduces the critical concentration of surface density of myosin necessary for the actin movement (34Uyeda T.Q. Kron S.J. Spudich J.A. J. Mol. Chem. 1990; 214: 699-710Google Scholar, 46Uyeda T.Q. Warrick H.M. Kron S.J. Spudich J.A. Nature. 1991; 352: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), but F482A myosin did not slide actin filament even in the presence of 0.8% methylcellulose. For F482A/G680F, continuous and unidirectional movements of actin filaments were observed, although the speeds were only 1/70 of that of wild-type myosin. To examine if mutant myosins have a braking effect on the actin motility supported by wild-type myosin, we performed mixing experiments in which wild-type myosin was mixed with equal amounts of mutant myosins (Fig. 5). The speed of the actin sliding movements by the mixture of wild-type myosin and the F482A/G680F was significantly lower than that by wild-type myosin alone. In contrast, F482A myosin did not block the actin sliding movement powered by wild-type myosin at all. Interaction with Actin in the Absence of ATP—One possible explanation for the defect of F482A myosin is that F482A myosin cannot bind to actin filaments, because the ATPase activity of F482A myosin was scarcely activated by actin and F482A myosin did not impede actin sliding movement generated by wild-type myosin. To test this possibility, actin binding properties of F482A myosin were investigated by actin cosedimentation assays (Fig. 6). Wild-type myosin, F482A myosin, and F482A/G680F myosin efficiently co-sedimented with actin in the absence of ATP, but did not in the presence of ATP. Thus F482A myosin exhibited normal ATP-dependent dissociation-association with actin filaments even though it had lost its actin-activated ATPase activity. When F482A S1 was mixed with pyrene-labeled actin, the pyrene fluorescence decreased, like wild-type S1 (data not shown). These results suggest that F482A myosin can bind to actin strongly in the absence of ATP, like wild-type myosin. Affinity with Actin in the Presence of ATP—Varying concentrations of S1 were cosedimented with 3 μm actin in the presence of 3 mm ATP, and the amounts in the pellets were determined by scanning SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 7A). The curve fitting showed that the K d value (dissociation constant for actin binding) of wild-type S1 in the presence of ATP is 14 μm, which is similar to the previously reported value (38Giese K.C. Spudich J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8465-8473Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The K d value of F482A/G680F doubly mutated S1 (17 μm) is similar to that of wild-type S1. In contrast, the K d value of F482A S1 is 42 μm, which is 3-fold higher than that of wild-type S1, showing that the affinity of F482A S1 for actin in the presence of ATP is much lower than that of wild-type S1. ADP Dissociation from Acto-S1—To delineate the biochemical defects underlying the incapability of the F482A mutant to be activated by actin, we measured several kinetic parameters of F482A S1 using a stopped-flow apparatus. First, dissociation of ADP from acto-S1 was followed by monitoring the decrease in fluorescence of mant-ADP accompanying dissociation of mant-ADP from the acto-S1·mant-ADP complex upon addition of excess ATP. The dissociation rate constant of mant-ADP from acto-F482A S1 (k –AD) was 60 ± 5 s–1 (Table II). That value is about half of that of wild-type S1 (123 ± 12 s–1). In contrast, k –AD of F482A/G680F S1 was 3.1 ± 0.2 s–1, which is only 1/40 of that of wild-type S1. The slower actin sliding movement by F482A/G680F myosin (1/70 of that of wild-type myosin) is largely explained by this lower k –AD.Table IITransient kinetic analysisRate constantWTF482AF482A/G680FIn the presence of actink +2 (s-1)aValues are averages ± S.D. of 10-18 independent measurements from at least two independent protein preparations.196 ± 12285 ± 30231 ± 22K 1 k +2 (m-1s-1)bDetermined as described in Fig. 8.1.4 × 1054.0 × 1053.0 × 105K 1 (m-1)cCalculated from K 1 k +2 and k +2.71014001300k -ad (s-1)aVa"
https://openalex.org/W2165086262,"Nitric oxide (NO) inhibits both actively induced and transferred autoimmune encephalomyelitis. To explore potential mechanisms, we examined the ability of NO to inhibit migration of T lymphoblasts through both collagen matrices and monolayers of rat brain endothelial cells. The NO donor 1-hydroxy-2-oxo-3, 3-bis (2-aminoethyl)-1-triazene (HOBAT) inhibited migration in a concentration-dependent manner. NO pretreatment of T cells inhibited migration through untreated endothelial cells, but NO pretreatment of endothelial cells had no inhibitory effect on untreated T cells. Therefore NO's migration inhibitory action was mediated through its effect on T cells and not endothelial cells. HOBAT did not inhibit migration by inducing T-cell death but rather by polarizing the T cells, resulting in a morphology suggestive of migrating cells. P70S6 kinase, shown to have a role in NO-induced migration inhibition in fibroblasts, had no role in the inhibitory effect of NO on T-cell migration. Thus, HOBAT did not alter p70S6K activity nor did rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of p70S6K, inhibit HOBAT-induced T-cell morphological changes or T-cell migration. We suggest that NO-induced morphological changes result in T cells with predefined migratory directionality, thus limiting the ability of these cells to respond to other migratory signals."

Despite these major conformational changes, the overall secondary structure content did not appear to be strongly altered and ANX12 remained largely helical. Thus, Ca2+-independent membrane interaction leads to massive refolding but not unfolding.

Moss S.E. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 331-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar). Their high degree of conservation, the lethality of some ANX knockout mice (2Srivastava M. Atwater I. Glasman M. Leighton X. Goping G. Caohuy H. Miller G. Pichel J. Westphal H. Mears D. Rojas E. Pollard H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13783-13788Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and the emerging class of ANX-related diseases (annexinopathies) indicate that ANXs play important roles in vivo (3Rand J.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 1035-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Many membrane-related functions have been proposed for the different ANXs, including roles in membrane trafficking and fusion, ion channel formation, and cell adhesion (1Gerke V. Moss S.E. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 331-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar). The likely importance of membrane interaction for ANX function has spurred general interest in attempting to understand the various modes and mechanisms by which ANXs interact with membranes. Recently it has become clear that ANXs can have at least two separate modes of membrane interactions: one is Ca2+-dependent whereas the other one is Ca2+-independent. Of these two forms, the Ca2+-dependent membrane interaction has been investigated most extensively and it has been shown that Ca2+ induces peripheral membrane binding of ANXs. According to electron microscopy (EM) (4Lambert O. Gerke V. Bader M.F. Porte F. Brisson A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 42-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), atomic force microscopy (5Reviakine I. Bergsma-Schutter W. Brisson A. J. Struct.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22453-22457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) analyses, the picture emerges that the structure of this membrane-bound form is closely related, but presumably not completely identical, to that of soluble ANXs. For example, EM and atomic force microscopy studies revealed a clear domain organization with overall shapes and dimensions that are similar to those observed in the x-ray structures of the soluble forms. As illustrated with the x-ray structure of “soluble” ANX12 in Fig. 1, ANXs typically contain four highly homologous repeats, each of which is made up of a 4-helical bundle (helices A, B, D, and E) and a fifth helix (helix C) that runs perpendicular to the bundle (Fig. 1). The arrangement of these domains results in a somewhat curved molecule that contains a concave and a convex side (see Fig. 1). It is believed that Ca2+-dependent membrane binding is mediated by loop regions between helices A and B, and between D and E located on the convex side of ANXs. However, because of a lack of high-resolution structural information in the presence of phospholipid bilayers, it is not clearly understood to what extent this membrane interaction induces subtle conformational changes. Although ANXs were originally believed to be strictly Ca2+-dependent membrane-binding proteins, in recent years there has been mounting evidence of additional ANX-membrane interactions that do not appear to be mediated by Ca2+. Numerous reports have demonstrated that certain cell types have a substantial pool of ANXs that cannot be removed from membranes with Ca2+-chelating agents. Presently, it is not fully understood what factors confer this Ca2+-independent membrane localization of ANXs. However, Ca2+-independent membrane interactions of ANXs can be induced in vitro by triggers such as lowering the pH (8Kohler G. Hering U. Zschoring O. Arnold K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8189-8194Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 9Sokolov Y. Mailliard W.S. Tranngo N. Isas M. Luecke H. Haigler H.T. Hall J.E. J. Gen.

A. 1998; 95: 14060-14065Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Structural information for this type of membrane interaction came initially from SDSL analysis of a helical hairpin region of soluble ANX12 (D-E helical hairpin in repeat 2, Fig. 1). Upon pH-dependent membrane interaction, it was shown that this region undergoes a major inside-out refolding, resulting in the formation of a transmembrane helix that lines an aqueous cavity (11Langen R. Isas J.M. Hubbell W.L. Haigler H.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14060-14065Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These data could have important physiological implications as they demonstrate that soluble ANX12 can be reversibly converted into a transmembrane protein that appears to have the structural architecture of an ion channel. The notion of an ion channel-like structural reorganization of membrane-inserted ANX12 has since been confirmed through biochemical and electrophysiological analyses (10Isas J.M. Cartailler J.P. Sokolov Y. Patel D.R. Langen R. Luecke H. Hall J.E. Haigler H.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3015-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, the full extent to which conformational changes is not yet clear, because the original SDSL nitroxide scan characterized the structure of less than 10% of the protein. To address this question and to compare the overall structure and fold of ANX12 in solution and its different membrane-bound states, we used a combination of methods. Membrane insertion was probed using biochemical methods. We used circular dichroism (CD) for global secondary structural analysis and SDSL (for review see Hubbell et al. (12Hubbell W.L. Cafiso D.S. Altenbach C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar)) to test for specific domain movements and reorganization. For the latter, we introduced pairs of cysteines at the interface of domains I and IV (residues 77 and 265) or at the interface of domains II and III (residues 113 and 241) (see Fig. 1). These cysteines were then labeled with a thiol-specific reagent to give the nitroxide-containing side chain R1 (Fig. 2). Because two spin labels located less than 25 Å from each other results in characteristic dipolar broadening of the EPR line shapes, the two doubly labeled derivatives of ANX12 (α-carbon distances are 8.3 and 8.8 Å, respectively) are sensitive indicators by which to evaluate overall structure and inter-domain packing interactions. Using this combined approach, we present new evidence that pH (ranging from 7.4 to 4.5) in the absence of phospholipids, did not affect the overall secondary structure of ANX12, and that inter-domain interactions appeared to remain largely unchanged. Similarly, Ca2+-dependent membrane interaction did not appear to cause major alterations in the overall structure, although the inter-domain contacts appeared to become somewhat tighter and more rigid than they had been in solution. In contrast, interactions with membranes resulted in major domain reorganization at all pH values at which Ca2+-independent ANX-membrane binding occurred. Despite these large scale conformational changes detected by site-directed spin labeling, the overall amount of secondary structure remains similar based on CD measurements. Thus, Ca2+-independent membrane insertion must result in large scale protein refolding rather than nonspecific unfolding. In an effort to understand how membrane insertion could be triggered in vivo, we investigated factors that modulate Ca2+-independent membrane interactions. We found that Ca2+-independent membrane interaction was strongly modulated by phospholipid composition and required major protein refolding. For example, ANX12 bound to cardiolipin (CL)-containing vesicles in a Ca2+-independent manner at near neutral pH. Together with the finding that ANX12 rapidly inserts into membranes, these data raise the interesting possibility that Ca2+-independent membrane interaction could occur in vivo, where it could be triggered either by transient changes in pH and/or changes in lipid composition.

The Clontech method was used to introduce additional mutations into A77C to create the double mutant A77C/K265C. The Cys-113 S241C mutant was created by removing the small NcoI/EcoRI fragment from S241C and replacing it with the small NcoI/EcoRI fragment of ANX12 pSE420-mrp33H, which contained the endogenous Cys-113 (13Schlaepfer D.D.

The following preparations of lipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL): phosphatidylserine (PS, bovine brain, catalog number 840037), phosphatidylcholine (PC, egg yolk, catalog number 850355), and cardiolipin (bovine heart, catalog number 840012). Large unilammelar vesicles of the following composition (weight/weight) were prepared according to the Reeves/Dowben protocol (16Reeves J.P. Dowben R.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1969; 73: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar): PS/PC (2:1), CL/PC (2:1), and 100% PC. For CD experiments the aforementioned vesicles were extruded through a 100-nm membrane. Unless otherwise indicated, the standard EPR experiments were performed using ∼30 μg of spin-labeled ANX12 in 100 mm buffer at the appropriate pH (sodium acetate for pH 4.0–5.5, MES for pH 6.0–6.5, and Tris-HCl for pH 7.4) in either the presence or absence of phospholipid vesicles. For rapid kinetic measurements, membrane interaction was initiated at room temperature by mixing labeled ANX12 (30 μm) with an equal volume of vesicles (approximately 30 mm phospholipid), both equilibrated in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer at the indicated pH. For Ca2+-independent membrane association the general co-pelleting protocol was followed. Briefly, 30 μg of protein was incubated with 1 ml of buffer (pH 4–7.4, as described above) plus 1 mm EGTA and 600 μg of phospholipid vesicles. Thus, the final concentration of ANX12 was ∼1 μm resulting in a protein to lipid ratio of ∼1:1000. The sample was incubated for 10 min at room temperature and vesicles along with bound protein were pelleted by centrifugation. In certain experiments at neutral pH, binding of ANX12 was induced by Ca2+ (1 mm). EPR experiments were recorded ∼5 min after the sample was prepared. EPR Spectroscopy—X-band EPR spectra were obtained using a Bruker EMX spectrometer (fitted with a loop-gap resonator or the ER4119 HS cavity). Kinetics were obtained using a rapid mixing device connected to a Varian E-109 spectrometer fitted with a loop-gap resonator (7Langen R. Isas J.M. Lueke H. Haigler T.H. Hubbell W.L. J. Biol.

Scan width for EPR spectra was 150 gauss. For a quantitative distance analysis, one needs to evaluate the extent to which the magnetic dipolar interaction results in line broadening (for review see Refs. 12Hubbell W.L. Cafiso D.S. Altenbach C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar and 19Freed J.H. Spin Labeling Theory and Applications. Academic Press, New York1976Google Scholar). For this purpose, it is necessary to obtain spectral information from a reference state that lacks this magnetic dipolar interaction. We obtained this reference information using proteins that were labeled with R1 in the presence of a large excess of its non-paramagnetic analogue, R1′ (Fig. 2). This recently developed approach (15Berliner L.J. Grünwald J. Hankovszky H.O. Hideg K. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 450-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) is advantageous, because single cysteine mutants are no longer required; and, because of the similarity of R1 and R1′ their structural effects are likely to be similar. Assuming random labeling, the majority of all R1-labeled proteins would contain only one paramagnetic label; therefore, the EPR spectra would be dominated by EPR signals that are free of magnetic dipolar interaction. The EPR spectra obtained for the proteins labeled under these conditions are shown to be normalized to the same amount of paramagnetic label. Here, distances were evaluated using software kindly provided by Drs. Altenbach and Hubbell (20Altenbach C. Oh K.-J. Trabaino R.J. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15471-15482Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). This approach is based on Pake broadening functions that are applicable in the slow motion regime. Because of the high effective viscosity of the bilayers, this condition readily applies to membrane-bound ANXs. In aqueous solution, this method allows distance determination to approximately <18 Å given the ANX12 molecular weight of 35,000 (20Altenbach C. Oh K.-J. Trabaino R.J. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15471-15482Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Co-pelleting and 125I-TID Experiments—Ca2+ and pH-dependent binding of ANX12 to phospholipid vesicles were evaluated in a co-sedimentation assay followed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining as previously described (21Patel D.R. Jao C.C. Mailliard W.S. Isas J.M. Langen R. Haigler H.T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7054-7060Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). ANX12 bound to CL/PC vesicles was labeled with probe 3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl)diazirine (125I-TID) and evaluated exactly as described previously (10Isas J.M. Cartailler J.P. Sokolov Y. Patel D.R. Langen R. Luecke H. Hall J.E. Haigler H.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3015-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), except that the incubations were performed at 37 °C instead of 25 °C. Circular Dichroism—CD spectra were obtained using a Jasco-810 spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic Company, Tokyo, Japan). Routinely, 10–50 scans were recorded and averaged between 190 and 260 nm. Samples were prepared using the same protein to lipid ratio as used in the EPR and co-pelleting studies and contained 1 μm ANX12 in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 4.5 or 7.4) and, if indicated, 1 mm lipid. These conditions are therefore very similar to those used for the EPR and co-pelleting studies except for the omission of the sedimentation step. The phosphate buffer was chosen for the CD experiments because of its smaller absorbance at low wavelengths. Aside from the poor signal to noise ratio between 190 and 200 nm, nearly identical spectra were obtained at pH 4.5 using the sodium acetate buffer (data not shown). All spectra were recorded using a 1-mm optical path length quartz cell and background corrected for turbidity using appropriate protein-free samples. The buffers were the same as listed above. Membrane and pH-dependent Changes in ANX12 Conformation—Previous studies showed that ANX12 exists in three structural forms: a soluble monomer, a Ca2+-dependent peripheral membrane-bound trimer at neutral pH, and a Ca2+-independent transmembrane form at mildly acidic pH (11Langen R. Isas J.M. Hubbell W.L. Haigler H.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14060-14065Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We have taken a combined CD and SDSL approach to probe for structural differences between these three forms. First, we asked whether pH alone, in the absence of membranes, could result in structural changes. As shown in Fig. 3, the CD spectra of ANX12 in the absence of lipid at pH 7.4 and 4.5 (green and black, respectively) are superimposable and exhibit two minima at 208 and 222 nm, as expected for a highly helical structure. Thus, the overall secondary structure content of ANX12 in aqueous solution does not seem to be affected by changes in pH alone. Next, we asked how this structural content was affected by the presence of PS- and CL-containing vesicles, with which ANX12 interacts at moderately acidic pH values (also see below). Binding to these vesicles under the conditions used was confirmed by co-sedimentation and EPR analysis (data not shown). Again, we found that the overall structural content was largely unaffected. This result was quite surprising, given the fact that major conformational changes were observed for a selected region (Fig. 1, blue repeat D–E helical hairpin) that had previously been studied by SDSL (11Langen R. Isas J.M. Hubbell W.L. Haigler H.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14060-14065Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To determine whether structural changes induced by membrane interaction are merely localized, or whether large scale refolding occurs that ultimately results in a very different structure with similar helical content, we employed an SDSL approach. As described in the Introduction, we prepared two different mutants of ANX12, each of which contained a pair of R1-labeled cysteine residues introduced across the interface between domains I/IV (77R1/265R1) and II/III (113R1/241R1), as defined by the crystal structure of the soluble form of ANX12 (22Luecke H. Chang B.T. Mailliard W.S. Schlaepfer D.D. Haigler H.T. Nature. 1995; 378: 512-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). By monitoring distances between these pairs of spin labels, we were able to determine whether global conformational differences existed between the various states of ANX12. Fig. 4 (ADGJ, black traces) shows the EPR spectra of these two spin-labeled mutants of ANX12 in solution. As expected from the x-ray structure (Fig. 1), the EPR spectra for both 113R1/241R1 and 77R1/265R1 at pH 7.4 in solution indicate close proximity of the spin-labeled sites (Fig. 4, A and G, black trace). Such close proximity is indicated by the broad line shape features and the overall breadth of the spectra that exceed 100 gauss for both derivatives. As outlined under “Experimental Procedures,” the effect of line broadening because of dipolar spin-spin interaction can conveniently be obtained by comparing EPR spectra from fully R1-labeled protein with protein labeled with a mixture of R1 and an excess of the non-paramagnetic reagent R1′. As shown in Fig. 4, the EPR spectra of the R1/R1′ mixture (red traces) are strikingly different from those of the fully R1-labeled form. Most notable is the strongly increased signal intensity of the R1/R1′-labeled proteins, a feature that is the direct consequence of reduced line broadening in these cases (compare red and black traces in Fig. 4, A and G). The strong spin-spin interaction is in agreement with the proximity of the respective sites in the crystal structure (also see below). Interestingly, in the absence of membranes and with a change in pH from 7.4 to 4.0, this strong spin-spin interaction is still retained for 113R1/241R1 (compare Fig. 4, A and D) or 77R1/265R1 (compare Fig. 4, G and J) suggesting that the distance between the sites remains very similar. Thus, together with the CD data, the SDSL analysis demonstrates that, in solution, ANX12 does not undergo global unfolding or refolding at acidic pH (between pH 7.4 and 4.5). Next, we asked whether the presence of PS and PC containing vesicles could induce pronounced structural changes. As can be seen in Fig. 4, E and K, the interaction of ANX12 with PS and PC containing vesicles at pH 4 in the absence of Ca2+ resulted in completely different EPR spectra when compared with those of the protein in solution. One of the most noticeably different features is the complete loss of spin-spin interaction, as evidenced by the similarity of the EPR spectra from the fully R1-labeled (Fig. 4, E and K, black traces) and the mixed R1/R1′-labeled derivatives (Fig. 4, E and K, red traces). Thus, major conformational changes must occur that move the pairs of spin labels outside of the distance range detectable by conventional SDSL (i.e. 25 Å). The notion of a significant and global structural change is further supported by the strongly altered line shapes of the R1/R1′-labeled spectra of soluble and membrane-bound protein. To confirm that this change in the line shape is not because of simple local unfolding, but rather is a consequence of membrane-induced refolding, we recorded the spectrum of 113R1/241R1 in the presence of a high concentration of urea, thus giving an indication of the EPR line shape expected for a completely unfolded protein. In the presence of urea, 113R1/241R1 had a completely different line shape with very sharp (1.93 gauss centerline width) and narrowly spaced lines, as one would expect for an unfolded protein (data not shown). Thus, our combined CD and SDSL approach strongly argues that the binding of ANX12 to PS and PC containing vesicles results in global conformational changes that extend through all four repeats of ANX12. Interestingly, these conformational changes are not a consequence of simple unfolding; rather, the refolded, membrane-bound form has secondary structural content comparable with that of the soluble form. To contrast these conformational changes with possible changes occurring in response to Ca2+, we recorded the EPR spectra of ANX12 bound to PS-containing membranes at pH 7.4 (Fig. 4, B and H). As can be seen from the comparison of the R1-labeled and R1/R1′-labeled double mutants, strong spin-spin interactions were observed for this Ca2+-dependent membrane interaction. Thus, as in solution, the two pairs of sites are in close proximity. To obtain more detailed distance information, we quantified the effect of spin-spin interaction as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” According to these simulations, the 77R1/265R1 mutant exhibits a single population of distances around 9 to 10 Å in the soluble and Ca2+-dependent membrane-bound forms. This side chain distance (nitroxide to nitroxide) is in good agreement with the separation of the α-carbons (8.8 Å) in the crystal structure. Also, in the case of 113R1/241R1, we observed a major distance population around 9 to 10 Å. In addition, the simulations revealed a longer distance distribution (around 13 to 14 Å). This population appears to be slightly more populated in the soluble form. Although the two populations could arise from two states of the protein, it should be noted that it is not uncommon to observe multiple distance population as a result of different spin label conformations (12Hubbell W.L. Cafiso D.S. Altenbach C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 23Langen R. Oh K.J. Cascio D. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8396-8405Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Regardless of the precise details, the distance analyses for the soluble and Ca2+-dependent membrane-bound forms are very similar, suggesting little conformational changes in these regions.

https://openalex.org/W2019188602,"Genistein, a phytoestrogen found abundantly in soy products, is thought to be cardioprotective, partly through its ability to act as a natural Ca2+ channel antagonist. However, the precise nature and significance of such direct cardiac actions remain obscure. We investigated the hypothesis that genistein exerts important additional actions on cardiac excitation-contraction coupling (ECC). Genistein acutely increased cell shortening and the Ca2+ transient in field stimulated guinea-pig ventricular myocytes despite potently inhibiting the L-type Ca2+ current, I(Ca,L). The specific phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, bpV(phen), diminished the stimulatory effects of genistein on myocyte contractility, suggesting that the mechanism partly involved tyrosine kinase inhibition. Genistein increased sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ load as measured with a caffeine pulse in Na+-free/ Ca2+-free solution. Furthermore, in the continued presence of caffeine, genistein increased the time constant of decline of the caffeine-induced Ca2+ transient, implying impaired sarcolemmal Na+/Ca2+ exchanger function. Tetanization studies in intact myocytes revealed that 43% of cells exhibited increased myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity in the presence of genistein. These findings demonstrate novel cardiac actions of genistein on the SR Ca2+ load, Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, and myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity, which result in an overall increase in myocyte contractility and consequently the gain of ECC."

Promoter studies in receptive human cell lines demonstrated that NO• down-regulated endothelial NO• synthase (eNOS) but up-regulated TNFα. Like TNFα, Sp1 binding to the eNOS promoter was decreased by NO• and a PKA inhibitor, H89, and increased by a PKA activator, dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP). For either promoter, mutation of Sp sites abolished NO• responses. In contrast, mutation of an upstream AP1 site in the TNFα promoter (not present in eNOS) maintained NO• responsiveness, but reversed the direction of NO• and cAMP effects. Using artificial constructs, NO• increased transcription when Sp and AP1 sites were both present (TNFα-like response), but decreased it when the adjacent AP1 site was disrupted (eNOS-like response). NO•, H89, and Bt2cAMP were found to produce reciprocal protein binding changes at contiguous AP1 and Sp sites (p < 0.0001 for an interaction). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that Sp1 and to a lesser extent Sp3 bound to the GC box regions of eNOS and TNFα in intact cells. Thus, this NO•- and cAMP-responsive regulatory module has a Sp site sensor variably coupled to an adjacent element that determines response polarity.

PKA modulates gene transcription by phosphorylating nuclear proteins such as cAMP-response element (CRE) binding protein or Sp1 (21Rohlff C. Ahmad S. Borellini F. Lei J. Glazer R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21137-21141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The TNFα promoter has corresponding binding sites for both of these transcription factors (22Rhoades K.L. Golub S.H. Economou J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22102-22107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in reporter gene experiments, NO• and cAMP responses were lost only when the Sp site (proximal GC box) was either deleted or mutated (18Wang S. Wang W. Wesley R.A. Danner R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33190-33193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). NO• and H89 were found to decrease, whereas Bt2cAMP increased Sp1 binding to the TNFα GC box (18Wang S. Wang W. Wesley R.A. Danner R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33190-33193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus Sp1 and its proximal GC box-binding site functioned as a genomic NO• sensor and repressed TNFα transcription. Proximal Sp factor binding sites are found in numerous genes that, unlike TNFα, lack TATA and CCAAT transcriptional start sites. In TATA- and CCAAT-less promoters, proximal Sp factor binding sites are necessary elements in the recruitment, positioning, and stabilization of the transcriptional complex (23Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1187-1197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, 24DiMario J.X. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 10: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For these genes, in contrast to TNFα, Sp factors often act as transactivators and NO•-induced reductions in binding would be expected to turn-off rather than turn-on transcription. The current investigation sought to generalize the NO• responsive, GC box paradigm to other types of human promoters and to characterize how these NO• sensors might function differentially in the context of larger composite regulatory elements. We tested whether NO•-Sp factor-GC box signaling and promoter regulation might also apply to a Sp factor-dependent gene that lacks TATA and CCAAT motifs. Furthermore, we investigated the mechanisms by which NO•-induced decreases in Sp factor binding might lead to either gene activation or repression. For the first question, NO• regulation of endothelial NO• synthase (eNOS) was studied in a human-hybrid endothelial cell line. The eNOS promoter lacks a TATA box, but has two overlapping Sp factor binding sites that are important for basal transcriptional activity (25Cieslik K. Zembowicz A. Tang J.L. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14885-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 26Karantzoulis-Fegaras F. Antoniou H. Lai S.L. Kulkarni G. D'Abreo C. Wong G.K. Miller T.L. Chan Y.

Unlike TNFα, the proximal GC box of eNOS is not flanked by sequences that bind strong transactivating factors (26Karantzoulis-Fegaras F. Antoniou H. Lai S.L. Kulkarni G. D'Abreo C. Wong G.K. Miller T.L. Chan Y. Atkins J. Wang Y. Marsden P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3076-3093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). For the second question, elements flanking the Sp binding site of TNFα, AP1, and AP2, were evaluated for their role in determining the directionality of NO•-induced promoter responses. Reagents—Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), Bt2cAMP, and H89 were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). N-Acetylpenicillamine (NAP) was obtained from Sigma. The enhanced chemiluminescence immunoblot detection system was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, 4–20% Tris glycine gels, and 6% DNA retardation gels were purchased from Novex (San Diego, CA). Polyclonal anti-Sp1, anti-Sp3, anti-c-Jun/AP1, and anti-AP2 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) or Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Monoclonal anti-eNOS and polyclonal anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were purchased from BD Biosciences. Western Blotting—EA•hy 926 cells, a human-hybrid endothelial line generously contributed by Dr. John B. Graham, North Carolina University (27Edgell C.J. McDonald C.C. Graham J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3734-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar), were lysed after incubation for 24 h with one of the following reagents or combinations: NAP (control, 500 μm), SNAP (500 μm), Bt2cAMP (100 μm), and H89 (15 μm). Western blotting for eNOS was performed as described previously (19Yan L. Wang S. Rafferty S.P. Wesley R.A. Danner R.L. Blood. 1997; 90: 1160-1167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Wang W. Wang S.

Briefly, soluble proteins (20 μg) from these different conditions were separated on 4–20% Tris glycine SDS gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After overnight blocking with 5% nonfat dry milk containing 0.05% Tween 20 at 4 °C, membranes were treated with anti-eNOS 1:1,000 and developed with anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Plasmid Construction—The two-plasmid reporter gene system used in this investigation has been described previously (18Wang S. Wang W. Wesley R.A. Danner R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33190-33193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 29Ollivier V. Parry G.C. Cobb R.R. de Prost D. Mackman N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20828-20835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). This reporter gene system is free of cryptic cAMP response elements and amplifies signals from low activity mutant promoters (29Ollivier V. Parry G.C. Cobb R.R. de Prost D. Mackman N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20828-20835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Briefly, promoters of interest were inserted into the first plasmid, promoterless ptTA, to induce production of a transactivator (tTA) containing a tetracycline response element binding domain. This fusion protein binds to the second plasmid, pUHG10.3CAT (kindly provided by Dr. Rob Hooft van Huijsduijnen, Glaxo Institute for Molecular Biology, Geneva, Switzerland), thereby transactivating expression of a reporter gene, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). The following promoter constructs were studied: human eNOS using wild type peNOS (from –1322 to +22 of the eNOS gene) and a Sp mutant peNOS(mSp), both graciously provided by Dr. Kenneth Wu, University of Texas, Houston Medical School (25Cieslik K.

Wang W. Wesley R.A. Danner R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33190-33193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) using wild type p(AP1)/(Sp)3, an AP1 mutant p(mAP1)/(Sp)3, and a Sp triple mutant p(AP1)/(mSp)3; and two short artificial promoters spanning the AP1/Sp consensus sequence of the TNFα promoter (–71 to –45) in both the forward and reverse orientation, p(AP1)/(Sp) and p(Sp)/(AP1). Mutants of pTNF were generated using site-directed mutagenesis kits (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The wild type artificial promoter and its mutants were created by inserting synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides, containing the corresponding sequences, into plasmid ptTA. The structures and site mutations for these promoters are outlined in Fig. 1. Mutated sequences were searched against the TRANSFAC™ data base and did not match known binding sites for human transcription factors (30Wingender E. Chen X. Fricke E. Geffers R. Hehl R. Liebich I.

Cell Transfection and CAT Assay—Wild type and mutant constructs of the human eNOS promoter were transfected into the human-hybrid endothelial cell line EA•hy 926 (27Edgell C.J. McDonald C.C. Graham J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3734-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar) using DOTAP transfection kits (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Wild type and mutant TNFα and artificial promoter constructs were transfected into the human monoblastoid U937 cell line using previously described methods (18Wang S. Wang W. Wesley R.A. Danner R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33190-33193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). After transfection, U937 cells were incubated for 16 h with PMA (100 nm) to differentiate them into a TNFα-producing phenotype. CAT activity for all reporter gene experiments was measured after incubation for 24 h in the presence of various reagents by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Diagnostics). In all transfections, β-galactosidase expressed by a cotransfected internal pSVβ-Gal control (Promega, Madison, WI) was used to normalize CAT. Promoter activity was calculated for each promoter construct as fold induction of CAT expression compared with the CAT expression obtained using the promoterless ptTA plasmid. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—U937 cells were incubated with PMA (100 nm) for 16 h. Differentiated U937 or EA•hy 926 cells were cultured for 24 h with one of the following reagents or combinations: NAP (control; 500 μm), SNAP (500 μm), Bt2cAMP (100 μm), and H89 (15 μm). EMSA were performed with 15 μg of nuclear extract and double-stranded DNA probes were labeled with 32P using previously described methods (31Zhang J. Ding X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23454-23462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The probes used included: Sp probe representing –108 to –83 section of the eNOS promoter (5′-GGGATAGGGGCGGGGCGAGGGCCAGC-3′); AP1-Sp probe representing the –71 to –44 section of the TNFα promoter (5′-GCTGGTTGAATGATTCTTTCCCCGCCCT-3′); and the Sp-AP2 probe representing the –52 to –25 section of the TNFα promoter (5′-CCCCGCCCTCCTCTCGCCCCAGGGACAT-3′). For supershift assays, 2 μg of the corresponding antibody was added to the binding reaction mixture and incubated for 20 min on ice prior to addition of the labeled probe. For competition assays, 100-fold molar excess of cold probe was added 10 min prior to the corresponding hot probe. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—U937 cells were incubated with PMA (100 nm) for 16 h. Differentiated U937 or EA•hy 926 cells were cultured for 24 h with one of the following reagents: NAP (control; 500 μm), SNAP (500 μm), or Bt2cAMP (100 μm). The ChIP assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, Charlottesville, VA). Briefly, cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Glycine was added to a final concentration of 0.125 m to stop cross-linking. After washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed for 10 min (1 × 106 cells/200 μl of SDS lysis buffer). The chromatin was sheared by sonication 4 times for 40 s at one-third of the maximum power with 1 min cooling on ice between each pulse. Cross-link released total chromatin was quantitated to determine the starting amount of DNA present in different samples (input chromatin). The remaining chromatin fractions were pre-cleared with salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose for 1 h followed by immunoprecipitation with either anti-Sp1 or anti-Sp3 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected with salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose for 1 h, washed 5 times, and finally eluted in 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3. Sp1- or Sp3-DNA cross-linking was reversed at 65 °C overnight and digested with 100 μg of proteinase K at 45 °C for 1 h. DNA was then recovered in diethylpyrocarbonate-H2O for PCR using phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. PCRs were performed using the following promoter-specific primers: TNF-α (–127 to +29), 5′-CCACTACCGCTTCCTCCAGAT-3′ and 5′-CTGTCCTTGCTGAGGGAGCGT-3′; eNOS (–170 to –7), 5′-CGGGCGTGGAGCTGAGGCTT-3′ and 5′-CCAGCAGAGCCCTGGCCTT-3′. The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels, stained with SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes), and quantified with Kodak Image Station 440 (Eastman Kodak Co.). Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. All p values are two-sided unless noted otherwise, and considered significant if less than 0.05. Densitometry results from eNOS Western blots were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Dunnett's post-hoc test to find which conditions significantly differed from the common control. Reporter gene experiments within each promoter were analyzed using two-way ANOVA (the two factors being group and experiment). If the overall ANOVA was significant, Fisher's least significant difference method was used to determine which groups differed. Stringently accounting for multiple comparisons was not considered critical because it was expected a priori (18Wang S. Wang W. Wesley R.A. Danner R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33190-33193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) that the SNAP, H89, and SNAP/H89-treated groups would behave similarly as would the control, Bt2cAMP, and SNAP/Bt2cAMP-treated groups. Comparisons of control promoter activity across multiple wild type and mutant constructs were performed using two-way ANOVA, followed by the stringent post-hoc method of Games-Howell. ChIP assay results were analyzed using two-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni-adjusted pairwise comparisons. For pattern-response comparisons performed on the reporter gene element order and ChIP experiments, data was first rescaled to a common mean and then subjected to a 3-way ANOVA, computing the interaction term. To evaluate reciprocal binding effects at adjacent AP1 and Sp or Sp and AP2 binding sites, Bonferroni-adjusted p values were computed for each condition separately by testing whether the change from control for Sp was in the opposite direction to the change from control for AP1 (or AP2). Evidence for a reciprocal effect was then examined over all conditions by summing these 5 p values and comparing this result to that expected under the null hypothesis of no reciprocal effect. Effect of NO • on eNOS Protein Expression in EA • hy 926 cells—We have previously shown that NO• up-regulates TNFα in human phagocytic cells (6Van Dervort A.L. Yan L. Madara P.J. Cobb J.P.

Blood. 1997; 90: 1160-1167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by decreasing intracellular cAMP levels and thereby decreasing Sp1 binding to a repressive GC box element in the TNFα proximal promoter (18Wang S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5959-5965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, other genes that have transactivating Sp sites would likely be down-rather than up-regulated by NO-induced decreases in Sp1 binding. To test this possibility, we examined eNOS, a TATA-less gene whose transcription is highly dependent on a proximal Sp transactivating element (25Cieslik K. Zembowicz A. Tang J.L. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14885-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 26Karantzoulis-Fegaras F. Antoniou H. Lai S.L. Kulkarni G. D'Abreo C. Wong G.K. Miller T.L. Chan Y.

First, we assessed the effects of SNAP, a NO• donor, H89, a PKA inhibitor, and Bt2cAMP, a PKA activator, on eNOS protein expression in EA•hy 926 cells, a human-hybrid endothelial line, using Western blotting. Compared with control, eNOS protein expression was decreased by incubation with SNAP, H89, or SNAP plus H89 (Fig. 2; p < 0.01). In contrast, incubation with Bt2cAMP or SNAP plus Bt2cAMP compared with control nonsignificantly increased eNOS expression (p = 0.11 and 0.12, respectively). NO • Responsiveness of the Human eNOS Promoter; Dependence on the Proximal GC Box—Next we used a reporter gene system to determine whether NO• and H89 decrease eNOS expression by suppressing transcription and, if so, whether these effects are transmitted through the proximal GC box element. To this end, we investigated the responses of both wild type and mutant constructs (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 3, SNAP, H89, or both decreased, whereas Bt2cAMP increased eNOS promoter activity (p < 0.0002 for all pairwise comparisons to control). Furthermore, Bt2cAMP blocked the down-regulatory effect of NO• (p = 0.3 compared with Bt2cAMP alone). Mutation of the GC box, previously shown to bind Sp1 (25Cieslik K. Zembowicz A. Tang J.L. Wu K.K.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33190-33193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), significantly reduced its ability to respond to either NO• or cAMP pathway signals (p = 0.0012 compared with wild type promoter). These observations further confirm that the proximal GC box is an important transactivator of the human eNOS promoter. In addition, the results demonstrate that NO• can negatively regulate eNOS transcription through this pivotal element. Effect of NO • on Sp Proteins; Binding to the Proximal GC Box of the eNOS Promoter—Our previous studies demonstrated that NO• decreased intracellular cAMP levels leading to reduced Sp1 binding to the human TNFα promoter (18Wang S.

We find that, unlike other Ras family GTPases, most SRβ purifies bound to GTP, and SRβ-bound GTP is not easily exchanged with solution GTP. SRβ possesses no detectable GTPase activity. Although a stable interaction between SRβ and ribosomes is observed, SRβ is not stimulated to hydrolyze GTP when incubated with ribosomes or ribosome-nascent chains.

Nascent polypeptide chains being synthesized in the cytosol are sampled by the signal recognition particle (SRP) as they emerge from the ribosome (1Ogg S.C. Walter P. Cell. 1995; 81: 1075-1084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The GTPase in SRP, SRP54, binds to signal sequences in nascent polypeptides as they emerge from the ribosome, forming ribosome-nascent chain-SRP ternary complexes (2Krieg U.C. Walter P. Johnson A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8604-8608Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 3Kurzchalia T.V. Wiedmann M. Girshovich A.S. Bochkareva E.S. Bielka H. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 1986; 320: 634-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The ternary complexes are directed to the ER because of the affinity of SRP for its cognate receptor (SRP receptor; SR) on the surface of the ER membrane. Through a series of GTPase-controlled steps the ribosome-nascent chain is transferred to the protein-conducting channel, or translocon, which facilitates translation of the nascent chain across, or integration into, the ER membrane (reviewed in Ref. 4Legate K.R. Andrews D.W. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 593-601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The concerted action of GTPases ensures that the targeting step and nascent chain transfer step are unidirectional processes (5Millman J.S. Andrews D.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 673-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). SRP54 and one of the subunits of the SRP receptor, SRα, bind GTP in a cooperative manner (6Rapiejko P.J. Gilmore R. Cell. 1997; 89: 703-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Binding of GTP by SRP54 and SRα increases the affinity of these proteins for one another, thereby maintaining a direct physical link between the ribosome-nascent chain and the ER membrane (7Connolly T. Rapiejko P.J. Gilmore R. Science. 1991; 252: 1171-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 8Bacher G. Lutcke H. Jungnickel B. Rapoport T.A. Dobberstein B. Nature. 1996; 381: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons revealed that the SRα and SRP54 GTPases define a specific subfamily of GTPases conserved in prokaryotes, yeast, and mammals that is now referred to as the SRP family of GTPases (9Bernstein H.D. Poritz M.A. Strub K. Hoben P.J. Brenner S. Walter P. Nature. 1989; 340: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 10Romisch K. Webb J. Herz J. Prehn S. Frank R. Vingron M. Dobberstein B. Nature. 1989; 340: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The third GTPase that appears to be involved in regulating translocation is SRβ. It has been proposed that release of SRP from the nascent chain, and subsequent transfer of the nascent chain to the translocon, is controlled by SRβ (11Fulga T.A. Sinning I. Dobberstein B. Pool M.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2338-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Unlike SRP54 and SRα, SRβ shares significant homology within the GTP binding consensus sequences, or G boxes, of Ras-type GTPases (12Miller J.D. Tajima S. Lauffer L. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Structural analysis indicates that SRβ also bears significant structural homology to Ras-type GTPases (13Schwartz T. Blobel G. Cell. 2003; 112: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, it differs from other Ras-type GTPases in two respects. First, although other Ras-type GTPases require prenylation at the carboxyl terminus to enable a reversible interaction with membranes (14Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar), SRβ is permanently integrated into the ER membrane by an amino-terminal transmembrane domain. Second, SRβ contains a cysteine within the G1 GTPase consensus sequence where most Ras-type GTPases contain a glycine. The other exception is members of the Arf family of GTPases that all contain an aspartic acid at this position. The identity of this amino acid appears to be crucial to the activity of Arf and Ras GTPases (15Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3781) Google Scholar, 16Trahey M. McCormick F. Science. 1987; 238: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 17Kahn R.A. Clark J. Rulka C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 143-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), which raises the possibility that SRβ differs functionally from both Arf-like and other Ras-type GTPases. The search for protein factors that influence the activity of SRβ has led to the observation that a factor associated with ribosomes possesses measurable GAP activity and may also function as a guanine nucleotide dissociation factor for SRβ. Incubation of ribosome-nascent chain complexes with either the SRα/SRβ dimer or a proteolysis product of the dimer lacking the SRα GTPase (SRΔα) both increases the GTPase activity of SRβ and decreases the affinity of SRβ for nucleotides (18Bacher G. Pool M. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The influence of the ribosome on SRβ suggests a direct physical contact between the two. Supporting this prediction, cross-linking experiments have revealed an interaction between SRβ and a protein component of the ribosomal 60 S subunit (11Fulga T.A. Sinning I. Dobberstein B. Pool M.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2338-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Whether this ribosomal protein is responsible for the observed GAP/guanine nucleotide dissociation factor activity is still unresolved. In addition to proposed roles in nascent chain transfer and SRP release, SRβ also anchors SRα to the ER membrane via a tight physical interaction between the SRβ GTPase domain and an amino-terminal domain of SRα (19Tajima S. Lauffer L. Rath V.L. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1167-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 20Young J.C. Ursini J. Legate K.R. Miller J.D. Walter P. Andrews D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15650-15657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This interaction is influenced by the nucleotide-bound status of SRβ. Generation of empty SRβ by gel filtration of an XTP binding mutant of SRβ, which has a decreased affinity for GTP, abolishes the SRα/SRβ interaction. Replenishing the reaction mixture with xanthosine 5′-diphosphate or XTP restores dimer formation, with XTP having a greater effect. Deletion of any part of the SRβ core GTPase also abolishes the interaction with SRα (21Legate K.R. Falcone D. Andrews D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27439-27446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All data gathered to date on the function of SRβ have been obtained in the context of a heterodimer. Attempts to isolate the SRβ GTPase for study have involved proteolytic treatment of SR with trypsin or elastase to specifically digest SRα. This method releases the GTP binding domain of SRα from SRβ but leaves an amino-terminal domain of SRα bound to SRβ (10Romisch K. Webb J. Herz J. Prehn S. Frank R. Vingron M. Dobberstein B. Nature. 1989; 340: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 22Lauffer L. Garcia P.D. Harkins R.N. Coussens L. Ullrich A. Walter P. Nature. 1985; 318: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, there are no data on the properties of SRβ as an isolated GTPase. To address this issue directly we have expressed and purified from Escherichia coli a soluble version of SRβ, termed SRβΔTM. Isolated SRβΔTM has no detectable GTPase activity, and most does not exchange GTP in vitro. The small fraction (3–6%) of SRβΔTM that does bind exogenous GTP undergoes a conformational change that can be detected by fluorescence spectroscopy. A direct interaction between SRβΔTM and the ribosome is confirmed, and the influence of the ribosome on the SRβ GTPase is examined. Our results suggest that SRβ GTPase function is unlike other Ras-type GTPases. Plasmids—Construction of plasmids, sequencing, and site-directed mutagenesis were performed using standard techniques. All encoded products are under the control of a T7 promoter. The plasmids pMAC191 (containing a modified full-length cDNA sequence of canine SRα), pMAC455 (encoding SRβmd), pMAC1083 (encoding hemagglutinin-SRβXTPΔTM), and pMAC853 (encoding SRβΔTM, a fusion of the carboxyl-terminal 206 amino acids of canine SRβ with an amino-terminal hemagglutinin epitope tag) were reported previously (20Young J.C. Ursini J. Legate K.R. Miller J.D. Walter P. Andrews D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15650-15657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 21Legate K.R. Falcone D. Andrews D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27439-27446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pMAC1277 encodes SRβΔTM fused to an amino-terminal His tag and enterokinase (EK) cleavage site. This plasmid was assembled in two steps. First pMAC701, encoding SRβmd fused to an aminoterminal His tag and EK cleavage site, was generated by removing the SRβ coding sequence from pMAC455 by digestion with BglII and KpnI and inserting it into pRSETB (Invitrogen) digested with the same enzymes. The sequence encoding SRβΔTM was then excised from pMAC853 using NcoI and EcoRI and inserted into pMAC701 digested with NcoI and EcoRI, thereby replacing the coding region for SRβmd with that for SRβΔTM. Plasmid pMAC1623 encoding SRβC71GΔTM fused to an amino-terminal His tag and EK cleavage site was generated from pMAC1277 by the method described in Ref. 23Hughes M.J. Andrews D.W. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 192-196Google Scholar. Briefly, the entire plasmid was amplified by PCR using oligo958 (ATGGGCCCCTCGGCAACTCTGGGAAAAC; desired mutation in bold) and oligo959 (ATGGGCCCCAACAAGAACAGCTCT). The product was then digested with ApaI, and the 3′ over-hanging ends were blunted by incubation with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase, and the linear DNA was circularized by ligation with T4 DNA ligase. Plasmid pMAC1624 encodes SRβC71DΔTM fused to an amino-terminal His tag and EK cleavage site, under the control of a T7 promoter. To generate this plasmid pMAC1277 was amplified by PCR using oligo960 (ATGGGCCCCTCGACAACTCTGGGAAAA; desired mutation in bold) and oligo959. The PCR product was digested with ApaI and end-repaired and ligated as above. Plasmid pMAC1278 encodes SRβXTPΔTM fused to an amino-terminal His tag and EK cleavage site. SRβXTPΔTM was excised from pMAC1083 with NcoI and EcoRI and inserted into pMAC701 digested with NcoI and EcoRI, replacing SRβmd with SRβXTPΔTM. Plasmid pMAC1637 encodes SRβC71DΔTM fused to a carboxyl-terminal His tag. SRβC71DΔTM was amplified from pMAC1624 using oligo-203 (CATGCCATGGCTAAGTTCATCCGGAGCAGA) and oligo976 (AGAATTCAATGATGATGATGATGATGGGCGATTTTAGCCAGCCAC) and digested with NcoI and EcoRI. The digested fragment was inserted into pET16b (Novagen) digested with NcoI and EcoRI. Protein Purification—Plasmids encoding either His-SRβΔTM or His-SRβC71DΔTM were expressed in the salt-inducible BL21SI strain by addition of NaCl to 300 mm final concentration for 2 h. All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. Cell pellets were washed once in 50 mm Na2HPO4, pH 8.0, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Na2HPO4, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgOAc2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol (v/v)). Cells were lysed in a pressure cell, DNA was precipitated with 0.15% polyethylenamine, and lysate was centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 20 min in a Beckman JA-20 rotor. The lysate was further clarified by centrifuging at 110,000 × g for 1 h in a Beckman Ti50.2 rotor prior to loading on Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) equilibrated in 50 mm Na2HPO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgOAc2, 10% glycerol. The column was washed in 10 volumes of equilibration buffer, and His-SRβ was eluted with equilibration buffer + 50 mm imidazole. Protein containing fractions were detected by BCA assay (Pierce), pooled, and dialyzed overnight in 40 mm Tris-OAc, pH 7.8, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgOAc2, 1 mm DTT, 25% glycerol. Dialysate was diluted with 6 volumes of 40 mm Tris-OAc, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgOAc2, 1 mm DTT, 25% glycerol to reduce the NaCl concentration and loaded immediately onto CM-Sepharose equilibrated in 40 mm Tris-OAc, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgOAc2, 1 mm DTT, 25% glycerol. The column was washed with 10 volumes of equilibration buffer, and His-SRβ was eluted in a single step in SRβ elution buffer (equilibration buffer + 100 mm NaCl). Protein containing fractions were detected by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) and pooled. Protein concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm as described (24Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Protein was frozen in small aliquots at –80 °C; material used for functional studies was thawed once and discarded. Immunoprecipitation—Proteins were synthesized in vitro, quantified, and immunoprecipitated as described previously (21Legate K.R. Falcone D. Andrews D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27439-27446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HPLC Analysis of Bound Nucleotide—10 nmols of SRβ were diluted to 250 μl in SRβ elution buffer. An equal volume of 8 m urea, 20 mm Tris-OAc, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl was added, and the sample was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The sample was centrifuged through a 5-kDa cutoff filter (Millipore), and the filtrate was added to a Bakerbond QUAT 5-μm HPLC column (J. T. Baker Inc.) in 25 mm triethylamine bicarbonate, pH 7.2. Nucleotide was eluted from the column with a 5–100% gradient of triethylamine bicarbonate. Samples were analyzed with 32Karat, version 3.0 software (Beckman), and nucleotide was quantified by calculating the area under the curve and comparing to a standard curve of GTP or GDP. The recovery of nucleotides in these experiments (90%) was determined by adding a known amount of GMP as an internal control. Fluorescence Experiments—300 nm SRβ was incubated with 500 nm 2′ (or 3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)GTP (mant-GTP) in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgOAc2, 2 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol in a 1-cm path length quartz cuvette. All measurements were taken with a fluorometer equipped with an 815 photomultiplier detection system (PTI, London, Ontario, Canada) with a 2-nm excitation slit width and a 2-nm emission slit width and compiled with Felix, version 1.4 software (PTI). Samples were excited at 280 or 295 nm, and emission spectra were obtained by scanning from 300 to 500 nm in 2-nm increments with an integration time of 0.2 s per data point. Emission spectra were corrected by subtracting a buffer blank, and peak values were manually selected for further calculation. All calculations and data plots were performed within MS Excel 2002. Filter Binding—100 pmols of SRβ (1 μm) were incubated at the specified temperatures with 10 μm GTP including 25% [3H]GTP (specific activity 31 Ci/mmol) in 50 mm Tris-OAc, pH 7.8, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 2 mm DTT. At the appropriate time points samples were withdrawn and diluted to 2 ml in ice-cold filter binding buffer (20 mm Tris-OAc, pH 7.8, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NH4Cl). Samples were applied to prewashed nitrocellulose discs (What-man), and the discs were washed with 3 × 3-ml filter binding buffer in a Millipore 1225 filtration sampling manifold (Millipore). Discs were dried, and bound nucleotide was quantified in a scintillation counter. Nucleotide Exchange—Nucleotide exchange reactions were performed as described previously (25Koyama S. Kikuchi A. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 332: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 26Wang Y. Colicelli J. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 332: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, SRβΔTM (1 μm) was incubated with 20 μm GTP including 0.2 μm [γ-32P]GTP for 10 min at 30 °C in final buffer conditions containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 6 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol. After 10 min MgCl2 was added to a concentration of 20 mm. The extent of nucleotide exchange was quantified by filter binding. To prepare SRβΔTM for GTPase assays, free nucleotide was separated from bound nucleotide by repurifying SRβΔTM on CM-Sepharose. UV Cross-linking—5 μm SRβ was incubated with 0.5 μm [α-32P]GTP and the indicated concentration of unlabeled GTP in cross-linking buffer (50 mm Tris-OAc, pH 7.8, 150 mm KOAc, 5 mm MgOAc2, 2 mm DTT) for 20 min on ice, followed by 5 min at 24 °C. Reactions were placed into a plastic weight boat on a chilled metal block and irradiated with UV light at 5000 microwatts/cm2 for 5 min. Samples were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and washed in ethanol:ether (1:1) to remove free nucleotide, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed using a PhosphorImager. GTPase Assay—40 nm nucleotide-bound SRβ or 5.0 A 260 units/ml ribosomes was incubated with 83.5 nm [γ-32P]GTP in GTPase buffer (50 mm Tris-OAc, pH 7.8, 150 mm KOAc, 5 mm MgOAc2, 2 mm DTT) at 24 °C. At the indicated time points samples were removed and quenched by adjusting the EDTA concentration to 50 mm on ice. Samples were spotted onto polyethylenamine cellulose TLC plates and resolved in 0.375 m KH2PO4, pH 3.5, for 1 h. Plates were dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen for quantitative analysis. To generate the Lineweaver-Burke plot reactions were supplemented with cold GTP to concentrations up to 5 μm, and the reaction was monitored using hydrolysis of [γ-32P]GTP to estimate hydrolysis of all GTP. To assess the effect of ribosomes on the SRβ GTPase, 10 nm [γ-32P]GTP-loaded SRβΔTM and 20 nm 80 S ribosomes were incubated at 24 °C in GTPase buffer. Samples were removed at the indicated time points and quenched with 50 mm EDTA, and [γ-32P]GTP was resolved from 32Pi by TLC. Ribosome Binding Experiments—Canine pancreatic ribosomes and wheat germ RNCs were prepared as described elsewhere (11Fulga T.A. Sinning I. Dobberstein B. Pool M.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2338-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 18Bacher G. Pool M. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and stored at a concentration of 100 A 260 units/ml in 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgOAc2, 150 mm KOAc, 1 mm DTT (+1mm cycloheximide for RNCs). 5 μm SRβ was incubated with 20 A 260 units/ml ribosomes or RNCs for 1 h at 24 °C in the above buffer and then added to the top of 30 ml of linear 0.3–1.2 m sucrose gradients. The gradients were centrifuged in a SW28 rotor for 16 h at 48,000 × g. 1-ml fractions were collected by bottom puncture and protein precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting using an antibody directed against SRβ. Data Analysis—All data analysis was performed using Sigmaplot 8.02. Although sequence comparisons clearly indicate that SRβ belongs to the Ras superfamily of small molecular weight GTPases it defines its own subfamily. One method of sorting GTPase family members is to define regions of homology within the residues lining the GTP binding pocket. Ras-type GTPases contain sequences of conserved residues called G boxes that are arranged at discrete intervals throughout the primary sequence (27Dever T.E. Glynias M.J. Merrick W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1814-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Arf family GTPases are distinguished from other Ras-type GTPases by the presence of an aspartic acid instead of a glycine residue in the G1 box (Table I). The identity of this residue within SRβ is not strictly conserved among lower eukaryotes, but higher eukaryotes contain a cysteine in this position (Table II). The G1 box of canine SRβ differs from Arf GTPases in only one other position in which an Ala not conserved in other Ras GTPases is replaced by a Ser.Table IAlignment of G1 box sequences of Ras superfamily members SC, Saccharomyces cerevisiae; RR, Rattus rattus; HS, Homo sapiens; MM, Mus musculus.ProteinspeciesG1 GTPase box sequenceRaslpSCGGGGVGKSRasRRGAGGVGKSRanHSGDGGTGKTRac1HSGDGAVGKTRhoAHSGDGACGKTARF-1HSGLDAAGKTARF-2MMGLDAAGKTSarlpSCGLDNAGKTSarlMMGLDNAGKTSarlaHSGLDNAGKTARL1HSGLDGAGKT Open table in a new tab Table IIAlignment of G1 box sequences of SRβ homologuesOrganismGene/ORF nameG1 GTPase box sequenceSaccharomyces cerevisiaeSrp102pGPONSGKTSchizosaccharomyces pombe (putative)O13950GPSDSGKTArabidopsis (putative)AAD08946GLSDSGKTCaenorhabditis elegans (putative)NP_506245GLMDCGKTMus musculusSRβGLCDSGKTCanis familiarisSRβGLCNSGKTHomo sapiensSRβGLCDSGKT Open table in a new tab In an attempt to identify the importance of the cysteine in the function of SRβ two point mutants at this site were generated. The first, SRβC71DΔTM, converts the cysteine to an aspartic acid, converting SRβ into an Arf family GTPase. The second, SRβC71GΔTM, converts the cysteine to a glycine to resemble other Ras-type GTPases. Binding of SRβ and SRβ mutants to SRα was assayed by coprecipitation. SRα, wild-type SRβ, both cysteine point mutants, and another GTPase point mutant, SRβXTPΔTM, shown previously to switch the nucleotide binding preference from GTP to XTP (11Fulga T.A. Sinning I. Dobberstein B. Pool M.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2338-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 21Legate K.R. Falcone D. Andrews D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27439-27446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were synthesized in vitro in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. Nucleotides were removed from some samples by gel filtration (–GTP) and separate reactions containing equimolar amounts of SRα and each of the SRβ variants were incubated together to allow complex formation. Complexes were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against SRα (Fig. 1). All of the SRβ molecules bound SRα in the presence of nucleotides contributed by the translation mix. As reported previously (21Legate K.R. Falcone D. Andrews D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27439-27446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), binding of SRα to the XTP-preferring version of SRβ was greatly reduced in the absence of nucleotide, because the reduced affinity of SRβXTPΔTM for GTP allows this SRβ variant to be emptied by gel filtration. Binding of either cysteine point mutant to SRα was unaffected by nucleotide depletion demonstrating that, despite the mutation in the G1 box, these mutants retain SRα binding activity under conditions that serve to empty SRβXTPΔTM. To examine the isolated SRβ GTPase in greater detail, a recombinant protein consisting of the cytoplasmic portion of SRβ fused to an amino-terminal hexahistidine tag (His6) was expressed in E. coli. The protein (SRβΔTM) was purified to apparent homogeneity in two steps involving Ni-NTA-agarose and CM-Sepharose (Fig. 2a). Gel filtration analysis of the purified product confirmed that SRβΔTM is a monomer in solution (data not shown). One of the cysteine point mutants, SRβC71DΔTM, was expressed with a carboxyl-terminal His6 tag and purified using conditions identical to those used to purify SRβΔTM (Fig. 2b). GTPases are generally purified in the GDP-bound form. This holds true for both tissue-derived proteins and recombinant proteins that lack GAP homologues in E. coli (28Poe M. Scolnick E.M. Stein R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3906-3909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Weiss O. Holden J. Rulka C. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21066-21072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Barlowe C. d'Enfert C. Schekman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 873-879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we expected that SRβ purified from E. coli would be GDP-bound. To identify and quantify the nucleotide that copurified with SRβΔTM, 10 nmols of SRβΔTM or SRβC71DΔTM were denatured in 4 m urea to release the bound nucleotide into solution. The protein was removed by filtration, and the released nucleotide was analyzed by HPLC and compared with standards of GTP and GDP examined in parallel (Fig. 3). The retention times for GDP and GTP on the HPLC column were 7.9 and 9.6 min, respectively (Fig. 3a). Surprisingly, the supernatant from denatured SRβ contained a single major peak that eluted at 9.6 min, indicating the presence of GTP. A smaller peak was detected at 7.9 min, corresponding to a small amount of GDP (Fig. 3b). Calculating the area under the curves and comparing these values against values obtained from GTP and GDP standards and correcting for 10% loss (measured using GMP as an internal standard) revealed that 72% of SRβΔTM contains bound GTP whereas only 2.2% was bound to GDP. Similarly, 71% of purified SRβC71DΔTM contains GTP, and 2.8% was bound to GDP. Therefore both wild-type SRβ and the GTPase point mutant remain bound to GTP throughout purification. The remaining 26% is not bound to nucleotide. This population of SRβ did not bind to GTP in the timescale expected of an active empty GTPase (31Feuerstein J. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8455-8458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Shapiro A.D. Riederer M.A. Pfeffer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6925-6931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (see Figs. 4 and 5). Therefore we presume that this population consists of SRβ that has become structurally unstable in the absence of bound GTP, and the resulting loss of conformation prevented the uptake of exogenous GTP. A structurally unstable empty state is a common feature of Ras-type GTPases (31Feuerstein J. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8455-8458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33John J. Sohmen R. Feuerstein J. Linke R. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S.

Addition of 10 μm GTP to the buffers used during purification did not decrease the percentage of empty SRβ (data not shown), suggesting that this population does not arise from dissociation of nucleotide during purification.Fig. 4GTP binding kinetics of SRβ. a, fluorescence of 300 nmSRβΔTM incubated with 500 nm mant-GTP in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgOAc2, 2 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol in a 1-cm path length quartz cuvette at 24 °C.

In organ culture these hormones are incapable of reproducing the density and size of lobuloalveoli seen in mice, suggesting the existence of other undiscovered factors. We showed previously that galanin knockout mice fail to lactate sufficiently for pup survival following their first pregnancy. Here we demonstrate that prolactin treatment of galanin knockout mice allows pup survival but does not completely rescue lobuloalveolar development or reduced milk protein expression. When galanin was used in combination with prolactin in mammary organ culture, larger and more numerous lobules were produced than with prolactin alone. Galanin alone produced sustained activation of STAT5a and the induction of milk protein expression but did not induce lobulogenesis. Examination of the transcriptional interaction between galanin and prolactin using oligonucleotide microarrays demonstrated synergistic and antagonistic modes of interaction between these hormones.

Development of the mammary gland occurs predominantly after birth and is systemically controlled by the pituitary-ovarian axis.

Other factors may remain to be discovered, as models of mammary development in vitro do not reproduce the extent of mammary development seen in vivo. Galanin is a 29-amino acid peptide originally isolated from porcine intestine (6Tatemoto K. Rokaeus A. Jornvall H. McDonald T.J. Mutt V.

Galanin is also a mitogen for the prolactin-secreting pituitary lactotroph cells. Overexpression of galanin in the lactotroph induces hyperplasia and consequent hyperprolactinemia (16Cai A. Hayes J.D. Patel N. Hyde J.F. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4955-4964Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and galanin knockout (Gal–/–) mice display reduced prolactin levels during pregnancy associated with lactational failure (17Wynick D.

A. 1998; 95: 12671-12676Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Together these data demonstrate an essential role for galanin in the control of neuronal and neuroendocrine function. The galanin gene is located at chromosome 11q13, and like many genes in this region it is amplified in around 13% of breast cancers (18Ormandy C.J. Musgrove E.J. Hui R. Daly R.J. Sutherland R.J. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2003; 78: 323-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Galanin is expressed by a number of breast cancer cell lines, but expression does not correlate with amplification. In contrast, galanin expression correlates with estrogen and progesterone receptor expression and is regulated by estradiol and progesterone (19Ormandy C.J. Lee C.S. Ormandy H.F. Fantl V. Shine J. Peters G. Sutherland R.L. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1353-1357PubMed Google Scholar). In the rat, serum levels of galanin increase during pregnancy and peak at mid-pregnancy with levels 7-fold greater then those observed in nulliparous animals (20Vrontakis M.E. Schroedter I.C. Cosby H. Friesen H.G. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the role of galanin in mammary gland development may involve more than simple modulation of pituitary prolactin secretion. To further investigate this hypothesis we utilized galanin knockout mice, combined with mammary transplantation, whole organ culture, and transcript profiling, to examine the role of galanin in mammary development. Animals—Gal–/– mice (17Wynick D. Small C.J. Bacon A. Holmes F.E. Norman M. Ormandy C.J. Kilic E. Kerr N.C. Ghatei M. Talamantes F. Bloom S.R. Pachnis V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Tonegawa S. Papaioannou V.E. Cell. 1992; 68: 869-877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2320) Google Scholar) on the inbred C57BL/6J background were purchased from Animal Resource Centre, Perth, Australia. All animals were specific pathogen-free and housed with food and water ad libitum with a 12-h day/night cycle at 22 °C and 80% relative humidity. mRNA Isolation—The 4th inguinal mammary gland was frozen in liquid nitrogen before storage at –80 °C prior to use. Total RNA was extracted using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—First strand cDNA synthesis used avian myeloblastosis transcriptase (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR primers for galanin (accession number NM 010253), Galr1 (accession number NM 008082), Galr2 (accession number NM 010254), Galr3 (accession number NM 015738), and GAPDH (accession number M32599) were designed on the basis of mismatch to other genes. The following primers were used in this study: galanin, mGal-F1 5′-TGCAGTAAGCGACCATCCAG-3′ (forward) and mGal-R1 5′-AGCACAGGACACACGTGCAC-3′ (reverse); Galr1, mGalr1-F1 5′-CGCCTTCATCTGCAAGTTTA-3′ (forward) and mGalr1-R1 5′-CAGGACGGTCTGTGCAGT-3′ (reverse); Galr2, mGalr2-F1 5′-TGCCTTTCCAGGCCACCATC-3′ (forward) and mGalr2-R1 5′-GCGTAAGTGGCACGCGTGAG-3′ (reverse); Galr3, Galr3-F1 5′-CCTGGCTCTTTGGGGCTTTCGTG-3′ (forward) and Galr3-R1 5′-AGCGCGTAGAGCGCGGCCACTG-3′ (reverse); GAPDH, GAPDH-F1 5′-TGACATCAAGAAGGTGGTGAAGC-3′ (forward) and GAPDH-R1 5′-AAGGTGGAAGAGTGGGAGTTGCTG-3′ (reverse). The amplification regime consisted of a 94 °C 10-min denaturation cycle, followed by 94 °C for 25 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min, for 33 cycles. An elongation step of 72 °C for 5 min ended the PCR. Oligonucleotides for internal hybridization of PCR products were 5′-AATGGCCACGTAGCGATCCA-3′ (Galr1), 5′-GTAGCTGCAGGCTCAGGTTCC-3′ (Galr2), and 5′-GTGGCCGTGGTGAGCCTGGCCT-3′ (Galr3). Recombined Mammary Gland Transplantation—Donor mammary tissue (1 mm3) from Gal+/+ or Gal–/– 12-week-old mice was inserted into the excised fat pad of Gal+/+ or Gal–/– 3-week-old mice cleared of endogenous epithelium. This recombined mammary epithelium-stroma complex was then grafted between the abdominal cavity and skin, between the 3rd and 4th mammary glands of 3-week-old Rag1–/– mice (22Naylor M.J. Ormandy C.J. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 225: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This procedure resulted in 100% transplant survival with >95% showing ductal outgrowth. Using this method, recombinations of mammary epithelium and stroma were produced that allowed deletion of the galanin gene from stroma and/or epithelium. Histological Analysis—Mammary whole mounts were made by spreading the gland on a glass slide and fixing in 10% formalin solution. Glands were defatted in acetone before carmine alum (0.2% carmine, 0.5% aluminum sulfate) staining overnight. The whole mount was dehydrated using a graded ethanol series followed by xylene treatment for 60 min and storage and photography in methyl salicylate. Morphometric analysis was performed by counting the number of side branches, alveolar buds, or lobuloalveoli per mammary gland (n = 5) for mammary gland cultures or from four representative fields of view from whole 4th inguinal glands. PRL Treatment of Mice—On the morning of the observation of a vaginal plug, 6–8-week-old mice were implanted with a 0.25-μl per h, 28-day mini-osmotic pump (Alzet) containing unmodified PRL prepared as described (23Chen T.J. Kuo C.B. Tsai K.F. Liu J.W. Chen D.Y. Walker A.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Either 0.6 or 1.2 μg were delivered per 24 h. On the first day post-partum maternal behavior of mothers was observed, pups were examined for the presence of milk, and glands were taken for histological analysis. Mammary Gland Culture—Four-week-old BALB/c mice were implanted with estrogen, progesterone, and cholesterol pellets (41Ginsburg E. Vonderhaar B.K. Ip M. Asch B. Methods in Mammary Gland Biology and Breast Cancer Research. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Press, New York2000: 147-154Crossref Google Scholar). Following 9 days of treatment, the whole fourth glands were removed and stretched onto siliconized lens paper and placed into Petri dishes containing 2 ml of Weymouth's 152/1 medium supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), gentamycin sulfate (50 μg/ml), 20 mm HEPES, insulin (5 μg/ml), hydrocortisone (100 ng/ml), and aldosterone (100 ng/ml) (basal medium; IAH) to monitor ductal side branching, with and without 100 nm rat galanin (Auspep). To assess lobuloalveolar development ovine PRL (1 μg/ml; Sigma) was added to the basal medium with or without galanin. Glands were maintained in a tri-gas incubator at 50% O2 and 5% CO2 in air. Medium was changed after 24 h and then every second day for 6 days before morphology and histology were assessed. Transcript Profiling—Total RNA was extracted using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen), purified using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), cDNA synthesis was performed using Superscript II (Invitrogen), synthesis of Biotin-labeled cRNA was performed using an BioArray HighYield RNA Transcript labeling kit (Enzo Diagnostics) and hybridized to Affymetrix MGU74v2 GeneChips overnight as per the manufacturer's instructions. Arrays were performed in duplicate using four-six glands per treatment group from two separate replicate experiments. Analysis was performed using the Affymetrix GeneChip v5 software (MAS 5), with treatment groups compared back to IAH treatment as the baseline comparison. Principal components analysis was performed using JMP (SAS Institute). Venn diagrams were formed by selecting genes called increasing or decreasing by MAS 5 with a -fold change greater then 1.7 compared with IAH. These groups were further restricted by excluding genes with a magnitude -fold change >1.2 induced by the other treatments. Quantitative RT-PCR—Quantitative PCR was performed using LightCycler technology (Roche Applied Science). Primers were designed on the basis of mismatch to other genes for WDMN1, β-actin, WAP, β-casein, δ-casein, Elf5, Glycam1, IGF-1, GHR, SPOT 14, and prolactin receptor. PCR reactions were performed in 10-μl volume with 1 μl of cDNA, 5 pmols of each primer, and FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I enzyme mix (Roche Applied Science) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Relative quantitation of the product was performed by comparing the crossing points of different samples normalized to an internal control (β-actin). Each cycle in the linear phase of the reaction corresponds to a 2-fold difference in transcript levels between samples. Each reaction was performed in triplicate using pooled RNA from the four-six mammary glands or the treatment groups utilized for transcript profiling. Western Analysis—Following RNA extraction from mammary glands using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen), protein was extracted following the manufacturer's instructions. Protein was separated using SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore), and blocked overnight with 5% skim milk powder, 2% fetal bovine serum, 50 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20. Membranes were incubated with one of the following primary antibodies: α-milk protein (Accurate Chemical & Scientific Corporation), α-STAT5a (Upstate Biotechnology), α-phospo-STAT5, α-phospho-ERK1/2, α-ERK2, α-phospho-Akt (Ser-473), α-phospho-Akt (Thr-308), α-Akt (Cell Signaling Technology), or α-β-Actin (Sigma). 20 μg of protein was loaded per lane except for α-milk protein where 400 ng of protein was loaded. Specific binding was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) with Chemiluminescence Reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and Biomax Light Film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Prolactin Supplementation of Gal –/– Mice Allows Lactation That Is Sufficient for Pup Survival, but Lobuloalveolar Development Is Not Completely Rescued—Targeted disruption of the galanin gene resulted in failure of ductal side branching during puberty and lactational failure following the first pregnancy. We have previously ascribed this effect to the reduced levels of serum prolactin seen in Gal–/– animals, but this hypothesis has not been tested, and the defects in the mammary glands of Gal–/– have not been investigated during pregnancy (17Wynick D. Small C.J. Bacon A. Holmes F.E. Norman M. Ormandy C.J. Kilic E. Kerr N.C. Ghatei M. Talamantes F. Bloom S.R. Pachnis V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12671-12676Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). At day 12 of pregnancy the size and density of lobuloalveoli were decreased in Gal–/– mammary glands compared with that in galanin wild type (Gal+/+) mice (Fig. 1A). This defect continued throughout pregnancy, and at the 1st day post-partum, Gal–/– mammary glands showed reduced lobuloalveolar density compared with Gal+/+ mice (Fig. 1B). Histological examination showed that although the lobuloalveoli had formed, lactation had not commenced in Gal–/– mice (Fig. 1C). Examination of the stomach contents of the pups for milk showed that 11 of 12 knockout females were unable to lactate following their first pregnancy (Fig. 1D), despite the observation of normal maternal behavior and suckling of pups. Differentiation of the mammary epithelium was assessed by quantitative analysis of the mRNA levels of several milk protein genes. Mid (β-casein), and late (WAP) stage markers of epithelial cell differentiation were all decreased in Gal–/– mammary glands compared with Gal+/+ littermates (Fig. 1E). Epithelial content was assessed by quantitative measurement of keratin 18 mRNA levels and showed similar levels in Gal+/+ and Gal–/– glands (Fig. 1E). This finding, combined with the histological findings, indicate that the lobuloalveoli had formed in Gal–/– mammary glands but that differentiation and lactogenesis had failed. Thus the reduced area of epithelium apparent in the Gal–/– whole mounts and histology at term is due to a failure of lobuloalveolar engorgement because of failed onset of milk secretion, but not to a detectable decrease in epithelial cell number. A similar defect is seen in prolactin receptor heterozygous+/– mice (4Brisken C. Kaur S. Chavarria T.E. Binart N. Sutherland R.L. Weinberg R.A. Kelly P.A. Ormandy C.J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 210: 96-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), and interestingly this effect was lost following their second pregnancy, as seen in Gal–/– mice (24Ormandy C.J. Camus A. Barra J. Damotte D. Lucas B. Buteau H. Edery M. Brousse N. Babinet C. Binart N. Kelly P.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Because homozygous disruption of the galanin gene results in decreased levels of plasma PRL during pregnancy, we determined whether treatment of Gal–/– mice with PRL would rescue the defect in lobuloavleolar development and lactation. Using a mini-osmotic pump, treatment with either 0.6 or 1.2 μg of PRL per 24 h throughout the duration of pregnancy restored lactation and allowed pup survival (Fig. 1D). Mammary gland whole mounts showed a partial rescue of lobuloalveolar density (Fig. 1B), but histological examination showed that many alveoli had not commenced lactation, identified by their retention of highly proteinaceous (pink staining) contents (Fig. 1C). Analysis of milk protein gene expression revealed that PRL treatment did not even partially rescue the defect in lobuloalveolar differentiation measured by the expression of the milk proteins WDMN1 and β-casein, despite allowing pup survival (Fig. 1F). Keratin 18 levels were unchanged by treatment with PRL. Thus, although PRL treatment of Gal–/– mice restored lactation to a level sufficient for pup survival, it failed to produce any detectable rise in milk protein gene expression. If the effects on lactation seen in Gal–/– mice were only mediated via pituitary prolactin secretion then we would have expected to see some rise in milk protein levels given the rescue of lactation. Thus it is unlikely that our failure to rescue milk protein expression is solely because of insufficient administration of prolactin, and we conclude that galanin acts to influence mammary differentiation via a mechanism additional to the regulation of prolactin secretion. We have investigated this hypothesis further. Galanin and Galanin Receptors Are Differentially Expressed in the Mammary Gland—The failure to rescue milk protein expression with PRL treatment of Gal–/– mice indicated that galanin may act by an additional mechanism to regulate mammary epithelial cell differentiation. Expression of mRNA for galanin and Galr 1–3 was examined by RT-PCR using mouse mammary glands collected at various stages of development (Fig. 2). The galanin transcript was expressed at all time points, from estrous in nulliparous mice through to lactation, but was not detected during involution. Expression of transcripts for the galanin receptors was tightly regulated and coordinated. Transcripts for all three receptors were most highly expressed at day 7 of pregnancy. Galr1 transcripts were only detected at this time, whereas Galr2 mRNA was also detected at lower levels throughout the later stages of pregnancy and involution, and Galr3 mRNA was also detected during estrous and diestrous in the nulliparous mice. Very low expression of Galr3 mRNA could also be detected at 5 days of involution with longer exposure (data not shown). The coordinated regulation of galanin receptors in the mammary gland and increase of galanin in serum during pregnancy suggested a possible endocrine role for galanin, whereas the expression of galanin in the mammary gland also raised the possibility of an autocrine or paracrine mechanism. An Autocrine or Paracrine Mechanism of Galanin Action Is Not Essential for Mammary Gland Development—To determine whether galanin produced by the mammary gland was necessary for normal development, we employed mammary epithelial transplantation. Donor mammary epithelium from mature Gal+/+ or Gal–/– mice was inserted into the excised fat pad of 3-week-old Gal+/+ or Gal–/– mice cleared of endogenous epithelium. The recombined mammary epithelium-stroma complex was grafted between the skin and abdominal cavity of 3-week-old Rag1–/– mice (22Naylor M.J. Ormandy C.J. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 225: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This allowed deletion of the galanin gene from the stroma and/or epithelium in the context of a normal endocrine background including normal circulating prolactin and galanin levels. Ablation of galanin from the stroma, epithelium, or from both did not recapitulate the failure of ductal side branching observed in nulliparous Gal–/– mice nor the impaired lobuloalveolar development seen on the 1st day post-partum (Fig. 3) (data not shown). These data demonstrate that an autocrine/paracrine role for galanin is not essential for mammary development in the context of normal levels of circulating galanin. Thus endocrine galanin is sufficient for normal mammary gland development in the absence of mammary-produced galanin. Mammary-produced galanin could, however, play a role in pathological situations where endocrine galanin levels become deficient. Galanin Can Act Directly on the Mammary Gland to Induce Lobuloalveolar Development—Galanin may act in an endocrine manner via mammary galanin receptors to induce lobuloalveolar development. As galanin treatment in vivo would indirectly induce mammary development via endocrine regulation of PRL and progesterone, we utilized an in vitro mammary gland culture model of mammogenesis (25Plaut K. Ikeda M. Vonderhaar B.K. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1843-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Ductal side branching similar to that seen during puberty was produced when mammary glands were cultured in IAH (Fig. 4). The addition of 100 nm galanin to the IAH-containing medium did not alter ductal or lobuloalveolar development measured by quantitative morphology and histology. When PRL was added to the culture medium, lobuloalveolar development was observed (Fig. 4), although as noted previously, not to the extent observed during pregnancy. The addition of 100 nm galanin to IAH + PRL medium resulted in a 3.8-fold increase in the number of lobuloalveoli per gland (8.6 ± 2.1 IAH + PRL versus 33.0 IAH + PRL + galanin; p = 0.005), causing the glands to resemble those observed during pregnancy. Additionally, the size of individual lobuloalveoli in IAH + PRL + galanin-treated glands was also greater than in IAH + PRL-treated glands (Fig. 4). These data show that galanin can act directly on the mammary gland to augment PRL-mediated lobuloalveolar development, establishing galanin as a new endocrine factor active during this phase of development. Galanin Action on Mammary Gland Differentiation Results in Activation of STAT5—To investigate the mechanisms behind the induction of lobuloalveolar development by galanin we examined activation of the JAK/STAT, MAP kinase and PI 3-kinase signaling pathways by PRL and galanin. As expected, in mammary glands treated with PRL we saw an increase in total STAT5a and a dramatic increase in phosphorylated STAT5 in these glands (Fig. 4). Similarly, PRL treatment resulted in the sustained activation the MAP kinase pathway. Although the level of total ERK1/2 decreased, the levels of phosphorylated ERK dramatically increased in mammary glands exposed to PRL. Examination of PI 3-kinase signaling revealed decreased mobility but no increase in total Akt in glands receiving PRL. PRL did not increase phosphorylation of Thr-308 and Ser-473 residues of Akt, those most commonly associated with Akt activation. The decrease in mobility may represent phosphorylation of other sites on the Akt molecule. Surprisingly, galanin treatment alone resulted in activation of the JAK/STAT pathway, similar to PRL (Fig. 4), but in stark contrast to PRL, galanin did not induce sustained activation of the MAP kinase pathway or alter the mobility of Akt. When mammary glands were treated with galanin and PRL there were no dramatic changes to the effects produced by either hormone alone. The apparent slight diminution in pERK and increase in Akt and pAkt (Thr-308) in the figure were not consistent between experimental replicates. We examined markers of mammary epithelial cell differentiation by Western blot. Again as expected, mammary glands treated with PRL synthesized the milk proteins WAP and α- and β-casein. Strikingly, galanin alone produced induction of milk protein synthesis despite failing to induce lobuloalveolar development (Fig. 4). These results show that galanin can induce epithelial cell differentiation, as measured by milk protein synthesis and the sustained activation of the JAK/STAT pathway. Whether galanin acts directly via its receptors to activate STAT5 or whether this effect is indirect remains a question for further investigation. The salient point is that galanin treatment caused sustained activation of the STAT5 pathway and cell differentiation measured by milk protein expression. In contrast, prolactin caused sustained activation the JAK/STAT and the additional activation of the MAP kinase and possibly PI 3-kinase pathways (and is known to activate these pathways directly) and induced both epithelial cell differentiation and epithelial cell proliferation. Together these hormones have a synergistic effect and allow lobuloalveolar development to proceed in vitro to a level beyond that achievable by PRL alone. In conclusion, Gal–/– mammary glands show failed differentiation despite prolactin supplementation, and wild type glands in organ culture show differentiation in response to galanin alone. These observations establish galanin as a hormone w"
https://openalex.org/W2155499206,"Steroid hormones play an essential role in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes, such as growth, metabolism, aging, and hormone-sensitive cancers. Estrogens are no exception and influence growth, differentiation, and functioning of many target tissues, such as the mammary gland, uterus, hypothalamus, pituitary, bone, and liver. Although very similar in structure, each steroid class (i.e., estrogens, androgens, progestins, mineral corticoids, or glucocorticoids) is responsible for distinct physiological processes. To permit specific biological responses for a given steroid class, specific proteins are responsible for steroid bioactivation, action, and inactivation, yet they have low or no affinity to other classes. Estrogens make no exception and possess their own set of related proteins. To understand the molecular basis underlying estrogen recognition from other steroids, structural features of estrogen-specific proteins were analyzed along with their ability to discriminate between steroid hormones belonging to different classes. Hence, the study of all estrogen-specific proteins for which an atomic structure has been determined demonstrated that a common steroid-binding pocket architecture is shared by these proteins. This architecture is composed of the following elements: i) a glutamate residue acting as a proton acceptor coupled with a proton donor that interact with the steroid O3; ii) a proton donor (His or Ser) that interacts with O17; iii) a highly conserved sandwich-like structure providing steric hindrance and preventing C19 steroid from binding; and iv) several amino acid residues interacting with the C18. As these different estrogen-specific proteins are not related in overall sequence, the inference is that the steroid binding site in these proteins has originated by convergent evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1997042517,"The motor activity of smooth muscle myosin II is regulated by the regulatory light chain phosphorylation, but it is not understood how phosphorylation activates motor activity. To address this question, we produced asymmetric heavy meromyosin (HMM), which is composed of a wild-type (WT) heavy chain and a mutant heavy chain having no motor activity (i.e. S236T or G457A). The actin-activated ATPase activities (V max) of asymmetric HMMs were only 21.8 and 8.4% of the wild-type HMM for S236A/WT HMM and G456A/WT HMM, respectively. If the two heads of HMM are independent for their ATPase activities, asymmetric HMM should show 50% of the activity of wild-type HMM; however, the activity of asymmetric HMM was much lower than the expected value. The results suggest that the activity of the wild-type head is attenuated by the presence of inactive head. Consistently, the actin-gliding velocity of the asymmetric HMM (i.e. S236T/WT or G457A/WT) was less than one-fifth of the wild-type HMM. The present study supports an idea that the two heads of smooth muscle myosin II interact with each other and the presence of two active heads is required for full activation. The motor activity of smooth muscle myosin II is regulated by the regulatory light chain phosphorylation, but it is not understood how phosphorylation activates motor activity. To address this question, we produced asymmetric heavy meromyosin (HMM), which is composed of a wild-type (WT) heavy chain and a mutant heavy chain having no motor activity (i.e. S236T or G457A). The actin-activated ATPase activities (V max) of asymmetric HMMs were only 21.8 and 8.4% of the wild-type HMM for S236A/WT HMM and G456A/WT HMM, respectively. If the two heads of HMM are independent for their ATPase activities, asymmetric HMM should show 50% of the activity of wild-type HMM; however, the activity of asymmetric HMM was much lower than the expected value. The results suggest that the activity of the wild-type head is attenuated by the presence of inactive head. Consistently, the actin-gliding velocity of the asymmetric HMM (i.e. S236T/WT or G457A/WT) was less than one-fifth of the wild-type HMM. The present study supports an idea that the two heads of smooth muscle myosin II interact with each other and the presence of two active heads is required for full activation. Myosin II is a hexametric molecule composed of two heavy chains, two essential light chains (ELC), 1The abbreviations used are: ELC, essential light chain; HMM, smooth muscle heavy meromyosin(s); RLC, regulatory light chain; DTT, dithiothreitol; MLCK, myosin light chain kinase; WT, wild-type; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); Mant, 2-(3)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl). and two regulatory lights chains (RLC). Each heavy chain consists of a globular motor domain, and a light chain binding domain, and a α-helical coiled-coil rod (1Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. Elzinga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 36-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 3Sellers J.R. Curr. Opin.

It is known that the motor activity of smooth muscle, and nonmuscle myosin II is activated by phosphorylation of RLC. The dephosphorylated forms of those myosins have little actin-dependent ATPase activity and are unable to move actin filaments in vitro, whereas the phosphorylated forms are active in both ATPase and motility activities. The location of RLC on myosin molecule is at the C-terminal long α-helix portion of the heavy chain in the myosin head region (5Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar), and the phosphorylation site, Ser-19 on RLC, responsible for the activation of myosin motor activity (2Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 3Sellers J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 4Tan J.L. Ravid S. Spudich J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 721-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), is far from the effector sites (i.e. ATP and actin binding sites in the motor domain). Therefore, it is unlikely that the phosphate moiety on RLC directly interacts with the effector sites, thus activating the motor activity of myosin II. This raises a hypothesis that the phosphorylation at Ser-19 on RLC induces a conformational change in the head of myosin II, and this facilitates the product release from the active site upon actin binding, thus activating the motor activity. A key question is whether the nature of such a conformational change is responsible for the activation of the motor function. It has been known that the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of the myosin II motor activity requires the two-headed structure of myosin II (6Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2380-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 7Cremo C.R. Sellers J.R. Facemyer K.C. J. Biol.

Faust L.Z. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). A key component of the proposed mechanism is that the RLC phosphorylation alters the interaction between the two heads of myosin II that converts the inhibited form to the activated form. However, the nature of such an interaction between the two heads, which are required for the full activation, is still unclear. Previously, we produced SMDHMM, a single-headed HMM, which is composed of one intact head and one truncated head having an RLC domain and the coiled-coil tail and found that whereas dephosphorylated SMDHMM has little actin-activated ATPase activity, the phosphorylated SMDHMM is partially activated, suggesting that the interaction between the two RLC domains on the two heads is important but not sufficient for the full activation (11Li X.D. Saito J. Ikebe R. Mabuchi K. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2254-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Sweeney et al. (12Sweeney H.L. Chen L.Q. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41273-41277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) further showed that even the presence of the entire light chain binding domain is not sufficient for the full activation of myosin II by phosphorylation, implying that full regulation of ATPase activity and motility can only be obtained with two intact heads. Recently, Konishi et al. (13Konishi K. Kojima S. Katoh T. Yazawa M. Kato K. Fujiwara K. Onishi H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) reported that phosphorylated smooth muscle HMM has much higher actin-activated ATPase activity than the phosphorylated single-headed smooth HMM and smooth myosin subfragment 1. These findings suggest that an entire head is required for the phosphorylation-induced full activation of the motor function of myosin II. A critical question is whether the structure of the entire head itself is sufficient for the activation. In other words, does the activity of the one head influence the activity of the other head? In the present study, we produced asymmetric smooth muscle HMMs that are composed of a wild-type heavy chain and a mutant heavy chain, in which the motor activity is inactivated by mutation. We produced two mutant heavy chains, in which Ser-236 2We have used sequence numbers for Dictyostelium myosin II for consistency with our previous reports and ease in comparison with the structural studies of the active site. The corresponding gizzard smooth muscle myosin sequence numbers (in parentheses) are Ser-236 (244) and Gly-457 (468). and Gly-457 are changed to Thr and Ala, respectively. It was shown previously that the mutation of Ser-236 in the Switch I loop to Thr completely abolished the actin-activated ATPase activity, although the mutant can produce the ternary complex (myosin-ADP-P) with a normal rate constant (14Li X.D. Rhodes T.E. Ikebe R. Kambara T. White H.D. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27404-27411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the mutation of Gly-457 in the Switch II loop to Ala abolishes the ATP hydrolysis of myosin II, thus failing to form the ternary complex, although it can bind ATP and dissociate from actin (15Kambara T.

We isolated HMMs having a mutant and a wild-type head and characterized their motor activities. Our results clearly showed that the presence of two functional myosin heads is required for the full activation of smooth myosin by phosphorylation, implying the cooperativity between two phosphorylated heads. Materials—Restriction enzymes and modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle acetone powder according to Spudich and Watt (16Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) was prepared from frozen turkey gizzard (17Ikebe M. Stepinska M. Kemp B.E. Means A.R. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13285-13290Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was purchased from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). Anti-FLAG M2 antibody and anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel were from Sigma. FLAG peptide (Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys-His) was synthesized in the Peptide Core Facility at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Anti-His antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Mant-2-dATP was provided by Dr. Howard D. White (Eastern Virginia Medical School). Construction of Smooth HMM Mutants—A smooth muscle HMM (6D3) in baculovirus transfer vector pBluebac4 was used as template for the following manipulation. A His tag (His6) or FLAG tag (Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys-His) was created at the 3′ side of the smooth HMM heavy chain (6D3) by site-directed mutagenesis. Those two constructs were named 6D3His and 6D3Flag. Two SpeI sites were created at the 5′ side of the initiation codon and the 3′ side of the stop codon by site-directed mutagenesis. 6D3His or 6D3Flag having SpeI sites were digested by SpeI and ligated into pFast-NheI(+) transfer vector (which was derived from the original pFastBac transfer vector by introducing NheI in the polylinker region). Two single site mutations, S236T and G457A, were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis by using 6D3His/pFast as templates as described previously (14Li X.D. Rhodes T.E. Ikebe R. Kambara T. White H.D. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27404-27411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The mutations were confirmed by direct sequencing analysis. The baculovirus for expressing HMM heavy chain was prepared by using the Bac-N-Blue kit (Invitrogen). The recombinant baculoviruses expressing ELC or RLC were prepared as described before (8Sata M. Matsuura M. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11113-11118Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of Asymmetric HMM—To express WT(F)/ST(H) (asymmetric HMM-S236T, one wild-type head and one S236T mutant head) (Fig. 1), 200 ml of sf9 insect cells, co-infected with four separate viruses encoding 6D3-WT-Flag, 6D3-S236T-His, ELC, and RLC, were cultured in a spinner flask containing 600 ml of TMN-FH medium (Sigma) for 3 days. After the cells were harvested by centrifugation, the cell pellets were lysed with 30 ml of Lysis Buffer (0.4 m KCl, 50 mm KPi, pH 7.5, 15 mm imidazole, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 5 mm ATP) with sonication. All of the purification procedures were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise indicated. After centrifugation at 120,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was incubated with 2 ml of Ni2+-agarose in a 50-ml conical tube on a rotating wheel for 1–2 h. The resin suspension was then loaded on a column (1 × 10 cm) and was washed with 30 ml of solution A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). WT(F)/ST(H) and ST(H)/ST(H), bound to Ni2+-agarose, were eluted with solution B (0.2 m imidazole pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin), and 1 ml of each fraction was collected. The fractions containing protein were pooled and loaded on a column containing 1 ml of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel pre-equilibrated with solution A. After washing with 10 ml of solution A, the column was eluted with 0.2 mg/ml FLAG peptide (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys) in solution A. Only WT(F)/ST(H) bound to the anti-FLAG M2-agarose gel and was eluted by FLAG peptide. Similar procedures as above were used for expression and preparation of WT(F)/GA(H) (asymmetric HMM-G457A with one wild-type head and one G457A mutant head) and WT(F)/WT(H), except 6D3-G456A-His or 6D3-WT-His was used instead of 6D3-S236T-His for co-infection of sf9 cells. To express WT(H)/WT(H) or WT(F)/WT(F), which has only one kind of tag (His tag or FLAG tag, respectively), sf9 cells were co-infected with three kinds of baculoviruses expressing 6D3-WT-His or 6D3-WT-Flag, ELC, and RLC. Wild-type homodimer HMM (i.e. WT(H)/WT(H) or WT(F)/WT(F)) was purified by a single affinity chromatography, Ni2+-agarose, or anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel, respectively. Mutant homodimer HMM (i.e. ST(H)/ST(H) or GA(H)/GA(H)) was produced by co-infection of three kinds of baculoviruses expressing 6D3-S236T-His or 6D3-G457A-His, ELC, and RLC, and prepared by Ni2+-agarose chromatography. Approximately 0.1 mg of the asymmetric molecules and 1 mg of symmetric molecules were purified from 600 ml of culture. Phosphorylated HMMs were prepared as following. About 1 μm of purified HMM was incubated with 10 μg/ml MLCK, 15 μg/ml calmodulin, and 0.5 mm ATPγS in a solution of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm ATPγS, and 5 mm mercaptoethanol at 25 °C for 30 min. Phosphorylated HMM was repurified by Ni2+-agarose chromatography. The phosphorylation of RLC was confirmed by urea gel (20Perrie W.T. Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1970; 119: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). All of the above samples were dialyzed extensively with solution D (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 48 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT) overnight. The dialyzed samples were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 min. The concentration of purified HMM was determined by the Bradford method (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216261) Google Scholar) using chicken gizzard smooth muscle HMM as a standard. Single Turnover ATPase Assay—This assay measures the rate of phosphate release from the acto-HMM ADP·Pi state. Since phosphate release is rate-limiting, the decrease in fluorescence as Mant ADP dissociates from HMM can be used to measure phosphate release rates. Assays were performed at 25 °C in a temperature-controlled stopped-flow spectrophotometer (KinTek Co., Clarence, PA) equipped with a 75-watt xenon lamp. Mant nucleotide was excited at 360 nm, and emission was collected through a 420-nm cut-off filter. The experiment was done with a three-syringe system for double mixing. The first syringe (1 ml) contained 0.5 μm thiophosphorylated myosin head (WT(F)/WT(H) or WT(F)/GA(H)) in a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 48 mm KCl, 2 mm, and 1 mm DTT; the second one (1 ml) contained 1 μm Mant-2-dATP in a solution of 20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5 and 4 mm MgCl2; and the third one (1 ml) contained 0 or 40 μm (equal to 1.74 mg/ml) of actin in a solution of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 24 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm ATP. The delay time between the first and second mixing was 5 s. The conditions for first mixing were as follows: 0.25 μm myosin head, 0.5 μm Mant-2-dATP, 24 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm DTT. The conditions for the second mixing were as follows: 0.167 μm myosin head, 0.333 μm Mant nucleotide, 0 or 13.3 μm (equal to 0.58 mg/ml) actin, 333 μm ATP, 24 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.333 mm DTT. The collected data were analyzed with the Kaleidagraph software (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Data were fit to a double exponential model, because a single exponential model consistently missed a fast phase for both samples. Other Assays—Steady state ATPase assay, in vitro actin-gliding assay, and SDS-PAGE are the same as described previously (14Li X.D. Rhodes T.E. Ikebe R. Kambara T. White H.D. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27404-27411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of Asymmetric HMM—To produce asymmetric HMM, we introduced the two distinct tags, a His tag and a FLAG tag, at the C-terminal end of the smooth muscle HMM constructs, respectively. The sf9 cells were co-infected with recombinant baculoviruses expressing HMM heavy chain with His tag, HMM heavy chain with FLAG tag, ELC, and RLC, respectively, to prepare HMM composed of a heavy chain with a His tag and a heavy chain with a FLAG tag. First, we prepared the wild-type HMM containing a His tag and a FLAG tag on each heavy chain. When the cells were co-infected with the recombinant baculoviruses expressing the heavy chain, ELC, and RLC, respectively, three kinds of HMMs, WT(H)/WT(H), WT(F)/WT(H), and WT(F)/WT(F), were produced (see Fig. 1). To isolate the heterodimer, WT(F)/WT(H), from the two types of homodimers (i.e. WT(H)/WT(H) and WT(F)/WT(F)), the cell extract was subjected to two types of affinity chromatography, Ni2+-agarose affinity chromatography, and anti-FLAG M2 affinity chromatography. The extract was applied to a Ni2+-agarose column, and HMM containing His tag was eluted by 0.2 m imidazole-containing buffer. The eluted fraction contained WT(H)/WT(H), a homodimer of HMM containing His tag on both heavy chains, and WT(H)/WT(F), a heterodimer containing His tag and FLAG tag on each of the heavy chains. The mixture was then applied to an anti-FLAG M2 affinity column, and HMM containing a FLAG tag was eluted by adding FLAG peptide. As a control, the homodimers HMM containing two His-tagged heavy chains (i.e. WT(H)/WT(H), ST(H)/ST(H), or GA(H)/GA(H)) and two FLAG-tagged heavy chains (i.e. WT(F)/WT(F)), respectively, were also expressed and purified using similar procedures, except that only one affinity chromatography was used for purification (i.e. Ni2+-agarose for two His-tagged HMM and anti-FLAG M2 affinity agarose for two FLAG-tagged HMM). The purified HMMs were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis using anti-His antibodies and anti-FLAG antibodies as probes. As shown in Fig. 2A, WT(F)/WT(H) was recognized by both anti-His antibodies and anti-FLAG antibodies, respectively. On the other hand, WT(H)/WT(H) and WT(F)/WT(F) were recognized only by anti-His antibodies and anti-FLAG antibodies, respectively. Asymmetric HMMs, WT(F)/ST(H) and WT(F)/GA(H), were isolated by using similar procedures (Fig. 2). The Western blot analysis of the asymmetric HMMs revealed that these HMMs contain both His and FLAG tags in the molecule, indicating that these HMMs are the heterodimer composed of one wild-type heavy chain and one mutant heavy chain. Previously, we found that smooth muscle HMM mutants, S236T or G457A, bind to actin in the absence of ATP and dissociate from actin in the presence of ATP. Therefore, it is anticipated that the asymmetric HMM containing a mutant heavy chain can bind to actin in an ATP-dependent manner. To test this, we mixed the isolated HMMs with F-actin and ultra-centrifuged the mixture in the presence and absence of ATP. Fig. 2C shows SDS-PAGE of the pellets and the supernatants of acto-HMM after centrifugation. Both asymmetric HMMs and WT HMM co-precipitated with actin in the absence of ATP, and the majority of HMMs was dissociated from actin in the presence of ATP and recovered in the supernatant. It should be noted that asymmetric HMM as well as WT HMM did not precipitate in the absence of actin (not shown). ATPase Activity of the HMM Constructs— Table I shows the Ca2+- and K+(EDTA)-ATPase activity of the purified HMMs. ST(H)/ST(H) HMM showed nearly normal Ca2+-ATPase activity but very low K+(EDTA)-ATPase activity, which is consistent with our previous report (14Li X.D. Rhodes T.E. Ikebe R. Kambara T. White H.D. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27404-27411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 15Kambara T. Rhodes T.E. Ikebe R. Yamada M. White H.D. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16400-16406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). On the other hand, GA(H)/GA(H) HMM had no detectable ATPase activity in either condition. This is also consistent with our previous result (15Kambara T. Rhodes T.E. Ikebe R. Yamada M. White H.D. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16400-16406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). K+(EDTA)-ATPase activity of WT(F)/ST(H) HMM was about half of that of WT(F)/WT(H), whereas the Ca2+-ATPase activity was similar to those of WT(F)/WT(H) HMM and ST(H)/ST(H) HMM. On the other hand, both Ca2+-ATPase and K+(EDTA)-ATPase activities of WT(F)/GA(H) HMM were approximately half of those of the wild-type HMM. These results suggest that the ATPase activities in these conditions are independent of the activity of the partner head.Table ICa2+- and K+ (EDTA)-ATPase activity of asymmetric and symmetric HMMsCa2+-ATPaseK+(EDTA)-ATPases-1WT(F)/WT(H)0.9301.765WT(F)/ST(H)0.8000.830WT(F)/GA(H)0.5071.070ST(H)/ST(H)0.7880.022GA(H)/GA(H)<0.003<0.003 Open table in a new tab To assess the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of the motor function of the constructs, we measured the actin-activated ATPase activities of HMMs. As expected, the actin-activated ATPase activities of all wild-type HMM (i.e. WT(H)/WT(H), WT(F)/WT(F), and WT(F)/WT(H)) were well regulated by phosphorylation (i.e. little actin-activated ATPase activity in the unphosphorylated state and high actin-activated ATPase activity in the phosphorylated state) (Table II). On the other hand, ST(H)/ST(H) HMM showed virtually no phosphorylation dependence on the actin-activated ATPase activity, although the basal ATPase activity was retained. GA(H)/GA(H) HMM showed hardly any ATPase activity in all conditions (Table II).Table IIMg 2+-ATPase activity of asymmetric and symmetric HMMsUnphosphorylatedPhosphorylated0 mg/ml actin2 mg/ml actin0 mg/ml actin2 mg/ml actinWT(H)/WT(H)0.014 ± 0.0020.043 ± 0.0110.042 ± 0.0151.306 ± 0.056WT(F)/WT(F)0.0130.0330.0340.935WT(F)/WT(H)0.013 ± 0.0010.052 ± 0.0130.044 ± 0.0150.840 ± 0.134ST(H)/ST(H)0.0250.0500.0780.069WT(F)/ST(H)0.025 ± 0.0050.068 ± 0.0260.048 ± 0.0220.340 ± 0.017GA(H)/GA(H)0.0020.0040.0020.004WT(F)/GA(H)0.012 ± 0.0040.034 ± 0.0020.030 ± 0.0090.096 ± 0.018 Open table in a new tab Fig. 3 shows the actin-activated ATPase activity of asymmetric HMMs as a function of actin concentration. The actin-activated ATPase activities of asymmetric HMMs were increased by phosphorylation; however, the activities were significantly lower than that of WT(F)/WT(H) HMM. The V max of the actin-activated ATPase activities of phosphorylated WT(F)/ST(H) HMM and WT(F)/GA(H) HMM were 0.404 and 0.156 s–1, respectively. These values are much lower than half the value of the phosphorylated WT(F)/WT(H) HMM (1.85 s–1) (i.e. 0.93 s–1) (Table III). This implies that the presence of an inactive head significantly attenuates the activity of the wild-type head. In other words, two functional heads are required for the full activation of smooth muscle myosin II. It has been pointed out that the steady-state values of the actin-activated ATPase activity may underestimate the extent of phosphorylation-dependent regulation of myosin, because a minor contamination of the unregulated myosin having a high ATPase activity would significantly increase the apparent ATPase activity of the dephosphorylated myosin (12Sweeney H.L. Chen L.Q. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41273-41277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). On the contrary, single turnover measurement could provide more accurate information on the regulation, even if the samples contain a minor fraction of unregulated components. Therefore, we performed a single turnover experiment of the actin-activated ATPase reaction of thiophosphorylated WT(F)/GA(H) HMM and WT(F)/WT(H) HMM by using Mant-2-dATP as a substrate (Fig. 4). HMM was first mixed with of Mant-2-dATP to form HMM-ADP-P complex, and then actin was added. The release of the product was monitored by measuring the decrease in the fluorescence intensity of Mant nucleotide. The decrease in fluorescence intensity could be best fitted with two exponentials for WT(F)/WT(H) HMM. The weighted single turnover rate for thiophosphorylated WT(F)/WT(H) HMM (0.359 s–1) was very similar to the steady-state rate in the presence of 13.3 μm actin. For phosphorylated WT(F)/GA(H) HMM, the fluorescence decrease of Mant moiety could be fit in two exponentials. The weighted single turnover rate for thiophosphorylated WT(F)/GA(H) HMM (0.0737 s–1) was much lower than that of thiophosphorylated WT(F)/WT(H) HMM (Table IV).

Open table in a new tab In Vitro Actin-gliding Activity—To determine the mechanical activity of the asymmetric HMMs directly, we performed an actin surface-gliding assay. Consistent with previous reports (14Li X.D. Rhodes T.E. Ikebe R. Kambara T. White H.D. Ikebe M. J. Biol.

As shown in Fig. 5, thiophosphorylated wild-type HMM, WT(F)/WT(H), moved actin filament smoothly at a velocity of 0.27 ± 0.03 μm/s at 25 °C. On the other hand, the actin-gliding velocities of thiophosphorylated asymmetric HMMs, both WT(F)/ST(H) HMM and WT(F)/GA(H) HMM, were only one-seventh to one-sixth and one-thirteenth of that of wild-type HMM, respectively. We also examined whether the presence of inactive HMM interferes with the movement of actin in the surface gliding assay. We mixed an equal amount of the thiophosphorylated WT(H)/WT(H) HMM and the thiophosphorylated GA(H)/GA(H) HMM and applied it onto the flow cell to perform the actin-gliding assay. As shown in Fig. 5, the actin-gliding velocity was not significantly decreased by the presence of the inactive mutant HMM. Therefore, the slow actin-gliding velocity of the phosphorylated WT(F)/GA(H) should be due to the negative influence of the inactive head to the wild-type head of HMM. Our results clearly demonstrate that the two functionally active heads are required for full activation of smooth muscle myosin motor activity in the phosphorylated state. It was shown previously that the mutation of Ser-236 in the Switch I loop to Thr abolishes the actin-activated ATPase activity of phosphorylated smooth muscle myosin II although the S236T mutant has normal ATP hydrolysis, thus forming myosin-ADP-P intermediate (14Li X.D.

It was also shown that the mutation of Gly-457 in the Switch II loop to Ala abolishes ATP hydrolysis of myosin II, thus inactivating the motor activity completely, although the mutation does not hamper the ATP binding and thus the ATP-induced dissociation of myosin II from actin (15Kambara T. Rhodes T.E. Ikebe R. Yamada M. White H.D. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16400-16406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The present results for the mutant homodimers are consistent with these earlier findings. The most important finding in the present study is that the wild-type head of the HMM heterodimer having a mutant head exhibited significantly lower actin-activated ATPase activity than the wild-type heads in the homodimer. The reduced activity of the wild-type head was more dramatic in HMM having a G457A mutant head. We think that the decrease in the actin-activated ATPase activity of the phosphorylated wild-type head in heterodimer HMM is due to the disruption of the proper interaction between the heads. In other words, the phosphorylated wild-type HMM heads interact with each other, which is critical for full activation of the actin-activated ATPase activity, whereas the inactive mutant head cannot properly interact with the neighboring wild-type head. The results indicate that interhead interaction is required for the full activation of the phosphorylated smooth muscle myosin. It was shown previously that the motor activity of smooth muscle myosin composed of a complete head and a regulatory light chain binding domain shows an actin-activated ATPase activity significantly lower than that of HMM having complete two heads, although the ATPase activity is enhanced by RLC phosphorylation (11Li X.D. Saito J. Ikebe R. Mabuchi K. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2254-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 13Konishi K. Kojima S. Katoh T. Yazawa M. Kato K. Fujiwara K. Onishi H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The present results are consistent with these earlier reports and indicates that the interaction between the two heads at the motor domain is important to obtain the full activation by phosphorylation. Quite interestingly, the activation of the ATPase activity of the wild-type head was hampered more prominently in the presence of the G457A mutant head than the S236T mutant head. The former mutation inhibits ATP hydrolysis, thus forming myosin-ATP as a stable intermediate, whereas the latter mutant can form myosin-ADP-P as a stable intermediate; therefore, it is suggested that the conformational change upon ATP hydrolysis is critical to induce the cooperativity between the heads that leads to phosphorylation-induced activation. It is of interest that the decrease in the ATPase activity of the wild-type head in the heterodimer HMM was only observed for the actin-activated ATPase activity in the phosphorylated state, and the basal ATPase activity as well as Ca2+- and K+(EDTA)-ATPase activity were not influenced by the presence of the inactive head. This suggests that the cooperative activation of HMM involves the binding of the heads to actin. There are two possibilities to account for the nature of the cooperativity. One is that the two heads directly interact with each other, increasing the ATPase turnover rate. The other is that the binding of the one head to actin facilitates the binding of the other head to actin to enhance the product release, thus facilitating the cycle. It has been shown that dephosphorylated smooth muscle myosin heads interact with each other at the converter domain of the one head with the motor core domain of the other head (22Wendt T. Taylor D. Trybus K.M. Taylor K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4361-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Similar interaction between the heads may be operating in the heterodimer HMM in the present study. However, further studies are required to clarify the mechanism underlying the requirement of the two active heads for full activity of smooth muscle myosin II. The single turnover data of the thiophosphorylated WT HMM was fitted by the two rate constants. There is a possibility that the slow product release is due to some dead myosin present in the preparation. However, we think this is less likely, because the fraction of the slow component does not markedly vary from preparation to preparation. The slow product release component was also reported by Ellison et al. (23Ellison P.A. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15142-15151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Previously, it was shown that the product release of skeletal myosin subfragment 1 is fitted with two rate constants at saturating actin concentration, and it was explained that the slower rate constant is due to the slow ATP hydrolysis step of the actin-bound myosin head (24White H.D. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9859-9865Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The slower rate constant in Fig. 4 may be explained in part due to the similar process. However, it is anticipated that the majority of the myosin heads are dissociated from actin in the experimental conditions used, and it is less likely that the slower rate constant is entirely due to the hydrolysis step of the actin-bound myosin heads. Alternatively, the slower rate constant may be due to the product release from myosin-ADP-P without binding to actin, whereas the faster rate constant is via the actin binding process. Since GA(H)/GA(H) HMM showed virtually no hydrolysis, we think that both the fast and slow components of the asymmetric HMM represent the product release from the wild type head. The actin-gliding velocity of HMM having the mutant head was much lower than the wild-type HMM, and the difference was much more pronounced than that for the actin-activated ATPase activity. This is not due to the presence of the inactive heads on the coverslip during the actin-gliding assay, because the presence of GA(H)/GA(H) on the glass surface did not decrease the velocity of actin filaments by WT(H)/WT(H). In order to move actin filaments, each head of myosin must cycle repetitively between attached and detached phases. In the attached phase, of duration T on, the head undergoes the “working” stroke, and in the detached phase, of duration T off, it undergoes the “recovery” stroke, which returns the head to its initial conformation (25Howard J. Nature. 1997; 389: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). By recovering during the detached phase, the myosin motor avoids stepping back and so progresses through the working distance during each cycle. The actin-gliding velocity (ν) is determined by the working distance (δ) and attached duration (T on), ν = δ/T on. Therefore, the high actin-gliding velocity of double-headed HMM (WT(F)/WT(H)) could be due to the large working distance and/or short attached duration. Tyska et al. (26Tyska M.J. Dupuis D.E. Guilford W.H. Patlak J.B. Waller G.S. Trybus K.M. Warshaw D.M. Lowey S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4402-4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) measured the unitary displacement and force produced by a single molecule of the double-headed and single-headed smooth muscle myosins randomly oriented on the coverslip. Single-headed myosin produces approximately half of the displacement and force of double-headed myosin during a unitary interaction with actin, and it was proposed that muscle myosins require both heads to generate maximal force and motion, although this may be due to the random orientation of the heads (27Tanaka H. Ishijima A. Honda M. Saito K. Yanagida T. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1886-1894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The very low actin-gliding velocity of WT(F)/GA(H) may partially be explained by the decrease in the working distance in addition to the slow turnover rate of WT(F)/GA(H). The turnover rate of ATP hydrolysis by myosin is determined by the combination of the duration of attached phase and the detached phase (turnover rate = 1/T total = 1/(T on + T off)). During the cross-bridge cycling, smooth muscle myosin heads spend a majority of the time in the detached state (T off ≫ T on). Therefore, the turnover rate of smooth muscle myosin is largely determined by the detached phase. If the attachment of the first head on actin facilitates the attachment of the second head to actin, the overall duration for each turnover would be decreased, thus increasing the turnover rate for two-headed myosin. It is likely that this kind of cooperativity only exists between two heads of phosphorylated smooth muscle HMM. Direct chemical cross-linking and three-dimensional image reconstruction of smooth muscle HMM have revealed that the orientation and geometry of two heads is dependent on the phosphorylation state (22Wendt T. Taylor D. Trybus K.M. Taylor K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4361-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 28Wu X. Clack B.A. Zhi G. Stull J.T. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20328-20335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is plausible that the significant decrease in the turnover rate of the heterodimer HMM having an inactive head is due to the lack of the cooperative binding to actin. We thank Dr. H. D.

This lesion results in transcriptional errors and mutations and is linked to neurodegeneration, teratogenesis, cancer, and other pathologies. We demonstrate that the neonatal central nervous system of transgenic mice carrying the tetracycline-regulable DNA repair gene formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (fpg) has a 50% reduction in 8-oxo-dG levels. This enhanced DNA repair is suppressed by treatment with doxycycline.
