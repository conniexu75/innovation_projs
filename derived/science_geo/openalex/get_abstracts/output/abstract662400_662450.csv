https://openalex.org/W3094415511,"Coronavirus infection causes diffuse alveolar damage leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome. The absence of ex vivo models of human alveolar epithelium is hindering an understanding of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathogenesis. Here, we report a feeder-free, scalable, chemically defined, and modular alveolosphere culture system for the propagation and differentiation of human alveolar type 2 cells/pneumocytes derived from primary lung tissue. Cultured pneumocytes express the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor type-2 (ACE2) and can be infected with virus. Transcriptome and histological analysis of infected alveolospheres mirror features of COVID-19 lungs, including emergence of interferon (IFN)-mediated inflammatory responses, loss of surfactant proteins, and apoptosis. Treatment of alveolospheres with IFNs recapitulates features of virus infection, including cell death. In contrast, alveolospheres pretreated with low-dose IFNs show a reduction in viral replication, suggesting the prophylactic effectiveness of IFNs against SARS-CoV-2. Human stem cell-based alveolospheres, thus, provide novel insights into COVID-19 pathogenesis and can serve as a model for understanding human respiratory diseases."

Here, we investigated whether anti-tumor immunity can be enhanced through induction of trained immunity. Pre-treatment of mice with β-glucan, a fungal-derived prototypical agonist of trained immunity, resulted in diminished tumor growth. The anti-tumor effect of β-glucan-induced trained immunity was associated with transcriptomic and epigenetic rewiring of granulopoiesis and neutrophil reprogramming toward an anti-tumor phenotype; this process required type I interferon signaling irrespective of adaptive immunity in the host. Adoptive transfer of neutrophils from β-glucan-trained mice to naive recipients suppressed tumor growth in the latter in a ROS-dependent manner. Moreover, the anti-tumor effect of β-glucan-induced trained granulopoiesis was transmissible by bone marrow transplantation to recipient naive mice. Our findings identify a novel and therapeutically relevant anti-tumor facet of trained immunity involving appropriate rewiring of granulopoiesis."

Here we used multiplexed single-cell RNA-seq to profile 198 cancer cell lines from 22 cancer types. We identified 12 expression programs that are recurrently heterogeneous within multiple cancer cell lines. These programs are associated with diverse biological processes, including cell cycle, senescence, stress and interferon responses, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and protein metabolism. Most of these programs recapitulate those recently identified as heterogeneous within human tumors. We prioritized specific cell lines as models of cellular heterogeneity and used them to study subpopulations of senescence-related cells, demonstrating their dynamics, regulation and unique drug sensitivities, which were predictive of clinical response. Our work describes the landscape of heterogeneity within diverse cancer cell lines and identifies recurrent patterns of heterogeneity that are shared between tumors and specific cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W3095871885,"Correction of disease-causing mutations in human embryos holds the potential to reduce the burden of inherited genetic disorders and improve fertility treatments for couples with disease-causing mutations in lieu of embryo selection. Here, we evaluate repair outcomes of a Cas9-induced double-strand break (DSB) introduced on the paternal chromosome at the EYS locus, which carries a frameshift mutation causing blindness. We show that the most common repair outcome is microhomology-mediated end joining, which occurs during the first cell cycle in the zygote, leading to embryos with non-mosaic restoration of the reading frame. Notably, about half of the breaks remain unrepaired, resulting in an undetectable paternal allele and, after mitosis, loss of one or both chromosomal arms. Correspondingly, Cas9 off-target cleavage results in chromosomal losses and hemizygous indels because of cleavage of both alleles. These results demonstrate the ability to manipulate chromosome content and reveal significant challenges for mutation correction in human embryos."

We have combined lineage tracing with antibody cloning from single B cells to examine the role of affinity in B cell selection into germinal centers (GCs) and the memory B cell compartment in mice immunized with an HIV-1 antigen. We find that contemporaneously developing memory and GC B cells differ in their affinity for antigen throughout the immune response. Whereas GC cells and their precursors are enriched in antigen binding, memory B cells are not. Thus, the polyclonal memory B cell compartment is composed of B cells that were activated during the immune response but whose antigen binding affinity failed to support further clonal expansion in the GC.

Most effective vaccines elicit memory B cells that produce rapid recall humoral immune responses upon pathogen challenge. However, not all vaccines are equally effective or able to produce lasting neutralizing responses. For example, HIV-1 vaccine development has been particularly vexing, in part, because there is little understanding of how memory B cells expressing broadly neutralizing antibodies are selected or evolve in response to series of related viruses or sequential immunogens (Escolano et al., 2016Escolano A.

In mice, memory B cell production begins early after the initial immunization when activated precursors rapidly develop into memory cells, enter germinal centers (GCs) or differentiate into plasma cells (Akkaya et al., 2020Akkaya M.

The first wave of memory cells emerges before GC maturation and is composed primarily of immunoglobulin M (IgM)-expressing B cells that have undergone a small number of divisions and carry few if any somatic mutations (Inamine et al., 2005Inamine A.

Subsequent rounds of memory B cell development occur in GCs after B cells acquire affinity enhancing somatic mutations and undergo class switch recombination (Suan et al., 2017Suan D. Krautler N.J.

Immunol. 2017; 18: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, the memory B cell pool is composed of cells with diverse origins. Recall immune responses are more rapid than primary responses and produce higher levels of high-affinity antibodies, in part, because long-lived memory cells promptly develop into short-lived antibody-producing plasma cells (Askonas and Williamson, 1972Askonas B.A. Williamson A.R.

In addition, memory B cells can re-enter GCs wherein they undergo further rounds of somatic mutation (Bende et al., 2007Bende R.J. van Maldegem F. Triesscheijn M. Wormhoudt T.A.

B cell receptor affinity for antigen is one of the important determinants in the cell fate decision for plasma cell and GC B cell differentiation. B cells with higher affinity receptors tend to develop into plasma cells (Kräutler et al., 2017Kräutler N.J. Suan D. Butt D. Bourne K. Hermes J.R. Chan T.D. Sundling C. Kaplan W. Schofield P.

Med. 2000; 191: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In addition, GC entry is in large measure gated on affinity competition for antigen (Schwickert et al., 2011Schwickert T.A. Victora G.D. Fooksman D.R. Kamphorst A.O. Mugnier M.R. Gitlin A.D. Dustin M.L. Nussenzweig M.C.

In the absence of competition, B cells with relatively low-affinity receptors enter GCs but are outcompeted for entry in the presence of higher affinity cells (Abbott et al., 2018Abbott R.K. Lee J.H.

How affinity might influence the memory B cell fate decision has been studied primarily using transgenic B cells with pre-determined antigen binding affinities or by identifying antigen binding cells in polyclonal systems (Smith et al., 1997Smith K.G.

Steach H.R. Jenkins M.K. Humoral immunity. Apoptosis and antigen affinity limit effector cell differentiation of a single naïve B cell.Science. 2015; 347: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In elegant single B cell transfer experiments, memory cells developing after allophycocyanin immunization showed low levels of antigen binding as measured by flow cytometry (Taylor et al., 2015Taylor J.J. Pape K.A. Steach H.R. Jenkins M.K. Humoral immunity. Apoptosis and antigen affinity limit effector cell differentiation of a single naïve B cell.Science. 2015; 347: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In addition, anti-HEL transgenic B cells challenged with either high or low-affinity antigens developed higher number of memory cells in response to the lower affinity challenge (Taylor et al., 2015Taylor J.J. Pape K.A. Steach H.R. Jenkins M.K. Humoral immunity. Apoptosis and antigen affinity limit effector cell differentiation of a single naïve B cell.Science. 2015; 347: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Similar results were also obtained when pre-memory IgG1 expressing GC B cells were examined (Suan et al., 2017Suan D. Krautler N.J. Maag J.L.V. Butt D. Bourne K. Hermes J.R. Avery D.T. Young C. Statham A. Elliott M. et al.CCR6 Defines Memory B Cell Precursors in Mouse and Human Germinal Centers, Revealing Light-Zone Location and Predominant Low Antigen Affinity.Immunity. 2017; 47: 1142-1153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, the requirement for antigen binding or transgenic receptor expression introduced a potential bias in these experiments and the precise role of affinity in shaping the memory B cell fate decision in a polyclonal immune response remains poorly understood. Here, we report on fate-mapping experiments that directly compare the affinity of B cells entering the memory compartment with those entering or remaining in the GCs during a polyclonal immune response. To analyze memory B cells formed after immunization without introducing the potential bias of detectable antigen binding affinity, we used S1pr2-ERT2cre mice (Shinnakasu et al., 2016Shinnakasu R. Inoue T. Kometani K. Moriyama S. Adachi Y. Nakayama M. Takahashi Y. Fukuyama H. Okada T. Kurosaki T. Regulated selection of germinal-center cells into the memory B cell compartment.Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17: 861-869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). S1pr2 is expressed in pre-GC and GC B cells but not in naive B cells (Shinnakasu et al., 2016Shinnakasu R. Inoue T. Kometani K. Moriyama S. Adachi Y. Nakayama M. Takahashi Y. Fukuyama H. Okada T. Kurosaki T. Regulated selection of germinal-center cells into the memory B cell compartment.Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17: 861-869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Figure S1A). Tamoxifen administration permanently labels S1pr2-expressing cells with green or red fluorescent proteins in mice that carry S1pr2-ERT2cre and Rosa26-lox-stop-lox-ZSGreen or Rosa26-lox-stop-lox-tdTomato (S1pr2CreERT2/+R26ZSGreen/+ S1pr2CreERT2/+R26tdT/+) (Madisen et al., 2010Madisen L. Zwingman T.A. Sunkin S.M. Oh S.W. Zariwala H.A. Gu H. Ng L.L. Palmiter R.D. Hawrylycz M.J. Jones A.R. et al.A robust and high-throughput Cre reporting and characterization system for the whole mouse brain.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). In addition, any plasma or memory B cells that develop from the S1pr2-expressing B cells will also be labeled (Figure S1A). To examine the relationship between the GC and the memory compartment, we initially immunized S1pr2CreERT2/+R26ZSGreen/+ mice with the hapten 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl acetyl conjugated to ovalbumin (NP-OVA) (day 0) and gave a single oral administration of tamoxifen on day 5 (Figure 1A). Igλ expression was used as a surrogate for antigen-specific cells, because the primary GC response to NP in C57BL/6 mice is dominated by Igλ-expressing B cells (Jack et al., 1977Jack R.S. Imanishi-Kari T. Rajewsky K. Idiotypic analysis of the response of C57BL:6 mice to the (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl)acetyl group.Eur. J. Immunol. 1977; 7: 559-565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas Igλ+ B cells comprise an average of 5.7% of the naive follicular B cell compartment, 43% of the ZSGreen+ GC B cells were Igλ+ on day 14 and 35% on day 42 (Figures 1B, 1C, and S1C). In contrast, only 9.7% of the memory B cell population derived from contemporaneously labeled cells was composed of Igλ-expressing B cells when assayed on day 42 (Figures 1B, 1C, and S1D). Therefore, Igλ+ B cells, and by inference NP-specific B cells, are significantly enriched in the GC on day 14 when S1pr2-expressing B cells are labeled on day 5 after immunization (p < 0.0001) (Figure 1C). In contrast, the memory B cells derived from S1pr2-expressing B cells labeled at the same time are not significantly enriched for Igλ expression compared to naive B cells (p = 0.4418) (Figure 1C). Similar results were obtained by analyzing NP binding in GC and memory B cells that had undergone switch recombination in C57Bl6 mice and S1pr2CreERT2/+R26tdT/+ mice in the absence of tamoxifen administration (Figure S1B). To determine whether responses to complex protein antigens also show differences between GC and memory compartments, we immunized S1pr2CreERT2/+R26tdT/+ mice with an HIV-1 derived protein antigen TM4-Core (HIV-1 TM4-Core) and administered tamoxifen on day 5 (Dosenovic et al., 2015Dosenovic P. von Boehmer L. Escolano A. Jardine J. Freund N.T. Gitlin A.D. McGuire A.T. Kulp D.W. Oliveira T. Scharf L. et al.Immunization for HIV-1 Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies in Human Ig Knockin Mice.Cell. 2015; 161: 1505-1515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) (Figure 1D). Antigen binding B cells were difficult to detect in the resting B cell population (0.3%) (Figures 1E and 1F). In contrast, HIV-1 TM4-Core binding cells comprised 40% of the S1pr2CreERT2/+R26tdT/+-labeled GC B cells on day 14 after immunization (p < 0.0001) (Figures 1E and 1F) and 18% on day 42 (Figure S1C). However, there was no significant enrichment of such cells in the S1pr2CreERT2/+R26tdT/+ memory B cell compartment assayed on day 42 (p = 0.8687) (Figures 1F and S1D). Thus, whereas antigen-specific S1pr2 expressing GC B cell precursors labeled by a single administration of tamoxifen on day 5 are highly expanded in the GC 14 days after immunization, these cells are far less enriched in the memory B cell compartment. The number of memory B cells that emerge during an immune response varies with time (Shinnakasu et al., 2016Shinnakasu R. Inoue T. Kometani K. Moriyama S. Adachi Y. Nakayama M. Takahashi Y. Fukuyama H. Okada T. Kurosaki T. Regulated selection of germinal-center cells into the memory B cell compartment.Nat.

A Temporal Switch in the Germinal Center Determines Differential Output of Memory B and Plasma Cells.Immunity. 2016; 44: 116-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). To examine the relationship between contemporaneously formed GC and memory B cells at different time points during the immune response, we immunized S1pr2CreERT2/+R26ZSGreen /+ mice with HIV-1 TM4-Core and administered a single dose of tamoxifen by oral gavage on days 9, 15, or 21 after immunization. The draining lymph nodes were assayed 3 days after tamoxifen administration (Figure 2A). In the absence of immunization, labeled GC, or memory B cells were nearly undetectable in the lymph node (Figure 2B). In contrast, we found labeled GC and memory B cells in the draining lymph nodes at all 3 time points after immunization with HIV-1 TM4-Core (Figures 2B–2D). The percentage of antigen binding GC cells was similar at all 3 time points with significant enrichment over the naive compartment (on average 31%, 33%, and 21% on days 12, 18, and 24, respectively) (Figures 2C and 2D). However, there was no significant enrichment of antigen-binding cells in the contemporaneously produced memory B cell compartment when compared to naive B cells (5.8% p = 0.2105, 3.5% p = 0.6547, and 1.4% p = 0.9724, on days 12, 18, and 24, respectively) (Figures 2C and 2D). As an alternative to fate mapping by Cre and tamoxifen administration, we used VavTg Col1amCherry/+ mice to examine the antigen binding properties of class-switched memory B cells formed between days 9–12 after immunization (Gitlin et al., 2014Gitlin A.D. Shulman Z. Nussenzweig M.C. Clonal selection in the germinal centre by regulated proliferation and hypermutation.Nature. 2014; 509: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). VavTg Col1amCherry/+ mice express H2B-mCherry constitutively. Administration of doxycycline represses H2B-mCherry synthesis, and dividing cells dilute the marker protein in direct proportion to the number of cell divisions. Thus, resting follicular B cells express high levels of mCherry (mCherryhi), and highly proliferative GC cells dilute it to show only low levels (mCherrylow) (Figure 2E). In the absence of immunization or doxycycline administration, there were few, if any, mCherrylow class switched memory B cells (Figure 2F). Doxycycline administration 9–12 days after immunization with HIV-1 TM4-Core or NP-OVA produced mCherrylow GC and memory B cells deriving from them (Figures 2E and 2F). mCherrylow antigen binding B cells were enriched in the GC (HIV-1 TM4-Core: 26.8%; NP-OVA: 26.6%) (Figures 2G and 2H). However, there was no significant enrichment of mCherrylow antigen binding cells in the contemporaneously produced memory B cells (HIV-1 TM4-Core: 1.7% p = 0.9647; NP-OVA: 3.5% p = 0.9606) (Figures 2G and 2H). Thus, memory B cells were not significantly enriched for detectable antigen binding even when antigen binding cells accounted for up to 50% of the contemporaneous GC. To examine the B cell receptors expressed by GC and contemporaneously developing memory B cells, we characterized the antibodies produced by individual fate mapped cells on days 12, 18, or 24 after immunization (Figures 2A, 3A , and S2A). GC B cells showed a broad distribution of Ig mutations at all time points ranging from 0–29 mutations increasing significantly over time (mean of 5.7–9.3 between days 12–24, p < 0.0001) (Figure 3A). Contemporaneously produced memory B cell Ig genes carried significantly fewer mutations than GC B cells at all time points assayed (mean of 2.5 versus 5.7 on day 12, p < 0.0001; 3.5 versus 8.4 on day 18, p < 0.0001; and 3.7 versus 9.3 on day 24, p < 0.0001) (Figure 3A). Moreover, the number of mutations accumulating over time in memory B cells did not parallel the GC. There was no significant difference in mutation frequency in memory B cell antibodies over time after immunization (day 9 versus day 18, p = 0.58; day 9 versus day 24, p = 0.21) (Figure 3A). The same results were found by analyzing the number of amino acids mutations (Figure S2B). Thus, memory B cells carry fewer somatic mutations than contemporaneously produced GC cells at all time points assayed and there is no significant increase in the number of mutations in memory cells emerging at later time points.Figure S2Contemporaneous GC and Memory B Cells, Related to Figures 3 and 4Show full caption(A) Representative flow cytometry profiles for the sorted tdT+ GC cells and tdT+ memory B cells in Figure 2A (3 independent experiments).(B) As in Figure 3A but with the number of amino acid mutations (Groups of 15-20 mice, 3 independent experiments, n = 112-221 antibody genes sequenced in each group, 2 way Anova, ∗∗∗∗p ≤ 0.0001).(C) Graph shows the number of mutations (nucleotides: IgH + IgL) of the produced Fabs from GC and memory B cells at the different time points in Figure 3A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A) Representative flow cytometry profiles for the sorted tdT+ GC cells and tdT+ memory B cells in Figure 2A (3 independent experiments).

(C) Graph shows the number of mutations (nucleotides: IgH + IgL) of the produced Fabs from GC and memory B cells at the different time points in Figure 3A. To examine the clonal relationships between contemporaneously produced memory B cells and GC cells, we compared antibodies produced by memory and GC B cells in the same lymph node between days 9–12 after immunization (Figure 3B). In contrast to the GC B cells, 90% of which were part of an expanded clone, only 6.6% of the memory cells were found in expanded clones (Figure 3B). Moreover, only 6 out of 75 antibodies obtained from the memory compartment were represented in the 313 sequences obtained from the GC (Figure 3B). The memory antibodies that were shared between the 2 compartments were found as clones or singlets in the corresponding GCs (Figure 3B). Phylogenetic trees based on heavy and light chain nucleotide sequences indicate that 2 of the 4 memory B cell antibodies were GC-derived (LN2 yellow and LN3 red) and 2 others originated from the same B cell clone that entered the GC (LN2 red and green) (Figures 3C and 3D). Thus, in contrast to GC B cells, there are few expanded clones in the memory compartment, and there is limited overlap between the 2 compartments. To compare the affinity of the B cell receptors expressed by contemporaneously developing GC and memory B cells, we produced 234 representative Fabs from fate-mapped cells (Figures 2A and S2C). Biolayer interferometry was used to measure the affinity of antibodies obtained from mice on days 12, 18, or 24 after immunization with HIV-1 TM4-Core (Figures 4A and 4B ). To document monovalent interactions, the HIV-1 TM4-Core trimer was immobilized on the biosensor chip and subsequently exposed to the cloned Fab. 3BNC60, an anti-HIV-1 CD4 binding site-specific antibody, served as a positive control, and 38 Fabs obtained from random naive follicle origin B cells as negative controls (Figure 4A). Fabs derived from GC B cells showed varying levels of affinity for TM4-Core at all time points assayed (KD: undetectable to >0.001 nM) (Figures 4B and S3A). Overall, 32% of the GC antibodies had measurable monovalent binding affinities for TM4-Core, a number that is entirely consistent with the flow cytometry data (Figures 1F and 2D). In contrast, only 2 of the 125 memory B cell Fabs showed measurable affinities in this assay (p = 0.023) (Figures 4B and S3A). The difference between memory and GC B cell affinity was not directly related to number of mutations. GC antibodies with 0–5 mutations displayed the same proportion of high- and low-affinity binders as antibodies with 6–12 or greater than 13 mutations (0–5 mutations,29%; 6–12 mutations, 36%; and more than 13 mutations, 27%) (Figures 4C and 4D). Thus, there was no correlation between the KD and the number of mutations (r2 = 0.079 p = 0.35) (Figure 4E).Figure S3Affinity and Avidity in Contemporaneous GC and Memory B Cells, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) KD (nM) for GC and memory B cell Fabs showing a significant affinity for TM4-Core in Figure 4B.

The vast majority of age-related neurodegenerative diseases are characterized as protein conformational disorders, which involve self-assemblies of misfolded proteins into fibrillary aggregates (Soto and Pritzkow, 2018Soto C.

Neurosci. 2015; 38: 87-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Among these pathogenic proteins, the fibrillogenesis of microtubule-associated protein tau occurs as a hallmark pathological change in diverse illnesses referred to as tauopathies, and it is mechanistically linked to the neurodegenerative processes in these disorders (Iqbal et al., 2016Iqbal K.

Goedert M. Tau pathology and neurodegeneration.Lancet Neurol. 2013; 12: 609-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Tau in the central nervous system is composed of six isoforms, which are classified into three- and four-repeat species according to the number of repeat domains (Buée et al., 2000Buée L. Bussière T. Buée-Scherrer V. Delacourte A. Hof P.R. Tau protein isoforms, phosphorylation and role in neurodegenerative disorders.Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2000; 33: 95-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1476) Google Scholar). Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-type primary age-related tauopathy (PART) are characterized by tau pathologies formed by all isoforms, although a significant subset of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) syndromes is neuropathologically unfolded by exclusive fibrillization of either three- or four-repeat tau isoforms (Buée et al., 2000Buée L. Bussière T. Buée-Scherrer V. Delacourte A. Hof P.R. Tau protein isoforms, phosphorylation and role in neurodegenerative disorders.Brain Res. Brain Res.

Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1121-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (2036) Google Scholar). The distinct tau conformers are likely to determine subcellular, cellular, and regional localization of tau deposits in a disease-specific fashion, provoking characteristic symptoms associated with deteriorations of affected neurons and neural circuits (Forrest et al., 2019Forrest S.L. Kril J.J. Halliday G.M. Cellular and regional vulnerability in frontotemporal tauopathies.Acta Neuropathol. 2019; 138: 705-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In line with this mechanism, there exist clear distinctions among neuropathological features of AD/PART and major tau-positive FTLD disorders, including three-repeat tauopathies represented by Pick’s disease (PiD) and four-repeat tauopathies exemplified by progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD) (Lee et al., 2001Lee V.M. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Neurodegenerative tauopathies.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1121-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (2036) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, substantial overlaps have been noted among symptomatic phenotypes derived from these pathologies, impeding the differentiation of clinical syndromes by estimation of underlying pathological alterations (Rabinovici and Miller, 2010Rabinovici G.D.

In vivo imaging technologies, such as positron emission tomography (PET) with specific radioligands for amyloid-beta and tau fibrils, have enabled visualization of AD-type neuropathologies in living subjects, facilitating diagnosis and staging of AD dementia and its prodrome. The tau PET probes available for these clinical assays are classified into three chemotypes consisting of 18F-labeled THK5351 (Harada et al., 2016Harada R. Okamura N. Furumoto S. Furukawa K.

Unlike for AD tau lesions, high-contrast PET detection of three- and four-repeat tau deposits in FTLD patients has been controversial. Tau-related radiosignals yielded by 18F-flortaucipir and 11C-PBB3 in PSP and CBD cases were less than 20% of the corresponding signals in patients with advanced AD (Endo et al., 2019Endo H.

However, those observations were attributed to the cross-reactivity of this compound with monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), which is upregulated in reactive astrocytes (Harada et al., 2018Harada R. Ishiki A. Kai H. Sato N. Furukawa K. Furumoto S. Tago T. Tomita N. Watanuki S. Hiraoka K. et al.Correlations of 18F-THK5351 PET with postmortem burden of tau and astrogliosis in Alzheimer disease.J.

In addition, most “second-generation” tau PET probes are analogs of 18F-fluotaucipir and are not overtly more reactive with non-AD tau assemblies than 18F-fluotaucipir and 11C-PBB3 (Aguero et al., 2019Aguero C.

Med. 2018; 59: 675-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Among these radiotracers, an 18F-flortaucipir analog, 18F-PI-2620, was reported to show promising characteristics as an imaging agent for PSP tau aggregates in a non-clinical study (Kroth et al., 2019Kroth H. Oden F. Molette J. Schieferstein H. Capotosti F. Mueller A. Berndt M. Schmitt-Willich H. Darmency V.

J. Nucl. Med. Mol. Imaging. 2019; 46: 2178-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), although the in vivo performance of this radioligand for the differentiation of PSP subjects from controls has not markedly exceeded that of 18F-flortaucipir (Brendel et al., 2020Brendel M.

Respondek G. et al.Assessment of 18F-PI-2620 as a biomarker in progressive supranuclear palsy.JAMA Neurol. 2020; : e202526Google Scholar). 11C-PBB3 was originally designed to capture tau fibrils in a wide range of tauopathies (Maruyama et al., 2013Maruyama M. Shimada H. Suhara T. Shinotoh H. Ji B. Maeda J. Zhang M.R. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Ono M. et al.Imaging of tau pathology in a tauopathy mouse model and in Alzheimer patients compared to normal controls.Neuron. 2013; 79: 1094-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar) and was demonstrated to react with three- and four-repeat tau aggregates in human brain tissues with a higher binding potential than 18F-flortaucipir (Ono et al., 2017Ono M. Sahara N. Kumata K. Ji B. Ni R. Koga S. Dickson D.W. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Yoshida M. et al.Distinct binding of PET ligands PBB3 and AV-1451 to tau fibril strains in neurodegenerative tauopathies.Brain. 2017; 140: 764-780PubMed Google Scholar). However, rapid conversion of 11C-PBB3 into a metabolite resulted in a relatively low entry of the unmetabolized compound into the brain (Hashimoto et al., 2014Hashimoto H. Kawamura K. Igarashi N. Takei M. Fujishiro T. Aihara Y. Shiomi S. Muto M. Ito T.

Ono M. et al.Imaging of tau pathology in a tauopathy mouse model and in Alzheimer patients compared to normal controls.Neuron. 2013; 79: 1094-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), hampering a sensitive recognition of fibrillary aggregates in FTLD tauopathies that are less abundant than AD tau deposits. To overcome this technical issue, in the current work, we modified the chemical structure of PBB3 to generate a chemical with a relatively high metabolic stability, aiming at unambiguous investigations of tau fibril density and extent in each of the individuals with AD and FTLD. The new compound, PM-PBB3 (propanol modification of PBB3), was fluorinated in consideration of the advantages of an 18F-labeled probe over 11C-radiochemicals for broader availability and higher PET scan throughput. Non-clinical assays revealed the capability of PM-PBB3 for high-sensitivity illumination of tau pathologies in a murine model bimodally by in vivo optical and PET imaging from single-cell to brain-wide scales, potentially serving for the discovery of candidate therapeutics counteracting the neurodegenerative tau pathogenesis. Subsequent applications of 18F-PM-PBB3 to clinical PET assays, along with neuropathological data obtained from scanned subjects, demonstrated appropriate kinetic and binding profiles of this probe for personalized evaluations of tau depositions in AD and various FTLD syndromes. The original compound, PBB3 (Figure 1A), was found to be promptly conjugated with sulfate at a hydroxy moiety following systemic injection (Hashimoto et al., 2015Hashimoto H. Kawamura K. Takei M. Igarashi N. Fujishiro T. Shiomi S. Watanabe R. Muto M. Furutsuka K. Ito T. et al.Identification of a major radiometabolite of [11C]PBB3.Nucl. Med. Biol. 2015; 42: 905-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To suppress this metabolic conversion, we substituted this substructure with the fluoro-isopropanol group, resulting in the generation of PM-PBB3 (Figure 1A). This modification allowed 18F radiolabeling of the probe using a tosylate precursor (Figure S1), and the strong binding of PM-PBB3 to a non-AD tau filament was supported by a molecular dynamics simulation based on ultrastructures of tau assemblies determined by cryo-electron microscope (Figure S2). Similar to PBB3 (Maruyama et al., 2013Maruyama M. Shimada H. Suhara T. Shinotoh H. Ji B. Maeda J. Zhang M.R. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Ono M. et al.Imaging of tau pathology in a tauopathy mouse model and in Alzheimer patients compared to normal controls.Neuron. 2013; 79: 1094-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar; Ono et al., 2017Ono M.

Yoshida M. et al.Distinct binding of PET ligands PBB3 and AV-1451 to tau fibril strains in neurodegenerative tauopathies.Brain. 2017; 140: 764-780PubMed Google Scholar), PM-PBB3 is self-fluorescent, and its reactivity with pathological tau fibrils is assessable by fluorescence labeling of brain sections derived from tauopathy patients. Triple staining of brain slices with PM-PBB3, antibody against phosphorylated tau (AT8), and Gallyas-Braak silver impregnation (GB) demonstrated binding of PM-PBB3 to tau lesions in AD hippocampal formation, which were composed of six tau isoforms (Figure 1B). Furthermore, PM-PBB3 conspicuously illuminated Pick bodies constituted of three-repeat tau isoforms in PiD frontal cortex and four-repeat tau lesions in striatum of PSP and CBD (Figure 1B). We then radiosynthesized 18F-PM-PBB3 and examined its in vitro binding characteristics. Autoradiography of tissue sections demonstrated that 18F-PM-PBB3 radiosignals were intensely distributed in the anatomical structures enriched with AD and PSP tau fibrils (Figure 1C). Localization of the autoradiographic labeling was in line with histological features obtained from the same sections, as abundant neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neuropil threads in the AD subiculum, and coiled bodies and tufted astrocytes in middle gray matter layers of the PSP motor cortex were captured by non-radiolabeled PM-PBB3 (areas 1 and 3 in Figure 1D). In contrast, the lack of overt autoradiographic radioligand binding spatially agreed with minimal PM-PBB3 fluorescence in white matter of the AD temporal cortex and in superficial gray matter layers of the PSP motor cortex (areas 2 and 4 in Figure 1D). We also quantified the affinity of 18F-PM-PBB3 for tau aggregates in homogenized AD frontal cortical and PSP motor cortical tissues (Figure 1E). 18F-PM-PBB3 displayed high-affinity, high-capacity binding in AD homogenates (dissociation constant [KD], 7.63 nM; concentration of binding components [Bmax], 5,743 pmol/g; binding potential [BP = Bmax/KD], 752.7; Figure 1F). The radioligand bound in PSP tissues with lower capacity but higher affinity than in AD tissues (KD, 3.44 nM; Bmax, 688.2 pmol/g; BP, 199.9). The BPs for 18F-PM-PBB3 were 1.2 and 1.6 times higher than the values for 11C-PBB3 in the same AD and PSP homogenate samples, respectively (Figure 1F). The binding of 18F-PM-PBB3 in AD homogenates was partially and heterologously blocked by BTA-1, which is a Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB) analog and binds to Aβ aggregates with high affinity, with a large inhibition constant (Ki) value (379.1 nM; Figure 1G), suggesting that 18F-PM-PBB3 is incapable of sensitively capturing Aβ deposits in AD homogenates (Klunk et al., 2001Klunk W.E.

Moreover, the heterologous blockade by BTA-1 is likely to stem primarily from its low-affinity binding to AD tau fibrils (Klunk et al., 2001Klunk W.E. Wang Y. Huang G.F. Debnath M.L. Holt D.P.

Notably, minimal displacement of 18F-PM-PBB3 binding was observed in the presence of the monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) inhibitor clorgiline, or the MAO-B inhibitor selegiline, in AD frontal cortex homogenates (Figure 1G), suggesting that 18F-PM-PBB3 barely cross-reacts with off-target binding sites on monoamine oxidases, unlike the reported binding of 18F-THK5351 and 18F-flortaucipir to MAO-B (Harada et al., 2018Harada R.

For assessing in vivo interactions of PM-PBB3 with intracellular tau deposits, we utilized a murine transgenic (Tg) model of tauopathies dubbed rTg4510, which overexpresses a human four-repeat tau isoform with the P301L mutation causative of familial FTLD (Sahara et al., 2014Sahara N.

The BP for 18F-PM-PBB3 was 1.5-fold higher than the value for 11C-PBB3 in the same Tg samples (Figure S3). Ex vivo autoradiography of brain tissues collected from mice demonstrated accumulations of 18F-PM-PBB3 in the Tg forebrain harboring neuronal tau inclusions (Figure 2B). Conversely, there was no noticeable increase of 18F-PM-PBB3 retentions in the nTg forebrain (Figure 2B). Triple staining of brain sections used for ex vivo autoradiography with PM-PBB3 fluorescence, GB, and AT8 illustrated strong binding of PM-PBB3 to intracellular tau aggregates in the hippocampus and neocortex of a Tg mouse (Figure 2C). To assess the time course of in vivo labeling of intraneuronal tau aggregates with PM-PBB3, we conducted intravital two-photon laser fluorescence microscopy with a cranial window to the somatosensory cortex of the Tg and nTg mice. Comparison of PM-PBB3 and PBB3 signals in the same field of view indicated rapid entry of these probes into the brain after intravenous probe administration, reaching tau aggregates within 5 min (Figure 2D). Quantification of the background-corrected fluorescence intensity revealed that PM-PBB3 yielded 3-fold higher peak fluorescence signals in the same neurons burdened with tau aggregate than PBB3 (Figure 2E). In contrast, no noticeable increases in fluorescence signals were produced by intravenously injected PM-PBB3 in neurons of nTg mice (Figure 2D). The in vivo performance of 18F-PM-PBB3 and 11C-PBB3 as a PET probe was then examined by a head-to-head comparison in the same mice (Figures 2F–2H). 18F-PM-PBB3 rapidly entered the brain after intravenous administration, and the peak radioactivity uptake was 1.4-fold higher than that of 11C-PBB3 (Figure 2G). This was followed by a prompt washout of radioactivity from the brains of nTg mice, whereas the clearance was retarded in the Tg forebrain, reflecting radioligand binding to tau deposits. 18F-PM-PBB3 generated a more than 2-fold higher contrast for tau lesions in the Tg hippocampus relative to nTg controls than 11C-PBB3 (Figure 2H). The high brain uptake and tau contrast by 18F-PM-PBB3 versus 11C-PBB3 were partly attributable to its stability against bio-metabolism (Table S1). 18F-PM-PBB3 has been confirmed to be decomposed to a hydrophilic radiometabolite in human plasma at a slower rate than metabolizing 11C-PBB3 (Figures S4A and S4B). Encouraged by non-clinical results, 18F-PM-PBB3 was applied to PET imaging in human subjects. As depicted in Figure 3A, the retention of 18F-PM-PBB3 clearly visualized the neocortical and limbic dominance of six tau isoform accumulations in an AD patient and subcortical dominance of four-repeat tau depositions in a PSP patient with Richardson’s syndrome (PSP-Richardson), a PSP subcategory with a typical clinical phenotype (Höglinger et al., 2017Höglinger G.U. Respondek G. Stamelou M. Kurz C. Josephs K.A. Lang A.E. Mollenhauer B. Müller U. Nilsson C. Whitwell J.L. et al.Movement Disorder Society-endorsed PSP Study GroupClinical diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy: the movement disorder society criteria.Mov. Disord. 2017; 32: 853-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar), in sharp contrast to the low radiosignals sustained in the parenchyma of elderly healthy control (HC) brains (Figure 3A). The uptake of 18F-PM-PBB3 peaked rapidly after radioligand injection and subsequently declined by more than 50% across all regions of the HC brain in the next 30 min, resulting in uniformly low radioligand retention (Figure 3B). The clearance of 18F-PM-PBB3 was profoundly slowed in tau-burdened areas of the AD and PSP brains, conceivably reflecting the specific radioligand binding to tau aggregates (Figure 3B). The cerebellum was included in brain areas with the lowest radioactivity retention (Figure 3B), supporting the use of cerebellar gray matter as a reference tissue with a minimal tau fibril load for quantification of the radioligand binding. The target-to-reference ratio of the radioactivity (standardized uptake value ratio [SUVR]) was progressively increased in affected brain areas until ~60 min after radioligand injection, and then, it almost plateaued at ~90 min (Figure 3C). In subjects who underwent arterial blood sampling during the PET scan, full kinetic analyses showed that mathematical models with a single input function could robustly quantify the tracer binding (Figures S4C–S4E; Table S2). Distribution volume ratio (DVR) also displayed an excellent correlation to SUVR values determined from 20-min scan data obtained from 90 min or later after the radioligand injection in HCs and AD patients (r > 0.987) and in PSP patients (r > 0.992; Figures S5A and S5B). Therefore, we choose the earliest time frame, 90–110 min, for the most practical scan protocol. A simulation analysis also demonstrated that 18F-PM-PBB3 binding measures are insensitive to regional and global cerebral blood flow alterations (Figures S6A–S6C). To examine the superiority of 18F-PM-PBB3 over 11C-PBB3 as a high-sensitivity tau PET probe, we carried out a head-to-head comparison of PET data with these radioligands in the same individuals. The peak uptake of 18F-PM-PBB3 in the brain (Figure 3B) was approximately 2-fold higher than that of 11C-PBB3 (Maruyama et al., 2013Maruyama M. Shimada H. Suhara T. Shinotoh H. Ji B. Maeda J.

https://openalex.org/W3097788036,"Summary A greater understanding of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) regulation is required for dissecting protective versus detrimental immunity to pathogens that cause chronic infections such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). We have shown that systemic administration of Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) or β-glucan reprograms HSCs in the bone marrow (BM) via a type II interferon (IFN-II) or interleukin-1 (IL1) response, respectively, which confers protective trained immunity against Mtb. Here, we demonstrate that, unlike BCG or β-glucan, Mtb reprograms HSCs via an IFN-I response that suppresses myelopoiesis and impairs development of protective trained immunity to Mtb. Mechanistically, IFN-I signaling dysregulates iron metabolism, depolarizes mitochondrial membrane potential, and induces cell death specifically in myeloid progenitors. Additionally, activation of the IFN-I/iron axis in HSCs impairs trained immunity to Mtb infection. These results identify an unanticipated immune evasion strategy of Mtb in the BM that controls the magnitude and intrinsic anti-microbial capacity of innate immunity to infection."

Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to profile neuronal transcriptomes at multiple stages in the developing <i>Drosophila</i> visual system. We devise an efficient strategy for profiling neurons at multiple time points in a single pool, thereby minimizing batch effects and maximizing the reliability of time-course data. A transcriptional atlas spanning multiple stages is generated, including more than 150 distinct neuronal populations; of these, 88 are followed through synaptogenesis. This analysis reveals a common (pan-neuronal) program unfolding in highly coordinated fashion in all neurons, including genes encoding proteins comprising the core synaptic machinery and membrane excitability. This program is overlaid by cell-type-specific programs with diverse cell recognition molecules expressed in different combinations and at different times. We propose that a pan-neuronal program endows neurons with the competence to form synapses and that cell-type-specific programs control synaptic specificity."
https://openalex.org/W3097770322,"Trained immunity, a functional state of myeloid cells, has been proposed as a compelling immune-oncological target. Its efficient induction requires direct engagement of myeloid progenitors in the bone marrow. For this purpose, we developed a bone marrow-avid nanobiologic platform designed specifically to induce trained immunity. We established the potent anti-tumor capabilities of our lead candidate MTP10-HDL in a B16F10 mouse melanoma model. These anti-tumor effects result from trained immunity-induced myelopoiesis caused by epigenetic rewiring of multipotent progenitors in the bone marrow, which overcomes the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, MTP10-HDL nanotherapy potentiates checkpoint inhibition in this melanoma model refractory to anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapy. Finally, we determined MTP10-HDL's favorable biodistribution and safety profile in non-human primates. In conclusion, we show that rationally designed nanobiologics can promote trained immunity and elicit a durable anti-tumor response either as a monotherapy or in combination with checkpoint inhibitor drugs."
https://openalex.org/W3097741487,"Introduction The immunosuppressive nature of some cancers and many cancer-directed treatments may increase the risk of infection with and severe sequelae from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The objective of this study was to compare concerns about COVID-19 among individuals undergoing cancer treatment to those with a history of cancer not currently receiving therapy and to those without a cancer history. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional anonymous online survey study of adults currently residing in the United States. Participants were recruited over a one-week period (April 3–11, 2020) using promoted advertisements on Facebook and Twitter. Groups were compared using chi-squared tests, Fisher’s exact tests, and t-tests. Results 543 respondents from 47 states provided information on their cancer history and were included in analyses. Participants receiving active treatment reported greater concern about infection from the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (p<0.001), higher levels of family distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic (p = 0.004), and greater concern that the general public does not adequately understand the seriousness of COVID-19 (p = 0.04). Those with metastatic disease were more likely to indicate that COVID-19 had negatively affected their cancer care compared to patients with non-metastatic cancer (50.8% vs. 31.0%; p = 0.02). The most commonly reported treatment modifications included chemotherapy delays. Conclusions Patients undergoing active treatment for cancer were most concerned about the short-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the logistics as well as potential efficacy of ongoing cancer treatment, longer term effects, and overarching societal concerns that the population at large is not as concerned about the public health implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection."

Further, we identify cell-cell interactions during the organization of the primitive sinusoid. This study provides a comprehensive atlas of liver lineage establishment from the endoderm and mesoderm through to the organization of the primitive sinusoid at single-cell resolution. The liver is a complex, multifunctional organ composed of cells from multiple lineages, derived from endoderm and mesoderm (Gordillo et al., 2015Gordillo M. Evans T. Gouon-Evans V. Orchestrating liver development.Development. 2015; 142: 2094-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). How these cell types organize to form the highly elegant structure, necessary for its functions, is poorly understood. Progress has been hindered by a lack of knowledge with respect to parenchymal and non-parenchymal cell type diversity, how these cells are derived from their endodermal and mesodermal progenitors, and how these lineages interact during the formation of the liver bud. Hepatoblasts, the bipotent progenitor for hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, develop from the definitive endoderm by embryonic day (E)8.75 (Gordillo et al., 2015Gordillo M. Evans T. Gouon-Evans V. Orchestrating liver development.Development. 2015; 142: 2094-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar; Tremblay and Zaret, 2005Tremblay K.D. Zaret K.S. Distinct populations of endoderm cells converge to generate the embryonic liver bud and ventral foregut tissues.Dev. Biol. 2005; 280: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Signals from the overlying cardiac mesoderm and septum transversum mesenchyme (STM) induce their transition into a pseudostratified columnar epithelium and their invasion of the STM by E9.5 (Figure 1B) (Houssaint, 1980Houssaint E.

These parenchymal progenitors begin expression of genes associated with hepatic metabolism and subsequently differentiate to form hepatocytes, the main parenchymal cell type, and cholangiocytes, the liver biliary epithelium. Liver non-parenchymal cells, including the endothelium, mesenchyme, blood, and nerves, play supportive roles to the liver parenchymal cells. The liver vasculature encompasses vascular and lymphatic capillaries, in addition to discontinuous, fenestrated sinusoidal capillaries, lined by hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (HSECs). HSECs present in the early liver are derived from the hemangioblast, from which vascular endothelial cells and early hematopoietic cells are also derived (Bollerot et al., 2005Bollerot K. Pouget C.

This specialized endothelium plays important roles in regulating blood flow in the sinusoid, scavenging blood-born waste, cytokine secretion, and antigen presentation to liver resident immune cells (Poisson et al., 2017Poisson J. Lemoinne S. Boulanger C. Durand F. Moreau R. Valla D. Rautou P.E. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells: Physiology and role in liver diseases.J. Hepatol. 2017; 66: 212-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The STM gives rise to the liver mesenchyme, which in the adult liver encompasses the mesothelium, the external cellular lining of the liver, and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), the sinusoidal pericytes (Asahina et al., 2009Asahina K. Tsai S.Y. Li P. Ishii M. Maxson Jr., R.E. Sucov H.M. Tsukamoto H. Mesenchymal origin of hepatic stellate cells, submesothelial cells, and perivascular mesenchymal cells during mouse liver development.Hepatology. 2009; 49: 998-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). During liver bud formation, the STM and emergent liver mesenchyme provide signaling cues and substrate for hepatoblast specification, differentiation, and migration. The fetal liver is also the main site of hematopoiesis during development, harboring hematopoietic stem cells from E10.5 until E16.5, when they migrate to the bone marrow (Gordillo et al., 2015Gordillo M. Evans T. Gouon-Evans V. Orchestrating liver development.Development. 2015; 142: 2094-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Inducible lineage tracing of early hemogenic sites with Cdh5-cre, however, does not account for all hematopoietic cells within the embryo (Hirschi, 2012Hirschi K.K. Hemogenic endothelium during development and beyond.Blood. 2012; 119: 4823-4827Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar; Zovein et al., 2008Zovein A.C. Hofmann J.J. Lynch M. French W.J. Turlo K.A.

This suggests the possibility that hematopoietic stem cells may be derived de novo from hemogenic sites at later stages of embryogenesis, with some postulating the existence of hemogenic endothelium in the fetal liver (Hirschi, 2012Hirschi K.K. Hemogenic endothelium during development and beyond.Blood. 2012; 119: 4823-4827Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). By E10.5, hepatoblasts, endothelia, and HSCs begin to organize into primitive sinusoidal capillaries (Gordillo et al., 2015Gordillo M. Evans T. Gouon-Evans V. Orchestrating liver development.Development. 2015; 142: 2094-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The cellular interactions that contribute to the establishment of the sinusoid, including HSC migration, HSEC fenestration, basement membrane formation, and hepatoblast differentiation, are poorly understood. Sinusoidal dysfunction, including defenestration and HSC activation, precedes scar formation and liver fibrosis (Poisson et al., 2017Poisson J. Lemoinne S. Boulanger C. Durand F. Moreau R. Valla D.

In the present study, we have employed single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to elucidate the lineage specification events that occur during the formation of the early liver from the definitive endoderm. We have combined 15 libraries comprising 45,334 single-cell transcriptomes enriched for E7.5 endoderm, E8.75 endoderm gut tube, E9.5 hepatic bud, and E10.5 liver (Nowotschin et al., 2019Nowotschin S.

Boutet S.C. et al.The emergent landscape of the mouse gut endoderm at single-cell resolution.Nature. 2019; 569: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition to the endodermal lineages, we compiled cells derived from the adjacent mesenchyme and endothelium and tracked their development from mesoderm to the non-parenchymal lineages of the liver. These transcriptomes represent the initial stages of liver organogenesis, including the specification of hepatoblasts from the definitive endoderm, invasion of STM by hepatoblasts, and liver sinusoid organization. We have elucidated the cell fate decisions that occur during liver cell lineage specification by combining Harmony and Palantir. Harmony constructs nearest-neighbor networks for batch correction across developmental time points (Nowotschin et al., 2019Nowotschin S. Setty M. Kuo Y.-Y. Liu V. Garg V. Sharma R. Simon C.S. Saiz N. Gardner R. Boutet S.C. et al.The emergent landscape of the mouse gut endoderm at single-cell resolution.Nature. 2019; 569: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), whereas Palantir defines pseudotime and branch probabilities by differentiation potential as each cell type reaches its terminal state from a user-defined “start-cell” (Setty et al., 2019Setty M. Kiseliovas V. Levine J. Gayoso A. Mazutis L. Pe’er D. Characterization of cell fate probabilities in single-cell data with Palantir.Nat. Biotechnol. 2019; 37: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These methods allow for computational predictions of cell plasticity and bifurcation points as liver cell lineages are specified from their progenitors. Using these methods, we have revealed uncharacterized diversity within endothelial, mesenchymal, and hepatic cell lineages during liver development and have further generated a complete pseudotemporal map of the emergent endothelial and hepatic lineages. Together, this study provides a comprehensive single-cell atlas of liver cell lineage establishment from the endoderm and mesoderm. To generate an overview of liver cell lineage specification at the single-cell level, we analyzed single-cell transcriptomic data from endodermal and liver tissue from E7.5–E10.5 (Figures 1A and S1A) (Nowotschin et al., 2019Nowotschin S. Setty M. Kuo Y.-Y. Liu V. Garg V. Sharma R. Simon C.S. Saiz N. Gardner R.

To enrich for parenchymal and non-parenchymal liver progenitors, endoderm and associated mesoderm at E7.5 and E8.75 and liver buds at E9.5 and E10.5 were dissected before single-cell dissociation. In addition, the extra-embryonic endoderm- and hepatoblast-specific Afp-GFP mouse line was used to deplete for AFP-GFP+ visceral endoderm at E7.5 and delineate AFP-GFP+ liver parenchymal derivatives from AFP-GFP- non-parenchymal cells at E10.5 (Figure S1A) (Kwon et al., 2006Kwon G.S.

In total, 45,334 single-cell transcriptomes from 15 scRNA-seq libraries passed quality control, with a median of 4,190 genes with expression detected per cell (Figures 1C and S1B; Table S1). We aggregated all single-cell transcriptomes and performed clustering and differential expression analyses to characterize the complete heterogeneity within our datasets (Table S2). We identified 15 clusters, which we have annotated as emergent endodermal, mesenchymal, and endothelial lineages, as well as hematopoietic cells (Figures 1C–1E).

While surface ectoderm is not captured in our libraries, due to expression of genes associated with epithelial identity like Epcam and Cdh1, we found overlap between it and our gut tube endoderm cluster (Figure S1C and data not shown). Within our data, we further note two distinct primitive streak clusters composed of cells from E7.5, which appear primed to either an endodermal or mesodermal cell fate, likely corresponding to the proximal and distal primitive streak (Figures 1C–1E and S1D). To more clearly visualize the emergence of liver cell types during development, endodermal, mesenchymal, and endothelial lineages were computationally segregated and analyzed separately. These lineages were individually visualized using force-directed layouts and further analyzed using Harmony and Palantir to reconstruct lineage relationships over developmental time (Nowotschin et al., 2019Nowotschin S.

To explore the cell fate decisions required for the emergence of the sinusoidal endothelium, we analyzed 2,066 endothelial and hemangioblast transcriptomes from E7.5 to E10.5. We further included 503 hematopoietic progenitors from E7.5 to better define the divergence between endothelial and hematopoietic lineages. We identified four distinct populations based on clustering and differential gene expression analyses, representing hemangioblasts, hematopoietic progenitors, endothelium, and HSECs (Figures 2A and S2A; Table S2). The hemangioblast cluster is composed of cells predominantly from E7.5, the endothelial cluster is composed of cells from E8.75 to E10.5, and HSECs are composed predominantly of cells from E10.5, though cells from E8.75 and E9.5 are also present (Figures 2A, 2B, and S2C). While both endothelial and HSEC lineages express endothelial biomarkers, including Kdr, Pecam1, Cd34, and Cdh5 (Goncharov et al., 2017Goncharov N.V. Nadeev A.D. Jenkins R.O. Avdonin P.V.

In contrast, early HSECs express transcription factors associated with sinusoidal identity, such as Sox17, Tfec, Maf, and Dab2 (Figures 2C and S2A) (Géraud et al., 2010Géraud C. Schledzewski K.

Surprisingly, the early HSEC transcriptome further suggests the activation of sinusoidal function, including endocytosis (Stab2, Colec12, Ehd3, and Lyve1), antigen presentation (Fcgrt, Fcer1g, and Mrc1), and signaling (Gpr182, Bmp2, Dll4, and Efna1) (Figures 2C, S2A, and S2F) (Géraud et al., 2010Géraud C.

DE, definitive endoderm; HSEC, hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells; hemang., hemangioblasts; hemato., hematopoietic cells; STM, septum transversum mesenchyme; YS, yolk sac. To detail the divergence between hematopoietic and endothelial cell lineages from the hemangioblast, we employed Palantir (Setty et al., 2019Setty M. Kiseliovas V. Levine J. Gayoso A. Mazutis L. Pe’er D. Characterization of cell fate probabilities in single-cell data with Palantir.Nat. Biotechnol. 2019; 37: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We selected an E7.5 “start cell” expressing high levels of the hemangioblast master regulator Etv2, which is necessary and sufficient for hemangioblast development into endothelial and hematopoietic lineages (solid arrowhead, Figure 2B) (Rasmussen et al., 2011Rasmussen T.L. Kweon J. Diekmann M.A. Belema-Bedada F. Song Q. Bowlin K. Shi X. Ferdous A. Li T. Kyba M. et al.ER71 directs mesodermal fate decisions during embryogenesis.Development. 2011; 138: 4801-4812Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Further, we selected three terminal states, residing within hematopoietic, endothelial, or HSEC clusters (hollow arrowheads, Figure 2B), and calculated differentiation potential and gene expression trends along pseudotime for each trajectory as these terminal states are reached. The differentiation potential is highest within the hemangioblast cluster; however, a local maximum exists at the interface between the endothelial and HSEC clusters, suggesting the presence of a second cell fate decision in HSEC specification (arrow, Figure 2B). Emergence of hematopoietic progenitors from the hemangioblast coincides with the activation of transcription factors required for hematopoiesis, such as Runx1 and Gata1 (Figure S2E) (Fujiwara et al., 1996Fujiwara Y. Browne C.P. Cunniff K. Goff S.C. Orkin S.H. Arrested development of embryonic red cell precursors in mouse embryos lacking transcription factor GATA-1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Runx1 is involved in primitive erythropoiesis in the mouse.Blood. 2008; 111: 4075-4080Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Both the endothelial and HSEC lineages emerge initially through an unspecified endothelial progenitor, activating and maintaining expression of genes such as Cdh5, Pecam1, and Cd34, while downregulating factors associated with hemangioblast identity (Figure 2D). Cells fated for the endothelial terminal state diverge at E10.5 activating regulators of angiogenesis, such as Tbx1 and Foxc2, as well as genes associated with blood flow-associated shear stress, including Klf2 and Klf4 (Figures 2C, 2D, and S2A) (Sangwung et al., 2017Sangwung P. Zhou G. Nayak L. Chan E.R. Kumar S. Kang D.-W. Zhang R. Liao X. Lu Y. Sugi K. et al.KLF2 and KLF4 control endothelial identity and vascular integrity.JCI Insight. 2017; 2: e91700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These factors are not enriched within the HSEC trajectory where instead, beginning as early as E8.75, HSEC-specific transcription factors are activated, including Tfec, Nr5a2, Sox17, and Oit3, as well as genes associated with HSEC identity, including Stab2, Lyve1, and Fcgrt (Figures 2C and 2D) (Géraud et al., 2010Géraud C.

https://openalex.org/W3095620510,"Animals display wide-ranging evolutionary adaptations based on their ecological niche. Octopuses explore the seafloor with their flexible arms using a specialized ""taste by touch"" system to locally sense and respond to prey-derived chemicals and movement. How the peripherally distributed octopus nervous system mediates relatively autonomous arm behavior is unknown. Here, we report that octopus arms use a family of cephalopod-specific chemotactile receptors (CRs) to detect poorly soluble natural products, thereby defining a form of contact-dependent, aquatic chemosensation. CRs form discrete ion channel complexes that mediate the detection of diverse stimuli and transduction of specific ionic signals. Furthermore, distinct chemo- and mechanosensory cells exhibit specific receptor expression and electrical activities to support peripheral information coding and complex chemotactile behaviors. These findings demonstrate that the peripherally distributed octopus nervous system is a key site for signal processing and highlight how molecular and anatomical features synergistically evolve to suit an animal's environmental context."

This study tested the efficacy of IMARA, a mother-daughter psychosocial STI/HIV prevention program, on adolescent Black/African-American girls’ incident STIs at 12 months in a 2-arm group randomized controlled trial. Black/African-American girls 14–18 years old and their primary female caregiver were eligible for the study. Girls provided urine samples to test for N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, and T. vaginalis infection at baseline and 12-months. Mother-daughter dyads were randomly assigned to IMARA (n = 118) or a time-matched health promotion control program (n = 81). Retention at 12-months was 86% with no difference across arms. Both interventions were delivered over two consecutive Saturdays totaling 12 hours. Girls who received IMARA were 43% less likely to contract a new STI in the 12-month post-intervention period compared with those in the health promotion control program (p = .011). A secondary follow-up intent-to-treat analysis provided additional support for the protective effect of IMARA, albeit with a similar magnitude of 37% (p = .014). Findings provide early evidence for IMARA’s efficacy, such that IMARA protected against STIs at 12-months among adolescent Black/African-American girls. Future research should examine the mechanisms associated with reduced STIs."
https://openalex.org/W3096855227,"Abstract Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 )-amplified breast cancers are treated using targeted antibodies and kinase inhibitors, but resistance to these therapies leads to systemic tumor recurrence of metastatic disease. Herein, we conducted gene expression analyses of HER2 kinase inhibitor-resistant cell lines as compared to their drug-sensitive counterparts. These data demonstrate the induction of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), which included enhanced expression of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) and axonal guidance molecules known as neuropilins (NRPs). Immunoprecipitation of FGFR1 coupled with mass spectroscopy indicated that FGFR1 forms a physical complex with NRPs, which is enhanced upon induction of EMT. Confocal imaging revealed that FGFR1 and NRP1 predominantly interact throughout the cytoplasm. Along these lines, short hairpin RNA-mediated depletion of NRP1, but not the use of NRP1-blocking antibodies, inhibited FGFR signaling and reduced tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Our results further indicate that NRP1 upregulation during EMT is mediated via binding of the chromatin reader protein, bromodomain containing 4 (BRD4) in the NRP1 proximal promoter region. Pharmacological inhibition of BRD4 decreased NRP1 expression and ablated FGF-mediated tumor cell growth. Overall, our studies indicate that NRPs facilitate aberrant growth factor signaling during EMT-associated drug resistance and metastasis. Pharmacological combination of epigenetic modulators with FGFR-targeted kinase inhibitors may provide improved outcomes for breast cancer patients with drug-resistant metastatic disease."
https://openalex.org/W3097517068,"Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) acts as a mediator of aberrant retinal angiogenesis and has been implicated in the progression of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Patients with PDR, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), and wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) have been found to have elevated levels of Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α) in the eye. In fibrovascular membranes (FVMs) taken from patients with PDR RUNX1 expression was increased in the vasculature, while in human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs), TNF-α stimulation causes increased RUNX1 expression, which can be modulated by RUNX1 inhibitors. Using TNF-α pathway inhibitors, we determined that in HRMECs, TNF-α-induced RUNX1 expression occurs via JNK activation, while NF-κB and p38/MAPK inhibition did not affect RUNX1 expression. JNK inhibitors were also effective at stopping high D-glucose-stimulated RUNX1 expression. We further linked JNK to RUNX1 through Activator Protein 1 (AP-1) and investigated the JNK-AP-1-RUNX1 regulatory feedback loop, which can be modulated by VEGF. Additionally, stimulation with TNF-α and D-glucose had an additive effect on RUNX1 expression, which was downregulated by VEGF modulation. These data suggest that the downregulation of RUNX1 in conjunction with anti-VEGF agents may be important in future treatments for the management of diseases of pathologic ocular angiogenesis."

In particular, it is not known whether GA can modulate the pro-inflammatory Th17-type immune response in MS. We investigated the effects of original GA (Copaxone®, Teva, Israel) and generic GA (Timexone®, Biocad, Russia) on Th17- and Th1-type cytokine production in vitro in 25 patients with relapsing-remitting MS and 25 healthy subjects. Both original and generic GA at concentrations 50-200 μg/ml dose-dependently inhibited interleukin-17 and interferon-γ production by anti-CD3/anti-CD28-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from MS patients and healthy subjects. This effect of GA was reproduced using purified CD4+ T cells, suggesting that GA can directly modulate the functions of Th17 and Th1 cells. At high concentrations (100-200 μg/ml), GA also suppressed the production of Th17-differentiation cytokines (interleukin-1β and interleukin-6) by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated dendritic cells (DCs). These GA/LPS-treated DCs induced lower interleukin-17 and interferon-γ production by autologous CD4+ T cells compared to LPS-treated DCs. These data suggest that GA can inhibit Th17-immune response and that this inhibitory effect is preferentially exercised by direct influence of GA on T cells. We also demonstrate a comparable ability of original and generic GA to modulate pro-inflammatory cytokine production."
https://openalex.org/W3095169465,"The impairment of autophagy can cause cellular metabolic perturbations involved in endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT). However, the interplay between the cellular autophagy machinery and endothelial metabolism remains elusive. Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), an NAD-dependent deacetylase, is a major cellular sensor of energy metabolism. The aim of this work was to determine the role of SIRT3-mediated autophagy in cellular metabolism and the process of EndoMT. We demonstrated that Angiotensin II (Ang II) led to defective autophagic flux and high levels of glycolysis in endothelial cells (ECs) accompanied by a loss of mitochondrial SIRT3 during EndoMT. The loss of SIRT3 further induced the hyperacetylation of endogenous autophagy-regulated gene 5 (ATG5), which in turn inhibited autophagosome maturation and increased pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) dimer expression. The M2 dimer is the less active form of PKM2, which drives glucose through aerobic glycolysis. Additionally, TEPP-46, a selective PKM2 tetramer activator, produced lower concentrations of lactate and led to the reduction of EndoMT both in vitro and in vivo. In parallel, the blockade of lactate influx from ECs into vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) downregulated synthetic VSMC markers. EC-specific SIRT3 transgenic mice exhibited reduced endothelial cell transition but partial rescue of vascular fibrosis and collagen accumulation. Taken together, these findings reveal that SIRT3 regulates EndoMT by improving the autophagic degradation of PKM2. Pharmacological targeting of glycolysis metabolism may, therefore, represent an effective therapeutic strategy for hypertensive vascular remodeling."

An implant-supported palatal obturator prosthesis was simulated in three different materials: polyetheretherketone (PEEK), titanium (Ti:90%, Al:6%, V:4%) and Co-Cr (Co:60.6%, Cr:31.5%, Mo:6%) alloys. The model was imported into the analysis software and divided into a mesh composed of nodes and tetrahedral elements. Each material was assumed isotropic, elastic and homogeneous and all contacts were considered ideal. The bone was fixed and the load was applied in two different regions for each material: at the palatal face (cingulum area) of the central incisors (100 N magnitude at 45°); and at the occlusal surface of the first left molar (150 N magnitude normal to the surface). The microstrain and von-Mises stress were selected as criteria for analysis. The posterior load showed a higher strain concentration in the posterior peri-implant tissue, near the load application side for cortical and cancellous bone, regardless the simulated material. The anterior load showed a lower strain concentration with reduced magnitude and more implants involving in the load dissipation. The stress peak was calculated during posterior loading, which 77.7 MPa in the prosthetic screws and 2,686 με microstrain in the cortical bone. For bone tissue and bar, the material stiffness was inversely proportional to the calculated microstrain and stress. However, for the prosthetic screws and implants the PEEK showed higher stress concentration than the other materials. PEEK showed a promising behavior for the bone tissue and for the integrity of the bar and bar-clip attachments. However, the stress concentration in the prosthetic screws may represent an increase in failure risk. The use of Co-Cr alloy can reduce the stress in the prosthetic screw; however, it increases the bone strain; while the Titanium showed an intermediate behavior."

It is currently unknown when, and if, individual premutation carriers will develop FXTAS. Thus, with the aim of identifying biomarkers for early diagnosis, development, and progression of FXTAS, we performed global metabolomic profiling of premutation carriers (PM) who, as part of an ongoing longitudinal study, emerged into two distinct categories: those who developed symptoms of FXTAS (converters, CON) at subsequent visits and those who did not (non-converters, NCON) and we compared to age-matched healthy controls (HC). We assessed CGG repeat allele size by Southern Blot and PCR analysis. Metabolomic profile was obtained by ultra-performance liquid chromatography, accurate mass spectrometer, and an Orbitrap mass analyzer. In this study we found 47 metabolites were significantly dysregulated between HC and the premutation groups (PM). Importantly, we identified 24 metabolites that showed significant changes in expression in the CON as compared to the NCON both at V1 and V2, and 70 metabolites in CON as compared to NCON but only at V2. These findings suggest the potential role of the identified metabolites as biomarkers for early diagnosis and for FXTAS disease progression, respectively. Interestingly, the majority of the identified metabolites were lipids, followed by amino acids. To our knowledge, this the first report of longitudinal metabolic profiling and identification of unique biomarkers of FXTAS.

Here we show an improved human CM differentiation protocol with which high-purity ventricular-type CMs can be obtained and maintained without any CM purification process. We induced and collected a mesodermal cell population (platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFRα)-positive cells) that can respond to CM differentiation cues, and then stimulated CM differentiation by means of Wnt inhibition. This method reproducibly generated CMs with purities above 95% in several human pluripotent stem cell lines. Furthermore, these CM populations were maintained in culture at such high purity without any further CM purification step for over 200 days. The majority of these CMs (>95%) exhibited a ventricular-like phenotype with a tendency to structural and electrophysiological maturation, including T-tubule-like structure formation and the ability to respond to QT prolongation drugs. This is a simple and valuable method to stably generate CM populations suitable for cardiac toxicology testing, disease modeling and regenerative medicine."

We report that Ada−/− mice, phenocopying ADA-deficient humans, displayed SNHL. Ada−/− mice cochlea with elevated adenosine caused substantial nerve fiber demyelination and mild hair cell loss. ADA enzyme therapy in these mice normalized cochlear adenosine levels, attenuated SNHL, and prevented demyelination. Additionally, ADA enzyme therapy rescued SNHL by restoring nerve fiber structure in Ada−/− mice post two-week drug withdrawal. Moreover, elevated cochlear adenosine in untreated mice was associated with enhanced Adora2b gene expression. Preclinically, ADORA2B-specific antagonist treatment in Ada−/− mice significantly improved HL, nerve fiber density, and myelin compaction. We also provided genetic evidence that ADORA2B is detrimental for age-related SNHL by impairing cochlear myelination in WT aged mice. Overall, understanding purinergic molecular signaling in SNHL in Ada−/− mice allows us to further discover that ADORA2B is also a pathogenic factor underlying aged-related SNHL by impairing cochlear myelination and lowering cochlear adenosine levels or blocking ADORA2B signaling are effective therapies for SNHL."
https://openalex.org/W3095092057,"Glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) is critical for neurotransmission as a Ca2+ channel. Nonetheless, flux-independent signaling has also been demonstrated. Astrocytes express NMDAR distinct from its neuronal counterpart, but cultured astrocytes have no electrophysiological response to NMDA. We recently demonstrated that in cultured astrocytes, NMDA at pH6 (NMDA/pH6) acting through the NMDAR elicits flux-independent Ca2+ release from the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) and depletes mitochondrial membrane potential (mΔΨ). Here we show that Ca2+ release is due to pH6 sensing by NMDAR, whereas mΔΨ depletion requires both: pH6 and flux-dependent NMDAR signaling. Plasma membrane (PM) NMDAR guard a non-random distribution relative to the ER and mitochondria. Also, NMDA/pH6 induces ER stress, endocytosis, PM electrical capacitance reduction, mitochondria-ER, and -nuclear contacts. Strikingly, it also produces the formation of PM invaginations near mitochondria along with structures referred to here as PM-mitochondrial bridges (PM-m-br). These and earlier data strongly suggest PM-mitochondria communication. As proof of the concept of mass transfer, we found that NMDA/pH6 provoked mitochondria labeling by the PM dye FM-4-64FX. NMDA/pH6 caused PM depolarization, cell acidification, and Ca2+ release from most mitochondria. Finally, the MCU and microtubules were not involved in mΔΨ depletion, while actin cytoskeleton was partially involved. These findings demonstrate that NMDAR has concomitant flux-independent and flux-dependent actions in cultured astrocytes."

A 2 × 2 × 2 factorial design was used. Pigs had either a high fibre (weaner 5.3% and finisher 11.6% of crude fibre) or standard fibre diet (weaner 3.7% and finisher 5.9% of crude fibre). In the weaner stage, pigs had either a spruce wooden post (supplied in a wall-mounted dispenser) or a rubber floor toy as a enrichment device, and in the finisher stage, they had either the same or alternate enrichment item. Six hundred and seventy-two pigs were assigned to 48 pens of 14 pigs and followed from weaning until slaughter. Individual tail lesion scores and pen level behaviours were directly recorded every 2 weeks. Twenty-six pens had tail biting outbreaks and 161 injured pigs needed removal for treatment. Pigs fed with the high fibre diet performed more tail biting (p < 0.05) and tended to have a worse tail damage scores than those fed the standard fibre diet (p = 0.08). Pigs which had the floor toy as weaners and wood as finishers tended to have fewer tail lesions in the finisher stage than their counterparts (p = 0.06). Pigs receiving the floor toy as enrichment interacted with the enrichment more frequently overall (p < 0.001) and performed fewer harmful behaviours in the weaner stage (p < 0.05). Overall, higher fibre in the diet in a relatively barren environment did not help reduce tail biting or tail lesions. Altering the fibre level in the pigs’ diet and providing a single enrichment device to undocked pigs on fully slatted floors resulted in a high level of tail biting and a large proportion of pigs with partial tail amputation."
https://openalex.org/W3096897460,"Pine wilt disease (PWD) is an infectious disease of pines that typically kills affected trees. The causal pathogen of PWD is the pine wood nematode (PWN), Bursaphelenchus xylophilus. Understanding of the disease has advanced in recent years through the use of a highly sensitive proteomics procedure and whole genome sequence analysis; in combination, these approaches have enabled identification of proteins secreted by PWNs. However, the roles of these proteins during the onset of parasitism have not yet been elucidated. In this study, we used a leaf-disk assay based on transient overexpression in Nicotiana benthamiana to allow functional screening of 10 candidate pathogenic proteins secreted by PWNs. These proteins were selected based on previous secretome and RNA-seq analyses. We found that five molecules induced significant cell death in tobacco plants relative to a GFP-only control. Three of these proteins (Bx-TH1, Bx-TH2, and Bx-CPI) may have a role in molecular mimicry and likely make important contributions to inducing hypersensitive responses in host plants."

Total cost of hospitalization, length of hospitalization and the number of hospitalization were analyzed. Descriptive statistical analysis and multiple linear regression analysis were adopted.Understanding the current financial burden of diabetic patients and the use of medical services, the results show that the direct economic burden of diabetic patients per hospitalization was approximately 8,000 Yuan, and the indirect economic burden was approximately 2,000 Yuan. Age, medical payment methods, admission channels, and medical institution grades are all important factors affecting medical expenses and medical service utilization of diabetic patients. In addition, the inequality of medical service utilization of patients is increased due to different types of medical insurance.To reduce the economic burden on patients and society, governments should strengthen supervision, the advancement of diagnosis and treatment systems, the service conditions of primary medical institutions, the management of medical services, and the use of medical resources. To create a more impartial medical and health environment where the value of medical staff are truly reflected, financial investments should be attained to improve medical technologies and labor costs."

While all MBLs share a common αβ/βα-fold, there are many other proteins with the same folding pattern that exhibit different enzymatic activities. These enzymes, together with MBLs, form the MBL superfamily. Thermotoga maritima tRNase Z, a tRNA 3′ processing endoribonuclease of MBL-superfamily, and IMP-1, a clinically isolated MBL, showed a striking similarity in tertiary structure, despite low sequence homology. IMP-1 hydrolyzed both total cellular RNA and synthetic small unstructured RNAs. IMP-1 also hydrolyzed pre-tRNA, but its cleavage site was different from those of T. maritima tRNase Z and human tRNase Z long form, indicating a key difference in substrate recognition. Single-turnover kinetic assays suggested that substrate-binding affinity of T. maritima tRNase Z is much higher than that of IMP-1."
https://openalex.org/W3094730633,"When I went on the job market, I tried to refine the list of positions to which I applied by assessing the racial and ethnic make-up of the faculty. This was a wishful exercise because most faculty were white and only a handful had even one Black faculty member. In retrospect, it should have been unsurprising, given that I was used to being the only, or one of a few, starting with my math and science interest in elementary school and persisting throughout my academic and professional career. However, I hope that my presence as a faculty member as well as the recruitment and retention activities I participate in change this experience for prospective Black faculty. It is not a new notion that when you see faces like yours represented in a particular field, you can visualize yourself in those positions, but it is one that I subscribe to. I am a mentor and staff on two NIH-sponsored programs, Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) at University of South Carolina and South Carolina Advancing Diversity in Aging Research, aimed at recruiting and retaining Black and Brown students into STEM. I interact with the community whenever possible by sharing my research at events large and small targeted at students of color from kindergarten through college. Despite feeling constantly strapped for time, I will always find a way to mentor students of color. Ultimately, I hope that my enthusiasm about research rubs off on students at all levels so those with skin like mine know that academic science can be a place for them. How many of you have been subjected to a police search of your vehicle as you make your way home around 3 AM after an already stressful night of unsuccessful experiments? Have you ever been subjected to a 30 min conversation concerning race theory by a STEM professor who, after hearing you whistling in the hallway, suggested you must be softening your “intimidating presence” by choosing a classical tune to show how cultured, safe, and refined you were? For me, these anecdotes are my normal. I am a large Black man with dreads, a nose ring, and numerous visible tattoos. I am not a stock photo scientist. At my own institution, I have been presumed to be the janitor; at conferences, on multiple occasions security guards have asked if I was lost while I worked on conference talks in the very ballrooms in which I was scheduled to speak. These things weigh on me, and others like me, as we constantly work to stay cool, calm, and collected while attempting to succeed in spaces that were not only made to keep us out, but were often the very institutions perpetuating the “science” that made us out to be “other.” To be Black in the academy is to fight for your space on a near-daily occurrence. All I ask is that one day things like dreads, nose rings, and numerous visible tattoos will be seen second to an individual’s passion for their work. Until that day, I’ll be out here grindin’. Pre-COVID-19, faculty meetings about diversity ended with, “There aren’t any Black women marine scientists; we can’t hire what isn’t there.” And I would think to myself, surely, I am not the only one. Colorism has afforded me great privilege. I have not experienced the overt racism my darker-skinned colleagues and friends have. Despite this, my academic experience has had undertones of otherness. It’s a mix of wanting acceptance, but also not relating. When you are told so many times that you don’t belong, you internalize it and question your passion. This has motivated me to be hyper-productive to prove my belonging. In the summer of 2020, when white people woke up to the violent racism assaulting Black people for the last 401 years, I was confronted with more meetings. The same sentiment prevailed; I was the only Black tenure-track assistant professor ever hired at my school because... we don’t exist. So, I did what any good scientist does, I asked Twitter. Do Black women in marine science exist? Turns out...YES, we do exist! Based on the overwhelming response, I started a group called Black Women in Ecology, Evolution and Marine Science (BWEEMS). We connect through common experiences, share science, and offer needed support. Black people are navigating an academic system built to exclude, and racism runs rampant. My hope is that as BWEEMS becomes more visible academia will finally accept that Black women in ecology, evolution, and marine science DO EXIST. How do you keep dreaming about doing science when everything around you has been destroyed? After the civil war, I left Republic of the Congo to go to university in France. I was eighteen. I went from having a privileged social situation as a son of two physicians to being a poor immigrant facing hunger, joblessness, racism, the fear of expulsion. How many like me dropped out of university just to survive? I was lucky. Besides my family’s support, I was fortunate to encounter others’ humanity. There were people who did not see my difference; who invited me to share a meal for Christmas; who opened doors for a job, an apartment, an internship, a PhD, a post-doc, a position. However, sometimes my color is a burden. For instance, being the only Black person at a conference makes me feel like I don’t belong. We should create more platforms where Black scientists would be visible. Racism is a barrier to advancing knowledge. Can we imagine the giant leap forward that science would make if it were to be enriched with many more ideas from Africa? I have always been one of the few black women in every classroom, lab, or department in which I have found myself. I worked hard to prove I deserve a seat in each room. During the second year of my PhD, it was suggested to me by a fellow graduate student (a white man) that my successes were not of my own merit, but instead just part of an institutionalized effort to promote people of color. When I out-competed him for a slot on our program-T32, he made his absurd opinions clear that I did not deserve the grant if not for the color of my skin. Fast forward 10 years, as I receive invitations to interview for professorships across the country, I cannot help but wonder if my 15 manuscripts, 7 successful grant applications, or even my fundable K99/R00 score were not of my own merit but instead all just part of affirmative action. My mentors tell me this is called imposter syndrome, but I can trace my emotions back to the words of that one student, and every day I wonder if all my other white male colleagues feel the same and just lack the audacity to speak it."
https://openalex.org/W3095548726,"While the involvement of protease-activated receptors (PARs) in the physiological regulation of human placenta development, as in tumor biology, is recognized, the molecular pathway is unknown. We evaluated the impact of PAR1 and PAR2 function in cytotrophoblast (CTB) proliferation and invasion in a system of extravillous trophoblast (EVT) organ culture and in human cell-lines. Activation of PAR1- and PAR2-induced EVT invasion and proliferation, while the shRNA silencing of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6 (LRP5/6) inhibited these processes. PAR1 and PAR2 effectively induce β-catenin stabilization in a manner similar to that shown for the canonical β-catenin stabilization pathway yet independent of Wnts. Immunoprecipitation analyses and protein-protein docking demonstrated the co-association between either PAR1 or PAR2 with LRP5/6 forming an axis of PAR-LRP5/6-Axin. Noticeably, in PAR1-PAR2 heterodimers a dominant role is assigned to PAR2 over PAR1 as shown by inhibition of PAR1-induced β-catenin levels, and Dvl nuclear localization. This inhibition takes place either by shRNA silenced hPar2 or in the presence of a TrPAR2 devoid its cytoplasmic tail. Indeed, TrPAR2 cannot form the PAR1-PAR2 complex, obstructing thereby the flow of signals downstream. Elucidation of the mechanism of PAR-induced invasion contributes to therapeutic options highlighting key partners in the process."
https://openalex.org/W3096260942,"Background This study aimed to explain the strengths and weaknesses of the Traffic light label (TLL) and nutrition facts label (NFL) and the strategies for improving their use in Iran, based on the perspectives of different stakeholders, including mothers, food quality control experts (FQC), nutritionists and food industry experts. Methods We conducted 10 Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) with 63 mothers, 10 semi-structured interviews with FQCs, 1 FGD with 6 nutritionists and 1 FGD with 8 food industry experts. To clarify some of the questions that arose from the interviews, the researcher interviewed three policy makers who had sufficient information about the TLL. The discussions and interviews were transcribed verbatim and MAXQDA10 software was used for coding. Results The most important findings of this study based on different stakeholders' perspectives were as follows: mothers believed that nutrition labels reduced the consumption of high-calorie products, although they found the TLL to be easier to understand than the NFL because of its red color. However, their weaknesses were their incompatibility with culture and the lack of trust in the information provided by manufacturers. FQCs pointed out the possibility of changing formulations and the appropriateness of the traffic light for patients, but like mothers, they believed that the labels did not suit the governing culture. Further weaknesses were, misleading the consumer, problems in the colorings reported by different laboratories, and different approaches adopted by regulatory experts. The simplicity of understanding TLL for the general public has been suggested by some nutritionists. Nevertheless, the multiplicity of colors of the TLL was the most important weakness presented by nutritionists and food industry experts and the failure to implement nutrition labels was another issue raised by experts. To improve the use of nutrition labels, notification via media especially television, community education and culture building were suggested by all stakeholders. Conclusions The findings of this study underscore the importance of implementing the policy of nutrition labeling in Iran. Mothers and nutritionists believed TLL to be more appropriate for the public to understand, however, FQCs and food industry experts believed that NFL was more suitable in guiding consumers toward healthy food choices. Education and information dissemination via media on interpretive TLL may affect consumer behavior toward food purchases."

Unfortunately, universities are not universally implementing these conversations. We provide a blueprint for initiating and executing student-led discussions to empower young scientists to take action toward making science more welcoming and inclusive. Communal discussions on anti-racism and inclusion are crucial to addressing the history of racism in scientific communities. Unfortunately, universities are not universally implementing these conversations. We provide a blueprint for initiating and executing student-led discussions to empower young scientists to take action toward making science more welcoming and inclusive. The latest unjust killings of Black Americans like Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, and Rayshard Brooks by law enforcement caused international outrage. Calls to action and peaceful protests organized by Black Lives Matter movement leaders spread internationally in Spring 2020, including to the University of Virginia (UVA) in Charlottesville, Virginia. The wave of activism has renewed the focus on the extensive, deeply rooted systemic oppression that Black American communities face. This oppression is built on ideologies and biases perpetuated by our society for the last 400 years; from slavery to the Jim Crow era and into today’s overt (e.g., police brutality) and covert (e.g., microaggression) racist practices. White academics have largely failed to acknowledge the deep pain their Black colleagues experience from accumulated trauma of historic and current racism. Scientific organizations and research communities often remain silent on discussions about racism. For example, many biomedical research departments across the country did not issue any public statements on recent high-profile events indicative of the anti-Black racism in America. At UVA, many of these same departments had previously failed to address the 2017 Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville. This silence is unacceptable in light of academia’s history of disseminating anti-Black racism through the incorporation of eugenics in biomedical teachings (Saini, 2019Saini A. Superior: The Return of Race Science. Beacon Press, 2019Google Scholar; nmichelnmichel UVA History: From a Black Perspective.https://www.tiki-toki.com/timeline/entry/1446213/UVA-History-From-a-Black-Perspective/Google Scholar). Beyond perpetuating broad anti-Black racism, these eugenics teachings contributed to abhorrent studies such as the 40-year “Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male” (U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020U.S. Centers for Disease Control and PreventionU.S. Public Health Service Syphilis Study at Tuskegee.https://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/index.htmlDate: 2020Google Scholar). Furthermore, many anti-Black discriminatory and flawed research practices continue in biomedicine today. Notable examples include the systemic exploitation of Black Americans in Food and Drug Administration “Exception from Informed Consent” trials (Feldman et al., 2018Feldman W.B. Hey S.P. Kesselheim A.S. A Systematic Review Of The Food And Drug Administration’s ‘Exception From Informed Consent’ Pathway.Health Aff. (Millwood). 2018; 37: 1605-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and the poor representation of dark skin colors in medical training (Nolen, 2020Nolen L. How Medical Education Is Missing the Bull’s-eye.N. Engl. J. Med. 2020; 382: 2489-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Our failure to acknowledge academia’s history and the current state of anti-Black racism sheds light on a lack of inclusion and awareness in departments and programs. Since we cannot change our tragic history, it is imperative that the scientific community actively combat racially discriminatory practices. A critical step toward combating racism is ensuring Black scientists are stakeholders of our biomedical advancements. Toward this goal, institutions have sought to increase racial and ethnic minority representation in their graduate programs and faculty. In the UVA Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, diversification efforts succeeded in increasing the proportion of incoming students who identify as underrepresented minorities (URMs), as defined by the NIH (U.S. National Institutes of Health, 2019U.S. National Institutes of HealthNotice of NIH’s Interest in Diversity.https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-20-031.htmlDate: 2019Google Scholar), from an average of 13% between 2011 and 2014 to 33% in 2019 and 28% in 2020 (J. Cross, personal communication). Since 2011, the UVA Medical Scientist Training Program has cumulatively consisted of 20% of students from NIH-defined URM backgrounds (A. Woodard and D. Kedes, personal communication). Further, in the Biology Graduate Program, 25% of domestic students who received offers of enrollment in 2020 identify as URMs (M. Champion, personal communication). These trends are reflected, more generally, in the School of Medicine and the School of Arts and Sciences (Figure 1, data from Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, 2020Rector and Visitors of the University of VirginiaDiversity Dashboard University of Virginia.https://diversitydata.virginia.edu/Home/details/Graduate%20Students/?group=All&year=2019Date: 2020Google Scholar). These positive developments are likely the result of cumulative efforts spearheaded by recruitment and diversity offices to enhance outreach, strengthen recruitment, and provide summer research experiences to undergraduate members of URM groups interested in scientific research. Progress in racial and ethnic diversity at biomedical research institutions like UVA should be celebrated. However, diversifying an institution is different from making it inclusive. The pursuit of a PhD is a difficult undertaking. Combined with racial discrimination and exclusion, the academic journey becomes nearly impassable (Twitter’s #BlackintheIvory contains personal accounts). To be inclusive, departments must be spaces where Black people are supported and know their contributions are valued. Inclusive spaces ensure that Black scientists are not met with derogatory policies, statements, actions, or assumptions. Inclusion means we create departments where Black colleagues thrive, both personally and professionally, not just survive. Inclusion must improve for diversification efforts to prove sustainable and to ultimately increase representation among biomedical faculty. Creating safe and inclusive spaces begins with reconciliation. Academia has failed Black communities. We must acknowledge this failure—silence denies their experiences. We must actively identify, promote, and implement inclusive ways to provide minority colleagues with a sense of belonging in our departments. The face of racism is similar across institutions, but the needs of the Black colleagues are individual. We must listen to Black colleagues without minimizing their experiences. We need to reflect on personal biases that affect interactions with and perceptions of Black students and colleagues. To this end, we, as graduate students in the Cell Biology and Biology departments at UVA, organized sessions of reflection for all members of our departments to unite in communal anti-racism discussion. Encouraging openness and vulnerability in these sessions stimulated difficult but necessary discussions on how to combat harmful behaviors and injustices in science and academia. We ran a ten-session series over the summer and are continuing with another set of sessions this fall semester. These ongoing conversations are fostering compassion and unity among community members. These types of discussions are not new concepts, but what makes them unique is that they happen closer to the source of the problem. It is the colleagues who Black students, postdocs, staff, and faculty interact with on a daily basis that are likely to perpetuate exclusion. Therefore, inclusion efforts must stem from these groups. We hope these efforts initiate a continued conversation about improving our departments, programs, universities, and academia as a whole (Figure 2). Here, we outline how we structured these departmental anti-racism and inclusion discussions. We challenge institutions to begin these difficult conversations to support Black and other URM colleagues. This is one small, immediate, and tangible way institutions can work toward creating diverse and inclusive spaces. The idea of reconciliation through discussion is not novel; therapeutic spaces of sharing have previously been created by URM communities for unity and mutual support. However, such open spaces where all are welcome are not common in academia. The goal of these conversations is 2-fold: (1) provide a safe space to discuss experiences with racism, and (2) educate non-Black department members of the extent of racism in the academic community and beyond. Together, we hope to galvanize changes that will make departments and programs more inclusive of Black individuals and united in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. To ensure substantive cultural changes within the scientific community, these types of discussions of racism and inclusion must occur regularly (e.g., weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly). Eradicating racism and racial biases will take time and perseverance. Progress may appear slow; however, a communal and continual evaluation of biases will initiate the process of identifying problematic heuristics and reducing exclusionary behaviors. Ultimately, we hope to mold our departments into safe spaces for all. We encourage participation of all members of a department or graduate program community since inclusion can only be successful if everyone is invested. Larger groups are preferable to allow for a greater array of viewpoints. Regardless of the size of the group, participation should remain completely voluntary to ensure most participants will be supportive of creating a shared safe space. While white colleagues may be eager to participate and show their support, URM colleagues may be reluctant to share or participate even with frequent reminders that sessions are safe spaces. Some common reasons for silence include activism fatigue, fear of judgement or reprisal, concerns about being expected to explain or represent particular viewpoints, and needing to protect their mental wellbeing. Additionally, if the declaration of the session being a safe space does not match previous experiences within the department, Black and other URM colleagues may doubt the declaration. Providing anonymous web forms a few days in advance enables participants to share thoughts, questions, or concerns they may not be comfortable voicing aloud. Session organizers can review responses, identify shared ideas or points of discussion, and identify resources that address these issues in preparation for the discussion. If representation of Black or other URM colleagues is low in the discussions, organizers may consider inviting a diversity and inclusion expert from within the institution. Having an expert join the conversation can help alleviate the burden on Black and other URM colleagues when representation is sparse. Alternatively, discussion organizers can refer to resources that highlight the harsh reality of systemic racism in academia, such as #BlackintheIvory posts on social media or published statements and demands from URM student groups within the institution. These methods center discussions on the voices of those who have been most egregiously mistreated in science and academia, even if their representation is low. In our sessions, we students act as moderators. We encourage moderators of similar sessions to be prepared to provide resources and initiate discussion. Moderators must also keep in mind that this will be the first anti-racism effort some participants attend. Therefore, being an informed moderator is crucial to avoid misleading eager but uninformed participants. Moderators should be willing to share their own thoughts, questions, and/or experiences if nobody volunteers to speak. It is important to note that even with prepared materials and prompts there may be moments of uncomfortable silence, especially during more reflective sessions. These moments are important and should not be rushed; the topics that need to be discussed the most are also the most challenging and sensitive. Ground rules are crucial to session success. When encouraging white colleagues to enter into such discussions, it is critical to reiterate the importance of creating a safe and supportive space. That means explicitly stating that details and experiences shared within the session should remain confidential and must not be discussed outside of the meeting. Discussing another’s personal experiences without consent violates trust. It is important to remind all participants to be kind, respectful, understanding, open, aware, and emotionally present human beings. These reminders are key to ensuring a safe environment in which participants feel comfortable to share. Faculty and administrators should be reminded that they do not hold their leadership roles during the discussion. All participants should be present as supportive peers throughout the discussion. Controversial statements or sentiments may arise during the discussion. Moderators should direct the conversation to resolve differences without escalation. We believe that if moderators reinforce the ground rules, the content discussed in each session will serve to benefit the participants and the community overall. Furthermore, if any individual expresses hurtful sentiments during the discussion, it is important for moderators to identify an allied department member of similar stature to the individual who can provide advice or assist with mediation (e.g., student-to-student, staff-to-staff, or faculty-to-faculty). In processes of mediation, it is important to strike a critical balance of clearly identifying the harmful sentiments while ensuring the member feels comfortable continuing to participate in the discussion. The focus of these discussions may vary among groups and over time. Our discussions evolved with each session. The initial discussions were reflective and served as judgement- and repercussion-free spaces for emotional sharing. URM participants voluntarily shared their experiences and colleagues expressed support. Additionally, there was an option to share a story anonymously ahead of time to be read by the moderators (collected via anonymous fill-in-the-blank survey). Participants overwhelmingly supported the continuation of these discussions. Many recognized that a simple exercise in discussion is vulnerable to losing momentum, which happens frequently to efforts that emerge after publicized acts of violence against Black Americans. Following the initially reflective meetings, participants wanted to act and support change. To meet this need, we shifted to a heavily discussion-based “anti-racism journal club.” Currently, each week two or three participants volunteer to review a small number of resources (articles, reports, book excerpts, podcasts, or videos) distributed a few days before the session. The presenters provide a 5–20 min summary of the resources and then open the sessions for discussion. Topics range from general problems caused or perpetuated by racism to problems specific to academia. Presenters may choose their own resources; however, we also developed a small library in case presenters do not know where to begin. Discussions are typically based on both experience and evidence. Often, participants share other relevant resources to ensure the sessions remain solution focused. As a result, action- and awareness-focused groups have emerged. Participants in our discussions formed committees to design and publish comprehensive action plans on department websites, complete with timelines and metrics of success. Others established a reading group to bring further awareness to the intersection of racism and science. Some launched outreach efforts to help diversify STEM fields and promote a more welcoming environment in research and academia. By focusing on how to implement solutions, we can maintain momentum and hold ourselves accountable as we address challenges of both diversity and inclusion. While URM representation is increasing within biomedical research departments at institutions across the country, this representation still does not reflect the demographics of the country. More work remains to be done to achieve sustainable change. Initiating changes to improve diversity and inclusion in academia should not be the task of the oppressed alone. Frequently, initiatives to advance diversity and inclusion fall to Black and other URM scientists who step in to provide mentorship, support, and resources. While the task of increasing diversity of our institution is important, it frequently imposes an immense burden on the emotions, time, and career development of Black and other URM academics (Evans and Moore, 2015Evans L. Moore W.L. Impossible Burdens: White Institutions, Emotional Labor, and Micro-Resistance.Soc. Probl. 2015; 62: 439-454Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Colleagues from more privileged communities can help ease that burden by participating in ongoing efforts at their institutions as well as confronting the racism present in their research environment through these difficult but necessary conversations."

https://openalex.org/W3097706673,"Diversity is foundational for the fruition of technological advancement and scientific discovery. A diverse body of researchers is essential to tackle STEM in ways we cannot fully explore with a homogeneous workforce. Moreover, the lack of visible representation can often dissuade underrepresented students from pursuing careers in STEM. What sort of messages might someone subconsciously process when they see a homogeneous makeup of classes, scientists featured on presentations, lab personnel, or entire graduate programs? Mentorship is sorely needed for those who are underrepresented in our fields and may not have access to a network of mentors who can identify with their experiences and encourage their interests in STEM. How might our academic landscapes change if we prioritized strong mentorship? How much more would students benefit if those mentors also shared their backgrounds and resonated more strongly with their unique experiences? I have often pondered these questions while existing as the only Black woman in my classrooms and scientific labs for years. This led me to create the organization MUSE (Mentorship for Underrepresented STEM Enthusiasts) as a first year PhD student. MUSE partners underrepresented students applying to college and graduate school with underrepresented STEM graduate students and professionals. Donations allow us to set up scholarships for students and also pay our mentors for their time, acknowledging that efforts to diversify STEM in our universities have historically been carried out by our most marginalized. Together, we envision an academy where our science thrives because the diverse communities behind it are thriving too. Every laboratory I have ever been in has taught me something about mentoring. While many learn what they do and don’t like in mentoring based the culmination of their experiences, most don’t learn about some of the unique challenges that affect underrepresented minorities and further, how to mentor them effectively. The argument of mentoring everyone the exact same way ignores the very nature and intricacy of what it means to be an effective mentor (which is different from being a boss). In many ways, mentoring is both a tax and an investment. Fundamentally, taxes paid are supposed to improve the community. Unfortunately, some are better at tax evasion than others and underrepresented minorities (both mentees and mentors) disproportionately pay that societal service tax (cultural taxation). This tax manifests itself in doing things like outreach events. Investments on the other hand build equity. In mentoring, you are investing in the next generation to give them more equity in the scientific community than you did when you started. Being a good mentor is knowing that aspiring scientists start with varying amounts of equity in terms of different gaps and insecurities. Being a better mentor is learning how to identify and understand those gaps and insecurities through effective communication, especially in underrepresented minority populations, and working to figure out where, when, and how to invest in them. One practical conversation starter is simply to ask them, “How can I help you succeed here?” To be clear, this is a trust building question so if you ask it, mean it, and be ready to listen, learn, and act. As research mentors, we have a responsibility to train our students how to think critically as scientists, help them develop self-confidence, and fuel the growth of their ability to present their work, write scientific proposals, and be effective mentors themselves. However, this is not enough. For underrepresented minorities in the sciences, there might not be anyone who looks like us in our department, our PhD program, or our lab. This means that to survive in academia, we redesign ourselves through code-switching and repressing our real selves. We are often told by our peers that our achievements are due to our status as a minority: that we did not earn our place like everyone else. These are the struggles that we face. That is why we cannot settle with just training underrepresented minorities in the sciences, we need to take it a step further. We need to understand the socioeconomic and disadvantaged backgrounds of our mentees. We need to help them navigate their struggles and overcome their barriers, so they not only succeed in STEM but are seen and belong in STEM. As a former undocumented immigrant, I have inherited these lessons from the mentors who invested in me. And through the STEM organization Científico Latino, we will work so underrepresented scientists succeed and can unapologetically be themselves in STEM. Mentoring is critical at all times. Yet, current challenges due to the global coronavirus, as well as our nation’s most recent reckoning with injustice and continuing systemic racism, bring new light to a need for revisiting how we mentor. Science is more than grants we receive, knowledge we “produce,” and papers we disseminate. These products represent “what” we do in our science and serve as a proxy for impact, yet emerge from “how” we come to know and intentionally support those individuals we mentor. Face-to-face engagement has been upended, and we now have an opportunity and responsibility to ask what serves well. I suggest we enact mentoring as stewardship, which positions us to contribute with purpose to promote individual growth in context, even as we grow scholarship. Mentoring as stewardship requires that we challenge false equivalences about mentoring. Mentoring is distinct from the following: advising in an institutional setting where expectations are shared from a top-down perspective, role-modeling whereby we passively demonstrate success, imprinting in which we actively train individuals to pattern behavior after ours or norms of a group, or gatekeeping in which we guard who enters and advances, often based on personal preconceptions and assumptions. Active support of individuals across demographic groups in cultivating developmental mentoring networks—inclusive of peers, senior mentors, resources, and even diverse social media-based connections and communities—can help them advance based on personal career visions while achieving scientific expectations. Matriculating into medical school requires considerable financial resources, social capital, and access to reliable information. These resources are simply not available to many students of color. Since 2014, I have mentored students from disadvantaged backgrounds through the David Geffen School of Medicine’s Reapplicant Program for post-baccalaureate students who failed to matriculate into any medical school. Most of these students belong to groups underrepresented in medicine (URM) and all have very compelling personal narratives. Many had to work full time in college to support themselves and their families. A few grew up in active warzones. A few are DACA students. Despite their personal struggles, they all managed to earn good—but not perfect—grades and demonstrate sustained commitment to humanistic pursuits. One common impediment to their initial applications was falling below screening cutoffs for GPA and MCAT scores. This meant that their applications were likely filtered out before a human being could read them. With each cohort, I spent >1 year helping the students improve their GPA, MCAT scores, clinical experiences, communication skills, and social networks. The students received floods of interview invites once they were able to clear screening cutoffs. Nearly all who reapplied received multiple acceptances from competitive programs. In sum, my experience in mentoring reapplicant URM students suggests that many are excluded by overly stringent cutoffs and that their full academic potentials are unrealized due to inadequate mentorship. It wasn’t long ago that I couldn’t see how I fit into the science industry. I had a passion for science and investigation, but as a Black woman, I had very few examples of what my existence in STEM would look like post-education. Luckily, I have met and worked alongside some extraordinary scientists who have been transparent with the realities of their experience to allow me to make an informed decision to stay in STEM. It was through their affirmations and encouragement that I began to see myself as a real scientist. I largely credit my commitment to STEM to these interactions. To be mentored was to be seen. My mentees took the time to get to know me as an individual and value my potential as a scientist; there is a lot that comes of being made to feel as though you are a contributory party to a wider community. The saying “it takes a village” is extremely relevant when it comes to supporting underrepresented scientists. The push to amplify the voices of scientists from underrepresented backgrounds applies to everyone because increasing the visibility of Black scientists increases the humanity of science. This is just one of the ways that early-career scientists from underrepresented communities can be supported. Through opportunities and genuine shows of support, we need to know that we are welcomed and valued in the science community."
https://openalex.org/W3095688809,"The treatment of cancer cells obtained by blocking cellular metabolism has received a lot of attention recently. Previous studies have demonstrated that Kras mutation-mediated abnormal glucose metabolism would lead to an aberrant cell proliferation in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells. Previous literature has suggested that consumption of fish oil is associated with lower risk of pancreatic cancer. In this study, we investigated the anti-cancer effects of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in human PDAC cells in vitro and in vivo. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) significantly inhibited the proliferation of human PDAC cells. The actions of DHA were evaluated through an induction of cell cycle arrest at G1 phase and noticed a decreased expression of cyclin A, cyclin E and cyclin B proteins in HPAF-II cells. Moreover, it was found that co-treatment of DHA and gemcitabine (GEM) effectively induced oxidative stress and cell death in HPAF-II cells. Interestingly, DHA leads to an increased oxidative glutathione /reduced glutathione (GSSG/GSH) ratio and induced cell apoptosis in HPAF-II cells. The findings in the study showed that supplementation of GSH or N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) could reverse DHA-mediated cell death in HPAF-II cells. Additionally, DHA significantly increased cellular level of cysteine, cellular NADP/NADPH ratio and the expression of cystathionase (CTH) and SLCA11/xCT antiporter proteins in HPAF-II cells. The action of DHA was, in part, associated with the inactivation of STAT3 cascade in HPAF-II cells. Treatment with xCT inhibitors, such as erastin or sulfasalazine (SSZ), inhibited the cell survival ability in DHA-treated HPAF-II cells. DHA also inhibited nucleotide synthesis in HPAF-II cells. It was demonstrated in a mouse-xenograft model that consumption of fish oil significantly inhibited the growth of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and decreased cellular nucleotide level in tumor tissues. Furthermore, fish oil consumption induced an increment of GSSG/GSH ratio, an upregulation of xCT and CTH proteins in tumor tissues. In conclusion, DHA significantly inhibited survival of PDAC cells both in vitro and in vivo through its recently identified novel mode of action, including an increment in the ratio of GSSG/GSH and NADP/NADPH respectively, and promoting reduction in the levels of nucleotide synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W3097527540,"Summary Large-scale sequencing projects, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), have generated high throughput sequencing and molecular profiling data sets, but it is still challenging to identify potentially causal changes in cellular processes in cancer as well as in other diseases in an automated fashion. We developed the netboxr package written in the R programming language, which makes use of the NetBox algorithm to identify candidate cancer-related functional modules. The algorithm makes use of a data-driven, network-based approach that combines prior knowledge with a network clustering algorithm, obviating the need for and the limitation of independently curated functionally labeled gene sets. The method can combine multiple data types, such as mutations and copy number alterations, leading to more reliable identification of functional modules. We make the tool available in the Bioconductor R ecosystem for applications in cancer research and cell biology.

For researchers dedicated to the cause, thorough experimental standards at the bench, in the clinic, and within the community must prioritize adequate representation and cultural competency. Not everyone is up for the challenge. Responsible health disparities research requires a multifaceted approach to address genetic, biological, socioeconomic, and lifestyle contributors to disease. For researchers dedicated to the cause, thorough experimental standards at the bench, in the clinic, and within the community must prioritize adequate representation and cultural competency. Not everyone is up for the challenge. I am grateful to work in an environment where racism in the form of health disparities is confronted at the bench, in the clinic, and in the community. I am a postdoctoral fellow by rank and a translational scientist at heart. For a decade, I have devoted my studies and my career to eradicating prostate cancer health disparities in Black men. My mission is personal—my dad and numerous other family members have been diagnosed at various stages of the disease in the prime of their lives. I am all too familiar with the complexities surrounding screening barriers, treatment options, and quality of life as it particularly pertains to Black men. Based on my training experiences in the clinic, I have observed firsthand how prostate cancer “looks different” in Black men compared to men of other ethnicities. Black men are much more likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer, more than twice as likely to die from the disease, and they are often diagnosed at younger ages than those who are typically detected with current screening age guidelines. There are many factors that contribute to this glaring disparity in incidence and mortality including genetic, biological, socioeconomic, and lifestyle variables (Woods-Burnham et al., 2020Woods-Burnham L. Stiel L. Martinez S.R. Sanchez-Hernandez E.S. Ruckle H.C. Almaguel F.G. Stern M.C. Roberts L.R. Williams D.R. Montgomery S. et al.Psychosocial Stress, Glucocorticoid Signaling, and Prostate Cancer Health Disparities in African American Men.Cancer Health Disparities. 2020; https://doi.org/10.9777/chd.2020.1005Crossref Google Scholar). It is for these reasons that a multifaceted approach is not only ideal, but necessary, to comprehensively address this disease. There are various funding opportunities available to researchers who have carved out a specific niche dedicated to addressing health disparities. Researchers are aware that if they can incorporate a health-disparities “angle” to their topic of interest, they can seek additional funding beyond what is accessible to the general scientific community. In a time of funding scarcity, it is tempting to get creative and pursue grant money from multiple sources. After all, there is beauty in our ability as scientists to pivot and turn our research focus as scientific questions are ever evolving. However, a real danger exists when researchers grasp for unfamiliar straws out of funding desperation—and those unfamiliar straws happen to involve studies “inclusive” of underrepresented or disease-burdened populations. Culturally sensitive and culturally competent health disparities research requires a deep familiarity with the population of interest. To approach a scientific topic without an intimate knowledge of key variables is an error of experimental design. This statement is not to imply that researchers cannot pursue a health disparities topic outside of their respective ethnicities, but rather that an effort must be made to foster pertinent discussions or include key collaborators whose ethnicities match the population of interest in order to fully understand the cultural nuances that affect the multifaceted contributing factors of disease etiology and health-care experiences. Within the world of health disparities research, these efforts are often lacking or insincere. Because health disparities are not prioritized in the scientific mainstream, a deficiency in adequate resources and materials has been normalized. Although the National Institutes of Health currently call for cell line authentication (National Institutes of Health, 2015aNational Institutes of HealthEnhanced Reproducibility through Rigor and Transparency (effective Jan. 25, 2016). Notice Number: NOT-OD-15-103.https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-15-103.htmlDate: 2015Google Scholar, National Institutes of Health, 2015bNational Institutes of HealthNIH Rigor and Reproducibility: Principles and Guidelines for Reporting Preclinical Research and Endorsement by major journals.http://www.nih.gov/research-training/rigor-reproducibility/principles-guidelines-reporting-preclinical-researchDate: 2015Date accessed: September 2, 2020Google Scholar), there are no official recommendations to verify the race/ethnicity of biospecimens. Apathetic research efforts coupled with an absence of mandated accountability results in less-rigorous standards that would be unacceptable in other scientific fields. For example, alongside my colleagues, I have published on the glaring lack of racially diverse human cell lines available for in vitro analyses (Hooker et al., 2019Hooker Jr., S.E. Woods-Burnham L. Bathina M. Lloyd S. Gorjala P. Mitra R. Nonn L. Kimbro K.S. Kittles R.A. Genetic Ancestry Analysis Reveals Misclassification of Commonly Used Cancer Cell Lines.Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 2019; 28: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In order to conduct meaningful studies at the bench capable of efficient translation to the clinic, it is imperative to probe biological pathways of disease at the cellular level. It is often difficult to achieve biospecimen diversity because there are few commercially available non-European human cell lines for purchase. Considering that the first immortalized human cell line was derived from Henrietta Lacks—a Black woman—without her consent (C, 1974C B.J. HeLa (for Henrietta Lacks).Science. 1974; 184: 1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), it remains frustrating that, in the era of consent, diversity in biospecimens does not exist for researchers seeking to eradicate racial disparities in disease outcomes. To make matters worse, of the few non-European cell lines available, there have been misclassifications of racial ancestry. For example, the E006aa-hT human cell line was marketed as a “Black prostate cancer” cell line. However, upon ancestry analysis with single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping, my colleagues and I reported in 2019 that E006aa-hT was found to carry 92% European ancestry (Hooker et al., 2019Hooker Jr., S.E. Woods-Burnham L. Bathina M. Lloyd S. Gorjala P. Mitra R. Nonn L. Kimbro K.S. Kittles R.A. Genetic Ancestry Analysis Reveals Misclassification of Commonly Used Cancer Cell Lines.Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 2019; 28: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Furthermore, E006aa-hT shared an 86% short tandem repeat profile match to a renal cell carcinoma. For those truly concerned with eradicating health disparities of Black men with prostate cancer, the obvious approach would be to discontinue the use of this controversial cell line. However, our finding did not immediately halt publications of prostate cancer studies using this biospecimen. Instead, it took the removal of the cell line from major commercial suppliers in response to our publication to eliminate its use in research. To productively move the field forward, when such errors are discovered they must be transparently acknowledged in order to accurately re-interpret findings from the literature. I was personally faced with such a research predicament upon discovering that my previous racial assignment of the 22Rv1 prostate-cancer cell line in 2017 as carrying mixed ancestry using a small validated subset of ancestry informative markers was incomplete (Woods-Burnham et al., 2017Woods-Burnham L. Basu A. Cajigas-Du Ross C.K. Love A. Yates C. De Leon M. Roy S. Casiano C.A. The 22Rv1 prostate cancer cell line carries mixed genetic ancestry: Implications for prostate cancer health disparities research using pre-clinical models.Prostate. 2017; 77: 1601-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A larger validated comprehensive subset revealed that 22Rv1 carries 99% European ancestry (Hooker et al., 2019Hooker Jr., S.E. Woods-Burnham L. Bathina M. Lloyd S. Gorjala P. Mitra R. Nonn L. Kimbro K.S. Kittles R.A. Genetic Ancestry Analysis Reveals Misclassification of Commonly Used Cancer Cell Lines.Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 2019; 28: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Upon full analysis, my colleagues and I promptly reported our findings in 2019 (Hooker et al., 2019Hooker Jr., S.E. Woods-Burnham L. Bathina M. Lloyd S. Gorjala P. Mitra R. Nonn L. Kimbro K.S. Kittles R.A. Genetic Ancestry Analysis Reveals Misclassification of Commonly Used Cancer Cell Lines.Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 2019; 28: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Although potentially embarrassing for me, there was no hesitation in publicly clarifying the ambiguity. This type of response is non-negotiable for researchers sincerely committed to the cause, and I attribute my passion to my unwavering love for my family and community. There is a natural trend for scientists and physicians to pay it forward into communities similar to their neighborhoods of origin (Powers et al., 2016Powers B.W. White A.A. Oriol N.E. Jain S.H. Race-Conscious Professionalism and African American Representation in Academic Medicine.Acad. Med. 2016; 91: 913-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Creative approaches to community-based and translational research are instinctive to researchers whose individual identities align with a culture of interest. For these reasons, adequate representation is imperative to comprehensively address varying degrees of health disparities from the student to faculty level (Figure 1). There should be a logical incentive to recruit STEM talent from surrounding communities of color. But grassroot efforts don’t match intentions even when health disparities research is touted as an institutional priority. While serving on admissions committees, my colleagues and I have been repeatedly disturbed by the absence of targeted recruitment efforts toward underrepresented minorities living in close proximity to campus. Specifically, there is an awkward disregard of talented and capable Black or Latino students in the institutions’ “own backyards”—especially if those backyards are economically disadvantaged. As an alternative approach, I have consistently observed recruitment efforts prioritized toward international students to meet institutional diversity quotas. These international individuals could excel academically but are naturally unfamiliar with pertinent local disparities. The downstream effects of this trend are dangerous. It is not enough to recruit local talent; their ideas and input must be valued. An inherent risk of research insensitivity or misconduct exists at a greater level when the opinions of those familiar with the community’s values are disregarded. In my frequent collaborations with public-health, scientific, and clinical colleagues in a concerted effort to provide prostate cancer education and screening to Black men in underserved communities, there have been several instances when golden nuggets of cultural feedback have been ignored by non-Black individuals unfamiliar with pertinent community context. Strategic advice that would increase the comfort of Black study participants and better answer the scientific questions has been swiftly ignored. It has been in these decisive moments that I have become acutely aware that not all researchers “dedicated” to the cause of health disparities are true allies. Intrinsic racism creeps its way into the decision-making conference rooms. Financial incentives are driving increased representation of researchers who can weigh in on culturally sensitive conversations regarding study design, but true inclusion in these conversations remains elusive. There are a few funding opportunities available to increase underrepresented minority representation at multiple levels of academic career development including institutional training grants and diversity supplements. At the surface, these funding opportunities offer a win-win approach for the institution, the principal investigator, and the trainee. However, based on interactions with my colleagues, there is an underlying sense that the financial incentive to fund an underrepresented minority trainee supersedes and often eclipses the rich cultural perspective and expertise that is brought to the table by the trainee. Many trainees feel a constant pressure by others to prove that they are worthy of their position while simultaneously suppressing individual cultural traits that stick out in the scientific setting. It is ironic that the cultural identity that was a non-negotiable piece of a funding award requirement must later be downplayed for the duration of the award so as not to offend anyone within the work environment. At the same time, our unique cultural traits are also fetishized and highly sought after as we are pulled in many directions as the “token” underrepresented minority frequently advertised to improve institutional aesthetic. For Black researchers whose genuine goal is to eradicate health disparities, we can rise above the aforementioned obstacles when given the opportunity. Despite the challenges, we remain steadfast in our ability to earn academic positions of prestige. Because of the resilience passed on to us by our enslaved ancestors, we have mastered the art of turning lemons into lemonade. We can—and will—flip the script as many ways as necessary to better the health outcomes for ourselves, our families, and our communities. We remain confident in our unique abilities to speak for our culture and represent our best interests. L.W.B. is supported by NIH grant number 1T32CA186895 ."

Methods Surveys were conducted at baseline (September 2016) and seven months after a training intervention (March 2018) using the World Health Organization standardized injection practices assessment tool. HCWs were sampled at 15 purposively government health facilities in two provinces. HCWs were observed during injection practices and interviewed by trained experts from Becton-Dickinson and the Ministry of Health Cambodia. The Rao-Scott chi square test was used test for differences between baseline and follow-up. Results We completed 115 observations of practice at baseline and 206 at post-training follow-up. The proportion of patients whose identification was confirmed by HCWs prior to procedure being performed increased from 40.4% to 98% (p <0.0001). The proportion of HCWs who practiced correct hand hygiene increased from 22.0% to 80.6% (p = 0.056) [therapeutic observations] and 17.2% to 63.4% (p = 0.0012) [diagnostic observations]. Immediate disposal of sharps by HCWs decreased from 96.5% to 92.5% (p = 0.0030). Conclusions We found significant improvements in the practice of patient identity confirmation and hand hygiene but not in the immediate disposal of sharps in the post-training intervention. However, findings are not representative of all HCWs in the country. Further pre-service and in-service training and monitoring are necessary to ensure sustained behavior change."
