https://openalex.org/W2100899040,"Surface temperatures of perennial plants in the Sonoran Desert of California ranged from 20 degrees C above air temperature to over 18 degrees C below air temperature during rapid growth periods following rain. Desert cactus with large photosynthetic stem surfaces had the highest temperatures and lowest transpiration rates. Perennial plants with relatively small leaves had moderate transpiration rates and leaf temperatures close to air temperature. Desert perennials with relatively large leaves had leaf temperatures well below air temperature along with the greatest accompanying transpiration rates of over 20 micrograms per square centimeter per second, but also had correspondingly low temperatures for maximum photosynthesis. The low leaf temperatures measured for these large-leafed species are an exception to the more common pattern for desert plants whereby a smaller leaf size prevents overheating and leads to reductions in transpiration and increased water-use efficiency. The contribution of a larger leaf size to a lower leaf temperature, and thus higher rate of photosynthesis for these large-leafed species, may represent an adaptive pattern previously unrecognized for desert plants."
https://openalex.org/W2067505402,"A physical basis for reductionism is put forth in the form of five propositions that bridge levels of organization in natural phenomena. The outlook is that complex systems and processes all have to be traced back to physical law, which applies the only general scientific constraint on reality, but that out of physical law a hierarchy of organization emerges. The basic extension of normal physics in this homeokinetic field form is to complex systems. In such systems the repetitive units of concern are internally complex and exhibit elaborate internal time-delayed processes, for example, memory."
https://openalex.org/W2075195427,"Photochemical calculations indicate that if NH3 outgassed from Titan it should have been converted to a dense N2 atmosphere during the lifetime of the satellite. A crucial step in the process involves a gas phase reaction of N2H4 with H. The most favorable conditions for this step would be the intermediate production of a CH4-H2 greenhouse capable of raising the gas temperature to 150°K. Subsequently about 20 bars of N2 could have evolved. The pressure-induced opacity of 20 bars of N2 should suffice to explain the recently measured 200°K surface temperature. Unlike the situation on Jupiter, NH3 is not recycled on Titan by reactions involving N2 or N2H4. This may explain the failure of recent attempts to detect NH3 in the upper atmosphere of Titan."
https://openalex.org/W2009994351,"One of the series of Yale natural radiocarbonmeasurements, II [ Science 122, 954 (1955)], byRichard S. Preston, Elaine Person, and E. S.Deevey, was incorrectly reported through a technical error. The date for sample Y-293A (SouthHaven, Mich.: peat) was 10,790 ± 200 yr, not9500 + 250 yr as reported on page 958."
https://openalex.org/W2083482549,"Far from threatening the persistence and geographic extent of red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) in Florida, wood-boring marine isopods may aid the plant to survive wave action by initiating branching of aerial prop roots. Evidence for a recent, sudden increase in density or range of one such isopod, Sphaeroma terebrans, is anecdotal and weak. Insect damage to mangrove aerial roots even before they descend to the water is at least as great as that wrought by isopods and also causes root branching. Aerial and submarine damage combine to stimulate root initiation so that, for every root produced aerially by the tree, at least 1.4 roots reach the substrate. Similar responses to herbivory, which have been reported for other plants, suggest that herbivores may both benefit and harm plants, and that their impact may be more difficult to assess in specific instances than has been realized."

https://openalex.org/W2022753979,"With 12 percent of U.S. electricity now being supplied by nuclear power, Commonwealth Edison has found nuclear plants to be good investments relative to other base load energy sources. The country's largest user of nuclear power, Commonwealth Edison, estimates that its commitment to nuclear saved its customers about 10 percent on their electric bills in 1977, compared to the cost with the next best alternative, coal. This advantage is seen as continuing, contrary to criticisms of the economics and reliability of nuclear power and claims that it has hidden subsidies. It is concluded that there is a need for both nuclear and coal and that government policy precluding or restricting either would be unwise."

By manipulating the acoustic properties of this system and measuring the neural output, a bilobed, highly directional mechanism associated with the slits is observed, confirming Autrum's original hypothesis."

https://openalex.org/W2042677535,"Laboratory experiments in which wind was blown gently over a regular crossed-wave pattern have clearly shown the existence of regular, steady, and reproducible Langmuir circulations. The circulations were present only when both the wind and the wave patterns existed at the same time. With circulations having an across-wind wavelength of 44 centimeters, the descending vertical motions carried turbulent surface water downward 39 centimeters to the bottom of the wind and wave tank. The observations are in general agreement with the mathematical model of Craik and Leibovich, although further experiments will be required to definitively test the analytical model."
https://openalex.org/W1973905599,Transmission electron microscope studies of fractured surfaces reveal that the shells of Tentaculites are constructed of calcite with a ridge and groove structure and cross-bladed fabric heretofore unique to some articulate brachiopods. A possible affinity with brachiopods or phoronids is suggested for Tentaculites.

https://openalex.org/W2035995267,"Present accounts of U.S. energy consumption are incomplete in two ways: they include neither the direct military uses of nuclear energy nor the mostly military, nonfuel uses of uranium. Preliminary estimates indicate that significant distortions are created in the data on U.S. nuclear energy consumption patterns as a result of these omissions."
https://openalex.org/W2045776155,"A discussion showed that Alaskan sour crude has displaced imported sour crude used by west coast refiners, but not the 600,000 bbl/day of imported sweet crude. In the absence of pipelines, the 550,000 bbl/day excess of Alaskan crude oil must be moved to the Gulf Coast by tankers. Atlantic Richfield Co. already has been forced to abandon its plans to deliver crude to the northern tier states by means of the existing 744 mi long Trans Mountain Pipeline between Puget Sound and Edmonton, Alberta, which ties in with the continental network of pipeline systems. Standard Oil Co. (Ohio)'s proposal to establish a 1027 mi Pactex pipeline from Long Beach, Calif., to Midland, Tex., is still an open question. Four other proposals have been made, including one by the Northern Tier Pipeline Co. which has considerable political support. In this plan, a deepwater terminal for supertankers would be built at Port Angeles. From there, the pipeline would go around Puget Sound's south end, swing north towards Seattle and then proceed 1550 mi to Clearbrook, Minn. The project would have a design capacity of 1.2 million bbl/day."
