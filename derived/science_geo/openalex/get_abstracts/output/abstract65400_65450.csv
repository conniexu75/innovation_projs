https://openalex.org/W1653139089,"Abstract A two-step pathway from l-serine to l-cysteine is described in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. Serine transacetylase, the first enzyme in this pathway, catalyzes the formation of O-acetyl-l-serine from l-serine and acetyl coenzyme A and is inhibited by l-cysteine. The enzyme has been purified approximately 1000-fold and has a spectrum similar to that of pyridoxal phosphate-containing enzymes. O-Acetylserine sulfhydrylase, the second enzyme in the pathway, catalyzes the formation of l-cysteine from O-acetyl-l-serine and sulfide. It is repressed in Salmonella grown on l-cysteine and derepressed when grown on l-djenkolic acid. Cys E mutants in S. typhimurium contain low or undetectable levels of serine transacetylase and variable levels of O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase."
https://openalex.org/W1530478933,"Abstract Diazoacetyl-dl-norleucine methyl ester rapidly inactivates pepsin. In the presence of cupric ions, only 1 eq of norleucine is introduced per molecule of pepsin. In the absence of cupric ions, the reaction is much slower, inactivation is not complete, and more than 1 eq of norleucine is incorporated. Little or no reaction occurs with pepsinogen or with pepsin previously inactivated by exposure to pH 8. The norleucine introduced into pepsin can be removed by treatment with hydroxylamine. Thus, there is reason to conclude that a single carboxyl group at the active site of pepsin may have been esterified by this reagent."
https://openalex.org/W1909735082,"Abstract Commercial samples of crystalline swine pepsin have been found to be heterogeneous by a number of criteria. Several active fractions can be obtained by chromatography on hydroxylapatite with phosphate buffers, pH 5.7, of increasing molarity as eluents. This has been found to be an effective procedure for evaluating the homogeneity of pepsin. End group analysis by the cyanate method yields 1 eq of isoleucine but as many as 9 other amino-terminal residues in fractional molar amounts. Treatment with carboxypeptidase A liberates 1 eq of alanine and fractional molar amounts of five other amino acids. These results suggest that commercial pepsin is a mixture of autodigested products, cleavage having occurred at various points in the pepsin chain. Evidence of fragmentation is also observed when reduced and carboxymethylated pepsin is passed through columns of Sephadex. It seems probable that autodigestion occurs during the industrial preparation of 1:10,000 pepsin, the starting material from which crystalline pepsin has traditionally been prepared. In order to obtain pepsin more suitable for structural studies and for investigations of the active site of the enzyme, it is necessary to begin with pepsinogen. In agreement with the results of others, we find that commercial samples of the zymogen are essentially homogeneous. Chromatography on diethylaminoethyl Sephadex A-25 and on hydroxylapatite does not reveal heterogeneity. Leucine is the sole amino-terminal residue found by the cyanate method. Treatment with carboxypeptidase A liberates no free amino acids from the native zymogen, but after reduction and carboxymethylation, carboxypeptidase A liberates 1 eq of alanine as the sole carboxyl-terminal residue. Apparently the carboxyl terminus is masked in native pepsinogen. A relatively homogeneous pepsin may be readily obtained by the activation of pepsinogen at 14° and pH 2 for 20 min. Separation of the enzyme from the peptides formed during the activation process is accomplished by passage through a column of sulfoethyl Sephadex C-25 at pH 4.4 and 0°. The acidic pepsin passes through unretarded, whereas the basic peptides are tenaciously held and may be eluted with 0.1 m NH4OH. Pepsin prepared in this manner in 95% yield is homogeneous on DEAE-Sephadex A-25 and on hydroxylapatite. It shows no evidence of heterogeneity upon reduction, carboxymethylation, and passage through Sephadex. It yields isoleucine as the sole amino-terminal and alanine as the sole carboxyl-terminal residue. Carboxypeptidase B does not liberate basic amino acid residues. Failure of the carboxypeptidases to liberate any amino acid other than alanine suggests that proline is the third residue from the carboxyl terminus of both pepsinogen and pepsin. A proline residue in this position would block further action by either carboxypeptidase A or B. The homogeneity of the pepsin formed depends critically upon the pH of the activation process. If activation is carried out at pH 3 or pH 3.9 instead of at pH 2, additional active species are obtained. Amino acid analyses have been carried out on pepsinogen and on the pepsin derived from it. The zymogen has been found to have 363 amino acid residues; the enzyme, 321. In the activation process, 42 residues, including 9 of lysine, 2 of histidine, and 2 of arginine, are cleaved off. These are almost exactly accounted for by the amino acid composition of the total peptide fraction obtained from the activation mixture. Pepsin freshly prepared from pepsinogen has about 1.3 times the activity of the commercial product against hemoglobin as a substrate, but somewhat less activity against acetylphenylalanyldiiodotyrosine. Preliminary evidence is mentioned which suggests that freshly prepared pepsin may differ in several properties from the commercial material. The investigation of these and other aspects of the behavior of pepsin should be facilitated by the availability of homogeneous, reproducible preparations of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1599330430,"Abstract Sulfate is bound firmly to Salmonella typhimurium. The binding ability is repressible. The binding site is located near the cell surface, and has been suggested as playing a role in active transport of sulfate. A simple procedure for obtaining the sulfate-binding material in homogeneous form is reported here. The material has a molecular weight of 32,000 and is of typical amino acid composition, except that it lacks the sulfur-containing amino acids. No cofactor or energy requirements were found. One sulfate ion is bound per molecule at saturation. The dissociation constant is low (as low as 0.02 µm), and is highly dependent on ionic strength."
https://openalex.org/W1562682267,"Mutants of Salmonella typhimurium classified by nutritional and enzymatic tests as transport-negative for sulfate are capable of combining with small amounts of this anion (up to 104 molecules per bacterium). The following results support the suggestion that the bacteria possess highly specific sulfate binding sites near the cell surface. 1. Under growth conditions sulfate combines with the bacteria according to a typical adsorption isotherm, which reaches half-saturation at 0.004 mm. 2. Various anions structurally similar to sulfate are specific inhibitors of binding and transport. 3. Inability of the mutants to grow on sulfate or thiosulfate suggests that the anions cannot enter the cells, but are bound near the cell surface. 4. The cells lose their ability to bind sulfate after they are converted to spheroplasts or are osmotically shocked. With the use of a new assay for the measurement of binding to soluble entities, the binding ability lost from the cells is found in solution. 5. The properties of the binding system suggest that it might be a part of the active transport system for sulfate. The surface location of the binding material as well as the following results are consistent with this hypothesis. Both binding activity and active transport are repressed by the growth of bacteria on cysteine as a sulfur source. Both functions are similarly (but not identically) inhibited by various anions. Both functions are lost, in proportion, upon osmotic shock of transport-positive cells. Both functions are simultaneously lost in a class of chromate-resistant mutants, and are regained upon transduction with PLT-22 phage or reversion."
https://openalex.org/W1577039191,"The ability of Escherichia coli K-12 to take up leucine, isoleucine, or valine against apparent concentration gradients is considerably reduced when the cells are subjected to osmotic shock in the cold. When the lyophilized supernatant fluid derived from that treatment was dialyzed against labeled amino acids, binding of leucine, isoleucine, or valine was observed. With leucine or isoleucine binding as an assay, a protein was isolated and highly purified. The dissociation constants for the leucine and isoleucine complexes were found to be indistinguishable from their respective Km values for cellular uptake. The results suggest that the isolated protein may well be part of an amino acid transport system of E. coli."

This activity is detected when extracts of D and E mutants are combined. The interacting component in each mutant extract has a low s value, while the active species in the mixture has a high s value and consists of both components. The s value of the complex is the same as the value obtained with wild-type anthranilate synthetase. One of the interacting components is the enzyme catalyzing the succeeding step in tryptophan biosynthesis."

https://openalex.org/W2028187565,"Transfer RNA from yeast, liver, and Escherichia coli has cytokinin activity in the tobacco callus bioassay, whereas ribosomal RNA from yeast is inactive. In contrast to fractions of yeast transfer RNA rich in serine acceptor and cytokinin activity, preparations (70 to 90 percent pure) of arginine transfer RNA(2), glycine transfer RNA, phenylalanine transfer RNA, and valine transfer RNA(1) and of highly purified alanine transfer RNA from yeast were inactive at concentrations of 20 to 2500 micrograms per liter. One molecule of 6-(gamma,gamma-dimethylallylamino) purine per 20 molecules of yeast tRNA would account for the observed cytokinin activity. The number of major molecular species contributing to cytokinin activity of transfer RNA, therefore, must be small."
https://openalex.org/W1520696547,"The indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthetase of Escherichia coli was purified to apparent homogeneity and was crystallized. The enzyme is a single polypeptide chain of 45,000 molecular weight with 1 NH2-terminal methionine residue. The amino acid composition of the protein was determined. The rate of synthesis of this polypeptide chain in E. coli was found to be identical with the rate of synthesis of the polypeptide chains of the tryptophan synthetase α and β2 subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1577818272,"Abstract Anthranilate synthetase was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and gel filtration from extracts of an episome-bearing Escherichia coli mutant grown under conditions of tryptophan pathway derepression. This purification represented an 18-fold increase in specific activity over the activity of the derepressed mutant extract. Starch gel electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation revealed only slight contamination of the anthranilate synthetase protein. An s20,w0 of 10.7 S was obtained for the native enzyme. Kinetic studies with anthranilate synthetase have been initiated. The reaction catalyzed by this enzyme requires two substrates, chorismate and l-glutamine. The reaction mechanism was found to be sequential, and the presence of one substrate on the active site of the enzyme does not affect the binding of the second substrate. In the presence of the feedback inhibitor, l-tryptophan, l-glutamine utilization is noncompetitively inhibited. In addition, l-tryptophan is a partially competitive inhibitor of chorismate utilization."

https://openalex.org/W1577434609,"Abstract A pantothenate-requiring auxotroph and a β-alanine-requiring auxotroph of Escherichia coli were grown in media supplemented with radioactive pantothenate or β-alanine, respectively. Analyses of extracts of these organisms showed that acyl carrier protein accounts for approximately 90% of the radioactivity associated with the protein fraction. Studies with the pantothenate auxotroph indicate that under the conditions of these experiments acyl carrier protein and coenzyme A are the major cellular constituents which contain pantothenate. In addition, it was found that the cellular concentration of coenzyme A is directly related to the concentration of pantothenate in the medium, whereas the concentration of acyl carrier protein does not vary under a variety of growth conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1498622226,"Abstract The individual reactions comprising the rhodanese-catalyzed thiosulfate-lipoate reaction were demonstrated kinetically. The mechanism was shown to be a reaction sequence in which the enzyme forms kinetically significant binary complexes with both thiosulfate and dihydrolipoate substrates. Moreover, the first product (sulfite) is discharged, forming a sulfur-substituted enzyme intermediate, before the second substrate (dihydrolipoate) is attached. It was further shown that the mechanism includes mutually competitive inhibition reactions with both substrates. Extension of the analysis to several pH values permitted determination of the variation in kinetic coefficients with pH. The changes in these values over the pH range of 8 to 11 suggested that the enzyme exists in an association equilibrium between monomeric and dimeric species and that an enzymic sulfhydryl group is involved in lipoate binding."

https://openalex.org/W1511498291,"Abstract An enzyme, d-phosphoarabinoisomerase, which stoichiometrically interconverts d-arabinose 5-phosphate and d-ribulose 5-phosphate, was isolated from Escherichia coli. At equilibrium, 75% of d-arabinose-5-P and 25% of d-ribulose-5-P are found. This unstable enzyme does not show any requirement for added cofactor, and is inhibited by Mn++, Co++, Zn++, Cd++, p-chloromercuribenzoate, and phosphate. The optimum pH is 8.0. The Km is 1.36 x 10-3 m for darabinose-5-P and 5.40 x 10-4 m for d-ribulose-5-P. The enzyme lacks activity toward d-arabinose, d-ribulose, d-ribose, and d-ribose-5-P. This enzyme not only accounts for the metabolic origin of the precursor for 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate (KDO), a constituent in the cell wall lipopolysaccharide of E. coli and some other gram-negative bacteria, but also fits into the schema suggested for the utilization of d-arabinose-1-P generated in the metabolism of d-arabinosyl nucleosides. The enzyme is absent from yeast and mouse fibroblasts. d-Arabinose-5-P was synthesized by phosphorylating d-glucosamine followed by ninhydrin degradation. The product was contaminated with d-ribulose-5-P and was purified by precipitation of the latter with borate. d-Ribulose-5-P was obtained by phosphorylating d-ribulose with a d-ribulokinase isolated from E. coli. The product showed a distinct carbonyl absorption band in its infrared spectrum. Upon periodate oxidation, phosphoglycolaldehyde was detected as a major degradation product, as was expected for d-ribulose-5-P. However, this purified preparation of d-ribulokinase also phosphorylated l-fuculose at position 1."
https://openalex.org/W1542470963,"Pieces of ventral prostate from adult C3H mice were cultivated in organ culture for 3 weeks. One group served as a control; another was treated for I week with methylcholanthrene or 9,1O-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene and for 2 additional weeks in normal medium. The pieces were pooled and dispersed with pronase into individual cells that were plated as cell cultures. The control cultures invariably died. The treated cells formed permanent lines that, on subcutaneous injection of from 1 to 2 X 10^6 cells into adult, unconditioned, male C3H mice, produced progressively growing, transplantable tumors. The tumors were mostly sarcomas, but included two anaplastic carcinomas. Malignant transformation in vitro has thus been achieved with carcinogenic hydrocarbons in this system."
https://openalex.org/W982669008,"A novel type of sugar nucleotide, containing 1 rather than 2 phosphate residues, was isolated from Escherichia coli K-235. The nucleotide was shown to be cytidine 5'-monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid in which the sialic acid was glycosidically linked to the phosphate residue. The glycoside was highly sensitive to acid, and optical rotation studies showed that it was the β anomer, in contrast to other known, natural, sialidase-sensitive sialic acid glycosides."

Polydeoxyadenylate-thymidylate, polyadenylate, and histone interacted to a lesser degree than native DNA's did. That magnesium ion, sodium ion, and proflavine did not interfere with interaction of carcinogen and DNA suggests that this interaction is not an intercalation.

https://openalex.org/W1594713333,"Abstract The initial kinetics of induction and the steady state rates of synthesis of β-galactosidase and thiogalactoside transacetylase in Escherichia coli were examined under a variety of conditions. Kinetic experiments with 5-fluorouracil and carbon starvation suggest that the z gene is transcribed into messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) before the a gene. In general, when protein synthesis was impaired, formation of transacetylase mRNA (defined as enzyme-forming capacity) was delayed, although β-galactosidase mRNA (similarly defined) occurred at its usual time. When protein synthesis was completely blocked, the z gene could be transcribed but the a gene could not. To explain these findings, a tentative scheme is proposed in which a gene transcription is controlled by the rate at which ribosomes travel along the completed portion of the mRNA. Since ribosomes do not appear to be as critical for the transcription of the z gene, it is suggested that the RNA polymerase maybe able to advance ahead of the leading ribosome by a certain critical distance. Kinetic experiments also suggested that the transcription of the z gene required a shorter exposure to inducer than did a gene transcription. Chloramphenicol, which specifically delayed the induction of the transacetylase, also inhibited its steady state production more than the steady state synthesis of β-galactosidase. At an antibiotic concentration of 2 µg per ml, the synthesis of β-galactosidase continued, while that of thiogalactoside transacetylase was completely inhibited."

The peptides were separated initially on Dowex 1-X2 or Dowex 50-X2 and further purified by various methods. A total of 36 pure peptides was isolated and the sequences were partially or fully determined. These peptides provided many useful overlaps of peptides previously isolated from the tryptic digest. In addition, new peptides were isolated as well as others which confirmed sequences established from the tryptic digest. The sequence of the first 104 residues from the amino terminus is given."
https://openalex.org/W1588185066,"Abstract The activation of partially purified phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase from Salmonella typhimurium by various pyrimidine and purine nucleotides is described. The most potent activators are found to be cytidine diphosphate, guanosine triphosphate, and cytidine monophosphate, in that order. It is shown that in the presence of acetyl coenzyme A the affinity of the nucleotides for their binding site is increased. Evidence is presented to demonstrate that the nucleotides do not participate in the enzyme reaction, but act only catalytically. From these studies the physiological concept of compensatory feedback loops in the control of branched pathways is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1614053362,"Abstract Kinetic studies on the derepression of 5 of the 10 enzymes for histidine biosynthesis in Salmonnella typhimurium reveal that derepression may proceed by two different modes, depending upon the site of mutation in the various histidine auxotrophs examined. Simultaneous derepression of the enzymes is observed in those mutants incapable of producing the intermediate, 4-amino-5-imidazolecarboxamide ribonucleotide, through the histidine pathway. Derepression of the enzymes in a temporal sequence corresponding to the positional sequence of the genes in the histidine operon is observed in those mutants which do produce this intermediate. The addition of 4-amino-5-imidazolecarboxamide ribonucleoside to cultures of mutants ordinarily characterized by the simultaneous mode of derepression served to shift the mode from simultaneous to sequential, but did not influence the derepressed rate of enzyme synthesis. In organisms in which the sequential mode is ordinarily observed, adenine effected a shift to the simultaneous mode, causing all the enzymes to derepress at the same time, but did not influence the derepressed rate of enzyme synthesis. Chloramphenicol, at low concentrations, reduced the growth rate of derepressed cells by a factor of 2 to 3 and decreased the rate of derepression of the histidine enzymes in all organisms tested. In the histidine auxotroph, hisE11, and in the wild type, LT-2 (derepressed by the addition of thiazole alanine), chloramphenicol prolonged the intervals between the times of derepression of the histidine enzymes. On the other hand, in hisG52, in which the enzymes for histidine biosynthesis derepress simultaneously and not sequentially, chloramphenicol did not alter the time of derepression of the enzymes. In the presence of chloramphenicol, adenine shifted the mode of derepression of hisE11 and LT-2 from sequential to simultaneous, just as it did in the absence of chloramphenicol. However, adenine did not eliminate the effect of chloramphenicol on the rate of depression. The data presented here suggest that the histidine operon is transcribed into a polycistronic message which, under conditions in which sequential derepression is observed, is translated from one end only. Under conditions in which simultaneous derepression is observed, the translation of this message is initiated at multiple sites."
https://openalex.org/W85920464,"1. The sigmoid kinetics with respect to asparate and the competitive inhibition by cytidine triphosphate has been confirmed for aspartate transcarbamylase purified from Escherichia coli. 2. The pH dependences of native and heated aspartate transcarbamylase have been examined; that of the native enzyme is remarkable in exhibiting two optima, one at pH 8.5 and a much higher one at pH 10.2. 3. The effects of heat, urea, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, and pH 10.2 on both enzyme activity and CTP inhibition have been investigated. These treatments resulted in the loss of sigmoid kinetics but, in contradiction with previous reports, sensitivity to CTP inhibition was not destroyed. However, the CTP inhibition of these treated enzymes was no longer dependent upon the concentration of aspartate. 4. Sigmoid kinetics and end product inhibition are thus not inseparably linked properties of aspartate transcarbamylase, and the homotropic and heterotropic interactions are not completely interdependent. 5. The behavior of the enzyme on Sephadex has been examined. The behavior of heated enzyme was consistent with a breakdown to smaller units, but the other treatments which destroy the sigmoid kinetics did not appear to produce dissociation to subunits. 6. The changes in enzymic behavior produced by the action of urea or pH 10.2 are completely reversible. 7. The findings have been discussed in terms of the subunit structure of aspartate transcarbamylase. In general it would appear that in our hands these desensitizing treatments have produced a weakening of interaction between subunits rather than an actual separation into catalytic and regulatory subunits."

https://openalex.org/W1541175614,"Abstract The amination of xanthosine 5'-phosphate and its inhibition by psicofuranine was examined with substrate amounts of purified xanthosine 5'-phosphate aminase from Escherichia coli. In the absence of NH3, incubation of the enzyme with adenosine triphosphate-8-14C and XMP-8-14C for 10 min results in the conversion of ATP to AMP without concomitant formation of guanosine monophosphate. Shorter periods of incubation permit the accumulation of an electrophoretically distinct intermediate which contains radioactivity derived equally from ATP-8-14C and XMP-8-14C. The formation of the intermediate is accompanied by the formation of an equivalent amount of inorganic pyrophosphate. The intermediate is cleaved in the presence of NH3 to yield AMP and GMP or in the absence of NH3 to AMP and XMP. Psicofuranine does not inhibit the hydrolytic cleavage of the intermediate to AMP and XMP. In contrast, the psicofuranine-inhibited aminase cannot catalyze the aminolysis of the preformed intermediate to AMP and GMP, nor can it condense ATP and XMP to form the intermediate despite its undiminished ability to bind both of these substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1502907992,"Abstract Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase from Salmonella typhimurium is activated by basic compounds such as polylysine, protamine, histone, and spermidine. Ionic strength and pH of the assay medium are contributory factors for the activation of the enzyme by polylysine. Gradient centrifugation experiments show that polylysine binds with the enzyme. The polylysine-enzyme aggregate remains susceptible to the modulation of its activity by the allosteric effectors, aspartate (inhibitor) and fructose 1,6-diphosphate (activator). Various nonpolar solvents such as dioxane, 2-propanol, ethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide, and propylene glycol also activate the enzyme reversibly. In the presence of 10% dioxane but not the other solvents the enzyme gets desensitized to the effect of aspartate and fructose 1,6-di-P. This desensitization is a reversible process and does not seem to be due to a dissociation of the enzyme polymer into subunits. It is concluded that the enzyme possibly has accessible hydrophobic regions coupled with exposed areas with a preponderance of negatively charged groups. Long range electrostatic interactions or weakening of the hydrophobic bonds of the enzyme in its native configuration both lead to the activation of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1508919303,"Abstract An amino acid-incorporating system has been obtained from ungerminated wheat embryos. This system has very low endogenous activity, but phenylalanine incorporation can be stimulated by the addition of polyuridylic acid. The poly U-stimulated system is similar to those from other sources in that it requires ribosomal particles, supernatant fluid, soluble ribonucleic acid, adenosine triphosphate, guanosine triphosphate, a nucleoside triphosphate-regenerating system, and magnesium and potassium ions for maximal activity. Puromycin and ribonuclease cause considerable inhibition of phenylalanine incorporation while chloramphenicol has little effect. The polymerization of phenylalanine from phenylalanyl-soluble ribonucleic acid in the presence of polyuridylic acid requires ribosomes, Mg++, K+, GTP, its generating system, and a factor present in the supernatant fraction. This aminoacyl transfer factor from wheat embryos has been partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and DEAE-cellulose column chromatography. The specificity of the ribosomes for the supernatant factor in the transfer reaction was studied with ribosomes from Escherichia coli, guinea pig liver, wheat embryo, and tobacco leaf chloroplasts. The mammalian and wheat ribosomes could interchange their supernatant factors to give aminoacyl transfer but were not active with the E. coli factor. E. coli ribosomes could use only the homologous supernatant fraction. The tobacco leaf chloroplast ribosomes were tested with the wheat supernatant fluid and were found to be active."

https://openalex.org/W1678427291,"SUMMARY The action, on pepsinogen, of water-insoluble trypsin prepared by polymerization of the enzyme with maleic acid and ethylene was compared with that of trypsin. It was established that, whereas trypsin hydrolyzes 15 peptide bonds in pepsinogen, the maximum number of bonds cleaved by water-insoluble trypsin never exceeds 10. This result is independent of the ratio of carrier to enzyme. Furthermore, the same difference is observed if reduced carboxymethylated pepsinogen is used as substrate. If the chromatographically separated fractions of the two types of digests are compared by high voltage electrophoresis and chromatography, different peptide maps are obtained.

https://openalex.org/W2075096878,"Postmetamorphic diploid and triploid frogs that had earlier been joined in parabiotic union from embryonic life until metamorphosis were each found to be chimeric with respect to their blood cells, as revealed in chromosome preparations of cultured leucocytes. Blood cells precursorsmost likely were interchanged when the ex-parabionts shared a common circulation in embryonic life,and the exchanged precursor cells apparently homed in the hematopoietic tissues of the hosts. The tolerance which exparabiotic pairs of frogs exhibit toward grafts of each other's skin is attributable to the blood cell chimerism."

https://openalex.org/W4415142,"Abstract A new method for the chromatographic fractionation of soluble ribonucleic acid (sRNA) is described. A gradient of increasing salt and pH is employed to elute sRNA from diethylaminoethyl Sephadex. The resolution of sRNA species for 10 different amino acids obtained with this method is presented. There is evidence that resolution is dependent upon a change in sRNA from a partially denatured state at the beginning of elution to the native state at the end. The method, which has a large input capacity, provides good resolution of certain sRNA species. It is convenient to use and can be adapted for either preparative or analytical work."

https://openalex.org/W1599614067,"Abstract In separate experiments, involving chymotryptic and peptic digestion of the f2 coat protein, a sufficient number of overlap peptides were isolated to permit us to propose an unambiguous arrangement of the tryptic peptides in the intact coat protein. The assignment of linkages between tryptic peptides was made by comparing the amino acid compositions of chymotryptic and peptic peptides containing lysine and arginine with the compositions of the tryptic peptides. In some cases these assignments were confirmed by digesting the overlap peptides with trypsin and by end group determinations. The order proposed for the tryptic peptides is T11-T8-T4-T3-T7-T9-T5-T2-T10-T6-T1. Two chymotryptic peptides were isolated which were derived from the NH2-terminal region of the protein. The order and amino acid sequence of these peptides were determined, making it possible to establish the sequence of the first 7 residues from the NH2-terminal end of the protein. This sequence is: Ala-Ser-Asn-Phe-Thr-Gln-Phe."
https://openalex.org/W2067751643,"Studies in rabbits of skin grafts tagged with tritiated thymidine indicate a greater proliferation of endothelial cells and fibroblasts at the site of an allograft than at that of an autograft as early as the first day after grafting. It appears, therefore, that allogeneic differences can be recognized and responded to locally almost at once. Labeled nuclear material is found to be transferred from the epithelial cells of skin grafts to host cells of the adjacent tissues. A mechanism therefore exists which might effect a local transfer of information on histocompatibility differences."
https://openalex.org/W1506741912,"Abstract Horseradish peroxidase in the presence of hydrogen peroxide selectively inactivates the amino acid acceptor activity of certain Escherichia coli transfer ribonucleic acids. Lysine acceptor activity was inactivated to the largest extent by the peroxidase treatment. Acceptor activity for isoleucine, tyrosine, histidine, and alanine was also affected, but to a lesser extent. Amino acid acceptor activity of six other amino acids tested was unaffected. The acceptor activity of rat liver transfer ribonucleic acids for all amino acids tested was insensitive to the peroxidase treatment. The peroxidase treatment did not appear to inactivate the functional sites required for lysyl transfer from E. coli transfer ribonucleic acid into polypeptide linkages in the presence of polyadenylic acid and a bacterial ribosomal system. Ultra-violet irradiation, unlike peroxidase treatment, inactivated to different extents various amino acid acceptor activities of cytoplasmic soluble ribonucleic acids from either E. coli or rat liver."
