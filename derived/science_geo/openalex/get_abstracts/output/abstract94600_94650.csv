https://openalex.org/W2044443383,Rats subjected to unilateral ablation of the motor cortex and placed on a narrow beam displayed transient contralateral paresis. An immediate and enduring acceleration of recovery was produced by a single dose of d-amphetamine given 24 hours after injury. This effect was blocked by haloperidol or by restraining the animals for 8 hours beginning immediately after amphetamine administration. A single dose of haloperidol given 24 hours after injury markedly slowed recovery. This effect was also blocked by restraining the animals.

https://openalex.org/W2089146248,"A cavity was made in the brain (entorhinal cortex) of developing or adult rats, and a small piece of Gelfoam was emplaced to collect fluid secreted into the wound. The neuronotrophic activity of the fluid was assayed with sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons in culture. The results show that wounds in the brain of developing or adult rats stimulate the accumulation of neuronotrophic factors and that the activity of these factors increases over the first few days after infliction of the damage."
https://openalex.org/W2034796909,"One level of DNA organization in metaphase chromosomes is brought about by a scaffolding structure that is stabilized by metalloprotein interactions. Fast-sedimenting, histone-depleted structures (4000–7000 S), derived from metaphase chromosomes by extraction of the histones, are dissociated by metal chelators or by thiol reagents. The chromosomal (scaffolding) proteins responsible for constraining the DNA in this fast-sedimenting form are solubilized under the same conditions. Chromosomes isolated in a metal-depleted form, which generate slow-sedimenting, histone-depleted structures, can be specifically and reversibly stabilized by Cu2+, but not by Mn2+, Co2+, Zn2+ or Hg2+. Metal-depleted chromosomes can also be stabilized by Ca2+ (at 37°C), but this effect is less specific than that of Cu2+. The scaffolding protein pattern that is reproducibly generated following treatment with Cu2+ is composed primarily of two high molecular weight proteins—Sc1 and Sc2 (170,000 and 135,000 daltons). The identification of this simple protein pattern has depended upon the development of new chromosome isolation methods that are highly effective in eliminating cytoskeletal contamination."
https://openalex.org/W1976732266,"The small ribonucleoproteins recognized by anti-La autoantibodies contain a heterogeneous mixture of small RNAs from uninfected mammalian cells. The identity of many of these has now been established by the discovery of precursor forms of 5S rRNA and of certain tRNAs among La RNAs from HeLa cells. The small fraction of 5S rRNA molecules that exist as La ribonucleoproteins in vivo possess 1 or 2 additional U residues at their 3' ends. Such 5S molecules bound to the La protein have also been identified with in vitro nuclear transcription systems. Pulse-chase experiments performed both in vivo and in vitro support the idea that most newly synthesized 5S rRNA molecules are transiently associated with the La protein. Cell extracts contain a processing activity that converts longer in vitro-synthesized 5S RNA transcripts into molecules of mature size. The presence of in vivo tRNA precursors in the heterogeneous mixture of La RNAs is demonstrated by the identification of precursor forms of five different specific tRNAs (Meti, Asp, Gly, Glu, Asn). After in vitro transcription of a tRNA gene (tRNAiMet), only products the size of precursor molecules are precipitable by anti-La antibodies. The realization that virtually every known RNA polymerase III product associates at least initially with the La antigen suggests that this protein plays an essential role in the synthesis or maturation of all class III transcripts."
https://openalex.org/W2150073376,"The differentiation of 3T3-F442A preadipocytes is characterized by numerous enzymatic events and by a programmed change in cell morphology from a fibroblastic form to a nearly spherical shape. Accompanying this morphological change are large and specific decreases in biosynthetic rates for beta and gamma actin, vimentin and alpha and beta tubulin, as detected by one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. In cells undergoing adipose differentiation, actin synthesis decreases by 90%, while the decrease in tubulin synthesis is more than 95%. Translation in vitro of mRNA isolated from differentiating cultures indicates that the decreases in biosynthetic rate for cytoskeletal proteins result from altered levels of active mRNA. Using cloned cDNA probes for beta actin and alpha tubulin, we show that changes in mRNA activity correspond to a specific loss of these sequences during cellular differentiation. Quantitatively, this loss of tubulin and actin mRNA sequences accounts virtually completely for the changes in protein biosynthetic rates. Examination of the synthesis and accumulation of cytoskeletal proteins and of their temporal relation to morphological conversion indicates that the biosynthetic changes are very early events in the differentiation, and suggests strongly that they participate in the development of the adipocyte morphology. The early occurrence of decreased cytoskeletal-protein synthesis also suggests that subsequent biosynthetic events specific to adipocyte differentiation may be influenced by alterations in the cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W2025909669,"Mice will replace the tip of a foretoe when it is amputated distal to the last interphalangeal joint. Amputation of the digit more proximal to the joint does not result in regrowth of the foretoe. Though this growth shares certain similarities with the epimorphic regeneration of amphibian limbs, the two processes are not the same. The regrowth reported here in mice is probably similar to the scattered clinical reports of fingertips regeneration in children, and presents a model system with which to explore the controls of wound healing and tissue reconstruction in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W1564979110,"The ability of sterol carrier protein2 (SCP2) to mediate transfer of unesterified cholesterol from adrenal lipid inclusion droplets to mitochondria has been tested in an in vitro model system. Unlike mitochondrial utilization of cholesterol added in acetone or dimethyl sulfoxide, the unesterified cholesterol of lipid droplets did not provide a readily available source of substrate for mitochondrial pregnenolone production, without the addition of a transport mediator. Addition of SCP2, but not albumin, stimulated mitochondrial utilization of droplet cholesterol in a concentration-dependent manner. In the absence of mitochondria, SCP2 sequestered lipid droplet cholesterol, and in the presence of mitochondria, which were unable to convert cholesterol to pregnenolone, this cholesterol was quantitatively accumulated by mitochondria. Both processes were concentration-dependent and demonstrated a molar ratio of SCP2 and cholesterol for both binding and transport of 1. SCP2 also enhanced pregnenolone formation by mitochondria which were incubated in the absence of an extramitochondrial source of cholesterol. However, SCP2 had no effect on steroid release from a crude particulate fraction. These studies suggest that the effects of SCP2 are related to delivery of cholesterol from preformed stores to and into mitochondria for initiation of steroid hormone synthesis, and may represent an important modulator of sterol metabolism in adrenal cortical cells."

https://openalex.org/W1528238804,"Proteolytic susceptibility has been used to probe the structure of human erythrocyte spectrin. Nine unique polypeptide segments have been defined by mild trypsin digestion (0 degrees C) and analyzed by two-dimensional peptide mapping techniques. These peptide segments, referred to operationally as chemical domains, exhibited varying degrees of sensitivity to further proteolytic cleavage. One region (beta I) which contained the phosphorylated amino acids of the beta subunit was quite sensitive to proteolysis and was rapidly degraded to numerous small peptides. Overlap peptides produced by enzymatic and chemical cleavages were used to align each domain in the appropriate spectrin subunit. The molecular weights of the largest unique peptides from both subunits sum to the approximate weight of the intact molecule. Similarly, summation of the two-dimensional peptide maps of the intermediate sized peptides approximates the two-dimensional maps of the intact spectrin subunits, indicating that most or all of the molecule is represented. These results suggest that spectrin is composed of multiple, ordered, largely alpha-helical domains that are connected by small protease-sensitive segments. A comprehensive structural model is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1988072486,"During 4- to 8-day periods at sea, half of 2595 dives of three king penguins were more than 50 meters and two dives exceeded 240 meters. The at-sea metabolic rate, estimated from the turnover of tritiated water, was 2.8 times the standard metabolic rate and requires about 2.5 kilograms of squid per day. Ten percent or less of the dives may result in prey capture."
https://openalex.org/W2004696590,"We used gene transfer to identify frequent genetic rearrangements responsible for activating mutant genes in mammalian cells. We transformed an aprt− tk− cell with a plasmid containing a wild-type aprt gene and a truncated, promoterless tk gene. Transformants that integrate a single copy of this plasmid exhibit the aprt+ phenotype but remain tk−. Tk+ variants result from 20 to 50 fold amplification of the linked plasmid along with significant lengths of flanking DNA. They produce aberrant transcripts such that multiple genes are required to generate sufficient enzyme to convert the cell to the tk+ phenotype. One striking feature of the amplified aprt+ tk+ clones is the frequency (10−4) at which aprt− tk+ mutants appear. These phenotypic requirements are such that the tk gene must remain amplified while all the amplified aprt genes become inactivated. The structure of the amplified DNA indicates that within aprt− cells, all amplified units bear identical mutations. These data suggest that these cells possess an efficient correction mechanism that maintains sequence homogeneity among repeated genetic elements."
https://openalex.org/W1992590483,"Action potentials were silenced in one eye of neonatal kittens by repeated intraocular injections of tetrodotoxin for 5 to 8 weeks. After tetrodotoxin blockade was allowed to wear off, receptive field properties of individual relay cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus were examined. The many ON-OFF and binocular fields found in the layers that receive input from the treated eye suggest that these cells had extremely abnormal retino-geniculate synaptic connections. These effects were different in kind from those seen after deprivation rearing that does not silence action potentials. Lack of action potential activity was concluded to lead to abnormal development in the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2023226986,"Adenovirus E1A encodes a protein that facilitates the transcription of other early viral transcriptional units and is required for virus-induced transformation. To study the function of non-protein-coding DNA sequence at the 5′ end of this transcriptional unit, we constructed mutant viruses with deletions in this region. Deletion of sequence just upstream from the TATA homology does not affect the level or sequence of E1A mRNAs. Deletion of the TATA homology decreases the level of E1A mRNAs by a factor of 5–10 and shifts the mRNA 5′ ends from the major 5′ end found in wild-type transcripts to a set of minor ends found in wild-type E1A mRNAs. This suggests that the TATA homology is required for an efficient transcription initiation mechanism, and that in its absence a less efficient, less precise mechanism is unmasked. Analysis of mRNAs from other early regions establishes that E2 and E3 regions are most dependent on E1A functions for expression of maximal mRNA levels, E4 is less dependent and E1B is the least dependent. Deletion of the TATA homology, a sequence highly conserved among human adenoviruses, and the entire 5′ untranslated sequence of the E1A mRNAs decreases neither the rate of virus replication in a host in which E1A expression is required, nor the efficiency of transformation of rat embryo cells."

https://openalex.org/W1527697258,"Rat liver Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase, previously reported to be localized in the mitochondria intermembrane space in addition to the cytosol, is now found to be lysosomal. The enzyme has been shown to segregate coincidently with lysosomal enzymes and not mitochondrial enzymes from a subcellular granule fraction by three independent methods: 1) digitonin treatment, 2) hypotonic treatment, which selectively releases lysosomal enzymes into the supernatant prior to the release of mitochondrial enzymes, and 3) separation of mitochondria and lysosomes by isopycnic density centrifugation after in vivo loading of lysosomes with Triton WR-1339. The Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase in lysosomes appears to be derived from cytosolic Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase, since microinjection of the enzyme into HeLa cells results in a partial redistribution from cytosol to lysosomes. In the rat, the amount of superoxide dismutase in the lysosomes varies with the nutritional state of the animal. Fasted animals have about 8% and fed animals about 2% of the total cellular superoxide dismutase in the lysosomes. This increase in lysosomal Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase upon fasting is consistent with what is known to occur with other soluble cytosolic proteins during autophagy. Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase is probably not located in mitochondria, as the enzyme found associated with this organelle on isopycnic density gradients may be attributed to lysosomal contamination. However, the possibility that a small amount (less than 0.1% of total cellular) is located in the mitochondria cannot be excluded."

https://openalex.org/W1533372755,"Two independent experiments indicated that the major subcellular site of de novo dolichyl phosphate biosynthesis in rat liver is in the microsomes. First, when purified subcellular fractions were assayed for long chain prenyltransferase activity, the profile obtained indicated exclusively a microsomal localization. Second, when liver slices were incubated 60 min with [14C]acetate and subcellular fractions were subsequently isolated, the microsomal fraction was found to contain greater than two-thirds of the total radioactivity incorporated into dolichyl phosphate. Chemical analysis of dolichyl phosphate in subcellular fractions showed substantial quantities in both the microsomal and mitochondrial-lysosomal fractions. In contrast, dolichol was found primarily in the mitochondrial-lysosomal fraction. The absolute in vitro rate of hepatic dolichyl phosphate synthesis was determined in liver slices and isolated hepatocytes by [14C]acetate labeling using [3H] water incorporation into cholesterol to correct for the dilution of the labeled acetate by the endogenous acetyl-CoA pool. From this value, an in vivo rate of de novo synthesis was estimated as 1.7-2.6 nmol of dolichyl phosphate/liver/day. This rate is more than 30 times the maximum possible rate of accumulation in liver of dietary dolichol (Keller, R. K., Jehle, E., and Adair, W. L., Jr. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 8985-8989). From the previously determined concentration of dolichyl phosphate in rate liver (Keller, R. K. Tamkun, J. M., and Adair, W. L. (1981) Biochemistry 20, 5831-5836) and the de novo rate of synthesis, it appears that the half-life of hepatic dolichyl phosphate is on the order of days."

The amount of toxin bound to the receptors was determined and the kinetics of dissociation of the receptor-toxin complex was followed. Addition of an excess of horse antiserum to the venom resulted in a significant acceleration of the dissociation reaction. Similarly, a monoclonal antibody against the toxin accelerated dissociation of the receptor-toxin complex. The results indicate that specific antibody binding destabilizes the toxin-receptor complex."
https://openalex.org/W2053217000,"Fasting lowers blood pressure to a greater extent in spontaneously hypertensive rats than in normotensive rats. While fasting reduced cardiac sympathetic activity to an equivalent extent in both groups of animals, only in the hypertensive rats did fasting elicit an opiate-mediated vasodepressor response that was independent of sympathetic withdrawal. Both sympathetic nervous system suppression and endogenous opiate activation, therefore, may contribute to the hypotensive effect of fasting in the spontaneously hypertensive rat."
https://openalex.org/W1550600851,"The heterobifunctional photoaffinity probe N-(4-azidobenzoyl-[2-3H]glycyl)-S-(2-thiopyridyl)-cysteine was attached to cysteine 190 of alpha-tropomyosin to determine which component of rabbit skeletal troponin was in close proximity to cysteine 190. The troponin-tropomyosin complex was photolyzed in the presence and absence of Ca2+, and the radiolabeled troponin, (CM-Tn-AGC) was isolated by hydroxylapatite chromatography. CM-Tn-AGC was separated into its individual components of DEAE-Sephadex chromatography in 8 M urea, ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, and dithiothreitol. Radioactive measurements indicated that only troponin T (TnT) was radiolabeled. A limited 15-min chymotryptic digest of CM-Tn-AGC isolated from the CM-Tn-AGC-tropomyosin complex formed in the presence or absence of Ca2+ resulted in the isolation of T2-AGC (residues 156-259 of TnT) which bound to a tropomyosin-Sepharose affinity column. More proteolysis of CM-Tn-AGC allowed the isolation of T2'-AGC (residues 156-227). When the tropomyosin-troponin complex was photolyzed in the absence of Ca2+, as compared to the presence of Ca2+, there was a 1.7-fold increase in the cross-linking yield to troponin. This result suggests that there is a Ca2+-sensitive conformational change in the binding region of TnT around cysteine 190. A tightening of the complex around cysteine 190 in the absence of Ca2+ could explain the decrease in reaction of the arylnitrene with solvent. Proteolysis of T2 and sequence analysis of the radiolabeled peptides is now in progress."
https://openalex.org/W1557789825,"The amino acid sequence has been determined for polypeptide chain AIII of the major component of the hemoglobin (erythrocruorin) from the earthworm, Lumbricus terrestris. The chain has 157 residues and a molecular weight of 17,496. Although the extent of sequence identity with other globin chains is only 17-18%, analysis of the sequence leads to the conclusion that the secondary structure of the chain is very similar to those of vertebrate globins and that about 60-70% of the amino acid residues are in alpha helices. The D helix appears to be missing, as it is from the alpha chain of human hemoglobin and from the monomeric hemoglobin of Glycera dibranchiata, another annelid worm. This is the first sequence obtained from one of the giant extracellular hemoglobins of invertebrate animals."
https://openalex.org/W2048071404,"We followed the translocation of identifiable pigment granules in living erythrophores through normal aggregation and dispersion and observed that they always return in dispersion to the same location relative to the whole pigment complex. This is interpreted to mean that each granule occupies a fixed position within a unit structure, the cytoplast. This position is retained even though the cytoplast undergoes dramatic reversals in form from ellipsoid to spheroid and back again with each aggregation and dispersion. The major structural components of the cytoplast, besides pigment granules, are microtubules and microtrabeculae. The latter constitute an irregular lattice that is confluent with microtubules and contains the pigment granules. In aggregation, the microtrabeculae shorten and seemingly contribute to the contraction of the entire cytoplast plus pigment. In dispersion, the microtrabeculae elongate in an apparent restructuring of the ellipsoidal cytoplast. The microtubules, however, persist in the cell cortex and appear to give radial direction to the pigment motion."
https://openalex.org/W1499923826,"A subclone of Chinese hamster ovary cells, R40F, has been selected for its unusually high resistance to lethal concentrations of Cd and Zn. Although there is a 33% loss in Cd resistance when R40F cells are cultured in the absence of exogenous metals, the Zn resistance remains unaltered. These cells are 80% tetraploid and demonstrate an increased capacity for metallothionein protein synthesis. When compared to wild type cells cultured in the absence of exogenous metals, R40F cells exposed to 200 M Cd for 48 h exhibited an approximate 200-fold increase in metallothionein-I (MT-I) protein. A 32P-labeled mouse MT-I cDNA was employed in solution hybridization studies to measure the level of MT-I mRNA in wild type and R40F cells. Cd (0.5 M) induces MT-I mRNA about 2.5- and 5-fold in wild type and resistant Chinese hamster ovary cells, respectively. When optimally induced, the resistant cells have about 80-fold more MT-I mRNA than the sensitive cells. Southern blot analysis of HincII-cleaved DNA indicates that the MT-I gene is amplified approximately 60- to 75-fold in R40F cells."
https://openalex.org/W1521369602,"We have used low shear falling ball viscometry to measure the effects of actin purity, solution conditions, and cross-linking macromolecules on the formation of actin filament networks. Removal of minor contaminants from conventional muscle actin (Spudich, J. A., and Watt, S. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 4866-4871) by gel filtration (MacLean-Fletcher, S. and Pollard, T.D. (1980c) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 96, 18-27), greatly promotes the interaction of the filaments. Purified actin filaments form a gel (apparent viscosity greater than 12,000 cp) at approximately 2 mg/ml whereas approximately 12 mg/ml of conventional actin filaments have a viscosity of less than 400 cp. The apparent viscosity of the filaments depends on pH and the concentration of monovalent and divalent cations. The viscosity of purified action filaments is more sensitive to such variables when compared to that of conventional actin filaments. Together these experiments suggest that actin filament self-associations contribute to the stabilization of actin gels. A number of basic macromolecules, including aldolase, histones, lysozyme, polylysine, and RNase A can bind to and crosslink conventional actin filaments to form a gel. Since it is unlikely that all of these molecules are bound to actin in vivo, experimental approaches in addition to viscometry and sedimentation must be applied to prove that a given protein functions as an actin cross-linking protein in the cell."

The enzyme has been solubilized and purified 660-fold from rabbit liver microsomes (Jensen, J. W., and Schutzbach, J. S. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 12899-12904). Enzyme activity was reconstituted in the presence of specific phospholipids and evidence for the formation of an enzyme-phospholipid complex was obtained from kinetic studies, by the stabilization of the enzyme by phosphatidylethanolamine, and by co-sedimentation of the enzyme with phospholipid. Maximal activity was restored only when the enzyme was reconstituted in the presence of synthetic or naturally occurring phosphatidylethanolamine which contained unsaturated acyl chains. Investigation of the phospholipid specificity required for activation of the enzyme and results obtained with phospholipid vesicles of mixed composition suggest that the enzyme may have a requirement for phospholipids that can associate to form nonbilayer lipid structures in aqueous environments."

Conversion of components I and II to component III has been achieved by reduction in 10(-2) M dithiothreitol. Isoelectric focusing of lima bean lectin in the presence of 8 M urea and beta-mercaptoethanol revealed charge heterogeneity of the lectin subunits. Three major subunit classes of apparent pI 7.05, 6.65, and 6.45, designated alpha, beta, and alpha', respectively, were identified; they occur in a relative abundance of 2:5:3. Green lima beans harvested before maturity lacked the alpha' subunit (pI 6.45) which appears to accumulate during seed maturation. The three subunits are glycoproteins of identical size and immunochemical reactivity. Identical NH2-terminal sequences were found for the three subunits. Amino acid analysis and tryptic peptide mapping indicated that the observed charge heterogeneity is probably due to differences in the primary structure of the subunits. Studies of subunit composition of charge isolectins provided evidence of nonrandom subunit assembly. A model is proposed involving pairing of a pI 6.65 subunit with either a pI 7.06 or 6.45 subunit to form dimeric units. Possible roles for subunit heterogeneity and ordered subunit assembly in determining the metal and sugar binding properties of lima bean lectin are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1533115557,"5-Oxo-L-prolinase was isolated from rat kidney by a new procedure; highly active and apparently homogeneous enzyme was obtained in 50% yield after 1700-fold purification. The enzyme, which couples cleavage of ATP to ADP with that of 5-oxo-L-proline to L-glutamate, is uncoupled by Ca2+, Co2+, or excess Mn2+ as well as by replacement of adenosine 5'-triphosphate or of 5-oxo-L-proline by certain analogs as previously reported. The enzyme has Mr = 325,000 and is composed of 2 apparently identical subunits. It contains 27 sulfhydryl groups/monomer, 6 of which can be titrated in the native enzyme and 2 of which are required for catalysis. One of the sulfhydryl groups that can be titrated with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and N-ethylmaleimide can be protected against modification by ATP or inosine 5'-triphosphate. The findings suggest that at least 1 sulfhydryl group is at or close to the nucleoside triphosphate binding site and is involved in cleavage of NTP. 5'-p-Fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine and 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl inosine interact with the sulfhydryl group involved in NTPase activity and also with another amino acid residue of the enzyme. The data provide additional strong evidence that (a) the enzyme can bind 5-oxo-L-proline in the absence of NTP, and that it can bind NTP in the absence of 5-oxo-L-proline, and (b) the L-glutamate synthesis and NTP-cleaving activities are catalyzed by the same protein."

The lower phototoxicity of orally administered 5-methoxypsoralen as compared to 8-methoxypsoralen in the guinea pig appears to be due to its reduced concentrations in the epidermis, the primary site of the phototoxic events."

https://openalex.org/W1618472775,"DNA strand breaks produced by damaging agents such as x-ray generally stimulate poly(adenosine diphosphoribose) (ADP-R) synthesis in mammalian cells. DNA intercalating agents induce the formation of strand breaks which are unusual in that they are associated with tightly or covalently bound protein. In order to determine whether the intercalator-induced strand breaks are associated with poly-(ADP-R) synthesis, L1210 cells were treated with the intercalating agent, 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide. Poly(ADP-R) synthesis, measured by [3H]NAD incorporation following cell permeabilization, was enhanced in x-irradiated cells, but not in cells exposed to 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide at doses which produced equivalent strand breaks frequencies. The permeabilized cell system did not support DNA synthesis and x-ray-induced strand breaks did not reseal. The intercalator-induced strand breaks, however, resealed within 10 min. Hence, the strand breaks observed in intercalator-treated cells may not constitute DNA damage in the usual sense. The resealing of intercalator-induced DNA breaks in the absence of DNA or poly(ADP-R) synthesis is unique among chemical or physical agents which produce DNA scissions."

A comparison of individual segments of the RNA also shows that the structure of Phycomyces 5 S RNA has several major differences from structures common to the higher fungi. Positions 2-14 are homologous with those of metazoan and some protozoan 5 S RNAs. At positions 30-45, the RNA sequence is closer to metazoan 5 S RNAs than to the Neurospora of Aspergillus 5 S RNAs. The Phycomyces 5 S RNA shares similar sequences with both Aspergillus and Tetrahymena 5 S RNAs at positions 79-99. Several other important homologies in primary and proposed secondary structures also have been observed in comparing Phycomyces 5 S RNA with animal and plant 5 S RNAs.

Synchronized suspension cultures of HeLa cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine, and chromatin was prepared by mild micrococcal nuclease digestion. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, in addition to one-dimensional electrophoresis, was used to resolve the patterns of incorporation of radioactive label. Significant variations in non-histone synthesis were seen during the cell cycle. A strong correlation was not found between DNA synthesis in mid-S phase and variations in non-histone synthesis. The non-histone proteins of purified metaphase chromosomes were also characterized by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and compared to the proteins of interphase chromatin. The pattern of non-histones is not identical with that of interphase chromatin, although a number of major species may be shared by interphase chromatin and metaphase chromosomes. The HeLa nuclear scaffold, the framework that maintains the overall morphology of the interphase nucleus, shows relatively few proteins on two-dimensional gels. The synthesis of nuclear scaffold proteins was quantitated by excising each of 19 proteins from two-dimensional gels and determining the incorporated radioactivity by scintillation counting. Substantial variations in protein synthesis were found, with several species showing changes of about 2-fold in the percentage of incorporation."

https://openalex.org/W1544836336,"The stereospecificity of octopine dehydrogenase from crown gall tumor and of octopine dehydrogenase from scallops (Pecten maximum) with respect to the oxidation of C-4 of the dihydronicotinamide ring of NADH was investigated by determination of the distribution of radioactivity after oxidation of (4R)- and (4S)-[4-3H]NADH. Octopine dehydrogenase from crown gall tumor and from scallops stereospecifically removes the pro-S hydrogen atom of the dihydronicotinamide ring with transfer of label to the solvent and to the product octopine (N-2-(1-carboxyethyl)-L-arginine). Although to a lesser extent, the exchange of label from (4S)-[4-3H]NADH with solvent was found to occur when octopine dehydrogenase from either crown gall tumor or from scallops was incubated in the absence of other substrates. Possible mechanisms to explain this exchange are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2005587834,"An extensive computer-assisted analysis of known pre-proinsulin coding sequences has shown correlations that can be interpreted as evidence for an intron-mediated juxtaposition of exons in the evolution of these genes. The evidence includes the discovery that the regions of the pre-proinsulin genes that code for the signal peptide consist of nearly tandem repeating units of nine base pairs. This pattern reappears in the C region of the genes after a large intron that occurs in three of the four genes analyzed. A model is proposed in which primordial insulin was coded for by two separate minigenes arising from a gene duplication, each with identical or nearly identical signal peptide coding regions. The minigenes fused into one transcriptional unit mediated by the large intron, and the signal peptide coding region of one of the putative minigenes evolved into the latter portion of the C peptide coding region."
https://openalex.org/W2133823901,"A glycosylated form of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease, ribonuclease B, has been crystallized in a form suitable for three-dimensional x-ray structure determination. Crystals grown from polyethylene glycol solutions display high resolution diffraction patterns indicating the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) with a = 59.2 (+/- 0.1), b = 56.0 (+/- 0.1), and c = 81.0 (+/- 0.2). A, V = 2.7 x 10(5) A3. With 8 molecules/unit cell Vm = 2.28 A3/dalton. The systemically weak intensity of all reflections with their l indices odd suggests the likely alignment of a noncrystallographic 2-fold axis near the crystal c axis."
