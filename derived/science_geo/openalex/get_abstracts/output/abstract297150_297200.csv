Similar etch features can be produced if these minerals are treated in the laboratory with concentrated hydrofluoric acid plus hydrochloric acid. These pits most likely form at dislocation outcrops, and their shape and orientation are controlled primarily by the crystallography of the underlying mineral. The results are similar to those found for soil feldspars and suggest that silicate weathering, in general, takes place by selective etching and not by general attack of the surface with consequent rounding as necessiated by bulk diffusion-type weathering theories."
https://openalex.org/W2084205358,The detritivorous cichlid Sarotherodon mossambicus grows rapidly on a low-protein diet by assimilating detrital nonprotein amino acids. Differences in the quantity of detrital amino acids in different lakes may account for the variable success of S. mossambicus introductions around the world.

The phenolic acids apparently were derived from phenolic ethers in the polymer, which in turn probably were formed from carbon monoxide and hydrogen by catalytic Fischer-Tropsch type reactions in the solar nebula. In contrast, terrestrial polymers such as lignin, humic acid, and coal yield mainly para-hydroxy (4-hydroxy) benzene derivatives by the same oxidation procedure."
https://openalex.org/W2145192001,"Dinosaur tracks from Lower Jurassic rocks at Rocky Hill, Connecticut, were apparently made by a floating or half-submerged animal that was pushing along the bottom with the tips of its toes. These tracks were probably made by large carnivorous dinosaurs (Theropoda) and are apparently the first evidence of swimming by such animals."
https://openalex.org/W2007867038,"Membrane electrodes fabricated from yttria-stabilized zirconia, a representative oxygen ion-conducting ceramic, show a linear voltage response to pH over the range 3 to 8 at 285 degrees C and a pressure of 1200 pounds per square inch (82 atmospheres). Test units have been operated continuously at 285 degrees C without failure for periods as long as 9 days. Unlike sensors which are based on electron transfer couples, such membrane electrodes are insensitive to changes in the oxidation-reduction environment and, in turn, exert no influence upon the environment. Such ceramic membranes can therefore be used for the direct measurement of the pH of geothermal brines, of water in nuclear reactors, and in high-temperature thermodynamic studies on aqueous systems."
https://openalex.org/W2082192259,"During Deep Sea Drilling Project-International Program of Ocean Drilling leg 64, December 1978 to January 1979, the initial test of the Deep Sea Drilling Project's hydraulic piston corer obtained an almost undisturbed section from a 152-meter hole into the sediments of the oxygen minimum zone at a depth of 655 meters along the Guaymas slope in the central Gulf of California. The section records variations in climate, productivity, and circulation for more than 250,000 years of Late Pleistocene to Holocene history with recordings of seasonal variations in these parameters in the laminated sections."
https://openalex.org/W2021262785,"Aftershocks of the 29 November 1978 Oaxaca, Mexico, earthquake (surface-wave magnitude Ms = 7.8) define a rupture area of about 6000 square kilometers along the boundary of the Cocos sea-plate subduction. This area had not ruptured in a large (Ms >/= 7), shallow earthquake since the years 1928 and 1931 and had been designated a seismic ""gap."" The region has also been seismically quiet for small to moderate (M >/= 4), shallow (depth </= 60 kilometers) earthquakes since 1966; this quiet zone became about six times larger in 1973. A major earthquake (Ms = 7.5 +/- 0.25) was forecast at this location on the basis of the quiescence that began in 1973. The aftershock data indicate that an area approximately equivalent in size to the seismic gap has now broken."

https://openalex.org/W1817702242,"In October 1978, the independent National Commission on Research began to review the problems of the government-university research relationship and to recommend improvements. The central issue of difficulty in this relationship is accountability. The public wants to be assured that the best research is produced and that public moneys are not wasted. The government wants to attain
its program objectives and fulfill its stewardship
responsibilities. The universities want to conduct research well, avoid diversion of resources to meet unnecessary
administrative requirements, and protect. the integrity of their operations. Both the universities and the government
seek to maintain public confidence in their activities."
