https://openalex.org/W2730912563,"Extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) strains are important pathogens that cause diverse diseases in humans and poultry. Some E. coli isolates from chicken feces contain ExPEC-associated virulence genes, so appear potentially pathogenic; they conceivably could be transmitted to humans through handling and/or consumption of contaminated meat. However, the actual extraintestinal virulence potential of chicken-source fecal E. coli is poorly understood. Here, we assessed whether fecal E. coli isolates from healthy production chickens could cause diseases in a chicken model of avian colibacillosis and three rodent models of ExPEC-associated human infections. From 304 E. coli isolates from chicken fecal samples, 175 E. coli isolates were screened by PCR for virulence genes associated with human-source ExPEC or avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC), an ExPEC subset that causes extraintestinal infections in poultry. Selected isolates genetically identified as ExPEC and non-ExPEC isolates were assessed in vitro for virulence-associated phenotypes, and in vivo for disease-causing ability in animal models of colibacillosis, sepsis, meningitis, and urinary tract infection. Among the study isolates, 13% (40/304) were identified as ExPEC; the majority of these were classified as APEC and uropathogenic E. coli, but none as neonatal meningitis E. coli. Multiple chicken-source fecal ExPEC isolates resembled avian and human clinical ExPEC isolates in causing one or more ExPEC-associated illnesses in experimental animal infection models. Additionally, some isolates that were classified as non-ExPEC were able to cause ExPEC-associated illnesses in animal models, and thus future studies are needed to elucidate their mechanisms of virulence. These findings show that E. coli isolates from chicken feces contain ExPEC-associated genes, exhibit ExPEC-associated in vitro phenotypes, and can cause ExPEC-associated infections in animal models, and thus may pose a health threat to poultry and consumers."

This study aims at analyzing population-based data of parents with MHP and their children and the effects of associated risk factors in order to further targeted preventive and therapeutic interventions. Methods The BELLA study is the mental health module of the German National Health Interview and Examination Survey among Children and Adolescents. MHP in parents and in their children as well as associated risk factors were examined in a sample of N = 1158 parents with children aged 11 to 17 years. Results Parental MHP were identified in 18.6% of the sample. Risk factors associated with parental MHP were low SES, parental unemployment, stressful life events, parental daily strain, parental chronic disease, and child MHP. A rate of 19.1% of the children of parents with MHP reported MHP themselves, the corresponding rate among children of parents without MHP was 7.7%. In multiple regression analyses the risk for children of parents with MHP to report MHP themselves was almost two times higher than the risk of children of parents without MHP. Other significant associations with child MHP included gender, the parents’ age, and stressful life events. Conclusions Parental MHP constitute a significant risk for the mental health of their children. Targeted screening methods and preventive interventions are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2728374893,"Ultrasound imaging is increasingly used with motion and force data to quantify tendon dynamics during human movement. Frequently, tendon dynamics are estimated indirectly from muscle fascicle kinematics (by subtracting muscle from muscle-tendon unit length), but there is mounting evidence that this Indirect approach yields implausible tendon work loops. Since tendons are passive viscoelastic structures, when they undergo a loading-unloading cycle they must exhibit a negative work loop (i.e., perform net negative work). However, prior studies using this Indirect approach report large positive work loops, often estimating that tendons return 2–5 J of elastic energy for every 1 J of energy stored. More direct ultrasound estimates of tendon kinematics have emerged that quantify tendon elongations by tracking either the muscle-tendon junction or localized tendon tissue. However, it is unclear if these yield more plausible estimates of tendon dynamics. Our objective was to compute tendon work loops and hysteresis losses using these two Direct tendon kinematics estimates during human walking. We found that Direct estimates generally resulted in negative work loops, with average tendon hysteresis losses of 2–11% at 1.25 m/s and 33–49% at 0.75 m/s (N = 8), alluding to 0.51–0.98 J of tendon energy returned for every 1 J stored. We interpret this finding to suggest that Direct approaches provide more plausible estimates than the Indirect approach, and may be preferable for understanding tendon energy storage and return. However, the Direct approaches did exhibit speed-dependent trends that are not consistent with isolated, in vitro tendon hysteresis losses of about 5–10%. These trends suggest that Direct estimates also contain some level of error, albeit much smaller than Indirect estimates. Overall, this study serves to highlight the complexity and difficulty of estimating tendon dynamics non-invasively, and the care that must be taken to interpret biological function from current ultrasound-based estimates."
https://openalex.org/W2727037715,"Patterns of linkage between the ε4 allele of Apolipoprotein E (APOE) and '523 poly-T alleles in the adjacent gene, TOMM40, differ between Caucasian and African Americans. The extent to which this difference affects the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is unclear. We compared the APOE ε4-TOMM40 '523 haplotypes between older Caucasian and African Americans, and examined their relationship with AD dementia. Data came from three community based cohort studies of diverse participants. APOE genotypes were determined by polymorphisms of rs429358 and rs7412. TOMM40 '523 genotypes were defined by the poly-T repeat length of rs10524523 (short ['523-S]: poly-T ≤ 19, long ['523-L]: 20 ≤ poly-T ≤ 29, and very long ['523-VL]: poly-T ≥ 30). Cox proportional hazards models examined the effect of haplotype variation on the risk of incident AD dementia. A total of 1,848 Caucasian and 540 African American individuals were included in the study. In Caucasians, nearly none (0.8%) of the non-ε4 carriers and almost all (94.2%) of the ε4 carriers had '523-L. The classification was highly concordant. Each ε4 allele doubled the risk for AD dementia and the dose effect was evident. Almost identical effect size and effect pattern were observed for TOMM40 '523-L. In African Americans, nearly none (1.1%) of the non-ε4 carriers had '523-L, but only 47.8% of the ε4 carriers had '523-L. The concordance was weaker compared with Caucasians. The effect patterns on incident AD dementia differed distinctively between ε4 and '523-L carriers. Further, both genotypic and allelic data support that among African Americans the ε4-'523-L haplotype had stronger effect on risk of AD dementia than other ε4-'523 haplotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2726027680,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of severe bacterial infections globally. A full understanding of the impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) on pneumococcal disease burden, following its introduction in 2009 in South Africa, can support national policy on PCV use and assist with policy decisions elsewhere.We developed a model to estimate the national burden of severe pneumococcal disease, i.e. disease requiring hospitalisation, pre- (2005-2008) and post-PCV introduction (2012-2013) in children aged 0-59 months in South Africa. We estimated case numbers for invasive pneumococcal disease using data from the national laboratory-based surveillance, adjusted for specimen-taking practices. We estimated non-bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia case numbers using vaccine probe study data. To estimate pneumococcal deaths, we applied observed case fatality ratios to estimated case numbers. Estimates were stratified by HIV status to account for the impact of PCV and HIV-related interventions. We assessed how different assumptions affected estimates using a sensitivity analysis. Bootstrapping created confidence intervals.In the pre-vaccine era, a total of approximately 107,600 (95% confidence interval [CI] 83,000-140,000) cases of severe hospitalised pneumococcal disease were estimated to have occurred annually. Following PCV introduction and the improvement in HIV interventions, 41,800 (95% CI 28,000-50,000) severe pneumococcal disease cases were estimated in 2012-2013, a rate reduction of 1,277 cases per 100,000 child-years. Approximately 5000 (95% CI 3000-6000) pneumococcal-related annual deaths were estimated in the pre-vaccine period and 1,900 (95% CI 1000-2500) in 2012-2013, a mortality rate difference of 61 per 100,000 child-years.While a large number of hospitalisations and deaths due to pneumococcal disease still occur among children 0-59 months in South Africa, we found a large reduction in this estimate that is temporally associated with PCV introduction. In HIV-infected individuals the scale-up of other interventions, such as improvements in HIV care, may have also contributed to the declines in pneumococcal burden."
https://openalex.org/W2726984919,"Introduction Breastfeeding is recommended exclusively for the first 6 months after birth, with continued breastfeeding for at least 2 years. Yet prevalence of these recommendations is low globally, although it is an effective and cost-effective way to prevent serious infections and chronic illness. Previous studies have reported that social support greatly influences breastfeeding, but there is little evidence on perceived social norms in Mexico and how they affect actual behavior. Objective Our objective was to investigate breastfeeding intention, practices, attitudes, and beliefs, particularly normative, among low-resource communities in central and southern Mexico. Methods We performed a secondary analysis using the theory of planned behavior with cross-sectional data, which included semi-structured individual interviews with fathers (n 10), 8 focus groups with mothers (n 50), and 8 focus groups with women community leaders (n 44) with a total of 104 participants. Our data also included a quantitative survey among pregnant women and mothers (n 321). Results Women reported supplementing breast milk with water and teas soon after birth, as well as introducing small bites of solid food a few months after birth. Social norms appeared to support breastfeeding, but not exclusive breastfeeding or breastfeeding for periods longer than about a year. This may be partially explained by: a) behavioral beliefs that for the first 6 months breast milk alone is insufficient for the baby, and that water in addition to breast milk is necessary to hydrate an infant and b) normative beliefs related to the appropriateness of breastfeeding in public and as the child gets older. Conclusions Future strategies should focus on positively influencing social norms to support recommended practices, and emphasize the specific reasons behind the recommendations. Future efforts should take a multi-pronged approach using a variety of influences, not only directed at healthcare providers but close family members, including fathers."
https://openalex.org/W2728832596,"Background Malaria remains a major public health issue in most southern African countries as the disease remains hyper endemic. Burkina Faso continues to face challenges in the treatment of malaria, as the utilization of preventive measures remains low on a national scale. While it has been acknowledged that understanding women’s health-seeking behaviours, perception of malaria and its preventive measures will aid in the control of malaria, there is paucity of information on Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices among women in the reproductive age of 15–49 years in Burkina Faso. This study investigated women’s knowledge of malaria, attitudes towards malaria, and practices of malaria control in order to create a synergy between community efforts and governmental/non-governmental malaria control interventions in Burkina Faso. Methods The analysis used data from the 2014 Burkina Faso Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS). In total 8111 women aged between 15–49 years were included in the present study. We assessed women’s knowledge about 1) preventive measures, 2) causes and 3) symptoms of malaria, as well as malaria prevention practices for their children and during pregnancy. The socio-demographic characteristics were considered for Age, Religion, Education, Wealth index, Number of household members, Sex of household head, Household possession of radio, TV and Received antenatal care. Data were analyzed using STATA, version 14. Associations between variables were tested using a Chi-square and logistic regression, with the level of statistical significance set at 95%. Results A preponderant proportion of respondents were aged 15–29 years (mean age was 28.63±9.41). About three-quarters of the respondents had no formal education. An estimated two-third of the participants were of Islamic faith, while access to media and behavioural communication were generally poor. The level of knowledge was 53% for rural women and 68.2% for urban dwellers. In sum, there was 56.1% level of accurate knowledge of malaria among women in Burkina Faso. In the multivariable logistic regression, women in rural location had 40% reduction in the odds of having accurate knowledge of malaria when compared to urban women (aOR = 0.60; 95%CI: 0.52–0.68). The educational level was a key factor in the knowledge of malaria. The odds of having accurate knowledge of malaria increased as the educational level increased, hence, women with secondary and higher education had 29% and 93% increase in the odds of having accurate knowledge of malaria when compared to the women without formal education. Results indicate that antenatal care (ANC) services were major sources of information on malaria. Women who reportedly received ANC were 3.9 times more likely to have accurate knowledge of malaria when compared to those who did not utilize skilled ANC services (aOR = 3.90; 95%CI = 3.34–4.56). Conclusion The overall knowledge of malaria prevention practices among a large proportion of women was found to be low, which implies that the knowledge about the prevention of malaria should be improved upon by both urban and rural dwellers. There is need for concerted behavioural communication intervention to improve the knowledge of malaria especially for rural dwellers regarding malaria prevention measures, causes and symptoms. Consistent efforts at providing relevant information by health organizations are needed to reduce and control incidences of malaria in the general public."
https://openalex.org/W2724286931,"Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) can adversely affect human health. Emissions from residential energy sources have the largest impact on premature mortality globally, but their pathological and molecular implications on cellular physiology are still elusive. In the present study potential molecular consequences were investigated during long-term exposure of human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells to PM2.5, collected from a biomass power plant. Initially, we observed that PM2.5 did not affect cellular survival or proliferation. However, it triggered an activation of the stress response p38 MAPK which, along with RhoA GTPase and HSP27, mediated morphological changes in BEAS-2B cells, including actin cytoskeletal rearrangements and paracellular gap formation. The p38 inhibitor SB203580 prevented phosphorylation of HSP27 and ameliorated morphological changes. During an intermediate phase of long-term exposure, PM2.5 triggered proliferative regression and activation of an adaptive stress response necessary to maintain energy homeostasis, including AMPK, repression of translational elongation, and autophagy. Finally, accumulation of intracellular PM2.5 promoted lysosomal destabilization and cell death, which was dependent on lysosomal hydrolases and p38 MAPK, but not on the inflammasome and pyroptosis. TEM images revealed formation of protrusions and cellular internalization of PM2.5, induction of autophagosomes, amphisomes, autophagosome-lysosomal fusion, multiple compartmental fusion, lysosomal burst, swollen mitochondria and finally necrosis. In consequence, persistent exposure to PM2.5 may impair epithelial barriers and reduce regenerative capacity. Hence, our results contribute to a better understanding of PM-associated lung and systemic diseases on the basis of molecular events."
https://openalex.org/W2730279430,"Lung sarcomatoid carcinoma of the lung is a rare tumor with a poor prognosis. More than 90% of them are pleomorphic, spindle cell and giant cell carcinoma (PSCGCC). This rare subtype of lung cancer is thought to be more resistant to chemotherapy, and a small subset of them seems to exhibit targetable mutations. Immunotherapy against PD1/PDL-1 is a new emerging treatment, and might be of interest in PSGSCC because they frequently express PD-L1. The aim of our work is to evaluate PD1 and PDL-1 expression in a surgical series of lung PSCGCC and their relationship with morphological and immunohistochemical parameters and prognosis. Thirty-six patients who underwent surgical resection of a PSGSCC were included. PD-L1 (E1L3N) expression on tumor cells and PD1 (NAT105) expression by tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were performed by immunohistochemistry. Results were compared to immunohistochemistry tests of TTF1, Napsin A, p40 and to molecular study of EGFR, KRAS, BRAF and HER2. Seventy-five % of PSCGCC were considered as positive for PD-L1.PD-L1 expression in PSGSCC is associated with TTF-1 and/or Napsin A expression (47.2%, p = 0.039). Few p40 positive PSCGCC expressed PD-L1 (8.3%, p = 0.013). PD1 expression was not related to TTF-1 and/or Napsin A expression (p = 0.47), p40 expression (p = 0.68) or survival (p = 0.14). PD-L1 or PD1 expression were not related to the age, gender, pT, pN, stage, visceral pleura invasion, histopathological subtype, the presence of giant cell component, the predominance of sarcomatoid component, and the presence of EGFR or BRAF or HER2 or PIK3CA mutation (p>0.05). PD-L1 expression was correlated with a worse overall survival in PSCGCC (p = 0.045). PD-L1 expression is frequent in PSCGCC and might be associated with the expression of adenocarcinoma markers (TTF-1, Napsin A) or the lack of expression of squamous cell carcinoma marker (p40)."
https://openalex.org/W2731744912,"Background Various noninvasive liver reserve markers were proposed to indicate the severity of liver damage. However, the role and feasibility of these markers to predict the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are unknown. We aimed to identify the prognostic role of the 8 currently used hepatic reserve markers in patients with HCC undergoing transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). Methods Between 2002 and 2013, a total of 881 patients with HCC undergoing TACE were prospectively identified and retrospectively analyzed. The baseline characteristics, tumor status and noninvasive markers were collected. Homogeneity and corrected Akaike information criteria (AICc) were compared between these markers. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify independent predictors of survival. Results Significant differences in survival distribution were found for albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade, Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class, Lok index, fibrosis index based on 4 factors (FIB-4), Göteborg University cirrhosis index (GUCI), cirrhosis discriminant index (CDI) and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score (all p values <0.05). Among these markers, the ALBI grade showed the highest homogeneity and lowest AICc value, indicating a better prognostic performance. Cox multivariate analysis confirmed that ALBI grade 2, ascites, serum alkaline phosphatase and α-fetoprotein level, tumor diameter, vascular invasion and performance status were significant independent prognostic predictors. The distribution of the ALBI score well correlated with baseline CTP and MLED scores. Conclusions Our data suggest that among the currently used liver reserve markers, ALBI grade may serve as an objective and feasible surrogate to predict the prognosis of HCC patients undergoing TACE."
https://openalex.org/W2731607811,"To determine which of four Dixon image types [in-phase (IP), out-of-phase (OP), fat only (FO) and water-only (WO)] is most sensitive for detecting multiple myeloma (MM) focal lesions on whole body MRI (WB-MRI) images.Thirty patients with clinically-suspected MM underwent WB-MRI at 3 Tesla. Unenhanced IP, OP, FO and WO Dixon images were generated and read by four radiologists. On each image type, each radiologist identified and labelled all visible myeloma lesions in the bony pelvis. Each identified lesion was compared with a reference standard consisting of pre- and post-contrast Dixon and diffusion weighted imaging (read by a further consultant radiologist) to determine whether the lesion was truly positive. Lesion count, true positives, sensitivity, and positive predictive value were compared across the four Dixon image types.Lesion count, true positives, sensitivity and confidence scores were all significantly higher on FO images than on IP images (p>0.05).FO images are more sensitive than other Dixon image types for MM focal lesions, and should be preferentially read by radiologists to improve diagnostic accuracy and reporting efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2732112562,"Myelin formation has been identified as a modulator of neural plasticity. New tools are required to investigate the mechanisms by which environmental inputs and neural activity regulate myelination patterns. In this study, we demonstrate a microfluidic compartmentalized culture system with integrated electrical stimulation capabilities that can induce neural activity by whole cell and focal stimulation. A set of electric field simulations was performed to confirm spatial restriction of the electrical input in the compartmentalized culture system. We further demonstrate that electrode localization is a key consideration for generating uniform the stimulation of neuron and oligodendrocytes within the compartments. Using three configurations of the electrodes we tested the effects of subcellular activation of neural activity on distal axon myelination with oligodendrocytes. We further investigated if oligodendrocytes have to be exposed to the electrical field to induce axon myelination. An isolated stimulation of cell bodies and proximal axons had the same effect as an isolated stimulation of distal axons co-cultured with oligodendrocytes, and the two modes had a non-different result than whole cell stimulation. Our platform enabled the demonstration that electrical stimulation enhances oligodendrocyte maturation and myelin formation independent of the input localization and oligodendrocyte exposure to the electrical field."
https://openalex.org/W2733937431,"Interleukins-6 (IL-6)/GP130 signaling pathway represents a promising target for cancer therapy due to its critical role in survival and progression of multiple types of cancer. We have identified Bazedoxifene, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug used for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis, with novel function as inhibitor of IL-6/GP130 interaction. In this study, we investigate the effect of Bazedoxifene in rhabdomyosarcoma and evaluate whether inhibiting IL-6/GP130 signaling is an effective therapeutic strategy for rhabdomyosarcoma. The inhibitory effect of Bazedoxifene was assessed in rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines in vitro and RH30 xenograft model was used to further examine the suppressive efficacy of Bazedoxifene on tumor growth in vivo. Rhabdomyosarcoma cells showed their sensitivity to GP130 inhibition using gene knockdown or neutralized antibody, suggesting IL-6/GP130 as therapeutic target in rhabdomyosarcoma cells. Bazedoxifene decreased the signal transducer and activator of transcription3 (STAT3) phosphorylation, blocked STAT3 DNA binding, and down-regulated the expression of STAT3 downstream genes. Bazedoxifene also induced cell apoptosis, reduced cell viability, and inhibited colony formation in rhabdomyosarcoma cells. The inhibition of colony formation, STAT3 phosphorylation, or cell viability following Bazedoxifene treatment was partially reversed by addition of excess IL-6 or overexpression of constitutive STAT3, respectively, supporting Bazedoxifene acted through IL-6/GP130 signaling. In addition, Bazedoxifene repressed cell invasion and angiogenesis in vitro. Furthermore, oral administration of Bazedoxifene significantly suppressed tumor growth and expression of STAT3 phosphorylation in nude mice bearing established human rhabdomyosarcoma xenograft. Taken together, these findings validate IL-6/GP130 signaling as therapeutic target in rhabdomyosarcoma and provide first evidence that Bazedoxifene may serve as a novel promising drug targeting IL-6/GP130 for treatment of rhabdomyosarcoma."
https://openalex.org/W2733031983,"Impairment of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) of the auditory nerve is a major cause for hearing loss occurring independently or in addition to sensory hair cell damage. Unfortunately, mammalian SGNs lack the potential for autonomous regeneration. Stem cell based therapy is a promising approach for auditory nerve regeneration, but proper integration of exogenous cells into the auditory circuit remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we present novel nanofibrous scaffolds designed to guide the integration of human stem cell-derived neurons in the internal auditory meatus (IAM), the foramen allowing passage of the spiral ganglion to the auditory brainstem. Human embryonic stem cells (hESC) were differentiated into neural precursor cells (NPCs) and seeded onto aligned nanofiber mats. The NPCs terminally differentiated into glutamatergic neurons with high efficiency, and neurite projections aligned with nanofibers in vitro. Scaffolds were assembled by seeding GFP-labeled NPCs on nanofibers integrated in a polymer sheath. Biocompatibility and functionality of the NPC-seeded scaffolds were evaluated in vivo in deafened guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus). To this end, we established an ouabain-based deafening procedure that depleted an average 72% of SGNs from apex to base of the cochleae and caused profound hearing loss. Further, we developed a surgical procedure to implant seeded scaffolds directly into the guinea pig IAM. No evidence of an inflammatory response was observed, but post-surgery tissue repair appeared to be facilitated by infiltrating Schwann cells. While NPC survival was found to be poor, both subjects implanted with NPC-seeded and cell-free control scaffolds showed partial recovery of electrically-evoked auditory brainstem thresholds. Thus, while future studies must address cell survival, nanofibrous scaffolds pose a promising strategy for auditory nerve regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2733134475,"Theories of anxiety disorders and phobias have ascribed a critical role to avoidance behavior in explaining the persistence of fear and anxiety, but knowledge about the role of avoidance behavior in the maintenance of anxiety in social anxiety disorder relative to specific phobia is lacking. This study examined the extent to which avoidance behavior moderates the relationship between general anxiety at baseline and 18 months later in women with a diagnosed social anxiety disorder (n = 91) and women with a diagnosed specific phobia (n = 130) at baseline. Circumscribed avoidance of social and specific situations were clinician-rated using the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule-Lifetime (ADIS-IV-L), and general anxiety was measured using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Moderated regression analyses revealed that (a) general anxiety at baseline predicted general anxiety at follow-up in both women with a specific phobia and women with a social anxiety disorder and (b) avoidance behavior moderated this relationship in women with a specific phobia but not in women with a social anxiety disorder. Specifically, high avoidance behavior was found to amplify the effect between general anxiety at baseline and follow-up in specific phobia. Reasons for the absence of a similar moderating effect of avoidance behavior within social anxiety disorder are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2731913689,"Whole genome or exome sequencing is increasingly used in the clinical contexts, and ‘incidental’ findings are generated. There is need for an adequate policy for the reporting of these findings to individuals. Such a policy has been suggested by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). We argue that ACMG’s policy is overly paternalistic, and that an adequate policy must take into account population preferences. We conducted a choice based conjoint survey of population preferences for reporting in a representative sample of the Danish population. In a 12 task survey respondents were asked about their preference for reporting in relation to three scenarios with seven different attributes. Of 1200 respondents 66.4% participated. We show that population preferences for reporting differs from ACMG’s recommendations, and suggest a new policy based on both medically and patient actionable genes."
https://openalex.org/W2952343320,"An increasing number of single cell transcriptome and epigenome technologies, including single cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq), have been recently developed as powerful tools to analyze the features of many individual cells simultaneously. However, the methods and software were designed for one certain data type and only for single cell transcriptome data. A systematic approach for epigenome data and multiple types of transcriptome data is needed to control data quality and to perform cell-to-cell heterogeneity analysis on these ultra-high-dimensional transcriptome and epigenome datasets. Here we developed Dr.seq2, a Quality Control (QC) and analysis pipeline for multiple types of single cell transcriptome and epigenome data, including scATAC-seq and Drop-ChIP data. Application of this pipeline provides four groups of QC measurements and different analyses, including cell heterogeneity analysis. Dr.seq2 produced reliable results on published single cell transcriptome and epigenome datasets.

Juega en tu Barrio (JETB; Play in your Neighborhood) was designed and implemented to explore the effectiveness of closing a street in a low-to-middle income neighborhood in order to increase children's outside play and physical activity.A pretest-posttest design with control group was employed to investigate the intervention effects in a subsample of 100 children, 51 from the intervention neighborhood and 49 from the control neighborhood. The children wore pedometers for one week, and their parents completed questionnaires at two time points: before the intervention began and during the last two weeks of the intervention. JETB was conducted in the intervention neighborhood from 17:30 to 20:30, twice a week, from September to December 2014. Stewards ensured that the children were safe. Children and adults were assessed using systematic observation.The intervention and control neighborhoods included 177 and 116 children respectively. The average attendance per event was 60 children (SD = 22, reach 34%). In the intervention neighborhood, a significant increase between baseline and final assessment was observed in after-school outdoor playtime (p = 0.02), steps during the 3-hour intervention (p = 0.004), and daily steps Monday to Sunday (p = 0.006). Meanwhile, no changes were observed in the control neighborhood for the same variables. The proportion of children who met recommended daily step counts increased from 27.5% to 53.0% in the intervention neighborhood (p = 0.007), while for control neighborhood no difference was observed (49.0% to 53.0% p = 0.804).JETB showed high community engagement while offering opportunities for increased outdoor play in children.

https://openalex.org/W2727197206,"Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have an increased mortality rate that is associated with the presence of RA-specific autoantibodies in many studies. However, the relative role of rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-CCP antibodies and the most recently established RA-autoantibodies, directed against carbamylated proteins (anti-CarP antibodies), is unclear. Here, we have assessed the role of these three antibodies in 331 patients with established RA recruited from 2001 to 2009 and followed until November 2015. During this time, 124 patients died (37.5%). This death rate corresponds to a mortality rate 1.53 (95% CI 1.26 to 1.80) folds the observed in the reference population. We used for analysis of all-cause mortality the Cox proportional hazard regression model with adjustment for age, sex and smoking. It showed a trend for association with increased mortality of each of the three RA autoantibodies in antibody-specific analysis (hazards ratio (HR) from 1.37 to 1.79), but only the HR of the anti-CarP antibodies was significant (HR = 1.79, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.61, p = 0.002). In addition, the multivariate analysis that included all autoantibodies showed a marked decrease in the HR of RF and of anti-CCP antibodies, whereas the HR of anti-CarP remained significant. This increase was specific of respiratory system causes of death (HR = 3.19, 95% CI 1.52 to 6.69, p = 0.002). Therefore, our results suggest a specific relation of anti-CarP antibodies with the increased mortality in RA, and drive attention to their possible connection with respiratory diseases."

This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between metabolism and water diffusivity in hepatic tumors using a simultaneous positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) system with F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and to reveal the metabolic and diffusional characteristics of each type of hepatic tumor.Forty-one patients (mean age 63 ± 13 years, 31 male) with hepatic tumors (18 hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC], six cholangiocarcinoma [CCC], 10 metastatic tumors, one neuroendocrine malignancy, and six benign lesions) underwent FDG PET/MRI before treatment. Maximum standard uptake (SUVmax) values from FDG PET and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) from the diffusion-weighted images were obtained for the tumor and their relationships were examined. We also investigated the difference in SUVmax and ADC for each type of tumor.SUVmax showed a negative correlation with ADC (r = -0.404, p = 0.009). The median of SUVmax was 3.22 in HCC, 6.99 in CCC, 6.30 in metastatic tumors, and 1.82 in benign lesions. The median of ADC was 1.039 × 10-3 mm/s2 in HCC, 1.148 × 10-3 mm/s2 in CCC, 0.876 × 10-3 mm/s2 in metastatic tumors, and 1.323 × 10-3 mm/s2 in benign lesions. SUVmax was higher in metastatic tumors than in benign lesions (p = 0.023). Metastatic tumors had a lower ADC than CCC (p = 0.039) and benign lesions (p = 0.004). HCC had a lower ADC than benign lesions, with a suggestive trend (p = 0.06).Our results indicate that SUVmax is negatively correlated with ADC in hepatic tumors, and each group of tumors has different metabolic and water diffusivity characteristics. Evaluation of hepatic tumors by PET/MRI could be helpful in understanding tumor characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W2725718811,"Background The health visitors’ role in many countries is changing. In Scotland, the role has undergone substantial changes through the introduction of an enhanced health visiting programme, which includes increased, structured home visits. This evaluation was conducted within NHS Ayrshire and Arran, one of the 14 Scottish Health Boards. Our aim was to understand and explain how, and why, the programme could contribute to improving health and wellbeing outcomes for children and families. Methods We used a realist evaluation approach, conducted in three phases. In phase one, eight managerial staff involved in developing and implementing the programme provided data, which were used to develop initial programme theories. In phase two, the programme theories were tested using qualitative data from 25 health visitors and 22 parents. The programme theories were refined through analyses and interpretation of data in phase three. Results The home visiting context provided by the programme interacted with the mechanisms of the programme and produced outcomes such as early identification of health and wellbeing issues amongst families who needed more support, leading to referral and engagement with sources of additional help. The home visits facilitated development of parent-health visitor relationships, and parents considered health visitors as their first point of contact on children’s wellbeing and developmental-related issues. Moreover, the programme provided more clarity to health visitors’ role, which in turn enhanced partnership working. However, there were aspects of the programme that may require further development. For instance, both parents and health visitors were concerned about the wide gaps between some home visits. Conclusions The enhanced health visiting programme increased opportunities for monitoring and early identification of health and wellbeing concerns. It created structures for a more efficient partnership working and ensured that the needs of children and families were supported. These benefits need to be evaluated further in an effectiveness study."
https://openalex.org/W2731342333,"Activation of the angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R) by administration of Compound 21 (C21), a selective AT2R agonist, induces neuroprotection in models of ischemic stroke in young adult animals. The mechanisms of this neuroprotective action are varied, and may include direct and indirect effects of AT2R activation. Our objectives were to assess the long-term protective effects of post-stroke C21 treatments in a clinically-relevant model of stroke in aged rats and to characterize the cellular localization of AT2Rs in the mouse brain of transgenic reporter mice following stroke. Intraperitoneal injections of C21 (0.03mg/kg) after ischemic stroke induced by transient monofilament middle cerebral artery occlusion resulted in protective effects that were sustained for up to at least 3-weeks post-stroke. These included improved neurological function across multiple assessments and a significant reduction in infarct volume as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. We also found AT2R expression to be on neurons, not astrocytes or microglia, in normal female and male mouse brains. Stroke did not induce altered cellular localization of AT2R when assessed at 7 and 14 days post-stroke. These findings demonstrate that the neuroprotection previously characterized only during earlier time points using stroke models in young animals is sustained long-term in aged rats, implying even greater clinical relevance for the study of AT2R agonists for the acute treatment of ischemic stroke in human disease. Further, it appears that this sustained neuroprotection is likely due to a mix of both direct and indirect effects stemming from selective activation of AT2Rs on neurons or other cells besides astrocytes and microglia."
https://openalex.org/W2727262120,"Harbours with limited water exchange are hotspots of contaminant accumulation. Antifouling paints (AF) contribute to this accumulation by leaching biocides that may affect non-target species. In several leisure boat harbours and reference areas in the Baltic Sea, chronic exposure effects were evaluated using caging experiments with the snail Theodoxus fluviatilis. We analysed variations in ecologically relevant endpoints (mortality, growth and reproduction) in concert with variation in metallothionein-like proteins (MTLP) levels. The latter is a biomarker of exposure to metals, such as copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn), which are used in AF paints as active ingredient and stabilizer, respectively. In addition, environmental samples (water, sediment) were analysed for metal (Cu and Zn) and nutrient (total phosphorous and nitrogen) concentrations. All life-history endpoints were negatively affected by the exposure, with higher mortality, reduced growth and lower fecundity in the harbours compared to the reference sites. Metal concentrations were the key explanatory variables for all observed adverse effects, suggesting that metal-driven toxicity, which is likely to stem from AF paints, is a source of anthropogenic stress for biota in the harbours."
https://openalex.org/W2728875483,"Pancreatic islet transplantation has been considered for many years a promising therapy for beta-cell replacement in patients with type-1 diabetes despite that long-term clinical results are not as satisfactory. This fact points to the necessity of designing strategies to improve and accelerate islets engraftment, paying special attention to events assuring their revascularization. Fibroblasts constitute a cell population that collaborates on tissue homeostasis, keeping the equilibrium between production and degradation of structural components as well as maintaining the required amount of survival factors. Our group has developed a model for subcutaneous islet transplantation using a plasma-based scaffold containing fibroblasts as accessory cells that allowed achieving glycemic control in diabetic mice. Transplanted tissue engraftment is critical during the first days after transplantation, thus we have gone in depth into the graft-supporting role of fibroblasts during the first ten days after islet transplantation. All mice transplanted with islets embedded in the plasma-based scaffold reversed hyperglycemia, although long-term glycemic control was maintained only in the group transplanted with the fibroblasts-containing scaffold. By gene expression analysis and histology examination during the first days we could conclude that these differences might be explained by overexpression of genes involved in vessel development as well as in β-cell regeneration that were detected when fibroblasts were present in the graft. Furthermore, fibroblasts presence correlated with a faster graft re-vascularization, a higher insulin-positive area and a lower cell death. Therefore, this work underlines the importance of fibroblasts as accessory cells in islet transplantation, and suggests its possible use in other graft-supporting strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2724598087,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and subsequent DA depletion in the striatum. Microglia activation and nigral iron accumulation play important roles in the pathogenesis of PD. Activated microglia show increased iron deposits. However, the relationship between microglia activation and iron accumulation remains unclear. In the present study, we aimed to determine how iron levels affect interleukin-6 (IL-6) synthesis, and the effect of IL-6 on cellular iron metabolism in BV2 microglial cells.IL-6 mRNA was up-regulated after FAC treatment for 12 h in BV2 cells. Iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1) and divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) were up-regulated and iron exporter ferroportin 1 (FPN1) was down-regulated in BV2 cells after 24 h of IL-6 treatment. Phosphorylated JNK increased significantly compared to the control after BV2 cells were treated with IL-6 for 1 h. Pretreatment with SP600125 attenuated the up-regulation of IRP1 and DMT1 and down-regulation of FPN1 (compared to IL-6-treated group). These results suggest that iron load could increase IL-6 mRNA expression in BV2 cells. Further, IL-6 likely up-regulates IRP1 and DMT1 expression and down-regulates FPN1 expression in BV2 microglial cells through JNK signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2725061545,"A patient’s recovery from lung inflammatory injury or development of multi-system organ failure is determined by the host’s ability to resolve inflammation and repair tissue damage, both of which require the clearance of apoptotic neutrophils by macrophages (efferocytosis). Here, we investigated the effects of isoflurane on macrophage efferocytosis and resolution of lung inflammatory injury. Treatment of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) or alveolar macrophages with isoflurane dramatically enhanced phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils. Isoflurane significantly increased the surface expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase Mer in macrophages, but markedly decreased the levels of a soluble form of Mer protein in the medium. Isoflurane treatment also caused a decrease in a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17) on the cell surface and a concomitant increase in its cytoplasmic fraction. These responses induced by isoflurane were completely reversed by a pharmacological inhibitor or genetic deletion of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). In a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide-induced lung injury, isoflurane accelerated the recovery of lung inflammation and injury that was coupled with an increase in the number of alveolar macrophages containing apoptotic bodies. In alveolar macrophage-depleted mice, administration of isoflurane-pretreated BMDMs facilitated resolution of lung inflammation following lipopolysaccharide challenge. Thus, isoflurane promoted resolution of lipopolysaccharide-induced lung inflammatory injury via enhancement of macrophage efferocytosis. Increased macrophage efferocytosis following isoflurane treatment correlates with upregulation of Mer surface expression through AMPK-mediated blockade of ADAM17 trafficking to the cell membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2727428206,"We investigated categorical perception of rising and falling pitch contours by tonal and non-tonal listeners. Specifically, we determined minimum durations needed to perceive both contours and compared to those of production, how stimuli duration affects their perception, whether there is an intrinsic F0 effect, and how first language background, duration, directions of pitch and vowel quality interact with each other. Continua of fundamental frequency on different vowels with 9 duration values were created for identification and discrimination tasks. Less time is generally needed to effectively perceive a pitch direction than to produce it. Overall, tonal listeners’ perception is more categorical than non-tonal listeners. Stimuli duration plays a critical role for both groups, but tonal listeners showed a stronger duration effect, and may benefit more from the extra time in longer stimuli for context-coding, consistent with the multistore model of categorical perception. Within a certain range of semitones, tonal listeners also required shorter stimulus duration to perceive pitch direction changes than non-tonal listeners. Finally, vowel quality plays a limited role and only interacts with duration in perceiving falling pitch directions. These findings further our understanding on models of categorical perception, the relationship between speech perception and production, and the interaction between the perception of tones and vowel quality."
https://openalex.org/W2726560649,"Four Arcobacter species have been associated with human disease, and based on current knowledge, these Gram negative bacteria are considered as potential food and waterborne zoonotic pathogens. At present, only the genome of the species Arcobacter butzleri has been analysed, and still little is known about their physiology and genetics. The species Arcobacter thereius has first been isolated from tissue of aborted piglets, duck and pig faeces, and recently from stool of human patients with enteritis. In the present study, the complete genome and analysis of the A. thereius type strain LMG24486T, as well as the comparative genome analysis with 8 other A. thereius strains are presented. Genome analysis revealed metabolic pathways for the utilization of amino acids, which represent the main source of energy, together with the presence of genes encoding for respiration-associated and chemotaxis proteins. Comparative genome analysis with the A. butzleri type strain RM4018 revealed a large correlation, though also unique features. Furthermore, in silico DDH and ANI based analysis of the nine A. thereius strains disclosed clustering into two closely related genotypes. No discriminatory differences in genome content nor phenotypic behaviour were detected, though recently the species Arcobacter porcinus was proposed to encompass part of the formerly identified Arcobacter thereius strains. The report of the presence of virulence associated genes in A. thereius, the presence of antibiotic resistance genes, verified by in vitro susceptibility testing, as well as other pathogenic related relevant features, support the classification of A. thereius as an emerging pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2734167284,"Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) has been suggested as a therapeutic target for cardiac ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. Until now, the molecular mechanism of BAY 60–2770, a sGC activator, in cardiac IR injury has not been assessed. To identify the cardioprotective effects of BAY 60–2770 in IR-injured rat hearts, IR injury was established by occlusion of LAD for 40 min and reperfusion for 7 days, and the effects of BAY 60–2770 on myocardial protection were assessed by echocardiography and TTC staining. 5 nM and 5 μM of BAY 60–2770 were perfused into isolated rat hearts in a Langendorff system. After 10- or 30-min reperfusion with BAY 60–2770, cGMP and cAMP concentrations and PKG activation status were examined. Hearts were also perfused with 1 μM KT5823 or 100 μM 5-HD in conjunction with 5 nM Bay 60–2770 to evaluate the protective role of PKG. Mitochondrial oxidative stress was investigated under hypoxia-reoxygenation in H9c2 cells. In IR-injured rat hearts, BAY 60–2770 oral administration reduced infarct size by TTC staining and improved left ventricular function by echocardiography. Tissue samples from BAY 60-2770-perfused hearts had approximately two-fold higher cGMP levels. BAY 60–2770 increased PKG activity in the myocardium, and the reduced infarct area by BAY 60–2770 was abrogated by KT-5823 in isolated myocardium. In H9c2 cardiac myoblasts, hypoxia-reoxygenation-mediated mitochondrial ROS generation was diminished with BAY 60–2770 treatment, but was recovered by pretreatment with KT-5823. BAY 60–2770 demonstrated a protective effect against cardiac IR injury via mitoKATP opening and decreased mitoROS by PKG activation. BAY 60–2770 has a protective effect against cardiac IR injury via mitoKATP opening and decreased mitoROS by PKG activation. These results demonstrated that BAY 60–2770 may be used as a therapeutic agent for cardiac IR injury."
https://openalex.org/W2733328012,"Altered c-Src activity has been strongly implicated in the development, growth, progression, and metastasis of human cancers including prostate cancer. Src is known to regulate several biological functions of tumor cells, including proliferation. There are several Src inhibitors under evaluation for clinical effectiveness but have shown little activity in monotherapy trials of solid tumors. Combination studies are being explored by in vitro analysis and in clinical trials. Here we investigate the effect of simultaneous inhibition of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and Src on androgen receptor (AR) signaling in prostate cancer cells. AhR has also been reported to interact with the Src signaling pathway during prostate development. c-Src protein kinase is associated with the AhR complex in the cytosol and upon ligand binding to AhR, c-Src is activated and released from the complex. AhR has also been shown to regulate AR signaling which remains functionally important in the development and progression of prostate cancer. We provide evidence that co-inhibition of AhR and Src abolish AR activity. Evaluation of total protein and cellular fractions revealed decreased pAR expression and AR nuclear localization. Assays utilizing an androgen responsive element (ARE) and qRT-PCR analysis of AR genes revealed decreased AR promoter activity and transcriptional activity in the presence of both AhR and Src inhibitors. Furthermore, co-inhibition of AhR and Src reduced the growth of prostate cancer cells compared to individual treatments. Several studies have revealed that AhR and Src individually inhibit cellular proliferation. However, this study is the first to suggest simultaneous inhibition of AhR and Src to inhibit AR signaling and prostate cancer cell growth."

We compared the hyperoxia-induced proliferative retinopathy (HIPR) model in two mouse strains (C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N). Pups were exposed to 75% oxygen, starting at birth and continuing for 14 days (P14). Mice were euthanized at P14, or allowed to recover in room air for one day (P15), seven days (P21), or 14 days (P28). We quantified retinal thickness and the length of residual photoreceptors not affected by rosette formation. In addition we explored differences in retinal immunostaining for NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), Rac1, vascular endothelium, and activated Mϋller cells. We analyzed photoreceptor oxidative stress using DCF staining in cross sections and quantified NOX4 protein levels using western blotting. C57BL/6N mice in HIPR showed increased oxidative stress, NOX4, and Rac1 in the photoreceptors at P14 and P15 compared to C57BL/6J. In addition, we observed significant progression of photoreceptor degeneration, with significantly accelerated rosette formation in C57BL/6N under HIPR, compared to their room air counterparts. Furthermore, C57BL/6N under HIPR had significantly thinner central retinas than C57BL/6J in HIPR. We did not find a difference in vascular disruption or Mϋller cell activation comparing the two strains in hyperoxia. In HIPR, the C57BL/6N strain carrying the rd8 mutation showed significantly accelerated photoreceptor degeneration, mediated via exacerbated photoreceptor oxidative stress, which we believe relates to Rac1-NOX dysregulation in the setting of Crb1 loss-of-function."
https://openalex.org/W2733832810,"Antiangiogenic therapy for cancer is a strategy targeted at tumour vasculature, often in combination with conventional cytotoxicity treatments. Animal testing is still the most common method used for evaluating the efficacy of new drugs but tissue-engineered in vitro models are becoming more acceptable for replacing and reducing the use of animals in anti-cancer drug screening. In this study, a 3D co-culture model of human endothelial cells and ovarian cancer cells was developed. This model has the potential to mimic the interactions between endothelial cells and ovarian cancer cells. The feasibility of applying this model in drug testing was explored here. The complex morphology of the co-culture system, which features development of both endothelial tubule-like structures and tumour structures, was analysed quantitatively by an image analysis method. The co-culture morphology integrity was maintained for 10 days and the potential of the model for anti-cancer drug testing was evaluated using Paclitaxel and Cisplatin, two common anti-tumour drugs with different mechanisms of action. Both traditional cell viability assays and quantitative morphological analyses were applied in the drug testing. Cisplatin proved a good example showing the advantages of morphological analysis of the co-culture model when compared with mono-culture of endothelial cells, which did not reveal an inhibitory effect of Cisplatin on the tubule-like endothelial structures. Thus, the tubule areas of the co-culture reflected the anti-angiogenesis potential of Cisplatin. In summary, in vitro cancer models can be developed using a tissue engineering approach to more closely mimic the characteristics of tumours in vivo. Combined with the image analysis technique, this developed 3D co-culture angiogenesis model will provide more reproducible and reliably quantified results and reveal further information of the drug's effects on both tumour cell growth and tumour angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2729441464,"Changes in barrier function of the gastrointestinal tract are thought to contribute to the inflammatory bowel diseases Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Previous work in our lab demonstrated that apical exposure of intestinal epithelial cell lines to serine proteases results in an increase in transepithelial electrical resistance (TER). However, the underlying mechanisms governing this response are unclear. We aimed to determine the requirement for proteolytic activity, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation, and downstream intracellular signaling in initiating and maintaining enhanced barrier function following protease treatment using a canine intestinal epithelial cell line (SCBN). We also examined the role of phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain on the serine protease-induced increase in TER through. It was found that proteolytic activity of the serine proteases trypsin and matriptase is required to initiate and maintain the protease-mediated increase in TER. We also show that MMP-independent EGFR activation is essential to the sustained phase of the protease response, and that Src kinases may mediate EGFR transactivation. PI3-K and ERK1/2 signaling were important in reaching a maximal increase in TER following protease stimulation; however, their upstream activators are yet to be determined. CK2 inhibition prevented the increase in TER induced by serine proteases. The bradykinin B(2) receptor was not involved in the change in TER in response to serine proteases, and no change in phosphorylation of MLC was observed after trypsin or matriptase treatment. Taken together, our data show a requirement for ongoing proteolytic activity, EGFR transactivation, as well as downstream PI3-K, ERK1/2, and CK2 signaling in protease-mediated barrier enhancement of intestinal epithelial cells. The pathways mediating enhanced barrier function by proteases may be novel therapeutic targets for intestinal disorders characterized by disrupted epithelial barrier function."
https://openalex.org/W2729820836,"Excess estrogen exposure of avian embryos perturbs reproductive organ development in both sexes and demasculinizes the reproductive behaviors of adult males. We have previously shown that these characteristic effects on the reproductive organs also can be induced by exposure of Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) embryos to selective agonists of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα). In contrast, the male copulatory behavior is only weakly affected by developmental exposure to an ERα agonist. To further elucidate the respective roles of ERα and ERβ in estrogen-induced disruption of sexual differentiation, we exposed Japanese quail embryos in ovo to the selective ERα agonist 16α-lactone-estradiol (16αLE2), the selective ERβ agonist WAY-200070, or both substances in combination. The ERα agonist feminized the testes in male embryos and reduced cloacal gland size in adult males. Furthermore, anomalous retention and malformations of the Müllerian ducts/oviducts were seen in embryos and juveniles of both sexes. The ERβ agonist did not induce any of these effects and did not influence the action of the ERα agonist. Male copulatory behavior was not affected by embryonic exposure to either the ERα- or the ERβ-selective agonist but was slightly suppressed by treatment with the two compounds combined. Our results suggest that the reproductive organs become sexually differentiated consequent to activation of ERα by endogenous estrogens; excessive activation of ERα, but not ERβ, during embryonic development may disrupt this process. Our results also suggest that the demasculinizing effect of estrogens on male copulatory behavior is only partly mediated by ERα and ERβ, and may rather involve other estrogen-responsive pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2725654910,"Organ shortage leads to an increased utilization of marginal organs which are particularly sensitive to storage-associated damage. Cold incubation and rewarming-induced injury is iron-dependent in many cell types. In addition, a chloride-dependent component of injury has been described. This work examines the injury induced by cold incubation and rewarming in isolated rat renal proximal tubules. The tissue storage solution TiProtec® and a chloride-poor modification, each with and without iron chelators, were used for cold incubation. Incubation was performed 4°C for up to 168 h, followed by rewarming in an extracellular buffer (3 h at 37°C). After 48, 120 and 168 h of cold incubation LDH release was lower in solutions containing iron chelators. After rewarming, injury increased especially after cold incubation in chelator-free solutions. Without addition of iron chelators LDH release showed a tendency to be higher in chloride-poor solutions. Following rewarming after 48 h of cold incubation lipid peroxidation was significantly decreased and metabolic activity was tendentially better in tubules incubated with iron chelators. Morphological alterations included mitochondrial swelling and fragmentation being partially reversible during rewarming. ATP content was better preserved in chloride-rich solutions. During rewarming, there was a further decline of ATP content in the so far best conditions and minor alterations under the other conditions, while oxygen consumption was not significantly different compared to non-stored control tubules. Results show an iron-dependent component of preservation injury during cold incubation and rewarming in rat proximal renal tubules and reveal a benefit of chloride for the maintenance of tubular energy state during cold incubation."

We also selected patients who revealed granuloma in liver biopsy and with no Q fever diagnosis within the last 3 years as control. Acute Q fever hepatitis was diagnosed if two or more of the following clinical, serologic, or histopathologic criteria were met: (1) an infectious hepatitis-like clinical feature such as fever (≥ 38°C) with elevated hepatic transaminase levels; (2) exhibition of a phase II immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies titer by IFA of ≥ 1:128 in single determination, or a four-fold or greater rise between two separate samples obtained two or more weeks apart; (3) histologic finding of biopsy tissue showing characteristic fibrin ring granuloma.A total of 11 patients with acute Q fever hepatitis were selected and analyzed. Of the 11 patients, 3 (27%) had exposure to zoonotic risk factors and 7 (63%) met the serologic criteria. Granulomas with either circumferential or radiating fibrin deposition were observed in 10 cases on liver biopsy and in 1 case on bone marrow biopsy. 8 (73%) revealed positive Coxiella burnetii PCR from their formalin-fixed liver tissues. In contrast, none of 10 patients with alternative diagnosis who had hepatic granuloma revealed positive C. burnetii PCR from their formalin-fixed liver tissues.Q fever PCR from formalin-fixed liver tissues appears to be a useful adjunct for diagnosing Q fever hepatitis."

Patients who cooperated with optical correction and aggressive patching of the sound eye and who had a minimum postoperative follow-up of more than 2 years were included. Risk factors for poor visual outcomes were analyzed.Of the 105 eligible patients (181 eyes), 76 had bilateral cataract, and 29 unilateral. With a mean follow up of 46.77 mo (range 24.0~96.0 mo), the final best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 158 eyes were recorded, and 4.43% (7/158) achieved 0.1 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) or better; 15.19% (24/158) obtained a BCVA between 0.1 logMAR and 0.3 logMAR; 18.99%, (30/158) between 0.3 logMAR and 0.5 logMAR; 46.84% (74/158), between 0.5 logMAR and 1 logMAR; 14.55%, worse than 1 logMAR. The mean BCVA of the patients who underwent lensectomy before 3 months of age was significantly better than that of patients who underwent lensectomy between 3 and 12 months (p = 0.001). In the same lensectomy age groups, the final BCVA of the children in the bilateral and unilateral groups did not differ significantly (P>0.05). Lensectomy after 3 months of age, postoperative complications, strabismus and nystagmus were shown to be risk factors for poor visual outcomes.Lensectomy before 3 months of age, IOL implantation, proper managing of postoperative complications, early optical correction and aggressive postoperative patching of the sound eye would increase the final BCVA for patients with dense pediatric cataract."
https://openalex.org/W2733217911,"The induction efficiency of maize embryonic callus is highly dependent on the genotype, and only a few lines possess a high capacity for callus formation. Although certain genes and pathways have been reported to contribute to the regulation of callus induction, to the best of our knowledge, the functions of the small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) involved in this process remain unknown. In this study, we identified 861 differentially expressed siRNAs and 576 target genes in the callus induction process. These target genes were classified into 3 clusters, and their functions involve controlling metalloexopeptidase activity, catalase activity, transcription regulation, and O-methyltransferase activity. In addition, certain genes related to auxin transport and stem cell or meristem development (e.g., PLT5-like, ARF15, SAUR-like, FAS1-like, Fea3, SCL5, and Zmwox2A) were regulated by the differentially expressed siRNAs. Moreover, zma-siR004119-2 directly cleaves the 5’ UTR of Homeobox-transcription factor 25, which further leads to the down-regulation of its expression. Twelve 24-nt-siRNAs led to the hyper-methylation of GRMZM2G013465, which further decreases its expression. These results suggest that differentially expressed siRNAs regulate callus formation by controlling the expression of their target genes."

In this case-control study, we assessed whether there is evidence of either systemic activation or inhibition of the complement system in patients with chronic CSC.A prospective case-control study of 76 typical chronic CSC patients and 29 controls without ophthalmological history was conducted. Complement activity assays (classical, alternative, and mannose-binding lectin pathway), complement factors 3, 4, 4A, 4B, B, D, H, I, and P, activation products C3d, C5a, and sC5b-C9, and the C3d/C3 ratio were analysed in either serum or plasma. A correction for possible effects of gender, age, body mass index, and smoking status was performed.In this study, none of the tested variables, including regulation and activation products, proved to be significantly different between the groups. Moreover, no associations with either CSC disease activity or possible CSC related steroid use were observed.Despite the available literature regarding a possible relationship between chronic CSC and variants in genes involved in the complement system, we did not find evidence of an association of chronic CSC with either systemic complement activation or inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2727119066,"Ten reference genes were investigated for normalization of gene expression data in the shell gland of laying hens. Analyses performed with geNorm revealed that hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1) and hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS) were the two most stable reference genes in response to post-oviposition time alone (POT) or with nicarbazin treatment (POT+N) of laying hens. NormFinder analyses showed that the two most stable reference genes in response to POT and POT+N were 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA), ribosomal protein L4 (RPL4) and HMBS, RPL4, respectively. BestKeeper analyses showed that 18S rRNA, RPL4 and HPRT1, HMBS were the two most stable reference genes for POT, and POT+N, respectively. Of the ten reference genes, all except B2M showed geNorm M <0.5, suggesting that they were stably expressed in the shell gland tissue. Consensus from these three programs suggested HPRT1 and HMBS could be used as the two most stable reference genes in the present study. Expression analyses of four candidate target genes with the two most and the two least stable genes showed that a combination of stable reference genes leads to more discriminable quantification of expression levels of target genes, while the least stable genes failed to do so. Therefore, HMBS and HPRT1 are recommended as the two most stable reference genes for the normalization of gene expression data at different stages of eggshell formation in brown-egg laying hens. Available statistical programs for reference gene ranking should include more robust analysis capability to analyse the gene expression data generated from factorial design experiments."

A variety of studies have shown that FceRI densities vary 100 fold among subjects’ basophils and it has been speculated that high densities might be responsible for unusual behaviors of the cells, notably sensitivity to certain monomeric IgE antibodies or spontaneous release. These studies experimentally examined the density dependence of spontaneous release and signaling element expression in subjects’ basophils with FceRI densities ranging from approximately 6000 to 600,000 per cell. Through the use of numerical simulation, this study examined the expectations for spontaneous receptor aggregation and aggregate persistence at densities of FceRI ranging from 5000 to 500,000. Experimentally, FceRI density was not associated with greater spontaneous histamine release even when secretion was enhanced by the inclusion of deuterium oxide in the buffers. There was also no association of 15 activating or de-activating signaling elements with FceRI density. The numerical simulations demonstrated that at densities of ≈500,000 receptors, 13% of receptors were involved in transient aggregates at any given moment but that these aggregates rarely persisted for greater than 10 milliseconds. In contrast, a weak linear antigen aggregator, with ligand affinities known to induce secretion, would generate aggregates persisting for an average of ≈60 milliseconds. These results suggest that although a high density of FceRI likely produces a large number of transient aggregates, these aggregates do not persist long enough to induce signaling that results in secretion and do not induce the cells to alter their expression of several signaling elements known to be important in regulating secretion from human basophils. The results set some boundaries on the aggregation requirements for inducing histamine release from human basophils."
https://openalex.org/W2733283125,"How do speakers choose between structural options for expressing a given meaning? Overall preference for some structures over others as well as prior statistical association between specific verbs and sentence structures (“verb bias”) are known to broadly influence language use. However, the effects of prior statistical experience on the planning and execution of utterances and the mechanisms that facilitate structural choice for verbs with different biases have not been fully explored. In this study, we manipulated verb bias for English double-object (DO) and prepositional-object (PO) dative structures: some verbs appeared solely in the DO structure (DO-only), others solely in PO (PO-only) and yet others equally in both (Equi). Structural choices during subsequent free-choice sentence production revealed the expected dispreference for DO overall but critically also a reliable linear trend in DO production that was consistent with verb bias (DO-only > Equi > PO-only). Going beyond the general verb bias effect, three results suggested that Equi verbs, which were associated equally with the two structures, engendered verb-specific competition and required additional resources for choosing the dispreferred DO structure. First, DO production with Equi verbs but not the other verbs correlated with participants’ inhibition ability. Second, utterance duration prior to the choice of a DO structure showed a quadratic trend (DO-only < Equi > PO-only) with the longest durations for Equi verbs. Third, eye movements consistent with reimagining the event also showed a quadratic trend (DO-only < Equi > PO-only) prior to choosing DO, suggesting that participants used such recall particularly for Equi verbs. Together, these analyses of structural choices, utterance durations, eye movements and individual differences in executive functions shed light on the effects of verb bias and verb-specific competition on sentence production and the role of different executive functions in choosing between sentence structures."
https://openalex.org/W2727070988,"Background Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (S. gallolyticus) is a pathogen of infective endocarditis. It was observed previously that this bacterium survives longer in macrophages than other species and the phagocytic uptake by and survival in THP-1 macrophages is strain-dependent. Methods The phagocytosis assay was performed with THP-1 macrophages. S. gallolyticus specific whole genome microarrays were used for transcriptome analysis. Results Better survival in macrophages was observed for UCN34, BAA-2069 and ATCC43143 than for DSM16831 and LMG17956. S. gallolyticus strains show high resistance to tested bactericidal agents (acid, lysozyme and hydrogen peroxide). S. gallolyticus stimulates significant lower cytokine gene expression and causes less lysis of macrophages compared to the control strain Staphylococcus aureus. S. gallolyticus reacts to oxidative burst with a higher gene expression of NADH oxidase initially at the early phase. Expression of genes involved in D-alanylation of teichoic acid, carbohydrate metabolism and transport systems were upregulated thereafter. Conclusion S. gallolyticus is very resistant to bactericidal agents normally causing degradation of bacteria in phagolysosomes. Additionally, the D-alanylation of teichoic acid is an important factor for survival."
https://openalex.org/W2731674908,"In retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), RPE65 catalyzes the isomerization of all-trans-retinyl fatty acid esters to 11-cis-retinol in the visual cycle and controls the rhodopsin regeneration rate. However, the mechanisms by which these processes are regulated are still unclear. Fatty Acid Transport Protein 1 (FATP1) is involved in fatty acid uptake and lipid metabolism in a variety of cell types. FATP1 co-localizes with RPE65 in RPE and inhibits its isomerase activity in vitro. Here, we further investigated the role of FATP1 in the visual cycle using transgenic mice that overexpress human FATP1 specifically in the RPE (hFATP1TG mice). The mice displayed no delay in the kinetics of regeneration of the visual chromophore 11-cis-retinal after photobleaching and had no defects in light sensitivity. However, the total retinoid content was higher in the hFATP1TG mice than in wild type mice, and the transgenic mice also displayed an age-related accumulation (up to 40%) of all-trans-retinal and retinyl esters that was not observed in control mice. Consistent with these results, hFATP1TG mice were more susceptible to light-induced photoreceptor degeneration. hFATP1 overexpression also induced an ~3.5-fold increase in retinosome autofluorescence, as measured by two-photon microscopy. Interestingly, hFATP1TG retina contained ~25% more photoreceptor cells and ~35% longer outer segments than wild type mice, revealing a non-cell-autonomous effect of hFATP1 expressed in the RPE. These data are the first to show that FATP1-mediated fatty acid uptake in the RPE controls both retinoid metabolism in the outer retina and photoreceptor development."

The aim of this study was to develop an ex vivo and in vivo real-time quantitative imaging test for EGFR inhibitors sensitivity assessment.Erlotinib resistant (A549, H460, H1975), insensitive (H1650) and hypersensitive (HCC827) cell lines were injected subcutaneously in Nude mice. Tumor xenografts from mice treated with Erlotinib were imaged ex vivo and in vivo using probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) and NucView 488 Caspase 3 substrate, a fluorescent probe specific for the activated caspase 3.Assessment of apoptosis at 24h post treatment, both ex vivo in explanted tumor xenografts and in vivo, showed a significant difference between resistant cell lines (A549, H460 and H1975) and insensitive (H1650) or hypersensitive (HCC827) ones (p<0.05 for ex vivo imaging, p≤0.02 for in vivo imaging). There was also a significant difference between insensitive and hypersensitive cell lines, both ex vivo (p<0.05) and in vivo (p = 0.01).Real-time in vivo and ex vivo assessment of apoptosis using pCLE differentiates resistant from sensitive NSCLC xenografts to Erlotinib."
https://openalex.org/W2734248531,"Most protected areas (PA) try to limit logging of forests by means of restrictions on access and use, especially in areas where local communities coexist with the forests and depend on resources derived from PAs. In such contexts, achieving full or effective protection of the forests is almost impossible. This fact has led to researching beyond PAs boundaries in order to examine large surrounding landscapes with multiple forms of properties and restriction on forests use. The present study assessed the change in forest cover and fragmentation between 1990 and 2014, in addition to the drivers that explain such changes in a landscape with the presence of PAs and high-density population belonging to the Chocó-Darien biodiversity hotspot. Results indicated differences in the extent and spatial patterns of change in forest cover of PAs and their surrounding landscapes. Two PAs exhibited a tendency to increase fragmentation and lose their forests in comparison with the stable protection of the forests in other PAs during this period. However, the greatest change in forest cover and fragmentation was observed in the surrounding landscapes, where the best connection to markets and transport networks were the dominating deforestation drivers. Our findings corroborated that the PAs were a shield against the deforestation of the tropical Andean forest, especially in landscapes with high-density population. However, the fragmentation of the forest cannot be avoided around the PAs limits. It is expected that, if this tendency continues in the future, the biodiversity in the Chocó-Darien hotspot will be seriously affected."

Understanding biomechanical and physiological changes that occur when stroller running is needed to evaluate its health impact, yet the effects of stroller running have not been clearly presented. Here, three commonly used stroller pushing methods were investigated to detect potential changes in energetic cost and lower-limb kinematics.Sixteen individuals (M/F: 10/6) ran at self-selected speeds for 800m under three stroller conditions (2-Hands, 1-Hand, and Push/Chase) and an independent running control.A significant decrease in speed (p = 0.001) and stride length (p<0.001) was observed between the control and stroller conditions, however no significant change in energetic cost (p = 0.080) or heart rate (p = 0.393) was observed. Additionally, pushing method had a significant effect on speed (p = 0.001) and stride length (p<0.001).These findings suggest that pushing technique influences stroller running speed and kinematics. These findings suggest specific fitness effects may be achieved through the implementation of different pushing methods."
https://openalex.org/W2733040500,"The selection of stable reference genes is a critical step for the accurate quantification of gene expression. To identify and validate the reference genes in Pandora neoaphidis–an obligate aphid pathogenic fungus—the expression of 13classical candidate reference genes were evaluated by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction(qPCR) at four developmental stages (conidia, conidia with germ tubes, short hyphae and elongated hyphae). Four statistical algorithms, including geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and Delta Ct method were used to rank putative reference genes according to their expression stability and indicate the best reference gene or combination of reference genes for accurate normalization. The analysis of comprehensive ranking revealed that ACT1and 18Swas the most stably expressed genes throughout the developmental stages. To further validate the suitability of the reference genes identified in this study, the expression of cell division control protein 25 (CDC25) and Chitinase 1(CHI1) genes were used to further confirm the validated candidate reference genes. Our study presented the first systematic study of reference gene(s) selection for P. neoaphidis study and provided guidelines to obtain more accurate qPCR results for future developmental efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2730581207,"Glycolipids might become a new type of promising non-viral gene delivery systems because of their low cytotoxicity, structural diversity, controllable aqua- and lipo-solubility, appropriate density and distribution of positive charges, high transfer efficiency and potential targeting function. In this study, four kinds of L-arabinose-based cationic glycolipids (Ara-DiC12MA, Ara-DiC14MA, Ara-DiC16MA and Ara-DiC18MA) containing quaternary ammonium as hydrophilic headgroup and two alkane chains as hydrophobic domain were synthesized and characterized. They were observed to have strong affinities for plasmid DNA (pDNA) and siRNA, the pDNA can be completely condensed at N/P ratio less than 2, and the siRNA can be completely retarded at N/P ratio less than 3. The dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiment and atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiment demonstrated that cationic lipids and their lipoplexes possessed suitable particle sizes with near-spherical shape and proper ζ-potentials for cell transfection. The Ara-DiC16MA liposome was found to have good transfection efficacy in HEK293, PC-3 and Mat cells compared with other three kinds of liposomes, and also maintain low cytotoxicity and better uptake capability in vitro. Furthermore, the gene silencing assay showed that Ara-DiC14MA and Ara-DiC16MA liposomes have demonstrated effective delivery and higher gene knockdown activity (>80%) in the above mentioned cells than Lipofectamine 2000. These results indicated Ara-DiC16MA can be developed for efficient and low toxic gene delivery."
https://openalex.org/W2730997908,"Manifestations of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection can range from self-limiting upper respiratory symptoms to various neurological complications, including speech and language impairment. But an association between Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection and speech and language impairment has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we aim to investigate the association between Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection and subsequent speech and language impairment in a nationwide population-based sample using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. We identified 5,406 children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection (International Classification of Disease, Revision 9, Clinical Modification code 4830) and compared to 21,624 age-, sex-, urban- and income-matched controls on subsequent speech and language impairment. The mean follow-up interval for all subjects was 6.44 years (standard deviation = 2.42 years); the mean latency period between the initial Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection and presence of speech and language impairment was 1.96 years (standard deviation = 1.64 years). The results showed that Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was significantly associated with greater incidence of speech and language impairment [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.23-1.80]. In addition, significantly increased hazard ratio of subsequent speech and language impairment in the groups younger than 6 years old and no significant difference in the groups over the age of 6 years were found (HR = 1.43, 95% CI:1.09-1.88 for age 0-3 years group; HR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.25-2.23 for age 4-5 years group; HR = 1.14, 95% CI: 0.54-2.39 for age 6-7 years group; and HR = 0.83, 95% CI:0.23-2.92 for age 8-18 years group). In conclusion, Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection is temporally associated with incident speech and language impairment."
