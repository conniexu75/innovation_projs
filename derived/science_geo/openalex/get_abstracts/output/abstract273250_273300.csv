https://openalex.org/W2005266029,"The Aral Sea in the Soviet Union, formerly the world's fourth largest lake in area, is disappearing. Between 1960 and 1987, its level dropped nearly 13 meters, and its area decreased by 40 percent. Recession has resulted from reduced inflow caused primarily by withdrawals of water for irrigation. Severe environmental problems have resulted. The sea could dry to a residual brine lake. Local water use is being improved and schemes to save parts of the sea have been proposed. Nevertheless, preservation of the Aral may require implementation of the controversial project to divert water from western Siberia into the Aral Sea basin."
https://openalex.org/W2074256688,"When a chemical bond is broken in a direct dissociation reaction, the process is so rapid that it has generally been considered instantaneous and thus unmeasurable. However, the bond does persist for times on the order of 10(-13) seconds after the photon has been absorbed. Femtosecond (10(-15) second) laser techniques can be used to directly clock this process, which describes the dynamics of the chemical bond. The time required to break the chemical bond in an elementary reaction has been measured and the characteristic repulsion length for the potential governing fragment separation has been obtained."

A master scaling curve is proposed, which ties together the Tc's of virtually all known Bi and Tl oxide superconductors, and shows that the Tl(Bi) layers play an essential role in the superconductivity."
https://openalex.org/W2057970857,"Four commercially important maize parental inbreds and their 12 F(1) hybrids were studied to investigate the role of the phytohormone gibberellin (GA) in the regulation of heterosis (hybrid vigor). All hybrids grew faster than any inbred. In contrast, all inbreds showed a greater promotion of shoot growth after the exogenous application of GA(3). Concentrations of endogenous GA(1), the biological effector for shoot growth in maize, and GA(19), a precursor of GA(1), were measured in apical meristematic shoot cylinders for three of the inbreds and their hybrids by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with selected ion monitoring; deuterated GAs were used as quantitative internal standards. In 34 of 36 comparisons, hybrids contained higher concentrations of endogenous GAs than their parental inbreds. Preferential growth acceleration of the inbreds by exogenous GA(3) indicates that a deficiency of endogenous GA limits the growth of the inbreds and is thus a cause of inbreeding depression. Conversely, the increased endogenous concentration of GA in the hybrids could provide a phytohormonal basis for heterosis for shoot growth."
https://openalex.org/W2025152938,"In many polymer-metal systems, chemical bonds are formed that involve metal-oxygen-carbon complexes. Infrared and MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopic studies indicate that carboxylate groups play an important role in some systems. The oxygen sources may be the polymer, the oxygen present in the oxide on the metal surface, or atmospheric oxygen. Diffusion of metal ions from the substrate into the polymer interphase may occur in some systems that are cured at elevated temperatures. It is unclear whether a similar, less extensive diffusion occurs over long time periods in systems maintained at room temperature. The interfacial region is dynamic, and chemical changes occur with aging at room temperature. Positron annihilation spectroscopy may have application to characterizing the voids at the metal-polymer interface."
https://openalex.org/W1971200108,"DNA is too unstable to be preserved during fossilization, but it still seems possible to infer the genome content of fossils because in every group of organisms investigated cell size is proportional to quantity of DNA. Accordingly, information on macroevolutionary trends in genome size through millions of years is potentially available. This survey of inferred variation in genome content in fossils is based on measurements of epithelial cells in extinct conodonts over a period of 270 million years. Why genome size varies so widely amongst living organisms is a subject of continuing debate. Paleontology offers a distinct temporal perspective, but lack of data on conodont paleoecology make the proposed adaptive explanations for genome variation difficult to test."
https://openalex.org/W1979362150,"The role of crystalline structure in the surface reactivity of predominantly covalent materials has been examined in terms of chemical bonding concepts. In this context a solid surface can be viewed as a giant lattice defect characterized by dangling bonds. Although it is difficult, at the present stage of development of the quantum mechanical approach to surfaces, to define precisely the perturbations resulting from the abrupt termination of the lattice at the surface, a host of experimental observations can be understood by assuming displacements of surface atoms and distortions of bonding configurations in accordance with simple chemical bonding principles. A purely atomistic approach has been shown to account not only for the chemical behavior but also for certain structural and electrical characteristics of the surfaces considered. A number of phenomena, such as crystal growth and the behavior of certain lattice defects (for example, dislocations), are intimately related to the presence of dangling bonds and the associated distortions of the lattice at the surface (32)."
https://openalex.org/W2039159511,"Single cells of the heart of Limulus were examined in situ with conventional microelectrodes. Resting and action potentials were measured in a total of 20 animals, with 25 penetrations per heart during normal spontaneous activity. Resting-potential values averaged 45 millivolts. Action potentials showed a rapid upstroke and a prolonged plateau. A small, irregular burst of electrical activity occurred during the plateau phase, a discharge presumably associated with the ""neurogenic"" character of the heartbeat. There was no significant overshoot, nor was there any topographical localization of action-potential ""types.""."

This performance indicates that chance alone cannot be a major factor in homing, and that certain abilities possessed by this bat, and not simply randomness, must have been in operation."
https://openalex.org/W2091465992,An artifact in autoradiography of bean plants containing phosphorus-32 is reported. It was shown that the apparent accumulation of isotope in primary leaves that were oven-dried prior to exposure to x-ray films was not metabolic but due to a drying gradient occuring within the leaf. This artifact disappears when autoradiographs are made of leaves that have been freeze-dried under vacuum.
