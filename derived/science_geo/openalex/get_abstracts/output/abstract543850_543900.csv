https://openalex.org/W2135191113,"Methanogenic and methanotrophic archaea play important roles in the global flux of methane. Culture-independent approaches are providing deeper insight into the diversity and evolution of methane-metabolizing microorganisms, but, until now, no compelling evidence has existed for methane metabolism in archaea outside the phylum Euryarchaeota. We performed metagenomic sequencing of a deep aquifer, recovering two near-complete genomes belonging to the archaeal phylum Bathyarchaeota (formerly known as the Miscellaneous Crenarchaeotal Group). These genomes contain divergent homologs of the genes necessary for methane metabolism, including those that encode the methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) complex. Additional non-euryarchaeotal MCR-encoding genes identified in a range of environments suggest that unrecognized archaeal lineages may also contribute to global methane cycling. These findings indicate that methane metabolism arose before the last common ancestor of the Euryarchaeota and Bathyarchaeota."

We advanced high-harmonic spectroscopy to resolve spatially and temporally the migration of an electron hole immediately after ionization of iodoacetylene while simultaneously demonstrating extensive control over the process. A multidimensional approach, based on the measurement and accurate theoretical description of both even and odd harmonic orders, enabled us to reconstruct both quantum amplitudes and phases of the electronic states with a resolution of ~100 attoseconds. We separately reconstructed quasi-field-free and laser-controlled charge migration as a function of the spatial orientation of the molecule and determined the shape of the hole created by ionization. Our technique opens the prospect of laser control over electronic primary processes."

In order to find potential new therapeutic targets, scientists are trying to understand the cellular events that promote or prevent metastasis. Hanna et al. now report a role for patrolling monocytes in blocking tumor metastasis to the lungs in mice. Tumors in mice engineered to lack patrolling monocytes showed increased metastasis to the lung but not to other tissues. Patrolling monocytes resided in the microvasculature of the lung, where they engulfed tumor material, which may explain how these cells prevent tumors from colonizing the lung.

We drove the spin resonance with an oscillating electric field (20 to 30 gigahertz) between tip and sample. The readout of the Fe atom's quantum state was performed by spin-polarized detection of the atomic-scale tunneling magnetoresistance. We determine an energy relaxation time of T1 ≈ 100 microseconds and a phase-coherence time of T2 ≈ 210 nanoseconds. The spin resonance signals of different Fe atoms differ by much more than their resonance linewidth; in a traditional ensemble measurement, this difference would appear as inhomogeneous broadening."

AD pathology starts in the entorhinal cortex, making it likely that local neural correlates of spatial navigation, particularly grid cells, are impaired. Grid-cell-like representations in humans can be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We found that young adults at genetic risk for AD (APOE-ε4 carriers) exhibit reduced grid-cell-like representations and altered navigational behavior in a virtual arena. Both changes were associated with impaired spatial memory performance. Reduced grid-cell-like representations were also related to increased hippocampal activity, potentially reflecting compensatory mechanisms that prevent overt spatial memory impairment in APOE-ε4 carriers. Our results provide evidence of behaviorally relevant entorhinal dysfunction in humans at genetic risk for AD, decades before potential disease onset."

We now report a role for Nlrp6 in the control of enteric virus infection. Nlrp6(-/-) and control mice systemically challenged with encephalomyocarditis virus had similar mortality; however, the gastrointestinal tract of Nlrp6(-/-) mice exhibited increased viral loads. Nlrp6(-/-) mice orally infected with encephalomyocarditis virus had increased mortality and viremia compared with controls. Similar results were observed with murine norovirus 1. Nlrp6 bound viral RNA via the RNA helicase Dhx15 and interacted with mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein to induce type I/III interferons (IFNs) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). These data demonstrate that Nlrp6 functions with Dhx15 as a viral RNA sensor to induce ISGs, and this effect is especially important in the intestinal tract."
https://openalex.org/W2179432713,"Pollen grains undergo dramatic changes in cellular water potential as they deliver the male germ line to female gametes, and it has been proposed that mechanosensitive ion channels may sense the resulting mechanical stress. Here, we identify and characterize MscS-like 8 (MSL8), a pollen-specific, membrane tension-gated ion channel required for pollen to survive the hypoosmotic shock of rehydration and for full male fertility. MSL8 negatively regulates pollen germination but is required for cellular integrity during germination and tube growth. MSL8 thus senses and responds to changes in membrane tension associated with pollen hydration and germination. These data further suggest that homologs of bacterial MscS have been repurposed in eukaryotes to function as mechanosensors in multiple developmental and environmental contexts."

A functioning photosynthetic cell requires quality-control mechanisms to turn over and degrade chloroplasts damaged by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here, we generated a conditionally lethal Arabidopsis mutant that accumulated excess protoporphyrin IX in the chloroplast and produced singlet oxygen. Damaged chloroplasts were subsequently ubiquitinated and selectively degraded. A genetic screen identified the plant U-box 4 (PUB4) E3 ubiquitin ligase as being necessary for this process. pub4-6 mutants had defects in stress adaptation and longevity. Thus, we have identified a signal that leads to the targeted removal of ROS-overproducing chloroplasts."
https://openalex.org/W2158547909,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits brain uptake of therapeutic antibodies. It is believed that the BBB is disrupted in Alzheimer's disease (AD), potentially increasing drug permeability de facto. Here we compared active versus passive brain uptake of systemically dosed antibodies (anti-transferrin receptor [TfR] bispecific versus control antibody) in mouse models of AD. We first confirmed BBB disruption in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis as a positive control. Importantly, we found that BBB permeability was vastly spared in mouse models of AD, including PS2-APP, Tau transgenics, and APOE4 knockin mice. Brain levels of TfR in mouse models or in human cases of AD resembled controls, suggesting target engagement of TfR bispecific is not limited. Furthermore, infarcts from human AD brain showed similar occurrences compared to age-matched controls. These results question the widely held view that the BBB is largely disrupted in AD, raising concern about assumptions of drug permeability in disease."
https://openalex.org/W2267180732,"Mammalian sleep comprises rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM (NREM) sleep. To functionally isolate from the complex mixture of neurons populating the brainstem pons those involved in switching between REM and NREM sleep, we chemogenetically manipulated neurons of a specific embryonic cell lineage in mice. We identified excitatory glutamatergic neurons that inhibit REM sleep and promote NREM sleep. These neurons shared a common developmental origin with neurons promoting wakefulness; both derived from a pool of proneural hindbrain cells expressing Atoh1 at embryonic day 10.5. We also identified inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid-releasing neurons that act downstream to inhibit REM sleep. Artificial reduction or prolongation of REM sleep in turn affected slow-wave activity during subsequent NREM sleep, implicating REM sleep in the regulation of NREM sleep."

Continuous formation of plant tissues during postembryonic growth requires asymmetric divisions and the specification of cell lineages. We show that the BIRDs and SCARECROW regulate lineage identity, positional signals, patterning, and formative divisions throughout Arabidopsis root growth. These transcription factors are postembryonic determinants of the ground tissue stem cells and their lineage. Upon further activation by the positional signal SHORT-ROOT (a mobile transcription factor), they direct asymmetric cell divisions and patterning of cell types.

In both cases, activity is externally constrained by the organization of the task and by the size of the environment explored.

These internal dynamics clamp spontaneous travel since run distance distributes into integer multiples of the span of these sequences. These sequences may thus guide navigation when external landmarks are reduced. Hippocampal networks can display sequences of neuronal activation at the temporal resolution of behavior, or compressed within the period of network oscillations (Buzsáki, 2010Buzsáki G. Neural syntax: cell assemblies, synapsembles, and readers.Neuron. 2010; 68: 362-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). The occurrence and organization of these sequences are thought to underlie numerous fundamental operations of the hippocampus, from the sensing of sensory cues and building a cognitive map of the environment, to mnemonic and planning functions (Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2011Dragoi G.

Reactivation of hippocampal ensemble memories during sleep.Science. 1994; 265: 676-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (2070) Google Scholar). At the behavioral timescale, these sequences were first shown to occur in the presence of external landmarks that provide successive cues organizing neuronal activity through exteroception. For example, hippocampal place cells are sequentially activated at consecutive positions in space when a rodent explores an environment naturally delivering serially ordered external landmarks (Dragoi and Buzsáki, 2006Dragoi G. Buzsáki G. Temporal encoding of place sequences by hippocampal cell assemblies.Neuron. 2006; 50: 145-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), even when only tactile and visual cues are provided (Royer et al., 2012Royer S. Zemelman B.V. Losonczy A. Kim J. Chance F. Magee J.C. Buzsáki G. Control of timing, rate and bursts of hippocampal place cells by dendritic and somatic inhibition.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 769-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). However, the sequential activation of hippocampal neurons at the behavioral timescale can also be disengaged from external landmarks and instead occur in the absence of changing sensory or feedback cues. This involves self-organized internal mechanisms but happens within a behaviorally relevant context—for example, during the delay period of a memory task (Itskov et al., 2011Itskov V. Curto C.

To some extent, the reward that guides an animal’s behavior within a defined task also provides an external drive on hippocampal dynamics. Hence, so far it remains unknown whether hippocampal activity can also be organized at population level in the absence of any driving external goal. It is also unknown whether the span of hippocampal sequences is intrinsically predetermined in time or space in the absence of any temporal and spatial boundary. Indeed, both externally and internally triggered sequences observed until now at the timescale of behavior always cover a finite spatial and temporal extent that is constrained by external factors such as the temporal organization of the task (Pastalkova et al., 2008Pastalkova E. Itskov V. Amarasingham A. Buzsáki G. Internally generated cell assembly sequences in the rat hippocampus.Science. 2008; 321: 1322-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar) or the size of the environment explored in space (Ravassard et al., 2013Ravassard P. Kees A. Willers B. Ho D. Aharoni D. Cushman J. Aghajan Z.M. Mehta M.R. Multisensory control of hippocampal spatiotemporal selectivity.Science. 2013; 340: 1342-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). This is an important issue, since it defines the intrinsic determinants and behavioral reach of hippocampal population coding. Here, large-scale two-photon calcium imaging was used to capture population dynamics while resolving single-cell behavior in the CA1 region of awake mice. A simple experimental paradigm was implemented to record spontaneous dynamics while minimizing the influence of external spatiotemporal landmarks or limits, which allows separating the contributions of time, distance, and external motivation to neuronal firing. In these conditions, we show that hippocampal dynamics self-organize into sequences of neuronal activation recurring one after another within discrete run epochs and each spanning accross a fixed traveled distance. These recurring sequences translate into a behavioral correlate, since spontaneous run epochs display some stereotypy: they distribute as multiple integers of the distance unit represented in the sequences. We propose that such sequences could be a default internal dynamic template for spatiotemporal processing in the hippocampus. To observe hippocampal dynamics, we examined the spatiotemporal distribution of neuronal activity in the CA1 pyramidal layer using two-photon calcium imaging of awake head-restrained mice allowed to self-regulate their motion in the dark on a nonmotorized treadmill (Royer et al., 2012Royer S. Zemelman B.V. Losonczy A. Kim J. Chance F. Magee J.C. Buzsáki G. Control of timing, rate and bursts of hippocampal place cells by dendritic and somatic inhibition.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 769-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). In contrast to previous studies, we chose not to deprive mice of water or food so that their behavior was not guided toward receiving any reward. In this way, during each daily imaging session, mice spontaneously traveled on the track through the alternation of run epochs (interquartile range 4–10 s; see Figure S1 available online) and rest epochs (from 10 to 74 s; Figure 1A). Within run epochs, mice moved at various speeds (average 10.4 cm/s, range: 5–20 cm/s) and displayed short periods of immobility (< 2 s; Figures 1D and S1; see Experimental Procedures). To map neuronal activity across consecutive days, we used a viral vector (AAV2/1.syn-GCaMP5G) that makes GABAergic and glutamatergic CA1 neurons express the calcium indicator GCaMP5 (Akerboom et al., 2012Akerboom J. Chen T.W. Wardill T.J. Tian L. Marvin J.S. Mutlu S. Calderón N.C. Esposti F. Borghuis B.G. Sun X.R. et al.Optimization of a GCaMP calcium indicator for neural activity imaging.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 13819-13840Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). In order to image from a large population of neurons (∼1,000 cells, Figure 1), we used a low-magnification objective that allows for imaging a 400 × 400 μm2 field of view centered on the stratum pyramidale (Figure 1B) after surgical implantation of a chronic glass window on the hippocampus (Dombeck et al., 2010Dombeck D.A. Harvey C.D. Tian L. Looger L.L. Tank D.W. Functional imaging of hippocampal place cells at cellular resolution during virtual navigation.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 1433-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). This surgical procedure was previously shown to allow for the reliable recording of place cell activity (Dombeck et al., 2010Dombeck D.A. Harvey C.D. Tian L. Looger L.L. Tank D.W. Functional imaging of hippocampal place cells at cellular resolution during virtual navigation.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 1433-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), and we show it has no impact on exploratory activity (Figure S2). After three to five habituation sessions, mice running on an empty self-paced treadmill in the dark were imaged (Figure 1A), an experimental configuration that allows studying CA1 dynamics under the sole influence of self-motion cues. Spontaneous behavior remained highly variable and did not display any significant repetition pattern from one day to the next (Figures S1C–S1F). This lack of behavioral stereotypy enabled disentangling the relative contributions of time and distance to the firing of neurons. Most of the activity was observed during run epochs (Figure 1C). Unexpectedly (Kentros et al., 2004Kentros C.G. Agnihotri N.T. Streater S. Hawkins R.D. Kandel E.R. Increased attention to spatial context increases both place field stability and spatial memory.Neuron. 2004; 42: 283-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, Pastalkova et al., 2008Pastalkova E. Itskov V. Amarasingham A. Buzsáki G. Internally generated cell assembly sequences in the rat hippocampus.Science. 2008; 321: 1322-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar), out of 65 imaging sessions (Figure S1G), we found that CA1 dynamics displayed recurring sequences of neuronal firing exclusively during run epochs in 28 imaging sessions (five mice; Figure 1C; Movie S1). Statistical analysis using data reshuffling established that sequences were not occurring by chance (p < 0.001, see Experimental Procedures). These sequences repeatedly engaged a sparse and scattered neuronal population that represented about 5% of all imaged neurons and 36% of the total fraction of active cells during run (Figure 1B). Cells engaged in these sequences were spatially intermingled with other run active cells that displayed variable activity patterns (Figures 1B and 1C), including sustained firing (25% of active cells, Figure 1C), or uncorrelated and sparse activation onsets (39% of active cells, Figure S3). Recent studies have addressed the relative influence of external sensory cues or behavioral context on the patterning of hippocampal dynamics, and it is now well established that, at the single-cell level, these can be controlled by absolute or relative location and time depending on the available and relevant stimulus for the task at hand (Aghajan et al., 2014Aghajan Z.M.

Multisensory control of hippocampal spatiotemporal selectivity.Science. 2013; 340: 1342-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We thus asked whether the sequences of neuronal activation observed here were driven by absolute location or time. We can exclude a modulation of neuronal firing by the absolute position on the treadmill (as could occur if an undetected cue was left on the track) since (1) sequence recurrence never matched the length of the treadmill (180 cm, Figure 2D) and (2) as expected from a 0.05 statistical cutoff, less than 5% of the cells recruited in sequences displayed significantly location-modulated activation (1,048 cells out of 28 sessions, p < 0.05, Kolmogorov-Smirnoff uniformity test on firing onset distribution along the treadmill, Figure 2E). Similarly, sequences could not be integrating absolute elapsed time because (1) sequences could repeat one after another either within the same run epoch (defined as periods where speed exceeds 2 cm/s, Figure 3A) or separated by rest periods of variable duration (Figures 1A and S1); and (2) sequences could be transiently perturbed during short immobility gaps (Figure S1) and then resumed when running restarted, since the slope during the pause was significantly different from that before and after it (Figure 1D). Thus the sequences observed are independent from absolute time or location. Analysis was therefore next restricted only to run epochs in order to determine whether neuronal sequences were constrained by the integration of time or distance during mouse travel. To test whether sequences integrated travel duration or distance, we analyzed, for each imaging session, the correlation between the slopes of the sequences (in the temporal or spatial domain) and the median mouse speed of the corresponding run epochs. If the progress of neuronal activation was set by the run distance, then the temporal slope of the sequences (expressed as cell/s) should correlate with speed while the spatial slope (in cm/cell) should be constant and thus independent from speed (Figures 2A and 2B ). For each imaging session, we calculated the Spearman correlation coefficient between the temporal or spatial slope and the speed (Figure 2B); this analysis is a robust way to assess distance or time representation in noisy data (see data simulation in Figures S3B–S3D). Across sessions, sequences could be modulated by time and distance (28 imaging sessions, n = 5 mice, Figures 2B and S1). However, in many cases they were principally modulated by distance alone (14 out of 28 sessions, Spearman p < 0.05; Table S1). In the intermediate cases, both time and distance representations seemed to intermingle (11 out of 28), whereas time alone was organizing neuronal activation in a minority of the sessions (3 out of 28). This demonstrates that, as previously described at single-cell level, hippocampal dynamics capture both spatial and temporal information at the population level (Kraus et al., 2013Kraus B.J. Robinson 2nd, R.J. White J.A. Eichenbaum H. Hasselmo M.E. Hippocampal “time cells”: time versus path integration.Neuron. 2013; 78: 1090-1101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). However, when integrating information at the population level over each imaging session, we observe that on average distance is more likely to be represented in our experimental conditions (Figures 2B and S1). As distance-modulated sequences were frequent, analysis was next restricted to the imaging sessions in which these were observed (n = 14 sessions, 5 mice, 493 sequences, Experimental Procedures, and Figure S1G). Such distance-modulated sequences (DS) repetitively engaged the same neurons within an imaging session (Figures 1C and 2C, on average 70%). They spanned most but not all the distance traveled within a run epoch. A period of travel could therefore sometimes not be represented within neuronal dynamics (a “nonencoded travel distance,” Figure 2C). This indicated that DSs do not provide a metric integrating the total distance covered by the mouse but instead display a finite size that is intrinsically set. This “nonencoded travel distance” did not involve the coordinated firing of another group of cells, as only one recurring pattern of neuronal activation was detected per session. Also, as expected, the onsets of the calcium transients of the neurons engaged in the DS (DS neurons) were not locked to the treadmill lap in contrast to those of the neurons displaying location-dependent firing after a few days of spontaneous run in the presence of serial tactile cues (i.e., place cells, n = 3 mice, Figure 2D). Neither were these onsets periodic, given the occurrence of “nonencoded traveled distances” between sequences. Nor were the DSs triggered by a undetectable cue on the track (Figure 2E). Therefore, in conditions dominated by idiothetic cues, some fixed distance metric can be represented in the hippocampus in the form of recurring sequences of neuronal activation. We next asked whether the finite size of the DS was due to experimental limitations, or instead could represent an intrinsic metric for distance. To this aim, we first analyzed the topographical arrangement of DS neurons. The spatial distribution of DS neurons within the pyramidal layer did not display any remarkable pattern since these were not more clustered than expected by chance, even when taking into account their time of recruitment within the sequence (Figure S4). This indicates that our imaging field of view sampled from a random representative subset of DS neurons and that the distance span covered by each sequence was unlikely to be truncated. Mouse behavior may control or be controlled by the firing of hippocampal neurons. Thus, the distance encoded at population level in the DS could be set by the mouse behavior or conversely, spontaneous runs could be internally predetermined by the spatial extent of the DS. In order to address the former hypothesis, we have plotted the distribution of the mouse speed centered on the time of DS start or stop. We first used the first DS of each run epoch as a reference (Figure 3B). In this case, DS onsets were time-locked to the start of the run (Figure 3B1) whereas DS offsets occurred before its end (Figure 3B2). DS could also repeat in the middle of a run epoch one after another (Figure 3A), and this repetition is expected to be triggered by an external drive, such as a short pause in mouse run or a cue on the track. To test the first possibility, the onsets and offsets of these DS were specifically used as a reference for the mouse speed distribution plots (Figures 3B3 and 3B4). Surprisingly, no significant pause or deceleration were observed. However, speed significantly increased by about 20% (Figure 3B3). This is a potentially interesting finding that may relate to the mechanisms of sequence initiation given that the firing frequency of CA1 pyramidal neurons increases with speed (Hirase et al., 1999Hirase H. Czurko A. Csicsvari J. Buzsaki G. Firing rate and theta-phase coding by hippocampal pyramidal neurons during “space clamping.”.Eur. J.

In addition, DS repetition was not linked to a cue on the track (uniformity Kolmogorov-Smirnov test Figure 3C, p > 0.1). Hence, both the onset and offset of a DS could be uncorrelated to the start and end of the run, in contrast to previous reports where the span of neuronal activation sequences was constrained by the underlying task (Kraus et al., 2013Kraus B.J.

This shows the intrinsic finite extent of sequences of neural activation in CA1 that encode traveled distance without being locked to behavior. We thus refer to such discrete span of the DS as the “distance unit” (DU) encoded at population level within the imaging session. Quantification of the DU for each imaging session revealed that these spanned across a wide range (12–112 cm, Figure 4A), even for the same mouse across imaging days, indicating that this value is not preset. We took advantage of this variability to test if, as for place cells where the size of place fields scales with that of the explored environment (Diba and Buzsáki, 2008Diba K. Buzsáki G. Hippocampal network dynamics constrain the time lag between pyramidal cells across modified environments.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 13448-13456Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, Muller and Kubie, 1987Muller R.U. Kubie J.L.

Geometric determinants of the place fields of hippocampal neurons.Nature. 1996; 381: 425-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar), the “average distance field width” (Experimental Procedures) linearly scaled with the DU. Such a relationship could be observed (Figure 4E, Pearson, R = 0,94, p < 0.001), indicating a shared property between distance and place fields. Since the DU could considerably vary across days, we compared the set of neurons involved within the DS from one imaging session to the next. Almost one-third of the cells involved within a DS one day were still recruited the next (28% ± 8%, three sessions paired, two mice, Figures 4B and 4C). In addition, although no serial external cues were provided to support and recall the sequence organization, the relative order of the neurons within the sequences was also maintained (Figures 4C and S4B). This indicates that DS rely on intrinsically prewired functional links between neurons. DS thus provide an internal template for the integration of incoming sensory signals. Last, we asked whether the template metric provided by the DU shaped spontaneous mouse runs. To this aim, analysis was focused on the distribution of the distance traveled within single run epochs (that comprised a detected DS), expressed in DU (rather than cm). The median value of this normalized distance, calculated per imaging session, segregated into two groups (group 1, 1–2 DU, 235 run epochs, 10 sessions; group 2, 2.5–3.2 DU, 90 run epochs, 4 sessions; Figure S4C; Table S1). When pooling together group 1, we noticed that the distribution was significantly bimodal with peaks at 1.1 and 2.1 DU (Figures 4D and S4; p < 0.001, see Experimental Procedures), whereas it was log-normal without normalization. Regarding group 2 distribution bimodality, the occurrence of imaging sessions displaying a majority of run epochs with more than 2DS was too infrequent to draw any significant conclusion. Thus, spontaneous run epochs tended to distribute as integer multiples of the distance intrinsically integrated in the respective DS. This further supports the idea that DSs are a representation of distance encoded in the hippocampal network. This study shows that sparse and stereotyped chains of neuronal activation, integrating spatiotemporal components of behavior, spontaneously recur one after another, without any external drive, in the hippocampus under the influence of self-motion. We show that the “distance unit” associated to these intrinsically finite sequences provides a population metric for distance encoded in CA1 dynamics. This DU is not entirely engraved, as it could vary on a daily basis. However, the partial replay of sequences from one day to the next strongly suggests the existence of internally prewired networks (Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2014Dragoi G. Tonegawa S. Selection of preconfigured cell assemblies for representation of novel spatial experiences.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2014; 369: 20120522Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Animals were more likely to travel spontaneously once or twice the “distance unit,” suggesting that linear path integration may use dead reckoning cycles and that this internal representation is limited. In natural environments, this function is complemented by landmark recognition (McNaughton et al., 1991McNaughton B.L. Chen L.L. Markus E.J. “Dead reckoning,” landmark learning, and the sense of direction: a neurophysiological and computational hypothesis.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 1991; 3: 190-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the absence of external cues, integer multiples of the DU operate as attractor states for spontaneous behavior. This finding was made possible by a combination of factors that were not gathered before (Chen et al., 2013Chen G. King J.A. Burgess N. O’Keefe J.

The Kepler satellite has observed a few dozen red giants with depressed dipole modes which we interpret as stars with strongly magnetized cores.

The rich information content represented by such landscapes in acute slices and in vivo promises to unveil the hitherto unexplored, potentially fundamental aspects of brain cell physiology. Neural communication in the brain relies on the homeostasis and dynamics of intracellular Ca2+. In neurons, release of neurotransmitters is controlled by presynaptic Ca2+ entry (Katz and Miledi, 1968Katz B. Miledi R. The role of calcium in neuromuscular facilitation.J. Physiol. 1968; 195: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar), whereas memory trace formation depends on postsynaptic Ca2+ transients in dendritic spines (Lisman, 1989Lisman J.

USA. 1989; 86: 9574-9578Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar, Nishiyama et al., 2000Nishiyama M. Hong K. Mikoshiba K. Poo M.M. Kato K. Calcium stores regulate the polarity and input specificity of synaptic modification.Nature. 2000; 408: 584-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Subtle alterations in basal [Ca2+] play a key role in nerve cell signal transduction cascades (Ross, 2012Ross W.N. Understanding calcium waves and sparks in central neurons.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 13: 157-168PubMed Google Scholar), also correlating with aging (Toescu and Verkhratsky, 2007Toescu E.C. Verkhratsky A.

More recently, it has emerged that brain astroglia contribute to signal transfer in local neural circuits (Halassa and Haydon, 2010Halassa M.M. Haydon P.G.

Electrically passive astrocytes handle physiological messages primarily through intracellular Ca2+ waves that show multiple spatiotemporal modalities in situ and in vivo (Di Castro et al., 2011Di Castro M.A. Chuquet J.

Physiol. 2013; 141: 633-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), including slow changes in basal [Ca2+] (Shigetomi et al., 2012Shigetomi E. Tong X. Kwan K.Y. Corey D.P. Khakh B.S. TRPA1 channels regulate astrocyte resting calcium and inhibitory synapse efficacy through GAT-3.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 70-80Crossref Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Accurate [Ca2+] monitoring in neurons and glia therefore remains crucial to our understanding of brain function. Historically, ratiometric Ca2+ indicators applied in cell cultures have provided accurate measurements of intracellular [Ca2+] and its slow changes (Grynkiewicz et al., 1985Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. A new generation of Ca2+ indicators with greatly improved fluorescence properties.J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, Tsien, 1989Tsien R.Y. Fluorescent probes of cell signaling.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1989; 12: 227-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). However, the use of such indicators in situ has been limited because light absorption and scattering in organized tissue are strongly wavelength dependent and furthermore could vary with activity or development (Grienberger and Konnerth, 2012Grienberger C. Konnerth A. Imaging calcium in neurons.Neuron. 2012; 73: 862-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, Oheim et al., 2001Oheim M. Beaurepaire E. Chaigneau E. Mertz J. Charpak S. Two-photon microscopy in brain tissue: parameters influencing the imaging depth.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2001; 111: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). These factors introduce poorly controlled errors to the ratiometric readout, which relies on the pre-determined signal ratios at different wavelengths. Instead, [Ca2+] monitoring in situ has commonly been carried out using fluorescence intensity-based measures (Grienberger and Konnerth, 2012Grienberger C. Konnerth A. Imaging calcium in neurons.Neuron. 2012; 73: 862-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, Maravall et al., 2000Maravall M. Mainen Z.F. Sabatini B.L. Svoboda K. Estimating intracellular calcium concentrations and buffering without wavelength ratioing.Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2655-2667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). While providing robust readout for rapid [Ca2+] dynamics, the accuracy of the latter approach for low basal [Ca2+] (below 100 nM) is limited by the errors pertinent to the low signal-to-noise ratio, fluctuations in the dye concentration, focus drift, or photobleaching (Oertner et al., 2002Oertner T.G.

Rusakov D.A. Main determinants of presynaptic Ca2+ dynamics at individual mossy fiber-CA3 pyramidal cell synapses.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7071-7081Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Evaluating resting [Ca2+] and its intracellular distribution in situ has thus remained a challenge, yet this knowledge appears essential for deciphering Ca2+ signals in various physiological scenarios. In contrast to the common intensity-based measurements, fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) exploits the fact that photon emission is a stochastic event occurring for up to several nanoseconds post-excitation, with a progressively declining probability. By registering a large number of emission events, FLIM thus restores the fluorescence signal decay time course (see below). This decay could be highly sensitive to molecular microenvironment; FLIM techniques have been emerging that use specific indicators to monitor nanometer-scale molecular interactions in live cells (Koldenkova and Nagai, 2013Koldenkova V.P. Nagai T.

Kwok S. Hayashi Y. Application of FRET probes in the analysis of neuronal plasticity.Front. Neural Circuits. 2013; 7: 163Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Because the fluorescence decay does not depend on how many dye molecules are imaged or how many photons are counted (these numbers will instead affect the measurement error), FLIM readout is inherently insensitive to the emission intensity or dye concentration. Consequently, it is also insensitive to focus fluctuations or light scattering, which all represent the key factors hampering fluorescence imaging in situ. It has also been found that the fluorescence lifetime of some commonly used Ca2+ dyes, such as Oregon Green BAPTA-1 (OGB-1), is sensitive to free Ca2+ in the nanomolar range (Wilms and Eilers, 2007Wilms C.D.

Quantitative two-photon Ca2+ imaging via fluorescence lifetime analysis.Cell Calcium. 2006; 40: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This feature of OGB-1 has led to a successful evaluation of bulk changes in astroglial [Ca2+] in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease (Kuchibhotla et al., 2009Kuchibhotla K.V. Lattarulo C.R. Hyman B.T. Bacskai B.J. Synchronous hyperactivity and intercellular calcium waves in astrocytes in Alzheimer mice.Science. 2009; 323: 1211-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). However, because FLIM readout can be sensitive to other variables of the intracellular milieu (Baylor and Hollingworth, 2011Baylor S.M. Hollingworth S. Calcium indicators and calcium signalling in skeletal muscle fibres during excitation-contraction coupling.Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2011; 105: 162-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), such as pH (Battisti et al., 2012Battisti A. Digman M.A. Gratton E. Storti B. Beltram F. Bizzarri R. Intracellular pH measurements made simple by fluorescent protein probes and the phasor approach to fluorescence lifetime imaging.Chem. Commun. (Camb.). 2012; 48: 5127-5129Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), temperature (Tsuji et al., 2013Tsuji T. Yoshida S. Yoshida A. Uchiyama S. Cationic fluorescent polymeric thermometers with the ability to enter yeast and mammalian cells for practical intracellular temperature measurements.Anal. Chem. 2013; 85: 9815-9823Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), or medium viscosity (Wu et al., 2013Wu Y. Stefl M. Olzyńska A. Hof M. Yahioglu G. Yip P. Casey D.R. Ces O. Humpolíčková J. Kuimova M.K. Molecular rheometry: direct determination of viscosity in Lo and Ld lipid phases via fluorescence lifetime imaging.Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2013; 15: 14986-14993Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), validating the method accordingly has remained an important issue. Here we show that the Ca2+-dependent lifetime of OGB-1 excited in two-photon mode is insensitive to physiological changes in pH, [Mg2+], [Zn2+], a ubiquitous neural protein (actin), temperature, or micro-viscosity. We implement a FLIM photon-counting procedure that boosts the readout stability, enabling a FLIM-mode image acquisition in situ at 100 Hz. We adapt this technique for high-sensitivity, high-resolution [Ca2+] monitoring in neurons and astroglia in acute brain slices and in vivo. Our case study unveils some previously unattainable, striking features of the intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis in the brain, suggesting a strong gnostic potential for the present technique. The in-house FLIM system used either a BioRad Radiance single-scanhead, or an Olympus FluoView dual-scanhead microscope (Figure 1A; Experimental Procedures). The FLIM duty cycle was driven by an 80 MHz infrared pulsed laser (SpectraPhysics Newport MaiTai). First, we calibrated OGB-1 FLIM readouts (at λx2P = 800 nm) using standard solutions of buffered [Ca2+] (Experimental Procedures). The outcome was readily consistent with previous reports (Wilms and Eilers, 2007Wilms C.D. Eilers J. Photo-physical properties of Ca2+-indicator dyes suitable for two-photon fluorescence-lifetime recordings.J. Microsc. 2007; 225: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, Wilms et al., 2006Wilms C.D. Schmidt H. Eilers J. Quantitative two-photon Ca2+ imaging via fluorescence lifetime analysis.Cell Calcium. 2006; 40: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), displaying high FLIM readout sensitivity in the 10–200 nM [Ca2+] range (Figure 1B). With no live tissue, the length of laser exposure in these tests was virtually unrestricted; this enabled large numbers of photon counts to follow the OGB-1 fluorescence decay with the required accuracy. In live-cell imaging, however, laser exposure is a major limiting factor; the maximal readout rate will be constrained by the minimal number of photon counts required to estimate [Ca2+] from its FLIM calibration data (Figure 1B). It was important therefore to develop a procedure that minimizes photon counts required to evaluate the OGB-1 fluorescence lifetime. We asked how the classical approach, which in the case of OGB-1 involves bi-exponential approximation of the fluorescence decay (suggested by the underlying physics) (Kuchibhotla et al., 2009Kuchibhotla K.V. Lattarulo C.R. Hyman B.T. Bacskai B.J. Synchronous hyperactivity and intercellular calcium waves in astrocytes in Alzheimer mice.Science. 2009; 323: 1211-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, Wilms et al., 2006Wilms C.D. Schmidt H. Eilers J. Quantitative two-photon Ca2+ imaging via fluorescence lifetime analysis.Cell Calcium. 2006; 40: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), compares with other estimators on the same datasets. Our systematic comparisons have revealed that direct integration of photon counts during a 9 ns window post-peak (termed here normalized total count, NTC; Figure S1A) produces a [Ca2+] measurement error that is several times smaller than the error pertinent to the bi-exponential approximation (Figure S1B). Thus, NTC should substantially reduce the laser exposure time to obtain a required signal-to-noise ratio for [Ca2+] monitoring, compared to a traditional method. Reassuringly, the single-value NTC estimator provided a calibration function for [Ca2+] with an excellent sigmoid fit (Figure 1C). Equipped with this measure, we next tested whether the FLIM [Ca2+] readout was affected by the common micro-environment factors in the intracellular milieu. First, the tests showed excellent stability for [Ca2+] evaluation over the wide range of pH (Figure 1D) or [Mg2+] values (Figure 1E, upper panel), the two concomitants most likely to be affected by cellular activity. The FLIM readout was also unaffected by the length of laser exposure (Figure 1E, lower panel), thus ruling out the effects pertinent to photobleaching. Similarly, the NTC measure was not influenced by the temperature (19°C–36°C range, Figure 1F), by changes in the medium viscosity (altered by adding 70 kDa dextran; Figure 1G), or by [Zn2+] fluctuations (Figure S1C). Some Ca2+ indicators, such as indo-1 and fura-2, were reported to show sensitivity in their Ca2+-binding or spectral properties (although apparently not in the fluorescence lifetime) to ubiquitous cytoplasmic proteins in the muscle (Baker et al., 1994Baker A.J. Brandes R. Schreur J.H.M. Camacho S.A. Weiner M.W. Protein and acidosis alter calcium-binding and fluorescence spectra of the calcium indicator indo-1.Biophys.

Myoplasmic binding of fura-2 investigated by steady-state fluorescence and absorbance measurements.Biophys. J. 1988; 54: 1089-1104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). We found that adding the omnipresent neuronal protein actin to the calibration medium, in a range of plausible concentrations, had no effect on the [Ca2+] FLIM measure (Figure S1D). Taken together, these tests appear to meet, or probably exceed, the non-specificity requirements expected from commonly used Ca2+ indicators. We thus deemed our OGB-1 FLIM readout (NTC) suitable for monitoring intracellular [Ca2+] in situ. Interestingly, [Ca2+] sensitivity of the OGB-1 fluorescence decay is not universal among Ca2+ dyes: the NTC readout of Fluo-4 was insensitive to [Ca2+] (Figures S1E and S1F). To validate our approach for in situ [Ca2+] measurements, we explored a well-established preparation of acute hippocampal slices (from P21–P24 rats, unless indicated otherwise; Experimental Procedures). We held a CA1 pyramidal neuron in whole-cell configuration (loaded with 200 μM OGB-1; quiescent slice conditions), as detailed previously (Sylantyev et al., 2013Sylantyev S. Jensen T.P. Ross R.A. Rusakov D.A. Cannabinoid- and lysophosphatidylinositol-sensitive receptor GPR55 boosts neurotransmitter release at central synapses.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 5193-5198Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and carried out pixel-by-pixel [Ca2+] mapping in image stacks (Figure 2A; typical frame recording time 60–120 s, laser power < 8 mW under the objective). It normally took ∼20 min after break-in for [Ca2+] to stabilize in dendrites (Figure 2B) and ∼30 min in dendritic spines (Figure S2B). We also established an optimal regime of collecting such images in FLIM mode. Resting [Ca2+] remained stable at inter-frame intervals of >3 s, whereas during continuous frame acquisition it was slightly elevated (Figure S2B); the latter was consistent with residual photo-damage (Koester et al., 1999Koester H.J. Baur D. Uhl R. Hell S.W. Ca2+ fluorescence imaging with pico- and femtosecond two-photon excitation: signal and photodamage.Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2226-2236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Because FLIM readout does not depend on the dye concentration, it should provide an unbiased measure for [Ca2+] fluctuations pertinent to pipette dialysis and exogenous Ca2+ buffering. We therefore mapped [Ca2+] at different distances from the somatic patch pipette (Figure 2A; [Ca2+] remained at 200–300 nM inside the pipette tip, likely because of exposure to the bath medium prior to patching). Strikingly, in CA1 pyramidal neurons [Ca2+] dropped to 57 ± 8 nM almost immediately outside the pipette tip (Figures 2A and 2C). The average [Ca2+] remained low throughout the apical dendrites (n = 35 pyramidal cells, Figures 2A and 2C; note a slightly higher level in basal dendritic branches) over the recording time (30–120 min). Furthermore, [Ca2+] values in individual dendritic compartments were well correlated among different cells (i.e., they were predictable rather than varied randomly) but not correlated with the residual patch-pipette [Ca2+] (Figure S2C). These observations indicate that principal neurons in situ possess a robust molecular machinery to maintain low [Ca2+] in whole-cell mode. However, Ca2+ buffering indicators, combined with continuous patch-pipette dialysis, could still alter the endogenous resting [Ca2+]. We therefore compared [Ca2+] NTC readout for two OGB-1 concentrations (200 and 400 μM) and also in conditions of OGB-1 single-cell bolus-patch loading (whole-cell dialysis lasting only 2–3 min; Figure 2D; Experimental Procedures). The outcome showed no significant difference among tested OGB-1 loading protocols across the dendritic compartments (Figure 2F; the data suggest a slight trend toward lower [Ca2+] at the higher OGB-1). Finally, we implemented our FLIM measurement approach in vivo using local delivery of cell-permeable OGB-1 AM by microinjection via a pressurized pipette (“multiple-cell bolus loading”). In this protocol, the dye is taken up and subsequently hydrolyzed inside cells (Garaschuk et al., 2006Garaschuk O. Milos R.I. Konnerth A. Targeted bulk-loading of fluorescent indicators for two-photon brain imaging in vivo.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 380-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar; Experimental Procedures). Basal [Ca2+] measured in readily identifiable somata of cortical neurons (n = 223 cells, layer II–III of somatosensory cortex; Figure 2E and Figure 3D) was on average higher than that in acute slices (mean ± SD; 82.4 ± 15.8 nM); this was most likely due to intermittent network activity, which is absent in quiescent slices. Taken together, these observations suggest that the active mechanisms of Ca2+ homeostasis in neurons (see Discussion) can cope with variable amounts of Ca2+ -buffering indicators commonly used in Ca2+ imaging studies. Photon counting in FLIM requires hundreds of excitation cycles for every imaged pixel, and therefore it takes time to generate a detailed [Ca2+] map (e.g., Figure 2A; 30–120 s for a single-section image). To enable registration of rapid [Ca2+] changes evoked by neuronal activity, we therefore developed a procedure to record FLIM data (NTC readout) in a rapid imaging sequence, with 10 ms temporal resolution (Experimental Procedures). To validate the method in a typical imaging experiment, we recorded [Ca2+] signals in neuronal dendrites following a 500 ms train of back propagating spikes evoked at frequencies between 4 and 200 Hz and used this dataset to compare the common intensity readout ΔF/F with the calibrated NTC readout (Figure 2G). As expected, ΔF/F response was highly sub-linear due to dye saturation (Figure 2G, left panel; Figure 2H). More importantly, translating these ΔF/F data into the [Ca2+] time course would require detailed kinetic modeling and additional experimental controls (Ermolyuk et al., 2012Ermolyuk Y.S. Alder F.G. Henneberger C. Rusakov D.A. Kullmann D.M. Volynski K.E. Independent regulation of basal neurotransmitter release efficacy by variable Ca2+ influx and bouton size at small central synapses.PLoS Biol. 2012; 10: e1001396Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, Rusakov, 2015Rusakov D.A. Disentangling calcium-driven astrocyte physiology.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2015; 16: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In contrast, NTC readout directly provided [Ca2+] values and was linearly related to the spike frequency (Figure 2G, right) for up to 80 Hz firing rate (near-complete saturation; Figure 2H). The linear relationship between [Ca2+] readout and spike frequency is an important feature because it could be critical for accurate registration of spiking with Ca2+ indicators in vivo (Grienberger and Konnerth, 2012Grienberger C. Konnerth A. Imaging calcium in neurons.Neuron. 2012; 73: 862-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). To directly compare intracellular [Ca2+] between neurons and astroglia, we patched and loaded with OGB-1 the two cell types in close proximity and FLIM-mapped the area for [Ca2+] (Figure 3A; see Movie S1 for 3D animation). This experiment revealed several prominent phenomena. First, resting [Ca2+] in principal neurons was substantially lower than in neighboring astroglia. Second, the patched astrocyte showed elevated [Ca2+] compared to its neighbors filled with OGB-1 through the astrocyte-astrocyte gap junctions (GJs; Figure 3A), which are permeable to small (<1.5 kDa) indicators (Giaume et al., 2010Giaume C. Koulakoff A. Roux L. Holcman D. Rouach N. Astroglial networks: a step further in neuroglial and gliovascular interactions.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Third, these GJ-connected astrocytes appeared to maintain radial [Ca2+] gradients, with the concentration increasing toward the cell periphery (Figure 3B; Figure S3A). Conversely, in the patched cell [Ca2+] decreased toward the cell periphery (Figure 3B; Figure S3B). Reassuringly, these observations were fully recapitulated in vivo: basal [Ca2+] in neurons was consistently lower than that in astroglia (compare Figures 2E with 3C and 3D). The [Ca2+] values and soma-periphery gradients were therefore being consistent throughout GC-connected, bolus-loaded, or intact in vivo astrocytes (Figure 3E). Thus, in astrocytes held in whole cell, [Ca2+] was elevated toward the soma, whereas in GJ-connected cells it was generally lower while showing the opposite, somatofugal elevation (Figure 3E). The latter trend was somewhat reversed in the endfoot processes in vivo (Figure 3E), which appear to control local vasculature in a Ca2+-dependent fashion (Otsu et al., 2015Otsu Y. Couchman K. Lyons D.G. Collot M. Agarwal A. Mallet J.-M. Pfrieger F.W. Bergles D.E. Charpak S. Calcium dynamics in astrocyte processes during neurovascular coupling.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 210-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Throughout imaged astroglia, basal intracellular [Ca2+], once equilibrated (10–15 min post-patch), remained remarkably stable, both across the cell population (Figure S3C) and within individual cells (Figure S3D). Notably, in GJ-connected astrocytes [Ca2+] did not depend on the distance from the patched cell (Figure 3A; Figure S3E), even though the OGB-1 concentration inside such cells must drop steeply with this distance (Henneberger et al., 2010Henneberger C. Papouin T. Oliet S.H. Rusakov D.A. Long-term potentiation depends on release of D-serine from astrocytes.Nature. 2010; 463: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). Furthermore, increasing OGB-1 in the patch pipette 2-fold had no effect on resting [Ca2+], in either patched or GJ-connected cells (Figure S3F), thus confirming little effect of the dye concentration on the astroglial basal [Ca2+]. Although our experiments dealt with quiescent tissue, astroglia in these conditions could still show spontaneous local Ca2+ rises; in individual branches they appear at a frequency of less than one per minute in most cases, in situ or in vivo (Di Castro et al., 2011Di Castro M.A. Chuquet J. Liaudet N. Bhaukaurally K. Santello M. Bouvier D. Tiret P. Volterra A. Local Ca2+ detection and modulation of synaptic release by astrocytes.Nat.

Because [Ca2+] rises could potentially affect time-averaged basal [Ca2+] maps, we separated branches that did and did not generate [Ca2+] signals over the imaging period (termed active and inactive braches, respectively). Consistent with previous observations (Di Castro et al., 2011Di Castro M.A. Chuquet J. Liaudet N. Bhaukaurally K. Santello M. Bouvier D. Tiret P. Volterra A.

https://openalex.org/W2127863889,"The serial ordering of individual movements into sequential patterns is thought to require synaptic plasticity within corticostriatal circuits that route information through the basal ganglia. We used genetically and anatomically targeted manipulations of specific circuit elements in mice to isolate the source and target of a corticostriatal synapse that regulates the performance of a serial order task. This excitatory synapse originates in secondary motor cortex, terminates on direct pathway medium spiny neurons in the dorsolateral striatum, and is strengthened by serial order learning. This experience-dependent and synapse-specific form of plasticity may sculpt the balance of activity in basal ganglia circuits during sequential movements, driving a disparity in striatal output that favors the direct pathway. This disparity is necessary for execution of responses in serial order, even though both direct and indirect pathways are active during movement initiation, suggesting dynamic modulation of corticostriatal circuitry contributes to the choreography of behavioral routines."

However, their composition and contribution to glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) remains unclear. In this study, endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ depletion triggered by acetylcholine (ACh) or thapsigargin stimulated the formation of a ternary complex composed of Orai1, TRPC1, and STIM1, the key proteins involved in the formation of SOCs.

Pharmacological SOCs inhibition or dominant negative blockade of Orai1 or TRPC1 using the specific pore mutants Orai1-E106D and TRPC1-F562A impaired GSIS in rat β-cells and fully blocked the potentiating effect of ACh on secretion. In contrast, pharmacological or dominant negative blockade of TRPC3 had no effect on extracellular Ca2+ entry and GSIS. Finally, we observed that prolonged exposure to supraphysiological glucose concentration impaired SOCs function without altering the expression levels of STIM1, Orai1, and TRPC1.

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increasing at an alarming rate, because of the combination of aging population, urbanization, physical inactivity, and the increasing prevalence of obesity (1.Wild S.

Global prevalence of diabetes: estimates for the year 2000 and projections for 2030.Diabetes Care. 2004; 27: 1047-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (11929) Google Scholar). Type 2 diabetes originates from β-cell failure to compensate insulin resistance and secrete the necessary amount of insulin to maintain glucose and lipid homeostasis (2.Poitout V. Amyot J. Semache M.

Tran P.O. Poitout V. Beta-cell glucose toxicity, lipotoxicity, and chronic oxidative stress in type 2 diabetes.Diabetes. 2004; 53: S119-S124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fine-tuning of insulin secretion in response to glucose and other nutrients relies on a balance of signals controlling dynamic variations in the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) (4.Gilon P. Chae H.Y. Rutter G.A. Ravier M.A. Calcium signaling in pancreatic beta-cells in health and in type 2 diabetes.Cell Calcium. 2014; 56: 340-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The major pathway for [Ca2+]c increase involves metabolism of glucose and other nutrients, which leads to ATP production and closure of the ATP-sensitive potassium channels. This in turn results in membrane depolarization and opening of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs), 2The abbreviations used are:VDCCvoltage-dependent Ca2+ channelAChacetylcholineBTP23,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)pyrazoleERendoplasmic reticulumDAGdiacylglycerolGSISglucose-stimulated insulin secretionhGHhuman growth hormoneIP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphateIP3RIP3 receptorPMplasma membraneSOCEstore-operated Ca2+ entrySOCstore-operated Ca2+ channelTgthapsigarginTRPCtransient receptor potential canonicalD+Vdiazoxide + verapamil. leading to a rapid elevation of [Ca2+]c, resulting in insulin exocytosis (4.Gilon P.

Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) is modulated by several hormones and neurotransmitters, among which acetylcholine (ACh) plays a prominent role (5.Gilon P. Henquin J.C. Mechanisms and physiological significance of the cholinergic control of pancreatic beta-cell function.Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 565-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). ACh binding to M3 muscarinic receptors stimulates the phospholipase C, which generates two second messengers, diacylglycerol (DAG), and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). DAG plays a key role in the activation of various protein kinase C isoforms, whereas IP3 binding to its receptor (IP3R) promotes the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (5.Gilon P.

ER Ca2+ store depletion is known to trigger Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane (PM) through a family of channels referred to as store-operated Ca2+ channels (SOCs) (6.Putney Jr., J.W. Cell biology: channelling calcium.Nature. 2001; 410: 648-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 7.Putney J.W. The physiological function of store-operated calcium entry.Neurochem. Res. 2011; 36: 1157-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It has been widely accepted that the store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) is a major and ubiquitous Ca2+ influx pathway in nonexcitable cells, necessary for the replenishment of intracellular Ca2+ stores (8.Parekh A.B. Putney Jr., J.W. Store-operated calcium channels.Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 757-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). Orai1 was identified as the main protein forming SOCs that conducts the previously called Ca2+ release-activated current (ICRAC) (9.Prakriya M. Feske S. Gwack Y. Srikanth S. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Orai1 is an essential pore subunit of the CRAC channel.Nature. 2006; 443: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). The activity of Orai1 channels is closely controlled by the ER membrane protein STIM1 (stromal interacting molecule 1), which functions as an ER Ca2+ sensor and translocates upon ER depletion to ER-PM regions of Orai1 clustering (10.Zhang S.L. Yu Y. Roos J. Kozak J.A. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Stauderman K.A. Cahalan M.D. STIM1 is a Ca2+ sensor that activates CRAC channels and migrates from the Ca2+ store to the plasma membrane.Nature. 2005; 437: 902-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). Some transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels are responsible for less selective store-operated currents carried by divalent and monovalent cations. Based on sequence similarity and function, the TRPC channel family is divided into two subgroups, TRPC1/4/5 as SOCs and TRPC3/6/7 as receptor-operated channels (11.Liao Y. Plummer N.W.

Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 3202-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Interestingly, TRPC1 has been shown to form STIM1-regulated SOCs together with Orai1 (12.Yuan J.P. Zeng W. Huang G.N.

Despite the prominent role of VDCCs in GSIS and [Ca2+]c dynamics, various aspects of the intracellular Ca2+ responses of β-cells to glucose and secretagogues are still unexplained, suggesting the involvement of additional plasmalemmal Ca2+ channels. Early studies indicate that the emptying of intracellular Ca2+ stores in β-cells induces SOCE (14.Miura Y. Henquin J.C. Gilon P.

Cells were then cultured for a 36-h recovery period before being collected or treated as indicated. Empty pmaxGFP or pcDNA3-YFP vectors were used as control to verify whether transfection itself could affect the Ca2+ response. For live cell imaging, INS-1E cells grown on glass-bottomed plates were placed in the on-stage incubator of a Zeiss LSM 710 Quasar Confocal inverted microscope (Zeiss, Germany). Photo excitation was achieved by illumination with the 488-nm line of the argon gas laser, and Z-stack time lapse image acquisition was performed using the accompanying Zen2009 software (Zeiss). Projection of Z-stack images was performed using ImageJ 1.48a software by maximum intensity projection of top to middle stack of the cell of interest. Static insulin secretion assays were performed in INS-1E cells in KRBH buffer (130 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 0.5 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm NaHCO3, 2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm CaCl2) as previously described (29.Allagnat F.

Perifusion experiments were performed using chambers developed in Prof. Raddatz's laboratory (30.Sabourin J. Robin E. Raddatz E. A key role of TRPC channels in the regulation of electromechanical activity of the developing heart.Cardiovasc. Res. 2011; 92: 226-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Groups of 20–30 islets were perifused at 37 °C with KRBH solution (1.6 mm glucose) at a flow rate of 500 μl/min for 30 min to establish stable basal insulin secretion. Then the glucose concentration was raised to 16.7 mm glucose, and fractions were collected every minute. Insulin release and content were measured using the rat insulin enzyme immunoassay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cayman Chemical, Adipogen AG, Liestal, Switzerland). To specifically assess the exocytosis activity of transfected cells only, we used a hGH secretion reporter assay, as previously described (28.Allagnat F. Alonso F. Martin D. Abderrahmani A. Waeber G.

INS-1E cells were transiently co-transfected with a construct encoding the hGH, together with an empty vector (pmaxGFP) as control, or a plasmid encoding mutant version of Orai1 or TRPC1. 48 h later, hGH secretion experiments were performed as in static insulin experiments. The hGH (secreted and content) levels were determined using the hGH ELISA kit (Roche Applied Sciences, Switzerland), and exocytosis activity expressed as the ratio of secreted hGH over hGH content. In most experiments, loading of the cells was performed at 25 °C in the dark in KRBH supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2, 20 mm glucose, and 3 μm Fura-2/AM plus 10% (w/v) Pluronic® F-127 (Life Technologies) for 40 min. Following loading, cells were washed and observed under a Zeiss inverted microscope (×40 oil immersion fluorescence objective). Fura-2-AM was excited at 340/380 nm with a Visichrome holographic monochromator, and emission fluorescence was monitored at 510 nm using a Hamamatsu Orca ER coded CCD camera. Images were treated with MetaFluor to evaluate the ratio of fluorescence emitted at 340 and 380 nm (Cellular Imaging Facility, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland). To study the thapsigargin or acetylcholine-activated Ca2+ entry, loaded cells were washed in Ca2+-free KRBH containing 0.1 mm EGTA and depleted with 5 μm thapsigargin (Tg) or 100 μm ACh in the presence of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel opener diazoxide (D; 250 μm) and of the VDCCs blocker verapamil (V; 10 μm). Subsequently, 2 mm Ca2+ (in the presence of diazoxide + verapamil (D+V)) was added to the medium, and the peak amplitude of the fluorometric signal was measured as the ΔF (340/380 nm ratio). ER Ca2+ depletion was calculated as the area under the curve based on the ΔF normalized to basal line over time in 0 mm Ca2+. Total RNA from INS-1E cells or freshly isolated rat islets were extracted using Tripure isolation reagent (Roche Diagnostics) and reverse-transcribed using the ImProm-2 reverse transcription System (Promega AG) as previously described (28.Allagnat F.

The membranes were revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence (EMD Millipore SAS) using the ChemiDocTM XRS+ System and analyzed using the accompanying proprietary program Image Lab (BETA2) version 3.0.01 (Bio-Rad). After lysis, 2 μg of antibody was added to a volume of lysates containing 300 μg of proteins diluted with 600 μl of NET solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40 (v/v)) and incubated at 4 °C overnight with constant mixing. Then the protein-antibody complex was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with constant mixing with 40 μl of protein A/G magnetic beads (Millipore). The immune complexes were collected with a magnetic stand and washed three times in NET, and samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The negative control were performed using lysates with beads (ctrl(−)) without any antibody. For technical reasons, it was not possible to perform immunoblotting of Orai1 because its molecular weight is approximately the same as the IgG light chain. The Duolink in situ proximity ligation assay (Olink Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden) is a sensitive method to detect protein-protein interaction in intact tissue using oligonucleotide-conjugated secondary antibodies that, when in close proximity, allow an in situ polymerization reaction (31.Söderberg O.

Direct observation of individual endogenous protein complexes in situ by proximity ligation.Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 995-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). INS-1E cells were fixed for 5 min in −20 °C acetone and processed according to manufacturer's instructions and as previously described (32.Alonso F. Boittin F.X. Bény J.L. Haefliger J.A.

The following antibodies were used to test protein-protein interaction: mouse anti-TRPC1 (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polyclonal goat anti-Orai1 (1:500; sc-74778; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and rabbit anti-STIM1 (1:1000; Sigma-Aldrich). The proximity ligation assay fluorescent signal was quantified using the ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) as follows: 30 images from 4 distinct experiments were converted to a 32-bit format, and the signal to noise ratio was determined by applying the Yen thresholding method. A binary image was then created, and the number of pixels of the duolink signal was measured. The data were normalized to the number of cells (nuclei imaged by DAPI staining) in each image. The data are presented as means ± S.E. Comparisons were performed by two-tailed unpaired Student's t test and between at least three groups with one-way or two-way analysis of variance completed by Fisher's least significant difference post hoc test for multiple comparisons. A p value of ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. To determine whether SOCs channels contribute to insulin secretion, 20–30 rat islets were placed in an islet perifusion chamber infused with KRBH supplemented with low (1.6 mm) followed by high (16.7 mm) glucose concentration, together or not with common SOCs inhibitors, SKF-96365 (SKF) or BTP2 (33.Bon R.S.

Pharmacol. 2013; 170: 459-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). SKF and BTP2 impeded the first peak (5–12 min) and nearly fully blocked the second phase (13–30 min) of GSIS (Fig. 1, A and B), thereby reducing total insulin release by about 70 and 60%, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B). Further static insulin secretion experiments performed in INS-1E cells confirmed that SKF and BTP2 partially inhibited insulin secretion induced by 16.7 mm glucose (Fig. 1C). ACh or the SERCA pump inhibitor Tg led to ER Ca2+ depletion and activation of SOCs, and potentiated GSIS in β-cells (4.Gilon P. Chae H.Y. Rutter G.A.

https://openalex.org/W2190678841,"TIM-3 (T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing protein 3) is a member of the TIM family of proteins that is preferentially expressed on Th1 polarized CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Recent studies indicate that TIM-3 serves as a negative regulator of T cell function (i.e. T cell dependent immune responses, proliferation, tolerance, and exhaustion). Despite having no recognizable inhibitory signaling motifs, the intracellular tail of TIM-3 is apparently indispensable for function. Specifically, the conserved residues Y265/Y272 and surrounding amino acids appear to be critical for function. Mechanistically, several studies suggest that TIM-3 can associate with interleukin inducible T cell kinase (ITK), the Src kinases Fyn and Lck, and the p85 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) adaptor protein to positively or negatively regulate IL-2 production via NF-κB/NFAT signaling pathways. To begin to address this discrepancy, we examined the effect of TIM-3 in two model systems. First, we generated several Jurkat T cell lines stably expressing human TIM-3 or murine CD28-ECD/human TIM-3 intracellular tail chimeras and examined the effects that TIM-3 exerts on T cell Receptor (TCR)-mediated activation, cytokine secretion, promoter activity, and protein kinase association. In this model, our results demonstrate that TIM-3 inhibits several TCR-mediated phenotypes: i) NF-kB/NFAT activation, ii) CD69 expression, and iii) suppression of IL-2 secretion. To confirm our Jurkat cell observations we developed a primary human CD8+ cell system that expresses endogenous levels of TIM-3. Upon TCR ligation, we observed the loss of NFAT reporter activity and IL-2 secretion, and identified the association of Src kinase Lck, and PLC-γ with TIM-3. Taken together, our results support the conclusion that TIM-3 is a negative regulator of TCR-function by attenuating activation signals mediated by CD3/CD28 co-stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2172408357,"The relationship between microRNA (miRNA) regulation and the specification of behavior is only beginning to be explored. We found that mutation of a single miRNA locus (miR-iab4/iab8) in Drosophila larvae affects the animal's capacity to correct its orientation if turned upside down (self-righting). One of the miRNA targets involved in this behavior is the Hox gene Ultrabithorax, whose derepression in two metameric neurons leads to self-righting defects. In vivo neural activity analysis reveals that these neurons, the self-righting node (SRN), have different activity patterns in wild type and miRNA mutants, whereas thermogenetic manipulation of SRN activity results in changes in self-righting behavior. Our work thus reveals a miRNA-encoded behavior and suggests that other miRNAs might also be involved in behavioral control in Drosophila and other species."
https://openalex.org/W2191375581,"Opioids are respiratory depressants and heroin/opioid overdose is a major contributor to the excess mortality of heroin addicts. The individual and situational variability of respiratory depression caused by intravenous heroin is poorly understood. This study used advanced respiratory monitoring to follow the time course and severity of acute opioid-induced respiratory depression. 10 patients (9/10 with chronic airflow obstruction) undergoing supervised injectable opioid treatment for heroin addiction received their usual prescribed dose of injectable opioid (diamorphine or methadone) (IOT), and their usual prescribed dose of oral opioid (methadone or sustained release oral morphine) after 30 minutes. The main outcome measures were pulse oximetry (SpO2%), end-tidal CO2% (ETCO2%) and neural respiratory drive (NRD) (quantified using parasternal intercostal muscle electromyography). Significant respiratory depression was defined as absence of inspiratory airflow >10s, SpO2% < 90% for >10s and ETCO2% per breath >6.5%. Increases in ETCO2% indicated significant respiratory depression following IOT in 8/10 patients at 30 minutes. In contrast, SpO2% indicated significant respiratory depression in only 4/10 patients, with small absolute changes in SpO2% at 30 minutes. A decline in NRD from baseline to 30 minutes post IOT was also observed, but was not statistically significant. Baseline NRD and opioid-induced drop in SpO2% were inversely related. We conclude that significant acute respiratory depression is commonly induced by opioid drugs prescribed to treat opioid addiction. Hypoventilation is reliably detected by capnography, but not by SpO2% alone. Chronic suppression of NRD in the presence of underlying lung disease may be a risk factor for acute opioid-induced respiratory depression."
https://openalex.org/W2173675591,"The lentiviruses HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) subvert intracellular membrane traffic as part of their replication cycle. The lentiviral Nef protein helps viruses evade innate and adaptive immune defenses by hijacking the adaptor protein 1 (AP-1) and AP-2 clathrin adaptors. We found that HIV-1 Nef and the guanosine triphosphatase Arf1 induced trimerization and activation of AP-1. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of the Nef- and Arf1-bound AP-1 trimer in the active and inactive states. A central nucleus of three Arf1 molecules organizes the trimers. We combined the open trimer with a known dimer structure and thus predicted a hexagonal assembly with inner and outer faces that bind the membranes and clathrin, respectively. Hexagons were directly visualized and the model validated by reconstituting clathrin cage assembly. Arf1 and Nef thus play interconnected roles in allosteric activation, cargo recruitment, and coat assembly, revealing an unexpectedly intricate organization of the inner AP-1 layer of the clathrin coat."
https://openalex.org/W1869236473,"Magnetic Particle Imaging (mpi) is an emerging imaging modality with exceptional promise for clinical applications in rapid angiography, cell therapy tracking, cancer imaging, and inflammation imaging. Recent publications have demonstrated quantitative mpi across rat sized fields of view with x-space reconstruction methods. Critical to any medical imaging technology is the reliability and accuracy of image reconstruction. Because the average value of the mpi signal is lost during direct-feedthrough signal filtering, mpi reconstruction algorithms must recover this zero-frequency value. Prior x-space mpi recovery techniques were limited to 1d approaches which could introduce artifacts when reconstructing a 3d image. In this paper, we formulate x-space reconstruction as a 3d convex optimization problem and apply robust a priori knowledge of image smoothness and non-negativity to reduce non-physical banding and haze artifacts. We conclude with a discussion of the powerful extensibility of the presented formulation for future applications."
https://openalex.org/W2132539854,"The historically-famous Lotus Fortress site, a deep 1.5–3.0-meter-high, 200-meter-long horizonal notch high up in near-vertical sandstone cliffs comprising the Cretaceous Jiaguan Formation, has been known since the 13th Century as an impregnable defensive position. The site is also extraordinary for having multiple tetrapod track-bearing levels, of which the lower two form the floor of part of the notch, and yield very well preserved asseamblages of ornithopod, bird (avian theropod) and pterosaur tracks. Trackway counts indicate that ornithopods dominate (69%) accounting for at least 165 trackmakers, followed by bird (18%), sauropod (10%), and pterosaur (3%). Previous studies designated Lotus Fortress as the type locality of Caririchnium lotus and Wupus agilis both of which are recognized here as valid ichnotaxa. On the basis of multiple parallel trackways both are interpreted as representing the trackways of gregarious species. C. lotus is redescribed here in detail and interpreted to indicate two age cohorts representing subadults that were sometimes bipedal and larger quadrupedal adults. Two other previously described dinosaurian ichnospecies, are here reinterpreted as underprints and considered nomina dubia. Like a growing number of significant tetrapod tracksites in China the Lotus Fortress site reveals new information about the composition of tetrapod faunas from formations in which the skeletal record is sparse. In particular, the site shows the relatively high abundance of Caririchium in a region where saurischian ichnofaunas are often dominant. It is also the only site known to have yielded Wupus agilis. In combination with information from other tracksites from the Jiaguan formation and other Cretaceous formations in the region, the track record is proving increasingly impotant as a major source of information on the vertebrate faunas of the region. The Lotus Fortress site has been developed as a spectacular, geologically-, paleontologically- and a culturally-significant destination within Qijiang National Geological Park."
https://openalex.org/W2229690984,"Exemplar-based algorithms are a popular technique for image inpainting. They mainly have two important phases: deciding the filling-in order and selecting good exemplars. Traditional exemplar-based algorithms are to search suitable patches from source regions to fill in the missing parts, but they have to face a problem: improper selection of exemplars. To improve the problem, we introduce an independent strategy through investigating the process of patches propagation in this paper. We first define a new separated priority definition to propagate geometry and then synthesize image textures, aiming to well recover image geometry and textures. In addition, an automatic algorithm is designed to estimate steps for the new separated priority definition. Comparing with some competitive approaches, the new priority definition can recover image geometry and textures well."

Intracellular accumulation of misfolded α1-antitrypsin Z in respiratory epithelial cells of the PiZ model resulted in activation of autophagy, leukocyte infiltration, and spontaneous pulmonary fibrosis severe enough to elicit functional restrictive deficits. Treatment with autophagy enhancer drugs or lung-directed gene transfer of TFEB, a master transcriptional activator of the autophagolysosomal system, reversed these proteotoxic consequences.

Tear film dynamics was assessed by Schirmer I test and by the non-invasive tear film breakup time (NI-BUT). All eyes were examined with a rotating Scheimpflug camera to assess keratoconus severity.KC patients had significatly decreased tear secretion and significantly higher ocular surface disease index (OSDI) scores compared to controls (5.3±2.2 vs. 13.2±2.0 mm and 26.8±15.8 vs. 8.1±2.3; p<0.001). There was no significant difference in NI-BUT between the two groups (KC: 9.8±4.8 vs. control: 10.7±3.8; p>0.05).

No correlation was found between age and mechanical, chemical, heat or cold thresholds in the patients with KC (p>0.05), whereas in the control subjects both mechanical (r = 0.52, p = 0.02), chemical (r = 0.47, p = 0.04), heat (r = 0.26, p = 0.04) and cold threshold (r = 0.40, p = 0.03) increased with age. In the KC group, neither corneal thickness nor tear flow, NI-BUT or OSDI correlated significantly with mechanical, chemical, heat or cold thresholds (p>0.05 for all variables).Corneal sensitivity to different types of stimuli is decreased in patients with keratoconus independently of age and disease severity. The reduction of the sensory input from corneal nerves may contribute to the onset of unpleasant sensations in these patients and might lead to the impaired tear film dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2155958443,"Insulin like growth factor 2 (Igf2) is known as a maternally imprinted gene involved in growth and development. Recently, Igf2 was found to also be regulated and required in the adult rat hippocampus for long-term memory formation, raising the question of its allelic regulation in adult brain regions following experience and in cognitive processes. We show that, in adult rats, Igf2 is abundantly expressed in brain regions involved in cognitive functions, like hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, compared to the peripheral tissues. In contrast to its maternal imprinting in peripheral tissues, Igf2 is mainly expressed from the maternal allele in these brain regions. The training-dependent increase in Igf2 expression derives proportionally from both parental alleles, and, hence, is mostly maternal. Thus, Igf2 parental expression in the adult rat brain does not follow the imprinting rules found in peripheral tissues, suggesting differential expression regulation and functions of imprinted genes in the brain."

https://openalex.org/W2110287850,"The ""weekend effect"" describes an increase in adverse outcomes for patients admitted at the weekend. Critical care units have moved to higher intensity working patterns to address this with some improved outcomes. However, support services have persisted with traditional working patterns. Blood cultures are an essential diagnostic tool for patients with sepsis but yield is dependent on sampling technique and processing. We therefore used blood culture yield as a surrogate for the quality of support service provision. We hypothesized that blood culture yields would be lower over the weekend as a consequence of reduced support services.We performed a retrospective observational study examining 1575 blood culture samples in a university hospital critical care unit over a one-year period.Patients with positive cultures had, on average, higher APACHE II scores (p = 0.015), longer durations of stay (p = 0.03), required more renal replacement therapy (p<0.001) and had higher mortality (p = 0.024). Blood culture yield decreased with repeated sampling with an increased proportion of contaminants. Blood cultures were 26.7% less likely to be positive if taken at the weekend (p = 0.0402). This effect size is the equivalent to the impact of sampling before and after antibiotic administration.Our study demonstrates that blood culture yield is lower at the weekend. This is likely caused by delays or errors in incubation and processing, reflecting the reduced provision of support services at the weekend. Reorganization of services to address the ""weekend effect"" should acknowledge the interdependent nature of healthcare service delivery."
https://openalex.org/W2132437478,"Herds of dugong, a largely tropical marine megaherbivore, are known to undertake long-distance movements, sequentially overgrazing seagrass meadows in their path. Given their drastic declines in many regions, it is unclear whether at lower densities, their grazing is less intense, reducing their need to travel between meadows. We studied the effect of the feeding behaviour of a small dugong population in the Andaman and Nicobar archipelago, India to understand how small isolated populations graze seagrasses. In the seven years of our observation, all recorded dugongs travelled either solitarily or in pairs, and their use of seagrasses was limited to 8 meadows, some of which were persistently grazed. These meadows were relatively large, contiguous and dominated by short-lived seagrasses species. Dugongs consumed approximately 15% of meadow primary production, but there was a large variation (3-40% of total meadow production) in consumption patterns between meadows. The impact of herbivory was relatively high, with shoot densities c. 50% higher inside herbivore exclosures than in areas exposed to repeated grazing. Our results indicate that dugongs in the study area repeatedly graze the same meadows probably because the proportion of primary production consumed reduces shoot density to levels that are still above values that can trigger meadow abandonment. This ability of seagrasses to cope perhaps explains the long-term site fidelity shown by individual dugongs in these meadows. The fact that seagrass meadows in the archipelago are able to support dugong foraging requirements allows us to clearly identify locations where this remnant population persists, and where urgent management efforts can be directed."
https://openalex.org/W2157776118,"The lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1) is a scavenger receptor responsible for ox-LDL recognition, binding and internalization, which is up-regulated during atherogenesis. Its activation triggers endothelium dysfunction and induces inflammation. A soluble form of LOX-1 has been identified in the human blood and its presence considered a biomarker of cardiovascular diseases. We recently showed that cholesterol-lowering drugs inhibit ox-LDL binding and internalization, rescuing the ox-LDL induced apoptotic phenotype in primary endothelial cells. Here we have investigated the molecular bases of human LOX-1 shedding by metalloproteinases and the role of cell membrane cholesterol on the regulation of this event by modulating its level with MβCD and statins. We report that membrane cholesterol affects the release of different forms of LOX-1 in cells transiently and stably expressing human LOX-1 and in a human endothelial cell line (EA.hy926). In particular, our data show that i) cholesterol depletion triggers the release of LOX-1 in exosomes as a full-length transmembrane isoform and as a truncated ectodomain soluble fragment (sLOX-1); ii) endothelial cells secrete a soluble metalloproteinase which induces LOX-1 ectodomain shedding and iii) long term statins treatment enhances sLOX-1 proteolytic shedding."
https://openalex.org/W2236120375,"Birch trees produce large amounts of highly allergenic pollen grains that are distributed by wind and impact human health by causing seasonal hay fever, pollen-related asthma, and other allergic diseases. Traditionally, pollen forecasts are based on conventional microscopic counting techniques that are labor-intensive and limited in the reliable identification of species. Molecular biological techniques provide an alternative approach that is less labor-intensive and enables identification of any species by its genetic fingerprint. A particularly promising method is quantitative Real-Time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), which can be used to determine the number of DNA copies and thus pollen grains in air filter samples. During the birch pollination season in 2010 in Mainz, Germany, we collected air filter samples of fine (<3 μm) and coarse air particulate matter. These were analyzed by qPCR using two different primer pairs: one for a single-copy gene (BP8) and the other for a multi-copy gene (ITS). The BP8 gene was better suitable for reliable qPCR results, and the qPCR results obtained for coarse particulate matter were well correlated with the birch pollen forecasting results of the regional air quality model COSMO-ART. As expected due to the size of birch pollen grains (~23 μm), the concentration of DNA in fine particulate matter was lower than in the coarse particle fraction. For the ITS region the factor was 64, while for the single-copy gene BP8 only 51. The possible presence of so-called sub-pollen particles in the fine particle fraction is, however, interesting even in low concentrations. These particles are known to be highly allergenic, reach deep into airways and cause often severe health problems. In conclusion, the results of this exploratory study open up the possibility of predicting and quantifying the pollen concentration in the atmosphere more precisely in the future."

https://openalex.org/W2120018986,"Acute febrile infections have historically been used to treat cancer. To explore the underlying mechanism, we studied chronic effects of fever on cancer cell growth and chemotherapeutic efficacy in cell culture. We found that culturing cancer cells at 39°C mildly inhibited cell growth by arresting the cells at the G1 phase of the cell cycle. When cells were seeded in culture dishes at a lower density, e.g. about 1000-2000 cells per 35-mm dish, the growth inhibition was much greater, manifested as many fewer cell colonies in the 39°C dishes, compared with the results at a higher density seeding, e.g. 20,000 cells per dish, suggesting that cell-cell collaboration as the Allee effect in cell culture is inhibited at 39°C. Withdrawal of cells from serum enhanced the G1 arrest at 39°C and, for some cell lines such as A549 lung cancer cells, serum replenishment failed to quickly drive the cells from the G1 into the S and G2-M phases. Therapeutic effects of several chemotherapeutic agents, including clove bud extracts, on several cancer cell lines were more potent at 39°C than at 37°C, especially when the cells were seeded at a low density. For some cell lines and some agents, this enhancement is long-lasting, i.e. continuing after the cessation of the treatment. Collectively these results suggest that hyperthermia may inhibit cancer cell growth by G1 arrest and by inhibition of cell-cell collaboration, and may enhance the efficacy of several chemotherapeutic agents, an effect which may persist beyond the termination of chemotherapy."

By random mutagenesis, we identified a mutant RhlBP238L that loses 75% of its ability to interact with PNPase but retains normal interaction with RNase E and RNA, in addition to exhibiting normal helicase activity. Applying microarray analyses to an E. coli strain with impaired RNA degradosome formation, we investigated the biological consequences of a weakened interaction between RhlB and PNPase. We found significant increases in 11 of 14 genes involved in cysteine biosynthesis. Subsequent Northern blot analyses showed that the up-regulated transcripts were the result of stabilization of the cysB transcript encoding a transcriptional activator for the cys operons.

https://openalex.org/W2126887426,"The main goal of this study was to predict, through the use of GIS tool as ecological niche modelling, potentially suitable ecological niche and defining the conditions of such niche for the representatives of the cosmopolitan genus Sirthenea. Among all known genera of the subfamily Peiratinae, only Sirthenea occurs on almost all continents and zoogeographical regions. Our research was based on 521 unique occurrence localities and a set of environmental variables covering the whole world. Based on occurrence localities, as well as climatic variables, digital elevation model, terrestrial ecoregions and biomes, information about the ecological preferences is given. Potentially useful ecological niches were modelled using Maxent software, which allowed for the creation of a map of the potential distribution and for determining climatic preferences. An analysis of climatic preferences suggested that the representatives of the genus were linked mainly to the tropical and temperate climates. An analysis of ecoregions also showed that they preferred areas with tree vegetation like tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biomes as well as temperate broadleaf and mixed forest biomes. Therefore, on the basis of the museum data on the species occurrence and ecological niche modelling method, we provided new and valuable information on the potentially suitable habitat and the possible range of distribution of the genus Sirthenea along with its climatic preferences."

In this study, we test the potential of CRISPR Csy4 RNA endoribonuclease for targeting HIV-1. We fused human codon-optimized Csy4 endoribonuclease with VPR, a HIV-1 viral preintegration complex protein. An HIV-1 cell model was modified to allow quantitative detection of active virus production. We found that the trans-expressing VPR-Csy4 almost completely blocked viral infection in two target cell lines (SupT1, Ghost). In the MAGI cell assay, where the HIV-1 LTR β-galactosidase is expressed under the control of the tat gene from an integrated provirus, VPR-Csy4 significantly blocked the activity of the provirus-activated HIV-1 reporter. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that Csy4 endoribonuclease is a promising tool that could be tailored further to target HIV-1."
https://openalex.org/W2273223342,"Myopia incidence in China is rapidly becoming a very serious sight compromising problem in a large segment of the general population. Therefore, delineating the underlying mechanisms leading to myopia will markedly lessen the likelihood of other sight compromising complications. In this regard, there is some evidence that patients afflicted with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), havean adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutation and a higher incidence of myopia. To clarify this possible association, we determined whether the changes in pertinent biometric and biochemical parameters underlying postnatal refractive error development in APCMin mice are relevant for gaining insight into the pathogenesis of this disease in humans. The refraction and biometrics in APCMin mice and age-matched wild-type (WT) littermates between postnatal days P28 and P84 were examined with eccentric infrared photorefraction (EIR) and customized optical coherence tomography (OCT). Compared with WT littermates, the APCMin mutated mice developed myopia (average -4.64 D) on P84 which was associated with increased vitreous chamber depth (VCD). Furthermore, retinal and scleral changes appear in these mice along with: 1) axial length shortening; 2) increased retinal cell proliferation; 3) and decreased tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression, the rate-limiting enzyme of DA synthesis. Scleral collagen fibril diameters became heterogeneous and irregularly organized in the APCMin mice. Western blot analysis showed that scleral alpha-1 type I collagen (col1α1) expression also decreased whereas MMP2 and MMP9 mRNA expression was invariant. These results indicate that defective APC gene function promotes refractive error development. By characterizing in APCMin mice ocular developmental changes, this approach provides novel insight into underlying pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to human myopia development."

The two lipases are structurally similar, yet they have different substrate specificities. PNLIP only cleaves neutral fats. PNLIPRP2 cleaves neutral and polar fats. To test the hypothesis that the differences in activity between PNLIP and PNLIPRP2 are governed by surface loops around the active site, we created multiple chimeras of both lipases by exchanging the surface loops singly or in combination. The chimeras were expressed, purified, and tested for activity against various substrates. The structural determinants of PNLIPRP2 galactolipase activity were contained in the N-terminal domain. Of the surface loops tested, the lid domain and the β5-loop influenced activity against triglycerides and galactolipids. Any chimera on PNLIP with the PNLIPRP2 lid domain or β5-loop had decreased triglyceride lipase activity similar to that of PNLIPRP2. The corresponding chimeras of PNLIPRP2 did not increase activity against neutral lipids. Galactolipase activity was abolished by the PNLIP β5-loop and decreased by the PNLIP lid domain.

The molecular mechanism for the differences in substrate specificity must be determined by specific structural domains in the individual lipases. Even with tremendous progress in understanding lipase function, the molecular details underlying the binding of a substrate molecule in the active site are limited. Much of our knowledge about pancreatic lipase substrate specificity comes from predictions based on the structures of human PNLIP co-crystallized with substrate analogs. The nucleophilic Ser-160 of PNLIP lies at the bottom of a 916-Å2 hydrophobic canyon, which appears well adapted for the binding of lipid substrates. The β5- and β9-loops and lid domain border the catalytic pocket (Fig. 1). Based on a structure of PNLIP containing a C11 alkyl phosphonate inhibitor, Egloff et al. (36.Egloff M.P. Marguet F. Buono G. Verger R. Cambillau C. van Tilbeurgh H. The 2.46 A resolution of the pancreatic lipase-colipase complex inhibited by a C11 alkyl phosphonate.Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2751-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) proposed a model for the binding of lipid substrates. In this model, the canyon contains binding sites for the sn-1 and sn-3 acyl chains of triglycerides. The sn-2 acyl chain, which is not cleaved by PNLIP, is predicted to remain in the lipid emulsion surface. One putative acyl chain-binding site is a hydrophobic channel formed by β9-loop residues Leu-231 and Phe-233 along with Tyr-132, Ala-196, and Pro-198. van Tilbeurgh et al. (19.van Tilbeurgh H. Egloff M.P. Martinez C. Rugani N. Verger R. Cambillau C. Interfacial activation of the lipase-procolipase complex by mixed micelles revealed by x-ray crystallography.Nature. 1993; 362: 814-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar) reported the structure of the PNLIP-colipase complex containing phosphatidylcholine in the active site and noted contacts of the sn-1 acyl chain with these same residues. The other acyl chain-binding site consisted of side chains from residues 269–277 in the lid domain and Ile-96 from the β5-loop. Phe-94 in the β5-loop likely contributes to the oxyanion hole in the active site. Structures of PNLIPRP2 with substrate or substrate analogs are not available. However, the crystal structure of human PNLIPRP2 with the lid domain in the open conformation was recently described (24.Eydoux C. Spinelli S. Davis T.L. Walker J.R. Seitova A. Dhe-Paganon S. De Caro A. Cambillau C. Carrière F. Structure of human pancreatic lipase-related protein 2 with the lid in an open conformation.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 9553-9564Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In general, the overall structure of PNLIPRP2 superimposes well with the open conformation of PNLIP. Closer inspection of the structures that include the active site (the β5-loop, β9-loop, and the lid domain) reveals several features pertinent to the differences in substrate specificity (Fig. 1, C and D). First, the PNLIPRP2 lid domain is quite mobile, whereas the PNLIP lid is stable in the closed or open position. Second, several residues in the PNLIPRP2 β5-loop were present at different positions when compared with the analogous region of PNLIP. The position of Leu-97, which corresponds to Leu-96 in PNLIP, could alter the interaction with the acyl chain of bound substrate. Both Glu-91 and Asp-92 occupy different positions in PNLIPRP2 compared with the corresponding residues in PNLIP, Glu-90 and Glu-91. In particular, the position of the Cα carbon atoms of Asp-92 in PNLIPRP2 and Glu-91 in PNLIP differs by 4.7 Å. Consequently, the hydrogen bond observed in PNLIP between Glu-91 and Trp-260 in the open lid does not exist in PNLIPRP2. The conformation of Glu-91 and Asp-92 in PNLIPRP2 could influence the binding of the polar headgroup of phospholipids or galactolipids in the active site of PNLIPRP2. In addition, the conformation of the β9-loop shows differing conformations of several side chains crucial to acyl chain binding. Two hydrophobic residues from the PNLIP β9-loop, Leu-231 and Phe-233, interact with the alkyl chain of a phosphonate inhibitor and likely stabilize the acyl-enzyme intermediate formed during lipolysis (36.Egloff M.P. Marguet F. Buono G. Verger R. Cambillau C. van Tilbeurgh H. The 2.46 A resolution of the pancreatic lipase-colipase complex inhibited by a C11 alkyl phosphonate.Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2751-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). These residues are conserved in all pancreatic lipases, but whereas Phe-233 of PNLIP and Phe-234 of PNLIPRP2 superimpose well, the Cα carbons of Leu-232 in PNLIPRP2 and Leu-231 in PNLIP are 3.4 Å apart. These findings suggest the hypothesis that the β5- and β9-loops and the lid domain contribute to the differences in substrate specificity between PNLIP and PNLIPRP2. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by creating chimeric proteins by exchanging the respective β5- and β9-loops and the lid domain between human PNLIP and PNLIPRP2. We expressed and purified the chimeras and determined their activity against short-, medium-, and long-chain triglycerides and against a galactolipid, digalactosyldiacylglycerol. We found that the lid domain and the β5-loop influence substrate specificity significantly. The cDNAs encoding for mature human PNLIP and PNLIPRP2 and for PNLIP/PNLIPRP2 and PNLIPRP2/PNLIP chimeras were amplified by regular and overlap PCR, respectively. The amplified cDNAs were subcloned into the yeast protein expression vector pHILSI, in which lipase native secretion signal peptide was replaced by the yeast PHO1 secretion peptide (Invitrogen). All other domain swap mutations were introduced into the parent cDNA in the pHILS1 vector using XL QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All of the DNA constructs were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. All recombinant lipase proteins were produced in Pichia pastoris yeast strain GS 115 following the manufacturer's manual (Invitrogen). Each plasmid DNA was linearized by BglII and purified by phenol chloroform method. The competent yeast cells were transformed with purified DNAs by electroporation, and the resultant yeast transformants were screened by lipase activity assay and/or immunoblot analysis of culture medium after 24 h of methanol induction as described previously (31.Xiao X. Mukherjee A. Ross L.E. Lowe M.E. Pancreatic lipase-related protein-2 (PLRP2) can contribute to dietary fat digestion in human newborns.J. Biol.

Human pancreatic triglyceride lipase expressed in yeast cells: purification and characterization.Protein Expr. Purif. 1998; 13: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All proteins were robustly secreted indicating that the chimeras were not misfolded. One highly expressing colony for each of the recombinant lipases was then used to produce a large quantity of recombinant protein (31.Xiao X. Mukherjee A. Ross L.E. Lowe M.E.

Human pancreatic triglyceride lipase expressed in yeast cells: purification and characterization.Protein Expr. Purif. 1998; 13: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). After 24–48 h of methanol induction, cell-free culture medium was clarified by filtration and concentrated to ∼50 ml over a Pellicon XL Biomax 10 membrane (Millipore). The concentrated protein sample was then dialyzed at 4 °C overnight against distilled H2O containing 2 mm benzamidine. Each recombinant lipase protein was purified to homogeneity by one-step chromatography using a Mono S FPLC column (GE Healthcare) according to the protocols described previously (31.Xiao X. Mukherjee A. Ross L.E. Lowe M.E. Pancreatic lipase-related protein-2 (PLRP2) can contribute to dietary fat digestion in human newborns.J. Biol.

Human pancreatic triglyceride lipase expressed in yeast cells: purification and characterization.Protein Expr. Purif. 1998; 13: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Fractions of purified lipase were evaluated and analyzed by lipase activity assay and 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel staining using GelCode Blue Stain Reagent (Pierce). The pooled purified recombinant protein was then concentrated and buffer-exchanged to 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Protein concentration was determined by spectrophotometry at 280 nm. The extinction coefficient of each lipase was calculated using ProtParam program at EXPASY. The final yield ranged from 10 to 40 mg/liter for all of the purified proteins. The homogeneity and integrity of each purified lipase protein was verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel staining. The activity of lipases was determined in bulk by measuring the release of fatty acids from mechanically stirred emulsions of tributyrin, trioctanoin, or triolein as described previously (38.Cordle R.A. Lowe M.E. The hydrophobic surface of colipase influences lipase activity at an oil-water interface.J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1759-1767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Yang Y. Lowe M.E. The open lid mediates pancreatic lipase function.J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 48-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, the assay was conducted with or without 5 m excess of purified recombinant human colipase. The lipolytic activities are expressed in international lipase units per mg of enzyme. One unit corresponds to 1 μmol of fatty acid released per min. Galactolipase activity was also determined using the standard 5-min pH Stat method. However, only 5 mg of digalactosyldiacylglyceride (Larodan Fine Chemicals, Sweden) was emulsified in 15 ml of the standard assay buffer containing 4 mm sodium taurodeoxycholate (NaTDC), and 3 μg of purified recombinant lipase was included. Colipase did not affect the galactolipase activity in the assays; therefore, it was not included. The interactions of lipases with colipase were assayed by adapting the method described previously (40.Crandall W.V. Lowe M.E. Colipase residues Glu64 and Arg65 are essential for normal lipase-mediated fat digestion in the presence of bile salt micelles.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12505-12512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The assays were performed by measuring lipase activity over a range of colipase concentrations (0–53 nm) with a constant concentration of lipase (2.6 nm) and excess substrate (180 mm trioctanoin) in 4 mm NaTDC assay buffer in a total volume of 15 ml. Because PNLIP and PNLIPRP2 have distinct N- and C-terminal domains, we constructed chimeras of PNLIP and PNLIPRP2 to determine whether one or both of these domains contributes to substrate specificity. One chimera contained the PNLIP N-terminal domain and the PNLIPRP2 C-terminal domain (PNLIP/PNLIPRP2), and the other chimera included the PNLIPRP2 N-terminal domain and the PNLIP C-terminal domain (PNLIPRP2/PNLIP). Both were expressed in P. pastoris and purified in a single step. We then tested activity against triglycerides with varying acyl chain lengths and against digalactosyldiacylglycerol in various concentrations of NaTDC with and without colipase. First, we tested activity against tributyrin, trioctanoin, and triolein emulsified in 4 mm NaTDC in the presence of a 5-fold molar excess of colipase (Fig. 2). As expected, the activity of PNLIP decreased with increasing acyl chain length, and the activity of PNLIP was significantly higher than the activity of PNLIPRP2 for all substrates. Of note, both of the chimeras had activities that were comparable with the activity of PNLIPRP2 for each of the substrates. These results suggest that the structures of the PNLIPRP2 N- and C-terminal domain influence activity more than the corresponding domains from PNLIP. To better understand the effects of the PNLIPRP2 domains on the activity of the chimeric lipases, we determined the activity of all four lipases against tributyrin, trioctanoin, and triolein in various concentrations of NaTDC with and without a 5 m excess of colipase (Fig. 3). As reported before, PNLIPRP2 had lower activity against tributyrin than PNLIP, and the activity of PNLIPRP2 was not stimulated by colipase as was the case with PNLIP (Fig. 3, left-hand panels). The activity of the PNLIP/PNLIPRP2 chimera was intermediate between the activity of PNLIP and PNLIPRP2 (Fig. 3). Like PNLIP, the PNLIP/PNLIPRP2 chimera was completely inhibited at 4 mm NaTDC. Similarly, colipase stimulated the activity of the PNLIP/PNLIPRP2 chimera but did not restore the activity in 4 mm NaTDC to the level of activity in 0.5 mm NaTDC as it did with PNLIP. The PNLIPRP2/PNLIP chimera had an activity curve and colipase response similar to that of PNLIPRP2 (Fig. 3). In the absence of colipase, increasing NaTDC concentrations did not completely inhibit the PNLIPRP2/PNLIP chimera similar to the results with PNLIPRP2. With trioctanoin, the PNLIP/PNLIPRP2 chimera had about 2-fold higher activity than PNLIPRP2, but the activity was 9-fold lower than PNLIP (Fig. 3, middle panels). PNLIPRP2 and PNLIPRP2/PNLIP had similar activity (Fig. 3, middle panels). Increasing concentrations of NaTDC inhibited all four lipases, and colipase restored activity. As observed in the tributyrin assays, colipase increased PNLIP activity in 4 mm NaTDC to the level measured in 0.5 mm NaTDC. Colipase-stimulated activity of PNLIPRP2, PNLIP/PNLIPRP2, and PNLIPRP2/PNLIP did not reach the levels measured in 0.5 mm NaTDC. With triolein, the activity of the two chimeras was similar to the activity of PNLIPRP2 (Fig. 3, right-hand panels). The activity of PNLIP was about 10-fold higher than the activity of the other lipases. For all lipases, micellar concentrations of TDC inhibited activity, and colipase restored the activity to the level measured below the critical micellar concentration for TDC (1.9 mm). As reported previously, PNLIPRP2 required oleic acid to overcome a long lag time (31.Xiao X. Mukherjee A. Ross L.E. Lowe M.E. Pancreatic lipase"

https://openalex.org/W2101584803,"We present a dynamic network model of corrupt and noncorrupt employees representing two states in the public and private sector. Corrupt employees are more connected to one another and are less willing to change their attitudes regarding corruption than noncorrupt employees. This behavior enables them to prevail and become the majority in the workforce through a first-order phase transition even though they initially represented a minority. In the model, democracy—understood as the principle of majority rule—does not create corruption, but it serves as a mechanism that preserves corruption in the long run. The motivation for our network model is a paradox that exists on the labor market. Although economic theory indicates that higher risk investments should lead to larger rewards, in many developed and developing countries workers in lower-risk public sector jobs are paid more than workers in higher-risk private sector jobs. To determine the long-run sustainability of this economic paradox, we study data from 28 EU countries and find that the public sector wage premium increases with the level of corruption."
https://openalex.org/W2107608054,"Steroid hormones organize many aspects of development, including that of the nervous system. Steroids also play neuromodulatory and other activational roles, including regulation of sensitivity to painful stimuli in mammals. In Drosophila, ecdysteroids are the only steroid hormones, and therefore the fly represents a simplified model system in which to explore mechanisms of steroid neuromodulation of nociception. In this report, we present evidence that ecdysteroids, acting through two isoforms of their nuclear ecdysone receptor (EcR), modulate sensitivity to noxious thermal and mechanical stimuli in the fly larva. We show that EcRA and EcRB1 are expressed by third instar larvae in the primary nociceptor neurons, known as the class IV multidendritic neurons. Suppression of EcRA by RNA interference in these cells leads to hyposensitivity to noxious stimulation. Suppression of EcRB1 leads to reduction of dendritic branching and length of nociceptor neurons. We show that specific isoforms of the ecdysone receptor play critical cell autonomous roles in modulating the sensitivity of nociceptor neurons and may indicate human orthologs that represent targets for novel analgesic drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2155984052,"Background Sibling sex ratios have been applied as an indirect test of a hypothesized association between prenatal testosterone levels and risk for autism, a developmental disorder disproportionately affecting males. Differences in sibling sex ratios between those with and without autism would provide evidence of a shared risk factor for autism and offspring sex. Conclusions related to prenatal testosterone, however, require additional assumptions. Here, we used directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to clarify the elements required for a valid test of the hypothesis that sibling sex ratios differ between children with and without autism. We then conducted such a test using a large, population-based sample of children. Methods Over 1.1 million subjects, born in California from 1992–2007, and identified through birth records, were included. The association between autism diagnosis, determined using the administrative database of the California Department of Developmental Services, and the sex of the subsequent sibling was examined using generalized estimating equations. Sources of potential bias identified using DAGs were addressed. Results Among male children with autism, 52.2% of next-born siblings were brothers, versus 51.0% for unaffected males. For females with autism, 50.2% of following siblings were brothers versus 51.2% among control females. The relative risk of a subsequent male sibling associated with autism diagnosis was 1.02 (95% confidence interval: 0.99, 1.04). Conclusions In a large, population-based sample we failed to find evidence suggesting an excess of brothers among children with autism while controlling for several threats to validity. This test cannot rule out a role of any given exposure, including prenatal testosterone, in either risk of autism or offspring sex ratio, but suggests against a common cause of both."

https://openalex.org/W2153014705,"Due to being derived from linear assumption, most elastic body based non-rigid image registration algorithms are facing challenges for soft tissues with complex nonlinear behavior and with large deformations. To take into account the geometric nonlinearity of soft tissues, we propose a registration algorithm on the basis of Newtonian differential equation. The material behavior of soft tissues is modeled as St. Venant-Kirchhoff elasticity, and the nonlinearity of the continuum represents the quadratic term of the deformation gradient under the Green- St.Venant strain. In our algorithm, the elastic force is formulated as the derivative of the deformation energy with respect to the nodal displacement vectors of the finite element; the external force is determined by the registration similarity gradient flow which drives the floating image deforming to the equilibrium condition. We compared our approach to three other models: 1) the conventional linear elastic finite element model (FEM); 2) the dynamic elastic FEM; 3) the robust block matching (RBM) method. The registration accuracy was measured using three similarities: MSD (Mean Square Difference), NC (Normalized Correlation) and NMI (Normalized Mutual Information), and was also measured using the mean and max distance between the ground seeds and corresponding ones after registration. We validated our method on 60 image pairs including 30 medical image pairs with artificial deformation and 30 clinical image pairs for both the chest chemotherapy treatment in different periods and brain MRI normalization. Our method achieved a distance error of 0.320±0.138 mm in x direction and 0.326±0.111 mm in y direction, MSD of 41.96±13.74, NC of 0.9958±0.0019, NMI of 1.2962±0.0114 for images with large artificial deformations; and average NC of 0.9622±0.008 and NMI of 1.2764±0.0089 for the real clinical cases.

https://openalex.org/W2158457862,"Objective This administrative data-linkage cohort study examines the association between prison crowding and the rate of post-release parole violations in a random sample of prisoners released with parole conditions in California, for an observation period of two years (January 2003 through December 2004). Background Crowding overextends prison resources needed to adequately protect inmates and provide drug rehabilitation services. Violence and lack of access to treatment are known risk factors for drug use and substance use disorders. These and other psychosocial effects of crowding may lead to higher rates of recidivism in California parolees. Methods Rates of parole violation for parolees exposed to high and medium levels of prison crowding were compared to parolees with low prison crowding exposure. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using a Cox model for recurrent events. Our dataset included 13070 parolees in California, combining individual level parolee data with aggregate level crowding data for multilevel analysis. Results Comparing parolees exposed to high crowding with those exposed to low crowding, the effect sizes from greatest to least were absconding violations (HR 3.56 95% CI: 3.05–4.17), drug violations (HR 2.44 95% CI: 2.00–2.98), non-violent violations (HR 2.14 95% CI: 1.73–2.64), violent and serious violations (HR 1.88 95% CI: 1.45–2.43), and technical violations (HR 1.86 95% CI: 1.37–2.53). Conclusions Prison crowding predicted higher rates of parole violations after release from prison. The effect was magnitude-dependent and particularly strong for drug charges. Further research into whether adverse prison experiences, such as crowding, are associated with recidivism and drug use in particular may be warranted."

Later, after some missteps and struggles in high school, professors at Manchester Community College conspired to change my life course from high school dropout to Ph.D. holder. One of them was my first algebra teacher. On the first day of class, she wrote on the board, “You CAN do math.” “You may not believe that now,” she told us, “but you will by the end of this semester with me.”

> “None of this would have been possible without the encouragement I received.” 

She taught me that I could learn things even if they were hard, and that I didn't need to know them instinctively. When I transferred to the University of Connecticut for my bachelor's degree in molecular and cellular biology, this principle served me well in the 200-person introductory “weed-out” courses.

I thought that I would be a technician at a pharmaceutical company after graduation, so I worked in various labs on campus to gain the critical hands-on experience I would need. But my career trajectory took a turn during the last semester of my undergraduate education, when my lab adviser encouraged me to consider going to graduate school for a Ph.D.

I hardly even knew what grad school was, but once she opened my eyes to the possibilities, and we came up with a funding strategy, I was hooked on the idea.

Getting my Ph.D. was the first step on my circuitous route toward a professional life that I could never have imagined. I did a postdoc and worked on technology transfer and in university administration before starting my own business and management consulting firm, 32ATPs. I entered the political arena with a 1-year appointment as Utah's state science adviser. In this role, I shepherded a precious allotment from the state legislature of 10 million hard-won dollars for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. I then started the R&D arm of 32ATPs and recently cofounded my second startup, EduPaper Products, where I pursue my passion of making STEM education accessible to everyone.

None of this would have been possible without the encouragement I received throughout my schooling and in my professional career. Study after study shows that, beginning in early childhood and continuing throughout college, girls are typically discouraged from entering STEM fields, and I was lucky to be an exception.

I have worked to pay it forward by acting as a mentor for girls and women in STEM, passing on the advice that has worked for me:

I still need advice, too. I stay in touch with many of my mentors, and I find new mentors through state- and federal-level professional services. These days, I worry just as much about giving back to my mentors as I do about learning from them, and I am honored when my grad school mentors ask me for help. Mentorship, I like to say, works up, down, and sideways.
