https://openalex.org/W2017177010,"Activin, a member of the transforming growth factor beta protein family, was originally isolated from gonadal fluids and stimulates the release of pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Activin has numerous functions in both normal and neoplastic cells. Various cells synthesize activin and have a specific binding site for this peptide. However, the molecular basis for its actions is unknown. A binding protein for activin was purified from rat ovary and was identical to follistatin, a specific inhibitor of FSH release. It is likely that the binding protein participates in the diverse regulatory actions of activin."

https://openalex.org/W2084619563,"Major epidemic outbreaks of viral hepatitis in underdeveloped countries result from a type of non-A, non-B hepatitis distinct from the parenterally transmitted form. The viral agent responsible for this form of epidemic, or enterically transmitted non-A, non-B hepatitis (ET-NANBH), has been serially transmitted in cynomolgus macaques (cynos) and has resulted in typical elevation in liver enzymes and the detection of characteristic virus-like particles (VLPs) in both feces and bile. Infectious bile was used for the construction of recombinant complementary DNA libraries. One clone, ET1.1, was exogenous to uninfected human and cyno genomic liver DNA, as well as to genomic DNA from infected cyno liver. ET1.1 did however, hybridize to an approximately 7.6-kilobase RNA species present only in infected cyno liver. The translated nucleic acid sequence of a portion of ET1.1 had a consensus amino acid motif consistent with an RNA-directed RNA polymerase; this enzyme is present in all positive strand RNA viruses. Furthermore, ET1.1 specifically identified similar sequences in complementary DNA prepared from infected human fecal samples collected from five geographically distinct ET-NANBH outbreaks. Therefore, ET1.1 represents a portion of the genome of the principal viral agent, to be named hepatitis E virus, which is responsible for epidemic outbreaks of ET-NANBH."
https://openalex.org/W2050992506,"Certain RNA molecules, called ribozymes, possess enzymatic, self-cleaving activity. The cleavage reaction is catalytic and no energy source is required. Ribozymes of the ""hammerhead"" motif were identified in plant RNA pathogens. These ribozymes possess unique secondary (and possibly tertiary) structures critical for their cleavage ability. The present study shows precise cleavage of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) sequences in a cell-free system by hammerhead ribozymes. In addition to the cell-free studies, human cells stably expressing a hammerhead ribozyme targeted to HIV-1 gag transcripts have been constructed. When these cells were challenged with HIV-1, a substantial reduction in the level of HIV-1 gag RNA relative to that in nonribozyme-expressing cells, was observed. The reduction in gag RNA was reflected in a reduction in antigen p24 levels. These results suggest the feasibility of developing ribozymes as therapeutic agents against human pathogens such as HIV-1."
https://openalex.org/W2148426299,"p56lck, a lymphocyte-specific member of the src family of cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinases, is associated noncovalently with the cell surface glycoproteins CD4 and CD8, which are expressed on functionally distinct subpopulations of T cells. Using transient coexpression of p56lck with CD4 or CD8 alpha in COS-7 cells, we show that the unique N-terminal region of p56lck binds to the membrane-proximal 10 and 28 cytoplasmic residues of CD8 alpha and CD4, respectively. Two cysteine residues in each of the critical sequences in CD4, CD8 alpha, and p56lck are required for association. Our results suggest a novel role for cysteine-mediated interactions between unrelated proteins and provide a model for the association of other src-like cytoplasmic kinases with transmembrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2053912690,"The function of the heart depends critically on an adequate oxygen supply through the coronary arteries. Coronary arteries dilate when the intravascular oxygen tension decreases. Hypoxic vasodilation in isolated, perfused guinea pig hearts can be prevented by glibenclamide, a blocker of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium channels, and can be mimicked by cromakalim, which opens ATP-sensitive potassium channels. Opening of potassium channels in coronary smooth muscle cells and the subsequent drop in intracellular calcium is probably the major cause of hypoxic and ischemic vasodilation in the mammalian heart."
https://openalex.org/W2092093169,"The 11-kD protease (PR) encoded by the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) is essential for the correct processing of viral polyproteins and the maturation of infectious virus, and is therefore a target for the design of selective acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) therapeutics. To facilitate the identification of novel inhibitors of HIV-1 PR, as well as to permit detailed studies on the enzymology and inhibition of this enzyme, a continuous assay for its activity was developed that was based on intramolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer (RET). The assay used the quenched fluorogenic substrate 4-(4-dimethylaminophenylazo)benzoic acid (DABCYL)--Ser Gln Asn Tyr Pro Ile Val Gln--5-[(2-aminoethyl)amino]naphthalene-1 sulfonic acid (EDANS), whose peptide sequence is derived from a natural processing site for HIV-1 PR. Incubation of recombinant HIV-1 PR with the fluorogenic substrate resulted in specific cleavage at the Tyr-Pro bond and a time-dependent increase in fluorescence intensity that was linearly related to the extent of substrate hydrolysis. An internally quenched fluorogenic substrate was also designed that was selectively cleaved by the related PR from avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV). The fluorescence quantum yields of the HIV-1 PR and AMV PR substrates in the RET assay increased by 40.0- and 34.4-fold, respectively, per mole of substrate cleaved. Because of its simplicity, rapidity, and precision in the determination of reaction rates required for kinetic analysis, this method offers many advantages over the commonly used high-performance liquid chromatography- or electrophoresis-based assays for peptide substrate hydrolysis by retroviral PRs."
https://openalex.org/W1484647033,"Arachidonoyl-hydrolyzing phospholipase A2 plays a central role in providing substrate for the synthesis of the potent lipid mediators of inflammation, the eicosanoids, and platelet-activating factor. Although Ca2+ is required for arachidonic acid release in vivo and most phospholipase A2 enzymes require Ca2+ for activity in vitro, the role of Ca2+ in phospholipase A2 activation is not understood. We have found that an arachidonoyl-hydrolyzing phospholipase A2 from the macrophage-like cell line, RAW 264.7, exhibits Ca2(+)-dependent association with membrane. The intracellular distribution of the enzyme was studied as a function of the Ca2+ concentration present in homogenization buffer. The enzyme was found almost completely in the 100,000 x g soluble fraction when cells were homogenized in the presence of Ca2+ chelators and there was a slight decrease in soluble fraction activity when cells were homogenized at the level of Ca2+ in an unstimulated cell (80 nM). When cells were homogenized at Ca2+ concentrations expected in stimulated cells (230-450 nM), 60-70% of the phospholipase A2 activity was lost from the soluble fraction and became associated with the particulate fraction in a manner that was partly reversible with EGTA. Membrane-associated phospholipase A2 activity was demonstrated by [3H]arachidonic acid release both from exogenous liposomes and from radiolabeled membranes. With radiolabeled particulate fraction as substrate, this enzyme hydrolyzed arachidonic acid but not oleic acid from membrane phospholipid, and [3H]arachidonic acid was derived from phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylinositol/phosphatidylserine. We suggest a mechanism in which the activity of phospholipase A2 is regulated by Ca2+: in an unstimulated cell phospholipase A2 is found in the cytosol; upon receptor ligation the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration increases, and the enzyme becomes membrane-associated which facilitates arachidonic acid hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2041214001,"We have analyzed alternatively spliced beta amyloid protein precursor (beta APP) mRNAs by using the polymerase chain reaction to amplify beta APP cDNAs produced by reverse transcription. With this approach the three previously characterized beta APP mRNAs (beta APP695, beta APP751, and beta APP770) are readily detected and compared in RNA samples extracted from specimens as small as a single cryostat section. We show that the results obtained with this method are not affected by partial RNA degradation and use it to identify a novel alternatively spliced beta APP714 mRNA that is present at low abundance in each of the many human brain regions, peripheral tissues, and cell lines that we have examined; demonstrate that nonneuronal cells in the adult human brain and meninges produce appreciable beta APP695, beta APP751, and beta APP770 mRNA; and identify changes in beta APP gene expression in the AD brain and meninges that may contribute to amyloid deposition."
https://openalex.org/W1966792552,"The nucleosome is the fundamental unit of assembly of the chromosome and reversible modifications of the histones have been suggested to be important in many aspects of nucleosome function. The structure-function relations of the amino-terminal domain of yeast histone H4 were examined by the creation of directed point mutations. The four lysines subject to reversible acetylation were essential for histone function as the substitution of arginine or asparagine at these four positions was lethal. No single lysine residue was completely essential since arginine substitutions at each position were viable, although several of these mutants were slower in completing DNA replication. The simultaneous substitution of glutamine for the four lysine residues was viable but conferred several phenotypes including mating sterility, slow progression through the G2/M period of the division cycle, and temperature-sensitive growth, as well as a prolonged period of DNA replication. These results provide genetic proof for the roles of the H4 amino-terminal domain lysines in gene expression, replication, and nuclear division."
https://openalex.org/W2078530966,"B lymphocytes do not secrete IgM, and plasma cells only secrete IgM polymers. Here we show that both events are attributable to the tailpiece found at the carboxyl terminus of μs chains, and we specifically implicate Cys-575. Thus, if Cys-575 was mutated, IgM was secreted by B cells. Similarly, a mutant IgG containing a μs tailpiece became largely retained within the cell; secretion was restored upon mutation of the tailpiece cysteine. Removal of Cys-575 also allowed hypersecretion of monomeric IgM by plasmacytoma cells. Following further removal of Cμ1, heavy chains were secreted in the absence of light chains. Thus, in B and plasma cells, Cys-575 is involved both in the polymerization of IgM and in intracellular retention of unpolymerized intermediates."
https://openalex.org/W1493670259,"Gonadal steroids affect brain function primarily by altering the expression of specific genes, yet the specific mechanisms by which neuronal target genes undergo such regulation are unknown. Recent evidence suggests that the expression of the neuropeptide gene for oxytocin (OT) is modulated by estrogens. We therefore examined the possibility that this regulation occurred via a direct interaction of the estrogen-receptor complex with cis-acting elements flanking the OT gene. DNA-mediated gene transfer experiments were performed using Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells and chimeric plasmids containing portions of the human OT gene 5'-glanking region linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. We identified a 19-base pair region located at -164 to -146 upstream of the transcription start site which is capable of conferring estrogen responsiveness to the homologous as well as to a heterologous promoter. The hormonal response is strictly dependent on the presence of intracellular estrogen receptors, since estrogen induced stimulation occurred only in Neuro-2a cells co-transfected with an expression vector for the human estrogen receptor. The identified region contains a novel imperfect palindrome (GGTGACCTTGACC) with sequence similarity to other estrogen response elements (EREs). To define cis-acting elements that function in synergism with the ERE, sequences 3' to the ERE were deleted, including the CCAAT box, two additional motifs corresponding to the right half of the ERE palindrome (TGACC), as well as a CTGCTAA heptamer similar to the elegans box found in Caenorhabditis elegans. Interestingly, optimal function of the identified ERE was fully independent of these elements and only required a short promoter region (-49 to +36). Our studies define a molecular mechanism by which estrogens can directly modulate OT gene expression. However, only a subset of OT neurons are capable of binding estrogens, therefore, direct action of estrogens on the OT gene may be restricted to a subpopulation of OT neurons."

Cell breakage using glass beads was followed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and two high-performance liquid chromatography steps involving anion-exchange and hydroxyapatite. The PS I core complex has an apparent molecular mass of 300 +/- 20 kDa (including a detergent shell of about 50 kDa) and contains subunits of approximately 60, approximately 60, 18.5, 18.5, 16, 15, 10.5, 9.5, and 6.5 kDa as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblots; its antenna size is 75 +/- 5 chlorophyll/P-700. The PS II core complex has an apparent molecular mass of 310 +/- 20 kDa (including the detergent shell); subunits of 43, 37, 33, 29, and 10-11 kDa were identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. The antenna size of the average PS II complex is 45 +/- 5 chlorophyll/primary quinone electron acceptor (QA). This preparation procedure also yields, as a byproduct, a highly purified cytochrome b6f complex. This complex contains four subunits of 38, 24, 19, and 15 kDa and b- and c-type cytochromes in a ratio of 2:1. Its apparent molecular mass of 180 +/- 20 kDa (including the detergent shell) is consistent with a monomeric complex."

https://openalex.org/W2062525807,"During fruiting body development, the product of the csgA gene is necessary for cellular aggregation, for spore differentiation, and for gene expression that is initiated after 6 hr of starvation. From nascent wildtype fruiting bodies we have purified a polypeptide of 17 kd called C-factor, which, at approximately 1 to 2 nM, restores normal development to csgA mutant cells. C-factor activity is not recovered from extracts of unstarved, growing cells or csgA mutant cells. The amino acid sequence from purified C-factor demonstrates that it is the product of the csgA gene. C-factor is active over a narrow range of concentration and has properties of a morphogenetic paracrine signal."
https://openalex.org/W1540332208,"Surfactant protein D (SP-D, CP4) is a collagenous surfactant-associated glycoprotein synthesized by lung type II epithelial cells. SP-D can be selectively and efficiently eluted from isolated rat surfactant with glucose, maltose, and certain other saccharides. We therefore examined the ability of the purified protein to interact with carbohydrates in vitro. Saccharide-substituted bovine serum albumins (BSA neoglycoproteins) were adsorbed to plastic wells, and binding of purified SP-D was quantified with monospecific antibodies to SP-D using an indirect immunoassay. SP-D showed specific calcium-dependent binding to alpha-D-glucosidophenyl isothiocyanate-BSA and maltosyl-BSA, but negligible binding to beta-D-glucosidophenyl isothiocyanate-BSA or unconjugated BSA. The most efficient inhibitors of SP-D binding were alpha-glucosyl-containing saccharides (e.g. isomaltose, maltose, malotriose). SP-D showed quantitative binding to maltosyl-agarose and was specifically eluted with maltose or EDTA. High affinity binding to maltosyl-BSA was also demonstrated using a solution-phase polyethylene glycol precipitation assay. These studies demonstrate that SP-D is a calcium dependent lectin-like protein and that the association of SP-D with surfactant is mediated by carbohydrate-dependent interactions with specificity for alpha-glucosyl residues."
https://openalex.org/W2105370088,"Multimerization of GAAANN generates sequences frequent in virus-inducible promoters. We distinguished different types of (GAAANN)4 sequences mediating virus inducibility. Type I (NN = GT, GC, CT, or CC) responds to IFNs and to IRF-1 and causes silencing. Type II (NN = TG) and type III (NN = CG) neither silence nor respond to IRF-1 or IFN. Type III mediates constitutive transcription and binds the constitutive IEFga factor, whereas type II binds the novel “TG protein‡. IFN-β and IFN-α1 promoters contain different response elements: The former has a type I-like sequence (PRDI) and an NF-κB-binding sequence (PRDII); the latter has a type II-like “TG sequence” and possibly additional elements but does not bind NF-κB. Type I, type II, and NF-κB elements represent three distinct terminal pathways mediating virus induction."

https://openalex.org/W1515547441,"To begin to understand the regulation and roles of neurofilament phosphorylation, we localized the phosphorylated domains on the 140-145-kDa neurofilament subunit (NF-M) and identified the protein kinases that may specifically phosphorylate the sites within these domains in vivo. Mouse retinal ganglion cells were labeled in vivo by injecting mice intravitreally with [32P]orthophosphate, and neurofilament-enriched fractions were obtained from the optic axons. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide map analysis of NF-M after digestion with alpha-chymotrypsin and trypsin revealed seven major (M8-M14) and at least eight minor (M1-M7 and M15) phosphopeptides. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide map analyses of NF-M phosphorylated in vitro by individual purified or endogenous axonal cytoskeleton-associated protein kinases showed that five peptides (M9-M13) were substrates for the heparin-sensitive second messenger-independent protein kinase(s). Protein kinase A and/or protein kinase C phosphorylated eight other peptides (M1-M8). Two alpha-chymotryptic peptides (C1 and C2) that were phosphorylated by protein kinase A but not by the endogenous independent kinase(s) were isolated by high performance liquid chromatography on a reverse-phase C8 column. Partial sequence analysis of peptides C1 (S R V S G P S ...) and C2 (S R G S P S T V S ...) showed that the peptides were localized on the head domain of NF-M at 25 and 41 residues from the amino terminus, respectively. Tryptic digest of peptide C1 (less than 12 kDa) generated the phosphopeptides M1-M6. Peptide C2 was a breakdown product of peptide C1. Since the polypeptide sites targeted by second messenger-independent kinase(s) associated with neurofilaments are localized on the carboxyl-terminal domain, separate aspects of NF-M function appear to be regulated by separate kinase systems that selectively phosphorylate head or tail domains of the polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1496145129,"The cDNA encoding a murine UDP-Gal:beta-D-Gal-alpha 1,3-galactosyltransferase has recently been cloned and sequenced using a transient expression method (Larsen, R.D., Rajan, V.P., Ruff, M.M., Kukowska-Latallo, J., Cummings, R.D., and Lowe, J.B. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86, 8227-8231). This report describes the construction and analysis of a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line in which in vitro expression alpha 1,3-galactosyltransferase activity has been achieved via transfer and expression of the murine alpha 1,3-galactosyltransferase gene. A primary aim of this research was to explore the role of the alpha 1,3-galactosyltransferase in regulating glycoprotein and glycolipid biosynthesis. CHO cells were cotransfected with murine genomic DNA fragments from F9 cells and plasmid DNA containing a resistance gene to the antibiotic G418. Cells resistant to G418 were then selected for expression of surface glycoconjugates containing terminal alpha 1,3-galactosyl residues by isolating cells bound to immobilized Griffonia simplicifolia-I-B4, a lectin which binds to alpha 1,3-galactosyl residues. A positive, stable transfectant clone, designated Clone 3, was obtained and analyzed for expression of the murine of alpha 1,3-galactosyltransferase. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting demonstrated that Clone 3, but not parental, CHO cells bound significant amounts of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled G. simplicifolia-I-B4. Southern and Northern blot analyses using the murine alpha 1,3-galactosyltransferase cDNA demonstrated that clone 3, but not parental, CHO cells contain murine alpha 1,3-galactosyltransferase genomic DNA sequences, and express a homologous transcript that comigrates with the authentic 3.6 kilobase alpha 1,3-galactosyltransferase murine mRNA. Enzyme assays confirmed that clone 3, but not parental CHO cells, contained the alpha 1,3-galactosyltransferase activity and that the level of activity is comparable to that found in F9 cells. [3H]Galactose-labeled glycopeptides and glycolipids were obtained from metabolically radiolabeled parental and Clone 3 cells and were analyzed for the presence of terminal alpha 1,3-galactosyl residues. Complex-type, Asn-linked oligosaccharides from both parental and Clone 3 cells contain the repeating disaccharide [3Gal beta 1, 4GlcNAc beta 1]n or poly-N-acetyllactosamine sequences, but only the poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains from clone 3 cells contained the terminal sequence Gal alpha 1,3Gal beta 1,4GlcNAc beta 1-R.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2039635859,"Senile plaques are a characteristic feature in brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and aged monkeys. The principal component of amyloid in senile plaques is beta/A4, a peptide derived from a larger amyloid precursor protein (APP). To date, several alternatively spliced APP transcripts have been described. The relationship between levels of these APP mRNAs and amyloid deposition is unclear. In this study, we directly measured the relative levels of APP transcripts that lack the protease inhibitor domain (APP-695) and transcripts that encode the inhibitor sequences (APP-751/770). Our results indicate that the expression of APP mRNAs is not selectively altered in AD cortex. Moreover, the differential expression of APP transcripts is not correlated with the deposition of amyloid in cases of AD and aged monkeys. These findings suggest that other factors, not directly related to the relative expression of APP mRNAs, may contribute to amyloidogenesis in the brain."

https://openalex.org/W1510582501,"Phosphorylation of glucocorticoid receptors is increased by hormone binding and has been implicated in transcriptional regulation. We performed a phosphoamino acid analysis and identified the phosphorylated regions of the glucocorticoid receptor with respect to its functional domains before and after hormone activation. Receptor was isolated by immunoprecipitation from [32P]orthophosphate-labeled FTO 2B rat hepatoma cells grown in the absence or presence of glucocorticoids. The receptor contained mainly phosphoserine, with little phosphothreonine and no phosphotyrosine. Partial proteolysis of receptor from hormone-treated or control cells revealed a similar phosphopeptide pattern. Chemical cleavage with hydroxylamine and cyanogen bromide or digestion with trypsin and chymotrypsin localized the majority of receptor phosphorylation sites to a transactivation domain amino-terminal of the DNA-binding domain. Phosphorylation of this region, termed tau 1/enh2, was increased 2-3-fold by hormone treatment. The DNA-binding domain itself is weakly phosphorylated; no phosphorylation was found in the hormone-binding domain. Phosphorylated regions were also identified in receptor deletion mutants stably transfected into CV-1 monkey kidney cells. Hormone-independent phosphorylation was observed with a strong constitutively active mutant lacking the hormone-binding domain. No phosphorylation was detected in a mutant lacking the amino-terminal region, which showed only weak, hormone-dependent activity. These results support the idea that phosphorylation is important for the strength of the glucocorticoid receptor as a transcriptional regulator."
https://openalex.org/W2097136804,"Many stimuli (e.g., neurotransmitters and electrical activity) regulate neuromorphogenesis by changing intracellular calcium. The ionophore A23187 was employed as a receptor-independent method to investigate neuronal calcium homeostasis. Distinctive neuron-specific (B5 versus B19) and state-specific (growing versus non-growing) differences in calcium homeostasis were observed in cultured identified Helisoma neurons. Fura-2 studies revealed that A23187 induced a transient rise in intracellular calcium in growing neurons B5 but a sustained rise in growing neurons B19. In stable-state (non-growing) cells A23187 evoked only a transient calcium rise. Both neuron-specific and state-specific differences in calcium homeostasis were dependent on extracellular sodium. Morphological studies also indicated that such differences in calcium-regulatory capacity can have profound consequences on the generation and degeneration of neuronal architecture."
https://openalex.org/W1597335111,"The coat protein of bacteriophage MS2 is a translational repressor. It inhibits the synthesis of the viral replicase by binding a specific RNA structure that contains the replicase translation initiation region. In order to begin a genetic dissection of the repressor activity of coat protein, a two-plasmid system has been constructed that expresses coat protein and a replicase-beta-galactosidase fusion protein from different, compatible plasmids containing different antibiotic-resistant determinants. The coat protein expressed from the first plasmid (pCT1) represses synthesis of a replicase-beta-galactosidase fusion protein encoded on the other plasmid (pRZ5). Mutations in the translational operator or in coat protein result in constitutive synthesis of the enzyme. This permits the straightforward isolation of mutations in the coat sequence that affect repressor function. Because of the potential importance of cysteine residues for RNA binding, mutations were constructed that substitute serines for the cysteine residues normally present at positions 46 and 101. Both of these mutations result in translational repressor defects. Chromatographic and electron microscopic analyses indicate that the plasmid-encoded wild-type coat protein forms capsids in vivo. The ability of the mutants to adopt and/or maintain the appropriate conformation was assayed by comparing them to the wild-type protein for their ability to form capsids. Both mutants exhibited evidence of improper folding and/or instability as indicated by their aberrant elution behavior on a column of Sepharose CL-4B. Methods were developed for the rapid purification of plasmid-encoded coat protein, facilitating future biochemical analyses of mutant coat proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1487867154,"Bacillus subtilis has two different riboflavin synthases characterized by the subunit structures alpha3 (light enzyme) and alpha3beta60 (heavy enzyme). The light enzyme was purified by a novel procedure with increased yield and excellent reproducibility. The proposed trimer structure was confirmed by cross-linking experiments with dimethyl suberimidate. Fragments of alpha subunits were prepared by cleavage with cyanogen bromide, trypsin, protease Lys-C, and Staphylococcus aureus protease V8, respectively. Sequences were determined by automated liquid or gas phase Edman degradation. The complete sequence (202 amino acids) was established by direct sequencing of the N terminus and sequencing of overlapping peptides. The sequence shows marked internal homology between the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal half encompassing 26 identical positions and 23 conservative replacements. This suggests that the protomer forms two structurally similar domains. Since it is known that the enzyme has two binding sites per subunit for the substrate 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine, it appears likely that each of the homologous protein domains provides one binding site. The stereochemical features of the enzyme mechanism and the structural relation of the alpha trimer to the beta60 capsid of heavy riboflavin synthase suggest that the six domains corresponding to the alpha subunit trimer are related by pseudo 32 symmetry."

https://openalex.org/W1511156361,"Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity is known to be strongly enhanced in mammalian cells by a sudden reduction in ambient osmolality. The effect of hypoosmotic shock on the regulation of ODC protein and mRNA levels was studied in a variant L1210 mouse leukemia cell line (D-R cells) which expresses ODC at greater than or equal to 100-fold higher levels than the parental cells. Hypoosmotic stress increased ODC activity in proportion with the osmotic gradient imposed to both D-R cells and their normal counterparts. A 60% decrease in medium osmolality increased ODC activity and the amount of immunoreactive ODC protein from 20- to 30-fold after 4 h without any detectable change in ODC mRNA contents in D-R cells. ODC induction was sustained up to 48 h after hypoosmotic shock, with maximal activity levels being observed at 24 h. Hypotonic shock dramatically increased (up to 36-fold) the rate of ODC synthesis as measured by 10-min pulses with 35S-labeled methionine, in agreement with kinetic constants predicted from the changes observed for the enzyme activity. Moreover, hypoosmotic stress extended the half-life of ODC activity from 35 +/- 10 to 212 +/- 67 min and blocked any degradation of the radiolabeled immunoreactive protein, which had a half-life of 28 +/- 6 min under isotonic conditions, for at least 120 min after addition of cycloheximide. The induction of ODC by hypoosmotic stress was quickly reversed by a sudden upshift of osmolality through a very rapid inhibition of ODC biosynthesis and an increase in the rate of enzyme degradation. Thus, hypoosmotic stress activates the expression of ODC exclusively through post-transcriptional mechanisms in D-R cells. The osmotically induced accumulation of ODC molecules is quite unique as shown by the fact that ODC is the major protein (approximately 25% of total) synthesized during the first 4 h following a 60% hypotonic shock, despite a 30-50% reduction of the rate of labeled precursor incorporation into soluble proteins."

Dominant easter alleles increase the number of cells that give rise to lateral and ventral structures. We have found that nine dominant and four recessive mutations are caused by single amino acid substitutions at conserved sites in the putative serine protease catalytic domain. The activity of dominant products was assayed by injecting in vitro synthesized transcripts from the dominant alleles into young embryos. The results suggest that the dominant easter products cleave the normal substrate, but fail to respond to a spatially asymmetric regulator."
https://openalex.org/W89307538,"We have previously demonstrated that a monoclonal antibody (5F7) directed against the heavy chain region of factor XI inhibits the binding of factor XI to high molecular weight kininogen (high Mr kininogen) and the surface-mediated proteolytic activation of factor XI by factor XIIa in the presence of high Mr kininogen. In order to identify the structural domain of factor XI that binds high Mr kininogen, CNBr-digested factor XI was passed over a 5F7 antibody affinity column. One of two CNBr peptides that bound to this 5F7 affinity column inhibited binding of 125I-factor XI to high Mr kininogen, as did intact factor XI. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate of an inhibitory peptide purified by high performance liquid chromatography revealed an Mr of 10,000-15,000. Gas-phase sequencing of this peptide revealed the following amino-terminal sequence: X-X-Val-Thr-Gln-Leu-Leu-Lys-Asp-Thr. These data together with the amino acid composition of the isolated peptide indicate that both the epitope recognized by antibody 5F7 and at least a portion of the high Mr kininogen binding site are contained within the amino-terminal portion of factor XI comprising residues Glu-1 through Met-102. Further cleavage of this peptide with o-iodosobenzoic acid at a tryptophanyl peptide bond revealed that an Mr 5,000 peptide (with the amino-terminal sequence Trp-Phe-Thr-Cys-Val-Leu) bound to a high Mr kininogen affinity column and inhibited binding of 125I-factor XI to high Mr kininogen. Finally, a synthetic peptide comprising residues Phe-56 through Ser-86 inhibited 125I-factor XI binding to high Mr kininogen. These experiments strongly suggest that the high Mr kininogen binding site is contained within the domain in the heavy chain region of factor XI comprising residues Phe-56 through Ser-86."
https://openalex.org/W1587914816,"By using an in vitro system for the translocation of secretory proteins in Escherichia coli, detailed and quantitative studies were performed as to the function of the positively charged amino acid residues at the amino terminus of the signal peptide. Uncleavable OmpF-Lpp, a model secretory protein carrying an uncleavable signal peptide, and mutant proteins derived from it were used as translocation substrates. When the positive charge, +2 (LysArg) for the wild-type, was changed to 0, -1, or -2, little or no translocation was observed. The number of the positive charge was altered by introducing different numbers of Lys or Arg residues into the amino terminus. The rate of translocation was roughly proportional to this number, irrespective of whether the charged amino acid residues were Lys or Arg. When the amino-terminal LysArg was replaced by His residues, translocation took place more efficiently at pH 6.5 than pH 8.0, whereas that of the wild-type was about the same as the two pH values. We conclude that the signal peptide requires a positive charge at its amino-terminal region to function in the translocation reaction and that the rate of translocation is roughly proportional to the number of the positively charged group, irrespective of the amino acid species that donates the charge. Evidence suggesting that the positive charge is involved in the binding of precursor proteins to the membrane surface to initiate translocation is also presented."
https://openalex.org/W1964692954,"In Drosophila, two Ca2+-activated K+ currents, ICF and ICS, have previously been distinguished in conventional voltage clamp experiments. The slowpoke(slo) mutation eliminates IcF specifically. We report that in patch clamp recordings a single-channel Ca2+-activated K+ current is readily distinguished from other channel activities in normal larval muscle membrane, whereas no such current is observed in slo muscles. This single channel current thus correlates with the macroscopic ICF. No obvious differences in amplitude or properties were detected between normal (+/+) and heterozygous (slo/+) ICF channels in whole-cell voltage clamp recordings or single-channel patch clamp recordings. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that slo is a structural gene for the IcF channels only under certain conditions. The selective effect of the slo mutation may reflect a defect in a regulatory mechanism that is specific for the functioning of the IcF channel protein."
https://openalex.org/W2117700302,"Two major Ca2(+)-binding glycoproteins Mr 120,000 and 100,000 were isolated from 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid -solubilized bovine heart sarcolemma membrane. Peroxidase-conjugated concanavalin A and wheat germ agglutinin lectins bind strongly to the isolated 120- and 100-kDa glycoproteins. Treatment with endoglycosidase F resulted in conversion of the 120-kDa glycoprotein to a form migrating at about 97 kDa. Treatment of the 100-kDa band with endoglycosidase F produced form of about 80 kDa. Endoglycosidase H digestion removes only 5% of the mass of both glycoproteins. the carbohydrate structure of both glycoproteins, is therefore, predicted to be at least 75% complex structure and 25% high mannose or hybrid structure. The 120- and 100-kDa glycoproteins are the major Ca2(+)-binding proteins in the sarcolemma membranes. Intact and endoglycosidase-treated glycoproteins bind 45Ca2+ as analyzed by a 45Ca2+ overlay technique. Using polyclonal antibodies, the 120- and 100-kDa glycoproteins were identified in muscle plasma membranes (ventricles, atria, and uterus smooth muscle). They were, however, not present in non-muscle tissues such as pancreas, liver, and kidney. The 120- and 100-kDa glycoproteins appear to be homologous molecules as judged by their similar V8 protease peptide maps, cross-reactivity with polyclonal antibody, and other physicochemical properties."
https://openalex.org/W1490176412,"Cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, the cytochrome P-450-dependent and rate-controlling enzyme of bile acid synthesis, was purified from rat and human liver microsomes. The purified fractions were assayed in a reconstituted system containing [4-14C]cholesterol, and cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activities in these fractions increased 500-600-fold relative to whole microsomes. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of rat microsomes followed by immunoblotting with polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against purified cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylases revealed two peaks at molecular masses of 47,000 and 49,000 daltons for both rat and human fractions. Increasing amounts of rabbit anti-rat and anti-human antibodies progressively inhibited rat microsomal cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity up to 80%. In contrast, monospecific antibodies raised against other purified cytochrome P-450 enzymes (P-450f, P-450g, and P-450j) did not inhibit rat or human cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity. Immunoblots of rat microsomes with the rabbit anti-rat cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase antibody demonstrated that the antibody reacted quantitatively with the rat microsomal enzyme. Microsomes from cholesterol-fed rats showed increased cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase mass, whereas treatment with pravastatin, an inhibitor of hydroxy-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, reduced enzyme mass. Microsomes from starved rats contained slightly less cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase protein than chow-fed control rats. These results indicate a similarity in molecular mass, structure, and antigenicity between rat and human cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylases; demonstrate the production of inhibiting anti-cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase antibodies that can be used to measure the change in cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase enzyme mass under various conditions; and emphasize the unique structure of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase with respect to other cytochrome P-450-dependent hydroxylases."
https://openalex.org/W1557948040,"To explore bidirectional regulatory interactions between interferons and autocrine polypeptide factors, we examined the modulation of expression of transforming growth factor-alpha and 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase activity in A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells after treatment with interferon-gamma and transforming growth factor-alpha. Treatment of A431 cells with interferon-gamma increased steady state levels of transforming growth factor-alpha mRNA by 4-fold and increased the levels of transforming growth factor-alpha in the culture medium. There were additive growth inhibitory effects upon coaddition of exogenous transforming growth factor-alpha and interferon-gamma to the cultures. Addition of transforming growth factor-alpha to A431 cell cultures in the absence of interferon could stimulate the induction of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase activity by more than 2-fold. These findings demonstrate that the induction of transforming growth factor-alpha in interferon-gamma-treated A431 cells could act to regulate interferon-induced gene(s), e.g. 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase, suggesting interactions between a potential autocrine growth factor and the interferon system in the growth regulation of A431 cells."
https://openalex.org/W64624572,"Follitropin (FSH) receptors were solubilized from pure light membranes of bovine calf testis, using an optimum detergent to protein ratio of 0.01. The soluble FSH receptor fraction was gel filtered through Sepharose 6B to isolate an active fraction (6B-Fr-1) which behaved as a complex of FSH receptor and Gs protein. The 6B-Fr-1 was concentrated by ultrafiltration and further purified by sequential Sepharose 4B gel filtration, DEAE-cellulose chromatography (to separate the receptor from Gs protein), and wheat germ lectin affinity chromatography. The purified receptor had an FSH-binding capacity of approximately 3.47 nmol/mg of protein with a Kd of 1.9 X 10(-10) M. Yield was 526 micrograms/11.5 kg tested. Radioiodinated, as well as unlabeled purified FSH receptor, migrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels as a single major band of Mr approximately 240,000. This band was not affected by 8 M urea treatment prior to analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, but treatment with dithiothreitol induced the loss of the 240-kDa band, with appearance of an Mr approximately 60,000 band. The availability of highly purified, stable FSH receptor should allow direct studies on its structure-function relationships."
https://openalex.org/W1235313216,"We have used a reconstitution assay to demonstrate that protein translocation activity can be recovered after microsomal vesicles derived from the rough endoplasmic reticulum have been partially solubilized with n-octyl-beta-glucopyranoside. Two independent approaches were used to establish conditions for partially solubilizing microsomal membranes. When the lipid bilayer was disrupted by detergents to the extent that the integrity of the lipid bilayer had been perturbed, membranes were inactive for translocation. However, detergent-treated membranes could be reconstituted in good yield into a translocation competent form once the detergent was removed."
https://openalex.org/W1572294100,"Incubation of adenylosuccinate synthetase from Escherichia coli with low concentrations of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) resulted in a rapid loss of activity (92%), concomitant with the formation of a Schiff base. The inactivation of the enzyme by PLP is apparently first order with respect to PLP. The pseudo-first order rate constant, Kapp, showed a hyperbolic dependence on the concentration of PLP, indicating that a kinetically significant PLP.enzyme intermediate is formed during the inactivation process. Stoichiometry and peptide isolation studies showed that 2 lysine residues were modified during reaction of the enzyme with PLP. The three substrates of adenylosuccinate synthetase (GTP, IMP, and aspartate) showed different effects in their ability to protect the enzyme against PLP inactivation. Complete protection of the enzyme against inactivation can be observed only in the presence of high concentrations of GTP. One lysine residue was protected under these conditions. In contrast to GTP, addition of the other two substrates either alone or together to reaction mixtures did not render protection. Peptide mapping by digesting the enzyme with trypsin revealed that the lysine shielded by GTP is Lys140. Replacing the Lys140 with Ile140 by site-directed mutagenesis resulted in total loss of the activity. These results suggest that Lys140 may play an important role in enzymatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1526939348,"The structure, biosynthesis, and metabolism of proteoglycans in the HL-60 human promyelocytes were studied by metabolic labeling in culture with [35S]sulfate, [3H]glucosamine, [3H]serine, and [3H]leucine. These cells synthesize a single predominant species of intracellular proteoglycan with an approximate molecular weight of 100,000. The cells contain about 1 microgram of proteoglycan/million cells. The proteoglycan is turned over within the cells in two apparent pools with half-lives of about 0.6 and 27 h, respectively. The fast pool represents secretion into medium in an apparently intact form, whereas the slow pool represents intracellular degradation to free chondroitin sulfate chains and smaller fragments. The proteoglycan contains a protein core with an apparent Mr on gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of about 20,000-30,000. To the core protein are attached an average of six or seven chondroitin sulfate chains, each with an Mr of about 10,000. The chondroitin sulfate chains contain approximately 85% 4-sulfated and approximately 15% nonsulfated disaccharides. The chondroitin sulfate attachment region of the core protein is essentially resistant to trypsin and elastase, whereas the remainder of the protein core is readily degraded by proteases. The size of the chondroitin sulfate attachment region peptide generated by trypsin was estimated to be approximately 5 kDa. Based on the molecular size, distribution of amino acids, protease susceptibility, and the extent of O-glycosylation, we propose that the intracellular proteoglycan characterized in this study is the translation product of a proteoglycan gene reported to be present in these cells (Stevens, R.L., Avraham, S., Gartner, M.C., Bruns, G.A., Austen, K.E., and Weis, J.H.

https://openalex.org/W128062084,"Cytoplasmic free Ca2+ (Ca2+i) was chelated to 10-20 nM in the macrophage cell line J774 either by incubation with quin2 acetoxymethyl ester in the absence of external Ca2+ (Di Virgilio, F., Lew, P.D., and Pozzan, T. (1984) Nature 310, 691-693) or by loading [ethyl-enebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid (EGTA) into the cytoplasm via reversible permeabilization of the plasma membrane with extracellular ATP (Steinberg, T.H., Newman, A.S., Swanson, J.A., and Silverstein, SS.C. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 8884-8888; Di Virgilio, F., Meyer, B.C., Greenberg, S., and Silverstein, S.C. (1988) J. Cell Biol. 106, 657-666). After removal of ATP from the incubation medium, ATP-permeabilized Ca2+i-depleted macrophages recovered a near-normal plasma membrane potential which slowly depolarized over a 2-4 h incubation at low [Ca2+]i. In both ATP-treated and quin2-loaded cells, depolarization of plasma membrane potential was paralleled by an increase in plasma membrane permeability to low molecular weight aqueous solutes such as eosin yellowish (Mr 692), ethidium bromide (Mr 394), and lucifer yellow (Mr 463). This increased plasma membrane permeability was not accompanied by release of the cytoplasmic marker lactic dehydrogenase for incubations up to 4 h and was likely a specific effect of Ca2+i depletion since it was not caused by: (i) the mere incubation of macrophages with extracellular EGTA, i.e. at near-normal [Ca2+]i; and (ii) loading into the cytoplasm of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, a specific chelator of heavy metals with low affinity for Ca2+. Treatment of Ca2+i-depleted cells with direct (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) or indirect (platelet-activating factor) activators of protein kinase C prevented the increase in plasma membrane permeability. Down-regulation of protein kinase C rendered Ca2+i-depleted macrophages refractory to the protective effect of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. This report suggests a role for Ca2+i and possibly protein kinase C in the regulation of plasma membrane permeability to low molecular weight aqueous solutes."
https://openalex.org/W1516490917,"To examine the nature of the factors influencing the galactosylation pattern of the heavy chain of murine immunoglobulin G (IgG), cell fusion was performed between a myeloma (P3x63Ag8) and a hybridoma (Sp2HL/Bu) cell line which secrete different IgGs possessing structurally distinct CH2-linked oligosaccharide moieties. The glycosylation patterns of the IgGs of the parental and fused cells were studied. Pronase digestion of the purified heavy chains and subsequent end labeling with fluorescein isothiocyanate produced fluoresceinated glycopeptides which were detected and purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Structural information was obtained by enzymatic digestion, lectin affinity chromatography, and methylation analysis. IgGs from both parental lines possessed oligosaccharide units displaying microheterogeneity based upon a common symmetrical biantennary structure terminating in beta-GlcNAc. The structures of both IgGs, however, differed in the pattern of the mono- and digalactosylated components. Clones, selected following the fusion of the parental cells, were expanded; and the individual IgGs were purified. All clones produced homodimeric IgG1 and IgG2b as well as heterodimeric IgG possessing both the gamma 1 and gamma 2b heavy chains. Analysis of the carbohydrate moieties of the gamma 1 chain from the homodimeric and heterodimeric IgGs and of the gamma 2b chain from the heterodimeric molecule demonstrates that the polypeptide structure of the heavy chain influences the terminal galactosylation of the glycan unit at the conserved site of glycosylation of IgGs."

https://openalex.org/W1481163793,"In the present report, we demonstrate that Tb3+ binds to protein kinase C and serves as a luminescent reporter of certain cationic metal-binding sites. Tb3+ titration of 50 nM protein kinase C results in a 20-fold enhancement of Tb3+ luminescence which is half-maximal at 12 microM Tb3+. A Kd of approximately 145 nM was determined for Tb3+ binding to the enzyme. The excitation spectrum of bound Tb3+ exhibits a peak at 280 nm characteristic of energy transfer from protein tryptophan or tyrosine residues. The luminescence of this complex can be markedly decreased by other metals, including Pb2+ (IC50 = 25 microM), La3+ (IC50 = 50 microM), Hg2+ (IC50 = 300 microM), Ca2+ (IC50 = 6 mM), and Zn2+ (IC50 greater than 10 mM), and chelation of Tb3+ by 2 mM EGTA. Tb3+ binding to protein kinase C is correlated with its inhibition of protein kinase activity (IC50 = 8 microM), r = 0.99) and phorbol ester binding (IC50 = 15 microM, r = 0.98). Tb3+ inhibition of protein kinase C activity cannot be overcome by excess Ca2+, but can be partially overcome with excess phosphatidylserine or by chelation of Tb3+ with EGTA. Tb3+ noncompetitively inhibits phorbol ester binding by decreasing the maximal extent of binding without significantly altering binding affinity. The results suggest that the Tb3(+)-binding site is at or allosterically related to the enzyme's phosphatidylserine-binding site, but is distinct from the phorbol ester-binding domain and the Ca2(+)-binding site that regulates enzyme activity."
https://openalex.org/W1852700547,"Factor VIII circulates in noncovalent complex with von Willebrand factor (vWf). The topography of this complex was evaluated by fluorescence energy transfer using factor VIII subunits modified with N-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide (NPM; fluorescence donor) and vWf-derived fragments modified with 7-diethylamino-3-[4'-maleimidylphenyl]-4-methyl coumarin (CPM; fluorescence acceptor). Results from a previous study indicated an interfactor VIII subunit distance of 20 A separating Cys528 and Cys1858 in the factor VIII heavy and light chains, respectively (Fay, P.J., and Smudzin, T. M. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 14005-14010). Fluorophore modification of the vWf SPIII homodimer (residues 1-1365) indicated multiple attachment sites at Cys126/135/1360 as determined from sequence analysis of fluorescent tryptic peptides derived from the modified protein. Based upon donor quenching data, an interfluorophore distance of approximately 28 A was calculated separating NPM-factor VIII light chain or factor VIII reconstituted from NPM-light chain plus unmodified heavy chain, from CPM-SPIII. A similar value (29 A) was obtained for NPM-light chain paired with CPM-SPIII-T4 (vWf residues 1-272), suggesting that donor quenching resulted primarily from modified residue(s) Cys126/135 in the acceptor. No energy transfer was observed for the NPM-heavy chain/CPM-SPIII pairing. However, when NPM-heavy chain was reassociated with unmodified light chain prior to reaction with CPM-SPIII or CPM-SPIII-T4, energy transfer was observed with calculated interfluorophore distances of approximately 31 and 34 A, respectively. Levels of acceptor resulting in maximal donor quenching suggested an equimolar stoichiometry of factor VIII (light chain)/vWf fragment in the reconstituted complexes. These results indicate a close spatial arrangement among the A3 domain of factor VIII light chain, the A2 domain of factor VIII heavy chain, and the NH2 terminus region of vWf in the factor VIII-vWf complex."

The effect is seen both in native purple membranes and with the pure phospholipid in the form of liposomes. The specific activity and kinetic parameters Km and Vmax of phospholipase D for the purple membrane phospholipid are similar to those for egg phosphatidylcholine. The presence of phospholipase C impurities in the phospholipase D preparations has been ruled out as an explanation for the above observations. A hypothesis is suggested, taking into account the peculiar headgroup structure of the bacterial lipid, to explain the seemingly anomalous enzyme behavior."
