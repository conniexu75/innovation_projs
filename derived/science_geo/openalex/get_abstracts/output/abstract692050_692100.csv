https://openalex.org/W4224035333,"Tumor mutational burden (TMB) in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has shown promise in predicting benefit from PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitors in retrospective studies. Aiming to assess blood TMB (bTMB) prospectively, we conducted B-F1RST ( NCT02848651 ), an open-label, phase 2 trial that evaluated bTMB as a predictive biomarker for first-line atezolizumab monotherapy in locally advanced or metastatic stage IIIB-IVB non-small cell lung cancer (n = 152). The co-primary endpoints were investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST version 1.1 and investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) between high and low bTMB subgroups at the pre-defined bTMB ≥ 16 (14.5 mutations per megabase) cutoff. Secondary endpoints included investigator-assessed PFS, overall survival (OS) and duration of response at various bTMB cutoffs, as well as safety. Investigator-assessed PFS in the bTMB ≥ 16 versus bTMB < 16 groups was not statistically significant. However, bTMB ≥ 16 was associated with higher ORR, and ORR improved as bTMB cutoffs increased. No new safety signals were seen. In exploratory analyses, patients with maximum somatic allele frequency (MSAF) < 1% had higher ORR than patients with MSAF ≥ 1%. However, further analysis showed that this effect was driven by better baseline prognostics rather than by MSAF itself. At 36.5-month follow-up, an exploratory analysis of OS found that bTMB ≥ 16 was associated with longer OS than bTMB < 16. Further study and assay optimization will be required to develop bTMB as a predictive, standalone biomarker of immunotherapy or for use in conjunction with other biomarkers."

However, past efforts of directly targeting NMDARs have unfortunately failed in clinical trials. Here, we reveal an unexpected mechanism underlying NMDAR-mediated neurotoxicity, which leads to the identification of a novel target and development of an effective therapeutic peptide for ischemic stroke. We show that NMDAR-induced excitotoxicity is enhanced by physical and functional coupling of NMDAR to an ion channel TRPM2 upon ischemic insults. TRPM2-NMDAR association promotes the surface expression of extrasynaptic NMDARs, leading to enhanced NMDAR activity and increased neuronal death. We identified a specific NMDAR-interacting motif on TRPM2 and designed a membrane-permeable peptide to uncouple the TRPM2-NMDAR interaction. This disrupting peptide protects neurons against ischemic injury in vitro and protects mice against ischemic stroke in vivo. These findings provide an unconventional strategy to mitigate excitotoxic neuronal death without directly targeting NMDARs.

https://openalex.org/W4223900198,"There is significant regulatory and economic need to distinguish analytically between tobacco-derived nicotine (TDN) and synthetic nicotine (SyN) in commercial products. Currently, commercial e-liquid and oral pouch products are available that contain tobacco-free nicotine, which could be either extracted from tobacco or synthesized. While tobacco products that contain TDN are regulated by FDA Center for Tobacco Products, those with SyN are currently not in the domain of any regulatory authority. This regulatory difference provides an economic incentive to use or claim the use of SyN to remain on the market without submitting a Premarket Tobacco Product Application. TDN is ~99.3% (S)-nicotine, whereas SyN can vary from racemic (50/50 (R)/(S)) to ≥ 99% (S)-nicotine, i.e., chemically identical to the tobacco-derived compound. Here we report efforts to distinguish between TDN and SyN in various samples by characterizing impurities, (R)/(S)-nicotine enantiomer ratio, (R)/(S)-nornicotine enantiomer ratio, and carbon-14 (14C) content. Only 14C analysis accurately and precisely differentiated TDN (100% 14C) from SyN (35-38% 14C) in all samples tested. 14C quantitation of nicotine samples by accelerator mass spectrometry is a reliable determinate of nicotine source and can be used to identify misbranded product labelled as containing SyN. This is the first report to distinguish natural, bio-based nicotine from synthetic, petroleum-based nicotine across a range of pure nicotine samples and commercial e-liquid products."
https://openalex.org/W4223948429,"RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is an emerging regulator of mRNA modifications and represents a novel player in tumorigenesis. Although it has functional significance in both pathological and physiological processes, the role of m6A modification in pancreatic ductal cancer (PDAC) remains elusive. Here, we showed that high fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO) expression was associated with a poor prognosis in PDAC patients and that suppression of FTO expression inhibited cell proliferation. Here, m6A sequencing (m6A-seq) was performed to screen genes targeted by FTO. The effects of FTO stimulation on the biological characteristics of pancreatic cancer cells, including proliferation and colony formation, were investigated in vitro and in vivo. The results indicate that FTO directly targets platelet-derived growth factor C (PDGFC) and stabilizes its mRNA expression in an m6A-YTHDF2-dependent manner. m6A-methylated RNA immunoprecipitation-qPCR (MeRIP-qPCR), RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), and luciferase reporter assays were employed to validate the specific binding of FTO to PDGFC. PDGFC upregulation led to reactivation of the Akt signaling pathway, promoting cell growth. Overall, our study reveals that FTO downregulation leads to increased m6A modifications in the 3' UTR of PDGFC and then modulates the degradation of its transcriptional level in an m6A-YTHDF2-dependent manner, highlighting a potential therapeutic target for PDAC treatment and prognostic prediction."
https://openalex.org/W4224140900,"The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to influence psychological health of pregnant and postpartum women.We conducted a non-concurrent cross-sectional study among 1145 women living in the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium, 541 pregnant and 604 postpartum women. We measured psychological health with the Whooley questions, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2-item (GAD-2) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and compared the scores of pregnant and postpartum women before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.No differences were observed in the Whooley, GAD-2 or EPDS scores among pregnant women. The postpartum total GAD-2 scores before vs during the pandemic showed significant differences. Controlling for confounders, we observed a small main positive effect of having an infant during time of COVID-19 (F(1.13) = 5.06, p.025, d.27). The effect was significantly larger for women with (a history of) perinatal psychological problems (F(1.12) = 51.44, p < .001, d.82). Emotional support was significantly related to GAD-2 scores of postpartum women during the pandemic (F(1.90) = 35.54, p < .001). Postpartum women reported significant higher effects of the pandemic on their behavior compared to pregnant women (p.034).The COVID-19 pandemic seems to have a positive effect on postpartum women during the first year postpartum, in particular for women with (a history of) perinatal psychological problems and for those women who experienced emotional support. The findings suggest that less external stimuli caused by lockdown restrictions might have a positive effect on postpartum women's emotional wellbeing. The sample consisted of white, educated women in a relationship and information regarding the extent of exposure to adverse COVID-19 consequences was lacking. We relied on self-selection and self-report. The postpartum pandemic sample was small."
https://openalex.org/W4225518093,"Perceptual decisions arise through the transformation of samples of evidence into a commitment to a proposition or plan of action. Such transformation is thought to involve cortical circuits capable of computation over timescales associated with working memory, attention, and planning. Neurons in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) play a role in these functions, and much of what is known about the neurobiology of decision-making has been influenced by studies of LIP and its network of connections. However, the causal role of LIP remains controversial. In this study, we used pharmacological and chemogenetic methods to inactivate LIP in one brain hemisphere of four rhesus monkeys. This inactivation produced biases in decisions, but the effects dissipated despite persistent neural inactivation, implying compensation by unaffected areas. Compensation occurred rapidly within an experimental session and more gradually across sessions. These findings resolve disparate studies and inform the interpretation of focal perturbations of brain function."
https://openalex.org/W4223998630,"Oral exposure to chromium hexavalent [Cr(VI)] has disastrous impacts and affects many people worldwide. Cr(VI) triggers neurotoxicity via its high oxidation potential by generating high amount of ROS. Meanwhile, alginates are known by their chelating activity and ability to bind heavy metals and toxins, in addition to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic activities. So, this study aimed to explore the neuroprotective potential of sodium alginate (SA) against cellular injury, DNA damage, macromolecule alterations, and apoptosis induced by oral ingestion of Cr. Forty Wistar male rats were divided into 4 groups; group I: standard control ingested with the vehicle solution, group II: Cr-intoxicated group received 10 mg/kg b.w. of potassium dichromate orally by gavage and kept without treatment, group III: SA group in which rats were orally exposed to 200 mg/kg b.w. of SA only, and group IV: SA-treated group that received 200 mg/kg b.w. of SA along with Cr for 28 consecutive days. Neurotransmitters such as Acetyl choline esterase (AchE), Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) concentrations, Dopamine (DA) and 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels were assessed in brain homogenate tissues. Neurobiochemical markers; NAD+ and S100B protein were investigated in the brain tissues and serum, respectively. Levels of HSP70, caspase-3, protein profiling were evaluated. DNA damage was determined using the Comet assay. Results revealed a significant reduction in the AchE and MAOA concentrations, DA, 5-HT, and NAD+ levels, with an increase in the S100B protein levels. Cr(VI) altered protein pattern and caused DNA damage. High levels of HSP70 and caspase-3 proteins were observed. Fortunately, oral administration of SA prevented the accumulation of Cr in brain homogenates and significantly improved all investigated parameters. SA attenuated the ROS production and relieved the oxidative stress by its active constituents. SA can protect against cellular and DNA damage and limit apoptosis. SA could be a promising neuroprotective agent against Cr(VI)-inducing toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W4226088248,"Background Previous studies showed that the COVID-19 outbreak increased the levels of depression and anxiety in heterogeneous populations. However, none has explored the prevalence and correlates of depression and anxiety among Chinese international students studying in US colleges during the pandemic. Objective This study examines the prevalence of depression and anxiety among Chinese international students enrolled in US universities during the COVID-19 pandemic and identifies the associated factors, including habits, social and psychological support, sleep quality, and remote learning. Methods Between June and July 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional study through Wenjuanxing, a web-based survey platform. Participants were recruited with snowball sampling through 21 Chinese international student associations in US universities. The survey consisted of demographic questions, the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and self-constructed questions on academic performance, financial concerns, use of social media, physical exercise, and psychological support. Cut-off scores of 10 were used for both PHQ-9 and GAD-7 to determine the binary outcomes of depression and anxiety, respectively. Bivariant analyses and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the associated factors. Results Among 1881 participants, we found a prevalence of depression (PHQ-9 score⩾ 10) at 24.5% and that of anxiety (GAD-7 score⩾ 10) at 20.7%. A higher risk of depression was associated with recent exposure to traumatic events, agreement to pandemic’s negative impacts on financial status, agreement and strong agreement to the negative impacts of remote learning on personal relationships, and a higher ISI score. A lower risk of depression was associated with disagreement to the negative impacts of remote learning on academic performance and future careers, strong willingness to seek professional help with emotional issues, and a higher SSRS score. In addition, a higher risk of anxiety was associated with recent exposure to traumatic events, a lot of workloads, often staying up for online classes, agreement and strong agreement to the negative impacts of remote learning on personal relationships, and a higher ISI score. A lower risk of anxiety was associated with the willingness and strong willingness to seek professional help with emotional issues, and a higher SSRS score. Conclusion This study showed a high prevalence of depression and anxiety among Chinese international students studying in US colleges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multiple correlates—including recent exposure to traumatic events, pandemic-related financial concerns, workload, social support, remote learning, willingness to seek professional help, and sleep quality—were identified. It is critical for future studies to further investigate this student population and for universities to provide more flexible learning options and more access to psychological services."
https://openalex.org/W4223986316,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) has imposed catastrophic impressions on the world. After all the focused researches conducted in the COVID-19 area, many features remain obscure. We have surveyed 1,363 outpatients with suspected COVID-19 in Tehran, Iran. The analysis emphasized on characteristics of patients with positive PCR or serology of SARS-CoV-2.The nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for SARS-CoV2 PCR. Serum specimens were tested for SARS-CoV2 IgG and IgM. Clinical presentations of the patients, history of chronic diseases or drug use, contact with a possible COVID-19 patient and previous infection with SARS-COV2 were investigated.Of the total 1,363 investigated patients, 22% had positive SARS-CoV-2 PCRs, 82% had positive IgG, 38% had positive IgM, and 31% had both positive IgM and IgG values. Positive serologic tests were significantly associated with a positive PCR test obtained previously in the course of the current disease (P value<0.001). IgG and IgM antibody values were significantly associated with underlying disease, cough, fever, chills, fatigue, and myalgia (all P values <0.001). Dyspnea was significantly associated with IgG levels (P value = 0.01), yet it was not associated with IgM serology (P value = 0.2). Positive serology tests were not associated with symptoms of coryza. GI symptoms were not associated with positive IgG test (P value = 0.1), yet it did show an association with positive IgM test (P value = 0.02). Cough, fever, chills, myalgia fatigue, dyspnea, and GI symptoms were all significantly associated with positive PCR (all P values <0.001), and symptoms of coryza did not show a significant relationship (P value = 0.8).Assessing antibody titers in outpatients is invaluable due to the epidemiological importance of investigations in mild or even asymptomatic cases. Since the number of such studies in non-hospitalized patients is not high, the current study can be used as a comparison model."
https://openalex.org/W4223896758,"Introduction Adequate and timely access to pathology services is a key to scale up cancer control, however, there is an extremely shortage of pathologists in Tanzania. Telepathology (scanned images microscopy) has the potential to increase access to pathology services and it is increasingly being employed for primary diagnosis and consultation services. However, the experience with the use of telepathology in Tanzania is limited. We aimed to investigate the feasibility of using scanned images for primary diagnosis of pre-malignant and malignant cervical lesions by assessing its equivalency to conventional (glass slide) microscopy in Tanzania. Methods In this laboratory-based study, assessment of hematoxylin and eosin stained glass slides of 175 cervical biopsies were initially performed conventionally by three pathologists independently. The slides were scanned at x 40 and one to three months later, the scanned images were reviewed by the pathologists in blinded fashion. The agreement between initial and review diagnoses across participating pathologists was described and measured using Cohen’s kappa coefficient (κ). Results The overall concordance of diagnoses established on conventional microscopy compared to scanned images across three pathologists was 87.7%; κ = 0.54; CI (0.49–0.57).The overall agreement of diagnoses established by local pathologist on conventional microscopy compared to scanned images was 87.4%; κ = 0.73; CI (0.65–0.79). The concordance of diagnoses established by senior pathologist compared to local pathologist on conventional microscopy and scanned images was 96% and 97.7% respectively. The inter-observer agreement (κ) value were 0.93, CI (0.87–1.00) and 0.94, CI (0.88–1.00) for conventional microscopy and scanned images respectively. Conclusions All κ coefficients expressed good intra- and inter-observer agreement, suggesting that telepathology is sufficiently accurate for primary diagnosis in surgical pathology. The discrepancies in interpretation of pre-malignant lesions highlights the importance of p16 immunohistochemistry in definitive diagnosis in these lesions. Sustainability factors including hardware and internet connectivity are essential components to be considered before telepathology may be deemed suitable for widely use in Tanzania."
https://openalex.org/W4223963212,"The lack of data outsourcing in healthcare management systems slows down the intercommunication and information sharing between different entities. A standard solution is outsourcing the electronic health record (EHR) to a cloud service provider (CSP). The outsourcing of the EHR should be performed securely without compromising the CSP functionalities. Searchable encryption would be a viable approach to ensure the confidentiality of the data without compromising searchability and accessibility. However, most existing searchable encryption solutions use centralised architecture. These systems have trust issues as not all the CSPs are fully trusted or honest. To address these problems, we explore blockchain technology with smart contract applications to construct a decentralised system with auditable yet immutable data storage and access. First, we propose a blockchain-based searchable encryption scheme for EHR storage and updates in a decentralised fashion. The proposed scheme supports confidentiality of the outsourced EHR, keyword search functionalities, verifiability of the user and the server, storage immutability, and dynamic updates of EHRs. Next, we implement a prototype using JavaScript and Solidity on the Ethereum platform to demonstrate the practicality of the proposed solution. Finally, we compare the performance and security of the proposed scheme against existing solutions. The result indicates that the proposed scheme is practical while providing the desired security features and functional requirements."

Thus, biological control carried out by microorganisms has gained prominence, since it consists of an environmentally friendly alternative to the use of pesticides for controlling plant diseases. Herein, we evaluated the potential role of endophytic Trichoderma strains isolated from forest species of the Cerrado-Caatinga ecotone as biological control agents of crop pathogenic fungi. Nineteen Trichoderma strains were used to assess the antagonistic activity by in vitro bioassays against the plant pathogens Colletotrichum truncatum , Lasiodiplodia theobromae , Macrophomina phaseolina , and Sclerotium delphinii isolated from soybean, cacao, fava bean, and black pepper crops, respectively. All Trichoderma strains demonstrated inhibitory activity on pathogen mycelial growth, with maximum percent inhibition of 70% against C . truncatum , 78% against L . theobromae , 78% against M . phaseolina , and 69% against S . delphinii . Crude methanol extracts (0.5 to 2.0 mg mL -1 ) of Trichoderma strains were able to inhibit the growth of C . truncatum , except Trichoderma sp. T3 (UFPIT06) and T . orientale (UFPIT09 and UFPIT17) at 0.5 mg mL -1 , indicating that the endophytes employ a biocontrol mechanism related to antibiosis, together with multiple mechanisms. Discriminant metabolites of Trichoderma extracts were unveiled by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based metabolomics combined with principal component analysis (PCA), which included antifungal metabolites and molecules with other bioactivities. These results highlight the biocontrol potential of Trichoderma strains isolated from the Cerrado-Caatinga ecotone against crop pathogenic fungi, providing support for ongoing research on disease control in agriculture."
https://openalex.org/W4224087330,"The covid-19 global pandemic has influenced the day-to-day lives of people across the world. One consequence of this has been significant distortion to the subjective speed at which people feel like time is passing. To date, temporal distortions during covid-19 have mainly been studied in Europe. The current study therefore sought to explore experiences of the passage of time in Iraq. An online questionnaire was used to explore the passage of time during the day, week and the 11 months since the first period of covid-19 restrictions were imposed in Iraq. The questionnaire also measured affective and demographic factors, and task-load. The results showed that distortions to the passage of time were widespread in Iraq. Participants consistently reported a slowing of the passage of time for the day and the week during the pandemic in comparison to normal (i.e. before the pandemic). Participants also reported that it felt like longer than 11-months since the first lockdown began. The passage of time during the day and week were not predicted by any demographic, affective or task-load measures taken in the study. The perceived length of time since the first lockdown was however predicted by stress and change of life due to covid, with greater stress and greater change of life being associated with greater subjective lengthening of the pandemic. The findings indicate that whilst distortions to the passage of time during covid-19 appear to be a global phenomenon, the factors which predict temporal experience during the pandemic differ between countries and cultures."
https://openalex.org/W4223955351,"Drug resistance, either intrinsic or acquired, can impair treatment effects and result in increased cell motility and death. MicroRNA-21 (miR-21), a proto-oncogene, may facilitate the development or maintenance of drug resistance in cancer cells. Restoring drug sensitivity can improve therapeutic strategies, a possibility that requires functional evaluation and mechanistic exploration. For miR-21 detection, matched tissue samples from 30 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients and 8 head and neck cancer (HNC) cell lines were obtained. Reverse transcription-PCR to detect expression, MTT and clonogenic assays to evaluate cell proliferation, apoptosis assays, resazurin cell viability assays, western blot and luciferase reporter assays to detect protein expression, and flow cytometry to analyse the cell cycle were adopted. Compared to the corresponding normal control (NC) tissues, 25 cancer tissues had miR-21 upregulation among the 30 matched pair tissues (25/30, 83.8%); furthermore, among the 8 HNC cell lines, miR-21 expression that was notably upregulated in three: UPCI-4B, UMSCC-1, and UPCI-15B. In both the UMSCC-1 and UPCI-4B cell lines, the miR-21 mimic enhanced cell proliferation with reduced apoptosis and increased viability, whereas the miR-21 inhibitor resulted in the opposite effects (all P &lt;0.001); additionally, miR-21 directly targeted the tumour suppressor phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) and inhibited PTEN expression. Furthermore, the miR-21 mimic induced cisplatin resistance, while the miR-21 inhibitor restored cisplatin sensitivity. Overexpression of miR-21 can enhance cell proliferation, reduce apoptosis, and induce drug resistance by inhibiting PTEN expression. Targeting miR-21 may facilitate cancer diagnosis, restore drug sensitivity, and improve therapeutic effects."

In this study, we compare the sequence diversity of SARS-CoV-2 amplified from wastewater influent to the Columbia, South Carolina, metropolitan wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and the University of South Carolina campus during September 2020, which represents the peak of COVID-19 cases at the university during 2020. A total of 92 unique mutations were detected across all WWTP influent and campus samples, with the highest frequency mutations corresponding to the SARS-CoV-2 20C and 20G clades. Signature mutations for the 20G clade dominated SARS-CoV-2 sequences amplified from localized wastewater samples collected at the University of South Carolina, suggesting that the peak in COVID-19 cases during early September 2020 was caused by an outbreak of the 20G lineage. Thirteen mutations were shared between the university building-level wastewater samples and the WWTP influent collected in September 2020, 62% of which were nonsynonymous substitutions. Co-occurrence of mutations was used as a similarity metric to compare wastewater samples. Three pairs of mutations co-occurred in university wastewater and WWTP influent during September 2020. Thirty percent of the detected mutations, including 12 pairs of concurrent mutations, were only detected in university samples. This report affirms the close relationship between the prevalent SARS-CoV-2 genotypes of the student population at a university campus and those of the surrounding community. However, this study also suggests that wastewater surveillance at the building-level at a university offers important insight by capturing sequence diversity that was not apparent in the WWTP influent, thus offering a balance between the community-level wastewater and clinical sequencing."

Patients were included in the study if they were: 18 years of age or older, tested for SARS-CoV-2, admitted for COVID-19 infection, or had COVID-19 listed as a cause of death between March 1, 2020 and January 31, 2021. The primary outcomes of interest were a positive COVID-19 test result, admission to the hospital due to COVID-19, and in hospital COVID-19 related mortality. Comparisons were made across racial/ethnic groups using chi-squared statistics and logistic regression models adjusted for sociodemographics, comorbidities, and time from March 2020.Arab Americans had greater odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 than non-Hispanic White (adjusted odds ratio, AOR: 3.83, 95% confidence interval, CI: 3.29, 4.46) and non-Hispanic Black (AOR: 2.34, 95% CI: 1.91, 2.88) patients but lower odds of admission (AOR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.36, 0.63) and in-hospital mortality (AOR: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.28, 0.65) than Hispanic patients.There were distinct patterns for COVID-19 infection, severity, and mortality for Arab Americans in Southern California. Without a dedicated ethnic identifier, COVID-19 disparities facing Arab Americans will continue to go undocumented."
https://openalex.org/W4224137889,"Citrus canker is one of the main bacterial diseases that affect citrus crops and is caused by Xanthomonas citri which affects all citrus species worldwide. New strategies to control citrus canker are necessary and the use of bacteriophages as biocontrol agent could be an alternative. Phages that infect Xanthomonas species have been studied, such as XacN1, a myovirus that infects X . citri . Here we report the isolation and characterization of a new jumbo phage, vb_XciM_LucasX, which infects X . citri and X . fuscans . Transmission electron microscopy allowed classification of LucasX in the Myoviridae family, which was corroborated by its genomic sequencing, annotation, and proteome clustering. LucasX has a 305,651 bp-long dsDNA genome. ORF prediction and annotation revealed 157 genes encoding putative structural proteins such as capsid and tail related proteins and phage assembly associated proteins, however, for most of the structural proteins it was not possible assign specific functions. Its genome encodes several proteins related to DNA replication and nucleotide metabolism, five putative RNA polymerases, at least one homing endonuclease mobile element, a terminase large subunit (TerL), an endolysin and many proteins classified as beneficial to the host. Proteome clustering and phylogeny analyses showed that LucasX is a new jumbo phage having as its closest neighbor the Xanthomonas jumbo phage Xoo-sp14. LucasX presented a burst size of 40 PFU/infected cell of X . citri 306, was completely inactivated at temperatures above 50°C, presented survival lower than 25% after 80 s of exposition to artificial UV light and had practically no tolerance to concentrations above 2.5 g/L NaCl or 40% ethanol. LucasX presented optimum pH at 7 and a broad range of Xanthomonas hosts, infecting twenty-one of the twenty-three strains tested. Finally, the LucasX yield was dependent on the host strain utilized, resulting one order of magnitude higher in X . fuscans C 752 than in X . citri 306, which points out to the possibility of phage yield improvement, an usual challenge for biocontrol purposes."
https://openalex.org/W4223917180,"The association between acute cholangitis (AC) and acute kidney injury (AKI) remains unclear. We investigated the incidence, and clinical course of AKI in patients with AC, and the long-term prognosis.We performed a single-center retrospective study of patients hospitalized with AC in a tertiary care center from January 2011 to December 2017. The risk factors for AKI were evaluated, and AKI severity was analyzed using the Systemic Inflammatory Response System (SIRS), quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score, and 2018 Tokyo Guidelines (TG) grade. To calculate the relative risk of death based on AKI, hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained using Cox's proportional hazard models.A total of 1,438 patients with AC were included, of whom 18.2% (n = 261) developed AKI. AKI patients were older, and had a lower systolic blood pressure and more comorbidities including hypertension (HT), chronic kidney disease, and cardiovascular accidents. Disease severity (as assessed by SIRS, qSOFA, and the Tokyo Guidelines grade) was higher in the AKI group, as was the in-hospital mortality rate. Multivariate analysis revealed that age, HT, SIRS and qSOFA scores ≥ 2, and TG grade of III were significant risk factors for AKI. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed significantly higher mortality in the AKI than non-AKI group. AKI (HR = 1.853; 95% CI: 1.115-3.079) and TG grade III (HR = 2.139; 95% CI: 1.190-3,846) were independent predictors of all-cause AC mortality, even after adjusting for all covariates. The annual rate of decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate was faster in the AKI than non-AKI group (2.9 ± 6.7 vs. 0.5 ± 5.3 mL/min/1.73 m2/year, p < 0.001).AKI development increased AC severity and mortality. Our results suggest that clinicians should monitor AKI status and perform appropriate management as soon as possible."
https://openalex.org/W4224006456,"Background The association between out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patient survival and advanced life support response time remained controversial. We aimed to test the hypothesis that for adult, non-traumatic, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients, a shorter advanced life support response time is associated with a better chance of survival. We analyzed Utstein-based registry data on adult, non-traumatic, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients in Taipei from 2011 to 2015. Methods Patients without complete data, witnessed by emergency medical technicians, or with response times of ≥ 15 minutes, were excluded. We used logistic regression with an exposure of advanced life support response time. Primary and secondary outcomes were survival to hospital discharge and favorable neurological outcomes (cerebral performance category ≤ 2), respectively. Subgroup analyses were based on presenting rhythms of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and witness status. Results A total of 4,278 cases were included in the final analysis. The median advanced life support response time was 9 minutes. For every minute delayed in advanced life support response time, the chance of survival to hospital discharge would reduce by 7% and chance of favorable neurological outcome by 9%. Subgroup analysis showed that a longer advanced life support response time was negatively associated with the chance of survival to hospital discharge among out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients with shockable rhythm and pulse electrical activity groups. Conclusions In non-traumatic, adult, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients in Taipei, a longer advanced life support response time was associated with declining odds of survival to hospital discharge and favorable neurologic outcomes, especially in patients presenting with shockable rhythm and pulse electrical activity."
https://openalex.org/W4224076848,"Flash flooding is caused by heavy rainfall that frequently occurs during a tropical storm, and the Thai population has been subjected to this problem for a long time. The key to solving this problem by planning and taking action to protect the population and infrastructure is the motivation behind this study. The average weekly rainfall in northern Thailand during Tropical Storm Wipha are approximated using interval estimations for the mean of a delta-three parameter lognormal distribution. Our proposed methods are Bayesian confidence intervals-based noninformative (NI) priors (equal-tailed and highest posterior density (HPD) intervals based on NI1 and NI2 priors). Our numerical evaluation shows that the HPD-NI1 prior was closer to the nominal confidence level and possessed the narrowest expected length when the variance was small-to-medium for a large threshold. The efficacy of the methods was illustrated by applying them to weekly natural rainfall data in northern Thailand to examine their abilities to indicate flooding occurrence."
https://openalex.org/W4224108025,"The abandonment of irrigated paddy land has increased in Japan, which can cause a decline in food security and biodiversity. Despite the importance of individual decisions, most studies have only examined regional or community-based determinants of paddy land abandonment. This study aimed to uncover the socio-economic determinants affecting individual landowners’ decisions to abandon paddy land, using Japanese agricultural census data (2005, 2010, and 2015) composed of over one million unique paddy landowners. Results showed that low agricultural benefits are a key driver of abandonment, similar to European countries. Conversely, there is a positive correlation between the population of full-time cultivators in a household and paddy land abandonment, which contradicts previous evidence. Although some mosaics of socio-ecological landscapes with high biodiversity formed through long-term human influence (i.e., the Satoyama landscapes) are less-favored agricultural areas, the paddy land in some of these landscapes tends not to be abandoned. These findings support effective policymaking that balances biodiversity conservation and the provision of agroecosystem services in semi-natural landscapes."
https://openalex.org/W4224133945,"Despite the use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines for pediatric immunization, North American Indigenous populations continue to experience high burden of pneumococcal infections. Naturally acquired antibodies, which can protect unvaccinated adults against pneumococcal infections, have not previously been studied in Canadian Indigenous people. We analysed concentrations of natural serum IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies specific to 7 serotype-specific capsular polysaccharides (3, 6B, 9V, 14, 19A, 19F and 23F) in 141 healthy individuals (age between 18 and 80 years), including Indigenous adults living in 2 geographical different areas of Ontario, Canada, and non-Indigenous residing in northwestern Ontario. Regardless of the geographical area, concentrations of IgG specific to serotypes 6B, 9V, and 14, IgM specific to 9V, and all serotype-specific IgA were significantly higher in Indigenous study participants as compared to non-Indigenous. The differences are likely attributed to an increased exposure of Indigenous individuals to Streptococcus pneumoniae and/or cross-reactive antigens of other microorganisms or plants present in the environment. Although in non-Indigenous adults concentrations of IgM specific to 9V, 19A, 19F, and 23F significantly decreased with age, this was not observed in Indigenous individuals suggesting that Indigenous people may experience continuous exposure to pneumococci and cross-reactive antigens over the life span. Women had generally higher concentrations of natural IgG and IgM concentrations than men, with more striking differences found in Indigenous adults, potentially associated with larger exposure of women to young children, the major reservoir of pneumococci in communities. Our data suggest that increased rates of pneumococcal infections among Indigenous people are unlikely related to deficiency of naturally acquired antibodies, at least those specific to 7 common serotypes. Determining serological correlates of protection for adults will be essential to identify the groups in need of adult pneumococcal immunizations that may prevent excessive burden of the disease among North American Indigenous people."
https://openalex.org/W4223949124,"Due to the chemico-physical differences between air and water, the transition from aquatic life to the land poses several challenges for animal evolution, necessitating morphological, physiological and behavioural adaptations. Microbial symbiosis is known to have played an important role in eukaryote evolution, favouring host adaptation under changing environmental conditions. We selected mangrove brachyuran crabs as a model group to investigate the prokaryotes associated with the gill of crabs dwelling at different tidal levels (subtidal, intertidal and supratidal). In these animals, the gill undergoes a high selective pressure, finely regulating multiple physiological functions during both animal submersion under and emersion from the periodical tidal events. We hypothesize that similarly to other marine animals, the gills of tidal crabs are consistently colonized by prokaryotes that may quantitatively change along the environmental gradient driven by the tides. Using electron microscopy techniques, we found a thick layer of prokaryotes over the gill surfaces of all of 12 crab species from the mangrove forests of Saudi Arabia, Kenya and South Africa. We consistently observed two distinct morphotypes (rod- and spherical-shaped), positioned horizontally and/or perpendicularly to the gill surface. The presence of replicating cells indicated that the prokaryote layer is actively growing on the gill surface. Quantitative analysis of scanning electron microscopy images and the quantification of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene by qPCR revealed a higher specific abundance of prokaryote cells per gill surface area in the subtidal species than those living in the supratidal zone. Our results revealed a correlation between prokaryote colonization of the gill surfaces and the host lifestyle. This finding indicates a possible role of prokaryote partnership within the crab gills, with potential effects on animal adaptation to different levels of the intertidal gradient present in the mangrove ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W4223989042,"Future genetic progress in wheat grain yield will depend on increasing biomass and this must be achieved without commensurate increases in nitrogen (N) fertilizer inputs to minimize environmental impacts. In recent decades there has been a loss of genetic diversity in wheat through plant breeding. However, new genetic diversity can be created by incorporating genes into bread wheat from wild wheat relatives. Our objectives were to investigate amphidiploids derived from hybrids of bread wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) and related species from the genera Aegilops , Secale , Thinopyrum and Triticum for expression of higher biomass, N-use efficiency (NUE) and leaf photosynthesis rate compared to their bread wheat parents under high and low N conditions. Eighteen amphidiploid lines and their bread wheat parents were examined in high N (HN) and low N (LN) treatments under glasshouse conditions in two years. Averaged across years, grain yield reduced by 38% under LN compared to HN conditions (P = 0.004). Three amphidiploid lines showed positive transgressive segregation compared to their bread wheat parent for biomass per plant under HN conditions. Positive transgressive segregation was also identified for flag-leaf photosynthesis both pre-anthesis and post-anthesis under HN and LN conditions. For N uptake per plant at maturity positive transgressive segregation was identified for one amphidiploid line under LN conditions. Our results indicated that introgressing traits from wild relatives into modern bread wheat germplasm offers scope to raise biomass and N-use effciency in both optimal and low N availability environments."
https://openalex.org/W4224013066,"To investigate the cutting forces on road-header picks, a series of full-scale single-pick rotary cutting tests on sandstone samples were conducted at the National Engineering Laboratory of Coal Mining Machinery and Equipment, China. The primary objective of this study is to optimize the cut spacing and to verify the numerical simulation results. Cutting forces are investigated under different cutting depths and cut spacings. Cut spacing is optimized by analyzing the specific energy, coarseness index, and cutting force. The rock cutting process is simulated on a pick model using the PFC3D software. Rock samples are used as models, and particle assemblies and micro-properties are calibrated by uniaxial compressive strength tests and Brazilian disc tensile strength tests. The optimum ratio of cut spacing to cutting depth for the analyzed sandstone is determined to be in the range of 3 to 4. The experimental results show that a higher coarseness index corresponds to an increased block ratio, and specific energy decreases under optimum cutting conditions. Forces acting on the pick model are determined by simulation. A reasonable agreement exists between the experimental and numerical simulation results regarding the pick forces. The influence of the cut spacing on the rock-breaking effect observed in the experiments is confirmed by numerical simulations. Therefore, numerical simulations using the PFC3D software represent a reliable method for predicting the pick forces."
https://openalex.org/W4224049892,"Sarcomas are difficult to treat and the therapy, even when effective, is associated with long-term and life-threatening side effects. In addition, the treatment regimens for many sarcomas, including Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and osteosarcoma, are relatively unchanged over the past two decades, indicating a critical lack of progress. Although differentiation-based therapies are used for the treatment of some cancers, the application of this approach to sarcomas has proven challenging. Here, using a CRISPR-mediated gene knockout approach, we show that Inhibitor of DNA Binding 2 (ID2) is a critical regulator of developmental-related genes and tumor growth in vitro and in vivo in Ewing sarcoma tumors. We also identified that homoharringtonine, which is an inhibitor of protein translation and FDA-approved for the treatment of leukemia, decreases the level of the ID2 protein and significantly reduces tumor growth and prolongs mouse survival in an Ewing sarcoma xenograft model. Furthermore, in addition to targeting ID2, homoharringtonine also reduces the protein levels of ID1 and ID3, which are additional members of the ID family of proteins with well-described roles in tumorigenesis, in multiple types of cancer. Overall, these results provide insight into developmental regulation in Ewing sarcoma tumors and identify a novel, therapeutic approach to target the ID family of proteins using an FDA-approved drug."
https://openalex.org/W4224058585,"Individuals with cognitive impairment and their families place a high value on receiving a dementia diagnosis, but clinician approaches vary. There is a need for research investigating experiences of giving and receiving dementia diagnoses. The current study aimed to investigate clinician approaches to giving dementia diagnoses as part of a larger study investigating patient, caregiver, and clinician experiences during the diagnosis encounter.Investigators conducted telephone interviews with Florida-based clinicians who give dementia diagnoses either rarely or commonly. Interviews employed a semi-structured interview guide querying communication practices used by clinicians when giving dementia diagnoses and how clinicians learned to give dementia diagnoses. Investigators used a descriptive qualitative design to conduct a thematic analysis of data.Fifteen Florida-based clinicians participated, representing diverse backgrounds related to gender, race/ethnicity, specialty, and practice setting. Participants reported using patient- and family-centered communication practices including checking patient understanding, communicating empathically, and involving family members. Some clinicians explicitly asked patients and/or family members about their preferences regarding diagnosis disclosure; many clinicians tailored their disclosure based on patient and family characteristics or reactions. Some clinicians reported using specific diagnoses, while others used general terms such as ""memory disorder."" Clinicians reported positively framing information, including instilling hope, focusing on healthy behaviors, and discussing symptom management. Finally, clinicians provided patient/family education and arranged follow up. Clinicians reported learning approaches to dementia diagnosis disclosure through formal training and self-education.Diverse Florida-based clinicians described dementia disclosure practices largely consistent with published guidance, but clinicians varied on approaches relating to soliciting patient disclosure preferences and terminology used. Clinicians caring for diverse populations described that cultural background affects the disclosure process, but more research is needed regarding this finding and best practices for individuals from different backgrounds."
https://openalex.org/W4224069575,"Non-Human Primates (NHPs) harbor Cryptosporidium genotypes that can infect humans and vice versa. NHPs Chlorocebus aethiops and Colobus guereza and humans have overlapping territories in some regions of Ethiopia, which may increase the risk of zoonotic transmission of Cryptosporidium . This cross-sectional study examined the molecular prevalence and subtypes of Cryptosporidium spp . from 185 fecal samples of Chlorocebus aethiops and Colobus guereza in rural and urban areas in Ethiopia. Samples were tested for Cryptosporidium infection using nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and subtypes were determined by sequencing a fragment of the 60-kDa glycoprotein gene (gp60). Of the 185 samples, fifty-one (27.56%) tested positive for Cryptosporidium infection. The species detected were C . parvum (n = 34), C . hominis (n = 12), and C . cuniculus (n = 3). Mixed infection with C . parvum and C . hominis were detected in 2 samples. Four C . hominis family subtypes (Ia, Ib, Id, and Ie) and one C . parvum family subtype (IIa) were identified. C . hominis IaA20 (n = 7) and C . parvum IIaA17G1R1 (n = 6) were the most prevalent subtypes detected. These results confirm that Chlorocebus aethiops and Colobus guereza can be infected with diverse C . parvum and C . hominis subtypes that can also potentially infect humans. Additional studies could help to understand the role of NHPs in the zoonotic transmission of Cryptosporidium in Ethiopia."
https://openalex.org/W4224083596,"The tobacco BY-2 cell line has been used widely as a model system in plant cell biology. BY-2 cells are nearly transparent, which facilitates cell imaging using fluorescent markers. As cultured cells are drifted in the medium, therefore, it was difficult to observe them for a long period. Hence, we developed a microfluidic device that traps BY-2 cells and fixes their positions to allow monitoring the physiological activity of cells. The device contains 112 trap zones, with parallel slots connected in series at three levels in the flow channel. BY-2 cells were cultured for 7 days and filtered using a sieve and a cell strainer before use to isolate short cell filaments consisting of only a few cells. The isolated cells were introduced into the flow channel, resulting in entrapment of cell filaments at 25 out of 112 trap zones (22.3%). The cell numbers increased through cell division from 1 to 4 days after trapping with a peak of mitotic index on day 2. Recovery experiments of fluorescent proteins after photobleaching confirmed cell survival and permeability of plasmodesmata. Thus, this microfluidic device and one-dimensional plant cell samples allowed us to observe cell activity in real time under controllable conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4224104910,"Investigations of neuromuscular control of voice production have primarily focused on the roles of muscle activation levels, posture, and stiffness at phonation onset. However, little work has been done investigating the stability of the phonation process in regards to spontaneous changes in vibratory mode of vocal fold oscillation as a function of neuromuscular activation. We evaluated 320 phonatory conditions representing combinations of superior and recurrent laryngeal nerve (SLN and RLN) activations in an in vivo canine model of phonation. At each combination of neuromuscular input, airflow was increased linearly to reach phonation onset and beyond from 300 to 1400 mL/s. High-speed video and acoustic data were recorded during phonation, and spectrograms and glottal-area-based parameters were calculated. Vibratory mode changes were detected based on sudden increases or drops of local fundamental frequency. Mode changes occurred only when SLNs were concurrently stimulated and were more frequent for higher, less asymmetric RLN stimulation. A slight increase in amplitude and cycle length perturbation usually preceded the changes in the vibratory mode. However, no inherent differences between signals with mode changes and signals without were found."
https://openalex.org/W4223957168,"A key driver of urbanization is the pursuit of economic opportunities in cities. One such opportunity is the promise of higher wages in larger cities, a phenomenon known as the urban wage premium. While an urban wage premium has been well-documented among U.S. metropolitan areas, little is known about its existence in micropolitan areas, which represent an important link between rural and dense urban areas. Here we measure the power law scaling coefficient of annual wages versus employment for both U.S. metropolitan and micropolitan areas over a 37-year period. We take this coefficient to be a quantification of the urban wage premium for each type of urban area and find the relationship is superlinear in all years for both area types. Though both area types once had wage premiums of similar magnitude, the wage premium in micropolitan areas has steadily declined since the late 1980s while in metropolitan areas it has generally increased. This growing gap between micropolitan and metropolitan wage premiums is ongoing in parallel to other diverging characteristics, such as inequality and voting behavior, suggesting that our result is part of a broader social, cultural, and political divergence between small and large cities. Finally, we speculate that if urban residents respond to the COVID-19 crisis by migrating, the trends we describe may change significantly."
https://openalex.org/W4223973973,"A previously developed joint-space metabolic energy expenditure (MEE) model includes subject-specific parameters and was validated using level walking gait data. In this work, we determine how well this joint-space model performs during various walking grades (-8%, 0%, and 8%) at 0.8 m·s ⁻1 and 1.3 m·s ⁻1 using published gait data in the literature. In response to those results, we formulate an optimization problem and solve it through the particle swam method plus fmincon function in MATLAB to identify a new optimal weighting parameter set for each grade that produces more accurate predicted MEE and we compare our new findings with seven other MEE models in the literature. The current study matched the measured MEE the best with the lowest RMSE values for level (0.45 J·kg ⁻1·m ⁻1) and downhill (0.82 J·kg ⁻1·m ⁻1) walking and the third lowest RMSE value for uphill (1.56 J·kg ⁻1·m ⁻1) walking, where another MEE model, Looney et al., had the lowest RMSE for uphill (1.27 J·kg ⁻1·m ⁻1) walking. Bland-Altman plots and three independent-samples t-tests show that there was no statistical significant difference between experimentally measured MEE and estimated MEE during the three walking conditions, meaning that the three new optimal weighting parameter sets can be used with 6 degree of freedom (DOF) lower extremity motion data to better estimate whole body MEE in those scenarios. We believe that this work is a step towards identifying a single robust parameter set that allows for accurate estimation of MEE during any task, with the potential to mitigate a limitation of indirect calorimetry requiring lengthy steady state motion."
https://openalex.org/W4223979846,"How can we accurately and efficiently decompose a tensor stream? Tensor decomposition is a crucial task in a wide range of applications and plays a significant role in latent feature extraction and estimation of unobserved entries of data. The problem of efficiently decomposing tensor streams has been of great interest because many real-world data dynamically change over time. However, existing methods for dynamic tensor decomposition sacrifice the accuracy too much, which limits their usages in practice. Moreover, the accuracy loss becomes even more serious when the tensor stream has an inconsistent temporal pattern since the current methods cannot adapt quickly to a sudden change in data. In this paper, we propose DAO-CP, an accurate and efficient online CP decomposition method which adapts to data changes. DAO-CP tracks local error norms of the tensor streams, detecting a change point of the error norms. It then chooses the best strategy depending on the degree of changes to balance the trade-off between speed and accuracy. Specifically, DAO-CP decides whether to (1) reuse the previous factor matrices for the fast running time or (2) discard them and restart the decomposition to increase the accuracy. Experimental results show that DAO-CP achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy without noticeable loss of speed compared to existing methods."
https://openalex.org/W4224013154,"Species distributions are affected by landscape structure at different spatial scales. Here we study how the interplay between dispersal at different spatial scales and landscape connectivity and composition affect local species dynamics. Using a host-parasitoid model, we assessed host density and host occupancy on the landscape, under different parasitoid dispersal ranges and three local distributions of non-crop habitats, areas where hosts are unable to grow but parasitoids are provided with alternative hosts and food resources. Our results show distinct responses of host density to increases in non-crop area, measured by differences in slopes for different distributions of non-crop habitats, and that the effect of local landscape composition on species dynamics depends on the landscape connectivity at the regional scale. Moreover, we show how host density and occupancy are affected by increasing parasitoid dispersal ranges depending on landscape structure. Our results demonstrate the role of local and regional scales on species distributions and the importance of the combined effects of species biological parameters and landscape structure on species dynamics. Finally, we highlight the relevance of these aspects for the development of better strategies of biological control."
https://openalex.org/W4224017595,"Background Social distancing measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 included restrictions on retail services in many countries. In some countries, the governments also subsidized consumer spending on part of retail services to help struggling businesses. To evaluate the costs and benefits of government interventions in retail services, it is necessary to measure the infectiousness of each type of consumer activity. Methods This study regresses the log difference over seven days in the number of new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Japan on lagged values of household expenditures per household on eating out, traveling, admissions to entertainment facilities, clothing and footwear, and the other items, as well as a measure of mobility in public transportation in the past 14 days. The sample period of the dependent variable is set from March 1, 2020, to February 1, 2021, in order to avoid a possible structural break due to the spread of mutant strains in 2021. The regression model is estimated by the Bayesian method with a non-informative (improper) prior. The estimated model is evaluated by out-of-sample forecast performance from February 2, 2021, onward. Results The out-of-sample forecasts of the regression by the posterior means of regression coefficients perform well before the spread of the Delta variant in Japan since June 2021. R 2 for the out-of-sample forecasts from February 2, 2021, to June 30, 2021, is 0.60. The dependent variable of the regression overshot the out-of-sample forecasts from mid-June to August 2021. Then, the out-of-sample forecasts overpredicted the dependent variable for the rest of 2021. Conclusion The estimated model can be potentially useful in simulating changes in the number of new confirmed cases due to household spending on retail services, if it can be adjusted to real-time developments of mutant strains and vaccinations. Such simulations would help in designing cost-efficient government interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4224023176,"Background Higher serum β2-microglobulin (B2M) concentrations are associated with higher mortality in the general population, non-dialyzed chronic kidney disease patients and patients receiving hemodialysis (HD). However, this relationship among patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) has not been validated. Methods We collected baseline data for 3,011 prevalent PD patients from a nationwide dialysis registry in Japan at the end of 2010. Clinical outcomes for 9 years were then evaluated using the registry at the end of 2011 to 2019. All-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality was assessed using Cox regression analysis and competing-risks regression analysis, respectively. We used multiple imputation to deal with missing covariate data. Results During a median follow-up of 87 months, 2,054 patients transferred to combined therapy with PD and HD or HD directly. A total of 3,011 patients, 1,235 (41.0%) died, including 437 patients (14.5%) from CV causes. Among them, 612 patients died after transfer to other dialysis modalities. Univariate analyses revealed no significant association between serum B2M and mortality, whereas higher serum B2M was independently associated with both all-cause and CV mortalities in adjusted models. However, the significant association between serum B2M and CV mortality disappeared in analysis treating serum B2M as a categorical variable. The effect of serum B2M on all-cause mortality was significantly higher among patients with higher urinary volume and a significant interaction was evident. Conclusions Using a large-scale registry, we found that serum B2M contributes tenuously but significantly to worse outcome and residual kidney function significantly affects this relationship. On the contrary, serum B2M per se had no predictive value for patient outcome in prevalent PD patients."
https://openalex.org/W4224045457,"To quantitatively analyze morphological and functional alterations of the meibomian glands in eyes with marginal entropion and their changes after surgery.Sixty eyes of 52 patients with marginal entropion and underwent meibography and interferometer were included. One-hundred and seventeen age- and sex-matched eyes with minimal to mild meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) were recruited as control eyes. Meibomian gland loss (MGL) and lipid layer thickness (LLT) were compared between eyes with marginal entropion and control eyes. Subgroup analysis was performed according to the extent of entropion. MGL and average LLT at 1 and 5 months after surgery were compared with those of 20 eyes with marginal entropion followed without surgery.In eyes with marginal entropion, MGL was higher (27.7% vs. 12.8%, P = 0.014), and average LLT was thinner (64 nm vs. 86 nm, P = 0.005) than those in control eyes. MGL was higher in eyes with more extensive entropion (> 2/3 eyelid width) than in eyes with less extensive entropion (≤ 1/3 eyelid width) (40.5% vs. 13.2%, P = 0.001). Average LLT increased after surgery (97 nm at 1 month, P = 0.003; 75 nm at 5 months, P = 0.319), and thicker than that of eyes followed without surgery (97 nm vs. 66 nm, P = 0.046). MGLs after surgery remained unchanged from the preoperative MGL (all P > 0.7).Marginal entropion is associated with morphological and functional alterations of the meibomian glands. Functional improvement after entropion repair suggests that marginal entropion could cause or exacerbate MGD. Further studies are required to establish the role of entropion repair in managing MGD."

It took 15-20 min for the diabetes patients to interact with the robot. Before and after the interaction, questionnaires including a diabetes knowledge test, self-efficacy for diabetes, and feasibility of use of the robot was administered. In-depth interviews with both pharmacists and patients were also conducted.After interacting with the robot, a statistically significant improvement in diabetes knowledge (p < .001) and feasibility of the robot (p = .012) was found, but self-efficacy (p = .171) was not significantly improved. Five themes emerged from interviewing the diabetes patients: Theme 1: meets the needs of self-directed learning for the elderly; Theme 2: reduces alertness and creates comfortable interaction; Theme 3: vividness and richness enhance interaction opportunities; Theme 4: Robots are not without disadvantages, and Theme 5: Every person has unique tastes. Three themes emerged from interviewing pharmacists: Theme 1: Technology must meet the real needs of the patient; Theme 2: creates new services, and Theme 3: The use of robots must conform to real-life situations.Both the diabetes patients and the pharmacist reported more positive feedback on the robot-enhanced diabetes care than concerns. Self-directed learning, comfortable interaction, and vividness were the most focuses when using robot to enhance self-management for the patients.

https://openalex.org/W4224085525,"We set forth to assess the quality of an herbal medicine sold in Hong Kong called Qianliguang by employing a multi-methodological approach. The quality is set by its identity, chemical composition, and bioactivities, among others. Qianliguang (Senecionis scandentis Herba, Senecio scandens Buch.-Ham. ex D.Don) has known antibacterial properties. However, it is poisonous and overconsumption can result in liver damage. Eighteen Qianliguang samples were purchased from herbal shops at various districts in Hong Kong. Samples were first authenticated organoleptically. DNA barcoding at the psbA-trnH, ITS2, and rbcL loci was then conducted to confirm the species. HPLC-UV was performed to screen for the presence of the chemical compounds and to quantify the flavonoid hyperoside. UPLC-MS was used to quantify the amount of the toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloid (PA) adonifoline. Microdilution assay was performed to show the antibacterial effect on Streptococcus aureus and S. pneumoniae. Results showed that five samples were found to be substituted by species belonging to the genus Lespedeza; four samples were mixtures containing not only Qianliguang but also Achyranthes aspera L., Lonicera confusa DC., or Solanum nigrum L. HPLC-UV showed that only ten contained enough hyperoside to meet the standard requirement. In addition, nine samples had adonifoline that exceeded the toxicity standard requirement. In the microdilution assay, samples containing Qianliguang showed inhibition on S. aureus and S. pneumoniae, while among the five Lespedeza sp. samples the antibacterial effects on S. aureus were not detectable; only one sample showed inhibition to S. pneumoniae. Our study illustrated the necessity of using a multi-methodological approach for herbal medicine quality assessment. We also showed that Qianliguang samples in the Hong Kong market were either toxic or adulterated. It is therefore essential to improve the quality control of Qianliguang and probably other herbs in the herbal market."

For this study, developing past research, the relation between joint attention and the ability of conceptual inference is examined in 113 Japanese children (67.9 months mean age, 75% male) with ASD. We calculated Pearson's correlation coefficients between their Joint attention abnormality evaluated by ADOS-2 and ""Riddle"" subscale in K-ABC, then they are negatively correlated: r (104) = -.285. A larger abnormality of joint attention is associated with a lower ability of conceptual inference. New findings were obtained indicating that, in children of this age group with ASD, the degree of joint attention impairment is correlated negatively with conceptual inference ability, but not with expressive and receptive language abilities. Consideration of the mechanism of this relation is presented in this report."

https://openalex.org/W4223944530,"Elderly inpatients who develop fevers after resumption of oral intake are often considered to have aspiration pneumonia (AP) and be tentatively fasted. Fasting has been associated with prolonged hospital stays and decreased swallowing ability. The purpose of this study was to compare AP and other infections after resumption of oral intake in elderly inpatients and to identify the clinical characteristics.The records of patients who were admitted to a public tertiary hospital and referred for evaluation of swallowing disability were retrospectively reviewed to identify those who had developed AP, non-AP, or urinary tract infection (UTI) after resumption of oral intake. Eligible patients were enrolled consecutively in the study. The patient characteristics, physical findings, laboratory data, oral intake status at the time of onset of symptoms, and rate of discontinuation of oral intake after onset of infection were compared between the three types of infection.A total of 193 patients developed an infectious illness after resuming oral intake. Among them, 114 patients had a diagnosis of AP (n = 45), non-AP (n = 24), or UTI (n = 45). There were no significant differences in patient characteristics, physical findings or laboratory data between the group with AP and the other two groups. AP developed at a median of 6 (range 1-16) days after resumption of oral intake. The rate of discontinuation of oral intake was 91.1% in the AP group, 58.3% in the non-AP group, and 26.7% in the UTI group, respectively.Infectious diseases other than AP should be considered in the differential diagnosis when nosocomial fever develops in elderly inpatients more than 17 days after resuming oral intake. Furthermore, nosocomial fever after resuming oral intake has many causes other than AP, and discontinuation of oral intake should be carefully considered."
https://openalex.org/W4223949162,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment for motor symptoms of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). Currently, DBS programming outcome is based on a clinical assessment. In an optimal situation, an objectively measurable feature would assist the operator to select the appropriate settings for DBS. Surface electromyographic (EMG) measurements have been used to characterise the motor symptoms of PD with good results; with proper methodology, these measurements could be used as an aid to program DBS.Muscle activation measurements were performed for 13 patients who had advanced PD and were treated with DBS. The DBS pulse voltage, frequency, and width were changed during the measurements. The measured EMG signals were analysed with parameters that characterise the EMG signal morphology, and the results were compared to the clinical outcome of the adjustment.The EMG signal correlation dimension, recurrence rate, and kurtosis changed significantly when the DBS settings were changed. DBS adjustment affected the signal recurrence rate the most. Relative to the optimal settings, increased recurrence rates (median ± IQR) 1.1 ± 0.5 (-0.3 V), 1.3 ± 1.1 (+0.3 V), 1.7 ± 0.4 (-30 Hz), 1.7 ± 0.8 (+30 Hz), 2.0 ± 1.7 (+30 μs), and 1.5 ± 1.1 (DBS off) were observed. With optimal stimulation settings, the patients' Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor part (UPDRS-III) score decreased by 35% on average compared to turning the device off. However, the changes in UPRDS-III arm tremor and rigidity scores did not differ significantly in any settings compared to the optimal stimulation settings.Adjustment of DBS treatment alters the muscle activation patterns in PD patients. The changes in the muscle activation patterns can be observed with EMG, and the parameters calculated from the signals differ between optimal and non-optimal settings of DBS. This provides a possibility for using the EMG-based measurement to aid the clinicians to adjust the DBS."
https://openalex.org/W4223955392,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are double membrane structures released by all cell types with identified roles in the generation, transportation, and degradation of amyloid-β protein (Aβ) oligomers in Alzheimer's disease (AD). EVs are thus increasingly recognized to play a neuroprotective role in AD, through their ability to counteract the neurotoxic effects of Aβ, possibly through interactions with specific receptors on cell membranes. Our previous studies have identified the amylin receptor (AMY), particularly AMY3 subtype, as a mediator of the deleterious actions of Aβ in vitro and in vivo experimental paradigms. In the present study, we demonstrate that AMY3 enriched EVs can bind soluble oligomers of Aß and protect N2a cells against toxic effects of this peptide. The effect was specific to amylin receptor as it was blocked in the presence of amylin receptor antagonist AC253. This notion was supported by reduced Aβ binding to EVs from AMY depleted mice compared to those from wild type (Wt) mice. Finally, application of AMY3, but not Wt derived, EVs to hippocampal brain slices improved Aβ-induced reduction of long-term potentiation, a cellular surrogate of memory. Collectively, our observations support the role of AMY receptors, particularly AMY3, in EVs as a potential therapeutic target for AD."
https://openalex.org/W4223958171,"Background Chadian pastoral nomads are highly exposed to malaria due to their lifestyle and their mobility between various endemic areas. To inform strategies to reduce nomads’ risk of malaria and associated morbidity and mortality, it is important to understand the factors associated to their knowledge of malaria transmission and prevention practices. Methods A cross–sectional study among Arab, Dazagada and Fulani pastoral nomadic groups was conducted in February and October 2021. A validated structured electronic questionnaire was administered to assess knowledge of malaria. Attitudes and malaria prevention practices were assessed on the basis of perception of the causes of malaria and the use of a long-lasting insecticide-treated net (LLIN) the day before the survey. Data were analyzed using Chi—square tests and multivariate logistic regression with covariates adjustment. Results A total of 278 nomads aged 20 to 65 years were included in the study. Overall, 90.7% of participants surveyed had a good knowledge of malaria. Fulani respondents were more likely to have a good knowledge of malaria than Arab respondents (Adjusted Odd ratio (AOR): 5.00, 95% CI: 1.04–24.03) and households possessing a LLIN were more likely to have a good knowledge of malaria (AOR: 9.66, 95% CI: 1.24–75.36). Most nomad households surveyed reported sleeping under a mosquito net the night before the survey (87.1%) while 98.9% owned a LLIN. Daza respondents (AOR: 0.23, 95% CI: 0.09–0.56) were less likely to use LLINs than Arab respondents. The middle (AOR: 2.78, 95% CI: 1.17–6.62) and wealthier households (AOR: 6.68, 95% CI: 3.19–14.01) were more likely to use LLINs. Knowledge of malaria was associated with the use of LLIN (AOR: 12.77, 95% CI: 1.58–102.99). Conclusion There remains a need to improve nomads’ understanding of Plasmodium falciparum-carrying mosquitoes as the vector for malaria transmission and the quality of information provided. Knowledge of malaria and its prevention strategies in nomadic setting lead to the use of LLINs. Further reductions in malaria morbidity can be achieved by improving nomads’ access to LLINs. This study can inform on the design policies to improve nomadic communities’ knowledge of malaria prevention and promoting LLIN use as requested by the national policy against malaria."

The objective of this cross-sectional, qualitative study was to explore the perspectives of PLWH in Greece regarding their QoL.Twenty-four semi-structured interviews were conducted with PLWH receiving care across six HIV clinics in Greece. The thematic analysis of the transcribed interviews resulted in four themes and eleven subthemes.First, fear of repercussions (e.g., stigmatization) makes PLWH reluctant to disclose their diagnosis in public settings or disclose accounting for factors like the confidant's discretion. Second, participants are challenged by HIV's unique biopsychosocial facets (e.g., uncertainty about symptoms) and fear for the future (e.g., a confidant revealing their HIV status without consent). Third, support received by specialist services is satisfactory in contrast to non-HIV specialist services, where significant improvements are needed to reduce stigmatization. Finally, the experiences of PLWH include contrasting elements of post-traumatic growth and an inability to accept their seropositivity (e.g., avoiding social interactions).Empowering PLWH in these QoL areas is greatly needed. Increasing the life expectancy of PLWH is only the initial step; their QoL needs to be secured as the next priority in HIV care."
https://openalex.org/W4223978027,"The objective of this paper is to examine the representativeness of charcoal taxa at archeological sites in northern China. We carried out standardized laboratory compression tests on 168 samples representing 21 taxa charred at four different temperatures to characterize the mechanical properties of common taxa in temperate China. The results indicate that significant fragmentation differences occur between taxa. Ring-porous/semi-ring-porous taxa with a moderate density (&gt;0.55 g/cm 3 ) are overrepresented, while those with a very low to low density (&lt;0.55 g/cm 3 ) are moderately represented. Diffuse-porous taxa with slightly dense uniseriate rays, rare multiseriate rays and distinct helical thickenings are underrepresented, and those with slightly dense multiseriate rays are overrepresented, while those with rare to moderate multiseriate rays and helical thickening absence are moderately represented. Gymnosperm trees are generally well represented. Among the ubiquitous taxa at the archeological sites across northern China, Quercus and Ulmus may be overrepresented, and Pinus , Salix , Populus , and Acer may be underrepresented, while Betula may be moderately represented."
https://openalex.org/W4224001632,"Background The burden of diabetes mellitus (DM) and its associated complications continue to burgeon, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Lower limb amputation (LLA) is one of the most life-altering complications of DM, associated with significant morbidity, mortality and socio-economic impacts. High-income countries have reported a decreasing incidence of DM-associated LLA, but the situation in many LMICs is unknown. We aim to conduct a systematic review to determine the incidence and prevalence of DM-associated LLA in LMICs to better inform appropriate interventions and health system response. Methods and analysis A systematic search of the literature will be conducted on five databases: MEDLINE, Embase, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Scopus and African Journal Online (AJOL). Only observational, quantitative studies reporting the incidence and/or prevalence of DM-related LLA will be considered. A validated study design-specific critical appraisal tool will be used to assess the risk of bias in individual studies. We will determine the incidence of LLA by examining the number of new cases of LLA among individuals with confirmed DM diagnosis during the specified period, while the prevalence will be based on the total number of all new and existing LLAs in a population. LLA will be considered as the resection of the lower limb from just above the knee to any point down to the toe. If heterogeneity is low to moderate, a random-effects meta-analysis will be conducted on extracted crude prevalence/incidence rates, with the median and interquartile range also reported. The systematic review will be performed in accordance with the JBI guideline for prevalence and incidence review. Study reporting will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. Prospero registration number CRD42021238656."

https://openalex.org/W4226039482,"Deletion of the entire gene encoding the RarA protein of Escherichia coli results in a growth defect and additional deficiencies that were initially ascribed to a lack of RarA function. Further work revealed that most of the effects reflected the presence of sequences in the rarA gene that affect expression of the downstream gene, serS . The serS gene encodes the seryl aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. Decreases in the expression of serS can trigger the stringent response. The sequences that affect serS expression are located in the last 15 nucleotides of the rarA gene."
