https://openalex.org/W1987006553,"Shear-wave splitting of S and SKS phases reveals the anisotropy and strain field of the mantle beneath the subducting Nazca plate, Cocos plate, and the Caribbean region. These observations can be used to test models of mantle flow. Two-dimensional entrained mantle flow beneath the subducting Nazca slab is not consistent with the data. Rather, there is evidence for horizontal trench-parallel flow in the mantle beneath the Nazca plate along much of the Andean subduction zone. Trench-parallel flow is attributale utable to retrograde motion of the slab, the decoupling of the slab and underlying mantle, and a partial barrier to flow at depth, resulting in lateral mantle flow beneath the slab. Such flow facilitates the transfer of material from the shrinking mantle reservoir beneath the Pacific basin to the growing mantle reservoir beneath the Atlantic basin. Trenchparallel flow may explain the eastward motions of the Caribbean and Scotia sea plates, the anomalously shallow bathymetry of the eastern Nazca plate, the long-wavelength geoid high over western South America, and it may contribute to the high elevation and intense deformation of the central Andes."
https://openalex.org/W2060992957,"Distributed irreversible deformation in otherwise brittle ceramics (specifically, in silicon carbide and micaceous glass-ceramic) has been observed in Hertzian contacts. The deformation takes the form of an expanding microcrack damage zone below the contact circle, in place of the usual single propagating macrocrack (the Hertzian ""cone fracture"") outside. An important manifestation of this deformation is an effective ""ductility"" in the indentation stress-strain response. Control of the associated brittle-ductile transition is readily effected by appropriate design of weak interfaces, large and elongate grains, and high internal stresses in the ceramic microstructure."
https://openalex.org/W1977242824,"Simple discrete-time ecological models for a species with alternating reproduction and dispersal are shown to have complex transient dynamics. If the density dependence (nonlinearity) is strong enough, then the time required to reach the final dynamics is usually very long, approaching thousands of generations, and there are typically very sudden changes in the form of the dynamics. Apparent chaos can change to cycles or vice versa. These results are consistent with observed sudden changes in the form of the dynamics of a single species and imply that transient dynamics of ecological models may be more relevant than long-term behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2162224891,"The difference in carbon-13 ((13)C) contents of hopane and sterane biomarkers in the Monterey formation (Naples Beach, California) parallels the Miocene inorganic record of the change in (18)O (delta(18)O), reflecting the Miocene evolution from a well-mixed to a highly stratified photic zone (upper 100 meters) in the Pacific. Steranes (delta(13)C = 25.4 +/- 0.7 per mil versus the Pee Dee belemnite standard) from shallow photic-zone organisms do not change isotopically throughout the Miocene. In contrast, sulfur-bound C(35) hopanes (likely derived from bacterial plankton living at the base of the photic zone) have systematically decreasing (13)C concentrations in Middle and Late Miocene samples (delta(13)C = -29.5 to -31.5 per mil), consistent with the Middle Miocene formation of a carbon dioxide-rich cold water mass at the base of the photic zone."

An analysis of SP-converted phases confirms that the deep seismic zone consists of two layers separated by ∼20 kilometers. Numerical modeling of the thermal structure implies that the hypocenters are located along isotherms of 500° to 550°C, which is consistent with the hypothesis that deep earthquakes result from the phase transition of metastable olivine to a high-pressure phase in the subducting slab."
https://openalex.org/W2026611721,"Large-scale, westward-extending tongues of warm (Pacific) and cold (Atlantic) water are found between 2000 and 3000 meters both north and south of the equator in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. They are centered at 5 degrees to 8 degrees north and 10 degrees to 15 degrees south (Pacific) and 5 degrees to 8 degrees north and 15 degrees to 20 degrees south (Atlantic). They are separated in both oceans by a contrasting eastward-extending tongue, centered at about 1 degrees to 2 degrees south, in agreement with previous helium isotope observations (Pacific). Thus, the indicated deep tropical westward flows north and south of the equator and eastward flow near the equator may result from more general forcing than the hydrothermal forcing previously hypothesized."
https://openalex.org/W2058857014,"With low-temperature scanning electron microscopy, the magnetic flux states in high critical temperature Josephson junctions have been imaged. The experiments were performed with YBa(2)Cu(3)O(7-delta) thin-film grain boundary Josephson junctions fabricated on [001] tilt SrTiO(3) bicrystals. For applied magnetic fields parallel to the grain boundary plane, which correspond to local maxima of the magnetic field dependence of the critical current, the images clearly show the corresponding magnetic flux states in the grain boundary junction. The spatial modulation of the Josephson current density by the external magnetic field is imaged directly with a spatial resolution of about 1 micrometer."

https://openalex.org/W2093172206,"Two different research teams have taken a big step toward atom interferometry. They have succeeded in splitting atomic beams by using atoms in spin states that neither absorb nor reemit laser light. By proper adjustment of experimental conditions, atoms are changed from one spin state to another, without passing through the intermediary excited state. The atoms in essence absorb momentum from the laser photons, without absorption or emission of photons. The change in momentum deflects atoms in the proper spin state."
https://openalex.org/W2046960494,"One proposed solution to counteract greenhouse warming is the stimulation of phytoplankton growth in the oceans by the addition of iron. The excess phytoplankton would then absorb CO[sub 2] and sequester it in their bodies when they died. An experiment to test this hypothesis was carried out in the equatorial Pacific. Addition of Fe stimulated phytoplankton growth, but the technique may have limited value. The iron quickly forms particulates which sink and become unavailable to the phytoplankton."

Lee's Gene Future: The Promise and Perils of the New Biology (Plenum, New York, 1993) included a line of information that did not apply to that book. The price given for the book, $24.95, was correct."
