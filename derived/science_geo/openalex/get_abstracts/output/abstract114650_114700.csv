https://openalex.org/W1532900970,"Extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK) 1 and 2 and mutants of each were expressed in bacteria with a hexahistidine tag and purified using nickel-chelate chromatography. Basal activity of wild type ERK2 was approximately 2 nmol/min/mg. Self-catalyzed phosphorylation occurred in vitro on the major physiological site of tyrosine phosphorylation in an intramolecular reaction. Rabbit muscle ERK activator activated ERK2 500-1000-fold up to a specific activity (approximately 2 mumol/min/mg) approximating that of ERK1 purified from stimulated cells (Boulton, T.G., Gregory, J.S., and Cobb, M.H. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 278-286). ERK1 could also be activated by the ERK activator to the same extent. Mutants lacking the major site of tyrosine phosphorylation were autophosphorylated at a greatly reduced rate and were no longer highly activated by the ERK kinase. Mutants lacking the major site of threonine phosphorylation were autophosphorylated at the same or an enhanced rate, but the kinase activity of these mutants depended on the residue used to replace the threonine. Replacement by glutamate rendered the kinase capable of being activated by ERK activator, while replacement by alanine did not. Thus, the carboxyl group of glutamate can provide at least some of the features introduced by phosphothreonine in activated ERKs."

https://openalex.org/W1973822200,"T lymphocytes are produced in the thymus from precursors originating in the haemopoietic tissues. On entering the thymus, they undergo a programme of proliferation, T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement, differentiation and repertoire selection. Although the thymus provides a unique environment for these events, the role of the thymic stroma in regulating specific developmental stages is not well understood. We therefore devised an in vitro system to study the role of individual thymic stromal components in T-cell development. We report here that the development of TCR-CD4-CD8-T-cell precursors into TCR+ cells expressing CD4 and/or CD8 requires the presence of both major histocompatibility complex class II+ epithelial cells and fetal mesenchyme. The requirement for mesenchymal support can be mapped to the initial stages of intrathymic development because the later stages of maturation, from double-positive CD4+CD8+ thymocytes into single-positive CD4+ or CD8+ cells, can be supported by epithelial cells alone. We also show that the requirement for mesenchymal cells can be met by cells of the fibroblast line 3T3 (but not by supernatants from these cells). To our knowledge, these findings provide the first direct evidence that mesenchymal as well as epithelial cells are involved in T-cell development, and suggest that their involvement is stage-specific and likely to be dependent on short-range or contact-mediated interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2051525713,"A quantitative three-dimensional analysis of nuclear components involved in precursor messenger RNA metabolism was performed with a combination of fluorescence hybridization, immunofluorescence, and digital imaging microscopy. Polyadenylate [poly(A)] RNA-rich transcript domains were discrete, internal nuclear regions that formed a ventrally positioned horizontal array in monolayer cells. A dimmer, sometimes strand-like, poly(A) RNA signal was dispersed throughout the nucleoplasm. Spliceosome assembly factor SC-35 localized within the center of individual domains. These data support a nuclear model in which there is a specific topological arrangement of noncontiguous centers involved in precursor messenger RNA metabolism, from which RNA transport toward the nuclear envelope radiates."
https://openalex.org/W1481377618,"Members of the protein kinase C (PKC) family of serine/threonine kinases play a key role in regulating the differentiation and growth of diverse cell types and, to date, the cloning of seven mammalian PKC genes encoding eight distinct isoforms has been reported. Here we describe the molecular cloning and deduced primary structure of a cDNA encoding a novel PKC isoform, termed PKC theta, which was isolated in the course of attempts to identify PKC genes that are expressed selectively in hematopoietic cells. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers corresponding to conserved sequence motifs, which distinguish the PKC family from other protein kinases, were employed in polymerase chain reactions (PCR) to amplify partial core sequences of putative PKC genes from a human peripheral blood lymphocyte-derived cDNA library. DNA sequencing of selected clones revealed several PKC-related sequences, including one that, on the basis of sequence comparison with known PKC isoforms, represented a novel PKC isoform. The complete cDNA sequence was determined by anchored PCR cloning and sequencing the entire coding sequence, using cDNA derived from a human leukemic T cell line (Jurkat). Included within this approximately 2.7-kilobase pair cDNA is an open reading frame of 2,118 nucleotides encoding a putative 82-kDa protein. The deduced primary structure contains consensus sequences characteristic of protein kinase catalytic domains and, based on its amino acid sequence and domain structure, is a member of the PKC family. PKC theta displays the highest homology to PKC delta, lacks the Ca(2+)-binding C2 domain and, thus, belongs to the subfamily of Ca(2+)-independent PKC enzymes which also includes the delta, epsilon, zeta, and eta isoforms. RNase protection assays and semiquantitative PCR analysis indicated that, although PKC theta transcripts are expressed ubiquitously, the highest levels are found in hematopoietic tissues and cell lines, including T cells and thymocytes. In contrast, the expression levels in the brain and testes are considerably lower, and no transcripts were detected in several human carcinoma cell lines. A rabbit antiserum raised against a unique (V3 domain) bacterially expressed PKC theta fragment immunoprecipitated specifically an 82-kDa protein from Jurkat cell lysates. Thus, PKC theta represents an additional member of the PKC family, and its predominant expression in hematopoietic cells suggests that it may play a role in signal transduction and growth regulatory pathways unique to these cells."
https://openalex.org/W2050888116,"The x-ray crystal structure of a peptide designed to form a double-stranded parallel coiled coil shows that it is actually a triple-stranded coiled coil formed by three alpha-helices. Unlike the designed parallel coiled coil, the helices run up-up-down. The structure is stabilized by a distinctive hydrophobic interface consisting of eight layers. As in the design, each alpha-helix in the coiled coil contributes one leucine side chain to each layer. The structure suggests that hydrophobic interactions are a dominant factor in the stabilization of coiled coils. The stoichiometry and geometry of coiled coils are primarily determined by side chain packing in the solvent-inaccessible interior, but electrostatic interactions also contribute."
https://openalex.org/W2066609954,"Attempts to correlate behavioral learning with cellular changes, such as increased synaptic efficacy, have often relied on increased extracellular potentials as an index of enhanced synaptic strength. A recent example is the enlarged excitatory field potentials in the dentate gyrus of rats that are learning spatial relations by exploration. The altered hippocampal field potentials do not reflect learning-specific cellular changes but result from a concomitant rise in brain temperature that is caused by the associated muscular effort. Enhanced dentate field excitatory potentials followed both passive and active heating and were linearly related to the brain temperature. These temperature-related effects may mask any learning-induced changes in field potential."
https://openalex.org/W1506695253,"A DNA segment that is highly conserved in glucokinase (hexokinase IV) and hexokinase I cDNA was used to identify specific cDNAs in a library prepared from rat adipose tissue mRNA. Some of these cDNAs were identified as being hexokinase I cDNA. Others, although similar to both the glucokinase and hexokinase I cDNAs, were unique. Two of these unique cDNAs overlapped and contained an open reading frame that encoded a protein of 103 kDa which, when expressed in Escherichia coli, had kinetic properties characteristic of hexokinase II. The entire hexokinase II mRNA sequence and the exon-intron structure of the hexokinase II gene were determined. A single transcription initiation site and two distinct termination sites account for the two observed hexokinase II RNA species of 5500 and 4400 nucleotides that were detected when either of the cDNAs was used as a hybridization probe against poly(A)+ RNA isolated from rat adipose tissue. Hexokinase II mRNA was decreased in adipose tissue from diabetic rats, but was restored by insulin treatment to levels found in nondiabetic control rats. Insulin also induced hexokinase II mRNA in two adipose cell lines (3T3-F442A and BFC-1B) and two skeletal muscle cell lines (C2C12 and L6). In L6 cells, this increase was accounted for by a corresponding increase of hexokinase II gene transcription. Comparison of the structures of the hexokinase II and glucokinase genes support the hypothesis that the 100-kDa hexokinase arose by gene duplication and tandem ligation of a 50-kDa glucokinase-like ancestral gene."
https://openalex.org/W2089586101,"A novel polyiron oxo complex, [FeIII4FeII8(O)2(OCH3)18(O2CCH3)6(CH3OH) 4.67] (1), has been prepared from ferrous acetate and lithium methoxide in methanol by slow addition of dioxygen. The three-dimensional close-packed layered structure found in 1 closely mimics that proposed for the inorganic core in the iron storage protein ferritin. The MÃ¶ssbauer spectra of 1 reveal superparamagnetic relaxation at temperatures below 15 K, a property characteristic of the ferritin core. The small size and mixed-valent nature of 1 suggest that it is a reasonable model for intermediates formed in the biomineralization of iron during ferritin core formation. A related compound, with the same iron-oxygen framework found in 1 but containing only two ferric ions, has also been structurally characterized. Because the clusters exhibit properties of both discrete molecules and extended solids, they are representative of a new class of nanometer-sized compounds that bridge the molecular solid-state boundary."
https://openalex.org/W1930098850,"The induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) activity has been implicated in the antiproliferative action of interferon (IFN)-gamma on tumor cells and the inhibition of intracellular pathogens. Earlier studies have demonstrated that the expression of the IDO gene is induced strongly by IFN-gamma, but very poorly by IFN-alpha despite the presence of a sequence highly homologous to the IFN-alpha-responsive sequence element (interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE)) in its IFN-gamma-responsive control region. In addition, a sequence with a partial homology to the IFN-gamma-responsive sequence (GAS) identified by Lew et al. (Lew, D.J., Decker, T., Strehlow, I., and Darnell, J.E., Jr. (1991) Mol. Cell. Biol. 11, 182-191) in a human gene for a guanylate-binding protein and to the X box sequence found in all major histocompatibility complex class II genes was found. Deletion experiments have indicated that the ISRE homolog (but not the GAS-related or the X box-related sequence) was essential for an inducibility by IFN-gamma. To investigate the lack of inducibility by IFN-alpha despite the presence of an ISRE homolog, the binding of this ISRE homolog to the IFN-alpha-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) was examined. Gel mobility shift experiments and competition experiments indicated that this ISRE homolog did not form a stable complex with ISGF3. This may account for a poor inducibility by IFN-alpha. This inability to bind ISGF3 appears to be (at least in part) due to minor differences between the nucleotide sequence of the ISRE homolog present in the IDO gene promoter and the ISRE consensus sequence found in IFN-alpha-inducible genes. An IFN-gamma-inducible DNA-binding factor was identified with characteristics different from ISGF3: (i) the IFN-gamma-inducible factor was detected in the nuclear extracts, but not in the cytoplasmic extracts; and (ii) the appearance of this DNA-binding factor required new protein synthesis, which could explain the dependence on new protein synthesis for the induction of IDO by IFN-gamma."
https://openalex.org/W1568842777,"The 5' upstream region of the murine beta-myosin heavy chain (MHC) gene has been isolated and tested for its ability to drive gene expression in transgenic mice. Three classes of transgenic mice were generated. The constructs contained approximately 5000, 2500, and 600 base pairs of beta-MHC upstream sequence fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene and were termed beta 5, beta 2.5, and beta .6, respectively. Muscle-specific expression was observed with all three constructs. However, only the beta 5 lines directed high levels of muscle-specific transgene expression in both pre- and postbirth mice. Expression driven by the two shorter constructs was two to three orders of magnitude lower when the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase specific activities were compared. These data suggest that a distal-positive element directs high levels of gene expression in the ventricle and in slow skeletal muscles. Analyses of transgene expression during heart maturation revealed that some of the beta 5 lines were not able to respond in an appropriate manner to developmental transcriptional cues. Unlike the endogenous beta-MHC gene, which is down regulated in the ventricles around the time of birth, reporter gene expression in the majority of the lines generated was not shut off in the ventricles of the adult animals. These data indicate that high levels of muscle-specific beta-MHC gene expression are dependent upon the combinatorial interactions of a number of sequence elements that are distributed over a large region of the gene's upstream sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1997729857,"In the elongation cycle of bacterial protein synthesis the interaction between elongation factor-Tu (EF-Tu).guanosine triphosphate (GTP), aminoacyl-transfer RNA (aa-tRNA), and messenger RNA-programmed ribosomes is associated with the hydrolysis of GTP. This interaction determines the selection of the proper aa-tRNA for incorporation into the polypeptide. In the canonical scheme, one molecule of GTP is hydrolyzed in the EF-Tu-dependent binding of aa-tRNA to the ribosome, and a second molecule is hydrolyzed in the elongation factor-G (EF-G)-mediated translocation of the polypeptide from the ribosomal A site to the P site. Substitution of Asp138 with Asn in EF-Tu changed the substrate specificity from GTP to xanthosine triphosphate and demonstrated that the EF-Tu-mediated reactions involved the hydrolysis of two nucleotide triphosphates for each Phe incorporated. This stoichiometry of two is associated with the binding of the correct aa-tRNA to the ribosome."
https://openalex.org/W1581013366,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae vacuolar protein sorting mutant, vps16, exhibits pleiotropic defects in vacuolar protein targeting and vacuole morphology. To understand the role of the VPS16 gene in vacuolar protein sorting and organelle assembly, a vps16 ts mutant was used to clone the wild-type gene. DNA sequence analysis identified a single open reading frame within a vps16 complementing DNA fragment, capable of encoding a protein of 92,000 Da. Hydrophobicity analysis indicates that the Vps16 protein (Vps16p) is hydrophilic and contains no obvious signal sequence or membrane spanning domains. Gene disruption experiments have shown that VPS16 is not essential. delta vps16 cells exhibit, 1) a severe defect in vacuolar protein sorting; 2) a ts growth defect; 3) a grossly abnormal vacuole morphology, no normal vacuole compartment(s) is present; and 4) a defect in alpha-factor processing. A trpE-Vps16 fusion protein has been used to generate polyclonal antiserum. This antiserum detects an unglycosylated protein of 90,000 Da. Subcellular fractionation studies indicate that the vast majority of the VPS16 gene product is associated with a particulate cell fraction. This association is resistant to detergent and salt extractions, but Vps16p can be extracted with 6 M urea and alkali buffer. In addition, overexpression of Vps16p appears to saturate the association sites available in this sedimentable structure. These data indicate that Vps16p may be specifically associated with a large protein complex, or with a limited number of sites on cytoskeletal elements of the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1549702212,"Cis-unsaturated fatty acids activate soluble protein kinase C (PKC) in vitro and in intact platelets. The following studies were conducted to determine the effects of oleate on individual isoenzymes of PKC in human platelets. Human platelets were found to contain predominantly PKC alpha, beta I, beta II, and delta with minor immunoreactivity for PKC epsilon, zeta, and eta. In intact platelets, sodium oleate caused a time-dependent redistribution of PKC alpha, beta II, and delta from cytosol to membrane fractions with little effects on PKC beta I. On the other hand, PMA and thrombin induced translocation of all four isoenzymes of PKC. In vitro, oleate partially activated (50% of Vmax) purified calcium-dependent PKC (alpha, beta I, and beta II) with an EC50 of 50 microM whereas it fully activated (100% of Vmax) purified calcium-independent PKC (predominantly delta) with an EC50 of 5 microM. The selective effects of oleate on PKC isoenzymes were investigated in platelet cytosol which contains endogenous PKC and its physiologic substrates. Under these conditions, oleate potently activated calcium-independent PKC causing the phosphorylation of the 40-kDa substrate. Activation of calcium-dependent isoforms occurred only at higher concentrations of oleate. Thus, oleate activates multiple isoenzymes of PKC with predominant effects on calcium-independent PKC."
https://openalex.org/W1573580543,"The 5-lipoxygenase catalyzes the first two steps in the metabolism of arachidonic acid to leukotrienes. It has been shown that the calcium influx into leukocytes following stimulation by A23187 activates the enzyme and causes its translocation to the membrane. Leukotrienes are formed, and then the enzyme seems to be irreversibly inactivated. In the present investigation we have compared the effect of receptor-mediated mast cell activation (IgE/antigen) and A23187 on 5-lipoxygenase activity and translocation to the membrane. In contrast to the ionophore, IgE/antigen, which initiated the formation of similar amounts of leukotrienes as A23187, caused minor inactivation of the enzyme. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that after antigen the membrane association of the 5-lipoxygenase was reversible, while with A23187 the translocation continued during the time of observation (60 min). Addition of a calcium chelator after ionophore challenge, prevented further inactivation of the enzyme and reversed its membrane binding. The data suggest that the continuous influx of calcium with A23187 is responsible for the extensive inactivation of the 5-lipoxygenase. In contrast, during receptor-mediated stimulation the transient increase in intracellular calcium seems to conserve the enzyme activity."
https://openalex.org/W1555253559,"Only serine phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor-4E (eIF-4E) has been previously reported in intact cells. We found that treatment of HepG2 cells with okadaic acid resulted in as much as 20% of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-4E phosphorylation occurring on threonine residues and that tryptic phosphopeptide maps showed several previously unrecognized phosphopeptides. Analysis of p220 from control and okadaic acid-treated cells demonstrated serine and threonine phosphorylation under both conditions. However, a unique pattern of phosphopeptides in okadaic acid-treated cells was observed. The most notable finding was that hyperphosphorylation of eIF-4E and p220 increased binding of p220 but not eIF-4E to the m7GTP cap structure. We suggest that phosphorylation of eIF-4E is more complicated than previously recognized and that hyperphosphorylation of eIF-4E and p220 recruits more p220 into the protein complex that associates with mRNA caps. A better understanding of these protein-protein and protein-mRNA interactions may aid the design of anti-sense directed chemistries that disrupt such interactions for a specific target mRNA (Baker, B.F., Miraglia, L., and Hagedorn, C. H. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 11495-11499)."
https://openalex.org/W1555964835,"The expression of thrombospondin 1 (TSP 1), a member of the TSP gene family, is rapidly induced by growth factors. We tested the ability of human TSP 1-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs to respond to serum in stably transfected NIH-3T3 cells. Two transcriptional elements in the TSP 1 promoter, a distal element at -1280 and a proximal element at -65, were required for the response of the human TSP 1 gene to serum. The distal element contains the 5'-CC(A + T)6GG-3' consensus sequence characteristic of a serum-response element (SRE). Deletions or mutations in this element reduced the serum response of the TSP 1 gene by 80-90%. In gel-shift assays, the -1280 element and the c-fos SRE cross-competed, whereas their functional and binding mutants did not. The proximal element contains the sequence 5'-GGCCAATGGG-3', which closely resembles the consensus binding motif for the CCAAT-binding factor NF-Y (CBF, CP1, alpha CP1). Deletions or mutations in this element also reduced the serum response by 80-90%. Methylation interference analysis of the -65 region identified a pattern of contacts with nuclear factors resembling that for NF-Y, and an NF-Y-binding site and the proximal TSP 1 element cross-competed in gel-shift assays, whereas their binding mutants did not. Finally, an abbreviated TSP 1 promoter/5'-flank, containing the SRE- and NF-Y-binding sites, mediated a serum response that was close in magnitude to that of the parent promoter. We conclude that the serum response of the human TSP 1 gene requires the coordinated function of an SRE- and NF-Y-binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1647430407,"We have developed an intermediate method toward the complete carbohydrate analysis of proteins, which should be universally applicable to all proteins and independent of sample matrix. Using only Coomassie Blue-stained proteins which have been electroblotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes, we report a strategy for: (i) determining unequivocally whether a protein is glycosylated; (ii) obtaining a complete monosaccharide composition; (iii) oligosaccharide mapping which separates most forms according to size, charge and isomerity; and (iv) sequentially releasing and analyzing specific classes of oligosaccharides with endoglycosidases. The method was shown to be applicable to a variety of well characterized soluble glycoproteins and to the membrane-bound protein, the gastric H+, K(+)-ATPase. The monosaccharide composition of the H+,K(+)-ATPase revealed the absence of N-acetylneuraminic or N-glycolylneuraminic acids and a monosaccharide composition which indicated O-linked sugar chains. Oligomannosidic/hybrid and biantennary oligosaccharides were sequentially released and analyzed from one electroblotted band of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator using endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H and endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase F2, respectively. Sialylated polylactosamine structures were identified and quantified by analyzing high performance liquid chromatography profiles of oligosaccharides first released by peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase and then treated with endo-beta-galactosidase, using a single, stained band of recombinant erythropoietin. This recombinant erythropoietin was found to contain eight times more tetrasialylated oligosaccharides than previously reported (Sasaki, H., Bothner, B., Dell, A., and Fukuda, M. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 12059-12076); 47% of released oligosaccharides were identified as polylactosamine structures."
https://openalex.org/W1500857509,"A20 was originally identified as a primary tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF)-responsive gene, which encodes a 790-amino acid zinc finger protein. A20 is expressed in a wide variety of cell lines, including fibroblasts, in which A20 expression protects cells from TNF cytotoxicity. An analysis of A20 expression in lymphocytic and monocytic cells lines revealed that A20 protein expression correlates with lymphocyte activation and monocyte differentiation. A20 expression was also induced in Jurkat T cells expressing the human T cell leukemia virus type I Tax protein. Transient transfection studies demonstrated that stimulation of A20 transcription by TNF, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and Tax was mediated by two kappa B elements within the A20 promoter. Accordingly, DNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed inducible binding of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) to a promoter fragment containing both A20 kappa B elements. Analysis of individual A20 kappa B sites revealed that both kappa B sites were required for TNF or PMA activation of the A20 promoter; however, Tax activation required only one kappa B site. Overexpression of NF-kappa B subunits activated the wild type A20 promoter, but did not activate mutated forms containing single kappa B sites. Thus, Tax activation of A20 transcription occurs through a mechanism distinct from PMA and TNF, possibly due to differential activation of NF-kappa B complexes or transcriptional cofactors."
https://openalex.org/W1534133896,"The HIV-1 transactivator protein Tat is essential for viral gene expression and replication. Tat is taken up by cells and transactivates the HIV-LTR promoter in the cell nucleus. The present studies show that cells adhere to both synthetic and recombinant Tat, and, using synthetic peptides, we localize the binding site to a region spanning amino acid residues 49-57 (peptide Tat49-57). Tat49-57 also inhibited cell attachment to solid phase full-length Tat peptide and to recombinant Tat protein. Using Tat peptide affinity chromatography, we identified a 90-kDa cell surface protein that binds to Tat. The 90-kDa protein could be eluted from the Tat column using the Tat49-57 peptide. A 90-kDa cell surface Tat binding protein was also identified by coprecipitation with Tat after incubation with radiolabeled cell membrane preparations. Co-precipitation of the 90-kDa protein was inhibited by competition with a Tat49-65 peptide, but not with Tat55-86. Our findings suggest that cellular attachment to Tat is mediated through a 90-kDa cell surface protein that binds to a Tat domain between amino acids 49 and 57."
https://openalex.org/W1571963208,"The signal peptidase complex (SPC) is a hetero-oligomeric membrane protein containing subunits of 12, 18, 21, 22/23, and 25 kDa. The 18- and 21-kDa subunits are mammalian homologs of SEC11 protein, which is necessary for signal peptide processing and cell viability in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The functional and/or structural contributions of the 12-, 22/23-, and 25-kDa subunits to SPC activity have not yet been elucidated. To explore the structure of SPC subunits and their relationships to signal peptide processing and protein translocation, we have examined their endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane topology and biogenesis. Signal peptidase activity and SPC subunits are resistant to protease treatment in intact and detergent-solubilized membranes. Heat-denatured SPC subunits and SPC subunits translated in vitro are, however, protease sensitive, suggesting that the assembly of the oligomeric complex confers protease resistance. To define the membrane topology of SPC subunits, both wild-type subunits and subunit fusion proteins containing additional sites for N-linked glycosylation were assembled into microsomal membranes in vitro. Despite the presence of multiple hydrophobic domains, each subunit is anchored to the ER membrane by a single amino-terminal transmembrane domain in an Ncytoplasmic Cexoplasmic (type II) orientation. This topology places the bulk of the protein mass in the ER lumen and positions a putative serine-containing active site domain in SPC 18 and 21 at the same relative distance from the membrane as the analogous region in Escherichia coli leader peptidase. These studies have also revealed that, in spite of the temporal and perhaps physical association of the SPC with the process of protein translocation, SPC subunits integrate into the ER membrane by a signal recognition particle-dependent pathway and, hence, rely on the existence of a preformed translocation apparatus for their own membrane assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1654003177,"The hyperthermophilic Archaea represent some of the most ancient organisms on earth. A study of enzymatic cofactors in these organisms could provide basic information on the origins of related cofactors in man and other more recently evolved organisms. To this end, the nature of the tungsten cofactor in aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductases from Pyrococcus furiosus and ES-4 and in formaldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductases from P. furiosus and Thermococcus litoralis has been investigated. All four proteins contain molybdopterin, previously characterized as the organic component of the molybdenum cofactor in a large number of molybdoenzymes. Molybdopterin was identified by conversion to the dicarboxamidomethyl derivative by alkylation of the vicinal sulfhydryl groups on the pterin side chain and by conversion to the oxidized fluorescent derivative, Form A. The pterin of the tungsten cofactor in the four enzymes was examined for the presence of appended GMP, CMP, AMP, or IMP previously observed in molybdenum cofactors of some molybdoenzymes. No evidence for the presence of a molybdopterin dinucleotide or other modified form of molybdopterin was obtained. These results further document the essential nature of molybdopterin for the function of molybdenum and tungsten enzymes in diverse life forms."
https://openalex.org/W1557763992,"Adherence of cells to extracellular matrix components modulates cellular responses. Here we compared the array of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins induced by the aggregation of the high affinity receptor for IgE (Fc epsilon RI) in fibronectin-adherent and in nonadherent rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells. Adherence to fibronectin in the absence of Fc epsilon RI aggregation induced tyrosine phosphorylation of 105-115-kDa proteins. This phosphorylation was reversed by EDTA and by a synthetic peptide containing the sequence Arg-Gly-Asp, demonstrating a requirement for fibronectin-integrin interaction. Aggregation of Fc epsilon RI in fibronectin-adherent cells markedly enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of the same 105-115-kDa proteins. There were minimal differences in tyrosine phosphorylation of other proteins induced by the aggregation of Fc epsilon RI in nonadherent and in fibronectin-adherent cells. Direct activation of protein kinase C and/or increase in calcium influx induced the phosphorylation of the 105-115-kDa proteins only in fibronectin-adherent cells. The magnitude of the phosphorylation of the 105-115-kDa proteins induced by the aggregation of Fc epsilon RI in fibronectin-adherent cells was substantially greater than the sum of that due to adherence to fibronectin and the aggregation of Fc epsilon RI in nonadherent cells. Therefore, cell adherence and the aggregation of Fc epsilon RI synergistically regulate tyrosine phosphorylation of the 105-115 kDa proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1567963271,"The promoter regions of several radiation-inducible genes contain AP-1 cis-acting regulatory elements that are dependent upon protein kinase C signaling. We analyzed nuclear protein from irradiated human tumor cell lines for binding to the AP-1 consensus sequence. The increase in nuclear protein binding following irradiation was specific for the AP-1 sequence and was reduced by antibodies to c-Jun and c-Fos. The AP-1 DNA binding sequence was found to regulate transcription in irradiated cells and mutation of the AP-1 site within the c-jun promoter abolished transcriptional induction by radiation. The gene encoding the chimeric transcription factor Gal4-Jun5-253, which includes the DNA binding region of Gal4 and the transcriptional regulatory region of c-Jun, was cotransfected with the reporter plasmid with Gal4 binding sequences (G5B-CAT). Transfection of RIT-3 and HeLa cells revealed that the regulatory region of Jun was sufficient to activate transcription following irradiation. Conversely, Hep G2 cells, which do not contain the cell type-specific Jun repressor, were not responsive to radiation-induced Jun activation. The c-Jun repressor was found to regulate Jun activation by experiments using the expression vector CMV-jun, which competes for Jun inhibitor and eliminates radiation-induction of Jun. We propose transcription factor dissociation from inhibitor proteins may participate in the initiation of cellular responses to ionizing radiation."
https://openalex.org/W1490895840,"We report the cloning of two full-length cDNAs coding for the human beta 1-integrin which diverge from each other for their 5'-untranslated sequences. Characterization of a genomic clone containing these two sequences showed that they are contiguous, spaced by 261 nucleotides, and both followed by donor splice sites. Analysis by primer extension and transient transfection in a human osteogenic sarcoma cell line (MG-63) demonstrated the existence of two independent promoters for transcription initiation. The two promoter regions are very G+C-rich, and lack both a TATA box and a CAAT box. Northern blot analysis showed that transcripts starting from the distal promoter (with respect to the first coding exon) are at least 20-fold more abundant than transcripts originating from the proximal one. The levels of both transcripts increase after transforming growth factor-beta 1 induction, however, mRNAs originating from the proximal promoter increase at an higher extent. Reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction analysis performed on different human tissues and cell lines revealed that, while the distal promoter is ubiquitously active, the proximal promoter is not. These findings suggest a possible complex pattern for regulation of the human beta 1-integrin gene expression."

A series of [omega-125I]iodo-fatty acids was synthesized in order to elucidate the myristyl group's contribution to the membrane association of pp60v-src, the transforming protein of Rous sarcoma virus. In vitro translation of v-src mRNA was employed to monitor incorporation of myristyl analogs into pp60v-src polypeptide. 12-Iodododecanoic, 13-iodotridecanoic, and 14-iodotetradecanoic acids were selectively incorporated in vitro into pp60v-src. One-dimensional peptide analysis confirmed that the analogs were attached to the N terminus of pp60v-src. Upon addition of membranes, the Src proteins modified by these analogs bound to membranes at levels comparable with or slightly less than the myristyl parent. Myristyl analogs were also shown to be incorporated into pp60v-src in vivo. Fractionation of [omega-125I]iodo-fatty acid labeled cells showed that 12-iododecanoic acid, 13-iodotridecanoic acid, and 14-iodotetradecanoic acid modified pp60v-src associated preferentially with the membrane fractions. These results demonstrate that fatty acyl groups one carbon longer or shorter than myristate can be accommodated within the membrane binding site for pp60v-src and illustrate the utility of in vitro systems for predicting analog behavior in vivo. We anticipate that iodinated fatty acids can be used as tools to aid in clarifying the role of the fatty acid in a variety of myristylated molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1488340603,"Dynamic lysine methylation of histone H3 in alfalfa tissue culture cells was studied by labeling with tritiated methionine, purification of variants H3.1 and H3.2 by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and amino acid analysis. Mono- and dimethyl-L-lysine were the major labeled amino acids. Within 100 h of continued growth conversion from N epsilon-monomethyl-L-lysine (MML) to N epsilon-dimethyl-L-lysine (DML) and N epsilon-trimethyl-L-lysine (TML) was observed, consistent with steady-state histone methylation. During the same time 20% of the methylation label was lost from major variant H3.1 protein and more than 50% from the more highly labeled minor variant H3.2. A similar pattern of label incorporation and loss was observed during a study of histone synthesis and turnover. This conforms with the general observation in animal cells that lysine methylation is limited to newly synthesized histone. Increased methylation of the more highly acetylated forms of histone H3 protein indicates limited accessibility of chromatin for histone methylation. After loss of the labile fraction of newly synthesized H3 variants, stably methylated proteins with 30% of the label in MML, 40% in DML, and 25% in TML remain. Turnover of methyl modification groups independent of histone turnover was not detected."
https://openalex.org/W1602734422,"Abstract The divalent metal-isocitrate site of pig heart NADP-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase can be located by affinity cleavage of the enzyme by Fe(2+)-isocitrate in the presence of O2, in analogy to the chemical nuclease action of DNA-binding drugs linked to Fe-EDTA. The enzyme is irreversibly inactivated and cleaved by Fe(2+)-isocitrate more rapidly than by Fe2+. Mn2+ prevents inactivation and cleavage by Fe(2+)-isocitrate or by Fe2+. Furthermore, other tri- or dicarboxylates (such as citrate, tricarballylate, or malate), which are not effective substrates of the enzyme, fail to promote inactivation and cleavage of the enzyme by Fe2+. These results indicate that the oxidative inactivation and cleavage reactions are specific. Two pairs of major peptides are generated during Fe(2+)-isocitrate inactivation: 30 + 17 kDa and 35 + 11 kDa, as compared with 46 kDa for the intact enzyme. NH2-terminal sequencing revealed that these peptides arise by a mutually exclusive cleavage at either Asp253-Met254 or His309-Gly310, suggesting Asp253 and His309 as coordination sites for Fe(2+)-isocitrate and, by implication, for Mn(2+)-isocitrate. Fe2+ alone produces peptides (32 + 15 kDa) by an alternate specific cleavage between Tyr272 and Asp273, consistent with free metal ion occupying a different site from metal-isocitrate in NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase. Affinity cleavage may be a generally useful method for locating metal and metal-substrate sites in enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1565390596,"Sternal chondrocytes of 17-day-old chick embryos in serum-free agarose culture secrete transforming growth factor-beta. Media conditioned by such cells prevent serum-induced chondrocyte hypertrophy and cause a phenotypic modulation in serum-free culture which is similar to that observed for chondrocytes in monolayer culture. The modulated cells lose the round shape of differentiated chondrocytes and increasingly with time resemble tendon fibroblasts embedded into agarose. In addition, they produce less matrix macromolecules which include collagen I rather than cartilage collagens II, IX, X, and XI. All of these effects are abolished upon addition to the conditioned media of a monoclonal antibody against recombinant human transforming growth factor-beta 2. The same factor caused effects closely similar to those elicited by conditioned media. Therefore, the phenotypic modulation in adhesion-dependent cultures of chondrocytes in vitro does not directly result from cell-matrix interactions but can be produced also in suspension culture under the direction of appropriate diffusible stimuli that include transforming growth factor-beta. In addition, the results support the concept of transforming growth factor-beta as a multifunctional cytokine acting differently on cells of the same developmental origin depending on their stage of differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1480337251,"Abstract In the brain, thyroid hormone dynamically regulates levels of the short-lived plasma membrane protein, type II iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase. In cultured astrocytes, thyroxine modulates deiodinase levels by activating cytoskeletal-plasma membrane interactions that increase the rate of inactivation of the enzyme. Here we characterized the effects of these thyroxine-dependent cytoskeletal interactions upon the route of internalization of the deiodinase by following the intracellular transit of the affinity-labeled substrate-binding subunit of the deiodinase (p29). Thyroxine rapidly induced the inactivation of the deiodinase and initiated the binding of p29 to F-actin. By 40 min, > 75% of the p29 had been transported to an endosomal pool, which was followed by dissociation of the F-actin-p29 complex. There was no significant accumulation of p29 in the dense lysosomes seen in the presence of thyroxine. In the absence of thyroxine, p29 was internalized and transported to the dense lysosomes at a rate parallel to the inactivation rate of the deiodinase (t1/2 0.75 and 0.64 h, respectively) without involvement with the microfilaments. These data demonstrate that thyroxine targets type II iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase to an endosomal pool by activating specific protein-F-actin interactions involved in microfilament-mediated intracellular protein trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W1857201799,"Brefeldin A has proven to be a useful pharmacologic tool, which, when added to mammalian cells, results in a block in secretion as well as the structural disruption of specific intracellular organelles. In spite of our understanding of some of the biochemistry underlying the action of brefeldin A, the most proximal molecular target(s) of the drug remain elusive. In attempting to address this problem, a genetic approach will undoubtedly prove useful and complementary to the biochemical identification of such a site(s). As a result of the relatively resistant nature of wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae to brefeldin A, an approach utilizing yeast genetics has not been possible. We report the selective sensitivity of three drug-sensitive strains of S. cerevisiae (ise-1, ISE-2, and erg6) with enhanced membrane permeability allowing uptake of brefeldin A. Upon addition of the drug, growth is dramatically inhibited and invertase secretion is rapidly, specifically, and reversibly blocked at the level of the endoplasmic reticulum. In addition, only structural analogues of brefeldin A effective in mammalian cells are active in these yeast strains."
https://openalex.org/W1590607347,"The final steps in assembly of the lytic pore formed by staphylococcal alpha-hemolysin (alpha HL) involve the formation of a nonlytic oligomeric pore precursor, followed by the formation of a transmembrane channel. In this study, truncation mutants of alpha HL encompassing the NH2-terminal or COOH-terminal half of the polypeptide chain and all, part, or none of the central glycine-rich loop were obtained by in vitro, coupled transcription and translation of mutant plasmid DNAs. These polypeptides were unable to oligomerize upon or cause lysis of rabbit erythrocytes (rRBCs). Twenty-one pairs of the same truncation mutants constituting discontinuous alpha HL chains with overlaps, nicks, and gaps in the central loop were obtained by cotranslation. When incubated with rRBCs, many of the pairs were able to form hetero-oligomers with wild-type alpha-hemolysin (s-alpha HL) and most of these formed homo-oligomers in the absence of s-alpha HL. However, only members of a subset of these pairs were able to lyse the cells. The lytic combinations contained overlaps, nicks, or gaps, but only two pairs, with nicks between amino acid residues 128 and 129 and between 131 and 132 had hemolytic activities approaching that of the wild-type polypeptide. Active combinations could also be obtained by separately translating NH2- and COOH-terminal truncation mutants and then combining them. These findings suggest that the integrity of the central loop is of little significance for oligomer formation but that it is more important for the final step in pore assembly or alternatively for determining the correct structure of the conductive channel. Our findings disagree with previous reports of NH2- and COOH-terminal fragments with hemolytic activity and of the prevention of hemolysis by proteolytic cleavage in the central loop. This discord is attributed to experimental and interpretative ambiguities in the earlier protein chemistry. For example, we show that loss of hemolytic activity after treatment with trypsin is not due to cleavage after Lys-131, as previously proposed, but to the removal of a small NH2-terminal peptide through cleavage after Lys-8."
https://openalex.org/W1546687907,"The TyrR protein of Escherichia coli K12 is a homodimer containing 513 amino acids/subunit. This protein is important in the transcriptional regulation of several genes whose protein products catalyze steps in aromatic amino acid biosynthesis or transport. Methods were developed for efficiently purifying the TyrR protein to apparent homogeneity. We analyzed the pattern of cleavage of the TyrR protein by trypsin, either in the absence of ligands or in the presence of saturating levels of L-tyrosine, ATP, or poly(dI-dC). At low (1:200 ratio by weight) trypsin levels, in the absence of ligands, two major digestion products accumulated. These were polypeptides of 22 and 31 kDa, shown to contain amino acid residues 1-190 and 191-467, respectively. The pattern of trypsin cleavage was unaffected by tyrosine. In the presence of ATP, an intermediate species of 53 kDa, probably containing amino acid residues 1-467, was observed. The kinetics of appearance of the 53-kDa species were consistent with a role for ATP in accelerating the hydrolysis of the R467-F468 peptide bond. The 53-kDa polypeptide underwent further tryptic hydrolysis to yield fragments of 22 and 31 kDa. When both tyrosine and ATP were present, the rate of formation of the 22- and 31-kDa fragments was more rapid than in the absence of these ligands. It appears that when both ligands are bound, the rates of hydrolysis of peptide bonds R190-Q191 and R467-F468 are both enhanced. Additional limited proteolysis experiments suggested that polypeptide segment 191-467 contains ATP binding site(s), and that the rate of cleavage of peptide bonds R190-Q191 and R467-F468 is altered when the TyrR protein interacts with poly(dI-dC), an analog of target DNA. Our results reveal the presence of two major structural domains within the TyrR protein. The first domain (amino acid residues 1-190) is extremely resistant to hydrolysis by trypsin. The second domain (residues 191-467), which is likely to contain ATP-binding site(s), is homologous to several other transcriptional activators specific for promoters responsive to the sigma 54 form of RNA polymerase. The remainder of the TyrR protein (residues 468-513) contains the operator recognition elements, probably arranged in the form of a helix-turn-helix motif. This polypeptide segment was not detected as a discrete tryptic hydrolysis product."
https://openalex.org/W1617934133,"Histone synthesis in alfalfa tissue culture cells was studied by labeling with tritiated lysine, purification of histone proteins by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and fluorography of acid/urea/Triton X-100 polyacrylamide gels. Minor histone variant H3.2 was synthesized twice as fast as major variant H3.1. The predicted difference in histone H3 variant turnover was examined during continued growth. More than 50% of newly synthesized histone H3.2 and 20% of new H3.1 were lost from chromatin over a period of 100 h. This produced a ratio between the stable remaining portions of each new histone H3 variant protein identical to that of the steady-state histone H3 variants. The labile portion of new histone H3.2 (half-life of 20 h) was rapidly lost specifically from transcriptionally active chromatin as judged by the acetylation level of nearly 1.5 acetylated lysines/histone molecule, a level 50% higher than the acetylation in histone H3.2 overall and three times that of histone H3.1. These results and the constitutive level of H3.2 gene expression identify histone H3.2 of alfalfa as a functional replacement histone variant. The extent of its preferential assembly into active chromatin nucleosomes and the rapid rate of its subsequent loss indicate significant dissolution of plant nucleosomes during gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1516723629,"Chimeric proteins consisting of a fusion between binding-deficient mutants of diphtheria toxin (DT) or Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE) and a single-chain antibody (E6 sFv) against the human transferrin receptor (TfnR) were expressed in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. Molecules utilizing PE40 (the carboxyl terminus 40 kDa of PE, lacking the binding domain) exhibited significant E6 sFv-mediated, cell type-specific cytotoxicity (IC50 1 x 10(-10) M) against a human erythroleukemia-derived cell line, K562. In contrast, a fusion protein between the same sFv and a DT mutant, DTM1 (containing two amino acid substitutions in the binding domain [S(508)F, S(525)F]) was not significantly cytotoxic, despite being enzymatically active. A tripartite protein in the form NH2-DTM1-E6 sFv-PE40-COOH exhibited cytotoxicity comparable to that of the PE40-sFv fusion (IC50 1 x 10(-10) M), suggesting that the deficit in activity of DTM1-sFv is not a function of misfolding of the sFv moiety or of a reduced ability to bind TfnR. In contrast to DTM1-E6 sFv, a fusion protein between a second DT mutant, CRM 107 [S(525)F], and the E6 sFv was specifically cytotoxic (IC50 1 x 10(-9) M), and toxicity could be blocked by addition of excess E6 antibody. The cell-free in vitro expression system we describe is rapid and may be used to express functional toxin-sFv fusion proteins. No protein refolding procedures are required, and the technique may be used to express proteins which, due to restrictions imposed on manipulation of toxin-encoding genes in Escherichia coli, could not be produced by more conventional methods."
https://openalex.org/W1497684803,"Abstract Acrosomal exocytosis is initiated in mammalian sperm by stimulatory agonists in the zona pellucida. Recently, it was shown that exocytosis is modulated in bovine sperm by extrinsic factors present in seminal fluids (Florman, H.M., and First, N.L. (1988) Dev. Biol. 128, 464-474). Fractionation of bovine seminal fluids yields a M(r) approximately 6,500, basic (pI approximately 8.5) peptide that accounts for the positive modulation of zona pellucida-induced acrosome reaction (ED50 and maximal response at 0.2 and 1 micrograms/ml, respectively). In addition, application of purified peptide to fura 2-loaded, cauda epididymal sperm supported zona pellucida-promoted elevations of Ca2+i equivalent to those observed with sperm treated with unfractionated seminal fluids in vitro or in vivo. Finally, peptide treatment regulated gamete interaction in a manner consistent with the distinct behaviors of cauda epididymal and ejaculated bovine sperm. This purified seminal peptide was identified by sequence analysis as caltrin, a previously characterized regulator of Ca2+ transport in bovine sperm. We therefore propose that caltrin is a regulator of sperm signal transduction pathways activated by zona pellucida binding."
https://openalex.org/W1581086607,"We isolated several overlapping cDNAs from Strongylocentrotus purpuratus coding for a nonfibrillar collagen chain structurally homologous to the vertebrate type IV collagen chains and arbitrarily termed 3 alpha chain. The deduced amino acid sequence of the sea urchin polypeptide includes a 28-residue signal peptide, a 14-residue amino-terminal non-collagenous segment, a triple-helical domain of 1390 residues containing 23 imperfections, and a 226-residue carboxyl-terminal non-collagenous region. Comparison of the sea urchin amino- and carboxyl-terminal non-collagenous domains with those of the vertebrate type IV collagen chains indicated a high level of sequence identity to the alpha 1 (IV) and alpha 5 (IV) chains. This evolutionary relationship was further strengthened by the analysis of the genomic organization of the 5' portion of the sea urchin gene, which also provided the composition of some of the upstream sequences. In addition, this work demonstrated that our gene product is identical to that encoded by the partial cDNA clone recently isolated by others (Wessel, G. M., Etkin, M., and Benson, S. (1991) Dev.

We analyzed the effects of hemin or TPA induction on the binding and activity of transcription factors at a regulatory element found within the transcriptional regulatory sequences of many erythroid-specific genes. TPA induction increases the binding of ubiquitous AP-1 factors to this element. TPA induction inhibits the binding of the lineage limited transcription factor NF-E2 to this transcriptional control element. Hemin induction of K562 cells does not facilitate the binding of NF-E2 to its recognition site. Hemin induction appears to nonspecifically increase the expression of transiently transfected genes in K562 cells. Beyond this nonspecific increase in gene expression, hemin induction acts to increase the activity of the lineage limited transcription factor NF-E2. The divergent effects of hemin and TPA on gene expression in K562 cells are mediated, in part, by their contrasting effects on the transcription factor NF-E2."
https://openalex.org/W1510989649,"We report here the pre-mRNA splicing of the human glycophorin Mz (HGpMz) gene altered by a defective donor splice site introduced into the third intron via the mechanism of gene conversion. We found that the directional transfer from HGpB(delta) to HGpA(alpha) of a 145-base pair silent homologous segment had resulted in HGpMz as an alpha-beta-alpha hybrid gene with a G-T transversion in the consensus GT motif of the 5'-donor splice site. Transcript analysis showed the presence in the Mz reticulocytes of three major glycophorin cDNA species of which two occurred as the shortened and aberrantly spliced products of HGpMz pre-mRNA lacking the sequences encoded by one and two exons, respectively. The skipping of exon III results in one HGpMz protein with 99 amino acids that bears the M and Sta blood group antigens, whereas the coincident skipping of both exon III and exon IV leads to the expression of a minor HGpMz protein with 86 amino acids. These results indicate that the translocated defective donor splice site not only causes uniform skipping of the upstream exon but also affects the processing of the downstream exon. Complementing our previous studies, the finding that the active and inactive splice sites can be transposed by DNA recombination and alternatively used to construct new glycophorin alleles reveals a novel mechanism for sequence diversification in human genes."
https://openalex.org/W1555678973,"Abstract ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) are a family of approximately 20-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that stimulate the ADP-ribosyltransferase activities of cholera toxin in vitro and function in protein trafficking in vivo. The six cloned mammalian ARFs can be grouped into three classes based on size and sequence identity. ARF 2 is a class I ARF, whose approximately 2.6-kilobase mRNA exhibits species and tissue selective expression and is developmentally regulated in rat brain. Here we report the sequence, structure, and functional promoter region of the bovine ARF 2 gene, which was facilitated by constructing a composite cDNA. The ARF 2 cDNA, constructed from a partial cDNA clone and polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragments from reverse-transcribed poly(A)+ RNA, was approximately 2270 base pairs (bp) (minus the poly(A) tail). In the 3'-untranslated region, there are two potential polyadenylation signals, ATTAAA and AATAAA, at positions 1064 and 2232, respectively, and two ATTTA motifs, believed to signal mRNA degradation, at positions 2115 and 2165. The ARF 2 gene, represented in three overlapping genomic clones, spans approximately 20 kilobase pairs with five exons and four introns. Consensus sequences for guanine nucleotide-binding and GTP hydrolysis are in separate exons, except for the NKXD sequence, which is divided by intron 4. There are multiple transcriptional initiation sites. Transient transfection of embryonic trachea cells with deletion constructs defined the functional promoter region to be within 400 bp upstream of the most 5' site of transcription initiation. This 400-bp region lacks a TATA-like sequence but contains six inverted CCAAT boxes, four potential Sp1-binding sites, and a potential AP-2-binding site. Although the pattern of expression of ARF 2 is unique among the ARFs, the structures of the class I ARF genes are conserved among its members and across species."
https://openalex.org/W1605373773,"The Fur protein, which regulates iron uptake in Escherichia coli, also represses the biosynthesis of the manganese-containing superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). A strain of E. coli bearing a lacZ fusion to the aerobactin operon was used to compare the metal specificities of the regulation of MnSOD and of aerobactin by Fur. Iron, but not manganese, acted as a corepressor of the Fur-dependent inhibition of MnSOD biosynthesis. The iron-mediated inhibition of MnSOD biosynthesis was dependent upon an intact fur locus, indicating that the effect of iron is mediated by the fur gene product. The suppression of the accumulation of MnSOD by iron, but not by manganese, was not due to destabilization of the MnSOD polypeptide by iron. Thus this effect of iron was also seen in a sodA::lacZ operon fusion in which the production of beta-galactosidase was regulated by the sodA promoter. In contrast, both iron and manganese served as corepressors of aerobactin biosynthesis. It thus appears that the effectiveness of specific metal cations to act as corepressors with Fur varies with the gene being regulated by the Fur-metal complex."
https://openalex.org/W1558759140,"The Escherichia coli UvrA protein possesses a stretch of amino acids, 494 to 513, that matches the consensus sequence of the helix-turn-helix motif of many sequence-specific DNA binding proteins. It also has two zinc finger motif regions and two ATP binding sites. To study the potential roles of both helix-turn-helix and zinc finger motifs in the functioning of UvrA protein, random mutations were created in these motif regions by degenerate oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. Using this method, 12 single substitution mutants (eight in the helix-turn-helix motif region, one in the N-terminal zinc finger region, and three in the C-terminal zinc finger region) were isolated that failed to confer UV resistance in the E. coli strain deleted of the uvrA gene. One hyper UV-resistant mutant, G275A, was identified that conferred significantly more UV resistance than the wild type in the MH1-delta A strain. To further investigate the mechanism of failure of these mutant UvrA proteins to support nucleotide excision repair, two mutant UvrA proteins, G502D and V508D, were selected for purification and characterization, since they carry mutations at the positions offered as the putative constellation for the helix-turn-helix motif. The binding affinity of these two mutants for nonirradiated plasmid DNA was unaffected by the mutations. Both mutant proteins exhibited substantial ATPase activity, and together with the UvrB protein, they were capable of generating positively supercoiled plasmid DNA from the relaxed form in the presence of ATP and bacterial topoisomerase I. However, both mutant proteins failed to respond to UV damage in the filter binding assay and were incapable of forming 2 x SSC-resistant nucleoprotein complexes with UvrB protein on UV-irradiated plasmid DNA. Taking these properties together, it appears that the mutations in the helix-turn-helix motif region impaired the UvrA protein's ability to recognize UV damage, while its other activities were largely unaffected. Interestingly, ERCC-3, a human DNA repair protein, also has a similar helix-turn-helix motif. Given the highly conserved nature of repair proteins in general, this observation raises the possibility that both procaryotes and eucaryotes might use similar mechanisms to recognize damaged sites in their genomes."
https://openalex.org/W1521441128,"We have taken a combined genetic and biochemical approach to study TATA-binding protein (TBP) structure-function relationships. Using site-directed mutagenesis coupled with a screen for conditional lethal growth, we have isolated a number of temperature-sensitive TBP alleles in the region of amino acid positions 188, 189, and 190. Conditional growth is not a result of increased TBP turnover as most of the mutant proteins are stable in vivo as evidenced by immunoblot detection of TBP steady-state levels. DNA binding assays reveal that mutations at position 188 do not affect DNA binding activity of these mutants, even at high temperatures. Utilizing whole cell extracts which contain mutant TBPs in in vitro transcription experiments, we confirm that TBP is required for transcription by all three nuclear polymerases. However, certain of our TBP mutants are only compromised for RNA polymerase II transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1604714563,"A novel form of type C atrial natriuretic peptide receptor (ANP-C) was identified, characterized, and shown to be a product of alternative RNA splicing. Sequencing of several clones of ANP-C cDNA isolated from a bovine lung cDNA library revealed the presence of a new clone encoding a 536-amino acid ANP-C. The nucleotide sequence of this novel clone is very similar to that of the previously cloned ANP-C which consists of 537 amino acids. The sole difference between the two clones is the presence or absence of a very short segment of only 3 base pairs (bp), by which the sequence Ser472-Gly473 of the longer form is changed to Cys472 in the variant form; the other regions are identical. Alignment of the cDNA sequences with that of the ANP-C gene indicated that the two forms of ANP-C receptor arise from a single gene by alternative splicing using one donor and two closely located acceptor sites. Biochemical and pharmacological characterization using a mammalian cDNA expression system indicated that the two variants are similar in their subunit structures, in ligand-binding properties, and even in internalization kinetics. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of the transcripts demonstrated that 1) although the novel form is a minor species, it is present in various tissues such as the lung, kidney, adrenal, and vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells and 2) the ratio of the novel variant form to the original longer form remains almost constant in these tissues. The alternative splicing reported here contributes to the diversity of ANP receptors; however, its physiological significance remains to be clarified."
https://openalex.org/W1603105493,"Highly purified endoplasmic reticulum fractions from rat liver and dog pancreas harbor membrane-associated kinases that phosphorylate integral membrane proteins of 90, 56, 35, and 15 kDa with [gamma-32P]GTP and of 90, 56, and 35 kDa with [gamma-32P]ATP. Of these, only the 35-kDa phosphoprotein was N-glycosylated. Screening of Golgi fractions, endosomes, plasma membranes, lysosomes, and mitochondria revealed phosphoproteins unique to each organelle. In particular, endosomes were found to harbor a 48-kDa extrinsic membrane protein and two or more integral membrane phosphoproteins of 30-35 kDa. None of these were N-glycosylated as judged by their insensitivity to digestion by N-glycosidase F and a lack of binding to concanavalin A or wheat germ agglutinin. Since the 30-35 kDa membrane phosphoproteins present in Golgi-free endosomal fractions were not detected in endosome-free, highly purified Golgi fractions and were found exclusively in horseradish peroxidase-containing endosomes as determined by the diaminobenzidine shift protocol, then these membrane phosphoproteins are unique to endosomes. Since membrane phosphoproteins unique to the endoplasmic reticulum have been shown to have important functional significance in calcium binding and as a membrane chaperone(s) (Wada, I., Rindress, D., Cameron, P.H., Ou, W.-J., Doherty, J.-J., II, Louvard, D., Bell, A.W., Dignard, D., Thomas, D.Y., and Bergeron, J.J.M.

Heparin binding EGF-like growth factor is a potent mitogen for smooth muscle cells capable of binding to both the EGF receptor and to immobilized heparin (Higashiyama, S., Abraham, J., Miller, J., Fiddes, J., and Klagsbrun, M. (1991) Science 251, 936-938). To study the effect of the heparin-binding domain in a chimeric toxin targeted to the EGF receptor, we fused the DNA sequence corresponding to the putative NH2-terminal heparin-binding (HB) domain of HB-EGF to chimeric toxins composed of TGF alpha and two different recombinant forms of Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE). One of these is a truncated form of PE devoid of the binding domain (TGF alpha-PE38); another is a mutant form of full-length toxin containing inactivating mutations in the binding domain and an altered carboxyl terminus (TGF alpha-PE4EKDEL). The resulting chimeric toxins HB-TGF alpha-PE38 and HB-TGF alpha-PE4EKDEL were expressed in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies, refolded, and purified by heparin affinity chromatography. Both of the toxins were eluted from heparin at 0.8 M NaCl, in contrast to their respective TGF alpha toxins which were eluted at 0.15 M. Binding studies on A431 cells showed that the HB-TGF alpha toxins bound to the EGF receptor with an affinity similar to that of the TGF alpha toxins. However, cell killing studies on a panel of malignant cell lines showed that cytotoxicity was strongly affected by the presence of the HB domain. Cell lines expressing high numbers of EGF receptors such as A431 and KB were less sensitive to toxins containing the HB domain. Cells with low number of EGF receptors had similar responses to both types of toxins (MCF-7 and LNCaP) or were more sensitive to the toxin with the added HB domain (HEP-G2). HB-TGF alpha-PE4EKDEL was over 10-fold more cytotoxic against proliferating vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) than to quiescent VSMC. Moreover, HB-TGF alpha-PE4EKDEL was 6-fold more potent than TGF alpha-PE4EKDEL to proliferating VSMC. Competition studies with EGF and/or heparin showed that heparin blocks the cytotoxicity of HB-TGF toxins and the inhibitory action of heparin is stronger in cells expressing lower number of EGF receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

In view of these observations we examined the effect of various fatty acids on PDGF receptor activity. Unsaturated (oleic, linoleic, linolenic, and arachidonic) but not saturated (stearic and arachidic) fatty acids significantly inhibited the tyrosine kinase activity of the PDGF receptor in intact cells and membrane preparations. Half-maximal inhibition (IC50) was observed between 60 and 100 microM and maximal inhibition between 170 and 200 microM. Lysophospholipids and phospholipids had no effect on receptor activity. Activation of endogenous phospholipase A2 by mellitin in vivo or hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine by purified phospholipase A2 in vitro inhibited PDGF receptor autophosphorylation similar to that of purified fatty acids. Dimerization of PDGF receptors in vivo was significantly reduced by concentrations of arachidonic acid inhibitory for receptor kinase activity while the binding of PDGF was only marginally affected. These data suggest a possible feedback mechanism resulting in the reduction of PDGF receptor activity by unsaturated fatty acids generated downstream within the PDGF-dependent signal transduction pathway and this effect may be as a direct result of decreased receptor dimerization and/or kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1613641720,"A biochemical assay to study the assembly of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in a cell-free system is introduced. Incubation in vitro of ER vesicles containing only immunoglobulin gamma 1 heavy (H) chains with ER vesicles containing only K light (L) chains results in fusion and oligomerization of the H and L chains to form the H2L2 complex (immunoglobulin G). ER fusion/H2L2 oligomerization is time and temperature dependent and requires energy in the form of ATP. It is stimulated by the addition of cytosol and requires protease-sensitive components present on the membranes. The addition of guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) inhibits membrane fusion and subsequent H2L2 oligomerization without affecting the assembly of H2L2 from detergent-solubilized pools, suggesting an important role for GTPases in vesicle recognition or fusion. The development of a rapid and quantitative assay to study the assembly of the ER in a cell-free system will allow us to identify components involved in the recognition, fusion, and post-fusion events critical for ER function in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1804989984,"Isotope exchange kinetics at chemical equilibrium were used to probe the mechanisms of substrate binding and regulatory behavior of homoserine dehydrogenase-I from Escherichia coli. At pH 9.0, 37 degrees C, Keq = 100 (+/- 20) for the catalyzed reaction: L-aspartate-beta-semialdehyde + NADPH + H+ = L-homoserine + NADP+. Saturation curves for the exchange reactions, [14C]L-homoserine L-aspartate-beta-semialdehyde and [3H]NADP+ NADPH were observed as a function of different reactant-product pairs, varied in constant ratio at equilibrium. The NADP+ NADPH exchange rate was inhibited upon variation of pairs involving L-aspartate-beta-semialdehyde and L-homoserine, consistent with preferred order random binding of cofactors before amino acids. Optimal rate constants, derived by simulations of equilibrium isotope exchange kinetics data with the ISOBI program, indicate faster dissociation of amino acids than cofactors from the central complexes but nearly equal rates for association of cofactors and amino acids to free enzyme. Rate limitation of net turnover in both directions is determined by dissociation of cofactor from the E-cofactor complex. The allosteric modifier, L-threonine, produces distinctive perturbations of the saturation curves for isotope exchange, which were analyzed systematically with the ISOBI program. The best fit to the data was obtained by L-threonine inhibiting catalysis between the central complexes without altering substrate association-dissociation rates. Simulations also showed that rate-limiting catalysis suppresses the kinetic inhibition effects that are characteristic of preferred order substrate binding, producing patterns typical for a (rapid equilibrium) random kinetic scheme."
