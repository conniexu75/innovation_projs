https://openalex.org/W2936664461,"The bone marrow microenvironment has a key role in regulating haematopoiesis, but its molecular complexity and response to stress are incompletely understood. Here we map the transcriptional landscape of mouse bone marrow vascular, perivascular and osteoblast cell populations at single-cell resolution, both at homeostasis and under conditions of stress-induced haematopoiesis. This analysis revealed previously unappreciated levels of cellular heterogeneity within the bone marrow niche and resolved cellular sources of pro-haematopoietic growth factors, chemokines and membrane-bound ligands. Our studies demonstrate a considerable transcriptional remodelling of niche elements under stress conditions, including an adipocytic skewing of perivascular cells. Among the stress-induced changes, we observed that vascular Notch delta-like ligands (encoded by Dll1 and Dll4) were downregulated. In the absence of vascular Dll4, haematopoietic stem cells prematurely induced a myeloid transcriptional program. These findings refine our understanding of the cellular architecture of the bone marrow niche, reveal a dynamic and heterogeneous molecular landscape that is highly sensitive to stress and illustrate the utility of single-cell transcriptomic data in evaluating the regulation of haematopoiesis by discrete niche populations."
https://openalex.org/W2937229868,"Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a common syndrome with high morbidity and mortality for which there are no evidence-based therapies. Here we report that concomitant metabolic and hypertensive stress in mice-elicited by a combination of high-fat diet and inhibition of constitutive nitric oxide synthase using Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME)-recapitulates the numerous systemic and cardiovascular features of HFpEF in humans. Expression of one of the unfolded protein response effectors, the spliced form of X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1s), was reduced in the myocardium of our rodent model and in humans with HFpEF. Mechanistically, the decrease in XBP1s resulted from increased activity of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and S-nitrosylation of the endonuclease inositol-requiring protein 1α (IRE1α), culminating in defective XBP1 splicing. Pharmacological or genetic suppression of iNOS, or cardiomyocyte-restricted overexpression of XBP1s, each ameliorated the HFpEF phenotype. We report that iNOS-driven dysregulation of the IRE1α-XBP1 pathway is a crucial mechanism of cardiomyocyte dysfunction in HFpEF."
https://openalex.org/W2936121316,"Osteoclasts are multinucleated giant cells that resorb bone, ensuring development and continuous remodelling of the skeleton and the bone marrow haematopoietic niche. Defective osteoclast activity leads to osteopetrosis and bone marrow failure1-9, whereas excess activity can contribute to bone loss and osteoporosis10. Osteopetrosis can be partially treated by bone marrow transplantation in humans and mice11-18, consistent with a haematopoietic origin of osteoclasts13,16,19 and studies that suggest that they develop by fusion of monocytic precursors derived from haematopoietic stem cells in the presence of CSF1 and RANK ligand1,20. However, the developmental origin and lifespan of osteoclasts, and the mechanisms that ensure maintenance of osteoclast function throughout life in vivo remain largely unexplored. Here we report that osteoclasts that colonize fetal ossification centres originate from embryonic erythro-myeloid progenitors21,22. These erythro-myeloid progenitor-derived osteoclasts are required for normal bone development and tooth eruption. Yet, timely transfusion of haematopoietic-stem-cell-derived monocytic cells in newborn mice is sufficient to rescue bone development in early-onset autosomal recessive osteopetrosis. We also found that the postnatal maintenance of osteoclasts, bone mass and the bone marrow cavity involve iterative fusion of circulating blood monocytic cells with long-lived osteoclast syncytia. As a consequence, parabiosis or transfusion of monocytic cells results in long-term gene transfer in osteoclasts in the absence of haematopoietic-stem-cell chimerism, and can rescue an adult-onset osteopetrotic phenotype caused by cathepsin K deficiency23,24. In sum, our results identify the developmental origin of osteoclasts and a mechanism that controls their maintenance in bones after birth. These data suggest strategies to rescue osteoclast deficiency in osteopetrosis and to modulate osteoclast activity in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2905437169,"Synthetic lethality—an interaction between two genetic events through which the co-occurrence of these two genetic events leads to cell death, but each event alone does not—can be exploited for cancer therapeutics1. DNA repair processes represent attractive synthetic lethal targets, because many cancers exhibit an impairment of a DNA repair pathway, which can lead to dependence on specific repair proteins2. The success of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) inhibitors in cancers with deficiencies in homologous recombination highlights the potential of this approach3. Hypothesizing that other DNA repair defects would give rise to synthetic lethal relationships, we queried dependencies in cancers with microsatellite instability (MSI), which results from deficient DNA mismatch repair. Here we analysed data from large-scale silencing screens using CRISPR–Cas9-mediated knockout and RNA interference, and found that the RecQ DNA helicase WRN was selectively essential in MSI models in vitro and in vivo, yet dispensable in models of cancers that are microsatellite stable. Depletion of WRN induced double-stranded DNA breaks and promoted apoptosis and cell cycle arrest selectively in MSI models. MSI cancer models required the helicase activity of WRN, but not its exonuclease activity. These findings show that WRN is a synthetic lethal vulnerability and promising drug target for MSI cancers. Depletion of the DNA helicase WRN induced double-stranded DNA breaks, and promoted apoptosis and cell cycle arrest selectively in cancers with microsatellite instability, indicating that WRN is a promising drug target for the treatment of these cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2936055520,"Phosphorene is a mono-elemental, two-dimensional (2D) substance with outstanding, highly directional properties and a bandgap that depends on the number of layers of the material1–8. Nanoribbons, meanwhile, combine the flexibility and unidirectional properties of one-dimensional nanomaterials, the high surface area of 2D nanomaterials and the electron-confinement and edge effects of both. The structures of nanoribbons can thus lead to exceptional control over electronic band structure, the emergence of novel phenomena and unique architectures for applications5,6,9–24. Phosphorene’s intrinsically anisotropic structure has motivated numerous theoretical calculations of phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs), predicting extraordinary properties5,6,12–24. So far, however, discrete PNRs have not been produced. Here we present a method for creating quantities of high-quality, individual PNRs by ionic scissoring of macroscopic black phosphorus crystals. This top–down process results in stable liquid dispersions of PNRs with typical widths of 4–50 nm, predominantly single-layer thickness, measured lengths of up to 75 μm and aspect ratios of up to 1,000. The nanoribbons are atomically flat single crystals, aligned exclusively in the zigzag crystallographic orientation. The ribbons have remarkably uniform widths along their entire lengths, and are extremely flexible. These properties—together with the ease of downstream manipulation via liquid-phase methods—should enable the search for predicted exotic states6,12–14,17–19,21, and an array of applications in which PNRs have been predicted to offer transformative advantages. These applications range from thermoelectric devices to high-capacity fast-charging batteries and integrated high-speed electronic circuits6,14–16,20,23,24. Phosphorene nanoribbons are produced in liquids through the intercalation of black phosphorous crystals with lithium ions, enabling the search for predicted exotic states and applications of these nanoribbons."
https://openalex.org/W2937097952,"The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer mediates cell entry and is conformationally dynamic1-8. Imaging by single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) has revealed that, on the surface of intact virions, mature pre-fusion Env transitions from a pre-triggered conformation (state 1) through a default intermediate conformation (state 2) to a conformation in which it is bound to three CD4 receptor molecules (state 3)8-10. It is currently unclear how these states relate to known structures. Breakthroughs in the structural characterization of the HIV-1 Env trimer have previously been achieved by generating soluble and proteolytically cleaved trimers of gp140 Env that are stabilized by a disulfide bond, an isoleucine-to-proline substitution at residue 559 and a truncation at residue 664 (SOSIP.664 trimers)5,11-18. Cryo-electron microscopy studies have been performed with C-terminally truncated Env of the HIV-1JR-FL strain in complex with the antibody PGT15119. Both approaches have revealed similar structures for Env. Although these structures have been presumed to represent the pre-triggered state 1 of HIV-1 Env, this hypothesis has never directly been tested. Here we use smFRET to compare the conformational states of Env trimers used for structural studies with native Env on intact virus. We find that the constructs upon which extant high-resolution structures are based predominantly occupy downstream conformations that represent states 2 and 3. Therefore, the structure of the pre-triggered state-1 conformation of viral Env that has been identified by smFRET and that is preferentially stabilized by many broadly neutralizing antibodies-and thus of interest for the design of immunogens-remains unknown."
https://openalex.org/W2936405717,"The detection of methane on Mars has been interpreted as indicating that geochemical or biotic activities could persist on Mars today1. A number of different measurements of methane show evidence of transient, locally elevated methane concentrations and seasonal variations in background methane concentrations2–5. These measurements, however, are difficult to reconcile with our current understanding of the chemistry and physics of the Martian atmosphere6,7, which—given methane’s lifetime of several centuries—predicts an even, well mixed distribution of methane1,6,8. Here we report highly sensitive measurements of the atmosphere of Mars in an attempt to detect methane, using the ACS and NOMAD instruments onboard the ESA-Roscosmos ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter from April to August 2018. We did not detect any methane over a range of latitudes in both hemispheres, obtaining an upper limit for methane of about 0.05 parts per billion by volume, which is 10 to 100 times lower than previously reported positive detections2,4. We suggest that reconciliation between the present findings and the background methane concentrations found in the Gale crater4 would require an unknown process that can rapidly remove or sequester methane from the lower atmosphere before it spreads globally. Highly sensitive measurements of the atmosphere of Mars with the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter do not detect any methane over a range of latitudes in both hemispheres, in contrast to previous local or remote detections."
https://openalex.org/W2936743581,"Global dust storms on Mars are rare1,2 but can affect the Martian atmosphere for several months. They can cause changes in atmospheric dynamics and inflation of the atmosphere3, primarily owing to solar heating of the dust3. In turn, changes in atmospheric dynamics can affect the distribution of atmospheric water vapour, with potential implications for the atmospheric photochemistry and climate on Mars4. Recent observations of the water vapour abundance in the Martian atmosphere during dust storm conditions revealed a high-altitude increase in atmospheric water vapour that was more pronounced at high northern latitudes5,6, as well as a decrease in the water column at low latitudes7,8. Here we present concurrent, high-resolution measurements of dust, water and semiheavy water (HDO) at the onset of a global dust storm, obtained by the NOMAD and ACS instruments onboard the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter. We report the vertical distribution of the HDO/H2O ratio (D/H) from the planetary boundary layer up to an altitude of 80 kilometres. Our findings suggest that before the onset of the dust storm, HDO abundances were reduced to levels below detectability at altitudes above 40 kilometres. This decrease in HDO coincided with the presence of water-ice clouds. During the storm, an increase in the abundance of H2O and HDO was observed at altitudes between 40 and 80 kilometres. We propose that these increased abundances may be the result of warmer temperatures during the dust storm causing stronger atmospheric circulation and preventing ice cloud formation, which may confine water vapour to lower altitudes through gravitational fall and subsequent sublimation of ice crystals3. The observed changes in H2O and HDO abundance occurred within a few days during the development of the dust storm, suggesting a fast impact of dust storms on the Martian atmosphere. High-resolution measurements of Martian atmospheric dust, water and semiheavy water, obtained by the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter during a global dust storm on Mars, are reported."
https://openalex.org/W2938210236,"Domestication of a transposon (a DNA sequence that can change its position in a genome) to give rise to the RAG1–RAG2 recombinase (RAG) and V(D)J recombination, which produces the diverse repertoire of antibodies and T cell receptors, was a pivotal event in the evolution of the adaptive immune system of jawed vertebrates. The evolutionary adaptations that transformed the ancestral RAG transposase into a RAG recombinase with appropriately regulated DNA cleavage and transposition activities are not understood. Here, beginning with cryo-electron microscopy structures of the amphioxus ProtoRAG transposase (an evolutionary relative of RAG), we identify amino acid residues and domains the acquisition or loss of which underpins the propensity of RAG for coupled cleavage, its preference for asymmetric DNA substrates and its inability to perform transposition in cells. In particular, we identify two adaptations specific to jawed-vertebrates—arginine 848 in RAG1 and an acidic region in RAG2—that together suppress RAG-mediated transposition more than 1,000-fold. Our findings reveal a two-tiered mechanism for the suppression of RAG-mediated transposition, illuminate the evolution of V(D)J recombination and provide insight into the principles that govern the molecular domestication of transposons. Identification of the changes that converted a transposase to a recombinase sheds light on the evolution of the vertebrate adaptive immune system."
https://openalex.org/W2937367883,"Neurite self-recognition and avoidance are fundamental properties of all nervous systems1. These processes facilitate dendritic arborization2,3, prevent formation of autapses4 and allow free interaction among non-self neurons1,2,4,5. Avoidance among self neurites is mediated by stochastic cell-surface expression of combinations of about 60 isoforms of α-, β- and γ-clustered protocadherin that provide mammalian neurons with single-cell identities1,2,4-13. Avoidance is observed between neurons that express identical protocadherin repertoires2,5, and single-isoform differences are sufficient to prevent self-recognition10. Protocadherins form isoform-promiscuous cis dimers and isoform-specific homophilic trans dimers10,14-20. Although these interactions have previously been characterized in isolation15,17-20, structures of full-length protocadherin ectodomains have not been determined, and how these two interfaces engage in self-recognition between neuronal surfaces remains unknown. Here we determine the molecular arrangement of full-length clustered protocadherin ectodomains in single-isoform self-recognition complexes, using X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron tomography. We determine the crystal structure of the clustered protocadherin γB4 ectodomain, which reveals a zipper-like lattice that is formed by alternating cis and trans interactions. Using cryo-electron tomography, we show that clustered protocadherin γB6 ectodomains tethered to liposomes spontaneously assemble into linear arrays at membrane contact sites, in a configuration that is consistent with the assembly observed in the crystal structure. These linear assemblies pack against each other as parallel arrays to form larger two-dimensional structures between membranes. Our results suggest that the formation of ordered linear assemblies by clustered protocadherins represents the initial self-recognition step in neuronal avoidance, and thus provide support for the isoform-mismatch chain-termination model of protocadherin-mediated self-recognition, which depends on these linear chains11."
https://openalex.org/W2890146628,"Quantum mechanics ascribes to the ground state of the electromagnetic radiation zero-point electric field fluctuations that permeate empty space at all frequencies. No energy can be extracted from the ground state of a system and, therefore, these fluctuations cannot be measured directly with an intensity detector. The experimental proof of their existence came thus from more indirect evidence, such as the Lamb shift, the Casimir force between close conductors or spontaneous emission. A direct method to determine the spectral characteristics of vacuum field fluctuations has been missing so far. In this work, we perform a direct measurement of the field correlation on these fluctuations in the terahertz frequency range using electro-optic detection in a non-linear crystal placed in a cryogenic environment. We investigate their temporal and spatial coherence, which, at zero time delay and spatial distance, has a peak value of $6.2\cdot 10^{-2}~V^2/m^2$, corresponding to a fluctuating vacuum field of 0.25 V/m. With this measurement, we determine the spectral composition of the ground state of electromagnetic radiation which lies within the bandwidth of electro-optic detection."
https://openalex.org/W2939014729,"The cell cycle is a tightly regulated process that is controlled by the conserved cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)–cyclin protein complex1. However, control of the G0-to-G1 transition is not completely understood. Here we demonstrate that p38 MAPK gamma (p38γ) acts as a CDK-like kinase and thus cooperates with CDKs, regulating entry into the cell cycle. p38γ shares high sequence homology, inhibition sensitivity and substrate specificity with CDK family members. In mouse hepatocytes, p38γ induces proliferation after partial hepatectomy by promoting the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma tumour suppressor protein at known CDK target residues. Lack of p38γ or treatment with the p38γ inhibitor pirfenidone protects against the chemically induced formation of liver tumours. Furthermore, biopsies of human hepatocellular carcinoma show high expression of p38γ, suggesting that p38γ could be a therapeutic target in the treatment of this disease. The stress-activated kinase p38γ has a role in regulating entry into the cell cycle; in the liver, it can induce cellular proliferation during regeneration and promote the development of hepatocellular carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2939877466,"The NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a multimeric protein complex that mediates maturation of the cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 as well as release of the proinflammatory protein high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and contributes to several inflammatory diseases, including sepsis, gout, and type 2 diabetes. In this context, the well-studied active complement fragment C5a and its receptor C5aR1 or C5aR2 orchestrate the inflammatory responses in many diseases. Although a C5a-C5aR interaction in NLRP3-associated diseases has been suggested, little is known about the details of C5a–C5aR cross-talk with the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages. In this study, using mice and murine macrophages and cytokines, immunoblotting, siRNA, and quantitative real-time PCR assays, we demonstrate that C5aR2 deficiency restricts activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and release of HMGB1 both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we found that C5aR2 promotes NLRP3 activation by amplifying dsRNA-dependent PKR expression, which is an important NLRP3-activating factor. We also observed that elevation of PKR expression because of the C5a–C5aR2 interaction depends on the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase pathway and type I IFN signaling.

Inflammasomes are large multimeric protein complexes composed of a cytosolic sensor (e.g. NLRP3), an adaptor protein (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC)), and an effector, procaspase-1, which play a vital role in host defense against pathogens and inflammation (1Lamkanfi M.

Complement-induced activation of the cardiac NLRP3 inflammasome in sepsis.FASEB J. 2016; 30 (27543123): 3997-400610.1096/fj.201600728RCrossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 15Fattahi F.

Recent studies have indicated that C5a–C5aR1 regulates lipopolysaccharide (LPS)–induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in monocytes (18Haggadone M.D. Grailer J.J. Fattahi F. Zetoune F.S. Ward P.A. Bidirectional crosstalk between C5a receptors and the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages and monocytes.Mediators Inflamm. 2016; 2016 (27382187)1340156Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); therefore, we asked whether C5a–C5aR2 has similar effects on the modulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages and the associated disease models. In this study, we demonstrated that C5aR2 deficiency dampens activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the release of HMGB1 in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, C5aR2 promotes NLRP3 activation by amplifying PKR expression, which is a well-studied NLRP3 activating factor. Moreover, C5a–C5aR2–promoting PKR expression depends on the MEK/ERK pathway and type I IFN signaling. Thus, our study reveals that C5aR2 contributes to NLRP3 inflammasome activation and HMGB1 release in macrophages. To determine the role of C5aR2 in NLRP3 inflammasome activation, LPS-primed mouse peritoneal macrophages from C5aR2+/+ and C5aR2−/− mice were treated with NLRP3 agonists: ATP, nigericin, and MSU. We found that C5aR2 deficiency significantly reduced IL-1β production but not TNFα production (Fig. 1A). In addition, cleavage of caspase-1 and IL-1β was dampened by C5aR2 deficiency, whereas expression of NLRP3 was not affected by C5aR2 (Fig. 1B), and NLRP3 is required for IL-1β maturation in this process (Fig. S1, A–D). Previous research has suggested that C5aR2 is required for the release of HMGB1 (13Rittirsch D. Flierl M.A. Nadeau B.A. Day D.E. Huber-Lang M. Mackay C.R. Zetoune F.S. Gerard N.P. Cianflone K. Köhl J. Gerard C. Sarma J.V. Ward P.A. Functional roles for C5a receptors in sepsis.Nat. Med. 2008; 14 (18454156): 551-55710.1038/nm1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). We therefore assessed the abundance and found that NLRP3-induced HMGB1 was also decreased in the absence of C5aR2 (Fig. 1C). Early studies indicated that NLRP3 is critical for IL-1β processing via noncanonical inflammasome activation (8Kayagaki N. Warming S. Lamkanfi M. Vande Walle L. Louie S. Dong J. Newton K. Qu Y. Liu J. Heldens S. Zhang J. Lee W.P. Roose-Girma M. Dixit V.M.

Previous studies (19Xu G.L. Chen J. Yang F. Li G.Q. Zheng L.X. Wu Y.Z. C5a/C5aR pathway is essential for the pathogenesis of murine viral fulminant hepatitis by way of potentiating Fgl2/fibroleukin expression.Hepatology. 2014; 60 (24604562): 114-12410.1002/hep.27114Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20Riedemann N.C.

We applied siRNAs to silence C5aR1 in C5aR2+/+ and C5aR2−/− mouse macrophages, followed by stimulation with NLRP3 agonists. The knockdown efficiency of C5aR1 is more than 70% (Fig. S2, A and B). The results showed that knockdown of C5aR1 in WT cells barely affects NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Further, interference of C5aR1 in C5aR2−/− macrophages (a mimic of a double defect of C5aR1 and C5aR2) had a similar effect on the production of IL-1β compared with C5aR2−/− cells (Fig. S2C). This is in accordance with a previous study in which C5aR1 deficiency had no effect on NLRP3 inflammasome activation (18Haggadone M.D. Grailer J.J. Fattahi F. Zetoune F.S. Ward P.A. Bidirectional crosstalk between C5a receptors and the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages and monocytes.Mediators Inflamm. 2016; 2016 (27382187)1340156Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and also suggests a possible dominant role of C5aR2 rather than C5aR1 in activation of NLRP3. To determine whether C5aR2 specifically regulates the NLRP3 inflammasome, we stimulated LPS-primed macrophages from C5aR2+/+ and C5aR2−/− mice with poly(dA:dT) (an AIM2 inflammasome activator), flagellin (an NLRC4 inflammasome activator), and nigericin. The abundance of IL-1β induced by AIM2 and NLRC4 agonists was slightly decreased by C5aR2 deficiency (Fig. S3A), whereas there was no difference in production of TNFα (Fig. S3B). Additionally, we checked C5aR2’s role in TLR signaling (TLR4 stimulated by LPS, TLR2 stimulated by Pam3CSK4, and TLR3 stimulated by poly(I:C)) and found that TNFα or IL-6 was barely influenced by C5aR2 deficiency (Fig. S3, C and D). Taken together, these data suggested that C5aR2 mainly contributes to activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the release of HMGB1. To further investigate the function of C5aR2 in NLRP3 inflammasome activation in vivo, C5aR2−/− and C5aR2+/+ mice were injected with MSU to induce NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent peritoneal inflammation. The IL-1β level and peritoneal exudate cell numbers in the peritoneal lavage fluids were measured. Compared with C5aR2+/+ mice, C5aR2−/− mice showed an obvious reduction in peritoneal inflammation (Fig. 2, A and B). Additionally, we used a LPS-induced sepsis model to examine the effect of C5aR2. In response to LPS challenge, the serum levels of IL-1β and HMGB1, but not TNFα, were greatly reduced in C5aR2−/− mice compared with C5aR2+/+ mice (Fig. 2C). C5aR2−/− mice also exhibited higher resistance to LPS-induced lethality than C5aR2+/+ mice (Fig. 2D), which was consistent with an earlier report that C5aR2−/− mice have improved survival compared with C5aR2+/+ mice after cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)–induced sepsis (13Rittirsch D. Flierl M.A. Nadeau B.A. Day D.E. Huber-Lang M. Mackay C.R. Zetoune F.S. Gerard N.P. Cianflone K. Köhl J. Gerard C. Sarma J.V. Ward P.A. Functional roles for C5a receptors in sepsis.Nat. Med. 2008; 14 (18454156): 551-55710.1038/nm1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggested that C5aR2 is needed for activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in vitro and in vivo. We and others have suggested that PKR is required for NLRP3 inflammasome activation and HMGB1 release (22Lu B. Nakamura T. Inouye K. Li J. Tang Y. Lundbäck P. Valdes-Ferrer S.I. Olofsson P.S. Kalb T.

Rep. 2016; 6 (27113095)2501310.1038/srep25013Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, we wanted to find out whether PKR is involved in C5aR2-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation and HMGB1 release. Accordingly, we examined the expression and the phosphorylation level of PKR in NLRP3 agonist–treated macrophages from C5aR2−/− and C5aR2+/+ mice. Surprisingly, expression and the level of PKR phosphorylation were diminished in the absence of C5aR2 (Fig. 3, A and B). This gave us a clue to further explore the relationship between C5aR2 and PKR. Then we examined the expression of PKR in macrophages treated with LPS, the C5aR2 natural ligand C5a, or both. We found that C5a alone (1 μg/ml) could promote the expression of PKR as much as LPS (Fig. 3C and D). Although combining with LPS, C5a promoted the expression of PKR and increased the phosphorylation level of PKR in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3C and D). Moreover, LPS or C5a or the both slightly promoted PKR expression in macrophages in the absence of C5aR2. (Fig. 3C and D). Thus, C5aR2 deficiency reduces the expression of PKR as well as phosphorylation of PKR in macrophages upon LPS or C5a stimulation. We tested whether PKR could rescue NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the absence of C5aR2. We electroporated PKR or an empty vector to macrophages from C5aR2+/+ and C5aR2−/− mice and then monitored the expression of IL-1β and HMGB1 after stimulation with NLRP3 agonists. The transfection efficiency was quantified by real-time qPCR (Q-PCR) (Fig. 4A), and the ELISA results showed that PKR transfection could partially rescue IL-1β and HMGB1 release in the absence of C5aR2 (Fig. 4, B and C). These data demonstrate that PKR is pivotal for C5aR2-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation and HMGB1 release. To further verify the significance of PKR in C5a-mediated inflammation in vivo, we injected LPS plus recombinant C5a to PKR+/+ and PKR−/− mice and collected whole blood. In PKR+/+ mice, the levels of serum IL-1β and HMGB1 from the LPS plus C5a–treated group were significantly higher than in the LPS alone–treated group, whereas in PKR−/− mice, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups (Fig. 5, A and B), which further demonstrated that PKR regulates the production of C5a-induced proinflammatory mediators in vivo. These results indicate that the C5a-C5aR2 axis promotes NLRP3 activation and HMGB1 release by amplifying the expression of PKR. To determine the potential signal pathway underlying the C5aR2-mediated promotion of PKR expression, we used only C5a to stimulate the macrophages, as it is the natural ligand for C5aR2 and has a similar promoting effect with LPS. We examined MEK/ERK, mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (p38), and PI3K regulatory subunit 1/Akt, which have been reported to mediate C5a’s function in innate immune cells (18Haggadone M.D. Grailer J.J. Fattahi F. Zetoune F.S. Ward P.A.

After treatment with a MEK1/2 inhibitor (U0126), a p38 inhibitor (SB203580), or a PI3K inhibitor (wortmannin), macrophages were challenged with C5a.

To further validate the above signaling pathways, we synthesized siRNAs targeting MEK1, p38, and PI3K before C5a treatment. Only siMEK1 could reduce the expression of PKR following C5a stimulation (Fig. S5, A–D). Accordingly, MEK/ERK signaling is likely involved in C5aR2-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Type I IFN signaling has been reported to regulate PKR expression (36García M.A. Gil J. Ventoso I. Guerra S. Domingo E. Rivas C. Esteban M. Impact of protein kinase PKR in cell biology: from antiviral to antiproliferative action.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70 (17158706): 1032-106010.1128/MMBR.00027-06Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), so we used type I IFN receptor knockout (IFNαβR−/−) mice to further the investigation, in which type I IFN signaling is blocked. We stimulated macrophages from IFNαβR+/+ and IFNαβR−/− mice with C5a protein. PKR expression was markedly decreased in IFNαβR−/− mice after C5a stimulation compared with IFNαβR+/+ mice (Fig. 6C), suggesting that IFN signaling is involved in C5a-mediated promotion of PKR expression. Moreover, C5a treatment could not increase the production of IL-1β and TNFα in IFNαβR−/− macrophages upon NLRP3 agonist exposure (Fig. 6D). Overall, these data suggest that C5a–C5aR2 promotes PKR expression via MEK/ERK signaling and the type I IFN pathway. The anaphylatoxin C5a is generated upon complement activation and contributes to the development of many NLRP3-associated inflammatory disorders, including sepsis (37Ward P.A.

However, little is known about C5a–C5a receptor cross-talk with the NLRP3 inflammasome in immune cells such as macrophages. In this study, we showed that, in the absence of C5aR2, macrophages produce less IL-1β and HMGB1 upon NLRP3 agonist treatment. Moreover, in the MSU-induced peritonitis model and LPS-induced sepsis model, C5aR2−/− mice exhibited obviously reduced inflammation. To further uncover the mechanism, we surprisingly found that C5aR2 promotes the expression of PKR, an NLRP3 inflammasome activator, which was identified by our previous research (22Lu B. Nakamura T. Inouye K. Li J. Tang Y. Lundbäck P. Valdes-Ferrer S.I. Olofsson P.S. Kalb T. Roth J. Zou Y. Erlandsson-Harris H. Yang H. Ting J.P.

Furthermore, PKR transfection rescued inhibition of IL-1β and HMGB1 secretions in the presence of NLRP3 agonists and C5aR2 deficiency. In addition, PKR-deficient mice show attenuated production of IL-1β and HMGB1 after LPS plus C5a injection intraperitoneally compared with WT mice. Last, we found that C5a elevated PKR expression via MEK/ERK signaling and type I IFN signaling. Thus, our study revealed a previously unknown role of C5aR2 in NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages (Fig. 7). C5a–C5a receptor interaction has attracted much attention in infla"
https://openalex.org/W2937496204,"The use of virtual laboratories is growing as companies and educational institutions try to expand their reach, cut costs, increase student understanding, and provide more accessible hands on training for future scientists. Many new higher education initiatives outsource lab activities so students now perform them online in a virtual environment rather than in a classroom setting, thereby saving time and money while increasing accessibility. In this paper we explored whether the learning and motivational outcomes of interacting with a desktop virtual reality (VR) science lab simulation on the internet at home are equivalent to interacting with the same simulation in class with teacher supervision. A sample of 112 (76 female) university biology students participated in a between-subjects experimental design, in which participants learned at home or in class from the same virtual laboratory simulation on the topic of microbiology. The home and classroom groups did not differ significantly on post-test learning outcome scores, or on self-report measures of intrinsic motivation or self-efficacy. Furthermore, these conclusions remained after accounting for prior knowledge or goal orientation. In conclusion, the results indicate that virtual simulations are learning activities that students can engage in just as effectively outside of the classroom environment."

https://openalex.org/W2939126720,"Adoptive transfer of tumor epitope–reactive T cells has emerged as a promising strategy to control tumor growth. However, chronically-stimulated T cells expanded for adoptive cell transfer are susceptible to cell death in an oxidative tumor microenvironment. Because oxidation of cell-surface thiols also alters protein functionality, we hypothesized that increasing the levels of thioredoxin (Trx), an antioxidant molecule facilitating reduction of proteins through cysteine thiol-disulfide exchange, in T cells will promote their sustained antitumor function. Using pre-melanosome protein (Pmel)–Trx1 transgenic mouse-derived splenic T cells, flow cytometry, and gene expression analysis, we observed here that higher Trx expression inversely correlated with reactive oxygen species and susceptibility to T-cell receptor restimulation or oxidation-mediated cell death. These Trx1-overexpressing T cells exhibited a cluster of differentiation 62Lhi (CD62Lhi) central memory-like phenotype with reduced glucose uptake (2-NBDGlo) and decreased effector function (interferon γlo). Furthermore, culturing tumor-reactive T cells in the presence of recombinant Trx increased the dependence of T cells on mitochondrial metabolism and improved tumor control. We conclude that strategies for increasing the antioxidant capacity of antitumor T cells modulate their immunometabolic phenotype leading to improved immunotherapeutic control of established tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2939014495,"Backgrounds Recent evidence has suggested that in Japan, professionals and managers have a higher risk of poor health than other workers (e.g., clerks and manual laborers), and this effect may be stronger among women than men. Low organizational justice, which is known to be a potential risk factor for poor health among employees, may explain the gender-specific association. Methods We examined the associations between perceived organizational justice and psychological distress and stress-related behaviors (smoking and heavy drinking) in 2,216 female and 7,557 male employees aged 18 to 69 years from the Japanese Study of Health, Occupation, and Psychosocial Factors Related Equity. We measured both procedural and interactional justice, and compared managers and professionals with other employees. Results After adjusting for demographic characteristics and occupational stress, low levels of perceived procedural and interactional justice were found to be associated with a high prevalence of psychological distress for both women and men, regardless of occupational status. Among female managers and professionals, perceived interactional justice (measured as the levels of supports by supervisors, etc.) was significantly associated with smoking, whereas no such association was observed among other workers. When interactional justice was perceived to be low, the prevalence of smoking was 6.5 percentage points higher among managers and professionals than among others. Neither procedural nor interactional justice was associated with risk of heavy drinking. Conclusions Female managers and professionals in a workplace with unsupportive supervisors may be more likely to engage in unhealthy coping behaviors to manage their stress. Creating supportive workplaces may be beneficial in increasing workers’ health, especially for female managers and professionals."
https://openalex.org/W2936166630,"The clinical use of doxorubicin (Doxo), a widely used anticancer chemotherapeutic drug, is limited by dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. We have investigated whether chromogranin A (CgA), a cardioregulatory protein released in the blood by the neuroendocrine system and by the heart itself, may contribute to regulation of the cardiotoxic and antitumor activities of Doxo. The effects of a physiologic dose of full-length recombinant CgA on Doxo-induced cardiotoxicity and antitumor activity were investigated in rats using in vivo and ex vivo models and in murine models of melanoma, fibrosarcoma, lymphoma, and lung cancer, respectively. The effect of Doxo on circulating levels of CgA was also investigated. In vivo and ex vivo mechanistic studies showed that CgA can prevent Doxo-induced heart inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, fibrosis, and ischemic injury. On the other hand, CgA did not impair the anticancer activity of Doxo in all the murine models investigated. Furthermore, we observed that Doxo can reduce the intracardiac expression and release of CgA in the blood (i.e., an important cardioprotective agent). These findings suggest that administration of low-dose CgA to patients with low levels of endogenous CgA might represent a novel approach to prevent Doxo-induced adverse events without impairing antitumor effects.—Rocca, C., Scavello, F., Colombo, B., Gasparri, A.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the sero-prevalence and trend of transfusion-transmissible infections among blood donors. Methods A retrospective study was conducted form July 2014 to June 2018 at Bahir Dar district blood bank. Descriptive statistics was presented using percentages, medians and interquartile ranges. Logistic regression was used to explore risk factors associated with each transfusion transmissible infections. Result From a total of 35,435 blood donors 2130 (6.0%) of them had serological evidence for at least one infection and 50 (0.14%) of them were confirmed as having multiple infections. The overall sero-prevalence of HBV, HCV, HIV and syphilis was 230 (6.0%) with 3.9%, 0.6%, 0.5% and 1.2% respectively. From those who had co-infection majority of them 22 (44.0%) were attributed to HBV-Syphilis co-infection and 1 (2.0%) study participant was co-infected with HBV-HIV- Syphilis infection. There was an increment in the overall prevalence of transfusion-transmissible infection;183 in 2014/2015 to 624 in 2017/2018. The sero-prevalence of HBV show a significant increment tend with respect to year of donation. On the other hand HCV and HIV sero-prevalence show an increasing trend from 2014 and decrease in 2018. The sero-prevalence of syphilis was 67 (1.3%) in 2015 and duplicate in 2016, 138 (1.5) but subsequently decrease to 110 (1.1%) in 2017 and in 2018 it was 114 (1.0%). Conclusion and recommendations His finding showed growing evidence in the burden of transfusion-transmissible infection in blood donors despite which requires advanced and vigilance screening of donated blood prior to transfusion. More over there should be strategies for monitoring the implementation of post donation counseling for recruitment and retention of safe regular donors."

However, inhibition of EZH2 induced lipid accumulation in certain cancer and hepatocyte cell lines. To address this discrepancy, we investigated the role of EZH2 in adipogenic differentiation and lipid metabolism using primary human and mouse preadipocytes and adipose-specific EZH2 knockout (KO) mice. We found that the EZH2-selective inhibitor GSK126 induced lipid accumulation in human adipocytes, without altering adipocyte differentiation marker gene expression. Moreover, adipocyte-specific EZH2 KO mice, generated by crossing EZH2 floxed mice with adiponectin-Cre mice, displayed significantly increased body weight, adipose tissue mass, and adipocyte cell size and reduced very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) levels, as compared with littermate controls. These phenotypic alterations could not be explained by differences in feeding behavior, locomotor activity, metabolic energy expenditure, or adipose lipolysis. In addition, human adipocytes treated with either GSK126 or vehicle exhibited comparable rates of glucose-stimulated triglyceride accumulation and fatty acid uptake. Mechanistically, lipid accumulation induced by GSK126 in adipocytes was lipoprotein-dependent, and EZH2 inhibition or gene deletion promoted lipoprotein-dependent lipid uptake in vitro concomitant with up-regulated apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene expression. Deletion of ApoE blocked the effects of GSK126 to promote lipoprotein-dependent lipid uptake in murine adipocytes.

Adipocyte triglycerides can also be derived from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, including very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicrons.

Among the epigenetic regulators that have been reported to regulate adipogenic differentiation is enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a histone methyltransferase enzyme.

Notably, epigenetic mechanisms that control cell differentiation and lipid metabolism can differ in a species– and cell type–specific manner.

Thus, it is imperative to perform studies in primary human adipocytes and in vivo mouse models to determine the potential impact of EZH2 inhibition on adipose tissue biology. Here, we investigated the role of EZH2 in adipogenic differentiation and lipid metabolism using primary human and mouse preadipocytes and adipocyte-specific EZH2 knockout (KO) mice. We demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 in human adipocytes and adipocyte-specific EZH2 deletion in mice promote adipocyte lipid accumulation. Mechanistically, EZH2 inhibition or gene deletion up-regulates ApoE expression, which in turn promotes lipoprotein-dependent lipid accumulation in adipocytes. These findings suggest a novel role for EZH2 in adipocyte lipid metabolism beyond its reported role as a regulator of adipogenic differentiation. To examine the pattern of EZH2 expression during adipogenic differentiation, we conducted a time course experiment using primary human preadipocytes. EZH2 protein was down-regulated early (∼70% by day 3) during differentiation of primary human subcutaneous (SQ; Fig. 1, A and B) and visceral (Fig. S1) preadipocytes. Likewise, mature adipocytes (MA) isolated from murine adipose tissues expressed significantly less EZH2 and RbAP48 (another core component of the PRC2 complex) proteins and a higher level of PPARγ (adipogenic marker) protein, compared with stromal vascular (SV) cells (Fig. 1, C and D). These findings suggest that adipogenic differentiation is associated with down-regulated expression of EZH2 and other PRC2 core proteins. EZH2 inhibition was reported to hinder differentiation of murine and human preadipocytes into mature, lipid-laden adipocytes (5Wang L. Jin Q. Lee J.E. Su I.H. Ge K. Histone H3K27 methyltransferase Ezh2 represses Wnt genes to facilitate adipogenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Conversely, treatment with the EZH2 inhibitor, DZNEP, was reported to enhance lipid droplet accumulation in breast cancer cells (15Hayden A. Johnson P.W. Packham G. Crabb S.J. S-Adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase inhibition by 3-deazaneplanocin A analogues induces anti-cancer effects in breast cancer cell lines and synergy with both histone deacetylase and HER2 inhibition.Breast Cancer Res.

To dissect the role of EZH2 in regulating adipogenic differentiation and lipid accumulation, human preadipocytes were treated with a highly selective EZH2 pharmacological inhibitor (GSK126, a SAM-competitive EZH2 inhibitor), and adipogenic differentiation was induced. GSK126 is known to inhibit the catalytic site of EZH2 (16Kim W. Bird G.H. Neff T. Guo G. Kerenyi M.A. Walensky L.D. Orkin S.H. Targeted disruption of the EZH2-EED complex inhibits EZH2-dependent cancer.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2013; 9 (23974116): 643-65010.1038/nchembio.1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), exhibiting over 1000-fold selectivity for EZH2 versus 20 other human methyltransferases (17Tan J.Z. Yan Y. Wang X.X. Jiang Y. Xu H.E. EZH2: biology, disease, and structure-based drug discovery.Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 2014; 35 (24362326): 161-17410.1038/aps.2013.161Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The efficacy and selectivity of GSK126 were validated by a marked reduction in H3K27me3 levels (Fig. 2A) without significant alterations in H3K4me3 (Fig. 2B) or total protein (Fig. 2C) levels, respectively. Interestingly, human preadipocytes treated with GSK126 during in vitro differentiation exhibited increased lipid accumulation, as demonstrated by Oil Red O (ORO) staining (Fig. 2D) and intracellular triglyceride (Fig. 2E) and cholesterol contents (Fig. S6A), respectively. Expression of key adipocyte differentiation marker (adiponectin and PPARγ) mRNA (Fig. 2F) and protein (Fig. 2, G and H) was not significantly affected by GSK126 treatment as compared with vehicle-treated cells. These data suggest that inhibition of EZH2 can promote lipid accumulation independent of regulating differentiation in primary human preadipocytes. To investigate the role of EZH2 in regulating adipocyte function in vivo, we generated adipocyte-specific EZH2 KO mice in which the adiponectin (Adipoq) promoter/regulatory regions drive Cre recombinase, the enzyme responsible for ablating the Ezh2 gene. Because Adipoq is mainly expressed in mature adipocytes, this model thereby permits tissue-specific EZH2 deletion. The presence of WT/flox EZH2 allele and/or Adipoq-Cre allele in mice was validated via PCR-based genotyping (Fig. S1A). Gene expression data from Adipoq-Cre+/EZH2f/f mice confirmed that EZH2 mRNA levels were selectively reduced in mature adipocytes and whole adipose tissues, without significant alterations in adipose-derived SV cells (progenitor-enriched) and most other nonadipose tissues (Fig. S2B). As expected, compared with littermate controls (EZH2f/f mice), Adipoq-Cre+/EZH2f/f mice displayed a more dramatic reduction of EZH2 mRNA levels in the mature adipocytes compared with the whole adipose tissues (Fig. S2B), suggesting a selective deletion of the EZH2 gene in the mature adipocytes but not in other cell types (i.e. fibroblasts, macrophages, progenitor cells, and endothelial cells) within the adipose depots. Interestingly, kidneys isolated from Adipoq-Cre+/EZH2f/f mice displayed a significant reduction in EZH2 mRNA levels (Fig. S2B), which may be explained by the expression and secretion of adiponectin by renal tubular epithelial cells, in addition to adipocytes (18Perri A. Vizza D. Lofaro D. Gigliotti P. Leone F. Brunelli E. Malivindi R. De Amicis F. Romeo F. De Stefano R. Papalia T. Bonofiglio R. Adiponectin is expressed and secreted by renal tubular epithelial cells.J. Nephrol. 2013; 26 (23553527): 1049-105410.5301/jn.5000269Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Visceral adipose tissue isolated from Adipoq-Cre+/EZH2f/f mice exhibited a significant reduction in H3K27me3 modifications compared with that of control mice, confirming reduced EZH2 functional activity (Fig. S2C). Intriguingly, Adipoq-Cre+/EZH2f/f mice consuming standard chow diet displayed increased body weight (Fig. 3A) and a strong trend toward greater fat mass (Fig. 3B) compared with EZH2f/f controls. Both groups of mice consumed comparable amounts of food, whereas locomotor activity showed a nonsignificant trend toward a reduction in the Adipoq-Cre+/EZH2f/f mice (Fig. 3C). Respiratory exchange ratio, metabolic energy expenditure, CO2 production, O2 consumption, heat generation, water consumption, and glucose and insulin tolerance likewise did not differ significantly between the two groups of mice (Fig. S3, A–H). Assessment of lipid profiles showed that Adipoq-Cre+/EZH2f/f mice displayed lower VLDL-triglyceride (Adipoq-Cre+/EZH2f/f (9 μg) versus EZH2f/f (19.5 μg)), with no difference in VLDL-cholesterol, compared with control mice (Fig. 3, D and E). There was a nonsignificant trend toward reduced total plasma triglyceride (Fig. 3F) in Adipoq-Cre+/EZH2f/f versus EZH2f/f mice, whereas total plasma cholesterol (Fig. 3G) and lipid contents of other plasma lipoprotein species, including intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (IDL/LDL-triglyceride: EZH2f/f (18.5 μg) versus Adipoq-Cre/EZH2f/f (21 μg)), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (Fig. 3, D and E), were similar in the two groups of mice. Tissue mass (Fig. 4A, indexed to body weight) and fat composition (Fig. S3I) of kidney, spleen, liver, heart, lung, and skeletal muscle were unaffected by deletion of EZH2 in adipose tissues. However, SQ fat mass was increased in the Adipoq-Cre+/EZH2f/f mice as compared with EZH2f/f controls (Fig. 4A). There were also nonsignificant trends toward increased visceral and brown adipose tissue masses in the Adipoq-Cre+/EZH2f/f mice. Histological analyses (hematoxylin and eosin staining) of SQ adipose tissues demonstrated increased adipocyte cell size in Adipoq-Cre+/EZH2f/f mice compared with control mice (Fig. 4, B and C). There was also a strong trend toward increased adipocyte cell size in the visceral adipose tissues (Fig. 4E). In contrast, there was no significant difference in adipocyte numbers between either SQ (Fig. 4D) or visceral adipose depots (Fig. 4F) of Adipoq-Cre+/EZH2f/f mice and control mice. Adipose-specific EZH2 deletion did not affect mRNA expression of key adipocyte differentiation markers (adiponectin and PPARγ) in mature adipocytes isolated from the SQ and visceral adipose tissues (Fig. S4A). Moreover, PPARγ and adiponectin protein expression in visceral adipose tissues was not significantly altered by EZH2 deletion in adipocytes (Fig. S4, B and C). These findings suggest that EZH2 deletion in adipocytes in vivo promotes weight gain, adiposity, and adipocyte hypertrophy independent of influencing adipogenic differentiation. Adipocyte lipid content is positively regulated by FA uptake/esterification and DNL and negatively regulated by lipolysis. Our in vitro and in vivo data thus raised the possibility that EZH2 inhibition might directly or indirectly regulate one or more of these metabolic processes to increase lipid content in adipocytes. To investigate whether EZH2 inhibition regulates adipocyte lipolysis, human SQ preadipocytes were treated with either GSK126 (5 μm) or vehicle (DMSO 0.1%), differentiated, and maintained in culture. The mature adipocytes were then treated with or without 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) to stimulate lipolysis. We subsequently measured free glycerol release (index of lipolysis) into the culture medium. GSK126 did not significantly influence basal or IBMX-stimulated glycerol release from in vitro differentiated human adipocytes (Fig. 5A). Intracellular triglyceride content in human adipocytes under basal conditions and following stimulation with IBMX was also unaffected by treatment with GSK126 (Fig. 5B). These findings were further verified in vivo and ex vivo using the Adipoq-Cre+/EZH2f/f mice. Adipoq-Cre+/EZH2f/f mice and control mice injected with 10 mg/kg isoproterenol or saline (control) exhibited no difference in plasma free glycerol levels at 0, 15, and 60 min post-injection (Fig. S5A). Moreover, plasma FA levels were comparable between EZH2f/f mice and Adipoq-Cre+/EZH2f/f mice, further suggesting that EZH2 does not affect lipolysis (Fig. S5B). For ex vivo lipolysis measurement, SQ and visceral fat pads isolated from Adipoq-Cre+/EZH2f/f and control mice were incubated in culture media in the presence or absence of isoproterenol (5 or 10 μm), and free glycerol release (normalized to tissue weights) was subsequently quantified. Similarly, adipose tissue free glycerol release, under basal and stimulated lipolytic conditions, was unaffected by adipocyte-specific EZH2 gene deletion (Fig. S5, D and E). Interestingly, phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase, an enzyme that regulates lipolysis, was increased in adipose tissues of Adipoq-Cre+/EZH2f/f mice as compared with EZH2f/f mice (Fig. S5C), functional consequences of which remain to be determined. Next, we investigated the role of EZH2 in regulating FA uptake. Exogenous FA (oleic acid) conjugated with BSA was added to human adipocytes treated with either GSK126 (5 μm) or vehicle control (DMSO 0.1%) 14–21 days post-adipogenic differentiation. Then extracellular oleic acid concentration in the culture medium was determined over 6 h at different time points. Across all time points, GSK126 treatment did not influence the disappearance of oleic acid from the medium (Fig. 5C), suggesting that FA uptake per se was not affected by EZH2 inhibition. In separate experiments conducted on cells at an earlier state of adipogenic differentiation, we quantified triglyceride levels following incubation with oleic acid. The increase in intracellular triglycerides over baseline (albumin control) in cells incubated with oleic acid was not affected by treatment with GSK126 (Fig. S5, F and G), suggesting that inhibition of EZH2 did not increase adipocyte lipids by augmenting uptake or esterification of exogenous FA. To investigate the role of EZH2 in regulating glucose-stimulated triglyceride accumulation, human preadipocytes treated with either GSK126 or vehicle were differentiated in high-glucose and serum-free (FA-deficient) medium. Under these conditions, GSK126-treated adipocytes displayed slightly reduced ORO staining compared with vehicle-treated adipocytes (Fig. 5D), whereas intracellular triglyceride content was similar in the two groups of cells (Fig. 5E). Moreover, mRNA expression of key DNL gene markers (fatty acid synthase (FASN), acetyl-CoA carboxylase α (ACCa), sterol regulatory element–binding protein 1 (SREBP1), carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (CHREBP1) (also known as MLX-interacting protein-like (MLXIPL), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1)) was unaffected by treatment with GSK126 (Fig. 5F). Although DNL was not directly quantified, these data nevertheless suggest that GSK126 does not promote adipocyte lipid accumulation by increasing glucose-stimulated triglyceride accumulation. Our in vivo data demonstrated that adipocyte-specific EZH2 deletion resulted in reduced plasma VLDL-triglyceride levels (Fig. 3, D and E). Notably, adipocytes can take up lipid from lipoproteins, in particular VLDL, thereby increasing their intracellular lipid content. To test whether EZH2 inhibition could potentially increase adipocyte lipid content by enhancing lipoprotein-dependent lipid uptake, we first performed experiments using lipoprotein-depleted serum. Under these conditions, GSK126 failed to significantly increase adipocyte triglyceride levels, suggesting an obligatory role for lipoproteins in conferring the effects of EZH2 inhibition on lipid accumulation in adipocytes (Fig. 6A). We next examined the role of EZH2 in regulating lipoprotein-dependent lipid uptake in primary human adipocytes. VLDL labeled with 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (Dil) was added to human adipocytes treated with either GSK126 (5 μm) or vehicle control, and intracellular fluorescence was quantified. Interestingly, Dil-VLDL uptake by human adipocytes was increased by EZH2 inhibition (Fig. 6B). To determine whether EZH2 gene deletion would likewise augment lipoprotein-dependent lipid uptake in murine adipocytes, we isolated preadipocytes from the Adipoq-Cre+/EZH2f/f mice and control mice. Following in vitro differentiation, we incubated the cells with Dil-VLDL and quantified fluorescence. As was observed in human adipocytes treated with the EZH2 inhibitor, genetic deletion of EZH2 significantly increased Dil-VLDL uptake by murine adipocytes (Fig. 6C). Adipocyte-expressed ApoE has been reported to play an important role in VLDL uptake in vitro (2Huang Z.H. Minshall R.D. Mazzone T. Mechanism for endogenously expressed Apoe modulation of adipocyte very low density lipoprotein metabolism role in endocytic and lipase-mediated metabolic pathways.J. Biol.

Here, we investigated the dynamic changes of rumen fermentation and bacterial communities following RT and its beneficial effects on rumen epithelial morphology and function in a sheep model of rumen acidosis. The results showed that RT resulted in dynamic changes in rumen fermentation and increased the concentrations of total volatile fatty acid, acetate, propionate, and butyrate, but it decreased the levels of lactate and LPS in the rumen. Illumina MiSeq Sequencing data showed that RT facilitated rapid rebuilt of ruminal bacterial homeostasis (8 d in control vs. 2 d in RT) from a markedly dysbiotic acidosis state to a healthy level (similar with those of donors). At the genus level, RT increased the relative abundance of unclassified Bacteroidales, unclassified Prevotellaceae, unclassified Ruminococcaceae, and Acetitomaculum. Additionally, RT also accelerated recovery of the predicted metagenomic function of ruminal bacteria. Rumen papillae morphology results showed that RT alleviated the damage of rumen epithelia induced by acute rumen acidosis and increased the length of rumen papillae. Furthermore, real-time PCR results showed that RT modulated mRNA expression of genes related to cytokines and tight junctions in the rumen epithelia. In summary, these results reveal that RT accelerates recovery of rumen fermentation and bacterial homeostasis and modulates rumen epithelial morphology and function for sheep suffering from rumen acidosis.—Liu, J., Li, H., Zhu, W., Mao, S.

Loss of function of the nuclear receptor REV-ERB is associated with reduced cognitive function in mouse models. The effect of enhanced REV-ERB activity on cognitive function has not been examined. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that enhanced REV-ERB function may enhance cognitive function in a model of Alzheimer’s disease. We utilized the REV-ERB agonist SR9009 to pharmacologically activate the activity of REV-ERB in the SAMP8 mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. SR9009 reversed cognitive dysfunction of an aged SAMP8 mouse in several behavioral assays including novel object recognition, T-maze foot shock avoidance, and lever press operant conditioning task assessments. SR9009 treatment reduced amyloid-β 1–40 and 1–42 levels in the cortex, which is consistent with improved cognitive function. Furthermore, SR9009 treatment led to increased hippocampal PSD-95, cortical synaptophysin expression and the number of synapses suggesting improvement in synaptic function. We conclude that REV-ERB is a potential target for treatment of Alzheimer’s disease."
https://openalex.org/W2936147874,"The concept of multi-use of the sea has gained popularity in recent years as a result of ocean space (coastal areas and regions with relatively small sea space in particular) becoming increasingly crowded due to the development of the maritime economy. Competing claims for space can be a source of conflict, however this may also lead to mutual benefits for different users when sustainable combinations are sought. Despite increasing European-wide efforts, on-the-ground knowledge and practice of multi-use are still limited. Therefore, with the aim of investigating opportunities for multi-use development in the European seas, 10 case studies were selected, involving different site-specific contexts. This study analyses the characteristics and development potential for ocean multi-use, integrating results from desk analysis and stakeholder perceptions from different sectors in each of the case study locations. Similarities and differences between various combinations of sea uses are also identified. The results show a high heterogeneity of multi-use opportunities between case studies, with a range of combinations identified. The investigated combinations of maritime uses share an overall balance between factors promoting (drivers) and hindering (barriers) multi-use development. Based on stakeholder opinions, expected benefits (added values) of multi-use implementation outweigh potential negative impacts. Management actions are also proposed to further exploit multi-use potential at a local, regional (sub-national) and national levels."

However, the molecular events that occur during heart ischemia, and how these changes prime consequent cell death upon reperfusion, are poorly understood. Protein SUMOylation is a post-translational modification that has been strongly implicated in the protection of cells against a variety of stressors, including ischemia-reperfusion. In particular, the SUMO2/3-specific protease SENP3 has emerged as an important determinant of cell survival after ischemic infarct. Here, we used the Langendorff perfusion model to examine changes in the levels and localisation of SUMOylated target proteins and SENP3 in whole heart. We observed a 50% loss of SENP3 from the cytosolic fraction of hearts after preconditioning, a 90% loss after ischemia and an 80% loss after ischemia-reperfusion. To examine these effects further, we performed ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion experiments in the cardiomyocyte H9C2 cell line. Similar to whole hearts, ischemia induced a decrease in cytosolic SENP3. Furthermore, shRNA-mediated knockdown of SENP3 led to an increase in the rate of cell death upon reperfusion. Together, our results indicate that cardiac ischemia dramatically alter levels of SENP3 and suggest that this may a mechanism to promote cell survival after ischemia-reperfusion in heart."
https://openalex.org/W2938251405,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common cause of disability in ageing societies, with no effective therapies available to date. Two preclinical models are widely used to validate novel OA interventions (MCL-MM and DMM). Our aim is to discern disease dynamics in these models to provide a clear timeline in which various pathological changes occur. OA was surgically induced in mice by destabilisation of the medial meniscus. Analysis of OA progression revealed that the intensity and duration of chondrocyte loss and cartilage lesion formation were significantly different in MCL-MM vs DMM. Firstly, apoptosis was seen prior to week two and was narrowly restricted to the weight bearing area. Four weeks post injury the magnitude of apoptosis led to a 40–60% reduction of chondrocytes in the non-calcified zone. Secondly, the progression of cell loss preceded the structural changes of the cartilage spatio-temporally. Lastly, while proteoglycan loss was similar in both models, collagen type II degradation only occurred more prominently in MCL-MM. Dynamics of chondrocyte loss and lesion formation in preclinical models has important implications for validating new therapeutic strategies. Our work could be helpful in assessing the feasibility and expected response of the DMM- and the MCL-MM models to chondrocyte mediated therapies."

ApoA-I also accepts cholesterol that effluxes from cells expressing ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1). Mice with conditional deletion of ABCA1 and ABCG1 in β cells [β-double knockout (DKO) mice] have increased islet cholesterol levels and reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). The project asks whether metabolic pathways are dysregulated in β-DKO mouse islets and whether this can be corrected, and GSIS improved, by treatment with apoA-I. β-DKO mice were treated with apoA-I or PBS, and islets were isolated for determination of GSIS. Total RNA was extracted from β-DKO and control mouse islets for microarray analysis. Metabolic pathways were interrogated by functional enrichment analysis. ApoA-I treatment improved GSIS in β-DKO but not control mouse islets. Plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels and islet cholesterol levels were also unaffected by treatment with apoA-I. Cholesterol metabolism, glucose metabolism, and inflammation pathways were dysregulated in β-DKO mouse islets. This was not corrected by treatment with apoA-I. In summary, apoA-I treatment improves GSIS by a cholesterol-independent mechanism, but it does not correct metabolic dysregulation in β-DKO mouse islets.-Hou, L., Tang, S., Wu, B.

https://openalex.org/W2940302012,"Human prefrontal cortex (PFC) is associated with broad individual variabilities in functions linked to personality, social behaviors, and cognitive functions. The phenotype variabilities associated with brain functions can be caused by genetic or epigenetic factors. The interactions between these factors in human subjects is, as of yet, poorly understood. The heterogeneity of cerebral tissue, consisting of neuronal and nonneuronal cells, complicates the comparative analysis of gene activities in brain specimens. To approach the underlying neurogenomic determinants, we performed a deep analysis of open chromatin-associated histone methylation in PFC neurons sorted from multiple human individuals in conjunction with whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing. Integrative analyses produced novel unannotated neuronal genes and revealed individual-specific chromatin ""blueprints"" of neurons that, in part, relate to genetic background. Surprisingly, we observed gender-dependent epigenetic signals, implying that gender may contribute to the chromatin variabilities in neurons. Finally, we found epigenetic, allele-specific activation of the testis-specific gene nucleoporin 210 like (NUP210L) in brain in some individuals, which we link to a genetic variant occurring in <3% of the human population. Recently, the NUP210L locus has been associated with intelligence and mathematics ability.

To date, the only substrate described to be involved in this critical reaction is the linear viral DNA produced in reverse transcription. However, during HIV-1 infection, two-long terminal repeat DNA circles (2-LTRcs) are also generated through the ligation of the viral DNA ends by the host cell’s nonhomologous DNA end-joining pathway. These DNAs contain all the genetic information required for viral replication, but their role in HIV-1’s life cycle remains unknown. We previously showed that both linear and circular DNA fragments containing the 2-LTR palindrome junction can be efficiently cleaved in vitro by recombinant integrases, leading to the formation of linear 3′-processed–like DNA. In this report, using in vitro experiments with purified proteins and DNAs along with DNA endonuclease and in vivo integration assays, we show that this circularized genome can also be efficiently used as a substrate in HIV-1 integrase-mediated integration both in vitro and in eukaryotic cells. Notably, we demonstrate that the palindrome cleavage occurs via a two-step mechanism leading to a blunt-ended DNA product, followed by a classical 3′-processing reaction; this cleavage leads to integrase-dependent integration, highlighted by a 5-bp duplication of the host genome.

Consistently, our recent study highlighted that unintegrated viral DNA, more particularly 2-LTRc, could be used as a reserve supply of genomes for proviral integration (15Thierry S. Munir S. Thierry E. Subra F. Leh H. Zamborlini A. Saenz D. Levy D.N. Lesbats P. Saïb A. Parissi V. Poeschla E. Deprez E. Delelis O. Integrase inhibitor reversal dynamics indicate unintegrated HIV-1 DNA initiate de novo integration.Retrovirology. 2015; 12 (25808736): 2410.1186/s12977-015-0153-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the 2-LTRc could serve as functional intermediates in the retrovirus replication cycle, which implies that IN can cleave the palindromic junction of the 2-LTRc, leading to linear DNA that can be subsequently integrated into the target DNA. This hypothesis was addressed in the present work both at the biochemical level and in a eukaryote cellular context. We particularly addressed the question of whether the viral DNA ends formed upon 2-LTR junction cleavage could be compatible with strand-transfer and full-integration reactions and, whether the integration reaction occurs via an IN-dependent mechanism, i.e. leading to the 5-bp duplication of the host genome. Biochemical analyses led us to show that HIV-1 IN catalyzes the formation of integrated products from the LTR-LTR junction oligonucleotides using in vitro concerted integration assay. The physiological relevance of this process was further addressed in the previously established yeast integration eukaryotic model (17Desfarges S. San Filippo J. Fournier M. Calmels C. Caumont-Sarcos A. Litvak S. Sung P. Parissi V. Chromosomal integration of LTR-flanked DNA in yeast expressing HIV-1 integrase: down regulation by RAD51.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34 (17090598): 6215-622410.1093/nar/gkl843Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) as well as in the virological context, showing that IN also catalyzes the integration of a DNA substrate containing the 2-LTRc junction into genomic DNA. Our data highly suggest that 2-LTRc can serve as substrates for HIV-1 IN and, thus, may serve as a new source for the retroviral genome integration. This leads us to reconsider the different ways for the HIV-1 integration and, also, to re-analyze the impact of the 2-LTRc accumulation particularly during anti-IN treatments. An oligonucleotide (ODN) mimicking the palindromic sequence found at the LTR-LTR junction was previously shown to be efficiently cleaved by HIV-1 IN in vitro, leading to the formation of viral ends required for integration (13Delelis O. Parissi V. Leh H. Mbemba G. Petit C. Sonigo P. Deprez E. Mouscadet J.F. Efficient and specific internal cleavage of a retroviral palindromic DNA sequence by tetrameric HIV-1 integrase.PloS One. 2007; 2 (17622353): e60810.1371/journal.pone.0000608Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Moreover, the cellular IN cofactor LEDGF/p75 has been involved in the enhancement of IN activity (18Cherepanov P. Maertens G. Proost P. Devreese B. Van Beeumen J. Engelborghs Y. De Clercq E. Debyser Z. HIV-1 integrase forms stable tetramers and associates with LEDGF/p75 protein in human cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 (12407101): 372-38110.1074/jbc.M209278200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have first analyzed whether LEDGF/p75 could also promote this cleavage. Using the 38-bp DNA mimicking the 2-LTR junction (referred as U5·U3, Fig. 1A, left) in the palindrome cleavage assay, we showed that LEDGF/p75 increased cleavage efficiency mediated by IN by a 3-fold factor (Fig. 1B). The resulting product of IN-mediated cleavage is 5′-TGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCA, indicated as 5′-AGCA on the left of the gel. Then, to better mimic a two-LTR circle, the 2-LTR junction fragment was inserted in a plasmid containing a constitutive yeast TEF1 promoter-dependent Zeocin resistance gene (named U5·U3 circle, Fig. 1A, right) and used as substrate for HIV-1 IN cleavage (Fig. 1C, upper panel). Incubation of the U5·U3 circle substrate with IN led to a protein concentration-dependent linearization of this DNA with an optimal activity reached at 1 μm IN (Fig. 1C, upper panel). In this condition, 50% of the plasmid was linearized (indicated L in Fig. 1C, corresponding to the signal obtained by linearization of U5·U3 circle with SalI (lane 4)). The specificity of the cleavage was assessed using the catalytically inactivated D116A IN as well as the plasmid deleted of the palindromic junction (replaced by a random sequence: random circle, Fig. 1C, right panel). In these conditions, less than 5% of the plasmid DNA was linearized (Fig. 1C, right panel), highlighting a very poor contaminating nonspecific endonuclease activity in IN preparations. Taken together, these data indicate that the linearization of the DNA substrate by the WT IN was due to specific IN catalytical properties and was dependent of the presence of the palindromic junction. Moreover, incubation of U5·U3 circle substrate with IN in the presence of LEDGF showed that this IN cofactor can increase the palindrome cleavage efficiency not only when located on a short DNA sequence as mentioned above, but also of a circular substrate (Fig. 1D, left). The cleavage quality was then checked by sequencing the viral ends resulting from incubation of the U5·U3 circle with IN or IN-LEDGF, as previously described by Munir and colleagues (4Munir S. Thierry S. Subra F. Deprez E. Delelis O. Quantitative analysis of the time-course of viral DNA forms during the HIV-1 life cycle.Retrovirology. 2013; 10 (23938039): 8710.1186/1742-4690-10-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A main proportion of the correct 3′-processed ends (AGCA) was found after the cleavage reaction by HIV-1 IN, as reported in Fig. 1D, right panel. Interestingly, a higher proportion of blunt ends (AGCAGT) was observed in the presence of LEDGF. This confirmed that the retroviral enzyme can generate canonical processed viral ends starting from the LTR-LTR junction, compatible with the strand-transfer reaction, but it also indicates that interaction of IN with LEDGF can generate viral DNA ends compatible with the 3′-processing reaction. To better assess the specificity of the cleavage, we next analyzed the inhibition of the 2-LTR junction cleavage by IN using RAL treatment. Results shown in Fig. 2A revealed that cleavage of the DNA (38 bp) containing the palindromic sequence, in the presence or absence of LEDGF/p75, is inhibited by RAL in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, RAL efficiently inhibited cleavage of the U5·U3 circle in a dose-dependent manner independently of the presence of LEDGF (Fig. 2B). Remarkably, the IC50 found for the inhibition of the palindrome cleavage (500 to 900 nm) is closer to the IC50 found for the inhibition of the 3′-processing reaction (micromolar range) (19Reigadas S. Anies G. Masquelier B. Calmels C. Stuyver L.J. Parissi V. Fleury H. Andreola M.L. The HIV-1 integrase mutations Y143C/R are an alternative pathway for resistance to raltegravir and impact the enzyme functions.PloS One. 2010; 5 (20436677)e1031110.1371/journal.pone.0010311Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) than the IC50 characterizing the strand-transfer reaction (around 5 nm) (19Reigadas S. Anies G. Masquelier B. Calmels C. Stuyver L.J. Parissi V. Fleury H. Andreola M.L. The HIV-1 integrase mutations Y143C/R are an alternative pathway for resistance to raltegravir and impact the enzyme functions.PloS One. 2010; 5 (20436677)e1031110.1371/journal.pone.0010311Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), suggesting that endonucleolytic cleavage of the palindromic junction requires a DNA/IN complex more comparable with the one involved in 3′-processing than to the one involved in the strand-transfer reaction. To determine whether this cleaved 2-LTR DNA can be further involved as an integration substrate, concerted integration assays were performed with the U5·U3 substrate. Integration efficiency was then compared with the one obtained with the DNA (38 bp) mimicking the viral DNA end found in infected cells (U5) (Fig. 3A). Integration products were detected after incubation of the U5·U3 DNA, pBSK acceptor vector, and IN under standard conditions previously established (20Lesbats P. Métifiot M. Calmels C. Baranova S. Nevinsky G. Andreola M.L. Parissi V. In vitro initial attachment of HIV-1 integrase to viral ends: control of the DNA specific interaction by the oligomerization state.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36 (18987001): 7043-705810.1093/nar/gkn796Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The formation of all the expected half-site (HSI) and full-site integration (FSI) products were catalyzed by IN (Fig. 3A). Comparison of the integration profiles obtained with U5·U3 or U5 substrates indicates substantial variation in terms of enzyme concentration optimum. Indeed, the maximum integration efficiency using the U5·U3 or U5 DNA was obtained with 1 μm and 500 nm IN, respectively (Fig. 3A, right). This difference is in accordance with the one previously described in cleavage assays (13Delelis O. Parissi V. Leh H. Mbemba G. Petit C. Sonigo P. Deprez E. Mouscadet J.F. Efficient and specific internal cleavage of a retroviral palindromic DNA sequence by tetrameric HIV-1 integrase.PloS One. 2007; 2 (17622353): e60810.1371/journal.pone.0000608Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and suggests that different IN oligomers or structures are involved in the integration depending on the U5·U3 or U5 substrates. Furthermore, no integration product was obtained using a random DNA (Random), indicating that the integration reaction strictly requires the presence of the viral sequences (Fig. 3A, right). We further analyzed the quality of the integration products obtained, by comparing the integration profiles observed with U5·U3 or U5 DNA using optimal IN concentration for both substrates, i.e. 1 μm and 500 nm, respectively. As reported in Fig. 3B, the proportion of FSI versus HSI products obtained with either the U5·U3 or the U5 DNA was different. Indeed, using the one viral U5 ended DNA led to a major proportion of HSI integration (80% of integration products), whereas only a small proportion of FSI integration was observed (20% of integration products). In contrast, when the U5·U3 was used as substrate for concerted integration, the proportion of FSI was clearly improved (50% of integration products), indicating that the pre-cleavage of the 2-LTR junction by IN could drive the reaction toward a FSI reaction with higher efficiency than when using the U5 end DNA (Fig. 3B, right panel). The reaction specificity was checked using RAL that specifically inhibits the integration reaction (21Hazuda D. Iwamoto M. Wenning L. Emerging pharmacology: inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus integration.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. 2009; 49: 377-39410.1146/annurev.pharmtox.011008.145553Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As reported in Fig. 3C, RAL induced a strong inhibition of the integration in a dose-dependent manner from both U5·U3 and U5 DNA indicating that the reaction was catalyzed by IN with a strand-transfer intermediary mechanism similar to the typical integration of the linear viral sequence ended substrate. Taken together, our data demonstrate that a DNA mimicking the palindrome found at the HIV-1 2-LTR junction can serve as integration substrate in vitro. Previous analyses of the palindrome cleavage by HIV-1 IN led us to demonstrate that the reaction was optimally performed by tetrameric enzyme (13Delelis O. Parissi V. Leh H. Mbemba G. Petit C. Sonigo P. Deprez E. Mouscadet J.F. Efficient and specific internal cleavage of a retroviral palindromic DNA sequence by tetrameric HIV-1 integrase.PloS One. 2007; 2 (17622353): e60810.1371/journal.pone.0000608Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The IN tetramerization on the palindromic junction could improve the further concerted integration step because this oligomeric state has been shown to be involved in this specific activity (22Faure A.

Because the cellular IN cofactor LEDGF/p75 has been previously shown to stabilize IN tetramers (18Cherepanov P. Maertens G. Proost P. Devreese B. Van Beeumen J. Engelborghs Y. De Clercq E. Debyser Z.

As reported in Fig. 3D, LEDGF/p75 stimulates in a dose-dependent manner the integration reaction using the U5·U3 substrate, and more particularly the HSI products as already reported using the U5 substrate (26Maillot B. Lévy N. Eiler S. Crucifix C. Granger F. Richert L. Didier P. Godet J. Pradeau-Aubreton K. Emiliani S. Nazabal A. Lesbats P. Parissi V. Mely Y. Moras D. Schultz P. Ruff M. Structural and functional role of INI1 and LEDGF in the HIV-1 preintegration complex.PloS One. 2013; 8 (23593299)e6073410.1371/journal.pone.0060734Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, this system did not allow the analysis of the structure of the integration products, i.e. viral and genomic DNA sequences found at the integration sites. To better ascertain this point and to address the question of whether integration can take place in an eukaryote cell starting from a 2-LTR junction-containing substrate, we first used the previously characterized yeast integration model (17Desfarges S. San Filippo J. Fournier M. Calmels C. Caumont-Sarcos A. Litvak S. Sung P. Parissi V. Chromosomal integration of LTR-flanked DNA in yeast expressing HIV-1 integrase: down regulation by RAD51.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34 (17090598): 6215-622410.1093/nar/gkl843Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The U5·U3 circle was used as substrate for HIV-1 IN-dependent integration in yeast (Fig. 1A). After transformation of the JSC310 Zeocin-sensitive yeast strains expressing HIV-1 IN with this circular putative integration substrate, Zeocin-resistant clones were selected from 2 to 5 h post-transformation (Fig. 4A). Importantly, the processed product of Fig. 1C, i.e. the product resulting from cleavage of the plasmid with the palindromic sequence by IN (named U5·U3 processed circle, Fig. 1A), was purified and used as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 4A, both U5·U3 circle and U5·U3 processed circle substrates were able to be integrated into yeast genomic DNA after transformation of IN-expressing cells. Moreover, the U5·U3 processed circle showed a higher integration efficiency suggesting that the limiting step of the process was the DNA cleavage. Comparison of integration efficiency was also performed with the linear U5·U3 substrate, the Random circle substrate, and by using the D116A IN expressed in yeast cells (Fig. 4B). Very few clones were selected in the cases of the Random circle and the D116A IN catalytic mutant, highly suggesting that the integration was mediated by the catalytic activity of IN (Fig. 4B). Even if a higher number of zeoR clones was obtained using the classical linear substrate highlighting a better integration efficiency with this DNA, the number of zeoR clones obtained with the palindrome-containing plasmid was significantly higher than in control experiments. To confirm that the zeoR clones selection was actually due to HIV-1 IN-dependent integration events, the selected clones were further analyzed by sequencing. The integrated products were then further analyzed by sequencing the viral extremities fused to the cellular DNA (Fig. 4, C and D), as reported under “Experimental procedures.” Both viral DNA ends and flanking cellular DNA sequences of pseudo-provirus derived from U5·U3 circles and U5·U3 processed circles substrates were compared with the integrants selected using the linear U5·U3 substrate. As reported in Fig. 4C, similar cellular sequences were found using the linear U5·U3 substrate and the U5·U3 processed circles because, in both cases, about 50% of the integrants displayed the typical 5-bp duplication at both plasmid-genomic DNAs junctions. Interestingly, when the U5·U3 circle was used in the yeast integration experiment, we observed a clear improvement of the reaction fidelity because in that case the percentage of accurate 5-bp duplication was increased from 50 to 80–90% (Fig. 4C). Then, the analysis of the viral DNA ends sequences indicated that when the linear U5·U3 substrate was used, a large percentage of integrants displayed the typical AGCA viral extremity, as expected from the correct 3′-processing step (Fig. 4D). Interestingly, all integrated events displaying this sequence (AGCA) are obtained from events highlighting the 5-bp duplication suggesting a better quality of integration using the palindromic substrate. Some defective ends were also selected, but when the U5·U3 circle substrates (processed or not) were assayed, we observed a higher number of defective viral ends structures in addition to the expected correct structure, indicating a defect in terms of fidelity. Interestingly, the profile observed for the viral DNA ends sequences of integrants from the linear U5·U3 substrate was similar to the one found after in vitro cleavage of the U5·U3 DNA substrate by IN alone (Fig. 1B, bottom panel). Moreover, as in the case of in vitro cleavage of U5·U3 DNA substrate by IN/LEDGF, the number of blunt viral DNA ends was increased with the circular U5·U3 substrates (processed or not) (Fig. 4D). To better ascertain whether integration can take place from the 2-LTR junction in the context of viral infection, we introduced in the genomic sequence of a lentiviral vector (pHR′-CMV-GFP) either a 175-bp palindromic sequence mimicking the canonical LTR-LTR junction (PAL+, 5′-CAGTACTG-3′) or a 175-bp sequence for which the central palindrome has been modified (PAL−, 5′-CACATGTG-3′) between the CMV promoter and the cDNA encoding the eGFP.

Xvm is considered a monomorphic bacterium whose intra-pathovar diversity remains poorly understood. With the sudden emergence of Xvm within east and central Africa coupled with the unknown origin of one of the two sublineages suggested for Xvm, attention has shifted to adapting technologies that focus on identifying the origin and distribution of the genetic diversity within this pathogen. Although microbiological and conventional molecular diagnostics have been useful in pathogen identification. Recent advances have ushered in an era of genomic epidemiology that aids in characterizing monomorphic pathogens. To unravel the origin and pathways of the recent emergence of XW in Eastern and Central Africa, there was a need for a genotyping tool adapted for molecular epidemiology. Multi-Locus Variable Number of Tandem Repeat Analysis (MLVA) is able to resolve the evolutionary patterns and invasion routes of a pathogen. In this study, we identified microsatellite loci from nine published Xvm genome sequences. Of the 36 detected microsatellite loci, 21 were selected for primer design and 19 determined to be highly typeable, specific, reproducible and polymorphic with two- to four- alleles per locus on a sub-collection. The 19 markers were multiplexed and applied to genotype 335 Xvm strains isolated from seven countries over several years. The microsatellite markers grouped the Xvm collection into three clusters; with two similar to the SNP-based sublineages 1 and 2 and a new cluster 3, revealing an unknown diversity in Ethiopia. Five of the 19 markers had alleles present in both Xvm and Xanthomonas vasicola pathovars holcicola and vasculorum, supporting the phylogenetic closeliness of these three pathovars. Thank to the public availability of the haplotypes on the MLVABank database, this highly reliable and polymorphic genotyping tool can be further used in a transnational surveillance network to monitor the spread and evolution of XW throughout Africa.. It will inform and guide management of Xvm both in banana-based and enset-based cropping systems. Due to the suitability of MLVA-19 markers for population genetic analyses, this genotyping tool will also be used in future microevolution studies."

The RNA polymerase II CTD coordinates transcription and RNA processing.Genes Dev. 2012; 26 (23028141): 2119-213710.1101/gad.200303.112Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 10Tietjen J.R.

Biol. 2010; 17 (20802488): 1154-116110.1038/nsmb.1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). At the end of transcription, all remaining phosphate groups on the CTD are removed because nonphosphorylated CTD is required for RNA polymerase II to recycle and bind the next promoter (11Cho H. Kim T.K. Mancebo H. Lane W.S. Flores O. Reinberg D.

Other than phosphorylation at Ser2 and Ser5, the other three sites (namely Tyr1, Thr4, and Ser7) are also phosphorylated in vivo (1Eick D. Geyer M. The RNA polymerase II carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) code.Chem. Rev. 2013; 113 (23952966): 8456-849010.1021/cr400071fCrossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Among the three alternative phosphorylation sites, Tyr1 phosphorylation is particularly interesting because Tyr1 is highly conserved in all species, and mutation in this residue leads to defects in RNA polymerase II stability (12Hsin J.-P. Li W. Hoque M. Tian B. Manley J.L. RNAP II CTD tyrosine 1 performs diverse functions in vertebrate cells.Elife. 2014; 3 (24842995)e02112Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), antisense transcription (13Descostes N. Heidemann M.

However, the molecular mechanism of how Tyr1 and its phosphorylation regulate transcription is still unclear. Just as proper placement of phosphorylation marks on the CTD is essential for engaging in transcription, so too is specific and accurately timed removal of CTD phosphorylation marks. For example, deficiency in pSer5 removal causes termination defects leading to transcriptional read-through (16Rosado-Lugo J.D. Hampsey M. The Ssu72 phosphatase mediates the RNA polymerase II initiation-elongation transition.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289 (25339178): 33916-3392610.1074/jbc.M114.608695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Failure in pSer2 dephosphorylation leads to cell death because the promoter binding of RNA polymerase II requires a hypophosphorylated CTD (17Hirose Y. Ohkuma Y. Phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II plays central roles in the integrated events of eucaryotic gene expression.J. Biochem. 2007; 141 (17405796): 601-60810.1093/jb/mvm090Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, it is currently puzzling how CTD phosphatases distinguish the highly similar phosphoryl motifs once they are recruited to RNA polymerase II. It is particularly challenging for dephosphorylating Ser2 and Ser5 when both are phosphorylated during elongation, and their flanking residues are very similar (Y1S2P3 and T4S5P6). Nature accomplishes this goal with precision as observed during transcription elongation and termination when pSer5 levels diminish rapidly but pSer2 levels steadily increase (18Bartkowiak B. Greenleaf A.L. Phosphorylation of RNAPII: to P-TEFb or not to P-TEFb?.Transcription. 2011; 2 (21826281): 115-11910.4161/trns.2.3.15004Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This task is mainly accomplished by Ssu72, a conserved essential CTD phosphatase that dephosphorylates pSer5 at the transition from elongation to termination (19Krishnamurthy S. He X. Reyes-Reyes M. Moore C. Hampsey M. Ssu72 is an RNA polymerase II CTD phosphatase.Mol. Cell. 2004; 14 (15125841): 387-39410.1016/S1097-2765(04)00235-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 20Sun Z.W. Hampsey M.

To understand the molecular mechanism of this high specificity of pSer5 dephosphorylation, we herein investigate the structural characteristics of Ssu72 specificity. Using synthetically phosphorylated CTD peptides and recombinant CTD mutants, we found that Ssu72 has weak phosphatase activity against pSer2 in addition to its previously reported strong activity against pSer5. The unique binding mode of Ssu72 toward its substrate peptides defines the structural basis for the pSer5 preference (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 6NPW), which requires the proline residue in the SP motif in the cis configuration to form a tight β-turn. The bulky side chain of Tyr1 makes it energetically unfavorable for pSer2-Pro3 to adopt this configuration due to steric hindrance. We further reveal the role of Tyr1 in Ssu72’s ability to distinguish pSer5 from pSer2 using CTD substrates with Tyr1 mutated to other residues, which alter Ssu72’s inherent specificity. Additionally, structural analysis reveals that the cis-proline configuration of Ser2 is even more unfavorable when Tyr1 phosphorylation occurs, which may help prevent inappropriate pSer2 dephosphorylation by Ssu72 during the transcription cycle. Our results provide a structural explanation for the accurate removal of CTD phosphate groups and reveal a new role of Tyr1 in preventing inappropriate removal of Ser2 phosphorylation during transcription. As shown from previous kinetic and crystallographic studies from our and other laboratories, Ssu72 predominantly dephosphorylates pSer5 on CTD heptad repeats (21Xiang K. Nagaike T. Xiang S. Kilic T.

However, Ssu72 has also been reported to dephosphorylate pSer7, albeit with much lower activity than that for pSer5 (24Xiang K. Manley J.L. Tong L. An unexpected binding mode for a Pol II CTD peptide phosphorylated at Ser7 in the active site of the CTD phosphatase Ssu72.Genes Dev. 2012; 26 (23070812): 2265-227010.1101/gad.198853.112Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Ssu72 is part of the cleavage and polyadenylation factor complex (25Dichtl B. Blank D. Ohnacker M. Friedlein A. Roeder D. Langen H. Keller W. A role for SSU72 in balancing RNA polymerase II transcription elongation and termination.Mol.

This complex formation enhances Ssu72 phosphatase activity by increasing protein stability in vitro (21Xiang K. Nagaike T. Xiang S. Kilic T. Beh M.M. Manley J.L. Tong L. Crystal structure of the human symplekin-Ssu72-CTD phosphopeptide complex.Nature. 2010; 467 (20861839): 729-73310.1038/nature09391Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We hence used the Ssu72–symplekin complex in our biochemical and structural study. For all experiments below, when we show results of Ssu72 reactions, the material includes symplekin complexed with Ssu72 for better stability in vitro and higher experimental reproducibility. To test whether Ssu72 can dephosphorylate other sites of the CTD in addition to the reported pSer5 and pSer7, we needed a highly sensitive assay to monitor CTD dephosphorylation products even if their abundance is low. Instead of using Malachite green assay, which suffers from a narrow window of detection and a poor signal/background ratio (28Carter S.G. Karl D.W. Inorganic phosphate assay with malachite green: an improvement and evaluation.J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1982; 7 (7153458): 7-1310.1016/0165-022X(82)90031-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), we utilized matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) MS, which can detect low-abundance products in the picomolar range. Using a short 10-mer pSer5 CTD peptide treated with Ssu72 as a proof of concept, we found that adding 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as a matrix allows for effective ionization of both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated CTD species (Fig. 1A). We observed an 80-Da downshift in our MALDI spectra when the phosphoryl peptide was incubated with Ssu72 (Fig. 1A, gold trace), consistent with the removal of a single phosphate group from pSer5. Therefore, our MALDI-based assay is suitable to detect phosphatase activity for Ssu72 against suboptimal substrates. Ssu72 exhibits high structural similarity to low-molecular-weight tyrosine phosphatases and has an almost identical reaction mechanism (23Zhang Y. Zhang M. Zhang Y. Crystal structure of Ssu72, an essential eukaryotic phosphatase specific for the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, in complex with a transition state analogue.Biochem. J. 2011; 434 (21204787): 435-44410.1042/BJ20101471Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To test whether Ssu72 has phosphatase activity against pTyr1 in CTD, we first evaluated phosphatase activity against a 9-mer pTyr1 CTD peptide by MALDI-TOF in which no dephosphorylation was detected (Fig. 1B). To ensure that the lack of activity is not due to the failure of targeting Ssu72 to the substrate, we treated a doubly Tyr1-Ser5 phosphorylated 10-mer peptide with Ssu72 as pSer5 recruits Ssu72 to the substrate (Fig. 1C). We observed one phosphate being rapidly removed in the reaction, which we expect to be the dephosphorylation of pSer5 as shown previously (Fig. 1A), but no further dephosphorylation of the peptide was detected (Fig. 1C). Our results indicate that Ssu72 cannot dephosphorylate pTyr1 of the RNA polymerase II CTD. We next asked whether Ssu72 could dephosphorylate other serine/threonine residues of the CTD. Previously, it was reported that Ssu72 could dephosphorylate pSer7 with activity about 4000 times less than that against pSer5 (24Xiang K. Manley J.L. Tong L. An unexpected binding mode for a Pol II CTD peptide phosphorylated at Ser7 in the active site of the CTD phosphatase Ssu72.Genes Dev. 2012; 26 (23070812): 2265-227010.1101/gad.198853.112Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), but no activity against pThr4 or pSer2 has been reported. To test whether Ssu72 can dephosphorylate pThr4, we used a doubly phosphorylated Thr4-Ser5 CTD peptide as a substrate to ensure the recruitment of the phosphatase. When the peptide was analyzed for its molecular weight by MALDI, only one phosphate was removed even after prolonged incubation (Fig. 1D, gold trace). We have previously shown crystallographically that Ssu72 maintains strong pSer5 specificity even in the context of pThr4, suggesting the removed phosphate is derived from pSer5 and not pThr4 (29Luo Y. Yogesha S.D. Cannon J.R. Yan W. Ellington A.D. Brodbelt J.S. Zhang Y. Novel modifications on C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II can fine-tune the phosphatase activity of Ssu72.ACS Chem. Biol. 2013; 8 (23844594): 2042-205210.1021/cb400229cCrossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, Ssu72 shows no detectable phosphatase activity against pThr4. In contrast, pSer2 can potentially act as a substrate for Ssu72 as it is flanked by a proline to form an SP motif for recognition, similar to pSer5. To determine whether pSer2 is subject to dephosphorylation by Ssu72, we used a 10-mer synthetic peptide containing pSer2 as substrate. Incubation of this peptide with Ssu72 resulted in a peak appearing with 80 Da removed, consistent with at least partial removal of the pSer2 mark from the phosphoryl peptide (Fig. 1E, gold trace). Longer incubation increases the intensity of the peak, but full dephosphorylation is never reached as observed with pSer5 peptide (Fig. 1A). This result is surprising because there have been no previous reports of Ssu72 activity against pSer2. Our sensitive MALDI-TOF data suggest that Ssu72 can dephosphorylate pSer2 in vitro but with less activity compared with pSer5. Although Ssu72 only shows weak phosphatase activity against pSer2 in CTD peptides, we considered the possibility that the dephosphorylation can be substantially more prevalent when full-length CTD is used as a substrate due to the high local concentration of pSer2. To test this, we used full-length yeast CTD (26 repeats with two SP motifs in each repeat, Ser2-Pro3 and Ser5-Pro6; Fig. S1) as the substrate for Ssu72 (Fig. S1). To achieve the saturated phosphorylation at all SP motifs, we incubated CTD with Erk2 under the condition of excess ATP and extended reaction time. The number of phosphates added was quantified using MALDI-TOF (Fig. 2A, blue trace). WT full-length yeast CTD was almost completely phosphorylated on all SP motifs (∼52 phosphorylation sites detected for the 52 SP motifs from 26 CTD repeats) (Fig. 2A, blue trace). Using this fully phosphorylated CTD as a substrate with all Ser2 and Ser5 phosphorylated, we characterized the pattern of dephosphorylation of CTD by Ssu72 using MALDI-TOF, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and immunoblotting assays (Fig. 2, A–C). A time-course EMSA indicated that the Ssu72-mediated CTD dephosphorylation occurs in a two-phase mode, a fast phase is reached within the first ∼10 min and then followed by a slow phase where gradual dephosphorylation is occurring with prolonged incubation (Fig. 2B). A sample taken after 90 min of the reaction was analyzed by MALDI-TOF and contained ∼26 phosphates on the CTD (Fig. 2A, gold trace). To determine the identities of the phosphoryl species, we monitored the dephosphorylation using immunoblotting with phosphoryl-specific antibodies (Fig. 2C). Incubation of fully phosphorylated yeast CTD with Ssu72 shows the rapid loss of pSer5 signal as detected by the pSer5-specific antibody (3E8) over time (Fig. 2C). In contrast, the pSer2 signal during the dephosphorylation increased first because the removal of pSer5 allows better pSer2 antibody (3E10) binding (2Corden J.L. RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain: tethering transcription to transcript and template.Chem. Rev. 2013; 113 (24040939): 8423-845510.1021/cr400158hCrossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The level of pSer2 eventually starts to drop after 5 h of incubation. Overall, when Ssu72 dephosphorylates full-length CTD with both pSer2 and pSer5 present, it dephosphorylates pSer5 rapidly, leaving pSer2 as an intermediate species that undergoes very slow dephosphorylation. To identify the phosphorylation site with single-residue resolution, we intended to use tandem MS. However, the lack of basic residues on CTD prevents the trypsin proteolysis of CTD to smaller fragments for identification. Thus, we investigated whether the same fast–slow two-phase dephosphorylation by Ssu72 can also be observed on shorter recombinant CTDs so that we can map the shorter CTD without the necessity of trypsinolysis. Indeed, when we used Erk2 to phosphorylate a CTD variant with recombinant GST followed by five CTD repeats at the C terminus, a maximum of 10 phosphates were added, accounting for all Ser2 and Ser5 motifs (Fig. 2D, blue trace). The treatment of Ssu72 results in the removal of approximately half of the phosphoryl groups from the serine residues (Fig. 2D, gold trace). Another recombinant CTD was generated with three CTD repeats cloned C-terminal to the GST recombinant protein. The phosphorylation under saturated conditions resulted in the addition of six phosphates (Fig. 2E, blue trace), up to half of which were removed with Ssu72 treatment (Fig. 2E, gold trace). To identify the position of phosphorylation with single-residue resolution, we applied UV photodissociation (UVPD) using 193-nm photons as an alternative to existing collision- and electron-based activation methods for tandem MS analysis (30Mayfield J.E. Robinson M.R. Cotham V.C. Irani S. Matthews W.L. Ram A. Gilmour D.S. Cannon J.R. Zhang Y.J. Brodbelt J.S. Mapping the phosphorylation pattern of Drosophila melanogaster RNA polymerase II carboxyl-terminal domain using ultraviolet photodissociation mass spectrometry.ACS Chem. Biol. 2017; 12 (28103682): 153-16210.1021/acschembio.6b00729Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). UVPD provides several compelling advantages in the context of MS/MS analysis of the CTD (31Brodbelt J.S. Photodissociation mass spectrometry: new tools for characterization of biological molecules.Chem. Soc. Rev. 2014; 43 (24481009): 2757-278310.1039/C3CS60444FCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). First, because the UVPD process is not modulated by mobile protons (like collision-induced dissociation), UVPD generates rich fragmentation patterns for both positively and negatively charged peptides. This makes UVPD especially suitable for highly phosphorylated peptides like those found in the CTD. Second, UVPD is a fast high-energy activation method that does not dislodge labile modifications, making it well-suited for analysis of phosphopeptides (unlike collision-induced dissociation). Both of these advantages make UVPD a natural choice for CTD analysis. Using UVPD-MS on the product of Ssu72 dephosphorylation, we identified that the major species of dephosphorylation are consistent with a mixture of CTD peptides with pSer2 at different heptads (Fig. 2F). Overall, our results on CTD peptides and recombinant CTD proteins support a model in which Ssu72 preferentially dephosphorylates pSer5 rapidly but can also dephosphorylate pSer2 with much lower activity. Because both Ser2 and Ser5 from the CTD have similar flanking residues but their phosphorylation states are linked to different biological functions, we wondered why Ssu72 favors pSer5 over pSer2 as substrate and used crystallography to identify structural elements that distinguish the two SP motifs. We incubated a catalytically inactivated Ssu72 (C13D/D144N) complex with a 19-mer CTD peptide with Ser5 and Ser2 phosphorylated on two separate heptad repeats (Table S1) (Fig. 3A). When both phosphoryl sites are available, the crystal structure reveals high positive density at the active site best fitted with pSer5 bound, whereas pSer2 extends outward into the bulk solvent (Figs. 3, A and B, and S2A). We next crystallized Ssu72 with a CTD peptide containing only pSer2. A much smaller positive density with a tetrahedral shape was observed in the active site, consistent with a phosphate or sulfate group (Fig. 3C). From our previous experience working with Ssu72, such electron density has often been observed in the active site even when no phosphoryl substrate is included in crystallization. The lack of electron density at the active site for the CTD peptide containing pSer2 and the weak kinetic activity of pSer2 peptide both suggest the lack of stronger interaction between the pSer2 peptide and Ssu72. Thus, consistent with the biochemical assays, our crystal structures also indicate that Ssu72 recognizes pSer5 as a substrate much better than pSer2. To understand why Ssu72 strongly prefers Ser5 dephosphorylation even though the flanking residues of Ser2 are quite similar (Y1S2P3 versus T4S5P6), we analyzed all published X-ray crystal structures of Ssu72 bound with various CTD peptides and noticed that all substrates adopt the same configuration of a sharp β-turn (Fig. 3D). In this configuration, the proline residue next to the phosphoryl-serine is recognized by a hydrophobic pocket of Ssu72 in cis-proline configuration, regardless of flanking residue PTM states, peptide length, or the presence of scaffold protein symplekin (Fig. 3D). Although cis-proline only accounts for 10–20% of the overall proline population, the flanking cis-proline to substrate appears to be a prerequisite for Ssu72 recognition as peptidomimetics with a nonrotatable trans-proline cannot be bound to the active site (32Mayfield J.E.

Immunofluorescence localization experiments revealed that Myo/Nog cells of the lens bind antibodies to beaded filament proteins. Co-localization of antibodies to G8, noggin, filensin and CP49 was observed in most RC13 and a subpopulation of RD human rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines. Western blotting with beaded filament antibodies revealed bands of similar molecular weights in RC13 and murine lens cells. Human alveolar, embryonal, pleomorphic and spindle cell rhabdomyosarcomas and Wilms tumors contained a subpopulation of cells immunoreactive for G8, noggin, MyoD and beaded filaments. G8 was also co-localized with filensin mRNA. Staining for beaded filament proteins was not detected in G8 positive cells in leiomyosarcomas, squamous and basal cell carcinomas, syringocarciomas and malignant melanomas. Lens beaded filament proteins were thought to be present only in the lens. Myo/Nog-like cells immunoreactive for beaded filaments may be diagnostic of tumors related to the skeletal muscle lineage."

https://openalex.org/W2939543790,"Background Gene expression may be an important biological mediator in associations between social factors and health. However, previous studies were limited by small sample sizes and use of differing cell types with heterogeneous expression patterns. We use a large population-based cohort with gene expression measured solely in monocytes to investigate associations between seven social factors and expression of genes previously found to be sensitive to social factors. Methods We employ three methodological approaches: 1) omnibus test for the entire gene set (Global ANCOVA), 2) assessment of each association individually (linear regression), and 3) machine learning method that performs variable selection with correlated predictors (elastic net). Results In global analyses, significant associations with the a priori defined socially sensitive gene set were detected for major or lifetime discrimination and chronic burden (p = 0.019 and p = 0.047, respectively). Marginally significant associations were detected for loneliness and adult socioeconomic status (p = 0.066, p = 0.093, respectively). No associations were significant in linear regression analyses after accounting for multiple testing. However, a small percentage of gene expressions (up to 11%) were associated with at least one social factor using elastic net. Conclusion The Global ANCOVA and elastic net findings suggest that a small percentage of genes may be “socially sensitive,” (i.e. demonstrate differential expression by social factor), yet single gene approaches such as linear regression may be ill powered to capture this relationship. Future research should further investigate the biological mechanisms through which social factors act to influence gene expression and how systemic changes in gene expression affect overall health."

We analyzed the association between the ΔNp63 and ΔN/TAp63 mRNA expression ratio and clinicopathological parameters and compared disease-specific survival of each ΔNp63 mRNA expression and ΔN/TAp63 mRNA expression ratio. The ΔN/TAp63 mRNA expression ratio in cervical cancer showed higher sensitivity than the mRNA expression levels of ΔNp63 (52.0% vs 44.2%). The level of ΔN/TAp63 mRNA expression ratio in precancerous LSIL and HSIL was higher than in normal tissues (P = 0.01 and P = 0.003) and lower than in cervical cancer tissues (P = 0.03 and P = 0.02). Besides, the positive ΔN/TAp63 mRNA expression ratio was associated with bulky tumor size and high expression of Ki-67, the proliferation marker, in cervical cancer (P = 0.04 and P = 0.02). The cervical cancer patients with the positive ΔN/TAp63 mRNA expression ratio showed worse survival compared to those who with the negative expression ratio of ΔN/TAp63 (HR = 5.7, 95% CI: 1.6-19.9). In conclusion, the balance of TAp63 and ΔNp63 is closely related to the carcinogenesis of cervical cancer. The ΔN/TAp63 mRNA expression ratio could be useful as a diagnostic and prognostic marker of cervical cancer."

Methods Data from patients with prostate cancer who underwent SRT for biochemical recurrence between 2005 and 2012 in two academic institutions were retrospectively reviewed. Patients treated with WPRT in one hospital were compared with patients treated with PBRT in the other. Propensity scoring was performed to balance the characteristics of the different treatment groups, and bRFS was compared. Results Data from a total of 191 patients were included in the analysis (WPRT, n = 108; PBRT, n = 83). The median follow-up period was 66 months. Prior to matching, patients who received WPRT had higher pathologic Gleason scores as well as a higher incidence of pre-SRT PSA levels >0.5 ng/mL and lower rates of concurrent androgen-deprivation therapy. Propensity score matching balanced these characteristics and generated a cohort comprising 56 patients from each group. In the matched cohort, the 5 year bRFS of the WPRT group was significantly higher than that of the PBRT group (65.9 vs. 42.2%, p = 0.017). Multivariate analysis revealed that WPRT was an independent prognostic factor for bRFS (hazard ratio: 0.45, 95% confidence interval: 0.26–0.75, p = 0.002). This benefit of WPRT on bRFS was maintained in subgroup analyses, especially in patients with preoperative PSA level ≤20 ng/mL or pre-SRT PSA level ≥0.4 ng/mL. Conclusions These data suggest that, following radical prostatectomy, elective WPRT during SRT may improve bRFS compared with PBRT in selected patients. Patients with preoperative PSA level ≤20 ng/mL or pre-SRT PSA level ≥0.4 ng/mL represent a potential subgroup who benefit most from receiving WPRT. Results of prospective randomized trials are awaited to confirm this finding."
https://openalex.org/W2936617491,"Emerging viruses such as severe fever and thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) and Ebola virus (EBOV) are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. Host cell proteases that process the glycoproteins of these viruses are potential targets for antiviral intervention. The aspartyl protease signal peptide peptidase (SPP) has recently been shown to be required for processing of the glycoprotein precursor, Gn/Gc, of Bunyamwera virus and for viral infectivity. Here, we investigated whether SPP is also required for infectivity of particles bearing SFTSV-Gn/Gc. Entry driven by the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) and the Lassa virus glycoprotein (LASV-GPC) depends on the cysteine proteases cathepsin B and L (CatB/CatL) and the serine protease subtilisin/kexin-isozyme 1 (SKI-1), respectively, and was examined in parallel for control purposes. We found that inhibition of SPP and SKI-1 did not interfere with SFTSV Gn + Gc-driven entry but, unexpectedly, blocked entry mediated by EBOV-GP. The inhibition occurred at the stage of proteolytic activation and the SPP inhibitor was found to block CatL/CatB activity. In contrast, the SKI-1 inhibitor did not interfere with CatB/CatL activity but disrupted CatB localization in endo/lysosomes, the site of EBOV-GP processing. These results underline the potential of protease inhibitors for antiviral therapy but also show that previously characterized compounds might exert broader specificity than initially appreciated and might block viral entry via diverse mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2936998057,"The cAMP-dependent protein kinase Pka1 is known as a regulator of glycogenesis, transition into meiosis, chronological aging, and stress responses in the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We demonstrated here that Pka1 is responsible for normal growth in the presence of the microtubule-destabilization drug TBZ and proper chromosome segregation. The deletion of the pka1 gene resulted in the TBZ-sensitive phenotype and chromosome mis-segregation. We isolated the mal3 gene as a multi-copy suppressor of the TBZ-sensitive phenotype in the pka1Δ strains. Overexpression of the CH domain (1-143) or the high-affinity microtubule binding mutant (1-143 Q89R) of Mal3 rescued the TBZ-sensitive phenotype in the pka1Δ and mal3Δ strains, while the EB1 domain (135-308) and the mutants defective in microtubule binding (1-143 Q89E) failed to do so in the same strains. Chromosome mis-segregation caused by TBZ in the pka1Δ or mal3Δ strains was suppressed by the overexpression of the Mal3 CH domain (1-143), Mal3 CH domain with the coiled-coil domain (1-197), or full-length Mal3. Overexpression of EB1 orthologs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Arabidopsis thaliana, Mus musculus, or Homo sapiens suppressed the TBZ-sensitive phenotype in the pka1Δ strains, indicating their conserved functions. These findings suggest that Pka1 and the microtubule binding of the Mal3 CH domain play a role in the maintenance of proper chromosome segregation."
https://openalex.org/W2939996034,"The main purpose of this report is to investigate the structural property and new potential function of PPTI (Pseudocerastes Persicus Trypsin Inhibitor), a kunitz-type protein with inhibitory effect against trypsin proteolytic activity. Besides kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors, PPTI shows clear-cut similarities with dendrotoxins (DTXs), the other kunitz-type protein subfamily. The most important reason is the presence of functionally important residues of DTXs at correspondingly the same positions in PPTI. As such, we proposed the new ability of PPTI for inhibiting voltage-gated potassium channels and consequently its dual functionality. At first, we determined the solution structure of PPTI via Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Then by homology modeling, we constructed the model structure of trypsin-PPTI complex to confirm the same interaction pattern as trypsin-BPTI at complex interface. Finally, by Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations of PPTI NMR derived ensemble structure as ligand against homology model of human Kv1.1 potassium channel as receptor, we evaluated the potential DTX-like activity of PPTI. The results of our study support the proposed dual functionality of PPTI."
https://openalex.org/W2938674052,"Introduction Genetic polymorphisms are important in explaining the wide interpatient variability that exists in the development of acute kidney injury (AKI) post cardiac surgery. We hypothesised that polymorphisms in 4 candidate genes, namely angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), apolipoprotein-E (ApoE), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) are associated with AKI. Methods 870 patients who underwent cardiac surgery in Singapore were analysed. All patients who fulfilled stage 1 KDIGO criteria and above were considered to have AKI. This was investigated against various demographic, clinical and genetic factors. Results Increased age, history of hypertension, anaemia and renal impairment remained important preoperative risk factors for AKI. Intraoperatively, longer cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time and the use of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) were shown to be associated with AKI. Among the genetic factors, ACE-D allele was associated with an increased risk of AKI while IL6-572C allele was associated with a decreased risk of AKI. Conclusion ACE-D allele was associated with the development of AKI similar to other studies. On the other hand, IL6-572C was shown to have a protective role against the development of AKI, contradictory to studies done in the Caucasian population. This contradictory effect of IL6-572C is a result of a complex interplay between the gene and population specific modulating factors. Our findings further underscored the necessity of taking into account population specific differences when developing prediction models for AKI."
https://openalex.org/W2937973288,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a common disease in which pancreatic β cells are impaired due to auto-immunity, pregnancy in women with it is associated with increased risk of neonatal morbidity, mortality. However, the effects of gestational diabetes on the reproduction of newborn offspring are still poorly understood. Here, we determined the cyst breakdown and primordial follicle formation in neonatal offspring born by streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic or non-diabetic female mice, and found that the germ cell cyst breakdown was promoted in neonatal offspring of STZ -induced diabetic mice at postnatal Day 1, which sequentially accelerated the primordial follicle formation. Further investigation revealed that, the expression level of PI3K and p-AKT were significantly increased in ovaries of offspring born by T1D mice. These results indicated that STZ -induced gestational diabetes promotes germ cell cyst breakdown and primordial follicle formation by regulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in the newborn offspring. In addition, this effect can be rescued by an insulin supplement. Taken together, our results uncover the intergenerational effects of gestational diabetes on neonatal offspring folliculogenesis, and provide an experimental model for treating gestational diabetes and its complications in neonatal offspring."
https://openalex.org/W2939187334,"Smoking is a leading cause of preventable death. The effect of tobacco is even more contundent in people with mental illness and, in general, cigarette smoking addiction is influenced by genetic factors. The opioid system is involved in the mesolimbic reward system, which is of great importance in addictive behaviors, such as smoking and is influenced by genes such as the OPRM1. The aim of this study was to evaluate if selecting a comparison group that include light smokers versus people that never smoked impacts the results of genetic association studies. In addition, to evaluate the genetic association in different groups of smokers by analyzing independent covariates such as mental illness and clinical dental data. All subjects were participants of the Dental Registry and DNA Repository project. Genotyping was carried out using TaqMan chemistry for two markers in OPRM1 (rs553202 and rs7755635). Logistic regression analyses were performed as implemented in PLINK. The established value for alpha was 5%, and the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was evaluated by the chi-square test with one degree of freedom for each marker. 1,897 patients were included, which were allocated to eight distinct groups, according to the frequency and quantity of cigarettes smoked and mental illness status. There was no significant association between the two markers in OPRM1 and smoking. When mental illness and dental clinical data (tooth loss, dental caries, and periodontitis) were used as covariates, there were associations between heavy smoking and OPRM1, when non-smokers were used as comparison. We did not have diet or microbiome data to consider for these dental analyses and suggest that these kinds of data should be always incorporated in the future. Significant results were found only when the covariables mental illness and oral clinical data were added to the analysis."
