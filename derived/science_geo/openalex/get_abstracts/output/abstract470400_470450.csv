https://openalex.org/W1965863160,"Large-scale chromosome structure and spatial nuclear arrangement have been linked to control of gene expression and DNA replication and repair. Genomic techniques based on chromosome conformation capture (3C) assess contacts for millions of loci simultaneously, but do so by averaging chromosome conformations from millions of nuclei. Here we introduce single-cell Hi-C, combined with genome-wide statistical analysis and structural modelling of single-copy X chromosomes, to show that individual chromosomes maintain domain organization at the megabase scale, but show variable cell-to-cell chromosome structures at larger scales. Despite this structural stochasticity, localization of active gene domains to boundaries of chromosome territories is a hallmark of chromosomal conformation. Single-cell Hi-C data bridge current gaps between genomics and microscopy studies of chromosomes, demonstrating how modular organization underlies dynamic chromosome structure, and how this structure is probabilistically linked with genome activity patterns."

https://openalex.org/W2020778197,"Species richness has dominated our view of global biodiversity patterns for centuries. The dominance of this paradigm is reflected in the focus by ecologists and conservation managers on richness and associated occurrence-based measures for understanding drivers of broad-scale diversity patterns and as a biological basis for management. However, this is changing rapidly, as it is now recognized that not only the number of species but the species present, their phenotypes and the number of individuals of each species are critical in determining the nature and strength of the relationships between species diversity and a range of ecological functions (such as biomass production and nutrient cycling). Integrating these measures should provide a more relevant representation of global biodiversity patterns in terms of ecological functions than that provided by simple species counts. Here we provide comparisons of a traditional global biodiversity distribution measure based on richness with metrics that incorporate species abundances and functional traits. We use data from standardized quantitative surveys of 2,473 marine reef fish species at 1,844 sites, spanning 133 degrees of latitude from all ocean basins, to identify new diversity hotspots in some temperate regions and the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean. These relate to high diversity of functional traits amongst individuals in the community (calculated using Rao's Q), and differ from previously reported patterns in functional diversity and richness for terrestrial animals, which emphasize species-rich tropical regions only. There is a global trend for greater evenness in the number of individuals of each species, across the reef fish species observed at sites ('community evenness'), at higher latitudes. This contributes to the distribution of functional diversity hotspots and contrasts with well-known latitudinal gradients in richness. Our findings suggest that the contribution of species diversity to a range of ecosystem functions varies over large scales, and imply that in tropical regions, which have higher numbers of species, each species contributes proportionally less to community-level ecological processes on average than species in temperate regions. Metrics of ecological function usefully complement metrics of species diversity in conservation management, including when identifying planning priorities and when tracking changes to biodiversity values."
https://openalex.org/W1990634016,"Bound states of elementary spin waves (magnons) have been predicted to occur in one-dimensional quantum magnets; the observation of two-magnon bound states in a system of ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice is now reported. Two papers published in this issue of Nature show that the propagation of energy quanta in very different physical systems can exhibit the same, unusual dynamics, where bound pairs of quanta become dominant. Ofer Firstenberg et al. realize coherent interactions between individual photons — quanta of light — which are massless and do not usually interact. They achieve this using a quantum nonlinear medium inside which individual photons pair up and travel as massive particles with strong mutual attraction. Potential applications of this technique include all-optical switching, deterministic photonic quantum logic and the generation of strongly correlated states of light. The second paper deals with magnons, the quanta that carry energy in magnets. More than eighty years ago, Hans Bethe predicted the existence of bound states of elementary spin waves (magnons) in one-dimensional quantum magnets. Experimental observation of the phenomenon remained elusive, but now Takeshi Fukuhara et al. have observed two-magnon bound states in a system of ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice. The results provide a new way of studying fundamental properties of quantum magnets. In an accompanying News and Views, Sougato Bose puts these two independent findings into a general context of quantum many-body dynamics. The existence of bound states of elementary spin waves (magnons) in one-dimensional quantum magnets was predicted almost 80 years ago1. Identifying signatures of magnon bound states has so far remained the subject of intense theoretical research2,3,4,5, and their detection has proved challenging for experiments. Ultracold atoms offer an ideal setting in which to find such bound states by tracking the spin dynamics with single-spin and single-site resolution6,7 following a local excitation8. Here we use in situ correlation measurements to observe two-magnon bound states directly in a one-dimensional Heisenberg spin chain comprising ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice. We observe the quantum dynamics of free and bound magnon states through time-resolved measurements of two spin impurities. The increased effective mass of the compound magnon state results in slower spin dynamics as compared to single-magnon excitations. We also determine the decay time of bound magnons, which is probably limited by scattering on thermal fluctuations in the system. Our results provide a new way of studying fundamental properties of quantum magnets and, more generally, properties of interacting impurities in quantum many-body systems."
https://openalex.org/W2068506057,"A neutron star with a low mass companion star was observed at different times as a millisecond pulsar powered either by the rotation of its magnetic field or by the accretion of mass, demonstrating the evolutionary link between these two classes of pulsars, and probing the short timescales on which the transitions between the two states may occur. Alessandro Papitto et al. report the detection of millisecond X-ray pulsations from a neutron star thought to be accreting mass from a low-mass binary companion. The object was previously known as a radio millisecond pulsar, and within a few days of a month-long X-ray outburst, radio pulses were again detected. This demonstrates an evolutionary link between accretion and rotation-powered millisecond pulsars, and shows that some systems can swing between the two states on very short timescales. It is thought that neutron stars in low-mass binary systems can accrete matter and angular momentum from the companion star and be spun-up to millisecond rotational periods1,2,3. During the accretion stage, the system is called a low-mass X-ray binary, and bright X-ray emission is observed. When the rate of mass transfer decreases in the later evolutionary stages, these binaries host a radio millisecond pulsar4,5 whose emission is powered by the neutron star’s rotating magnetic field6. This evolutionary model is supported by the detection of millisecond X-ray pulsations from several accreting neutron stars7,8 and also by the evidence for a past accretion disc in a rotation-powered millisecond pulsar9. It has been proposed that a rotation-powered pulsar may temporarily switch on10,11,12 during periods of low mass inflow13 in some such systems. Only indirect evidence for this transition has hitherto been observed14,15,16,17,18. Here we report observations of accretion-powered, millisecond X-ray pulsations from a neutron star previously seen as a rotation-powered radio pulsar. Within a few days after a month-long X-ray outburst, radio pulses were again detected. This not only shows the evolutionary link between accretion and rotation-powered millisecond pulsars, but also that some systems can swing between the two states on very short timescales."
https://openalex.org/W1981948146,"The fundamental properties of light derive from its constituent particles--massless quanta (photons) that do not interact with one another. However, it has long been known that the realization of coherent interactions between individual photons, akin to those associated with conventional massive particles, could enable a wide variety of novel scientific and engineering applications. Here we demonstrate a quantum nonlinear medium inside which individual photons travel as massive particles with strong mutual attraction, such that the propagation of photon pairs is dominated by a two-photon bound state. We achieve this through dispersive coupling of light to strongly interacting atoms in highly excited Rydberg states. We measure the dynamical evolution of the two-photon wavefunction using time-resolved quantum state tomography, and demonstrate a conditional phase shift exceeding one radian, resulting in polarization-entangled photon pairs. Particular applications of this technique include all-optical switching, deterministic photonic quantum logic and the generation of strongly correlated states of light."

https://openalex.org/W2124033051,"Benzynes are capable of concerted removal of two vicinal hydrogen atoms from a hydrocarbon, a discovery enabled by the thermal generation of reactive benzyne intermediates through the hexadehydro-Diels–Alder cycloisomerization reaction of triyne substrates. This paper reports a new route for the dehydrogenation of an alkane to an alkene — a reaction of long-standing interest to synthetic chemists. The authors show that benzynes are capable of concerted, bimolecular removal of two vicinal hydrogen atoms from a hydrocarbon. The discovery of this chemical transformation was enabled by the thermal generation of reactive benzyne intermediates through the hexadehydro-Diels–Alder cycloisomerization reaction of triyne substrates. This appears to be the first report of a single-step, bimolecular reaction in which two hydrogen atoms are simultaneously transferred from a saturated alkane. The removal of two vicinal hydrogen atoms from an alkane to produce an alkene is a challenge for synthetic chemists1,2. In nature, desaturases and acetylenases are adept at achieving this essential oxidative functionalization reaction, for example during the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids3, eicosanoids, gibberellins4 and carotenoids5. Alkane-to-alkene conversion almost always involves one or more chemical intermediates in a multistep reaction pathway; these may be either isolable species (such as alcohols or alkyl halides) or reactive intermediates (such as carbocations, alkyl radicals, or σ-alkyl-metal species). Here we report a desaturation reaction of simple, unactivated alkanes that is mechanistically unique. We show that benzynes are capable of the concerted removal of two vicinal hydrogen atoms from a hydrocarbon. The discovery of this exothermic, net redox process was enabled by the simple thermal generation of reactive benzyne intermediates through the hexadehydro-Diels–Alder cycloisomerization reaction of triyne substrates6. We are not aware of any single-step, bimolecular reaction in which two hydrogen atoms are simultaneously transferred from a saturated alkane. Computational studies indicate a preferred geometry with eclipsed vicinal C–H bonds in the alkane donor."
https://openalex.org/W2013037632,"Neisseria meningitidis has several strategies to evade complement-mediated killing, and these contribute to its ability to cause septicaemic disease and meningitis. However, the meningococcus is primarily an obligate commensal of the human nasopharynx, and it is unclear why the bacterium has evolved exquisite mechanisms to avoid host immunity. Here we demonstrate that mechanisms of meningococcal immune evasion and resistance against complement increase in response to an increase in ambient temperature. We have identified three independent RNA thermosensors located in the 5' untranslated regions of genes necessary for capsule biosynthesis, the expression of factor H binding protein, and sialylation of lipopolysaccharide, which are essential for meningococcal resistance against immune killing. Therefore increased temperature (which occurs during inflammation) acts as a 'danger signal' for the meningococcus, enhancing its defence against human immune killing. Infection with viral pathogens, such as influenza, leads to inflammation in the nasopharynx with an increased temperature and recruitment of immune effectors. Thermoregulation of immune defence could offer an adaptive advantage to the meningococcus during co-infection with other pathogens, and promote the emergence of virulence in an otherwise commensal bacterium."
https://openalex.org/W2051943484,"Advances in RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA FISH) have allowed practitioners to detect individual RNA molecules in single cells via fluorescence microscopy, enabling highly accurate and sensitive quantification of gene expression. However, current methods typically employ hybridization times on the order of 2–16 hours, limiting its potential in applications like rapid diagnostics. We present here a set of conditions for RNA FISH (dubbed Turbo RNA FISH) that allow us to make accurate measurements with no more than 5 minutes of hybridization time and 3 minutes of washing, and show that hybridization times can go as low as 30 seconds while still producing quantifiable images. We further show that rapid hybridization is compatible with our recently developed iceFISH and SNP FISH variants of RNA FISH that enable chromosome and single base discrimination, respectively. Our method is simple and cost effective, and has the potential to dramatically increase the throughput and realm of applicability of RNA FISH."
https://openalex.org/W1990581210,"The interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins are a family of small membrane proteins that inhibit the cellular entry of several genera of viruses. These proteins had been predicted to adopt a two-pass, type III transmembrane topology with an intracellular loop, two transmembrane helices (TM1 and TM2), and extracellular N and C termini. Recent work, however, supports an intramembrane topology for the helices with cytosolic orientation of both termini. Here we determined the topology of murine Ifitm3. We found that the N terminus of Ifitm3 could be stained by antibodies at the cell surface but that this conformation was cell type-dependent and represented a minority of the total plasma membrane pool. In contrast, the C terminus was readily accessible to antibodies at the cell surface and extracellular C termini comprised most or all of those present at the plasma membrane. The addition of a C-terminal KDEL endoplasmic reticulum retention motif to Ifitm3 resulted in sequestration of Ifitm3 in the ER, demonstrating an ER-luminal orientation of the C terminus. C-terminal, but not N-terminal, epitope tags were also degraded within lysosomes, consistent with their luminal orientation. Furthermore, epitope-tagged Ifitm3 TM2 functioned as a signal anchor sequence when expressed in isolation. Collectively, our results demonstrate a type II transmembrane topology for Ifitm3 and will provide insight into its interaction with potential targets and cofactors."
https://openalex.org/W2071478360,"We identified hotspots of terrestrial vertebrate species diversity in Europe and adjacent islands. Moreover, we assessed the extent to which by the end of the 21(st) century such hotspots will be exposed to average monthly temperature and precipitation patterns which can be regarded as extreme if compared to the climate experienced during 1950-2000. In particular, we considered the entire European sub-continent plus Turkey and a total of 1149 species of terrestrial vertebrates. For each species, we developed species-specific expert-based distribution models (validated against field data) which we used to calculate species richness maps for mammals, breeding birds, amphibians, and reptiles. Considering four global circulation model outputs and three emission scenarios, we generated an index of risk of exposure to extreme climates, and we used a bivariate local Moran's I to identify the areas with a significant association between hotspots of diversity and high risk of exposure to extreme climates. Our results outline that the Mediterranean basin represents both an important hotspot for biodiversity and especially for threatened species for all taxa. In particular, the Iberian and Italian peninsulas host particularly high species richness as measured over all groups, while the eastern Mediterranean basin is particularly rich in amphibians and reptiles; the islands (both Macaronesian and Mediterranean) host the highest richness of threatened species for all taxa occurs. Our results suggest that the main hotspots of biodiversity for terrestrial vertebrates may be extensively influenced by the climate change projected to occur over the coming decades, especially in the Mediterranean bioregion, posing serious concerns for biodiversity conservation."

https://openalex.org/W2089986314,"Background Hypothyroidism has been linked with an increased risk of other morbidities, such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus. However, the temporal relationship between these diseases and the diagnosis of hypothyroidism is not well illuminated. Such information may provide insight into causal relationships between hypothyroidism and other morbidities. Aim To investigate the type and extent of somatic morbidity before and after a diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Methods Observational cohort study. From official Danish health registers, 2822 hypothyroid singletons were identified and matched 1:4 with non-hypothyroid controls and observed over a mean period of 6 years. Frequency of different morbidities was obtained by person-to-person linking in the registers. Logistic and Cox regression models were used to assess the risk of morbidity before and after the diagnosis of hypothyroidism, respectively. Results Prior to the diagnosis of hypothyroidism there was a significantly increased risk of being diagnosed with cardiovascular diseases (odds ratio (OR) 1.37; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.19–1.58), lung diseases (OR 1.25; 95% CI: 1.13–1.39), diabetes mellitus (OR 1.92; 95% CI: 1.61–2.29), as well as malignant diseases (OR 1.24; 95% CI: 1.06–1.45). Following the diagnosis of hypothyroidism there was a significantly increased risk of being diagnosed with cardiovascular diseases (hazard ratio (HR) 1.36; 95% CI: 1.15–1.60); lung diseases (HR 1.51; 95% CI: 1.30–1.75); and diabetes mellitus (HR 1.40; 95% CI: 1.11–1.77). Conclusions Prior to the diagnosis of hypothyroidism there is an excess risk of being diagnosed with cardiovascular diseases, lung diseases, diabetes mellitus, and malignant diseases. Following the diagnosis of hypothyroidism we demonstrate an increased frequency of cardiovascular diseases, lung diseases, and diabetes mellitus."

https://openalex.org/W1994462994,"In this paper, we have examined the effect of ammonium and imidazolium based ionic liquids (ILs) on the stability and activity of proteolytic enzyme α-chymotrypsin (CT) in the presence of cold atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ). The present work aims to illustrate the state of art implementing the combined action of ILs and APPJ on the enzyme stability and activity. Our circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence and enzyme activity results of CT have revealed that buffer and all studied ILs {triethylammonium hydrogen sulphate (TEAS) from ammonium family and 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium chloride ([Bmim][Cl]), 1-methylimidazolium chloride ([Mim][Cl]) from imidazolium family} are notable to act as protective agents against the deleterious action of the APPJ, except triethylammonium dihydrogen phosphate (TEAP) ammonium IL. However, TEAP attenuates strongly the deleterious action of reactive oxygen species (ROS) created by APPJ on native structure of CT. Further, TEAP is able to retain the enzymatic activity after APPJ exposure which is absent in all the other systems.This study provides the first combined effect of APPJ and ILs on biomolecules that may generate many theoretical and experimental opportunities. Through this methodology, we can utilise both enzyme and plasma simultaneously without affecting the enzyme structure and activity on the material surface; which can prove to be applicable in various fields."
https://openalex.org/W2008965035,"Ventral furrow formation in Drosophila is an outstanding model system to study the mechanisms involved in large-scale tissue rearrangements. Ventral cells accumulate myosin at their apical sides and, while being tightly coupled to each other via apical adherens junctions, execute actomyosin contractions that lead to reduction of their apical cell surface. Thereby, a band of constricted cells along the ventral epithelium emerges which will form a tissue indentation along the ventral midline (the ventral furrow). Here we adopt a 2D vertex model to simulate ventral furrow formation in a surface view allowing easy comparison with confocal live-recordings. We show that in order to reproduce furrow morphology seen in vivo, a gradient of contractility must be assumed in the ventral epithelium which renders cells more contractile the closer they lie to the ventral midline. The model predicts previous experimental findings, such as the gain of eccentric morphology of constricting cells and an incremental fashion of apical cell area reduction. Analysis of the model suggests that this incremental area reduction is caused by the dynamical interplay of cell elasticity and stochastic contractility as well as by the opposing forces from contracting neighbour cells. We underpin results from the model through in vivo analysis of ventral furrow formation in wildtype and twi mutant embryos. Our results show that ventral furrow formation can be accomplished as a “tug-of-war” between stochastically contracting, mechanically coupled cells and may require less rigorous regulation than previously thought. Summary For the developmental biologist it is a fascinating question how cells can coordinate major tissue movements during embryonic development. The so-called ventral furrow of the Drosophila embryo is a well-studied example of such a process when cells from a ventral band, spanning nearly the entire length of the embryo, undergo dramatic shape change by contracting their tips and then fold inwards into the interior of the embryo. Although numerous genes have been identified that are critical for ventral furrow formation, it is an open question how cells work together to elicit this tissue rearrangement. We use a computational model to mimic the physical properties of cells in the ventral epithelium and simulate the formation of the furrow. We find that the ventral furrow can form through stochastic self-organisation and that previous experimental observations can be readily explained in our model by considering forces that arise when cells execute contractions while being coupled to each other in a mechanically coherent epithelium. The model highlights the importance of a physical perspective when studying tissue morphogenesis and shows that only a minimal genetic regulation may be required to drive complex processes in embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W2089813815,"Degradation of certain proteins through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is a common strategy taken by the key modulators responsible for stress responses. Kelch-like ECH-associated protein-1(Keap1), a substrate adaptor component of the Cullin3 (Cul3)-based ubiquitin E3 ligase complex, mediates the ubiquitination of two key modulators, NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and IκB kinase β (IKKβ), which are involved in the redox control of gene transcription. However, compared to the Keap1-Nrf2 protein-protein interaction (PPI), the intermolecular recognition mechanism of Keap1 and IKKβ has been poorly investigated. In order to explore the binding pattern between Keap1 and IKKβ, the PPI model of Keap1 and IKKβ was investigated. The structure of human IKKβ was constructed by means of the homology modeling method and using reported crystal structure of Xenopus laevis IKKβ as the template. A protein-protein docking method was applied to develop the Keap1-IKKβ complex model. After the refinement and visual analysis of docked proteins, the chosen pose was further optimized through molecular dynamics simulations. The resulting structure was utilized to conduct the virtual alanine mutation for the exploration of hot-spots significant for the intermolecular interaction. Overall, our results provided structural insights into the PPI model of Keap1-IKKβ and suggest that the substrate specificity of Keap1 depend on the interaction with the key tyrosines, namely Tyr525, Tyr574 and Tyr334. The study presented in the current project may be useful to design molecules that selectively modulate Keap1. The selective recognition mechanism of Keap1 with IKKβ or Nrf2 will be helpful to further know the crosstalk between NF-κB and Nrf2 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1997789055,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated as a by-product of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, are particularly damaging to the genome of skeletal muscle because of their high oxygen consumption. Proliferating myoblasts play a key role during muscle regeneration by undergoing myogenic differentiation to fuse and restore damaged muscle. This process is severely impaired during aging and in muscular dystrophies. In this study, we investigated the role of oxidatively damaged DNA and its repair in the mitochondrial genome of proliferating skeletal muscle progenitor myoblasts cells and their terminally differentiated product, myotubes. Using the C2C12 cell line as a well-established model for skeletal muscle differentiation, we show that myoblasts are highly sensitive to ROS-mediated DNA damage, particularly in the mitochondrial genome, due to deficiency in 5' end processing at the DNA strand breaks. Ectopic expression of the mitochondrial-specific 5' exonuclease, EXOG, a key DNA base excision/single strand break repair (BER/SSBR) enzyme, in myoblasts but not in myotubes, improves the cell's resistance to oxidative challenge. We linked loss of myoblast viability by activation of apoptosis with deficiency in the repair of the mitochondrial genome. Moreover, the process of myoblast differentiation increases mitochondrial biogenesis and the level of total glutathione. We speculate that our data may provide a mechanistic explanation for depletion of proliferating muscle precursor cells during the development of sarcopenia, and skeletal muscle dystrophies."
https://openalex.org/W2044505698,"Background Aquaporin (AQP) water channels are important for water homeostasis in all organisms. Malaria transmission is dependent on Anopheles mosquitoes. Water balance is a major factor influencing mosquito survival, which may indirectly affect pathogen transmission. Methodology/Principal Findings We obtained full-length mRNA sequences for Anopheles gambiae aquaporin 1 (AgAQP1) and identified two splice variants for the gene. In vitro expression analysis showed that both variants transported water and were inhibited by Hg2+. One splice variant (AgAQP1A) was exclusively expressed in adult female ovaries indicating a function in mosquito reproduction. The other splice variant (AgAQP1B) was expressed in the midgut, malpighian tubules and the head in adult mosquitoes. Immunolabeling showed that in malpighian tubules, AgAQP1 is expressed in principal cells in the proximal portion and in stellate cells in the distal portion. Moreover, AgAQP1 is expressed in Johnston’s organ (the “ear”), which is important for courtship behavior. Conclusions And Significance These results suggest that AgAQP1 may play roles associated with mating (courtship) and reproduction in addition to water homeostasis in this important African malaria vector."
https://openalex.org/W2123612510,"The purpose of this research was to examine the associations of attachment anxiety and avoidance with personal growth following relationship dissolution, and to test breakup distress, rumination, and tendency to rebound with new partners as mediators of these associations. Study 1 (N = 411) and Study 2 (N = 465) measured attachment style, breakup distress, and personal growth; Study 2 additionally measured ruminative reflection, brooding, and proclivity to rebound with new partners. Structural equation modelling revealed in both studies that anxiety was indirectly associated with greater personal growth through heightened breakup distress, whereas avoidance was indirectly associated with lower personal growth through inhibited breakup distress. Study 2 further showed that the positive association of breakup distress with personal growth was accounted for by enhanced reflection and brooding, and that anxious individuals’ greater personal growth was also explained by their proclivity to rebound. These findings suggest that anxious individuals’ hyperactivated breakup distress may act as a catalyst for personal growth by promoting the cognitive processing of breakup-related thoughts and emotions, whereas avoidant individuals’ deactivated distress may inhibit personal growth by suppressing this cognitive work."

It is very interesting to notice that a rubber tree of clone PR107 in Yunnan, China is reported to yield more than 20 times higher than the average rubber tree. This super-high-yielding (SHY) rubber tree (designated as SY107), produced 4.12 kg of latex (cytoplasm of rubber producing laticifers, containing about 30% of rubber) per tapping, more than 7-fold higher than that of the control. This rubber tree is therefore a good material to study how the rubber production is regulated at a molecular aspect. A comprehensive cDNA-AFLP transcript profiling was performed on the latex of SY107 and its average counterparts by using the 384 selective primer pairs for two restriction enzyme combinations (ApoI/MseI and TaqI/MseI). A total of 746 differentially expressed (DE) transcript-derived fragments (TDFs) were identified, of which the expression patterns of 453 TDFs were further confirmed by RT-PCR. These RT-PCR confirmed TDFs represented 352 non-redundant genes, of which 215 had known or partially known functions and were grouped into 10 functional categories. The top three largest categories were transcription and protein synthesis (representing 24.7% of the total genes), defense and stress (15.3%), and primary and secondary metabolism (14.0%). Detailed analysis of the DE-genes suggests notable characteristics of SHY phenotype in improved sucrose loading capability, rubber biosynthesis-preferred sugar utilization, enhanced general metabolism and timely stress alleviation. However, the SHY phenotype has little correlation with rubber-biosynthesis pathway genes."
https://openalex.org/W2071799869,"Melanosomes are lysosome-related organelles that serve as specialized sites of melanin synthesis and storage in melanocytes. The progression of melanosomes through the different stages of their formation requires trafficking of specific proteins and membrane constituents in a sequential manner, which is likely to deploy ubiquitous cellular machinery along with melanocyte-specific proteins. Recent evidence revealed a connection between melanogenesis and the autophagy machinery, suggesting a novel role for members of the latter in melanocytes. Here we focused on ULK1, a key autophagy protein which is negatively regulated by mTORC1, to assess its potential role in melanogenesis in MNT-1 cells. We found that ULK1 depletion causes an increase in melanin levels, suggesting an inhibitory function for this protein in melanogenesis. Furthermore, this increase was accompanied by increased transcription of MITF (microphthalmia-associated transcription factor) and tyrosinase and by elevated protein levels of tyrosinase, the rate-limiting factor in melanin biogenesis. We also provide evidence to show that ULK1 function in this context is independent of the canonical ULK1 autophagy partners, ATG13 and FIP200. Furthermore we show that regulation of melanogenesis by ULK1 is independent of mTORC1 inhibition. Our data thus provide intriguing insights regarding the involvement of the key regulatory autophagy machinery in melanogenesis."

NDRG1 is expressed in primary human trophoblasts, where it promotes cell viability and resistance to hypoxic injury. The mechanism of action of NDRG1 remains unknown. To gain further insight into the intracellular action of NDRG1, we analyzed the expression pattern and cellular localization of endogenous NDRG1 and transfected Myc-tagged NDRG1 in human trophoblasts exposed to diverse injuries. In standard conditions, NDRG1 was diffusely expressed in the cytoplasm at a low level. Hypoxia or the hypoxia mimetic cobalt chloride, but not serum deprivation, ultraviolet (UV) light, or ionizing radiation, induced the expression of NDRG1 in human trophoblasts and the redistribution of NDRG1 into the nucleus and cytoplasmic membranes associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and microtubules. Mutation of the phosphopantetheine attachment site (PPAS) within NDRG1 abrogated this pattern of redistribution. Our results shed new light on the impact of cell injury on NDRG1 expression patterns, and suggest that the PPAS domain plays a key role in NDRG1's subcellular distribution."

Whether or not personalised feedback about physical activity following objective measurement motivates behaviour change has yet to be rigorously examined.And Findings: In a parallel group, open randomised controlled trial, 466 healthy adults aged 32 to 54 years were recruited from the ongoing population-based Fenland Study (Cambridgeshire, UK). Participants were randomised to receive either no feedback until the end of the trial (control group, n=120) or one of three different types of feedback: simple, visual, or contextualised (intervention groups, n=346). The primary outcome was physical activity (physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) in kJ/kg/day and average body acceleration (ACC) in m/s(2)) measured objectively using a combined heart rate monitor and accelerometer (Actiheart(®)). The main secondary outcomes included self-reported physical activity, intention to increase physical activity, and awareness of physical activity (the agreement between self-rated and objectively measured physical activity). At 8 weeks, 391 (83.9%) participants had complete physical activity data. The intervention had no effect on objectively measured physical activity (PAEE: β=-0.92, 95% CI=-3.50 to 1.66, p=0.48 and ACC: β=0.01, 95% CI=-0.00 to 0.02, p=0.21), self-reported physical activity (β=-0.39, 95% CI=-1.59 to 0.81), or intention to increase physical activity (β=-0.05, 95% CI=-0.22 to 0.11). However, it was associated with an increase in awareness of physical activity (OR=1.74, 95% CI=1.05 to 2.89). Results did not differ according to the type of feedback.Personalised feedback about physical activity following objective measurement increased awareness but did not result in changes in physical activity in the short term.

https://openalex.org/W2010828588,"Mountaintop removal-valley fill coal mining has been associated with a variety of impacts on ecosystem and human health, in particular reductions in the biodiversity of receiving streams. However, effluents emerging from valley fills contain a complex mixture of chemicals including metals, metalloids, and salts, and it is not clear which of these are the most important drivers of toxicity. We found that streamwater and sediment samples collected from mine-impacted streams of the Upper Mud River in West Virginia inhibited the growth of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Next, we took advantage of genetic and transgenic tools available in this model organism to test the hypotheses that the toxicity could be attributed to metals, selenium, oxidative stress, or osmotic stress. Our results indicate that in general, the toxicity of streamwater to C. elegans was attributable to osmotic stress, while the toxicity of sediments resulted mostly from metals or metalloids."
https://openalex.org/W2019767119,"Listeria monocytogenes is a foodborne bacterial pathogen and the causative agent of an infectious disease, listeriosis. L. monocytogenes is ubiquitous in nature and has the ability to persist in food processing environments for extended periods of time by forming biofilms and resisting industrial sanitization. Human listeriosis outbreaks are commonly linked to contaminated dairy products, ready-to-eat meats, and in recent years, fresh produce such as lettuce and cantaloupes. We identified a putative Crp/Fnr family transcription factor Lmo0753 that is highly specific to human-associated genetic lineages of L. monocytogenes. Lmo0753 possesses two conserved functional domains similar to the major virulence regulator PrfA in L. monocytogenes. To determine if Lmo0753 is involved in environmental persistence-related mechanisms, we compared lmo0753 deletion mutants with respective wild type and complementation mutants of two fully sequenced L. monocytogenes genetic lineage II strains 10403S and EGDe for the relative ability of growth under different nutrient availability and temperatures, soil survival, biofilm productivity and attachment to select fresh produce surfaces including romaine lettuce leaves and cantaloupe rinds. Our results collectively suggested that Lmo0753 plays an important role in L. monocytogenes biofilm production and attachment to fresh produce, which may contribute to the environmental persistence and recent emergence of this pathogen in human listeriosis outbreaks linked to fresh produce."
https://openalex.org/W2003207662,"We tested non-musicians and musicians in an auditory psychophysical experiment to assess the effects of timbre manipulation on pitch-interval discrimination. Both groups were asked to indicate the larger of two presented intervals, comprised of four sequentially presented pitches; the second or fourth stimulus within a trial was either a sinusoidal (or “pure”), flute, piano, or synthetic voice tone, while the remaining three stimuli were all pure tones. The interval-discrimination tasks were administered parametrically to assess performance across varying pitch distances between intervals (“interval-differences”). Irrespective of timbre, musicians displayed a steady improvement across interval-differences, while non-musicians only demonstrated enhanced interval discrimination at an interval-difference of 100 cents (one semitone in Western music). Surprisingly, the best discrimination performance across both groups was observed with pure-tone intervals, followed by intervals containing a piano tone. More specifically, we observed that: 1) timbre changes within a trial affect interval discrimination; and 2) the broad spectral characteristics of an instrumental timbre may influence perceived pitch or interval magnitude and make interval discrimination more difficult."
https://openalex.org/W2029172188,"Background Flow Cytometry (FCM) is still considered to be the method of choice for accurate CD4 enumeration. However, the use of FCM in developing countries is problematic due to their cost and complexity. Lower-cost technologies have been introduced. We evaluated CyFlow Counter together with its lyophilized reagents, and Pima CD4 in high-temperature area, using FACSCount as reference. Materials and Methods Whole blood samples were consecutively collected by venipuncture from 111 HIV+ patients and 17 HIV-negative donors. CD4 T-cell enumeration was performed on CyFlow Counter, Pima CD4 and FACSCount. Results CyFlow Counter and Pima CD4 systems showed good correlation with FACSCount (slope of 0.82 and 0.90, and concordance ρc of 0.94 and 0.98, respectively). CyFlow Counter showed absolute or relative biases (LOA) of −63 cells/mm3 (−245 to 120) or −9.8% (−38.1 to 18.4) respectively, and Pima CD4 showed biases (LOA) of −30 cells/mm3 (−160 to 101) or −3.5% (−41.0 to 33.9%). CyFlow Counter and Pima CD4 showed respectively 106.7% and 105.9% of similarity with FACSCount. According to WHO-2010 ART initiation threshold of 350 cells/mm3, CyFlow Counter and Pima CD4 showed respectively sensibility of 100% and 97%, and specificity of 91% and 93%. CyFlow Counter and Pima CD4 were strongly correlated (slope of 1.09 and ρc of 0.95). These alternative systems showed good agreement with bias of 33 cells/mm3 (−132 to 203) or 6.3% (−31.2 to 43.8), and similarity of 104.3%. Conclusion CyFlow Counter using CD4 easy count kit-dry and Pima CD4 systems can accurately provide CD4 T-cell counts with acceptable agreement to those of FACSCount."
https://openalex.org/W2036135985,"Since individualized therapy becomes more and more important in the treatment of rectal cancer, an accurate and effective approach should be established in the clinical settings to help physicians to make their decisions. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs), originated from either primary or metastatic cancer, could provide important information for diagnosis and monitoring of cancer. However, the implication and development of CTCs are limited due to the extreme rarity of these tumor cells. In this study we fabricated a simple and high-performance microfluidic device, which exploited numerous filtered microchannels in it to enrich the large-sized target tumor cells from whole blood. A very high CTC capture efficiency (average recovery rate: 94%) was obtained in this device at the optimum flow rate of 0.5 mL/h and channel height of 5 µm. Additionally, we used this device for detecting CTCs in 60 patients with rectal cancer. The CTC counts of rectal cancer patients were significantly higher than those in healthy subjects. Furthermore, the CTC counts detected by this device were significantly higher than those by EpCAM bead-based method for rectal cancer patients with various stage. Especially, for localized rectal cancer patients, the positive rates of samples with more than 3 CTCs per 5 mL blood by use of microdevice vs. EpCAM-based ones were 100% vs. 47%, respectively. Thus, this device provides a new and effective tool for accurate identification and measurement of CTCs in patients with rectal cancer, and has broad potential in clinical practice."

To survive in the intestine, C. jejuni must successfully compete with the microbiota and overcome the host immune defense. Campylobacter jejuni colonization success varies considerably amongst individual mice, and we examined the degree to which the intestinal microbiota was affected in mice (i.e. a model carrier animal) colonized by C. jejuni at high relative to low densities.Mice were inoculated with C. jejuni or buffer, and pathogen shedding and intestinal colonization were measured. Histopathologic scoring and quantification of mRNA expression for α-defensins, toll-like receptors, and cytokine genes were conducted. Mucosa-associated bacterial communities were characterized by two approaches: multiplexed barcoded pyrosequencing and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis.Two C. jejuni treatments were established based on the degree of cecal and colonic colonization; C. jejuni Group A animals were colonized at high cell densities, and C. jejuni Group B animals were colonized at lower cell densities. Histological examination of cecal and colonic tissues indicated that C. jejuni did not incite visible pathologic changes. Although there was no significant difference among treatments in expression of mRNA for α-defensins, toll-like receptors, or cytokine genes, a trend for increased expression of toll-like receptors and cytokine genes was observed for C. jejuni Group A. The results of the two methods to characterize bacterial communities indicated that the composition of the cecal microbiota of C. jejuni Group A mice differed significantly from C. jejuni Group B and Control mice. This difference was due to a reduction in load, diversity and richness of bacteria associated with the cecal mucosa of C. jejuni Group A mice.High density colonization by C. jejuni is associated with a dysbiosis in the cecal microbiota independent of prominent inflammation."

https://openalex.org/W2033164366,"Failure of homologous synapsis during meiotic prophase triggers transcriptional repression. Asynapsis of the X and Y chromosomes and their consequent silencing is essential for spermatogenesis. However, asynapsis of portions of autosomes in heterozygous translocation carriers may be detrimental for meiotic progression. In fact, a wide range of phenotypic outcomes from meiotic arrest to normal spermatogenesis have been described and the causes of such a variation remain elusive. To better understand the consequences of asynapsis in male carriers of Robertsonian translocations, we focused on the dynamics of recruitment of markers of asynapsis and meiotic silencing at unsynapsed autosomal trivalents in the spermatocytes of Robertsonian translocation carrier mice. Here we report that the enrichment of breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) and histone γH2AX at unsynapsed trivalents declines during the pachytene stage of meiosis and differs from that observed in the sex body. Furthermore, histone variant H3.3S31, which associates with the sex chromosomes in metaphase I/anaphase I spermatocytes, localizes to autosomes in 12% and 31% of nuclei from carriers of one and three translocations, respectively. These data suggest that the proportion of spermatocytes with markers of meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin (MSUC) at trivalents depends on both, the stage of meiosis and the number of translocations. This may explain some of the variability in phenotypic outcomes associated with Robertsonian translocations. In addition our data suggest that the dynamics of response to asynapsis in Robertsonian translocations differs from the response to sex chromosomal asynapsis in the male germ line."
https://openalex.org/W1970311605,"Cutaneous regeneration utilizes paracrine feedback mechanisms to fine-tune the regulation of epidermal keratinocyte proliferation and migration. However, it is unknown how fibroblast-derived hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) affects these mutually exclusive processes in distinct cell populations. We here show that HGF stimulates the expression and phosphorylation of the microtubule-destabilizing factor stathmin in primary human keratinocytes. Quantitative single cell- and cell population-based analyses revealed that basal stathmin levels are important for the migratory ability of keratinocytes in vitro; however, its expression is moderately induced in the migration tongue of mouse skin or organotypic multi-layered keratinocyte 3D cultures after full-thickness wounding. In contrast, clearly elevated stathmin expression is detectable in hyperproliferative epidermal areas. In vitro, stathmin silencing significantly reduced keratinocyte proliferation. Automated quantitative and time-resolved analyses in organotypic cocultures demonstrated a high correlation between Stathmin/phospho-Stathmin and Ki67 positivity in epidermal regions with proliferative activity. Thus, activation of stathmin may stimulate keratinocyte proliferation, while basal stathmin levels are sufficient for keratinocyte migration during cutaneous regeneration."

We have evaluated two screening methods in Tanzania: an enzyme immunoassay (EIA), and a point-of-care test (POCT). We evaluated the performance of each test against the Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (TPPA) as the reference method, and the accessibility of testing in a rural district of Tanzania. The POCT was performed in the clinic on whole blood, while the other assays were performed on plasma in the laboratory. Samples were also tested by the rapid plasma Reagin (RPR) test. With TPPA as reference assay, the sensitivity and specificity of EIA were 95.3% and 97.8%, and of the POCT were 59.6% and 99.4% respectively. The sensitivity of the POCT and EIA for active syphilis cases (TPPA positive and RPR titer ≥1/8) were 82% and 100% respectively. Only 15% of antenatal clinic attenders in this district visited a health facility with a laboratory capable of performing the EIA. Although it is less sensitive than EIA, its greater accessibility, and the fact that treatment can be given on the same day, means that the use of POCT would result in a higher proportion of women with syphilis receiving treatment than with the EIA in this district of Tanzania."

The survey included questions about the acceptance of MC for self, infants, and sons before and after an information session about the benefits of MC in preventing HIV/STI transmission. Logistic regression models were used to identify factors that were associated with acceptability of MC. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated from the models.Fourteen percent of the men reported that they were circumcised. In the multivariable model, which adjusted for age, education, religion and income, there were increased odds of accepting MC for infants/sons among uncircumcised men who accepted MC for self (AOR=8.1; 95% CI = 4.1-15.9), believed they would experience more pleasure during sex if circumcised (AOR=4.0; 95% CI = 2.0-8.2), and reported having no concerns regarding MC (AOR=3.0; 95% CI = 1.8-4.8). Similarly, uncircumcised men who reported no concerns about MC or who believed that they would experience more pleasure during sex if circumcised were more likely to accept MC for self.Providing men with information about MC increased acceptance of MC for self, infants (<17 years) and sons (1-17 years). Since targeted education on the benefits of male circumcision for prevention of HIV/STI can be effective in increasing acceptability of MC, health professionals should be trained, and willing to discuss MC with men in healthcare facilities and in the community."
https://openalex.org/W2077107039,"Amyloid-β (Aβ) plays a causative role in Alzheimer's disease. Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is involved in Aβ accumulation, whereas occlusal disharmony increases Aβ production in the rat hippocampus. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of apoE deficiency and occlusal disharmony on Aβ production and spatial memory. Wild-type (WT) (n = 12) and apoE-deficient [ApoE(-/-)] (n = 12) rats (Sprague-Dawley; 8 weeks old) were used. These rats were randomly divided into four groups of six rats each: two control (C) groups: WT (C-WT) and ApoE [C-ApoE(-/-)], and two occlusal disharmony (D) groups: WT (D-WT) and ApoE [D-ApoE(-/-)]. The C group received no treatment for 8 weeks. In the D group, the maxillary molar cusps were cut off for 8 weeks. The spatial memory of rats was assessed according to their behavioral performance in a radial arm maze. In both genotypes of rats, significant differences in the reference memory, Aβ42 production, β-secretase expression and plasma corticosterone levels were observed between the C and D groups (P < 0.0125). The levels of Aβ42 and glucocorticoid receptor in the C-ApoE(-/-) group were also significantly higher than those in the C-WT group (P < 0.0125). However, no significant differences in these parameters were found between the two genotypes with occlusal disharmony. In conclusion, occlusal disharmony induces cognitive dysfunction and Aβ accumulation in the rat hippocampus, and the effects of occlusal disharmony on Aβ accumulation and cognitive dysfunction were larger than those of apoE deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2079069999,"A hypometabolic state can be induced in mice by 5'-AMP administration. Previously we proposed that an underlying mechanism for this hypometabolism is linked to reduced erythrocyte oxygen transport function due to 5'-AMP uptake altering the cellular adenylate equilibrium. To test this hypothesis, we generated mice deficient in adenosine monophosphate deaminase 3 (AMPD3), the key catabolic enzyme for 5'-AMP in erythrocytes. Mice deficient in AMPD3 maintained AMPD activities in all tissues except erythrocytes. Developmentally and morphologically, the Ampd3(-/-) mice were indistinguishable from their wild type siblings. The levels of ATP, ADP but not 5'-AMP in erythrocytes of Ampd3(-/-) mice were significantly elevated. Fasting blood glucose levels of the Ampd3(-/-) mice were comparable to wild type siblings. In comparison to wild type mice, the Ampd3(-/-) mice displayed a deeper hypometabolism with a significantly delayed average arousal time in response to 5'-AMP administration. Together, these findings demonstrate a central role of AMPD3 in the regulation of 5'-AMP mediated hypometabolism and further implicate erythrocytes in this behavioral response."
https://openalex.org/W1975040234,"Photoreceptor cell-specific receptor (PNR/NR2E3) is an orphan nuclear receptor that plays a critical role in retinal development and photoreceptor maintenance. The disease-causing mutations in PNR have a pleiotropic effect resulting in varying retinal diseases. Recently, PNR has been implicated in control of cellular functions in cancer cells. PNR was reported to be a novel regulator of ERα expression in breast cancer cells, and high PNR expression correlates with favorable response to tamoxifen treatment. Moreover, PNR was shown to increase p53 stability in HeLa cells, implying that PNR may be a therapeutic target in this and other cancers that retain a wild type p53 gene. To facilitate further understanding of PNR functions in cancer, we characterized compound 11a, a synthetic, putative PNR agonist in several cell-based assays. Interestingly, we showed that 11a failed to activate PNR and its cytotoxicity was independent of PNR expression, excluding PNR as a mediator for 11a cytotoxicity. Systematic analyses of the cytotoxic effects of 11a in NCI-60 cell lines revealed a strong positive correlation of cytotoxicity with p53 status, i.e., p53 wild type cell lines were significantly more sensitive to 11a than p53 mutated or null cell lines. Furthermore, using HCT116 p53+/+ and p53-/- isogenic cell lines we revealed that the mechanism of 11a-induced cytotoxicity occurred through G1/S phase cell cycle arrest rather than apoptosis. In conclusion, we observed a correlation of 11a sensitivity with p53 status but not with PNR expression, suggesting that tumors expressing wild type p53 might be responsive to this compound."
https://openalex.org/W1482524378,"About 80% of West Africans live in rural populations that mainly depend on rain-fed, cereal-based subsistence agriculture. These areas are highly vulnerable to climate variability. The increasing frequency and severity of climate extremes — primarily drought — have led to food crises in the sub-Saharan Sahel region. Although existing technologies and practices can mitigate agricultural risk, farmers need access to accurate long- and short-term weather forecasts so they can utilize these measures more effectively.

One solution is localized seasonal climate forecasts for farmers. Partners from CCAFS in West Africa have recently tried such an approach in the Kaffrine district in central Senegal.

To help ease the transition from traditional forecast practices, we presented the new information to farmers alongside discussions about established methods. Farmers in Kaffrine were able to develop adaptive techniques from climate information and choose a good strategy for improving yield during dry and wet seasons."
https://openalex.org/W2024145071,"The stem cell field is currently engaged in a feisty debate about how to advance innovative research while assuring that clinical translation proceeds safely and prudently. Every new approach comes under scrutiny, but over recent years broad claims about the properties and potential of adult stem cell populations have been a particular focus of concern. In April, these issues rose to the fore again when scientists at the University of Michigan and New-York-based NeoStem Inc. announced plans to launch a first-in-man trial using very small embryonic-like cells (VSELs) to regenerate bone. Many leading stem cell researchers argue that this step is premature. The data on VSELs are much less well established than they are for mesenchymal stem cells, says George Daley, Director of Stem Cell Transplantation at Children’s Hospital, Boston, and yet no one to date has proven how to harness MSCs to improve bone healing. Outstanding questions abound, including the very basic one of whether VSELs are in fact cells at all, as opposed to subcellular particles or debris. “If they have found a new kind of cell with miraculous properties, they certainly haven’t established it in a rigorous way that’s been convincing to the general community,” says Daley. Indeed, only a handful of groups have published on VSELs, and an almost equal number of groups have published papers with negative results. It’s a view echoed by Christine Mummery, a professor of developmental biology at Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands. “They are obviously measuring something. But it’s difficult to say what,” she says. “As long as these cells remain rather odd and the experiments that are published seem slightly less than robust, I think they’re open to question.” Even Mariusz Ratajczak, director of the developmental biology research program at the University of Louisville’s James Graham Brown Cancer Center and the lead author of the paper that brought VSELs into the literature, is anxious about the pace at which they are being pushed. “I’m a little bit scared because I know that NeoStem would like to go fast to the clinic,” he says. “I still think we need to do more basic research.” Back in 2006, Ratajczak and his colleagues, who were working with mice, were the first to describe a population of small cells (around 3.6 μm in diameter) with a thin rim of cytoplasm surrounding a euchromatin-rich nucleus, and apparently boasting a suite of molecular markers characteristic of pluripotent embryonic stem cells. In culture, these cells, which they christened VSEL cells, seemed capable of differentiation into all three germ layer lineages, leading to the suggestion that they “could be a source of pluripotent stem cells for tissue/organ regeneration.” (Reviewed in Kassmer et al., 2013Kassmer S.H. Jin H. Zhang P.X. Bruscia E.M. Heydari K. Lee J.H. Kim C.F. Krause D.S. Stem Cells. 2013; (in press. Published online May 16, 2013)https://doi.org/10.1002/stem.1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Since then, Ratajczak’s group and others have described cells with a similar morphological and molecular profile in a broad range of murine tissues, from cord blood and bone marrow to heart and brain, and even in the reproductive organs. Some studies have also suggested that mouse VSELs are highly mobile, with concentrations in the peripheral blood escalating in response to a range of insults, including myocardial infarction, stroke, skin burns, and Crohn’s disease (reviewed in Kassmer et al., 2013Kassmer S.H. Jin H. Zhang P.X. Bruscia E.M. Heydari K. Lee J.H. Kim C.F. Krause D.S. Stem Cells. 2013; (in press. Published online May 16, 2013)https://doi.org/10.1002/stem.1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). When the University of Louisville began to circulate the patents it had filed to protect the use of these cells for a range of clinical indications, there was interest from NeoStem, a biopharmaceutical company with a focus on the therapeutic potential of adult cells. “Our interest was to see if these cells were present in humans,” says Denis Rodgerson, founder and Director of Stem Cell Science at NeoStem, which acquired the worldwide exclusive license to VSEL technology in 2007. “It was an intriguing opportunity.” NeoStem has developed a protocol for the isolation and extraction of what they present as an analogous population of cells in humans and has filed around 20 patent applications protecting the method for isolating these cells and “a very broad swath of indications that one could imagine using these cells for regenerative purposes,” says Todd Girolamo, Associate General Counsel at NeoStem. NeoStem and a range of partner institutions have also obtained an estimated $4.5 million in government grants—notably from the Department of Defense and NIH—to explore the potential of human VSELs for regenerative medicine. “We have strong evidence suggesting that these cells will differentiate into all mesenchymal tissue in vivo,” says Rodgerson. Furthest along the development pipeline, in partnership with researchers at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, is research into the differentiation of VSELs into bone. Based on a paper published in February (Havens et al., 2013Havens A.M. Shiozawa Y. Jung Y. Sun H. Wang J. McGee S. Mishra A. Taichman L.S. Danciu T. Jiang Y. et al.Stem Cells Dev. 2013; 22: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), NeoStem is planning to apply for FDA approval to carry out a first-in-man trial using VSELs to regenerate bone following a tooth extraction. “We certainly want to demonstrate with this first-in-man trial the safety of these V[SEL] cells,” says Tim Fong, NeoStem’s Vice President for Technology and Product Development. “This will make it easier to think about establishing clinical efficacy and the other indications that NeoStem is interested in.” But many in the wider stem cell community remain unconvinced. “To make a robust claim for a new type of ‘embryonic-like’ cell, you come at it every which way from Sunday,” says Daley. “This rigorous approach just hasn’t been taken with VSELs. I find the work mystifying and lacking in rigor.” The relationship that NeoStem has forged with the Vatican through the Stem for Life Foundation (a not-for-profit organization set up by NeoStem to promote the potential of adult stem cells) has also influenced the wider perception of the company and its research. A recent editorial in Nature (Nature, 2013NatureNature. 2013; 496: 269-270Google Scholar) was scathing about a meeting organized by the Stem for Life Foundation in Vatican City in April: “Sick children were paraded for television, sharing the stage with stem cell companies and scientists desperate to hawk a message that their therapies must be speeded to clinical use.” Some in the field have also raised concerns about the potential for the Vatican to exert influence over the scientific focus of Neostem through this connection. Chris Mason, Chair of Regenerative Medicine Bioprocessing at University College, London attended the conference and begs to differ. “I was very cautious before I accepted the invitation,” he says. “But I did actually see a genuine meeting and genuine dialogue. Unfortunately a lot of the reporting made about that conference was by people who did not attend.” That said, there are still a lot of unanswered questions about VSELs, says Mason. “It’s all about reproducibility. We need to see more standards, more characterization, and more common assays used that enable us to compare these different cell types and to really know what they do.” Recent publications have underscored these concerns. For one study, Vita34, a private cord blood bank in Germany, teamed up with researchers at the University of Leipzig to isolate human VSELs from some of their banked samples. In the resulting paper, they claimed to have isolated human VSELs, reporting that they “failed to expand in vitro under a wide range of culture conditions known to support embryonic or adult stem cell types” (Danova-Alt et al., 2012Danova-Alt R. Heider A. Egger D. Cross M. Alt R. PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e34899Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). “We would have found them if they were there,” asserts Rüdiger Alt, lead author on the paper and now head of research and development at Vita34. “If they had any sort of proliferative capacity, it should have turned out in our assays, but it didn’t.” Based on this analysis Vita34 is no longer pursuing research into these cells, he says. For Ratajczak, there is a simple explanation. “In studying rare populations of cells, one needs to compare apples to apples, which unfortunately was not done,” he says. “They did not follow our isolation protocol. All the experiments they performed were performed on the wrong population of cells.” Ratajczak is similarly dismissive of a study that appeared earlier this year that called into question the reported properties of VSELs, this time in mice (Szade et al., 2013Szade K. Bukowska-Strakova K. Nowak W.N. Szade A. Kachamakova-Trojanowska N. Zukowska M. Jozkowicz A. Dulak J. PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e63329Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and he cites another study claiming to demonstrate the differentiation of VSELs into lung tissue in mice (reviewed in Kassmer et al., 2013Kassmer S.H. Jin H. Zhang P.X. Bruscia E.M. Heydari K. Lee J.H. Kim C.F. Krause D.S. Stem Cells. 2013; (in press. Published online May 16, 2013)https://doi.org/10.1002/stem.1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). But an even more recent paper—the most robust effort yet to replicate the isolation of VSELs in mice—may be harder to dismiss. “We found that every step of the way, we could not confirm the results of the Ratajczak group,” says Irving Weissman, Director of the Stanford Institute of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine and the senior author of the article in Stem Cell Reports (Miyanishi et al., 2013Miyanishi M. Mori Y. Seita J. Carten S. Chen J.Y. Karten S. Chan C.K.F. Nakauchi H. Weissman I.L. Stem Cell Rep. 2013; (Published online July 24, 2013)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stemcr.2013.07.001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (67) Google Scholar). As a result, Weissman argues that clinical investigation of VSELs is misguided and may be driven more by ideological or commercial hopes for adult (as opposed to embryonic) stem cells than by robust scientific support. Daley would like to see a rapid resolution to this stalemate. “The folks who are making negative claims should be encouraged to contact the original lab to refine the isolation protocols,” he says. But, he adds, “it should be incumbent upon Ratajczak to share the protocol in a way that’s robust and reproducible. It doesn’t do the field any good if only one lab has the right hocus pocus to make a technique work.” Daley cites technical concerns about many aspects of the original VSEL work, which claimed the cells were pluripotent and yet lacked a clear-cut comparison to verified pluripotent stem cells. He would like to see proponents of VSELs use the most rigorous experimental approaches available, such as pluripotent reporter gene expression and lineage tracing in mice, and work with others to ensure reproducibility before moving forward with any type of clinical application. “Is there a real pluripotent cell here that can be cultured, expanded, and harnessed for therapeutic potential?” asks Daley. “Or are they chasing cellular contaminants that can’t be easily exploited for clinical application?” Despite such questions, NeoStem intends to proceed. “I don’t think it’s unusual that you have conflicting or controversial data in a field that, in my opinion, is still relatively early in terms of understanding and fully characterizing human V[SEL] cells,” says Fong. “The proof will be in the clinical trials that will hopefully come in the future.” But for others in the wider stem cell field, the pace at which VSELs are being pushed is a cause of considerable concern. “We need more independent validation of VSELs before clinical introduction,” says Mummery. “If these unproven technologies are pushed too hard commercially, there is a real danger that it will raise the expectations of the public. This could be very damaging to the field as a whole.” Do Pluripotent Stem Cells Exist in Adult Mice as Very Small Embryonic Stem Cells?Miyanishi et al.Stem Cell ReportsJuly 24, 2013In BriefVery small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs) isolated from bone marrow (BM) have been reported to be pluripotent. Given their nonembryonic source, they could replace blastocyst-derived embryonic stem cells in research and medicine. However, their multiple-germ-layer potential has been incompletely studied. Here, we show that we cannot find VSELs in mouse BM with any of the reported stem cell potentials, specifically for hematopoiesis. We found that: (1) most events within the “VSEL” flow-cytometry gate had little DNA and the cells corresponding to these events (2) could not form spheres, (3) did not express Oct4, and (4) could not differentiate into blood cells.

One such small molecule VEGFR inhibitor, SU5416, limits angiogenesis in vivo and is widely used for investigating VEGFR signaling in tumor pathophysiology. Herein, we describe novel actions of SU5416 on the immune system. Treatment of mice with SU5416 for 3 days induced significant reductions in size and cellularity of peripheral lymph nodes. Interestingly, SU5416 did not affect initial lymphocyte localization to peripheral lymph nodes but did reduce lymphocyte accumulation during long-term migration assays. Treatment with SU5416 also induced severe loss of double-positive thymocytes resulting in thymic atrophy and a reduction in peripheral B cells. Furthermore, immune responses following immunization were reduced in mice treated with SU5416. Findings of thymic atrophy and reduced weight gain during SU5416 treatment suggested elevated corticosterone levels. Indeed, a significant 5-fold increase in serum corticosterone was found 4 hours after treatment with SU5416. Importantly, adrenalectomy negated the effects of SU5416 treatment on primary immune tissues, and partial reversal of SU5416-induced changes was observed following blockade of glucocorticoid receptors. SU5416 has been reported to inhibit the activation of latent transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, a cytokine involved in the regulation of glucocorticoid release by the adrenal glands. Interestingly, treatment with a TGF-β receptor inhibitor, showed a similar phenotype as SU5416 treatment, including elevated serum corticosterone levels and thymic atrophy. Therefore, these results suggest that SU5416 induces glucocorticoid release directly from the adrenal glands, possibly by inhibition of TGF-β activation."

https://openalex.org/W2004200378,"Firefly luciferase (Luc) is widely used as a reporter enzyme in cell-based assays for gene expression. A novel aromatic carboxylic acid, F-53, reported here for the first time, substantially inhibited the enzymatic activity of Luc in a Luc reporter screening. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analyses showed that F-53 modifies Luc at lysine-529 via amidation of the F-53 carboxyl group. The lysine-529 residue of Luc, which plays a regulatory catalytic role, can be acetylated. Luc also has a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthase activity. An in vitro assay that involved both recombinant Luc and mouse liver microsomes identified F-53-CoA as the reactive form produced from F-53. However, whereas the inhibitory effect of F-53 is observed in Hela cells that transiently expressed Luc, it is not observed in an in vitro assay that involves recombinant Luc alone. Therefore, insights into the activities of certain mammalian transferases can be translated to better understand the acylation by F-53. The insights from this study about the novel inhibitory modification mechanism might help not only to avoid misinterpretation of the results of Luc-based reporter screening assays but also to explain the pharmacological and toxicological effects of carboxylic acid-containing drugs."
