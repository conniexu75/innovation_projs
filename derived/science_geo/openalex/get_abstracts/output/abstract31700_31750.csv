https://openalex.org/W2162804111,"An endothelium-derived 21-residue vasoconstrictor peptide, endothelin, has been isolated, and shown to be one of the most potent vasoconstrictors known. Cloning and sequencing of preproendothelin complementary DNA shows that mature endothelin is generated through an unusual proteolytic processing, and regional homologies to a group of neurotoxins suggest that endothelin is an endogenous modulator of voltage-dependent ion channels. Expression of the endothelin gene is regulated by several vasoactive agents, indicating the existence of a novel cardiovascular control system."
https://openalex.org/W2041585886,Abnormal vascularization of malignant tumors is associated with the development of microregions of heterogeneous cells and environments. Experimental models such as multicell spheroids and a variety of new techniques are being used to determine the characteristics of these microregions and to study the interactions of the cells and microenvironments. The special cellular microecology of tumors influences responsiveness to therapeutic agents and has implications for future directions in cancer research.
https://openalex.org/W1999347013,"The biosynthetic rates for both the transferrin receptor (TfR) and ferritin are regulated by iron. An iron-responsive element (IRE) in the 5' untranslated portion of the ferritin messenger RNA (mRNA) mediates iron-dependent control of its translation. In this report the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA for the human TfR was shown to be necessary and sufficient for iron-dependent control of mRNA levels. Deletion studies identified a 678-nucleotide fragment of the TfR complementary DNA that is critical for this iron regulation. Five potential stem-loops that resemble the ferritin IRE are contained within the region critical for TfR regulation. Each of two of the five TfR elements was independently inserted into the 5' untranslated region of an indicator gene transcript. In this location they conferred iron regulation of translation. Thus, an mRNA element has been implicated in the mediation of distinct regulatory phenomena dependent on the context of the element within the transcript."
https://openalex.org/W2069522096,"Primary chick embryo fibroblasts attach to a tenascin substrate, but remain rounded and do not spread out. The proportion between tenascin and fibronectin in mixtures used to coat the substrate determines the shape of the cells. Tenascin inhibits integrin-mediated chick fibroblast attachment to fibronectin, laminin, and the GRGDS peptide. Rat fibroblast attachment to fibronectin, but not to laminin, is inhibited by tenascin. A monoclonal antibody against tenascin, as well as its Fab fragments, is able to neutralize the inhibitory activity on cell attachment and is therefore assumed to mask the cell-binding site of tenascin. On electron micrographs showing this monoclonal antibody bound to tenascin, its epitope can be localized to the terminal knob at the distal ends of the tenascin arms."

https://openalex.org/W2082096533,"More than one type of voltage-gated calcium channel has been identified in muscle cells and neurons. Many specific organic and inorganic blockers of the conventional, slowly inactivating high threshold (L) calcium channel have been reported. No specific blockers of the low threshold (T) channel have been as yet identified. Amiloride, a potassium sparing diuretic, has now been shown to selectively block the low threshold calcium channel in mouse neuroblastoma and chick dorsal root ganglion neurons. The selective blockade of the T-type calcium channel will allow identification of this channel in different tissues and characterization of its specific physiological role."
https://openalex.org/W2006074942,"Although the genetic code for protein was established in the 1960's, the basis for amino acid identity of transfer RNA (tRNA) has remained unknown. To investigate the identity of a tRNA, the nucleotides at three computer-identified positions in tRNAPhe (phenylalanine tRNA) were replaced with the corresponding nucleotides from tRNAAla (alanine tRNA). The identity of the resulting tRNA, when examined as an amber suppressor in Escherichia coli, was that of tRNAAla."
https://openalex.org/W2084211101,"The gene for cytochrome oxidase subunit III (COIII) is not detected in T. brucei by nucleotide sequence analysis or by cross-hybridization studies. We have identified the COIII transcript in the T. brucei mitochondrion by RNA and cDNA sequencing. Its nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences are very similar to those from the COIII genes in related species. A mitochondrial DNA sequence that matches the COIII transcript, except for the absence of numerous thymidines, is located upstream of the apocytochrome b gene, the position of the COIII gene in related species. We conclude that this sequence is the COIII gene and that over 50% of the T. brucei COIII transcript sequence is created by RNA editing."
https://openalex.org/W1646810589,"Abstract Human plasma contains a lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor (LACI) which inactivates factor Xa directly, and in a Xa-dependent fashion also inhibits the VIIa-tissue factor complex of the extrinsic coagulation pathway. Rabbit polyclonal anti-LACI antiserum was used to screen human placental and fetal liver lambda gt11 cDNA libraries for the expression of LACI antigens. Immunologically positive clones were further tested for their ability to bind 125I-factor Xa. Seven clones were obtained which are immunologically and functionally active. The longest cDNA insert (lambda P9) of these isolates is 1.4 kilobases (kb) while other clones are 1.0 kb in length. Nucleotide sequence analysis shows that lambda P9 consists of 1431 bases that include a 5'-noncoding sequence of 132 nucleotides, an open reading frame of 912 nucleotides, and a 3'-noncoding region of 387 nucleotides. The open reading frame encodes a signal peptide of 28 residues followed by a 32-kilodalton protein of 276 residues. The predicted sequence of mature LACI contains 18 cysteines and three potential N-linked glycosylation sites. The amino acid sequence analysis of purified LACI's NH2 terminus and two of its proteolytic fragments match exactly those deduced from the cDNA sequence, indicating that the cDNA codes for LACI. The translated amino acid sequence of LACI shows several discernible domains, including a highly negatively charged NH2 terminus, three tandem Kunitz-type inhibitory domains, and a highly positively charged carboxyl terminus. Northern blot analysis shows that the following liver-derived cell lines, Chang liver, HepG2 hepatoma, and SK hepatoma all, contain two major species of mRNA (1.4 and 4.4 kb) which hybridize with LACI cDNA."
https://openalex.org/W1970520842,"Spatially resolved measurements of intracellular free calcium and of the changes produced by excitatory amino acids were made in neurons isolated from adult mammalian brain. Extremely long-lasting (minutes) Ca2+ gradients were induced in the apical dendrites of hippocampal CA1 neurons after brief (1 to 3 seconds), local application of either glutamate or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). These gradients reflect the continuous flux of Ca2+ into the dendrite. The sustained gradients, but not the immediate transient response to the agonists, were prevented by prior treatment with the protein kinase C inhibitor sphingosine. Expression of the long-lasting Ca2+ gradients generally required a priming or conditioning stimulus with the excitatory agonist. The findings demonstrate a coupling between NMDA receptor activation and long-lasting intracellular Ca2+ elevation that could contribute to certain use-dependent modifications of synaptic responses in hippocampal CA1 neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2054753751,"The kinetics of calcium release by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) in permeabilized rat basophilic leukemia cells were studied to obtain insight into the molecular mechanism of action of this intracellular messenger of the phosphoinositide cascade. Calcium release from intracellular storage sites was monitored with fura-2, a fluorescent indicator. The dependence of the rate of calcium release on the concentration of added IP3 in the 4 to 40 nM range showed that channel opening requires the binding of at least three molecules of IP3. Channel opening occurred in the absence of added adenosine triphosphate, indicating that IP3 acts directly on the channel or on a protein that gates it. The channels were opened by IP3 in less than 4 seconds. The highly cooperative opening of calcium channels by nanomolar concentrations of IP3 enables cells to detect and amplify very small changes in the concentration of this messenger in response to hormonal, sensory, and growth control stimuli."

https://openalex.org/W2038354376,"Characterization of the host immune response to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is critical to the rational design of an effective AIDS vaccine. In this study, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) specific for HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RNA-dependent DNA polymerase) were found in blood samples from HIV-1-infected individuals. CTL targets were prepared by immortalizing B cells from ten seropositive and six seronegative individuals, and then infecting these cells with recombinant vaccinia viruses containing HIV-1 genes. CTL directed against autologous B lymphoblasts expressing HIV-1 reverse transcriptase were detected in fresh blood samples from eight HIV-1 seropositive subjects, but in no seronegative controls. The effector cells were identified as major histocompatibility complex-restricted CD3+CD8+ lymphocytes. Because the HIV-1 pol gene is highly conserved among different isolates and generates both humoral and cellular immune responses, it bears consideration for inclusion in a candidate AIDS vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W2140552959,"Interleukin 6 (IL-6; also referred to as interferon-beta 2, 26-kDa protein, and B cell stimulatory factor 2) is a cytokine whose actions include a stimulation of immunoglobulin synthesis, enhancement of B cell growth, and modulation of acute phase protein synthesis by hepatocytes. Synthesis of IL-6 is stimulated by interleukin 1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), or platelet-derived growth factor. We examined the role of the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent signal transduction pathway in IL-6 gene expression. Several activators of adenylate cyclase, including prostaglandin E1, forskolin, and cholera toxin, as well as the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine and the cAMP analog dibutyryl cAMP, shared the ability to cause a dramatic and sustained increase in IL-6 mRNA levels in human FS-4 fibroblasts. Actinomycin D treatment abolished this enhancement. Treatments that increased intracellular cAMP also stimulated the secretion of the IL-6 protein in a biologically active form. Increased intracellular cAMP appears to enhance IL-6 gene expression by a protein kinase C-independent mechanism because down-regulation of protein kinase C by a chronic exposure of cells to a high dose of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate did not abolish the enhancement of IL-6 expression by treatments that increase cAMP. IL-1 and TNF too increased IL-6 mRNA levels by a protein kinase C-independent mechanism. Our results suggest a role for the cAMP-dependent pathway(s) in IL-6 gene activation by TNF and IL-1."

https://openalex.org/W2129267739,"RNA editing is a novel type of mRNA processing in the kinetoplastid mitochondrion that involves the co- or posttranscriptional addition of uridine residues within transcripts. The result is an mRNA nucleotide sequence which differs from that of the corresponding gene. We have found that RNA editing may also occur through the deletion of genome-encoded uridines from the RNA sequence. Uridine additions and deletions in the 5' ends of the COIII, MURF2, and MURF3 transcripts create new N-terminal amino acid sequences that are conserved between species, and new AUG initiation codons in several cases. These results suggest that the creation of new amino acid sequences and methionine initiation codons may be important functions of RNA editing in the kinetoplastid mitochondrion."
https://openalex.org/W1559899671,"Each peptide bond CONH group in the most important COOH-terminal octapeptide region of [Leu14]bombesin was replaced by a CH2NH group using recently developed rapid solid-phase methods. The resulting analogues were then examined for amylase releasing activity in guinea pig pancreatic acini and for their ability to inhibit binding of [125I-Tyr4]bombesin to acinar cells. Replacement of the Trp8-Ala9, Gly11-His12, and His12-Leu13 peptide bonds resulted in about 1000-, 200-, and 300-fold losses in both amylase releasing activity and binding affinity. The Val10-Gly11 replacement, however, retained 30% potency relative to the parent peptide. Ala9-Val10 and Leu13-Leu14 bond replacement analogues exhibited no detectable amylase releasing activity but were still able to bind to acini with Kd values of 1060 and 60 nM, respectively (compared to 15 nM for [Leu14]bombesin itself). Subsequently, both analogues were demonstrated to be competitive inhibitors of bombesin-stimulated amylase release with IC50 values of 937 and 35 nM, respectively. [Leu14-psi-CH2NH-Leu13]Bombesin exhibits a 100-fold improvement in binding affinity compared to previously reported bombesin receptor antagonists and showed no affinity for substance P receptors. It was also a potent inhibitor of bombesin-stimulated growth of murine Swiss 3T3 cells with an IC50 of 18 nM. In terms of a bombesin receptor-binding conformation, these results may aid in the delineation of intramolecular hydrogen-bonding points and the eventual design of improved, conformationally restricted analogues."
https://openalex.org/W1574063311,"Mouse liver mRNA enriched in sequence coding for fatty acid synthase by sucrose density gradient centrifugation was used as template for cDNA synthesis. Double-stranded cDNA sequences were inserted into pBR322 and lambda gt10 and cloned. Clones containing putative cDNA sequences for fatty acid synthase were identified by differential hybridization with [32P] cDNAs synthesized from sucrose gradient-purified liver mRNA from mice fasted or fasted and refed a high carbohydrate diet. Thirteen out of 45 differentially expressed clones were found to contain sequences complementary to fatty acid synthase mRNA. Northern blot analysis revealed that, unlike in avian and rat tissues, a single 8.2-kilobase (kb) mRNA codes for fatty acid synthase in mice. In addition to the fatty acid synthase cDNA clones, cDNA clones to two specific mRNAs of 5.1 and 7.2 kb were selected to study nutritional, hormonal, and developmental regulation at the level of mRNA abundance in mouse liver and in 3T3-L1 cells. The induction of fatty acid synthase in the livers of previously fasted mice fed a high carbohydrate diet was controlled pretranslationally by modulation of the fatty acid synthase mRNA content. The level of the two mRNAs with sizes of 5.1 and 7.2 kb were also elevated dramatically in the liver of mice fasted and refed a high carbohydrate diet. A detectable, but very low level of fatty acid synthase mRNA was found in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. During the differentiation to adipocytes, both the rate of synthesis and relative mRNA level for fatty acid synthase increased in a parallel fashion to a maximum of 17-fold. The levels of 5.1- and 7.2-kb mRNAs, coding for proteins possibly involved in lipogenesis, increased 45- and 25-fold, respectively, during differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Treatment of mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes with insulin elicited a 3-fold increase in both rate of synthesis and mRNA content of fatty acid synthase, while treatment with dibutyryl cAMP caused a 60% decrease in fatty acid synthase mRNA and an 80% decrease in the rate of the enzyme synthesis, indicating pretranslational control of fatty acid synthase expression by the lipogenic and lipolytic hormones. Similarly, insulin caused a 2- to 3-fold increase in both 7.2- and 5.1-kb mRNAs and dibutyryl cAMP decreased the levels of 7.2- and 5.1-kb mRNAs to 10 and 20% of control levels, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W1520833254,"Human foreskin keratinocytes in culture produce 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25-(OH)2D3) and 24,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (24,25-(OH)2D3) from 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25-(OH)D3). The production of 1,25-(OH)2D3 by these cells correlated with the early events of differentiation such as expression of transglutaminase activity and the levels of a precursor protein for the cornified envelopes, involucrin. In contrast, the increased production of 24,25-(OH)2D3, as 1,25-(OH)2D3 production declined, correlated with the terminal differentiation marker, cornified envelope formation. Exogenous 1,25-(OH)2D3 (10(-11)-10(-9) M) inhibited the 1-alpha-hydroxylase at all stages of growth of these cells. Keratinocytes in culture expressed receptors for 1,25-(OH)2D3 which had similar sedimentation behavior in sucrose density gradients as chick intestinal cytosol receptors. Cells in early stages of growth (preconfluent and confluent) contained higher numbers of receptors (26-27 fmol/mg protein) than post-confluent cells. The dissociation constant (237-278 pM) of these receptors for 1,25-(OH)2D3 was not consistently altered by differentiation. Since 1,25-(OH)2D3 is a potent stimulator of cell differentiation in a variety of systems including the epidermis, our results suggest the possibility that endogenous 1,25-(OH)2D3 production may participate in the differentiation of keratinocytes in culture and, perhaps, in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1971659604,"Proteosomes are hydrophobic, membranous, multimolecular preparations of meningococcal outer membrane proteins that are also B cell mitogens. These characteristics suggested that proteosomes may serve as carrier proteins and adjuvants to enhance peptide immunogenicity. Although high titers of malaria circumsporozoite (CS) antibodies protect against malaria, vaccines thus far tested in humans have been insufficiently immunogenic to be clinically useful. Here it is shown that synthetic CS peptides hydrophobically complexed to proteosomes by way of lauroyl-cysteine become highly immunogenic in mice without other adjuvants. The high titers of antibodies produced and the safety of proteosomes in humans suggest that this novel system is widely applicable for the development of peptide vaccines to protect against many diseases."

https://openalex.org/W1684240761,"A panel of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies raised against human platelet GpIb or the GpIIb/IIIa complex were used to detect immunologically related molecules on two cell lines derived from human solid tumors. Human cervical carcinoma (MS751) and human colon carcinoma (clone A) expressed molecules immunologically related to platelet GpIb and GpIIb/IIIa complex. These molecules were localized to their plasma membranes by immunofluorescence and immunocytochemistry. The immunologically related GpIb was evenly distributed on the tumor cell membrane with occasional areas of aggregates, whereas the immunologically related GpIIb/IIIa had a pronounced punctate distribution of aggregates in prefixed cells. When MS751 or clone A cells were pretreated with antibodies against platelet GpIb and/or the GpIIb/IIIa complex, their ability to induce platelet aggregation was significantly inhibited. In addition, when tumor cells were pretreated with antibodies against the platelet IIb/IIIa complex, adherence to fibronectin-coated plates was also significantly inhibited. These results suggest a role for these immunologically related tumor cell glycoproteins in tumor cell-host cell (i.e., platelet, endothelial cells) interactions, tumor cell interactions with components of the subendothelial matrix, and subsequent tumor metastasis.—Grossi, I. M.; Hatfield, J. S.; Fitzgerald, L. A.; Newcombe, M.; Taylor, J. D.; Honn, K. V.

https://openalex.org/W2091404660,"Retinoblastoma, an intraocular tumor that occurs in children, has long been regarded, on the basis of morphological criteria, as a malignancy of the photoreceptor cell lineage. Here it is shown that when this tumor is grown in vitro, the cells express highly specialized photoreceptor cell genes. Transcripts for the transducin alpha subunit, TC alpha, which is specific to the cone cell, as well as transcripts for the red or green cone cell photopigment, were found in seven out of seven low-passage retinoblastoma cell lines. No marker genes specific to rod cell were expressed, suggesting that retinoblastoma has a cone cell lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2074357120,"Like insulin-sensitive somatic cells, stage IV oocytes from Xenopus laevis increase their synthesis of RNA, protein, and glycogen in response to extracellular insulin. Synthesis of RNA and protein are also increased when oocytes are maintained under paraffin oil and insulin is microinjected into the cytoplasm. The effects of external and intracellular insulin are additive, suggesting separate mechanisms of action. Experiments with nuclei isolated under oil show that RNA synthesis can be stimulated by applying insulin to the nucleus directly. Thus, the nucleus appears to be one intracellular site of hormone action."
https://openalex.org/W1520715517,"Two monoclonal antibodies (S-8G8 and S-6G7) are characterized that react with an abundant neuronal protein associated with brain clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs). This 185-kDa polypeptide (NP185) is not a transmembrane cargo molecule and is distinguishable from clathrin by several criteria including neuronal specificity, chymotryptic sensitivity, migration during two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, lack of cross-reactivity of S-8G8 or S-6G7 with purified clathrin, and lack of associated clathrin light chains. When 0.9 M NaCl extracts of CCVs were diluted and immunoprecipitated by either S-8G8 or S-6G7, NP185 precipitated as a complex with a fraction of the CCV assembly polypeptides. Immunofluorescence microscopy of PC12 cells cultured in nerve growth factor (NGF) revealed that NP185 was distributed in a punctate manner throughout the mature neurites. Immunoblot analysis of PC12 cell extracts, taken at various times during NGF-induced differentiation, revealed that steady-state accumulation of NP185 reaches significant levels 3 days after the addition of NGF and returns to undetectable levels when NGF is removed from the cultures. Significantly, the quantity of NP185 detected in differentiated PC12 cells exceeded the quantity of clathrin. These data indicate that while NP185 may be a specialized component of neuronal CCVs, its function in neuronal cells cannot be associated exclusively with these organelles."
https://openalex.org/W1534513394,"An activity gel analysis was performed in order to examine the catalytically active component of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reverse transcriptase in purified enzyme preparations and HIV-infected cell extracts. Immunoaffinity purified HIV reverse transcriptase contains two proteins with molecular weights 66,000 and 51,000 in approximately equal proportions. After denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and removal of sodium dodecyl sulfate, the p66 component of reverse transcriptase was sufficient for both DNA- and RNA-directed DNA synthesis. No DNA synthetic activity of p51 was observed. Recovery of p66 catalytic activity was approximately 10% that of DNA polymerase beta, and the density of the autoradiographic band corresponding to p66 was linear with enzyme concentration. No additional HIV-specific DNA polymerases besides p66 were observed in HIV-infected H9 cell extracts."
https://openalex.org/W1566238993,"Confluent cultured human lung fibroblasts were labeled with 35SO4(2-). After 48 h of labeling, the pericellular matrix was prepared by Triton X-100 and deoxycholate extraction of the monolayers. Heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) accounted for nearly 80% of the total matrix [35S]proteoglycans. After solubilization in 6 M guanidinium HCl and cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation, the majority (78%) of these [35S] HSPG equilibrated at an average buoyant density of 1.35 g/ml. This major HSPG fraction was purified by ion-exchange chromatography on Mono Q and by gel filtration on Sepharose CL-4B, and further characterized by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Intact [35S]HSPG eluted with Kav 0.1 from Sepharose CL-4B, whereas the protein-free [35S]heparan sulfate chains, obtained by alkaline borohydride treatment of the proteoglycan fractions, eluted with Kav 0.45 (Mr approximately 72,000). When analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography, core (protein) preparations, obtained by heparitinase digestion of 125I-labeled HSPG fractions, yielded one major labeled band with apparent molecular mass of approximately 300 kDa. Reduction with beta-mercaptoethanol slightly increased the apparent Mr of the labeled band, suggesting a single polypeptide structure and the presence of intrachain disulfide bonds. Immunoadsorption experiments and immunostaining of electrophoretically separated heparitinase-digested core proteins with monoclonal antibodies raised against matrix and cell surface-associated HSPG suggested that the major matrix-associated HSPG of cultured human lung fibroblasts is distinct from the HSPG that are anchored in the membranes of these cells. Binding studies suggested that this matrix HSPG interacts with several matrix components, both through its glycosaminoglycan chains and through its heparitinase-resistant core. Core (protein) interactions seem to be responsible for the association of the proteoglycan with the extracellular matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1556353137,"Large polylactosaminoglycans have only been observed linked to membrane proteins. To determine if membrane anchoring of a secretory protein might lead to the addition of polylactosaminoglycan, we have examined the carbohydrate structure on a membrane-anchored form of human chorionic gonadotropin-alpha subunit. This protein was generated by fusing the DNA encoding the human chorionic gonadotropin-alpha subunit to the DNA encoding the membrane-spanning and cytoplasmic domains of the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein. DNAs encoding this hybrid form and the secretory form of human chorionic gonadotropin-alpha were expressed in monkey COS-1 cells using an SV40-based vector. We show here that the parent secretory glycoprotein contains typical Asn-linked complex-type oligosaccharides while the membrane-bound form contains large, heterogenous polylactosaminoglycans. We conclude that membrane anchoring increases the accessibility of the N-linked glycans to the enzymes involved in polylactosamine addition. The inhibitor 1-deoxymannojirimycin blocks addition of the polylactosaminoglycan."
https://openalex.org/W1595123421,"Transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) alters the cellular response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) in a number of systems, but the underlying mechanisms for these alterations are largely unknown. We have examined second messenger formation in Rat-1 cells following treatment with EGF and/or TGF beta to determine whether the ability of TGF beta to potentiate some EGF-stimulated processes might be mediated by TGF beta-induced alterations in the signal transduction mechanism. Incubation of serum-deprived confluent Rat-1 cells with 10 ng/ml TGF beta resulted in a marked elevation of cellular inositol trisphosphate and inositol tetrakisphosphate levels, which were maximal at 4 h and maintained for at least 8 h. The effect of TGF beta on levels of inositol trisphosphate and inositol tetrakisphosphate was blocked by actinomycin D, suggesting that RNA synthesis was required for the TGF beta effect. While EGF stimulation induced a rapid and transient (5 min) rise in inositol phosphate levels in control cells, the EGF effect was considerably increased, both in magnitude and duration, by TGF beta treatment. Measurement of intracellular free Ca2+ with fura-2 demonstrated that TGF beta treatment markedly increased the EGF-stimulated rise in free Ca2+ and increased the duration of the response. The positive effects of TGF beta on EGF stimulation could not be explained on the basis of increased EGF binding to cells. We conclude that TGF beta treatment can both activate phosphatidylinositol turnover independently and also sensitize Rat-1 cells to stimulation by EGF."
https://openalex.org/W1850593990,"Spontaneously occurring autoantibody to threonyl-tRNA synthetase found in the serum of patients with polymyositis and experimentally induced antibody against highly purified rabbit reticulocyte threonyl-tRNA synthetase were used to analyze the epitopes of threonyl-tRNA synthetase. The PL-7 autoantibody reacted with the native but not the denatured form of threonyl-tRNA synthetase, whereas the experimentally induced antibody recognized both the native and denatured forms of the enzyme. In addition, the PL-7 autoantibody specifically inhibited threonyl-tRNA synthetase activity whereas the experimentally induced antibody had no effect on aminoacylation. Thus, the epitopes recognized by the PL-7 autoantibody are formed by the tertiary structure of the enzyme and are associated with the catalytic site of the synthetase whereas the experimentally induced antibody recognizes epitopes formed by primary sequences not related to the catalytic function of the synthetase.— Dang, C. V.; Tan, E. M.; Traugh, J. A. Myositis autoantibody reactivity and catalytic function of threonyl-tRNA synthetase. FASEB J. 2: 2376-2379; 1988."
https://openalex.org/W1494841619,"Monoclonal antibodies were raised against a conjugate between heparin oligosaccharides and human serum albumin. The oligosaccharides were prepared by partial nitrous acid degradation of heparin and were coupled to human serum albumin by reductive amination. Characterization of the antibodies secreted by one of the resulting clones showed that they recognize a determinant present in the oligosaccharide antigen, but not in intact heparin, nor in a variety of related polysaccharides. Degradation of heparin by nitrous acid generates a 2,5-anhydro-D-mannose residue at the reducing end of the resulting oligosaccharides, and it is concluded that this structure is essential for interaction with the antibodies. Reduced oligosaccharides (containing a terminal anhydromannitol residue) are also active. After gel chromatography of partially degraded heparin, the smallest components capable of binding to the antibodies were found in a tetrasaccharide fraction. Affinity chromatography on immobilized monoclonal antibodies separated this tetrasaccharide fraction into distinct populations of binding and nonbinding species. Structural analysis showed that the tetrasaccharide fraction that bound to the monoclonal antibodies contained one single component with the structure IdoA(2-OSO3)-GlcNSO3 (6-OSO3)-IdoA(2-OSO3)-aManR(6-OSO3), whereas the fraction that did not bind to the antibodies contained a mixture of different structures."
https://openalex.org/W146198015,"Conditions were developed for the long-term stabilization of Ca2+-ATPase in detergent-solubilized sarcoplasmic reticulum, purified Ca2+-ATPase, and purified-delipidated Ca2+-ATPase preparations. The standard storage medium contains 0.1 M KCl, 10 mM K-3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonate, pH 6.0, 3 mM MgCl2, 20 mM CaCl2, 20% glycerol, 3 mM NaN3, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 25 IU/ml Trasylol, 2 micrograms/ml 1,6-di-tert-butyl-p-cresol, 2 mg/ml protein, and 2-4 mg of detergent/mg of protein. Preparations stored under these conditions at 2 degrees C in a nitrogen atmosphere retain significant Ca2+-stimulated ATPase activity for periods of 5-6 months or longer when assayed in the presence of asolectin. The same conditions are also conducive for the formation of three-dimensional microcrystals of Ca2+-ATPase. Of the 49 detergents tested for solubilization, optimal crystallization of Ca2+-ATPase was obtained in sarcoplasmic reticulum solubilized with octaethylene glycol dodecyl ether at a detergent/protein weight ratio of 2, and with Brij 36T, Brij 56, and Brij 96 at a detergent/protein ratio of 4. Similar Ca2+-induced crystals of Ca2+-ATPase were obtained with purified or purified delipidated ATPase preparations at lower detergent/protein ratios. The stabilization of the ATPase activity in the presence of detergents is the combined effect of high Ca2+ (20 mM) and a relatively high glycerol concentration (20%). Ethylene glycol, glucose, sucrose, or myoinositol can substitute for glycerol with preservation of ATPase activity for several weeks in the presence of 20 mM Ca2+.Ca2+-induced association between ATPase molecules may be an essential requirement for preservation of enzymatic activity, both in intact sarcoplasmic reticulum and in solubilized preparations."
https://openalex.org/W1589399671,"The participation of terminal complement complexes (TCC) in demyelination has been shown in rodent cerebellar cultures. Since TCC modulates activities of various membrane-associated enzymes and increases the level of cellular Ca2+ we investigated whether TCC could activate Ca2+-dependent neutral proteases in myelin that would lead to hydrolysis of myelin basic protein (BP). Addition of antibody and C7-deficient serum plus C7 to sealed myelin vesicles of two to six bilayers caused significant BP hydrolysis compared to the hydrolysis caused by antibody and C7-deficient serum. Significant hydrolysis occurred at the stage of C5b6,7 assembly, which increased in magnitude at the C5b6-8 stage. C5b6-9 formation did not enhance the effect of C5b6-8. BP hydrolysis by C5b6,7 did not require Ca2+ whereas the effect of C5b6-8/C5b6-9 was, in part, Ca2+-dependent. We postulated that TCC formation in myelin membranes causes activation of myelin-associated neutral proteases with subsequent hydrolysis of BP as a consequence of complement peptide insertion and channel formation. Such processes may alter the structure of myelin and augment the action of other inflammatory cells and their products in demyelinating diseases that could ultimately lead to the loss of myelin."
https://openalex.org/W254711275,"Abstract Attempts to biochemically characterize the pancreatic cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor by affinity labeling have utilized either 125I-Bolton-Hunter-CCK-33 (long probes) or decapeptide analogues of the carboxyl terminus of CCK (short probes), and covalent attachment via the amino-terminal regions of these probes. The long probe has identified a protein of Mr = 80,000 while shorter probes, which have their site of cross-linking closer to the receptor binding region of the probes, have labeled a distinct protein of Mr = 85,000-95,000. To extend and complement these observations, we have designed and synthesized a new probe for the CCK receptor which incorporates a photolabile p-nitrophenylalanine moiety within the theoretical receptor-binding region of the hormone, as its carboxyl-terminal residue. This photoaffinity labeling probe has been shown to possess full biological activity, with potency and efficacy in stimulating amylase secretion by dispersed rat pancreatic acini similar to that of CCK-8 (CCK-26-33). When iodinated oxidatively, this probe binds rapidly, in a temperature-dependent, reversible, saturable, specific, high affinity manner to enriched pancreatic plasma membranes. In this work, we have used this probe to specifically label the CCK binding site on rat pancreatic plasma membranes. The Mr = 85,000-95,000 protein previously identified with amino-terminal cross-linking of short probes appears to be the protein labeled with this reagent as well. This provides strong evidence that this pancreatic plasma membrane protein contains the CCK-binding domain of the CCK receptor. This intrinsic photoaffinity labeling probe should be quite useful for the characterization of the active site of this receptor and for other CCK and gastrin receptors in many species."

https://openalex.org/W1573619711,"A murine monoclonal antibody (designated H-11) produced by injecting mice with purified human protein C was found to bind several human vitamin K-dependent proteins. Using a solid-phase competitive radioimmunoassay with antibody immobilized onto microtiter plates, binding of 125I-labeled protein C to the antibody was inhibited by increasing amounts of protein C, prothrombin, and Factors X and VII over a concentration range of 1 X 10(-8) to 1 X 10(-6) M. Other vitamin K-dependent proteins including Factor IX and protein S did not inhibit or inhibited only at the highest concentration binding of radiolabeled protein C to the immobilized antibody. Chemical treatment of prothrombin with a variety of agents including denaturation by sodium dodecyl sulfate, reduction with mercaptoethanol followed by carboxymethylation with iodoacetic acid, citraconylation of lysine residues, removal of metal ion with EDTA, or heat decarboxylation did not destroy the antigenic site recognized by the antibody as measured by immunoblotting of prothrombin or prothrombin derivative immobilized onto nitrocellulose. Immunoblotting of purified vitamin K-dependent polypeptides with the monoclonal antibody following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose indicated that the antigenic site was found on the light chains of protein C and Factor X. Chymotrypsin digestion of prothrombin and isolation on QAE-Sephadex of the peptide representing amino-terminal residues 1-44 of prothrombin further localized the antigenic site recognized by the monoclonal antibody to the highly conserved gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-containing domain. The exact location of the antigenic determinant for antibody H-11 was established using synthetic peptides. Antibody H-11 bound specifically to synthetic peptides corresponding to residues 1-12 of Factor VII and 1-22 of protein C. Comparison of protein sequences of bovine and human vitamin K-dependent proteins suggests that the sequence Phe-Leu-Glu-Glu-Xaa-Arg/Lys is required for antibody binding. The glutamic acid residues in this peptide segment are the first 2 gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues near the amino-terminal end in the native proteins. Increasing concentrations of Ca2+, Mg2+, or Mn2+ partially inhibited binding of 125I-protein C to the antibody in a solid-phase assay system with half-maximal binding observed at divalent metal ion concentrations of 2, 4, and 0.6 mM, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1485435833,"A methyltransferase, which utilizes 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (HAA) as a substrate, has been purified to near homogeneity from 30-36-h mycelium of the bacterium Streptomyces antibioticus. The enzyme was obtained in approximately 20% yield with a purification of 130-fold. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions indicates that the enzyme is composed of a single subunit with Mr of about 36,000. On chromatography in 0.5 M NaCl, the enzyme displays a molecular weight of about 37,000. The specific activity of the enzyme in S. antibioticus mycelium is maximal between 30 and 36 h following inoculation of galactose/glutamic acid medium and, at those times post-inoculation, the specific activity is essentially the same in extracts of mycelium obtained from cultures grown on glucose rather than galactose as the carbon source. The enzyme activity is stimulated by Na2EDTA (in crude extracts) and by 2-mercaptoethanol and the methyltransferase shows a strong preference for HAA as substrate as compared with a number of HAA analogs. Thin layer chromatography of ethyl acetate extracts of large-scale incubation mixtures confirms that the product of the reaction is 4-methyl-3-hydroxyanthranilic acid. The reaction product was also a substrate for phenoxazinone synthase and was incorporated into actinomycin by S. antibioticus mycelium. Kinetic parameters for the methyltransferase reaction was determined."
https://openalex.org/W1534547931,"Apolipoprotein B (apo B) phosphorylation was examined in primary cultures of hepatocytes from control and nonketotic streptozotocin diabetic rats. Following a 5-h incubation with ortho[32P]phosphate, media lipoproteins (d less than 1.063 g/ml) were isolated, and delipidated apolipoproteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGGE), and gels were heat fixed. Autoradiographic bands corresponding to high (apo BH) and low molecular weight apo B (apo BL) were observed in media lipoproteins isolated from control rats, and these bands were more prominent in media lipoproteins isolated from diabetic rats. Apo B-specific activity was estimated from aqueous alcohol-precipitated radioactivity and apo B monoclonal immunoassay of isolated media lipoproteins. In lipoproteins secreted by hepatocytes of diabetic rats, the calculated apo B specific activity was between 18- and 31-fold greater than that secreted by hepatocytes of control rats, consistent with the SDS-PAGGE gel data. The increase in secretory 32P-labeled apo B from hepatocytes of diabetic rats was due, at least in part, to an increase in labeled phospho-tyrosine as determined by phosphoamino acid analysis. These data demonstrate that apo BH may be secreted as a phosphorylated protein and that apo B phosphorylation occurs on tyrosine as well as serine residues."
https://openalex.org/W1573499703,"Abstract To identify the promoter sequence(s) of the CG beta gene, genomic fragments derived from a cosmid containing the CG beta gene family were transfected into mouse Y1 adrenal cortical cells. Using this system, we showed that the CG beta genes 5, 3, and 8 have functional promoters, the basal element of which in the case of CG beta 5, was within 78 base pairs 5' ward from the CAP site. The size of the CG beta transcripts and identity of the transcription start site was the same for CG beta mRNA synthesized in Y1 cells as in first trimester placenta. The promoter region identified by this system was also capable of driving the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene when transfected stably into choriocarcinoma cells. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs bearing variable length of 5'-flanking sequences from CG beta 5 and transfected into trophoblast cells suggest the presence of regulatory sequences within 700 base pairs from the CAP site. The information obtained here provide a foundation for studies of analyzing trans-acting placental and pituitary proteins to the defined CG beta promoter region."
https://openalex.org/W1553746895,"We carried out experiments designed to generate a novel cell-surface protein from a small glycosylated secretory protein. DNA encoding the entire precursor of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG, alpha subunit) was fused precisely to DNA encoding the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein. When expressed in animal cells this DNA encoded the 92-amino acid hCG-alpha subunit anchored in cellular membranes by an extension composed of the 49 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein. This hybrid protein was transported efficiently to the plasma membrane of animal cells. The two asparagine-linked glycans on the anchored form of hCG-alpha were large and heterogeneous when compared to those on the secretory form. Experiments employing in vitro mutagenesis and the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin established that the presence of at least one of the two asparagine-linked glycans was required for expression of the anchored molecule on the cell surface. However, as reported previously, secretion of hCG-alpha occurred in the absence of glycosylation. Also, mutations eliminating the second glycosylation site (at amino acid 78) in both the anchored or secreted forms apparently led to partial denaturation or a conformational change interfering with transport of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1590458497,"Previously we isolated a cDNA clone which encoded the carboxyl-terminal portion of the rat link protein (Doege, K., Hassell, J.R., Caterson, B., and Yamada, Y. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 83, 3761-3765). Here we report the isolation of cDNA clones encoding the remainder of the protein. Sequence analysis revealed two classes of cDNA clones identical except for the occurrence of an additional internal nucleotide segment of 159 base pairs coding for 53 amino acids in one of the clones. Genomic clones were then isolated using the cDNA as a probe. Sequence analysis of genomic clones revealed that the internal 159-base pair cDNA segment was contained in a single exon. The protein sequence deduced from these two cDNAs were Mr = 44,779 (link 45) and Mr = 38,570 (link 39). Northern blotting of chondrosarcoma RNA revealed that both the alternate exon specific to link 45 and an exon common to both link 45 and 39 hybridized to the same size classes of link protein transcripts (1.5-5.5 kilobases), although link 45 transcripts are much less prevalent than link 39 transcripts. The link 39 sequence corresponds exactly with the predominant form of chondrosarcoma link protein. The similarity in size between link 45 and the larger form of link protein (LP1) observed in other species appears fortuitous."
https://openalex.org/W1674837479,"Methotrexate-induced gene amplification increased the expression of biologically active bovine luteinizing hormone (bLH) approximately 11-fold after stable transfection of a line of Chinese hamster ovary cells with genes encoding dihydrofolate reductase and the alpha and beta subunits of bLH. Subsequent analysis of the bovine genes revealed that while the alpha gene was amplified in response to methotrexate selection, the LH beta subunit gene remained unaffected. This effect was probably due to the linkage of the alpha subunit gene with the dihydrofolate reductase gene, the selectable and methotrexate-sensitive marker in the plasmid construct. Prior to methotrexate selection, the concentration of LH beta mRNA and the rate of LH beta synthesis exceeded that of alpha subunit mRNA and protein. Stepwise selection with methotrexate led to a progressive increase in the synthesis and secretion of biologically active bLH. Enhanced production of bLH correlated directly with similar increases in both the steady-state level of alpha subunit mRNA and the relative synthesis rate of alpha subunit protein. Despite progressive changes in alpha subunit concentration, formation of the alpha/beta heterodimer was always incomplete, even when the concentration of alpha subunit exceeded that of LH beta. Cumulatively, these results are consistent with a model in which the extent of steady-state combination of the subunits is determined by the mutual affinity and concentration of both subunits within the lumen of the secretory pathway. This stands in contrast to the long held view that the extent of glycoprotein hormone assembly is limited by the concentration of the beta subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1530734825,"Digestion of human alpha 2-macroglobulin-methylamine (alpha 2M-CH3NH2) with papain prior to gel filtration resulted in the resolution of three distinct peaks. The material in peak I (Mr approximately 600,000) and peak II (Mr approximately 55,000) did not have any receptor binding ability as determined by in vivo clearance studies and in vitro competitive binding studies using mouse peritoneal macrophages. In contrast, the material in peak III (Mr approximately 20,000) bound to macrophage alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) receptors with a Kd of 250 nM. This represents a 500-fold decrease in affinity relative to undigested alpha 2M-CH3NH2. Sequence analysis demonstrated that this material constituted the carboxyl-terminal fragment (COOH-terminal fragment) of alpha 2M. alpha 2M is known to possess a methionyl residue which is susceptible to modification by cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum (II) (cis-DDP) with the result being a loss of receptor binding ability by alpha 2M. For this reason, experiments were performed to determine if the platinum-reactive methionyl residue is located in the COOH-terminal receptor binding fragment of alpha 2M. The results of this investigation demonstrate that cis-DDP is not reactive with either the isolated COOH-terminal fragment or the COOH-terminal fragment isolated from alpha 2M-CH3NH2 which had been pretreated with cis-DDP. In addition, the COOH-terminal fragment did not bind to monoclonal antibody 7H11D6, a monoclonal antibody which binds to the platinum-reactive epitope of the alpha 2M-CH3NH2 receptor recognition site. In contrast, the 55-kDa fragment of alpha 2M bound approximately 1 mol platinum/mol of 55-kDa fragment and also bound to monoclonal antibody 7H11D6. Since the COOH-terminal fragment retains some receptor binding ability, the results of this investigation demonstrate that this fragment is not the complete receptor recognition site and suggest that a platinum-reactive methionyl residue located in the 55-kDa fragment of alpha 2M is another component of this site."
https://openalex.org/W1483575784,"In order to study the molecular basis for the functional localization and behavioral control of sperm, we have partially characterized plasma membranes prepared from isolated head and tail fractions. These membranes have similar amounts of the Na+ pump (as reflected by (Na+,K+)-ATPase activity), whereas they differ in protein composition, binding sites for Ca2+ channel antagonists, and in the localization of enzymes of cyclic nucleotide metabolism. The Ca2+ channel antagonist D600 (and related phenylalkylamines) binds to plasma membrane preparations from sperm heads and tails with much higher affinity than do the dihydropyridine antagonists. This binding is inhibited greatly by certain monovalent (but not divalent) ions, especially Na+, Tris+, glycine ethyl ester+, and methylamine+.K+,Li+, and choline+ are less effective. In media of ionic composition resembling seawater, sperm tail membranes exhibit 6.5-fold more binding sites for D600 than do membranes from sperm head. cGMP phosphodiesterase and adenylate cyclase are also enriched in plasma membranes from the tail. Thus, the highly polarized sperm cell exhibits a regional differentiation of plasma membrane proteins implicated in behavioral control."
https://openalex.org/W1675400023,"Studies were performed to determine if monoclonal antibody 7H11D6 binds to the region of alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) that interacts with cell-surface receptors. F(ab')2 fragments prepared from this antibody delayed the in vivo clearance of alpha 2M-trypsin complexes from the murine circulation and blocked the in vitro binding of 125I-labeled alpha 2M-trypsin to rat kidney fibroblasts. Chemical modification studies revealed that the epitope region for 7H11D6 is sensitive to modification of the inhibitor with cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum (II). To determine if the epitope for 7H11D6 is comprised of residues involved in the alpha 2M receptor determinant, anti-idiotypic antibodies against 7H11D6 were prepared. A competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrated that the anti-idiotypic IgG competed with alpha 2M-trypsin complexes for binding to 7H11D6. The anti-idiotypic IgG inhibited the binding of 125I-labeled alpha 2M-trypsin complexes to normal rat kidney fibroblasts, and a Kd of 194 pM for the binding of the anti-idiotype to these cells was derived from a fit of the data to a model involving a single class of sites. Binding of the anti-idiotypic IgG to the alpha 2M receptor provides unequivocal evidence that 7H11D6 is binding to residues within the receptor recognition site on alpha 2M and not merely to residues sufficiently close to that region to cause steric hindrance."
https://openalex.org/W1488004577,"The complete amino acid sequence of PepM49, a peptic fragment of the group A streptococcal type 49 M protein, the antiphagocytic cell surface molecule of the bacteria, is described. This fragment retains the opsonic antibody epitope of the native molecule. The sequence of PepM49, as determined by automated Edman degradations of the uncleaved molecule, and its tryptic and chymotryptic peptides, consists of a total of 143 residues (Mr = 17,187). PepM49, a nephritis-associated M protein serotype, exhibits significant internal homology in its sequence. However, identical sequence repeats of the kind seen in the rheumatic fever-associated serotypes M5, M6, and M24, are absent in PepM49. PepM49 exhibits varying degrees of homology with the M5, M6, and M24 proteins, which is consistent with the existence of variable and conserved regions in the M protein molecule. Predictive analysis as well as CD measurements revealed a high propensity of the PepM49 molecule to assume an alpha-helical conformation. Furthermore, a heptad periodicity of the nonpolar residues, a characteristic of alpha-helical coiled-coil proteins, extends over the entire length of the PepM49 protein. The differences in the nonpolar residue distribution divide the PepM49 sequence into three distinct domains, similar to those seen earlier in the M5 and M6 proteins. Together, these studies establish a conserved conformational design for the sequentially diverse M protein serotypes. However, the pattern of heptad periodicity in the PepM49 protein is quite distinct from that present in the PepM5 and M6 proteins, suggesting distinct differences in structural features among conformationally similar M protein serotypes. This may have relevance to the pathological differences associated with these M protein serotypes."

https://openalex.org/W1499460414,"Effects of the arginyl- and lysyl-specific reagent phenylglyoxal (PGO) on the epithelial Na+ channel were evaluated by measuring the amiloride-blockable 22Na+ fluxes in membrane vesicles derived from the toad bladder epithelium. Incubating whole cells or isolated membranes with PGO readily and irreversibly blocked the channel-mediated tracer flux. Na+ ions present during the interaction of membranes with PGO could protect channels from inactivation by PGO. This effect required the presence of Na+ at the luminal side of the membrane and was characterized by an IC50 of 79 mM Na+. Amiloride, too, could desensitize channels to PGO, but its effect was significant only when whole cells were interacted with the protein-modifying reagent. The data are compatible with a model in which the conductive path of the channel contains a functional arginine, possibly forming a salt bridge with a carboxylic group, which is involved in Na+ translocation and amiloride binding. It was also shown that the augmentation of transport induced by incubating whole cells in Ca2+-free solution (Garty, H., and Asher, C. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 8330-8335) involves the activation or recruitment of channels that are not vulnerable to PGO prior to incubation."
