https://openalex.org/W2015519364,"The ability of p53 to activate transcription from specific sequences suggests that genes induced by p53 may mediate its biological role as a tumor suppressor. Using a subtractive hybridization approach, we identified a gene, named WAF1, whose induction was associated with wild-type but not mutant p53 gene expression in a human brain tumor cell line. The WAF1 gene was localized to chromosome 6p21.2, and its sequence, structure, and activation by p53 was conserved in rodents. Introduction of WAF1 cDNA suppressed the growth of human brain, lung, and colon tumor cells in culture. Using a yeast enhancer trap, a p53-binding site was identified 2.4 kb upstream of WAF1 coding sequences. The WAF1 promoter, including this p53-binding site, conferred p53-dependent inducibility upon a heterologous reporter gene. These studies define a gene whose expression is directly induced by p53 and that could be an important mediator of p53-dependent tumor growth suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2089218510,"The cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2 associates with cyclins A, D, and E and has been implicated in the control of the G1 to S phase transition in mammals. To identify potential Cdk2 regulators, we have employed an improved two-hybrid system to isolate human genes encoding Cdk-interacting proteins (Cips). CIP1 encodes a novel 21 kd protein that is found in cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and Cdk2 immunoprecipitates. p21CIP1 is a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of Cdks and can inhibit the phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin A-Cdk2, cyclin E-Cdk2, cyclin D1-Cdk4, and cyclin D2-Cdk4 complexes. Cotransfection experiments indicate that CIP1 and SV40 T antigen function in a mutually antagonistic manner to control cell cycle progression."
https://openalex.org/W1988756673,"Accumulation of p53 protein was seen in the nuclei of mammalian cells following DNA damage caused by ultraviolet radiation (UV), X-ray, or a restriction enzyme. Promoters containing p53-binding sites show a dramatic transcriptional response to DNA damage. The p53 response to X-ray is rapid, reaching a peak at 2 hr after radiation, but is very transitory and reduced in magnitude compared with that seen in response to UV. We find no substantive defect in the p53 response of cells from ataxia telangiectasia or xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group A patients. In contrast, 2 out of 11 primary cultures from Bloom's patients showed a complete absence of p53 accumulation following UV irradiation or SV40 infection and a grossly delayed and aberrant response following X-ray."
https://openalex.org/W1568609804,"One of the major secreted proteins of human articular chondrocytes in monolayer or explant culture and of synovial fibroblasts is a glycoprotein with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 39,000, referred to as human cartilage glycoprotein-39 (HC gp-39). The protein was purified, and its complete cDNA sequence was determined. It contained an open reading frame coding for a 383-amino acid long peptide. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with known sequences revealed that HC gp-39 contained regions displaying significant homology with a group of bacterial and fungal chitinases and a similar enzyme found in the nematode, Brugia malayi. In addition significant homologies were observed with three mammalian secretory proteins of as yet unknown function, suggesting that a related protein family exists in mammals. The human protein does not possess any glycosidic activity against chitinase substrates, arguing against any function as an endoglycosidase with specificity for N-acetylglucosamine. Analysis by Northern blotting and by reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction showed mRNA for HC gp-39 to be present in human articular chondrocytes as well is in liver, while mRNA was undetectable in muscle tissues, lung, pancreas, mononuclear cells, or fibroblasts. Neither the protein nor mRNA for HC gp-39 was detectable in normal newborn or adult human articular cartilage obtained at surgery, while mRNA for HC gp-39 was detectable both in synovial specimens and in cartilage obtained from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. These observations suggest that the expression of HC gp-39 may be related to a response of these cells to an altered tissue environment."
https://openalex.org/W1976220823,"The ubiquitously expressed c-Abl tyrosine kinase is localized to the nucleus and binds to DNA. The DNA binding activity is regulated by cdc2-mediated phosphorylation, suggesting a cell cycle function for c-Abl. Here we show that the tyrosine kinase activity of nuclear c-Abl is regulated in the cell cycle through a specific interaction with the retinoblastoma protein (RB). A domain in the C-terminus of RB, outside of the A/B pocket, binds to the ATP-binding lobe of the c-Abl tyrosine kinase, resulting in kinase inhibition. The RB-c-Abl interaction is not affected by the viral oncoproteins that bind to RB. Hyperphosphorylation of RB correlates with release of c-Abl and activation of the tyrosine kinase in S phase cells. The nuclear c-Abl tyrosine kinase can enhance transcription, and this activity is inhibited by RB. Nuclear c-Abl is an S phase-activated tyrosine kinase that may participate directly in the regulation of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1546629881,"Interleukin 8 (IL-8) is a recently described cytokine that functions as a potent neutrophil chemoattractant and activator. We sought to examine the link between the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) and the regulation of IL-8 gene expression to specifically test the hypothesis that ROI would induce production of IL-8 mRNA and protein. In lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human whole blood, the OH radical scavenger dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) dramatically inhibited (approximately 90%) IL-8 production, but had minimal effects on the production of tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 1 beta (IL-1), and IL-6. To determine whether NADPH-oxidase-generated free radicals were critical in the regulation of IL-8, studies were performed using blood from patients with chronic granulomatous disease. In both normal individuals and patients with chronic granulomatous disease, production of IL-8 could be initiated with lipopolysaccharide, phytohemagglutinin, or aggregated immune complexes, and this production could be inhibited by Me2SO (1% v/v). To examine if oxidant stress represents a ubiquitous mechanism for the induction of IL-8, experiments were performed in cultured cell lines. In the human hepatoma cell line Hep-G2, Me2SO dose-dependently inhibited tumor necrosis factor-stimulated IL-8 production, with a 74 +/- 1% reduction observed at a Me2SO concentration of 1%. Direct exposure to ROI demonstrated that H2O2 stimulated IL-8 production in a dose-dependent manner in Hep-G2 cells, A549 pulmonary type II epithelial cells, and human skin fibroblasts; this induction could be prevented by addition of catalase. The production of IL-8 appeared to be specific to an oxidant stress since exposure of the cells to heat shock or chemical stress did not induce expression of IL-8. These studies demonstrate that oxidant stress is an important regulator of IL-8 gene expression and support the hypothesis that low levels of ROI may serve to initiate IL-8 production which then serves to recruit neutrophils to sites of inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1530865401,"Fetal tau and tau in paired helical filaments show similar immunoreactivities with several phosphorylation-dependent paired helical filament-polyclonals and monoclonals, suggesting that the two molecules share several distinct phosphorylated epitopes. To make clear the similarities and differences between the two, we have undertaken work to identify the in vivo phosphorylation sites in fetal rat tau. We have approached this problem by identifying phosphopeptides by means of mass spectrometry and sequencing of those phosphopeptides after modification with ethanethiol. Although remarkable heterogeneity was present, fetal tau was found to bear at most 10 phosphates at Ser-189, Ser-190, Ser-193, Ser-226, Ser-387, Ser-395, Thr-172, Thr-222, and, presumably, Ser-391 and Thr-208 (numbering is according to the longest form of rat tau; Kosik, K. S., Orecchio, L. D., Bakalis, S., and Neve, R. L. (1989) Neuron 2, 1389-1397). In contrast, adult rat tau was much less phosphorylated; only Thr-172, Ser-190, Ser-193, Thr-222, and Ser-395 were phosphorylated to a slight-to-moderate extent. All these sites except for Ser-189 and Ser-391 were followed by Pro residues. Thus, tau is an in vivo substrate for proline-directed protein kinase(s), and its phosphorylation state is developmentally regulated."
https://openalex.org/W1493575659,"We describe a serine phosphorylation of the putative metastasis suppressor protein Nm23, and present evidence of its relevance to the signal transduction and tumor metastatic processes. Nm23 was previously demonstrated to exhibit nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) activity, which transfers a phosphate among nucleoside tri- and diphosphates via an Nm23-phospho-histidine intermediate. Recent data have dissociated the NDPK activity of Nm23 from its phenotypic effects; therefore we have asked whether Nm23 possesses additional biochemical functions. An acid-stable (nonhistidine) phosphorylation was identified on autophosphorylated purified recombinant Nm23 proteins and [32P]orthophosphate-labeled human breast carcinoma and murine melanoma Nm23. Phosphoamino acid analysis identified serine as the acid-stable phosphorylation and serine 44 as the major site of phosphorylation. The acid stable phosphorylation (serine) of Nm23 was inhibited by cAMP in vitro and forskolin in vivo, suggesting that this phosphorylation pathway is regulated in signal transduction. No effect of cAMP was observed on Nm23 NDPK activity. Once phosphorylated, Nm23-phosphoserine can release free phosphate in vitro. The biological relevance of the novel phosphorylation identified herein is suggested by the direct correlation of in vivo Nm23 acid-stable phosphorylation levels, but not Nm23 NDPK activity, with suppression of tumor metastatic potential among control and nm23-1 transfected murine melanoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W1512960324,"To understand the mechanisms by which large increases in serum amyloid A (SAA) occur during the acute phase response, human hepatoma cells were transfected with SAA2 gene reporter plasmids and stimulated with combinations of cytokines. Although interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) stimulated transcription from this promoter individually, addition of both mediators produced a response between two and nine times greater than the expected additive response. This synergistic activation was dependent on the integrity of at least two cis-acting sequences in the SAA2 enhancer. The SAA2 NF-kappa B site was required functionally for the response to both IL-1 and IL-6 alone as well as for synergistic activation; however, IL-6 did not directly induce binding of nuclear proteins to the NF-kappa B sequence. A NF-IL6 site was required for full induction by IL-1 and IL-6, and also mediated strong transactivation by recombinant NF-IL6. Furthermore, transfected NF-IL6 synergized strongly with co-transfected NF-kappa B, particularly with RelA (p65). However synergy between IL-1 and IL-6 was only partly reduced by mutation of the NF-IL6 site, indicating further levels of interaction in addition to the NF-kappa B/NF-IL6 cooperativity."
https://openalex.org/W1482776146,"Regulation of mRNA levels for the constitutive and inducible prostaglandin endoperoxide synthases, PGHS-1 and PGHS-2, was examined in murine osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. Serum induction of PGHS-2 mRNA levels was rapid, transient, increased by cycloheximide, and inhibited 72% by cortisol. The cortisol inhibition was blocked by cycloheximide. Serum stimulation of PGHS-1 mRNA was slower, decreased by cycloheximide, and inhibited 28% by cortisol. Increased prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production and induction of PGHS-2 immunoreactive protein paralleled changes in PGHS-2 mRNA. PGHS-2 mRNA was induced at 2 h in serum-free cells by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and, to a lesser extent, by forskolin. The combination of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and forskolin was synergistic. TGF-beta induction was prolonged compared with serum, inhibited 67% by cortisol, and the inhibition was not blocked by cycloheximide. TGF-alpha had little effect on PGHS-2 mRNA at 2 h, but the combination of TGF-beta and TGF-alpha was synergistic for PGHS-1 and PGHS-2. PGE2 itself induced PGHS-2 mRNA, and inhibition of PGE2 production decreased the serum induction by 55%, suggesting an important role for autoamplification. The rapidity and amplitude of changes in PGHS-2 suggest that it may be involved in bone responses to acute stresses, such as mechanical strain, inflammation, and injury."
https://openalex.org/W1578170165,"The primary structure and functional expression of the rat Na/H exchanger (NHE) NHE-2 isoform has recently been reported (Wang, Z., Orlowski, J., and Shull, G. E. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 11925-11928). To further characterize some of its functional properties, biochemical and pharmacological analyses were performed on exchanger-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells (AP-1) that had been stably transfected with a full-length NHE-2 cDNA. Transport activity for NHE-2 was assayed by measuring amiloride-inhibitable 22Na+ influx following an acute intracellular acid load. Pharmacological analyses revealed that NHE-2 had a relatively high affinity for amiloride and some of its analogues. The most potent analogue was 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (EIPA) (K0.5 = 79 nM), followed by 5-(N,N-dimethyl)amiloride (DMA) (K0.5 = 250 nM), amiloride (K0.5 = 1.4 microM), and benzamil (K0.5 = 320 microM). Nonamiloride compounds known to inhibit the activity of other Na/H exchanger isoforms also inhibited NHE-2 with the following order of potency: clonidine (K0.5 = 42 microM) > harmaline (K0.5 = 330 microM) approximately cimetidine (K0.5 = 330 microM). Biochemical analyses showed that the extracellular Na+ dependence of NHE-2 followed simple, saturating Michaelis-Menten kinetics with an apparent affinity constant for Na+ (KNa) of 50 mM. In contrast, intracellular H+ appeared to activate NHE-2 by a positive cooperative mechanism with an apparent half-maximal activation value of pK 6.90. Other cations, such as extracellular Li+ and H+, acted as competitive inhibitors of 22Na+ influx by NHE-2, with apparent Ki values of 3.0 mM and 10 nM, respectively. In contrast, extracellular K+ had no effect on the transport activity of NHE-2. These results indicated that the rat NHE-2 cDNA encodes a functional Na/H exchanger isoform with distinct properties compared to rat NHE-1 and -3."
https://openalex.org/W1557173787,"An arginine-specific mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase is expressed on the surface of differentiated mouse skeletal muscle cells and is anchored in the membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol tail. Following incubation of intact cells with [adenylate-32P]NAD and analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), a 97-kDa [32P]ADP-ribosylated protein was observed under reducing conditions and a 140-kDa complex under nonreducing conditions. The ADP-ribosylated protein was purified on a laminin affinity column. Based on its N-terminal sequence (FNLDVM-GAIRKEGEPGSLFGF) and a partial internal sequence (GLMRSEELSFVAGAP), the modified protein was identified as integrin alpha 7. Following partial trypsin digestion, a 39-kDa/79-kDa radiolabeled fragment was produced (reduced/nonreduced SDS-PAGE), narrowing the ADP-ribosylation site to a 39-kDa segment in the extracellular domain of integrin alpha 7. Labeling under optimal conditions was at least 0.4 mol of ADP-ribose/mol of integrin alpha 7. Selective expression of both ADP-ribosyltransferase and integrin alpha 7 in cardiac and skeletal muscle, a similar developmental appearance, and the apparently specific ADP-ribosylation, are consistent with a regulatory association between these proteins. ADP-ribosylation may modulate integrin receptor signaling and could play a significant role in the regulation of muscle cell function by the extracellular matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1566025335,"The enzyme phytoene synthase (Psy) catalyzes the formation of phytoene, an intermediate in the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway. Expression of a previously described gene (PSY1) is induced by fruit ripening in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum). We describe here the cloning of a partial cDNA for PSY2, a gene related to PSY1. A plasmid containing the PSY2 coding region under control of a bacterial promoter complements a Rhodobacter capsulatus phytoene synthase mutant, indicating that this gene has the capacity to encode an active enzyme. We used reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction followed by digestion with a restriction enzyme to determine that both PSY1 and PSY2 are expressed during tomato development. PSY1 transcripts predominate in seedlings and in late stages of fruit ripening, whereas PSY2 transcripts are relatively more abundant in mature leaves. Both genes are expressed under photooxidative conditions induced by treatment with the carotenoid biosynthesis inhibitor Norflurazon. We used polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphisms and alien addition lines to map PSY2 to chromosome 2. We conclude that PSY2 is a second tomato gene encoding phytoene synthase."
https://openalex.org/W1553267416,"A transcription factor that stimulates synthesis of accurately initiated transcripts by RNA polymerase II has been identified and purified to apparent homogeneity from rat liver nuclear extracts. This factor, which we designate SIII, has a native molecular mass of approximately 140 kDa and is composed of three polypeptides of 110, 18, and 15 kDa. All three polypeptides are required to reconstitute SIII transcriptional activity. SIII appears distinct from previously identified mammalian transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W1854102429,"The turnover in vivo of the Photosystem II (PS II) reaction center D1 protein was investigated by [35S] methionine labeling of leaf discs of Brassica napus and subsequent analysis after thylakoid SDS-gel electrophoresis. The rate of D1 protein degradation was found to have a t1/2 of approximately 2 h, at an irradiance corresponding to the growth irradiance. The rate of D1 protein degradation was not increased further by prior photoinhibitory treatment which inactivated 40% of the PS II centers, but the amount of [35S]methionine label incorporated into the D1 protein during 1 h was increased 3-fold. Whether photoinhibited or not, the incorporation of label into the D1 protein increased with irradiance only up to approximately the growth irradiance and above that it decreased with increasing incident light. These data indicate that a high rate of D1 protein degradation occurs not only after photoinhibition but also under conditions where no net decrease in the number of functional PS II centers occurs and that the number of PS II centers that undergo D1 protein turnover varies depending on prior photoinhibitory damage and on incident irradiance. A down-regulation of PS II in leaves at high irradiances is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1526677948,"Structural models of human aldose reductase complexed with NADPH have revealed the apposition of C4 of the nicotinamide ring with tyrosine 48 and histidine 110, suggesting that either of these residues could function as the proton donor in the reaction mechanism. Tyrosine 48 is also part of a hydrogen-bonding network that includes lysine 77 and aspartate 43. In order to study the potential catalytic roles of these 4 residues, we evaluated the kinetic properties of mutants containing structurally conservative replacements at these sites. Enzymatic activity was undetectable when Tyr-48 was mutated to phenylalanine (Y48F) although affinity for NADPH was unchanged. In contrast, a mutant containing asparagine substituted for His-110 (H110N) was characterized by an almost 80,000-fold increase in Km, but only about a 14-fold reduction in kcat measured with D-glyceraldehyde. Modest changes in catalytic properties were observed in the mutant containing aspartate 43 substituted with asparagine (D43N): Km for aldehyde substrates was elevated up to 17-fold, and kcat decreased less than 16-fold. However, the Kd(NADP) values for D43N were about 5 times higher than those for wild type. Mutant enzyme containing methionine substituted for lysine 77 (K77M) was up to 1,460-fold less active than the wild type. These results are consistent with Tyr-48 acting as the acid-base catalyst in human aldose reductase and confirm the importance of Asp-43, Lys-77, and His-110 to the structure and function of the active site."
https://openalex.org/W1530901037,"The enzyme dihydroxy-acid dehydratase previously has been shown to be inactivated in vivo in Escherichia coli within minutes of exposure to hyperbaric O2. In this paper, we show its inactivation is due to the destruction of its catalytically active [4Fe-4S] cluster. The inactivation is not followed by an appreciable decrease in the amount of dihydroxy-acid dehydratase protein as determined by Western blots. Thus, the protein from the inactivated enzyme remains unproteolyzed in the cells. Dihydroxy-acid dehydratase activity recovers after the cells treated with hyperbaric O2 are returned to ambient oxygen. Since this recovery in activity is not accompanied by a significant increase in dihydroxy-acid dehydratase protein and is not prevented by chloramphenicol, it appears primarily to be due to reactivation of the previously inactivated enzyme. The reactivation occurs by reconstitution of the enzyme's Fe-S cluster. These results demonstrate that this enzyme can cycle between forms in which the Fe-S cluster is either present or absent. The facile ability to cycle between these two forms would be compatible with a regulatory role in addition to a catalytic role for this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1621866206,"Abstract Little is known of the events occurring between membrane fusion triggering and subsequent fusion steps. To dissect this process we applied a reversible inhibitor of membrane fusion, lysophosphatidylcholine, to arrest exocytosis and virus-mediated syncytia formation. Next Ca2+ or H+ (the respective fusion triggers) was administered and later removed. Then, inhibitor was withdrawn and fusion ensued, demonstrating that triggering causes the formation of an activated state, which later develops into the fused state. Therefore, while different fusion processes utilize different triggers, the pivotal step involving membrane merger is trigger-independent and lipid-sensitive."
https://openalex.org/W1543822556,"A novel alpha-mannosidase has been identified in rat liver endoplasmic reticulum (ER) which at neutral pH processes the Man9GlcNAc oligosaccharide of glycoproteins by specifically cleaving the terminal mannose residue of the alpha 1,6-linked chain to yield Man8GlcNAc, isomer C. This enzyme accounted for about half of the total ER alpha-mannosidase activity and was fully active at the concentration (0.25 microM) of kifunensine (KIF) completely inhibitory to the action of the ER enzyme which by removing the terminal sugar of the middle chain converts Man9GlcNAc to Man8GlcNAc isomer B; both ER enzymes, however, were inhibited in a similar manner by 1-deoxymannojirimycin (IC50 = 0.2 mM) and their action could not be distinguished with this agent. The KIF-resistant mannosidase which functioned optimally in the presence of 0.1-0.5% Triton X-100 did not show the high susceptibility to EDTA demonstrated by the KIF-sensitive enzyme and unlike the latter had the capacity to hydrolyze p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-mannoside (Km = 0.45 mM); it had no specific cation requirements, but its activity was greatly reduced in the presence of Zn2+. In isolated ER membranes as well as in intact carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone-treated cells, the processing pattern was substantially different in the presence of KIF than in its absence; while in the latter instance Man9GlcNAc was readily converted to Man6GlcNAc, the KIF-resistant enzyme was limited in its capacity to go beyond Man8GlcNAc. The KIF-resistant alpha-mannosidase was found in substantial amounts in all cell lines examined (HL-60, BW5147.3, MOLT-4, K-562, HepG2, Chinese hamster ovary, F-9, Madin-Darby canine kidney, FRTL-5). The finding that mannose removal from N-linked oligosaccharides can be initiated in two distinctive manners substantially broadens our concept of the processing events which can occur before a glycoprotein reaches the Golgi complex or to which ER resident molecules can be exposed."
https://openalex.org/W1516552920,"Monospecific polyclonal antibodies were raised against a variable amino-terminal domain (amino acids 14-150) of a human liver form of UDP-glucuronosyl-transferase conjugating bile acids, UGT2B4 (Jackson, M. R., McCarthy, L. R., Harding, D., Wilson, S., Coughtrie, M. W., and Burchell, B. (1987) Biochem. J. 242, 581-588), expressed as a fusion protein in Escherichia coli. The antibodies were able to recognize the protein, stably expressed in a genetically engineered eukaryotic V79 cell line, against which they were directed. The specificity of these antibodies allowed their use for analyzing the substrate specificity of this isoform in human liver, as well as for determining its contribution to the total hepatic and extra-hepatic glucuronidation of hyodeoxycholic acid. Western blot analysis of microsomal proteins demonstrated the presence of UGT2B4 exclusively in human liver and not in human kidney. In human liver microsomes, the antibodies were able to inhibit and precipitate up to 90% of the total hyodeoxycholic acid 6-O-glucuronidation activity, but had no effect on activities toward several other substrates, such as phenols, bilirubin, or other bile acids, especially hyocholic acid and the steroids 4-hydroxyesterone and estriol. Moreover, Western blot analysis and immunoinhibition studies of human liver microsomes from healthy patients and from patients presenting liver diseases revealed a good correlation between the glucuronidation rate of hyodeoxycholic acid and the UGT2B4 expression level. The absence of immunoinhibition of hyodeoxycholic acid conjugation with UDP sugars other than UDP-glucuronic acid suggests the involvement of different enzymatic systems in the glucosidation and xylosylation of hyodeoxycholic acid. Altogether, the results provided strong evidence for the specific and predominant involvement of UGT2B4 in the 6-O-glucuronidation of this bile acid via a UDP-glucuronic acid-dependent mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W1537407560,"Protease 3C (3Cpro) encoded by human rhinovirus type 14 was purified from recombinant Escherichia coli and shown to bind specifically to the 5'-terminal 126 nucleotides of the viral RNA (126 RNA) in addition to efficiently cleaving a synthetic peptide in trans. The binding of 3Cpro to the viral RNA may be required for the initiation of plus strand viral RNA synthesis, suggesting a second non-proteolytic function for 3Cpro. Single amino acid substitutions were generated in 3Cpro at residues that are highly conserved among picornaviruses or that lie within the putative catalytic triad. Conservative changes at Asp-85 (D85E and D85N) destroyed the ability of 3Cpro to bind specifically to the 126 RNA, whereas the D85N mutation resulted in almost wild-type levels of proteolytic activity. Conversely, substitutions at His-40, Glu-71, or Cys-146 (H40D, E71A, or C146S) gave proteolytically inactive mutants that bound to the 126 RNA. These results suggest that the highly conserved Asp-85 is essential for specific binding to the 126 RNA, but is unlikely to function in proteolysis as the acidic member of the catalytic triad. Moreover, 3Cpro appears to have different domains for the RNA binding and proteolytic activities."
https://openalex.org/W1503439600,"A multitude of external signals induce extensive phosphorylation of Oncoprotein 18 (Op18), which suggests a putative role for this protein in signal transduction. We have recently identified two distinct proline-directed kinase families that phosphorylates Op18 with overlapping but distinct site preference. These two kinase families, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and cyclin-dependent cdc2 kinases, are involved in receptor- and cell cycle-regulated phosphorylation events, respectively. In the present study, site-specific phosphorylation of Op18 in response to stimulation of the antigen receptor-associated CD3 complex was analyzed in the Jurkat T cell-line. The results show that CD3-induced phosphorylation of Ser-25 of Op18, which is the primary MAP kinase phosphorylation site, can be induced by an apparently protein kinase C (PKC)-independent signal transduction pathway. We also demonstrate that Ser-16 of Op18 is specifically phosphorylated in response to the Ca2+ signal generated by CD3 stimulation or by the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin. Ser-16 phosphorylation occurs independently of both PKC and MAP kinase activation. Using site-specific Op18 mutants and tryptic phosphopeptide mapping, we show that phosphorylation of Ser-16 of Op18 together with Ser-25, or Ser-25 and Ser-38, generates two Op18 phosphoisomers showing a dramatic electrophoretic retardation. In conclusion, site-mapping studies of Op18 reveal that CD3 stimulation results in an apparently PKC-independent activation of both the MAP kinase and a Ca(2+)-regulated kinase pathway, which results in phosphorylation of distinct sites of Op18. The data also pinpoints the specific phosphorylation events that result in electrophoretic retardation of Op18."
https://openalex.org/W1564987511,"The B cell receptor for antigen, the membrane immunoglobulin (mIg) molecule, is normally expressed in association with at least two other proteins, mb-1 (Ig-alpha) and B29 (Ig-beta/gamma). We have previously described a set of murine B cell clones transfected with wild-type and mutated forms of membrane-bound IgM (mIgM) that vary in their ability to transduce signals to the cell interior. Analysis of the B cell receptor complex in signaling and nonsignaling mutants of mIgM reveals complete concordance between intact signaling ability and ability of the mIgM to associate with Ig-alpha and Ig-beta/gamma. These results point to the importance of the mIgM transmembrane region in mediating binding to accessory molecules, and provide support for a role of Ig-alpha and Ig-beta/gamma that extends beyond surface expression to signal transduction in B lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1544204744,"In endosomes the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) is sorted into transcytotic vesicles. Transcytosis of the pIgR in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells is regulated both by phosphorylation of Ser664 and by binding of ligand, dimeric IgA (dIgA). Mutation of Ser664 to Ala (pIgR-Ala664) greatly reduces transcytosis of the pIgR without dIgA bound. Here we report that cholera toxin, which specifically activates the heterotrimeric G protein, Gs, stimulates transcytosis of pIgR-Ala664 when dIgA is not bound. However, transcytosis of the wild-type pIgR without dIgA bound was not stimulated by cholera toxin. To further analyze the involvement of Gs in transcytosis, we reconstituted part of the transcytotic pathway. Vesicles containing endocytosed ligand bound to the pIgR could be released from MDCK cells whose apical surface had been mechanically perforated. Release of these vesicles was controlled by phosphorylation of the pIgR and by binding of dIgA. The use of perforated cells allowed us to directly address the involvement of Gs. Our data suggest that both subunits of Gs, Gs alpha and beta gamma, function together to control vesicular release and may therefore be involved in transcytosis in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1514916322,"Abstract Phosphatidic acid (PA) added to intact cells activates a variety of processes including mitogenesis in fibroblasts and superoxide generation in neutrophils. We have investigated the mechanism of activation of superoxide generation in intact human neutrophils by a short-chain (dioctanoyl) PA (diC8PA). After a lag, diC8PA caused a high rate of superoxide production (19.6 nmol of cytochrome c reduced/min/10(6) cells). Activation did not require extracellular Ca2+ and coincided with near quantitative conversion of diC8PA to dioctanoylglycerol (diC8-glycerol). diC8PA also activated cellular phospholipase D with release of long-chain PA and secondary production of long-chain diradylglycerol (sn-1,2-diacylglycerol and 1-O-alkyl-2-acylglycerol). The metabolism of diC8PA to diC8-glycerol was catalyzed by a novel PA phosphohydrolase on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane as demonstrated by the exclusive release of Pi into the extracellular medium. This enzyme also showed activity toward PA containing long-chain unsaturated fatty acids. The ecto-PA phosphohydrolase differed from the intracellular PA phosphohydrolase based on its relative insensitivity to desipramine and N-ethylmaleimide. The enzyme was also present in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and its activity did not change in transfected CHO cells expressing the two membrane-associated isoforms of alkaline phosphatase, indicating that the PA phosphohydrolase was not alkaline phosphatase. Non-hydrolyzable phosphonate analogs of diC8PA poorly stimulated superoxide production. Activation of superoxide generation by diC8PA was inhibited by staurosporine, suggesting a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism. We suggest that the action of a novel ecto-PA phosphohydrolase permits exogenously added short-chain PA to serve as timed-release diacylglycerol and that its biological effects in neutrophils are secondary to diacylglycerol-mediated protein kinase C activation."
https://openalex.org/W1582312374,"Streptolydigin (stl), a bacteriostatic inhibitor of transcription elongation, interacts with the beta subunit of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase. We have defined the target for stl resistance using chemical mutagenesis and mutagenic polymerase chain reaction. Mutations resulting in stl resistance are confined to a small cluster of contiguous amino acids, amino acids 543 to 546. These stlr mutants differ from one another in their levels of resistance to stl in vivo and in vitro. We have analyzed two of the mutants, A543V and F545S, for their effects on elongation and termination in vivo and in vitro. Neither affected termination at rho-dependent or rho-independent terminators. These mutants were indistinguishable from wild type in a T7 in vitro elongation assay. F545S, however, did exhibit slower elongation kinetics in a lambda tR1 pausing assay. We conclude that mutations in the stlr region can influence transcription elongation, but that these amino acids are not directly involved in catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1601279860,"Delineating the molecular basis for agonist-induced destabilization of mRNA of G-protein-linked receptors that contributes to receptor down-regulation is fundamental to our understanding of long-term regulation of receptors by agonist. Previously we identified a prominent, M(r) 35,000 cytosolic RNA-binding protein that (i) binds selectively to beta 1 and beta 2-adrenergic receptor mRNAs, both of which undergo agonist-induced down-regulation; (ii) does not bind either to alpha 1b-adrenergic receptor mRNA, which does not undergo agonist-induced down-regulation, or to beta-globin mRNA; (iii) displays binding to beta 2-adrenergic receptor mRNA that is selectively competed by poly(U) RNA, but not poly(A),-(C), or -(G) RNA; and (iv) its abundance varies inversely with the level of receptor mRNA, being induced by agonists that down-regulate receptor mRNA (Port, J. D., Huang, L.-y., and Malbon (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 24103-24108). We demonstrate here that the binding of beta-adrenergic receptor mRNA by this protein, termed beta-ARB protein, is sensitive to competition by AU-rich domains of the 3'-untranslated regions of c-fos, c-myc, and human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Using the AU-rich 3'-untranslated regions of wild-type adenovirus IVa2 mRNA and variants with defined mutations in the AUUUApentamer, AU-rich, and U-rich domains, we were able to define sequences critical to the binding of the beta 2-receptor mRNA by the beta-ARB protein. Recognition of beta-ARB protein requires not only an AUUUA destabilization pentamer, but also a flanking U-rich domain(s). Using radiolabeled 3'-untranslated regions of short-lived mRNA, we were able to identify this same M(r) 35,000 cytosolic RNA-binding protein(s), beta-ARB protein, as selective for beta 2-adrenergic receptor mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1548770306,"Abstract SPARC is a secreted, Ca(2+)-binding protein that modulates cell shape and gene expression (Sage, E.H., and Bornstein, P. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 14831-14834). In the present study we questioned whether SPARC interacted with an endothelial cell surface receptor. The binding of 125I-SPARC to bovine aortic endothelial cells was dependent on Ca2+ and was sensitive to small changes in extracellular pH; maximal binding occurred at pH 7.1. Scatchard analysis indicated approximately 2.3 x 10(7) binding sites/cell with an apparent KI of 1.1 nM. The interaction was diminished specifically by competition with synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acids 54-73 (SPARC 54-73) and 254-273 (SPARC254-273). The binding of 125I-SPARC254-273, a sequence containing a Ca(2+)-binding EF-hand, was saturated within 45 min at a concentration of 5 microM; Scatchard analysis indicated 4.2 x 10(7) sites/cell and a KI of 2.4 nM. Iodinated proteins from plasma membranes were affinity-chromatographed on SPARC254-273; several proteins with apparent masses ranging from 153 to 100 kDa (unreduced) or from 153 to 122 kDa (reduced) were eluted with the soluble peptide. These proteins represent candidates for a SPARC receptor(s) that mediates the biological activity of this protein on endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1624063331,"Abstract Very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) are heterogeneous, triglyceride-rich particles that are precursors of low density lipoproteins (LDL). Before conversion to LDL, the majority of VLDL are irreversibly cleared from plasma by uncertain mechanisms. To investigate one potential mechanism for VLDL clearance, we studied the ability of LDL receptors to mediate VLDL uptake in vitro. Small, intermediate, and large VLDL from normolipidemic humans were found to bind and undergo catabolism via LDL receptors on normal human fibroblasts. Binding to cell surfaces was up-regulated by lovastatin, an inducer of LDL receptors. Both LDL and a monoclonal antibody against the LDL receptor (IgG-C7) prevented binding of 125I-VLDL. Also, VLDL binding to mutant fibroblasts lacking LDL receptors was low. Thus, LDL receptors mediated VLDL interactions with cells. Binding affinity decreased near saturation, and the apparent number of high affinity sites decreased with increasing VLDL particle size. Because LDL receptors are small (M(r) 115,000) relative to VLDL (M(r) 9-24 x 10(6)) and are clustered in clathrin-coated pits, these findings suggest that steric hindrance becomes an important binding determinant near saturation and are consistent with a lattice model for LDL receptor-ligand interactions. The capacity for cellular catabolism of VLDL decreased with increasing particle size, consistent with a lattice model. The lattice model was also supported by differences between 125I-VLDL binding to cell surfaces and binding to partially purified LDL receptors in solid-phase assays in which steric constraints resulting from clustering in clathrin-coated pits are not present. In both cell-surface and solid-phase assays, VLDL bound via apoE, not apoB-100. Our studies establish that normal VLDL interact with LDL receptors and that steric hindrance due to crowding of particles on clustered LDL receptors is an important determinant of their binding and catabolism. These findings suggest that LDL receptors may participate in normal VLDL clearance in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1584490986,"This study used the rat pancreatic AR 4-2 J cell line as a model system to investigate the role of glycosylation in bile salt-dependent lipase (BSDL) secretion and esterolytic activity. Results indicated that AR 4-2 J cells synthesized BSDL, the esterolytic activity of which was the greater part of the cell activity toward 4-nitrophenylcaproate. The protein thus expressed was glycosylated and had a molecular mass approximately 74 kDa. Exposure of these cells to tunicamycin significantly decreased [3H]mannose incorporation, while [35S]methionine incorporation in trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material was not modified. Tunicamycin treatment of AR 4-2 J cells lead to a lower molecular mass form (approximately 70 kDa) of BSDL which did not incorporate [3H]mannose. The nonglycosylated low M(r) form of the enzyme was not secreted as shown by the decreasing activity in cell-free medium which paralleled the time-dependent secretion of the enzyme. Tunicamycin had no effect on BSDL synthesis. Nevertheless, the nonglycosylated BSDL was apparently not degraded in any cell compartment as shown in part by the enzyme activity accumulation within cells upon brefeldin A treatment. The BSDL expressed by AR 4-2 J cells was characterized by a Km of 68 +/- 30 microM and a kcat of 106 +/- 19 min-1. The sequestrated BSDL due to tunicamycin treatment of cells presents a significant increase of Km of over 10 times to 757 +/- 303 microM. kcat was affected by a factor of approximately 4-445 +/- 22 min-1. These data correlated with an approximately 2.5-fold decrease of the esterolytic activity following inhibition of the N-glycosylation of the protein. The nonglycosylated BSDL was less stable to temperature than the native form. Processing inhibitors (castanospermine, 1-deoxymannojirimycin, and swainsonine) had no effect either on the enzyme activity or on its secretion. Results suggested first that the transfer of the oligosaccharide precursor to the nascent BSDL is essential for the folding of the fully active BSDL. Second that the glycan structure is required for the enzyme secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1554456664,"Site-directed mutagenesis of the Na,K-ATPase has provided a rational approach to identify several amino acids that appear to be involved in ouabain sensitivity. In order to identify additional amino acids that play a role in ouabain binding, we used formic acid to randomly mutagenize a cDNA cassette encoding amino acids 691-946 of the sheep Na,K-ATPase alpha subunit. This was then used to replace the wild type cDNA cassette in the full-length cDNA, and pools of mutants were electroporated into HeLa cells. Ouabain-resistant cells were selected in 0.5 microM ouabain, and the polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the region corresponding to the mutagenized cassette from the genomic DNA of the resistant cells. Sequence analysis of the polymerase chain reaction product revealed a single amino acid substitution, T797N. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to reproduce this change in the wild type sheep alpha subunit, and this construct was able to confer resistance to HeLa cells, verifying the role of the mutation in ouabain resistance. The mutant sheep enzyme was found to be as resistant to ouabain as is the rat Na,K-ATPase. These data suggest that T797N, predicted to be in the fifth putative transmembrane domain, is involved in the interaction between ouabain and the Na,K-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1549483548,"The use of peptides has attracted much interest in the development of synthetic vaccines. Although our current understanding of peptide antigens as immunogens has been greatly advanced recently, there still remain many obstacles. The B cell response elicited by a peptide antigen is governed by a number of poorly understood events such as epitope structure, T cell dependency and major histocompatibility complex restriction, adjuvancy, route of immunization, and immunogen stability. In this paper, we extend our previous studies on the problem of the topographical nature of antigenic sites on native protein antigens, in terms of how much molecular mimicry must be maintained in an antigenic determinant for the induction of high affinity antibodies specific for native protein. We show here that an antigenic epitope from the model contraceptive vaccine candidate lactate dehydrogenase (LDH-C4) can be rationally engineered into a highly structured conformation that mimics the corresponding site in the native three-dimensional protein. Our strategy is based on the selection of an antigenic segment which exhibits certain secondary structural properties and by design principles is fixed in three dimensions by appropriate grafting onto a supersecondary structural motif such as alpha beta, beta alpha beta, or beta alpha beta alpha. The biophysical data are consistent with the proposed secondary structures, and antibodies raised to the various construct show high affinity for the native protein. These studies lend further credence to the conformational nature of peptide epitopes and provide a basis for the rational design of peptide vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W1487782939,"Genetic and biochemical studies have established that the sole function of the Escherichia coli DnaJ, DnaK, and GrpE heat shock proteins in plasmid P1 DNA replication is to convert RepA dimers to monomers. Monomers bind avidly to oriP1 DNA and initiate DNA replication. However, with purified heat shock proteins, only DnaJ, DnaK, and ATP were required for the monomerization of RepA; GrpE was not required. We have found reaction conditions that mimic the physiological situation. GrpE function is absolutely necessary for RepA activation in vitro with DnaJ and DnaK when the free Mg2+ concentration is maintained at a level of approximately 1 microM by a metal ion buffer system. EDTA or physiological metabolites, including citrate, phosphate, pyrophosphate, and ATP, all elicit the GrpE requirement. With these metal ion-buffering systems, GrpE specifically lowers the concentration of Mg2+ required for the RepA activation reaction. The absence of Mg2+ blocks activation and high levels of Mg2+ in solution bypass the requirement for GrpE but not for the other two heat shock proteins. Our results imply that GrpE facilitates the utilization of Mg2+ for an essential step in RepA activation."
https://openalex.org/W1513751959,"p21ras is believed to be involved in the neuronal differentiation of cells responsive to nerve growth factor (NGF). We show that NGF stimulates the activation of p21ras in embryonic sensory neurons and in PC12 cells. In the initial 5 min of exposure to NGF, the activation is concentration-dependent. In the sensory neurons and PC12 cells, the apparent maximal activation was reached at 50 and 10 ng/ml, respectively, with half-maximal activation at approximately 5 and 2-3 ng/ml, respectively. Kinetic analysis at low concentrations of NGF showed that p21ras activation slowly increases with time in both types of cells, while high concentrations result in rapid activation within 5 min. These results indicate that NGF regulates the activation state of p21ras in these cells and provides evidence suggesting that activation of p21ras is involved in NGF signal transduction. Treatment of PC12 cells with brain-derived neurotrophic factor or neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) failed to activate p21ras, suggesting that binding alone to p75LNGFR is insufficient for ras activation. Treatment with the kinase inhibitor, K252a, which inhibits the NGF tyrosine kinase receptor p140trk, abolished ras activation, suggesting that p140trk is the major mediator of p21ras activation by NGF."
https://openalex.org/W1498904323,"This study was designed to investigate whether the changes in lysine hydroxylation known to occur in hypertrophic tendon occur randomly or at specific lysine residues in the type I collagen molecule. Peptides corresponding to the two known major cross-linking sites of type I collagen (a lysine (or hydroxylysine) at position 9N cross-linked to a hydroxylysine at 930 and a lysine (or hydroxylysine) at position 16C cross-linked to a hydroxylysine at position 87) were prepared by collagenase digestion, size fractionation, and separation by high performance liquid chromatography from normal chicken tendon and from chicken tendon subjected to increased tensile load as a result of muscle hypertrophy. The ratio of the difunctional cross-links dihydroxylysinonorleucine to hydroxylysinonorleucine in normal tendon is 0.75:1; this ratio is increased to 6:1 in hypertrophic tendon. The dihydroxylysinonorleucine to hydroxylysinonorleucine ratio is increased to the same extent in samples of the purified cross-linked peptides derived from both the N-terminal and C-terminal lysine aldehyde residues. On the other hand, the relative hydroxylysine content of preparations of the pooled larger helical peptides obtained by cyanogen bromide digestion of normal and hypertrophic tendons was essentially identical. These results demonstrate that there is a specific increase in hydroxylation of only the N- and C-terminal non-helical lysine residues that participate in the formation of the reducible difunctional cross-links of type I collagen in hypertrophic tendon, while the extent of hydroxylation of lysine residues in the helical regions is not affected. The specific mechanism by which the enzyme lysyl hydroxylase acting on its substrate can distinguish between lysine residues destined to be in non-helical versus helical regions in a nascent collagenous peptide that has not yet attained its final secondary structure remains to be defined."
https://openalex.org/W1577805501,"The serum concentration of rat T1 kininogen increases 20-30-fold in response to acute inflammation. This increase, induced in the liver, is regulated primarily at the transcriptional level. In contrast, synthesis of a homologous K kininogen is not induced. In this study, we further analyzed a 321-base pair interleukin (IL)-6 response element in the T1 kininogen promoter and showed that it consists of at least three functionally distinct sequences (A, B, and C boxes). All three sequences were required for full promoter activity. The B box, a strong C/EBP-binding site, was crucial for T1 kininogen's basal expression, whereas A and C boxes resembled the type II IL-6 response elements and were critical for the cytokine response. C/EBP alpha, -beta, and -delta interacted with the B box sequence; however, upon IL-6 stimulation, C/EBP delta binding activity was dramatically induced and became the predominant factor binding to this site. Consistent with these binding studies were the cotransfection experiments, revealing that C/EBP delta was the most potent transactivator under induced conditions and that its transactivation on the T1 kininogen promoter required an intact B box. These findings substantiated the importance of the B box in eliciting the full acute-phase response. A sequence comparison showed the K kininogen promoter contained identical A and B boxes but differed from the T1 kininogen promoter by two nucleotides at the C box. This divergence reduced the IL-6 response by approximately 4-fold, thus contributing to the differential inflammatory response. Our studies demonstrate that evolutionary divergence of a few nucleotides at a critical sequence in the promoter regions can profoundly alter the expression patterns of downstream genes."
https://openalex.org/W1559583296,"Six previously unidentified leukotriene (LT) B4 metabolites formed during incubation of LTB4 with human keratinocytes in primary culture indicate the importance of the 12-hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase pathway in LTB4 metabolism. The ultraviolet absorption spectra obtained for all keratinocyte metabolites revealed the presence of a conjugated diene structural moiety rather than the conjugated triene structure of LTB4. Metabolites were characterized using fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of the pentafluorobenzyl ester, trimethylsilyl ether derivatives and specific degradation reactions. The previously identified 10,11-dihydro-LTB4 and 10,11-dihydro-12-epi-LTB4 were observed as well as 20-OH-10,11-dihydro-LTB4, consistent with the reductase pathway of LTB4 metabolism. This pathway involves initial formation of 12-oxo-LTB4 catalyzed by 12-hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase followed by reduction by delta 10-reductase. The most lipophilic metabolite of LTB4 was identified as 10-hydroxy-4,6,12-octadecatrienoic acid which could result from beta-oxidation reactions of LTB4 following reduction of the 10,11-double bond. One of the most abundant metabolites was characterized as 3,7,14-trihydroxy-8,10,16- docosatrienoic acid which could result from fatty acid elongation following reduction of the 10,11-double bond. Additional abundant LTB4 metabolites were identified that result from glutathione conjugation of 12-oxo-LTB4. These were characterized using fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry and by chemical degradation using hypochlorous acid as well as transpeptidases. These metabolites were identified as 5,12-dihydroxy-6-glutathionyl-7,9,14-eicosatrienoic acid (c-LTB3), 5,12-dihydroxy-6-cysteinyl-glycyl-7,9,14-eicosatrienoic acid (d-LTB3) and 5,12-dihydroxy-6-cysteinyl-7,9,14-eicosatrienoic acid (e-LTB3). We propose that these metabolites result from a 1,8 Michael-type addition of glutathione to the 12-oxo-LTB4 intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1570000692,"The antigen-specific function of T cells is mediated through a surface receptor (alpha beta). Antibodies to the receptor can either inhibit or activate the T cell depending on the multimeric form of the antibody and the isotype of the antibody constant regions. To further examine and eventually control these antagonistic properties, an anti-receptor antibody (1B2) was engineered by linking the variable region genes of the heavy and light chains to form a single-chain binding domain (scFv). The native 1B2 antibody recognizes determinants on the variable regions of both the alpha and beta subunits of the T cell receptor. The scFv gene was expressed in Escherichia coli, and after folding by dilution of solubilized inclusion bodies, scFv protein was purified as both a 29,000-Da monomer and a noncovalently associated 54,000-Da dimer. The binding affinity of the monomer (KD = 17 nM) was 20-fold lower than that of 1B2 Fab fragments (KD = 0.9 nM). In contrast, the binding affinity of the dimer (KD = 1.6 nM) was approximately 2-fold lower than that of 1B2 Fab fragments. Both forms were able to inhibit recognition by the T cell, but the dimer was significantly more effective than the monomer. Inhibition was observed for T cell recognition of either the conventional ligand (a peptide bound to a class I product of the major histocompatibility complex) or the superantigen ligand (staphylococcal enterotoxin B bound to a class II product of the major histocompatibility complex). The results suggest that scFv dimers are the most active form of at least some scFv preparations and that the dimers may have the most potential for inhibiting detrimental in vivo T cell activity."
https://openalex.org/W1599188129,"Abstract The membrane part (residues 1 to approximately 170) of the 325-residue Escherichia coli outer membrane protein OmpA is thought to exist in the membrane as an 8-stranded beta-barrel, subdividing this part into four segments. The influence of proline residues on membrane assembly of the protein has been studied. These were introduced, using site-directed mutagenesis, into each of seven of the antiparallel beta-strands. One important parameter for allowing or not allowing membrane assembly was the potential H beta (i) which is the potential to form an amphiphilic beta-strand. When H beta (i) remained unaltered, 2 prolines were tolerated. Lowering H beta (i) in most cases caused failure of assembly when 2 such residues were present. An insert of 10 residues, including 3 prolines, did not alter H beta(i) and was tolerated, but caused looping out of the strand to the outer face of the membrane; displacement to its inner side would not have allowed for an amphiphilic beta-strand. Thus, a beta-structured protein is as adaptable as it has been shown for an alpha-helix. The wild type segment order 1-2-3-4 has been changed to 1-3-3-4 and 1-4-3-4. Since the proteins were found associated with the outer membrane but could not be incorporated into it, it appears that sorting is less sensitive to alterations than assembly. A regulatory circuit was affected (missense mutants of outer membrane proteins can cause inhibition of synthesis of other such proteins); expression of the two rearranged genes effected a strong inhibition of synthesis of the unrelated porins OmpC and F as well as that of the maltoporin LamB and wild type OmpA. Hence, outer membrane proteins are designed not only for efficient membrane assembly but also for proper regulation of their synthesis."

The maximal velocity of aldehyde reduction with NADPH and p-chlorobenzaldehyde was pH independent at low pH but decreased at high pH with a pK of 7.6. The V/K of NADPH displayed a bell-shaped dependence on pH and decreased with a pKa of 5.3 and a pKb of 7.5. The dissociation constant of NADPH and 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide phosphate (3-APADP) increased at low pH with a pK of 5.6-5.8 and at high pH with a pK of 9.4-9.7. The pKi of NADP and NADPH decreased below a pH of 5 and 6.7 and above a pH of 8.5 and 9.7, respectively. The pK of 8.5-9.7 appears to be due to the interaction of the 2'-phosphate of the nucleotide with a protonated base, possibly a lysine residue. The maximal velocity of alcohol oxidation was pH independent at high pH but decreased at low pH with a pK of 6.5-7.0, when p-chlorobenzyl alcohol or benzyl alcohol and 3-APADP were used. The amino acid residue for alcohol binding has a pK of 7.5-8.2 and also appears in pKi profiles of sorbinil, a competitive inhibitor versus the alcohol. Large (3-3.5) isotope effects on maximal velocity obtained with benzyl alcohol and 3-APADP suggest that with these substrates the hydride transfer step is rate-limiting and a pK of 6.5-7.0 may be the true pK of the acid-base catalyst, possibly a histidine."
https://openalex.org/W1541793560,"The studies presented herein were designed to investigate the role of insulin in maintaining the steady-state number of ribosomes in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes. The RNA content of hepatocytes maintained in the presence of insulin did not change during the 7 days of culture. In contrast, the RNA content declined significantly following 2 days of insulin deprivation and after 4 days without insulin reached a new steady-state value that was approximately 60% of that observed for hepatocytes maintained in the presence of the hormone. Following addition of insulin, the RNA content of insulin-deprived hepatocytes started to increase within 6 h and was restored to the control value within 48 h. The amounts of 18 and 28 S RNA, and thus the number of ribosomes, changed in concert with the total RNA content. Furthermore, synthesis of total cellular protein responded in parallel to the changes in RNA content, suggesting that the number of ribosomes was the primary determinant of protein synthesis under the conditions of these experiments. About one-half of the increase in RNA content following the addition of insulin to insulin-deprived cells could be accounted for by a reduction in the rate of degradation of ribosomes. The remainder of the change in RNA content must have resulted from an increase in ribosome biogenesis. This possibility was confirmed by measuring [3H]uridine incorporation into ribosomal RNA present in mature ribosomes. The rate of synthesis of ribosomal RNA was reduced in parallel with the fall in RNA content in insulin-deprived hepatocytes and was restored to the control value within 3 h of the addition of insulin. Alterations in the synthesis of ribosomal RNA in response to insulin deprivation and replacement were associated with parallel changes in transcription of rDNA as measured in nuclear run-on assays using a DNA probe corresponding to the external transcribed spacer region of rat rDNA. The data demonstrate that insulin regulates the number of ribosomes in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes by accelerating the rate of transcription of rDNA and by slowing the rate of ribosome degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1573989651,"Incorporation of the fluorescent, nonpermeant pH indicator pyranine into submitochondrial particles (pyranine-SMP) permitted monitoring of intravesicular pH changes brought about by proton translocation due to oxidation of respiratory chain substrates or to hydrolysis of ATP. Addition of oligomycin to beef heart pyranine-SMP was followed by a pH-independent quenching of pyranine fluorescence. Quenching was influenced by the presence of adenine nucleotides both inside and outside the submitochondrial particles. The nature of the nucleotides required for quenching resembled the specificity of the adenine nucleotide translocase rather than F1-ATPase. Removal of F1 from pyranine-SMP by treatment of the particles with urea did not alter oligomycin-induced quenching. Atractyloside, a specific inhibitor of the adenine nucleotide translocase, prevented oligomycin-induced quenching when the inhibitor was coincorporated into submitochondrial particles with pyranine. Bongkrekic acid prevented or reversed the oligomycin-dependent quenching when added to pyranine-SMP either before or after oligomycin, respectively, but only when ATP was present within the particles. A mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, lacking translocase genes, exhibited oligomycin-dependent fluorescence quenching which was not inhibited by bongkrekic acid. The results support the interpretation that oligomycin promotes sequestration of the fluorescent probe in a region of the submitochondrial particle, probably the F0F1 complex, that leads to a quenching of fluorescence. The observed quenching can be modulated in a way that suggests an interaction between the translocase and F0."
https://openalex.org/W1527323084,"Two forms of the transcription factor vHNF1 (HNF1 beta or LFB3) have been previously described, derived by alternative splicing from a common premessenger RNA, and have been called vHNF1-A and vHNF1-B. vHNF1 proteins share a homologous homeo-related DNA-binding domain with the HNF1 protein, initially characterized as a liver-restricted transcription factor, and bind to a similar sequence motif. Here we demonstrate that vHNF1-A is a stronger transactivator than vHNF1-B when assayed in transient transfections using two different promoters. vHNF1-A also binds DNA with a higher affinity suggesting that a region of the protein located immediately upstream of the homeodomain can modulate the protein/DNA interaction and transactivation. Both vHNF1 transcripts were found at a constant ratio in every tissue where vHNF1 expression could be detected, using a quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction."

The purification procedure involved differential centrifugation for preparation of Golgi membranes, extraction of the enzyme with Triton X-100, and sequential chromatography on phosphocellulose, UDP-aldehyde adipic acid hydrazone agarose, UDP-hexanolamine-Sepharose, CM-Sepharose, and DEAE-Sepharose. At the phosphocellulose column chromatography step, the recovery of the enzyme activity was less than 25%, but it was enhanced up to 70% when the enzyme assay was performed in the presence of the flow-through fraction from the phosphocellulose column.

https://openalex.org/W1502114646,"The biosynthesis of choline plasmalogens was investigated in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells to determine the source of the vinyl ether linkage. 1-O-[3H] Alk-1'-enyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine was a better precursor than 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine for the synthesis of 1-O-[3H]alk-1'-enyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; this suggests that the vinyl ether linkage in choline phosphoglycerides originates from ethanolamine plasmalogens. The contribution of N-methylation and base exchange enzymes to choline plasmalogen biosynthesis was assessed using 1-O-[3H]alkenyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-[32P]phosphoethanolamine. While 1-O-[3H]alkenyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine was formed from this precursor, the 32P was lost indicating that N-methylation and base exchange enzymes do not contribute significantly to the synthesis of choline plasmalogens. The conversion of a phosphono analog of 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, which is resistant to phospholipase D hydrolysis, to 1-O-[3H]alkenyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-2-phosphocholine was observed demonstrating that phospholipase D is not required for choline plasmalogen biosynthesis. A Mg(2+)-dependent lysophospholipase C activity was detected in microsomes that actively hydrolyzed ether-linked lysophosphoglycerides as well as the lysophosphono analog. To assess the role of lysophospholipase C in shuttling 1-O-alk-1'-enyl-sn-glycerol (alkenylglycerol) from ethanolamine plasmalogens to choline plasmalogens, cells prelabeled with 1-O-[3H]alkenyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine were treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. This resulted in the rapid deacylation of 1-O-[3H]alkenyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine to 1-O-[3H]alkenyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine and the subsequent generation of 1-O-[3H]alkenylglycerol. A concomitant 2-3-fold increase in 1-O-[3H]alkenyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine was observed. These studies suggest that the alkenyl linkage in choline phosphoglycerides may originate from 1-O-alkenyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine through an enzymatic pathway involving lysophospholipase C to generate alkenylglycerol that is subsequently converted to choline plasmalogens."
https://openalex.org/W1545149367,"Triad vesicles from frog skeletal muscle exhibited calcium-induced calcium release highly sensitive to extravesicular pH; calcium induced release at pH > 7.4 but not at pH 6.8. In contrast, triads isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle exhibited significant calcium-induced calcium release at pH 6.8. At pH 7.4, there was no stimulation of calcium release in triads from frog at pCa 7, maximum stimulation at pCa 5, and complete inhibition at pCa 3. Addition of ATP at pCa 5, pH 6.8, induced calcium release with the same high rate constants in both preparations. In triads from frog, ATP-induced calcium release at pCa 5 had the same kinetics at pH 6.8 and 7.4, whereas ATP-induced calcium release at pCa > 8, pH 6.8, was partial, with a decrease in the amounts released but not in rate constants. In contrast, triads from rabbit displayed the opposite behavior, with a decrease in rate constants but not in the amounts of calcium released at pCa > 8, pH 6.8. In triads from frog ATP-induced calcium release decreased at pCa 0.5 mM) completely abolished ATP-induced calcium release at pH 6.8, pCa 7 or 5. The potential physiological relevance of these results is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1607539538,"1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) N-malonyltransferase from etiolated mung bean hypocotyls was examined for its relationship to D-phenylalanine N-malonyltransferase and other enzymes which transfer malonyl groups from malonyl-CoA to D-amino acids. Throughout a 3600-fold purification the ratio of D-phenylalanine N-malonyltransferase activity to ACC N-malonyltransferase activity was unchanged. Antibodies raised against purified ACC N-malonyltransferase 55-kDa protein were also able to precipitate all D-phenylalanine-directed activity from partially purified mung bean extracts. The irreversible inhibitors phenylglyoxal and tetranitromethane reduced malonyltransferase activity towards D-phenylalanine to the same extent as that for ACC. In addition, several other D-amino acids, particularly D-tryptophan and D-tyrosine, were able to inhibit action towards both ACC and D-phenylalanine. These lines of evidence suggest that a single enzyme is capable of promoting malonylation of both ACC and D-phenylalanine. Km values for D-phenylalanine and malonyl-CoA were found to be 48 and 43 microM, respectively; these values are 10-fold lower than the corresponding values when ACC was substrate. Coenzyme A was a noncompetitive (mixed type) product inhibitor towards malonyl-CoA at both unsaturated and saturated ACC concentrations. The enzyme was also inhibited uncompetitively at high concentrations of malonyl-CoA. We propose that the enzyme follows an Ordered Bi-Bi reaction pathway, with the amino acid substrate being bound initially."
https://openalex.org/W1582448393,"We have previously described the isolation of a Chinese hamster ovary cell line, TfT1.11, that has a pleiotropic, temperature-conditional defect in receptor recycling (Cain, C. C., Wilson, R. B., and Murphy, R. F. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 11746-11752). These cells show a rapid loss of cell surface receptors upon temperature shift due to a reduction in the rate of receptor recycling. We show here that, in addition to altered receptor recycling, TfT1.11 cells show three defects in lysosome biogenesis. At the nonpermissive temperature, they 1) redistribute at least one lysosomal enzyme from lysosomes to endosomes, 2) fail to transfer fluid-phase material from early endosomes to later compartments, and 3) fail to accumulate fluid-phase markers due to increased efflux of internalized material. The results suggest that the processes of recycling from the endosome and movement of material from endosomes to lysosomes are tightly linked."
