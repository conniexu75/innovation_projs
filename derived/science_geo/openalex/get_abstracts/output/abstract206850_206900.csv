https://openalex.org/W2072227605,"It now appears to be possible to continuously record changes in intracellular oxidation-reduction levels in terms of the fluorescence of reduced pyridine nucleotide in mitochondria of various tissues and organs in situ. Studies of kidney and brain cortex in the rat show that changes in fluorescence are not measurably affected by the presence of oxyhemoglobin. Nitrogen, sulfide, cyanide, and carbon monoxide cause increases in fluorescence to very nearly the same levels, and the increases are attributed to larger reduction of mitochondrial diphosphopyridine nucleotide. Amytal at a low blood concentration causes increased reduction in the kidney cortex, and at a high blood concentration, in the brain cortex. The qualitative response of the pyridine nucleotide to low oxygen concentrations shows the brain to be more sensitive than the kidney. The first measurable increase in pyridine nucleotide reduction observed on the brain occurs at a concentration of inspired oxygen of 8 percent. Breathing stops when the percentage increase of pyridine nucleotide reduction on the brain reaches about 90; at this point the percentage increase for the kidney is only about 30. This difference corresponds roughly to a tenfold difference in oxygen tension. Half-maximal increase in pyridine nucleotide reduction on the brain occurs at a concentration of inspired oxygen of about 4 percent and corresponds to an intracellular oxygen tension of about 0.2 mm."

A sample of synthetic heptapeptide, Gly-Phe-Phe-Tyr-Thr- Pro-Lys (5), which was identical with that released by the action of trypsin on bovine insulin, possessed less than 0.1 y0 of the activity of intact insulin in the mouse convulsion test. The rates of release of alanine and heptapeptide and of the loss of biological activity during the digestion of insulin with trypsin were found to follow essentially the same kinetics. From the above data, it is concluded that, in contrast with the report of Nicol (3), desoctapeptide-insulin possesses very low or no antidiabetogenic properties and that some portion of the octapeptide, removed by the action of trypsin on insulin, is re- quired for the biological activity insulin.

Such a focus, apparently caused by a blockade of inhibitory synapses, does not demonstrate any major damage in microscopic studies."

Within 2 hours after intravenous injection of the drug, there is a decrease in the in vitro response of the adrenal cortex to stimulation by adrenocorticotrophic hormone and an inhibition of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity. The inhibition of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity might explain the effect of op'DDD on corticosteroid production."

In connective tissue the enzyme is found especially in foreign body giant cells and in histiocytes in macrophagic function."
https://openalex.org/W2010674880,"DURING the recent series of Russian atomic weapon tests, microbarographs were operated at this Establishment. The instruments used were purely mechanical devices having limited frequency response. Excellent records were obtained from several of the larger firings at Novaya Zemlya and particularly from the 50-megaton firing of October 30. Taking the origin time as 08.33 hr. from a study of the seismic signal, we saw the start of the first characteristic microbarograph record (Fig. 1a) 3 hr. 11 min. later at 11.44 hr. on October 30; subsequent to this, we obtained clear signals at approximately 16.40 hr. on October 31 (Fig. 1b); 00.10 hr. on November 1 (Fig. 1c); and 12.40 hr. on November 2 (Fig. 1e). We looked for a signal at around 05.10 hr. on November 2 but could not see one against the background (Fig. 1d)."

This was shown by reversing cocaine desensitization through the administration of agents such as bretylium, which has a sparing effect on norepinephrine, and by the infusion of norepinephrine itself."
https://openalex.org/W1968104307,"WHEN plastics, such as polymethylmethacrylate (‘Perspex’), are irradiated with large doses (of the order of 1 Mrad) of ionizing radiations, for example, X-rays or electrons, optical changes can be observed1 and the appearance of electron spin resonance signals2 indicates the formation of free radicals in the solid. In the case of ‘Perspex’ the diffusion of oxygen into the irradiated plastic causes changes in the optical absorption spectrum and information regarding the diffusion process may thus be obtained3. We have found, however, that in the case of ultra-violet-transmitting plasticizer free ‘Perspex’ (kindly provided by Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd.), when the well-known 4 + 5 line electron spin resonance spectrum 2,4,5 due to the methylmethacrylate free radical was produced by large doses, subsequent exposure of the irradiated sample to an atmosphere of air or oxygen for periods up to 12 weeks at ∼ 25° C. did not lead to a change in the electron spin resonance spectrum which would have corresponded to the formation of a peroxide radical. The 4 + 5 line spectrum persisted slightly weakened and with the ratio of 4 to 5 line spectrum intensity modified."

The gland can also concentrate iodide to several times the plasma concentration, but chloride seems to be preferred in the secretory process. These experiments were undertaken in the hope that a particularly high iodide clearance could form the basis of a method for determining the blood flow to the gland. The results made this approach to blood flow measurements unfeasible."

Zone electrophoresis on filter paper in an earlier work2 did not show that the concentration of the β-globulins in pellagra was any lower than healthy controls and this suggested that there may be a relationship between transferrin polymorphism and incidence of this disease, in view of the findings of Gibbett et al.3 that the faster-migrating transferrins take up more iron."

Examination of serum lipoproteins of patients suffering from hyper-cholesteraemia has revealed a moderate depression of α-lipoprotein and elevation of β-lipoprotein2. Bossak et al.3 reported serum lipoproteins in various animal species and showed that, with ingestion of cholesterol, β-lipoprotein increased with a simultaneous depression of α-lipoprotein."
