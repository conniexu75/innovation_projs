https://openalex.org/W2556558971,"Background The introduction of low cost optical 3D motion tracking sensors provides new options for effective quantification of motor dysfunction. Objective The present study aimed to evaluate the Kinect V2 sensor against a gold standard motion capture system with respect to accuracy of tracked landmark movements and accuracy and repeatability of derived clinical parameters. Methods Nineteen healthy subjects were concurrently recorded with a Kinect V2 sensor and an optical motion tracking system (Vicon). Six different movement tasks were recorded with 3D full-body kinematics from both systems. Tasks included walking in different conditions, balance and adaptive postural control. After temporal and spatial alignment, agreement of movements signals was described by Pearson’s correlation coefficient and signal to noise ratios per dimension. From these movement signals, 45 clinical parameters were calculated, including ranges of motions, torso sway, movement velocities and cadence. Accuracy of parameters was described as absolute agreement, consistency agreement and limits of agreement. Intra-session reliability of 3 to 5 measurement repetitions was described as repeatability coefficient and standard error of measurement for each system. Results Accuracy of Kinect V2 landmark movements was moderate to excellent and depended on movement dimension, landmark location and performed task. Signal to noise ratio provided information about Kinect V2 landmark stability and indicated larger noise behaviour in feet and ankles. Most of the derived clinical parameters showed good to excellent absolute agreement (30 parameters showed ICC(3,1) > 0.7) and consistency (38 parameters showed r > 0.7) between both systems. Conclusion Given that this system is low-cost, portable and does not require any sensors to be attached to the body, it could provide numerous advantages when compared to established marker- or wearable sensor based system. The Kinect V2 has the potential to be used as a reliable and valid clinical measurement tool."

As a marker of inflammatory response, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α mRNA and protein levels, furthermore, COX-2 mRNA level were followed up. Intracellular redox status and extracellular H2O2 level were also monitored by two fluorescent assays (DCFH-DA, Amplex Red). Moreover, the effect of gut microbiota metabolites in the above mentioned processes was taken into account in our model using Lactobacillus plantarum 2142 bacterial strain. Our data revealed that chlorogenic acid had significant lowering effect on the inflammatory response. Treatment with chlorogenic acid (25–50 μM) significantly decreased gene expression and concentration of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 compared to LPS-treated cells. COX-2 and TNF-α mRNA levels were also reduced. Furthermore, chlorogenic acid reduced the level of reactive oxygen species in IPEC-J2 cells. Simultaneous application of chlorogenic acid and Lactobacillus plantarum 2142 supernatant resulted protective effect against LPS-induced inflammation and oxidative stress as well."

Mean GA at PPROM was 28.8 wk (mean latency 2.7 wk). Microbiome profiles were highly diverse but sequences representing Megasphaera type 1 and Prevotella spp. were detected in all vaginal samples. Only 13/70 samples were dominated by Lactobacillus spp. Microbiome profiles at the time of membrane rupture did not cluster by gestational age at PPROM, latency duration, presence of chorioamnionitis or by infant outcomes. Mycoplasma and/or Ureaplasma were detected by PCR in 81% (29/36) of women, and these women had significantly lower GA at delivery and correspondingly lower birth weight infants than Mycoplasma and/or Ureaplasma negative women.Women with PPROM had mixed, abnormal vaginal microbiota but the microbiome profile at PPROM did not correlate with latency duration. Prevotella spp. and Megasphaera type I were ubiquitous. The presence of Mollicutes in the vaginal microbiome was associated with lower GA at delivery. The microbiome was remarkably unstable during the latency period."
https://openalex.org/W2555644144,"Thoracic computed tomography (CT) scans are widely performed in clinical practice, often leading to detection of airway or parenchymal abnormalities in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic individuals. However, clinical relevance of CT abnormalities is uncertain in the general population.We evaluated data from 1361 participants aged ≥40 years from a Canadian prospective cohort comprising 408 healthy never-smokers, 502 healthy ever-smokers, and 451 individuals with spirometric evidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who had thoracic CT scans. CT images of subjects were visually scored for respiratory bronchiolitis(RB), emphysema(E), bronchial-wall thickening(BWT), expiratory air-trapping(AT), and bronchiectasis(B). Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess associations of CT features with respiratory symptoms, dyspnea, health status as determined by COPD assessment test, and risk of clinically significant exacerbations during 12 months follow-up.About 11% of life-time never-smokers demonstrated emphysema on CT scans. Prevalence increased to 30% among smokers with normal lung function and 36%, 50%, and 57% among individuals with mild, moderate or severe/very severe COPD, respectively. Presence of emphysema on CT was associated with chronic cough (OR,2.11; 95%CI,1.4-3.18); chronic phlegm production (OR,1.87; 95% CI,1.27-2.76); wheeze (OR,1.61; 95% CI,1.05-2.48); dyspnoea (OR,2.90; 95% CI,1.41-5.98); CAT score≥10(OR,2.17; 95%CI,1.42-3.30) and risk of ≥2 exacerbations over 12 months (OR,2.17; 95% CI, 1.42-3.0).Burden of thoracic CT abnormalities is high among Canadians ≥40 years of age, including never-smokers and smokers with normal lung function. Detection of emphysema on CT scans is associated with pulmonary symptoms and increased risk of exacerbations, independent of smoking or lung function."
https://openalex.org/W2557112439,"The immune status of patients can impact on the clinical course of cancer. Lymph node (LN) macrophages play critical roles in anti-cancer immunity via the activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs). In this study, the prognostic significance of CD169+ LN macrophages was examined in patients with breast cancer. For this purpose the number of CD169+ cells and their ratio relative to total macrophages (CD68+) in regional LNs (RLNs), as well as the number of CD8+ CTLs in tumor tissues, were investigated using immunohistochemistry of paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 146 patients with breast cancer. The association of these data with clinicopathological factors was then analyzed. The number of cells positive for the pan-macrophage marker CD68 remained relatively uniform, while the number of CD169+ cells varied across all cases. Moreover, a high density of CD169+ cells correlated with early clinical stage and no LN metastasis, while a higher CD169+ to CD68+ ratio was significantly associated with small tumor size and a low Ki-67+ rate. There was also a significant correlation between the number of CD8+ CTLs and that of CD169+ macrophages in high grade breast cancer cases with a Ki-67 index greater than 40%. However, neither the density nor the ratio of CD169+ cells, nor the density of CD8+ CTLs, were associated with relapse-free survival, distant relapse-free survival, or breast cancer-specific survival. These findings suggest that CD169+ macrophages in RLNs might be a useful marker for assessing clinical stage, including LN states, in patients with breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2493555073,"During mRNA translation, several ribosomes attach to the same mRNA molecule simultaneously translating it into a protein. This pipelining increases the protein production rate. A natural and important question is what ribosomal density maximizes the protein production rate. Using mathematical models of ribosome flow along both a linear and a circular mRNA molecule we prove that typically the steady-state production rate is maximized when the ribosomal density is one half of the maximal possible density. We discuss the implications of our results to endogenous genes under natural cellular conditions and also to synthetic biology."
https://openalex.org/W2556639792,"Our aim was to evaluate whether or not alcohol consumption in the form of binge drinking is associated with alterations of memory and executive functions in a population of university students. At the same time, we have studied the role of potential modulating factors, such as the APOE genotype or physical exercise.University students enrolled in academic year 2013–2014 at Escuelas Universitarias Gimbernat-Cantabria, affiliated with the University of Cantabria, were invited to participate in the study. We gathered sociodemographic data and details regarding the lifestyle of 206 students (mean age 19.55 ± 2.39; 67.5% women). We evaluated memory and executive functions via a series of validated cognitive tests. Participants were classified as binge drinkers (BD) and non-BD. Using Student's t-distribution we studied the association between cognitive tests and BD patterns. Multivariate analyses were carried out via multiple linear regression. 47.6% of the students were found to be BD. The BD differed significantly from the non-BD in their results in the executive functions test TMT B (43.41 ± 13.30 vs 37.40 ± 9.77; p = 0.0003). Adjusting by age, sex, academic records, age at which they started consuming alcohol, cannabis consumption, level of physical activity and other possible modifying variables, the association was statistically significant (p = 0.009). We noticed a statistically significant inverse correlation (Pearson’s r2 = -0.192; p = 0.007) between TMT B and starting age of alcohol consumption. Differences were observed in another executive functions test, TMT A, but only in the group of women (19.73±6.1 BD vs 17.78±5.4 non-BD p = 0.05). In spite of the young age of our participants, BD was associated with a lower performance in the executive functions test (TMT B). These deficits were related to the age at which they started drinking alcohol, suggesting an accumulative effect."
https://openalex.org/W2551795963,"Experimental studies demonstrated that saffron (Crocus sativus) given as a dietary supplement counteracts the effects of bright continuous light (BCL) exposure in the albino rat retina, preserving both morphology and function and probably acting as a regulator of programmed cell death [1]. The purpose of this study was to ascertain whether the neuroprotective effect of saffron on rat retina exposed to BCL is associated with a modulation of the endocannabinoid system (ECS). To this aim, we used eight experimental groups of Sprague-Dawley rats, of which six were exposed to BCL for 24 hours. Following retinal function evaluation, retinas were quickly removed for biochemical and morphological analyses. Rats were either saffron-prefed or intravitreally injected with selective type-1 (CB1) or type-2 (CB2) cannabinoid receptor antagonists before BCL. Prefeeding and intravitreally injections were combined in two experimental groups before BCL. BCL exposure led to enhanced gene and protein expression of retinal CB1 and CB2 without affecting the other ECS elements. This effect of BCL on CB1 and CB2 was reversed by saffron treatment. Selective CB1 and CB2 antagonists reduced photoreceptor death, preserved morphology and visual function of retina, and mitigated the outer nuclear layer (ONL) damage due to BCL. Of interest, CB2-dependent neuroprotection was more pronounced than that conferred by CB1. These data suggest that BCL modulates only distinct ECS elements like CB1 and CB2, and that saffron and cannabinoid receptors could share the same mechanism in order to afford retinal protection."
https://openalex.org/W2552425731,"Background The chromosomal region 6q23 has been found to be associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) predisposition through genome wide association studies (GWAS). There are four independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with MS in this region, which spans around 2.5 Mb. Most GWAS variants associated with complex traits, including these four MS associated SNPs, are non-coding and their function is currently unknown. However, GWAS variants have been found to be enriched in enhancers and there is evidence that they may be involved in transcriptional regulation of their distant target genes through long range chromatin looping. Aim The aim of this work is to identify causal disease genes in the 6q23 locus by studying long range chromatin interactions, using the recently developed Capture Hi-C method in human T and B-cell lines. Interactions involving four independent associations unique to MS, tagged by rs11154801, rs17066096, rs7769192 and rs67297943 were analysed using Capture Hi-C Analysis of Genomic Organisation (CHiCAGO). Results We found that the pattern of chromatin looping interactions in the MS 6q23 associated region is complex. Interactions cluster in two regions, the first involving the rs11154801 region and a second containing the rs17066096, rs7769192 and rs67297943 SNPs. Firstly, SNPs located within the AHI1 gene, tagged by rs11154801, are correlated with expression of AHI1 and interact with its promoter. These SNPs also interact with other potential candidate genes such as SGK1 and BCLAF1. Secondly, the rs17066096, rs7769192 and rs67297943 SNPs interact with each other and with immune-related genes such as IL20RA, IL22RA2, IFNGR1 and TNFAIP3. Finally, the above-mentioned regions interact with each other and therefore, may co-regulate these target genes. Conclusion These results suggest that the four 6q23 variants, independently associated with MS, are involved in the regulation of several genes, including immune genes. These findings could help understand mechanisms of disease and suggest potential novel therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2555072109,"Time is brain: benefits of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in ischemic stroke last for 4.5 hours but rapidly decrease as time progresses following symptom onset. The goal of the Acute Brain Care (ABC) intervention study was to reduce the door-to-needle time (DNT) to ≤30 minutes by optimizing in-hospital stroke treatment.We performed a single-centre before (pre-intervention period: 2000-2005) versus after (post-intervention period: 2006-2012) comparison in a cohort of consecutive patients treated with IVT. The intervention consisted of the implementation of a multidisciplinary stroke protocol combining simple strategies to reduce the DNT. Primary endpoint was the DNT, presented as proportion ≤30 minutes and median time. Secondary clinical endpoints were symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH), and favourable outcome defined as a modified Rankin scale (mRs) score of 0-2 at 3 months. Endpoints were additionally adjusted for baseline imbalances between the groups.In the pre-intervention period, none (0.0%) of the 100 patients (mean age 63.8 years, median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score 14) treated with IVT had a DNT ≤30 minutes compared to 234 (62.7%) of the 373 patients (mean age 66.7 years, median NIHSS score 10) in the post-intervention period (p<0.001). The median DNT decreased from 75 (IQR 60-105) to 28 minutes (IQR 20-37, p<0.001). SICH rate remained stable (3.0% versus 4.4%, OR 1.50, 95% CI 0.43─5.25; adjusted OR 5.47, 95% CI 0.69-42.12). The proportion of patients with a favourable outcome increased (38.9% versus 52.3%, OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.09-2.73) but lost statistical significance after adjustment (adjusted OR 1.46, 95% CI 0.82-2.61).Important and sustained reduction of the DNT to 30 minutes or less can be safely achieved by optimizing in-hospital stroke treatment. With its simple strategies, the ABC-protocol is a pragmatic framework for increasing the therapeutic yield in time-dependent stroke treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2556394949,"Bacterial surveys of the vaginal and bladder human microbiota have revealed an abundance of many similar bacterial taxa. As the bladder was once thought to be sterile, the complex interactions between microbes within the bladder have yet to be characterized. To initiate this process, we have begun sequencing isolates, including the clinically relevant genus Gardnerella. Herein, we present the genomic sequences of four Gardnerella strains isolated from the bladders of women with symptoms of urgency urinary incontinence; these are the first Gardnerella genomes produced from this niche. Congruent to genomic characterization of Gardnerella isolates from the reproductive tract, isolates from the bladder reveal a large pangenome, as well as evidence of high frequency horizontal gene transfer. Prophage gene sequences were found to be abundant amongst the strains isolated from the bladder, as well as amongst publicly available Gardnerella genomes from the vagina and endometrium, motivating an in depth examination of these sequences. Amongst the 39 Gardnerella strains examined here, there were more than 400 annotated prophage gene sequences that we could cluster into 95 homologous groups; 49 of these groups were unique to a single strain. While many of these prophages exhibited no sequence similarity to any lytic phage genome, estimation of the rate of phage acquisition suggests both vertical and horizontal acquisition. Furthermore, bioinformatic evidence indicates that prophage acquisition is ongoing within both vaginal and bladder Gardnerella populations. The abundance of prophage sequences within the strains examined here suggests that phages could play an important role in the species’ evolutionary history and in its interactions within the complex communities found in the female urinary and reproductive tracts."
https://openalex.org/W2549743673,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a complex eating disorder with severe dysregulation of appetitive behavior. The activity-based anorexia (ABA) paradigm is an animal model in which rodents exposed to both running wheels and scheduled feeding develop aspects of AN including paradoxical hypophagia, dramatic weight loss, and hyperactivity, while animals exposed to only one condition maintain normal body weight. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), an activity-dependent modulator of neuronal plasticity, is reduced in the serum of AN patients, and is a known regulator of feeding and weight maintenance. We assessed the effects of scheduled feeding, running wheel access, or both on the expression of BDNF transcripts within the mesocorticolimbic pathway. We also assessed the expression of neuronal cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1) to explore the specificity of effects on BDNF within the mesocorticolimbic pathway. Scheduled feeding increased the levels of both transcripts in the hippocampus (HPC), increased NCAM1 mRNA expression in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), and decreased BDNF mRNA levels in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). In addition, wheel running increased BDNF mRNA expression in the VTA. No changes in either transcript were observed in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Furthermore, no changes in either transcript were induced by the combined scheduled feeding and wheel access condition. These data indicate that scheduled feeding or wheel running alter BDNF and NCAM1 expression levels in specific regions of the mesocorticolimbic pathway. These findings contribute to our current knowledge of the molecular alterations induced by ABA and may help elucidate possible mechanisms of AN pathology."

This paper provides new evidence on the levels and drivers of expenditure on out-patient care, as well as choice of providers, using household survey data from 8 districts in 3 states of India. Results indicate that the economically vulnerable spend more on OPD as a proportion of per capita consumption expenditure, out-patient care remains overwhelmingly private and switches of providers-while not very prevalent-is mostly towards private providers. A key result is that choice of public providers tend to lower OPD spending significantly. It indicates that an improvement in the overall quality and accessibility of government facilities still remain an important tool that should be considered in the context of financial protection."
https://openalex.org/W2556346141,"Background and Aims Non-invasive markers of liver fibrosis are urgently required, especially for use in non-specialist settings. The aim of this study was to identify novel serum biomarkers of advanced fibrosis. Methods We performed an unbiased screen of 120 serum analytes including cytokines, chemokines and proteases in 70 patients (35 without fibrosis, 35 with cirrhosis on biopsy), and selected a panel of 44 candidate biomarkers, which were subsequently measured in a mixed-etiology cohort of 432 patients with known serum HA, PIIINP and TIMP1 (which comprise the validated Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) test). Multivariate logistic regression modelling was used to generate models for the prediction of advanced or significant fibrosis (METAVIR ≥F3 and ≥F2, respectively); in addition to identifying biomarkers of disease activity and steatohepatitis. Results Seventeen analytes were significantly differentially expressed between patients with no advanced fibrosis and patients with advanced fibrosis, the most significant being hyaluronic acid (HA) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 7 (p = 2.9E-41 and p = 1.0E-26, respectively). The optimal model for the prediction of advanced fibrosis comprised HA, MMP7, MMP1, alphafetoprotein (AFP) and the AST to platelet ratio index (APRI). We demonstrate enhanced diagnostic accuracy (AUROC = 0.938) compared to a model comprising HA, PIIINP and TIMP1 alone (ELF) (AUROC = 0.898, p<0.0001, De Long’s test). Conclusions We have identified novel serum biomarkers of advanced liver fibrosis, which have the potential to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of established biomarkers. Our data suggest MMP7 is a valuable indicator of advanced fibrosis and may play a role in liver fibrogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2554805395,"Stressful life leads to mood disorders. Chronic mild stress is presumably major etiology for depression, and acute severe stress leads to anxiety. These stressful situations may impair hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and in turn induce synapse dysfunction. However, it remains elusive how the stress hormones mess up subcellular compartments and interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons, which we have investigated in mouse amygdala, a structure related to emotional states.Dexamethasone was chronically given by intraperitoneal injection once a day for one week or was acutely washed into the brain slices. The neuronal spikes and synaptic transmission were recorded by whole-cell patching in amygdala neurons of brain slices. The chronic or acute administration of dexamethasone downregulates glutamate release as well as upregulates GABA release and GABAergic neuron spiking. The chronic administration of dexamethasone also enhances the responsiveness of GABA receptors.The upregulation of GABAergic neurons and the downregulation of glutamatergic neurons by glucocorticoid impair their balance in the amygdala, which leads to emotional disorders during stress."
https://openalex.org/W2551871213,"Phyllosphere fungi harbor a tremendous species diversity and play important ecological roles. However, little is known about their distribution patterns within forest ecosystems. We examined how species diversity and community composition of phyllosphere fungi change along a vertical structure in a tropical forest in Thailand. Fungal communities in 144 leaf samples from 19 vertical layers (1.28–34.4 m above ground) of 73 plant individuals (27 species) were investigated by metabarcoding analysis using Ion Torrent sequencing. In total, 1,524 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were detected among 890,710 reads obtained from the 144 leaf samples. Taxonomically diverse fungi belonging to as many as 24 orders of Ascomycota and 21 orders of Basidiomycota were detected, most of which inhabited limited parts of the lowest layers closest to the forest floor. Species diversity of phyllosphere fungi was the highest in the lowest layers closest to the forest floor, decreased with increasing height, and lowest in the canopy; 742 and 55 fungal OTUs were detected at the lowest and highest layer, respectively. On the layers close to the forest floor, phyllosphere fungal communities were mainly composed of low frequency OTUs and largely differentiated among plant individuals. Conversely, in the canopy, fungal communities consisted of similar OTUs across plant individuals, and as many as 86.1%–92.7% of the OTUs found in the canopy (≥22 m above ground) were also distributed in the lower layers. Overall, our study showed the variability of phyllosphere fungal communities along the vertical gradient of plant vegetation and environmental conditions, suggesting the significance of biotic and abiotic variation for the species diversity of phyllosphere fungi."

https://openalex.org/W2549100503,"Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Several reports suggest that acute inflammation after ischemia-reperfusion exacerbates brain damage; however, molecular mechanisms underlying this effect remain unclear. Here, we report that MAC-3-positive immune cells, including infiltrating bone marrow-derived macrophages and activated microglia, express abundant angiopoietin-like protein (ANGPTL) 2 in ischemic mouse brain in a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. Both neurological deficits and infarct volume decreased in transient MCAO model mice established in Angptl2 knockout (KO) relative to wild-type mice. Acute brain inflammation after ischemia-reperfusion, as estimated by expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF)-α, was significantly suppressed in Angptl2 KO compared to control mice. Moreover, analysis employing bone marrow chimeric models using Angptl2 KO and wild-type mice revealed that infiltrated bone marrow-derived macrophages secreting ANGPTL2 significantly contribute to acute brain injury seen after ischemia-reperfusion. These studies demonstrate that infiltrating bone marrow-derived macrophages promote inflammation and injury in affected brain areas after ischemia-reperfusion, likely via ANGPTL2 secretion in the acute phase of ischemic stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2555585609,"To increase knee range of motion and improve gait in children with spastic paresis (SP), the semitendinosus muscle (ST) amongst other hamstring muscles is frequently lengthened by surgery, but with variable success. Little is known about how the pre-surgical mechanical and morphological characteristics of ST muscle differ between children with SP and typically developing children (TD). The aims of this study were to assess (1) how knee moment-angle characteristics and ST morphology in children with SP selected for medial hamstring lengthening differ from TD children, as well as (2) how knee moment-angle characteristics and ST morphology are related. In nine SP and nine TD children, passive knee moment-angle characteristics and morphology of ST (i.e. fascicle length, muscle belly length, tendon length, physiological cross-sectional area, and volume) were assessed by hand-held dynamometry and freehand 3D ultrasound, respectively. At net knee flexion moments above 0.5 Nm, more flexed knee angles were found for SP compared to TD children. The measured knee angle range between 0 and 4 Nm was 30% smaller in children with SP. Muscle volume, physiological cross-sectional area, and fascicle length normalized to femur length were smaller in SP compared to TD children (62%, 48%, and 18%, respectively). Sixty percent of the variation in knee angles at 4 Nm net knee moment was explained by ST fascicle length. Altered knee moment-angle characteristics indicate an increased ST stiffness in SP children. Morphological observations indicate that in SP children planned for medial hamstring lengthening, the longitudinal and cross-sectional growth of ST muscle fibers is reduced. The reduced fascicle length can partly explain the increased ST stiffness and, hence, a more flexed knee joint in these SP children."
https://openalex.org/W2550760240,"Tetrapyrroles such as chlorophyll and heme are indispensable for life because they are involved in energy fixation and consumption, i.e. photosynthesis and oxidative phosphorylation. In eukaryotes, the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway is shaped by past endosymbioses. We investigated the origins and predicted locations of the enzymes of the heme pathway in the chlorarachniophyte Bigelowiella natans, the cryptophyte Guillardia theta, the “green” dinoflagellate Lepidodinium chlorophorum, and three dinoflagellates with diatom endosymbionts (“dinotoms”): Durinskia baltica, Glenodinium foliaceum and Kryptoperidinium foliaceum. Bigelowiella natans appears to contain two separate heme pathways analogous to those found in Euglena gracilis; one is predicted to be mitochondrial-cytosolic, while the second is predicted to be plastid-located. In the remaining algae, only plastid-type tetrapyrrole synthesis is present, with a single remnant of the mitochondrial-cytosolic pathway, a ferrochelatase of G. theta putatively located in the mitochondrion. The green dinoflagellate contains a single pathway composed of mostly rhodophyte-origin enzymes, and the dinotoms hold two heme pathways of apparently plastidal origin. We suggest that heme pathway enzymes in B. natans and L. chlorophorum share a predominantly rhodophytic origin. This implies the ancient presence of a rhodophyte-derived plastid in the chlorarachniophyte alga, analogous to the green dinoflagellate, or an exceptionally massive horizontal gene transfer."
https://openalex.org/W2551270251,"Osmotic stress adversely affects the growth, fruit quality and yield of watermelon (Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. & Nakai). Increasing the tolerance of watermelon to osmotic stress caused by factors such as high salt and water deficit is an effective way to improve crop survival in osmotic stress environments. Roots are important organs in water absorption and are involved in the initial response to osmosis stress; however, few studies have examined the underlying mechanism of tolerance to osmotic stress in watermelon roots. For better understanding of this mechanism, the inbred watermelon accession M08, which exhibits relatively high tolerance to water deficits, was treated with 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000. The root samples were harvested at 6 h after PEG treatment and untreated samples were used as controls. Transcriptome analyses were carried out by Illumina RNA sequencing. A total of 5246 differentially expressed genes were identified. Gene ontology enrichment and biochemical pathway analyses of these 5246 genes showed that short-term osmotic stress affected osmotic adjustment, signal transduction, hormone responses, cell division, cell cycle and ribosome, and M08 may repress root growth to adapt osmotic stress. The results of this study describe the watermelon root transcriptome under osmotic stress and propose new insight into watermelon root responses to osmotic stress at the transcriptome level. Accordingly, these results allow us to better understand the molecular mechanisms of watermelon in response to drought stress and will facilitate watermelon breeding projects to improve drought tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2549748085,"We hypothesized that L-alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine (GPC), a deacylatedphosphatidylcholine derivative, can influence the mitochondrial respiratory activity and in this way, may exert tissue protective effects.Rat liver mitochondria were examined with high-resolution respirometry to analyze the effects of GPC on the electron transport chain in normoxic and anoxic conditions. Besides, Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to sham operation or standardized liver ischemia-reperfusion (IR), with or without GPC administration. The reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione disulfide (GSSG), the tissue myeloperoxidase, xanthine oxidoreductase and NADPH oxidases activities were measured. Tissue malondialdehyde and nitrite/nitrate formation, together with blood superoxide and hydrogen-peroxide production were assessed.GPC increased the efficacy of complex I-linked mitochondrial oxygen consumption, with significantly lower in vitro leak respiration. Mechanistically, liver IR injury was accompanied by deteriorated mitochondrial respiration and enhanced ROS production and, as a consequence, by significantly increased inflammatory enzyme activities. GPC administration decreased the inflammatory activation in line with the reduced oxidative and nitrosative stress markers.GPC, by preserving the mitochondrial complex I function respiration, reduced the biochemical signs of oxidative stress after an IR episode. This suggests that GPC is a mitochondria-targeted compound that indirectly suppresses the activity of major intracellular superoxide-generating enzymes."

Agents move to neighborhoods where their wealth is not lesser than that of some proportion of their neighbors, the threshold level. As in the case of the classic Schelling model, we find here that wealth-based segregation occurs and persists. However, introducing uncertainty into the decision to move—that is, with some probability, if agents are allowed to move even though the threshold condition is contravened—we find that even for small proportions of such disallowed moves, the dynamics no longer yield segregation but instead sharply transition into a persistent mixed wealth distribution, consistent with empirical findings of Benenson, Hatna, and Or. We investigate the nature of this sharp transformation, and find that it is because of a non-linear relationship between allowed moves (moves where threshold condition is satisfied) and disallowed moves (moves where it is not). For small increases in disallowed moves, there is a rapid corresponding increase in allowed moves (before the rate of increase tapers off and tends to zero), and it is the effect of this non-linearity on the dynamics of the system that causes the rapid transition from a segregated to a mixed wealth state. The contravention of the tolerance condition, sanctioning disallowed moves, could be interpreted as public policy interventions to drive de-segregation. Our finding therefore suggests that it might require limited, but continually implemented, public intervention—just sufficient to enable a small, persistently sustained fraction of disallowed moves so as to trigger the dynamics that drive the transformation from a segregated to mixed equilibrium."
https://openalex.org/W2551987737,"Scatter-hoarding rodents can act as both predators and dispersers for many large-seeded plants because they cache seeds for future use, but occasionally forget them in sites with high survival and establishment probabilities. The most important fruit or seed trait influencing rodent foraging behavior is seed size; rodents prefer large seeds because they have higher nutritional content, but this preference can be counterbalanced by the higher costs of handling larger seeds. We designed a cafeteria experiment to assess whether fruit and seed size of Myrcianthes coquimbensis, an endangered desert shrub, influence the decision-making process during foraging by three species of scatter-hoarding rodents differing in body size: Abrothrix olivaceus, Phyllotis darwini and Octodon degus. We found that the size of fruits and seeds influenced foraging behavior in the three rodent species; the probability of a fruit being harvested and hoarded was higher for larger fruits than for smaller ones. Patterns of fruit size preference were not affected by rodent size; all species were able to hoard fruits within the entire range of sizes offered. Finally, fruit and seed size had no effect on the probability of seed predation, rodents typically ate only the fleshy pulp of the fruits offered and discarded whole, intact seeds. In conclusion, our results reveal that larger M. coquimbensis fruits have higher probabilities of being harvested, and ultimately of its seeds being hoarded and dispersed by scatter-hoarding rodents. As this plant has no other dispersers, rodents play an important role in its recruitment dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2553265430,"Three-dimensional (3D) nanometal scaffolds have gained considerable attention recently because of their promising application in high-performance supercapacitors compared with plain metal foils. Here, a highly oriented nickel (Ni) nanowire array (NNA) film was prepared via a simple magnetic-field-driven aqueous solution deposition process and then used as the electrode scaffold for the vapor-phase polymerization of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT). Benefiting from the unique 3D open porous structure of the NNA that provided a highly conductive and oriented backbone for facile electron transfer and fast ion diffusion, the as-obtained poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) exhibited an ultra-long cycle life (95.7% retention of specific capacitance after 20 000 charge/discharge cycles at 5 A/g) and superior capacitive performance. Furthermore, two electrodes were fabricated into an aqueous symmetric supercapacitor, which delivered a high energy density (30.38 Wh/kg at 529.49 W/kg) and superior long-term cycle ability (13.8% loss of capacity after 20 000 cycles). Based on these results, the vapor-phase polymerization of EDOT on metal nanowire array current collectors has great potential for use in supercapacitors with enhanced performance."
https://openalex.org/W2554832819,"The purpose of this study was to define histological features determining the malignant potential of EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma (LADC). Surgically resected tumors (EGFR-mutated LADCs with (21) and without (79) lymph node metastasis and EGFR wild-type LADCs with (26) and without (108) lymph node metastasis) and biopsy samples from inoperably advanced tumors (EGFR-mutated LADCs (78) and EGFR wild-type LADCs (99)) were examined. In surgically resected tumors, the EGFR-mutated LADCs with lymph node metastasis had the micropapillary element in a significantly greater proportion than others (Mann-Whitney tests P ≤0.026). The proportion of micropapillary element was higher in the EGFR-mutated LADC at the advanced stage (stage II, III, or IV) than in the tumor at the early stage (stage I) (Mann-Whitney test, P<0.0001). In the biopsy samples from inoperably advanced LADCs (177), EGFR-mutated tumors also had micropapillary element at a higher frequency than EGFR-wild type tumors (53/78 (68%), versus 30/99 (30%), Pearson x2 test, P<0.0001). In stage I EGFR-mutated LADCs (84), the tumors with the micropapillary element (34) exhibited a significantly higher recurrence rate than tumors without micropapillary element (50) (5-year Recurrence-free survival 64.4% versus 93.3%, log-rank test P = 0.028). The micropapillary element may be an exclusive determinant of malignant potential in EGFR-mutated LADC. It is suggested that EGFR-mutated LADC may develop through a distinct histogenesis, in which the micropapillary element is important for promoting progression."
https://openalex.org/W2555000450,"Sestrin 2 (SESN2) is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) which controls central cellular processes such as protein translation and autophagy. Previous studies have suggested that SESN2 itself is subjected to regulation at multiple levels. Here, we investigated the expression of SESN2 in the skin and in isolated skin cells. SESN2 was detected by immunofluorescence analysis in fibroblasts and keratinocytes of human skin. Differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes was not associated with altered SESN2 expression and siRNA-mediated knockdown of SESN2 did not impair stratum corneum formation in vitro. However, SESN2 was increased in both cell types when the expression of its paralog SESN1 was blocked by siRNA-mediated knock down, indicating a compensatory mechanism for the control of expression. Irradiation with UVB but not with UVA significantly increased SESN2 expression in both keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Upregulation of SESN2 expression could be completely blocked by suppression of p53. These results suggest that SESN2 is dispensable for normal epidermal keratinization but involved in the UVB stress response of skin cells."
https://openalex.org/W2549872490,"Lysine decarboxylase (LDC) is a crucial enzyme for acid stress resistance and is also utilized for the biosynthesis of cadaverine, a promising building block for bio-based polyamides. We determined the crystal structure of LDC from Selenomonas ruminantium (SrLDC). SrLDC functions as a dimer and each monomer consists of two distinct domains; a PLP-binding barrel domain and a sheet domain. We also determined the structure of SrLDC in complex with PLP and cadaverine and elucidated the binding mode of cofactor and substrate. Interestingly, compared with the apo-form of SrLDC, the SrLDC in complex with PLP and cadaverine showed a remarkable structural change at the PLP binding site. The PLP binding site of SrLDC contains the highly flexible loops with high b-factors and showed an open-closed conformational change upon the binding of PLP. In fact, SrLDC showed no LDC activity without PLP supplement, and we suggest that highly flexible PLP binding site results in low PLP affinity of SrLDC. In addition, other structurally homologous enzymes also contain the flexible PLP binding site, which indicates that high flexibility at the PLP binding site and low PLP affinity seems to be a common feature of these enzyme family."
https://openalex.org/W2554563734,"Patients with biliopancreatic tumors frequently suffer from weight loss and cachexia. The in-hospital work-up to differentiate between benign and malignant biliopancreatic lesions requires repeated pre-interventional fasting periods that can aggravate this problem. We conducted a randomized intervention study to test whether routine in-hospital peripheral intravenous nutrition on fasting days (1000 ml/24 h, 700 kcal) has a beneficial effect on body weight and body composition.168 patients were screened and 100 enrolled in the trial, all undergoing in-hospital work-up for biliopancreatic mass lesions and randomized to either intravenous nutrition or control. Primary endpoint was weight loss at time of hospital discharge; secondary endpoints were parameters determined by bioelectric impedance analysis and quality of life recorded by the EORTC questionnaire.Within three months prior to hospital admission patients had a median self-reported loss of 4.0 kg (25*th: -10.0 kg and 75*th* percentile: 0.0kg) of body weight. On a multivariate analysis nutritional intervention increased body weight by 1.7 kg (95% CI: 0.204; 3.210, p = 0.027), particularly in patients with malignant lesions (2.7 kg (95% CI: 0.71; 4.76, p < 0.01).In a hospital setting, patients with suspected biliopancreatic mass lesions stabilized their body weight when receiving parenteral nutrition in fasting periods even when no total parenteral nutrition was required. Analysis showed that this effect was greatest in patients with malignant tumors. Further studies will be necessary to see whether patient outcome is affected as well.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02670265."
https://openalex.org/W2552748471,"Experimental and mathematical studies in immunology have revealed that the dynamics of the programmed T cell response to vigorous infection can be conveniently modelled using a sigmoidal or a discontinuous immune response function. This paper hypothesizes strong synergies between this existing work and the dynamical behaviour of engineering systems with a variable structure control (VSC) law. These findings motivate the interpretation of the immune system as a variable structure control system. It is shown that dynamical properties as well as conditions to analytically assess the transition from health to disease can be developed for the specific T cell response from the theory of variable structure control. In particular, it is shown that the robustness properties of the specific T cell response as observed in experiments can be explained analytically using a VSC perspective. Further, the predictive capacity of the VSC framework to determine the T cell help required to overcome chronic Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV) infection is demonstrated. The findings demonstrate that studying the immune system using variable structure control theory provides a new framework for evaluating immunological dynamics and experimental observations. A modelling and simulation tool results with predictive capacity to determine how to modify the immune response to achieve healthy outcomes which may have application in drug development and vaccine design."
https://openalex.org/W2555521491,"SV2A is a glycoprotein present in the membranes of most synaptic vesicles. Although it has been highly conserved throughout evolution, its physiological role remains largely unknown. Nevertheless, Levetiracetam, a very effective anti-epileptic drug, has been recently demonstrated to bind to SV2A. At present, our understanding of the normal function of SV2A and its possible involvement in diseases like epilepsy is limited. With this study, we sought to develop a relevant model enabling analysis of SV2A's role in the occurrence or progression of epilepsy. For this purpose, we generated a floxed SV2A mouse model with conditional alleles carrying LoxP sites around exon 3 by means of a gene-targeting strategy. The SV2A lox/lox mouse line is indistinguishable from wild-type mice. When the recombination was observed in all cells, a model of mice with both SV2A alleles floxed around exon 3 recapitulated the phenotype of SV2A KO mice, including seizures. However, the specific invalidation of SV2A in the CA3 hippocampal region was not followed by epileptic seizures or decrease in the epileptic threshold on pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) test. These results demonstrate that the floxed SV2A mouse line has been successfully established. This transgenic mouse model will be useful for investigating SV2A functions related to cell types and developmental stages."
https://openalex.org/W2550055517,"Chronic HIV infection is characterized by increased immune activation and immunosenescence. p16 INK4a (p16) is a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase antagonist family that inhibits cellular proliferation, and its protein expression increases during normal chronological aging. However, some infectious diseases can increase the expression of this anti-proliferative protein, potentially accelerating immunological aging and dysfunction. In order to investigate the immunological aging in HIV patients, p16 protein expression was evaluated by flow cytometry, in T cell subsets in a cohort of chronically HIV-infected patients on and off ART as well as age-matched healthy controls. Results showed that untreated HIV-infected subjects exhibited increased per-cell p16 protein expression that was discordant with chronological aging. ART restored p16 protein expression to levels comparable with HIV-negative subjects in the CD4 compartment, but not in CD8 T cells, which can be an indicative of an irreversible activation/exhaustion status on these cells. Additionally, the frequency of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was positively correlated with p16 expression in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in untreated subjects. In contrast to healthy controls, untreated HIV-infected individuals had increased p16 levels within the effector memory (TEM) subset, indicating a possible role for this marker in impaired clonal expansion during antiviral effector function. Taken together, these data demonstrate that chronic HIV infection is associated with elevated expression of the cellular aging marker p16 in T cells. ART restored normal p16 levels in the CD4+ T cell compartment, indicating that use of therapy can be of fundamental importance to normal cell cycling and maintaining immune homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2554214081,"Myostatin (MSTN) and α-actinin-3 (ACTN3) genes are potentially associated with preservation of muscle mass and oxidative capacity, respectively. To explore the possible role of these genes in exceptional longevity (EL), the allele/genotype frequency distribution of two polymorphisms in MSTN (rs1805086, K153R) and ACTN3 (rs1815739, R577X) was studied in Japanese centenarians of both sexes (n = 742) and healthy controls (n = 814). The rs1805086 R-allele (theoretically associated with muscle mass preservation at the expense of oxidative capacity) was virtually absent in the two groups, where genotype distributions were virtually identical. Likewise, no differences in allele (p = 0.838 (women); p = 0.193 (men); p = 0.587 (both sexes)) or genotype distribution were found between groups for ACTN3 rs1815739 (p = 0.975 (women), p = 0.136 (men), p = 0.752 (both sexes)). Of note, however, the frequency of the rs1805086 R-allele observed here is the lowest been reported to date whereas that of the 'highly oxidative/efficient' rs1815739 XX genotype in Japanese male centenarians (33.3%) or supercentenarians of both sexes (≥110 years) are the highest (32.6%), for a non-American population. No definite conclusions can be inferred in relation to EL owing to its lack of association with both rs1815739 and rs1805086. However, it cannot be excluded that these gene variants could eventually be related to a ""healthy"" metabolic phenotype in the Japanese population. Further research might determine if such metabolic profile is among the factors that can potentially predispose these individuals to live longer than Caucasians and what genetic variants might be actually involved."

We investigated the association between allergic conditions and age-related cataracts in the South Korean adult population.A cross-sectional study was performed using data obtained from 1,170 participants aged 40 years or older who were enrolled in the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2010. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between age-related cataracts and allergic conditions, including total serum IgE and allergen-specific serum IgE levels, after adjustment for potential confounders (age, sex, alcohol consumption, smoking, sun exposure, blood pressure, plasma glucose and cholesterol levels, as well as histories of asthma, atopic dermatitis, and rheumatoid arthritis).After adjusting for potential confounders, the odds ratio (OR) for age-related cataract was greater in participants with higher total serum IgE levels (OR = 1.37; P = 0.044). In particular, increased IgE levels were significantly associated with nuclear cataract (OR = 1.42; P = 0.032). However, allergen-specific serum IgE levels did not differ significantly between groups. In the trend analysis, no significant relationship was observed between serum IgE and any type of age-related cataract.Increased total serum IgE level is independently associated with age-related cataracts after adjustment for confounding factors."
https://openalex.org/W2551284882,"Induction of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) has therapeutic importance for patients with beta-hemoglobin disorders. Previous studies showed that let-7 microRNAs (miRNAs) are highly regulated in erythroid cells during the fetal-to-adult developmental transition, and that targeting let-7 mediated the up-regulation of HbF to greater than 30% of the total globin levels in human adult cultured erythroblasts. HMGA2 is a member of the high-mobility group A family of proteins and a validated target of the let-7 family of miRNAs. Here we investigate whether expression of HMGA2 directly regulates fetal hemoglobin in adult erythroblasts. Let-7 resistant HMGA2 expression was studied after lentiviral transduction of CD34(+) cells. The transgene was regulated by the erythroid-specific gene promoter region of the human SPTA1 gene (HMGA2-OE). HMGA2-OE caused significant increases in gamma-globin mRNA expression and HbF to around 16% of the total hemoglobin levels compared to matched control transductions. Interestingly, no significant changes in KLF1, SOX6, GATA1, ZBTB7A and BCL11A mRNA levels were observed. Overall, our data suggest that expression of HMGA2, a downstream target of let-7 miRNAs, causes moderately increased gamma-globin gene and protein expression in adult human erythroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2550816551,"Although Escherichia coli K1 strains are benign commensals in adults, their acquisition at birth by the newborn may result in life-threatening systemic infections, most commonly sepsis and meningitis. Key features of these infections, including stable gastrointestinal (GI) colonization and age-dependent invasion of the bloodstream, can be replicated in the neonatal rat. We previously increased the capacity of a septicemia isolate of E. coli K1 to elicit systemic infection following colonization of the small intestine by serial passage through two-day-old (P2) rat pups. The passaged strain, A192PP (belonging to sequence type 95), induces lethal infection in all pups fed 2–6 x 106 CFU. Here we use whole-genome sequencing to identify mutations responsible for the threefold increase in lethality between the initial clinical isolate and the passaged derivative. Only four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), in genes (gloB, yjgV, tdcE) or promoters (thrA) involved in metabolic functions, were found: no changes were detected in genes encoding virulence determinants associated with the invasive potential of E. coli K1. The passaged strain differed in carbon source utilization in comparison to the clinical isolate, most notably its inability to metabolize glucose for growth. Deletion of each of the four genes from the E. coli A192PP chromosome altered the proteome, reduced the number of colonizing bacteria in the small intestine and increased the number of P2 survivors. This work indicates that changes in metabolic potential lead to increased colonization of the neonatal GI tract, increasing the potential for translocation across the GI epithelium into the systemic circulation."

We investigated heart rate variability in a group of small children with height below the third percentile, who experienced an episode of early life stress due to heart failure or intra uterine growth retardation. These children appear to develop autonomic dysfunction in later life.Compared to the healthy control group heart rate variability (HRV) is reduced on average in a group of 101 children with short stature. Low HRV correlates to groups of children born small for gestational age (SGA), children with cardiac growth failure and children with congenital syndromes, but not to those with constitutional growth delay (CGD), who had normal HRV. Reduced HRV indicated by lower RMSSD and High Frequency (HF)-Power is indicating reduced vagal activity as a sign of autonomic imbalance.It is not short stature itself, but rather the underlying diseases that are the cause for reduced HRV in children with height below the third percentile. These high risk children-allocated in the groups with an adverse autonomic imprinting in utero or infancy (SGA, congenital heart disease and congenital syndromes)-have the highest risk for 'stress diseases' such as cardiovascular disease in later life.

https://openalex.org/W2549191653,"Background The prognostic role of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in patients with lung adenocarcinomas remains controversial and the association between EGFR mutations and stage at the time of the initial diagnosis is debatable. In this study, we evaluated the association of EGFR mutations with stage at diagnosis in lung adenocarcinomas. Materials and Methods We retrospectively analyzed 1004 consecutive patients who were diagnosed with lung adenocarcinomas and tested for EGFR mutations between June 2011 and December 2014. Results EGFR mutations were detected in 49.2% of 1004 patients with lung adenocarcinomas. In multivariable analysis, EGFR mutations were significantly associated with early stage disease (stage I to II) at diagnosis (odds ratio [OR], 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49–0.87; P = 0.003). When adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, and screening, the adjusted proportion of EGFR mutations significantly decreased according to stage. The adjusted proportions of EGFR mutations were 57.6% (95% CI, 51.7%–63.3%) for stage I, 47.9% (95% CI, 36.9%–59.0%) for stage II, 47.5% (95% CI, 39.6%–55.5%) for stage III, and 43.4% (95% CI, 38.3%–48.6%) for stage IV (P = 0.0082). Conclusions The presence of EGFR mutations is significantly associated with early stage disease at initial diagnosis in lung adenocarcinomas after adjusting for age, sex, smoking status, and screening. This finding implies that EGFR mutations may play a role as a positive prognostic marker."
https://openalex.org/W2552603209,"QuantiFERON-TB-Gold (QFT-G) conversion is frequently observed in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients receiving biologic therapy. However, there have not been any known biomarkers available for detecting tuberculosis (TB) in QFT-G converters. We aimed to evaluate clinical utility of cytokines/chemokines for detecting TB in patients with QFT-G conversion. Among a total of 227 RA patients who underwent QFT-G assay, 187 QFT-G-negative patients received biologic therapy without isoniazid prophylaxis. QFT-G assay was repeated at week 52 of biologic therapy or at the time of TB diagnosis. Levels of cytokines/chemokines were determined by magnetic bead array or ELISA in QFT-G converters and 12 non-RA patients with TB (non-RA TB). QFT-G conversion was found in 54 (28.9%) of 187 baseline QFT-G-negative patients, of which 7 (13.0%) developed active TB during the one-year follow-up period. Among the examined cytokines/chemokines, non-stimulated and TB-antigen-stimulated neopterin levels were significantly higher in RA patients who developed TB (RA-TB) (median, 24.5pg/ml and 23053pg/ml, respectively) and non-RA TB patients (12.2pg/ml and 9633pg/ml, respectively) compared with QFT-G converters without TB (3.0pg/ml and 2720pg/ml, respectively, both p<0.001). Rising levels of neopterin relative to baseline (non-stimulated levels, 4.4pg/ml vs. 24.5pg/ml; TB-antigen-stimulated levels, 1801pg/ml vs. 23053pg/ml) were observed in QFT-G converters who developed TB. A high proportion (85.7%) of QFT-G converters with high plasma neopterin levels developed TB during the one-year follow-up period. In conclusion, RA patients with QFT-G conversion during the period of biologic therapy should be carefully monitored for elevation of neopterin levels, which is associated with TB risk in QFT-G converters, particularly in TB-endemic areas."
https://openalex.org/W2556008352,"Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is the main source of inducible prostaglandin E2 production and mediates inflammatory symptoms including fever, loss of appetite and hyperalgesia. COX-1 is dispensable for fever, anorexia and hyperalgesia but is important for several other functions both under basal conditions and during inflammation. The differential functionality of the COX isoforms could be due to differences in the regulatory regions of the genes, leading to different expression patterns, or to differences in the coding sequence, resulting in distinct functional properties of the proteins. To study the molecular underpinnings of the functional differences between the two isoforms in the context of inflammatory symptoms, we used mice in which the coding sequence of COX-2 was replaced by the corresponding sequence of COX-1. In these mice, COX-1 mRNA was induced by inflammation but COX-1 protein expression did not fully mimic inflammation-induced COX-2 expression. Just like mice globally lacking COX-2, these mice showed a complete lack of fever and inflammation-induced anorexia as well as an impaired response to inflammatory pain. However, as previously reported, they displayed close to normal survival rates, which contrasts to the high fetal mortality in COX-2 knockout mice. This shows that the COX activity generated from the hybrid gene was strong enough to allow survival but not strong enough to mediate the inflammatory symptoms studied, making the line an interesting alternative to COX-2 knockouts for the study of inflammation. Our results also show that the functional differences between COX-1 and COX-2 in the context of inflammatory symptoms are not only dependent on the features of the promoter regions. Instead they indicate that there are fundamental differences between the isoforms at translational or posttranslational levels."
https://openalex.org/W2552335329,"Asthma is one of the most common respiratory diseases in the world. Research has shown that temporal increases in air pollution concentrations can aggravate asthma symptoms. The aim of this study was to assess whether individuals living in areas with higher air pollution concentrations responded differently to short-term temporal exposure to air pollution than those living in lower air pollution areas.The study was designed as a case-crossover study in Scania, Sweden. Outcome data was visits to primary health care clinics with asthma as the main complaint during the years 2007 to 2010. Nitrogen dioxide levels were obtained from 21 different air pollution monitoring stations. Short-term exposure was defined as the average concentration four days prior to the visit. Data was pooled for areas above and below a two-year average NO2 concentration of 10 μg/m3, dispersion modelled with an emission database.The short-term association between NO2 and asthma visits seemed stronger in areas with NO2 levels below 10 μg/m3, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.15 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08-1.23) associated with a 10 μg/m3 increase in NO2 compared to areas above 10 μg/m3 NO2 levels, where corresponding OR of 1.09 (95% CI: 1.02-1.17). However, this difference was not statistically significant. (p = 0.13).The study provided some evidence, although not statistically significant, that short-term associations between air pollution and asthma may depend on background air pollution levels. However, we cannot rule out that the association is due to other spatially dependent factors in Scania. The study should be reproduced in other study areas."

However, an optimized protocol would be required to determine mis-matched donor HLA specificities in view of the scarcity of DNA obtained in some cases. Methods In this study, fresh early morning urine specimens were obtained from 155 kidney transplant recipients with known donor HLA phenotype. DNA was extracted and typing of HLA-A, B and DRB1 loci by polymerase chain reaction-specific sequence primers was performed using tailor-made condition according to the concentration of extracted DNA. Results HLA typing of DNA extracted from urine revealed both recipient and donor HLA phenotypes, allowing the deduction of the unknown donor HLA and hence the degree of HLA mis-match. By adopting the modified procedures, mis-matched donor HLA phenotypes were successfully deduced in all of 35 tested urine samples at DNA quantities spanning the range of 620–24,000 ng. Conclusions This urine-based method offers a promising and reliable non-invasive means for the identification of mis-matched donor HLA antigens in kidney transplant recipients with unknown donor HLA phenotype or otherwise inadequate donor information."
https://openalex.org/W2551634237,"The genome of many species in the biosphere is a diploid consisting of paternal and maternal haplotypes. The differences between these two haplotypes range from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to large-scale structural variations (SVs). Existing genome assemblers for next-generation sequencing platforms attempt to reconstruct one consensus sequence, which is a mosaic of two parental haplotypes. Reconstructing paternal and maternal haplotypes is an important task in linkage analysis and association studies. This study designs and implemented HapSVAssembler on the basis of Genetic Algorithm (GA) and paired-end sequencing. The proposed method builds a consensus sequence, identifies various types of heterozygous variants, and reconstructs the paternal and maternal haplotypes by solving an optimization problem with a GA algorithm. Experimental results indicate that the HapSVAssembler has high accuracy and contiguity under various sequencing coverage, error rates, and insert sizes. The program is tested on pilot sequencing of a highly heterozygous genome, and 12,781 heterozygous SNPs and 602 hemizygous SVs are identified. We observe that, although the number of SVs is much less than that of SNPs, the genomic regions occupied by SVs are much larger, implying the heterozygosity computed using SNPs or k-mer spectrum may be under-estimated."
https://openalex.org/W2555106065,"In this study we provide evidence that the spindle matrix protein Skeletor in Drosophila interacts with the human ASCIZ (also known as ATMIN and ZNF822) ortholog, Digitor/dASCIZ. This interaction was first detected in a yeast two-hybrid screen and subsequently confirmed by pull-down assays. We also confirm a previously documented function of Digitor/dASCIZ as a regulator of Dynein light chain/Cut up expression. Using transgenic expression of a mCitrine-labeled Digitor construct, we show that Digitor/dASCIZ is a nuclear protein that is localized to interband and developmental puff chromosomal regions during interphase but redistributes to the spindle region during mitosis. Its mitotic localization and physical interaction with Skeletor suggest the possibility that Digitor/dASCIZ plays a direct role in mitotic progression as a member of the spindle matrix complex. Furthermore, we have characterized a P-element insertion that is likely to be a true null Digitor/dASCIZ allele resulting in complete pupal lethality when homozygous, indicating that Digitor/dASCIZ is an essential gene. Phenotypic analysis of the mutant provided evidence that Digitor/dASCIZ plays critical roles in regulation of metamorphosis and organogenesis as well as in the DNA damage response. In the Digitor/dASCIZ null mutant larvae there was greatly elevated levels of γH2Av, indicating accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks. Furthermore, reduced levels of Digitor/dASCIZ decreased the resistance to paraquat-induced oxidative stress resulting in increased mortality in a stress test paradigm. We show that an early developmental consequence of the absence of Digitor/dASCIZ is reduced third instar larval brain size although overall larval development appeared otherwise normal at this stage. While Digitor/dASCIZ mutant larvae initiate pupation, all mutant pupae failed to eclose and exhibited various defects in metamorphosis such as impaired differentiation, incomplete disc eversion, and faulty apoptosis. Altogether we provide evidence that Digitor/dASCIZ is a nuclear protein that performs multiple roles in Drosophila larval and pupal development."

We show here that the arylacridine byproduct with distinct optical characteristics cannot be efficiently separated from the major product by HPLC or electrophoretic methods, which hampers precise physicochemical experiments with the labeled oligonucleotides. Studies of the transformation mechanism allowed us to select optimal conditions for avoiding the side reaction. The novel method for the post-synthetic deblocking of hexachlorofluorescein-labeled oligodeoxyribonucleotides described in this paper prevents the formation of the arylacridine derivative, enhances the yield of target oligomers, and allows them to be proper real-time PCR probes."
https://openalex.org/W2553809054,"Previous studies on influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs) that had adapted to growth in embryonated chicken eggs by the acquisition of amino acid substitutions at HA positions 222 or 223 showed that improved protein yield could be conferred by additional amino acid substitutions in the haemagglutinin (HA) that arose naturally during passaging of the virus in eggs. In this study we investigated, by means of reverse genetics, the ability of a non-egg adapted (cell-like) A(H1N1)pdm09 virus to egg-adapt at HA loci other than 222/223, introducing amino acid substitutions previously identified as egg adaptations in pre-H1N1pdm09 H1N1 viruses and assessing their effect on protein yield and antigenicity. We also investigated the effect on the protein yield of these substitutions in viruses that had A(H1N1)pdm09 internal genes rather than the traditional PR8 internal genes of a CVV. The data show that a cell-like A/Christchurch/16/2010 can be egg-adapted via amino acid substitutions in at least three alternative HA loci (187, 190 and 216), in viruses with either PR8 or A/California/7/2009 internal genes, but that the effects on protein yield vary depending on the amino acid substitution and the internal genes of the virus. Since CVVs need to produce high protein yields to be suitable for vaccine manufacture, the findings of this study will assist in the future characterisation of both wild type viruses and lab-derived CVVs for vaccine use."
https://openalex.org/W2554942475,"Donor safety and preservation of donor health after living liver donation are of paramount importance. Diarrhea has a significant influence on gastrointestinal quality of life among donors who have undergone living donor hepatectomy. Thus, we aimed to investigate predictors of diarrhea after hepatectomy and its impact on gastrointestinal quality of life in living donors.We retrospectively examined the medical records of 204 living liver donors who underwent hepatectomy during the period January 2010 to June 2013 at a single medical center. Diarrhea was defined as the passing of three or more liquid stools per day. The Chinese version of the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) was used to assess the influence of diarrhea on quality of life in donors.During the study period, diarrhea was diagnosed in 62 (30.3%) of the 204 donors and the duration of diarrhea in the majority of them (n = 46, 74%) was <12 months. Risk factors associated with diarrhea included age [risk ratio (RR) = 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.79-0.89, risk difference = 16%], and chronic cholecystitis (RR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.24-0.99, risk difference = 52%). Compared to donors without diarrhea, donors with diarrhea had lower GIQLI scores in the following GIQLI domains: GI symptoms (1.8 vs. 3.6), physical function (2.1 vs. 3.5), emotional function (3.0 vs. 3.6), social function (3.3 vs. 3.7), and treatment reaction (2.6 vs. 3.7).Our findings show that younger donors and those without chronic cholecystitis are at increased risk for diarrhea after living donor hepatectomy and that diarrhea is associated with lower GIQLI scores after hepatectomy."
https://openalex.org/W2555340375,"The main purpose of this study is to propose, then analyze, and later test a spectral gradient algorithm for solving a convex minimization problem. The considered problem covers the matrix ℓ2,1-norm regularized least squares which is widely used in multi-task learning for capturing the joint feature among each task. To solve the problem, we firstly minimize a quadratic approximated model of the objective function to derive a search direction at current iteration. We show that this direction descends automatically and reduces to the original spectral gradient direction if the regularized term is removed. Secondly, we incorporate a nonmonotone line search along this direction to improve the algorithm's numerical performance. Furthermore, we show that the proposed algorithm converges to a critical point under some mild conditions. The attractive feature of the proposed algorithm is that it is easily performable and only requires the gradient of the smooth function and the objective function's values at each and every step. Finally, we operate some experiments on synthetic data, which verifies that the proposed algorithm works quite well and performs better than the compared ones."
https://openalex.org/W2552561535,"To develop a general model that utilises a stochastic method to generate a vessel tree based on experimental data, and an associated irregular, macroscopic tumour. These will be used to evaluate two different methods for computing oxygen distribution.A vessel tree structure, and an associated tumour of 127 cm3, were generated, using a stochastic method and Bresenham's line algorithm to develop trees on two different scales and fusing them together. The vessel dimensions were adjusted through convolution and thresholding and each vessel voxel was assigned an oxygen value. Diffusion and consumption were modelled using a Green's function approach together with Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The computations were performed using a combined tree method (CTM) and an individual tree method (ITM). Five tumour sub-sections were compared, to evaluate the methods.The oxygen distributions of the same tissue samples, using different methods of computation, were considerably less similar (root mean square deviation, RMSD≈0.02) than the distributions of different samples using CTM (0.001< RMSD<0.01). The deviations of ITM from CTM increase with lower oxygen values, resulting in ITM severely underestimating the level of hypoxia in the tumour. Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) tests showed that millimetre-scale samples may not represent the whole.The stochastic model managed to capture the heterogeneous nature of hypoxic fractions and, even though the simplified computation did not considerably alter the oxygen distribution, it leads to an evident underestimation of tumour hypoxia, and thereby radioresistance. For a trustworthy computation of tumour oxygenation, the interaction between adjacent microvessel trees must not be neglected, why evaluation should be made using high resolution and the CTM, applied to the entire tumour."
