https://openalex.org/W1979014608,"Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) is a unique CDK, the activity of which can be detected in postmitotic neurons. To date, CDK5 purified from mammalian brains has always been associated with a truncated form of the 35-kDa major brain specific activator (p35, also known as nck5a) of CDK5, known as p25. In this study, we report that p35 can be cleaved to p25 both in vitro and in vivo by calpain. In a rat brain extract, p35 was cleaved to p25 by incubation with Ca2+. This cleavage was inhibited by a calpain inhibitor peptide derived from calpastatin and was ablated by separating the p35·CDK5 from calpain by centrifugation. The p35 recovered in the pellet after centrifugation could then be cleaved to p25 by purified calpain. Cleavage of p35 was also induced in primary cultured neurons by treatment with a Ca2+ ionophore and Ca2+ and inhibited by calpain inhibitor I. The cleavage changed the solubility of the CDK5 active complex from the particulate fraction to the soluble fraction but did not affect the histone H1 kinase activity. Increased cleavage was detected in cultured neurons undergoing cell death, suggesting a role of the cleavage in neuronal cell death.

The major CDK5 activator in the brain is p35 (also termed nck5a) (9.Tsai L-H. Delalle I. Caviness V.S. Chae T. Harlow E.

As a deficiency of CDK5 or p35 results in a reversed layer formation of cortical neurons in the cerebrum or a defect in the formation of the cortical laminar structure in the cerebellum (13.Ohshima T.

However, CDK5 does not need to be phosphorylated to regulate kinase activity. Even though the phosphorylation sites for both activation and inhibition of this protein have been conserved (3.Lee K-Y.

Cyclins are periodically synthesized and degraded during the cell cycle (1.Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2920) Google Scholar, 2.Nigg E.A. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar), but the neuronal activities involved in the synthesis and degradation of p35 are unknown.CDK5 appears to be involved in the migration or positioning of neuronal cells via phosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins (20.Nikolic M.

Several of these cytoskeletal substrates (microtubule-associated protein tau, the high and middle molecular weight subunits of neurofilaments (NF-H and NF-M), and synapsin I) have been identified (23.Ishiguro K.

This is supported by the following observations: (i) CDK5 was purified from microtubule-enriched fractions of bovine and porcine brain extracts (23.Ishiguro K. Takamatsu M. Tomizawa K. Omori A.

Rosales J.L. Tang D. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1538-1543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar); (iii) using the yeast two-hybrid system, p35 bound to neurofilaments and α-actinin (20.Nikolic M. Dudek H. Kwon Y.T. Ramos Y.F. Tsai L.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 32.Qi Z. Tang D. Zhu X. Fujita D.J. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2329-2335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); and (iv) immunofluorescent staining of cultured neurons suggested an association of p35 with actin filaments in growth cone (20.Nikolic M. Dudek H. Kwon Y.T. Ramos Y.F. Tsai L.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). However, how the active complex of p35·CDK5 targets cytoskeletal structures remains to be determined.Several studies have shown that kinase active CDK5 purified from porcine or bovine brains complexes with p25 but not with p35 (23.Ishiguro K. Takamatsu M. Tomizawa K. Omori A. Takahashi M. Arioka M. Uchida T. Imahori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10897-10901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Hisanaga S. Uchiyama M. Hosoi T. Yamada K. Honma N. Ishiguro K. Uchida T. Dahl D. Ohsumi K. Kishimoto T. Cell. Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1955; 31: 283-297Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar,33.Lew J. Beaudette K. Litwin C.M.E. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13383-13390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), even though p35 predominates in the brain (9.Tsai L-H. Delalle I. Caviness V.S. Chae T. Harlow E. Nature. 1994; 371: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar, 10.Lew J. Wang J.H. Nature. 1994; 371: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 12.Uchida T. Ishiguro K. Ohnuma J. Takamatsu M. Yonekura S. Imahori K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). CDK5 has been purified from the spinal cord of rats, but the activator associated with it has not been shown (27.Shetty K.T. Link W.T. Pant H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6844-6848Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Thus, the p35·CDK5 complex has never been purified from mammalian brains, probably because p35 degrades to p25 during purification rather than p25·CDK5 being the active form of CDK5. If p35·CDK5 is active in neurons, it is essential to examine the properties of CDK5 when it is associated with p35. To purify the p35·CDK5 complex, it may be critical to determine why p35 is easily degraded to p25 during purification.We tried to isolate p35·CDK5 from rat brains that had been homogenized immediately after the rats were decapitated. After fractionation through a hydroxyapatite column composed of calcium phosphate, we found that p35 was completely converted to p25. We thought that and investigated the possibility that p35 might be cleaved to p25 by the Ca2+-activated protease, calpain, and we found that p35 was degraded to p25 by calpain both in vitroand in vivo. Degradation of p35 to p25 released the kinase active form of CDK5 from the insoluble fraction to the soluble supernatant. Furthermore, we also found that degradation of p35 to p25 occurred in cultured neurons undergoing cell death.DISCUSSIONIn brains, the major form of the CDK5 activator is the 35-kDa protein known as p35 (9.Tsai L-H. Delalle I. Caviness V.S. Chae T. Harlow E. Nature. 1994; 371: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar, 10.Lew J. Wang J.H. Nature. 1994; 371: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 12.Uchida T. Ishiguro K. Ohnuma J. Takamatsu M. Yonekura S. Imahori K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, when CDK5 has been purified from bovine or porcine brains, it has been bound to p25, a 25-kDa activating subunit that is a truncated form of p35 (23.Ishiguro K. Takamatsu M. Tomizawa K. Omori A. Takahashi M. Arioka M. Uchida T. Imahori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10897-10901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Hisanaga S. Uchiyama M. Hosoi T. Yamada K. Honma N. Ishiguro K. Uchida T. Dahl D. Ohsumi K. Kishimoto T. Cell. Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1955; 31: 283-297Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 33.Lew J. Beaudette K. Litwin C.M.E. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13383-13390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In previous studies using the crude extracts of porcine brains as a starting material for CDK5 purification (28.Hisanaga S. Uchiyama M. Hosoi T. Yamada K. Honma N. Ishiguro K. Uchida T. Dahl D. Ohsumi K. Kishimoto T. Cell. Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1955; 31: 283-297Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar), p35 has already been partially cleaved to p25 (data not shown). This might be due to uncontrolled postmortem degradation in the slaughterhouse prior to homogenization of the tissue in the laboratory. Porcine or bovine brain CDK5 has also been purified from soluble supernatants that predominantly contain the p25·CDK5 complex (23.Ishiguro K. Takamatsu M. Tomizawa K. Omori A. Takahashi M. Arioka M. Uchida T. Imahori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10897-10901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Hisanaga S. Uchiyama M. Hosoi T. Yamada K. Honma N. Ishiguro K. Uchida T. Dahl D. Ohsumi K. Kishimoto T. Cell. Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1955; 31: 283-297Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 33.Lew J. Beaudette K. Litwin C.M.E. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13383-13390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations could partially explain why attempts to purify CDK5 have produced only p25·CDK5. We thought it a possibility to use rats' brains to circumvent postmortem degradation. Although the purification of CDK5 from rat neuronal tissue (the spinal cords) was reported, the activation subunit associated with it was not demonstrated (27.Shetty K.T. Link W.T. Pant H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6844-6848Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar).In the present study, in which rat brain homogenates were prepared immediately after decapitation and probed using an anti-p35 antibody, most of the CDK5 activator detected was p35, with only tiny amount of p25. Using either the rat brain extract or cultured neurons, p35 was shown to be proteolytically cleaved to p25 by calpain, both in vivo and in vitro. This cleavage did not affect the kinase activity of CDK5 for histone H1 or dephosphorylated NF-H but changed the solubility of the active CDK5 complex. Whereas the p35·CDK5 complex was present in the pellet after ultracentrifugation, the proteolytic form of p25·CDK5 remained in the supernatant as a soluble form. Stimulated cleavage was also observed in the cultured neurons undergoing cell death.Direct cleavage of p35 to p25 by calpain was indicated by following results. (i) Degradation of p35 to p25 was induced by treatment of the cultured neurons or brain extracts with Ca2+, and in both cases, the Ca2+-induced cleavage was suppressed by calpain inhibitors (Figs. 2 and 4). (ii) Separation of the p35·CDK5 complex from calpain in the brain extract by centrifugation ablated the proteolytic conversion from p35 to p25 (Fig. 3). (iii) p35, prepared by either centrifugation (to remove the calpain) or immunoprecipitation, was proteolysed to p25 by purified calpain in vitro (Fig.3).2 Although this cleavage was only partial, another cytoplasmic protease called the proteasome has recently been shown to completely degrade p35 (18.Patrick G.N. Zhou P. Kwon Y.T. Howley P.M. Tsai L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24057-24064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 19.Saito T. Ishiguro K. Onuki R. Nagai Y. Kishimoto T. Hisanaga S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 775-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the present study, the cleavage of p35 was stimulated at the time of cell death (Fig. 8), when a series of caspases are specifically activated. Although we did not examine cleavage by caspases in detail, caspase-dependent cleavage of p35 is unlikely because the proteolytic consensus sequence for these caspases is the C terminus of Asp (40.Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar). This is distinct from the cleavage site of p35, which is between Phe-98 and Ala-99. Taken together, the results outlined above indicate that p35 is cleaved directly to p25 by calpain.The cleavage of p35 to p25 was increased in cultured neurons undergoing cell death induced by staurosporine treatment or long term cultivation without a change in medium. The involvement of calpain in apoptotic cell death remains a controversial issue. However, calpain activation does appear to play a role in some types of apoptotic cell death (36.Carafoli E. Molinari M. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 37.Wood D.E. Newcomb E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8309-8315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 38.Nath R. Raser K.J. Stafford D. Hajimohammadreza I. Posner A. Allenm H. Talanian R., R.V. Yuen P.-W.

Chem. 1998; 273: 19993-20000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The present study suggests neuronal death induced by long term culture without a change in medium is mediated by apoptosis, as evidenced by TUNEL staining of the neuronal nuclei (although we did not perform further studies to confirm the role of apoptosis). Straurosporine-induced neuronal cell death has been shown to be apoptotic (41.Bertrand R. Solary E. O'Connor P. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 42.Krohn A.J. Preis E. Prehn J.H. J. Neurosci. 1998; 15: 8186-8197Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, our results support the activation of calpain during apoptotic neuronal cell death. To investigate whether the cleavage of p35 is a cause of cell death or results from cell death, we followed cleavage of p35 over a time course relative to the progression of cell death. However, we could not determine the role p35 plays in cell death because, under both experimental conditions, the cleavage occurred almost simultaneously with the appearance of dead neurons. As there have been various reports about the time of activation of calpain in relation to the activation of caspase (36.Carafoli E. Molinari M. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 37.Wood D.E. Newcomb E.W. J. Biol.

If this hypothesis is correct, how can neurons survive when active CDK5, the kinase activity of which is very similar to that of cyclin B/cdc2 kinase, is expressed (28.Hisanaga S. Uchiyama M.

Taking the present results into consideration, the following might become possible: CDK5 could be sequestered to a cytoskeletal or membrane fraction that would limit substrate availability or suppress the kinase activity in living neurons (3.Lee K-Y.

Upon the onset of apoptosis, however, p35 was cleaved to p25 by activated calpain, resulting in the release of active CDK5 from the particulate fraction to the free soluble form that could be accessible to any proteins the phosphorylation of which is harmful for postmitotic neurons. The involvement of CDK5 in neuronal cell death was suggested in a recent report by Philpott et al. (47.Philpott A. Tsai L. Kirschner M.W. Dev. Biol. 1999; 207: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This report showed that overexpression of p35 induced cell death inXenopus embryos. A small amount of p25, which was detected in the present study in brain homogenates prepared immediately after decapitation of rats (Fig. 1), might be generated in apoptotic neurons in the brain. If this is correct, it could be possible to estimate the ratio of neurons undergoing apoptotic cell death by measuring the ratio of p25 to p35.During the revision of this paper, similar results were reported by Patrick et al. (48.Patrick G.N. Zukarberg L. Nikolic M. de la Monta S. Dlkkes P. Tsai L-H. Nature. 1999; 402: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar). They demonstrated the active role of p25·CDK5 in promoting cell death by expressing the p25·CDK5 complex in cultured neurons. Their result that cleavage of p35 to p25 changed subcellular distribution from a membrane bound fraction to a cytosolic fraction agrees well with ours. Moreover, they found accumulation of p25 in brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease and hyperphosphorylation of tau by p25·CDK5. Taken together, these results indicate that calpain could be the protease that cleaves p35 to p25 in pathologically degenerative neurons. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)1 are a group of serine/threonine protein kinases activated by binding to a regulatory subunit cyclin.

Expression of 13 UGT1A and UGT2Bgenes coupled with functional and catalytic analyses were studied using 18 small intestinal and 16 hepatic human tissue samples. Hepatic expression of UGT gene transcripts was without interindividual variation. In contrast, a polymorphic expression pattern of all the UGT genes was demonstrated in duodenal, jejunal, and ileal mucosa, with the exception of UGT1A10.To complement these studies, interindividual expression of UGT proteins and catalytic activities were also demonstrated. Hyodeoxycholic acid glucuronidation, catalyzed primarily by UGT2B4 and UGT2B7, showed a 7-fold interindividual variation in small intestinal duodenal samples, in contrast to limited variation in the presence of 4-methylumbelliferone, a substrate glucuronidated by mostUGT1A and UGT2B gene products. Linkage of RNA expression patterns to protein abundance were also made with several mono-specific antibodies to the UGTs. These results are in contrast to a total absence of polymorphic variation in gene expression, protein abundance, and catalytic activity in liver. In addition, the small intestine exhibits considerable catalytic activity toward most of the different classes of substrates accepted for glucuronidation by the UGTs, which is supported by immunofluorescence analysis of UGT1A protein in the mucosal cell layer of the small intestine.

UGTs are resident in the endoplasmic reticulum and catalyze the conversion of hydrophobic substrates to usually inactive hydrophilic glucuronides, which subsequently undergo renal and biliary elimination. Compounds targeted for glucuronidation include dietary constituents, therapeutic drugs, endogenous metabolites, hormones, and environmental carcinogens. The human UGT genes are differentially regulated in a tissue-specific fashion in hepatic and extrahepatic tissues of the gastrointestinal tract (2Strassburg C.P. Manns M.P. Tukey R.H. J. Biol.

The human UGT1A gene locus is located on chromosome 2, which encodes at least nine functional UGT1A proteins and three pseudogenes (6Burchell B. Brierley C.H. Monaghan G. Clarke D.J. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 335-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Four exons are located at the 3′ end of the UGT1A locus, which are combined with one of a consecutively numbered array of first exon cassettes toward the 5′ end of the gene locus to form individual UGT gene products. Therefore, the amino-terminal 280 amino acids of UGT1A proteins consist of unique exon 1 encoded sequences and the carboxyl-terminal 245 amino acids encoded by exons 2–5 are identical. The tissue-specific expression of the UGT1A gene locus has been well characterized and has been suggested to define tissue-specific glucuronidation activity in the human digestive system (2Strassburg C.P.

The genetic multiplicity of the UGTs and their wide range of substrate specificities suggests that UGTs play an important role in human homeostasis and metabolism. Although hepatic glucuronidation is considered to play a central role in drug metabolism, direct contact with xenobiotic compounds is first established in the gastrointestinal tract prior to resorption (27Strassburg C.P. Nguyen N. Manns M.P. Tukey R.H. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 149-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The small intestine, which extends to a length of 300–400 cm in adults, forms the largest metabolically active external surface of the human digestive system and represents a significant localization for extrahepatic metabolism. The considerable degree of immediate xenobiotic contact in the small intestine including dietary components, drugs, and environmental mutagens would indicate that enzymes located in the mucosal layer are capable of influencing first pass metabolism and may function as a metabolic intestinal barrier. The presented study was undertaken to analyze the regulatory patterns of UGT1A and UGT2B genes in small intestine as a biochemical basis for defining human extrahepatic xenobiotic glucuronidation. Tissue samples were obtained from the Department of Abdominal and Transplant Surgery, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany. Informed written consent was obtained, and the project was approved by the ethics committee of Hannover Medical School. Macroscopically and histologically normal intestinal tissue was obtained from 18 German patients undergoing surgery for diagnoses summarized in TableI. None of the patients received chemotherapy, steroids, diuretics, or antibiotic therapy prior to sample collection. The records indicated the absence of smoking during 6 months prior to surgery. A high degree of sample normalization results from the additional fact that all patients were fasting at least 12 h prior to the surgical procedures and tissue collection. The collected tissues showed no macroscopic signs of deterioration such as necrosis and were microscopically examined to document normal histology. One patient with ulcerative colitis received a colectomy and had no histological signs of ileal disease.

Intact RNA was isolated from hepatic, duodenal, jejunal, and ileal tissue samples and stored in water at −80 °C until further analysis. Three μg of total RNA were denatured for 10 min at 70 °C in the presence of 0.5 μg of oligo(dT) primer and quick chilled on ice. The volume of RNA was adjusted to 19 μl containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm of each dNTP incubated at 42 °C for 5 min prior to the addition of 1 μl (200 U) of reverse transcriptase (SuperscriptII; Life Technologies, Inc.). The final volume (20 μl) was incubated at 42 °C for 50 min and then 70 °C for 15 min and chilled on ice. Contamination of total RNA with genomic DNA was excluded by RT-PCR using primers for human β-actin. The sense primer 5′-ggcggcaccaccatgtaccct-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-aggggccggactcgtcatact-3′ span the exon 4/intron 5/exon 5 junction of the β-actin gene. PCR with cDNA leads to a 202-bp product, but contamination with genomic DNA template would lead to a 312-bp PCR product, which can be clearly distinguished from the 202-bp cDNA amplification product. Approximately 300 mg of intestinal tissue was pulverized under liquid nitrogen, resuspended in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 10 mm MgCl2, and homogenized with a Potter-Elvehjam tissue grinder. The tissue homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C in an Eppendorf (Hamburg, Germany) microcentrifuge, and the supernatant was collected. The pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 10 mm MgCl2 and centrifuged, and the supernatant collected. The combined supernatants were centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C in a Beckman (Palo Alto, CA) TL100 ultracentrifuge, and the pellet was resuspended in 0.2 ml of Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 10 mm MgCl2. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford. Microsomal protein was stored at −80 °C. Glucuronidation substrates (all 18 tested substrates are listed in the legend to Fig. 3) were solubilized in methanol with the exception of 7-hydroxy-benzo(α)pyrene, which was resuspended in acetone. 7-Hydroxy-benzo(α)pyrene, 3-hydroxy-acetylaminofluorene, and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo-(4,5-β)-pyridine (PhIP) were obtained from the National Cancer Institute Chemical Carcinogen Repository (Midwest Research Institute, Kansas City, MO); 2-hydroxyamino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo-(4,5-β)-pyridine (N-hydroxy-PhIP) was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc. (Toronto, Canada); and all other substrates were from Sigma-Aldrich. Catalytic activities of 25 μg of microsomal protein isolated from intestinal or hepatic tissue were assayed in duplicate as described previously in detail (3Strassburg C.P. Strassburg A. Nguyen N. Li Q. Manns M.P. Tukey R.H. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Protein was precipitated, and supernatants were lyophilized and resuspended in methanol prior to separation by thin layer liquid chromatography inn-butanol/acetone/acidic acid/water (35:35:10:20%). The production of 14C-labeled glucuronides was detected by autoradiography. To determine specific catalytic activities, the14C-labeled glucuronides were quantitated using a Fujifilm BAS-1000 phosphoimager (Raytest GmbH, Straubenhardt, Germany) and TINA 2.0 software (Raytest GmbH) and expressed as pmol glucuronide formed/min/mg of microsomal or recombinant protein. As a control, autoradiography hard copies were additionally analyzed with a GS-710 calibrated imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad) using the Quantity One software package. The presence of UGT1A and UGT2B transcripts in total tissue RNA was analyzed by PCR amplification performed as a duplex RT-PCR coamplification with β-actin cDNA as a control, as outlined below. The UGT1A locus predicts the existence of nine proteins termed UGT1A1 and UGT1A3–1A10. UGT1A2, UGT1A11 and UGT1A12 lack an uninterrupted open reading frame and have therefore been identified to be pseudogenes. DRT-PCR detection of all nine UGT1A transcripts predicted by the human UGT1A locus was performed using nine exon 1-specific sense primers and two antisense primers located within exons 2–5 or within a common portion of the 3′ end of the first exons (4Strassburg C.P. Oldhafer K. Manns M.P. Tukey R.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). As already reported elsewhere (4Strassburg C.P. Oldhafer K. Manns M.P. Tukey R.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), exon-specific primers were generated that lead to RT-PCR products of distinct molecular sizes: UGT1A1, 644 bp; UGT1A3, 483 bp; UGT1A4, 572 bp; UGT1A5, 659 bp; UGT1A6, 562 bp; UGT1A7, 754 bp; UGT1A8, 514 bp; UGT1A9, 392 bp; and UGT1A10, 478 bp. Coamplification of UGT1A first exon and β-actin sequences was performed using three cycling protocols: for UGT1A1 and UGT1A6, 94 °C for 1 min, 59 °C for1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min; for UGT1A3, UGT1A4, and UGT1A5, 94 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min; and for UGT1A7, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, and UGT1A10, 94 °C for 1 min, 64 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. Each protocol was preceded by a 3-min incubation of the reaction mixture at 94 °C and followed by a 7-min elongation at 72 °C. The specificity and kinetics of this assay have previously been documented in detail (4Strassburg C.P. Oldhafer K. Manns M.P. Tukey R.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed in duplicate, and controls without cDNA, primers, or thermophilic polymerase were included. Specific primer pairs were generated for the amplification of UGT2B4, UGT2B7, UGT2B10, and UGT2B15 sequences, respectively, as recently reported elsewhere (3Strassburg C.P. Strassburg A. Nguyen N. Li Q. Manns M.P. Tukey R.H. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Cross-reactivity was excluded using sequence alignments and PCGene (Oxford Molecular, Campbell, CA) software, as well as a computerized data bank search using the blastn software (GenBankTM). UGT2B cDNA was coamplified with β-actin cDNA in a starting volume of 92 μl containing 10 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 10 mm ammonium sulfate, 2 mm magnesium sulfate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm each dNTP, and 2 μmof UGT2B primers and VENT (exo-) DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). After a hot start at 94 °C for 3 min, six cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 57 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s were run on a Perkin-Elmer GeneAmp PCR 2400 system. The same β-actin primers used for UGT1A DRT-PCR were added to 0.4 μm each, and cycling was resumed for a total of 32 cycles. Specificity of this assay was determined by PCR using all four primer pairs on each cloned UGT2B4, UGT2B7, UGT2B10, and UGT2B15 template cDNA to exclude cross-reactivities. PCR products of the expected sizes were generated: UGT2B4, 281 bp; UGT2B7, 407 bp; UGT2B10, 388 bp; and UGT2B15, 330 bp. To confirm the detection of specific UGT1A and UGT2B cDNAs using this assay, the PCR products were partially sequenced to document the identity of the specific gene product. Twenty μg of microsomal protein from five human duodenal and five human hepatic tissues samples was boiled for 90 s in loading buffer (2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 62.5 mmol/liter Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, and 0.001% bromphenol blue) with β-mercaptoethanol and resolved by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis prior to electrotransfer onto nitrocellulose membrane. As controls, a 5-μg sample of total Sf9 cell lysate expressing recombinant UGT1A1 and UGT2B7 protein as well as Sf9 cells expressiong no recombinant UGT protein were included (3Strassburg C.P. Strassburg A. Nguyen N. Li Q. Manns M.P. Tukey R.H. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Immunodetection was performed following published protocols (28Strassburg C.P. Kasai Y. Seng B.A. Miniou P. Zaloudik J. Herlyn D. Koprowski H. Linnenbach A.J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 815-821PubMed Google Scholar). UGT1A1 and UGT2B7 protein was detected using a monospecific rabbit anti-human UGT1A1 and rabbit anti-human UGT2B7 antibody purchased from NatuTec/Gentest (Frankfurt, Germany) at a dilution of 1:1500. Visualization was achieved with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) diluted 1:4000. Fresh intestinal resection specimens were subjected to cryostat sectioning following previously published methods (29Strassburg C.P. Alex B. Zindy F. Gerken G. Luttig B. Meyer zum Buschenfelde K.H. Brechot C. Manns M.P. J. Hepatol. 1996; 25: 859-866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Tissue sections were used for indirect immunofluorescence using a previously described rabbit anti-peptide (SSLHKDRPVEPLDLA) anti-human UGT1A antibody, which was generated using branched lysine multiple antigen peptide technology (2Strassburg C.P. Manns M.P. Tukey R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8719-8726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Antibody was diluted 1:20, 1:40, 1:80, and 1:160 in phosphate buffered saline without magnesium or calcium (PBS), and immobilized tissue slices were incubated at room temperature in a humidified chamber for 60 min. Incubation with a normal rabbit serum was included as a control. Following two wash steps with PBS, the slides were incubated at room temperature in a humidified, dark chamber for 60 min with fluorescein (dichlorotriazinyl-aminofluoresceine)-conjugated affinity purified goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) diluted 1:100 in PBS. Following two wash steps with PBS, tissue slices were covered with glycerol containing 10% PBS and were immediately analyzed using an Olympus IMT 2 immunofluorescence microscope (Tokyo, Japan). UGT mRNA expression was analyzed by isoform-specific DRT-PCR (Fig. 1 and Table II, right column). The liver was characterized by the expression of UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, UGT2B4, UGT2B7, UGT2B10, and UGT2B15 mRNA, as previously demonstrated (3Strassburg C.P. Strassburg A.

In the 16 different liver samples, there was little variation in abundance of the RNA transcripts when each was compared with the levels of expression of actin (not shown but previously demonstrated in Ref. 14Strassburg C.P. Nguyen N. Manns M.P. Tukey R.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 647-654PubMed Google Scholar). This is in sharp contrast to intestinal tissue, which exhibited dramatic differences inUGT gene transcript expression. Intestinal expression was characterized by the presence or absence of UGT1A and UGT2B transcripts in the different samples of intestinal tissue. Analyses of 13 different UGT transcripts demonstrated that UGT1A10 mRNA was expressed in each sample of duodenal, jejunal, and ileal mucosa, whereas UGT2B15 was absent in only two of the duodenal samples. UGT1A3 and UGT1A4 were found to be expressed in the majority of duodenal, jejunal and ileal mucosa samples. In contrast, UGT1A5, UGT1A7, UGT1A8, and UGT1A9 transcripts were not detected, and UGT2B10 was found in only one of the ileum preparations. It is interesting to note that in the ileum sample in which UGT2B10 RNA was expressed, all of the other UGT2B gene products were also detected (Fig. 1,bottom panel). The appearance of UGT1A1, UGT1A6, UGT2B4, and UGT2B7 mRNA showed the most dramatic variability between the different intestinal samples. In the duodenum, UGT1A1 was detected in three of the five samples examined, UGT1A6 was in four of the five samples, UGT2B4 was in one of the five samples, and UGT2B7 was in two of the five samples. The ratios of these gene products were found to be similar in the jejunum, although UGT1A6 mRNA was only detected in one sample. In the ileum, UGT2B4 was detected in a greater number of samples than found in the duodenum and jejunum, demonstrating that UGT2B4 is not l"

We conclude that the major physiological role of the CYP7B1 oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase is to metabolize 25- and 27-hydroxycholesterol and that loss of this enzyme in the liver is compensated for by increases in the synthesis of bile acids by other pathways. A failure to catabolize oxysterols in the male kidney may lead to a decrease in <i>de novo</i> sterol synthesis."

A pleckstrin homology domain adjacent to the catalytic Dbl homology domain via an unknown mechanism mediates the effects of phosphoinositides on guanine nucleotide exchange activity. Here we tested the possibility that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase substrates and products control an interaction between the pleckstrin homology domain and the Dbl homology domain, thereby explaining the inhibitory effects of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase substrates and stimulatory effects of the products.

Nearly all known Dbl-related GEFs have a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain on the C-terminal side of the catalytic domain (Dbl homology (DH) domain) responsible for GEF function suggestive of an integrated function of the tandem DH-PH domains (2.Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Recent reports have indicated that phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase products binding to the PH domain activate the GEF activity of Vav and Sos1 (3.Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y.

In addition to the control by PI 3-kinase, Vav is also under the control of a Src-related tyrosine kinase activity (5.Ma A.D. Metjian A. Bagrodia S. Taylor S. Abrams C.S. Mol. Cell.

Panayotou G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 165-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). These include enzymes involved in regulation of the Ras and Rac families of GTPases, serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases, regulators of lipid second messengers, and GTPases (8.Bottomley M.J. Salim K. Panayotou G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 165-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Many PH domains interact with phosphoinositides, some binding predominantly to the PI 3-kinase substrate, phosphatidylinositol (PI)-4,5-P2, whereas others bind PI 3-kinase products with higher affinities than the substrate (9.Kavran J.M.

The high affinities of these PH domains for phosphoinositides are thought to anchor the proteins to membranes rich in the phosphoinositides to which they bind (8.Bottomley M.J. Salim K. Panayotou G.

Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Indeed, several PH domain-containing proteins that are normally found in the cytoplasm translocate to plasma membranes upon receptor stimulation that changes the phosphoinositide composition of these membranes (8.Bottomley M.J. Salim K. Panayotou G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 165-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 9.Kavran J.M. Klein D.E. Lee A. Falasca M. Isakoff J.F. Skolnik E.F. J. Biol.

Thus, some PH domains play a role in cellular regulation by translocating enzymes to membranes containing their substrates and regulators. However, in addition to translocating enzymes to membranes, PH domains may also confer allosteric regulation of enzymatic activities in response to changes in phosphoinositides. Studies of the Vav PH domain have failed to find evidence for a role in regulating recruitment to membranes (5.Ma A.D. Metjian A. Bagrodia S. Taylor S. Abrams C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4744-4751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, biochemical evidence suggests the PH domain of the Vav GEF could affect allosteric regulation of the adjacent catalytic DH domain (3.Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R. Murali Krishna U. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 4.Nimnual A.S. Yatsula B.A. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies using water-soluble derivatives of phosphoinositides and purified Vav and Rac found that C8-PI-4,5-P2 potently inhibits Vav GEF activity whereas C8-PI-3,4,5-P3 activates GEF activity (3.Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R. Murali Krishna U. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). It is unlikely these results reflect the activation of GEF activity by concentrating enzyme and substrate onto the surface of lipid vesicles. First, these water-soluble phosphoinositides do not readily form lipid vesicles. Second, these studies usedEscherichia coli expressed Rac protein, which lacks the fatty acid modification necessary for efficient membrane association. A phosphoinositide-induced conformational change in Vav is also suggested by the enhanced Lck-dependent phosphorylation of Vav in the presence of C8-PI-3,4,5-P3 (3.Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R. Murali Krishna U. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Although the role of the Vav PH domain in regulating catalytic activity can be argued to be an allosteric effect, direct evidence supporting this has not been reported. We sought to define the mechanism by which phosphoinositides regulate Vav and Sos1 function. We find that isolated protein fragments encompassing the PH domains of Sos1 or Vav when bound to the GEF inhibitor, C8-PI-4,5-P2, bind to purified DH fragments of Sos1 and Vav, respectively. However, when these PH domains are bound with the GEF activator, C8-PI-3,4,5-P3, they bind their respective DH fragments significantly less well. Fragments of these exchange factors encompassing both the DH and PH domains bind to Rac proteins in the presence of PI-3,4,5-P3, but not in the presence of PI-4,5-P2. Binding analysis also reveals that Lck phosphorylation of the isolated DH domain of Vav reduces its ability to bind to an isolated Vav(PH) fragment. The results presented here provide direct evidence that a PH domain can affect the allosteric regulation of an enzymatic activity. This regulation involves the inhibitory effect of intramolecular interactions between the PH and DH domains of the Vav and Sos1 GEFs. PI-4,5-P2 promotes the inhibitory effects of the PH domain, whereas PI-3,4,5-P3disrupts these intramolecular interactions and hence abolishes the inhibitory effects of the PH domain. In addition, Lck phosphorylation of Vav, which is promoted by PI 3-kinase products, destabilizes the inhibitory effects of the PH domain on the DH domain. Previous studies have provided support for a model whereby Vav activation occurs in response to PI 3-kinase and a Src-related kinase (3.Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R. Murali Krishna U. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 5.Ma A.D. Metjian A. Bagrodia S. Taylor S. Abrams C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4744-4751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we extend those studies by examining Vav activation in cells with regard to the molecular events identified by biochemical analysis (Vav phosphorylation, phosphoinositide binding, and GEF activity). We find by analysis of immunoprecipitates from Vav-expressing cells that: 1) phosphorylation of Vav, 2) PI-3,4,5-P3 association with Vav, and 3) Vav GEF activity increase following serum stimulation. Importantly, each of these increases are blocked by pretreatment of cells with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin. The mammalian expression vector for wild-type Vav, pCDNA3 Vav(wt), has been described (3.Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R. Murali Krishna U. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). His-tagged Vav(DH/PH) was expressed from pRSETBVavL, which has been described (7.Han J. Das B. Wei W. Van Aelst L.

For expression of GST-Vav(PH), codons 397–505 of mouse Vav were amplified by PCR and subcloned into theEcoRI/HindIII site of pGEX-KG vector. For expression of His-Vav(DH), a SacII-BglII fragment of mouse Vav sequence encoding amino acids 173–436 of Vav was subcloned into the HindIII/BamHI sites of theE. coli expression vector pET28C. For expression of GST-Sos(DH), sequences encoding amino acids 211–502 of mouse Sos1 were PCR-amplified and subcloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of the pGEX2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The inserts of each of the plasmids described above were sequenced after completion of the plasmid construction finding the expected sequence was present. Thus, the PCR amplification step did not introduce mutations. The plasmids for expression of His-tagged human Sos1 fragments pET28-Sos(DH/PH) (residues 180–551) and pET28-Sos(PH) (residues 422–551) were a gift from Dr. Dafna Bar-Sagi. NIH-3T3 cells stably expressing Vav were a gift from Dr. M. Barbacid. Expression vectors for Vav PH mutants have been described (3.Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.

The phospholipids, C8-PI-4,5-P2, C8-PI-3,4-P2, and C8-PI-3,4,5-P3, were prepared as described (12.Derman M.P. Toker A. Harwig J.H. Spokes K. Falck J.R. Chen C.-S. Cantley L.C. Cantley L.G. J. Biol.

The plasmid pSVcIISykB for mammalian expression of Syk was a gift from Dr. A. Y. Tsygankov (Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA). Agarose-conjugated anti-Vav antibody and the antibodies to GST, His tag, Myc tag, and phosphotyrosine were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. NIH-3T3 cells expressing wild-type Vav and control cells not expressing Vav were grown to 75% confluence in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 15% calf serum. Cells were then incubated in DMEM containing 0.5% calf serum for 18 h to induce quiescence. After washing with phosphate-free DMEM, cells were incubated for 6 h in phosphate-free, serum-free, DMEM containing 0.5 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate. Cells were then incubated with or without 100 nm wortmannin for 40 min as indicated. Following addition of calf serum (15%), cells were harvested at 0 and 15 min. Cell extracts were prepared on ice by incubation with lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 100 μm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) for 30 min. Anti-Vav antibody conjugated to agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used for Vav immunoprecipitates. The bead-bound immunocomplexes were washed five times in lysis buffer and resuspended in lysis buffer (200 μl) without Triton X-100. Lipids were extracted with 600 μl of CHCl3:MeOH:acetic acid (100:50:1) and the organic phase dried under a nitrogen stream. The lipids, resuspended in CHCl3:MeOH:(10 mm) HCl (20:10:1), were separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC) (14.Schacht J. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 72: 626-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) on Silica gel 250F plates (Baker Scientific) pretreated with 1% potassium oxalate solution (and dried at 120 °C for 40 min). 32P-Labeled phospholipids were visualized after autoradiography. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. Visualization of PI-4,5-P2 was not possible due to a high background of nonspecific material detected in Vav immunoprecipitates from cells not expressing Vav. NIH-3T3 cells were grown and induced to enter quiescence and labeled with [32P]orthophosphate as described above. Cells were stimulated with 15% calf serum. Where indicated, cells were treated with 100 nm wortmannin for 40 min prior to serum addition. Cell lysates and Vav immunoprecipitates were prepared as described above and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. COS7 cells were cotransfected with mammalian expression vectors for wild-type Vav (5 μg) and the kinases SykB or Fyn (1 μg of pSVcIISykB or pXSmyc-Fyn, respectively). The cells were transfected with Superfect reagent (Qiagen Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. At 2.5 h after transfection, the transfection medium was replaced with fresh culture medium followed by further incubation for 5 h. The cells were then serum-starved for 18 h in medium containing 0.5% calf serum. Two cultures of cells were treated with 15% fetal calf serum for 10 min at 37 °C. One set of serum-stimulated cultures were treated with 100 nmwortmannin for 25 min prior to addition of serum. Following the 10 min of serum stimulation, the cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μm NaF, 2 mmNa3VO4, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates, precleared by centrifugation, were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Vav antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc). The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and prepared for immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody or anti-Myc antibody. Vav immunoprecipitates were prepared as described above, except all media contained nonradioactive phosphate. GEF activity in immunoprecipitates was determined using [3H]GDP-bound Rac protein as substrate using methods routine in the laboratory (3.Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.

Westwick J.K. Der C.J. Broek D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1346-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). C8-PI-4,5-P2-NH2was labeled with 125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent as described previously (3.Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R. Murali Krishna U. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Binding of 125I-labeled phosphoinositides to immobilized His-VavL protein was competed with cold phosphoinositides as described previously (3.Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R. Murali Krishna U. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). The background of125I-labeled C8-PI-4,5-P2 binding to nickel-agarose beads (in the presence or absence of cold phosphoinositides) was less than 5% of that binding to His-VavL-coated beads. These background values were subtracted from that bound to the corresponding experimental conditions using His-VavL-coated beads and various concentration of C8-phosphoinositides. Immunoblot analysis used alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies and Immun-Star Substrate (Bio-Rad) for detection of alkaline phosphatase activity by exposure of film to the immunoblot membrane. We measured the intensities of GST-Vav(PH) bands, after immunoblot analysis of binding reactions with His-Vav(DH) in the presence of various amounts of phosphoinositides. The GST-Vav(PH) bands produced on x-ray film upon exposure to the anti-GST immunoblot were analyzed by a laser densitometer. The band intensities, obtained as a product of the relative optical density times area of the band peak, were normalized against the band intensity in the absence of phosphoinositides (i.e. the band intensity in the absence of phosphoinositides is 1). Densitometry analysis of the bands produced by anti-GST immunoblots of a range of predetermined amounts of GST-Vav(PH) showed that, in the range analyzed in Fig. 1 B, the band intensities determined by this method changes linearly with the amount of GST-Vav(PH) present in the band. GST- or His-tagged fragments of Vav immobilized on glutathione-agarose or nickel-agarose beads, respectively, were washed with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm ATP) and resuspended in 450 μl of kinase buffer. The 45-min kinase reactions at 37 °C were initiated by addition of baculovirus-expressed Lck (1:1 molar ratio of Lck to His-Vav(DH/PH)). The bead-bound His-Vav(DH/PH) was then washed several times prior to binding or GEF reactions. Under these conditions (which lack a PI 3-kinase product necessary for efficient phosphorylation), we determined that 45 min of incubation allowed phosphorylation of Vav to a similar extent as with kinase reactions containing C8-PI-3,4,5-P3 and 100-fold less Lck. Fifty picomoles of His-Sos(PH) or GST-Vav(PH) was preincubated in binding buffer phosphate-buffered saline, 500 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Triton X-100) with either C8-PI-4,5-P2, C8-PI-3,4-P2, or C8-PI-3,4,5-P3 at room temperature for 30 min, then 50 pmol of immobilized GST-Sos(DH) or His-Vav(DH) were added to the reaction (250 μl final volume). Where indicated the Vav(DH) fragments were phosphorylated by the Lck kinase (see above). In binding reactions comparing the Vav(PH)-binding-activity of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Vav(DH) fragments (see Fig. 2), equal amounts of Vav(DH) protein were used in each binding reaction. The binding reaction was carried out at room temperature for 1 h, after which the beads were washed with buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, and 50 mm imidazole) three times and once with this buffer lacking Triton X-100. The samples were then analyzed after SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with either anti-His tag or anti-GST antibody. Fifty picomoles of immobilized His-Sos(DH/PH) or His-Vav(DH/PH) was preincubated in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm imidazole, and 500 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) with 100 μm amounts of either C8-PI-4,5-P2 or C8-PI-3,4,5-P3 for 30 min at room temperature. Nucleotide-free GST-Rac was prepared by addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 7.5 mm to GST-Rac protein in binding buffer and incubation at room temperature for 15 min. The binding of magnesium by EDTA dramatically destabilizes the Rac-bound guanine nucleotides. The free nucleotide and EDTA were removed by dilution with binding buffer and centrifugation through a Centricon-10 column (Amicon Corp.). Fifty picomoles of nucleotide-free GST-Rac was then added to the binding reaction (250 μl final volume) and further incubated at room temperature for 2 h. After the incubation, the nickel-agarose beads were extensively washed with buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, and 50 mm imidazole) and the bound Rac protein was detected by immunoblotting to detect GST. We have begun to explore the mechanisms involved in PI 3-kinase product-mediated activation of Vav and Sos1 as well as their inhibition by PI-4,5-P2. We hypothesized that the PH domain when bound to PI-4,5-P2, but not PI-3,4-P2 or PI-3,4,5-P3, contacts the DH domain, masking the Rac binding site and thereby explaining the inhibitory effects of PI-4,5-P2 on GEF activity. This model assumes that PI-4,5-P2 and PI-3,4,5-P3 compete for a single site (or overlapping sites) on the PH domains. In support of this, we find that 125I-labeled C8-PI-4,5-P2(approximately 10–15 μm) binding to recombinant histidine-tagged (His) Vav protein is competed by addition of C8-PI-4,5-P2 or C8-PI-3,4,5-P3 (Fig.1 A). We note that C8-PI-3,4,5-P3 is more efficient at blocking125I-labeled C8-PI-4,5-P2 binding than similar concentrations of C8-PI-4,5-P2 (Fig. 1 A). Whereas 10 μm C8-PI-3,4,5-P3 blocks 80% of the 125I-labeled C8-PI-4,5-P2 binding, the same concentration of C8-PI-4,5-P2 blocked approximately 40% of the 125I-labeled C8-PI-4,5-P2 binding. Similar results were obtained in two independent experiments. These results indicate that C8-PI-3,4-P2 and C8-PI-3,4,5-P3compete for binding at a single or overlapping site and that, as we suggested previously, C8-PI-3,4,5-P3 binds with a modestly higher affinity than does C8-PI-4,5-P2. Binding experiments with a His Vav(DH) domain (residues 173–436) and a GST-tagged Vav(PH) domain (residues 397–505) were carried out to determine whether phosphoinositides have the potential to regulate intramolecular interactions involving these two domains. As seen in Fig. 1 B (top panel), His-Vav(DH) immobilized on nickel-agarose beads was found to precipitate significantly more GST-Vav(PH) domain when the latter was bound to C8-PI-4,5-P2 or without phosphoinositide as compared with that bound to C8-PI-3,4,5-P3. Concentrations of C8-PI-3,4,5-P3 as low as 1 μm significantly prevented the interaction of DH and PH domains when compared with binding reaction in the absence of phosphoinositides (Fig.1 B, second panel). Analysis of the Vav(PH) band intensities bound to the Vav(DH) fragment as a function of C8-PI-3,4,5-P3 concentration is presented in Fig. 1. This analysis and that of two additional films indicates the majority (80–96%) of the reduction in PH binding occurs over the range of 0–10 μm C8-PI-3,4,5-P3. The two PI 3-kinase products, C8-PI-3,4-P2 and C8-PI-3,4,5-P3, were equally effective in blocking the interaction of the isolated DH and PH domains (data not shown). Similar binding studies failed to detect an interaction of the PH domain of Sos with the DH domain of Vav andvice versa (data not shown). Together, these results indicate the affinity of the Vav(DH) domain for the PH domain is higher in the presence of phosphoinositides that inhibit Vav-GEF activity when compared with that of the GEF-activating phosphinositides. Because Vav GEF activity measured in vitro is under dual regulation by Lck-dependent phosphorylation and binding to PI 3-kinase substrate and products, we examined the abilities of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Vav(DH) fragments to bind the Vav(PH) domain bound to C8-PI-4,5-P2 or C8-PI-3,4,5-P3 (see “Experimental Procedures”). This analysis reveals that tyrosine-phosphorylated Vav(DH) binds less efficiently to the Vav(PH) domain than does unphosphorylated Vav(DH) (Fig. 1 B, third panel). However, both unphosphorylated and Lck-phosphorylated DH fragments of Vav (Vav(DH) and Vav(DH)-Y-P) bound more Vav(PH) when complexed with C8-PI-4,5-P2 as compared with that complexed with C8-PI-3,4,5-P3 (Fig. 1 B, third panel). Thus the two events that activate Vav-GEF activity, Lck phosphorylation and PI-3,4,5-P3 binding, contribute to a lessening of the affinity between the PH and DH domains. Similar binding experiments were carried out using a GST-Sos(DH) fragment immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads and a soluble His-Sos(PH) fragment in the presence and absence of saturating concentration (50 μm) of C8-PI-4,5,P2 or C8-PI-3,4,5-P3. Following the binding reaction, the washed pellets were analyzed by immunoblotting to detect the His-tagged PH fragment of Sos. We find GST-Sos(DH) reproducibly binds to His-Sos(PH) in the presence of C8-PI-4,5-P2 but not in the presence of C8-PI-3,4,5-P3 (Fig. 1 B, bottom panel). Similar results were obtained using concentration of C8-PI-4,5,P2, or C8-PI-3,4,5-P3 less than 10 μm (data not shown). These results demonstrate that,in vitro, the PH domain of Sos1 interacts with the DH domain and this interaction is regulated by the opposing action of PI 3-kinase substrate and product. The PI 3-kinase substrate-dependent interaction of the DH and PH domains of Vav and Sos suggest a mechanism explaining the inhibitory effects of PI-4,5-P2 on GEF activity. The inhibition of Vav GEF activity by PI 3-kinase substrate could be due to the PH domain blocking Rac from binding to the catalytic DH domain. Activation of Vav might then occur by PI 3-kinase products causing the PH domain to break these intramolecular contacts with the DH domain and thereby allowing Rac to bind to the DH domain. To test this hypothesis, we examined the ability of a His-tagged fragment of Vav encompassing both the DH and PH domains (Vav(DH/PH)) to bind to GST-Rac protein in the presence and absence of C8-PI-4,5-P2 or C8-PI-3,4,5-P3. GEFs catalyze guanine nucleotide exchange by stabilizing the reaction intermediate, nucleotide-free GTPase (2.Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Thus, GEFs have higher affinity for nucleotide-free Ra"

Multifunctional protein-2 (MFP-2), also called d-bifunctional protein, catalyzes the second (hydration) and third (dehydrogenation) reactions of the latter pathway. In order to further clarify the physiological role of this enzyme in the degradation of fatty carboxylates, MFP-2 knockout mice were generated. MFP-2 deficiency caused a severe growth retardation during the first weeks of life, resulting in the premature death of one-third of the MFP-2−/− mice. Furthermore, MFP-2-deficient mice accumulated VLCFA in brain and liver phospholipids, immature C27 bile acids in bile, and, after supplementation with phytol, pristanic and phytanic acid in liver triacylglycerols. These changes correlated with a severe impairment of peroxisomal β-oxidation of very long straight chain fatty acids (C24), 2-methyl-branched chain fatty acids, and the bile acid intermediate trihydroxycoprostanic acid in fibroblast cultures or liver homogenates derived from the MFP-2 knockout mice. In contrast, peroxisomal β-oxidation of long straight chain fatty acids (C16) was enhanced in liver tissue from MFP-2−/− mice, due to the up-regulation of the enzymes of the classical peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway. The present data indicate that MFP-2 is not only essential for the degradation of 2-methyl-branched fatty acids and the bile acid intermediates di- and trihydroxycoprostanic acid but also for the breakdown of very long chain fatty acids.

Whereas mitochondrial β-oxidation is primarily involved in the catabolism of short, medium, and long chain fatty acids supplementing energy to the cell, peroxisomal β-oxidation seems to be responsible for the degradation of a number of less abundant carboxylates of different molecular structure (1.Reddy J.K. Mannaerts G.P. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 343-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 2.Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P.P. Reddy J.K. Suga T. Mannaerts G.P. Lazarow P.B. Subramani S. Peroxisomes: Biology and Role in Toxicology and Disease. The New York Academy of Sciences, New York1996: 99-115Google Scholar). The substrates for peroxisomal β-oxidation known to date include very long straight chain fatty acids (containing more than 20 carbon atoms); 2-methyl-branched chain fatty acids (e.g. pristanic acid that is formed after α-oxidation of the 3-methyl-branched fatty acid phytanic acid); prostanoids; dicarboxylic acids; and the C27 bile acid intermediates di- and trihydroxycoprostanic acid, which are converted to the mature C24 bile acids via peroxisomal β-oxidation. Similar to mitochondrial β-oxidation, peroxisomal β-oxidation consists of four steps: 1) a desaturation leading to a 2-enoyl-CoA; 2) a hydration of the enoyl-CoA to a 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA; 3) a dehydrogenation with the formation of a 3-ketoacyl-CoA; and 4) a thiolytic cleavage yielding an acyl-CoA shortened by two carbon atoms. In recent years, it has become clear that the peroxisomal reactions are catalyzed by different acyl-CoA oxidases (3.Schepers L. Van Veldhoven P.P. Casteels M. Eyssen H.J. Mannaerts G.P. J. Biol.

Based on the substrate specificity and stereoselectivity of the newly discovered enzymes, different β-oxidation pathways have been proposed (2.Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P.P. Reddy J.K. Suga T.

The classical pathway catalyzed by palmitoyl-CoA oxidase, multifunctional protein-1 (also denoted as l-bifunctional protein because the hydrated species it generates has thel-configuration), and peroxisomal thiolase is generally accepted to be responsible for the oxidation of straight chain fatty acids. All enzymes of this pathway are found in different species and can be strongly induced in rodents by ligands of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα).1 The oxidation of 2-methyl-branched fatty acids and of the bile acid intermediates, di- and trihydroxycoprostanic acid, is believed to occur via a second pathway. In humans, this pathway consists of branched chain acyl-CoA oxidase (5.Vanhove G.F. Van Veldhoven P.P. Fransen M. Denis S. Eyssen H.J. Wanders R.J.A. Mannaerts G.P. J. Biol.

Several in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that the separation between the two pathways may not be as strict as generally believed and that intermediates produced in one of these β-oxidation pathways can be shuttled to the other system. In particular, in vitro experiments have shown that the multifunctional proteins (MFP-1 and MFP-2) have a broad substrate spectrum; they are both capable of hydrating the enoyl-CoA esters of straight chain and 2-methyl-branched fatty acids and of the bile acid intermediates and they can both dehydrogenate straight chain and branched chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoAs (6.Novikov D.K.

However, it was concluded from stereochemical studies that MFP-2 and not MFP-1 is responsible for the degradation of bile acid intermediates and pristanic acid. Indeed, only the hydroxylated intermediate produced by MFP-2 has the right configuration to be further dehydrogenated by the same enzyme (7.Dieuaide-Noubhani M. Novikov D.K. Baumgart E.

Besides this involvement in the degradation of branched compounds, there are indications that MFP-2 might also be physiologically important for the oxidation of straight chain fatty acids. During studies on linoleic acid (21.Diczfalusy U. Alexson S.E.H. Sisfontes L. Ölund J. Björkhem I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1043: 182-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and palmitic acid 3M. Dieuaide-Noubhani, G. P. Mannaerts, and P. P. Van Veldhoven, unpublished data. breakdown by purified peroxisomes, generation of both 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA stereoisomers was observed. In human fibroblasts, which contain more MFP-2 than MFP-1, MFP-2 was suggested to play a major role in the peroxisomal oxidation of long chain and very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) (22.Jiang L.L. Kurosawa T. Sato M. Suzuki Y. Hashimoto T. J. Biochem. 1997; 121: 506-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mice with an inactivated MFP-1 gene display normal levels of VLCFA (23.Qi Q. Zhu Y. Pan J. Usuda N. Maeda N. Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Hashimoto T. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15775-15780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), whereas a patient with a genetic defect in the MFP-2 gene was reported to accumulate, besides branched fatty acids and bile acid intermediates, also VLCFA (24.van Grunsven E.G. van Berkel E. Ijlst L. De Klerk J.B.C. Vreken P. Adamski J. Lemonde H. Clayton P.T. Cuebas D.A. Wanders R.J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2128-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, the latter observation could also be explained by an inhibitory effect of accumulating branched chain β-oxidation intermediates on MFP-1 (24.van Grunsven E.G. van Berkel E. Ijlst L. De Klerk J.B.C. Vreken P. Adamski J. Lemonde H. Clayton P.T. Cuebas D.A. Wanders R.J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2128-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to further investigate the in vivo role of MFP-2 by generating a mouse model with MFP-2 deficiency. Inactivation of the MFP-2 gene caused a severe growth retardation and death of one-third of the mice during the first postnatal weeks. Overall peroxisomal β-oxidation activity toward different substrates, individual enzyme activities, and accumulation of substrates for peroxisomal β-oxidation were examined. The results demonstrate that MFP-2 is of prime importance not only in the degradation of 2-methyl-branched fatty acids and bile acid intermediates but also in the degradation of very long chain fatty acids. A P1 genomic clone encompassing 80 kilobase pairs of the mouse MFP-2 gene was obtained through Genome Systems (St. Louis, MO) by polymerase chain reaction screening using as primers AgCATgggACCATATgAAgAAACAg (forward) and CTCCgTCATCCgTgACCCAgCgTTg (reverse). These oligonucleotides are located at base pairs 399–423 and 582–606 of the published mouse cDNA (25.Normand T. Husen B. Leenders F. Pelczar H. Baert J.-L. Begue A. Flourens A.-C. Adamski J. de Launoit Y. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 55: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and encompass a 1.5-kilobase pair genomic DNA fragment. The P1 clone was partially mapped by restriction enzyme digestion and Southern hybridization and by polymerase chain reaction analysis to locate intron/exon boundaries. The targeting vector was constructed by subcloning a 3.5-kilobase pairBamHI/NheI fragment (located in the 5′-upstream region of the gene) as the 5′-flank and a 6.0-kilobase pairSspI/KpnI fragment (located in intron 3) as the 3′-flank in the pNT vector (26.Tybulewisz V.L. Crawford C.E. Jackson P.K. Bronson R.T. Mulligan R.C. Cell. 1991; 65: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). Linearization of the targeting vector and electroporation in R1 ES cells were done as described previously (27.Carmeliet P. Kieckens L. Schoonjans L. Ream B. Van Nuffelen A. Prendergast G. Cole M. Bronson R. Collen D. Mulligan R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2746-2755Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Southern analysis of 260 clones resistant to both G418 and ganciclovir revealed four clones that had undergone the correct homologous recombination (Fig. 1). Aggregation of these recombinant ES cell clones with morulae derived from Swiss mice yielded several chimeric mice, one of which transferred the MFP-2+/−genotype to the offspring. Mice were genotyped by extraction of tail DNA, digestion with EcoRV, and hybridization of the Southern blot with the 3′ external probe (Fig. 1). For Northern analysis, 20 μg of total RNA extracted from adult mouse livers by the Chomczynski procedure (28.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63189) Google Scholar) was loaded on a 1.1% (w/v) agarose gel containing 3% (w/v) formaldehyde. A 1071-base pair probe corresponding to the 1042–2113-base pair fragment of the mouse MFP-2 cDNA was generated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from mouse liver RNA and used for Northern hybridization in the presence of formamide. For Western blot analysis, liver tissue from 1-, 2-, or 6-week-old mice was homogenized in 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA. Thirty μg of protein were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% gels) and blotted. The following antibodies raised in rabbits were used: the 53-kDa subunit of rat palmitoyl-CoA oxidase (17.Van Veldhoven P.P. Van Rompuy P. Fransen M. de Béthune B. Mannaerts G.P. Eur. J.

Liver homogenates from 6–8-week-old mice were freshly prepared in 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, and incubated with 0.1 mm[1-14C]palmitoyl-CoA under conditions favoring either peroxisomal or mitochondrial β-oxidation (31.Mannaerts G.P. Debeer L.J. Thomas J. De Schepper P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4585-4595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubations with 0.1 mm [26-14C]3,7,12-trihydroxycoprostanic acid were performed under cyanide conditions as described previously (32.Casteels M. Van Roermund C.W.T. Schepers L. Govaert L.

Dis. 1989; 12: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), but dithiothreitol was omitted, and the specific activity was raised to 5 μCi/μmol. Formation of CO2 was negligible in homogenates, and oxidation rates were calculated from the generation of acid soluble products as described. Fibroblasts were prepared by trypsinization of skin tissue of newborn mice and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Passage 3 cells were plated in 25-cm2 flasks, grown to 80% confluency, washed with PBS, and incubated in closed flasks for approximately 24 h with 3 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium containing 0.2% Ultroser H and 5 μm of [1-14C]palmitic acid, 2-methyl-[1-14C]hexadecanoic acid, [1-14C]lignoceric acid, or 3-methyl-[1-14C]hexadecanoic acid. The generation of14C-labeled CO2, formate, and acid-soluble substances was quantified as described (33.Van Veldhoven P.P. Huang S. Eyssen H.J. Mannaerts G.P. J. Inher. Metab. Dis. 1993; 16: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 34.Casteels M. Croes K. Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 1973-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Acyl-CoA oxidase activities in liver homogenates from 6–8-week-old mice were analyzed as described (35.Van Veldhoven P.P. J. Inher. Metab. Dis. 1995; 18: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). For the measurements of palmitoyl-CoA oxidase, homogenates were pretreated with N-ethylmaleimide, and 100 μm palmitoyl-CoA was used as substrate in the presence of 10 μm bovine serum albumin. For the determination of branched chain acyl-CoA oxidase, the N-ethylmaleimide pretreatment was omitted, and 100 μm2-methylhexadecanoyl-CoA, in the presence of 40 μm bovine serum albumin, was used as substrate. Due to the apparent absence of pristanoyl-CoA oxidase in mouse liver (17.Van Veldhoven P.P. Van Rompuy P. Fransen M. de Béthune B. Mannaerts G.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 795-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), this substrate is used by branched chain acyl-CoA oxidase and results in higher activities than those obtained with trihydroxycoprostanoyl-CoA. 4P. P. Van Veldhoven, unpublished data. Multifunctional proteins were measured by following the dehydration of 3-hydroxy-3-phenylpropionyl-CoA, a substrate introduced by Schulz and co-workers (36.Mao L.-F. Chu C. Schulz H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3320-3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For the CoA-ester synthesis, the hydroxysuccinimide esters (150 μmol) (37.Lapidot Y. Rappoport S. Wolman Y. J. Lipid. Res. 1967; 8: 142-145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the 3-hydroxy-3-phenylpropanoic acid isomers (Acros), crystallized from ethanol, were dissolved in 2.5 ml of tetrahydrofuran and mixed with an equal volume of 0.2 mNaHCO3 containing 50 μmol CoA and stirred for 3 h at room temperature. After removal of the organic solvent by a stream of nitrogen, pH was brought to 4 with acetic acid, 2 ml of methanol was added, and remaining ester was extracted with heptane/ethyl acetate (1:1, v/v). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was adjusted to pH 7 with NaHCO3. For the assay, a 50-μl aliquot of the homogenates, appropriately diluted, was added to cuvettes, followed by the addition of 400 μl of reaction medium and 50 μl of 1 mm CoA-ester (either the 3R-isomer for the measurement of MFP-1 or the 3S-isomer for the determination of MFP-2), and reactions were monitored at 25 °C at 308 nm (ε = 26, 500). Final optimized assay concentrations were 200 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% (w/v) Thesit. The addition of the detergent Thesit caused a 2.5–4-fold increase in the activities for both substrates in fresh mouse liver homogenates,4 probably by destroying permeability barriers. In mouse liver, approximately 90–95% of the dehydratase activity measured with the 3R-isomer was sensitive to heating (50–60 °C; 2.5–10 min),4 suggesting that contribution of the murine mitochondrial hydratase under our assay conditions is minor. In rat liver, 80% of the activity was heat-sensitive, in agreement with other reports (38.Osumi T. Hashimoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 89: 580-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). A Bligh-Dyer extraction was performed on liver or brain from 6–8-week-old mice (39.Van Veldhoven P.P. Bell R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 959: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Lipids were further separated in neutral lipids, fatty acids, and phospholipids by ion exchange chromatography (Bond Elut NH2, 500 mg, Varian). The fractions containing phospholipids were subjected to acidic methanolysis in the presence of internal standards (heptadecanoic acid and heptacosanoic acid) followed by gas chromatography of the fatty acid methyl esters on a BPX70 column (40.Janssen A. Baes M. Gressens P. Mannerts G.P. Declercq P. Van Veldhoven P.P. Lab. Invest. 2000; 80: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Triglycerides were isolated from the fractions containing neutral lipids by TLC (solvent heptane/diethylether/acetic acid, 70:30:1, v/v/v), eluted with chloroform/methanol (41.Van Veldhoven P.P. Swinnen J.V. Esquenet M. Verhoeven G. Lipids. 1997; 32: 1297-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), transmethylated, and analyzed by gas chromatography. Bile, collected by puncturing the bladder, was pooled from different animals, and 20–40 μl were mixed with 50 μl of 0.2 n NaOH and 600 μl of ethanol. After boiling for 5 min, the mixture was centrifuged, and the precipitate was washed once with 600 μl of ethanol. The combined supernatants, after adding 1 ml of water, were extracted twice with 2 ml of heptane and then acidified with 50 μl of 1 n HCl, and bile acids were extracted with 2 × 2 ml of diethylether. The ether phases were dried under nitrogen and dissolved in 20 μl of 70% methanol, and 1 μl was mixed with glycerol and analyzed by negative ion fast atom bombardment mass tandem mass spectrometry as described by Libertet al. (42.Libert R. Hermans D. Draye J.P. Van Hoof F. Sokal E. de Hoffmann E. Clin. Chem. 1991; 37: 2102-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). With the aim of abolishing both enzymatic activities (hydratase and dehydrogenase) of the MFP-2 gene product, a targeting vector was constructed such that after homologous recombination the first three exons were deleted (Fig.1). The successful inactivation of the MFP-2 gene in MFP-2−/− mice was demonstrated by Northern and Western blotting showing the total absence of MFP-2 transcripts and protein (Fig. 1). This was further confirmed by analyzing the dehydration of 3S-hydroxy-3-phenylpropionyl-CoA, catalyzed by the d-specific hydratase domain of MFP-2. The dehydration activity was easily measurable in liver homogenates from wild type and MFP-2+/− mice but was negligible in liver homogenates derived from MFP-2-deficient mice (TableI).Table IActivity of peroxisomal β-oxidation in MFP-2 knockout mice: Activity of peroxisomal enzymes in liver homogenatesEnzymeSubstrateMFP-2+/+MFP-2+/−MFP-2−/−Palmitoyl-CoA oxidasePalmitoyl-CoA7.00 ± 1.70 (3)7.03 ± 0.74 (4)27.6 ± 2.13 (4)Branched chain acyl-CoA oxidase2-Methylhexadecanoyl-CoA0.271 ± 0.025 (3)0.223 ± 0.044 (3)0.722 ± 0.136 (4)MFP-1 (dehydratase)3R-Hydroxy-3-phenylpropionyl-CoA123 ± 11.3 (3)115 ± 7.32 (7)234 ± 21.6 (7)MFP-2 (dehydratase)3S-Hydroxy-3-phenylpropionyl-CoA71.4 ± 6.04 (3)41.4 ± 1.25 (7)0.21 ± 0.10 (7)Urate oxidaseUric acid10.7 ± 0.93 (3)10.3 ± 0.69 (4)25.4 ± 2.03 (4)Values represent the mean ± S.E. of the activities expressed as nmol · min · mg protein (n = number of samples).

At birth, the MFP-2−/− mice were indistinguishable from their wild type and heterozygous littermates. However, from postnatal day 2 on, a marked growth retardation of the MFP-2-deficient mice was observed (Fig.2, A and B). Weight gain was particularly low during the lactation period resulting in an average 50% reduction of body weight in comparison with wild type littermates, at the time of weaning. Approximately 30% of MFP-2−/− mice were more severely affected, grew only marginally, and died between postnatal days 2 and 12 (Fig.2 C).

https://openalex.org/W1976457322,"The synthesis of 7α-hydroxylated bile acids from oxysterols requires an oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase encoded by theCyp7b1 locus. As expected, mice deficient in this enzyme have elevated plasma and tissue levels of 25- and 27-hydroxycholesterol; however, levels of another major oxysterol, 24-hydroxycholesterol, are not increased in these mice, suggesting the presence of another oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase. Here, we describe the cloning and characterization of murine and human cDNAs and genes that encode a second oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase. The genes contain 12 exons and are located on chromosome 6 in the human (CYP39A1locus) and in a syntenic position on chromosome 17 in the mouse (Cyp39a1 locus). CYP39A1 is a microsomal cytochrome P450 enzyme that has preference for 24-hydroxycholesterol and is expressed in the liver. The levels of hepatic CYP39A1 mRNA do not change in response to dietary cholesterol, bile acids, or a bile acid-binding resin, unlike those encoding other sterol 7α-hydroxylases. Hepatic CYP39A1 expression is sexually dimorphic (female > male), which is opposite that of CYP7B1 (male > female). We conclude that oxysterol 7α-hydroxylases with different substrate specificities exist in mice and humans and that sexually dimorphic expression patterns of these enzymes in the mouse may underlie differences in bile acid metabolism between the sexes.

Lund E.G. Russell D.W. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 1-6Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In one pathway, cholesterol (5-cholesten-3β-ol) is first converted into 7α-hydroxycholesterol (cholest-5-ene-3β,7α-diol) by the enzyme cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, which is encoded by the Cyp7a1 gene in mice. In the other pathway, cholesterol is first converted into one of several oxysterols prior to being 7α-hydroxylated by oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase, which is encoded by the Cyp7b1 gene. The 7α-hydroxylated intermediates produced by these different initiating steps are subsequently converted into primary bile acids by a series of shared enzymes in the liver (2.Russell D.W.

Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase shows a marked preference for cholesterol as a substrate and is only weakly active against other sterols (3.Ogishima T. Deguchi S. Okuda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7646-7650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase prefers 25-hydroxycholesterol (cholest-5-ene-3β,25-diol) and 27-hydroxycholesterol (cholest-5-ene-3β,27-diol) (4.Schwarz M.

Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1053-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with the latter preference, Cyp7b1 knockout mice accumulate these two oxysterols in their plasma and tissues (6.Li-Hawkins J. Lund E.G. Turley S.D. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16536-16542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The levels of the other major oxysterol, 24-hydroxycholesterol (cholest-5-ene-3β,24-diol), are near normal in these animals (6.Li-Hawkins J. Lund E.G. Turley S.D. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16536-16542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In contrast, a human with a complete absence of oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase activity accumulated 24-hydroxycholesterol as well as 25- and 27-hydroxycholesterol in his plasma (7.Setchell K.D.R. Schwarz M. O'Connell N.C. Lund E.G. Davis D.L. Lathe R. Thompson H.R. Tyson R.W. Sokol R.J. Russell D.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1690-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the human enzyme, unlike the mouse enzyme, may act on all three oxysterol substrates. The observed differences in the oxysterol accumulation patterns in mice and humans that express no oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase are not due to differences in the biosynthesis of oxysterols, as cholesterol 24-hydroxylase, cholesterol 25-hydroxylase, and sterol 27-hydroxylase are present in both species (8.Lund E.G. Guileyardo J.M. Russell D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7238-7243Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 9.Lund E.G. Kerr T.A. Sakai J. Li W.-P. Russell D.W. J. Biol.

Leitersdorf E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14805-14812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The sequence of cholesterol 24-hydroxylase is the most highly conserved between mice and humans (95% identity), and in both, expression of the enzyme is limited to the brain (8.Lund E.G. Guileyardo J.M. Russell D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7238-7243Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). This preservation of expression and form suggests that 24-hydroxycholesterol and 24-hydroxylase play important physiological roles in mammals, perhaps participating in the turnover of cholesterol in the central nervous system (11.Lutjohann D. Breuer O. Ahlborg G. Nennesmo I. Siden A. Diczfalusy U. Björkhem I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9799-9804Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). To determine why Cyp7b1 −/− mice do not accumulate 24-hydroxycholesterol, we examined oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase activity in the livers of knockout animals. A hepatic activity was detected that produced 7α-hydroxylated 24-hydroxycholesterol. Here, we report these results and the isolation by expression cloning (9.Lund E.G. Kerr T.A. Sakai J. Li W.-P. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34316-34348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) of murine and human cDNAs encoding this new enzyme activity. Total liver protein homogenates were prepared, and oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase activities were measured as described (4.Schwarz M. Lund E.G. Lathe R. Björkhem I. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23995-24001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The concentration of oxysterol substrate was 1 μm in the reaction. 25-[3H]Hydroxycholesterol (81.5 Ci/mmol) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. 22R-[3H]Hydroxycholesterol (15 Ci/mmol), 24,25-[3H]epoxycholesterol (76 Ci/mmol), and 27-[3H]hydroxycholesterol (80 Ci/mmol) were synthesized by NEN Life Science Products. 24-[3H]Hydroxycholesterol (50 Ci/mmol) was synthesized by American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). To measure oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase enzyme activity in cultured cells, 60-mm dishes of Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the middle T antigen of the polyoma virus (CHOP cells (12.Heffernan M. Dennis J.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar)) (450,000 cells/dish) were transfected with 4.5 μg of the indicated expression vector using LipofectAMINETM (Life Technologies, Inc.) as a transfection reagent. Sixteen h later, 3H-labeled oxysterol substrate dissolved in ethanol was added to a final concentration of 1 μm to the media, and the incubation was continued for an additional 4–24 h. Media were harvested and extracted with 7 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v); the organic phases were dried; and sterols were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (4.Schwarz M. Lund E.G. Lathe R. Björkhem I. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23995-24001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). A cDNA library was constructed from poly(A)+ mRNA isolated from the livers of threeCyp7b1 −/− male mice in the pCMV5 expression vector (13.Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlbäck H. Jörnvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Individual dishes of CHOP cells (450,000 cells/60-mm dish) were transfected with 4.5 μg of cDNA and 0.5 μg of pVA1 using LipofectAMINETM. The pVA1 plasmid contains the adenovirus VA1 gene, whose RNA product stimulates the expression of transfected genes (9.Lund E.G. Kerr T.A. Sakai J. Li W.-P. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34316-34348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). After 3 h of incubation, the transfection mixture was replaced with 2.5 ml of Dulbecco's minimal essential medium/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) containing 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1–2 μCi of 24-[3H]hydroxycholesterol. After 60 h of incubation at 37 °C, media were harvested, and sterols were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography. 210 primary pools containing ∼100,000 individual cDNAs were screened in the first round. Positive pools were divided into progressively smaller subpools and analyzed by transfection to identify the target cDNA. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses were performed on a Varian 3400 gas chromatograph equipped with an HP-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25-mm phase thickness) connected to a Finnigan SSQ700 mass spectrometer. The gas chromatography temperature program was 180 °C for 1 min, followed by a linear gradient of 10 °C/min to 300 °C and a final elution at 300 °C for 15 min. The injector port and transfer line temperatures were maintained at 280 °C, and the injector was operated in the splitless mode. Helium was used as carrier gas at an injector valve pressure of 6 pounds/square inch. The mass spectrometer was operated in the electron ionization mode with electron energy set at 70 eV and an ion source temperature of 150 °C. CHOP cells were transfected with either CYP39A1 or CYP46 expression vectors as described above and incubated with sterols as indicated in the legend to Fig. 3. The cell medium was extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v); the aqueous phase was aspirated; and the remaining organic phase was taken to dryness under a stream of nitrogen. Solids were redissolved in 1 ml of toluene and purified on Isolute Silica columns (14.Dzeletovic S. Breuer O. Lund E. Diczfalusy U. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), with the modifications described in the accompanying paper (6.Li-Hawkins J. Lund E.G. Turley S.D. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16536-16542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). After derivatization to trimethylsilyl ethers, samples were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with the quadrupole scanned from m/z 50 to 650 at a rate of one scan/1.5 s. Data base searches revealed a human genomic DNA sequence (GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession numbers AC008104 and AL035670) and an expressed sequence tag (R07010) that shared extended sequence identity with the murine CYP39A1 cDNA. The expressed sequence tag was used as a hybridization probe to screen a human cDNA library (CLONTECH, catalog no. HL5022T). Only cDNAs corresponding to the 3′-end of the CYP39A1 mRNA were isolated in this manner. To obtain a full-length cDNA, a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction strategy was pursued as follows. Based on the predicted sequence of exons within the human genomic DNA, two oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify the coding region of the CYP39A1 gene. The oligonucleotide sequences were as follows: 5′-primer, CTGTTTCACACTTTTCTGCTTCTG; and 3′-primer, GAGCTCAGGTCTAGGTGCTGCCAGG. A polymerase chain reaction was performed on human liver Quick-Clone cDNA (CLONTECH, catalog no. 7113-1) using an Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The amplified human CYP39A1 cDNA was cloned into a plasmid vector prior to DNA sequence and expression analyses. Total RNA and poly(A)+ RNA were prepared as described (6.Li-Hawkins J. Lund E.G. Turley S.D. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16536-16542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Mouse and human multiple-tissue RNA blots were purchased from CLONTECH. Hybridizations were performed in either ExpressHyb solution (CLONTECH) or hybridization buffer containing 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.75m NaCl, 0.05 m NaH2PO4, 0.005 m EDTA, 1% (w/v) SDS, and 50% (v/v) formamide. An 18-amino acid peptide (LHRNPKYFPEPESFKPER) derived from residues 373 to 390 of the cDNA-deduced sequence of the murine CYP39A1 protein (see Fig.4 A) was synthesized by Bio-Synthesis, Inc. (Lewisville, TX) as a multiple-antigen peptide. The multiple-antigen peptide was used to immunize two New Zealand White rabbits (male, 3 months old). For the initial injection, 250 μg of multiple-antigen peptide was emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant and administered intramuscularly. Over the next several months, boosts containing the same amount of antigen in Freund's incomplete adjuvant were given at intervals of 2 weeks. Serum samples were collected, and the titer of the desired antibody was tested in immunoblotting experiments that employed extracts from 293 cells transfected with a murine CYP39A1 expression vector. The final antiserum recognized the recombinant CYP39A1 protein expressed in 293 cells and the native protein present in microsomal membranes from murine liver. Previously, we measured the levels of oxysterols in the plasma ofCyp7b1 −/− mice. The rank order of oxysterol accumulation in these animals was 25-hydroxycholesterol > 27-hydroxycholesterol ≫ 24-hydroxycholesterol (6.Li-Hawkins J. Lund E.G. Turley S.D. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16536-16542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To determine if the low levels of 24-hydroxycholesterol were due to the presence of another enzyme that metabolized this oxysterol, tissue homogenates were prepared from the livers of wild-type andCyp7b1 −/− mice and incubated with 24-[3H]hydroxycholesterol. Sterols were then extracted from the reaction mixture and separated by thin-layer chromatography. A product was generated that migrated faster than the 24-hydroxycholesterol substrate when the assay contained homogenates from female wild-type mice (Fig. 1,lane 2). The position to which the metabolite migrated on the plate was consistent with a 7α-hydroxylation event. Synthesis of this product required NADPH (lane 1). Homogenates from female Cyp7b1 −/− knockout mice also contained an NADPH-dependent activity (lanes 3 and4). Similar results were obtained when lysates from male liver were assayed (lanes 5–8), except that the amount of activity was ∼3-fold lower than that in female tissue. As a control experiment, the same lysates were incubated in the presence and absence of NADPH, but with the substrate 27-[3H]hydroxycholesterol. This oxysterol was converted into at least three products when proteins from male or female wild-type mice were included in a reaction with NADPH (Fig. 1,lanes 10 and 14), with male mice producing higher levels of metabolites than female mice. Calculation of theR F values of the products suggested that they contained 7α-hydroxyl groups (4.Schwarz M. Lund E.G. Lathe R. Björkhem I. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23995-24001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 5.Martin K.O. Reiss A.B. Lathe R. Javitt N.B. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1053-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The synthesis of these products was reduced substantially but not eliminated when homogenates fromCyp7b1 −/− knockout mice were used (lanes 12 and 16), and in this case, the product amount was greater in homogenates from the female mice. These data were consistent with the presence of an oxysterol hydroxylase in both wild-type and knockout mice that exhibited a preference for 24-hydroxycholesterol. To isolate cDNAs that encoded this putative 24-hydroxycholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, a cDNA library was prepared in a eukaryotic expression vector from hepatic mRNA pooled from three Cyp7b1 −/− mice. 210 pools of ∼500 independent cDNAs each were transfected into CHOP cells, which were subsequently assayed for oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase enzyme activity. Mock-transfected cells did not metabolize the substrate (Fig. 2, lane 1). However, among the cDNA pools, several expressed an activity that converted 24-hydroxycholesterol into two products (lane 2), which were identified tentatively as 7α-hydroxylated 24-hydroxycholesterol and an additional metabolite (7α,24-dihydroxycholest-4-ene-3-one) produced by the action of an endogenous 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in the CHOP cells. Time course studies indicated that the 7α-hydroxylated 24-hydroxycholesterol product appeared first in the transfected cells and that this initial product was subsequently converted into 7α,24-dihydroxycholest-4-ene-3-one (data not shown). TheR F value of the primary product made by the transfected cells was the same as that made in tissue homogenates (compare lanes 2 and 6). The active pool of cDNAs (lane 2) was sequentially subdivided and re-assayed to isolate a single cDNA that encoded the enzyme activity (lanes 3 and 4). Gas chromatography-ionizing mass spectrometry was used to determine the chemical structure of the primary sterol product of the cDNA-encoded enzyme (Fig. 3). In these experiments, mock- or cDNA-transfected cells were incubated with the indicated sterol substrates, and after 24 h, products in the media were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Mock-transfected cells did not metabolize 24-hydroxycholesterol (Fig.3 A). In contrast, cells transfected with the purified cDNA isolated by expression cloning converted 24-hydroxycholesterol into a primary product (labeled Product a in Fig.3 B), which eluted from the gas chromatography column just before the substrate. The ionization mass spectrogram of Product a was consistent with the presence of three hydroxyl groups on the sterol (Fig. 3 D). Two of these three hydroxyl groups were present on the starting substrate (at carbons 3 and 24), and the enzyme expressed in the transfected cells added the third. Thin-layer chromatography analyses of Product a suggested that the third hydroxyl group was located on carbon 7 (e.g. Fig. 1). However, we did not have access to an authentic 7α-hydroxylated 24-hydroxycholesterol standard with which to compare the mass spectrogram of this product. To overcome this privation, advantage was taken of previous experiments showing that cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46) converted 7α-hydroxycholesterol into a 24-hydroxylated product (Ref. 8.Lund E.G. Guileyardo J.M. Russell D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7238-7243Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar and data not shown). We reasoned that this product of the cholesterol 24-hydroxylase enzyme should have identical elution properties on a gas chromatography column and a virtually identical ionization spectrum as Product a arising from the cDNA-expressed enzyme. The data of Fig. 3 C show that several sterols were produced when cholesterol 24-hydroxylase-expressing cells were incubated with 7α-hydroxycholesterol. One of these (labeled Product b in the gas chromatogram tracing in Fig. 3 C) eluted at the same position as Product a. The mass spectrogram of Product b (Fig.3 E) was identical to that of Product a (Fig. 3 D). Taken together, these data indicate that the cDNA isolated in the experiments of Fig. 2 encoded a 7α-hydroxylase that acted on 24-hydroxycholesterol. Restriction endonuclease mapping of the expression plasmid encoding this activity indicated a 2.4-kb1 cDNA insert. DNA sequence analysis of the insert revealed a 5′-untranslated sequence of 86 base pairs, a potential coding region of 1413 base pairs, and a 3′-untranslated sequence of 872 base pairs. The deduced amino acid sequence of the enzyme spanned 470 amino acids (Fig.4 A) and contained hallmark features of a microsomal cytochrome P450, including a hydrophobic amino terminus and an invariant cysteine residue (position 415) located toward the carboxyl terminus. The assembled full-length sequence was assigned the name CYP39A1 (cytochrome P45039A1) (15.Nelson D.R. Koymans L. Kamataki T. Stegeman J.J. Feyereisen R. Waxman D.J. Waterman M.R. Gotoh O. Coon M.J. Estabrook R.W. Gunsalus I.C. Nebert D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 1996; 6: 1-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (2663) Google Scholar). Further data base searches revealed a human expressed sequence tag (accession number R07010) that shares sequence identity with the murine cDNA and an extended human genomic DNA sequence (accession numbersAC008104 and AL035670), which appeared to span the entire gene. Comparisons of the murine cDNA with human cDNAs isolated by screening a liver cDNA library with the expressed sequence tag and comparisons of these cDNAs with the human genomic sequence produced the amino acid sequence of the human enzyme (Fig. 4 A). A human CYP39A1 cDNA expressed in 293 cells produced an enzyme activity that converted 24-hydroxycholesterol into a 7α-hydroxylated product (data not shown). Comparisons with the genomic sequences in the data base also allowed a refinement of the intron-exon structure of the gene predicted previously. A schematic of the ∼150-kb human gene is shown in Fig. 4 B. Analyses of radiation hybrid panel DNAs indicated that the human gene (CYP39A1) is located on chromosome 6, tightly linked (lod score = 12.7) to the D6S1540 marker, whereas the murine gene (Cyp39a1) is located in a syntenic position on chromosome 17, tightly linked (lod score = 19) to the D17Mit51 marker (data not shown). The chromosomal location of the human gene deduced here agrees with that reported for the genomic DNA sequence in the data base. The mouse and human CYP39A1 amino acid sequences were 75% identical and 83% similar (Fig. 4 C). These proteins were most closely related (∼30% identity) to the oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase encoded by the Cyp7b1 gene and, to a lesser extent, the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase encoded by the Cyp7a1 gene (∼19–27% identity) (Fig. 4 C). The sequence similarities between CYP39A1 and CYP7B1 and the fact that they are both oxysterol 7α-hydroxylases raised questions concerning their substrate preferences. To address this issue, the murine CYP7B1 and CYP39A1 cDNAs were expressed in cultured cells, and the ability of the transfected cells to 7α-hydroxylate various side chain oxysterols was assessed. The data of Fig.5 (first through fifth lanes) indicate that mock-transfected cells metabolized very little of the five different oxysterols tested in these experiments. In contrast, cells transfected with the CYP7B1 cDNA metabolized all substrates with a rank order of 25-hydroxycholesterol > 27-hydroxycholesterol > 24,25-epoxycholesterol > 22-hydroxycholesterol > 24-hydroxycholesterol (sixththrough tenth lanes). Cells expressing the CYP39A1 cDNA avidly metabolized 24-hydroxycholesterol (twelfth lane), but showed little or no activity toward the other four oxysterols (eleventh through fifteenth lanes). These data suggest that the CYP7B1 oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase had broad oxysterol substrate specificity, whereas the CYP39A1 oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase was largely restricted to 24-hydroxycholesterol. The tissue distribution and regulation of the murine CYP39A1 mRNA were examined by RNA blotting. Analysis of eight tissues revealed a single hybridizing species of ∼2.5 kb that was present only in the liver (Fig. 6 A). Analysis of mRNA from 12 human tissues using a CYP39A1 cDNA probe revealed a single mRNA (∼2.4 kb) with a similar liver-specific expression pattern (data not shown). Feeding mice diets supplemented with 2% cholesterol, 0.5% cholate, 2% cholesterol plus 0.5% cholate, or 2% colestipol did not change the levels of hepatic CYP39A1 mRNA relative to those in normal chow-fed animals (Fig. 6 B,first through fifth lanes). Dietary supplements also did not change the levels of hepatic CYP39A1 mRNA in mice lacking the CYP7B1 oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase (Fig. 6 B,sixth through tenth lanes). A final series of experiments confirmed the sexually dimorphic expression pattern of the CYP39A1 oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase at multiple levels. As shown by the data in Fig. 6 C(upper panel), the level of this mRNA in wild-type mice was ∼3-fold higher in female versus male liver. Immunoblotting experiments with an anti-peptide antibody directed against the CYP39A protein confirmed an increased protein level in females (Fig. 6 C, middle panel), as did enzyme activity measurements (Fig. 6 C, lower panel). These parameters were unchanged inCyp7b1 −/− mice, indicating that loss of the CYP7B1 oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase was not compensated for by increased expression of the CYP39A1 oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase (Fig.6 C). This study reports the cloning of murine and human cDNAs encoding an oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase with specificity for 24-hydroxycholesterol. These enzymes contain 470 amino acids, share 75% sequence identity, and represent a new subfamily of cytochrome P450 proteins (CYP39A1). The human CYP39A1 gene contains 12 exons and spans ∼150 kb of DNA on chromosome 6 in the region of the human leukocyte antigen genes, whereas the mouse Cyp39a1gene is located in a similar position on chromosome 17. The expression of CYP39A1 appears to be limited to the liver and is sexually dimorphic in the mouse, with higher levels of CYP39A1 mRNA and enzyme activity in females. Based on previous studies showing that 24-hydroxycholesterol is converted by the liver into more polar sterols that are most likely bile acids (16.Björkhem I. Lutjohann D. Breuer O. Sakinis A.

The current findings bring to three the number of sterol 7α-hydroxylases that participate in the synthesis of bile acids. All are cytochromes P450 of the endoplasmic reticulum. Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (19.Jelinek D.F. Andersson S. Slaughter C.A. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8190-8197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the CYP39A1 oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase (Fig.6 A) are expressed only in the liver, whereas the expression pattern of the CYP7B1 oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase is more widespread and differs between species (1.Schwarz M.

These three sterol 7α-hydroxylases share 19–41% sequence identity (Fig. 4 C) and are clearly related at a functional level. An analysis of their gene structures and chromosomal map positions suggests that they may have arisen by two different evolutionary mechanisms. The human cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase and CYP7B1 oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase genes have identical intron-exon structures and are closely linked on chromosome 8 (7.Setchell K.D.R. Schwarz M. O'Connell N.C. Lund E.G. Davis D.L. Lathe R. Thompson H.R. Tyson R.W. Sokol R.J. Russell D.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1690-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 24.Cohen J.C. Cali J.J.

Genomics. 1992; 14: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), indicating that they may derive from an ancient duplication event. In contrast, the human CYP39A1 oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase gene contains 12 exons (Fig. 4 B) and is located on chromosome 6, which suggests that this gene arose independently of the other two. Tracing the species-specific distribution of these three enzymes in the future may reveal information regarding the marked diversity of bile acids in different species. A homologue of the CYP39A1 oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase is present in the chicken (GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession number AI979980), and enzyme activity measurements suggest that chickens and other birds also contain the CYP7B1 oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase (4.Schwarz M. Lund E.G. Lathe R. Björkhem I. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23995-24001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Despite the sequence similarities between the three sterol 7α-hydroxylases of bile acid synthesis, the enzymes have different substrate preferences. Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase oxidizes cholesterol, whereas the CYP7B1 enzyme acts preferentially on 25- and 27-hydroxycholesterol (4.Schwarz M. Lund E.G. Lathe R. Björkhem I. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23995-24001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 5.Martin K.O. Reiss A.B. Lathe R. Javitt N.B. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1053-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the CYP39A1 enzyme prefers 24-hydroxycholesterol (Fig. 5). It is important to point out that these are preferences and not absolute specificities, as the two oxysterol 7α-hydroxylases will metabolize different side chain oxysterols at some level when assayed in tissue homogenates (Fig. 1) or when expressed in cultured cells (Fig. 5). That the same or similar preferences exist in vivo is supported by the accumulation of 25- and 27-hydroxycholesterol, but not 24-hydroxycholesterol, in mice lacking the CYP7B1 oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase (6.Li-Hawkins J. Lund E.G. Turley S.D. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16536-16542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This outcome predicts that mice with a null mutation in the Cyp39a1 gene may accumulate 24-hydroxycholesterol, but not the other two oxysterols. The accumulation of all three oxysterols in a human subject lacking the CYP7B1 oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase (7.Setchell K.D.R. Schwarz M. O'Connell N.C. Lund E.G. Davis D.L. Lathe R. Thompson H.R. Tyson R.W. Sokol R.J. Russell D.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1690-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) may reflect a broader substrate specificity of this enzyme, a difference in the expression of the CYP39A1 enzyme, or a consequence of hepatic failure caused by hyperoxysterolemia in this individual. It should also be pointed out that only a single subject with this deficiency has been identified and that the phenotypes of other affected individuals may be different. The majority of circulating 24-hydroxycholesterol in the mouse (8.Lund E.G. Guileyardo J.M. Russell D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7238-7243Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), rat (16.Björkhem I. Lutjohann D. Breuer O. Sakinis A. Wennmalm A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30178-30184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), and human (17.Björkhem I. Lutjohann D. Diczfalusy U. Stahle L. Ahlborg G. Wahren J. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1594-1600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is made in the brain. The brain is the most cholesterol-rich tissue in mammals and, unlike peripheral tissues, cannot exchange cholesterol with circulating lipoprotein particles (11.Lutjohann D. Breuer O. Ahlborg G. Nennesmo I. Siden A. Diczfalusy U. Björkhem I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9799-9804Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The synthesis of 24-hydroxycholesterol is thought to represent a pathway by which excess cholesterol is mobilized to escape the confines of the blood-brain barrier and central nervous system (17.Björkhem I. Lutjohann D. Diczfalusy U. Stahle L. Ahlborg G. Wahren J. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1594-1600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of an oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase with selectivity for 24-hydroxycholesterol in the liver suggests that the major pathway by which the body excretes brain-derived cholesterol is via the liver into the bile. A similar metabolic pathway exists for 27-hydroxycholesterol, which is produced chiefly in the lung (25.Babiker A. Andersson O. Lindblom D. van der Linden J. Wiklund B. Lutjohann D. Diczfalusy U. Björkhem I. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1417-1425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and then converted to bile acids in the liver by the CYP7B1 oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase. The fact that conserved tissue-specific synthesis and degradative pathways exist for oxysterols underscores their potential roles as mediators of reverse cholesterol transport. The three sterol 7α-hydroxylase genes of bile acid metabolism are regulated differently. The cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase gene is subject to negative feedback regulation by bile acids and to positive feed-forward regulation by cholesterol in mice and rats (19.Jelinek D.F. Andersson S. Slaughter C.A. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8190-8197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription from the CYP7B1 oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase gene is only modestly down-regulated by bile acids (4.Schwarz M. Lund E.G. Lathe R. Björkhem I. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23995-24001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and the levels of CYP39A1 oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase mRNA do not change in response to bile acids, cholesterol, or bile acid-binding resins (Fig. 6 A). Finally, CYP39A1 is more abundant in female mice. whereas CYP39B1 is more abundant in male mice (Figs. 1 and 6). Sexually dimorphic expression patterns of the CYP7B1 and CYP39A1 oxysterol 7α-hydroxylases, together with their substrate preferences, may thus underlie differences in bile acid metabolism that exist between male and female mice (26.van Nieuwerk C.M.J.

Here, the genomic structure, cardiac localization, and biophysical properties of a murine example are considered. Kcnk3 subunits have two pore-forming P domains and unique functional attributes. At steady state, Kcnk3 channels behave like open, potassium-selective, transmembrane holes that are inhibited by physiological levels of proton. With voltage steps, Kcnk3 channels open and close in two phases, one appears to be immediate and one is time-dependent (τ = ∼5 ms). Both proton block and gating are potassium-sensitive; this produces an anomalous increase in outward flux as external potassium levels rise because of decreased proton block. Single Kcnk3 channels open across the physiological voltage range; hence they are “leak” conductances; however, they open only briefly and rarely even after exposure to agents that activate other potassium channels.

Nonetheless, their existence as independent transport entities, rather than residual flux through other pathways, was controversial until the cloning of KCNKØ from Drosophila melanogaster (13.Goldstein S.A.N.

KCNKØ (previously ORK1), encodes a potassium channel subunit with two P domains and four predicted transmembrane segments (2P/4TM)1 (13.Goldstein S.A.N. Price L.A. Rosenthal D.N. Pausch M.H. Proc.

KCNKØ channels are open across the physiological voltage range, show no delay in current development with voltage steps, and “openly rectify,” that is, they operate like potassium-selective holes in an electric field (13.Goldstein S.A.N.

Goldstein, submitted for publication. 2N. Ilan and S. A. N. Goldstein, submitted for publication. KCNKØ channels are tightly regulated; activation yields an open probability (P o) close to 1, and inhibition produces channels that are almost always closed (63.Ilan N. Zilberberg N.

Wang K.W. Ilan N. Pausch M. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 24.Lopes C.M.B. Gallagher P.G. Wong C. Buck M. Goldstein S.A.N. J. Biophys. 1998; 74 (abstr.): 44Google Scholar), localized it to chromosome 5B in mouse and 2p23.3-p24.1 in human (25.Manjunath N.A. Bray-Ward P. Goldstein S.A.N. Gallagher P.G. Cytogen. Cell Gen. 1999; 86: 242-243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and called the predicted protein product OAT1. Two other groups cloned Kcnk3 concurrently and called the encoded subunit TASK1 (26.Duprat F. Lesage F. Fink M. Reyes R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5464-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) and TBAK1 (27.Kim D. Fujita A. Horio Y. Kurachi Y. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). For clarity, we will now employ the Human Genome Organization nomenclature:KCNK3 gene and KCNK3 channel for human isolates andKcnk3 and Kcnk3 for mice. Significant discrepancies exist between the findings of the three groups. Although all agree thatKcnk3 predicts 2P/4TM subunits that form pH-sensitive, openly rectifying potassium channels, there is no consensus as to tissue distribution (atria or ventricle), function (instantaneous or time-dependent, low or high open probability), or the predicted protein sequence. In this report, five points are highlighted. First, the genomic sequence for murine Kcnk3 is determined to confirm the accuracy of the cDNA under study; this reveals an intron in the midst of the coding sequence for the signature motif (G YG) of the first P loop (an arrangement seen to be conserved in the family from nematodes to humans). Second, Kcnk3 messenger RNA is localized to murine cardiac ventricle and, at lower levels, in the atria; Kcnk3 protein is then confirmed to have the same cardiac distribution. Third, half-maximal blockade of Kcnk3 channels by external protons is confirmed to be near physiological pH and shown to be sensitive to external potassium. Fourth, Kcnk3 currents are seen to develop with voltage changes in two phases; one appears to be immediate and one is time-dependent; the fraction of current in each phase is responsive to external potassium. Fifth, single Kcnk3 channels are shown to open only briefly (to one of two conductance levels) and rarely; although open probability increases with depolarization, it is not significantly augmented by a wide array of stimuli including activation or inhibition of protein kinase A or C, application of volatile anesthetics or metabolic poisons, changes in osmotic strength, or exposure to low oxygen tension. Based on its location and similar functional attributes, we hypothesize Kcnk3 to be the correlate of a native cardiac current that remains active throughout the action potential plateau but whose molecular basis has been unclear, I Kp orI Ksus (8.Backx P.H. Marban E. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 890-900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Yue D.T. Marban E. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J.

The findings support the idea that Kcnk3 channels link cardiac excitability to changes in acid-base status. A homology search of NCBI data base using the BLAST program suite (29.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69652) Google Scholar) and the coding sequence of the ORK1 channel (KCNKØ) as query (accession number U55321) identified expressed sequence tag W09160. Northern blot analysis using the 801-bp cDNA fragment in W09160 detected an abundant single message at ∼3.8 kb in murine heart (24.Lopes C.M.B. Gallagher P.G. Wong C. Buck M. Goldstein S.A.N. J. Biophys. 1998; 74 (abstr.): 44Google Scholar). The 801-bp cDNA fragment was used to screen a random primed and oligo(dT)-primed murine heart cDNA library in λγt11 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Of 28 clones that hybridized to the probe, eight were purified and subcloned, and their ends subjected to automated DNA sequencing; three clones were sequenced in their entirety. This yielded a 5′-untranslated sequence, an open reading frame, and a 3′-untranslated sequence. An additional 160 bp of the upstream 5′-untranslated sequence was obtained by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends using 1 μg of total RNA prepared from murine cardiac muscle, as described (30.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63084) Google Scholar) and primer A (5′-CACCAGCAGGTAGGTGAAG-3′). Single-stranded ligation and amplification were carried out with primers D (5′-GCCAAGCTTGCGGTGGCCCTCAGGTCCAGCTC-3′) with B (5′-GCCGCCGCTGCTGCCCCGGA-3′) and D with C (5′-CTCCACGCCGGGCACCAGCTCCGCAC-3′), respectively. Analyses of nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences were performed utilizing GCG software from the University of Wisconsin (Madison, WI). The cDNA sequence is listed (accession number AB008537). The coding sequence was placed between the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions the ofXenopus β-globin gene in pBF2 (a gift of Bernd Fakler, Tuebingen, DE) and cRNA produced using T3 RNA polymerase and a kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Transcripts were quantified by spectrophotometer and compared with control samples separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Our cDNA sequence (accession number AF065162) was verified by comparison with the genomic sequence (accession numbersAF241798 and AF242508) and varies from the partial sequence reported for murine TASK1 at amino acid residues 4 (Gln replaces Glu), 123 (Val replaces Ile), and 286 (where an additional Gly is added) (26.Duprat F. Lesage F. Fink M. Reyes R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5464-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) and murine TBAK1, which includes a 9-residue amino-terminal extension and a single residue difference at position 101 (Pro replaces Ala) (27.Kim D. Fujita A. Horio Y. Kurachi Y. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These differences do not coincide with known consensus sites in theKcnk3 genomic clone (see below) for splice junctions or editing and are judged to be errors in the sequences reported by others. A murine genomic DNA library in bacteriophage P1 was screened with two oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the 3′ end of the coding region of Kcnk3 cDNA as described (31.Pierce J.C. Sternberg N. Sauer B. Mamm. Genome. 1992; 3: 550-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These primers, 5′-GCAGACGCAGCCGCAGTATG-3′ and 5′-GCCTGGCCGTTGTGCGTGAGCAGGG-3′, amplify a 168-bp fragment from murine genomic DNA. Polymerase chain reaction-positive clones were purified and subcloned into pGEM-7Z plasmid vectors (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Subcloned fragments were analyzed by restriction endonuclease digestion, Southern blotting, and nucleotide sequencing. 32P[ATP]-labeled probes used for Northern blots were the 801-bp fragment (W09160) and a β-actin cDNA (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (32.Ng S.Y. Gunning P. Eddy R. Ponte P. Leavitt J. Shows T. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2720-2732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In situ hybridization was performed with adult C57BL6 mice (Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor, ME) using sense and antisense probes from the 801-bp Kcnk3 fragment, as described (33.Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Stehle J.H. Rivkees S.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1037-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). [α-35S]UTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) incorporation into the 801-bp Kcnk3 fragment was 70–85%. Heart sections (8 μm) were hybridized overnight, treated with ribonuclease-A, and dehydrated by soaking in 100% EtOH in 0.6m ammonium acetate. Emulsion radiographs were generated by dipping slides in photographic emulsion with development and fixation 2 days later. Slides were placed on Kodak SB5 film to generate images. Rabbit antibodies recognizing residues 252–269 of the human KCNK3 subunit, EDEKRDAEHRALLTRNGQ, were purchased from Alamone (APC024, Jerusalem, Israel). Frozen mouse heart ventricle and atria were purchased (Pel-Freez Biologicals, Rogers, AZ), and crude membrane fractions of each tissue were prepared by a modified method (34.Kandror K.V. Coderre L. Pushkin A.V. Pilch P. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Proteins were extracted with 1% Triton X-100 and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot with the rabbit antibody, followed by goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody and visualization by enhanced chemiluminescent substrate. Oocytes were isolated from Xenopus laevis frogs (Nasco, Atkinson, WI), subjected to collagenase treatment to ease removal of the follicle, and injected with 46 nl of sterile water containing 2–4 ng of Kcnk3 cRNA. Macroscopic currents were measured 1–4 days after cRNA injection by two-electrode voltage clamp using a Geneclamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Data were sampled at 4–20 kHz and filtered at 1–5 kHz. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using Pulse (Instrutech, Great Neck, NY) and Sigmaplot (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA) software. Electrodes were made from 1.5-mm borosilicate glass tubes (Garner Glass Co., Claremont, CA), contained 3 m KCl, and had resistances between 0.3 and 1 MΩ. Oocytes were studied while perfused at 0.5–1 ml/min with 5 mm KCl bath solution 93 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with NaOH. In indicated cases, KCl was substituted for NaCl. For solutions at pH 6.0, MES replaced HEPES. Studies were performed at room temperature. Voltage clamp recordings were made in both on-cell and outside-out configuration using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments). The vitelline layer was removed prior to recording with a pair of fine forceps after a 1–2-min incubation in hypertonic solution 200 mm potassium aspartate, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with NaOH. Pipettes were fabricated from 7052 glass (Garner Glass Co., Claremont, CA) coated with Q-Dope (GC Electronics, Rockford, IL) and fire-polished. The electrode solution for outside-out patches was 100 mm KCl, 5 mmEGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with KOH. Bath solution contained 100 mm KCl, 0.3 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. External potassium concentration was varied by substitution of NaCl for KCl. Pipette resistance ranged from 3–5 MΩ for single channel recordings and 0.3–0.6 MΩ for macropatches; seal resistance was 4–15 GΩ. Data were sampled at 10–40 kHz, filtered at 0.5–5 kHz with ACQUIRE software (Instrutech Corp.), and analyzed off-line by TAC (Instrutech Corp.) and IGOR (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) software. Equilibrium reversal potentials were determined in the indicated solutions by linear regression. Current-voltage relations were studied in various potassium solutions and fit to the Goldman (35.Goldman D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1943; 27: 37-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar) and Hodgkin and Katz (36.Hodgkin A.L. Katz B. J.

The voltage dependence of block was modeled by a simplification of the approach of Woodhull (38.Woodhull A.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1973; 61: 687-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar) according to the following equation.

Three independent cDNA clones forKcnk3 isolated from a murine cardiac library were found to be identical (accession number AF065162) (24.Lopes C.M.B. Gallagher P.G. Wong C. Buck M. Goldstein S.A.N. J. Biophys. 1998; 74 (abstr.): 44Google Scholar). Relative to the predicted initiator methionine, the cDNA contains an A in position −3 and a termination codon 209 bp upstream with no additional ATG triplets in the intervening sequence. The open reading frame is 1227 bp, and secondary structure analyses predict a protein of 409 amino acids with two classical P domains (2P) bounded by hydrophobic segments that suggest the presence of four transmembrane segments (4TM) (Fig.1 A). A 2P/4TM topology is consistent with the absence of a recognizable leader sequence, the external disposition of one consensus site for N-linked glycosylation, and an internal location for two sites for protein kinase C, two for protein kinase A, three for calcium-calmodulin kinase II, one for tyrosine kinase, and a carboxyl-terminal PDZ consensus motif. Alignments of the P domains for subunits predicted to have two P domains reveals that Kcnk3 is most similar to the open and outward rectifiers (KCNKØ, KCNK2, Kcnk4, and KCNK5), more distantly related to clones with as yet undefined function (KCNK1, Kcnk6, Kcnk7, and KCNK8) and most distinct from the outward rectifier of yeast cells, TOK1 (Fig.1 B). Homology among the genes is insignificant except for the P domain segments where pairs can achieve ∼30% identity. We verified the predicted Kcnk3 cDNA sequence by comparison to the genomic DNA sequence (accession numbers AF241798 andAF242508). Three Kcnk3 genomic clones were identified by polymerase chain reaction screening, and one was studied in detail by restriction enzyme analysis, Southern blotting, and limited nucleotide sequencing. The region of this clone containing the Kcnk3gene, including 5′and 3′-untranslated sequences and the coding region, were sequenced on both strands. Comparison of cDNA and genomic sequences showed that Kcnk3 is a two exon gene spread over ∼21 kb (Fig. 1 C). Evaluation of the exon/intron boundaries revealed the AG:GT rule was not violated and that no AG nucleotide pairs were present in the 15 bp upstream of the 3′ (acceptor) splice junction. The single exon/intron boundary is located at a functionally critical position in the channel, in the midst of the selectivity filter “signature sequence” (G YG) of the first P domain. Northern blot analysis using an 801-bp Kcnk3cDNA fragment as probe detected a strong signal in heart with less abundant message in lung and brain (Fig.2 A). Only a single band at ∼3.8 kb was detected. Faint signals were visualized after exposure for extended periods in skeletal muscle and kidney (not shown). When the distribution of Kcnk3 message in mouse heart was examined by in situ hybridization, a strong, specific signal was apparent throughout both ventricles with the antisense probe (Fig.2 C). A weak antisense signal was also visualized in the atria, indicating a lower level of transcript in those cells. Because this localization was at odds with prior reports (26.Duprat F. Lesage F. Fink M. Reyes R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5464-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), we evaluated the cardiac expression pattern of Kcnk3 protein. Anti-peptide antibodies were used to visualize Kcnk3 protein in homogenates of murine atrial and ventricular tissue (Fig. 2 D). A strong signal near the predicted mass for Kcnk3 was apparent in ventricular samples (Fig. 2 D, lane 1); a weaker signal was found in atrial preparations despite the presence of similar amount of total protein in the lane (Fig. 2 D, lane 2). The signal was demonstrated to be specific for Kcnk3 protein because it was competitively depleted by co-incubation with the peptide fragment recognized by the antiserum (Fig. 2 D, lanes 3 and4). When Kcnk3 cRNA was injected into X. laevis oocytes, a new current was observed by two-electrode voltage clamp (Fig. 3 A) that was not present in control cells. In response to changes in voltage, the current rose to a new steady state level. Once activated, inactivation was not observed (10 s pulses; not shown). At physiological levels of bath potassium (5 mm) and pH (7.4), the channel passed large outward currents with depolarizing voltage steps but only small inward currents at hyperpolarized potentials (Fig.3 A, left panel). Increasing external potassium concentration produced a shift in reversal potential and large inward currents (Fig. 3, A and B). The change in reversal potential indicated that the channel was selective for potassium over sodium and chloride. Thus, increasing external potassium levels from 5 to 100 mm (by isotonic substitution of NaCl with KCl) produced a shift in reversal potential of 56 ± 3 mV/10-fold change in potassium (Fig. 3 C) in good agreement with the Nernst relation, which predicts an ∼58 mV change for a perfectly selective channel under these conditions. Changes in current-voltage relationships with altered external potassium indicated that Kcnk3 channels were openly rectifying. Thus, inward currents were smaller than outward currents when external potassium was low and increased to equal magnitude when potassium levels were approximately the same across the membrane (Fig. 3,A and B). This behavior was reasonably well approximated by the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz relation (Equation 1) for current through across an ion-selective partition at differing transmembrane gradients of permeant ion (Fig. 3 B). It was notable that Equation 1 failed to approximate the experimental data at 5 mm bath potassium because outward currents were smaller than predicted. This was subsequently explained by potassium-dependent proton inhibition of Kcnk3 channel currents (see below). Kcnk3 channels exhibit an Eisenman type III permeability series (Fig.3 D). To assess relative permeability compared with potassium (the predominant internal permeant ion), a test cation replaced the sodium and potassium in the bath solution to achieve a pseudo bi-ionic condition in whole cell mode and Equation 2 was used. Permeability was highest for rubidium (1.1 ± 0.1, n = 12) and potassium (= 1), intermediate for cesium and ammonium (0.30 ± 0.02 and 0.23 ± 0.03, n = 8, respectively), and lowest for sodium and lithium (less than 0.031 ± 0.003 and 0.031 ± 0.002, n = 8, respectively). Although rubidium had a greater relative permeability than potassium its relative conductance was over 2-fold lower (Fig. 3 D). With 5 mm potassium in the bath, Kcnk3 currents were maximal at pH 8.0, significantly blocked at pH 7.4, and completely inhibited at pH 6.0 (Fig.4 A). Proton block was well fit to Equation 3 with a half-maximal blocking concentration (pK a) of 7.24 ± 0.03 and a Hill coefficient of 1.02 ± 0.06, suggesting that one proton was required to block (Fig. 4 B). As external potassium levels rose, block by protons was diminished (Fig. 4 C); at pH 7.0, the fraction of unblocked current at 30 mV in a potassium-free bath solution was 0.32 ± 0.02 and increased to 0.54 ± 0.02, 0.73 ± 0.02 and 0.94 ± 0.02 with 5, 20, and 100 mm bath potassium, respectively. Increasing proton levels inhibited Kcnk3 channels despite elevated potassium levels (not shown). The effect of potassium on proton inhibition explained the anomalous increase in outward current seen with elevation of external potassium (Fig.3 A); although increasing bath potassium decreased the outward driving force for potassium flux, it also diminished proton inhibition (Fig. 4 C) leading to an overall increase in outward current. The rise and fall of Kcnk3 currents showed a phase that appeared immediate and another that was delayed. In whole cell mode, ∼40% of activation was judged to be time-dependent with steps from −80 to 60 mV at physiological levels of pH (7.4) and potassium (5 mm) (Fig.5 A). Both raising external potassium from 5 to 100 mm (Fig. 5 B, left panel) and decreasing protons from pH 7.0 to 8.0 (Fig.5 A, right panel) decreased the fraction of current that was time-dependent (I TD/I). Similarly, 55% of deactivating current was judged to be time-dependent with a step from 60 to −120 mV at pH 7.4 and 5 mm potassium (Fig.5 C), and raising external potassium (Fig. 5 D,left panel) and lowering proton level (Fig. 5 D,right panel) decreased the fraction of current that was time-dependent. I TD/Ireflects the fraction of channels closed at rest; thus, higher potassium and lower proton in the bath increased the fraction of channels that were open before the test pulse. At physiological resting potentials and ionic conditions, roughly half the Kcnk3 channels that passed current upon depolarization were already open. The effects of external potassium were consistent with the theory that increased occupancy of the external pore by potassium (either by raising bath levels or decreasing proton block) favored the open channel state. Kcnk3 currents in on-cell patches showed changes with voltage consistent with altered open probability (Fig.6). Thus, the fraction of time-dependent current decreased with more positive holding potential (from −150 to −60 mV; Fig. 6 A, middle panel) or test pulse (from 0 to 60 mV; Fig. 6 A,right panel), indicating opening of channels by depolarization. Deactivation showed a similar dependence on voltage; activation at positive potentials (from 0 to 60 mV; Fig. 6 B,middle panel) opened more channels, increasing the fraction of current that decayed upon subsequent hyperpolarization, and more positive deactivation potential (from -150 to -60 mV; Fig.6 B, right panel) decreasedI TD/I, presumably by increasing the number of channels that stayed open. Activation and deactivation were well approximated by single exponential relationships, and both rates showed a weak dependence on voltage. The rate of activation was greater at more positive test potentials (Fig. 6 B), although deactivation was faster at more negative voltages (Fig. 6 D). With 5 mm external potassium at pH 7.4, the time constant (τ) for the rise in the current (with a step from −80 to 45 mV) was 4.4 ± 0.5 ms and showed an e-fold change per ∼250 mV over this voltage range (Fig. 6 B). This rate of was largely insensitive to both external potassium and pH. Thus, τ with 20 mm potassium at pH 7.4 was 4.1 ± 0.2 ms (n = 3), whereas it was 4.4 ± 0.4 and 4.3 ± 0.6 ms at 5 mm potassium at pH 8.0 (n = 4) and pH 7.0 (n = 4), resp"

The carcinogenic effects of the solar radiation have been mainly attributed to the UVB (280–320 nm) fraction, while the potentially dangerous UVC (100–290 nm) radiations are absorbed by the ozone layer and are therefore not of physiological importance (2.Madronich S. McKenzie R.L. Bjorn L.O. Caldwell M.M. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. 1998; 46: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Exposure of keratinocytes to UVB leads to the expression of several genes involved in cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and/or apoptosis, an event that is collectively known as the UV response (3.Herrlich P. Sachsenmaier C. Radler-Pohl A. Gebel S. Blattner C. Rahmsdorf H.J. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1994; 34: 381-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The induction of apoptosis following UV irradiation is thought to be a protective mechanism ensuring the removal of irreversibly damaged and potentially cancerous cells, and recent reports indicate that both nuclear and cytosolic events contribute critically to the overall apoptotic response (4.Kulms D. Poppelmann B. Yarosh D. Luger T.A. Krutmann J. Schwarz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 14: 7974-7979Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Therefore, the decision whether epidermal keratinocytes undergo apoptosis or not upon UV irradiation is a crucial process in photocarcinogenesis. Recent studies have revealed that the basic mechanism of apoptosis induced by UVB irradiation involves the typical process in which caspases play a critical role (4.Kulms D. Poppelmann B. Yarosh D.

Dermatol. 1999; 112: 769-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In addition, a number of reports have established that the cell surface death receptors, namely TNF1 receptor and Fas, are clustered in a ligand-independent manner to initiate the process of UV-induced apoptosis (6.Aragane Y. Kulms D. Metze D. Wilkes G. Poppelmann B. Luger T.A. Schwarz T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 8.Rosette C. Karin M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 25783-25786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). It is well recognized that the clustering and activation of the Fas or TNF receptor leads to the recruitment and subsequent activation of pro-caspase-8 via the adapter molecule FADD (for Fas-associated death domain protein) (11.Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar). In this so-called extrinsic pathway of caspase activation, caspase-8 leads to the proteolytic activation of downstream effector caspases, cleavage of vital protein substrates and subsequent apoptotic cell death. Accordingly, UVB-induced apoptosis in keratinocytes has been shown to be significantly counteracted by inhibitors of the initiator caspase-8 such as cytokine response modifier A and zVAD-fmk, or by the expression of dominant negative FADD (6.Aragane Y. Kulms D. Metze D. Wilkes G. Poppelmann B. Luger T.A. Schwarz T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 10.Rehemtulla A. Hamilton C.A. Chinnaiyan A.M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25783-25786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the intrinsic pathway for caspase activation, induced by many apoptogenic stimuli, involves the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, which then acts as a trigger for the formation of a complex including the Apaf-1 (apoptotic protease-activating factor 1) and pro-caspase-9. This event culminates in the activation of pro-caspase-9, which can directly cleave and activate the effector caspases, such as caspase-3, resulting in the orchestration of the biochemical execution of the cell (12.Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Kroemer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). In the Fas- and/or TNF-mediated apoptosis, a cytochromec-dependent mechanism of caspase activation can also amplify the effect of caspase-8 on downstream caspases. In this case, active caspase-8 cleaves Bid, a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-interacting protein, producing an active C-terminal fragment, which binds to mitochondria and induces the release of cytochrome c (13.Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar). In many cases, however, the mitochondrial release of cytochromec proceeds independently of caspase activity (14.Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An important and still open question is whether this mitochondria-mediated pathway of caspase activation is relevant to the overall UVB-induced apoptotic response. UV irradiation has been shown to result in the activation of several members of the MAPK superfamily, comprising ERKs, JNKs, and p38 MAPK (15.Assefa Z. Garmyn M. Bouillon R. Merlevede W.

In human keratinocytes, the UVB-induced ERK activation was recently shown to be a protective signal against apoptosis (19.Peus D. Vasa R.A. Beyerle A. Meves A. Krautmacher C. Pittelkow M.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 751-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), whereas the activation of the p38 MAPK cascade was reported to play a causative role in UVB-induced apoptosis (7.Shimizu H. Banno Y. Sumi N. Naganawa T. Kitajima Y. Nozawa Y. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 769-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, how p38 MAPK interacts with the apoptotic machinery and the caspase activation pathways during UVB-induced apoptosis is not yet established. In this study, we show that in UVB-irradiated HaCaT cells, two independent pathways of caspase activation and apoptosis are induced: a caspase-8- and a cytochrome c-dependent pathway, both of which converge on the activation of pro-caspase-3. Importantly, we show that the p38 MAPK pathway mediates apoptosis following UVB irradiation by inducing the release of mitochondrial cytochromec into the cytosol, which is followed by pro-caspase-3 activation. Furthermore, our results suggest that, in the late phase of the apoptotic process, a caspase-8-dependent cleavage of Bid may provide a mechanism to exacerbate cell death following UVB irradiation.

At each time point, cell proliferation was determined by quantification of the cellular protein content using naphthol blue black (Acros, Beerse, Belgium) as described in Ref. 21.Palombella V.J.

A dose of 60 mJ/cm2UVB irradiation resulted in a remarkable and sustained activation of p38 MAPK (Fig. 1 A), which was observed with doses as low as 10 mJ/cm2 (data not shown). No difference in the p38 MAPK protein level was observed in these experiments (data not shown), indicating that the kinase activity changes induced by UVB irradiation were due to post-translational modifications of pre-existing enzyme molecules. Irradiation of HaCaT cells with similar UVB doses resulted in the characteristic morphological features of cells undergoing apoptosis; cells appeared shrunk and apoptotic bodies were clearly visible (Fig. 1 B,b). Fluorescent microscopic analysis with Hoechst 33342 showed that the nuclei of untreated cells were uniformly stained indicating unaltered nuclei (Fig. 1 B, c), whereas exposure to UVB resulted in nuclear condensation and fragmentation (Fig. 1 B, d). About 60–75% of the cells underwent apoptosis 24 h after UVB irradiation. Furthermore, under these conditions, less than 10% of the cells were stained with propidium iodide or trypan blue (data not shown). Since these two dyes label necrotic cells and, in some cases, cells at the late stages of apoptosis, we can conclude that apoptosis was the predominant, if not the only, type of cell death induced by 60 mJ/cm2 UVB. The induction of apoptosis in UVB-treated cells was further corroborated by the time-dependent activation of pro-caspase-3 as determined by Western blot (Fig. 1 C) and DEVDase activity (see Fig.2 C). Pro-caspase-3 activation became apparent at 16 h after irradiation and remained sustained up to 24–30 h. Dose-response analysis indicated that the pro-caspase-3 activity was maximally induced at the UVB dose of 60 mJ/cm2(data not shown). Correspondingly, the cleavage of PARP (Fig.1 D), a substrate of caspase-3 and -7, followed kinetics that overlapped with those of the pro-caspase-3 processing and DEVD-amc cleavage activity. To evaluate the contribution of the mitochondrial pathway to the process of UVB-induced cell death, we first analyzed the kinetics of cytochrome c release into the cytosol of irradiated HaCaT cells. Fig. 2 A shows that cytosolic cytochrome c was detected 8 h after irradiation and attained maximum levels in 24–30 h after UVB treatment. In addition, Fig. 2 B shows that, concomitant to the translocation of cytochrome c into the cytosol, the processing of caspase-8 was also taking place, in agreement with previous studies implicating this caspase activity in the process of UV-induced apoptosis (4.Kulms D.

Chem. 1997; 272: 25783-25786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). These observations also indicate that the mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase-8 activation are among the earliest apoptotic events in the dying HaCaT cells, clearly preceding the typical cell morphologic and nuclear changes as well as the induction of DEVDase activity (Fig.2 C) and pro-caspase-3 processing (Fig. 1 C). Recent studies have shown that activated caspase-8 can mediate mitochondrial cytochrome c release through the cleavage of the pro-apoptotic protein Bid (13.Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar). Therefore, we explored the possibility that the processing of Bid could be implicated in the release of cytochrome c in our system as well. As shown in Fig. 2 D, UVB irradiation of HaCaT cells caused a time-dependent proteolysis of Bid. However, Bid processing was a rather late event occurring significantly only 24 h after irradiation. This suggests that Bid cleavage cannot be the cause of the initial release of cytochrome c in UVB-treated HaCaT cells but may represent a mechanism to maintain high level of cytosolic cytochrome c in the dying cells. Furthermore, the initial release of cytochrome c following UVB irradiation was not significantly affected by caspase inhibitors (see Fig. 5 E), suggesting that, in irradiated cells, caspase-8 activation and cytochrome c release are mediated by two independent pathways. To assess the role of the sustained activation of p38 MAPK during UVB-induced apoptosis, we used its specific pharmacological cell permeant inhibitor PD169316. This is a powerful inhibitor of the p38 MAPK belonging to the class of imidazole-based compounds used both in vivo and in vitro to assess the specific involvement of the p38 MAPK pathway in many physiological processes (22.Boehm J.C. Smietana J.M. Sorenson M.E. Garigipati R.S. Gallagher T.F. Sheldrake P.L. Bradbeer J. Badger A.M. Laydon J.T. Lee J.C. Hillegass L.M. Griswold D.E. Breton J.J. Chabot-Fletcher M.C. Adams J.L. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 3929-3937Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Cell treatment with this drug inhibited the myelin basic protein phosphotransferase activity of p38 MAPK in immunoprecipitation kinase assays without affecting the activities of either JNK1 or ERK2 (data not shown). In addition, the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk and the inhibitor of caspase-3-like caspases zDEVD-fmk were used to analyze the contribution of the initiator (caspase-8) and/or effector (caspase-3) caspases, respectively, in the process of UVB-induced apoptosis. Thus, HaCaT cells were pretreated with zVAD-fmk, zDEVD-fmk, or different concentrations of PD169316 before irradiation and the level of apoptosis was analyzed 24 h after UVB treatment. Fig.3 shows that all inhibitors could counteract, albeit to different extents, the UVB-induced apoptosis. Clearly, pretreatment with zVAD-fmk resulted in a superior protection against apoptosis in comparison to zDEVD-fmk, in agreement with its broad spectrum caspase inhibitory activity (23.Ekert P.G. Silke J. Vaux D.L. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1081-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The anti-apoptotic effect of the PD169316 pretreatment was dose-dependent and could be observed at concentrations as low as 2.5 μm. In addition, pretreatment of the cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) prior to irradiation did not result in a significant protection against UVB-induced apoptosis (data not shown), suggesting that newly synthesized proteins are likely not required for this process. In order to confirm that the observed anti-apoptotic activities of the inhibitors were not due to a mere delay in the apoptotic process, we looked into their long term effects on cell proliferation. Fig.4 shows that, when pretreated with either zVAD-fmk or PD169316, UVB-irradiated cells started to proliferate following a brief cell cycle arrest. Fig. 4 also confirmed that zVAD-fmk was the most effective inhibitor as the pretreated cells begun to actively proliferate 24 h after irradiation and became nearly confluent in 3 days. The combined pretreatment with zVAD-fmk and PD169316 did not result in an additional protective effect when compared with cells pretreated with zVAD-fmk alone. We next analyzed the effects of these inhibitors at the biochemical level. As shown in Fig. 5 A, both zVAD-fmk and zDEVD-fmk completely prevented the cleavage of PARP, whereas pretreatment of cells with PD169316 significantly inhibited its cleavage in a dose-dependent manner. As expected, both caspase inhibitors, zVAD-fmk and zDEVD-fmk, completely obliterated the DEVD-caspase activity in UVB-irradiated HaCaT cells (Fig.5 B). In agreement with the results of the PARP cleavage, PD169316 also significantly inhibited the DEVDase activity (Fig.5 B). Western blot analysis revealed that the inhibitors suppressed the cleavage of pro-caspase-3 as well (data not shown). We were also interested in evaluating the effect of the inhibitors on the UVB-induced cleavage of Bid. As shown in Fig. 5 C, the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk was the most efficient in counteracting Bid degradation. The inhibition of DEVD-directed caspases only partially reduced, while p38 MAPK inhibition did not affect Bid cleavage at all (Fig. 5 C). This observation suggests that the extrinsic, death receptor-induced caspase-8 signaling pathway is likely to be the most relevant mediator of Bid cleavage while the p38 MAPK pathway does not contribute to this process. In addition, Fig. 5 D(left panel) shows that the UVB-induced processing of pro-caspase-8 in HaCaT cells was not affected by PD169316 pretreatment and that, in turn, the caspase inhibitors did not interfere with the p38 MAPK activation (Fig. 5 D,right panel). As suggested above, this result indicates that UVB initiates multiple pathways independently. Pretreatment of the cells with either zVAD-fmk or zDEVD-fmk had no effect on the level of cytochrome c released 16 h after irradiation (Fig. 5 E). This result implies that caspase activity is not required for the early release of cytochromec following UVB treatment, in agreement with the results of the delayed Bid cleavage (Fig. 2 D). Importantly, cell pretreatment with the p38 MAPK inhibitor PD169316 resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of the mitochondrial cytochromec efflux, when used in the concentration range of 2.5–25 μm. These concentrations of PD169316 were also shown to severely inhibit downstream signaling events such as pro-caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage (Fig. 5, A and B). Therefore, these results indicate that the p38 MAPK pathway is an important mediator of the UVB-induced cytochrome c release from the mitochondria, the early phase of which appears to be independent of caspases. Taken together, our overall observations strongly suggest that the p38 MAPK activation is positioned upstream of pro-caspase-3 activation and functions as an important effector mechanism for the UVB-induced apoptosis in human keratinocytes by facilitating the mitochondrial efflux of cytochrome c. In the present study, we show that exposure of human keratinocytes to UVB induces the activation of p38 MAPK, cytochrome crelease, pro-caspase-8 and -3 activation, Bid cleavage, and apoptosis. In agreement with recent reports (7.Shimizu H. Banno Y. Sumi N. Naganawa T. Kitajima Y. Nozawa Y. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 769-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 19.Peus D. Vasa R.A. Beyerle A. Meves A. Krautmacher C. Pittelkow M.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 751-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), exposure of HaCaT cells to UVB led to a significant level of p38 MAPK activation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We have shown previously that similar doses of UVB also lead to a robust activation of JNK1 (with little effect on ERK2 activity) and a dramatic increase in the mRNA expression of the immediate early genes c-jun and c-fos (15.Assefa Z. Garmyn M. Bouillon R. Merlevede W. Vandenheede J.R. Agostinis P. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 108: 886-891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These events are parts of the “UV response” that is mediated by phosphorylation of preexisting transcription factors c-Jun and/or c-Fos, resulting in the enhanced transcription of AP-1-responsive genes (3.Herrlich P. Sachsenmaier C. Radler-Pohl A. Gebel S. Blattner C. Rahmsdorf H.J. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1994; 34: 381-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore, our results strongly implicate the p38 MAPK as well as the JNK pathway in the transmission of the UVB-induced stress responses in human keratinocytes. A number of studies have reported on the role of JNK in coupling cellular stress signals and specifically in the UV responses leading to the apoptotic cell death (16.Zanke B.W. Boudreau K Rubie E.

Chem. 1997; 272: 10110-10116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The role of ERK in protecting cells against these types of stress-induced apoptotic processes has also been reported recently (19.Peus D. Vasa R.A. Beyerle A. Meves A. Krautmacher C. Pittelkow M.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 751-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The functional role of p38 MAPK in cellular stress response is, however, less well understood and rather controversial. Some investigators have observed that p38 MAPK activation in calphostin C-induced apoptosis of glioma cells requires active caspases but is dispensable for cell death (24.Ozaki I. Tani E. Ikemoto H. Kitagawa H. Fujikawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5310-5317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Activation of p38 MAPK in Fas-treated Jurkat cells has also been shown to be dependent on the initiator caspases (25.Juo P. Kuo C.J. Reynolds S.E. Konz R.F. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Biemann H.P. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) but not on the executioner caspases (26.Toyoshima F. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and, in both cases, seemingly unrelated to the process of apoptosis. Other reports have indicated that p38 MAPK activation occurs either upstream or independent of caspases and mediates apoptosis induced by various stresses (UVC, hyperosmolarity, sphingosine) in human neutrophils (27.Frasch S.C. Nick J.A. Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Worthen G.S. Henson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8389-8397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In contrast, p38 MAPK activation has been shown to be protective against hypericin-induced apoptosis of HeLa cells (20.Assefa Z. Vantieghem A. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. Vandenheede J.R. Merlevede W. de Witte P. Agostinis P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8788-8796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In order to provide a possible role for the p38 MAPK activation in UVB-irradiated HaCaT cells, we investigated its function in the process of UVB-induced apoptosis. In line with other reports (4.Kulms D. Poppelmann B. Yarosh D. Luger T.A. Krutmann J. Schwarz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 14: 7974-7979Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 5.Takahashi H. Kinouchi M. Iizuka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 6.Aragane Y. Kulms D. Metze D. Wilkes G. Poppelmann B. Luger T.A. Schwarz T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), we present here strong evidence that apoptosis induced by UVB is a typical caspase-dependent process and we implicate the extrinsic pathway of caspase activation as an important component of the UVB-induced apoptotic process. Pretreatment of cells with the caspase inhibitors zVAD-fmk or zDEVD-fmk drastically inhibited or reduced, respectively, the UVB-induced apoptosis. In addition, the selective p38 MAPK inhibitor, PD169316, substantially counteracted the induction of apoptosis in irradiated HaCaT cells (Fig. 3). Both the caspase- and p38 MAPK inhibitors considerably prevented the UVB-induced pro-caspase-3 processing and activation (Fig. 5 B) as well as PARP cleavage (Fig.5 A). On the other hand, neither one of the caspase inhibitors had any effect on the activation of p38 MAPK (Fig.5 D, right panel), indicating that divergent pathways are elicited by UVB irradiation and that the p38 MAPK functions upstream of pro-caspase-3 activation. Our results show that cytochrome c release is one of the earliest cellular responses to UVB irradiation (Fig. 2), evidently preceding pro-caspase-3 activation and the onset of apoptotic morphological changes. Interesting and novel observations were made by analyzing the effect of the different inhibitors on the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c. The PD169316 pretreatment strongly counteracted the UVB-induced cytochromec release, whereas neither one of the caspase inhibitors zVAD-fmk or zDEVD-fmk had any substantial effect on this process. This suggests that the UVB-induced release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria occurs independently of caspase activation and requires p38 MAPK activity. Previous reports have also shown that cytochrome c release induced by several apoptogenic stimuli, including UV irradiation, staurosporine, and overexpression of Bax, is independent of caspase activity (reviewed in Ref. 14.Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and precedes a reduction in mitochondrial transmembrane potential (28.Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). The observation that zVAD-fmk, while inhibiting pro-caspase-3 activation and apoptosis, does not prevent cytochrome c release, implies that it targets key components of the intrinsic (downstream of cytochrome c release) as well as the extrinsic pathway of caspase activation. Bearing in mind the inhibitory effects of PD169316 on caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage, our results strongly suggest that this inhibitor acts by counteracting the mitochondrial cytochromec release. Hence, p38 MAPK mediates pro-caspase-3 activation in UVB-irradiated cells by inducing the mitochondrial efflux of cytochrome c through as yet an unknown mechanism. Recent reports have shown that the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, which is structurally related to the PD169316, can trigger a significant, Ras-independent activation of c-Raf in certain cell lines in the concentration range of 8–25 μm (29.Hall-Jackson C.A. Goedert M. Hedge P. Cohen P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2047-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 30.Kalmes A. Deou J. Clowes A.W. Daum G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Activated Raf may phosphorylate and inactivate Bax, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, thereby preventing its cytochromec releasing activity. In our system, however, treatment of HaCaT cells with PD169316 concentrations up to 25 μm, either alone or in combination with UVB irradiation, did not induce any notable activation of c-Raf (data not shown). Moreover, as shown in Fig. 5, mitochondrial cytochrome c efflux and the PARP cleavage (data not shown) were considerably inhibited by PD169316 concentrations as low as 2.5 μm. Therefore, it is unlikely that this indirect effect of the p38 MAPK inhibitor can account for the prevention of cytochrome c release and protection against apoptosis in UVB-treated HaCaT cells. Recent reports have shown that, following UVC irradiation, p38 MAPK phosphorylates the tumor suppressor protein p53 at different Ser residues (31.Huang C. Ma W.Y. Maxiner A. Sun Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12229-12235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 32.Bulavin D.V. Saito S. Hollander M.C. Sakaguchi K. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Fornace Jr A.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6845-6854Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) thereby increasing its transcriptional activity (31.Huang C. Ma W.Y. Maxiner A. Sun Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12229-12235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Given the evidence that the mutated p53 in HaCaT cells may still have a role in apoptosis (33.Henseleit U. Zhang J. Wanner R. Haase I. Kolde G. Rosenbach T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 109: 722-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and that it contains the p38 phosphorylation sites (34.Lehman T.A. Modali R. Boukamp P. Stanek J. Bennett W.P. Welsh J.A. Metcalf R.A. Stampfer M.R. Fusenig N. Rogan E.M. Hurris C.C. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), an interesting hypothesis could be that p38 MAPK mediates mitochondrial cytochrome c release and apoptosis in a p53-dependent fashion. The mechanisms by which p53 mediates apoptosis are still unclear, and both transcriptional-dependent and -independent pathways seem to be involved (35.Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 36.Caelles C. Helmberg A. Karin M. Nature. 1994; 370: 220-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). In particular, a p53-mediated up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax (35.Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) could explain how p38 MAPK induces the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria of UVB-irradiated cells. However, in our system, UVB did not lead to any detectable transcriptional activation of Bax under apoptosis-inducing conditions 2Z. Assefa, unpublished results. and the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide did not protect HaCaT cells from apoptosis in agreement with previous findings (33.Henseleit U. Zhang J. Wanner R. Haase I. Kolde G. Rosenbach T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 109: 722-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems that the mechanism by which p38 MAPK induces mitochondrial cytochromec release and apoptosis in UVB-irradiated cells does not require the de novo protein synthesis, whether or not it involves p53 phosphorylation. In some cellular systems, the cleavage of Bid, a proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member, results in the translocation of cytochrome cfrom mitochondria to the cytoplasm (13.Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar). In UVB-treated cells, Bid cleavage took place after 20–24 h of irradiation (Fig. 2) indicating that it is not critical for the initial process of cell death. Whereas the pretreatment of cells with zVAD-fmk, and to a lesser extent with zDEVD-fmk, inhibited the UVB-induced Bid cleavage, PD169316 was without any effect (Fig. 5 C). Because PD169316 strongly inhibits pro-caspase-3 activation but does not affect pro-caspase-8 cleavage, this result suggests that caspase-8 is likely the main protease responsible for Bid cleavage in UVB-treated cells. Why Bid should be processed only at such a delayed time point is not clear. At most, Bid cleavage at such late stage of apoptosis may provide a means of maintaining high levels of cytosolic cytochrome c levels that could augment the process of cell death. Overall, our results provide new insights into the mechanisms involved in the process of apoptosis induced by UVB in human keratinocytes and identify a novel pathway mediated by the activation of p38 MAPK that leads to the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytosol, which significantly contributes to the induction of the apoptotic process.

Today. 1992; 13: 93-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). During neutrophil activation, L-selectin, which initially has a high basal expression, is shed while Mac-1 is increased 10–20-fold on the surface following mobilization of granule stores (5.Kishimoto T.K. Jutila M.A. Berg E.L. Butcher E.C. Science. 1989; 245: 1238-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). These changes in surface expression and affinity occur over seconds to minutes following stimulation (9.Simon S.I. Chambers J.D. Butcher E. Sklar L.A. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2765-2771PubMed Google Scholar).Once migrated to the site of tissue injury, the neutrophil's chief function becomes that of a secretory cell. In response to the ligation of L-selectin or chemotactic receptors, CD11b/CD18 is up-regulated from rapidly mobilized secretory granules (10.Todd III, R.F. Arnaout M.A. Rosin R.E. Crowley C.A.

Increasing intensity of stimulation results in the release of secondary (specific) and then primary (azurophil) granules, a process known as sequential degranulation (14.Bainton D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 58: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 15.Bentwood B.J. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1980; 124: 855-862PubMed Google Scholar). To a large extent, the extracellular release of specific and azurophil granules remains under separate control (14.Bainton D.F. J.

Chemoattractants and other substances selectively elicit the release of specific granules under conditions wherein azurophilic granule enzymes are not discharged (16.Niessen H.W.M. Verhoeven A.J.

On the other hand, stimuli for azurophilic granule release also stimulate concomitant exocytosis of specific granules (20.Estensen R.D. White J.G. Holmes B. Nature. 1974; 248: 347-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), with rare exceptions (17.Zaman W. Mitsuyama T. Hatakenaka M. Kang D. Minakami S. Takeshige K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 238-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The resistance of azurophil granules to secretion may be due to a requirement for a biochemical signal in addition to Ca2+(21.Niessen H.W. Kuijpers T.W. Roos D. Verhoeven A.J. Cell. Signal. 1991; 3: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).There is evidence that adhesion supported by β2-integrins or selectins can sensitize neutrophils for superoxide generation (22.Walzog B.

In this regard, cross-linking of L-selectin or Mac-1 with monoclonal antibody results in secretion of tertiary, but not primary, granules (25.Wize J. Sopata I. Smerdel A. Maslinski S. Inflamm. Res. 1998; 47: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Clustering of integrins and selectins triggers intracellular signals, including intracellular Ca2+ release and phosphorylation of several cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases (26.Crockett-Torabi E.

Published data indicate that some elements of a signaling pathway involving the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) are involved in signaling through both L-selectin and Mac-1 (28.Waddell T.K.

Immunol. 1997; 159: 952-963PubMed Google Scholar). However, to date there are no data linking the processes of adhesion and degranulation to signaling events involving p38 MAPK in neutrophils.In previous studies, we examined how concurrent signaling through chemotactic factors and L-selectin affected adhesive function (31.Tsang Y.T.M. Neelamegham S. Burns A.R. Berg E.L. Smith C.W. Simon S.I. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4566-4577PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Simon S.I. Burns A.R. Taylor A.D. Gopalan P.K. Lynam E.B. Sklar L.A. Smith C.W. J.

We showed that cross-linking of L-selectin, in the presence of IL-8, potentiated adhesion of Mac-1 and LFA-1 to ICAM-1 under physiologic conditions of shear flow (33.Gopalan P.K. Smith C.W. Lu H.F. Berg E.L. McIntire L.V. Simon S.I. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 367-375PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent transmigration on IL-1 stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells was also potentiated by L-selectin cross-linking (31.Tsang Y.T.M. Neelamegham S. Burns A.R. Berg E.L. Smith C.W. Simon S.I. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4566-4577PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Simon S.I. Burns A.R. Taylor A.D. Gopalan P.K. Lynam E.B. Sklar L.A. Smith C.W. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1502-1514PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, our objective was to determine whether L-selectin could influence the secretory functions of neutrophils. We examined whether antibody-induced clustering of L-selectin could potentiate the extent of degranulation in response to chemotactic stimulation. We show that cross-linking of L-selectin leads directly to phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. This response preceded activation of adhesion and priming of degranulation. Like shape change and activation of adhesion, L-selectin-mediated priming for secretion of secondary and tertiary granules was blocked by an inhibitor of p38 MAPK.RESULTSIn previous studies, we examined the process of chemotactic signaling on β2-integrin adhesive function (31.Tsang Y.T.M.

We reported that cross-linking of L-selectin and addition of PAF or IL-8 were synergistic in activation of resting neutrophils. Here we examined the release of primary, secondary, and tertiary granules from neutrophils in response to cross-linking of L-selectin and addition of IL-8.We first wished to determine if ligation of L-selectin could serve as a sensitizing agent for degranulation. Since CD11b/CD18 is contained in secondary, tertiary, and secretory granules in neutrophils (10.Todd III, R.F. Arnaout M.A. Rosin R.E. Crowley C.A. Peters W.A. Babior B.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 1280-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 11.Petrequin P.R. Todd III, R.F. Devall L.J. Boxer L.A. Curnutte III, J.T.

Borregaard N. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1467-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), the surface expression of the integrin should be enhanced if these labile pools are mobilized. In experiments not shown, we first determined that cross-linking of L-selectin enhanced degranulation induced by IL-8. We performed extensive dose-response studies with IL-8 and selected a concentration of 1 nm as optimal for further studies.As shown in Fig. 1 A, surface expression of Mac-1 was statistically greater than unstimulated control at 1 nm IL-8. Of greatest interest here is the observation that cross-linking of L-selectin, by treatment with two humanized antibodies that bind to distinct epitopes on the lectin domain (HuDREG200 and HuDREG55), also enhanced the display of Mac-1 (Fig.1 A). That is, background levels in the absence of IL-8 were significantly greater with cross-linking of L-selectin alone. Also, with cross-linking of L-selectin, the responses elicited by IL-8 were significantly greater than unstimulated levels.As Mac-1 is found in secondary, tertiary, and secretory granules, its expression at these low concentrations of agonist should reflect only the elaboration of the tertiary and secretory granules, the more labile of the pools (10.Todd III, R.F.

Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. Borregaard N. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1467-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). To examine secondary granules in this process, we measured lactoferrin in the cell supernatants (Fig. 1 B). In the absence of any other condition, only a small amount of lactoferrin was released in response to IL-8. In contrast, cross-linking of L-selectin alone and in combination with 1 nm IL-8 produced significant release of lactoferrin.The granule type most resistant to release is the azurophil, from which we measured both myeloperoxidase (MPO) and β-glucuronidase. As can be seen in Fig. 1 C, release of MPO was not statistically significant except in the strongest stimulatory conditions of IL-8 plus cross-linking. Similar results were found with β-glucuronidase release (Fig. 1 D), with the exception of a statistically significant enhancement of degranulation induced by 1 nmIL-8 alone. Taken together, the data show that IL-8 is a weak inducer of degranulation (at these relatively low concentrations), but its effect is significantly enhanced by co-stimulation with L-selectin.We confirmed that cross-linking of L-selectin enhanced adhesive function. This was measured as an increase in the binding of albumin-coated latex beads to neutrophils, a process that is dependent on the activation of Mac-1 (Fig. 2). Unstimulated neutrophils sheared in suspension with beads did not increase their adhesiveness over time. In response to stimulation with IL-8 at a relatively low concentration of 0.1 nm, a significant increase in bead binding was detected over the time course of stimulation (Fig. 2). A much stronger response was elicited through cross-linking of L-selectin with a secondary antibody. The combination of co-stimulation through L-selectin and IL-8 tended to increase the extent of bead binding over activation through L-selectin alone.Figure 2Neutrophil adhesion to albumin-coated latex beads in response to stimulation through cross-linking of L-selectin and IL-8. Neutrophil adhesion was stimulated by addition of 0.1 nm IL-8 and/or L-selectin cross-linking (20 μg/ml HuDREG200 cross-linked with 10 μg/ml goat anti-human IgG). Data represent the number of beads bound to cells at each time point before and after stimulation relative to the number bound to untreated (typically 0.5–1 bead/PMN). Plotted are the kinetics of adhesion from one experiment representative of five separate donors.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Previous work had implicated MAP kinases in signaling through adhesion molecules and in chemotactic stimulation of superoxide production (45.Detmers P.A. Zhou D.H. Polizzi E. Thieringer R. Hanlon W.A. Vaidya S. Bansal V. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1921-1929PubMed Google Scholar,46.Ng-Sikorski J. Lindén L. Eierman D. Franzen L. Molony L. Andersson T. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2361-2369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, p38 MAPK has been recently shown to be involved in signaling through β2-integrins (45.Detmers P.A. Zhou D.H. Polizzi E. Thieringer R. Hanlon W.A. Vaidya S. Bansal V. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1921-1929PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether the sensitization induced by cross-linking L-selectin by addition of both HuDREG200 and HuDREG55 involved activation of p38 MAPK in the signaling pathway. We tested this using a high affinity inhibitor of p38 MAPK synthesized by Merck Research Laboratories, designated Merck C (47.Liverton N.J. Butcher J.W. Claiborne C.F. Claremon D.A. Libby B.E. Nguyen K.T. Pitzenberger S.M. Selnick H.G. Smith G.R. Tebben R. Vacca J.P. Varga S.L. Agarwal L. Dancheck K. Forsyth A.J. Fletcher D.S. Frantz B. Hanlon W.A. Harper C.P. Hofsess S.J. Kotsura M.

Merck C is a potent and specific blocker of p38 MAPK, with an IC50 of 0.24 nm for isolated enzyme and an IC50 of ∼2.2 nm for inhibition of p38-induced cellular function. Merck A is a non-functional isomer that has a similar chemical composition (47.Liverton N.J. Butcher J.W. Claiborne C.F. Claremon D.A. Libby B.E. Nguyen K.T. Pitzenberger S.M. Selnick H.G. Smith G.R. Tebben R. Vacca J.P. Varga S.L. Agarwal L. Dancheck K. Forsyth A.J. Fletcher D.S. Frantz B. Hanlon W.A. Harper C.P. Hofsess S.J. Kotsura M. Lin J. Luell S. O'Neill E.A. Orevillo C.J. Pang M. Parsons J. Rolando A. Sahly Y. Visco D.M. O'Keefe S.J. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 2180-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). To determine the effective concentration for inhibition of neutrophil activation, we analyzed cell shape change stimulated by cross-linking of L-selectin. As shown in Fig. 3, Merck C was a potent inhibitor of shape change at all concentrations tested. In contrast, Merck A elicited modest inhibition of shape change only at a concentration of 100 nm. Based upon these results, Merck C was used at concentrations of 3 nm or greater for inhibition of L-selectin induced activation. Merck A, which exhibited no inhibitory activity in this dose range, served as a nonspecific control for Merck C. Incubation of neutrophils with the Merck compounds at concentrations up to 50 nm for 1 h at 37 °C did not result in any increase in cell lysis or death (not shown; see “Experimental Procedures”).Figure 3Neutrophil shape change in response to cross-linking of L-selectin and inhibition of p38 MAPK. Neutrophils (106/ml) were preincubated with Merck compounds at the indicated concentrations for 45 min at 37 °C. Cell samples were stimulated by cross-linking L-selectin as described under “Experimental Procedures” and then fixed and the morphology was assessed using a phase-contrast microscope. Cells were scored based on their shape change response to cross-linking L-selectin. Maximum response was defined as the fraction of cells with extensive ruffling of the plasma membrane and pseudopod formation. Data shown are the fraction of cells responding to L-selectin stimulation in the presence of Merck compounds. The data were compiled from two experiments for Merck A and from four experiments for Merck C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next assessed whether cross-linking L-selectin by the binding of the two humanized DREG mAbs would elicit phosphorylation of p38 MAPK that could be inhibited by Merck C. Using commercial antibodies specific for the dually phosphorylated state of p38 MAPK, we found that cross-linking of L-selectin enhanced phosphorylation within 1 min. Compared with the untreated control, an increase in the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK of as much as 7-fold was detected (Fig.4 a). The pattern of p38 MAPK phosphorylation showed a decrease at 2 min and a second peak at 3–5 min. These kinetics varied only slightly between experiments, as shown in the densitometry results from four separate experiments (Fig.4 b). As can be seen, the peak of phosphorylation at 1 min and the succeeding drop at 2 min were statistically significant. It should be noted that a minor proteolytic product of p38 was occasionally evident (see 1 min point in Fig. 4 a).Figure 4a, ligation of L-selectin and the kinetics of phosphorylation of the MAP kinases. Neutrophils (5 × 106/ml) were preincubated with Merck A or Merck C (10 nm) for 45 min at 37 °C and stimulated in the presence of HuDreg200 and HuDREG55 added together at 10 μg/ml for between 1 and 10 min. Reactions were stopped by centrifugation and cell pellets were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and suspended in ice-cold lysis buffer. The supernatants were resolved using 12% discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide gels, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and the dually phosphorylated forms of: A, p38 MAPK on Thr180/Tyr182, andB, p44/42 MAP kinase (ERK1/2) on Thr202/Tyr204 were detected by Western blot analysis. Shown are the kinetics from unstimulated cells and those incubated for the indicated time with anti-L-selectins. Merck A- and C-treated samples correspond to 5-min incubations with anti-L-selectins. b, densitometric analysis of the kinetics of phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. Four experiments were conducted in which the dually phosphorylated form of p38 MAPK was detected as ina. Equal loading of the lanes was verified using Western blots to p38 MAPK protein or ERK1/2 protein. The intensities of the bands for doubly phosphorylated p38 MAPK were measured with Adobe Photoshop and corrected for background intensities. The intensities in each experiment were normalized using the maximum point in each experiment (generally the 1 min point). The data are expressed as the mean (± S.E., n = 4) of these relative intensities. The p values were determined by one-way ANOVA with significance between indicated groups analyzed by a Newman-Keuls post-test. c, densitometric analysis of the kinetics of phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Two experiments were conducted in which double phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was detected as described ina. The intensities were measured and analyzed as detailed in the legend to a. The data are expressed as the mean (± S.E., n = 2) of the relative intensities. d,MAPK activity and Merck dependent inhibition. Activation of MAPK kinase in response to cross-linking of L-selectin was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures” by measuring the incorporation of radiolabeled phosphate [γ-33P]ATP into heat shock protein-27 (hsp-27), the downstream substrate of p38 MAPK. Neutrophils were preincubated for 45 min at 37 °C in the absence or presence of Merck A or Merck C (5 nm). Phosphorylation of hsp-27 was resolved by SDS-PAGE and the gel was subjected to PhosphorImager quantitation. The intensities were normalized as fractions of unstimulated control samples. Data are shown as kinase activity corresponding to cross-linked L-selectin (X-Link) in the presence of Merck compounds relative to controls from five separate experiments (mean ± S.E., * represents p< 0.05 compared with X-Link alone).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (p44/42 MAP kinase) also increased during this time period, but was delayed in onset (Fig. 4 a). The lower of the bands, ERK2, was the most prominent following ligation with L-selectin. Fig. 4 c shows the combined densitometry results from two experiments, indicating that peak phosphorylation of ERK1/2 occurred at 5–10 min. Merck C almost completely inhibited the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, but not ERK1/2. We confirmed that Merck C, at concentrations up to 30 nm, had no effect upon the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, using a potent stimulus for these phosphoproteins (5 ng/ml granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor; data not shown). The control compound, Merck A had no effect on either phosphoprotein.As shown in Fig. 4 d, we also confirmed that the tyrosine-phosphorylated p38 MAPK that was induced by cross-linking L-selectin was effective at phosphorylating its downstream substrate MAPK-activated protein (heat shock protein hsp27). Preincubation with Merck A did not alter the kinase activity, whereas Merck C blocked p38 MAPK activity to baseline values.We next determined whether stimulation of degranulation was dependent upon p38 MAPK and inhibitable by Merck C. As shown in Fig.5, Merck C did not significantly inhibit the release of azurophil granules (MPO and β-glucuronidase). However, up-regulation of Mac-1, the tertiary and secretory granule marker, showed statistically significant inhibition with Merck C. This inhibition occurred with stimulation through L-selectin alone, and thus paralleled the observed activation of Mac-1 adhesive function. Inhibition of the release of lactoferrin, the secondary granule marker, was significant for both cross-linking alone and co-stimulation with IL"

We identify FtsJ, the first encoded protein of the ftsJ-hflB heat shock operon, as anEscherichia coli methyltransferase of the 23 S rRNA. The methylation reaction requiresS-adenosylmethionine as donor of methyl groups, purified FtsJ or a S150 supernatant from an FtsJ-producing strain, and ribosomes from an FtsJ-deficient strain. In vitro, FtsJ does not efficiently methylate ribosomes purified from a strain producing FtsJ, suggesting that these ribosomes are already methylatedin vivo by FtsJ. FtsJ is active on ribosomes and on the 50 S ribosomal subunit, but is inactive on free rRNA, suggesting that its natural substrate is ribosomes or a pre-ribosomal ribonucleoprotein particle. We identified the methylated nucleotide as 2′-O-methyluridine 2552, by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography analysis, boronate affinity chromatography, and hybridization-protection experiments.

InEscherichia coli, it is composed of 23, 16, and 5 S ribosomal RNAs and of about 52 proteins. Twenty-one of them assemble with the 16 S rRNA to form the 30 S ribosomal subunit, while the 31 others assemble with the 23 and 5 S rRNA to form the 50 S ribosomal subunit (1.Noller H.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 191-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Ribosomal proteins and rRNAs cooperate both in the assembly and in the activity of the ribosome (1.Noller H.F. Annu. Rev.

The functional domains of the ribosome include a GTPase center, a peptidyl transferase center, and A-, P-, and E-tRNA binding sites; they involve specific regions of the rRNAs and one or several ribosomal proteins (1.Noller H.F.

The mature E. coli 16 and 23 S rRNAs have 10 and 14 methylated nucleotides, respectively (2.Tscherne J.S. Nurse K. Popienick P. Michel H. Sochacki M. Ofengand J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1884-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 3.Smith J.E. Cooperman B.S. Mitchell P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10825-10834Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The methyl groups are clustered at the functional domains, e.g. the A- and P-tRNA binding sites for 16 S rRNA, and the peptidyltransferase center for 23 S rRNA (4.Cooperman B.S. Weitzmann C.J. Fernandez C.L. Hill W.L. Dahlerg A. Garrett R.A. Moore P.B. Schlessinger D. Warner J.R. The Ribosome: Structure, Function, and Evolution. 182. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1990: 491-501Google Scholar). Most of the modified nucleotides are conserved (5.Mueller F. Brimacombe R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 524-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar); however, their functions are poorly understood. It has been suggested that methylation could modulate rRNA maturation, affect stability of rRNA structures, or alter translation rates. The nucleotide methylation of rRNAs can modify the susceptibility of ribosomes to antibiotics that target them (6.Cundiffe E. Hill W.L. Dahlerg A. Garrett R.A. Moore P.B. Schlessinger D. Warner J.R. The Ribosome: Structure, Function, and Evolution. 182. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1990: 479-490Google Scholar); it is reasonable to expect that the binding of other ligands can be affected as well. In E. coli, three 16 S RNA methyltransferases have been identified, RsmA (also known as KsgA) (7.van Buul C.P. van Knippenberg P.H. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 38: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), RsmB (2.Tscherne J.S. Nurse K. Popienick P. Michel H. Sochacki M. Ofengand J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1884-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 8.Gu X.R. Gustafsson C. Ku J., Yu, M. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4053-4057Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and RsmC (9.Tscherne J.S. Nurse K. Popienick P. Ofengand J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 924-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In contrast, little is known about genes involved in 23 S rRNA modifications. The 23 S rRNA displays 23 nucleotide modifications, of which 14 correspond to methylation. Recently, the rrmA gene encoding a 23 S rRNA methyltransferase that forms m1G745 was identified (10.Gustafsson C. Persson B.C. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 359-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that the heat shock protein FtsJ methylates the 50 S ribosomal subunit on its 23 S rRNA in vitro. ftsJis the upstream gene of a bi-cistronic operon that includeshflB (also known as ftsH) (11.Ogura T. Tomoyasu T. Yuki T. Morimura S. Begg K.J. Donachie W.D. Mori H. Niki H. Hiraga S. Res. Microbiol. 1991; 142: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 12.Herman C. Ogura T. Tomoyasu T.

Whereas the HflB heat shock protease has been extensively studied, the function of FtsJ had not yet been characterized. In view of its newly established function, FtsJ has been renamed RrmJ and its encoding gene,rrmJ.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we show that RrmJ methylates the 23 S RNA of the 50 S ribosomal subunit in vitro. The methylation reaction requires S-adenosylmethionine as donor of methyl groups, ribosomes from an rrmJ-deficient strain, and purified RrmJ or a S150 supernatant from a RrmJ-producing strain. The requirement for ribosomes from a strain deficient in RrmJ as methyl acceptor suggests that the in vitro methylation described in this work reflects in vivo methylation of 23 S ribosomal RNA by RrmJ. The inability of ribosomes from wild type strains to act as substrate for in vitro methylation reactions has been reported by others (15.Alix J.H. Hayes D. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 139-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The fact that ribosomes from the wild type strain grown in normal conditions at 37 °C are poor acceptors of methyl groups in vitro suggests that RrmJ methylates these ribosomes in vivo, even in the absence of heat shock. However, a residual ability to accept labeled methyl groups, compared with an inability of ribosomes from RrmJ-overproducing strains to do so, suggests that they are not completely methylated. This opens the possibility for a stress-dependent methylation of ribosomal RNA in vivo by the heat shock protein RrmJ.23 S ribosomal RNA is clearly identified as the substrate of RrmJ methyltransferase; purified RrmJ incorporates methyl groups into a band which migrates as 23 S RNA, and 50 S ribosomal particles but not 30 S ribosomal particles can act as methyl acceptors. Consequently, the radioactive band around 16 S RNA observed in the presence of crude extracts probably results from a degradation of 23 S RNA into 16 S RNA. Such degradation of 23 S RNA has frequently been observed (1.Noller H.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 191-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar).RrmJ methyltransferase is active on ribosomes or ribosomal particles, rather than on free RNA. This property is shared by RsmA and RsmC enzymes (9.Tscherne J.S. Nurse K. Popienick P. Ofengand J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 924-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 32.Poldermans B. Roza L. Van Knippenberg P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9094-9100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and is true of most rRNA-modifying enzymes, with the exception of RsmB (2.Tscherne J.S. Nurse K. Popienick P. Michel H. Sochacki M. Ofengand J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1884-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). RrmJ-mediated methylation requires magnesium; this requirement has also been reported for activity of other rRNA methyltransferases, and appears to be characteristic of reactions involving ribosomes or ribosomal particles (9.Tscherne J.S. Nurse K. Popienick P. Ofengand J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 924-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).Little is known about the physiological roles of ribosomal RNA methylation, since most experiments have been made in vitro, and since only few rRNA methyltransferases have been identified. Ribosomes reconstituted in vitro with completely unmodified rRNA are active, suggesting a minor role of RNA methylation in ribosome function. In contrast, mutations of 23 S ribosomal RNAs at several methyl-modified regions have dramatic effects on cell viability, reflecting the importance of these sites for proper ribosome functionin vivo. FtsJ catalyzes a 2′-O-ribose methylation of Um-2552. This is a universally conserved nucleotide within the peptidyltransferase center of domain V of the large subunit rRNA (33.Moazed D. Noller H.F. Cell. 1989; 57: 585-597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Um-2552 is adjacent to bases protected by tRNA bound in the A site (33.Moazed D. Noller H.F. Cell. 1989; 57: 585-597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), and mutations in one of these bases, U-2555, affects translational accuracy (34.O'Connor M. Dalberg A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9214-9218Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The growth properties, translation properties, polysomes profile and antibiotic sensitivity of theftsJ-deficient strain are under investigation.In E. coli, the rluA, rluC, andrluD (35.Raychaudhuri S. Niu L. Conrad J. Lane B.G. Ofengand J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18880-18886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) genes encode pseudouridine synthase, which modifies 23 S rRNA. Curiously, an allele of rluD is a suppressor of a thermosensitive mutation in hflB, the downstream gene of the rrmJ-hflB operon.hflB encodes an ATP-dependent protease involved in the degradation of s32 and other substrates. These observations raise the possibility that the rrmJ-hflB operon might encode two proteins involved in ribosomal regulation.RrmJ homologues are found in eubacteria, archea, and eukaryotes. However, among 24 completely sequenced microorganisms, only 9 of them encode putative RrmJ homologues. If the rRNA methylation mediated by RrmJ is conserved, it could be performed by methylases lacking obvious sequence similarities with RrmJ. Surprisingly, the JM 23 human protein encoded by chromosome X has 35% identity (52% conserved) over 192 amino acids with RrmJ, suggesting that, in at least certain higher organisms, rRNA methylation could be performed by an enzyme closely related to the E. coli RrmJ. The ribosome is a complex ribonucleoprotein particle that is responsible for translation of messenger RNAs into proteins. InEscherichia coli, it is composed of 23, 16, and 5 S ribosomal RNAs and of about 52 proteins. Twenty-one of them assemble with the 16 S rRNA to form the 30 S ribosomal subunit, while the 31 others assemble with the 23 and 5 S rRNA to form the 50 S ribosomal subunit (1.Noller H.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 191-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Ribosomal proteins and rRNAs cooperate both in the assembly and in the activity of the ribosome (1.Noller H.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 191-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar).

In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated human monocytic THP-1 cells, glucocorticoids acted primarily on the TNF-α promoter to suppress a burst of transcriptional activity that occurred between 90 min and 3 h after LPS exposure. LPS increased nuclear c-Jun/ATF-2, NF-κB1/Rel-A, and Rel-A/C-Rel transcription factor complexes, which bound specifically to oligonucleotide sequences from the −106 to −88 base pair (bp) region of the promoter. The glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, suppressed nuclear binding activity of these complexes prior to and during the critical phase of TNF-α transcription. Site-directed mutagenesis in TNF-α promoter-luciferase reporter constructs showed that the adjacent c-Jun/ATF-2 (−106 to −99 bp) and NF-κB (−97 to −88 bp) binding sites each contributed to the LPS-stimulated expression. Mutating both sites largely prevented dexamethasone from suppressing TNF-α promoter-luciferase reporters. LPS exposure also increased nuclear Egr-1 and PU.1 abundance. The Egr-1/Sp1 (−172 to −161 bp) binding sites and the PU.1-binding Ets site (−116 to −110 bp) each contributed to the LPS-stimulated expression but not to glucocorticoid response. Dexamethasone suppressed the abundance of the c-Fos/c-Jun complex in THP-1 cell nuclei, but there was no direct evidence for c-Fos/c-Jun transactivation through sites in the −172 to −52 bp region. Small contributions to glucocorticoid response were attributable to promoter sequences outside the −172 to −88 bp region and to sequences in the TNF-α 3′-untranslated region. We conclude that glucocorticoids suppress LPS-stimulated secretion of TNF-α from human monocytic cells largely through antagonizing transactivation by c-Jun/ATF-2 and NF-κB complexes at binding sites in the −106 to −88 bp region of the TNF-α promoter.

The glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, suppressed nuclear binding activity of these complexes prior to and during the critical phase of TNF-α transcription. Site-directed mutagenesis in TNF-α promoter-luciferase reporter constructs showed that the adjacent c-Jun/ATF-2 (−106 to −99 bp) and NF-κB (−97 to −88 bp) binding sites each contributed to the LPS-stimulated expression. Mutating both sites largely prevented dexamethasone from suppressing TNF-α promoter-luciferase reporters. LPS exposure also increased nuclear Egr-1 and PU.1 abundance. The Egr-1/Sp1 (−172 to −161 bp) binding sites and the PU.1-binding Ets site (−116 to −110 bp) each contributed to the LPS-stimulated expression but not to glucocorticoid response. Dexamethasone suppressed the abundance of the c-Fos/c-Jun complex in THP-1 cell nuclei, but there was no direct evidence for c-Fos/c-Jun transactivation through sites in the −172 to −52 bp region. Small contributions to glucocorticoid response were attributable to promoter sequences outside the −172 to −88 bp region and to sequences in the TNF-α 3′-untranslated region. We conclude that glucocorticoids suppress LPS-stimulated secretion of TNF-α from human monocytic cells largely through antagonizing transactivation by c-Jun/ATF-2 and NF-κB complexes at binding sites in the −106 to −88 bp region of the TNF-α promoter. tumor necrosis factor actinomycin D activating transcription factor activator protein-1 CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein cAMP-response element CRE-binding protein electrophoretic mobility shift assay lipopolysaccharide untranslated region base pair(s) dexamethasone The glucocorticoids are prototypic anti-inflammatory drugs, with wide ranging effects on inflammatory cells and tissues.

Thanos D. Goldfeld A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5232-5244Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Factors binding to the CRE/ATF site (−106 to −99 bp) and the NF-κB site (−97 to −88 bp) site co-operate functionally in both monocytic and lymphocytic cells (9.Yao J. Mackman N. Edgington T.S.

There is also evidence for cooperativity between the CRE/ATF site and the immediately upstream Ets-like site at −116 to −110 bp (25.Kramer B. Wiegmann K. Kronke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6577-6583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). LPS, the stimulus used in these studies, activates monocyte/macrophage cells through Toll-like receptors 2 and 4, binding in association with the glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored surface glycoprotein, CD14 (26.Poltorak A.

Glucocorticoids have pleiotropic actions on cytokine expression by monocyte/macrophages, suppressing gene transcription (29.Han J. Huez G. Beutler B. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 1843-1848PubMed Google Scholar), reducing mRNA stability (30.Amano Y. Lee S.W. Allison A.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 176-182PubMed Google Scholar), or reducing mRNA translational efficiency (31.Han J. Thompson P. Beutler B. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). In LPS-stimulated human THP-1 monocytic cells, glucocorticoids suppress TNF-α promoter activity (18.Joyce D.A. Steer J.H. Abraham L.J. Inflammation Res. 1997; 46: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In murine RAW macrophages, glucocorticoids also suppress TNF-α transcription and, more importantly, inhibit translation of TNF-α mRNA (31.Han J. Thompson P. Beutler B. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). The effect on translation is at least partially mediated through suppression of Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase activity (16.Swantek J.L. Cobb M.H. Geppert T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6274-6282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like the 3′-UTR of murine TNF-α, the 3′-UTR of human TNF-α includes an AU-rich region, which indicates potential for regulation through mRNA stability or translational efficiency (32.Han J. Beutler B. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1990; 1: 71-75PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we identify transcriptional suppression as the main mechanism for glucocorticoid suppression of TNF-α expression in THP-1 monocytic cells. Transcriptional suppression is largely due to diminished transactivation through sites in the −106 to −88 bp region of the promoter and is associated with reduced binding activity of transcription factor complexes containing NF-κB factors and c-Jun/ATF-2. The human promonocytic cell line, THP-1, and the murine macrophage cell line, RAW264.7, were obtained from ATCC. Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (THP-1) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (RAW264.7) with 10% low endotoxin fetal bovine serum (CSL, Melbourne, Australia), penicillin, and gentamicin. Fetal bovine serum was charcoal-stripped to remove endogenous glucocorticoids (33.Eckert R.L. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 139-144PubMed Google Scholar). All media and additives were checked for endotoxin contamination using the Limulus amebocyte lysate test (BioWhittaker Inc., Walkersville, MD) and rejected if endotoxin concentration exceeded 0.1 unit/ml. All glassware was baked prior to use, and all plasticware was new. The TNF-α promoter fragment −993 to +110 (which includes the 5′-UTR) and the TNF-α 3′-UTR +1957 to +2792 fragment were amplified from genomic DNA, as described previously (34.Kroeger K.M. Carville K.S. Abraham L.J. Mol. Immunol. 1997; 34: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). The promoter fragment was cloned into theSacI and HindIII restriction sites located upstream of the luciferase gene in the pGL2-Basic plasmid (Promega) to create the TNF-Luc-SV40 reporter gene construct. The 3′-UTR in this construct is SV40-derived and includes the SV40 polyadenylation signal. The 3′-UTR of TNF-α was cloned into this construct to replace the SV40 3′-UTR after digestion at the PflMI andBamHI sites, creating TNF-Luc-TNF. The same procedure was used to clone the TNF-α 3′-UTR into pGL2-Promoter. The resulting construct includes the SV40 early promoter and is designatedSV40-Luc-TNF. There is a consensus NF-κB site downstream of the 3′-UTR in the mouse and human genomes (35.Kuprash D.V. Udalova I.A. Turetskaya R.L. Rice N.R. Nedospasov S.A. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 97-106PubMed Google Scholar), which was not included in these reporters. The pGL2-Promoter vector (SV40-Luc-SV40) itself also served as a control. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to alter putative binding sites in the promoter region of TNF-Luc-SV40 andTNF-Luc-TNF, using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and appropriate oligonucleotide sequences (Fig. 1). Mutated sequences were confirmed by restriction digestion of the mutated site. DNA was prepared for transfection using the EndoFree™ Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen). The 3κB-Luc-SV40 reporter, which contains three Ig NF-κB sites from the interferon-β gene (36.Akama K.T. Albanese C. Pestell R.G. Van Eldik L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5795-5800Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) upstream of the luciferase coding region of the pGL2-basic plasmid, was kindly provided by Dr. D. Baltimore. Plasmids were diluted to 100 ng·μl−1 in endotoxin-free water, and 5 μl was mixed with 4 μl of 50 μg/μl DEAE-dextran (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). This was mixed with 250 μl of HEPES-buffered RPMI medium (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, without antibiotics) and left at room temperature for 30 min. Prior to transfection, 1.2 × 107 THP-1 cells were washed in RPMI/HEPES, pelleted, and then resuspended in 750 μl of RPMI/HEPES. The cells and DEAE-dextran-plasmid mixture were mixed in a well of a 24-well plate (Costar). After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, cells were washed twice in RPMI/HEPES and resuspended in RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Transfected cells were distributed into remaining wells of the 24-well plate at 2 × 105 cells/well and rested overnight before experimentation. For each comparison between constructs, equivalent transfectional efficiency was confirmed by co-transfecting the Renilla luciferase vector, pRL-TK (Promega), with each in parallel experiments. Transfected cell cultures were then stimulated in triplicate with 1 μg·ml−1 lipopolysaccharide (Escherichia coli, serotype 026-B6; Sigma). Glucocorticoid-treated cultures were exposed to 1 μmdexamethasone (Dex; Sigma) from 30 min before LPS addition. Similar triplicate cultures without LPS or Dex served as controls. Firefly luciferase expression was measured at times up to 24 h after LPS exposure, using the Promega Luciferase Assay System. WhenRenilla luciferase expression was also to be measured, the Promega Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System was used. THP-1 cells were exposed to LPS, with or without Dex, as above for up to 6 h. Unexposed cells served as controls. Nuclear extracts were prepared from 2.5 × 107 cells using the method of Li et al. (37.Joyce D. Bouzahzah B. Fu M. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Steer J. Klein J.U.

For EMSA, nuclear proteins (4 μg) were preincubated for 10 min at room temperature with 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a binding buffer (4% Ficoll, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, 0.05% IGEPALCA-630) to give a final reaction volume of 10 μl. Appropriate specific antibodies (1 μg; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were included in the mixture for supershift EMSA. The oligonucleotide probe, which had been labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I (Promega) was then added. Probes derived from sequences of the TNF-α promoter are shown in Fig. 1. Consensus binding sequences for CRE, AP-1, NF-κB, Ets/PEA3, and C/EBP were derived from somatostatin promoter (39.Montminy M.R. Sevarino K.A. Wagner J.A. Mandel G. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The PU.1 consensus probe was designed to incorporate optimal binding sequences for this protein (43.Kominato Y. Galson D.L. Waterman W.R. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 58-68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Boldface lettering indicates the core sequences. When present, unlabeled oligonucleotide probes were at 100-fold molar excess, unless otherwise indicated. Thirty minutes after the addition of probe, samples were loaded onto a 4% polyacrylamide gel, containing 0.25 × Tris-Borate-EDTA buffer, which had been pre-run for 2 h in the same buffer. They were then separated at 150 V for 90 min. Gels were then exposed to Cronex x-ray film, using a single intensifying screen. Films were not preflashed. Retarded bands were quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics ImageQuant densitometer in “wide line” integration mode with film background subtraction. TNF-α in supernatant was assayed by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, as described previously (44.Joyce D.A. Steer J.H. Kloda A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1996; 16: 513-519Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 45.Meager A. Parti S. Leung H. Peil E. Mahon B. Hybridoma. 1987; 6: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Suppression of luciferase activity and TNF-α by Dex is expressed as a percentage of the LPS-induced increment. Statistical analyses were made using two-way analysis of variance. In order to confirm that the reporter constructs responded comparably to the endogenous TNF-α gene, TNF-α release and luciferase activity were measured simultaneously in TNF-Luc-TNF-transfected cells during exposure to LPS and Dex. THP-1 cells were transfected, rested overnight, and exposed to LPS with or without Dex. In the absence of LPS stimulation, luciferase activity was initially low and increased only marginally between 12 and 24 h (Fig.2 a). Secreted TNF-α concentrations were also close to the limit of assay detection (32 pg·ml−1) throughout this time (Fig.2 b). Peak expression of luciferase and peak concentration of secreted TNF-α coincided at 3 h after LPS stimulation (Fig. 2,a and b). Dex suppressed both from 2 to 12 h. At 3 h, luciferase activity was suppressed 35% and TNF-α was suppressed 47% by Dex. Luciferase activity had returned almost to the level of unstimulated cells at 24 h, but the Dex-induced suppression of supernatant TNF-α activity remained. Dex did not influence either TNF-α secretion or luciferase activity in the absence of LPS stimulation (results not shown). TheTNF-Luc-TNF construct, transfected into THP-1 cells, therefore responds to LPS and Dex like the endogenous TNF-α gene. Neither LPS nor Dex affected cell numbers or viability in this or subsequent experiments. Previous work has shown that glucocorticoids suppress both TNF-α gene transcription and TNF-α mRNA translation in the murine RAW264.7 macrophage line (16.Swantek J.L. Cobb M.H. Geppert T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6274-6282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Han J. Thompson P. Beutler B. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Sequences in the 3′-UTR mediate the effect on translational efficiency (32.Han J. Beutler B. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1990; 1: 71-75PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore expressed reporters that incorporated the TNF-α promoter, the TNF-α 3′-UTR, or both in THP-1 cells and measured suppression of LPS-induced luciferase activity by Dex. Initially, SV40-Luc-TNF (which incorporates the 3′-UTR of the TNF-α gene) was compared withSV40-Luc-SV40 (which incorporates the SV40-derived 3′-UTR).SV40-Luc-SV40 does not respond to LPS or Dex in THP-1 cells (Fig. 3 a).SV40-Luc-TNF, which expresses at approximately one-tenth of the level of SV40-Luc-SV40, was induced by LPS (to a maximum of 1.56-fold at 6 h), but the response was unaffected by Dex (Fig.3 b). Because the murine TNF-α 3′-UTR confers Dex responsiveness in the murine RAW264.7 cell line, we performed the same experiments with RAW264.7 cells. In these cells, Dex suppressed LPS-stimulated activity of SV40-Luc-TNF by 39% at 6 h after exposure (Fig. 3 c). This confirms the relatively greater importance of the TNF-α 3′-UTR in Dex response of RAW264.7 cells. LPS itself was a more potent inducer in RAW264.7 cells, causing an 18-fold increase in SV40-Luc-TNF expression and a 3-fold increase in expression of the control vector,SV40-Luc-SV40. We then examined the role of the TNF-α promoter in glucocorticoid response of LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells, using theTNF-Luc-SV40 and TNF-Luc-TNF reporters. These included the TNF-α promoter in the place of the SV40 promoter. Dex suppressed activity from 4 h (TNF-Luc-SV40) or 2 h (TNF-Luc-TNF). Dex suppressed the peak LPS-induced luciferase activity by 31% in TNF-Luc-SV40-transfected cells and 38% in TNF-Luc-TNF-transfected cells (Fig. 3,d and e). In separate experiments, Dex consistently produced slightly greater suppression ofTNF-Luc-TNF than TNF-Luc-SV40 (52% maximum suppression compared with 41%, p = 0.003, data from eight independent experiments), implying that the TNF-α 3′-UTR also contributed to Dex response in these TNF-α promoter reporters, although it had no measurable effect in the SV40 promoter vectors in THP-1 cells (Fig. 3 b). Dex did not alter the activity in either construct in the absence of LPS stimulation (results not shown).TNF-Luc-TNF exhibited lower absolute expression thanTNF-Luc-SV40 but greater inducibility with LPS (Fig. 3,d and e), similar to the distinction that had been observed between SV40-Luc-SV40 andSV40-Luc-TNF (Fig. 3, a and b). From these experiments, we concluded that promoter sequences were essential for glucocorticoid suppression of TNF-α in LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells and that there was also a small effect mediated through sequences in the TNF-α 3′-UTR. We then timed the onset and duration of these promoter-mediated effects of LPS and Dex. THP-1 cells were transiently transfected withTNF-Luc-SV40 and exposed to LPS, with or without Dex, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Actinomycin D (AcD; 2 μg·ml−1) was added at 90 min, 2 or 3 h after LPS. In the absence of AcD, the effects of LPS and Dex on luciferase activity were apparent at 2 h and were maximal at 6 h (Fig. 4 a). Added at 90 min, AcD completely prevented both the LPS and Dex effects (Fig.4 b). Added at 3 h, it failed to prevent either (compare Fig. 4, a and d). Adding AcD at 2 h partially prevented the actions of both LPS and Dex (Fig.4 c). We concluded that LPS induced a burst of transcription from the TNF-α promoter-luciferase reporter construct between 90 min and 3 h after exposure and that Dex suppressed this. This is consistent with the timing of maximal effects of LPS and Dex on TNF-α protein secretion at 3 h (Fig. 2). Later experiments examined control of the TNF-α promoter before and during this brief phase of transcription. A series of functional transcription factor binding sites exists in the −177 to −59 bp region of the TNF-α promoter, with binding sequences for NF-κB factors, Ets, AP-1, CRE/ATF, NF-AT, C/EBP, Egr-1, and Sp.1 (Fig. 1). We went on to investigate whether glucocorticoids altered transcription factor binding at these sites in LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells and whether these sequences also mediated the suppression of TNF-α promoter activity by glucocorticoids. A putative NF-κB-binding site exists at −97 to −88 bp in the TNF-α promoter (Fig. 1). Nuclear extracts from LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells contained four protein complexes that retarded a NF-κB consensus probe. Supershift analysis identified NF-κB1/Rel-A complex, Rel-A/C-Rel complex, NF-κB1/NF-κB1 homodimer, and a further, slowly migrating Rel-A-containing complex (Fig.5 a). Only the slowly migrating complex was detected in unstimulated cells. Each of the Rel-A-containing complexes increased within 1 h of LPS stimulation and peaked at 2 or 4 h (Fig. 5 b). The NF-κB1 homodimer peaked later than the Rel-A complexes, at 4–6 h. Rel-A/C-Rel had largely disappeared by 6 h, while the other complexes remained readily detectable. Nuclei of Dex-treated cells contained less binding activity for each of the complexes from 1 to 4 h after LPS stimulation. (Fig. 5 b). Dex therefore suppressed the nuclear abundance of NF-κB-containing complexes before and during the critical period for TNF-α promoter-driven transcription, between 90 min and 3 h after LPS exposure (Fig.4). An oligonucleotide probe corresponding to bases −100 to −84 of the TNF-α promoter, which includes the putative NF-κB-binding site (Fig. 1), also bound NF-κB1/Rel-A, Rel-A/C-Rel, NF-κB1 homodimer, and the slower migrating, Rel-A-containing complex (Fig. 5 c).

https://openalex.org/W2046807462,"Neuronal pentraxin 1 (NP1), neuronal pentraxin 2 (NP2), and neuronal pentraxin receptor (NPR) are members of a new family of proteins identified through interaction with a presynaptic snake venom toxin taipoxin. We have proposed that these three neuronal pentraxins represent a novel neuronal uptake pathway that may function during synapse formation and remodeling. We have investigated the mutual interactions of these proteins by characterizing their enrichment on taipoxin affinity columns; by expressing NP1, NP2, and NPR singly and together in Chinese hamster ovary cells; and by generating mice that fail to express NP1. NP1 and NP2 are secreted, exist as higher order multimers (probably pentamers), and interact with taipoxin and taipoxin-associated calcium-binding protein 49 (TCBP49). NPR is expressed on the cell membrane and does not bind taipoxin or TCBP49 by itself, but it can form heteropentamers with NP1 and NP2 that can be released from cell membranes. This is the first demonstration of heteromultimerization of pentraxins and release of a pentraxin complex by proteolysis. These processes are likely to directly effect the localization and function of neuronal pentraxins in neuronal uptake or synapse formation and remodeling.

The action of this toxin in blocking synaptic transmission and synaptic vesicle recycling led us to study the interactions between these taipoxin-binding proteins, their role in the action of taipoxin at synapses, and their potential role in general neuronal uptake. NP1, NP2, NPR, and TCBP49 were isolated by affinity chromatography of solubilized brain membranes on columns of immobilized taipoxin. NP1, NP2, and NPR define a family of neuronal pentraxins that are 50% identical to each other (3.Dodds D.C. Omeis I.A. Cushman S.J. Helms J.A. Perin M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21488-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The N-terminal half of neuronal pentraxins are 20–30% identical to previously identified pentraxins, such as serum amyloid P protein and C-reactive protein, which are elevated in the serum during acute phase response (5.Whitehead A.S. Zahedi K. Rits M. Mortensen R.F. Lelias J.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 266: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 6.Dowton S.B. McGrew S.D. Biochem.

Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2463-2478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Classical pentraxins form pentamers and decamers that show calcium-dependent binding to a variety of ligands, such as bacteria, toxins, chromatin, and carbohydrates (10.Gewurz H. Zhang X.-H. Lint T.F. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). C-reactive protein is thought to help mediate clearance of extracellular debris during infection and inflammation (11.Steel D.M. Whitehead A.S. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 81-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). We have proposed that the neuronal pentraxins function in a similar manner facilitating the uptake of synaptic material during synapse remodeling. An additional or alternative hypothesis, recently proposed by O'Brien et al.(12.O'Brien R.J. Xu D. Petralia R.S. Steward O. Huganir R.L. Worley P. Neuron. 1999; 23: 309-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), is that NP2 mediates the synaptic clustering of AMPA glutamate receptors at a subset of excitatory synapses. Based on cDNA sequence, NP1 and NP2 are predicted to be secreted proteins (1.Schlimgen A.K. Helms J.A. Vogel H. Perin M.S. Neuron. 1995; 14: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 2.Hsu Y.-C. Perin M.S. Genomics. 1995; 28: 220-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), whereas NPR contains a putative membrane-spanning hydrophobic domain (3.Dodds D.C. Omeis I.A. Cushman S.J. Helms J.A. Perin M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21488-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that it is present on the neuronal cell surface. The three neuronal pentraxins are significantly larger than the classical pentraxins (>50versus 30 kDa), suggesting that they may have additional novel functions. In contrast, the other taipoxin-binding protein, TCBP49, is a lumenal calcium-binding protein that is ubiquitously expressed and binds calcium through six EF-hand domains and contains the retention sequence His-Asp-Glu-Leu at its C-terminal (4.Dodds D. Schlimgen A.K. Lu S.-Y. Perin M.S. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2339-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence microscopy shows TCBP49 to be localized to an internal reticular compartment in neurons and glia. NP1, NP2, and NPR can all be isolated on taipoxin columns, NP1 and NP2 columns, and TCBP49 columns, suggesting that they interact in vivo (3.Dodds D.C. Omeis I.A. Cushman S.J. Helms J.A. Perin M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21488-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These interactions are likely to mediate aspects of taipoxin toxicity in neurons and are indicative of a normal neuronal pathway that may be involved in the uptake of extracellular material. To further understand the interactions of these proteins, we have examined native NP1, NP2, and NPR in primary hippocampal neurons and have also expressed these proteins individually and together in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The experiments reported here examine the secretion, surface localization, multimerization, and binding characteristics of the neuronal pentraxins. In addition, we have generated mice that lack NP1 in order to confirm these interactions in vivo. Restriction and DNA modification enzymes were from New England Biolabs and Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Protein molecular weight standards were from Bio-Rad, and DNA standards were from Life Technologies, Inc. Tissue culture media and additives were from Life Technologies, Inc. Peroxidase-conjugated and rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Cappel. Unless noted otherwise, all other chemicals were reagent grade and used without further purification. The polyclonal antibodies used were as follows: NP1-2, raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 42–57 of rat NP1 (1.Schlimgen A.K. Helms J.A. Vogel H. Perin M.S.

In some experiments, the appropriate preimmune serum was used as a negative control. 12% SDS-PAGE gels were used for all experiments. After separation, the gels were either stained with Coomassie or used for Western blots. Gels to be blotted were transferred 1–2 h at 250 mA in standard Tris/glycine buffer and then blocked 1–2 h at room temperature in blocking buffer (6% casein, 1% polyvinyl pyrolidone 40, 10 mm EDTA in PBS, pH 7.4). Primary and secondary antibodies were generally incubated for 1–12 h in blocking buffer. Washes were done in PBST (0.3% Tween-20 in PBS). Peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were detected by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A 1600-bp fragment of the rat NP1 cDNA, including the entire coding sequence and 250 bp of the 3′ UTR, was subcloned into the BamHI andSphI sites of pcDNAI/Amp (Invitrogen). A 1650-bp piece of human NP2 cDNA, including the entire coding sequence and 260 bp of the 3′ UTR, was first subcloned into the XhoI andEcoRV sites of pBluescript (Stratagene) and then subcloned into the XhoI and XbaI sites of pcDNAI/Amp. Two different NPR constructs were generated. A 1710-bp piece of the rat NPR cDNA containing only 15 bp of the 5′ UTR, the entire coding sequence, and 200 bp of the 3′ UTR was subcloned into theBamHI and EcoRI sites of pcDNAI/Amp. This piece was also subcloned into the BamHI andEcoRV sites of pZeoSV2(+) (Invitrogen). Also, an 1850-bp piece containing the entire 150 bp of the 5′ UTR, the coding sequence, and 200 bp of the 3′ UTR was subcloned into the BamHI andEcoRI sites of pZeoSV2. pSVneo plasmid was from Dr. Thomas Sudhof (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). All DNAs were purified by Qiagen Midi-Prep columns before use. CHO cells were a generous gift of Dr. Mike Roth (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). They were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 40 μg/ml proline. For generating the initial NP1, NP2, and NPR cell lines, cells were co-transfected with the pentraxin cDNAs and, when necessary, the pSVneo DNA at a 5:1 ratio using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Typically, 6 mg of pentraxin DNA and 16 ml of LipofectAMINE were used per 100-mm dish of cells. Stable cell lines were isolated through two rounds of cloning in selection media containing 500 μg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.) or 500 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen) and then maintained in media containing 200 μg/ml Geneticin or Zeocin. All screening for expressing clones was done by Western blotting. To generate the cell lines expressing NPR with NP1 or NP2, NPR cDNAs in pZeoSV2 were transfected into NP1 or NP2 cells, and double selection was used to identify stable clones. Primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons were a generous gift of Andrew Bellun (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). They were prepared from embryonic rats at day E19-E20, plated on poly-d-lysine, and maintained according to standard protocols in Neurobasal/B27 medium. Cultures were allowed to differentiate for at least 3–4 weeks before use in experiments. Culture medium was collected for analysis 4 days after the last feeding. Cells were plated on collagen-coated coverslips and allowed to attach overnight. Antibodies were added directly to the tissue culture medium and allowed to bind for 2 h at 4 °C. The cells were then washed with PBS and fixed with formaldehyde, and surface-bound antibodies were visualized with rhodamine-labeled goat-anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Taipoxin and recombinant TCBP49 affinity columns were generated and used as described (3.Dodds D.C. Omeis I.A. Cushman S.J. Helms J.A. Perin M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21488-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The columns were equilibrated in 20–25 column volumes of buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2 and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. In experiments using cell lysates, the column equilibration buffer also contained 0.2% TX-100. CHO or hippocampal neuron culture medium was harvested, centrifuged to remove any floating cells, and applied directly to the column. CHO and hippocampal neuron cell lysates were prepared by mixing cells in lysis buffer (1% TX-100, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, plus protease inhibitors). The cell lysates were centrifuged to remove any insoluble material and adjusted to 2 mmCaCl2before being applied to the columns. The columns were washed with 10–15 column volumes of equilibration buffer and then eluted sequentially with 3 column volumes of the same buffer containing 200 mm, 400 mm, 600 mm, 800 mm, and 1 m NaCl. The final elution was with 5 column volumes of the same buffer containing 1 m NaCl and 10 mm EDTA. In most experiments, the eluates were concentrated in Centricon-30 concentrators (Amicon). Equal aliquots of each eluate were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Coomassie staining and Western blotting. The mouse gene encoding NP1 was identified (13.Omeis I. Hsu Y.-C. Perin M.S. Genomics. 1996; 36: 543-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and used to generate a knockout construct that replaced the first exon encoding the signal peptide with a PGK-hprt cassette (see Fig. 6 A). This construct was electroporated into 129/SvEv-derived ES cells (AB2.1), and HAT- and FIAU-resistant clones were isolated and screened for the expected restriction fragment length changes by genomic Southern blot as described (14.Matzuk M.M. Finegold M.J. Su J.-G.J. Hsueh A.J.W. Bradley A. Nature. 1992; 360: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Correctly targeted clones were injected into blastocysts and implanted in pseudopregnant females. Chimeric mice were bred to obtain mice heterozygous for the modified NP1 gene, and heterozygous mice were bred to generate mice homozygous for the mutation. NP1, NP2, and NPR containing samples, isolated from culture media or cell lysates by taipoxin or rTCBP49 affinity chromatography, were analyzed by sucrose gradient centrifugation (15.Perin M.S. Brose N. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 623-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For these experiments, EDTA eluates containing NP1, NP2, or NPR were collected in 1-ml fractions and not concentrated. The fraction with the highest protein concentration was identified by Western blotting and used for sucrose gradient analysis. Alternatively, whole cell lysates, prepared as described above, were loaded directly onto sucrose gradients. 5–20% sucrose gradients were poured into buffer (20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.2% TX-100), 1 ml of sample was loaded, and the gradients were centrifuged at 40,000 × g in SW41 rotor for 14 h at 4 °C. 500-μl fractions were collected from the top by pushing the gradient from the bottom with 40% sucrose. Equal aliquots of each fraction were analyzed by Western blotting. Bio-Rad gel filtration standards were run in a separate gradient as size controls. NP1, NP2, and NPR are all expressed in the hippocampus, as revealed by in situ hybridization (1.Schlimgen A.K. Helms J.A. Vogel H. Perin M.S. Neuron. 1995; 14: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 3.Dodds D.C. Omeis I.A. Cushman S.J. Helms J.A. Perin M.S. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2463-2478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons are sensitive to taipoxin, as evidenced by the swelling of presynaptic terminals and the cell surface exposure of synaptic vesicle proteins (1.Schlimgen A.K. Helms J.A. Vogel H. Perin M.S. Neuron. 1995; 14: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To confirm the presence of NP1, NP2, and NPR proteins in hippocampal neurons, detergent lysates of cultured hippocampal neurons were chromatographed on a taipoxin column to isolate neuronal pentraxins. As in original purifications from solubilized rat brain membranes (1.Schlimgen A.K. Helms J.A. Vogel H. Perin M.S. Neuron. 1995; 14: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 3.Dodds D.C. Omeis I.A. Cushman S.J. Helms J.A. Perin M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21488-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), the column was loaded and washed in the presence of 2 mm calcium and eluted with 10 mm EDTA. All three of the pentraxins can be purified from detergent-solubilized hippocampal neurons by taipoxin chromatography (Fig. 1 A). NP1 and NP2, purified off taipoxin columns, run as single bands on SDS-PAGE. NPR, in contrast, runs as two separate bands of apparent molecular masses of 55 and 65 kDa. The 65-kDa form of NPR is initiated with a hydrophobic sequence of sufficient length to be a transmembrane domain (3.Dodds D.C. Omeis I.A. Cushman S.J. Helms J.A. Perin M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21488-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To test whether the neuronal pentraxins are secreted or released from neurons, conditioned medium was collected from hippocampal cultures 4 days after feeding and chromatographed on the taipoxin column. NP1 and NP2 are purified from media by taipoxin chromatography and run as single bands on SDS-PAGE gels. Secretion of NP1 and NP2 would be expected as they have apparent N-terminal signal peptide sequences of 9–16 amino acids (1.Schlimgen A.K. Helms J.A. Vogel H. Perin M.S. Neuron. 1995; 14: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 2.Hsu Y.-C. Perin M.S. Genomics. 1995; 28: 220-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). NPR also can be purified from neuronal media, but only the 55-kDa band was isolated (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that NPR is proteolytically released from the cell surface or that a distinct 55-kDa form of NPR is secreted. To examine the properties of NP1, NP2 and NPR individually, we generated stable CHO cell lines that express each of these proteins. NP1 and NPR both have relatively long 3′ UTRs, over 3 kilobases in length (1.Schlimgen A.K. Helms J.A. Vogel H. Perin M.S. Neuron. 1995; 14: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 3.Dodds D.C. Omeis I.A. Cushman S.J. Helms J.A. Perin M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21488-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Initial attempts to express NP1 using the full-length cDNA were unsuccessful. 2M. S. Perin, unpublished data. We therefore used smaller expression constructs, consisting of only the coding sequences and minimal amounts of the 5′ and 3′ UTRs. Two different NPR constructs were generated, differing only in the length of the 5′ UTR included. The full-length rat NPR cDNA contains only 150 bp of the 5′ UTR. It does not contain an in-frame stop codon before the initiator CTG, and it is extremely G/C-rich (3.Dodds D.C. Omeis I.A. Cushman S.J. Helms J.A. Perin M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21488-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Because it has been suggested that such a sequence may form secondary structure necessary for initiation at cryptic upstream CTG sites (16.Kozak M. Gene. 1999; 234: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar), we made one NPR construct with the entire 5′ UTR and another containing only 15 bp of the 5′ UTR. These were designated “long” and “short” NPR, respectively. The short NPR construct was made in pcDNAI/Amp and in pZeoSV2. The long NPR construct was made only in pZeoSV2. NP1 and NP2 constructs were made in pcDNA1/Amp. The use of two selectable markers allowed us to isolate stable cell lines co-expressing NP1 and NPR and lines co-expressing NP2 and NPR. The expression of NP1, NP2, and NPR by these cell lines is shown in Fig.2. NP1 and NP2 are expressed as proteins that run as single bands on SDS-PAGE gels. NPR expressed by these cells run as multiple bands on SDS-PAGE gels. Both the short and long NPR constructs produce the same bands, although the long NPR construct produces more of the highest molecular weight band. We tested whether NP1, NP2 and NPR expressed individually in CHO cell lines could bind to taipoxin as assayed by affinity chromatography of CHO cell lysates and conditioned culture media on taipoxin columns. Cell lysates were adjusted to 2 mm free calcium before loading, and the column was washed in the presence of calcium. The calcium concentration of the tissue culture media was not adjusted. Results are shown in Fig. 3 A. NP1 from both cell lysates and culture media binds to taipoxin columns, remains bound in the presence of 1 m NaCl, and is only eluted with EDTA, suggesting that the binding is dependent on divalent cations. NP1 does not bind to taipoxin when the chromatography is done in the presence of magnesium instead of calcium (data not shown), suggesting that the binding of NP1 to taipoxin is indeed calcium-dependent. Like NP1, NP2 in both cell lysates and conditioned culture media binds to taipoxin columns and only elutes with EDTA. These results demonstrate that NP1 and NP2 can bind taipoxin independently of each other and independently of NPR. In contrast, NPR, from NPR CHO cell lysates, fails to bind to taipoxin columns. Interestingly, we could not detect or immunoprecipitate NPR in conditioned medium from these cells (data not shown). NPR fails to bind to taipoxin columns when made from either the short or long NPR construct, suggesting that the purification of NPR from whole rat brain on taipoxin columns occurs as a result of its binding to another protein on the column, perhaps NP1 or NP2. We tested this by loading the taipoxin column with NP1 and then running NPR cell lysate over the column. Only the prebound NP1 was eluted from the column after washing (data not shown). We also tried mixing equal amounts of solubilized NP1 cells with solubilized NPR cells and then running the mixed cell lysate over the taipoxin column (Fig. 3 B). Again, only NP1 bound to the column. Finally, we co-expressed NP1 and NPR in a single cell line and tested the cell lysate and media from these cells on the taipoxin column (Fig. 3, C and D). Interestingly, NPR from both the cell lysate and the media was found bound to the taipoxin column with the NP1. Again, binding is calcium-dependent, as NP1 and NPR are only eluted with EDTA. This result indicates that the interaction between NP1 and NPR is quite strong, as it withstands 1m NaCl. NPR from cell lysates and media can also bind the taipoxin column when co-expressed with NP2 (Fig. 3 E). Again, both NP2 and NPR remain bound in 1 m NaCl and are released by EDTA. This suggests that NP1 and NP2 are similar in forming complexes with NPR. Given that the formation of NP1·NPR and NP2·NPR complexes requires co-expression, it is likely that these complexes are formed shortly after translation during their passage through the secretory pathway. We have previously shown NP1, NP2, and NPR can also be enriched by chromatography on columns of recombinant TCBP49, a fourth taipoxin-binding protein with six EF-hand calcium binding domains that is present in lumenal reticular compartments (4.Dodds D. Schlimgen A.K. Lu S.-Y. Perin M.S. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2339-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We tested whether neuronal pentraxins expressed in our CHO cell lines could bind TCBP49. TCBP49 (rTCBP49) was expressed in bacteria (4.Dodds D. Schlimgen A.K. Lu S.-Y. Perin M.S. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2339-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), purified, and coupled to activated CH-Sepharose. NP1, NP2, and NPR cell lysates or conditioned medium were chromatographed over rTCBP49 columns using the same buffers and procedures used for chromatography on taipoxin columns (Fig. 4). NP1 from cell lysates or conditioned media bound to rTCBP49 columns and required EDTA for elution. Similarly, NP2 from cell lysates or conditioned media bound tightly to rTCBP49 columns. In contrast, NPR from cell lysates did not bind to rTCBP49 columns. When cell lysates or conditioned media from cells expressing both NP1 and NPR or cells expressing both NP2 and NPR were used, NPR bound rTCBP49 columns and was eluted in the final EDTA elution. The column chromatography data imply that NP1 and NPR must form a complex within the cell in order for NPR to be purified on either taipoxin or rTCBP49 columns. Because the classical pentraxins form pentamers and decamers in vivo (10.Gewurz H. Zhang X.-H. Lint T.F. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), we tested whether NP1, NP2, and/or NPR exist as pentamers, or higher order multimers, in our CHO cell lines. Whole cell lysates or EDTA eluates from taipoxin or rTCBP49 columns were analyzed using sucrose gradient sedimentation (Fig. 5). First, NP1 from conditioned media was purified by taipoxin chromatography, and the EDTA eluate was loaded directly on sucrose gradients and centrifuged. Comparison of the position of NP1 in these gradients to molecular size standards demonstrates that NP1 exists as higher order multimers; the peak of these gradients corresponds to an approximate size of 250 kDa or to the size of a pentamer (Fig. 5 A). No NP1 was detectable at positions corresponding to a monomer. NP2 also sedimented into fractions corresponding to a pentamer. The samples used for these NP1 and NP2 gradients were EDTA eluates, indicating that the multimeric complexes are stable in EDTA and do not depend on calcium for their formation. This also indicates that EDTA does not cause the elution of NP1 or NP2 from the taipoxin column merely by breaking up a pentameric NP1 or NP2 complex. When detergent lysates of NP1-expressing cells were run on the same gradients, NP1 again ran as a pentameric-sized complex (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, when NPR-expressing cells were run on these sucrose gradients, almost all of the NPR was present in fractions consistent with monomers or dimers (Fig. 5 B). The existence of NPR as a monomer or dimer is unique for any of the pentraxins analyzed to date. Given our previous results suggesting that NP1 and NP2 form complexes with NPR, we analyzed whether NP1, NP2, and NPR form large multimeric complexes in cells co-expressing either NP1 and NPR or NP2 and NPR. Cells were lysed with detergent and chromatographed on taipoxin columns. Taipoxin column EDTA eluates were run on sucrose gradients. As shown in Fig. 5, C andD, when co-expressed with NP1 or NP2 (data not shown), NPR ran on sucrose gradients as a large multimeric complex at least the size of a pentamer. This indicates that co-expression of NP1 or NP2 with NPR enables the NPR to be assembled into large complexes and that only such multimeric complexes are capable of binding to taipoxin or rTCBP49. The existence of multimeric complexes of NP1, NP2, and NPR can also be shown using nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and size-exclusion chromatography (data not shown). When taipoxin column eluates or lysates of NP1/NPR or NP2/NPR co-expressing cells are run on nondenaturing gels, NP1, NP2, and NPR all run near the top of 6% gels at positions indicative of large multimeric complexes. When the same eluates or lysates from co-expressing cells are run on Superose 6 size exclusion columns, NP1, NP2, and NPR all elute at positions indicative of a large complex that is larger than a 158-kDa gel filtration standard. To investigate these interactions in vivo, we generated mice that lack NP1. Fig. 6 A shows the targeting construct used to knock-out NP1 by homologous recombination in ES cells. The first exon, including the translation start site and the signal peptide, was targeted for removal. Southern blot analysis of heterozygous and homozygous mice demonstrated the expected mutant allele structure after recombination (Fig.6 B). Heterozygous crosses displayed the expected Mendelian numbers of wild type, heterozygous, and null mice (28 wild type homozygous, 67 heterozygous, and 30 homozygous recombinant). Mice homozygous for the mutated gene are viable and fertile and show no obvious alteration in cerebral, cerebellar, or hippocampal ultrastructure (data not shown) or obvious changes of"

The lumenal domain of triadin contains multiple repeats of alternating lysine and glutamic acid residues, which have been defined as KEKE motifs and have been proposed to promote protein associations. Here we identified the specific residues of triadin responsible for binding to calsequestrin by mutational analysis of triadin 1, the major cardiac isoform. A series of deletional fusion proteins of triadin 1 was generated, and by using metabolically labeled calsequestrin in filter-overlay assays, the calsequestrin-binding domain of triadin 1 was localized to a single KEKE motif comprised of 25 amino acids. Alanine mutagenesis within this motif demonstrated that the critical amino acids of triadin binding to calsequestrin are the even-numbered residues Lys210, Lys212, Glu214, Lys216, Gly218, Gln220, Lys222, and Lys224. Replacement of the odd-numbered residues within this motif by alanine had no effect on calsequestrin binding to triadin. The results suggest a model in which residues 210–224 of triadin form a β-strand, with the even-numbered residues in the strand interacting with charged residues of calsequestrin, stabilizing a “polar zipper” that links the two proteins together. This small, highly charged β-strand of triadin may tether calsequestrin to the junctional face membrane, allowing calsequestrin to sequester Ca2+ in the vicinity of the ryanodine receptor during Ca2+ uptake and Ca2+ release.

Physiol. 1994; 56: 509-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Calsequestrin sequesters large amounts of Ca2+ in the vicinity of the RyR/Ca2+ release channel, where the protein acts as a storage depot for the Ca2+ that is released during muscle contraction (3.Jones L.R.

In both cardiac and skeletal muscle, RyRs are visualized by electron microscopy as “feet” lined up on the cytoplasmic face of the junctional SR membrane; calsequestrin appears as an electron-dense matrix in the SR lumen, closely opposed to the RyRs from the lumenal side of the membrane (1.Fleischer S.

Electron microscopy and deep-etch studies also reveal the presence of thin strands or “anchoring filaments” in the junctional SR lumen, which appear to form a reticulated network that connects the electron-dense matrix (calsequestrin) to the Ca2+ release channels (4.Franzini-Armstrong C.

Triadin and junctin are homologous proteins, each projecting a highly charged, carboxyl terminus into the junctional SR lumen (6.Jones L.R. Zhang L. Sanborn K. Jorgensen A.O. Kelley J. J. Biol.

A quaternary complex between calsequestrin, triadin, junctin, and the RyR, stabilized from the inner surface of the junctional SR membrane, was proposed (10.Zhang L. Kelley J. Schmeisser G. Kobayashi Y.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23389-23397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), which could serve both to concentrate Ca2+ at the inner face of the junctional SR membrane as well as to provide a molecular conduit for the rapid flow of Ca2+ ions from calsequestrin to the RyR during activation of Ca2+ release in cardiac and skeletal muscle.Triadin was first identified and purified from rabbit skeletal muscle SR as an integral membrane protein localized to skeletal muscle triads (5.Caswell A.H. Brandt N.R. Brunschwig J.P. Purkerson S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7507-7513Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 12.Knudson C.M. Stang K.K. Jorgensen A.O. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12637-12645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several triadin isoforms have since been found in cardiac and skeletal muscle, all of which appear to arise from alternative splicing of the same triadin gene (7.Guo W. Jorgensen A.O. Jones L.R. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 458-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 8.Knudson C.M. Stang K.K. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C.A. Campbell K.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 28660-28668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In cardiac junctional SR, the predominant isoform of triadin expressed is triadin 1, the smallest of the known triadins (11.Kobayashi Y.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28660-28668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Triadin 1 accounts for more than 95% of the total triadin in mammalian myocardium (11.Kobayashi Y.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28660-28668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The protein is partially glycosylated at asparagine residue 75 in heart, accounting for its appearance as a doublet of 35- and 40-kDa molecular mass proteins on SDS-PAGE (11.Kobayashi Y.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28660-28668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).All triadin isoforms in a given species have virtually identical amino acid sequences over the first 250–260 residues (7.Guo W. Jorgensen A.O. Jones L.R. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 458-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 8.Knudson C.M. Stang K.K. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C.A.

This common region encompasses the short amino-terminal cytoplasmic domains, the membrane-spanning segments, and the highly charged lumenal domains (residues 69–257 for canine triadin). The charged lumenal domains are basic and are responsible for binding to calsequestrin and to the RyR (7.Guo W. Jorgensen A.O. Jones L.R. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 458-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 9.Guo W. Campbell K.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 23389-23397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Dispersed throughout these common lumenal domains are multiple clusters of charged amino acids, of alternating positive and negative charge, that are particularly enriched in lysine and glutamic acid residues. These mixed charged clusters have been referred to as “KEKE motifs” (13.Realini C. Rogers S.W. Rechsteiner M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and have been proposed to facilitate protein-protein associations by acting as polar zippers (14.Realini C. Rechsteiner M. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 23389-23397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) first localized the calsequestrin-binding domain of triadin to the common lumenal region (residues 69–264 for the rabbit triadins), where short runs of alternating lysine and glutamic acid residues motifs are present in very high content. The lumenal region of junctin also contains a high density of KEKE motifs and also binds calsequestrin avidly (6.Jones L.R. Zhang L. Sanborn K. Jorgensen A.O. Kelley J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30787-30796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 10.Zhang L. Kelley J. Schmeisser G. Kobayashi Y.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23389-23397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Thus, it was proposed that KEKE motifs may be responsible for triadin (and junctin) binding to calsequestrin (10.Zhang L. Kelley J. Schmeisser G. Kobayashi Y.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23389-23397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). This idea is reinforced by the fact that calsequestrin is a highly charged, acidic protein (17.Scott B.T. Simmerman H.K.B. Collins J.H. Nadal-Ginard B. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8958-8964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that KEKE association motifs of triadin (and junctin) could bind to KEKE-binding sites (13.Realini C. Rogers S.W. Rechsteiner M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) of calsequestrin. To date, however, the region of triadin (or junctin) binding to calsequestrin has not been definitively localized, and the role of the KEKE motifs, if any, in the relatively specific interaction between these proteins has not been investigated.Here we have utilized deletional and site-specific mutagenesis of triadin 1 in combination with the radiolabeled calsequestrin overlay technique (6.Jones L.R. Zhang L. Sanborn K. Jorgensen A.O. Kelley J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30787-30796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 18.Mitchell R.D. Simmerman H.K.B. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1376-1381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to localize the calsequestrin-binding domain of cardiac triadin. Our results demonstrate that a charged cluster of KEKE residues is indeed required for triadin binding to calsequestrin but that only one of several KEKE motifs of triadin is essential for binding to occur. Alanine mutagenesis suggests that the charged residues of triadin interacting with calsequestrin form a β-strand, in which only one face of the putative β-strand contributes amino acid side chains that bind to calsequestrin.DISCUSSIONIn this study we have used deletional and site-specific mutagenesis to localize the calsequestrin-binding domain of triadin 1. Only a single binding site was found, located at residues 210–224 of triadin. Here, replacement of Lys210, Lys212, Glu214, and Lys216 by alanine or replacement of Gly218, Gln220, Lys222, and Lys224 by alanine abolished the ability of triadin to bind calsequestrin. The results are consistent with a model in which residues 210–224 of triadin form a β-strand. The even-numbered, mostly charged residues above may line up along one side of the β-strand to interact directly with charged residues of calsequestrin (17.Scott B.T. Simmerman H.K.B. Collins J.H. Nadal-Ginard B. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8958-8964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), forming a “polar zipper” (15.Perutz M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1629-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) that links the two proteins together. Remarkably, replacement of charged residues on the opposite side of the proposed β-strand by alanine did not affect calsequestrin binding to triadin at all, demonstrating that only one face of the strand contributes amino acid side chains that are essential for binding to calsequestrin. Notably, all of the even-numbered, charged residues above are completely conserved across several mammalian species (Fig. 8), suggesting that they comprise a critical interaction site for calsequestrin binding to all triadins.KEKE motifs have been defined as short runs of amino acid sequence greater than 12 residues in length, which contain at least 60% alternating lysine and glutamic/aspartic acid residues, lack five positively or negatively charged residues in a row, and are devoid of tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine, and proline (13.Realini C. Rogers S.W. Rechsteiner M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Such KEKE motifs have been implicated in a variety of different types of protein associations (13.Realini C. Rogers S.W. Rechsteiner M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 14.Realini C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29664-29667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 15.Perutz M.

Gene (Amst.). 2000; 243: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Since triadin (and junctin) are replete with KEKE motifs throughout their lumenal domains (Fig. 4), we strongly suspected in initiating these studies that several charged sites of triadin, conforming to KEKE motifs, would be required for tight binding to calsequestrin. We were very surprised to find, however, that out of the numerous charged residues located in the lumenal domain of triadin, only six (Lys210, Lys212, Glu214, Lys216, Lys222, and Lys224) were critical for binding to calsequestrin. This demonstrates that the triadin-calsequestrin binding interaction is very specific and is not simply the result of nonspecific electrostatic interactions between two oppositely charged, highly polar protein molecules (6.Jones L.R. Zhang L. Sanborn K. Jorgensen A.O. Kelley J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30787-30796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 17.Scott B.T. Simmerman H.K.B. Collins J.H. Nadal-Ginard B. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8958-8964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Residues 200–224 of triadin satisfy all of the criteria for a KEKE motif (13.Realini C. Rogers S.W. Rechsteiner M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Although it has been suggested the KEKE motifs are predominantly α-helical (13.Realini C. Rogers S.W. Rechsteiner M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 16.West Jr., R.W. Kruger B. Thomas S. Ma J. Milgrom E. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 243: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), our results clearly suggest that the calsequestrin-binding region of triadin is a β-strand.The ΔCBD/triadin 1 mutant, which is full-length recombinant triadin 1 with residues 200–224 deleted, failed to bind to calsequestrin in the overlay assay (Fig. 9). Moreover, several small fusion peptides, which shared only residues 200–224 of triadin 1, bound calsequestrin as well as full-length triadin 1 (Figs. 6 and 7). This demonstrates that only a few key amino acids, located between residues 200 and 224 of triadin, are necessary and sufficient for binding to calsequestrin. The specific loss of calsequestrin binding to this region, when charged residues along one side of the putative β-strand were changed to alanine, suggests that the charged side chains of these residues form hydrogen bonds with charged side chains of calsequestrin, stabilizing a β-sheet, which may zip the two proteins together (15.Perutz M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1629-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that the results of Fig. 10 call into question the requirement for a rigorously defined KEKE motif, at least as originally proposed (13.Realini C. Rogers S.W. Rechsteiner M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), as necessary for triadin binding to calsequestrin. For example, fusion peptides 6 and 7, which had charged residues on the opposite side of the putative β-strand changed to alanine, bound calsequestrin as well as intact triadin 1. However, these two fusion peptides no longer contained a KEKE motif between residues 200 and 224, because they retained only 56% charged residues here. Similarly, fusion peptide 2 in Fig. 10, which had four closely spaced KEKE-charged residues replaced by alanine (residues 202, 204, 206, and 208), actually bound 35S-calsequestrin more strongly than did full-length triadin 1. Only fusion peptides 4 and 5, which had blocks of even-numbered charged residues removed between residues 210 and 224, failed to bind 35S-calsequestrin. Although the atomic structure of triadin 1 is not known, the results of Fig. 10 strongly suggest that the calsequestrin-binding domain of triadin is a β-strand.Junctin is another calsequestrin-binding protein that is homologous to triadin and has similar KEKE association motifs scattered throughout its lumenal domain (6.Jones L.R. Zhang L. Sanborn K. Jorgensen A.O. Kelley J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30787-30796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 10.Zhang L. Kelley J. Schmeisser G. Kobayashi Y.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23389-23397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). However, when similar deletional mutagenesis-analysis was done with junctin, we observed that deletion of any one of several widely separated segments of its lumenal domain was sufficient to abolish calsequestrin binding (data not shown). It thus appears that junctin does not have a single discrete binding site for calsequestrin, which distinguishes it from triadin. The region of calsequestrin binding to triadin (and junctin) has not been identified. Cardiac calsequestrin does not have any consensus KEKE motifs but does have numerous small clusters of lysine and glutamic acid residues dispersed throughout its sequence (17.Scott B.T. Simmerman H.K.B. Collins J.H. Nadal-Ginard B. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8958-8964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the concept of triadin binding to calsequestrin, stabilized by a polar zipper (15.Perutz M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1629-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), seems a viable one. Recent crystallization of skeletal muscle calsequestrin showed that negatively charged sequences of calsequestrin are arranged into platforms of negative charges (28.Wang S. Trumble W.R. Liao H. Wesson C.R. Dunker A.K. Kang C.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Since amino acids 200–224 of triadin are sufficient for binding to calsequestrin, it should be feasible to co-crystallize a triadin synthetic peptide of these residues with purified recombinant calsequestrin, in order to determine the three-dimensional structure of the binding complex. These experiments are currently in progress.In other experiments we observed that the interaction between the calsequestrin-binding site of triadin and calsequestrin was enhanced at low Ca2+ concentration, 3Y. M. Kobayashi and L. R. Jones, unpublished observations. as has been reported previously for intact triadin (6.Jones L.R. Zhang L. Sanborn K. Jorgensen A.O. Kelley J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30787-30796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 10.Zhang L. Kelley J. Schmeisser G. Kobayashi Y.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1988; 263: 1376-1381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar Ca2+ concentrations may occur intralumenally in junctional SR following Ca2+ release (29.Shannon T.R. Ginsberg K.S. Bers D.M. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 333-343Google Scholar). One of the functions of triadin may be to anchor calsequestrin to the junctional membrane in proximity to the RyR, such that during muscle relaxation, when Ca2+ levels in the SR are beginning to rise, Ca2+ will be concentrated near the RyR where calsequestrin is tethered. When calsequestrin becomes saturated with Ca2+, its propensity to aggregate may help to keep it localized to the junctional SR lumenal space. Triadin 1 with the calsequestrin-binding domain deleted (ΔCBD/triadin 1) would make an interesting construct for overexpression in transgenic mouse hearts (11.Kobayashi Y.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28660-28668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) to test for a possible dominant-negative effect on excitation-contraction coupling. Conversely, triadin 1 with enhanced calsequestrin binding, as achieved by alanine mutagenesis of the proximal end of the calsequestrin-binding domain, would be an interesting construct to overexpress to test for a possible dominant-positive effect. It remains to be investigated whether these mutations of triadin alter its binding to the RyR (6.Jones L.R. Zhang L. Sanborn K. Jorgensen A.O. Kelley J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30787-30796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 7.Guo W. Jorgensen A.O. Jones L.R. Campbell K.P. J. Biol.

Calsequestrin is a high capacity Ca2+-binding protein located in the lumen of the junctional SR1 in cardiac and skeletal muscle (1.Fleischer S. Inui M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1989; 18: 333-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 2.Franzini-Armstrong C. Jorgensen A.O. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 509-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Calsequestrin sequesters large amounts of Ca2+ in the vicinity of the RyR/Ca2+ release channel, where the protein acts as a storage depot for the Ca2+ that is released during muscle contraction (3.Jones L.R. Suzuki Y.J. Wang W. Kobayashi Y.M. Ramesh V. Franzini-Armstrong C. Cleemann L. Morad M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1385-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In both cardiac and skeletal muscle, RyRs are visualized by electron microscopy as “feet” lined up on the cytoplasmic face of the junctional SR membrane; calsequestrin appears as an electron-dense matrix in the SR lumen, closely opposed to the RyRs from the lumenal side of the membrane (1.Fleischer S. Inui M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1989; 18: 333-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 2.Franzini-Armstrong C. Jorgensen A.O. Annu. Rev.

Invest. 1998; 101: 1385-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy and deep-etch studies also reveal the presence of thin strands or “anchoring filaments” in the junctional SR lumen, which appear to form a reticulated network that connects the electron-dense matrix (calsequestrin) to the Ca2+ release channels (4.Franzini-Armstrong C. Kenney L.J. Varriano-Marston E. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Recently, triadin (5.Caswell A.H. Brandt N.R. Brunschwig J.P. Purkerson S.

Triadin and junctin are homologous proteins, each projecting a highly charged, carboxyl terminus into the junctional SR lumen (6.Jones L.R. Zhang L. Sanborn K. Jorgensen A.O. Kelley J. J. Biol.

A quaternary complex between calsequestrin, triadin, junctin, and the RyR, stabilized from the inner surface of the junctional SR membrane, was proposed (10.Zhang L. Kelley J. Schmeisser G.

Retrograde transport of the nontoxic B subunit of verotoxin 1 was used to deliver pH-sensitive probes to the Golgi complex. To evaluate whether counter-ion permeability limited the activity of the electrogenic V-ATPase, we determined the concentration of K<sup>+</sup> in the lumen of the Golgi using a null point titration method. The [K<sup>+</sup>] inside the Golgi was found to be close to that of the cytosol, and increasing its permeability had no effect on pH<sub>G</sub>. Moreover, the capacity of the endogenous counter-ion permeability exceeded the rate of H<sup>+</sup> pumping, implying that the potential across the Golgi membrane is negligible and has little influence on pH<sub>G</sub>. The V-ATPase does not reach thermodynamic equilibrium nor does it seem to be allosterically inactivated at the steady state pH<sub>G</sub>. In fact, active H<sup>+</sup> pumping was detectable even below the resting pH<sub>G</sub>. A steady state pH was attained when the rate of pumping was matched by the passive backflux of H<sup>+</sup>(equivalents) or ""leak."" The nature of this leak pathway was investigated in detail. Neither vesicular traffic nor H<sup>+</sup>/cation antiporters or symporters were found to contribute to the net loss of H<sup>+</sup> from the Golgi. Instead, the leak was sensitive to voltage changes and was inhibited by Zn<sup>2+</sup>, resembling the H<sup>+</sup> conductive pathway of the plasma membrane. We conclude that a balance between an endogenous leak, which includes a conductive component, and the H<sup>+</sup>pump determines the pH at which the Golgi lumen attains a steady state."
https://openalex.org/W2008973880,"CD22 is a cell surface molecule that regulates signal transduction in B lymphocytes. Tyrosine-phosphorylated CD22 recruits numerous cytoplasmic effector molecules including SHP-1, a potent phosphotyrosine phosphatase that down-regulates B cell antigen receptor (BCR)- and CD19-generated signals. Paradoxically, B cells from CD22-deficient mice generate augmented intracellular calcium responses following BCR ligation, yet proliferation is decreased. To understand further the mechanisms through which CD22 regulates BCR-dependent calcium flux and proliferation, interactions between CD22 and effector molecules involved in these processes were assessed. The adapter proteins Grb2 and Shc were found to interact with distinct and specific regions of the CD22 cytoplasmic domain. Src homology-2 domain-containing inositol polyphosphate-5′-phosphatase (SHIP) also bound phosphorylated CD22, but binding required an intact CD22 cytoplasmic domain. All three molecules were bound to CD22 when isolated from BCR-stimulated splenic B cells, indicating the formation of a CD22·Grb2·Shc·SHIP quaternary complex. Therefore, SHIP associating with CD22 may be important for SHIP recruitment to the cell surface where it negatively regulates calcium influx. Although augmented calcium responses in CD22-deficient mice should facilitate enhanced c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, BCR ligation did not induce JNK activation in CD22-deficient B cells. These data demonstrate that CD22 functions as a molecular “scaffold” that specifically coordinates the docking of multiple effector molecules, in addition to SHP-1, in a context necessary for BCR-dependent SHIP activity and JNK stimulation.

Kinase activation in turn propagates multiple downstream signaling events including tyrosine phosphorylation of important transmembrane receptors, phosphoinositide generation, increases in calcium mobilization into the cytoplasm, and the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Upon cell activation, MAPKs translocate to the nucleus and activate specific transcription factors (6.Kim K.-M. Alber P. Weiser P. Reth M. Eur. J.

Subfamilies of MAPKs include the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), and p38, which become fully activated as a result of dual phosphorylation on single threonine and tyrosine residues (reviewed in Ref. 10.Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I. Nature. 1997; 386: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar).

Also critical to each of these events in B cells are cell surface receptors such as CD22 that modify and provide a context for BCR signal transduction (13.Tedder T.F. Semin.

Kehrl J.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 481-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The ∼140-amino acid cytoplasmic domain of CD22 contains six tyrosines, some of which are rapidly phosphorylated following BCR or CD22 ligation (15.Schulte R.J. Campbell M.A. Fischer W.H. Sefton B.M.

These tyrosines are localized within immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIM) and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif-like sequences (17.Leprince C. Draves K.E. Geahlen R.L.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of Src homology-2 (SH2) domain-containing inositol polyphosphate-5′-phosphatase (SHIP), PLC-γ2, CD79a, and CD79b is decreased in CD22-deficient B cells following BCR cross-linking, whereas Syk, Lyn, Fyn, Blk, and SHP-1 are phosphorylated at wild type levels (32.Sato S. Jansen P.J. Tedder T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13158-13162Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In addition, CD22 interacts with Grb2 following BCR stimulation of the K46 B lymphoma cell line (29.Yohannan J. Wienands J. Coggeshall K.M. Justement L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18769-18776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, interactions between CD22 and multiple effector molecules may contribute to both positive and negative signaling pathways. Critical interactions between CD22 and other effector molecules may provide a molecular explanation for augmented calcium responses yet decreased proliferation by CD22-deficient B cells in response to BCR ligation. Although decreased recruitment of SHP-1 to the plasma membrane due to the absence of CD22 could explain augmented calcium responses, evidence suggests that other molecules are also involved. SHP-1 and SHIP differentially down-regulate calcium responses by preventing release from intracellular stores and from the influx of extracellular free calcium, respectively (33.Ono M. Okada H.

Like the killer cell inhibitory receptor class of molecules, which block the release of calcium from intracellular stores (34.Blery M. Delon J. Trautmann A. Cambiaggi A. Olcese L. Biassoni R. Moretta L. Chavrier A. Moretta A. Daeron M. Vivier E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8989-8996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that CD22 inhibits calcium release solely through SHP-1 activity (33.Ono M. Okada H. Bolland S. Yanagi S. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Cell. 1997; 90: 293-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). However, CD22 modulates the mobilization of both intracellular and extracellular calcium (27.O'Keefe T.L. Williams G.T. Davies S.L. Neuberger M.S. Science. 1996; 274: 798-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), suggesting that CD22 up-regulates both SHP-1 and SHIP activity. A SHIP·Grb2·Shc ternary complex forms following BCR ligation in primary B cells, which may be required for recruitment of SHIP to the plasma membrane where it down-regulates calcium mobilization (35.Harmer S.L. DeFranco A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 274: 12183-12191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To evaluate further how CD22 regulates calcium mobilization, we have assessed the ability of SHIP to associate with CD22 in the current study. Since calcium mobilization is dramatically elevated in CD22-deficient B cells and calcium mobilization is essential for JNK activation (10.Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I. Nature. 1997; 386: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar, 11.Hashimoto A. Okada H. Jiang A. Kurosaki M. Greenberg S. Clark E.A. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1287-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 12.Jiang A. Craxton A. Kurosaki T. Clark E.A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), we have also assessed whether CD22 loss enhances JNK activation following BCR ligation. These studies reveal that phosphorylated CD22 specifically associates with SHIP, Grb2, and Shc to form a quaternary complex. Intriguingly, despite augmented calcium mobilization in CD22-deficient B cells, JNK activation was selectively impaired, which may explain their decreased proliferative responses. Thus, adapter protein-mediated interactions between CD22 and other effector molecules are likely to contribute to the regulatory activities of CD22. CD22-deficient (B6 × 129) and wild type control mice (B6 × 129) were generated by breeding mice heterozygous for the CD22 deficiency as described (24.Sato S. Miller A.S. Inaoki M. Bock C.B. Jansen P.J. Tang M.L.K. Tedder T.F. Immunity. 1996; 5: 551-562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 36.Engel P. Zhou L.-J. Ord D.C. Sato S. Koller B. Tedder T.F. Immunity. 1995; 3: 39-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). All mice were 2 months of age when used and were housed in a specific pathogen-free barrier facility. All studies and procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Duke University. A cDNA that encoded a GST-CD22 fusion protein (GST-CD22cyt) containing the complete mouse CD22 cytoplasmic domain starting at amino acid 708 (14.Tedder T.F. Tuscano J. Sato S. Kehrl J.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 481-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) in plasmid pGEX-3X was expressed in TKX1 tyrosine kinase-competent Escherichia coli (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Fusion protein expression (GST-CD22cyt) was induced by culturing the bacteria in LB medium containing 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, 50 μg/ml ampicillin, and 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline for 3 h at 37 °C before fusion protein purification. Tyrosine phosphorylation of GST-CD22cyt (GST-CD22cyt(Tyr(P))) was induced by culturing the bacteria with 10 μg/ml indoleacrylic acid in Trp starvation medium (M9 minimal salts medium containing 1 mm MgSO4, 0.2% glucose, 0.1% casamino acids, 1.5 μm thiamine HCl, 50 μg/ml ampicillin, and 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline) for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in ice-cold 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer containing 50 mmHEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm pyrophosphate, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and antipain. The cells were disrupted five times by sonication for 20-s bursts with the cells placed on ice for 1.5 min between sonication cycles. The fusion proteins were purified by column chromatography with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm glutathione, and 0.5 mm each of sodium orthovanadate and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Biotin-conjugated peptides corresponding to regions of the mouse CD22 cytoplasmic domain were synthesized by the University of North Carolina Peptide Synthesis Facility (Chapel Hill, NC) in both tyrosine-phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms. Hybidomas producing CD22-specific monoclonal antibodies were generated by the fusion of NS-1 myeloma cells with spleen cells from a CD22-deficient mouse that was immunized three times with the GST-CD22cyt fusion protein in adjuvant. Supernatant fluid from four hybridomas reacted with GST-CD22cyt in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays but not GST alone. Each anti-CD22 antibody-producing hybridoma was subcloned twice by limiting dilution and used to generate tissue culture supernatant fluid for these studies. Antibody isotypes were determined using a mouse monoclonal antibody isotyping kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10), anti-SHP1, anti-Grb2, and anti-Shc antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-SHIP, anti-Lyn, anti-SOS, anti-BLNK, anti-ERK2, anti-JNK2, and anti-glutathioneS-transferase (GST) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and anti-mouse IgG antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Phospho-specific antibodies reactive with the fully activated forms of MAPK subfamilies were from Promega (Madison, WI). Antisera used also included F(ab′)2 fragments of goat anti-mouse IgM antibodies (Cappel, Durham, NC). B cells were purified from single cell splenocyte suspensions by removing T cells with anti-Thy1.2 antibody-coated magnetic beads (Dynal Inc., Lake Success, NY). B cell suspensions were analyzed by immunofluorescence staining with flow cytometric analysis following isolation and were always >94% B220+. The B cells were resuspended (2 × 107/ml) in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal calf serum. Following incubation for 5 min at 37 °C, B cells were cultured with media alone or containing F(ab′)2 fragments of goat anti-mouse IgM antibodies (40 μg/ml) at 37 °C and then lysed in buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors as described (37.Bradbury L.E. Kansas G.S. Levy S. Evans R.L. Tedder T.F. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2841-2850PubMed Google Scholar). For the detection of MAPK subfamily kinase activation, B cell lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose with indirect immunoblotting using antibodies against active forms of MAPK subfamily members. For immunoprecipitation studies using antibodies reactive with proteins of interest, B cell lysates were pre-cleared using protein G-Sepharose beads (50 μl; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then incubated with 5 μg/ml antibody for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of protein G-Sepharose beads (50 μl) for an additional 2 h. The beads were washed five times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and resuspended in 100 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer followed by boiling for 5 min. For coprecipitation studies using CD22 fusion proteins, B cell lysates were pre-cleared using glutathione-Sepharose beads (50 μl; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then incubated with 25 μg/ml GST-CD22cyt or GST-CD22cyt(Tyr(P)) for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of glutathione-Sepharose beads (50 μl) for an additional 2 h. The beads were washed five times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and resuspended in 100 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer followed by boiling for 5 min. For coprecipitation studies using CD22 peptides, B cell lysates were pre-cleared with avidin-agarose beads (50 μl; Pierce) and then incubated with each peptide (20 μm) for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of avidin-agarose beads (50 μl) for an additional 2 h. The beads were washed five times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and resuspended in 100 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer followed by boiling for 5 min. Precipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE with subsequent electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking the membranes with buffer containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, protein presence was detected either by direct immunoblotting with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody or by indirect immunoblotting using antibodies reactive with the proteins of interest. Incubation periods for primary and secondary antibodies were 1 h at 25 °C with extensive washing of the membranes following each step. Immunoblots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence kits from Pierce. To verify equivalent amounts of protein in each lane, the same blots were stripped and reprobed with antibodies against proteins of interest. Relative band intensities of MAPK immunoblots were determined using NIH Image software (version 1.60). Lyn phosphorylation of CD22 peptides was assessed using in vitro kinase reactions. Each reaction mixture (30 μl) contained CD22 non-phosphorylated peptides or control (phosphorylated) peptides at the indicated concentrations, Src kinase reaction buffer (10 μl), a 1:10 dilution of Src manganese/ATP mixture, 2 units of purified Lyn kinase (all from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Costa Mesa, CA). The reactions were carried out for 20 min at 25 °C before termination using 30 μl of 4.75m guanidine HCl. 20 μl of each reaction mixture was then spotted onto SAMTM Biotin Capture Membranes (Promega). The membranes were washed three times with 2 m NaCl, once with 1 m NaCl + 0.75% phosphoric acid, and once with 2m NaCl containing 1% Tween 20. Radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting. To evaluate effector molecule interactions with the CD22 cytoplasmic domain, a fusion protein consisting of GST and the entire 140-amino acid cytoplasmic domain of mouse CD22 was generated (Fig.1). The fusion protein was produced in bacteria in non-phosphorylated (GST-CD22cyt) and tyrosine-phosphorylated (GST-CD22cyt(Tyr(P))) forms as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Migration of the GST-CD22cyt(Tyr(P)) protein in SDS-PAGE gels was significantly slower than for GST-CD22cyt protein due to tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig.2 C). In addition, peptides containing either single tyrosine motif or tandem tyrosine motif sequences corresponding to specific regions of the CD22 cytoplasmic domain were used in these studies in non-phosphorylated and tyrosine-phosphorylated forms (Fig. 1).Figure 2Characterization of the CD22-specific MB22-1 monoclonal antibody. A, purified splenic B cells (1 × 107 cells/sample) from wild type or CD22-deficient mice were incubated in media alone or with anti-IgM antibodies before detergent lysis. Whole cell lysates (1 × 106 cell equivalents) were subjected to SDS-PAGE, electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with a 1:50 dilution of MB22-1 hybridoma culture supernatant fluid. Antibody reactivity was revealed using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody with detection by enhanced chemiluminescence. B, splenic B cell lysates were prepared as in A with immunoprecipitation (IP) using a 1:10 dilution of MB22-1 hybridoma supernatant fluid followed by capture with protein G-Sepharose beads. Precipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and subsequently immunoblotted with an anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody. C,GST-CD22 cytoplasmic domain fusion proteins or a control GST-CD19 cytoplasmic domain fusion protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE (5 μg per lane) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membrane was first immunoblotted using MB22-1 hybridoma supernatant fluid. The membrane was subsequently stripped and reprobed with anti-GST antibody as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since the two currently reported anti-mouse CD22 monoclonal antibodies react with the extracellular domain of mouse CD22 and do not react with CD22 in Western blots, new antibodies were generated that react with CD22 under reducing conditions. Monoclonal antibody secreting hybridomas were generated by immunizing CD22-deficient mice with the GST-CD22cyt fusion protein. Of 546 hybridomas screened, four secreted IgG1 antibodies that reacted with the GST-CD22cyt fusion protein in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays but not GST alone (31 antibodies): MB22-1, MB22-2, MB22-3, and MB22-4. One of the four antibodies, MB22-1 reacted predominantly with a band of M r 145,000 and to a lesser extent with a band of M r 130,000 in immunoblots of mouse splenocytes from wild type but not CD22-deficient mice (Fig. 2 A). These bands appear to represent CD22 with differences in post-translational processing, and the M r 145,000 protein was further resolved into two similar-sized bands in some experiments. The MB22-1 antibody effectively immunoprecipitated the M r 145,000 isoform of CD22 from B cell lysates as detected by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 2 B). The MB22-1 antibody did not immunoprecipitate phosphoproteins from CD22-deficient B cells (Fig. 2 B). Also, MB22-1 did not react with CD22 in lysates of human B cell lines (data not shown). The MB22-1 antibody reacted equally with the GST-CD22cyt and GST-CD22cyt(Tyr(P)) fusion proteins bound to nitrocellulose but did not react with a CD19-GST fusion protein (Fig. 2 C). Since CD22 interacts with Grb2 following BCR stimulation in K46 cells (29.Yohannan J. Wienands J. Coggeshall K.M. Justement L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18769-18776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and primary B cells generate a SHIP·Grb2·Shc ternary complex following BCR ligation (35.Harmer S.L. DeFranco A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 274: 12183-12191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we assessed whether CD22 could serve as a membrane-proximal docking site for the SHIP·Grb2·Shc complex. The ability of the SHIP·Grb2·Shc complex to associate with CD22 in primary cells was evaluated by immunoprecipitation of SHIP, Grb2, and Shc from cell lysates of resting and anti-IgM activated splenic B cells, followed by detection of CD22 in the complexes by immunoblotting. SHIP, Grb2, and Shc each coprecipitated CD22 at low levels from resting B cells but at significantly higher levels following BCR stimulation for 5 min (Fig.3, A–C). Equivalent levels of SHIP and Grb2 were precipitated from resting and activated B cells as revealed by stripping the immunoblots and reprobing with anti-SHIP or anti-Grb2 antibodies (Fig. 3, A and B). The anti-Shc antibody used in these studies was inadequate for reprobing Western blots, so the cell lysates were reprecipitated with an anti-Vav antibody and immunoblotted with the anti-Vav antibody to verify equal protein concentrations in the cell lysates (Fig. 3 C). The GTP exchange factor SOS, an activator of the ERK pathway, has also been reported to interact with CD22 following BCR stimulation in K46 cells (29.Yohannan J. Wienands J. Coggeshall K.M. Justement L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18769-18776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, SOS did not coprecipitate CD22 at detectable levels in primary B cells, so the anti-SOS antibody was used as a negative control in these experiments (Fig. 3). Although it is possible that SOS may interact with CD22 in primary splenic B cells at later time points of activation, these results suggest that a fundamental difference in signaling events exists between primary splenic B cells and the K46 cell line. The ability of CD22 to coprecipitate SHIP, Grb2, and Shc from lysates of resting and anti-IgM activated splenic B cells was also assessed by immunoblotting. CD22 immunoprecipitated from activated B cell lysates coprecipitated SHIP, but SHIP was not coprecipitated from lysates of unstimulated B cells (data not shown). Shc and Grb2 interactions with CD22 could not be effectively evaluated i"
https://openalex.org/W2034711771,"Induction of CYP2E1 (cytochromeP450 2E1) by ethanol appears to be one of the central pathways by which ethanol generates a state of oxidative stress. CYP2E1 is a loosely coupled enzyme; formation of reactive oxygen species occurs even in the absence of added substrate. GSH is critical for preserving the proper cellular redox balance and for its role as a cellular protectant. Since cells must maintain optimal GSH levels to cope with a variety of stresses, the goal of this study was to characterize the GSH homeostasis in human hepatocarcinoma cells (HepG2) that overexpress CYP2E1. This study was prompted by the finding that toxicity in CYP2E1-overexpressing cells was markedly enhanced after GSH depletion by buthionine sulfoximine treatment. CYP2E1-overexpressing cells showed a 40–50% increase in intracellular H2O2; a 30% increase in total GSH levels; a 50% increase in the GSH synthesis rate; and a 2-fold increase in γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase heavy subunit (GCS-HS) mRNA, the rate-limiting enzyme in GSH synthesis. This GCS-HS mRNA increase was due to increased synthesis since nuclear run-on assays showed increased transcription in CYP2E1-expressing cells, and the GCS-HS mRNA decay after actinomycin D treatment was similar in CYP2E1-expressing cells and empty vector-transfected cells. The facts that treatment with GSH ethyl ester almost completely prevented the increase in GCS-HS mRNA and decreased H2O2levels and that transient transfection with catalase (but not manganese-superoxide dismutase) produced a decrease in GCS-HS mRNA only in CYP2E1-expressing cells suggest a possible role for H2O2 in the induction of GCS-HS gene transcription. In contrast to results with HepG2 cells expressing CYP2E1, no increase in GCS-HS mRNA was found with a HepG2 cell line engineered to express human cytochrome P450 3A4. In summary, CYP2E1 overexpression in HepG2 cells up-regulates the levels of reduced GSH by transcriptional activation of GCS-HS; this may reflect an adaptive mechanism to remove CYP2E1-derived oxidants such as H2O2.

Kaplowitz N. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 52: 287-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). In the liver, the cellular GSH level is determined by a balance between the rate of its synthesis and the rates of its utilization (conjugation) and loss (export) (2.Kaplowitz N. Aw T.Y. Ookhtens M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1985; 25: 714-744Crossref Google Scholar). Endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is removed by GSH in the presence of glutathione peroxidase and can also be removed by catalase in the peroxisomes. Furthermore, conjugation with GSH, catalyzed by glutathione S-transferases (GST),1 is an integral step in the detoxification and elimination of diverse classes of toxic chemical compounds (3.Pickett C.B.

Most of the studies reported in the literature have examined transcriptional regulation of GCS-HS. Induction of CYP2E1 (cytochrome P4502E1) and formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation derivatives appear to be one of the mechanisms by which ethanol is hepatotoxic (15.Lieber C.S. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 517-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar, 16.Koop D.R. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 724-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that CYP2E1, when reduced by NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, is a loosely coupled enzyme that displays high NADPH oxidase activity (17.Gorsky L.D. Koop D.R. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6812-6817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Ekstrom G. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Formation of reactive oxygen species can occur even in the absence of added substrates, e.g. formation of superoxide and H2O2 by microsomes from CYP2E1-expressing cells was not altered by addition of substrates and ligands of CYP2E1 (19.Dai Y. Rashba-Step J. Cederbaum A.I. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6928-6937Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). To directly demonstrate that ROS generated by CYP2E1 can promote hepatotoxicity even in the absence of substrate, a HepG2 cell line with enhanced expression of CYP2E1 was recently established (20.Chen Q. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The CYP2E1-expressing cells (E47) have a slower growth rate than the empty vector-transfected control C34 cells when cellular GSH levels are maintained, but display a loss of cell viability when GSH synthesis is inhibited by treatment with BSO. However, we observed that despite increased production of ROS, GSH levels are not decreased in E47 cells compared with C34 cells. This suggested that a possible up-regulation of GSH synthesis and/or increased GSH turnover may occur in E47 cells in response to the increased oxidative stress. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether CYP2E1 overexpression could mediate an effect on GSH homeostasis. Two human hepatoma HepG2 sublines, which were established previously in our laboratory (20.Chen Q. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), were used as a model in this study. E47 and E43 cells contain the human CYP2E1 cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. F. J. Gonzalez, NCI, National Institutes of Health) inserted into theEcoRI restriction site of the pCI-neo expression vector (Promega, Madison, WI) in the sense orientation. C34 cells contain the pCI-neo vector alone. The HepG2 transduced clones C34 and E47 were cultured in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine in a humidified atmosphere in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were maintained in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml of Geneticin. Most reagents were purchased from Sigma. The protein content of cell lysates was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (21.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the DC-20 protein assay kit (Bio-Rad), and 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Specific reagents are described below. CYP2E1 levels were routinely monitored by assaying the oxidation of p-nitrophenol to p-nitrocatechol. Cells (1 × 106) were seeded onto 100-mm plates and incubated overnight before any treatment. Cells were washed twice with 1× PBS, detached by trypsinization, and treated with 10% (1:1, v/v) trichloroacetic acid to extract cellular GSH. The mixture was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 1 min to remove denatured proteins, and GSH was determined by the enzymatic method of Tietze (22.Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5556) Google Scholar). The GSH content was assayed by following the increase in absorbance at 412 nm for 2 min in a cuvette containing 0.1m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 5 μmEDTA, 0.6 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), 0.2 mm NADPH, 1 unit/ml glutathione reductase, and 10 μl of sample (corresponding to ∼100 μg of protein) in a final volume of 1 ml. For determination of GSSG, the same 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) recycling assay was performed after using 2-vinylpyridine to remove reduced GSH (23.Griffith O.W. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μl of 2-vinylpyridine and 6 μl of triethanolamine were simultaneously mixed with 100 μl of sample, followed by incubation in the dark at room temperature for 1 h before initiating the recycling assay. The kinetics of the reaction were monitored for 10 min. The increment in absorbance at 412 nm was converted to GSH concentration using a standard curve with known amounts of GSH. Cells (1 × 106) were seeded onto 100-mm plates and incubated overnight before any treatment. DCFDA was added at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml, and plates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark. Cells were washed twice with 1× PBS, trypsinized, and resuspended in 3 ml of 1× PBS; and fluorescence was immediately read in a Perkin-Elmer 650-10S fluorescence spectrometer at 490 nm for excitation and 525 nm for emission with a slit width of 5 nm for both excitation and emission monochromators. Background readings from cells incubated without DCFDA were substracted. Results are expressed as arbitrary units of fluorescence. Monochlorobimane can be used to measure activities of enzymes involved in GSH synthesis (24.Fernández-Checa J.C. Kaplowitz N. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 190: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Monochlorobimane forms a fluorescent adduct with GSH in a reaction catalyzed by GST. Cells were grown in 75-cm2flasks to 80% confluence, washed twice with 1× PBS, scraped off in 0.01 m sodium phosphate plus 0.25 m sucrose (pH 7.4), sonicated for 3 s in a W220 sonicator (Ultrasonic, Farmingdale, NY), and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. Cell extracts were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C to deplete the cytosolic GSH content in order to minimize feedback inhibition of GSH on GCS. The synthesis of GSH was followed at 37 °C in a cuvette containing a mixture of 100 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mmKCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm ATP, 10 mm glutamate, 10 mmglycine, and 0.4 mm cysteine plus 0.4 mmdithiothreitol and 100 μm monochlorobimane in a final volume of 2.5 ml at pH 7.3. The reaction was started by addition of cytosol (100 μl, 1–10 mg of protein) that was or was not preincubated with BSO (20 mm for 20 min) to specifically inhibit GCS activity, and formation of the GSH-bimane fluorescent complex was monitored over time at 37 °C using the Perkin-Elmer 650-10S fluorescence spectrometer with excitation at 385 nm and emission at 478 nm with a slit width of 5 nm for both excitation and emission monochromators. The difference in the rate of increase in fluorescence in the absence and presence of BSO is equivalent to the rate of GSH synthesis. The change in fluorescence was converted to GSH concentration using standard curves. Specifically, formation of fluorescent adduct was monitored by adding monochlorobimane (100 μm) and GST (0.1 unit/ml) to a cuvette containing GSH standards. To study GSH efflux, C34 and E47 cells were seeded onto 100-mm plastic dishes at 37 °C in a 5% CO2and 95% air atmosphere and studied when confluency was almost reached. To measure GSH efflux, the cells were first incubated for 1 h with 0.5 mm acivicin to inhibit the enzyme γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (25.Sze G. Kaplowitz N. Ookhtens M. Lu S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: G1128-G1134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were then washed twice with Krebs-Henseleit buffer supplemented with 12.5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and incubated in 4 ml of Krebs buffer at 37 °C for 90 min. Aliquots of the supernatant (500 μl) were removed at 5, 30, 60, and 90 min, and GSH was determined as described above. Glutathione peroxidase was assayed according to Flohé and Günzler (26.Flohé L. Günzler W.A. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (4109) Google Scholar) using t-BOOH as a substrate. The following solutions were added to a cuvette: 700 μl of solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl plus 5 mmEDTA (pH 7.4), 1.6 mm GSH, 0.32 mm NADPH, and 0.8 units/ml glutathione reductase; 70 μl of sample (∼0.3–1.0 mg of protein); and 350 μl of 0.007% (v/v) t-BOOH. The decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was followed for 4 min. Results are expressed as units of specific activity defined as the amount of enzyme that consumes 1 μmol of NADPH/min/mg of protein. GST activity was determined according to the method of Habig et al. (27.Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jackoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) with some modifications. The reaction was carried out in 0.1 mpotassium phosphate (pH 6.5), 1 mm GSH, and 1 mm 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene in the presence of 50 μl of cell lysate (∼0.3–1.0 mg of protein), and the increase in absorbance was monitored at 340 nm and 25 °C over a 4-min time period. Results are expressed as units of specific activity defined as the amount of the enzyme that produces 1 μmol of conjugated product/min/mg of protein. Glutathione reductase was determined according to the method of Carlberg and Mannervick (28.Carlberg I. Mannervick B. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 484-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (2643) Google Scholar). The following solutions were added sequentially to a cuvette: 800 μl of 0.125m potassium phosphate plus 1.25 mm EDTA (pH 7.0), 50 μl of 2 mm NADPH, 50 μl of 20 mmGSSG, and 100 μl of sample (∼0.1–0.3 mg of protein); and the decrease in absorbance was monitored at 340 nm for 2 min. One unit of glutathione reductase is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of 1 μmol of NADPH/min/mg of protein. Total superoxide dismutase activity was measured according to Paoletti and Mocali (29.Paoletti F. Mocali A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). One unit of superoxide dismutase activity is defined as the amount of cell extract required to inhibit the rate of NADPH oxidation of the control by 50%. The control consisted of a sample in which the cell extract was omitted from the reaction mixture. The following solutions were sequentially added to a cuvette: 0.8 ml of 100 mmtriethanolamine/diethanolamine (pH 7.4), 40 μl of 7.5 mmNADPH, 25 μl of 100 mm EDTA plus 50 mmMnCl2, and 100 μl of dialyzed cell extract (∼0.5 mg of protein) or buffer. The contents were mixed, and the absorbance was read at 340 nm against air until a stable base line was observed as recorded over a 5-min period. Then, 100 μl of 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol was added, followed by mixing; and the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was monitored for over a 20-min reaction period. Measurements of the relative rates for both the control and cell extract were made from the linear portion of the curves. Total RNA was isolated using the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Ten micrograms of RNA was electrophoresed under denaturing conditions on formaldehyde-containing 0.9% agarose gels and transferred onto GeneScreen nylon membranes (NEN Life Science Products). RNA was UV-cross-linked at 1200 J × 100 for 30 s and prehybridized in a hybridization oven for 2 h at 42 °C in 5× SSC, 50% formamide, 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.5), and 1× Denhardt's solution containing 0.1 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. cDNA probes were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP (specific activity > 3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a random primer DNA labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immobilized RNA was hybridized in 0.1% SDS, 5× SSC, 50% formamide, 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.5), 1× Denhardt's solution, and 12.5× dextran sulfate with 106 cpm/ml labeled cDNA and 0.1 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA for 16 h at 42 °C. Blots were washed four times for 15 min with 2× SSC and 0.5% SDS at 65 °C, exposed to a phosphor storage screen for a fixed period of time according to the hybridized cDNA, and scanned in a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Values were normalized to the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA using ImageQuant software. The GCS-HS cDNA was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC 1064067, Manassas, VA). The GCS-LS probe was obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction amplification of a fragment of 513 base pairs with the primers 5′-GGA GTT TCC AGA TGT CTT GG-3′ and 5′-GGA ATG CTT TCC TGA AGA GC-3′; the complete GCS-LS cDNA sequence was obtained from a published sequence (GenBankTM/EBI accession L35546) (30.Gipp J.J. Bailey H.H. Mulcahy R.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 584-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Cultured cells were washed twice with sterile 1× PBS, scraped off, and transferred into 15-ml Falcon tubes for centrifugation at 500 × gat 4 °C for 5 min. Pellets were loosened and resuspended in 4 ml of Buffer A (10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mm NaCl, and 3 mm MgCl2). After addition of 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, samples were vortexed for 10 s and kept on ice for 10 min. After a second centrifugation, supernatants containing cytoplasmic RNA were discarded, and 4 ml of Buffer A was added. Samples were kept on ice for 10 min and spun down. Nuclei were collected in 100 μl of storage buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.3), 40% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm EDTA) and immediately stored at −70 °C until analyzed. Transcription was assayed in vitro with 100 μl of nuclei (isolated from ∼25 × 106 cells), 100 μCi of [32P]UTP, and 100 μl of assay buffer (2.5 mm MnCl2, 125 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 12.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mmdithiothreitol, 2.5 mm ATP, 1.25 mm GTP, 1.25 mm CTP, and 375 mm KCl). The reaction was carried out at 25 °C for 45 min and stopped by adding DNase I (RNase-free) at a final concentration of 20 μg/ml. After incubation at 30 °C for 5 min, RNA was released from the nuclei by treatment with 1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), and 200 μg/ml proteinase K at 42 °C for 30 min. Newly transcribed RNA was isolated using the Trizol reagent. Eight micrograms of each cDNA of interest was denatured in 0.25n NaOH and 0.5 m NaCl for 10 min at room temperature and diluted in 0.1× SSC and 0.125 n NaOH. Samples were blotted onto GeneScreen membranes, neutralized in 0.5n NaCl and 0.5 m Tris (pH 7.5), and UV-cross-linked. Prehybridization was carried out for 6 h at 42 °C, and purified denatured riboprobes (1 × 106cpm/ml) were used for hybridization for 72 h at 42 °C. The composition of the hybridization buffer was the same as described for the Northern blot assay, using 0.1 mg/ml bakers' yeast tRNA instead of the salmon sperm DNA. After four washes of 15 min each with 2× SSC and 0.5% SDS at 65 °C, membranes were exposed to the phosphor storage screen, and the signals were quantified using the GAPDH mRNA signal as a control. Transient transfection experiments were carried out with pCI vector containing CYP2E1 in the antisense (pCI-AS-2E1) or sense (pCI-2E1) orientation, pcDNA3-MnSOD (kindly provided by Dr. Larry Oberley, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA), or pZeoSV2-catalase (kindly provided by Dr. A. Melendez, Albany Medical College, Albany, NY). Controls for these experiments included transfections with the empty vectors pCI, pZeoSV2, and pcDNA3. Transfection of C34 and E47 cells was carried out with 10 μg of the appropriate plasmid, 3 μg of pL7-Lac (kindly provided by Dr. Robert Krauss, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY), and 30 μl of Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After 48 h, the efficiency of the transfection was determined by X-gal staining; and at 48 and 96 h, total RNA was isolated to study GCS-HS and GAPDH mRNA expression by Northern blotting. Results refer to means ± S.D. and are average values from three to six values per experiment; experiments were repeated at least twice. Statistical evaluation among groups was carried out using Student's t test, and p< 0.05 was considered significant. GSH is among the most important intracellular antioxidants. Since ROS generated from CYP2E1 or other sources can be removed either by direct reaction with GSH (e.g. the hydroxyl radical) or by the glutathione peroxidase reaction (e.g. H2O2), we investigated the effect of CYP2E1 overexpression on the regulation of total cellular GSH equivalents (GSH + GSSG) and the generation of hydrogen peroxide as an indicator of ROS. Hydrogen peroxide was monitored by quantification of fluorescence of DCF, a highly fluorescent probe sensitive to peroxides. BSO is an effective inhibitor of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, the rate-limiting enzyme for GSH synthesis. The intracellular GSH levels in E47 and C34 cells with or without BSO treatment were evaluated (Fig.1). In the absence of BSO treatment, E47 cells cultured in normal minimal essential medium had a significant 30% increase in total GSH compared with C34 cells (Fig.1 A); GSSG levels were very low and similar in both cell lines (data not shown). As expected, BSO treatment caused a decline in intracellular GSH in both cell lines; although the fall in intracellular GSH in E47 cells was linear over the 8-h reaction period, the decline in GSH in C34 cells showed a lag of ∼4 h. Thereafter, the fall in GSH was similar for E47 and C34 cells (Fig. 1 B). To determine if the decline in GSH levels was due, at least in part, to GSH efflux from the cells, the GSH content in the medium was assayed. GSH efflux could not be observed unless acivicin, an inhibitor of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase was added, confirming reports of others (25.Sze G. Kaplowitz N. Ookhtens M. Lu S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: G1128-G1134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The initial levels of GSH in the medium of E47 cells were ∼25% higher than the levels in the medium of C34 cells, most likely a reflection of the 30% higher intracellular GSH levels in E47 cells. The rate of GSH efflux, as assayed over a 90-min time period (Fig.1 C), was 36.0 ± 4.0 pmol/min/mg of protein in C34 cells, whereas the rate in E47 cells was 50.3 ± 3.5 pmol/min/mg of protein (∼40% higher). From the rate of GSH efflux, ∼6 nmol of GSH/mg of protein would be released from E47 cells in 2 h, which is equivalent to the loss of intracellular GSH in 2 h (Fig.1 B). Thus, most of the decline in intracellular GSH in E47 cells, after BSO treatment to prevent new synthesis, is due to GSH efflux from the cells. Similar calculations with C34 cells indicated that ∼4 nmol of GSH/mg of protein would be excreted from the cells in 2 h, which is greater than the 1-nmol decline in intracellular GSH found at 2 h. The reasons for this discrepancy and the lag in the fall in GSH in C34 cells are not known. As shown in Fig. 2, E47 cells labeled with DCFDA displayed a significant 40–50% increase in DCF fluorescence compared with C34 cells; this fluorescence was further elevated after treatment with BSO for 24–48 h, indicating the critical role of GSH in detoxification of ROS generated by CYP2E1 in E47 cells. It is interesting that increased DCF fluorescence was observed in E47 cells even though GSH levels were elevated in these cells. The small increase in DCF fluorescence in C34 cells 24–48 h after BSO treatment likely reflects the effectiveness of the residual GSH (∼20% of control values) in maintaining antioxidant function coupled with the lack of a significant oxidative stress in these cells as compared with E47 cells (20.Chen Q. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Indeed, C34 cells remained fully viable after BSO treatment, in contrast to the loss of viability of E47 cells. To maintain the intracellular GSH levels, GSSG is reduced back to GSH by glutathione reductase at the expense of NADPH, or de novo synthesis of GSH occurs. Organic hydroperoxides can be reduced by either glutathione peroxidase or GST. Superoxide is converted to H2O2 by superoxide dismutase. H2O2 can be removed either by reduction by GSH in the cytosol as catalyzed by glutathione peroxidase or by catalase in the peroxisomes. As shown in Table I, there was no difference in the activities of glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase in C34 and E47 cells. There was a 30% decrease in glutathione peroxidase activity in cells overexpressing CYP2E1. However, there was a 2-fold increase in GST activity in E47 cells compared with C34 cells. Thus, there appears to be a mixed response by enzymes involved in GSH homeostasis to the presence of CYP2E1 in E47 cells, with increases (GST), decreases (glutathione peroxidase), or no change (glutathione reductase) being observed.Table IAntioxidant enzyme activities in C34 and E47 cellsAntioxidant enzymeC34E47GRap < 0.05 compared with C34 cells.60.15 ± 6.2354.32 ± 7.21SOD1.40 ± 0.081.37 ± 0.05GPx16.40 ± 1.9611.25 ± 2.34ap < 0.05 compared with C34 cells.GST17.21 ± 2.5636.94 ± 1.79ap < 0.05 compared with C34 cells.The activities of glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and GST were determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” Results are expressed in milliunits/mg of cell protein for glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, and GST and in units/mg of cell protein for superoxide dismutase and refer to means ± S.D.

https://openalex.org/W2028967615,"Extracellular matrix proteins play key roles in controlling the activities of osteoblasts and osteoclasts in bone remodeling. These bone-specific extracellular matrix proteins contain amino acid sequences that mediate cell adhesion, and many of the bone-specific matrix proteins also contain acidic domains that interact with the mineral surface and may orient the signaling domains. Here we report a fusion peptide design that is based on this natural approach for the display of signaling peptide sequences at biomineral surfaces. Salivary statherin contains a 15-amino acid hydroxyapatite binding domain (N15) that is loosely helical in solution. To test whether N15 can serve to orient active peptide sequences on hydroxyapatite, the RGD and flanking residues from osteopontin were fused to the C terminus. The fusion peptides bound tightly to hydroxyapatite, and the N15-PGRGDS peptide mediated the dose-dependent adhesion of Moα<sub>v</sub> melanoma cells when immobilized on the hydroxyapatite surface. Experiments with an integrin-sorted Moα<sub>v</sub> subpopulation demonstrated that the α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin was the primary receptor target for the fusion peptide. Solid state NMR experiments showed that the RGD portion of the hydrated fusion peptide is highly dynamic on the hydroxyapatite surface. This fusion peptide framework may thus provide a straightforward design for immobilizing bioactive sequences on hydroxyapatite for biomaterials, tissue engineering, and vaccine applications."
https://openalex.org/W2038006194,"Retinoic acid receptor γ (RARγ) is phosphorylated in COS-1 cells at two conserved serine residues located in the N-terminal region (serines 77 and 79 in RARγ1 and serines 66 and 68 in RARγ2) that contains the activation function AF-1. These serines are phosphorylated in vitro by cdk7, a cyclin-dependent kinase associated to cyclin H and MAT1 in the CAK complex (cdk7·cyclin H·MAT1), that is found either free or as a component of the transcription/DNA repair factor TFIIH. RARγ is more efficiently phosphorylated by TFIIH than by CAK and interacts not only with cdk7 but also with several additional subunits of TFIIH. RARγ phosphorylation and interaction with TFIIH occur in a ligand-independent manner.

There are three RAR (α, β, and γ) and three RXR (α, β, and γ) isotypes, and for each isotype there are at least two main isoforms that differ in their N-terminal region (1.Chambon P.

The N-terminal A/B region of RARs contains a ligand-independent transcriptional activation function, AF-1 (7.Nagpal S. Saunders M. Kastner P. Durand B. Nakshatri H. Chambon P.

Although the B regions of the three RAR isotypes are moderately conserved, their A regions are unrelated and differ for each isoform of a given RAR isotype (5.Leid M. Kastner P. Chambon P.

The function of region F, if any, is unknown. Region E is more complex, as it contains the ligand binding domain, a dimerization interface, and the ligand-dependent transcriptional activation/repression domain AF-2 (1.Chambon P.

The activity of AF-2 is entirely dependent on the integrity of a conserved sequence referred to as the AF-2 AD core, located in α-helix 12 at the C-terminal end of the ligand binding domain. Ligand binding induces a major conformational change that includes helix 12 and creates a new surface for coactivator binding while corepressors are released, thus resulting in a transcriptional-competent nuclear receptor relayed to the transcriptional machinery and the chromatin template (1.Chambon P.

RARα can be phosphorylated in its AF-1-containing B region by the cyclin-dependent kinase cdk7 (14.Rochette-Egly C. Adam S. Rossignol M. Egly J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1997; 90: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), which together with MAT1 and cyclin H forms the CAK complex that is found either free or as a component of the general transcription/DNA repair factor TFIIH (17.Tirode F.

This phosphorylation, which results from an interaction with cdk7, is crucial for RARα transcriptional activity and modulates its ligand-induced degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. 2E.

Rochette-Egly, submitted for publication. RARα can also be phosphorylated by protein kinase A at a residue located in the ligand binding domain (15.Rochette-Egly C. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Staub A. Pfister V. Scheuer I. Chambon P. Gaub M.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 860-871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this phosphorylation is required for differentiation of mouse embryonal carcinoma F9 cells into parietal endoderm-like cells upon RA and cAMP treatment (13.Taneja R. Rochette-Egly C. Plassat J.L. Penna L. Gaub M.P. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6452-6465Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Similarly, RXRα was found to be phosphorylated in its N-terminal A/B region and shown to be hyperphosphorylated in the same region by c-Jun N-terminal kinases upon UV activation (16.Adam-Stitah S. Penna L. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18932-18941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).Mutations of putative phosphorylation sites located in the AF-1 domain of mRARγ2 were found to prevent the RA-induced differentiation of F9 cells (13.Taneja R. Rochette-Egly C. Plassat J.L. Penna L. Gaub M.P. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6452-6465Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), thus indicating that RARγ2 phosphorylation in this domain could be required for this differentiation. Moreover, phosphorylation in the same domain was recently shown to be crucial for the ligand-induced degradation of RARγ by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.2 Because of our previous demonstration that RARα can be phosphorylated by cdk7 present within TFIIH, we assumed that RARγ could also be phosphorylated by TFIIH. In the present study, we demonstrate that the B region of the two major human or mouse RARγ isoforms, RARγ1 and RARγ2, are phosphorylated in a ligand-independent manner, by the cyclin H- and MAT1-dependent protein kinase cdk7. We also show that phosphorylation of RARγ is more efficient when cdk7 is present within TFIIH. In addition, we reveal the existence of multiple RARγ-TFIIH interactions that involve not only cdk7 but also additional subunits of TFIIH. Finally, phosphorylation of the A/B region was found to modulate RARγ-induced transcription in a response gene-dependent manner.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have demonstrated that RARγ is phosphorylated in the N-terminal region that contains the activation function AF-1 (8.Nagpal S. Friant S. Nakshatri H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2349-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and plays an essential role in RA-induced primitive endodermal differentiation of F9 cells (13.Taneja R. Rochette-Egly C. Plassat J.L. Penna L. Gaub M.P. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6452-6465Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation, which involves two serine residues, is ligand-independent and appears to be most efficiently performed by the cyclin H-dependent kinase cdk7, a component of the general transcription/DNA repair factor TFIIH (17.Tirode F. Busso D. Coin F. Egly J.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 87-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 41.Svejstrup J.Q. Vichi P. Egly J.M. Trends Biochem.

Dev. 1996; 6: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this phosphorylation modulates the activity of AF-1 in a responsive gene-dependent manner.RARγ Is Phosphorylated by cdk7 in Its B and F RegionsRARγ is phosphorylated at two phosphorylation sites located in the B region. These sites are present in both the γ1 and γ2 isoforms and are conserved between human and mouse (21.Krust A. Kastner P. Petkovich M. Zelent A. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5310-5314Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 23.Kastner P. Krust A. Mendelsohn C. Garnier J.M. Zelent A. Leroy P. Staub A. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2700-2704Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). They have been identified to serines 66 and 68 in RARγ2 and to serines 77 and 79 in RARγ1 (see Fig. 1). In this latter case, our data show that phosphorylation of serine 77 depends on that of serine 79. As previously reported for RARα (14.Rochette-Egly C. Adam S. Rossignol M. Egly J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1997; 90: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), we demonstrate that these sites are phosphorylated by cdk7, a cyclin H- and MAT1-dependent kinase. Indeed, overexpression of wild type cdk7, but not of cdk7 mutated at its ATP binding site or of any other cdk, results in a higher level of phosphorylation of the various RARs so far tested (Ref.14.Rochette-Egly C. Adam S. Rossignol M. Egly J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1997; 90: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). 3J. Bastien, S. Adam-Stitah, and C. Rochette-Egly, unpublished results. Moreover, similarly to RARα, the pattern of phosphorylation of RARγ appears to be independent of the phases of the cell cycle (Ref. 14.Rochette-Egly C. Adam S. Rossignol M. Egly J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1997; 90: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar).3As previously reported for RARα, RARγ is also phosphorylated in its F region. However, this phosphorylation concerns only mouse RARγ (either the γ1 or the γ2 isoforms) and not its human counterpart, due to the lack of conservation of this region between human and mouse (see Fig. 1). In contrast to phosphorylation of region B, no role has yet been found for this F region phosphorylation, either in RARα or in RARγ.RARγ Is More Efficiently Phosphorylated by TFIIH than by Free CAKCdk7 is associated with cyclin H and MAT1 in the CAK complex, and in the cell CAK is found either free or complexed with TFIIH, a general transcription factor also involved in DNA repair (17.Tirode F. Busso D. Coin F. Egly J.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 87-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 18.Drapkin R. Le Roy G. Cho H. Akoulitchev S. Reinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad.

A. 1996; 93: 6482-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we have shown that RARγ is more efficiently phosphorylated in vitro by cdk7 when included in TFIIH rather than in CAK, as previously reported for RARα (14.Rochette-Egly C. Adam S. Rossignol M. Egly J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1997; 90: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and for the CTD of RNA polymerase II (19.Rossignol M. Kolb-Cheynel I.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23922-23925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). That RARs are more efficiently phosphorylated by TFIIH than by CAK may result from RAR interactions not only with cdk7, as previously reported (Ref. 14.Rochette-Egly C. Adam S. Rossignol M. Egly J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1997; 90: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar and Fig. 5), but also with core subunits of TFIIH. Indeed, in coimmunoprecipitations experiments performed with insect cells coinfected with baculoviruses expressing different subunits of TFIIH and either RARγ or RARα, we found that both RARs interact not only with cdk7 in CAK and TFIIH but also with several subunits of the TFIIH core. Thus, these multiple interactions may account for more efficient phosphorylation by cdk7 within TFIIH than within free CAK. Note that other transcription factors such as p53 and E2F-1, which have been shown to be phosphorylated by cdk7, also interact with the core subunits of TFIIH (45.Leveillard T. Andera L. Bissonnette N. Schaeffer L. Bracco L. Egly J.M. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1615-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 46.Warbrick E. Curr.

A. 1996; 93: 10578-10583Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).How cdk7 and the different TFIIH subunits interact with RARs remains to be investigated, but it is already clear from this and previous (14.Rochette-Egly C. Adam S. Rossignol M. Egly J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1997; 90: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) studies that the N-terminal A/B region is not mandatory for these interactions. Moreover, the interaction of TFIIH with RARs is not sensitive to deletion of the AF-2AD core/helix 12,3 which is involved in the coactivator binding surface of the ligand binding domain (1.Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2587) Google Scholar). This is in accordance with our observation that the interaction of RARs with cdk7 and TFIIH is ligand-independent. Moreover, it suggests that the interaction between RARs and TFIIH involves another surface and is therefore mechanistically distinct from that described between RARs and coactivators (see the Introduction).Regulation of Transcription by RARγ through Phosphorylation of the AF-1 Domain by TFIIH-associated cdk7To investigate whether phosphorylation of the B region of RARs could modulate the ligand-induced activation of transcription, two reporter genes under the control of different responsive elements and promoters were tested: the natural mRARβ2 promoter, which contains a RARE with directly repeated motifs separated by 5 nucleotides (DR5), and the synthetic (TRE3)3tk promoter, which contains inverted (palindromic) repeated motifs. In both cases, RARγ activated transcription upon ligand binding. However, mutation of the phosphorylation sites located in the A/B region reduced transcription from the mRARβ2 promoter-based reporter gene, whereas it enhanced that from the (TRE3)3tk promoter-based reporter gene. The three-dimensional conformation of bound RXR/RAR heterodimers is most likely different on the two types of response elements. This may result in distinct steric conformations of the AF-1-activating domain and, therefore, in different interactions with putative AF-1 coactivators, which could be differentially modulated by phosphorylation. In this respect we note that interactions between coactivators and the AF-1-activating domain of either the estrogen receptor ERβ or the nuclear receptor SF-1 have been recently shown to be modulated by AF-1 phosphorylation (48.Hammer G.D Krylova I. Zhang Y. Darimont B.D. Simpson K. Weigel N. Ingraham H.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 521-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 49.Tremblay A. Tremblay G.B. Labrie F. Giguere V. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 513-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In any event, such a possibility is in accordance with our previous report showing that phosphorylation of RARγ AF-1 is differentially required for RA-induced expression of target genes in F9 cells (13.Taneja R. Rochette-Egly C. Plassat J.L. Penna L. Gaub M.P. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6452-6465Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Additionally, RAR phosphorylation may modulate the activity of TFIIH-associated cdk7 and/or regulate the enzymatic activity of some TFIIH subunits such as XPB and XPD that possess ATPase and helicase activity (18.Drapkin R.

Cell. 1999; 3: 87-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar).In conclusion, we have demonstrated that, as other transcriptional regulators such as p53 and E2-F (45.Leveillard T. Andera L. Bissonnette N. Schaeffer L. Bracco L. Egly J.M. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1615-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 46.Warbrick E. Curr.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4280-4291Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), RARs are targets for phosphorylation by cdk7 and interact with TFIIH. Thus, phosphorylation by TFIIH may be a general way of modulating the activity of transcriptional regulators. However, our present data also show that another proline-dependent kinase, p44MAPK, can also phosphorylate RARγ in vitro. Even though phosphorylation by this kinase is different from that achieved with cdk7 and overexpression of MAPK in COS cells does not affect the phosphorylation level and the transactivation properties of RARγ, our present data do not rule out the possibility that p44MAPKcould modulate RARγ activity in other cell types upon activation of the growth factor/MAPK cascade, as previously reported for ERα (56.Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki E. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. Metzger D. Chambon P. Science. 1995; 270: 1491-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar). The pleiotropic effects of retinoids are transduced by two nuclear receptor families, the retinoic acid receptors (RARs)1 and the retinoid X receptors (RXRs), that are ligand-dependent transregulators belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily (1.Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2587) Google Scholar, 2.Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P.

Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2818) Google Scholar). RARs are activated by all-trans and 9-cis retinoic acid, whereas RXRs are activated by 9-cis retinoic acid only. There are three RAR (α, β, and γ) and three RXR (α, β, and γ) isotypes, and for each isotype there are at least two main isoforms that differ in their N-terminal region (1.Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2587) Google Scholar, 5.Leid M. Kastner P. Chambon P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 427-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 6.Chambon P. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). As do other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, RARs and RXRs exhibit a conserved modular structure with six variably conserved regions (A to F) (Fig. 1) (1.Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2587) Google Scholar, 5.Leid M. Kastner P. Chambon P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 427-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). The N-terminal A/B region of RARs contains a ligand-independent transcriptional activation function, AF-1 (7.Nagpal S. Saunders M. Kastner P. Durand B. Nakshatri H. Chambon P. Cell. 1992; 70: 1007-1019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 8.Nagpal S. Friant S. Nakshatri H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2349-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Although the B regions of the three RAR isotypes are moderately conserved, their A regions are unrelated and differ for each isoform of a given RAR isotype (5.Leid M. Kastner P. Chambon P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 427-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). The highly conserved C region encompasses the central DNA binding domain. The function of region F, if any, is unknown. Region E is more complex, as it contains the ligand binding domain, a dimerization interface, and the ligand-dependent transcriptional activation/repression domain AF-2 (1.Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2587) Google Scholar, 9.Durand B. Saunders M. Gaudon C. Roy B. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5370-5382Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The activity of AF-2 is entirely dependent on the integrity of a conserved sequence referred to as the AF-2 AD core, located in α-helix 12 at the C-terminal end of the ligand binding domain. Ligand binding induces a major conformational change that includes helix 12 and creates a new surface for coactivator binding while corepressors are released, thus resulting in a transcriptional-competent nuclear receptor relayed to the transcriptional machinery and the chromatin template (1.Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2587) Google Scholar, 10.Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 11.Torchia J.

RARα can be phosphorylated in its AF-1-containing B region by the cyclin-dependent kinase cdk7 (14.Rochette-Egly C. Adam S. Rossignol M. Egly J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1997; 90: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), which together with MAT1 and cyclin H forms the CAK complex that is found either free or as a component of the general transcription/DNA repair factor TFIIH (17.Tirode F.

All-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) modulates PKC activity, but the mechanism of this regulation is unknown. Amino acid alignments and crystal structure analysis of retinoic acid (RA)-binding proteins revealed a putative atRA-binding motif in PKC, suggesting existence of an atRA binding site on the PKC molecule. This was supported by photolabeling studies showing concentration- and UV-dependent photoincorporation of [3H]atRA into PKCα, which was effectively protected by 4-OH-atRA, 9-cis-RA, and atRA glucuronide, but not by retinol. Photoaffinity labeling demonstrated strong competition between atRA and phosphatidylserine (PS) for binding to PKCα, a slight competition with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, and none with diacylglycerol, fatty acids, or Ca2+. At pharmacological concentrations (10 μm), atRA decreased PKCα activity through the competition with PS but not phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, diacylglycerol, or Ca2+. These results let us hypothesize that in vivo, pharmacological concentrations of atRA may hamper binding of PS to PKCα and prevent PKCα activation. Thus, this study provides the first evidence for direct binding of atRA to PKC isozymes and suggests the existence of a general mechanism for regulation of PKC activity during exposure to retinoids, as in retinoid-based cancer therapy.

The PKC family consists of several subfamilies (classic: α, βI, βII, γ; novel: δ, ε, θ, η; atypical: λ, ζ, ι) classified according to their requirements for Ca2+, phospholipids (phosphatidylserine (PS)) and diacylglycerol (DAG) or phorbol esters for activation (1.Nishizuka Y.

The classic and novel PKC isozymes contain an amino-terminal regulatory domain and a carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain (4.Nishizuka Y. Biofactors. 1988; 1: 17-20PubMed Google Scholar). The regulatory domain of classic PKC isozymes contains two common regions, C1 and C2. The C1 domain mediates DAG and phorbol ester binding through distinct low and high affinity binding sites (5.Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar), while the C2 domain mediates Ca2+ and PS binding and contains the receptor for activated C kinase binding site (6.Perin M.S.

PKC requires acidic phospholipids for its activity, and, in the presence of activators, the enzyme has the highest binding affinity for membranes containing PS. Upon activation, PKC isozymes are translocated to distinct subcellular compartments (membranes) and cell structures to phosphorylate their respective substrates (4.Nishizuka Y.

This compartmentalization is required for the phosphorylation of specific substrates and the regulation of different physiological functions (4.Nishizuka Y.

Preventing PKC translocation from the cytoplasm to membranes inhibits PKC function and the subsequent phosphorylation of specific substrates (7.Ron D. Luo J. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol.

PKC isozymes regulate gene expression and a variety of cellular functions, including growth, differentiation, tumor promotion, aging, and apoptosis (1.Nishizuka Y.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar); however, the biological significance of the heterogeneity in the PKC family is not clear. The distinct subcellular distribution, the presence of several isozymes in the same cell, and differential activation or inhibition by different stimuli suggest that each isozyme is involved in the regulation of different functions and has a unique role in the cell (2.Nishizuka Y.

Specifically, retinoids have been implicated in the mechanism of reversion from the malignant to the normal cell phenotype, inhibition of cancer invasiveness, and are currently used to treat various types of cancer, including promyelocytic leukemia, head and neck, skin, breast, and ovarian cancers (19.Bracke M.E.

It has been postulated that retinoids exert some of their effects on cellular differentiation and reversion of malignant phenotype through interactions with PKC isozymes (13.Isakov N.

Pathobiology. 1998; 66: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It has been shown that retinoic acid alters the cellular localization of PKCα, consistent with PKCα inactivation, in endometrial adenocarcinoma cells concurrent with the induction of differentiation of these cells (24.Carter C.A. Parham G.P. Chambers T. Pathobiology. 1998; 66: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Collectively, the data suggest that alterations in PKC activity induced by retinoids are associated with reversion of the malignant phenotype (25.Tonini G. Parodi M. Di Martino D. Varesio L. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 26.Kahl-Ranier P. Marian B. Nutr. Cancer. 1994; 21: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 27.Gruber J.R. Ohno S. Niles R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13356-13360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which retinoic acid regulates PKC is not known. In this work, we have begun the characterization of the biochemical events underlying this regulation. We have previously identified an amino acid motif common to the putative RA binding sites of several RA-utilizing proteins (28.Radominska-Pandya A. Czernik P. Little J.M. Battaglia E. Mackenzie P.I. Drug Metab. Rev. 1999; 31: 817-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The presence of this motif in several PKC isoforms led us to postulate and examine the existence of cellular mechanisms that mediate receptor-independent signaling by retinoids through a direct interaction with various PKC isozymes. We have used photoaffinity labeling to demonstrate that purified, recombinant PKCs bind atRA with high affinity. Using PKC activity assays, we have shown that preincubation of PKCα with micromolar concentrations of atRA decreases PKC activity. Taken together, this is the first evidence for a direct, high affinity binding of atRA to PKCα that results in a decrease in PKCα activity. Given the significance of these in vitro results, we hypothesize that atRA might also be involved in regulating PKCα activity in vivo by competing with PS for binding to PKC molecules. The exact localization of the atRA binding sites is under investigation. Recombinant human PKC isoforms and catalytic subunit were obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). All-trans-retinoic acid (atRA), phosphatidyl-l-serine (PS), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), histone type III, diacylglycerol (DAG, 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol), and arachidonic acid (AA) were from Sigma. [11,12-3H]All-trans-retinoic acid ([3H]atRA) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products, and adenosine 5′-[γ-32P]triphosphate ([γ-32P]ATP) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. NuPAGE 4–12% BisTris gels, sample buffer, and running buffer were from Novex (San Diego, CA). All other reagents were of the highest purity available. Polypeptides for CRABP I (29.Kleywegt G.J.

Senn H. Le Motte P. Gsell B. Shudo K. Jones T.A. Structure. 1994; 2: 1241-1258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and RAR (30.Renaud J.P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar) were selected on the basis of the crystal structures of these proteins with atRA bound. A polypeptide for UGT2B7 was selected according to modeling of a RA binding site in this protein (28.Radominska-Pandya A. Czernik P. Little J.M. Battaglia E. Mackenzie P.I. Drug Metab. Rev. 1999; 31: 817-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Polypeptides for PKC proteins were chosen through a homology comparison to CRABP and RARγ proteins and represent COOH-terminal fragments of their C2 domains. Sequences were aligned using programs resident in the GCG Protein and DNA Analysis Package (31.Genetics Computer Group, Wisconsin Package Version 10 (0), Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WIGoogle Scholar). Direct photoaffinity labeling with [3H]atRA was done using modifications of the method described by Bernstein (32.Bernstein P.S. Choi S.Y. Ho Y.C. Rando R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 654-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For screening of the different PKC isoforms, 7 pmol each of PKCα, βI, βII, γ, δ, ε, and ζ in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7, were incubated for 2 min at room temperature with or without 30 μm atRA. The PKC catalytic subunit was labeled according to the same protocol, except that only 2 pmol of protein was used. [3H]atRA (30 Ci/mmol) was added to a final concentration of 1.5 μm (0.03 nmol, ∼1 μCi, in a final volume of 20 μl). atRA and [3H]atRA were added in ethanol with a final concentration of 2% ethanol in all samples. Samples were incubated for 10 min on ice prior to photolabeling with a handheld long wave (366 nm) UV lamp (UVP-21, Ultraviolet Products, San Gabriel, CA) for 15 min. Proteins were denatured by addition of NuPAGE denaturing buffer (Novex) followed by sonication, boiling for 1 min and, finally, centrifugation at 13,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge (Brinkman Instruments, Westbury, NY). Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a NuPAGE minigel (1.5 mm). Following electrophoresis, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, destained, washed thoroughly with water, treated with Autofluor autoradiography enhancer, (National Diagnostics, Manville, NJ), dried, and subjected to autoradiography at −80 °C for 4–7 days. Results were quantitated by densitometric analysis of the autoradiograms using an AlphaInnotech IS-1000 Digital Imaging System (AlphaInnotech, San Leandro, CA). For more detailed studies with PKCα, photoaffinity labeling was carried out in essentially the same manner using 0.2 μg (2.6 pmol) of protein/sample in a final volume of 10 μl with an ethanol concentration of 5%. Any other modifications are given in the descriptions of specific experiments. PS (2.8 mg) and PMA (final concentration: 100 μm) dissolved in chloroform were transferred to a glass tube. Following evaporation of chloroform under a stream of nitrogen, 1 ml of 3% Triton X-100 (prepared fresh) was added and the mixture was sonicated. PKCα activity was assayed with Triton X-100 mixed micelles, using the phosphorylation of histone 1, as described by Bell et al. (33.Bell R.M. Hannun Y. Loomis C. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 124: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise, the reaction mixture contained 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 20 mmMgCl2, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 0.25 mm EGTA, 0.25 mm EDTA, 0.28 mg/ml PS, 10 μm PMA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.3% Triton X-100, 50 μm histone 1, 20 μm[γ-32P]ATP, and 150 milliunits of PKCα in a final volume of 25 μl. Samples were incubated for 5 min at 30 °C, and reactions were terminated by spotting an aliquot of reaction mixture on phosphocellulose disks (P-81, 2.3 cm, Whatman, Clifton, NJ). After washing the disks with 1% phosphoric acid, γ-32P incorporation into histone 1 was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Non-PKCα-specific activity (background) was determined in samples incubated in the absence of the enzyme. Amino acid alignments and comparison of the crystal structures of several atRA-utilizing proteins, such as CRABP I and II (cytosolic retinoic acid-binding protein I and II), nuclear receptor RARγ and UGT2B7 (the enzyme catalyzing glucuronidation of atRA) with the C2 domain of PKC was carried out as the initial step in the investigation. A motif, previously designated as comprising part of the atRA-binding site, was present in three PKC isozymes examined (α, βI, and γ) (Fig.1). The amino acid distribution among the analyzed sequences revealed three categories of homologous amino acids (Fig. 1): conserved in CRABP and UGT2B7 (yellow blocks), conserved in PKCs and RARγ (green blocks), and those maintained across all the analyzed sequences (red blocks). For the purpose of this alignment, amino acids in hydrophobic set (Leu, Val, Ile, Ala), hydrophilic set (Thr, Ser, Asn), acidic set (Asp, Glu) and basic set (Lys, Arg, His) were considered homologous. The alignment shows a significant homology of amino acids in the C2 domains to amino acids constituting RA binding pockets for CRABPs, RARγ, and that predicted for UGT2B7 (double underlined sequences). Arg-249 of PKCα and PKCγ corresponds to Arg-111 involved in the interaction with the RA carboxyl in CRABPs and Lys-229 of RARγ, involved in electrostatic interaction with the ligand (star). A lysine cluster that constitutes a phosphatidylserine binding site in C2 domains is positioned 35 amino acids upstream from the center of the predicted RA binding site of PKCs. On the basis of the significant sequence homologies among the analyzed sequences, we propose that the amino acids shown on the consensus line might represent all or part of the RA binding pocket of PKCα. The conserved motif in CRABP I contains five amino acids, Arg-111, Leu-120, Phe-122, Arg-131, and Tyr-133, which have been identified from analysis of the crystal structure as being a part of the atRA binding pocket (29.Kleywegt G.J. Bergfors T. Senn H. Le Motte P. Gsell B. Shudo K. Jones T.A. Structure. 1994; 2: 1241-1258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 34.Thompson J.R. Bratt J.M. Banaszak L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Additionally, significant homologies between a PKCα sequence pattern containing the previously defined PS binding site and the predicted atRA binding site (amino acids 172–260) of the C2 domain and the PKCζ C1 domain sequence were not detected. To test our hypothesis of a direct interaction between atRA and PKC, we used direct photoaffinity labeling of PKCα with [11,12-3H]atRA, which covalently modified the PKCα protein within the atRA-binding site and provided the direct evidence for atRA binding to PKC. Because atRA is one of the several common retinoids used experimentally and clinically, it was the retinoid of choice to investigate the direct interaction between retinoids and PKC. The photoaffinity labeling occurred in a concentration-dependent manner, was dependent on UV irradiation, and was effectively protected by unlabeled atRA, atRA glucuronide (atRAG), and various other retinoids (Fig.2). It has been demonstrated here that PKCα exhibits different affinities for various retinoids and that the presence of a carboxyl function on the ligand was an obligatory requirement for binding to PKC. All RA derivatives tested, with the exception of 13-cis-RA, strongly inhibited binding of atRA to PKCα. These results also indicate that atRA derivatives such as 9-cis-RA and atRAG might be functional ligands for PKCα. Thus, our data demonstrate that atRA binds to PKCα through a RA-binding site and that this process is highly specific. To characterize atRA interactions with PKC, we examined the ability of atRA to compete with different PKC activators such as PS, PMA, DAG, and Ca2+ for binding to PKCα. Fig.3 showed that there was a strong competition between PS and atRA for binding to PKCα but only a slight competition between PMA and atRA and no competition between DAG and atRA. These results indicated that atRA does not interact with PKCα through the PMA or DAG binding sites. They also confirmed that atRA binds specifically to PKCα and competes with PS for binding. This is consistent with our hypothesis based on the amino acid analysis shown in Fig. 1 and with a model proposing that PS interacts with PKC within a different domain than DAG and PMA. Calcium had no effect on atRA binding to PKCα in the presence of PS, PMA, or DAG (data not shown), which demonstrates that, although PS and Ca2+binding sites are localized to the same domain (C2) of PKCα, atRA does not interact with PKCα through the Ca2+ binding site (Fig. 3). In order to identify whether other PKC isozymes contain atRA-binding sites, PKCα, βI, βII, γ, δ, ε, and ζ were photolabeled under the same conditions with equimolar concentrations of PKC protein and the ligand. The data presented in Fig.4 show that all PKC isozymes investigated were photolabeled; however, clear differences in the degree of incorporation of label into individual isozymes were observed. Thus, PKCβII had the highest affinity for atRA, while PKCζ had the lowest affinity. The catalytic subunit of PKC was used for photoaffinity labeling to determine other possible sites of atRA binding to the PKC molecule. There was some atRA binding to the catalytic subunit of PKC (∼3% of atRA binding to PKCα). However, this binding was not UV-light dependent nor was it protected by unlabeled atRA (data not shown). These results indicated that there is no specific interaction between atRA and the PKC catalytic subunit and suggested that atRA binding occurs in the regulatory subunit of PKC. However, the efficiency of this binding differs depending on the PKC isoform being used for photolabeling. Direct comparison of the photolabeling of PKCα and PKCζ by atRA and protection by PS and arachidonic acid were also carried out and the data are presented in Fig. 5. PKCζ was photolabeled by atRA with 6-fold lower efficiency than PKCα. Like photolabeling of PKCα, the photolabeling of PKCζ by atRA was light-sensitive and protected by increasing concentrations of unlabeled atRA, which demonstrated that atRA binding to PKCζ is specific. However, in contrast to PKCα, the photolabeling of PKCζ was not protected by preincubation with PS (Fig. 5). Furthermore, there was no competition between arachidonic acid and atRA for binding to PKCα, but the photolabeling of PKCζ by atRA was dramatically diminished by all concentrations of arachidonic acid used in the study (Fig. 5). No effect of PMA on PKCζ photolabeling by atRA was found (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that: 1) the majority of atRA binds to the regulatory subunit of PKC and 2) the major atRA binding site in PKCα may be localized in close proximity to the PS binding site. These results also show that there is no apparent affinity of atRA for the fatty acid binding site of PKCα, presumably localized to the C1 domain. In the case of PKCζ, which lacks the C2 domain and is strongly regulated by fatty acids (35.Kochs G. Hummel R. Meyer D. Hug H. Marme D. Sarre T.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), atRA may bind to the C1 domain either in, or in close proximity to, the fatty acid binding site. Recent site-directed mutagenesis studies from another laboratory carried out on several residues in the C2 domain of PKCα, including the arginine residues, Arg-249 and Arg-252, indicated that all mutants exhibited full membrane binding affinity and enzymatic activity at saturating concentrations of PS, DAG, and Ca2+ (43.Medkova M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17544-17552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These studies also have shown that amino acids Arg-249 and Arg-252 in the C2 domain of PKCα are involved in electrostatic interactions with membrane anionic phospholipids. The two arginines are positioned in the center of our amino acid alignment of proteins that bind RA (Fig. 1), with Arg-249 being highly conserved. Particularly, Arg-249 aligns with Arg-111 of CRABP I and II, which is involved in electrostatic interaction with carboxyl function of RA (29.Kleywegt G.J. Bergfors T. Senn H. Le Motte P. Gsell B.

It is likely that RA may interact with Arg-249 and/or Arg-252 of PKC in a similar fashion and, thus, could be responsible for the interplay between PS and RA demonstrated in our studies. This explanation does not exclude other possible interpretations for RA-mediated modifications of PKC activity, including a RA-induced allosteric effect. The general conclusion from these experiments is that all the PKC isoforms studied directly interact with atRA but the binding of atRA to different isoforms occurs with different affinity. Although the major site of atRA binding in PKCα is postulated to be on the regulatory domain, in PKCζ, the binding occurs in the C1 domain of the regulatory subunit. The exact location and the nature of this binding and its relation to PS and arachidonic acid binding are currently under investigation in our laboratory. Whether the interaction between PKC and RA results in up- or down-regulation of PKC activity clearly depends on the biological system being studied (36.Cope F.O. Staller J.M. Mahsem R.A. Boutwell R.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 37.Ninomiya M. Fujiki H. Paik N.S. Horiuchi T. Boutwell R.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 138: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of atRA binding on PKC catalytic activity, the activity of purified PKCα, the most common PKC isoform, was determined in the presence or absence of atRA and various PKC activators. Pre-incubation of PKCα with PS and PMA, followed by the addition of increasing concentrations of atRA, resulted in a 23% and 61% decrease in PKCα activity in the presence of 50 and 100 μm atRA, respectively (Fig.6; data not shown for 100 μm). At concentrations lower than 50 μm, atRA had no effect if added following pre-incubation with the PS/PMA complex. Simultaneous incubation of PKCα with PS, PMA, and atRA resulted in a slight (20%) decrease in PKCα activity in the presence of 1–10 μm atRA and a 30% decrease in PKCα activity in the presence of 20–50 μm atRA (Fig. 6). In contrast, pre-incubation of PKCα with atRA prior to addition of the PS/PMA complex resulted in a dramatic decrease in PKCα activity (40% and 62% in the presence of 1 and 20 μm atRA, respectively) and total inhibition of the kinase activity at 50 μm atRA (Fig. 6). These results show that: 1) atRA decreases PKCα activity, 2) atRA competes with PS and/or PMA for binding to PKCα, and 3) atRA binds to PKCα with a high affinity and cannot be displaced by an addition of PS and/or PMA. To characterize specific interactions of atRA with individual activators of PKCα, the enzyme was pre-incubated in the presence of 20 μm atRA or the vehicle and the activity measured following addition of increasing concentrations of PS, PMA, DAG, and Ca2+. In the absence of atRA, PKCα activity was stimulated by PS in a concentration-dependent manner and reached a plateau at concentration of 350 μg/ml PS (23-fold stimulation in comparison with PKCα activity in the absence of PS) (Fig. 7). In the presence of atRA, the stimulation of PKCα activity by PS was decreased to 30% of the stimulation in the absence of atRA. These results show that atRA decreases stimulation of PKCα activity by PS and suggest that atRA and PS compete for binding to PKCα. In the absence of atRA, PKCα activity increased gradually in the presence of increasing concentrations of PMA and reached a plateau at a concentration of 1 μm PMA (10-fold stimulation in comparison with PKCα activity in the absence of PMA) (Fig.8 A). atRA decreased the activity of PKCα by 44% in the absence of PMA but did not prevent subsequent stimulation of the PKCα activity by increasing concentrations of PMA (Fig. 8 A). Likewise, atRA decreased PKCα activity in the absence of DAG but did not prevent PKCα stimulation by increasing concentrations of DAG (Fig. 8 B). These results show that atRA does not inhibit the activation of PKCα by PMA or DAG and suggest that atRA does not compete with PMA or DAG for binding. Finally, atRA decreased the overall PKCα activity by 53% in the absence of Ca2+ and the presence of PS and PMA but did not prevent PKCα stimulation by increasing concentrations of Ca2+ (Fig. 9). These results demonstrate that atRA prevents the stimulation of PKCα activity by PS and suggest that atRA alters the interaction of PS with PKCα.Figure 9Effect of Ca2+ concentration on PKC α activity in the presence and absence of atRA. Prior to measurement of PKCα activity, the enzyme was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in the presence of ethanol or 20 μm atRA in ethanol (2% final concentration), followed by 10 min of incubation with mixed micelles containing 0.3% Triton X-100, 10 μm PMA, and 280 μg/ml PS. The reaction was initiated by addition of the substrate, [γ-32P]ATP and increasing concentrations of Ca2+. The results are expressed as mean ± S.E. (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A model for the proposed regulation of PKC by phosphorylation, membrane binding, and activation is well established and has been published previously (8.Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar). In this model, newly synthesized PKC associates with the detergent-insoluble fraction of cells. Three phosphorylation events convert PKC into a mature form that is released into cytosol but is inactive due to the presence of pseudosubstrate in the substrate-binding cavity. PKC translocation to the membrane occurs once DAG binds to the C1 domain and is followed by phospholipid (PS) binding to the C2 domain. Association of DAG with its binding site in the C1 domain and PS with its binding site on the C2 domain leads to pseudosubstrate release and PKC activation. Based on our results, we propose a modification of this existing model, which accounts for the direct interaction between atRA and PKCα in the cell (Fig. 10). The central hypothesis of our model is that atRA binds to PKC at pharmacological concentrations (1.0 μm or higher), a situation that can result from consumption of large amounts of vitamin A or its metabolic precursors or atRA therapy (38.Budd G.T. Adamson P.C. Gupta M. Homayoun P. Sandstrom S.K. Murphy R.F. McLain D. Tuason L. Peereboom G. Ganapathi R.D. Clin. Cancer Res. 1988; 4: 635-642Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, atRA and 13-cis-RA are present in the plasma at nanomolar concentrations (39.De Luca L.M. Darwiche N. Celli G. Kosa K. Jones C. Ross S. Nutr. Rev. 1994; 52: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 40.Athar M. Agrawal R. Wang Z.Y. Lloyd J.R. Vickers D.R. Mukhtar H. Carcinogenesis. 1991; 12: 2325-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and atRA is considered the most prevalent form of vitamin A in most tissues (41.Steele V.E. Kelloff G.J. Wilkinson B.P. Arnold J.T. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 2068-2074PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Shklar G. Schwartz J. Grau D. Trickler D.P. Wallace K.D. Oral Surg. 1980; 50: 45-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We tested our hypothesis by exploring the effect of different atRA concentrations on both atRA binding and PKC activity. The results show that, in an in vitro system, atRA binds to PKC with high affinity at concentrations above 10 μm. Because atRA does not exist in the cell in the free form, we hypothesize that it can react with PKC following binding to CRABP in those cells where PKC and CRABP are both expressed. In preliminary experiments (data not shown) on CRABP and PKC interactions, a significant decrease of CRABP photolabeling by atRA was seen in the presence of PKC, which suggests that there is an interplay between PKC, CRABP and atRA. Experiments are in progress to elucidate the exact mechanism of this interaction and its implications. Previously, it has been shown that apo-CRABP can be phosphorylated by Ca2+- and PS-dependent PKC and that holo-CRABP inhibits PKC activity (36.Cope F.O. Staller J.M. Mahsem R.A. Boutwell R.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 44.Cope F.O. Howard B.D. Boutwell R.K. Experientia (Basel). 1986; 42: 1023-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), which suggests that an interaction between RA-binding proteins and PKC may play a role in the regulation of PKC activity and retinoid action. Our model is restricted to the regulation of PKCα by atRA and is still hypothetical. We propose that atRA interacts with PKC when the atRA concentration in the cell exceeds 1.0 μm(pharmacological). Following atRA entry into the cell and binding to CRABP, the complex can react with PKC. As shown in Fig. 10, the interaction of atRA and PKC may occur: 1) when PKC is associated with the detergent-insoluble fraction of cells, 2) following PKC phosphorylation and release into the cytosol, or 3) when PKC translocates to the membrane domain but prior to PKC binding to phospholipids (PS). With atRA bound to the PKCα molecule, the final activation by PS cannot occur. A similar model for PKCζ is under investigation. Our results show that, in vitro, at concentrations lower than 50 μm, atRA can not displace PS from its binding site (Fig. 6). Therefore, atRA binding to PKCα probably does not occur following PKC translocation to cellular membranes because the binding site is not accessible in this situation. However, once atRA is bound to PKC prior to PKC translocation, the association of PKC with membrane phospholipids and final activation cannot occur. Our examination of the crystal structure of the C2 domain of PKCα showed that a polypeptide of the predicted atRA binding site and a lysine cluster, which constitutes the PS binding site (45.Sutton R.B. Sprang S.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 1395-1405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), appear to form a shared binding pocket (Fig. 11). A 23-amino acid spacer runs between and behind the two sites, bringing them to this common interface. Whether there are other atRA binding sites on the PKC molecule and the specificity of atRA binding to these sites are subjects currently being investigated. Our results from PKC photoaffinity labeling and measurements of catalytic activity of PKCα are consistent and demonstrate: 1) the existence of a specific atRA-binding site on PKC and 2) a direct interaction between atRA and PKCα that decreases PKC activity. The results presented here also suggest that atRA may be involved in the mechanism of regulation of PKC activity in the cell. Previous reports are inconsistent and atRA has been shown to stimulate or inhibit PKC activity depending on the experimental model used (36.Cope F.O. Staller J.M. Mahsem R.A. Boutwell R.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar,44.Cope F.O. Howard B.D. Boutwell R.K.

Cancer Lett. 1986; 30: 275-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) have demonstrated an interaction, similar to that shown here, between RA and PKC in vivo in the mouse brain. The precise mechanism of the PS-atRA interaction, such as allosteric effects and/or steric hindrance to PS binding, resulting in a decrease in enzymatic activity has not been unambiguously determined."

ABC proteins contain a multispanning transmembrane domain(s) and a highly conserved nucleotide binding domain(s) (NBD) (1Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3386) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, ABC transporters participate in the translocation of a variety of molecules across cellular membranes or intracellular organelle membranes. These tasks are divided between full transporters, which consist of two transmembrane domain(s) and two NBDs, and half transporters, which contain one of each domain. In mammalian cells, full transporters are usually found in plasma membranes, which include the multiple drug transporters, P-glycoprotein (2Childs S. Ling V. DeVita V.T. Hellman S. Rosenberg S.A. Impartant Advances in Oncology. 2. J. B. Lippincott Company, Philadelphia, PA1994: 21-36Google Scholar) and MRP (3Cole S.P. Deeley R.G.

Conversely, all half transporters characterized to date are found in subcellular organelles. Half transporters are likely to function either as homodimers or heterodimers. The best-studied examples are TAP1 and TAP2, which form a heteromeric complex for translocating antigenic peptides from the cytoplasm to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to bind major histocompatibility complex class I molecules (5Townsend A. Trowsdale J. Semin. Cell Biol. 1993; 4: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 6Meyer T.H. van Endert P.M. Uebel S. Ehring B. Tampe R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Four half transporters (PMP70, ALDP, PMP69, and ALDR) have been found in peroxisomal membranes (7Kamijo K. Taketani S.

PMP70 and ALDP are linked to the genetic diseases Zellweger syndrome (associated with a peroxisome biogenesis disorder) and adrenoleukodystrophy (associated with an oxidation of very long chain fatty acids defect) (11Gartner J.

Nature. 1993; 361: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). In mitochondria, two half transporters (M-ABC1, ABC7) have been identified (12Hogue D.L. Liu L. Ling V. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Csere P. Lill R. Kispal G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Mutations in the human ABC7 gene are associated with X-linked sideroblastic anemia and ataxia (14Allikmets R. Raskind W.H. Hutchinson A. Schueck N.D. Dean M. Koeller D.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). No ABC transporter has been reported to be localized in mammalian lysosomal membranes; however, an ABC protein, HMT1, has been found in the fission yeast vacuolar membrane, the lysosomal compartment of yeast. It is involved in heavy metal tolerance (15Ortiz D.F. Kreppel L. Speiser D.M. Scheel G. McDonald G. Ow D.W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3491-3499Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Mammalian lysosomes are responsible for the breakdown of cellular components and also serve as a sink for toxins, drugs, and heavy metals. Lysosomes are required to take up a variety of substances from the cytosol and release recycled precursors to the cytosol for macromolecule synthesis. Therefore, transport activities moving a wide range of molecules across lysosomal membranes must occur. Indeed, a number of lysosomal transport processes have been shown to be ATP-dependent, but transporters have not yet been identified. Among these events are translocation of peptides to lysosomes along the pathway for selective degradation of cytosolic proteins under nutritionally depleted conditions (16Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 6-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), heavy metal ion translocation to lysosomes for heavy metal metabolism (17Havelaar A.C. de Gast I.L. Snijders S. Beerens C.E. Mancini G.M. Verheijen F.W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and free oligosaccharide translocation (18Saint-Pol A. Codogno P. Moore S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13547-13555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). ABC proteins, known to transport a wide range of molecules from ions to proteins, are potential candidates for any one of these transport activities. In this report, we describe a novel mammalian ABC transporter that is localized to the lysosomes in transfected cells. We have cloned this gene from both human and mouse, and designated them hABCB9 and mABCB9, respectively (Human ABC gene nomenclature committee). The similarity of ABCB9 to the TAP proteins has recently been noted by Yamaguchi et al. (19Yamaguchi Y. Kasano M. Terada T. Sato R. Maeda M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) when the rat ortholog of ABCB9, TAPL, was isolated. The lysosomal location of the ABCB9 protein has been demonstrated in cells transfected with a full-length hABCB9 cDNA by both immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation. The ABCB9 protein expression has been examined in mouse and rat testis, because ABCB9 mRNA is most highly expressed in this tissue. Using ABCB9-specific antiserum, ABCB9 is located to the cytoplasmic compartment of Sertoli cells in the seminiferous epithelium. These cells play multiple functions in nurturing and supporting germ cells, and they possess numerous lysosomes for phagocytosis. Poly(A)+ RNA from adult brain of C57BL/6J mouse was isolated by using Trizol Reagent and oligo(dT) cellulose columns (Life Technologies, Inc.). Double stranded cDNAs were synthesized with oligo(dT) primer (SuperScript II; Life Technologies, Inc.) and ligated to Lambda Zap II (Stratagene). The Lambda ZapII/cDNA was packaged into bacteriophage particles using the Gigapack III Gold-packaging extract (Stratagene). The cDNA insert of EST clone c-1ch05 (Program Genexpress, Laboratorie Genethon, Evry, France) (GenBank™ accession number F06569) was used as a probe to screen a human acute lymphoblastic leukemia CCRF-CEM cDNA library (12Hogue D.L. Liu L. Ling V. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Two cDNA clones, c1-l and c1-s, were isolated. Manual sequencing was performed using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (U.S. Biochemicals). An additional 44 nucleotides from the 5′-end were obtained using 5′-RACE of poly(A)+ RNA from the CEM cell line using the Marathon cDNA Amplification Kit (CLONTECH) and the ABCB9-specific primers E1-12b (5′-GGATGGGCCTGCGCACCTCT) and E1-7b (5′-CACTCATGAAGGCCAAAG). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). For cloning the mouse ABCB9 cDNA, A 1.3-kilobase (kb) fragment of hABCB9 cDNA (nucleotides (nt) 2152–3512) was used as a probe to screen the mouse brain cDNA library with low stringent hybridization condition. The longest cDNA clone, m1–9, was sequenced by BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction using a Model 310 DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems). DNA sequence was analyzed using GCG program software (Genetics Computer Inc.) and protein analysis using the TopPredII program (20Cloros M. von Heijne G. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 685-686PubMed Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences for the hABCB9 and mABCB9 cDNAs have been deposited in the GenBank™ data base under accession numbers AF216494and AF216495, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis was performed by aligning amino acid sequences of hABCB9 and mABCB9 along with representative ABC transporters using ClustalX (21Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35620) Google Scholar). A neighbor-joining bootstrap tree was generated from the alignment using PAUP*4.0 (22Swofford D.L. PAUP*. Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony (*and Other Methods). Version 4.0b2a. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA1999Google Scholar). The GenBank™ accession numbers for the ABC proteins employed were: TAP1, X57522; MDR1, 4505769; M-ABC1,AF047690; M-ABC2, AF216833; TAPL, AB027520; TAP2, M74447; ABC7,AB005289; UMAT, AJ003004; MDL1, U17246; MDL2, L16959; ATM1, Z49212; and HMT1, AL031546. A32P-labeled 1.3-kb fragment of hABCB9 cDNA (nt 2152–3512) was hybridized to human multiple tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH). A 1.2-kb fragment of mABCB9cDNA (nt 258–1513) was used for hybridization to multiple mouse tissue Northern blot (20 μg of total RNA from designated tissue). The same blot was hybridized to a control probe (a fragment of actin cDNA). The first strand cDNA was randomly primed by using 1 μg of total RNA of designated tissues in 40 μl of reverse transcription (RT) reaction. Different aliquots of RT reaction (as indicated below in Fig.3 C) were amplified by PCR with primers E1-13A (5′-TGGTGTCCAACATCTACGGC), and E1-8B (5′-TCCCTGCATCAGGCCACT) under the cycling procedure: 94 °C for 1 min, then 40 cycles consisting of 94 °C for 10 s, 55 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C for 20 s. The EcoRI fragment of c1-l cDNA, containing the entire coding sequence of ABCB9, was subcloned into the pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) and transfected into the human ovarian SKOV3 cell with Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.). Stably transfected cells (SKOV/ABCB9) were selected with 800 ng/ml Geneticin and maintained with 400 ng/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.) in growth medium. For the bacteria expression vector encoding a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein with the C-terminal 36 amino acids of the human ABCB9 protein (GST/ABC), a pair of primers (5′-TACGGGATCCGGCGGCCTCTACGCCAA-3′,BamHI site underlined and 5′-TACGGAATTCAGGCCTTGTGACTGCC-3′, EcoRI siteunderlined) was used for PCR amplification of the hABCB9 gene. The PCR fragment was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and cloned into the pGEX2T vector to generate pGEX-1C. The GST/ABC fusion protein was expressed in DH5α cells transformed with pGEX-1C and purified according to the method of Frangioni and Neel (23Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). The fusion protein was injected into New Zealand White rabbits. Immune serum was preadsorbed with fixed SKOV3 cells as described in Childs et al. (24Childs S. Yeh R.L. Hui D. Ling V. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4160-4167PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoaffinity purification of the anti-ABCB9 serum was carried out using the methods from Ref .35. The MalE fusion protein containing the C-terminal 36 amino acids of hABCB9 was linked directly to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for the preparation of an antigen column. ABCB9 “positive” and “negative” sera were prepared by adsorbing the anti-ABCB9 serum overnight with either the GST or the GST/ABC protein immobilized on Immobilon-P transfer membranes (Millipore), respectively. Monoclonal antibodies to GPP130 (A1/118) (25Linstedt A.D. Mehta A. Suhan J. Reggio H. Hauri H.P. Mol. Biol.

Polyclonal antiserum to alcohol dehydrogenase was kindly provided by Dr. H. Weiner (Purdue University, West LaFayette, IN). The following antibodies are purchased: monoclonal antibodies to LAMP1 (H4A3) and LAMP2 (H4B4) (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa, Iowa City), monoclonal antibody to Calnexin (AF18;Stressgen), donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), donkey anti-mouse IgG conjugated to lissamine rhodamine (LRSC), and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to biotin (Jackson ImmunoResearch). SKOV3 cells were grown on glass slides to 50% confluence, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 5 mm CaCl2and 10 mm MgCl2 (PBS-MC) for 20 min, and wash with (PBS-MC) three times. The cells were made permeable with 0.1% saponin in PBS-MC with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 10 min. Primary antibodies were applied in PBS-MC with 3% BSA and 0.1% saponin and incubated at 37 °C for 40 min. After three washes (PBS-MC-0.1% saponin), cells were incubated at 37 °C for 40 min with secondary antibodies (LRSC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG) in PBS-MC-3% BSA-0.1% saponin. Cells were rinsed twice with PBS-MC-0.1% saponin, rinsed twice with PBS-MC, and then mounted with fluorescent mounting medium (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). The specimens were examined with a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. Frozen sections of mouse and rat testis were fixed in acetone and stained with the positive or negative serum by using an avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex technique. The sections were incubated sequentially with 3% H2O2:methanol (1:1, v/v) for 30 min, 10% normal goat serum in TBS-T (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween) for 30 min, primary antibody in TBS-T with 1% BSA for 60 min, biotin-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG in TBS-T with 1% BSA for 60 min, and streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in TBS-T with 1% BSA for 70 min. The binding of antibody to tissues was detected by 6-min incubation with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (Sigma) and H2O2(0.00015%). Tissues were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted in Crystal/Mount (Biomeda Corp.) All procedures were performed at 4 °C. Total membranes from cultured cells were prepared by resuspending cell pellets in ST buffer (250 mm sucrose, 5 mm Tris, pH 8, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1% aprotinin). Suspended cells were Dounce-homogenized (30 strokes) with B pestle and then centrifuged at 4500 × g for 10 min to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. Total membrane fractions were collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g (60 min). The metrizamide (Mz) (Accurate Chemical Co.) step gradients were performed according to the method by Storrie and Madden (26Storrie B. Madden E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 203-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, monolayer cells (108) were harvested according to the manufacturer's instructions (Application Sheet 3.2: “homogenization of mammalian cultured cells”; Nycomed Pharma Co., Life Technologies, Inc.). Cell suspensions were Dounce-homogenized for 15 strokes with B pestle and centrifuged at 1300 × g for 10 min. Supernatants (PNS or Fraction I) were overlaid on top of the first gradient (6% Percoll (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)/17% Mz/35% Mz) and centrifuged at 50,500 ×g for 40 min. Bands at the PNS/6% Percoll interface (Fraction II), the 6% Percoll/17% Mz interface (Fraction III), and the 17% Mz/35% Mz interface (Fraction IV) were collected. Fraction III was then mixed with Mz to 35% and then applied to the bottom of the layer gradient (5% Mz/17% Mz/35% Mz). After centrifugation at 50,500 × g (40 min), bands at the 5% Mz/17% Mz interface (Fraction V) and the 17% Mz/35% Mz interface (Fraction VI) were collected. Protein concentration of each fraction was determined by protein assay (Bio-Rad). 275 μl of Fraction V was mixed with 11 ml of 19.25% Percoll in 250 mm sucrose, 10 mmHepes, pH 7.4, and 0.2 mm EDTA (final Percoll 18.8%), layered on top of a 1-ml cushion of 2.5 m sucrose, and centrifuged in a Type 65 rotor for 60 min at 28,000 ×g. 0.5-ml fractions were collected from the bottom of the gradient. Proteins separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) were transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore), and Western analysis was visualized with ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). We initially identified the EST clone c-1ch05 (GenBank™ accession number F06569) as a human ABC gene (ABCB9) by using the BLASTN program (27Altschul S.F. Boguski M.S. Gish W. Wootton J.C. Nat. Genet. 1994; 6: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar) to search the dbEST data base with the conserved NBDs of the known ABC transporters as query sequences. This gene was of interest, because it exhibited a restricted high expression pattern to testis and brain by Northern blot analysis. An EST clone corresponding to the same gene was mapped to chromosome 12q24 by Allikmets et al. (28Allikmets R. Gerrard B. Hutchinson A. Dean M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1649-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) as part of an investigation to classify 33 human ABC transporters; however, no further characterization of this gene was undertaken. To study the function of ABCB9, we proceeded to clone a full-length cDNA of this gene. Using the cDNA insert of the EST clone c-1ch05 as a probe to screen a human T-lymphoblast CEM cell line cDNA library, we isolated two independent cDNA clones, c1-l and c1-s. Clone c1-l consists of 3468 base pairs (bp), and an additional 44 nucleotides at the 5′-end were obtained by 5′-RACE. The full-length cDNA of hABCB9 is thus 3512 bp consisting of 298 bp of a 5′-untranslated region, an open reading frame of 2298 bp coding for 766 amino acids, and 916 bp of a 3′-untranslated region. As shown in Fig.1 A, the predicted protein sequence reveals that hABCB9 contains structural motifs of a half ABC transporter with a single NBD in its C-terminal region. Hydropathy analysis using the Eisenberg algorithm of the TopPredII program (20Cloros M. von Heijne G. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 685-686PubMed Google Scholar) suggests the presence of 10 potential transmembrane segments in the N-terminal portion of the molecule. A 3325-bp cDNA clone of the mouse homologue of hABCB9 (mABCB9) encoding a 762-amino acid protein was also isolated from a mouse brain cDNA library. Fig. 1 A shows an amino acid sequence alignment of the human, mouse, and rat (TAPL) ABCB9 genes. The similarity between mouse and rat sequences is 99% of the amino acid identity (Table I). The percentage of amino acid identity between human and rodent is 94%, with the major differences clustered in the predicted cytoplasmic domain between the transmembrane segment 4 (TM 4) and TM 5, and the C-terminal end.Table IPercentage of amino acid identity and similarity between the ABCB9 orthologs and the closest related proteins, TAPs (similarity/identity), using the GAP program in GCG and standard parameter settingshABCB9, humanmABCB9, mouseTAPL, ratTAP1, humanTAP2, human%hABCB9100 /100mABCB995.3 /94.0100 /100TAPL95.4 /94.199.2 /99.2100 /100TAP148.0 /38.047.7 /38.247.8 /38.3100 /100TAP248.3 /40.146.9 /38.247.0 /38.446.2 /38.7100 /100 Open table in a new tab Phylogenetic analysis of ABCB9 with known ABC transporter proteins was performed using the alignment program ClustalX (21Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35620) Google Scholar) and the tree-generating program PAUP*4.0 (22Swofford D.L. PAUP*. Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony (*and Other Methods). Version 4.0b2a. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA1999Google Scholar). A neighbor-joining analysis showed that ABCB9 falls into the same cluster as the P-glycoprotein and TAP proteins. Within this cluster, ABCB9 appeared to be closely related to TAP1 and TAP2, which are two ABC proteins found in ER (Fig.2). Alignment of the three proteins using the GAP program (Wisconsin GCG package) indicated an identity of hABCB9 to TAP 1 and TAP2 of 38% and 40%, respectively (Table I). The identity between the two TAP proteins was 39%. A shorter cDNA clone of hABCB9 (c1-s) was isolated that had the same sequence as c1-l, except for four internal deletions of 2 bp (from nt 1350 to 1351 and from nt 1902 to 1903), 14 bp (nt1015–1028), and 129 bp (nt1550–1688). Among those, only the 129-bp deletion is in-frame. To determine whether these “deletions” were present in native mRNA or were cloning artifacts, we performed RT-PCR amplification of RNA from CEM cells, the same cell line from which the cDNA clone was isolated. A series of primers were chosen such that each PCR product would include the 129-bp deletion and one or two of the small deletions in c1-s cDNA. Two bands corresponding to c1-s and c1-l were detected from all PCR reactions. The c1-s bands were subcloned for sequence analysis, which showed that the 129-bp, in-frame deletion was found among all PCR clones examined, whereas none of the three small frameshift deletions were found. We concluded that the three frameshift deletions seen in c1-s were cloning artifacts, whereas the 129-bp deletion exists as an isoform of hABCB9 mRNA. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA indicates that there is only one copy of the hABCB9 gene in the human genome (data not shown); therefore, these two forms of mRNA are likely to be derived by alternative splicing. It is known that intron/exon boundaries are often conserved among closely related members in a gene family. Because the genomic structure of the hABCB9 locus is unknown, we checked the genomic arrangement of the two half ABC transporters, TAP1 and TAP2 (NCBI accession numbers X66401 and S57528). Fig. 1 B displays a portion of the aligned amino acid sequence of these three proteins and indicates that the 129-bp deletion in hABCB9 corresponds to exon 6 of both TAP1 and TAP2. This finding strongly suggests that the short form of hABCB9 mRNA is a splice variant that has skipped one exon. This presumptive 129-bp exon encodes 43 amino acids encompassing the last hydrophobic region (predicted TM9 and TM10) before the ATP binding domain (see Fig. 1 A). This region corresponds to TMs of P-glycoprotein that are involved in drug binding (29Greenberger L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11417-11425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The splice variant protein may be speculated to have a substrate specificity different from that of the regular hABCB9. We further examined the existence of this mRNA splice variant in normal tissues by RT-PCR amplification of RNA from human testis and brain, because hABCB9 is expressed relatively highly in these two tissues (Fig. 3 A). A pair of primers, flanking the 129-bp deletion region in c1-s, is expected to generate RT-PCR products of 266 and 395 bp from mRNAs corresponding to the cDNA clones c1-s and c1–l, respectively. RT-PCR products from testis and brain showed two bands of the expected sizes, with the c1-l band being more prominent (Fig. 3 C). The c1-s band appears to be less abundant in testis than in brain. These data indicate that the c1-l and c1-s forms of hABCB9 mRNA are coexpressed in both human brain and testis. However, the ratio of these two forms are different. The expression patterns of ABCB9 in a panel of normal adult human tissues was investigated by Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig.3 A, most tissues examined appeared to express low levels of hABCB9, however, relatively high expression was found in the testis, and moderate expression was found in brain, spinal cord, and thyroid. In addition to the expected band (about 3.7 kb), an additional 2.2-kb band was also detected in the tissues in which hABCB9 are highly expressed. The probe used for this Northern blot contains a 1.3-kb hABCB9 sequence at the 3′-end; therefore, the 2.2-kb band likely presents a specific degradation product or another splice variant. ABCB9 mRNA expression patterns in mouse tissues were similar to human: high expression was found in mouse testis, and moderate expression was found in brain and in spinal cord. It should be noted that, unlike the human blot where poly(A)+ RNA was used, total RNA was used in the mouse blot (Fig. 3 B). Therefore, it is possible that a lower level of expression of mABCB9 in other mouse tissues may not be detected due to the relative insensitivity of the assay. To facilitate the study of potential ABCB9 functions, hABCB9 cDNA was subcloned into an expression vector and stably transfected into a human ovarian carcinoma cell line SKOV3. The expression of hABCB9 in transfected cells (SKOV/ABCB9) was examined by Western blot using polyclonal antiserum against a GST fusion protein containing the C-terminal 36 amino acids of hABCB9. A prominent band of approximately 72 kDa was detected using the ABCB9-specific antibody (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2and 3), which is significantly smaller than the predicted molecular mass of hABCB9 (84.5 kDa). A similar discrepancy has also been reported previously in the E. coli half ABC transporter hemolysin B, a protein with a 79.9-kDa predicted molecular mass but 66 kDa as measured by SDS-PAGE (30Juranka P. Zhang F. Kulpa J. Endicott J. Blight M. Holland I.B. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3764-3770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These differences may be due to either the aberrant behavior of highly hydrophobic proteins on SDS gels or post-translational modification. Using antisera preadsorbed with either GST-ABCB9 fusion protein (GST/ABC) or GST alone, an identical experiment was performed to confirm the specificity of the antibody. Treatment with GST/ABC but not with GST alone abolished the detection of the 72-kDa band (Fig.4 A). A faint band of approximately 72 kDa was also observed in the control cells, but that band was not abolished with GST/ABC-treated antiserum and therefore was not hABCB9. Five N-glycosylation sequence motifs were found in ABCB9 protein (Fig. 1 A). To determine whether hABCB9 containedN-linked oligosaccharides, a membrane preparation was digested with N-glycosidase F prior to Western blot analysis. This treatment did not change the mobility of the detected band, indicating that hABCB9 was not N-glycosylated (Fig. 4 B). If the predicted topological structure of ABCB9 is such that the NBD is in the cytoplasmic compartment, then all the N-glycosylation site would be in the predicted cytoplasmic loops and unlikely to be used. Our results appear to confirm this prediction. It is not known whether ABCB9 is able to function alone as a homodimer or needs to form a complex with another half ABC transporter. It has been demonstrated recently that transfection of a half ABC transporter, BCRP, alone was able to render cells resistant to a number of drugs (31Doyle L.A. Yang W. Abruzzo L.V. Krogmann T. Gao Y. Rishi A.K. Ross D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15665-15670Crossref PubMed Scopus (2002) Google Scholar). To determine whether ABCB9 overexpression may give rise to drug resistance, an hABCB9 high expression clone, an intermediate expression clone, and the control cells (vector-transfected cells) were exposed to the compounds colchicine, vinblastine, taxol,"

A number of experimental findings have led to the conclusion that many proteins can attain their native structure co-translationally. The most direct evidence in favor of co-translational folding was the demonstration that proteins can display their enzymatic activity immediately upon the release from the ribosome, with no delay for posttranslational folding (1.Kolb V.A.

It was shown in some cases that a growing polypeptide was able to interact with free subunits of this multimeric protein, forming ribosome-associated oligomers (8.Gilmore R. Coffey M.C. Leone G.

Several proteins were shown to bind their specific ligands or cofactors while bound to the ribosome as growing polypeptides (5.Chen W. Helenius J. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Finally, it was demonstrated that under certain conditions, proteins could attain their enzymatic activity while still attached to the ribosome (14.Kolb V.A. Makeyev E.V. Kommer A. Spirin A.S. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 1217-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 15.Kudlicki W. Chirgwin J. Kramer G. Hardesty B.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).Recently, a hypothesis has been put forward according to which a shift from posttranslational to co-translational folding mechanisms has occurred during evolution (3.Netzer W.J. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1997; 388: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). It was hypothesized that the ability to support co-translational folding either has been lost (or reduced) by prokaryotes or has been acquired by eukaryotes. In the present study, the question has been raised of whether a multidomain eukaryotic protein is capable of co-translational folding in a prokaryotic translation system (on prokaryotic ribosomes). In order to approach the problem, we examined the kinetics of folding of a multidomain protein,Photinus pyralis luciferase, during its synthesis in a bacterial cell-free translation system. The activity of newly synthesized luciferase can be recorded continuously, which allows us to detect the active (i.e. properly folded) molecules as soon as they are formed in the cytosol (1.Kolb V.A. Makeyev E.V. Spirin A.S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3631-3637Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The same experimental strategy as was used earlier (1.Kolb V.A. Makeyev E.V. Spirin A.S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3631-3637Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 17.Fedorov A.N. Baldwin T.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1227-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) was applied in this study to measure the delay between the arrest of the synthesis and the cessation of the enzyme activity accumulation. This approach allows to estimate the time interval in which a full-length polypeptide released from the ribosome attains its native three-dimensional structure. We have found that the arrest of luciferase synthesis causes immediate cessation of active enzyme accumulation, thus suggesting that the enzyme acquires its native structure immediately upon release from the ribosome, without any delay for posttranslational folding. This result indicates the co-translational mode of luciferase folding in the prokaryotic cytosol, just the same as reported for this protein when it was synthesized in a eukaryotic translation system (1.Kolb V.A. Makeyev E.V. Spirin A.S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3631-3637Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 2.Frydman J. Nimmesgern E. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1994; 370: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThe main result of the experiments reported here is the demonstration of co-translational mode of folding of a multidomain eukaryotic protein in the prokaryotic cytosol. The most significant argument against co-translational folding of proteins in prokaryotes (3.Netzer W.J. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1997; 388: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) is the higher speed of bacterial translation relative to eukaryotic one. It could be thought that folding events would not be able to keep pace with the fast polymerization of polypeptide chain, leaving only the posttranslational way for the chain to be folded. Whereas the synthesis of the full-length firefly luciferase in eukaryotic cytosol takes from 15 to 18 min (1.Kolb V.A. Makeyev E.V. Spirin A.S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3631-3637Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 2.Frydman J. Nimmesgern E. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1994; 370: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar), the enzyme appears in prokaryotic cell-free translation system in 8 min. Thus, the synthesis of enzymatically active luciferase in prokaryotic cytosol occurs much earlier than the half-time of in vitro refolding of denatured enzyme under identical conditions. The low yield of active luciferase in the refolding process when it takes place in prokaryotic cytosol also suggests a co-translational, rather than posttranslational, mechanism of the active enzyme formation.There are a number of reports also suggesting the co-translational mechanism of folding in prokaryotes. The classical example is β-galactosidase, which forms enzymatically active tetramer with participation of one subunit bound to the prokaryotic ribosome (9.Kiho Y. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 51: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 10.Zipser D. Perrin D. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1963; 28: 533-537Crossref Google Scholar). The possibility was not excluded, however, that binding of free subunits could induce the native (or competent to binding) conformation of the nascent one. Later, the experiments on immunological activity of ribosome-bound growing β-galactosidase demonstrated binding of conformationdependent anti-β-galactosidase antibodies to growing polypeptide chains well before the appearance of active enzyme, at very early times after induction of the enzyme synthesis in cells (22.Hamlin J. Zabin I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 412-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The result proved that the growing chains of β-galactosidase begin to fold before their release from the ribosome, i.e.co-translationally.The contribution of co-translational folding to the formation of β-subunit of bacterial luciferase in homologous translation system was clearly shown, although the formation of enzymatically active heterodimer was achieved posttranslationally (17.Fedorov A.N. Baldwin T.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1227-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).Generation of proper S-S bridges in single-chain antibodies during the synthesis in a bacterial cell-free system (23.Ryabova L.A. Desplancq D. Spirin A.S. Plückthun A. Nature Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), as well as their ability to display ligand- or antigen-binding features in the ribosome-bound state (24.Hanes J. Plückthun A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4937-4942Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar) also indicated the capacity for co-translational folding in prokaryotes, although the more direct kinetics studies and the demonstration of correct S-S bridges formation in nascent single-chain antibodies are necessary to prove co-translational mechanism of protein folding in bacteria. The acquisition of enzymatic activity by bovine rhodanese bound to the prokaryotic ribosome as a peptidyl-tRNA (15.Kudlicki W. Chirgwin J. Kramer G. Hardesty B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14284-14287Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) is also in line with the above results.The results presented here are the first and the most direct evidence in favor of co-translational folding of a protein in a prokaryotic system, generally, and folding of a eukaryotic multidomain protein on prokaryotic ribosomes, specifically. These findings cast doubt on the idea that the co-translational folding was acquired by eukaryotes during evolution (3.Netzer W.J. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1997; 388: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Instead, one can believe that the co-translational mode of folding is the most ancient and universal way of protein structure formation, whereas the posttranslational folding mechanisms involving chaperones arose as intracellular differentiation and transport systems were evolved. The co-translational mechanism of protein folding implies that the N-terminal part of a growing polypeptide starts its folding as soon as it has been synthesized, prior to the completion of entire polypeptide chain by the ribosome. A number of experimental findings have led to the conclusion that many proteins can attain their native structure co-translationally. The most direct evidence in favor of co-translational folding was the demonstration that proteins can display their enzymatic activity immediately upon the release from the ribosome, with no delay for posttranslational folding (1.Kolb V.A.

It was shown in some cases that a growing polypeptide was able to interact with free subunits of this multimeric protein, forming ribosome-associated oligomers (8.Gilmore R. Coffey M.C. Leone G.

Several proteins were shown to bind their specific ligands or cofactors while bound to the ribosome as growing polypeptides (5.Chen W. Helenius J. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Finally, it was demonstrated that under certain conditions, proteins could attain their enzymatic activity while still attached to the ribosome (14.Kolb V.A. Makeyev E.V. Kommer A. Spirin A.S. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 1217-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 15.Kudlicki W. Chirgwin J. Kramer G. Hardesty B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14284-14287Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 16.Makeyev E.V. Kolb V.A. Spirin A.S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Recently, a hypothesis has been put forward according to which a shift from posttranslational to co-translational folding mechanisms has occurred during evolution (3.Netzer W.J. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1997; 388: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). It was hypothesized that the ability to support co-translational folding either has been lost (or reduced) by prokaryotes or has been acquired by eukaryotes. In the present study, the question has been raised of whether a multidomain eukaryotic protein is capable of co-translational folding in a prokaryotic translation system (on prokaryotic ribosomes). In order to approach the problem, we examined the kinetics of folding of a multidomain protein,Photinus pyralis luciferase, during its synthesis in a bacterial cell-free translation system. The activity of newly synthesized luciferase can be recorded continuously, which allows us to detect the active (i.e. properly folded) molecules as soon as they are formed in the cytosol (1.Kolb V.A. Makeyev E.V. Spirin A.S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3631-3637Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The same experimental strategy as was used earlier (1.Kolb V.A. Makeyev E.V. Spirin A.S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3631-3637Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 17.Fedorov A.N. Baldwin T.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1227-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) was applied in this study to measure the delay between the arrest of the synthesis and the cessation of the enzyme activity accumulation. This approach allows to estimate the time interval in which a full-length polypeptide released from the ribosome attains its native three-dimensional structure. We have found that the arrest of luciferase synthesis causes immediate cessation of active enzyme accumulation, thus suggesting that the enzyme acquires its native structure immediately upon release from the ribosome, without any delay for posttranslational folding. This result indicates the co-translational mode of luciferase folding in the prokaryotic cytosol, just the same as reported for this protein when it was synthesized in a eukaryotic translation system (1.Kolb V.A. Makeyev E.V. Spirin A.S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3631-3637Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 2.Frydman J. Nimmesgern E. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1994; 370: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). DISCUSSIONThe main result of the experiments reported here is the demonstration of co-translational mode of folding of a multidomain eukaryotic protein in the prokaryotic cytosol. The most significant argument against co-translational folding of proteins in prokaryotes (3.Netzer W.J. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1997; 388: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) is the higher speed of bacterial translation relative to eukaryotic one. It could be thought that folding events would not be able to keep pace with the fast polymerization of polypeptide chain, leaving only the posttranslational way for the chain to be folded. Whereas the synthesis of the full-length firefly luciferase in eukaryotic cytosol takes from 15 to 18 min (1.Kolb V.A. Makeyev E.V. Spirin A.S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3631-3637Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 2.Frydman J. Nimmesgern E. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1994; 370: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar), the enzyme appears in prokaryotic cell-free translation system in 8 min. Thus, the synthesis of enzymatically active luciferase in prokaryotic cytosol occurs much earlier than the half-time of in vitro refolding of denatured enzyme under identical conditions. The low yield of active luciferase in the refolding process when it takes place in prokaryotic cytosol also suggests a co-translational, rather than posttranslational, mechanism of the active enzyme formation.There are a number of reports also suggesting the co-translational mechanism of folding in prokaryotes. The classical example is β-galactosidase, which forms enzymatically active tetramer with participation of one subunit bound to the prokaryotic ribosome (9.Kiho Y. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 51: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 10.Zipser D. Perrin D. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1963; 28: 533-537Crossref Google Scholar). The possibility was not excluded, however, that binding of free subunits could induce the native (or competent to binding) conformation of the nascent one. Later, the experiments on immunological activity of ribosome-bound growing β-galactosidase demonstrated binding of conformationdependent anti-β-galactosidase antibodies to growing polypeptide chains well before the appearance of active enzyme, at very early times after induction of the enzyme synthesis in cells (22.Hamlin J. Zabin I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 412-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The result proved that the growing chains of β-galactosidase begin to fold before their release from the ribosome, i.e.co-translationally.The contribution of co-translational folding to the formation of β-subunit of bacterial luciferase in homologous translation system was clearly shown, although the formation of enzymatically active heterodimer was achieved posttranslationally (17.Fedorov A.N. Baldwin T.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1227-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).Generation of proper S-S bridges in single-chain antibodies during the synthesis in a bacterial cell-free system (23.Ryabova L.A. Desplancq D. Spirin A.S. Plückthun A. Nature Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), as well as their ability to display ligand- or antigen-binding features in the ribosome-bound state (24.Hanes J. Plückthun A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4937-4942Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar) also indicated the capacity for co-translational folding in prokaryotes, although the more direct kinetics studies and the demonstration of correct S-S bridges formation in nascent single-chain antibodies are necessary to prove co-translational mechanism of protein folding in bacteria. The acquisition of enzymatic activity by bovine rhodanese bound to the prokaryotic ribosome as a peptidyl-tRNA (15.Kudlicki W. Chirgwin J. Kramer G. Hardesty B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14284-14287Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) is also in line with the above results.The results presented here are the first and the most direct evidence in favor of co-translational folding of a protein in a prokaryotic system, generally, and folding of a eukaryotic multidomain protein on prokaryotic ribosomes, specifically. These findings cast doubt on the idea that the co-translational folding was acquired by eukaryotes during evolution (3.Netzer W.J. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1997; 388: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Instead, one can believe that the co-translational mode of folding is the most ancient and universal way of protein structure formation, whereas the posttranslational folding mechanisms involving chaperones arose as intracellular differentiation and transport systems were evolved.

We show that some NCR-sensitive genes (CAN1,DAL5, DUR1,2, and DUR3) produce two transcripts of slightly different sizes. Synthesis of the shorter transcript is NCR-sensitive and that of the longer transcript is not. The longer transcript also predominates in gln3Δ mutants irrespective of the nitrogen source provided. We demonstrate that the longer mRNA species arises through the use of an alternative transcription start site generated by Gln3p-binding sites (GATAAs) being able to act as surrogate TATA elements. The ability of GATAAs to serve as surrogate TATAs, i.e. when synthesis of the shorter, NCR-sensitive transcripts are inhibited, correlates with sequestration of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-Gln3p in the cytoplasm in a way that is indistinguishable from that seen with EGFP-Ure2p. However, when the shorter, NCR-sensitive DAL5transcript predominates, EGFP-Gln3p is nuclear. These data suggest that the mechanism underlying NCR involves the cytoplasmic association of Ure2p with Gln3p, an interaction that prevents Gln3p from reaching it is binding sites upstream of NCR-sensitive genes.

This “biosynthetic” permease is encoded byARGP/CAN1 (1.Grenson M. Mousset M. Wiame J.M. Bechet J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 127: 325-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Kinetic characterization of arginine transport by Can1p was conducted in ammonia-grown cells (1.Grenson M. Mousset M. Wiame J.M. Bechet J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 127: 325-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). That Can1p is produced and functions in ammonia medium distinguished it from the high K m, “catabolic” general amino permease (GAP1) that transports a variety of amino acids (2.Grenson M. Hou C. Crabeel M. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 103: 770-777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gap1p is produced only in medium containing a poor nitrogen source (2.Grenson M. Hou C. Crabeel M. J.

These early studies gave rise to the accepted notion thatCAN1 expression was insensitive to nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR).1NCR is the physiological process by which good nitrogen sources (glutamine, asparagine, and ammonia) are used in preference to poor ones (proline, allantoin, γ-aminobutyrate, and glutamate) (3.Cooper T.G.

The observation that antibody against a fusion protein containing the Gln3p GATA-zinc finger could immunoprecipitate a Ure2p sized protein, when both proteins were overproduced, suggested that Ure2p regulation of Gln3p involved formation of a Gln3p-Ure2p complex (13.Blinder D. Coschigano P. Magasanik B. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4734-4736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A similar mechanism was hypothesized, although not demonstrated, for Ure2p regulation of Gat1p.A paradox concerning Can1p synthesis began to emerge in a study of the role played by Can1p in the NCR sensitivity of arginine-inducedCAR1 (arginase) expression (14.Cooper T.G. Kovari L. Sumrada R.A. Park H.-D. Luche R.M. Kovari I. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 174: 48-55Crossref Google Scholar). The critical observation was that heterologous overproduction of Can1p (driven by theADH1 promoter) resulted in arginine-induced CAR1expression becoming insensitive to NCR (14.Cooper T.G. Kovari L. Sumrada R.A. Park H.-D. Luche R.M. Kovari I. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 174: 48-55Crossref Google Scholar). This result suggested that a portion of NCR sensitivity of CAR1 expression was derived from NCR-sensitive inducer exclusion (14.Cooper T.G. Kovari L. Sumrada R.A. Park H.-D. Luche R.M. Kovari I. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 174: 48-55Crossref Google Scholar). NCR-sensitiveCAN1 expression was subsequently demonstrated by Northern blot analysis (15.Daugherty J.R. Rai R. ElBerry H.M. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 64-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The paradox arises in trying to rectify that the original characterization of Argp/Can1p was performed under conditions of strong NCR with the observation that CAN1 expression is highly NCR-sensitive.The present work provides a potential explanation of this paradox. Two mRNA species are transcribed from CAN1. One species is Gln3p-dependent and NCR-sensitive, and a second, slightly longer species, is present only under opposite conditions,i.e. strong NCR or deletion of GLN3. The longer mRNA is much less abundant than the shorter one. Similar profiles are also observed with DAL5, DUR1,2, andDUR3. We find that the CAN1 GATA sequences are available, in gln3Δ mutants and during growth with glutamine as nitrogen source, to serve as surrogate TATA elements. Utilization of an upstream start site accounts for the increased size of the NCR-insensitive transcript. Finally, EGFP-Gln3p is nuclear during times of Gln3p-dependent gene expression. When that expression is inhibited, EGRP-Gln3p is localized to the cytoplasm. This may account for the exposure of GATA sequences and their availability to serve as surrogate TATA elements when the function of Gln3p is inhibited or its cognate gene is deleted.DISCUSSIONWe have shown that CAN1 expression generates two transcripts as follows: (i) a rapidly migrating species with a profile characteristic of NCR-sensitive, Gln3p-dependent expression, and (ii) a less rapidly migrating species whose profile is just the opposite, present only when RNA is prepared from wild type cells cultured in glutamine medium or in gln3Δ andgln3Δgat1Δ mutants. The requirement of the clusteredCAN1 GATAA or TATAA sequences for the upper species to appear suggests that these GATA sequences can serve as surrogate TATAA elements under repressive growth conditions or when GLN3 is deleted. Similar functioning of GATAA sequences as surrogate TATA elements has been reported for higher eucaryotic cells (26.Singer V.L. Wobbe C.R. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 636-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 27.Fong T.C. Emerson B.M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 28.Aird W.C. Parvin J.D. Sharp P.A. Rosenberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 269: 883-889Google Scholar). The presence of “variant TATAs” (GATAAs) situated upstream of the normalCAN1 TATAA can account for the production of the longerCAN1 mRNA species we observed earlier (15.Daugherty J.R. Rai R. ElBerry H.M. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 64-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Coffman J.A. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6910-6918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our EGFP-Gln3p and EGFP-Ure2p experiments correlate the localization of Gln3p with its ability to support transcription. When Gln3p-mediated transcription is high, Gln3p is localized to the nucleus, and when transcription is minimal, Gln3p is cytoplasmic. The nearly identical intracellular localization of EGFP-Gln3p in a cell overproducing Ure2p and EGFP-Ure2p is consistent with the formation of a Ure2p-Gln3p complex as suggested earlier (13.Blinder D. Coschigano P. Magasanik B. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4734-4736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When these correlations are considered in light of experiments showing that the extent of NCR-sensitive transcription depends upon the relative levels of GATA factor and Ure2p production (39.Cunningham T.S. Andhare R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14408-14414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), they argue that NCR is imposed by Gln3p complexing with Ure2p which prevents it from reaching its target GATAA-binding sites in the nucleus.During the preparation of this manuscript, four reports of experiments investigating the role played by TOR proteins in starvation appeared simultaneously and reached conclusions more or less similar to one another and to ours (30.Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 31.Cardenas M.E. Cutler N.S. Lorenz M. Di Como C.J. Heitman J.

The most detailed experiments were those of Hall and collaborators (30.Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar) which led them to conclude that when cells grown in rich medium are treated with the immunosuppressant drug, rapamycin, Gln3p is dephosphorylated in a Sit4p-dependent manner and enters the nucleus. In rich medium, Gln3p is predominantly cytoplasmic. An earlier report by Edskes et al. (34.Edskes H.K. Hanover J.A. Wickner R.B.

Therefore, regulation of NCR-sensitive transcription can be anticipated to share characteristics of the cytoplasmic-nuclear trafficking that regulates operation of the PHO and stress-sensitive transcription factors (35.Oshima Y. Genes Genet. Syst. 1997; 72: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 36.Gorner W. Durchschlag E. Martinez-Pastor M.T. Estruch F. Ammerer G. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Schuller C.

However, much remains to be done before all of the existing (and sometimes conflicting) data can be rectified, and a complete, cohesive picture of NCR-sensitive transcription and its relation to nitrogen starvation is understood. In this regard, it is pertinent to note that although some effects of nitrogen starvation are similar to those observed in relief of NCR, the two processes have been shown to be quite distinct (38.Beeser A.E. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2472-2476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it would be surprising if the nitrogen starvation and NCR control pathways are found to be identical. Arginine transport into Saccharomyces cerevisiae is mediated by several permeases; one is the low K m (10 μm) basic amino acid permease responsible for arginine uptake at low external concentrations. This “biosynthetic” permease is encoded byARGP/CAN1 (1.Grenson M. Mousset M. Wiame J.M. Bechet J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 127: 325-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Kinetic characterization of arginine transport by Can1p was conducted in ammonia-grown cells (1.Grenson M. Mousset M. Wiame J.M. Bechet J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 127: 325-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). That Can1p is produced and functions in ammonia medium distinguished it from the high K m, “catabolic” general amino permease (GAP1) that transports a variety of amino acids (2.Grenson M. Hou C. Crabeel M. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 103: 770-777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gap1p is produced only in medium containing a poor nitrogen source (2.Grenson M. Hou C. Crabeel M. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 103: 770-777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Cooper T.G. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Metabolism and Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 39-99Google Scholar). These early studies gave rise to the accepted notion thatCAN1 expression was insensitive to nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR).1 NCR is the physiological process by which good nitrogen sources (glutamine, asparagine, and ammonia) are used in preference to poor ones (proline, allantoin, γ-aminobutyrate, and glutamate) (3.Cooper T.G.

NCR-sensitive transcription of genes required for uptake and catabolism of poor nitrogen sources is mediated by UAS NTRelements (4.ter Schure E.G. van Riel N.A. Verrips C.T. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 24: 67-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 5.Cooper T.G. Mycota. 1996; 3: 139-169Google Scholar). UAS NTR, also referred to as GATA elements since they contain the core sequence GATAA, are the binding sites for the NCR-sensitive transcriptional activators Gln3p and Gat1p/Nil1p (4.ter Schure E.G. van Riel N.A. Verrips C.T. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 24: 67-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 5.Cooper T.G. Mycota. 1996; 3: 139-169Google Scholar). In the presence of excess nitrogen, Ure2p, a cytoplasmic prion-precursor protein (6.Wickner R.B. Science. 1994; 264: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar, 7.Maddelein M.-L. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 4516-4524Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), inhibits the operation of Gln3p and Gat1p (8.Courchesne W.E. Magasanik B. J.

The observation that antibody against a fusion protein containing the Gln3p GATA-zinc finger could immunoprecipitate a Ure2p sized protein, when both proteins were overproduced, suggested that Ure2p regulation of Gln3p involved formation of a Gln3p-Ure2p complex (13.Blinder D. Coschigano P. Magasanik B. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4734-4736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A similar mechanism was hypothesized, although not demonstrated, for Ure2p regulation of Gat1p. A paradox concerning Can1p synthesis began to emerge in a study of the role played by Can1p in the NCR sensitivity of arginine-inducedCAR1 (arginase) expression (14.Cooper T.G. Kovari L. Sumrada R.A. Park H.-D. Luche R.M. Kovari I. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 174: 48-55Crossref Google Scholar). The critical observation was that heterologous overproduction of Can1p (driven by theADH1 promoter) resulted in arginine-induced CAR1expression becoming insensitive to NCR (14.Cooper T.G. Kovari L. Sumrada R.A. Park H.-D. Luche R.M. Kovari I. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 174: 48-55Crossref Google Scholar). This result suggested that a portion of NCR sensitivity of CAR1 expression was derived from NCR-sensitive inducer exclusion (14.Cooper T.G. Kovari L. Sumrada R.A. Park H.-D. Luche R.M. Kovari I. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 174: 48-55Crossref Google Scholar). NCR-sensitiveCAN1 expression was subsequently demonstrated by Northern blot analysis (15.Daugherty J.R. Rai R. ElBerry H.M. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 64-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The paradox arises in trying to rectify that the original characterization of Argp/Can1p was performed under conditions of strong NCR with the observation that CAN1 expression is highly NCR-sensitive. The present work provides a potential explanation of this paradox. Two mRNA species are transcribed from CAN1. One species is Gln3p-dependent and NCR-sensitive, and a second, slightly longer species, is present only under opposite conditions,i.e. strong NCR or deletion of GLN3. The longer mRNA is much less abundant than the shorter one. Similar profiles are also observed with DAL5, DUR1,2, andDUR3. We find that the CAN1 GATA sequences are available, in gln3Δ mutants and during growth with glutamine as nitrogen source, to serve as surrogate TATA elements. Utilization of an upstream start site accounts for the increased size of the NCR-insensitive transcript. Finally, EGFP-Gln3p is nuclear during times of Gln3p-dependent gene expression. When that expression is inhibited, EGRP-Gln3p is localized to the cytoplasm. This may account for the exposure of GATA sequences and their availability to serve as surrogate TATA elements when the function of Gln3p is inhibited or its cognate gene is deleted. DISCUSSIONWe have shown that CAN1 expression generates two transcripts as follows: (i) a rapidly migrating species with a profile characteristic of NCR-sensitive, Gln3p-dependent expression, and (ii) a less rapidly migrating species whose profile is just the opposite, present only when RNA is prepared from wild type cells cultured in glutamine medium or in gln3Δ andgln3Δgat1Δ mutants. The requirement of the clusteredCAN1 GATAA or TATAA sequences for the upper species to appear suggests that these GATA sequences can serve as surrogate TATAA elements under repressive growth conditions or when GLN3 is deleted. Similar functioning of GATAA sequences as surrogate TATA elements has been reported for higher eucaryotic cells (26.Singer V.L. Wobbe C.R. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 636-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 27.Fong T.C. Emerson B.M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 28.Aird W.C. Parvin J.D. Sharp P.A. Rosenberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 269: 883-889Google Scholar). The presence of “variant TATAs” (GATAAs) situated upstream of the normalCAN1 TATAA can account for the production of the longerCAN1 mRNA species we observed earlier (15.Daugherty J.R. Rai R. ElBerry H.M. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 64-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Coffman J.A. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6910-6918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our EGFP-Gln3p and EGFP-Ure2p experiments correlate the localization of Gln3p with its ability to support transcription. When Gln3p-mediated transcription is high, Gln3p is localized to the nucleus, and when transcription is minimal, Gln3p is cytoplasmic. The nearly identical intracellular localization of EGFP-Gln3p in a cell overproducing Ure2p and EGFP-Ure2p is consistent with the formation of a Ure2p-Gln3p complex as suggested earlier (13.Blinder D. Coschigano P. Magasanik B. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4734-4736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When these correlations are considered in light of experiments showing that the extent of NCR-sensitive transcription depends upon the relative levels of GATA factor and Ure2p production (39.Cunningham T.S. Andhare R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14408-14414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), they argue that NCR is imposed by Gln3p complexing with Ure2p which prevents it from reaching its target GATAA-binding sites in the nucleus.During the preparation of this manuscript, four reports of experiments investigating the role played by TOR proteins in starvation appeared simultaneously and reached conclusions more or less similar to one another and to ours (30.Beck T.

Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar) which led them to conclude that when cells grown in rich medium are treated with the immunosuppressant drug, rapamycin, Gln3p is dephosphorylated in a Sit4p-dependent manner and enters the nucleus. In rich medium, Gln3p is predominantly cytoplasmic. An earlier report by Edskes et al. (34.Edskes H.K. Hanover J.A. Wickner R.B.

For some hexameric epitopes, like the Goodpasture epitopes, exposure to ROS specifically enhanced recognition by Goodpasture antibodies in a sequential and time-dependent fashion; control binding of epitopes to α3(IV) alloantibodies from renal transplant recipients with Alport syndrome was decreased, whereas epitope binding to heterologous antibodies recognizing all α3 NC1 epitopes remained the same. Inhibitors of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical scavengers were capable of attenuating the effects of ROS in cells and kidney by 30–50%, respectively, thereby keeping the Goodpasture epitopes largely concealed when compared with a 70% maximum inhibition by iron chelators. Hydrogen peroxide administration to rodents was sufficient to expose Goodpasture epitope in vivo and initiate autoantibody production. Our findings collectively suggest that ROS can alter the hexameric structure of type IV collagen to expose or destroy selectively immunologic epitopes embedded in basement membrane.

Circulating and tissue-bound (kidney and lung) antibodies recognize epitopes on the α3(IV) chain located in the NC1 domain (12.Hellmark T. Segelmark M. Unger C. Burkhardt H. Saus J. Wieslander J.

Whether these epitopes form a single conformational binding site in their native state is not yet clear.Goodpasture epitopes in vertebrate tissue are normally invisible to the immune system. Even after biochemical isolation, NC1 hexamers are usually nonreactive with Goodpasture autoantibodies unless their complex structure undergoes a physiochemical change in conformation (7.Hudson B.G. Wieslander J. Wisdom B.J.J. Noelken M.E. Lab. Invest. 1989; 61: 256-269PubMed Google Scholar,13.Kalluri R. Sun M.J. Hudson B.G. Neilson E.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1985; 260: 8564-8570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Exposure of these sites is prerequisite for the disease, and hydrocarbons or viral infection have been suggested as possible environmental drivers (13.Kalluri R. Sun M.J. Hudson B.G. Neilson E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9062-9068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 18.Wilson C.B. Brenner B. The Kidney. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1996: 1253-1391Google Scholar). Firm experimental evidence for a physiologic mediator or mechanism of exposure is not available. Because the by-products of aerobic metabolism can alter the structural integrity of macromolecules over time (19.Sohal R.S. Weindrch R. Science. 1996; 273: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2606) Google Scholar), we have evaluated the capacity of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to expose Goodpasture epitopes.DISCUSSIONSeveral studies have reported that superoxide, H2O2, and hydrogen radicals can induce proteinuria in rats and mice (27.Diamond J. Am. J. Kid. Dis. 1992; 19: 292-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Superoxide dismutase, an inhibitor of superoxide, is also effective in blocking albumin permeability that has been induced by superoxide in isolated glomeruli (28.Dileepan K. Sharma R. Stechschulte D. Savin V. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1993; 121: 797-804PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, desferrioxamine, an iron chelator, and dimethylthiourea, a hydroxyl radical scavenger, have been effective in treating proteinuria in anti-GBM disease in rats (29.Boyce N. Holdsworth S. Kidney Int. 1986; 30: 813-817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Dimethylthiourea was also reported to improve proteinuria in passive Heymann's nephritis (30.Shah S.V. Kidney Int. 1989; 35: 1093-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar,31.Neale T. J., Ullrich R., Ojha, P. P., Poczewski, H., Verhoeven, A. J., and Kerjaschki, D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 90, 3645–3649Google Scholar). These results strongly favor a role for ROS in renal injury. We now have evaluated the capacity of ROS to denature the NC1 hexamer and expose immunologically privileged Goodpasture epitopes through alterations in secondary or tertiary structure, fragmentation, or protein aggregation.Using bovine serum albumin as a model protein, several studies have observed that exposure to ROS leads to gross structural alterations in the protein (30.Shah S.V. Kidney Int. 1989; 35: 1093-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 31.Neale T. J., Ullrich R., Ojha, P. P., Poczewski, H., Verhoeven, A. J., and Kerjaschki, D. Proc. Natl.

Basic Life Sci. 1988; 49: 531-535PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, in a recent study of aggregation, fragmentation, and amino acid modifications of 17 proteins by ROS, it was found that all proteins underwent alterations in molecular weight (aggregation and fragmentation) or net electric charge associated with a loss of tryptophan or production of bityrosine (35.Riedle B. Kerjaschki D. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 215-231PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that superoxide alone produced no measurable effect on the above mentioned parameters and that hydrogen radicals were probably the initiating species in all cases.ROS in the current report produced structural changes to the NC1 hexamers and increased the visibility of Goodpasture epitopes within 4 min of the reaction and before fragmentation or aggregation began, as revealed by gel electrophoresis of the NC1 hexamer at 6 min of the reaction. Fragmentation of the NC1 hexamer begins by 6 min of reaction, and eventually aggregation of the protein occurs, some of which remains in the stacking gel. The aggregates could potentially be from the smaller fragments of the NC1 hexamer or NC1 hexamer itself.It is not clear which of these ROS-affected components of the NC1 hexamer best expose Goodpasture epitopes. Studies using the inhibitors of H2O2 and hydroxyl radicals, and an iron chelator reveal that none of these modifiers individually could decrease the appearance of products from the Fenton reaction exposing relevant epitopes. These experiments suggest that more than one reactive species is likely mediating the exposure. A similar broad range of ROS is thought to contribute to the inflammatory events producing anti-GBM disease in rodents, and more than one reactive species can induce proteinuria in these experiment systems (18.Wilson C.B. Brenner B. The Kidney. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1996: 1253-1391Google Scholar, 19.Sohal R.S. Weindrch R. Science. 1996; 273: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2606) Google Scholar, 21.Marsden P. Hall A. Brenner B. Brenner B. The Kidney. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1996: 713-781Google Scholar,27.Diamond J. Am. J. Kid. Dis. 1992; 19: 292-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).Several studies have also reported the capacity of epithelial cells and mesangial cells isolated from glomeruli to produce ROS in response to plasma membrane perturbations (30.Shah S.V. Kidney Int. 1989; 35: 1093-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In response to PMA, for example, rat glomeruli showed a marked increase in ROS production which reached a peak at about 20 min and declined gradually thereafter (37.Shah S. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1981; 98: 46-57PubMed Google Scholar). Results with enzymatic and chemical scavengers of oxygen metabolites suggest a role for superoxide anion, H2O2, and hydrogen radicals. These findings further support the notion that ROS can be generated by resident cells on or near GBM and hence can potentially alter the structural integrity of NC1 hexamers in the basement membrane.ROS can be produced in response to various normal stimuli such as mediators of inflammation, environmental toxins, de novorespiratory bursts associated with the mitochondria electron transport chain, endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear membrane electron transport systems, the prostaglandin synthase and lipooxygenase systems, and xenobiotics (38.McCord J. Fridovich I. Ann. Intern. Med. 1978; 89: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 39.Freeman B. Crapo J. Lab. Invest. 1982; 47: 412-426PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, ROS may influence GBM degradation by proteolytic enzymes (40.Shah S. Baricos W. Basci A. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of rat GBM with H2O2 increases its susceptibility to degradation by proteases (41.Fligiel S. Lee E. McCoy J. Johnson K. Varani J. Am J. Pathol. 1984; 115: 418-425PubMed Google Scholar). In this regard, ROS by themselves have been shown to increase the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 by the glomerular epithelial cells. Therefore, the presence of ROS in the microenvironment around the GBM can likely activate several pathways of protein modification.Finally, infusion of H2O2 into the rat renal artery produced local generation of ROS and induce a marked glomerular protein leak within minutes, suggesting an alteration in the integrity of the GBM. In these studies, there was no change in mean arterial pressure, single kidney glomerular filtration rate, or renal plasma flow, suggesting that at least acutely, local generation of ROS by this technique does not result in marked destruction of the normal renal architecture. To determine if H2O2-induced alteration of GBM integrity resulted in unmasking of the Goodpasture epitopes in vivo (as it was found in the in vitrostudies using NC1 hexamers and human kidney sections), we infused Goodpasture autoantibodies into the renal artery of either control rats or rats pretreated with H2O2. As predicted, infusion of the Goodpasture autoantibodies into control rat kidneys failed to result in antibody binding, even though a control antibody directed against multiple epitopes in the GBM demonstrated linear binding to the GBM under these conditions. However, infusion of H2O2 into the kidney to induce in vivo generation of ROS resulted in exposure of the Goodpasture epitope and subsequent Goodpasture antibody binding. Additionally, we show that infusion of H2O2 in mice for several days can generate de novo anti-α3(IV) collagen antibodies, further supporting the notion that ROS can be responsible for in vivo generation of Goodpasture autoantibodies.Although some degree of antigen exposure is essential for immunogenicity, the low frequency of clinical anti-GBM disease (18.Wilson C.B. Brenner B. The Kidney. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1996: 1253-1391Google Scholar, 19.Sohal R.S. Weindrch R. Science. 1996; 273: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2606) Google Scholar,24.Scheiman J.I.

Pathol. 1984; 115: 418-425PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that normal exposure of epitopes by self-limited generation of ROS is not sufficient by itself to launch a fatal autoimmune response. Additional permissive factors for disease almost certainly are immunogenetic (18.Wilson C.B. Brenner B. The Kidney. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1996: 1253-1391Google Scholar, 19.Sohal R.S. Weindrch R. Science. 1996; 273: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2606) Google Scholar, 24.Scheiman J.I. Foidart J.M. Michael A.F. Lab. Invest. 1980; 43: 373-381PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Couser W.G. Am.

Pathol. 1984; 115: 418-425PubMed Google Scholar), including susceptibility in humans that maps to the class II HLA-D region (42.Rees A.J. Peters D.K. Amos N. Welch K.I. Batchelor J.R. Kidney Int. 1984; 26: 444-450Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (40) Google Scholar,43.Huey B. McCormick K. Crapper J. Ratliff C. Colombe B.W. Garovoy M.R. Wilson C.B. Kidney Int. 1993; 44: 307-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and further restricted by the selection of immunoglobulin GM allotypes (43.Huey B. McCormick K. Crapper J.

Immunol. 1984; 10: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Recent studies in mice also indicate that immunologic susceptibility to Goodpasture syndrome is closely linked to the emergence of a Th1-dependent, cell-mediated repertoire (43.Huey B. McCormick K. Crapper J. Ratliff C. Colombe B.W. Garovoy M.R. Wilson C.B. Kidney Int. 1993; 44: 307-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 44.Rees A. Demaine A. Welch K. Hum.

Invest. 1997; 100: 2263-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar).Because most humans with this disease are in mid-life when they become ill (8.Ryan J.J. Mason P.J. Pusey C.D. Turner N. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1998; 113: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), there must be other latent environmental or genetic drivers that finely modulate susceptibility. The findings from our work raise the possibility of an age-dependent deterioration of native ROS inhibitors as an initiator of autoimmune injury. This hypothesis resonates easily with a more traditional notion of sporadic events that produce structural protein modification in α3(IV) NC1 domains permitting immunologic recognition in a disease-susceptible host (46.Jennette C. Falk R. Immunogenetics of Autoimmune Renal Disease. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 263-281Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether ROS scavengers could have an epitope-protective therapeutic effect in Goodpasture patients. Type IV collagen is expressed as six distinct α chains that are assembled selectively into triple helices for incorporation into basement membranes. These α chains have three domains: the non-collagenous NH2-terminal 7 S domain, a middle triple helical region containing a characteristic Gly-X-Y motif, and a COOH-terminal non-collagenous globular (or NC1)1 domain (1.Hudson B.G. Reeders S.T. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26033-26036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The type IV collagen protomer is a triple helical molecule composed of three polypeptide α chains. With six α chains of type IV collagen, 56 different combinations of type IV collagen protomers are theoretically possible. In basement membrane these protomers interact with their neighbors; four 7 S domains interact to form a tetrad, and each NC1 domain abuts with an adjacent NC1 to form a globular hexamer (1.Hudson B.G.

The α1 and α2 chains are fetal isoforms in the renal glomerulus, but later in capillary development the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) undergoes an isoform switch and α3, α4, and α5 chains replace and predominate in the adult nephron (6.Kalluri R. Shield F.A. Todd P. Hudson B.G. Neilson E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2470-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Goodpasture syndrome is an autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, pulmonary hemorrhage, and antibodies to the GBM (4.Hudson B. Kalluri R.

To understand the developmental, physiological, and pathological roles of EGF, we have generated transgenic mice widely expressing human EGF with the use of the β-actin promoter. EGF and transforming growth factor α (TGFα) bind with equal affinity to the EGF receptor, a transmembrane tyrosine kinase, to trigger various biological responses. EGF and TGFα signaling are implicated in the development of the reproductive system. EGF also plays a physiological role in reproduction. Removal of the salivary gland in rodents, which reduces circulating EGF, reduces spermatogenesis, which can be corrected by EGF replacement. Here we show that in our transgenic males, only few post-meiosis II gametes were found, and the mice were sterile. This resembles a common cause of infertility in humans. Furthermore, the transgenic males had reduced serum testosterone. Our findings contrast the previous report on transgenic mice overexpressing TGFα in testis, which showed normal spermatogenesis. These data suggest that EGF is the active ligand for EGF receptor reported in germ cells, and proper EGF expression is important for completion of spermatogenesis.

Mature EGF purified from mouse salivary gland is composed of 53 amino acids but is derived from a much larger transmembrane precursor of 1217 amino acids (2.Gray A. Dull T.J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1983; 303: 722-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 3.Scott J. Urdea M. Quiroga M. Sanchez-Pescador R. Fong N. Selby M. Rutter W.J. Bell G.I. Science. 1983; 221: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The physiological role of EGF in reproduction is suggested by various studies on the effects of sialoadenectomy (removal of salivary gland), which depleted circulating EGF. In male mice, the production of EGF in submandibular gland increases until sexual maturation (4.Byyny R.L. Orth D.N. Cohen S. Endocrinology. 1972; 90: 1261-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Studies showed that after sialoadenectomy, serum testosterone either remained unchanged in adults (5.Tsutsumi O. Kurachi H. Oka T. Science. 1986; 233: 975-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) or increased in peripubertal mice (6.Liu A. Flores C. Kinkead T. Carboni A.A. Menon M. Seethalakshmi L. J. Urol. 1994; 152: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, both studies reported reduced sperm count, which returned to normal with EGF replacement. So, EGF deficiency was linked to some unexplained cases of male infertility, in particular oligospermia. Transforming growth factor α (TGFα) is biologically and structurally related to EGF. From the expression patterns of EGF, TGFα, and their common receptor, TGFα was suggested to act during early pubertal stages to support the active somatic cell growth in testis. However, the role of TGFα in spermatogenesis is not evident (7.Mullaney B.P. Skinner M.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2103-2113Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 8.Caussanel V. Tabone E. Mauduit C. Dacheux F. Benahmed M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 123: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). EGF is involved in differentiation of the male reproductive system through modulation of androgen receptor activity (9.Gupta C. Chandorkar A. Nguyen A.P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 123: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Variousin vitro studies also showed that EGF affects the functions of Sertoli cells (10.Rich K.A. Bardin C.W. Gunsalus G.L. Mather J.P. Endocrinology. 1983; 113: 2284-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and Leydig cells (11.Verhoeven G. Cailleau J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1986; 47: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of EGF protein in specific cell types of the testis suggests that it may act in a paracrine/autocrine fashion in spermatogenesis. Mature EGF was found in Sertoli cells, pachytene spermatocytes, and round spermatids in mice. In contrast, EGF precursor immunostaining was limited to pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids (12.Radhakrishnan B. Oke B.O. Papadopoulos V. DiAugustine R.P. Suarez-Quian C.A. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 3091-3099Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The transcript (7.Mullaney B.P. Skinner M.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2103-2113Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and protein (8.Caussanel V. Tabone E. Mauduit C. Dacheux F. Benahmed M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 123: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) for EGF receptor was identified specifically in all the above testicular cell types. We have recently reported that both full-length and a shortened form of human EGF precursor (hEGF) was biologically active in transforming NIH 3T3 cells (13.Kwan R.W.P. Wong R.W.C. Chan S.Y. Int. J. Oncol. 1999; 15: 281-284PubMed Google Scholar). Because little is known about the in vivorole of EGF, we generated transgenic mice widely expressing hEGF in the present study. The β-actin promoter was used because it had been shown to drive widespread transgene expression (14.Zhang M. Kim H.J. Marshall H. Gendron-Maguire M. Lucas D.A. Baron A. Gudas L.J. Gridley T. Krumlauf R. Grippo J.F. Development. 1994; 120: 2431-2442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The eight EGF-like repeats in the EGF precursor were deleted to give hEGF, leaving the active EGF domain in the transmembrane form. Transgenic males expressing hEGF were sterile with hypospermatogenesis. This is in contrast to transgenic mice overexpressing TGFα in the testis, which were reported to have normal testis morphology and spermatogenesis (7.Mullaney B.P. Skinner M.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2103-2113Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Together with the expression studies described above, we suggest that EGF instead of TGFα is likely to be the physiological ligand for EGF receptor in spermatogenesis. Mice were held in the Laboratory Animal Unit of the University of Hong Kong. F1 hybrid mice were routinely raised from breeding pairs of C57BL/6N female × CBA/N male. All mice were maintained on a 12-h light and 12-h dark cycle. Autoclaved food (Purina) and UV-irradiated water were available ad libitum. Principles of laboratory animal care and specific national laws relating to the welfare of animals were followed. Research protocols were approved by an institutional ethics committee. The structure of full-length EGF precursor is given in Fig.1 A, and the construct for microinjection is shown in Fig. 1 B. The hEGF cDNA was regulated by the β-actin promoter to give widespread expression in transgenic animals. Construction of cDNA for hEGF has been described (13.Kwan R.W.P. Wong R.W.C. Chan S.Y. Int. J. Oncol. 1999; 15: 281-284PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the region encoding the 8 EGF-like repeats was deleted by digestion with EcoRI (position 547, GenBankTM accession number X04571) and Bsu36I (3313). The reading frame is conserved after religation of the end filled sites as checked by sequencing. The resulting cDNA (1.06 kilobases) was ligated with the 4.3-kilobase β-actin promoter and the 0.3-kilobase SV40 poly(A) in pBluescript KS+ (Strategene). For microinjection, insert DNA was released by digestion withXbaI and SalI, purified using the QIAEX gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA), and passed through a spin-X column (Costar). DNA was introduced at a concentration of 5 ng/μl into F1 and FVB/N embryos by standard microinjection procedures (15.Hogan B. Beddington R. Constantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 232-248Google Scholar, 16.Wong, R. W. C., Sham, M. H., Lau, Y. L., and Chan, S. Y. (2000) Mol. Biotechnol., in pressGoogle Scholar). At weaning of the resulting pups, DNA from tail biosies were screened by polymerase chain reaction with primers 5′-AGTGACTCTGAATGTCCCC and 5′-GTTGCATTGACCCATCTGCTG, which were specific for human EGF. The temperature profile was denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 29 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and organs were collected immediately for histology or protein preparation. For Western analysis, membrane proteins were prepared according to Ref. 17.Wong, R. W. C., and Chan, S. Y. (2000) Mol. Biotechnol., in pressGoogle Scholar. Samples (60 μg as determined with a Coomassie Blue dye binding assay; Bio-Rad) were separated in a 8% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a Hybon-ECL membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Human EGF was detected using polyclonal antibody Ab-3 (Calbiochem), which recognized human but not mouse EGF, at 1:500 and secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 1:1000 as described in our previous work (13.Kwan R.W.P. Wong R.W.C. Chan S.Y. Int. J. Oncol. 1999; 15: 281-284PubMed Google Scholar). The histology and immunohistochemical methods used were as described previously (18.Lee D.C.W. Chan K.W. Chan S.Y. J. Urol. 1998; 159: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In brief, freshly collected tissues were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C. The sections were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 min to inactivate the endogenous peroxidase and washed thoroughly with distilled water and then Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4. After incubation with 10% normal goat serum, the primary antibody Ab-3 was applied for 2 h at room temperature. Then the sections were washed with Tris-buffered saline and incubated with streptavidin-biotinylated peroxidase complex (Dako) for 30 min. The sections were then washed with Tris-buffered saline and incubated with 1 mg/ml of 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride chromogen solution (Dako) with 0.02% of hydrogen peroxide for 5 min. After counterstaining with hematoxylin, the sections were dehydrated with graded alcohol and xylene and mounted with Permount. Sections were inspected using ordinary light microscopy. Blood was collected by cardiac puncture immediately after the animal was killed by cervical dislocation. Blood samples were kept on ice for 15 min, followed by centrifugation at ∼6,000 × g. The supernatant was aliquoted and stored at −20 °C until assay. Serum samples were measured using a Coat-A-Count total testosterone kit from Diagnostic Products Corp. Controls were age-matched FVB/N and F1 males. Statistical differences between transgenic and control groups were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney Test. Initially, we tried using the phosphoglycerate kinase-1 promoter to drive both hEGF expression and the reporter gene βgeo with the use of internal ribosomal entry site. The construct has been described before (13.Kwan R.W.P. Wong R.W.C. Chan S.Y. Int. J. Oncol. 1999; 15: 281-284PubMed Google Scholar). However, this construct was not giving high level of transgene expression in transgenic mice. Under this condition we changed the strategy and constructed the β-actin promoter injection plasmid (Fig.1 B). Five transgenic mice, named T1–T5, were generated independently. T2, T3, and T4 were FVB males from the same litter. T1 and T5 were F1 females from separate litters. Immunoblot showed that hEGF, with the expected size of 40 kDa, was highly expressed in the membrane fraction of all tissues tested, including submandibular gland, kidney, liver, and testis (Fig.1 C). This demonstrates that hEGF protein was widely and highly expressed under the β-actin promoter. All five transgenic animals were found to be smaller than nontransgenic littermate(s), and the reduction in size appeared proportionate. A significant difference in body weight was already apparent in both sexes since birth (Fig.2 A). At adulthood they attained 70% of the weight of nontransgenic littermates (Fig.2 B). Immunostaining of hEGF in the submandibular gland and gonad was performed for all transgenic animals. They all showed similar immunostaining. In submandibular gland, the whole organ expressed hEGF (brown), with more prominent staining in granular tubule cells (Fig. 3 A). In the testis of T2–T4, immunostaining of testis revealed brown staining in all cell types including germ cells, interstitial cells and Sertoli cells. No staining was seen in nontransgenic littermates (Fig.3 B). Two out of three transgenic males (T3 and T4) never sired offspring till sacrifice at 9 months. T2, which was sacrificed at 2 months old, had 76 offspring from 10 litters but none of them were transgenic. This observation suggests that he was mosaic and that little or no functional sperm was derived from transgenic spermatogonia. For the sterile males, their testis histology revealed similar features (Fig.4). The tubules were of smaller diameter, but the tubular lumen was enlarged, which is typical of hypospermatogenesis. The thickness of germ cell layers was uneven; some region had just a layer of spermatogonia. Normally, spermatids at particular stage(s) will be present in all tubular sections, but this is not the case in T3 and T4. For them, very few tubular regions contained spermatids and spermatozoa. These post-meiotic II germ cells, if present, were much less than normal. Only a small number of spermatocytes went past the pachytene stage. No sperm was retrieved from epididymis of T3 and T4 in an attempt to collect capacitated sperms for in vitro fertilization and cryopreservation. The mean serum testosterone for transgenic mice (n = 3) was significantly lower than for age-matched controls (n = 6) (16.623 ± 1.815versus 81.715 ± 17.723 nmol/liter, p = 0.01). However, the sizes of seminal vesicles and prostate glands were normal. T3 and T4 seemed to lack mating behavior. Vaginal plugs were not found in females caged with T3 or T4. We have generated hEGF transgenic mice that appeared to be proportionate dwarfs. They were born with only half of the weight of normal littermates. These findings coincide with previous reports that injection of EGF induced growth retardation in newborn rats (19.Hoath S.B. Pediat. Res. 1986; 20: 468-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and inhibited adipose tissue development (8.Caussanel V. Tabone E. Mauduit C. Dacheux F. Benahmed M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 123: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Calamandrei and Alleva (20.Calamandrei G. Alleva E. Brain Res. 1989; 477: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) reported that EGF treatment retards both the rate of body growth and the full appearance of several neurobehavioral signs of maturation. Webber et al. (21.Webber E.M. Wu J.C. Wang L. Merlino G. Fausto N. Amer. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 398-408PubMed Google Scholar) reported that transgenic mice overexpressing TGF-α weighed approximately 10% less than the control. In a recent report, Dealy et al. (22.Dealy C.N. Scranton V. Cheng H.C. Dev. Biol. 1998; 202: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) examined the distribution of TGF-α, EGF, and the chicken EGF receptor (encoded by c-erbB) in embryonic chick limbs. They found that exogenous TGF-α and EGF inhibited chondrogenesis and myogenesis of limb mesenchyme in vitro. They concluded that signaling through the EGF receptor via endogenous TGF-α and EGF may be important for initial limb formation, outgrowth of limb mesoderm, and regulation of limb chondrogenic and myogenic differentiation. More recently, Erwinet al. (23.Erwin C.R. Helmrath M.A. Shin C.E. Falcone Jr, R.A. Stern L.E. Warner B.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G533-G540PubMed Google Scholar) reported the effect of intestinal overexpression of EGF. A murine EGF precursor cDNA construct was produced, and expression of the transgene was targeted to the small intestine with the use of rat intestinal fatty acid-binding protein promoter. Interestingly, their transgenic animals had improved post-resection adaptation. Besides shortened small intestine, no other abnormal phenotype was observed. The unexpected finding of the present report is male infertility with EGF overexpression. The physiological role of EGF in reproduction is suggested by various studies on the effects of depleting circulating EGF by sialoadenectomy. Studies showed that after sialoadenectomy, serum testosterone either remained unchanged in adult (5.Tsutsumi O. Kurachi H. Oka T. Science. 1986; 233: 975-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) or increased in peripubertal mice (6.Liu A. Flores C. Kinkead T. Carboni A.A. Menon M. Seethalakshmi L. J. Urol. 1994; 152: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Both studies reported reduced spermatid count that returned to normal with EGF treatment. In Ref. 5.Tsutsumi O. Kurachi H. Oka T. Science. 1986; 233: 975-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, there was accumulation of pachytene spermatocytes, whereas in Ref. 6.Liu A. Flores C. Kinkead T. Carboni A.A. Menon M. Seethalakshmi L. J. Urol. 1994; 152: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, a decrease in preleptotene and pachytene spermatocytes was noted. This suggests a relationship between EGF and spermatogenesis, especially at the stage of meiosis II. That EGF deficiency is linked to oligospermia is further shown in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Both the reduction in sperm count and EGF level could be restored by insulin. These effects were abolished by the concomitant administration of EGF antiserum (24.Noguchi S. Ohba Y. Oka T. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 2136-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this report, we showed that EGF overexpression in testis, on the other hand, again led to reduced spermatogenesis, especially in the production of spermatids and spermatozoa. We therefore suggest that proper dose of EGF is important for spermatogenesis, in particular for progress from MI to MII of meiosis. It is interesting to note that maturation arrest of germ cells causes 10–30% of male infertility in humans (25.Colgan T.J. Bedard Y.C. Strawbridge T.G. Bubkspan M.B. Klotz P.G. Fertil. Steril. 1980; 33: 56-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The most common is arrest at spermatocyte I, also called meiotic I arrest. Similar to the case in our transgenic males, it is characterized by absence or less than 10% of tubules containing cells beyond the pachytene stage (26.Meyer J.M. Maetz J.L. Rumpler Y. Histopathology. 1992; 21: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). EGF, TGFα, and amphiregulin are known to bind and activate only the EGF receptor (ErbB1) (27.Moghal N. Sternberg P.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). That EGF is the endogenous ligand for EGF receptor in spermatogenesis is supported by expression of EGF but not TGFα protein in specific germ cell types of the testis. In adult mice, EGF precursor immunostaining was limited to pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids, whereas mature EGF was found in addition in Sertoli cells (12.Radhakrishnan B. Oke B.O. Papadopoulos V. DiAugustine R.P. Suarez-Quian C.A. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 3091-3099Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The source of mature EGF in these cells remained to be determined. EGF, but not TGFα, was also found in the germ cells in boar. In addition, EGF receptor immunostaining varied according to the course of spermatogenesis, with predominant EGF receptor staining in pachytene spermatocytes before and during meiosis and in post-meiotic germ cells (8.Caussanel V. Tabone E. Mauduit C. Dacheux F. Benahmed M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 123: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Bartlett et al. (28.Bartlett J.M.S. Spiteri-Grech J. Nieschlag E. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 747-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) have also shown increased testicular EGF concentrations in synchronized rat testes that were closed to the meiotic stages. This paper provides the first in vivo evidence that EGF overexpression can adversely affect spermatogenesis. This contrasts the previous report on overexpression of TGFα in a line of transgenic mice, which highly expressed human TGFα protein in testis and seminal vesicle. These mice did not have abnormal testis morphology or spermatogenesis (7.Mullaney B.P. Skinner M.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2103-2113Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), suggesting that the two growth factors may have different roles in spermatogenesis. Interestingly, both reduction of circulating EGF by sialoadenectomy and EGF overexpression result in hypospermatogenesis. The expression patterns of EGF, TGFα, and their common receptor in testis together with the physiological studies mentioned above and the overexpression studies in transgenic mice all agreed to the suggestion that the EGF-EGF receptor system is involved in the meiotic process. Furthermore, the EGF receptor is shown to be functional in spermatogonia and spermatozoa (29.Haneji T. Koide S. Tajima Y. Nishimune Y. J. Endocrinol. 1991; 128: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 30.Damjanov I. Solter D. Knowles B.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although EGF seems to be the physiological ligand in germ cell development, mice with either single or triple null mutations in EGF, TGFα, and amphiregulin did not suffer from reduced fertility (31.Luetteke N.C. Qiu T.H. Fenton S.E. Troyer K.L. Riedel R.F. Chang A. Lee D.C. Development. 1999; 126: 2739-2750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This raises the possibility of functional redundancy with heparin-binding EGF, betacellulin, and epiregulin, which bind ErbB4 as well as EGF receptor (reviewed in Ref. 32.Riese II D.J. Stern D.F. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Besides a primary defect in the germ cells, overexpression of EGF in the somatic lineages of the testis may have a secondary effect on spermatogenesis and fertility in our transgenic animals. A large volume of in vitro data have shown the effects of EGF on the proliferation and function of Sertoli and Leydig cells. We suggest that reduced serum testosterone in the transgenic mice was due to either direct effect of EGF on testosterone production by Leydig cells (33.Welsh T.H. Hsueh A.J.W. Endocrinology. 1982; 110: 1498-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar,34.Yan Y.C. Sun Y.P. Zhang M.L. Arch. Androl. 1998; 40: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or indirect effect of EGF on gonadotrophin production. Nevertheless, we propose that lower testosterone was unlikely to be their underlying cause of infertility, because the serum testosterone level in all three transgenic males were similar and T2 was fertile. The male accessory glands, which are sensitive to serum testosterone levels (35.Brooks D.E. J. Endocrinol. 1979; 82: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 36.Shima H. Tsuji M. Young P. Cunha G.R. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 3222-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), still developed to appropriate sizes in our transgenic males. As a next step in delineating the functions of EGF in spermatogenesis, overexpression in specific cell types, for example in pachytene spermatocytes, will help to establish the autocrine/paracrine role of EGF in spermatogenesis. We thank Prof. G. I. Bell for providing EGF cDNA, Prof. C. Y. Yeung for continuous support, Dr. W. S. B. Yeung for serum hormone measurements and comments, and Bobo Mok for discussion."
https://openalex.org/W2053724642,"Statistical studies of N-glycosylated proteins have indicated that the frequency of nonglycosylated Asn-Xaa-(Thr/Ser) sequons increases toward the C terminus (Gavel, Y., and von Heijne, G. (1990) Protein Eng. 3, 433–442). Usingin vitro transcription/translation of a truncated model protein in the presence of dog pancreas microsomes, we find that glycosylation efficiency of Asn-Xaa-Thr sequons indeed is reduced when the sequon is within ∼60 residues of the C terminus. Surprisingly, the presence of a hydrophobic stop transfer sequence between the Asn-Xaa-Thr sequon and the C terminus results in a very different dependence of glycosylation efficiency on the distance to the C terminus, where the presence of the stop transfer segment inside the ribosome appears to cause a drastic drop in the level of glycosylation. We speculate that this may reflect a change in the structure of the ribosome/translocon complex induced by the stop transfer segment.

We speculate that this may reflect a change in the structure of the ribosome/translocon complex induced by the stop transfer segment. endoplasmic reticulum oligosaccharyl transferase stop transfer polymerase chain reaction In mammalian cells, nascent secretory and membrane proteins are co-translationally glycosylated on Asn-Xaa-(Thr/Ser) sequons by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1enzyme oligosaccharyl transferase (OST) (1.Shakin-Eshleman S. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1996; 8: 115-120Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The OST complex is associated with the Sec61 translocon, through which proteins are translocated into the lumen of the ER or inserted into the ER membrane (2.Rapoport T.A. Jungnickel B. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 271-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). A highly regulated mechanism has been observed during synthesis of transmembrane proteins, where the emergence of a hydrophobic stop transfer (ST) sequence inside the ribosome triggers the closing of the lumenal end of the translocon pore and the almost simultaneous opening of the cytosolic ribosome/translocon seal (3.Liao S. Lin J. Do H. Johnson A. Cell. 1997; 90: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 4.Hamman B.D. Hendershot L.M. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 747-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Structural changes on both sides of the translocon are thus effected by the ST sequence from inside the ribosome, but whether these changes are also transmitted to the OST or otherwise influence the glycosylation reaction is unknown. Previously, we have found that the lumenally oriented active site of the OST is positioned at a well defined distance from the surface of the ER membrane (5.Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and can be used as a fixed point of reference to study structural changes in transmembrane segments in the ER membrane (6.Nilsson I. Sääf A. Whitley P. Gafvelin G. Waller C. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1165-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 7.Monné M. Nilsson I. Johansson M. Elmhed N. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1177-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Here, we have measured the efficiency ofN-glycosylation of Asn-Xaa-Thr sequons as a function of their distance from the C-terminal end of a model protein, in both the absence and the presence of an intervening hydrophobic ST sequence. When there is no ST sequence between the glycosylation acceptor sequon and the C terminus, the glycosylation efficiency increases as the stop codon is moved further away from the sequon and plateaus at a distance of ∼60 residues or more. In stark contrast, with poly-Leu ST sequences of either 15 or 30 hydrophobic residues placed between the acceptor sequon and the C terminus, we observe a dramatic drop in glycosylation efficiency when the C-terminal end of the protein is located immediately downstream of the transmembrane segment. This effect persists until the N-terminal end of the ST sequence is 40–50 residues away from the C-terminal residue, suggesting that the presence of a hydrophobic stretch inside the ribosome when translation terminates somehow prevents access to the OST of a glycosylation acceptor site located immediately upstream of the hydrophobic segment. We speculate that this finding may be related to the previously observed closing of the lumenal end of the translocation channel induced by the appearance of a hydrophobic segment inside the ribosome (3.Liao S. Lin J. Do H. Johnson A. Cell. 1997; 90: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar).

The PCR purification kit and RNeasy RNA clean up were from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). Oligonucleotides were from Cybergene (Stockholm, Sweden). Insertion of the stop transfer sequences QQQL14VKKKK and QQQL29VKKKK into the P2 domain of Lep was performed by introducing BclI and NdeI restriction sites in codon 214 and 220, respectively. Double-stranded oligonucleotides coding for the above amino acid sequences were then cloned between the BclI and NdeI restriction sites. Site-specific mutagenesis of the lepB gene used to make a Asn214 → Gln mutation (to remove a potential glycosylation acceptor site), to introduce new Asn-Ser-Thr glycosylation acceptor sites, and to introduce restriction enzyme cleavage sites was performed in phage M13 according to the method of Kunkel (8.Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4881) Google Scholar, 9.Geisselsoder J. Witney F. Yuckenberg P. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 786-791Google Scholar). The Lep-ST29L(CC/50) construct was made by first cloning a PCR-amplified fragment from the P2 domain of Lep into the Lep-ST29L construct to obtain Lep-ST29L (50). The 5′ primer used in the amplification of the Lep fragment had a EcoRV site in codon 150, and the 3′ primer had a BssHII site in codon 213 in thelepB gene. The amplified EcoRV-BssHII fragment was cloned into the Lep-ST29L construct between the naturalEcoRV and BssHII restriction sites in codons 130 and 145 in the P2 domain. The resulting fusion had the sequence … RGDI130L150P. . . . . PK213K145RAVGL … (numbers refer to the wild type Lep sequence), increasing the size of the P2 domain by 50 residues. In a second step, the Lep-ST29L(CC/50) construct was made by ligating PCR-amplified fragments from a previously constructed Lep-derivative with a signal peptidase cleavage cassette inserted at the C-terminal end of a H2 transmembrane segment composed of 14 leucine residues (10.Nilsson I. Whitley P. von Heijne G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and from the Lep-ST29L (50) construct. The 5′ primer used for amplification of the cleavage cassette containing Lep fragment was situated 210 bases upstream of the translational start site, and the 3′ primer had a BglII site in codon 84 in the lepBgene. The 5′ primer used in the amplification of the Lep-ST29L (50) fragment had a BglII site in codon 88 in the lepBgene. The newly created fusion joint had the amino acid sequence … PFQI86SS88 … (numbers refer to the wild type Lep sequence). The amplified fragments were ligated in the gel after agarose gel purification, and mRNA templates were prepared by PCR amplification of the ligated fragments using 5′ and 3′ primers as described below. For cloning into and in vitro expression from the pGEM1 plasmid, the 5′ end of the lepB gene was modified first by the introduction of a XbaI site and second by changing the context 5′ to the initiator ATG codon to a “Kozak consensus” sequence (11.Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5134-5142Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Thus, the 5′ region of the gene was modified to: …ATAACCCTCTAGAGCCACCATGGCGAAT … (XbaI site and initiator codon underlined). Mutants of Lep made in phage M13 were cloned into pGEM1 behind the SP6 promoter as aXbaI-SmaI fragment. All mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing of plasmid and single-stranded M13 DNA using T7 DNA polymerase. Templates for in vitro transcription of truncated mRNA with a 3′ stop codon were prepared using PCR to amplify fragments from pGEM1 plasmids containing the relevant Lep constructs. The 5′ primer was the same for all PCR reactions and had the sequence 5′-TTCGTCCAACCAAACCGACTC-3′. This primer is situated 210 bases upstream of the translational start, and all amplified fragments contained the SP6 transcriptional promoter from pGEM1. The 3′ primers were designed according to the desired positions of the stop codons. All 3′ primers contained the tandem translational stop codons TAG TAA and were designed to have approximately the same annealing temperature as the 5′ primer. PCR amplification was performed with a total of 30 cycles using an annealing temperature of 52 °C. The amplified DNA products were purified using the Qiagen PCR purification kit as described in the manufacturer's protocol and verified on a 1.2% agarose gel. Truncated mRNAs with stop codons were transcribed from the SP6 promoter using the RiboMAX SP6 RNA polymerase system. Transcriptions were carried out at 30 °C for 12 h. The mRNAs were purified using Qiagen RNeasy clean up kit and verified on a 1.2% agarose gel. Translation in reticulocyte lysate in the presence of dog pancreas microsomes was performed as described in Ref. 12.Liljeström P. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 147-154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, and alkaline extraction was performed as described in Ref. 13.Mothes W. Heinrich S. Graf R. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Brunner J. Rapoport T. Cell. 1997; 89: 523-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and gels were quantitated on a Fuji BAS1000 phosphoimager using the MacBAS 2.31 software. The extent of glycosylation of a given mutant was calculated as the quotient between the intensity of the glycosylated band divided by the summed intensities of the glycosylated and nonglycosylated bands. For some constructs, the assay was repeated in the presence of a glycosylation acceptor tripeptide as described (5.Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or in the presence of a signal peptidase inhibitor (14.van Geest M. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2816-2823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We used the well characterized Escherichia coli inner membrane protein leader peptidase (Lep) (Fig.1 A) to measure the glycosylation efficiency of Asn-Xaa-Thr sequons in C-terminally truncated proteins. When Lep is expressed in vitro in the presence of dog pancreas microsomes, both the N-terminal tail and C-terminal P2 domain are translocated to the lumenal side, the same orientation as in E. coli (5.Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A cryptic glycosylation site in the P2 domain, Asn214-Glu-Thr, is efficiently glycosylated upon translocation into the lumen. To measure glycosylation efficiency as a function of the position of the glycosylation acceptor site relative to the C terminus, proteins truncated at various positions in the P2 domain, C-terminal to the naturally occurring, unique Asn214-Glu-Thr sequon and to two engineered unique glycosylation acceptor sites (Asn201-Ser-Thr, Asn203-Ser-Thr), were generated by PCR (Fig. 1 B) using primers encoding tandem stop codons and made by in vitro transcription/translation in reticulocyte lysate in the absence and presence of dog pancreas microsomes. In addition, unique Asn-Ser-Thr acceptor sequons were placed in different positions relative to the C terminus in a variant of the full-length Lep protein where the Asn214 sequon had been removed by an Asn214 → Gln change. As shown in Fig. 2, although there is some variation depending on the exact location of the stop codon, the glycosylation efficiency is reduced by more than 50% when the glycosylation acceptor site is very close to the C terminus, and the efficiency increases gradually with the distance between the acceptor site and the C terminus. Full glycosylation, which is 70–80% in this system (5.Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is observed when the distance between the acceptor site and the C terminus is ∼60 residues or more. For efficient modification, it thus appears that the acceptor site has to reach or at least be close to the OST active site, which is ∼65 residues away from the ribosomal P-site (15.Whitley P. Nilsson I.M. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6241-6244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), before chain termination. These results are consistent with an earlier study of the rabies virus glycoprotein, where a reduced glycosylation efficiency of two mutants truncated, respectively, 27 and 69 residues downstream of an acceptor Asn was noted (16.Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9465-9472Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Because the results reported above indicated that glycosylation efficiency depends on the location of the acceptor site relative to the OST active site at the time of chain termination, we considered the possibility that glycosylation efficiency may also be influenced by the presence of a hydrophobic ST sequence between the acceptor site and the C terminus. We thus constructed C-terminally truncated versions of two previously studied model proteins (Lep-ST14L and Lep-ST29L) (6.Nilsson I. Sääf A. Whitley P. Gafvelin G. Waller C. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1165-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) (Fig.3 A) that contain an engineered glycosylation site (Asn201-Ser-Thr or Asn203-Ser-Thr) 16 or 18 residues upstream of a poly-Leu ST sequence composed of either 15 or 30 hydrophobic residues (QQQL14VKKKK or QQQL29VKKKK). When expressed as full-length proteins, Lep-ST14L and Lep-ST29L are efficiently glycosylated on Asn201 and Asn203, respectively (Fig. 3 B). C-terminal truncations were made by introducing tandem stop codons at different sites downstream of and inside the ST segments, and glycosylation was assayed by in vitrotranscription/translation in the absence and presence of microsomes. As shown in Fig. 3 C, for both constructs the glycosylation efficiency remains at ∼35% until the stop codon is placed ∼10 residues into the hydrophobic stretch and then increases to the level seen without a hydrophobic segment. Strikingly, the glycosylation efficiency drops sharply as soon as the stop codon is placed downstream of the ST segment and remains low until the C terminus of the truncated protein is ∼70 residues away from the glycosylation site. Thus, the glycosylation efficiency appears to depend both on the position of the C terminus relative to the ST sequence and to the glycosylation acceptor site. To determine whether the proteins truncated in or near the ST sequence were retained in the membrane, we tested two additional series of constructs. First, we repeated the above experiments using a Lep-ST29L construct with the glycosylation site placed in position 208, only 11 residues upstream of the ST segment. We have shown previously that a glycosylation acceptor site must be at least 13–15 residues upstream of a membrane-anchored ST segment to be a substrate for OST (5.Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Nilsson I. Sääf A. Whitley P. Gafvelin G. Waller C. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1165-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and indeed, no glycosylation was seen for the Lep-ST29L(Asn208-Ser-Thr) construct, Fig.4 (lane 1). Similarly, no glycosylation was seen when this construct was truncated by placing tandem stop codons 1, 5, and 15 positions downstream of the ST29L segment (data not shown) or in a position leaving 15 leucine residues in the ST segment (lane 2). However, when only 10 leucines were left in the ST segment, the glycosylation efficiency increased to 20% (lane 3), and with only 5 leucines left, it increased to 38% (lane 4). In the latter construct, the protein was truncated 16 residues downstream of Asn208, and the glycosylation efficiency was thus similar to what was found for the short Lep constructs lacking an ST segment (Fig. 2). As a second control, we introduced a signal peptidase cleavage cassette (10.Nilsson I. Whitley P. von Heijne G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) at the C-terminal end of the H2 transmembrane segment (Fig.5 A) and assayed membrane integration of constructs truncated at different positions in the ST segment by alkaline extraction (17.Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). For this, Lep-ST29L with the acceptor site at Asn203 was modified by (i) exchanging H2 for a 14-leucine-long hydrophobic segment ending with a signal peptidase cleavage cassette and (ii) adding an extra 50 residues to the P2 domain. The lengthening of the P2 domain was necessary to avoid that the P2-ST fragment remaining after signal peptidase cleavage overlapped in the gel with nonspecific background bands from the in vitro translation. As seen in Fig. 5 B, the resulting full-length Lep-ST29L(CC/50) construct was cleaved by signal peptidase and glycosylated when expressed in the presence of rough microsomes. Significantly, as seen in Fig. 5 C, a truncated form of Lep-ST29L(CC/50) with stop codons placed one residue downstream of the ST segment was not extracted from the membrane pellet by alkali (bottom panel, lanes 5 and 6), whereas a truncated form with only 5 leucine residues left in the ST segment was extractable (top panel, lanes 5 and6). Both truncated forms were inefficiently glycosylated, as expected from Fig. 3 C, and signal peptidase-mediated cleavage of the constructs was inhibited by the signal peptidase inhibitorN-methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-chloromethylketone (lane 3). From these two sets of control experiments, we conclude that truncated ST segments retaining ∼15 leucine residues or more are efficiently anchored in the membrane (presumably in a transmembrane disposition), whereas those with ∼10 or fewer leucine residues are largely released into the lumen of the microsomes. Thus, the drop in glycosylation efficiency seen in Fig. 3 for proteins truncated after the ST segment cannot be explained by a lack of proper membrane integration of the ST segment. To rule out that the identity of the codon next to the stop codon had an influence on the results, we made two further controls. First, we changed the valine codon GTT at the end of the ST segment in Lep-ST14L to one (GTG) more frequently used in mammalian mRNAs, and placed a stop codon in the next position. Second, we changed the valine codon to one coding for leucine (CTG), again placing the stop codon in the next position. In neither case did we observe an effect on glycosylation, which remained at ∼60% (data not shown). Finally, to rule out the possibility that the low level of glycosylation seen when the stop codon was placed immediately downstream of the ST sequence was caused by the four flanking lysine residues, we changed the C-terminal sequence … LVKKKKHM(stop) to … LVDPNQHM(stop) for both the ST14L and ST29L constructs; again no change in glycosylation efficiency was seen (data not shown). Statistical studies of the location of glycosylated and nonglycosylated potential acceptor sites in secreted proteins have indicated that the frequency of nonglycosylated Asn-Xaa-(Thr/Ser) sequons increases toward the C-terminal end of glycoproteins (18.Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). We now find a similar trend when we successively increase the number of residues between an acceptor site and the C terminus of truncated Lep constructs (Fig. 2), suggesting that glycosylation is inefficient when chain termination happens before the acceptor site reaches the OST active site. Previous measurements have shown that ∼65 residues in a nascent polypeptide chain are required to span the distance between the ribosomal P-site and the OST active site (15.Whitley P. Nilsson I.M. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6241-6244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and we indeed see fully efficient glycosylation only when ∼60 residues or more separate the glycosylation acceptor site from the C terminus. The rate of chain elongation in vitro is quite slow (∼1 residue/s (19.Garoff H. Huylebroeck D. Robinson A. Tillman U. Liljeström P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar)), and it is possible that the reduction in glycosylation efficiency seen when chain termination precedes glycosylation is the result of a more rapid translocation of the nascent chain relative to the OST once it has been detached from the ribosome. Although we have not tested the truncated Lep constructs in vivo, the observation that more nonglycosylated Asn-Xaa-(Thr/Ser) sequons are found near the C-terminal end of secreted glycoproteins (18.Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar) suggest that also in vivo chain termination can influence glycosylation efficiency. We also note that the reduction in glycosylation efficiency seen when the glycosylation site is close to the C-terminal end of the protein needs to be taken into account when mapping the topology of integral membrane proteins by glycosylation scanning (14.van Geest M. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2816-2823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 20.Tam L.Y. Landoltmarticorena C. Reithmeier R.A.F.

Chem. 1997; 272: 18325-18332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 22.Nilsson I. Witt S. Kiefer H. Mingarro I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6207-6213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and points to the necessity to use sufficiently large C-terminal reporter domains. When a hydrophobic ST sequence is present between the acceptor site and the C terminus, a very different behavior is observed. In particular, for constructs where the C-terminal end of the protein is located in a region immediately downstream of the hydrophobic segment, very low levels of glycosylation are seen (Fig. 3 C), even though the separation between the acceptor site and the C terminus is ∼50 residues or more. The level of glycosylation returns to “normal” only when the C terminus is ∼70 residues or more away from the acceptor site, i.e. at a point where the acceptor site has just emerged in the vicinity of the OST active site when the stop codon is reached (15.Whitley P. Nilsson I.M. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6241-6244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The reduction in the glycosylation efficiency thus corresponds to a situation where the ST sequence has been fully polymerized but is still largely inside the ribosome at the time of chain termination. The dramatic effect on glycosylation caused by the ST sequence suggests that the hydrophobic segment may in some way affect the structure of the ribosome-translocon-OST complex from inside the ribosome. Indeed, recent experiments have shown that the translocon pore is gated during membrane protein integration; whereas the translocon pore is normally open toward the lumen and closed by the ribosome on the cytosolic side during chain translocation, this situation is rapidly reversed when an ST sequence appears inside the ribosome (3.Liao S. Lin J. Do H. Johnson A. Cell. 1997; 90: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 4.Hamman B.D. Hendershot L.M. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 747-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The conversion to a state open toward the cytosol and closed toward the lumen happens already when 4–9 residues have been polymerized in addition to the ST sequence. Similarly, the drop in glycosylation efficiency seen in Fig.3 C happens when the stop codon is placed only a couple of residues downstream of the hydrophobic stretch, both for ST14L and for ST29L. We thus speculate that the closing of the lumenal end of the translocon induced by the presence of an ST sequence in the ribosome also affects the way in which the nascent chain is exposed to the OST and thus indirectly the efficiency with which glycosylation acceptor sites near the C-terminal end of the nascent chain are modified.

Calvin-Benson-Bassham ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase base pair(s) polymerase chain reaction The nonsulfur purple bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroidesis capable of both dark aerobic chemoheterotrophic growth and anoxic photosynthetic growth. Under photoautotrophic growth conditions, where CO2 functions as the sole carbon source, the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB)1reductive pentose phosphate cycle provides nearly all cellular carbon. Photosynthetic growth in the presence of fixed carbon sources (i.e. photoheterotrophic growth) changes the primary role of the CBB cycle. Under these growth conditions, the CBB cycle facilitates the use of CO2 as an electron sink and terminal electron acceptor for reducing equivalents generated by carbon oxidation and photosynthesis (1.Tabita F.R. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 885-914Google Scholar). In R. sphaeroides, control of CBB cycle gene (cbb) expression is achieved through the regulated expression of two major cbb operons, denoted form I (cbbI) and form II (cbbII) (2.Gibson J.L. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 1107-1124Google Scholar, 3.Gibson J.L. Tabita F.R. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 166: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These operons are located on separate genetic elements in this organism (4.Suwanto A. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5858-5859Google Scholar, 5.Suwanto A. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1135-1145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ThecbbI operon comprises structural genes that encode CBB cycle enzymes, including fructose 1,6-sedoheptulose 1,7-bisphosphatase (cbbFI), phosphoribulokinase (cbbPI), fructose 1,6-sedoheptulose 1,7-bisphosphate aldolase (cbbAI), as well as the large and small subunit genes of form I (L8S8) ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) (cbbLIcbbSI) (6.Gibson J.L. Falcone D.L. Tabita F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14646-14653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ThecbbII operon encodes homologs ofcbbFI , PI , andAI as well as the genes for transketolase (cbbTII), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (cbbGII) and the large subunit of the form II-type Rubisco (cbbMII) (7.Chen J.-H. Gibson J.L. Macue L.A. Tabita F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20447-20452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies over the years have shown that the regulation of cbb gene expression in R. sphaeroides is complex (2.Gibson J.L. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 1107-1124Google Scholar). Expression of both the cbbI and cbbII operons is quite low under dark aerobic chemoheterotrophic conditions. However, under photosynthetic growth conditions, expression of the genes from both operons is derepressed, with each operon responding independently to a number of environmental parameters such as the level of CO2 and the reduction state of organic carbon compounds supplied for growth (8.Falcone D.A. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2099-2108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Gibson J.L. Tabita F.R. J. Biol.

Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 620-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In general, growth under photoheterotrophic conditions, with a fixed (organic) carbon source, results in an excess of cbbII expression overcbbI . Maximal expression from both operons is observed under photoautotrophic conditions; i.e. when CO2 is used as the sole source of carbon, withcbbI operon expression exceeding that for thecbbII operon (12.Jouanneau Y. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 620-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to this apparent independent control of cbbI andcbbII gene expression, some form of interdependent control also exists, manifest by a compensatory increase in the expression of one operon upon the inactivation of the other (6.Gibson J.L. Falcone D.L. Tabita F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14646-14653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,8.Falcone D.A. Tabita F.R. J.

Lerchen R. Hessler P. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1749-1761Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cbbR gene, which is located immediately upstream and in the opposite orientation tocbbFI (13.Gibson J.L. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5778-5784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), mediates this compensatory effect, with the product of the cbbR gene shown to positively regulate the expression of both the cbbI andcbbII operons (13.Gibson J.L. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5778-5784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Dubbs J.M. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4903-4911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Superimposed on the requirement for cbbR is the regA-regB(prrA-prrB) two-component regulatory system, encoding sensor kinase RegB (PrrB) and response regulator RegA (PrrA). This system has also been shown to play a role in cbb regulation, based primarily on genetic studies in which a R. sphaeroides regBinsertion mutant was found to exhibit reducedcbbI and cbbII expression during photoautotrophic growth in a 1.5% CO2/98.5% H2 atmosphere (15.Qian Y. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 12-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the reg(prr) genes had originally been shown to regulate the anaerobic activation of operons encoding structural genes of the photosynthetic reaction center (puh) and light-harvesting complexes (puf and puc) of both R. capsulatus (16.Inoue K. Kouadio J.L. Mosley C.S. Bauer C.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 17.Mosley C.S. Suzuki J.Y. Bauer C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7566-7573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and R. sphaeroides (18.Eraso J.M. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2695-2706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it was most surprising to find that this same two-component system controlscbb expression. In addition, the reg genes, and close homologs, have also been recently shown to be involved in the regulation of nitrogen fixation in R. sphaeroides (19.Joshi Tabita F.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14515-14520Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 20.Qian Y. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4644-4649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Bradyrhizobium japonicum (21.Bauer E. Kaspar T. Fischer H.M. Hennecke H. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3853-3863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in controlling an operon involved in the oxidation of formaldehyde (22.Barber R.D. Donohue T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Current investigations are directed at elucidating mechanisms of gene regulation and cbb gene expression, with the R. sphaeroides cbbI operon serving as the primary model system for our studies on CO2 fixation. Previous work, using cbbI::lacZ promoter fusions, indicated that the cbbI promoter is comprised of a promoter proximal region (−100 to +1 base pairs (bp)) that is sufficient to confer low level and CbbR-dependent regulated expression of cbbI (14.Dubbs J.M. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4903-4911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CbbR was shown to bind to this region of the promoter in gel mobility shift assays. An additional promoter distal upstream activating region was identified, between −280 and −636 bp that significantly enhancedcbbI expression under all growth conditions tested. To further characterize the regulatory mechanism and to identify CbbR binding site(s) within the cbbI promoter region, in vitro studies with purified CbbR are required. Moreover, germane to our studies on cbb control was the isolation of an R. capsulatus regA mutant that showed increased photosynthesis gene expression under both aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions (23.Du S. Bird T.H. Bauer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18509-18513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This mutant encodes a RegA protein (RegA*) that exerts its effect independent of the cognate sensor kinase, RegB. Moreover, RegA* was shown to possess enhanced DNA binding activity relative to wild-type RegA. The increased DNA binding activity of RegA* made it possible to demonstrate the direct interaction of RegA* with discreet sites within the puc and pufpromoters (23.Du S. Bird T.H. Bauer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18509-18513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Because the interaction of RegA with the cbbsystem has not been investigated beyond the physiological and genetic studies previously described (15.Qian Y. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 12-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the potential to use purified RegA* for detailed in vitro studies was attractive. Thus, in this communication, we first identified binding sites for CbbR within thecbbI promoter proximal regulatory domain using DNase I footprinting experiments. Furthermore, after demonstrating the functional complementation of an R. sphaeroides regA(prrA) insertion mutant with R. capsulatus regA,in vitro studies with purified RegA* firmly established the presence of RegA* binding site(s) within thecbbI promoter-operator region. RegA* binding sites were found within both the cbbI promoter proximal regulatory region and the promoter distal upstream activating region. Moreover, the function of the promoter distal upstream activating region was found to be dependent on proper helical phasing with respect to downstream promoter elements. These results suggest that RegA interacts with the cbbI promoter at both the promoter proximal region (overlapping the CbbR binding site) and the previously described upstream activating region (14.Dubbs J.M. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4903-4911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A DNA-looping mechanism for cbbI activation is discussed. R. sphaeroides strains CAC (24.Paoli G.C. Tabita F.R. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 170: 8-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), CAC::regAΩ (15.Qian Y. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 12-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and CACΩ-C (this study) were grown photoautotrophically under a gas atmosphere of 1.5% CO2/98.5% H2 as described previously (12.Jouanneau Y. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 620-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Dubbs J.M. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4903-4911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).R. sphaeroides strains were also grown photoheterotrophically under a 100% argon atmosphere in Ormerod's medium supplemented with 0.4% malate (25.Ormerod J.G. Ormerod K.D. Gest H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1961; 94: 449-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Aerobic chemoheterotrophic growth was performed using Ormerod's medium supplemented with 0.4% malate while shaking vigorously in the dark at 30 °C. Growth on solid media was performed with the addition of 1.5% agar, and anaerobiosis was achieved using a BBL Gas Pak anaerobic system (Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, MD). Carbon starvation ofR. sphaeroides strains was achieved after transferring washed chemoheterotrophically cultured cells (OD660 nm1–1.5) to a culture vessel containing Ormerod's media lacking exogenous carbon, bubbled with 100% argon. Triparental matings were performed using helper plasmid pRK2013 according to methods previously described (26.Figurski D. Helinsky D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (2442) Google Scholar). Antibiotics were added to the media, as required, at the following concentrations (in micrograms/ml): for Escherichia coli, ampicillin (100–200), tetracycline (12.5), spectinomycin (20.Qian Y. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4644-4649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and kanamycin (50); for R. sphaeroides, kanamycin (50) and spectinomycin (20.Qian Y. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4644-4649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures were first grown to late exponential phase under chemoheterotrophic conditions. The cells were harvested, washed in minimal media, and transferred to either photoautotrophic or carbon starvation growth conditions for 72 h. Sonicated extracts ofR. sphaeroides CAC strains were generated in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were diluted to a protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, and the absorbance was scanned from 400 to 900 nm using a Beckman DU-70 spectrophotometer. Total protein was determined with a protein assay dye-binding reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). β-Galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (14.Dubbs J.M. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4903-4911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA) using a Bio-Rad Transblot semidry cell, as directed by the manufacturer. The blots were probed with antibodies specific for eitherR. sphaeroides form I or form II Rubisco (8.Falcone D.A. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2099-2108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), developed using the Vistra ECF fluorescent detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and visualized using a Storm 840 phosphorimaging system (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Extracts of E. coli BL21(DE3) (27.Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorf J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar) carrying the CbbR expression plasmid, pET11R-11, were prepared as described previously (14.Dubbs J.M. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4903-4911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Extracts prepared in this way were unsuitable for use in DNase I footprinting experiments due to the presence of significant levels of phosphatase. To remove phosphatase and other potential interfering substances, CbbR was purified by ion exchange chromatography using high performance Q-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). CbbR was eluted with a 0.1–1.5 m KCl gradient in buffer B (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.5, 300 mm potassium glutamate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30% glycerol) (14.Dubbs J.M. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4903-4911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions containing CbbR were pooled and subjected to gel filtration chromatography with a Superose 6 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (1 x 30 cm) using buffer B. The fractions containing CbbR were pooled and then dialyzed against buffer B and stored at −20 °C. RegA* was purified fromE. coli strain BL21(DE3) carrying the plasmid pET29CBD::regA* using a method previously described (23.Du S. Bird T.H. Bauer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18509-18513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). RegB“, a truncated form of RegB lacking a membrane-spanning region, was purified from E. coli strain BL21(DE3) carrying plasmid pET28alt::regB” (28.Bird T.H. Du S. Bauer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16343-16348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Soluble extracts were loaded onto a His·Bind resin column (Novagen, Milwaukee, WI), and the His-tagged RegB“ was eluted according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified RegB” was stored at −70 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 200 mm KCl, 10 mm Mg2Cl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50% glycerol. Probes for DNase I footprint analyses were prepared by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of selected regions of the cbbI operon promoter of R. sphaeroides, using p12EH (13.Gibson J.L. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5778-5784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a template. Selective labeling of DNA strands was performed by 5′-end labeling of one of the oligonucleotide primers with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) and [γ-32P]ATP (7000 Ci/nmol, ICN Biochemicals, Costa Mesa, CA) prior to amplification. The PCR reactions consisted of 1 μmol of each labeled and unlabeled oligonucleotide primer, 28 ng of template DNA and 2.5 units of Taqpolymerase (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Amplification was performed as follows: denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, then 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. A final elongation step was performed for 7 min at 72 °C. PCR fragments were purified on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels followed by electroelution. The isolated probe DNA was then ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in 100 μl of buffer containing 50 mmHEPES (pH 8.0) and 100 mm sodium acetate. DNase I footprint assays were performed as described previously (23.Du S. Bird T.H. Bauer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18509-18513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). RegA* was phosphorylated in a reaction containing RegA* (128 μm), RegB“ (128 μm), ATP (1 mm) in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 25% glycerol. Standard G+A DNA sequence ladders were generated by the chemical cleavage method as described by Ausubel et al. (29.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.1. John Whiley and Sons, New York1987Google Scholar). The sequences of the oligonucleotides used to generate the probes used for the CbbR footprinting experiments are as follows: cbbI-A, 5′-AGAAAGGGTTCACTGGCATC-3′; cbbI-B, 5′-AGCGAGGCGCTGCCCGCCAC-3′. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used to generate the probes used for the RegA* footprinting experiments are as follows: cbbI-C, 5′-CCCGAGACGGGCTCCTTCAC-3′; cbbI-F, 5′-AGACCACACCCAGCGTCACC-3′; cbbI-G, 5′-CCGCGGATCGGATTTTATGG-3′; cbbI-H, 5′-CGCTGCCCGCCACCGCCGCCACG-3′; cbbI-L, 5′-GGTCTCGACCGGGCGCTATTTCG-3′; cbbI-K, 5′-GATCAGCTGCTCGCGGTTGC-3′. In general, insertions in the cbbI promoter were introduced into the XhoI site of pUCC1, which carries a 720-bpEcoRI/BamHI fragment from thecbbI::lacZ translational promoter fusion pVKC1 (14.Dubbs J.M. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4903-4911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This fragment spans 664 bp 5′ to thecbbFI translation start, as well as 56 bp of thecbbFI coding sequence and contains the completecbbI promoter. EcoRI/BamHI fragments containing insertions were then ligated intoEcoRI/BamHI-digested pMC1403. The pMC1403 derivatives were digested with EcoRI and ligated into theEcoRI site of the conjugative plasmid pVK101 (30.Knauf V.C. Nester E. Plasmid. 1982; 8: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The plasmid pVKXFI was constructed by digestion of pUCC1 withXhoI followed by filling in the overhanging ends using Klenow polymerase and deoxynucleoside triphosphates to generate a 4-bp insertion. In the construction of 10-bp (pVKH10), 15-bp (pVKH15), and 21-bp (pVKH21) insertions, oligo pairs were synthesized such that, when they were annealed, each contained a central BglII site and single stranded, XhoI complementary, overhanging ends. The annealed pairs were ligated into XhoI-digested pUCC1. The resulting insertion derivatives were then digested withBglII, and the overhanging ends were blunted using mung bean nuclease (Life Technologies, Inc.). The sequences of the oligonucleotide pairs used in the construction of thecbbI promoter insertions are as follows: pVKH10, 5′-TCGACCAGATCTAG-3′ and 5′-TCGACTAGATCTGG-3′; pVKH15, 5′-TCGACCTGAGATCTGTCAG-3′ and 5′-TCGACTGACAGATCTCAGG-3′; pVKH21, 5′-TCGACCTGTCGAGATCTGCAGTCAG-3′ and 5′-TCGATCGACTGCAGATCTCGACAGG-3′. Purified RegA, more specifically RegA*, is only available from R. capsulatus. To use this protein for in vitro DNA binding studies with the R. sphaeroides cbb system, it was necessary to establish that theR. capsulatus regA gene could indeed complement a R. sphaeroides regA mutant. Cosmid pCSM9d, carrying the R. capsulatus reg locus (31.Sganga M.W. Bauer C.E. Cell. 1992; 68: 945-954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), was introduced into the R. sphaeroides regA insertion-mutant CAC::regAΩ (32.Qian Y. Coordinate Regulation of Carbon Fixation and Nitrogen Assimilation in Rhodobacter Spaeroides. Ph.D. thesis. Ohio State University, 1997Google Scholar). Although R. sphaeroides CAC::regAΩ was unable to grow under phototrophic conditions, the strain complemented with theR. capsulatus regA gene, R. sphaeroides CACΩ-C, regained the ability to grow under both photoheterotrophic and photoautotrophic conditions (data not shown). These results suggested that complementation with the R. capsulatus gene enabledR. sphaeroides CAC::regAΩ to use this source of RegA to support photosynthetic growth. Because RegA (PrrA) clearly regulates photopigment expression in bothR. sphaeroides (18.Eraso J.M. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2695-2706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and R. capsulatus (16.Inoue K. Kouadio J.L. Mosley C.S. Bauer C.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 17.Mosley C.S. Suzuki J.Y. Bauer C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7566-7573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), comparisons of the relative levels of photosynthetic pigment formation in R. sphaeroides CACΩ-C, R. sphaeroidesCAC::regAΩ, and R. sphaeroides CAC were made. Spectral analyses were performed on cell extracts of the three strains incubated under chemoheterotrophic, photoautotrophic, and anaerobic “carbon starvation” growth conditions (Fig.1). Although R. sphaeroidesCAC::regAΩ is unable to grow photoautotrophically, sufficient cell mass was added in the initial inoculum to allow for sampling of the culture and extract preparation. Incubation under aerobic chemoheterotrophic conditions resulted in low levels of photopigment synthesis in R. sphaeroides CAC, with slightly lower levels in R. sphaeroides CACΩ-C (Fig.1 C). R. sphaeroidesCAC::regAΩ possessed virtually no detectable photopigments (Fig. 1 C). R. sphaeroidesCAC::regAΩ also did not induce photopigment synthesis after incubating dark chemoheterotrophically grown cells under photoautotrophic growth conditions (Fig. 1 A); however, both strains CAC and CAC::Ω-C synthesized high levels of photopigments under photoautotrophic conditions. The level of photopigment synthesis for the complemented strain, R. sphaeroides CACΩ-C, was >50% of that observed for R. sphaeroides CAC. Given that R. sphaeroidesCAC::regAΩ is unable to grow photoautotrophically, photopigment induction was examined under conditions where all strains could be compared relative to their ability to support photopigment synthesis. This was accomplished by first growing all strains (R. sphaeroides CACΩ-C, R. sphaeroides CAC::regAΩ, and wild-type strain CAC) to mid-exponential phase under chemoheterotrophic conditions in the dark as before. These cells were then transferred to minimal media and incubated 72 h in the light while bubbling with 100% argon. Under these anaerobic, carbon-starved conditions, the pattern of photopigment induction in the three strains was identical to that found under photoautotrophic conditions, with wild-type strain CAC showing the highest level of photopigment induction, strain CACΩ-C showing somewhat lower induction, and strain CAC::regAΩ exhibiting no detectable induction (Fig. 1 B). The same extracts used in the photopigment expression studies were also used for Western immunoblots to determine the level of synthesis of both form I and form II Rubisco (Fig. 2,A and B). R sphaeroides strain CAC::regAΩ did not synthesize significant levels of form I Rubisco under any of the conditions tested (Fig.2 A), whereas R. sphaeroides CAC and R. sphaeroides CACΩ-C produced form I protein under both photoautotrophic and carbon starvation conditions. Western immunoblotting experiments using antibodies specific for R. sphaeroides form II Rubisco gave similar results (Fig.2 B). Previous gel mobility shift studies had indicated that CbbR binds to the cbbI promoter within 100 bp of the cbbI transcription start (14.Dubbs J.M. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4903-4911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To more clearly define the site of CbbR binding, DNase I protection assays, using 32P-labeled probes spanning the region from +40 to −133 bp relative to the cbbI transcription start were performed. CbbR protected two closely spaced regions, as seen by DNaseI digestion (Fig. 3). The first site (site A) is located from −14 to −35 bp, and the second site (site B) spanned from −41 to −65 bp. Similar regions of protection were detected on the opposite strand (data not shown). Previous genetic evidence indicates that the RegA-RegB (PrrA-PrrB) system is involved in cbbregulation in R. sphaeroides (15.Qian Y. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 12-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because a constitutively active RegA protein (RegA*) had previously been isolated from the related nonsulfur purple bacterium R. capsulatus and shown to bind specific regions of the puf and pucoperon promoters (23.Du S. Bird T.H. Bauer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18509-18513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we employed R. capsulatus RegA* in DNase I footprinting experiments of the cbbI promoter-operator. These studies were buttressed by the ability of theR. capsulatus regA gene to restore the ability of a R. sphaeroides CAC::regAΩ to synthesize both form I and form II Rubisco (Fig. 2). Using 32P-labeled probes covering a region of the R. sphaeroides cbbI promoter from +61 to −600 bp, it was shown that RegA* did indeed bind to the R. sphaeroides cbbI promoter at four distinct sites (Figs. 4,A–C). Protection at the first site (site 1) was found from −67 to −80 bp with the additional protection of two bands at −83 and −84 bp (Fig. 4 A). DNase I-hypersensitive sites were found within site 1 at −66 and −67 bp. The second site (site 2) was found in close proximity to site 1 and consisted of protection from −92 to −109 bp with a hypersensitive site located at −95 bp (Fig.4 A). The third RegA* binding site (site 3) protected the region from −302 to −327 bp with hypersensitive sites at −302 and −320 bp (Fig. 4 B). Site 3 always exhibited protection at much lower protein concentrations relative to the other sites, suggesting that this site may have a higher binding affinity for RegA*. The fourth site (site 4) is comprised of an area of protection from −400 to −414 bp with DNase I-hypersensitive sites at −408 and −411 bp (Fig. 4 C). We also detected a potential RegA* binding site overlapping the cbbFI transcription start, however, we were unable to clearly map this site in DNase I protection experiments (data not sh"

All three forms of PAK consist of an N-terminal regulatory domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain and are activated following binding of the small G-proteins Cdc42 or Rac1. Binding of the GTP-bound forms of Cdc42 or Rac1 to a specific site located in the N-terminal regulatory domain of the protein kinase disrupts an intramolecular interaction between the regulatory and the catalytic domain and induces autophosphorylation and activation of the protein kinase (3.Daniels R.H.

Rho proteins are mainly cytosolic, forming complexes with Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitors (Rho GDIs) that inhibit GDP dissociation and GTP hydrolysis; during the course of cell activation, the GTPases are released from Rho GDIs and translocated to the membrane (8.Bokoch G.M.

Members of the PAK family have been identified as physiological effectors of some of the cellular functions of Rac1 and Cdc42, for instance, cytoskeleton regulation (10.Sells M.A. Knaus U.G.

Besides the interaction with small G-proteins, there are other modes of PAK regulation, a fact that makes these protein kinases good candidates for the transduction of different cellular signals. Members of the PAK family contain two to five proline-rich elements in the regulatory region that can interact with Src homology 3 (SH3) domains. α-PAK binds the protein adapter Nck through one of its three SH3 domains (20.Bokoch G.M.

Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The α-PAK·Nck complex is localized in the particulate fraction of cell extracts, and becomes associated with epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor receptors following activation (22.Galisteo M.L. Chernoff J. Su Y.C. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20997-21000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Localization of α-PAK to the membrane results in activation of the protein kinase in 293 cells (21.Lu W. Katz S. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), and produces neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (23.Daniels R.H. Hall P.S. Bokoch G.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 754-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar); interestingly, this effect seems not to be dependent on protein kinase activity, as a kinase-inactive mutant of α-PAK can also induce neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (23.Daniels R.H. Hall P.S. Bokoch G.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 754-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). α-PAK (24.Bokoch G.M. Reilly A.M. Daniels R.H. King C.C. Olivera A. Spiegel S. Knaus U.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8137-8144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and γ-PAK (25.Tuazon P.T. Roig J. Gatti A. Traugh J.A. FASEB J. 1999; 13: A1490Google Scholar) can also be activated both in vivo and in vitro by sphingosine. Recently it has been shown that they may also be regulated by the heterotrimeric G-proteins (26.Leeuw T. Wu C. Schrag J.D. Whiteway M. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E. Nature. 1998; 391: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 27.Wang J. Frost J.A. Cobb M.H. Ross E.M. J. Biol.

Although there are many similarities between the different PAK enzymes, data are accumulating that suggest that they have different physiological functions and are differentially regulated in vivo. For instance, α-PAK has been shown to be activated by growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (28.Dharmawardhane S. Sanders L.C. Martin S.S. Daniels R.H. Bokoch G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1265-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and epidermal growth factor (22.Galisteo M.L. Chernoff J. Su Y.C. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20997-21000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), and by insulin, in a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase)-dependent manner (29.Tsakiridis T. Taha C. Grinstein S. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19664-19667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In contrast, γ-PAK is activated in response to stimuli that result in cytostasis or cell death, such as DNA damage (induced by ionizing radiation or DNA-damaging drugs) (19.Roig J. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31119-31122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) or sphingosine (25.Tuazon P.T. Roig J. Gatti A. Traugh J.A. FASEB J. 1999; 13: A1490Google Scholar). γ-PAK has cytostatic properties, as shown by microinjection of the protein kinase into frog embryos, which results in the arrest of cell cleavage (30.Rooney R.D. Tuazon P.T. Meek W.E. Carroll E.J. Hagen J.J. Gump E.L. Monnig C.A. Lugo T. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21498-21504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The activity of the protein kinase is high in frog oocytes (when compared with dividing cells) and is decreased following fertilization and in early embryogenesis (30.Rooney R.D. Tuazon P.T. Meek W.E. Carroll E.J. Hagen J.J. Gump E.L. Monnig C.A. Lugo T. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21498-21504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the γ-PAK homologue X-PAK has been shown to be implicated in the control of G2/M transition in Xenopus (31.Faure S. Vigneron S. Doree M. Morin N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5550-5561Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 32.Faure S. Vigneron S. Galas S. Brassac T. Delsert C. Morin N. J. Biol.

Binding of anti-Fas antibody to cells leads to constitutively activated γ-PAK (but not α-PAK or β-PAK) during early apoptosis by cleavage with caspase 3 (33.Rudel T. Bokoch G.M.

Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); activated γ-PAK is able to induce some of the morphological and biochemical changes characteristic of programmed cell death (34.Rudel T.

Thus, γ-PAK appears to be a potent apoptotic and cytostatic protein kinase, a fact that has not been reported for other members of the PAK family. Subtle changes in cell volume have been shown to influence the expression of numerous genes, including those encoding transporters and enzymes, as well as to alter the rate of proteolysis, protein synthesis, and cell growth (37.Waldegger S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 13645-13651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In recent years, it has become clear that numerous protein kinases are strongly activated by abrupt alterations in cell volume or extracellular osmolarity (39.Kultz D. Burg M. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 3015-3021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Shrode L.D. Krump E. Grinstein S. Lang F. Cell Volume Regulation. Karger Press, Basel1998: 79-93Google Scholar). For instance, hyperosmotic stress activates the MEKK-MKK4 pathway that activates SAPK 1/JNK (41.Matsuda S. Kawasaki H. Moriguchi T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12781-12786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), the Raf-MEK pathway that activates ERK (41.Matsuda S. Kawasaki H. Moriguchi T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J.

Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that at least some of these MAP kinase signaling pathways may be responsive to members of the PAK family (13.Zhang S. Han J. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Knaus U.G. Ulevitch R.J.

We show that hyperosmolarity promotes translocation of a portion of γ-PAK from the soluble to the particulate fraction of 3T3-L1 cells, where it becomes active. Activation, but not translocation, is dependent on the activity of a wortmannin-sensitive kinase. Translocation of γ-PAK parallels translocation of Cdc42 to the particulate fraction and can be induced in vitro by GTPγS and in vivo by co-transfection with constitutively active Cdc42. Co-transfection of inactive Cdc42 inhibits translocation and activation of γ-PAK in response to hyperosmolarity. α-PAK is not activated in response to hyperosmolarity in 3T3-L1 cells.

[γ-32P]ATP was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma or Fisher Scientific. The clone for the GST-Cdc42 was generously provided by Dr. C. J. Der, University of North Carolina (Chapel Hill, NC). Clones for Cdc42wt, Cdc42N17, and Cdc42L61 were kindly provided by Dr. J. S. Gutkind, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD), and were subcloned into pcDNA3.1+ vector (Invitrogen). In order to facilitate their detection, both Cdc42 and γ-PAK were expressed as HA-tagged proteins. 3T3-L1 mouse fibroblasts and 293T human embryonic kidney cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The effects of osmotic stress were measured in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (300 mosm) rendered hyperosmotic by addition of sorbitol or hyposmotic by addition of water. Control cells were maintained in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without sorbitol. Cells were harvested, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. HA-tagged γ-PAK subcloned in the PCDNA3.1+ expression plasmid (5 μg) was cotransfected with PCDNA3.1+ HA-Cdc42wt, HA-Cdc42L61, or HA-Cdc42N17 (5 μg) into exponentially growing 293T cells growing in a 10-cm dish, using Superfect reagent, according to the specifications of the manufacturer. Cells were thawed in 0.5 ml of freshly prepared lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm NaF, 5 mm Na4P2O7, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 nmokadaic acid), and protease inhibitors (40 μg/ml leupeptin, 40 μg/ml pepstatin, 40 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After 10 min on ice, the lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (soluble fraction) was collected. The pellet was redissolved by sonication on ice in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40. After centrifugation at 16,000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected and designated the solubilized particulate fraction. Total cell extracts were prepared by sonication in lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and removal of the insoluble pellet by centrifugation at 16,000 × gfor 10 min. Protein concentration of the fractions was determined using Bradford reagent. Proteins from the soluble and particulate fractions (25 μg) were separated on 12% polyacrylamide gels cast with 0.2 mg/ml of histone IIAS and treated according to the procedure of Kameshita and Fujisawa (44.Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). After 30 min in equilibration buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 30 mm MgCl2, 45 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm EGTA), the protein kinase activity was assayed by incubation of the gel in 1 ml of equilibration buffer containing 200 μm [γ-32P]ATP (2000 cpm/pmol) for 1 h at room temperature with rotation. The reaction was terminated by washing the gels repeatedly in 5% trichloroacetic acid and 1% sodium pyrophosphate. The radioactivity incorporated into histone was determined using a PhosphorImager system. γ-PAK, α-PAK, and p38 MAPK activities were assayed after immunoprecipitation from cellular extracts. The extracts (100 μg of protein) were adjusted to a volume of 100 μl with lysis buffer and incubated with 1 μg of antibody for 30 min at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected on protein G-Sepharose beads by rotation for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice in lysis buffer with 1% Nonidet P-40 and then once in phosphorylation buffer (see below) without ATP. For γ-PAK and α-PAK activity assays, the beads were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 2 μg of histone 4 (γ-PAK) or MBP (α-PAK), in a final volume of 30 μl of PAK phosphorylation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 30 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 200 μm [γ-32P]ATP 1000 cpm/pmol). For measurement of p38 MAPK activity, the beads were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 2 μg of MBP or ATF-2 in a final volume of 30 μl of MAPK phosphorylation buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 25 mm MgCl2, 25 mmβ-glycerolphosphate, 0.2 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 μm ATP 2000 cpm/pmol). The reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. The supernatants were applied to a 15% polyacrylamide gel, and the radioactivity incorporated into the protein substrate was determined using a PhosphorImager system. JNK activity was assayed after binding of the kinase to GST-c-Jun bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads, prepared as described (45.Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T.L. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2954) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μg of total protein were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with the beads. After two washes in lysis buffer with 1% Nonidet P-40 and one wash in phosphorylation buffer without ATP, the beads were incubated with MAPK phosphorylation buffer for 30 min at 30 °C. The reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. The radioactivity incorporated into GST-c-Jun was determined after electrophoresis as described above. Cdc42 translocation from the soluble to the particulate fraction was induced in vitro as described (9.Fleming I.N. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33067-33073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) by addition of 200 μm GTPγS to a cell lysate freshly prepared without centrifugation. After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, soluble and particulate fractions were separated as described above, and the distribution of Cdc42 and γ-PAK between the two fractions was determined by Western blotting. GST-Cdc42 (1 μg) was bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (30 μl) by incubation at room temperature for 25 min in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, in the presence and absence of 1 mm GTPγS. After two washes with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, the beads were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 100 μg of total cell lysate. After two additional washes, the amount of γ-PAK bound to the beads was determined by Western blotting. Western blot analysis of γ-PAK, α-PAK, and Cdc42 was performed as described previously (30.Rooney R.D. Tuazon P.T. Meek W.E. Carroll E.J. Hagen J.J. Gump E.L. Monnig C.A. Lugo T. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21498-21504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) using anti-γ-PAK N19, anti-α-PAK N20, and anti-Cdc42Hs (P1) antibodies. Detection of the primary antibodies was carried out with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies and ECL detection reagent. To evaluate the effects of hyperosmolarity on γ-PAK activity, 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were incubated for 30 min in serum-free medium containing 400 mm sorbitol. γ-PAK activity was measured with an in-gel kinase assay using histone IIAS as the in-gel substrate. When assayed in this way, γ-PAK activity was identified as a band of histone phosphorylation at 58–60 kDa. No other protein kinase activity was observed between 50 and 70 kDa. Under isosmotic (control) conditions, similar levels of γ-PAK activity (normalized per amount of total protein) were detected in the soluble and solubilized particulate fractions (Fig. 1 A, in-gel activity). In response to hypertonicity, γ-PAK activity increased 2-fold in the particulate fraction but not in the soluble fraction. Western blot analysis indicated that most (∼95%) of the γ-PAK protein was present in the soluble fraction (Fig. 1 A, Western blot). The proportion of γ-PAK protein associated with the particulate fraction depended on the external osmolarity. In control cells, only a small portion of the protein kinase was associated with the particulate fraction, whereas 3-fold more γ-PAK protein was associated with the particulate fraction of hyperosmotically stressed cells. To compare the specific activity of γ-PAK in the two fractions, γ-PAK activity (determined by in-gel assay) was normalized to γ-PAK protein (determined by Western blot analysis). Measured in this way, the particulate form of γ-PAK exhibited far greater activity than did the soluble form, both in control cells (32-fold) and in hyperosmotically stressed cells (25-fold) (Fig. 1 A, specific activity). Similar results were obtained when the activity of γ-PAK in the two fractions was assayed after immunoprecipitation using the specific substrate histone 4 (Fig. 1 B, activity after IP). With hypertonicity, γ-PAK activity in the particulate fraction increased 3-fold, whereas γ-PAK activity in the soluble fraction did not change. The calculated specific activity of γ-PAK was much higher in the particulate fraction as compared with the soluble fraction (Fig.1 B, specific activity), as described above for the in-gel activity. The Western blot data suggested that γ-PAK was translocated from the soluble fraction to the particulate fraction in response to hypertonic stress. Because the specific activity of γ-PAK in the particulate fraction was similar under isotonic and hypertonic conditions, the protein kinase appeared to be activated during or after transit to the particulate component. To determine the time course of the observed changes in γ-PAK in the solubilized particulate fraction, activity and protein were measured after immunoprecipitation following exposure of 3T3-L1 cells to hypertonic medium (Fig. 2, left panels). Hypertonicity increased both γ-PAK activity (2-fold) and protein (2.5-fold) in the particulate fraction within 5 min. Activity was maximal at 30 min and diminished thereafter. The effects of graded changes in external osmolarity on the particulate form of γ-PAK are shown in Fig. 2 (right panels). Degrees of hypertonicity as mild as 375 mosm, when applied for a period of 10 min, produced increases in both γ-PAK activity and protein to within 25% of the levels observed with 700 mosm. In contrast, hypotonicity (220 mosm) produced reductions in both γ-PAK activity and protein in the particulate fraction. Thus, γ-PAK appears to be modulated by both increases and decreases in external osmolarity. It has been suggested that the wortmannin-sensitive PI 3-kinase may be involved in the activation of PAKs (29.Tsakiridis T. Taha C. Grinstein S. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19664-19667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 46.Ding J. Knaus U.G. Lian J.P. Bokoch G.M. Badwey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24869-24873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The effect of wortmannin (47.Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar) on stimulation of γ-PAK activity in the particulate fraction is shown in Fig. 3. Wortmannin (200 nm) prevented the stimulation of γ-PAK activity in response to hypertonicity, as assessed after immunoprecipitation (Fig.3, top panel) and by in-gel assay (not shown). Whereas wortmannin blocked activation of γ-PAK, it did not inhibit translocation of the enzyme to the particulate fraction (Fig. 3,bottom panel). This suggested that the translocation and the activation of γ-PAK were two discrete events evoked by hypertonicity and that the activation but not the translocation of γ-PAK depended on the activity of a wortmannin-sensitive kinase. Because γ-PAK is activated upon binding to the small G-protein Cdc42, we tested whether translocation of γ-PAK to the particulate fraction in response to hyperosmolarity was associated with translocation of Cdc42. Soluble and particulate fractions from nontreated cells and cells incubated with 400 mm sorbitol for 30 min were prepared, and the Cdc42 content was determined by Western blotting. Fig. 4 A shows that in control cells, the majority of the Cdc42 (75%) was soluble. Hyperosmolarity induced a 2.5-fold increase in the amount of Cdc42 associated with the particulate fraction.

Here we present evidence suggesting that a conserved RING-H2 structure within ROC1 is critical for its ubiquitin ligation function. Mercury-containing sulfhydryl modification agents (ρ-hydroxymercuribenzoate and mercuric chloride) irreversibly inhibit the ROC1-CUL1 ubiquitin ligase activity without disrupting the complex. Consistent with this, these reagents also eliminate the ability of the Skp1-CUL1-HOS-ROC1 E3 ligase complex to support the ubiquitination of IκBα. Site-directed mutagenesis analysis identifies RING-H2 finger residues Cys42, Cys45, Cys75, His77, His80, Cys83, Cys94, and Asp97 as being essential for the ROC1-dependent ubiquitin ligase activity. Furthermore, C42S/C45S and H80A mutations reduce the ability of ROC1 to interact with CUL1 in transfected cells and diminish the capacity of ROC1-CUL1 to form a stable complex with Cdc34 in vitro. However, C75S, H77A, C94S, and D97A substitutions have no detectable effect on ROC1 binding activities. Thus, the ROC1 RING-H2 finger may possess multiple biochemical properties that include stabilizing an interaction with CUL1 and recruiting Cdc34.

The purified recombinant SCFHOS/β-TRCP-ROC1 complex specifically binds IKKβ-phosphorylated IκBα and promotes its ubiquitination in the presence of Ub, E1, and Cdc34 as the E2 conjugating enzyme. These studies demonstrated that ROC1 is the fourth essential subunit of the SCF-ROC1 E3 protein complex that is both necessary and sufficient to initiate the Cdc34-catalyzed substrate ubiquitination. Further experiments involving the use of a sensitive 32P-Ub incorporation assay revealed an intriguing biochemical property of the human ROC1. In the absence of a substrate, the purified ROC1-CUL1 subcomplex promotes Ub polymerization in the presence of E1 and Cdc34 (2.Tan P. Fuchs S.Y Chen A. Wu K. Gomez C. Ronai Z. Pan Z.Q. Mol.

In addition, missense mutations in ROC1 significantly reduced Ub ligase activity without affecting its interaction with CUL1 (1.Ohta T. Michel J.J. Schottelius A.J. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 535-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Recently, the ROC1-binding site has been mapped to the C terminus of CUL1 (amino acids (aa) 324–776) and the ROC1-CUL1 (aa 324–776) complex is fully active in supporting Ub ligation (7.Wu K.

These studies substantiated the role of ROC1-CUL1 as a core Ub ligase. In keeping with this, the yeast Rbx1/Hrt1 (ROC1) was shown to directly interact with Cdc34 (3.Seol J.H. Feldman R.M.

It has been shown by co-transfection experiments that ROC1 binds four additional cullin family members (CUL2, CUL3, CUL4A, and CUL4B), whereas ROC2 preferentially interacts with CUL5 (1.Ohta T. Michel J.J. Schottelius A.J. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 535-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). ROC1 is found to be a component of the pVHL complex (4.Kamura T.

Like the SCF-ROC1 complexes, the pVHL five-subunit complex supports substrate-independent Ub polymerization (11.Lisztwan J Imbert G. Wirbelauer C. Gstaiger M. Krek W.

In support of these findings, it has been shown that the ROC1/CUL1 interaction is most likely mediated by a direct contact between ROC1 and a consensus region present in all cullin members (7.Wu K.

Taken together, these observations suggest that the ROC/APC11 family members, through their combinatorial interactions with cullin/APC2, form a dimeric core component common to a large family of multisubunit Ub ligases. This core subcomplex functions to facilitate the transfer of activated Ub from a cognate E2 to targeted substrates. RING finger structures have been postulated to mediate protein-protein interactions (14.Saurin A.J. Borden K.L. Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem.

Here we present evidence from inhibition studies with mercury-containing agents and from site-directed mutagenesis experiments that demonstrate an essential role of the putative RING-H2 finger motif within ROC1 in Ub ligation. Plasmids expressing HA-ROC1, CUL1, HOS/β-TRCP, and Skp1 were described previously (1.Ohta T. Michel J.J. Schottelius A.J. Xiong Y. Mol.

Construction of the plasmid expressing both GST-ROC1 and CUL1 (aa 324–776) in bacteria will be described elsewhere. ROC1 point mutations in both the HA-ROC1 pcDNA or GST-ROC1 vector were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene Quick-Change) and verified by DNA sequencing. Human E1, mouse Cdc34 (mCdc34), and IKKβS177E,S181E were prepared as described previously (2.Tan P. Fuchs S.Y Chen A. Wu K. Gomez C. Ronai Z. Pan Z.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 527-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Cells (293T) were grown on 20 ml/plate (150 × 25 mm) Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Sigma), and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Life Technologies, Inc.). DNA(s) was transfected up to 40 μg/plate using the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method. For metabolic labeling, 40–48 h post-transfected cells were washed with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and starved for 30 min with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium withoutl-methionine/l-cysteine (Life Technologies, Inc.; 6 ml/plate) and 10% heat-inactivated and dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). The medium was then changed to include 100 μCi/ml Easy Tag Express-[35S] Protein Labeling Mix from NEN Life Science Products. Labeling was allowed to occur for approximately 2 h. Following harvesting of the transfected cells, pellets were resuspended in 0.4 ml/plate of buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml leupeptin), and the resulting suspension was sonicated (7 repetitive 20-s treatments). Buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1m NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml antipain, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin) was then added (0.6 ml/plate). The mixture was rotated for 60 min at 4 °C, and supernatants following centrifugation (at 100,000 × g, 4 °C, 60 min) were saved. Extracts, in amounts as indicated, were mixed with 10 μg of αHA (12CA5), and then protein A-agarose beads (10 μl; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) were added. The mixture was rotated for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with 0.5 ml of buffer C (buffers A and B mixed in equal volumes) and then two times with 0.5 ml of buffer D (25 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and 50 mm NaCl). Bound protein was released by boiling the beads for 3 min in the presence of 20 μl of SDS-loading buffer. Half of each reaction was used for SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Bacteria expressing GST-ROC1-CUL1 (aa 324–776) complexes were induced at mid-log phase with 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight at 25 °C. Following harvesting of cells, pellets were resuspended in125 volume of buffer E (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 mmDTT). The suspension was incubated on ice for 10 min, followed by sonication (seven repetitive 20-s treatments). Supernatants following centrifugation (at 17,000 rpm, 4 °C, 30 min) were saved. For GST pull-down, extracts, in amounts as indicated, were mixed with glutathione-Sepharose beads (15 μl, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The mixture was rotated for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with 0.5 ml of buffer E and then two times with 0.5 ml of buffer D. Bound protein was released by boiling the beads for 3 min in the presence of 20 μl of SDS-loading buffer. Half of each reaction was used for SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining, as indicated. The immunoprecipitated recombinant ROC1-CUL1 or glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST-ROC1-CUL1 (aa 324–776) complexes, prepared as described above, were added to a Ub ligation reaction mixture (30 μl) that contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaF, 10 nm okadaic acid, 2 mm ATP, 0.6 mmDTT, 5 μg of 32P-Ub, E1 (0.6 pmol), and mCdc34 (10 pmol). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min and then treated with 20 μl of 4× concentrated Laemmli loading buffer and boiled for 3 min prior to 12.5% and/or 7.5% SDS-PAGE analysis followed by autoradiography. Cdc34 conjugation was performed in a reaction mixture (20 μl) that contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm DTT, 2 mm ATP, 32P-Ub (200 pmol), E1 (0.2 pmol), and mCdc34 (7 pmol) in addition to the components as indicated. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and terminated with 7 μl of 4× Laemmli loading buffer (without DTT). Half of the mixture was then separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. All reagents (Sigma) exceptN-ethylmaleimide (NEM) were prepared fresh. For the Ub ligation assay, immunoprecipitated HA-ROC1 and CUL1 were treated at 4 °C for 15 min in a mixture (90 μl) of buffer D containing each sulfhydryl modification reagent or DTT at the indicated final concentrations. Pretreatment of ρ-hydroxymercuribenzoate (PMB) or HgCl2 with DTT was on ice for 5 min prior to the addition of HA-ROC1-CUL1. Post-treatment with DTT was at 4 °C for 10 min subsequent to PMB or HgCl2 treatment. Mock-treated or sulfhydryl modification reagent-treated beads were washed twice with buffer D before incubation with the Ub ligation mixture described above. Metabolically labeled extracts from 293T cells were used for examining HA-ROC1/CUL1 interaction in the presence of PMB and HgCl2or SCFHOS-ROC1 interaction in the presence of HgCl2. Extracts were immunoprecipitated and treated with PMB or HgCl2 as described above. Following treatment, the beads were washed with buffer D twice, and bound proteins were analyzed as described above. For HA-HOS interaction with phosphorylated GST-IκBα (aa 1–54), SCFHOS-ROC1 was anti-HA-immunoprecipitated. A32P-GST-IκBα (aa 1–54) mixture (15 μl), as described below, was mixed with the beads that had been treated with or without HgCl2. The mixture was then rotated at 4 °C for 30 min. The resulting beads were then washed with buffer C twice and buffer D once followed by SDS-PAGE analysis. The in vitroubiquitination of IκBα was carried out as described previously (2.Tan P. Fuchs S.Y Chen A. Wu K. Gomez C. Ronai Z. Pan Z.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 527-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) but with modifications. GST-IκBα (aa 1–54) (3.3 pmol) was phosphorylated by purified IKKβS177E,S181E (0.1 pmol) in a reaction mixture (30 μl) that contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.6 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaF, 10 nm okadaic acid, and 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP. After incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, the mixture was added to anti-HA antibody-protein A beads bound with CUL1, HA-HOS, Skp1, and HA-ROC1 derived from co-transfected extracts. ATP was also added at this stage to a final concentration of 4 mm. The second incubation was carried out by mixing at 4 °C for 15 min. Ub (300 pmol), E1 (0.6 pmol), and mCdc34 (60 pmol) were then added to the mixture, and the final incubation was at 37 °C for 60 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS-loading buffer (20 μl), and the mixture was boiled for 3 min. Aliquots of the reaction products (20 μl) were separated by 8.5% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. Glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST-ROC1-CUL1 (aa 324–776) complexes, prepared as described above, were incubated with purified mCdc34 (1 μg, 35 pmol) in buffer D (20 μl) for 60 min at 25 °C shaking. Beads were then washed twice with Buffer E and once with 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Bound protein was released by boiling the beads for 3 min in the presence of 20 μl of SDS-loading buffer. Half of each reaction was used for SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with a monoclonal αCdc34 antibody (Transduction Laboratories). The role of sulfhydryl groups in the ROC1-CUL1 Ub ligase activity was examined through the use of sulfhydryl modification agents, including NEM, iodoacetamide (IAM), PMB, and HgCl2. For this purpose, a previously established32P-Ub incorporation assay (2.Tan P. Fuchs S.Y Chen A. Wu K. Gomez C. Ronai Z. Pan Z.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 527-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 7.Wu K. Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Tan P. Gomez C. Ronai Z. Pan Z.Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1382-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) was used to measure the Ub ligase activity of the HA-ROC1-CUL1 complex, expressed and assembled in co-transfected 293T cells. As shown in Fig.1 A, HA-ROC1-CUL1 promoted the synthesis of 32P-labeled polyubiquitin chains (lanes 1 and 5), and this reaction required ATP, Cdc34, and E1 (lanes 2–4 and6–8). The reaction products were visualized as a protein ladder (lanes 1 and 5) that reflected incremental additions of single 32P-Ub molecules (∼12 kDa as the recombinant protein). To determine the influence of sulfhydryl modification reagents in this reaction, NEM (lane 10), IAM (lane 11), PMB (lanes 13 and 14), and HgCl2 (lanes 17–19) were mixed with the immunopurified HA-ROC1-CUL1 prior to the addition of E1, Cdc34, and32P-Ub. After a brief incubation, the unbound compound was removed by extensively washing the beads, and the ubiquitination reagents were then added to initiate Ub polymerization. The results indicate that while neither NEM nor IAM affected the ability of ROC1-CUL1 to catalyze Ub ligation (lanes 10 and11), both PMB (lanes 13 and14) and HgCl2 (lanes 17–19) inhibited the Ub ligase activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, the mercury-mediated inhibition was prevented by pretreating PMB (lane 15) or HgCl2 (lane 20) with excess DTT, while the postaddition of excess DTT to the mercury-treated ROC1-CUL1 complex did not restore the Ub ligase activity (lanes 16 and 21). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the mercurial compounds irreversibly inhibit the ROC1-CUL1 Ub ligase. This effect is possibly achieved through the targeting of sulfhydryl groups that are inaccessible to NEM/IAM. As shown in Fig. 1 B, all four sulfhydryl modification agents used inhibited the E1-dependent conjugation of Ub to Cdc34. In addition, immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that neither PMB nor HgCl2 affected the ability of ROC1 to interact with CUL1 (Fig. 1 C). Thus, the mercurial compounds specifically inhibited the ability of ROC1-CUL1 to support Ub polymerization in the presence of Cdc34. We have previously established that ROC1 is recruited by CUL1 to form the SCFHOS/β-TRCP-ROC1 E3 complex (with Skp1 and the HOS/β-TRCP F-box protein) that binds IKKβ-phosphorylated GST-IκBα (aa 1–54) and catalyzes its ubiquitination in the presence of Ub, E1, and Cdc34 (2.Tan P.

To determine the effects of mercuric reagents on the ubiquitination of GST-IκBα (aa 1–54), the SCFHOS/β-TRCP-HA-ROC1 complex was assembled in co-transfected 293T cells and bound to anti-HA antibody-linked protein A beads. Following a brief incubation of the mercurial compounds with the E3 complex, the unbound compound was removed by extensively washing the beads, and then the IKKβ-phosphorylated 32P-labeled GST-IκBα (aa 1–54) and the ubiquitination agents (Ub, E1, and Cdc34) were added sequentially to initiate the reaction. In the presence of E1, Cdc34, E3, and Ub, multiple 32P-labeled high molecular weight ubiquitination products were formed (Fig.2 A, lanes 2 and 3). Omission of Cdc34 completely abolished ubiquitination (lane 4), demonstrating the dependence of Cdc34 in this reaction. In keeping with their inhibitory effects on the ROC1-CUL1 Ub ligase activity (Fig. 1 A), both PMB (lane 5) and HgCl2(lane 6) blocked the SCFHOS/β-TRCP-ROC1-catalyzed ubiquitination of GST-IκBα (aa 1–54). As revealed by immunoprecipitation analysis, HgCl2 had no effect on the assembly of SCFHOS/β-TRCP-ROC1 (Fig. 2 B) or its ability to interact with 32P-phosphorylated GST-IκBα (aa 1–54) (Fig. 2 C). We conclude from these experiments that mercurial reagents specifically inhibit the ROC1-CUL1 core Ub ligase that is required for the ubiquitination of IκBα. Previous mutagenesis studies have demonstrated that none of the cysteine residues in Cdc53 (the CUL1 homologue in yeast) are essential for its biological function (16.Patton E.E. Willems A. Sa D. Kuras L. Thomas D. Craig K.L. Tyers M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 692-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that the observed mercury inhibition is mediated through its targeting on ROC1 cysteine residues. We employed site-directed mutagenesis to identify amino acid residues critical for the ROC1 interaction with CUL1 as well as for the ROC1-CUL1 Ub ligase activity. A panel of conserved ROC1 RING-H2 finger mutations was constructed, and the mutant proteins were expressed in both mammalian cells (Fig. 3 A) and bacteria (Fig. 3 B) and then analyzed for their ability to interact with CUL1. Cytomegalovirus-based vectors expressing wild type or mutant forms of HA-ROC1 were co-transfected with a CUL1 plasmid into 293T cells to allow for the assembly of HA-ROC1-CUL1 complexes. Following metabolic labeling, transfected cells were harvested, and derived extracts were subjected to anti-HA immunoprecipitation. The results showed that when co-expressed, HA-ROC1 formed a complex with CUL1 (Fig.3 A, lane 1). Omission of either HA-ROC1 (lane 2) or CUL1 (lane 3) from the transfection mix abolished complex formation, demonstrating the specificity of this binding reaction. Replacement of amino acid residues at Cys42/Cys45(lane 5) and Cys83 (lane 7) by serines, as well as replacement of His80(lane 10) by alanine reduced the binding of HA-ROC1 to CUL1 by 4-fold (quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA)). However, alterations in the other conserved residues tested, including Cys75(lane 6), Cys94 (lane 8), His77 (lane 9), and Asp97 (lane 12) maintained the full capacity of HA-ROC1 to interact with CUL1 as compared with the wild-type protein. Direct immunoblot analysis revealed similar levels of CUL1 protein present in extracts used for the above immunoprecipitation experiments, except for the H80A-containing lysates, where the level of CUL1 was 2-fold lower than the wild type. We have recently mapped the ROC1 binding site to the C terminus of CUL1, which spans amino acid residues 324–776, and have demonstrated that ROC1 complexed with CUL1 (aa 324–776) is fully active in supporting Ub ligation (7.Wu K. Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Tan P. Gomez C. Ronai Z. Pan Z.Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1382-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). When GST-ROC1 was co-expressed with CUL1 (aa 324–776) in Escherichia coli, the two formed a complex that was isolated using a glutathione affinity purification step (Fig.3 B, lane 1). The ∼33-kDa polypeptides co-purified were probably proteolyzed or prematurely terminated products of GST-ROC1, since they reacted with anti-GST antibodies (data not shown). To examine the effects of the RING-H2 finger mutations on the formation of the GST-ROC1-CUL1 (aa 324–776) complex, the same panel of mutations as described above was introduced to GST-ROC1, and the mutant proteins were isolated from bacteria that simultaneously expressed CUL1 (aa 324–776). As shown, GST-ROC1 bearing substitutions at Cys75, His77, Cys94, and Asp97 retained their full capacity to form complexes with CUL1 (aa 324–776) (Fig. 3 B,lanes 3, 4, 7, and8). In contrast to what was observed in transfected 293T cells, where C42S/C45S, H80A, and C83S mutations significantly reduced the ability of ROC1 to interact with CUL1 (Fig. 3 A), these same mutations still support the formation of complexes between ROC1 and CUL1 (aa 324–776) (lanes 2, 5, and 6). However, the yield of the complex carrying H80A mutations was reproducibly found to be lower than that obtained with the wild type (lane 5). This may reflect a reduced ability of this mutant to interact with CUL1 (aa 324–776) in bacteria. On the other hand, C42S/C45S and C83S behaved like the wild type in forming the ROC1-CUL1 (aa 324–776) complex (lanes 2 and 6). Taken together, these results demonstrate that none of the RING-H2 finger mutations examined eliminates the interaction between ROC1 and CUL1. However, C42S/C45S, H80A, and C83S may reduce the ability of ROC1 to interact with CUL1. The presence of high levels of these mutant proteins in bacteria may compensate for their low affinities in interacting with CUL1, thus promoting the formation of the complex. The ROC1-CUL1 complexes that carry ROC1 RING-H2 finger mutations were examined for their ability to support substrate-independent Ub polymerizati"

In the endothelium, VEGF exerts its actions by binding to two cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases, KDR (the human homolog of Flk1) and Flt1 (19.De Vries C. Escobedo J.A. Ueno H. Houck K.

Flt1 binds VEGF with high affinity but is poorly expressed by endothelial cells, making it difficult to detect, whereas KDR binds VEGF with somewhat lower affinity but is the more highly expressed and readily detected receptor (24.Bikfalvi A.

We previously demonstrated that VEGF promotes the tyrosine phosphorylation of a group of signaling molecules that contain SH2 domains and associated this process with endothelial cell proliferation (32.Guo D.

Thus, considerable insight into the functions and mechanisms of action of the VEGF receptors has been achieved. The present study was aimed at defining how expression of the VEGF receptors is regulated. We demonstrate that VEGF or tumor-conditioned medium down-regulates cell surface expression of KDR and Flt1 on HUVEC. Such down-regulation diminishes the ability of VEGF to stimulate MAPK (ERK1 and ERK2) and p38 MAPK activities. Whereas VEGF or tumor-conditioned medium down-regulated cell surface receptor expression, expression of the mRNAs for KDR and Flt1 was increased by VEGF or tumor-conditioned medium. Once VEGF or tumor-conditioned medium were no longer present, HUVEC rapidly recovered receptor expression and responsiveness to VEGF, a process of resensitization that was fully dependent on protein synthesis. The demonstration that loss of cell surface VEGF receptor expression and responsiveness to VEGF occur coincidentally with up-regulation of the VEGF receptor mRNAs indicates the operation of a homeostatic mechanism that replenishes cell surface receptor expression and restores HUVEC responsiveness once exogenous levels of VEGF are diminished.

F-12, MEM, and MCDB 131 medium were from Life Technologies, Inc. The HeLa line of human cervical carcinoma cells was obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA); HM-7 and LS LiM6 human colon adenocarcinoma cells were kindly provided by Dr. Young Kim (University of California at San Francisco) (17.Warren R.S.

Cells were grown and maintained in a 1:1 mixture of F-12 and MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin in a humidified incubator under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. To isolate tumor-conditioned medium, confluent tumor cells were washed and then incubated in serum-free F-12/MEM (1:1) for 72 h. The conditioned medium was recovered from the cultures, centrifuged to remove cell debris, and stored at −70 °C. To test the effects of conditioned medium, cells were grown in equal volumes of conditioned medium and F-12/MEM. HUVEC isolated according to the method of Jaffe et al. (42.Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (6001) Google Scholar) were grown on rat tail collagen type I (100 μg/ml)-coated tissue culture plates in MCDB 131 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 12 μg/ml bovine brain extract, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, and 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone in a humidified incubator under 5% CO2. Before exposure to VEGF or tumor-conditioned medium, HUVEC (passage 4–8) were washed with PBS and incubated with serum-free F-12/MEM for 8 h. The HUVEC were then incubated in serum-free F-12/MEM supplemented with human recombinant VEGF165 or a 1:1 mixture of tumor-conditioned medium and serum-free F-12/MEM. Human recombinant VEGF165 was coupled to125I in an IODO-GEN-catalyzed reaction (43.Fraker P.J. Speck Jr., J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3625) Google Scholar). Confluent HUVEC in 12- or 24-well plates were washed, incubated with serum-free F-12/MEM for 8 h at 37 °C, and then treated with VEGF or tumor-conditioned medium as described in the figure legends. After treatments, cell surface bound VEGF was dissociated from the HUVEC during three wash cycles with acidic PBS (pH 3) at 4 °C, followed by an additional wash with serum-free F-12/MEM. Control or treated HUVEC in ice-cold PBS, 0.2% bovine serum albumin were incubated with125I-VEGF in the absence or presence of a 200-fold excess of VEGF for 3 h at 4 °C. The cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed into 0.5% SDS, 0.2 n NaOH, and125I was assayed in a γ-counter (Beckman). Specific binding, the difference in radioactive uptake in the absence and presence of unlabeled VEGF, is normalized to the number of HUVEC in each tissue culture well. Confluent HUVEC in 60-mm dishes were washed, incubated in serum-free F-12/MEM for 8 h, and then treated with VEGF (20 ng/ml) or tumor-conditioned medium at 37 °C for 24 h. The cells were subjected to three cycles of acidic wash conditions (PBS, pH 3.0, 4 °C) and then to a final wash with serum-free F-12/MEM before incubation with 200 pm125I-VEGF in PBS, 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 4 °C. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (pH 7.4) before 125I-VEGF was covalently coupled to cell surface VEGF receptors by incubation with the organic cross-linking reagent disuccinimidyl suberate for 15 min at 4 °C (36.Kroll J. Waltenberger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32521-32527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The cross-linking reaction was quenched by the addition of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm glycine and 2 mm EDTA, and the cells were washed four times with ice-cold PBS and scraped from the culture dishes. After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 5 min, the cell pellets were lysed by incubation in 100 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, l mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin) for 15 min at 4 °C, after which insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation. Equal amounts of protein from each lysate were fractionated on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels, and affinity labeled complexes were detected by autoradiography. Confluent HUVEC in 10-cm tissue culture plates were starved for 8 h in serum-free F-12 MEM medium and then incubated with tumor-conditioned medium or VEGF for 24 h. The cells were exhaustively washed with serum-free medium, scraped from the culture plates, briefly centrifuged, and then solubilized into radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer as described above. Equal amounts of protein from the lysates were fractionated on 10% polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to Hybond ECL Nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The Western blots were probed with an antibody directed against KDR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and then incubated with a donkey anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The SuperSignal chemiluminescent detection system (Pierce) was used for protein detection. Confluent HUVEC in six-well tissue culture plates were serum-starved for 8 h at 37 °C and then exposed to VEGF as described in the legend to Fig. 3. The cells were washed with PBS and lysed into 200 μl of lysis buffer (1:1 mixture of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and 2× Laemmli buffer). The lysates were boiled at 100 °C for 3 min and centrifuged at 12,000 ×g (4 °C, 5 min) to remove debris. Equal amounts of protein were fractionated on 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes, which were probed with antibodies that recognize dually phosphorylated (activated) MAPK (Promega Inc., Madison, WI) or p38 MAPK (New England Biolabs). The blot was then incubated with anti-rabbit secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase, and the SuperSignal detection kit (Pierce) was used for protein detection. Confluent, serum-starved HUVEC were incubated with VEGF or tumor-conditioned medium for various times. Total RNA was isolated using the TRI Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. 10 μg of total RNA was fractionated on a formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to Hybond N nylon membranes. Specific 510-base pair Flt-1 and 1,100-base pair KDR cDNA probes were generated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the pT Adv plasmid (CLONTECH, California). The sequences of the cDNA probes were verified by sequencing using Thermo Sequenase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The 18 S ribosome RNA cDNA probe was a gift from Dr. Yuping Yang (Department of Pediatric Cardiology, University of California, San Francisco). The probes were labeled with [32P]CTP using a random primer DNA labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then used to probe the Northern blots. After autoradiography, films were scanned with a GS-700 imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The expression of KDR and Flt-1 mRNA is normalized to the level of 18 S RNA for each lane of the blot. Each experiment has been repeated at least three times with consistent results. To determine the effect of tumor-conditioned medium or VEGF on the expression of cell surface VEGF receptors, HUVEC were incubated with medium conditioned by HeLa or LS LiM6 cells or various concentrations of VEGF. The cells were then subjected to acidic washes to promote ligand dissociation, rendering cell surface VEGF receptors that had not been internalized available for interaction with subsequently applied 125I-VEGF. As illustrated by the data in Fig. 1 A, pretreatment of HUVEC with tumor-conditioned medium diminished the subsequent binding of 125I-VEGF 25 and 52%, respectively. Furthermore, 30 ng/ml VEGF diminished the subsequent binding of 125I-VEGF by 63% (Fig. 1 B), showing that VEGF down-regulates its own receptors and does so in a dose-dependent manner. Affinity labeling assays also evaluated the effect of tumor-conditioned medium and VEGF on cell surface receptor expression. By using disuccinimydyl suberate, an organic cross-linking reagent, we covalently coupled 125I-VEGF to VEGF receptors on HUVEC, leading to the formation of a predominant complex of 245 kDa and a less abundant 195-kDa complex (Fig. 2). By subtracting the contribution of 125I-VEGF (monomeric molecular weight 14,000) to these complexes, it was determined that VEGF bound to species of 231 and 181 kDa, which correspond with theM r values of KDR and Flt1, respectively. Analysis by densitometry revealed that pretreatment of HUVEC with HeLa and LS LiM6 conditioned medium inhibited the subsequent incorporation of 125I-VEGF into the putative KDR complex by 32 and 70%, respectively, whereas 20 ng/ml VEGF decreased complex formation by 66% (Fig. 2). Such treatments produced a similar effect on the amount of Flt1 available for complex formation with 125I-VEGF. The diminished incorporation of 125I-VEGF into affinity-labeled complexes induced by tumor-conditioned medium or VEGF was comparable with the degree to which these agents diminished the specific binding of 125I-VEGF to HUVEC (Fig. 1). Western blot analysis also evaluated the effect of VEGF or tumor-conditioned medium on cell surface VEGF receptor expression. In this procedure, lysates of control HUVEC or of HUVEC pretreated with tumor-conditioned medium or two different concentrations of VEGF were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were probed with an antibody directed against KDR (Fig. 3). Under basal conditions, HUVEC expressed low levels of the unglycosylated 150-kDa and higher levels of an intermediate 200-kDa form of KDR. The mature 230-kDa form of KDR was also detected at a level of expression between that of the unglycosylated and intermediate receptor forms (44.Shen B-Q. Lee D.Y. Gerber H-P. Keyt B.A. Ferrara N. Zioncheck T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29979-29985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of the mature form of the receptor was similar to that of the KDR within the affinity-labeled complex described above (Fig. 2). Expression of the immature and mature forms of KDR was down-regulated by tumor-conditioned medium or VEGF, the latter in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3). We could not successfully probe Flt1 expression by Western blotting, as an antibody with the requisite sensitivity and specificity for such analysis is not available. Our results show that VEGF receptor expression is regulated by ligand-induced down-regulation. We have demonstrated that KDR transduces the VEGF signal that leads to activation of MAPK (40.Wu L-W. Mayo L.D. Dunbar J.D. Kessler K.M. Baerwald M.R. Jaffe E.A. Wang D. Warren R.S. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5096-5103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). This led us to conduct experiments to determine whether the down-regulation of KDR, demonstrated above, was associated with desensitization of the ability of VEGF to promote MAPK activation in HUVEC previously exposed to tumor-conditioned medium or VEGF. To address this possibility experimentally, we first treated HUVEC with various concentration of VEGF for 10 min before proteins in cell lysates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were probed with the antibody that specifically recognizes dually phosphorylated (activated) MAPK. VEGF (1 ng/ml) increased the activity of both ERK1 and ERK2 in HUVEC. The stimulatory effect of VEGF on MAPK activation was maximal after exposure of HUVEC to 5–10 ng/ml VEGF, whereas higher mitogen concentrations elicited a diminished response. This latter effect may have been due to KDR down-regulation induced by exposure of HUVEC to the higher concentrations of VEGF (Fig.4 A). Pretreatment of HUVEC with 0–45 ng/ml VEGF for 24 h diminished basal activity of MAPK in HUVEC in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, such pretreatment with 15 and 45 ng/ml VEGF diminished the ability of a second VEGF challenge to activate MAPK by 40 and 46%, respectively, when compared with cells not pretreated with VEGF (Fig.4 B). Thus, down-regulation of KDR resulted in a loss of HUVEC responsiveness to VEGF, as evidenced by desensitization of MAPK responsiveness to VEGF stimulation. Northern blot analysis was used to investigate the effect of tumor-conditioned medium and VEGF on the cellular content of the mRNAs for KDR and Flt-1. As illustrated by Fig. 5 A, 24 h of exposure of HUVEC to medium conditioned by LS LiM6, HM-7, and HeLa cells increased the levels of Flt-1 mRNA by 2.5-, 1.7-, and 1.5-fold, respectively, whereas the level of KDR mRNA was increased 2.2-, 1.6-, and 1.5-fold. To determine whether the effect of tumor-conditioned medium was mediated by VEGF, tumor-conditioned medium was incubated for 2 h at room temperature with antiserum A4.6.1, which neutralizes VEGF activity; such treatment abrogated the ability of the conditioned medium to up-regulate the mRNAs for Flt-1 and KDR (Fig. 5 B). The neutralizing antiserum to VEGF, by itself, also somewhat diminished the basal levels of Flt-1 and KDR mRNA expression. This observation may be explained by the ability of HUVEC to constitutively produce a low level of VEGF, which would be expected to sustain expression of the mRNAs for the VEGF receptors; an unrelated antibody (αgD#952; Genentech), which is not able to neutralize VEGF, produced no change in basal or VEGF-stimulated levels of the Flt-1 and KDR mRNAs (data not shown). The time course over which VEGF induced up-regulation of the mRNAs for Flt-1 and KDR was investigated. As illustrated by the data in Fig.6 A, up-regulation was detected within 12 h of cellular exposure to VEGF and increased thereafter. Incubation with 20 ng/ml VEGF increased Flt-1 mRNA expression 1.3-, 1.6-, and 2.0-fold after 12, 24, and 40 h, respectively, whereas the levels of KDR mRNA increased 1.3-, 1.6-, and 1.8-fold over the same time course. The effects of VEGF on Flt-1 and KDR mRNA expression were also dependent on the concentration of VEGF to which HUVEC were exposed (Fig. 6 B). Here, up-regulation of both mRNAs was detected after exposure of HUVEC to 10 ng/ml VEGF, and the mRNA levels increased progressively with exposure to higher (20 and 40 ng/ml) concentrations of VEGF. Control experiments were conducted to demonstrate that the effects of VEGF on receptor modulation were specific. Thus, Northern blot analyses were conducted with human foreskin fibroblasts. These cells did not contain mRNAs for either KDR or Flt1 under basal conditions. Furthermore, exposure of these cells to VEGF did not result in the induction of mRNA for either of the VEGF receptors (data not shown). Thus, our results show that on HUVEC VEGF has opposite effects on the expression of cell surface VEGF receptors and the mRNAs that encode these receptors: the former are down-regulated in response to exposure to VEGF, whereas the effect of VEGF on the latter is quite the opposite, resulting in up-regulation. The time course over which cell surface VEGF receptor expression could be recovered after down-regulation was defined. To accomplish this, HUVEC were pretreated with 20 ng/ml VEGF for 24 h and then subjected to serum-free medium washes t"

The mechanisms by which different Ret isoforms (Ret-2A and Ret-2B) cause distinct neoplastic diseases remain largely unknown. On the other hand, forced expression of these mutated versions of Ret induces the rat pheochromocytoma cell line, PC12, to differentiate. Here we used an inducible vector encoding a dominant-negative Ras (Ras p21N17) to investigate the contributions of the Ras pathway to the phenotype induced in PC12 cells by the expression of either Ret-2A or Ret-2B mutants. We show that the Ret-induced molecular and morphological changes are both mediated by Ras-dependent pathways. However, even though inhibition of Ras activity was sufficient to revert Ret-induced differentiation, the kinetics of morphological reversion of the Ret-2B- was more rapid than the Ret-2A-transfected cells. Further, we show that in Ret-transfected cells the s uc1-associatedneurotrophic factor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation target, SNT, is chronically phosphorylated in tyrosine residues, and associates with the Sos substrate. These results indicate the activation of the Ras cascade as an essential pathway triggered by the chronic active Ret mutants in PC12 cells.

Specific mutations of the ret gene are the causative genetic events for the inheritance of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN)1 type 2A and 2B syndromes and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (4.Edery P. Eng C. Munnich A. Lyonnet S. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). MEN-2A and MEN-2B are distinct hereditary neoplastic syndromes both characterized by medullary thyroid carcinomas and pheochromocytomas. MEN-2A also features hyperplasia of parathyroid cells, whereas MEN-2B is a more severe disease, being associated with skeletal abnormalities, ganglioneuromas of the intestinal tract, and mucosal neuromas, and is also characterized by an earlier age of tumor onset (5.Goodfellow P.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 446-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Mutations in cysteine residues of the extracellular domain are the most frequent causative genetic event of familial medullary thyroid carcinoma and MEN-2A syndromes (4.Edery P. Eng C. Munnich A. Lyonnet S. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A single point mutation, which results in a Thr for Met substitution at codon 918 within the Ret catalytic domain, is responsible for the MEN-2B syndrome (4.Edery P. Eng C. Munnich A. Lyonnet S. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Each of these mutations convert Ret into a dominant transforming protein (Ret-2A and Ret-2B oncogenes) and cause constitutive activation of its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (6.Asai N.

In MEN-2 syndromes, the molecular mechanisms by which the mutated Ret alleles contribute to the development of neuroendocrine neoplasms remain largely unknown (9.Smith D.P. Eng C. Ponder B.A.J. J.

The inheritance of specificret mutations causes distinct disease phenotypes, thus suggesting that some specific cell types undergo abnormal proliferation depending on the type of Ret activation (either via a MEN-2A or via a MEN-2B mutation) (4.Edery P.

For Ret-2A, activation results from the formation of stable receptor homodimers linked by a disulfide bridge, whereas Ret-2B proteins do not constitutively dimerize and display altered substrate specificity (4.Edery P. Eng C. Munnich A. Lyonnet S. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 8.Santoro M. Carlomagno F. Romano A. Bottaro D.P. Dathan N.A. Grieco M. Fusco A. Vecchio G. Matostokova B. Kraus M.H. Di Fiore P.P. Science. 1995; 267: 381-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). The effects of tyrosine kinase receptors are mediated by the concerted activation of several signaling pathways including those of phospholipase C-γ, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and the Ras/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (also known as ERK) (11.Kazlauskas A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In the rat pheochromocytoma cell line, PC12, activation of the Ras signaling cascade is a prerequisite for nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced cell differentiation (12.Hagag N. Halegoua S. Viola M.

Even though it has been shown that Ras is implicated in Ret-induced neuronal differentiation, little is known about the contribution of this pathway to the biological effects triggered by Ret mutants in neuroectodermal cells (14.Califano D.

For instance, the expression of Ret active mutants and their causal function in neuroendocrine tumors, associated with MEN-2 syndromes, are difficult to reconcile with the dramatic differentiating effects observed when the same mutants are overexpressed either in PC12 or in human neuroblastoma cells (7.Borrello M.G.

On the other hand, a number of receptor tyrosine kinases induce phosphorylation in tyrosine residues of multiple-docking site proteins as, for example, IRS-1, IRS-2, SNT, and FRS2 (FGF receptor substrate-2), which, in turn, recruit enzymes involved in specific signaling cascades (26.Pawsons T.

Chao, Cornell University, New York, NY). The pvgf-CAT contains the vgf promoter, the 5′-noncoding and the first methionine (from −803 to +710) fused in frame with the initiating methionine of the CAT gene (32.Possenti R. Di Rocco G. Nasi S.

Expression vectors for Ret9C634Y and Ret9M918T (pRet9C634Yand pRet9M918T, respectively) were described previously (8.Santoro M. Carlomagno F. Romano A. Bottaro D.P. Dathan N.A. Grieco M. Fusco A.

PC12/MEN2A-Cl.3 and PC12/MEN2B-Cl.7 were transfected with the PMMrasDN plasmid together with pWLneo using the Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) as reported previously (30.Califano D. D'Alessio A. Colucci-D'Amato G.L. De Vita G. Monaco C. Santelli G. Di Fiore P.P. Vecchio G. Fusco A. Santoro M. de Franciscis V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The transfected cells were selected in presence of G418 (400 μg/ml) (Life Technologies, Inc.), and individual cell colonies were isolated and expanded. For transient transfection assays, cells were plated at 3 × 105cells in a 60-mm diameter tissue culture dish 24–36 h prior to transfection. The PC12 cells were transfected using the Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), as reported previously (30.Califano D. D'Alessio A. Colucci-D'Amato G.L. De Vita G. Monaco C. Santelli G. Di Fiore P.P. Vecchio G. Fusco A. Santoro M. de Franciscis V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7933-7937Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Transient transfections were carried out with 2 μg of reporter plasmid pKrox-24-CAT, together with 0.6 μg of pRet9C634Y or pRet9M918T, and with increasing amounts of pZipN17. PC12/MEN2AN17-R1, and PC12/MEN2BN17-R2 cells, were transfected with 2 μg of pvgf-CAT together with 8 μg of pBabe Ha-Ras either in presence or not of dexamethasone. In all experiments, total transfected DNA was kept constant by adding the empty vector. Transfection efficiency was checked for each experimental point by cotransfection with the pSV-Luc reporter plasmid, and measuring the luciferase activity. Cell extracts were prepared 72 h after transfection, and CAT activity was analyzed by thin layer chromatography with 95% chloroform, 5% methanol, as described previously (14.Califano D. Monaco C. De Vita G. D'Alessio A. Dathan N.A. Possenti R. Vecchio G. Fusco A. Santoro M. de Franciscis V. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 107-112PubMed Google Scholar). After running, the individual sections from thin layer chromatography plate, corresponding to acetylated and nonacetylated chloramphenicol, were cut from the thin layer chromatography plate and counted in a scintillation counter. For each independent experiment, the percentage of conversion to acetylated [14C]chloramphenicol was calculated and normalized for the transfection efficiency. Values from three independent experiments, each made in duplicate, were used to calculate standard deviation and plotted on an arbitrary scale as relative promoter induction. Total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy midi kit (Qiagen). 20 μg of total RNA were size-fractionated on a denaturing formaldehyde agarose gel and blotted onto nylon membranes (Hybond-N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The Ha-rasprobe used was excised from the PMMrasDN plasmid. To obtainKrox-24 probe, a 60-mer oligonucleotide was synthesized according to the published sequence and subsequently32P-labeled using the Klenow fragment of theEscherichia coli DNA polymerase and a 3′-terminal specific 9-mer. The vgf probe used was excised from the pV2–2 plasmid (32.Possenti R. Di Rocco G. Nasi S. Levi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3815-3819Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). 32P labeling of the probes was performed using a multiprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization and washing were carried out under stringent conditions: 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 60 °C. Autoradiography was performed using X-AR films (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −80 °C for 1–7 days with intensifying screens. Exponentially growing parental PC12 and PC12 variant cell lines were lysed with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing: 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate. Protein concentrations were estimated by a modified Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). 400 μg of proteins from each sample were immunoprecipitated with anti-ERK-1-specific antibodies (C-16, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) at 4 °C for 2 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed once with lysis buffer and twice with assay buffer (see below). The immunoprecipitates were assayed for kinase activity by incubating with 8 μg of myelin basic protein and 8 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 30 μl of assay buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 40 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 100 μm ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by adding 2× Laemmli buffer and proteins were separated by 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein gel was dried for 1 h at 80 °C and exposed to a X-AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Under our experimental conditions, the ERK immunoprecipitates were mainly (approximately 80%) ERK-1/p44 and, to a lesser extent, ERK-2/p42, as verified by immunoblot with the same anti-ERK-1 antibody (data not shown). Cells were seeded at low confluence on glass coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine (15 μg/ml) (Sigma). PC12 and PC12/MEN2 cells were either treated with 2-mercaptoethanol for 11 days or left untreated. PC12/MEN2N17 cells were treated with Me2SO (vehicle) or dexamethasone (0.5 μm). At 11 days, cells were washed twice with PBS (8 mmNa2HPO4, 2 mmKH2PO4, 2 mm KCl, 0.136m NaCl, pH 7.4), fixed for 20 min in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. After two washes with PBS, cells were stained with Hoechst-33258 (Sigma) for 5 min. After two washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted and analyzed with a Zeiss Axiophot epifluorescence microscope. For phalloidin experiments, PC12 and PC12/MEN2 cells were treated with 2-mercaptoethanol for 8 days or left untreated. PC12/MEN2N17 cells were treated with Me2SO or dexamethasone (0.5 μm) for 8 days. Cells were trypsinized and seeded on glass coverslips. 24 h later, cells were fixed and permeabilized as described above. Coverslips were incubated for 1 h in humidified atmosphere at room temperature with Texas Red-coupled phalloidin (Sigma), which specifically binds to polymerized actin. Between 106 and 107 cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS, then lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 1,5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm NaF, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 4 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 40 μg/ml aprotinin, and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. Protein concentrations were estimated by a modified Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of proteins (2 mg) were incubated with rabbit anti-Ret polyclonal antibody, as indicated, for 16 h at 4 °C and subsequently incubated with protein A-Sepharose CL4-B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed five times with the above mentioned lysis buffer and boiled in Laemmli buffer for 5 min before electrophoresis. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5% polyacrylamide) under reducing conditions and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore Co., Bedford, MA). Immunoblotting was carried out using either anti-Ret antibodies or anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibodies (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology), peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and detected with the Amersham ECL system (3.Colucci-D' Amato G.L. D' Alessio A. Filliatreau G. Florio T. Di Giamberardino L. Chiappetta G. Vecchio G. Fusco A. Santoro M. de Franciscis V. Cell Growth Diff. 1996; 7: 1081-1086PubMed Google Scholar). For co-immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-FRS-2 antibodies, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 40 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. 2 mg of proteins were precleared with rabbit IgG and protein G-plus agarose (Calbiochem), then centrifuged for 5 min at 2500 rpm; the supernatants were cemented with anti-FRS-2 antibodies (H-91, Santa Cruz) overnight at 4 °C and subsequently incubated with protein G-plus agarose (Calbiochem) for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) and blotted with anti-RET (C-19, Santa Cruz) and anti-FRS-2 (H-91, Santa Cruz) antibodies. Between 106 and 107 cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS, then lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm NaF, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 4 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 40 μg/ml aprotinin, and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min as previously reported (27.Rabin S.J. Cleghon V. Kaplan D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2203-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were estimated using a modified Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). The SNT protein was isolated from cell lysates incubating equal amounts of protein with p13 suc1 -agarose (Oncogene Science) as described (27.Rabin S.J. Cleghon V. Kaplan D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2203-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) for 3 h at 4 °C. p13 suc1 -agarose-captured proteins were washed three times with the above mentioned lysis buffer and boiled in Laemmli buffer for 5 min before electrophoresis. Captured proteins were subjected to 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, under reducing conditions, and transferred to polyvinylidene membrane (Millipore Co., Bedford, MA). Immunoblotting was carried out using either anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibodies (PY20, Santa Cruz), or anti-Sos1 (Upstate Biotechnology), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and detected with the Amersham ECL system. We have previously described the establishment of stable PC12 variant cell lines, PC12/MEN2A and PC12/MEN2B cell lines, which express the Ret9 active mutants, Ret-2A (Cys-634 → Tyr) and Ret-2B (Met-918 → Thr), respectively (30.Califano D. D'Alessio A. Colucci-D'Amato G.L. De Vita G. Monaco C. Santelli G. Di Fiore P.P. Vecchio G. Fusco A. Santoro M. de Franciscis V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7933-7937Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We decided to utilize two cell clones, PC12/MEN2A-cl.3 and PC12/MEN2B-cl.7 (hereafter named PC12/MEN2A and PC12/MEN2B), which express comparable amounts of the exogenous Ret mutants (Ret-2A and Ret-2B, respectively) (see Fig. 2 of Ref. 30.Califano D. D'Alessio A. Colucci-D'Amato G.L. De Vita G. Monaco C. Santelli G. Di Fiore P.P. Vecchio G. Fusco A. Santoro M. de Franciscis V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7933-7937Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, we transfected both these cell lines with an inducible expression vector, coding for a dominant-negative mutant of Ras (Ras p21N17). Transfected cells (PC12/MEN2AN17 and PC12/MEN2BN17) were selected for resistance to G418, and individual clones were subsequently isolated and analyzed. Dexamethasone-inducible ras transcripts were detected both in PC12/MEN2AN17 and in PC12/MEN2BN17 cell clones, and the induction of ras transcripts was determined at 6 h of dexamethasone treatment (Fig.1 and data not shown). For further analysis, we decided to use two representative PC12/MEN2AN17 (-cl.R1 and -cl.R3) and two PC12/MEN2BN17 (-cl.R2 and -cl.R6) cell clones. The magnitude of the Ras p21N17 mRNA induction largely varied among the clones analyzed. In the -R3 and -R6, the induction was between 8 and 10 times lower than in the -R1 and -R2 (Fig. 1). All PC12/MEN2AN17 and PC12/MEN2BN17 clones were morphologically indistinguishable from the parental cells (compare Fig.3 to Fig. 4 and data not shown).Figure 3Reversion of the PC12/MEN2 cell morphology upon tre"
https://openalex.org/W2117646763,"Insulin and related peptides are key hormones for the regulation of growth and metabolism. Here we describe a novel high affinity insulin-related peptide-binding protein (IBP) secreted from cells of the insect Spodoptera frugiperda. This IBP is composed of two Ig-like C2 domains, has a molecular mass of 27 kDa, binds human insulin with an affinity of 70 pm, and inhibits insulin signaling through the insulin receptor. The binding protein also binds insulin-like growth factors I and II, proinsulin, mini-proinsulin, and an insulin analog lacking the last 8 amino acids of the B-chain (des-octa peptide insulin) with high affinity, whereas an insulin analog with a Asp-B10 mutation bound with only 1% of the affinity of human insulin. This binding profile suggests that IBP recognizes a region that is highly conserved in the insulin superfamily but distinct from the classical insulin receptor binding site. The closest homologue of the Spodoptera frugiperda binding protein is the essential gene product IMP-L2, found inDrosophila, where it is implicated in neural and ectodermal development (Garbe, J. C., Yang, E., and Fristrom, J. W. (1993) Development 119, 1237–1250). Here we show that the IMP-L2 protein also binds insulin and related peptides, offering a possible functional explanation to the IMP-L2 null lethality.

BioEssays. 1992; 14: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Insulin-related peptides have been identified in both vertebrates and invertebrates, including mammals, protochordates, nematodes, mollusks, and insects (3.Chan S.J. Cao Q.P. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9319-9323Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 4.Ishizaki H. Suzuki A. Horm. Metab.

Endocrinol. 1993; 11: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Many of these hormones have been shown to act through receptors structurally similar to the insulin receptor, being heterotetrameric, membrane-spanning tyrosine kinases (8.De Meyts P. Wallach B. Christoffersen C.T. Ursø B. Grønskov K. Latus L.J. Yakushiji F. Ilondo M.M. Shymko R.M. Horm. Res. 1994; 42: 152-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 9.Fullbright G. Lacy E.R. Bullesbach E.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 774-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Modulators of this hormone/receptor system have been identified, as the IGFs are known to associate with high affinity to a family of circulating binding proteins (IGFBPs) that influence IGF availability and activity (10.Hwa V. Oh Y. Rosenfeld R.G. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 761-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). In addition, there have been reports of proteins with homology to the IGFBP family that supposedly bind and possibly modulate the activity of insulin (11.Yamanaka Y. Wilson E.M. Rosenfeld R.G. Oh Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30729-30734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Mammalian insulin is known to exert effects on various insect cell lines (12.Pimentel B., de la, R. de Pablo F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 855-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 13.Graf R. Neuenschwander S. Brown M.R. Ackermann U. Insect Mol. Biol. 1997; 6: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and porcine insulin has been demonstrated to bind to an insulin receptor homologue from Drosophila with ∼15 nm affinity (14.Petruzzelli L. Herrera R. Garcia-Arenas R. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16072-16075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This receptor has been cloned and demonstrated to be encoded by an essential gene involved in embryonic development both of the cuticle, as well as of the peripheral and central nervous systems (15.Fernandez R. Tabarini D. Azpiazu N. Frasch M. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3373-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 16.Ruan Y. Chen C. Cao Y. Garofalo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4236-4243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the insulin receptor pathway may be involved in controlling cellular metabolism inDrosophila (17.Bohni R. Riesgo-Escovar J. Oldham S. Brogiolo W. Stocker H. Andruss B.F. Beckingham K. Hafen E. Cell. 1999; 97: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). The Sf9 insect cell expression system has been employed extensively for production of recombinant proteins and has proved to be a good tool for expressing various insulin receptor constructs (18.Sissom J. Ellis L. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar,19.Paul J.I. Tavare J. Denton R.M. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13074-13083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When trying to express insulin receptor fragments inSf9 insect cells using a baculovirus system, we discovered insulin binding activity in medium from untransfected Sf9 cells. We were able to track down this binding activity and here describe purification, cloning, and characterization of a novel secreted 27-kDa protein that binds proteins belonging to the insulin superfamily and inhibits insulin activation of the insulin receptor. Human insulin and all insulin analogs as well as IGF-I and 125I-[Tyr-A14]insulin were from Novo Nordisk. IGF-II was from GroPep (Adelaide, Australia). The single-chain insulin/IGF-I hybrid (ICP) consists of insulin with C-domain of IGF-I; detailed description of this construct including purification is found elsewhere (20.Kristensen C. Andersen A.S. Hach M. Wiberg F.C. Schäffer L. Kjeldsen T. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 981-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Medium for cell cultures, fetal calf serum, Trizol®, and kits for 3′- and 5′-RACE were from Life Technologies, Inc.; DSS was from Pierce; and other chemicals were from Sigma. Insulin-agarose consists of human insulin coupled to Mini-Leak-Beads from Kem-En-Tek (21.Markussen J. Halstrøm J. Wiberg F.C. Schäffer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18814-18818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chemical cross-linking was performed essentially as described (22.Kristensen C. Wiberg F.C. Andersen A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37351-37356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Cell culture medium from Sf9 cells was incubated for 60 min at room temperature with 125I-insulin (0.3 nm) in presence or absence of unlabeled insulin (1 μm). Disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) in dimethyl sulfoxide was added from a 10 mm stock solution to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. After 15 min on ice, the reaction was stopped by adding 0.33 volume of loading buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol. Samples were incubated at 70 °C for 10 min before running on a 4–12% polyacrylamide Bis-Tris gel (NuPAGE, Novex). The gel was fixed in 10% acetic acid, 20% ethanol, and a PhosphorImager screen was exposed with the dried gel. The insulin binding activity was identified in conditioned medium from S. frugiperda(Sf9) cells. The Sf9 cells were grown in Grace's complete medium containing 2% fetal calf serum, and medium was harvested after 4 days. 2 ml of insulin-agarose was added to 800 ml of conditioned media from the Sf9 cells and incubated for 18 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking. The insulin-agarose was loaded on a disposable column (Bio-Rad), and sequentially washed with 20 ml of 10 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm Nacl, 20 ml of 3m urea, 0.4 m NaCl, 0.1 m citrate (pH 5.0), and 0.3 m glycine (pH 3.0). IBP was eluted with 0.5 m acetic acid. Purified binding protein was digested with the lysine specific Achromobacter lyticusprotease-1, and peptide fragments were separated on NuPAGE running in MES buffer and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for amino acid sequencing by standard Edman degradation (ABI 494 protein sequencer, Procise™). In addition, the binding protein was digested with A. lyticus protease-1 and fragments were isolated on an RP-HPLC column and sequenced as above. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers were designed on the basis of the peptides LFRMPTK and DTVDTFVYPLK to amplify DNA fragments encodingSf-IBP from total RNA isolated from Sf9 cells using Trizol® using the manufacturer's instructions (Fig.3). After RT-PCR, a combination of these two primers produced a PCR product that after sequencing proved to encode a fragment ofSf-IBP. Specific primers were subsequently designed to allow both 5′- and 3′-RACE to obtain a full-length clone encoding the high affinity insulin-binding protein Sf-IBP. Using PCR, Sf-IBP was equipped with a BamHI site upstream from its native signal sequence and a XbaI site downstream from the coding sequence and inserted into theBamHI/XbaI site of the pZem expression vector. After confirming the full-length sequence, the construct was transfected into BHK cells. The procedure used for stable expression in cultured BHK cells has been described in detail elsewhere (22.Kristensen C. Wiberg F.C. Andersen A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37351-37356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, the expression vectors were transfected into BHK cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), and, after selection with 1 μm methotrexate for 14 days, individual colonies were isolated and expression was tested using the insulin binding assay described below. Selected BHK clones were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% or 10% fetal calf serum. The IBP homolog found in Drosophila, IMP-L2 (23.Garbe J.C. Yang E. Fristrom J.W. Development. 1993; 119: 1237-1250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was cloned from a cDNA library (Drosophila, larva 5′-stretch cDNA library from CLONTECH) by PCR using an upstream primer with a BamHI site upstream from the IMP-L2 signal peptide and a downstream primer with a XbaI site after the stop codon. The PCR fragment was digested withBamHI/XbaI and ligated into corresponding site of the pZem vector (24.Andersen A.S. Kjeldsen T. Wiberg F.C. Christensen P.M. Rasmussen J.S. Norris K. Møller K.B. Møller N.P.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7363-7366Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). All sequences were confirmed by sequencing before transfecting into BHK cells. For binding assay, we used the polyethylene glycol precipitation assay. The Sf-IBP and IMP-L2 proteins were obtained from conditioned medium from BHK cells overexpressing these proteins, and Tn-IBP was from conditioned medium from HI5 cells (from Trichoplusia ni). For the binding assay, a suitable dilution of medium containing binding protein was mixed in a total volume of 200 μl with 5–10 pm125I-insulin and various concentrations of unlabeled ligand in binding buffer (100 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.05% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.025% (w/v) Triton X-100). After incubation for 16 h at 4 °C, bound counts were recovered by precipitation with 0.2% γ-globulin and 750 μl of 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, and bound 125I-insulin was counted in a γ-counter. The concentration of binding protein was adjusted to yield 10–15% binding when no competing ligand was added in the competition assay. The binding data were fitted to a single binding site model using nonlinear regression algorithm in GraphPad Prism 2.01 (GraphPad Software Inc, San Diego, CA). Wheat germ agglutinin-purified recombinant human insulin receptor was incubated in the presence of 4 nm insulin and 10 μm ATP for 45 min at 21 °C and increasing concentrations of purified recombinant Sf-IBP. Phosphotyrosine in the β-subunit of the human insulin receptor was detected by immunoblotting using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody RC20 (Transduction Laboratories). For blotting, samples were mixed with 0.33 volumes of loading buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol and incubated at 70 °C for 10 min before loading on a 4–12% polyacrylamide Bis-Tris gel (NuPAGE, Novex). After electrophoresis, proteins were blotted onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) and incubated with RC20 antibody conjugated to peroxidase and finally immunoreactive protein was detected using ECL reagent from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The Western blot was visualized on a Luminescent Image Analyzer LAS-1000 (Fujifilm) and quantified using Image Gauge software (Fujifilm). Labeled insulin was chemically cross-linked with DSS to binding protein present in conditioned medium from Sf9 cell cultures, and the gel is shown in Fig. 1. The cross-linking pattern shows specific binding of insulin tracer to a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 30 kDa (binding protein + A-chain of insulin), whereas in the sample from control media no band is seen. Conditioned medium from Sf9 cell cultures was applied to an insulin-agarose column, and after extensive washing, a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 27 kDa was eluted with 0.5 m acetic acid (Fig. 2). This protein bound insulin with similar binding affinity as the original binding activity found in the conditioned media from the Sf9 cell culture (data not shown). Purified Sf-IBP was digested with A. lyticusprotease-1, and peptide fragments were separated either on polyacrylamide gels or by RP-HPLC and sequenced. Degenerate primers were designed from the peptide sequences of the proteolytic fragments of the purifiedSf-IBP protein. mRNA was isolated from Sf9 cells, and, after RT-PCR, several combinations of primers were used to attempt to amplify a fragment of Sf-IBP cDNA. One combination of primers derived from peptides LFRMPTK and DTVDTFVYPLK resulted in a DNA fragment that when sequenced proved to encode a part of Sf-IBP (Fig. 3). Specific primers were designed from this DNA fragment that allowed the cloning of a cDNA encoding full-length Sf-IBP using 3′- and 5′-RACE (Fig. 3). Performing a similarity search using BLASTP (25.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59856) Google Scholar) in the Non-Redundant GenBank™ data base revealed that IMP-L2 from Drosophila had the highest similarity (Fig.4 A), followed by three predicted open reading frames from Caenorhabditis elegans. The amino acid identity of Sf-IBP and IMP-L2 is 33% within in the mature proteins (positives 51%,E-value 4 × 10−32). Furthermore,Sf-IBP was found to be structurally similar to IMP-L2 as well as the three putative C. elegans proteins, all encoding secreted proteins composed of two Ig-like C2 domains and a predicted molecular mass around 27 kDa (Fig. 4 B). Binding curves are shown in Figs. 5 and6, and an overview of all binding affinities is presented in Table I. For ligand binding analysis, we selected the naturally occurring insulin-like peptides proinsulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II, as well as insulin analogs with very high (X92, X10) (26.Schäffer L. Eur. J.

Open table in a new tab The affinity (EC50) of Sf-IBP for insulin was 0.07 nm, which is slightly higher affinity than found for IGF-I (0.17 nm) and for IGF-II (0.37 nm). The insulin analogs mini-proinsulin, X145, X137, and ICP all bound toSf-IBP with higher affinity than insulin, proinsulin bound with similar affinity, whereas X92 and X10 had much poorer affinity than insulin. The homologous binding protein from Drosophila, IMP-L2, was also cloned and overexpressed in BHK cells. The affinity of IMP-L2 for insulin was 81 nm, which is a shift of almost 1000-fold as compared with Sf-IBP. This shift in affinity was parallel within the insulin analogs; again, the X145 analog had the highest affinity (17 nm), and the X92 and X10 analogs had low affinities. For the IMP-L2 protein, the IGF-I and IGF-II had slightly higher affinity than insulin, with 17 nm for IGF-I and 42 nm for IGF-II. In addition to the binding proteins from S. frugiperda andDrosophila, we also found insulin binding activity in medium from the HI5 cell line that is derived from the cabbage looper,T. ni. The initial characterization clearly suggests that the binding activity from the HI5 cells involves a binding protein homologous to Sf-IBP and IMP-L2, and therefore we called itTn-IBP. This is based on three lines of evidence. First of all, cross-linking experiments show that insulin binds specifically to a 27-kDa protein (data not shown); second, the binding data (Table I) clearly demonstrate high affinity binding of insulin; and, finally, we have several peptide fragment sequences (data not shown) that are homologous to the two cloned binding proteins. Tn-IBP was found to bind insulin with very high affinity; the EC50 was calculated to be 16 pm, which is about the highest affinity we can estimate with the present assay, and for X145 and proinsulin we observed even higher affinities. The overall picture for insulin and its analogs is the same relative affinities as observed with Sf-IBP and IMP-L2 but, in contrast to these, we found that Tn-IBP had quite low affinity for the IGF peptides, these having 1000–10,000-fold losses in affinity as compared with insulin. The poor affinity of IGF-I is not due to the presence of the IGF-I C-domain because the insulin analog ICP, which is insulin with the C-domain of IGF-I, binds with high affinity toTn-IBP. The X92 analog, which is a superpotent insulin receptor ligand (26.Schäffer L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), comprises three substitutions that each increase affinity for the human insulin receptor, His-A8, Asp-B10, and Tyr-B25-amide (26.Schäffer L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), but for the three insect binding proteins, the His-A8 (data not shown) and Tyr-B25-amide (X137) substitutions do not influence affinity dramatically, whereas the Asp-B10 mutation (X10) causes a 50–100-fold loss in affinity for the binding proteins relative to insulin. The two insulin analogs, X145 and mini-proinsulin, are known to be almost completely inactive in biological assays (27.Derewenda U. Derewenda Z. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Bing X. Markussen J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 28.De Meyts P. Van Obberghen E. Roth J. Wollmer A. Brandenburg D. Nature. 1978; 273: 504-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), but for the three insect binding proteins these analogs exhibited affinities similar to or higher than that of insulin, demonstrating that the binding surface involved is quite different from that which binds to the human insulin receptor (29.Kristensen C. Kjeldsen T. Wiberg F.C. Schäffer L. Hach M. Havelund S. Bass J. Steiner D.F. Andersen A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12978-12983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). When wheat germ agglutinin-purified recombinant human insulin receptor is incubated with insulin and increasing concentrations of Sf-IBP (purified from conditioned media from transfected BHK cells) a dose-dependent inhibition of insulin receptor autophosphorylation is seen (Fig.7 A). The concentration ofSf-IBP was estimated from competition binding assays. The inhibition data (quantified on a FujiImager) was fitted to a one-site competition model using nonlinear regression algorithm in GraphPad Prism 2.01. 50% inhibition was seen using ∼9 nm Sf-IBP, which compares well to the 4 nm insulin used for the autophosphorylation (Fig. 7 B). When trying to express insulin receptor fragments inSf9 insect cells using a baculovirus system, we discovered insulin binding activity in medium from Sf9 cells that had not been transfected. Purification of the binding activity on an insulin-mini-leak column, followed by limited proteolytic digestion and amino acid sequencing of resulting fragments, allowed us to obtain a cDNA encoding a novel insulin-binding protein. This protein was named Sf-IBP (for S. f rugiperda insulin-related peptide-binding protein) and is composed of two Ig-like C2 domains (Fig. 3). Searching for similar proteins in the Non-Redundant GenBank™ data base revealed that IMP-L2 fromDrosophila had the highest homology (Fig. 4). In addition,Sf-IBP had homology to three open reading frames fromC. elegans encoding secreted proteins with predicted molecular mass of ∼27 kDa. The IMP-L2 and one C. elegansgene product were expressed in BHK cells, but only IMP-L2 showed detectable insulin binding. Many other homologous proteins are found in the data bank including a number of cell surface receptors, but these are all probably only structurally related due to the Ig-like C2-domains, and not necessarily functionally related. In addition to S. frugiperda and Drosophila, we also found insulin binding activity in medium from the HI5 cell line, which is derived from the cabbage looper, T. ni. The initial characterization clearly suggests that the binding activity from theT. ni cells involves a binding protein homologous toSf-IBP and IMP-L2. We have called the T. nibinding protein Tn-IBP. With the identification of homologous insulin-binding proteins from three different insect organisms, we suggest that insulin-binding proteins containing Ig-like C2 domains may be present in all insects. The binding data show that Sf-IBP and Tn-IBP have very high affinity for insulin (lower picomolar range), whereas IMP-L2 has an affinity of 80 nm for insulin. When looking at the other insulin-like peptides including the naturally occurring human peptides IGF-I, IGF-II, and proinsulin, as well as the synthetic insulin analogs, the overall picture is that these ligands generally all have affinities close to insulin affinity for the respective binding protein. However, there are a few dramatic deviations from this general pattern; most strikingly, Tn-IBP has approximately 4000-fold poorer affinity for IGF-I and IGF-II than for insulin. The other exception is that insulin analogs with the Asp-B10 mutation (X92 and X10) have lost 10–100-fold in binding affinity. The synthetic insulin analogs selected for initial characterization of the new insulin-binding protein family are characterized by aberrant behavior in binding to the human insulin receptor. The X92 analog is a superpotent receptor binder (26.Schäffer L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar); the high affinity for the receptor is an additive effect obtained by combining mutations in positions B10 and A8 with deletion of B26–B30 and amidation of Tyr-B25. In contrast, for the IBPs the X92 had lower affinity and the X10 analog demonstrates that the poor affinity is due to the Asp-B10 mutation. The deleterious effect of the Asp-B10 mutation on Sf-IBP binding and the fact that des-octa peptide insulin (X145) bind with even higher affinity than insulin clearly suggests thatSf-IBP recognize a region of insulin that is highly conserved in the insulin superfamily but distinct from the classical receptor binding site (which involves, among others, the C-terminal B23–B26 region of the insulin B-chain). When allowed to compete for insulin in an insulin receptor autophosphorylation assay, Sf-IBP acts as an inhibitor of insulin action (Fig. 7). This observation points to a function ofSf-IBP and related proteins in inhibiting or modulating the effect of a putative insect insulin-related peptide. Searching the recently completed Drosophila genome for insulin-related peptide reveals one cluster of four genes similar to clusters found in Bombyx mori (30.Kawakami A. Iwami M. Nagasawa H. Suzuki A. Ishizaki H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6843-6847Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) as well as a single insulin-related gene (data not shown). The proteins encoded from these genes share properties with the bombyxins and relaxins in that the C terminus of the B-chain is very divergent from the sequence found in insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II. The results of our binding studies with des-octa peptide insulin show that this part of the insulin molecule has no importance for its binding to IMP-L2. IMP-L2 has previously been studied by Fristrom and co-workers (23.Garbe J.C. Yang E. Fristrom J.W. Development. 1993; 119: 1237-1250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Osterbur D.L. Fristrom D.K. Natzle J.E. Tojo S.J. Fristrom J.W. Dev. Biol. 1988; 129: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). IMP-L2 is characterized as being induced by the molting hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone and implicated in epithelial spreading and fusion. Garbe et al. found expression of IMP-L2 in neuronal cells. Genetic analysis demonstrated that IMP-L2 is an essential gene inDrosophila, as disruptions of this gene result in embryonic lethality (23.Garbe J.C. Yang E. Fristrom J.W. Development. 1993; 119: 1237-1250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, no morphological abnormalities were evident in the embryos, and the authors concluded that they had not identified the cause of lethality in IMP-L2 null Drosophila. Our characterization of IMP-L2 suggests that this protein may be involved in regulating the availability or activity of a Drosophilainsulin-like peptide, and that lack of IMP-L2 causes a defective signaling through the Drosophila insulin receptor that in turn leads to the observed lethal phenotype. Bombyxins are known to stimulate prothoractic glands of the insectSamia cynthia ricini to synthesize and release the molting hormone ecdysteroid (32.Nagata K. Maruyama K. Kojima K. Yamamoto M. Tanaka M. Kataoka H. Nagasawa H. Isogai A. Ishizaki H. Suzuki A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Since 20-hydroxyecdysone induces synthesis of IMP-L2 in Drosophila, it is tempting to speculate that this could provide a regulatory circuit in insect, whereby an insulin-related peptide can regulate the expression of a protein (e.g. IMP-L2) that in turn can regulate the effect of the hormone. One putative low affinity insulin-binding protein, Mac25, has previously been described (11.Yamanaka Y. Wilson E.M. Rosenfeld R.G. Oh Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30729-30734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This protein was found based on its homology to classical IGF1-binding proteins. Mac25 was shown to bind both insulin IGF-I and IGF-II after recombinant overexpression in insect cell lines (HI5 and Sf9). In addition to the domain with homology to IGFBPs, Mac25 also possess a C-terminal Ig-like C2-domain. This domain has very low similarity to the Ig-like C2 domains of Sf-IBP and IMP-L2. We have expressed this protein with a FLAG tag in Sf9 cells to allow easy purification. However, when separated from the Sf-IBP insulin binding activity, we could not detect any binding of either insulin or IGF-1 to Mac25, suggesting that, if Mac25 binds insulin or IGF-I, the affinity must be below our detection limit of approximately 0.1 μm. Mac25 was also overexpressed in BHK cells with similar negative results on insulin binding (data not shown). We have searched the NCBI data base for other Sf-IBP and IMP-L2 homologues, but so far we have only identified three open reading frames from C. elegans that encode secreted proteins composed of two Ig-like C2 domains and a predicted molecular mass around 27 kDa. We have expressed one of these proteins but have not been able to detect insulin binding to this (data not shown). Thus, the possibility remains that this family of IBPs is limited to insects and serves a function that is specific to this class. If a human homologue should exist that is involved in binding proteins belonging to the insulin superfamily, such a protein could be involved in certain disease states (e.g. diabetes or cancer) and as such would represent an obvious and attractive target for drug development. During the preparation of this manuscript, an article appeared describing insulin binding activity in media fromSf9 cells (33.Doverskog M. Tally M. Haggstrom L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 674-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This binding activity was characterized by cross-linking and Western ligand blotting as having a molecular weight of approximately 27 kDa and thus appears to be the same binding protein as Sf-IBP. The authors, however, reported the affinity for insulin as being ∼5 nm, in contrast to our observed affinity of 70 pm. We have no explanation for this discrepancy, but one possible cause could be the difference in binding assay employed. In this study we have used a polethylene glycol precipitation assay, whereas a charcoal-based assay was used by Doverskog et al. (33.Doverskog M. Tally M. Haggstrom L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 674-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We thank Elisabeth Veyhe Andersen, Else Jost Jensen, and Lene Walander for excellent technical support.

One of the early signaling events is a biphasic increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels ([Ca2+]i), which is characterized by a high transient spike of [Ca2+]i followed by a long-lasting plateau phase (1.Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1995; 30: 281-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 2.Guse A.H. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 18: 419-448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is believed that the initial phase of Ca2+ response is attributable to the action of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) that releases Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Next, depletion of the ER Ca2+ store signals an influx of Ca2+across the plasma membrane to sustain the wave of Ca2+signaling. Three discrete mechanisms have been proposed for the sustained inflow of Ca2+ (2.Guse A.H. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 18: 419-448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). First, Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptors are present on the plasma membranes of T lymphocytes (3.Kuno M. Gardner P. Nature. 1987; 326: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 4.Khan A.A. Steiner J.P. Klein M.G. Schneider M.F. Snyder S.H. Science. 1992; 257: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 5.Khan A.A. Steiner J.P. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2849-2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, Ins(1,4,5)P3 may play a dual role of releasing Ca2+ from ER stores and stimulating Ca2+ influx across plasma membranes concurrently. Second, the capacitative Ca2+ entry model (6.Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2077) Google Scholar) dictates that the emptying of the intracellular Ca2+ store is coupled, either directly through conformational coupling or indirectly via diffusable factors, to the Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+channel (7.Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6295-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar, 8.Premack B.A. McDonald T.V. Gardner P. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5226-5240PubMed Google Scholar). Third, a TCR-operated Ca2+ entry (TROCE) mechanism is activated in response to TCR-CD3 stimulation (2.Guse A.H. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 18: 419-448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this putative pathway is less well characterized. It is known to be independent of the depletion of intracellular Ca2+ and inhibited by SKF96365, a Ca2+ channel blocker, and phorbol esters (9.Sei Y. Takemura M. Gusovsky F. Skolnick P. Basile A. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 216: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this paper, we present data suggesting a new function of phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase in T cell Ca2+ regulation via a PI(3,4,5)P3-sensitive Ca2+ entry mechanism. In response to TCR activation, PI 3-kinase and other signaling molecules such as PLC-γ1 are recruited to the plasma membrane to form multifunctional complexes (10.de Aos I. Metzger M.H. Exley M.

Activation of PI 3-kinase results in a transient accumulation of μm levels of PI(3,4,5)P3 and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2), both absent in quiescent T cells (13.Ward S.G. Ley S.C. MacPhee C. Cantrell D.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To date, a clear consensus on the mode of action of these lipid messengers in regulating TCR signaling has yet to emerge. Putative downstream effectors for PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2 in receptor-stimulated signaling include Ca2+-independent PKC isozymes (δ, ε, η, ζ), PLC-γ, Akt, and so forth (14.Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). The results of this study suggest that PI(3,4,5)P3 mediates a novel Ca2+ entry mechanism on plasma membranes. Given the intimate relationship between PI 3-kinase and PLC-γ in T cell activation, these data prompt a new hypothesis that PI(3,4,5)P3-sensitive Ca2+ entry plays a concerted role with Ins(1,4,5)P3-induced Ca2+release and capacitative Ca2+ entry in TCR-mediated Ca2+ signaling. d-myo-Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3), d-myo-inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5)P4), 1-O-(1,2-di-O-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-O-phosphoryl)-d-myo-inositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3), 1-O-(1,2-di-O-octanoyl-sn-glycero-3-O-phosphoryl)-d-myo-inositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (di-C8-PI(3,4,5)P3), 1-O-(1,2-di-O-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-O-phosphoryl)-d-myo-inositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2), and 1-O-(1,2-di-O-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-O-phosphoryl)-d-myo-inositol 3-monophosphate PI(3)P were synthesized as previously reported (15.Lu P.J.

The synthesis of the biotinylated PI(3,4,5)P3,(+)-1-O-(1-O-[8-(N-biotinoylamino)-octanoyl]-2-O-octanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoryl)-myo-inositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (Biotin-PIP3), is described elsewhere (17.Wang, D.-S., Ching, T.-T., St. Pyrek, J., and Chen, C.-S. (2000) Anal. Biochem., in pressGoogle Scholar). The identity and purity of all inositol phosphates and inositol lipids were examined by 1H and 31P NMR and high resolution mass spectrometry. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, wortmannin, SKF96365, indo-1 acetoxymethyl ester (AM), fura-2 AM were purchased from Calbiochem. Nifedipine was obtained from ICN. Leupeptin and 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride were products from Sigma. [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Anti-human CD3 mAb (21-L5) was obtained from Santa Cruz. Anti-Thy1.2 mAb-FITC and anti-B-220 mAb-FITC were products from Pharmingen. Mouse spleen cells (107) were treated with 5 μg of anti-Thy1.2 mAb- or anti-B-220 mAb-fluorescein (FITC) conjugates in 200 μl of culture medium consisting of a 1:1 mixture of Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium and Ham's F-12 nutrient mixtures, 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 nm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 units/ml bovine insulin, 20 nm progesterone, 5 μg/ml transferrin, and 1 μg/ml gentamicin for 30 min on ice. Anti-Thy1.2 and anti-B-220 are antibodies against the cell surface markers of T and B cells, respectively. The suspension was washed three times and resuspended in 500 μl of the same medium. For intracellular Ca2+ analysis, these cells were loaded with 1 μm indo-1 AM for 30 min at 37 °C, washed twice, and suspended in 1 ml of assay buffer consisting of 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 24.3 mmNaH2PO4, 4.3 mmK2HPO4, 113 mm NaCl, 5 mm glucose, pH 7.4. A FACStar plus cell sorter (Becton Dickinson) was used for cell sorting and to monitor indo-1 fluorescence. FITC-stained cells were analyzed by monitoring the emission at 530 nm with excitation at 488 nm. Intracellular Ca2+ was measured by comparing the ratio of indo-1 emission at 405 nm and 520 nm with excitation at 350 nm as described previously (18.Muthusamy N. Baluyut A.R. Subbarao B. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2483-2492PubMed Google Scholar). The construct expressing hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Δp85 was a kind gift from Professor Alex Toker (Harvard Medical School). Δp85 is a deletion mutant that lacks a region required for tight association with p110 but is still able to bind to appropriate phosphotyrosine targets. Thus, Δp85 can compete with native p85 for binding to essential signaling proteins and behaves as a dominant negative mutant (19.Dhand R. Hara K. Hiles I. Bax B. Gout I. Panayotou G. Fry M.J. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Jurkat T cells were grown to a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were harvested, washed with serum-free Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.), and suspended in the same medium (5 × 105 cells/ml). Transfection was carried out according to a modification of the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Aliquots containing 0.5 μg, 1.5 μg, and 3 μg of the HA·Δp85 expression vector or 3 μg of a control pCMV/blue plasmid in 500 μl of Opti-MEM were incubated with 30–60 μl of the Plus reagent from the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent kit at 25 °C for 15 min, and the mixture was added to 40 μl of the LipofectAMINE reagent in 500 μl of Opti-MEM. The mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 15 min and added to 5 ml of the cell suspension. After 5 h at 37 °C, the transfection media were replaced with 5 ml of the RPMI 1640–10% fetal bovine serum medium. The transfected cells were allowed to grow for 6 days with the medium changed every other day to express foreign DNA. The collected cells were analyzed for anti-CD3-induced Ca2+ response by fluorescence spectrometry and for HA·Δp85 expression by Western blot using anti-HA antibodies. Two different methods were employed for the plasma membrane preparations. For the Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 receptor binding assay, the membrane fraction was prepared according to a method described by Khan et al. (5.Khan A.A. Steiner J.P. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2849-2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For the Ca2+ release assay, the plasma membrane was purified by a modification of the method described by Neville (20.Neville Jr., D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 153: 540-552Crossref Scopus (630) Google Scholar). In brief, Jurkat T cells (4 × 108cells) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in 5 ml of PM buffer consisting of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 110 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 5 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin. The cell suspension was homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer using the loose pestle with 5 strokes up and down. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 10 min. The pellet was suspended in 3.125 ml of PM buffer and mixed with 5.5 ml of 69% (w/w) sucrose to make a final 44% (w/w) sucrose-membrane mixture. The mixture was overlaid with 42.3% (w/w) sucrose, and the two-phase suspension was subjected to centrifugation at 90,000 × g for 2 h in a swinging bucket rotor. The membrane material at the interface of the phases contained the greatest enrichment in plasma membranes based on the activity of (Na+-K+)-ATPase. This fraction was collected, suspended in 5 ml of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was suspended in 1 ml of the same buffer. Since PI(3,4,5)P3 contains Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 as its head group, it is plausible that this inositol phospholipid shares the binding site on the plasma membrane with Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. To assess this possibility, we examined the displacement of [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 binding by di-C8-PI(3,4,5)P3, a water-soluble derivative, Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, and Ins(1,4,5)P3. The freshly prepared membrane preparation (200 μg of protein) was incubated with 2 nm [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 (30 Ci/mmol) in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA in the presence of various concentrations of the competitive ligand, with a final volume of 0.3 ml. The mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 15 min, and the reaction was terminated by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min. The membrane-bound radioactivity was analyzed by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 30 μmIns(1,3,4,5)P4. [Ca2+]i was monitored by the change in the fluorescence intensity of fura-2-loaded cells. Jurkat T cells (1 × 107 cells/ml), suspended in the aforementioned assay buffer containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 2 mm probenacid, were incubated with 10 μmfura-2 AM in the dark for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min, washed with assay buffer twice, and resuspended at approximately 8 × 105 cells/ml in the same buffer containing 1 mm Ca2+. The effect of anti-CD3 mAb or various inositol lipids on [Ca2+]i was examined by fura-2 fluorescence in a Hitachi F-2000 spectrofluorimeter at 37 °C with excitation and emission wavelengths at 340 and 510 nm, respectively. The maximum fura-2 fluorescence intensity (F max) in Jurkat cells was determined by adding A23187 (1 μm), and the minimum fluorescence (F min) was determined following depletion of external Ca2+ by 5 mm EGTA. The [Ca2+]i was calculated according to the equation [Ca2+]i =K d (F −F min)/(F max −F), where K d denotes the apparent dissociation constant (=224 nm) of the fluorescence dye-Ca2+ complex (21.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The examination of phosphoinositol turnover was carried out according to a modification of the procedure reported by Sei et al. (9.Sei Y. Takemura M. Gusovsky F. Skolnick P. Basile A. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 216: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In brief, Jurkat T cells were incubated withmyo-[2-3H]inositol (10 μCi/106cells/ml) in inositol-free RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were then washed with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 285 mm NaCl, 11 mm KCl, 1.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mmKH2PO4, 8.3 mm NaHCO3, 1.6 mm MgSO4, 2.2 mmMgCl2, 2.2 mm CaCl2, and 5.6 mm glucose. Aliquots containing 1 × 106cells were each resuspended in 0.3 ml of the aforementioned assay buffer plus 1 mm CaCl2 and 100 μmEGTA and transferred to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. Each sample was incubated with 1.5 μg of anti-CD3 mAb or 20 μmPI(3,4,5)P3 for the indicated times and quenched by adding 0.25 ml of 6% trichloroacetic acid. The tubes were centrifuged for 2 min at 12,000 × g. The supernatant (200 μl) was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography on a 5-μm Adsorbosphere Sax column (4.6 × 200 mm) equilibrated with H2O. The [3H]inositol phosphates were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.9 mNH4H2PO4 in 60 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions were collected every 1 ml, and their radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation. Synthetic [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3, [3H]Ins(4,5)P2, Ins(4)P were used as standards. The respective retention times were 60, 48, 43, and 31 min. T cell plasma membranes were treated with 5% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid for 1 h on ice and centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant (100 μg of protein) was incubated with 100 μm Biotin-PIP3 for 1 h, and 200 μl of streptavidin beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were added. The mixture was incubated for an additional hour and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min. The beads were washed with 1 ml of each of the following solutions in tandem: 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm EDTA and 150 mm NaCl, phosphate-buffered saline, and 2 m urea. After being dialyzed against distilled water for 12 h, proteins eluted at 2m urea were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by silver staining. Previously, we reported that treatment of washed platelets with exogenous PI(3,4,5)P3 induced Ca2+ influx across plasma membranes, resulting in immediate cell aggregation (22.Lu P.J. Hsu A.L. Wang D.S. Chen C.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9776-9783Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This finding prompted us to study PI(3,4,5)P3-induced Ca2+response in other cell types. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, we examined the effect of PI(3,4,5)P3 on indo-1-loaded mouse spleen cells stained with FITC-conjugates of anti-Thy1.2 or anti-B-220 mAb. As shown, 10 μmPI(3,4,5)P3 induced a significant increase in [Ca2+]i in Thy1.2-positive mouse spleen cells as soon as 15 s after stimulation. This PI(3,4,5)P3-stimulated Ca2+ increase was also confirmed in human peripheral T cells and Jurkat T cells by fluorescence spectrophotometry. In contrast, [Ca2+]i in the B-220-positive cell population remained unaffected even in the presence of 20 μmPI(3,4,5)P3 after a prolonged exposure up to several minutes (Fig. 1). In addition, a number of cell lines, including NIH3T3 fibroblast cells, PC-12 pheochromocytoma cells, Hep G2 hepatocarcinoma cells, LNCaP prostate adenocarcinoma cells, were examined. None of these cells showed appreciable Ca2+ response following PI(3,4,5)P3 stimulation (data not shown). This cell-type specificity underscores a fundamental difference in the role of PI 3-kinase in Ca2+ regulation in different cells. The direct introduction of micellar PI(3,4,5)P3 to intact cells is also worth comment. Although how PI(3,4,5)P3permeates cell membranes remains unclear, published data from this and other laboratories show that exogenous PI(3,4,5)P3 can readily fuse with cell membranes and exert cellular and biochemical responses in different cell types including platelets, NIH3T3 cells, and adipocytes (22.Lu P.J. Hsu A.L. Wang D.S. Chen C.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9776-9783Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 23.Derman M.P. Toker A. Hartwig J.H. Spokes K. Falck J.R. Chen C.-S. Cantley L.C.

Diabetes. 1999; 48: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 A depicts that the effect of PI(3,4,5)P3 on [Ca2+]i in splenic T cells was dose-dependent, with a threshold of about 2 μm, and was saturable. As shown, treatment with the lipid messenger in excess of 10 μm did not further enhance the amplitude of Ca2+ response. In line with our previous finding in platelets (22.Lu P.J. Hsu A.L. Wang D.S. Chen C.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9776-9783Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the induction of Ca2+ response displayed stringent specificity for PI(3,4,5)P3, underlying its second messenger role. Other phosphoinositides examined, including PI(3,4)P2, PI(4,5)P2, PI(3)P, failed to exert an appreciable change in [Ca2+]i at 20 μm (Fig.2 B). Moreover, fura-2 fluorimetry showed that the effect of PI(3,4,5)P3 on [Ca2+]i was also demonstrated in different subtypes of T cells, including mouse thymocytes, Jurkat T cells, and human peripheral T cells (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that exogenous PI(3,4,5)P3 stimulated Ca2+ influx in T cells regardless the stage of cell development. Several lines of evidence suggest that the PI(3,4,5)P3-induced Ca2+ response was attributable to Ca2+ influx from the medium. First, this Ca2+ increase was completely abrogated by pretreatment with EGTA (Fig. 3 A). Second, although PI(3,4,5)P3 has been reported to activate PLC-γ via distinct mechanisms (25.Bae Y.S. Cantley L.G. Chen C.S. Kim S.-R. Kwon K.-S. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4465-4469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), the PLC inhibitor U73122 did not exhibit appreciable inhibition on PI(3,4,5)P3-elicited Ca2+ response (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, the PI(3,4,5)P3 concentration needed to elicit Ca2+response (<10 μm) was an order of magnitude lower than the threshold required for PLC-γ activation. Thus, PI(3,4,5)P3-induced Ca2+ response was independent of Ins(1,4,5)P3 formation. Third, PI(3,4,5)P3 had no effect on thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ pools (Fig. 3 B). Jurkat T cells were treated with 10 μm PI(3,4,5)P3 in a Ca2+-depleted milieu, followed by exposure to thapsigargin (1 μm). As shown, PI(3,4,5)P3 exposure did not affect the extent of thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ response as compared with that without PI(3,4,5)P3 pretreatment (Fig. 3 B, inset). These results indicate that PI(3,4,5)P3-induced Ca2+ increase was attributable to Ca2+ inflow from the medium. Due to the extremely high charge density, it has been speculated that PI(3,4,5)P3 might directly affect the properties of cellular membranes. Therefore, one might raise a concern that PI(3,4,5)P3 facilitated Ca2+ translocation across plasma membranes by acting like a detergent. To refute this possibility, we examined the effect of PI(3,4,5)P3 on the permeability of liposomal vesicles to Ca2+. Fura-2 loaded multilamellar vesicles with a lipid composition similar to that of the plasma membrane were exposed to PI(3,4,5)P3 visà vis A23187 and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, a sterol known to increase membrane permeability to Ca2+ (26.Holmes R.P. Yoss N.L. Nature. 1983; 305: 637-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, A23187 (1 μm) caused a rapid and robust increase in fura-2 fluorescence, whereas 25(OH)D3 (7 μm) induced an immediate but more modest rise. In contrast, 10 μm PI(3,4,5)P3 did not elicit any appreciable effect on fura-2 fluorescence. Taken together with the aforementioned cell-type and ligand specificity data, one could conclude that PI(3,4,5)P3 does not perturb membrane permeability to Ca2+. The activation of Ca2+ influx by PI(3,4,5)P3 suggested a potential link between PI 3-kinase and T cell Ca2+ signaling. To test this premise, a combination of pharmacological and molecular approaches was employed to characterize the role of PI 3-kinase in anti-CD3-mediated Ca2+ response. We first examined the effect of wortmannin, a potent PI 3-kinase inhibitor, on anti-CD3 mAb-induced Ca2+ response in fura-2-loaded Jurkat T cells. Fig. 5shows that ligation of the TCR-CD3 complex by anti-CD3 mAb provoked a 4-fold increase in cytosolic Ca2+ (trace a). Subsequent exposure to exogenous PI(3,4,5)P3 (10 μm) only augmented the Ca2+ response to a small extent. The anti-CD3-induced Ca2+ response largely stemmed from Ca2+ mobilization across the plasma membrane because deprivation of external Ca2+ by EGTA inhibited 70% of the Ca2+ signal (Fig. 5 A,inset). Pretreatment with wortmannin (1 μm) attenuated the amplitude of the anti-CD3-stimulated Ca2+ influx by nearly 60%, which, however, could be rescued by the subsequent exposure to 10 μm PI(3,4,5)P3 (trace b). As shown, PI(3,4,5)P3 could restore the [Ca2+]i of wortmannin-treated cells to that of the control. Moreover, the extent of Ca2+ increase greatly exceeded that elicited by PI(3,4,5)P3 in anti-CD3-stimulated cells (trace a), suggesting that the reversal of wortmannin inhibition by PI(3,4,5)P3 was not simply due to an additive effect. We hypothesized that PI 3-kinase acted in concert with PLC-γ in initiating Ca2+ signaling following TCR activation. This premise is supported by the observation that when used alone, wortmannin and the PLC inhibitor U73122 (10 μm) exerted 57% and 50% inhibition, respectively, on anti-CD3-induced Ca2+ increase, whereas a combination of these two inhibitors could virtually abolish the Ca2+ response (Fig.5 B). We also took an independent nonpharmacological approach to confirm the above results, in which Jurkat T cells were transiently transfected with a vector expressing HA epitope-tagged Δp85. It is well documented that the deletion of the binding motif for the catalytic p110 subunit in Δp85 confers PI 3-kinase dominant negative activity (19.Dhand R. Hara K. Hiles I. Bax B. Gout I. Panayotou G. Fry M.J. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Overexpression of this dominant negative inhibitor in T cells has been shown to down-regulate TCR-mediated interleukin-2 gene expression (27.Eder A.M. Dominguez L. Franke T.F. Ashwell J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28025-28031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), Erk2 (extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase) activation (28.Von Willebrand M. Jascur T. Bonnefoy-Berard N. Yano H. Altman A. Matsuda Y. Mustelin T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 828-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) activation (29.Jascur T. Gilman J. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14483-14488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Western analysis using anti-HA antibodies verified the expression of HA·Δp85 in transfected Jurkat T cells (Fig.6 A). It is noteworthy that the level of Δp85 expression displayed a direct correlation with the amount of cDNA used in transfection. Accordingly, transfected Jurkat T cells expressing varying levels of Δp85 were tested for Ca2+ entry in response to anti-CD3 stimulation. In line with the wortmannin data, Δp85 suppressed anti-CD3-induced Ca2+ response in a dose-dependent manner, ranging from 5% to 40% in accordance with the level of Δp85 expression (Fig. 6 B, traces a–d). Since both wortmannin and Δp85 gave consistent results in inhibiting anti-CD3-stimulated Ca2+ response, these data strongly support the involvement of PI 3-kinase in TCR-mediated Ca2+signaling. To characterize the underlying mechanism, we examined the effect of various pharmacological inhibitors on PI(3,4,5)P3-induced Ca2+ entry. These included nifedipine (a voltage-gated Ca2+ channel blocker; 20 μm), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (an inhibitor of TCR-mediated Ca2+ entry (9.Sei Y. Takemura M. Gusovsky F. Skolnick P.

https://openalex.org/W2050578546,"The maize β-glucosidase isozyme Glu1 hydrolyzes a broad spectrum of substrates in addition to its natural substrate DIMBOAGlc (2-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-4-hydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one), whereas the sorghum β-glucosidase isozyme Dhr1 hydrolyzes exclusively its natural substrate dhurrin (p-hydroxy-(S)-mandelonitrile-β-d-glucose). To study the mechanism of substrate specificity further, eight chimeric β-glucosidases were constructed by replacing peptide sequences within the C-terminal region of Glu1 with the homologous peptide sequences of Dhr1 or vice versa, where the two enzymes differ by 4 to 22 amino acid substitutions, depending on the length of the swapped regions. Five Glu1/Dhr1 chimeras hydrolyzed substrates that are hydrolyzed by both parental enzymes, including dhurrin, which is not hydrolyzed by Glu1. In contrast, three Dhr1/Glu1 chimeras hydrolyzed only dhurrin but with lower catalytic efficiency than Dhr1. Additional domain-swapping within the C-terminal domain of Glu1 showed that replacing the peptide466FAGFTERY473 of Glu1 with the homologous peptide 462SSGYTERF469 of Dhr1 or replacing the peptide 481NNNCTRYMKE490 in Glu1 with the homologous peptide 477ENGCERTMKR486 of Dhr1 was sufficient to confer to Glu1 the ability to hydrolyze dhurrin. Data from various reciprocal chimeras, sequence comparisons, and homology modeling suggest that the Dhr1-specific Ser-462–Ser-463 and Phe-469 play a key role in dhurrin hydrolysis. Similar data suggest that DIMBOAGlc hydrolysis determinants are not located within the extreme 47-amino acid-long C-terminal domain of Glu1. The maize β-glucosidase isozyme Glu1 hydrolyzes a broad spectrum of substrates in addition to its natural substrate DIMBOAGlc (2-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-4-hydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one), whereas the sorghum β-glucosidase isozyme Dhr1 hydrolyzes exclusively its natural substrate dhurrin (p-hydroxy-(S)-mandelonitrile-β-d-glucose).

In contrast, three Dhr1/Glu1 chimeras hydrolyzed only dhurrin but with lower catalytic efficiency than Dhr1. Additional domain-swapping within the C-terminal domain of Glu1 showed that replacing the peptide466FAGFTERY473 of Glu1 with the homologous peptide 462SSGYTERF469 of Dhr1 or replacing the peptide 481NNNCTRYMKE490 in Glu1 with the homologous peptide 477ENGCERTMKR486 of Dhr1 was sufficient to confer to Glu1 the ability to hydrolyze dhurrin. Data from various reciprocal chimeras, sequence comparisons, and homology modeling suggest that the Dhr1-specific Ser-462–Ser-463 and Phe-469 play a key role in dhurrin hydrolysis. Similar data suggest that DIMBOAGlc hydrolysis determinants are not located within the extreme 47-amino acid-long C-terminal domain of Glu1. 2-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-4-hydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one glucohydrolase 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one polymerase chain reaction chimera polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-glucoside 6-bromo-2-naphthyl-β-d-glucoside nitrophenyl-β-d-glucoside β-Glucosidases (β-d-glucoside glucohydrolase, EC3.2.1.21) have been the focus of much research recently because of the key roles they play in a number of biological processes and potential biotechnological applications.

Phytochemistry. 1988; 27: 3349-3358Crossref Scopus (572) Google Scholar). There are two known isozymes of the enzyme, Glu1 and Glu2. The cDNAs corresponding to both isozymes were cloned and sequenced, and the deduced protein products were found to share 90% sequence identity (13.Bandaranayake H. Esen A. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 1048Google Scholar). The cDNA corresponding to the sorghum β-glucosidase isozyme Dhr1 was also cloned and sequenced in our laboratory (14.Cicek M. Esen A. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 1469-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); it shares ∼70% sequence identity with each of the two maize isozymes. The catalytically active form of both maize and sorghum β-glucosidases is a 120-kDa homodimer or its multimers. The primary structures of both enzymes contain the peptide motifs TFNEP and ITENG, which are shown to be highly conserved and make up the catalytic site in all family 1 β-glycosidases (15.Henrissat B.

Furthermore, the three-dimensional structures of six family 1 β-glucosidases (white clover linamarase, white mustard myrosinase, Lactococcus lactis6-phospho-β-galactosidase, Bacillus polymyxaβ-glucosidase, Sulfolobus sulfataricus β-glucosidase, and Thermosphaera aggregans β-glucosidase) have recently been solved using crystals of the enzyme-glycosyl complexes (18.Barrett T.

In these four cases, the residues of the TFNEP and (I/V)TENG motifs or their equivalents were found to form part of a pocket or crater-shaped active site (24.Davies G. Henrissat B. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 853-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar). The two catalytic glutamic acids in β-O-glucosidases (i.e. the nucleophile and the acid-base catalyst) and one glutamic acid (i.e. the nucleophile) and a glutamine (the water activator) in myrosinases were positioned within the active site at appropriate distances (2.5–3Å) on opposite sides of the glycosidic bond.There are two fundamental questions about β-glucosidase-catalyzed reactions. 1) How do β-glucosidases catalyze the hydrolysis of the β-glycosidic bond between two glycone residues (e.g.cellobiose and other β-linked oligosaccharides) or that between glucose and an aryl or alkyl aglycone (e.g. many naturally occurring substrates in plants)? 2) What determines substrate specificity, including the site and mechanism of aglycone binding? Much progress has been made in understanding the mechanism of catalysis and defining the roles of specific amino acids involved in catalysis within the active site. However, there is virtually no information as to how β-glucosidases recognize their substrates and interact with them, specifically the aglycone moiety, which is the basis of tremendous diversity in natural substrates and is responsible for subtle substrate specificity differences among β-glucosidases. The maize β-glucosidase isozyme Glu1 and its sorghum homologue Dhr1 provide an ideal model system to address questions related to substrate specificity, because these enzymes represent extremes in substrate specificity. Although Dhr1 hydrolyzes only its natural substrate dhurrin, Glu1 hydrolyzes a broad spectrum of artificial and natural substrates in addition to its natural substrate DIMBOAGlc, but it does not hydrolyze dhurrin (Fig. 1).The first attempt to investigate substrate specificity using chimeric β-glucosidases was made by Singh and Hayashi (25.Singh A. Hayashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21928-21933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), who exchanged the C-terminal 58-amino acid-long domain of a prokaryotic β-glucosidase from Celvibrio gilvus with the C-terminal 60-amino acid-long domain of Agrobacterium tumefaciens β-glucosidase. They showed that the resulting chimeric enzyme exhibited the substrate specificity of A. tumefaciens β-glucosidase. Hoa and Hayashi 2T. T. Hoa and K. Hayashi, unpublished results. 2T. T. Hoa and K. Hayashi, unpublished results. also show that the deletion of 70 amino acids from the C-terminal region of C. gilvus β-glucosidase leads to complete loss of activity. These investigators concluded that the C-terminal region of the enzyme played a major role in determining substrate specificity and catalytic activity.The importance of specific enzyme domains in substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency was also shown in a number of other enzyme chimeras produced from two enzymes that differ with respect to substrate specificity. For example, it was shown that exchanging a small N-terminal portion between two rice α-amylase isozymes (Amy A and Amy 3D) resulted in a chimeric enzyme (Amy A/3D) that shows high activity on both soluble starch and oligosaccharides, whereas parental enzymes have high activity only on either soluble starch (Amy A) or oligosaccharides (Amy 3D) (26.Terashima M. Hosono M. Katoh S. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1997; 47: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).The purpose of the studies described in this paper was to gain insight into the mechanism of substrate (aglycone) recognition and binding in β-glucosidases using two plant enzymes, the maize isozyme Glu1 and sorghum isozyme Dhr1, as model systems. To this end, we have constructed eight chimeric enzymes by reciprocal domain-swapping. Target domains were selected based on amino acid sequence comparisons and analysis of modeled three-dimensional structures. We demonstrate that the maize Glu1 isozyme gains the ability to hydrolyze dhurrin when the C-terminal 47-amino acid-long region or specific subdomains within this region are replaced by corresponding Dhr1 region, whereas the reciprocal replacement has no effect on the substrate specificity of the sorghum Dhr1 isozyme, except a12-fold reduction in activity.DISCUSSIONIn this study we have designed and produced chimeric enzymes from two naturally occurring enzymes, creating a novel enzymatic function as well as improved catalytic efficiency on certain substrates. Our model system was comprised of two β-glucosidases, Glu1 and Dhr1, each with a strict specificity for its own physiological substrate, although they share 70% sequence identity and contain identical catalytic amino acids and glycone recognition and binding motifs (TFNEP and ITENG). Based on the modeled three-dimensional structures of Glu1 and Dhr1, we have successfully combined two different substrate specificities in a single chimeric enzyme by replacing the C-terminal domain of Glu1 with the homologous domain from Dhr1. This strategy added novel substrate specificity (e.g. dhurrin hydrolysis) to the maize Glu1 isozyme and a 2–4-fold improvement in its catalytic efficiency on other substrates (e.g. nitrophenyl β-glucosides, TableII).The purpose of producing five Glu1/Dhr1 and three Dhr/Glu1 chimeric β-glucosidases was to delineate the regions of primary structure that contain key amino acids and sequence motifs determining substrate (or aglycone) specificity. Each of the five Glu1/Dhr1 chimeric enzymes (chim 2, 15, 16, 21, and 22) exhibited the combined substrate specificities of the parental enzymes and, on average, 2–4-fold higher catalytic efficiency on certain substrates than the parental enzyme Glu1. The basis of the broadened substrate specificity and improved catalytic efficiency is thought to reside in amino acid substitutions that occur in the 53-amino acid-long C-terminal domain of Dhr1 or its shorter fragments that were swapped with the homologous regions of Glu1. However, three Dhr1/Glu1 chimeras (chim 17, chim 23, and chim 39) hydrolyzed only dhurrin, but catalytic efficiency was drastically reduced in the case of chim 17 and 39 because the length of the exchanged Glu1 domain increased. Thus, Dhr1/Glu1 chimeras exhibited neither widened substrate specificity nor improved catalytic efficiency (Tables II and III). These results allow us to draw three conclusions. 1) The C-terminal domain of β-glucosidases includes residues that are necessary, but not sufficient, for aglycone recognition and binding. This is in agreement with the results of Singh and Hayashi (25.Singh A. Hayashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21928-21933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar); they showed a chimeric enzyme obtained by replacing the C-terminal domain of a C. gulvis β-glucosidase with the homologous C-terminal domain of an A. tumefaciens β-glucosidase had the substrate specificity of the C-terminal region donor. The N-terminal region, at least the first 41 amino acids of Glu1, does not appear to have a discernable role in substrate specificity. We replaced amino acids 1–41 of Dhr1 with the corresponding N-terminal region of Glu1. The resulting Dhr1/Glu1 chimeric enzyme hydrolyzed only dhurrin as does Dhr1 (data not shown) and exhibited kinetic properties of Dhr1, suggesting that the N terminus of Glu1 and possibly of other β-glucosidases is not involved in substrate (i.e.aglycone) specificity. However, the N-terminal region is required for catalysis because it contains a universally conserved amino acid (Gln-38 in Glu1 and Gln-39 in Dhr1, Fig. 2), which is in the glycone binding pocket of the active site (18.Barrett T. Suresh C.G. Tolley S.P. Dodson E.J. Hughes M.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 951-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 19.Burmeister W.P. Cottaz S. Driquez H. Iori R.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). 2) The dhurrin hydrolysis determinants in sorghum β-glucosidase (Dhr1) are among 22 amino acid substitutions in the extreme 53-amino acid-long C-terminal domain of this enzyme that distinguish it from the homologous 47-amino acid-long C-terminal domain of Glu1. More specifically, one or a combination of the amino acids Ser-462–Ser-463, Tyr-465, and Phe-469 that reside in the peptide 462SSGYTERF469 are essential for dhurrin hydrolysis because this peptide alone confers the capability to hydrolyze dhurrin to Glu1, as is the case in chim 21 (Table III and Fig. 4 B, lane 7). 3) In contrast, the DIMBOAGlc hydrolysis determinants are not in the 47-amino acid-long C-terminal domain of Glu1, although this domain may contain residues that are involved in DIMBOAGlc or DIMBOA binding.We postulate that although Glu1 and Dhr1 differ by 151 amino acid substitutions, 5 deletions, and 7 additions at 514 positions (∼30% sequence divergence), only a small number of these changes are relevant to the substrate specificity differences between them. Indeed only 4 (Ser-462–Ser-463, Tyr-465, and Phe-469) of the 22 variant amino acid sites in the extreme 47- to 53-amino acid-long C terminus map to or around the active site of the modeled enzymes (Fig. 5). Therefore, it is conceivable that more than 90% of the amino acid substitutions separating Glu1 and Dhr1 are adaptively and functionally neutral, which would be consistent with Kimura's theory of neutral evolution (37.Kimura M. The Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1983Crossref Google Scholar). There are well documented examples in the literature supporting this postulate. For example, eubacterial and mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenases differ with respect to coenzyme specificity; the former is NADP-dependent, whereas the latter is NAD-dependent. Moreover, both enzymes have essentially the same tertiary structure, although they differ by 250 amino acid substitutions at 320 positions. Only 6 of these 250 amino acid substitutions determine coenzyme specificity, as shown elegantly by shifting NADP specificity to NAD specificity or vice versaby replacing these amino acids in the coenzyme binding pocket (38.Dean A.M. Am. Sci. 1998; 86: 26-37Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Wilks et al. (39.Wilks H.M. Hart K.W. Feeney R. Dunn C.R. Muirhead H. Chia W.N. Barstow D.A. Atkinson T. Clarke A.R. Holbrook J.J. Science. 1988; 242: 1541-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) provide even a more dramatic example in that they changed a lactate dehydrogenase to a malate dehydrogenase by replacing a single key amino acid although the two enzymes differed by 230 amino acid substitutions. Other examples of bringing about dramatic changes in substrate specificity and catalytic properties include changing the substrate specificity and double-bond positional specificity of an acyl-carrier protein desaturase by five amino acid replacements (40.Cahoon B.E. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Shanklin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4872-4877Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), increasing catalytic efficiency and broadening substrate specificity in a chimeric protease constructed by recombining the N-terminal domain of coagulation factor X with the C-terminal domain of trypsin (41.Hopfner K.P. Kopetzki E. Kresse G.B. Bode W. Huber R. Engh R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9813-9818Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and introducing the active site of nonheme iron superoxide dismutase into E. coli thioredoxin and changing it to a superoxide dismutase (42.Pinto A.L. Hellinga H.W. Caradonna J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5562-5567Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).The substrate specificity data from chim 2 provided the first clue to the fact that the C-terminal 53-amino acid-long domain of Dhr1 contains key determinants for dhurrin hydrolysis. However, these determinants alone did not change the specificity of a Glu1/Dhr1 chimera entirely to that of the C-terminal region donor Dhr-1. Since there were 22 amino acid substitutions and two additions (a dipeptide and a tetrapeptide) in the 53-amino acid-long Dhr1 C-terminal domain that differentiate it from the homologous Glu1 domain (Fig. 2), it was not possible to identify specific amino acids or sequence motifs that are important for dhurrin hydrolysis. Consequently, this Dhr1 domain was split into two subdomains, which are represented in chim 15 (23-amino acid-long C-terminal subdomain) and chim 16 (30-amino acid-long N-terminal subdomain), to determine which subdomain was important for dhurrin hydrolysis. The substrate specificity and kinetic data from these two chimeras unequivocally showed that the 30-amino acid-long subdomain, which contains 10 amino acid substitutions, played a far greater role in dhurrin hydrolysis than the 23-amino acid-long subdomain. This is clearly evident in the fact that chim 16 hydrolyzes dhurrin 12 times better than chim 15 (Table III). These data are also consistent with the modeling data in that none of the 23 amino acids from the extreme C terminus of Dhr1 or Glu1 maps to and around the active site of the modeled three-dimensional structures of these enzymes. Therefore, the 8 substitutions and 4-amino acid-long addition that separate Glu1 from Dhr1 at the extreme C terminus has a rather small and probably indirect effect on substrate specificity.The substrate specificity and kinetic data clearly suggested that one or more of the 10 amino acid substitutions in the 30-amino acid-long Dhr1 subdomain in chim 16 plays a key role in dhurrin hydrolysis. Again, to bring further clarity to the specific site(s) responsible for dhurrin hydrolysis, the 30-amino acid-long subdomain was divided into two segments after leaving out the invariant region GIVYVDR separating them. The resulting two Dhr1 peptides462SSGYTERF469 and477ENGCERTMKR486 were used to replace their homologues in Glu1 by domain swapping, which yielded chim 21 and 22, respectively (Table I and Fig. 2). The substrate specificity and kinetic data obtained with these two chimeras indicated that chim 21 hydrolyzed dhurrin and had the best kinetic properties, having the lowest K m and highest k catand efficiency coefficient among five Glu1/Dhr1 chimeras (Table III). Thus, the Dhr1 peptide 462SSGYTERF469 alone is sufficient to enable Glu1 to hydrolyze dhurrin when it replaces the homologous peptide 466FAGFTERY473 of Glu1. Further support for the importance of peptide462SSGYTERF469 in dhurrin hydrolysis came from three Dhr1/Glu1 chimeras. Of these, only chim 23 hydrolyzed dhurrin with kinetic constants and catalytic efficiency close to those of wild type Dhr1 (Table III; Fig. 4 B, lane 11), and it was the only chimera in which the peptide462SSGYTERF469 was not replaced by its Glu1 homologue. Indeed, when this peptide was replaced with its Glu1 homolog in Dhr1/Glu1 chimeras 17 and 39, their relative efficiency in dhurrin hydrolysis was 7.6- to 12-fold lower than that of wild type Dhr1 (TableIII). It is clear from these data that one or more of the 4-amino acid substitutions in peptide 462SSGYTERF469 are in the aglycone binding pocket of the active site, and they are necessary for the binding of dhurrin in correct angle and steric complementarity for hydrolysis. We postulate that Ser-462–Ser-463 and Phe-469 are the key residues because they are unique to Dhr1, and they and their homologues map to the active site in the modeled β-glucosidases (Fig.5). Moreover, Ser-462–Ser-63 are ideal candidates to form hydrogen-bonding interactions through their side chain -OH group with the -OH group in the aglycone(p-hydroxy-(S)-mandelonitrile) moiety of dhurrin. Such interactions may be important in the attainment and stabilization of the transition state by the enzyme-dhurrin complex during the glycosylation step of hydrolysis. These same interactions, when coupled with those involving certain Glu1-specific residues on the Glu1 side of the primary structure, may explain the improved catalytic efficiency of the Glu1/Dhr1 chimeric enzymes toward pNPGlc andoNPGlc, since the aglycones of these artificial substrates are similar in size and shape to that of dhurrin. The role of the fourth amino acid substitution, Tyr-465 in Dhr1 and Phe-469 in Glu1, in dhurrin hydrolysis is probably indirect, if any, because this site is near but does not map to the presumptive aglycone binding pocket of the modeled enzymes. Interestingly, two of the four sites in the Glu1 and Glu2 homologs of the Dhr1 peptide462SSGYTERF469 are also different, Phe-466 and Phe-469 in Glu1 and Tyr-466 and Tyr-469 in Glu2, and Glu1 and Glu2 differ in substrate specificity. The former hydrolyzes 6BNGlc and a variety of nitrophenyl β-glycosides, whereas the latter does not hydrolyze 6BNGlc at all and hydrolyzes nitrophenyl β-glycosides 5–6 times less efficiently than Glu1 (27.Cicek M. Esen A. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1999; 63: 392-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Moreover, the three-dimensional structure of white mustard myrosinase provided information about key residues involved in substrate binding, although the aglycone-binding site could not be directly identified. However, the docking of sinigrin into the active site suggested that the aglycone moiety is located in a hydrophobic pocket that is formed by residues Phe-331, Phe-371, Phe-473, Ile-257, and Tyr-330 (19.Burmeister W.P. Cottaz S. Driquez H. Iori R. Palmieri S. Henrissat B. Structure. 1997; 5: 663-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Phe-473 of myrosinase is homologous with Tyr-473 of Glu1 and Phe-469 of Dhr1, which are bold-faced in peptides466FAGFTERY 473 and462SSGYTERF 469, respectively, supporting our hypothesis that these are one of the key residues determining aglycone recognition and, thus, substrate specificity.The mechanism by which the Dhr1 peptide477ENGCERTMKR486 in chim 22 contributes to dhurrin hydrolysis is not apparent, although in this case the catalytic efficiency coefficient (k cat/K m) is less than one-third that of chim 21 (Table III), which is still substantial. In other words, it is not possible to predict which of the five amino acid substitutions that are in this peptide imparts dhurrin hydrolysis capability to chim 22 because none of these five sites map to the active site of the modeled enzymes nor have their homologues been directly implicated in substrate binding and catalysis in the literature. Thus, it is conceivable that one or more of these sites have indirect global effects on the structure of the active site for the binding of dhurrin in a partially correct angle and steric complementarity for hydrolysis.Our data from three Dhr/Glu1 chimeras (chim 17, 39, and 23) unequivocally showed that none of these three chimeras hydrolyzed DIMBOAGlc or any of the artificial substrates tested (Table II and Table III ; Figs. 3, B–C, lanes 8–10, and4 A, lanes 10–12), whereas their Glu1/Dhr1 reciprocals (chim 2, 16, and 15) hydrolyzed these very same substrates (Table III; Fig. 4, A–B, lanes 4–6). Taken together, these data suggest that there are no residues in the extreme 47-amino acid-long C-terminal region of Glu1 that affect substrate hydrolysis qualitatively. However, this does not rule out the contribution of certain sites in the Glu1 C-terminal region to substrate binding and the rate of hydrolysis in combination with residues that reside elsewhere in the primary structure. The fact that the catalytic efficiency of all five Glu1/Dhr1 chimeras decreased in DIMBOAGlc hydrolysis but increased in pNPGlc andoNPGlc hydrolysis suggests that one or more amino acid substitutions at the Dhr1 C-terminal region produce interactions favoring quantitatively nitrophenyl glucoside hydrolysis but not DIMBOAGlc. This is not surprising because the shape and size of the nitrophenyl moiety has greater similarity to the aglycone of dhurrin than to the much bulkier DIMBOA (Fig. 1). The question of what site and in which domain in Glu1 and Glu1/Dhr1 chimeras is (or are) the residue(s) that determine the hydrolysis of DIMBOAGlc and artificial substrates (e.g. oNPGlc, pNPGlc, MUGlc, etc) cannot be answered from the available data. However, we postulate that such residues are among the Glu1-specific amino acid substitutions in the region spanning amino acids Leu-330–Asn-450 based on preliminary data from a Dhr1/Glu1 chimera and modeling studies. In the aforementioned Dhr1/Glu1 chimera, the C-terminal half of Dhr1 (Ile-328–Asn-514) was replaced with the homologous Glu1 C-terminal half (Leu-330–Pro-512), and this chimera exhibited qualitatively the substrate specificity of Glu1. Our homology modeling data indicate that 12 of the 51 amino acid substitutions that are separating Glu1 from Dhr1 in this swapped C-terminal half map to the presumptive aglycone binding pocket of the active site. These substitutions are (numbering by the Dhr1 sequence position where the residue on the left occurs in Dhr1, and the one on the right in Glu1) N366K, A367P, T372M, A375P, N378Y, M407I, I410V, G413K,"

Grb2 binding to TrkA is mediated by the central SH2 domain, requires a kinase-active TrkA, and is phosphotyrosine-dependent. By analyzing a series of rat TrkA mutants, we demonstrate that Grb2 binds to the carboxyl-terminal residue, Tyr794, as well as to the activation loop tyrosines, Tyr683 and Tyr684. By using acidic amino acid substitutions of the activation loop tyrosines on TrkA, we can stimulate constitutive kinase activity and TrkA-Shc interactions but, importantly, abolish TrkA/Grb2 binding. Thus, in addition to providing the first evidence of direct Grb2 binding to the neurotrophin receptor, TrkA, these data provide the first direct evidence that the activation loop tyrosines of a receptor tyrosine kinase, in addition to their essential role in kinase activation, also serve a direct role in the recruitment of intracellular signaling molecules.

Although a number of signaling proteins (Shc, phospholipase Cγ-1 (PLCγ-1), FRS-2/SNT, rAPS, SH2-B, Ras-GRF1, and the Csk homologous kinase) directly bind to TrkA (1.Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr.

Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), many questions still remain with respect to how the pathways are integrated and what factors influence NGF-stimulated differentiation in neuronal cells versusNGF-stimulated mitogenesis in non-neuronal cells. In this respect, Rap-1 stimulates a long term activation of MAP kinase (MAPK; Ref. 6.York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McClecksy E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) that is thought to be a deterministic event in regulating differentiation versus proliferation (7.Cowley S.J. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar, 8.Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4234) Google Scholar). Ligand activation results in the phosphorylation of five tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain of rat TrkA (Tyr499, Tyr679, Tyr683, Tyr684, and Tyr794). Tyr499 and Tyr794 mediate the phosphorylation and activation of Shc, FRS-2, and PLCγ-1, whereas the phosphorylation of Tyr679, Tyr683, and Tyr684 are essential to kinase activity. In NGF-dependent signaling, the tyrosine phosphorylation and receptor binding of Shc and FRS-2, and their subsequent binding to Grb2, result in the activation of Ras and MAPK (9.Egan S.E. Giddings B.W. Brooks M.W. Buday L. Sizeland A.M. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar, 10.Li N. Batzer A. Daly R. Yajnik V. Skolnik E. Chardin P. Bar-Sagi D. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1993; 363: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). We have also recently shown that FRS-2 binds the adapter protein Crk in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner (2.Meakin S.O. MacDonald J.I.S. Gryz E.A. Kubu C.J. Verdi J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9861-9870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Since Crk also activates MAPK, via Rap1 (6.York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McClecksy E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), it is clear that there are multiple pathways to activate MAPK in response to NGF stimulation. Moreover, TrkA receptors mutated at Tyr499, in which Shc and FRS-2-dependent pathways are lost, retain NGF-dependent activation of MAP kinase (11.Stephens R.M. Loeb D.M. Copeland T.D. Pawson T. Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1994; 12: 691-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) suggesting that there are additional receptor-dependent mechanisms activating MAP kinase other than through the Shc and FRS-2 adapters. In this respect, PLCγ-1, which binds TrkA at Tyr794, also contains a Grb2-binding site and thus could also contribute to the activation of MAP kinase in response to NGF stimulation. Interestingly, receptors in which both Tyr499 and Tyr794 are mutated show a dramatic reduction, but not a complete loss, of MAP kinase activity (11.Stephens R.M. Loeb D.M. Copeland T.D. Pawson T. Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1994; 12: 691-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) suggesting a possible role of other Tyr(P) sites on TrkA in independent routes to MAP kinase activation. As mentioned above, Grb2 is recruited both directly and indirectly into the signaling cascades of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). For example, in addition to binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated signaling molecules such as Shc, Gab-1, Shp2, rAPS, SH2B, PLCγ-1, and FRS-2, Grb2 can also bind directly to the activated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (12.Okutani T.

Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5192-5201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the Ret receptor (14.Alberti L. Borrello M.G. Ghizzoni S. Torriti F. Rizzetti M.G. Pierotti M.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1079-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the Tpr-Met oncoprotein (15.Jeffers M. Koochekpour S. Fiscella M. Sathyanarayana B.K. Woude G.F.V. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2691-2700Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and the ErbB2 receptor (16.Ricci A. Lanfrancone L. Chiari R. Belardo G. Pertica C. Natali P.G. Pelicci P.G. Segatto O. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1519-1529PubMed Google Scholar). This redundancy in Grb2 recruitment provides alternate routes to the activation of Ras-dependent MAPK. Moreover, since the SH3 domain of Grb2 has a variety of binding partners, other than nucleotide exchange factors for Ras, it is likely that the direct recruitment of Grb2 can couple receptors to a variety of alternative signaling cascades and cellular functions. To understand better Trk receptor signaling, we have utilized the yeast two-hybrid system to identify and analyze proteins that interact with the intracellular domain (ICD) of TrkA (3.MacDonald J.I.S. Verdi J.M. Meakin S.O. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 141-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that Grb2 binds directly to the ICD of TrkA in both yeast two-hybrid assays as well as in in vitro binding assays. Moreover, we demonstrate that Grb2 co-immunoprecipitates with TrkA in NGF-stimulated cell lysates containing wild type TrkA as well as the Y499F and the Y499F/Y794F TrkA receptor mutants. Even in lysates pre-cleared of known NGF-induced Grb2-binding proteins (Shc, PLCγ-1, rAPS, and SH2B), co-immunoprecipitation of TrkA and Grb2 is still observed with wild type TrkA and the Y499F/Y794F mutant. This interaction is mediated through the SH2 domain of Grb2 and is dependent upon a kinase-active TrkA. By analyzing a series of single, double, triple, and quadruple site-directed TrkA mutants and a combination of in vitrobinding assays, co-immunoprecipitation assays, and yeast two-hybrid assays, we demonstrate that Grb2 binds TrkA at two independent sites, namely the carboxyl-terminal tyrosine, Tyr794, as well as the activation loop tyrosines, Tyr683 and Tyr684. Collectively, these data are the first evidence of direct Grb2 binding to a neurotrophin Trk receptor. Moreover, these data provide the first direct evidence that the activation loop tyrosines, in addition to their essential role in kinase activation, also serve a direct role in the recruitment of intracellular signaling molecules.

All yeast media were from CLONTECH. 3-Aminotriazole (3-AT) was from ICN. β-NGF was from Harlan Products for Bioscience. Recombinant baculoviruses expressing wild type rat TrkA have previously been described (3.MacDonald J.I.S. Verdi J.M. Meakin S.O. J. Mol.

Construction of the mutant receptors, Y499F (S8), Y794F (S9), Δ450KFG452 (S17), Δ493IMENP497 (S3), and generation of the recombinant baculoviruses have also been described (19.Meakin S.O. MacDonald J.I.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1875-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The Y679A (S26) mutant was generated by PCR using the oligonucleotide 5′-ATCGCCAGCACAGACTACTACCGTG-3′. The S13a double substitution mutant Y683D/Y684E was generated by PCR as described previously (20.Gryz E.A. Meakin S.O. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 417-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). All receptors contain the amino-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (19.Meakin S.O. MacDonald J.I.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1875-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The triple substitution mutant Y679A/Y683D/Y684E (S28) was generated by PCR using the oligonucleotide 5′-ATC GCC AGC ACA GAC GAC GAG CGT G-3′ and TrkAS13a as a template. The S27 mutant was generated by substituting the 400-base pair NcoI-KpnI fragment, containing Y679A, from S26 into the S8S9 mutant (Y499F/Y794F). The S29 mutant was generated by substituting the 400-base pair NcoI-KpnI fragment, containing Y679A/Y683D/Y684E from S28, into the S9 mutant (Y794F). Finally, the S30 mutant was generated by substituting the 400-base pairNcoI-KpnI fragment, containing Y679A/Y683D/Y684E from S28, into the S8S9 mutant (Y499F/Y794F). All PCR products and mutants were sequenced (Robarts Research Institute). TrkA mutants were expressed in either baculovirus or in the pCMX vector as described (19.Meakin S.O. MacDonald J.I.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1875-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Constructs containing the intracellular domain (ICD) of wild type TrkA and kinase inactive TrkA (K547A; S11), fused to the yeast Gal-4 activation domain vector, pAS-1, have been described (3.MacDonald J.I.S. Verdi J.M. Meakin S.O. J. Mol.

Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1875-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). nnr5 cells expressing the TrkA-S8S9 mutant (Y499F/Y794F) were generated as described previously (19.Meakin S.O. MacDonald J.I.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1875-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The TrkA-S8S9 clone used in these studies expresses levels of mutant TrkA comparable to those of wild type TrkA expressed in B5 cells. Yeast strain PJ69-4A was grown and transformed as described (3.MacDonald J.I.S. Verdi J.M. Meakin S.O. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 141-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Yeast expressing the pAS constructs were maintained in SC (Synthetic Complete)/trp media. Strains co-expressing the pAS-1 constructs and pGAD-Grb2 were grown in SC media minus Trp and Leu. To assess two-hybrid interactions, yeast cells were plated on SC minus His, Ade, Leu, and Trp (HALT) containing 10–20 mm 3-AT. For transient transfection assays, nnr5 cells (4 × 106) were electroporated with 1 μg of pEGFP (CLONTECH) and 10 μg of the pCMX vector expressing TrkA, and the TrkA mutant, S8S9 (Y499F/Y794F), as described previously (19.Meakin S.O. MacDonald J.I.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1875-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cells were split into two plates and assayed for neurite outgrowth in the absence and presence of 100 ng/ml NGF. Fresh NGF was added daily. After 5 days, the cells were scored for EGFP expression, and the number of EGFP-positive cells containing neurites greater than two cell body lengths was determined. The Shc PTB domain, the PLCγ-1 SH2 domain, and full-length Grb2 were expressed as fusion proteins with glutathioneS-transferase (GST) in Escherichia coli strain BL21. GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (3.MacDonald J.I.S. Verdi J.M. Meakin S.O. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 141-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In general, fusion proteins were stored bound to glutathione-Sepharose; however, in some instances the proteins were eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% (v/v) glycerol. Protein concentrations were estimated by comparison with known amounts of purified GST following SDS-PAGE or by A 280readings of purified material (A 280 reading of 1.4 = 1 mg/ml). High-Five insect cells were infected with recombinant baculoviruses expressing the various receptors, stimulated with 100 ng/ml of NGF (10 min), and lysates prepared as described (18.MacDonald J.I.S. Meakin S.O. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 7: 371-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Clarified lysates were assayed for total protein (Bio-Rad Dc Protein Assay Kit), and the level of Trk expression was determined by titration and Western blotting with anti-HA antibodies as described previously (3.MacDonald J.I.S. Verdi J.M. Meakin S.O. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 141-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Receptors were precipitated by mixing GST fusion proteins (1–2 μg) with baculovirus-infected insect cell lysates containing equal amounts of expressed TrkA receptors as described (3.MacDonald J.I.S. Verdi J.M. Meakin S.O. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 141-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved on a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to Immobilon-P, and blotted as described above. Purified GST served as the negative control. For immunoprecipitation experiments, nnr5, B5, and nnr5 cells expressing the Y499F/Y794F mutant TrkA (S8S9) were stimulated with NGF (100 ng/ml) for 10 min and lysed as described (2.Meakin S.O.

Equal amounts of protein (2 mg) were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-Shc (5 μg) or anti-HA (12CA5; 2 μg), with either 10 μl of Pansorbin (Calbiochem) or 50 μl of Tachisorb (Calbiochem). Where indicated, lysates were pre-cleared with either anti-Shc antibodies or a mixture of four different antibodies (anti-Shc (5 μg), anti-PLCγ-1 (1 μg), anti-SH2B (1:300), and anti-rAPS (1:300)) for 1.5 h at 4 °C, and the immune complexes were collected by centrifugation at 4 °C. The pre-cleared lysates were then re-precipitated with either anti-Shc, the antibody mixture, or 12CA5 (5 μg) overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (2.Meakin S.O. MacDonald J.I.S. Gryz E.A. Kubu C.J. Verdi J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9861-9870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated in blotto for 2 h at room temperature and then probed with rabbit anti-Grb2 (1:3000) and horseradish peroxidase goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:20,000) and visualized by chemiluminescence. When indicated, membranes were stripped at 50 °C for 15 min (62.5 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 1% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and reprobed with anti-Shc (1 μg/ml) or the anti-HA monoclonal, 3F10 (1:4000). To determine the level of MAPK activation, cells were stimulated for 10 min with 100 ng/ml NGF, lyse, and assayed for protein content as described above. Ten micrograms of total protein from each line was analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with an anti-phospho-specific MAPK antibody (1:10,000). Blots were stripped and reprobed with a polyclonal rabbit anti-MAPK antibody (1:10,000) to determine absolute levels of MAPK per lane. The recruitment of the signaling adapter, Grb2, into Trk receptor signaling has been primarily described through interactions with Shc, FRS-2, rAPS, SH2B, and PLCγ-1. Since there are multiple examples in which Grb2 also directly associates with RTKs, we utilized the yeast two-hybrid system to determine whether Grb2 could directly interact with the ICD of TrkA. We have previously shown that dimerization of the DNA binding domain of gal4 (amino acids 1–147) is sufficient to activate the kinase activity of TrkA (3.MacDonald J.I.S. Verdi J.M. Meakin S.O. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 141-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); thus, yeast expressing the TrkA-ICD were transfected with full-length Grb2 fused to the gal4 transcription factor activation domain (amino acids 761–881). Yeast co-expressing Grb-2 and either a kinase-active TrkA-ICD or a kinase-inactive TrkA-ICD (K547A, S11 mutant) were plated in the absence of His, Ade, Leu, and Trp (HALT medium) and monitored for growth in the presence of 10 mm 3-AT. As shown in Fig.1 A, positive growth was observed on the HALT plate with kinase-active but not kinase-inactive TrkA (Fig. 1 A). Yeast expressing either TrkA-ICD or Grb2 alone failed to grow when plated under similar conditions (Fig. 1,B and C), ruling out the possibility of nonspecific growth or self-activation of TrkA. As a first test of TrkA-Grb2 interaction outside of yeast, we used in vitro binding assays with GST fusion proteins encoding the SH2 and the carboxyl- and amino-terminal SH3 domains of Grb2 and baculovirus-infected insect cell lysates expressing TrkA. As shown in Fig. 2, the interaction with TrkA is mediated solely through the central SH2 domain of Grb2 with no interaction observed with either SH3 domain. This observation, together with the fact that the interaction is kinase-dependent (Fig. 1), suggests that the binding site(s) on TrkA are phosphotyrosine-dependent. Upon ligand binding, rat TrkA is phosphorylated at five intracellular tyrosines, namely Tyr499, Tyr679, Tyr683, Tyr684, and Tyr794 (19.Meakin S.O. MacDonald J.I.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1875-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As previously stated, Tyr499 serves as the binding site for the PTB domains of Shc (11.Stephens R.M. Loeb D.M. Copeland T.D. Pawson T. Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1994; 12: 691-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 23.Obermeier A. Lammers R. Wiesmuller K.-H. Jung G. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 9861-9870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), whereas Tyr794 serves as the binding site for PLCγ-1 and Chk (5.Yamashita H. Avraham S. Jiang S. Dikic I. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15059-15065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar,11.Stephens R.M. Loeb D.M. Copeland T.D. Pawson T. Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R.

Chem. 1993; 268: 22963-22966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The central core “activation loop” tyrosines (679, 683, and 684) are essential for allosteric changes involved in kinase activation (24.Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). To determine the Grb2-binding site(s) on TrkA, a series of substitution mutants (Table I) were assayed in an in vitro binding assay. In generating these mutants, we had to take into account the fact that Tyr683 and Tyr684 are essential for kinase activity (25.Cunningham M.E. Stephens R.M. Kaplan D.R. Greene L.A. J. Biol.

However, substitution of the activation loop tyrosines in TrkA with acidic amino acids (Glu and Asp) can mimic the acidic nature of the phosphotyrosines resulting in constitutive kinase activity and the subsequent activation of intracellular signaling molecules in the absence of exogenous NGF (20.Gryz E.A. Meakin S.O. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 417-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This mutation effectively allows us to maintain the kinase activity of TrkA and to then determine the role of the activation loop phosphotyrosines as direct binding sites for intracellular signaling molecules.

To accomplish this reaction, the γ-glutamyl carboxylase requires, in addition to its peptide substrate, reduced vitamin K, oxygen, and carbon dioxide as co-substrates. In vertebrates, it appears that the recognition between the nascent protein substrate and enzyme is dependent upon a “docking” reaction between the propeptide of the substrate and the enzyme. In the mollusk Conus, a propeptide also appears to dock the substrate to the carboxylase, but the substrate is quite different in sequence than that of the vertebrate propeptides (1.Bush K.A.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14660-14666Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Gla was first identified in prothrombin as a modified amino acid necessary for the activity of this vitamin K-dependent protein. Historically, Gla has been associated with coagulation factors. However, in recent years, other Gla proteins with varied functions and locations have been identified: two proteins, bone Gla protein, or osteocalcin, and matrix Gla protein, have been isolated from bone (2.Price P.A. Connect Tissue Res. 1989; 21: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar); the Gla protein Gas 6 is known to be a ligand for the receptor tyrosine kinase Axl (3.Stitt T.N. Conn G. Gore M.

The Drosophila genome, with approximately 165 million bases, is about 20-fold smaller than that of mammals. Furthermore, the sequence of the Drosophilagenome has been completed and will soon be available through GenBankTM. One of the most remarkable and valuable characteristics of Drosophila as a model organism is the fact that many of its genes have functional counterparts in humans. For example, the homeobox genes of Drosophila have been used to find their mammalian homologues. In the case of the Drosophila Deformed gene, the human homologue, HOX4B, can functionally replace its Drosophila counterpart (4.Malicki J. Cianetti L.C. Peschle C. McGinnis W. Nature. 1992; 358: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).Using the human γ-glutamyl carboxylase (hGC) amino acid sequence as query, we found a region on Drosophila chromosome 3L with strong similarity to human γ-glutamyl carboxylase. We report here the isolation of a cDNA corresponding to this gene. When expressed inSpodoptera insect cells, it produces vitamin K-dependent carboxylase activity. Mammalian substrates are not efficiently carboxylated by Drosophila γ-glutamyl carboxylase (dGC), however, which suggests differences in recognition specificities between Drosophila and mammalian substrates.DISCUSSIONThere are several interesting implications resulting from our observation that γ-glutamyl carboxylase is present inDrosophila. First, this discovery should contribute to the understanding of the evolutionary relationship among the coelomate phyla. Second, it may be a key to clarifying the relationship between structure and function in hGC. Third, the genetics ofDrosophila may facilitate the discovery of additional properties of various important Gla proteins and, furthermore, may promote the identification of the vitamin K-epoxide reductase enzyme.It is now clear that functional γ-glutamyl carboxylase enzymes exist in the phyla chordata, mollusca (7.Stanley T. Stafford D. Olivera B. Bandyopadhyay P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), andarthropoda. For convenience, a simplified evolutionary tree outlining the phyla discussed in this paragraph is shown in Fig.7. From the phylogenic tree it is apparent that the carboxylase arose in evolution before the protostome/deuterostome split. Thus, one would expect to find the γ-glutamyl carboxylase in the annelida andechinodermata and in some more primitive organisms as well. Further research to determine where γ-glutamyl carboxylase first appears in evolution will be important and interesting. A search of the complete genomic sequence of a member (Caenorhabditis) of the pseudo-coelomate phylum nematoda revealed no significant homology to γ-glutamyl carboxylase. This lack of a homologue to the carboxylase is inconsistent with the notion that nematodes (9.Aguinaldo A. Turbeville J. Linford L. Raff R. Lake J. Nature. 1997; 387: 489-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar) are closely related to the arthropods. This is probably the most interesting evolutionary aspect of our observations. However, one must remember that each organism is only one representative of thousands of diverse organisms within its phylum and that Caenorhabditisis rapidly evolving and highly specialized; therefore, it is possible other nematodes may possess γ-glutamyl carboxylase, whereas members of the phyla arthropoda and mollusca may lack it.The comparison of sequences of γ-glutamyl carboxylase from different species has additional significance in understanding the relationship between the structure and function of the enzyme. For example, one would expect that the regions of the protein with the most sequence identities would have some crucial purpose relating to either the structure or function of the γ-glutamyl carboxylase. Thus, the substrate recognition site should be conserved because glutamic acid must be recognized by all species. Similarly, one would expect the vitamin K-binding site to be conserved. The expectation that the vitamin K site is conserved is less certain, however, becauseDrosophila may use a slightly different vitamin K hydroquinone. Vitamin K1 hydroquinone does stimulate carboxylation of dGC; therefore, if a different quinone is used, it must be very similar to vitamin K1. In the mammalian enzyme, substrate affinity appears to be a result of its propeptide docking it to the enzyme rather than the affinity of the Gla domainper se. However, the dGC appears not to recognize a mammalian propeptide and in this respect is similar to the carboxylase of Conus. It has been shown that the mammalian propeptide is either poorly recognized or not recognized at all by theConus carboxylase. Nevertheless, a hydrophobic propeptide different from the commonly known mammalian propeptides appears to be present in the substrate of the Conus carboxylase (1.Bush K.A. Stenflo J. Roth D.A. Czerwiec E. Harrist A. Begley G.S. Furie B.C. Furie B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14660-14666Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 10.Olivera B.M. Walker C. Cartier G.E. Hooper D. Santos A.D. Schoenfeld R. Shetty R. Watkins M. Bandyopadhyay P. Hillyard D.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 870: 223-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Therefore, one might expect to find a propeptide-binding site on the dGC that is not homologous to the hGC-binding site but that is located in the same region we previously determined to be the location of the mammalian site (11.Wu S.-M. Mutucumarana V.P. Geromanos S. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11718-11722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). One major difference between theDrosophila and mammalian γ-glutamyl carboxylases is that the dGC is 86 amino acids shorter than the human enzyme from the carboxyl terminus. Notably, this is approximately the number of amino acids that Roth et al. (12.Roth D.A. Whirl M.L. Velazquez-Estades L.J. Walsh C.T. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5305-5311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) found could be removed from the carboxyl terminus of hGC without seriously affecting its enzymatic activity. A comparison of conserved hydrophobic amino acids between these species is also instructive. It has been known, because a number of related proteins were crystallized, that the packing of amino acids in the core of a protein must be conserved for enzyme stability (13.Xu J. Baase W.A. Baldwin E. Matthews B.W. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 158-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Also, it has since become clear that many protein-protein interactions take place through hydrophobic patches on the surface of a protein (14.Clackson T. Ultsch M.H. Wells J.A. de Vos A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 11111-11128Crossref Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Thus, examining the stability and enzymatic activity of mutations in conserved hydrophobic regions is expected to reveal whether these are surface regions or buried ones and whether they are important in particular substrate or peptide interactions.It is interesting that the Drosophila head has the highest level of γ-glutamyl carboxylase activity. Although Gla proteins traditionally have been associated with coagulation, there has been considerable evidence for several years that certain Gla proteins serve other important functions. For example, it has been recognized since the mid-1970s that warfarin therapy during pregnancy results in characteristic embryopathies, including hypoplasia and a phenotype similar to chondroplasia punctata. In addition, blindness and mental retardation occur in a significant number of cases (15.Hall J.G. Pauli R.M. Wilson K.M. Am. J. Med. 1980; 68: 122-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). The importance of carboxylation in bone was implied by the isolation of osteocalcin and matrix Gla protein from bone (2.Price P.A. Connect Tissue Res. 1989; 21: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The recent demonstration that a mouse knockout of matrix Gla protein died shortly after birth because of rupture of calcified arteries (16.Luo G. Ducy P. McKee M.D. Pinero G.J. Loyer E. Behringer R.R. Karsenty G. Nature. 1997; 386: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1732) Google Scholar) provides further proof for the more general importance of γ-glutamyl carboxylase. Still another class of Gla proteins was identified when a gene selected during growth arrest of cells in culture was found to code for a protein containing a Gla domain. This protein, called Gas-6 (17.Manfioletti G. Brancolini C. Avanzi G. Schneider C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4976-4985Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), has subsequently been shown to serve as a ligand for the receptor tyrosine kinase Axl (3.Stitt T.N. Conn G. Gore M. Lai C. Bruno J. Radziejewski C. Mattsson K. Fisher J. Gies D.R. Jones P.F. et al.Cell. 1995; 80: 661-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). It was also found that protein S, a Gla protein whose absence or defect results in severe thrombotic events (18.Simmonds R.E. Ireland H. Lane D.A. Zoller B. Garcia de Frutos P. Dahlback B. Ann. Intern. Med. 1998; 128: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), is a ligand for Tyro-3, which is closely related to Axl. Both proteins are expressed in neurons (3.Stitt T.N. Conn G. Gore M. Lai C. Bruno J. Radziejewski C. Mattsson K. Fisher J. Gies D.R. Jones P.F. et al.Cell. 1995; 80: 661-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar,19.Li R. Chen J. Hammonds G. Phillips H. Armanini M. Wood P. Bunge R. Godowski P.J. Sliwkowski M.X. Mather J.P. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2012-2019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as a number of other tissues. Two additional Gla proteins, proline-rich Gla proteins 1 and 2 (PRPG-1 and PRPG-2), were identified by searching the human genome data base for sequences homologous to the Gla domain of coagulation proteins (20.Kulman J.D. Harris J.E. Haldeman B.A. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9058-9062Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although the function of neither protein is known, both are expressed widely, with PRPG-1 having its highest levels in neural tissues and PRGP-2 having its highest levels in thyroid tissue.Until now, we have been unable to identify a Gla domain in theDrosophila genomic sequence that is recognizably similar to the Gla domains of most mammalian Gla proteins. A consensus sequence was made using Emotif (21.Nevill-Manning C.G. Wu T.D. Brutlag D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5865-5871Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) to scan the domain sequences of blood coagulation factor IX, FX, bone Gla protein, and matrix Gla proteins. This consensus sequence, EXX(E/R)EXCXXXXXXXX(L/F/Y)XXXXXXXX(A/F)(Y/W)XX(F/Y/H) (where X equals any amino acid and the letters within parentheses indicate the amino acids found at that position in the pattern), identified all of the known Gla proteins, including osteocalcin and matrix Gla protein. However, a search of theDrosophila data base using this pattern failed to identify any recognizable Gla domain. Failure to find a Gla domain similar to the canonical Gla domain of coagulation proteins is not, however, evidence against the presence of Gla proteins in Drosophila. It has been shown in mammals that attaching a propeptide of a vitamin K-dependent protein to random substrates results in the carboxylation of those substrates, both in vivo and in vitro (22.Furie B.C. Ratcliffe J.V. Tward J. Jorgensen M.J. Blaszkowsky L.S. DiMichele D. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28258-28262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 23.Stanley T.B. Wu S.M. Houben R.J. Mutucumarana V.P. Stafford D.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13262-13268Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This suggests that the structure of the Gla domain exists, not for recognition by the γ-glutamyl carboxylase, but because it is a characteristic necessary for the function of the particular vitamin K-dependent protein itself. Thus, it is likely that still other vertebrate Gla proteins, which bear no resemblance to the known Gla domains, remain to be identified. Because of its easily accessible genetics, Drosophila presents a unique opportunity to identify these new Gla proteins and then, via homology cloning, to identify the same proteins in mammals. The identification of these sequences is likely to lead to an understanding of additional roles for vitamin K-dependent proteins in mammalian cells.In summary, we have identified and made preliminary characterizations of a functional γ-glutamyl carboxylase in Drosophila. This enzyme can utilize reduced vitamin K1 as a substrate, making it very likely that the powerful genetics ofDrosophila can be used to find the gene, still not known, for the vitamin K reductase. It will also aid in our understanding of evolution and in understanding the mechanism by which the carboxylase modifies its substrates. The γ-glutamyl carboxylase catalyzes the post-translational modification of specific glutamates to γ-carboxyglutamate (Gla)1 in a number of proteins.

However, one must remember that each organism is only one representative of thousands of diverse organisms within its phylum and that Caenorhabditisis rapidly evolving and highly specialized; therefore, it is possible other nematodes may possess γ-glutamyl carboxylase, whereas members of the phyla arthropoda and mollusca may lack it.The comparison of sequences of γ-glutamyl carboxylase from different species has additional significance in understanding the relationship between the structure and function of the enzyme. For example, one would expect that the regions of the protein with the most sequence identities would have some crucial purpose relating to either the structure or function of the γ-glutamyl carboxylase. Thus, the substrate recognition site should be conserved because glutamic acid must be recognized by all species. Similarly, one would expect the vitamin K-binding site to be conserved. The expectation that the vitamin K site is conserved is less certain, however, becauseDrosophila may use a slightly different vitamin K hydroquinone. Vitamin K1 hydroquinone does stimulate carboxylation of dGC; therefore, if a different quinone is used, it must be very similar to vitamin K1. In the mammalian enzyme, substrate affinity appears to be a result of its propeptide docking it to the enzyme rather than the affinity of the Gla domainper se. However, the dGC appears not to recognize a mammalian propeptide and in this respect is similar to the carboxylase of Conus. It has been shown that the mammalian propeptide is either poorly recognized or not recognized at all by theConus carboxylase. Nevertheless, a hydrophobic propeptide different from the commonly known mammalian propeptides appears to be present in the substrate of the Conus carboxylase (1.Bush K.A. Stenflo J. Roth D.A. Czerwiec E. Harrist A. Begley G.S. Furie B.C. Furie B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14660-14666Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 10.Olivera B.M. Walker C. Cartier G.E. Hooper D. Santos A.D. Schoenfeld R. Shetty R. Watkins M. Bandyopadhyay P. Hillyard D.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 870: 223-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Therefore, one might expect to find a propeptide-binding site on the dGC that is not homologous to the hGC-binding site but that is located in the same region we previously determined to be the location of the mammalian site (11.Wu S.-M. Mutucumarana V.P. Geromanos S. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11718-11722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). One major difference between theDrosophila and mammalian γ-glutamyl carboxylases is that the dGC is 86 amino acids shorter than the human enzyme from the carboxyl terminus. Notably, this is approximately the number of amino acids that Roth et al. (12.Roth D.A. Whirl M.L. Velazquez-Estades L.J. Walsh C.T. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5305-5311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) found could be removed from the carboxyl terminus of hGC without seriously affecting its enzymatic activity. A comparison of conserved hydrophobic amino acids between these species is also instructive. It has been known, because a number of related proteins were crystallized, that the packing of amino acids in the core of a protein must be conserved for enzyme stability (13.Xu J. Baase W.A. Baldwin E. Matthews B.W. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 158-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Also, it has since become clear that many protein-protein interactions take place through hydrophobic patches on the surface of a protein (14.Clackson T. Ultsch M.H. Wells J.A. de Vos A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 11111-11128Crossref Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Thus, examining the stability and enzymatic activity of mutations in conserved hydrophobic regions is expected to reveal whether these are surface regions or buried ones and whether they are important in particular substrate or peptide interactions.It is interesting that the Drosophila head has the highest level of γ-glutamyl carboxylase activity. Although Gla proteins traditionally have been associated with coagulation, there has been considerable evidence for several years that certain Gla proteins serve other important functions. For example, it has been recognized since the mid-1970s that warfarin therapy during pregnancy results in characteristic embryopathies, including hypoplasia and a phenotype similar to chondroplasia punctata. In addition, blindness and mental retardation occur in a significant number of cases (15.Hall J.G. Pauli R.M. Wilson K.M. Am. J. Med. 1980; 68: 122-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). The importance of carboxylation in bone was implied by the isolation of osteocalcin and matrix Gla protein from bone (2.Price P.A. Connect Tissue Res. 1989; 21: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The recent demonstration that a mouse knockout of matrix Gla protein died shortly after birth because of rupture of calcified arteries (16.Luo G. Ducy P. McKee M.D. Pinero G.J. Loyer E. Behringer R.R. Karsenty G. Nature. 1997; 386: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1732) Google Scholar) provides further proof for the more general importance of γ-glutamyl carboxylase. Still another class of Gla proteins was identified when a gene selected during growth arrest of cells in culture was found to code for a protein containing a Gla domain. This protein, called Gas-6 (17.Manfioletti G. Brancolini C. Avanzi G. Schneider C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4976-4985Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), has subsequently been shown to serve as a ligand for the receptor tyrosine kinase Axl (3.Stitt T.N. Conn G. Gore M. Lai C. Bruno J. Radziejewski C. Mattsson K. Fisher J. Gies D.R. Jones P.F. et al.Cell. 1995; 80: 661-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). It was also found that protein S, a Gla protein whose absence or defect results in severe thrombotic events (18.Simmonds R.E. Ireland H. Lane D.A. Zoller B. Garcia de Frutos P. Dahlback B. Ann. Intern. Med. 1998; 128: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), is a ligand for Tyro-3, which is closely related to Axl. Both proteins are expressed in neurons (3.Stitt T.N. Conn G. Gore M. Lai C. Bruno J. Radziejewski C. Mattsson K. Fisher J. Gies D.R. Jones P.F. et al.Cell. 1995; 80: 661-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar,19.Li R. Chen J. Hammonds G. Phillips H. Armanini M. Wood P. Bunge R. Godowski P.J. Sliwkowski M.X. Mather J.P. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2012-2019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as a number of other tissues. Two additional Gla proteins, proline-rich Gla proteins 1 and 2 (PRPG-1 and PRPG-2), were identified by searching the human genome data base for sequences homologous to the Gla domain of coagulation proteins (20.Kulman J.D. Harris J.E. Haldeman B.A. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9058-9062Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although the function of neither protein is known, both are expressed widely, with PRPG-1 having its highest levels in neural tissues and PRGP-2 having its highest levels in thyroid tissue.Until now, we have been unable to identify a Gla domain in theDrosophila genomic sequence that is recognizably similar to the Gla domains of most mammalian Gla proteins. A consensus sequence was made using Emotif (21.Nevill-Manning C.G. Wu T.D. Brutlag D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5865-5871Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) to scan the domain sequences of blood coagulation factor IX, FX, bone Gla protein, and matrix Gla proteins. This consensus sequence, EXX(E/R)EXCXXXXXXXX(L/F/Y)XXXXXXXX(A/F)(Y/W)XX(F/Y/H) (where X equals any amino acid and the letters within parentheses indicate the amino acids found at that position in the pattern), identified all of the known Gla proteins, including osteocalcin and matrix Gla protein. However, a search of theDrosophila data base using this pattern failed to identify any recognizable Gla domain. Failure to find a Gla domain similar to the canonical Gla domain of coagulation proteins is not, however, evidence against the presence of Gla proteins in Drosophila. It has been shown in mammals that attaching a propeptide of a vitamin K-dependent protein to random substrates results in the carboxylation of those substrates, both in vivo and in vitro (22.Furie B.C. Ratcliffe J.V. Tward J. Jorgensen M.J. Blaszkowsky L.S. DiMichele D. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28258-28262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 23.Stanley T.B. Wu S.M. Houben R.J. Mutucumarana V.P. Stafford D.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13262-13268Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This suggests that the structure of the Gla domain exists, not for recognition by the γ-glutamyl carboxylase, but because it is a characteristic necessary for the function of the particular vitamin K-dependent protein itself. Thus, it is likely that still other vertebrate Gla proteins, which bear no resemblance to the known Gla domains, remain to be identified. Because of its easily accessible genetics, Drosophila presents a unique opportunity to identify these new Gla proteins and then, via homology cloning, to identify the same proteins in mammals. The identification of these sequences is likely to lead to an understanding of additional roles for vitamin K-dependent proteins in mammalian cells.In summary, we have identified and made preliminary characterizations of a functional γ-glutamyl carboxylase in Drosophila. This enzyme can utilize reduced vitamin K1 as a substrate, making it very likely that the powerful genetics ofDrosophila can be used to find the gene, still not known, for the vitamin K reductase. It will also aid in our understanding of evolution and in understanding the mechanism by which the carboxylase modifies its substrates. There are several interesting implications resulting from our observation that γ-glutamyl carboxylase is present inDrosophila. First, this discovery should contribute to the understanding of the evolutionary relationship among the coelomate phyla. Second, it may be a key to clarifying the relationship between structure and function in hGC. Third, the genetics ofDrosophila may facilitate the discovery of additional properties of various important Gla proteins and, furthermore, may promote the identification of the vitamin K-epoxide reductase enzyme. It is now clear that functional γ-glutamyl carboxylase enzymes exist in the phyla chordata, mollusca (7.Stanley T. Stafford D. Olivera B. Bandyopadhyay P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), andarthropoda. For convenience, a simplified evolutionary tree outlining the phyla discussed in this paragraph is shown in Fig.7. From the phylogenic tree it is apparent that the carboxylase arose in evolution before the protostome/deuterostome split. Thus, one would expect to find the γ-glutamyl carboxylase in the annelida andechinodermata and in some more primitive organisms as well. Further research to determine where γ-glutamyl carboxylase first appears in evolution will be important and interesting. A search of the complete genomic sequence of a member (Caenorhabditis) of the pseudo-coelomate phylum nematoda revealed no significant homology to γ-glutamyl carboxylase. This lack of a homologue to the carboxylase is inconsistent with the notion that nematodes (9.Aguinaldo A. Turbeville J. Linford L. Raff R. Lake J. Nature. 1997; 387: 489-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar) are closely related to the arthropods. This is probably the most interesting evolutionary aspect of our observations. However, one must remember that each organism is only one representative of thousands of diverse organisms within its phylum and that Caenorhabditisis rapidly evolving and highly specialized; therefore, it is possible other nematodes may possess γ-glutamyl carboxylase, whereas members of the phyla arthropoda and mollusca may lack it.

In fibroblasts, talin binding to lipid membranes is associated with the establishment of a signaling cascade, mediated either by integrins (3.Burridge K. Mangeat P.

In platelets, talin redistributes from the cytoplasm to the membrane during activation (6.Beckerle M.C. Miller D.E. Bertagnolli M.E. Locke S.J. J.

Biol. 1994; 112: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and cross-linking (18.Goldmann W.H. Guttenberg Z. Kaufmann S. Hess D. Ezzell R.M. Isenberg G. Eur. J.

The membrane binding capacity of talin exclusively resides in the 47-kDa N-terminal portion (20.Niggli V. Kaufmann S. Goldmann W.H. Weber T. Isenberg G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 951-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Binding of the entire talin molecule to negatively charged phospholipid bilayers has been measured, resulting in an overall binding constant of K = 2.9·106m−1 (21.Goldmann W.H. Senger R. Kaufmann S. Isenberg G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 516-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Unraveling the talin-lipid membrane interaction on a molecular level is a prerequisite for understanding the redistribution of talin from the cytoplasm to the membrane surface upon cell activation as a principal step in the initiation of a signal transduction cascade. Unlike hisactophilin, an actin-binding protein that interacts with membranes by means of a post-translationally attached myristoyl anchor (22.Hanakam F. Gerisch G. Lotz S. Alt T. Seelig A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11036-11044Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), talin is supposed to bind to phospholipid membranes via an interaction of intrinsic amino acid sequences. A similar mechanism was also proposed for vinculin (23.Tempel M. Goldmann W.H. Isenberg G. Sackmann E. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 228-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 24.Johnson R.P. Niggli V. Durrer P. Craig S.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10211-10222Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). On the basis of secondary structure predictions, three small segments of the 47-kDa head portion of the talin homodimer, corresponding to amino acid residues 21–39 (S19), 287–304 (H18), and 385–406 (H17), were suggested to be responsible for lipid binding (23.Tempel M. Goldmann W.H. Isenberg G. Sackmann E. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 228-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 25.Isenberg G. Goldmann W.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The aim of the present investigation is to experimentally test the membrane binding potential of the three talin peptides and to discuss their role as likely membrane anchors of talin. To this purpose the respective peptides have been synthesized. As membrane model systems, we chose electrically neutral or negatively charged small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs)1 and lipid monolayers at a packing density corresponding to that of a lipid bilayer (32 mN/m) (26.Seelig A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 899: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The lipid model systems were composed of either 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-3-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) or of a mixture of POPC and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-3-phosphatidylglycerol (POPG) in a molar ratio (3/1), mimicking the negative surface potential of the lipid leaflet facing the cytoplasm. The peptide conformations in solution and when bound to neutral and negatively charged SUVs are analyzed by means of CD spectroscopy. Their partition coefficients are measured using high sensitivity isothermal titration calorimetry and monolayer expansion measurements at different ionic strength and pH values. A comparison of the partition coefficients of talin peptides with those of a myristoyl or a farnesyl anchor suggests that H17 could indeed function as the principal intrinsic membrane anchor of talin. The three fragments from mouse talin (27.Rees D.J. Ades S.E. Singer S.J. Hynes R.O. Nature. 1990; 347: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) were synthesized by BioGenes, Berlin, Germany as trifluoro-acetate (S19 and H18) and chloride salts (H17), as shown in TableI. Purity as determined by high pressure liquid chromatography was >90% for S19 and H18 and >96% for H17. The peptide contents were determined by quantitative amino acid analysis.Table IAmino acid sequence of talin peptidesResiduesNameSequence+ − + +−+ −21–39(S19)PSTMVYDACRMIRERIPEA-CONH2+ − − + + + +287–304(H18)GQMSEIEAKVRYVKLARS-CONH2+− − ++++ +385–406(H17)GEQIAQLIAGYIDIILKKKKSK-CONH2 Open table in a new tab All buffers used were adjusted to pH 7.4 at the temperatures used for the respective measurements. For monolayer expansion measurements (T = 23 ± 1 °C), 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer containing 114 mm NaCl was used. For circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy (T = 23 ± 1 °C), 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer, with or without 154 mm NaF, was prepared. NaF was used instead of NaCl, since the latter strongly absorbs at low wavelength. For isothermal titration calorimetry (T = 28 °C), 50 mmTris/HCl buffer with or without 114 mm NaCl was used. POPC and POPG were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL) and were used without further purification. Small unilamellar vesicles of ∼30 nm diameter were prepared for CD spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry as follows; POPC and POPG were dissolved in chloroform (∼20 mg/ml) in appropriate molar ratio. The solvent was first evaporated under a nitrogen stream leading to a thin lipid film. To improve the homogeneity of the lipid mixture, the film was redissolved in dichloromethane, dried again under nitrogen, and subsequently dried under high vacuum overnight. The amount of lipid was determined gravimetrically, and buffer was added to the dry lipid film to the desired concentration. The lipid dispersion was vortexed and then sonicated under a nitrogen atmosphere at 5 °C until an almost clear solution was obtained. For negatively charged lipids sonification time was ∼20 min, and for electrically neutral lipids ∼35 min. Metal debris from the titanium tip was removed by centrifugation in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 8 min. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were measured with a Jasco J720 spectropolarimeter at ambient temperature. The path length of the cell was 1 mm. Spectra of peptides in solution were corrected by subtracting the buffer base line. Spectra of peptides in the presence of lipid vesicles were corrected by subtracting the spectra of the corresponding lipid vesicle dispersions. The fraction of β-sheet structure in solution was estimated by means of computer simulations based on the reference spectra of Yang et al. (28.Yang J.T. Wu C.S. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar) as well as on the basis of the spectra of Greenfield and Fasman (29.Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3317) Google Scholar). The α-helical fraction, f h, was determined according to Chen et al. (30.Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1963) Google Scholar). fh=[θ] 222θhnEquation 1 [Θ] is the mean residue ellipticity, in units of degrees (deg) cm2 dmol−1 measured at 222 nm and Θh n is the maximum absorptioon of an α-helix with n amino acid residues and is determined as follows. θhn=(1−k/n)θh∞Equation 2 k is a wavelength-dependent constant (k 222 = 2.57) and Θh∞ is the maximum ellipticity of an α-helix with infinite length (Θh∞ = −39,500 deg cm2dmol−1). The monolayer apparatus designed by Fromherz (31.Fromherz P. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1975; 46: 1380Crossref Scopus (212) Google Scholar) consists of a round Teflon trough with a total area of 362 cm2, divided into eight compartments (type RCM 2-T, Mayer Feintechnik, Göttingen, Germany). For lipid monolayer expansion experiments, two compartments were used, containing together 40 ml of solution. In order to keep humidity constant, the trough was covered by a Plexiglas hood, and compartments that were not used for measurements were filled with water. The surface pressure, π = γ0 − γ, where γ0 is the surface tension of the pure buffer and γ the surface tension of the peptide solution, was monitored by means of a Whatman no. 1 filter paper, connected to a Wilhelmy balance. The monolayer was formed by depositing a drop of lipid dissolved in hexane/ethanol (9/1, v/v) on the buffer surface between a fixed and a movable barrier, and was then left to stabilize for about 15 min. The initial area, A, of the lipid monolayer was typically around 50 cm2 and contained n L lipid molecules. Peptide dissolved in pure water (∼0.1 mm) was injected with a Hamilton syringe into the buffer subphase, which was stirred continuously by a magnetic stirring bar. During equilibration time (∼40–50 min), the surface pressure π was kept constant by means of an electronic feedback system. The penetration of n P peptide molecules into the monolayer with a penetration area, A P, gives rise to an area expansion ΔA. The mole fraction of peptide in the monolayer is defined as X b =n P/n L, and can be evaluated from the relative area increase, ΔA/A, provided A L andA P (cf. next paragraph) are known (26.Seelig A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 899: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Xb=nP/nL=(ΔA/A)(AL/AP)Equation 3 The apparent partition coefficient, K app, is Kapp=(ΔA/A)(AL/AP)/Ceq=Xb/CeqEquation 4 The equilibrium peptide concentration,C eq, is the difference between the total peptide concentration, C 0, and the concentration of the bound peptide, C b. Ceq=C0−CbEquation 5 In order to penetrate into a lipid monolayer with a lateral pressure, π, a peptide molecule has to perform the work ΔW = πA p, where the penetration area,A p, is the cross-sectional area of the peptide portion in the lipid monolayer. The free energy of penetration will vary with the monolayer surface pressure π. According to Ref. 32.Boguslavsky V. Rebecchi M. Morris A.J. Jhon D.Y. Rhee S.G. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3032-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, the variation of the partition coefficient, K app, with the surface pressure is given by the following equation. Kapp=K0e−πAp/kTEquation 6 K 0 is a proportionality constant. Combining Equations 4 and 6 yields the surface pressure dependence of the relative area increase, ΔA/A, at constantC eq under the assumption of a constant penetration area, A p, and a constant lipid area,A L. ΔA/A=(Ap/AL)K0Ceqe−πAP/kT≈const.e−πAP/kTEquation 7 The assumption of constant areas can be made to a first approximation since A L andA p change by at most 15% in the given surface pressure interval. According to Equation 7, the penetration area,A p, is determined from the slope of the ln ΔA/A versus π curve. Partitioning of cationic peptides into an electrically neutral lipid/water interface gives rise to a positive surface potential, ψ0, of the lipid layer. As a consequence the concentration of the cationic peptide at the membrane surface,C M, decreases (C eq >C M). Negatively charged lipid monolayers exhibit, in contrast, a negative surface potential that leads to an accumulation of cationic peptides close to the membrane surface (C eq < C M). The relationship between the membrane-active concentration,C M, and the bulk concentration,C eq, is given by the Bolzmann equation. CM=Ceqe−ψ0zeffF0/RTEquation 8 The surface potential, ψ0, can be approximated by means of the Gouy-Chapman theory (for details, cf. Ref. 33.Seelig J. Nebel S. Ganz P. Bruns C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9714-9721Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The peptide charge is denoted as z eff. The surface partition equilibrium can then be formulated as shown by Equation 9. Kp=Xb/CMEquation 9 K p is the hydrophobic partition coefficient. The Gouy-Chapman theory thus allows a separation of hydrophobic (K p) and electrostatic (z eff) contributions to membrane binding. Isothermal titration calorimetry was performed using an Omega high sensitivity titration calorimeter from MicroCal (Northampton, MA) (34.Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2433) Google Scholar). To avoid air bubbles, solutions were degassed under vacuum before use. The calorimeter was calibrated electrically. The data were acquired using computer software developed by MicroCal. In control experiments the corresponding suspension of SUVs (or peptide solution) was injected into buffer without peptide (lipid). Both experiments yielded small reaction heats, which were included in the final analysis. SUVs are injected into a peptide solution, causing peptide molecules to partition into the lipid bilayer. The reaction enthalpy measured at the ith lipid injection is denoted as Δhi , and the cumulative heat of reaction after the first k injection steps is Σi=1 kΔh i. The molar amount of bound peptide, np(k), is then given by Equation 10. np(k)=∑i=1kΔhi/ΔHEquation 10 ΔH is the molar reaction enthalpy. The total amount of injected lipid, nL(i), is given by Equation 11. nL(k)=CL0·Vinj·kEquation 11 CL0 is the lipid concentration of the stock solution, V inj the volume per injection, and k the number of injections. Under the present experimental conditions, the binding of peptides is presumably limited to the outside of the lipid vesicles (35.Seelig J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1331: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). For sonified lipid vesicles with a diameter of 30 nm, about 60% of the total lipid resides on the outside. The mole fraction of bound peptide in the lipid layer, Xb(k), is hence given by Equation 12. Xb(k)=np(k)/(0.6·nL(k))Equation 12 The correction factor 0.6 accounts for the lipid molecules on the vesicle outer layer. Knowledge of the bound peptide allows the calculation of the remaining free peptide concentration,C eq. A plot of Xb(k) versus Ceq yields the binding isotherm. From the binding isotherms the apparent partition coefficient,K app, can be calculated according to Equation4. Kapp=Xb(k)/CeqEquation 13 The conformations of the three talin peptides were investigated by means of CD spectroscopy in buffer solution at pH 7.4 and at physiological salt concentrations (10 mm Tris/HCl, 154 mm NaF). All three peptides show a minimum around 200 nm with a mean residue ellipticity, [Θ]200 ≤ −10·103 deg cm2 dmol−1 and a broad shoulder around 217 nm, suggesting a mixture of random coil and β-sheet conformations, increasing in the order H18 < S19 < H17. For H17 (10 μm), the β-sheet content is estimated as ∼30% according to Greenfield and Fasman (29.Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3317) Google Scholar) in good agreement with computer simulations using the method of Yang et al. (28.Yang J.T. Wu C.S. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar). The concentration of monomers in solution, C A, is evaluated according to (36.Terzi E. Hölzemann G. Seelig J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1345-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). CA=C0(1−Xβ)Equation 14 C 0 is the total peptide concentration, andX β is the mole fraction of monomers involved in β-sheet formation and can be calculated as shown in Equation15. Xβ=(%β observed)/(maximum%β­structure)Equation 15 The maximum amount of β-sheet structure for H17 is 63%, assuming that the charged ends (8 residues) are fraying. With a β-structure content of 30%, the monomer concentration is determined as C A = 5.0 μm, which corresponds to 50% of the total peptide concentration. Despite the tendency to self-associate, the three peptides are highly soluble in aqueous solution and yield clear solutions even at millimolar concentrations. The titrations of the three talin peptides with POPC/POPG (3/1) and POPC vesicles in buffer solution at pH 7.4 and different salt concentrations are summarized in Fig.1. The mean residue ellipticity, [Θ]222 at 222 nm, which is a measure for the extent of α-helix formation, is plotted as a function of the lipid-to-peptide molar ratio. The tendency to form α-helical structures upon binding to POPC/POPG (3/1) vesicles in buffer solution (pH 7.4, 10 mm Tris/HCl) increases in the order of H18 ≪ S19 < H17 in the presence (154 mm NaF) as well as in the absence of salts (not shown for H18 and S19). Binding to POPC vesicles is only observed for H17. In the absence of salts (pH 7.4, 10 mm Tris/HCl), the degree of H17 α-helicity induced by POPC/POPG (3/1) as well as by POPC vesicles reaches a final value of ∼86%. Despite this high degree of helicity, CD measurements are not suited for the quantitative evaluation of binding isotherms since H17 induces vesicle fusion at low lipid-to-peptide ratios, especially in the presence, but also in the absence, of salts, 2S.

Acta. 1956; 19: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Fig.2 shows the surface pressure, π, as a function of concentration, C (Gibbs adsorption isotherms), of the three talin peptides. At a given concentration the surface activity of the peptides increases in the order H18 < S19 < H17. H18 shows a surface pressure onset at C = 1·10−7m followed by an almost linear increase of the surface pressure, π, with log C, which is typical for a peptide in a random coil conformation (38.Seelig A. Alt T. Kürz L. Mutter M. Schneider C.H. Eberle A.N. Peptides 1992. ESCOM Science Publishers B.V., ESCOM, Leiden, Netherlands1993: 113-114Crossref Google Scholar). Around C = 8.5·10−6m, a steplike increase in surface pressure, π, with concentration, C, is observed, which indicates a pK a shift due to peptide association (39.Seelig A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1030: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For S19 and H17, a surface pressure onset is observed at C = 1.2·10−8 and C = 4·10−9m, respectively, followed by a steep sigmoidal surface pressure increase. At C = 1.6·10−6m (S19) andC = 1·10−6m andC = 2·10−6m(H17), a step-like increase in surface pressure, π, with concentration, C, is observed, again indicating a pK a shift due to peptide association. For comparison, the concentrations of surface activity onset of the peptide hormones, substance P (39.Seelig A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1030: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and somatostatin (33.Seelig J. Nebel S. Ganz P. Bruns C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9714-9721Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) is in the order of C ∼ 10−6m and the maximum surface activity reached is lower. The Gibbs adsorption isotherm thus provides direct evidence for the strong hydrophobicity and amphiphilicity of the present peptides. A lipid monolayer with a given initial area, A, and a surface pressure, π, kept constant during the insertion measurement, was spread on a buffer surface (pH 7.4, 50 mm Tris/HCl, 154 mm NaCl). Injection of the peptide into the buffer subphase gave rise to an area increase, ΔA, due to the insertion of peptides into the lipid layer. The area increase, ΔA, of a POPC/POPG (3/1) monolayer due to insertion of H17 as a function of time is shown in Fig.3 A. The equilibration time was 30–50 min. Fig. 3 B shows the relative area increase, ΔA/A, upon penetration of H17 into POPC/POPG (3/1) and POPC monolayers as a function of the surface pressure, π. The concentrations of H17 used were C 0 = 1.6·10−7 and C 0 = 5.7·10−7m, respectively. Each measurement was performed with a new lipid monolayer with a preset surface pressure, π. H17 inserts into neutral and negatively charged monolayers in the whole surface pressure range measured (π ≅ 24–32 mN/m). In the same surface pressure range, S19 (C 0 = 4.2·10−6m) inserts only into negatively charged monolayers (data not shown). H18 does not penetrate into lipid monolayers, not even at low surface pressures and relatively high concentrations (∼10−5m). From the slope of the ln ΔA/A versusπ curves (Equation 7), the penetration area of S19 and H17 in POPC/POPG (3/1) monolayers is estimated as A p = 140 ± 30 Å2 and A p = 160 ± 15 Å2, respectively, and that of H17 in POPC monolayers as A p = 148 ± 23 Å2. The partitioning of peptides S19 and H17 into lipid monolayers was measured by monitoring the relative area increase, ΔA/A, as a function of the equilibrium concentration, C eq, at constant surface pressure, π. The surface pressure was π = 32 mN/m, corresponding to the lateral packing density of a POPC bilayer (26.Seelig A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 899: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The relative area increase, ΔA/A, was transformed into the mole fraction of bound peptide,X b, according to Equation 4 using the penetration area, A P, of the peptides and the area, A L = 65 Å2 per lipid molecule. 4We assume that the average area per lipid molecule in a POPC/POPG (3/1) monolayer is identical to that in a POPC monolayer (52.Evans R.W. Williams M.A. Tinoco J. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) to a first approximation. Fig. 3 Cshows the binding isotherm of H17 for POPC/POPG (3/1) monolayers at 32 mN/m. The solid line corresponds to a binding isotherm calculated on the basis of the Gouy-Chapman theory using a charge z = +0.9, a pK a = 7.6 for the N-terminal amino group, and a hydrophobic partition coefficient,K p = 8.5·103m−1. The pH of the solution and the binding constant of sodium ions (K 0 = 0.6m−1) are taken into account (33.Seelig J. Nebel S. Ganz P. Bruns C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9714-9721Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The apparent partition coefficient of H17 for POPC monolayers was calculated as K app = (1.2 ± 0.3)·104m−1 in good agreement with the hydrophobic partition coefficient,K p, determined by means of the Gouy-Chapman theory for negatively charged monolayers. The apparent partition coefficient of H17 for POPC/POPG (3/1) monolayers (comprising electrostatic and hydrophobic contributions) wasK app = (1.1 ± 0.2)·105m−1. The apparent partition coefficient of S19 for POPC/POPG (3/1) monolayers wasK app = (2.4 ± 0.8)·102m−1. The thermodynamics of the partitioning of the three talin peptides into POPC and POPC/POPG (3/1) small unilamellar vesicles was investigated by means of high sensitivity isothermal titration calorimetry (for review, see Ref. 35.Seelig J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1331: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed at pH 7.4 (50 mm Tris/HCl) with and without 114 mmNaCl. Aliquots (10 μl) of a suspension of sonified POPC or POPC/POPG (3/1) (25–35 mm) vesicles were injected into the calorimeter cell (V cell = 1.3343 ml) containing the peptide solution. For S19 and H18 the initial peptide concentration used was C 0 = 22.9 μm. For H18 no binding reaction could be measured. For S19 the apparent partition coefficient for POPC/POPG (3/1) vesicles was determined asK app = (4.0 ± 1)·102m−1, in broad agreement with that determined by means of the monolayer expansion technique. For POPC vesicles the partition coefficient was too small to be measured. For H17 titrations were performed in four different concentration intervals. The highest concentrations o"

However, a direct biochemical proof of this in the form of an isolated protein could not be obtained for a long time. Twenty protein-coding genes and two rRNA genes are usually found in the maxicircle component of kinetoplast DNA (1.Simpson L. Annu. Rev.

Several of these proteins can only be synthesized if the corresponding mRNAs are post-transcriptionally “edited” by insertion and deletion of uridylate residues, a unique process that in extreme cases is capable of creating an entire reading frame out of a cryptic pre-mRNA sequence (3.Benne R.

Although many interesting findings could be expected, the system of kinetoplast translation remained mainly uninvestigated, and the kinetoplast-encoded subunits of respiratory complexes could not be identified (7.Speijer D. Muijsers A.O. Dekker H. De Haan A. Breek C.K.D. Albracht S.P.J. Benne R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 79: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 8.Speijer D. Breek C.K.D. Muijsers A.O.

Chem. 1992; 267: 20188-20195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because some of the mitochondrial subunits are crucial for the activity and spectral characteristics of complexes III and IV (10.Capaldi R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 569-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 11.Iwata S. Lee J.W. Okada K. Lee J.K. Iwata M. Rasmussen B. Link T.A. Ramaswamy S. Jap B.K. Science. 1998; 281: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar), their apparent absence in the corresponding cases was puzzling. The only available evidence for existence of kinetoplast-encoded proteins was the positive reactivity of antisera against synthetic or recombinant COII and NADH dehydrogenase 9 epitopes with proteins in kinetoplast lysates (12.Shaw J. Campbell D. Simpson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1989; 86: 6220-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 13.Beattie D.S. Howton M.M. Eur. J.

Hoppe-Seyler. 1997; 378: 837-841Google Scholar); however, it was not known whether the immunoreactive polypeptides represent subunits of the corresponding respiratory complexes. In addition, two recent reports (15.Tittawella I. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 16.Nabholz C. Speijer D. Schneider A. Parasitol Res. 1999; 85: 779-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) indicated that isolated kinetoplasts may be capable of thede novo protein synthesis. Only very recently, we have reported on identification of apocytochrome b, a protein derived from the 5′-edited mRNA, within a functional respiratory complex III, thus providing the first direct evidence for the functional translation in the kinetoplasts (17.Horváth A. Berry E.A. Maslov D.A. Science. 2000; 287: 1639-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this work we describe the detection by antibody probing and staining of another kinetoplast-encoded polypeptide, subunit I of cytochromec oxidase, found within the corresponding purified complex. This identification has been confirmed by determining the N-terminal amino acid sequence, which matched with the sequence predicted by the kinetoplast-encoded COI mRNA. The finding of the COI polypeptide indicates that the kinetoplast mitochondrial system of translation operates with unedited, as well as edited, templates. Cells ofLeishmania tarentolae, strain UC, were cultivated in the BHI medium as described (18.Braly P. Simpson L. Kretzer F. J. Protozool. 1974; 21: 782-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Kinetoplast-mitochondrial fractions of cells disrupted by the hypotonic lysis were obtained using flotation in Renografin density gradients as described earlier (18.Braly P. Simpson L. Kretzer F. J. Protozool. 1974; 21: 782-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic purification of respiratory complexes from the dodecyl maltoside lysates of purified kinetoplast mitochondria was performed by Blue Native/Tricine- SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (19.Schagger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial vesicles (200–400 μg of protein, as determined using a BCA* Protein Assay kit, Pierce) were lysed with 2% dodecyl maltoside (Sigma) in 200 μl of buffer containing 750 mmε-amino-n-caproic acid, 50 mm BisTris-HCl, pH 7.0, at 0 °C for 60 min. The lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g in a bench top microcentrifuge for 30 min, and the supernatant was combined with 20 μl of a 5% Coomassie G-250 (Fisher) solution made with 500 mm aminocaproic acid. Separation in the first dimension was performed in 6% Blue Native gels. After incubation of the native gel slices in an excess of a solution containing 0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol for 40 min at 37 °C, proteins were separated in the second dimension using Tricine-SDS polyacrylamide gels (19.Schagger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar) or Tris-glycine-SDS gels (20.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205492) Google Scholar). Peptides were selected for antibody production on the basis of their antigenic index values as determined by MacVector (version 5.0, Oxford Molecular). Peptide synthesis, conjugation with keyhole limpet hemacyanin, and immunization of rabbits were performed by Research Genetics, Inc. According to the colorimetric enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titration performed by the manufacturer, a standard level of reactivity against the immobilized peptide (1 μg/well) was observed in 3.0–9.0 × 10−4 dilutions of the anti-COI serum from different bleeds. The immune sera were further purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using the immobilized antigenic peptide and the QUICKPure system (Sterogene). Coupling of the peptide to activated resin, Actigel ALD, was performed in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Other conditions were as recommended by the manufacturer. For Western blot analyses, proteins were electroblotted onto Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a MilliBlot semidry electroblotting system (Millipore) at 1 mA/cm2 for 2 h in a cathode buffer containing 300 mm aminocaproic acid, 0.05% SDS titrated with solid Tris-base to pH 8.5–8.6, and an anode buffer containing 150 mm Tris, 50 mmTricine (pH 8.6), 40% methanol. In some cases the blots were stained with Ponceau S. After incubating the blot with primary antibodies, the immunoreactive polypeptides were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using the SuperSignal system (Pierce). The method represented a development of the procedure utilized previously for isolation of cytochrome c reductase from potato mitochondria (21.Berry E.A. Huang L.-S. DeRose V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9064-9077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is now allowing for the parallel purification of both cytochromec reductase and oxidase from Leishmaniakinetoplasts. 2A. Horváth, E. Berry, L.-S. Huang, and D. A. Maslov, manuscript in preparation. In brief, the dodecyl maltoside lysate of kinetoplasts was subjected to two cycles of the chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose. During the first chromatographic step, under conditions chosen to purify the reductase as described earlier (21.Berry E.A. Huang L.-S. DeRose V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9064-9077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the oxidase did not bind to the column. The flow-through fraction containing the oxidase was diluted to reduce the concentration of NaCl to 130 mm, re-applied to the DEAE-Sepharose column, and eluted with a linear gradient of 130–500 mm NaCl. The column fractions were analyzed by gel electrophoresis, and cytochromec oxidase activity was determined as described previously (7.Speijer D. Muijsers A.O. Dekker H. De Haan A. Breek C.K.D. Albracht S.P.J. Benne R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 79: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) using horse cytochrome c (Sigma). Active fractions were pooled and concentrated using Amicon Centriprep-10 centrifugal concentrators. Spectral characteristics were assayed as in the previous work (7.Speijer D. Muijsers A.O. Dekker H. De Haan A. Breek C.K.D. Albracht S.P.J. Benne R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 79: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Additional details of the procedure will be described elsewhere. Proteins were electroblotted onto Trans-Blot PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad) and stained with Coomassie R-250 (Sigma). Partial N-terminal sequencing was performed by Edman degradation at the UCR Protein Sequencing facility using an Applied Biosystems Procise 492 sequencer with an on-line high pressure liquid chromatography system for identifying phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives. For identification of cysteine residues, proteins on PVDF were reduced at 37 °C under nitrogen with 20 mm dithiothreitol in 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, and then alkylated with aqueous 3-bromopropylamine as described (22.Jue R.A. Hale J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Alternatively, proteins were reduced at 60 °C in the same buffer as above and then alkylated with 3-bromopropylamine in acetonitrile (23.Jue R.A. Hale J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Internal sequencing was performed after digestion of the gel-purified material with trypsin. Subunits of complex IV obtained from 4 mg of kinetoplast protein were visualized by staining with 0.3 mCuCl2 (24.Dzandu J.K. Johnson J.F. Wise G.E. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 174: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and eluted using Model 422 Electro-Eluter (Bio-Rad). The cathode buffer for Tricine-SDS gels (100 mmTris-Tricine, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.3) (19.Schagger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar) was used for electroelution. Trypsin digestion was performed in the same buffer with 1 μg of modified trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega) at 37 °C for 60 min. The peptides were separated in a 20% Tricine-SDS gel and electroblotted onto PVDF as described above. Isolation of the respiratory complexes from a dodecyl maltoside kinetoplast lysate by Blue Native gel electrophoresis and separation of their subunits in a second dimension gel is illustrated in Figs.1 A and 2 A, respectively. Identification of complexes III and IV was performed previously by N-terminal sequencing of some subunits, and complex V was identified by Western blot analysis with an anti-ATPase serum (25.Maslov D.A. Nawathean P. Scheel J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 207-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The subunit composition of dissociated complex IV is also shown in Fig.1 B. At least eleven major, apparently stoichiometric bands (numbered from 1 to 11) could be resolved. A very similar pattern was previously observed in a closely related species, Crithidia fasciculata (7.Speijer D. Muijsers A.O. Dekker H. De Haan A. Breek C.K.D. Albracht S.P.J. Benne R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 79: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), except that the smallest subunit was not seen. Because these polypeptides are only found in complex IV (Fig.2 A), they most likely represent the bona fide subunits of this complex. A substoichiometric band (labeled with an asterisk) could also be seen in L. tarentolae (Figs. 1 B and2 A). This component does not seem to be a true subunit of cytochrome oxidase because in two-dimensional gels (Fig. 2 A) this polypeptide is found in a broad area overlapping positions of all three complexes. A few minor bands visible in the upper part of Fig.1 B represent contaminating large subunits from complexes III and V.Figure 2Identification of COI by a two-dimensional Western blot analysis.

We also analyzed the smaller subunits (Table I and Ref. 25.Maslov D.A. Nawathean P. Scheel J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 207-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The obtained sequences did not match any predicted mitochondrial sequences from L. tarentolae or other organisms, indicating that these polypeptides are nuclear-encoded. A nuclear gene for polypeptide 1 (which we here assigned the name COIV) has been cloned and sequenced, and the results of this analysis will be presented elsewhere. Polypeptides 5–10 nearly perfectly match the corresponding subunits from C. fasciculata for which the N-terminal sequences are also available (7.Speijer D. Muijsers A.O. Dekker H. De Haan A. Breek C.K.D. Albracht S.P.J. Benne R. Mol. Biochem.

Open table in a new tab The absence of mitochondrial subunits among the stained bands in C. fasciculata was noticed earlier (7.Speijer D. Muijsers A.O. Dekker H. De Haan A. Breek C.K.D. Albracht S.P.J. Benne R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 79: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and was proposed to be because of the aggregation of these hydrophobic proteins upon dissociation of the complexes in SDS. To search for substoichiometric amounts of these polypeptides, which still may be present in gels, we have used an immunological approach, which is potentially more sensitive than staining. The predicted L. tarentolae COI polypeptide contains 549 amino acids, 62% of which are represented by eight nonpolar residues with leucine (15.3%), phenylalanine (14.4%), and isoleucine (9.3%) being the most abundant. The protein contains multiple predicted transmembrane domains and appears to be almost entirely hydrophobic when analyzed by hydropathy plots (26.de la Cruz V.F. Neckelmann N. Simpson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15136-15147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two other kinetoplast-encoded polypeptides, COII and COIII, have similar properties, and according to antigenic index analysis, all these subunits contain few potential epitopes (data not shown). Only in COI did we identify an internal undecameric peptide (CDRNFNTSFYD, amino acid positions 214–224) with a relatively high antigenic index and used it for antibody production. To ascertain the specificity of the assays, we have immunoaffinity purified the obtained polyclonal sera using the immobilized peptide. The unpurified serum produced multiple bands on a Western blot of the kinetoplast lysate; however, after the purification only a subset of minor bands remained (data not shown). Because, as shown below, these bands represent a specific immune reaction, the step of immunopurification was crucial for removing the low specificity or cross-reactive components from the serum. When the lysate was fractionated in a two-dimensional gel and probed with the purified antibodies, we observed three major immunoreactive bands, a, b and c, in the region of the gel which corresponded to Complex IV (Fig. 2 B). The observed bands did not comigrate with the Coomassie-stained bands of nuclear subunits and no other protein bands could be correlated with the immunoreactive bands. This selectivity indicated the presence among the complex IV dissociation products of some minor components bearing the COI epitope. These components were insufficient for staining in a regularly loaded two-dimensional BN gel (200–400 μg of kinetoplast protein/native gel dimension). A similar set of immunoreactive bands could also be seen on single-dimensional Western blots of kinetoplast lysates, but the intensities of these bands varied between lysates and between gels as illustrated by Fig. 3. In addition, a number of minor bands could be seen on one-dimensional blots of total lysates (Fig. 3) and on two-dimensional blots when higher amounts of the serum or increased gel loads were used (not shown). The pattern of the additional bands, unlike the major bands, was not entirely reproducible. Provided there is no significant cross-reactivity of the antibodies with some other polypeptides, the multiplicity of major immunoreactive bands points toward the possibility of aggregation of the immunoreactive polypeptides. The putative COI polypeptides showed an unusual relative migration; when the Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gel concentration was increased from 9 to 14%, the apparent estimated size of polypeptide c also increased from 32 to 38 kDa, and the sizes of components band a increased from 49 to 74 kDa and from 59 to 100 kDa, respectively. This method was, therefore, inappropriate to determine their sizes. In contrast, the relative migration of nuclear subunits was mostly independent of the gel concentration. The size of polypeptide c was then approximately estimated by a Ferguson plot analysis in a series (9, 11, 13, and 15%) of gels concentrations, and the obtained value (65–76 kDa) was close enough to the predicted size of COI (63 kDa). The sizes of components a andb were outside of the calibrated range in Ferguson plots, with component b being larger than 150 kDa and componenta even larger. These results suggest that componentc is the best candidate for a full size monomeric COI protein, whereas components a and b represent aggregates of COI and, probably, some other polypeptides. Results of the N-terminal sequencing described below confirmed these conclusions. The property of aberrant migration was used to separate the putative COI polypeptides from all other subunits of complex IV (Fig. 4). The dodecyl maltoside kinetoplast extract was fractionated in a BN gel followed by a 9% Tris-glycine gel in the second dimension. The gel slice, containing resolved subunits of cytochrome oxidase, was then subjected to the third dimension electrophoresis in a 14% Tris-glycine gel. Subunits with an unchanged relative mobility are found on the main diagonal and included the asterisk band and cytochrome oxidase nuclear-encoded bands 1, 2, and 3, whereas the smaller subunits 4–11 are found along the vertical line corresponding to the running front of the 9% gel (Fig. 4 A). When a similar three-dimensional gel was electroblotted and probed with the anti-COI serum, the major immunoreactive components a, b,and c were detected above the diagonal line (Fig.4 B), as was the minor spot c*, migrating just ahead of b, and a high molecular weight smear. Another minor spot d was seen between bands 4 and 5 in the front region of the 9% gel, but this spot was not reproducible. Unexpectedly, we also detected the minor spot, designatedc′, with the same mobility in the 14% gel as the spotc but located in a position that suggests that the componentc′ may have originated from the component c*during the incubation of the 9% gel slice in SDS/mercaptoethanol prior to the separation in the 14% gel. Ferguson plot estimates forc* suggested that it could be a dimer of c. Moreover, the position of another minor spot (c“) suggested that the same component (c) is also released from a higher molecular weight material. Similarly, the position of the spotb′ may indicate that component a can dissociate releasing component b (and probably c as well). Because component c most likely represents the full size COI, the larger components correspond to various aggregation products, which may include not only COI but also some other polypeptides. The spot d is possibly a COI breakdown product. Examination of the gel shown in Fig. 4 A reveals the presence of the weakly stained material comigrating with the spots aand b. The putative monomeric COI (component c) could not be seen in stained three-dimensional gels even with the maximally increased gel loading. To visualize this component by staining, we purified cytochromec oxidase by DEAE-Sepharose chromatography. Because COI represents a catalytic subunit that contains both hemes of the enzyme, it was important to ascertain a functional and structural integrity of the obtained preparation. The presence of hemes a anda 3 and the absence of a significant contamination by cytochrome bc1 followed from the presence of a reduced absorption maximum at 604 nm and the absence of the maxima at 559 and 529 nm (data not shown). Thea+a3 heme content calculated from the analysis of dithionite-reduced minus ferricyanide-oxidized spectra (assuming absorbance coefficient of 24 mm−1cm−1) was 1.9 nmol/mg, representing about 25% of the value reported for a mammalian enzyme (27.Kuhn-Nentwig L. Kadenbach B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 147-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The specific activity of the enzyme obtained in several isolations was 0.50–1.37 units/mg. These values were similar or exceeding the corresponding parameters reported previously for the oxidase from C. fasciculata (7.Speijer D. Muijsers A.O. Dekker H. De Haan A. Breek C.K.D. Albracht S.P.J. Benne R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 79: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), also demonstrating that the isolated enzyme has a high level of purity and structural integrity and, therefore, must contain a full set of catalytic subunits including COI. Additional details of the enzymatic properties, as well as the nuclear subunit composition in comparison with the electrophoretically purified oxidase, will be described elsewhere. Here we only note, that the nuclear subunits 2 and 3 (COV and COVI, respectively) are probably not so tightly associated with the complex compared with other subunits and appear to be underrepresented in the gel shown in Fig. 4 C. With respect to COI, using 50 μg of the purified enzyme/two-dimensional gel we could clearly observe the putative monomeric COI (component c) and the high molecular weight components in their characteristic positions by Coomassie staining (Fig. 4 C). The banding pattern of the major COI-related components (a, b, and c) on immunoblots of the isolated enzyme (Fig. 4 D) was very similar to the BN-purified oxidase (Fig. 4 B), although dissociation of components a and b was not always observed. The material corresponding to components c and b could also be seen on Coomassie-stained PVDF blots but the staining intensity was lower, indicating a poor blotting efficiency or a low level retention on the membrane. Because originally no N-terminal sequence of componentc could be obtained, we suggested that the polypeptide could be blocked on the N terminus. To overcome this obstacle, we treated the blotted polypeptides with 0.5 N HCl in methanol at room temperature for 90 min, a deblocking procedure suggested for the removal of a formyl group from the terminal N-formylmethionine of bovine COII (28.Steffens G.J. Buse G. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1979; 360: 613-619PubMed Google Scholar). The drawback of this procedure is that it seems to introduce internal random cleavages, which result in an increased background during Edman degradation. Nevertheless, we could confidently determine several N-terminal residues. The consensus sequence derived from five independent sequence determinations was: MFXLXLVXLSVS. To identify the amino acid residues in positions 3, 5, and 8, sequencing was repeated twice more following reduction-alkylation of the PVDF-immobilized material. A clear presence of cysteine residues was determined in positions 5 and 8; therefore, the N-terminal sequence of the identified polypeptide was: MFXLCLVCLSVS. This sequence shows a very good match with the predicted COI sequence (MFWLCLVCLSVS), except for tryptophan in position 3, which remained undetermined. It should be mentioned that determination of tryptophan is often problematic, especially when polypeptides are present in low amounts. Attempts were undertaken to determine internal sequences of COI, but they were unsuccessful. We were able to isolate a sufficient amount of electrophoretically homogeneous monomeric COI using two successive (9% followed by 14%) preparative gels. However, there was no detectable digestion of this polypeptide by trypsin under conditions when a control sample (subunit COIV) was completely digested by the enzyme (data not shown). A reason for this resistance is not clear, but it may be related to an increased amount of SDS bound to the polypeptide. We are currently attempting to utilize a chemical cleavage procedure. It was also possible to determine nine N-terminal residues of componentb. As could be expected for this aggregated component, the obtained sequence was heterogeneous. Nevertheless, the N-terminal sequence of COI (except for tryptophan and cysteines) was clearly discernable. Interestingly, the sequence of another mitochondrial subunit, COIII (MFVRVIFVG), could be tentatively recognized in the mixed sequence. These results confirmed that component b is an aggregate and suggested that it contains COIII in addition to COI. The residues derived from the N-terminal sequence of COII (MAFILSFWM) could not be detected, except for the first position methionine and the seventh position phenylalanine, which are shared with COIII. The monomeric forms of COII and COIII with the predicted sizes 24 and 34 kDa, respectively, should migrate ahead of the monomeric COI and may represent some minor bands that are found in the corresponding gel regions (data not shown). Component a was not sequenced because it could not be blotted on PVDF. In kinetoplast mitochondria of trypanosomatids there is a unique system of RNA processing termed RNA editing. Most, but not all, mRNA species must be processed by editing to become translatable. Investigations of how the systems of editing and translation may interact with each other to produce functional products are of great interest; however, the very existence of a functional translation system could not be unequivocally demonstrated for a long time. The evidence for the kinetoplast translation should include isolation of the putative kinetoplast-encoded proteins from the corresponding molecular complexes and demonstration of their cognate structure. We have recently identified a kinetoplast-encoded protein, apocytochromeb in L. tarentolae, which is translated from an edited mRNA (17.Horváth A. Berry E.A. Maslov D.A. Science. 2000; 287: 1639-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The work presented here describes a protein, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, translated from an mRNA that is not edited. With the aim of identifying kinetoplast mitochondrial subunits, we have first analyzed the composition of cytochrome c oxidase directly purified from a kinetoplast lysate by a BN gel electrophoresis. All eleven subunits of the enzyme detected in denaturing gels by staining turned out to be nuclear encoded. A similar result was obtained previously for the enzyme from a closely related organism, C. fasciculata (7.Speijer D. Muijsers A.O. Dekker H. De Haan A. Breek C.K.D. Albracht S.P.J. Benne R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 79: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 8.Speijer D. Breek C.K.D. Muijsers A.O. Hartog A.F. Berden J.A. Albracht S.P.J. Samyn B. Van Beeumen J. Benne R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 171-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The larger subunits from both species form a very similar banding pattern and subunits 5–10, for which direct comparisons are possible, show nearly identical N termini. The mitochondrial encoded subunits COI, II, and III are not visible in the gels; however, a protein with the predicted molecular mass of COII was detected in C. fasciculata by mass spectrometry (14.Breek C.K. Speijer D. Dekker H. Muijsers A.O. Benne R. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1997; 378: 837-841Google Scholar). Given the catalytic role of the mitochondrial subunits in cytochromec oxidase, their apparent absence needs to be explained. It was suggested (7.Speijer D. Muijsers A.O. Dekker H. De Haan A. Breek C.K.D. Albracht S.P.J. Benne R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 79: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 8.Speijer D. Breek C.K.D. Muijsers A.O. Hartog A.F. Berden J.A.

Parasitol. 1997; 85: 171-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) that these subunits were lost by aggregation and precipitation upon dissociation of the complex in SDS. The mammalian COI and COIII are also prone to aggregation, although they still can be seen in stained gels (29.Merle P. Kadenbach B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 105: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). A similar explanation was also employed to address the apparent absence of the apocytochrome b among the gel-separated subunits of the bc1 complex inC. fasciculata (9.Priest J.W. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20188-20195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Results presented in this study and the previous work (17.Horváth A. Berry E.A. Maslov D.A. Science. 2000; 287: 1639-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) shed light on this problem. Using specific antibodies we have detected COI in a specific association with the cytochrome c oxidase complex in BN/Tricine-SDS two-dimensional gels. This subunit was observed forming multiple bands suggesting a possibility of aggregation or oligomerization. The detected polypeptides showed aberrant electrophoretic migration in SDS gels, indicating that their charge to mass ratio is different from other subunits, a property that can be explained by a high hydrophobicity leading to an increased binding of SDS. Ferguson plot estimates suggested that one of these polypeptides, component c, represents a full size monomeric COI. Then, based on the property of aberrant migration and using denaturing two-dimensional gels, we could separate the monomeric and aggregated forms of COI from the more abundant subunits, which showed a normal migration. Because the minor components were no longer obscured, this procedure also allowed us to visualize COI by staining when higher loads of oxidase were used. It should be noted, that isoelectric focusing could not be used to separate COI molecules, because they apparently require sufficient amounts SDS in order to remain in solution. Replacing SDS with a nonpolar detergent and urea probably leads to precipitation. The loss of COI seems to be complete, because no signal can be detected on the corresponding Western blots. 3A. Horváth and D. A. Maslov, unpublished results. After visualization of COI, the putative monomeric spot was blotted, and we could determine eleven of the twelve N-terminal residues. A match was found with the sequence predicted from the corresponding kinetoplast mRNA. The COI is encoded by an mRNA, which does not require editing. To resolve the question regarding translation of edited templates, we have recently used a similar two-dimensional gel system for detection in thebc1 complex of the putative apocytochromeb, which is derived from an edited mRNA (17.Horváth A. Berry E.A. Maslov D.A. Science. 2000; 287: 1639-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The second subunit, COII, and the third subunit, COIII, still have to be found. It is likely that the high molecular weight aggregates, and component b in particular, contain not only COI, but COIII as well. With the availability of specific antibodies it will be possible to search for these subunits. We thank Ed Berry for advice, Ying Qian for help at the initial stage of the project, and Marian Peris for critical reading of the manuscript."

The most widespread nickel metalloenzyme is urease (EC 3.5.1.5), which has been identified in prokaryotes, fungi, algae, plants, and invertebrates. Ureases allow their hosts to utilize urea as a source of nitrogen. They are also important virulence factors in bacteria and fungi (reviewed in Refs. 3.Mobley H.L.T. Hausinger R.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 85-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 4.Mobley H.L.T. Island M.D. Hausinger R.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 451-480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Urease-mediated hydrolysis of urea yielding ammonium ion and carbamate is the common mechanism of biological urea degradation, although an alternative mechanism is known. In baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, other yeasts, and certain green algae, the breakdown of urea is mediated by a biotin- and ATP-dependent carboxylation to give 1-carboxyurea (allophanate) and subsequent hydrolysis to ammonia and carbon dioxide (5.Sumrada R.A. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9119-9127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe contains a urease and is able to grow on urea as the sole source of nitrogen. The soluble, cytoplasmic urease has been purified to homogeneity, and its kinetic properties have been determined (6.Lubbers M.W. Rodriguez S.R. Honey N.K. Thornton R.J. Can. J. Microbiol. 1996; 42: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Its structural gene (ure1 +) has been cloned and sequenced, and a knockout mutation was shown to inhibit the growth of S. pombe on agar plates containing 10 mm urea as the nitrogen source (7.Tange Y. Niwa O. Curr. Genet. 1997; 32: 244-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). S. pombe urease is neither controlled by nitrogen repression nor by urea induction (6.Lubbers M.W. Rodriguez S.R. Honey N.K. Thornton R.J. Can. J. Microbiol. 1996; 42: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). High affinity nickel transport, a prerequisite for the biosynthesis of nickel-containing metalloenzymes, and the underlying uptake mechanisms have been investigated in a number of prokaryotes (reviewed in Refs. 8.Eitinger T. Friedrich B. Winkelmann G. Carrano C.J. Transition Metals in Microbial Metabolism. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam, The Netherlands1997: 235-256Google Scholarand 9.Eitinger T. Mandrand-Berthelot M.-A. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 173: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Comparable transporters, however, have not yet been reported for eukaryotes. Trace amounts of Ni2+ ion are sufficient for maximal urease activity of S. pombe, and this activity was not stimulated by the addition of Ni2+ to the medium (6.Lubbers M.W. Rodriguez S.R. Honey N.K. Thornton R.J. Can. J. Microbiol. 1996; 42: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This result suggested that an uptake system with a very high affinity for Ni2+ operates in fission yeast. The S. pombe genome sequencing project identified an open reading frame (Nic1p) that displays similarity to a family of bacterial transition metal permeases (9.Eitinger T. Mandrand-Berthelot M.-A. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 173: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In the present report we show that interruption of the respective gene strongly affected urease activity under conditions of nickel limitation and prevented the growth of S. pombe on urea. We demonstrate that Nic1p is a high affinity nickel permease. This is the first example of this kind of transporter in a eukaryotic organism. We also present evidence that nonspecific metal uptake systems allow S. pombe to transport Ni2+ ion under certain conditions. S. pombevar. pombe 972 h−s Lindner (wild type, DSM 70576) was obtained from the Deutsche Sammlung für Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH (Braunschweig, Germany). S. pombe strain FY254 (ATCC 201402) (h− can1–1 leu1–32 ade6-M210 ura4-D18) was a gift of Susan Forsburg (The Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA) and was used as the parental strain for gene interruption. S. pombestrains were grown in YES (0.5% w/v yeast extract, 3% w/vd-glucose) medium or in Edinburgh minimal medium (EMM) (10.Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3143) Google Scholar) at 30 °C. Under standard conditions, adenine, l-leucine, and uracil were added as supplements to both media to give final concentrations of 100 μg/ml. Cell densities of cultures in YES medium were calculated upon measuring the optical density (A 595) in a spectrophotometer and establishing the ratio between A 595 and the cell concentration. One A 595 unit corresponded to 2.2 × 107 colony-forming units/ml. Growth on urea as the nitrogen source was monitored on agar plates containing a modified EMM medium. The aforementioned supplements were added to final concentrations of 10 μg/ml, and urea (10 mm) was supplied in place of ammonium salt as the nitrogen source. Plasmids containingS. pombe DNA were propagated in Escherichia colistrains DH5αF′ (Life Technologies, Inc.) and XL1-Blue (Stratagene, Amsterdam) and the Dam− strain GM2163 (New England Biolabs, Schwalbach, Germany). Recombinant E. coli strains were grown in LB medium supplemented with appropriate antibiotics. The nic1 + gene was cloned following amplification using total DNA of S. pombewild-type strain 972 h− as the template. Cells (10 ml) grown overnight in YES medium were harvested, washed in SCE buffer (900 mm sorbitol, 50 mm sodium citrate, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.5), and resuspended in 350 μl SCE buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol (0.8% w/v) and lyticase (Sigma) (1 mg/ml). After 30 min at 37 °C, the cells were pelleted and lysed by vigorous shaking after the addition of 250 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris hydrochloride, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2% w/v Triton X-100, 1% w/v SDS), 300 mg of acid-washed glass beads (Sigma), and 250 μl of phenol/chloroform/2-pentanol (25:24:1 v/v). After the addition of 200 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris hydrochloride, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) and centrifugation, nucleic acids in the aqueous phase were precipitated with ethanol. The pellet was washed with 70% (w/v) ethanol, dried under vacuum, resuspended in 50 μl of distilled water containing 5 μg of RNase A, and stored at 4 °C. 1 μl of this sample was used for PCR (30 cycles of 20 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 50 °C, 2 min at 72 °C) in the presence of primer A (5′-GCGCCTCGAGATAAACACGTTTAAGCATCACC-3′), primer B (5′-CGAAAAAGAGCTCGGCATTAAACATACC-3′) (Fig.1), and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Pan Systems, Aidenbach, Germany). The purified PCR product was incubated with restriction endonucleases XhoI andSacI and ligated into vector pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene). For interruption of nic1 +, this plasmid was isolated from E. coli GM2163. 246 base pair ofnic1 were deleted by incubation with BclI andSpeI. The fragment was replaced by a 1.8-kilobaseBamHI/XbaI fragment harboring the S. pombe ura4 + marker gene (a gift of Jürg Kohli, Universität Bern, Switzerland). The disrupted nic1gene (nic1-1) was amplified by PCR (30 cycles of 20 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 45 °C, 2.5 min at 72 °C) using primer A, primer P4 (5′-CGGGAGCTCTCAAACCTTAGAATCCACTGTATCG-3′) (Fig. 1) andTaq DNA polymerase. Approximately 20 μg of the purified PCR product was used to transform S. pombe FY254 by the method of Bähler et al. (11.Bähler J. Wu J.-Q. Longtine M.S. Shah N.G. McKenzie III, A. Steever A.S. Wach A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar). A 20-ml culture of FY254 in YES was grown to a density of approximately 107cells/ml. The cells were washed twice with distilled water and once with LiAc/TE (100 mm lithium acetate, 10 mmTris-hydrochloride, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) and resuspended in 100 μl of LiAc/TE. 20 μg each of carrier DNA (sheared salmon sperm DNA, Stratagene), and the PCR product was added. After 10 min at room temperature, 260 μl of polyethylene glycol 4000 (40% w/v in LiAc/TE) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. Finally, 43 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide was added followed by heating to 42 °C for 5 min. The cells were washed and resuspended in 500 μl of distilled water. 250 μl was plated on uracil-free EMM agar. Colonies of ura4 +-containing transformants appeared after 4 days and were purified by streaking on uracil-free agar plates. The disruption of nic1 + in recombinants was verified by PCR analysis (primer combinations P1 (5′-GGGCATATGTCTGAATATGTTAAACC-3′)/P4 and P1/B) and Southern blotting (Fig. 1). For the latter purpose, a PCR product obtained with primers P1 and P4 and the nic1 + allele as the template was labeled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and used as the probe. Nickel accumulation inS. pombe strains was analyzed by a modification of the method previously described for the analysis of recombinant E. coli (12.Wolfram L. Friedrich B. Eitinger T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1840-1843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Eitinger T. Wolfram L. Degen O. Anthon C. J. Biol.

S. pombe cells were grown to an optical density (A 595) of approximately 1.5 in YES medium containing 63NiCl2 (24.4 TBq/mol) and the indicated supplements. Cells were harvested, washed twice with 50 mm Tris hydrochloride, pH 7.5, and concentrated 10-fold. The radioactivity of 50 μl of the cell suspension was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting in a Canberra-Packard 1600 TR counter using Zinsser Aquasafe 300 Plus as scintillation mixture. Nickel accumulation is expressed as pmol/109 cells. S. pombe strains were grown in 10 ml of YES medium to an optical density (A 595) of approximately 5 absorbance units, harvested, washed twice, and resuspended in 10 ml of transport buffer (20 mm MES/NaOH, pH 6.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 2% w/vd-glucose) and equilibrated at 30 °C in a water bath shaker for 5 min. 63NiCl2 (24.4 TBq/mol) was added to a final concentration of 10 nm. Samples (200 μl) were taken at the indicated time points, passed through Whatman glass microfiber filters (GF/C), and washed twice with 3.5 ml of glucose-free transport buffer. The radioactivity of filter-bound cells was analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. Nickel transport is expressed as pmol/109 cells. Cells were grown in 50 ml of YES medium overnight in the presence of the indicated supplements, harvested, washed, and resuspended in 2 ml potassium phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 7.5). After two passages through a French pressure cell, the crude extracts were separated by ultracentrifugation (59,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). 20 μl of the supernatant (containing approximately 300 μg of protein) was added to 880 μl of potassium phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 7.5), and the mixture was equilibrated at 37 °C. The reaction was started by the addition of 100 μl of a freshly prepared urea solution (100 mm). Urease activity was determined spectrophotometrically by quantitating the rate of ammonium ion released from urea. For this purpose, ammonium ion was converted into indophenol (15.Fawcett J.K. Scott J.E. J. Clin. Pathol. 1960; 13: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1940) Google Scholar). Protein was estimated by a modification of the Lowry method (16.Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7134) Google Scholar). Urease activity is expressed in milliunits/mg of protein. One milliunit corresponds to 1 nmol of urea hydrolyzed/min. The amino acid sequence alignment shown in Fig.2 identified Nic1p of S. pombeas the first eukaryotic member of a family of transporters found in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (for a review, see Ref. 9.Eitinger T. Mandrand-Berthelot M.-A. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 173: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The bacterial counterparts consist of 337 to 381 amino acid residues and contain 8 transmembrane segments. Four characteristic amino acid signatures are conserved in these permeases, as follows. The motifs (R/K)HAXDADH(I/L) and FXXGHS(T/S)(V/I)V are located within transmembrane segments II and III, respectively, and have been shown to be critical for transport activity. Likewise, the motifs LGX(D/E)T(A/S)(T/S)E and GMXXXD(T/S)XD (located in transmembrane segments V and VI, respectively) are conserved and important for activity. A common feature of this family of membrane proteins is a highly charged hydrophilic loop connecting transmembrane segments IV and V. Deletions in this loop abolish activity (reviewed in Ref. 9.Eitinger T. Mandrand-Berthelot M.-A. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 173: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Hydropathy profile (9.Eitinger T. Mandrand-Berthelot M.-A. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 173: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and amino acid sequence alignments (Fig. 2) revealed that Nic1p is closely related to the bacterial counterparts. The aforementioned sequence motifs are fully conserved. The putative transmembrane helices IV and V of Nic1p are linked by a hydrophilic loop (residues 164 to 208) containing 12 potentially charged residues. nic1+ is located on chromosome III of S. pombe between the long terminal repeat of a Tf2-type retrotransposon and an open reading frame of unknown function. The strategy for gene interruption is illustrated in Fig. 1. 246 base pairs ofnic1 + were deleted and replaced by an approximately 1.8-kilobase ura4 + marker gene (17.Grimm C. Kohli J. Murray J. Maundrell K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1988; 215: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Using 20 μg of the amplified construct for transformation intoS. pombe FY254, approximately 1,000 transformants were obtained on uracil-free EMM agar plates. Two transformants were chosen and shown by PCR (Fig. 1 B) and Southern blotting (Fig.1 C) to contain the disrupted nic1 allele. Both mutants grew normally in mineral medium in the presence of ammonium salt as the nitrogen source as well as in complex medium, indicating that nic1 + is dispensable under both conditions. Based on the similarity to the bacterial nickel permeases, we suspected that Nic1p plays a role in nickel transport into S. pombe cells. To investigate this hypothesis, nickel accumulation of growing cells of the S. pombe nic1-1 mutant was compared with metal uptake by the parental strain under various conditions (Table I). In the presence of 5 μm63NiCl2 in complex medium, both strains accumulated high amounts of Ni2+ ion. The addition of magnesium salt to the medium resulted in a 20-fold decrease in nickel accumulation. At a low Ni2+ concentration (100 nm), the nic1-1 mutation caused a moderately reduced Ni2+ accumulation when the medium was not supplemented with Mg2+ ion. In the presence of 10 mm Mg2+, however, a strong effect was observed. Although 109 cells of the parental strain accumulated 48 pmol of nickel, metal accumulation of the nic1-1 mutant decreased to 4 pmol of nickel/109 cells (Table I). A series of nickel accumulation experiments performed at substrate concentrations between 25 and 150 nm in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2 (Fig. 3) confirmed the assumption that Nic1p acts as a high affinity nickel transporter in S. pombe. This conclusion was further substantiated by uptake assays with resting cells in buffer. While thenic1-1 mutant was unable to transport63Ni2+ over the 50-min test period, significant transport was observed for the parental strain (Fig.4).Table INickel accumulation of the S. pombe nic1-1 mutant during growth in complex mediumStrain63Ni2+ accumulation5 μm63Ni2+5 μm63Ni2+, 10 mm Mg2+100 nm63Ni2+100 nm63Ni2+, 10 mm Mg2+pmol × (10 9 cells) −1Parent11,63547616448nic1–110,2455401034Cells were grown in YES medium in the presence of63NiCl2 to a density of approximately 3.3 × 107 cells/ml.

Our data are compatible with the view that S. pombe is able to transport Ni2+ ion by nonspecific Mg2+uptake systems. A similar situation has been reported for S. cerevisiae (18.MacDiarmid C.W. Gardner R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1727-1732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Lesions in the two S. cerevisiae genesALR1 and ALR2 were found to produce a magnesium-deficient phenotype while conferring increased resistance to certain metal ions including the divalent ions of the transition metals copper, manganese, nickel, and zinc. Alr1p and Alr2p belong to the CorA family of membrane transporters, the most widespread type of nonspecific Mg2+ uptake system in bacteria and archaea (19.Kehres D.G. Lawyer C.H. Maguire M.E. Microb. Comp. Genomics. 1998; 3: 151-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Alr1p- and Alr2p-like proteins are also encoded in the genome ofS. pombe. The respective open reading frames (O13779 and O13657) together with Alr1p and Alr2p contain large N-terminal extensions compared with their prokaryotic counterparts and represent a CorA subfamily (19.Kehres D.G. Lawyer C.H. Maguire M.E. Microb. Comp. Genomics. 1998; 3: 151-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). At very low Ni2+ concentrations and high molar ratios of Mg2+ to Ni2+, Ni2+ uptake ofS. pombe was dependent on Nic1p. This result indicated that nonspecific systems contribute little to Ni2+ uptake under conditions that reflect the situation in the natural environment. To test the specificity of Nic1p, the effect of cadmium, cobalt, copper, manganese, and zinc ions on nickel accumulation of S. pombe FY254 was investigated. For this purpose, the cells were grown in YES medium containing 100 nm63NiCl2 and 10 mmMgCl2. Under these conditions, high level nickel accumulation is dependent on Nic1p. The competing metal ions were added to final concentrations of 1 μm. With the exception of Co2+, none of the metal ions caused significant inhibition of nickel accumulation (data not shown). The effect of Co2+was analyzed in more detail. Fig. 5illustrates that Co2+ was an inhibitor. At a 50-fold excess, Co2+ ion abolished 63Ni2+accumulation in S. pombe. We then addressed the question of whether Nic1p is capable of transporting Co2+ ion. Thenic1-1 mutant and its parental strain FY254 were grown in YES medium supplemented with 57CoCl2 at concentrations between 100 and 500 nm in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2. Both strains were able to accumulate cobalt, and no obvious difference was found under any conditions tested (data not shown). This result suggested that Nic1p is not the main mediator of Co2+ uptake. The observed Co2+accumulation could be due to the activity of a nonspecific transition metal transporter of the Nramp (natural resistance-associated macrophage protein) family. Three Nramp-like proteins (Smf1p, Smf2p, and Smf3p) have been identified in S. cerevisiae, and a homologous open reading frame (Q10177) is also encoded in the genome of S. pombe (see Refs. 20.Nelson N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4361-4371Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar and 21.Radisky D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4481-4484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar for recent reviews). To elucidate the physiological consequences of the nic1-1 mutation, we first monitored growth on mineral agar plates containing 10 mm urea as the nitrogen source (not shown). Although S. pombe FY254 formed colonies similar to those observed on ammonium-containing plates after 3 to 4 days, the nic1-1 mutant failed to grow on urea under standard conditions. Growth of the mutant was partially restored by adding nickel salt at μm concentrations to the medium. At Ni2+ concentrations above 500 μm, growth of both strains as well as the wild-type strain 972 h− was completely inhibited. S. pombe harbors a putative metallothionein and has recently been shown to produce a phytochelatin synthase (22.Clemens S. Kim E.J. Neumann D. Schroeder J.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3325-3333Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Metallothioneins and phytochelatins mainly mediate resistance toward cadmium, copper, and zinc and apparently do not allowS. pombe to escape nickel toxicity under the conditions tested. We next investigated the role of Nic1p in urea metabolism by quantitative urease assays (Table II). Upon growth of the cells in standard YES medium, soluble extracts of the nic1-1 mutant and its parental strain contained urease-specific activities of approximately 200 to 250 milliunits/mg of protein. These values were in good agreement with those published previously (6.Lubbers M.W. Rodriguez S.R. Honey N.K. Thornton R.J. Can. J. Microbiol. 1996; 42: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The addition of NiCl2 (5 μm) to the growth medium resulted in a slightly increased urease activity of strain FY254. Surprisingly, high concentrations of MgCl2(20 mm) had almost no effect on urease activity of both strains. Under comparable conditions, efficient Ni2+ uptake was dependent on Nic1p (Table I, Figs. 3 and 4). We hypothesized that low level Ni2+ uptake, which could be due to a nonspecific Nramp-like transporter, is sufficient for maximal urease activity under these conditions. Therefore, a nickel-complexing agent (NTA), which had proved to efficiently inhibit nonspecific nickel uptake in bacteria (13.Eitinger T. Wolfram L. Degen O. Anthon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17139-17144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), was added to the growth medium. 50 μm NTA led to a small but significant decrease of urease activity in the absence of Nic1p. The addition of a combination of NTA and Mg2+, however, gave a strong response. Although the parental strain was almost unaffected, urease activity in the mutant was below the threshold of the assay. Since the natural habitats of S. pombe contain nutrients with strong metal-complexing capacity and since the molar ratio of Mg2+ to Ni2+ is generally very high, the latter growth conditions reflect the situation in the environment.Table IIEffect of growth conditions on urease activity of the S. pombe nic1-1 mutantStrainUrease activityaExpressed as nmol of urea hydrolyzed/mg of protein/min.

Our results identified Nic1p as an important auxiliary factor for urease activity in S. pombe, a finding that may be of general significance for the analysis of urease biosynthesis in eukaryotes. Additional urease accessory genes in fission yeast have been tentatively mapped (23.Lubbers M.W. Thornton R.J. Honey N.K. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1195-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The genome sequencing project revealed homologs of the bacterial urease operon proteins UreD and UreF, which are essential for urease metallocenter assembly (4.Mobley H.L.T. Island M.D. Hausinger R.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 451-480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An isolog with high similarity to the bacterial UreG, a GTPase that is important for nickel incorporation into urease apoprotein (24.Soriano A. Hausinger R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11140-11144Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), is not obvious from the S. pombe genome sequence. Although at present we have only indirect data on the localization of Nic1p, our results strongly suggest that it represents a plasma-membrane transporter. Protein-sorting signals are not obvious from the primary structure, and recent work on the Nramp homolog Smf1p of S. cerevisiae has demonstrated that sorting is a mechanism of post-translational activity control of plasma-membrane transporters in yeast (25.Liu X.F. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4863-4868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 26.Liu X.F. Culotta V.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Compared with its bacterial relatives, Nic1p has a unique specificity. Ni2+ transport by HoxN of Ralstonia eutropha, for instance, is not inhibited by Co2+, and HoxN does not transport Co2+ ion (14.Degen O. Kobayashi M. Shimizu S. Eitinger T. Arch. Microbiol. 1999; 171: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Ni2+ uptake by NhlF of Rhodococcus rhodochrousis specifically inhibited by Co2+, and this permease is able to transport Co2+ ion (14.Degen O. Kobayashi M. Shimizu S. Eitinger T. Arch. Microbiol. 1999; 171: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Nic1p seems to be a third type of nickel permease, since Co2+ was an inhibitor but, if at all, only a weak substrate for transport. Understanding the molecular basis of the differences in ion selectivity is a challenging problem. We are indebted to B. Friedrich and E.

In a previous paper (Fayadat, L., Niccoli, P., Lanet, J., and Franc, J. L.

Although TPO catalyzes both thyroglobulin iodination and hormone synthesis at the apical cell surface of thyroid cells, this enzyme is located mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the perinuclear membrane, and only a small proportion is present at the apical surface (reviewed in Ref. 1.Eckholm R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1981; 24: 141-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Kuliawat et al. (2.Kuliawat R. Lisanti M. Arvan P. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1998; 174: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) report that no more than 30% of the immunoprecipitated TPO was detected at the cell surface of porcine thyrocytes cultured on porous filters. In a previous study (4.Fayadat L. Niccoli-Sire P. Lanet J. Franc J.L. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4277-4285Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we proposed a model for the folding, degradation, and intracellular trafficking of human TPO (hTPO) expressed in CHO cells. hTPO was stably expressed in the CHO cell line, and its folding was studied with two monoclonal antibodies: mAb47, which recognizes a linear epitope, and mAb15, which recognizes a conformational epitope present in the mature protein. The results showed that only 15–20% of the hTPO molecules were able to acquire a suitable conformation to be recognized by mAb15 (4.Fayadat L. Niccoli-Sire P. Lanet J. Franc J.L. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4277-4285Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). On the other hand, only a fairly small proportion (∼15%) of the latter were able to reach the plasma membrane. These data indicated that after being synthesized, only 2% of the hTPO molecules were able to exit from the ER and reach the cell surface. In the steady state, the hTPO recovery rate at the cell surface ranged between 10 and 15%. This firmly suggests that the process involved in the folding and intracellular trafficking of this glycoprotein is the same in both thyroid and CHO cells and that the inefficient maturation of the wild type hTPO is an intrinsic characteristic of this molecule. The speed at which the remaining molecules were degraded varied depending on their folding state. The incorrectly folded hTPO was degraded faster than that recognized by mAb15 (half-time 2 h versus 7 h) (4.Fayadat L. Niccoli-Sire P. Lanet J. Franc J.L. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4277-4285Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). “Quality control” is a term that refers to the process whereby conformational maturation is continuously controlled in the ER (5.Kopito R. Cell. 1997; 88: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The conformational maturation of nascent polypeptides in the ER is facilitated by transient physical interactions with folding catalysts (protein disulfide isomerase, peptidyl isomerase, etc.) and molecular chaperones (BiP, GRP 94, calnexin, etc.). The ER is the site of entry of proteins into the secretory pathway. As a rule, misfolded proteins, folding intermediates, unassembled subunits, and incompletely assembled oligomers remain in the ER and are ultimately targeted by the quality control apparatus responsible for intracellular degradation. In previous studies, we reported that (i) interactions between hTPO and calnexin and calreticulin are of crucial importance to the folding of hTPO (6.Fayadat L. Siffroi-Fernandez S. Lanet J. Franc J.L. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 959-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and (ii) the insertion of the heme is essential for the hTPO to be able to exit from the ER (7.Fayadat L. Niccoli-Sire P. Lanet J. Franc J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10533-10538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It is generally agreed that any misfolded proteins that fail to fulfill the requirements for being transported out of the ER are delivered to cytoplasmic proteasomes to be degraded (8.Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 19-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar), although exactly how the decision to degrade misfolded or unassembled membrane proteins is made has not yet been completely elucidated. There are now some evidence, however, that ER proteases may also be involved in the degradation of proteins (9.Heinemann F.S. Ozols J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3445-3453Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 10.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

In the present study, we focused on the degradative processes underlying the degradation of hTPO, since the speed at which hTPO molecules are degraded varies depending on their folding state. This is the first time the degradation of a wild type protein has been found to involve two distinct pathways at the ER level, depending on its folding state: the cytosolic proteasome pathway and a pathway involving some ER membrane-bound cysteine/serine proteases.

Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) raised against hTPO were a gift from J. Ruf (U38 INSERM, Marseille, France). As described previously (4.Fayadat L. Niccoli-Sire P. Lanet J. Franc J.L. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4277-4285Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), full-length 3.60-kilobase pair hTPO cDNA (kindly provided by B. Rapoport, Cedar-Sinai Research Institute, Los Angeles, CA) was cloned into the eukaryotic transfer vector pcDNA3 and stably transfected into the CHO cell line. After being selected with Geneticin, cells were subcloned to obtain a clone expressing a high level of hTPO (referred to as hTPO-CHO cells). The cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 IU/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells were preincubated for 2 h in Met- and Cys-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS and 10 mm sodium butyrate and subsequently pulsed for 30 min in the same culture medium supplemented with 35S(Met+Cys) (10 μCi/ml). After the pulse, the radiolabeling medium was removed, the cell surface was washed twice with 1 ml of Ham's F-12 medium, and cells were then chased for periods ranging between 10 min and 48 h in culture medium supplemented with 5 mm Met and 5 mm Cys. Once the chase was over, cells were kept on ice, washed twice with 2 ml of ice-cold PBS, and scraped off into 600 μl of hTPO-extraction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.3% sodium deoxycholate, protease inhibitor mixture, and 100 mmiodoacetamide. The cells were then tumbled for 20 min at 4 °C and centrifuged for 3 min at 10,000 × g. The radiolabeled supernatant obtained was saved and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with mAb15 or mAb47, two mAbs directed against hTPO. These mAbs had been previously complexed with protein A-Sepharose by incubating them overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were then retrieved by briefly centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 s) and washed 4 times with 1 ml of hTPO extraction buffer and once with 1 ml of PBS. The precipitated proteins were separated from the antibody-protein A-Sepharose complexes by boiling for 5 min in the Laemmli buffer supplemented with 2-mercaptoethanol, and samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. hTPO-CHO cells were preincubated for 2 h in Met and Cys free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS and 10 mm sodium butyrate and subsequently radiolabeled for 2 h in the same culture medium supplemented with 35S(Met+Cys) (10 μCi/ml). The radiolabeling medium was then removed, and the cell surface was washed twice with ice-cold PBS and scraped off into 2 ml of ice-cold PBS. After being centrifuged (500 × g, 4 min), the cells were resuspended in 2 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and incubated for 20 min on ice. They were then centrifuged again (1900 × g, 5 min). ER membranes were prepared as described by Urbani and Simoni (12.Urbani L. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1919-1923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, transferred to a Dounce homogenizer, and incubated on ice for 5 min. After one stroke of a tight-fitting pestle, 1 ml of 300 mm sucrose in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was quickly added. The cells were further disrupted with 20 further strokes in the homogenizer. 2 ml of homogenate was mixed with 6.5 ml of 63.5% w/w sucrose in 1 mm Tris-EDTA buffer, pH 8.0. The homogenate was covered with 7.5-ml steps of 38, 31, and 23% sucrose w/w and 1 mmTris-EDTA, pH 8.0, buffer. Gradients were centrifuged for 3 h at 4 °C in an SW 28 rotor at 24,000 rpm, and ER fractions (interface between 55 and 38% sucrose) were collected manually. ER fractions were then washed with 3 volumes of 1 mm Tris-EDTA buffer, pelleted for 1 h at 40,000 rpm in a 60 Ti rotor, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of the same buffer. The ER fractions were quickly frozen and stored at −80 °C. ER membranes were thawed on ice and diluted 1:1 with ice-cold 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm sucrose and then incubated at 37 °C for various periods of time. When indicated, protease inhibitors were added to the medium. At the end of the incubation time, hTPO extraction buffer (C × 5) was added to the chase medium. The cells were then tumbled for 20 min at 4 °C and centrifuged for 3 min at 10,000 × g. The radiolabeled supernatant obtained was saved and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with mAb15 or mAb47, as previously explained. The precipitated proteins were separated from antibody-protein A-Sepharose complexes by boiling for 5 min in the Laemmli buffer supplemented with 2-mercaptoethanol, and samples were subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE analysis. To separate the soluble proteins present in the ER lumen from the integral and peripheral proteins of the ER membranes, ER fractions prepared as previously indicated were thawed on ice and diluted 1:1 with ice-cold 150 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and then vigorously sonicated for 3 × 10 s on ice. Cells were then centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g and separated into supernatant and pellet subfractions. Pellets were resuspended in 150 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and then incubated at 37 °C for various periods of time with or without protease inhibitors. After performing extraction and immunoprecipitation, samples were prepared as described previously. To discriminate between different populations of hTPO molecules differing in their three-dimensional structures, two mAbs were used, namely mAb15 and mAb47. These two mAbs were selected among a panel of 12 mAbs directed against hTPO (13.Ruf J. Toubert M.E. Czarnocka B Durand-Gorde J.M. Ferrand M. Carayon P. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 1211-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The mAb47 recognizes a linear epitope (14.Finke R. Seto P. Ruf J. Carayon P. Rapoport B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1991; 73: 919-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and it has been previously established that this mAb does not recognize hTPO when this molecule acquires a partially or a totally folded form (4.Fayadat L. Niccoli-Sire P. Lanet J. Franc J.L. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4277-4285Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar,15.Rasmussen A.K. Feldt-Rasmussen U. Brandt M. Hartoft-Nielsen M.L. Carayon P. Buschard K. Autoimmunity. 1999; 29: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The mAb15 recognizes a three-dimensional epitope in the hTPO, which is localized in one of the two major antigenic domains of the molecule and is unable to recognize unfolded hTPO molecules (13.Ruf J. Toubert M.E. Czarnocka B Durand-Gorde J.M. Ferrand M. Carayon P. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 1211-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Using the mAb15 + mAb47 couple in immunoprecipitation experiments, more than 90% of the hTPO expressed in CHO cells was recovered (data not shown). When these mAbs were used separately in a pulse-chase experiment using35S(Met+Cys) (Fig. 1), the amount of hTPO recognized by mAb47 reached a maximum after the pulse, and no hTPO recognized by mAb15 was immunoprecipitated at this time. During the chase period, the amount of hTPO recognized by the mAb47 decreased, whereas that recognized by the mAb15 increased. The total quantity of hTPO (hTPO immunoprecipitate by mAb15 and by mAb47) decreased during the chase. However, it is not clear from the results of this experiment whether or not any overlapping occurred between the populations of hTPO molecules recognized by mAbs 15 and 47. We then performed sequential immunoprecipitations; hTPO-CHO cells were labeled for 3 h with 35S(Met+Cys), and after the extraction step, the first immunoprecipitation was performed with either mAb15 or mAb47, followed by a second one using the other mAb (Fig.2). Regardless of the order in which the two mAbs were used, the hTPO immunoprecipitation rate was practically the same in the case of both mAbs. This demonstrates that using these two mAbs, it is possible to define two distinct populations of hTPO molecules: those having the unfolded forms recognized by mAb47 and those with the partially and/or completely folded forms recognized by mAb15. In a previous study (4.Fayadat L. Niccoli-Sire P. Lanet J. Franc J.L. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4277-4285Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that if a hTPO molecule recognized by mAb15 was not able to exit from the ER, it was certainly because this molecule had not reached the “completely folded form” and was therefore not able to satisfy the quality control requirements of the ER. The possibility cannot be ruled out, however, that the “hTPO15+ form” present at the cell surface may be similar to that present in the ER.Figure 2Sequential immunoprecipitation of35S-hTPO with mAb15 and mAb47. Cells were incubated for 3 h in Met- and Cys-free medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 mm sodium butyrate, and 10 μCi of35S(Met+Cys)/ml. At the end of the incubation period, hTPO was immunoprecipitated with either mAb47 (A) or mAb15 (B), and the supernatant was then immunoprecipitated again using mAb15 (A) or mAb47 (B). Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE analysis, and the radioactivity was detected and quantified using a phosphorimaging device. This figure gives the mean values from three different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) With a view to defining the kinetics and the extent to which unfolded (those recognized by mAb47) and partially folded hTPO molecules (those recognized by mAb15) are degraded and determining the underlying degradation mechanisms, we performed pulse-chase analyses on hTPO-CHO cells. Since the proteasome pathway has recently been found to mediate the degradation of many ER proteins, we focused on the possible involvement of the proteasome in the degradation of hTPO. Cells were treated with or without lactacystin, a highly specific irreversible inhibitor of the multicatalytic proteasome, with and without cycloheximide, the well known protein synthesis inhibitor, which is also known to inhibit protein degradation. CHO cells were preincubated for 2 h with or without lactacystin and then pulse-labeled with35S(Met+Cys), chased with or without lactacystin or cycloheximide. hTPO was then immunoprecipitated using mAb47 (Fig.3 a). It was observed that the unfolded forms recognized by mAb47 (the hTPO47+ forms) were rapidly degraded (half-life: ∼3 h) and that treating the cells with lactacystin strongly inhibited this degradation. Similar results were obtained using MG132 (data not shown), whereas cycloheximide treatment had no noticeable effects on the degradation of the hTPO47+ forms. Similar pulse-chase experiments to those described in Fig. 3 a were carried out, except that hTPO was immunoprecipitated at the end of the chase period using mAb15 (Fig. 3 b). Here it was observed that the degradation of the partially folded forms (hTPO15+ forms) was slower than that of the hTPO47+ forms (half-life: ∼20 h as compared with 3 h) and was insensitive to lactacystin, whereas cycloheximide treatment strongly inhibited the degradation of the hTPO15+ forms. The degradation of the hTPO15+ forms therefore did not involve the proteasome pathway but a pathway inhibited by cycloheximide. To determine whether the degradation of the partially folded hTPO forms requires ongoing protein synthesis or whether the hTPO15+ forms were degraded via a process that is specifically inhibited by cycloheximide, we performed additional pulse-chase experiments with another protein synthesis inhibitor, emetine, which blocks protein synthesis via a different mechanism. The results indicated that the degradation of the hTPO15+ forms was inhibited by emetine (Fig. 4), which suggests that the degradation of the hTPO15+ forms requires ongoing protein synthesis. Further studies were then carried out with a view to determining the degradation system involved in hTPO15+ form degradation and its cellular location. Eukaryotic cells contain two main systems responsible for the intracellular degradation of proteins: the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and the lysosome pathway. Since we knew that partially folded hTPO forms did not undergo proteasome-mediated degradation, we investigated the question as to whether these molecules are degraded in the lysosomes. Pulse-chase experiments were therefore performed in which lysosomotropic agents (chloroquine or NH4Cl), which increase the intravesicular pH level, were added to the chase media, thereby inactivating low pH-dependent lysosomal proteases. After the chase, hTPO was immunoprecipitated with mAb15 (Fig. 5). The finding that the lysosomotropic agents used did not inhibit the degradation rate of the hTPO15+ forms argues against a lysosomal mechanism being responsible for the degradation of these forms. On the contrary, for unknown reasons these drugs increased the rate of degradation. To determine whether a passage through the Golgi apparatus was required for the intracellular degradation of the hTPO15+ forms to be possible, we performed additional pulse-chase experiments using brefeldin A, an inhibitor of protein transport through the Golgi complex that induces a redistribution of the Golgi-apparatus proteins into the ER. The fact that degradation of the hTPO15+ forms still occurred in the presence of brefeldin A shows that the degradation occurred in a pre-Golgi location, at the ER level (data not shown). To obtain further insights into the degradation mechanisms involved in the degradation of the hTPO15+ forms and to determine the specificity of this degradation pathway, pulse-chase experiments were carried out in which various protease inhibitors were added to the chase medium at concentrations not affecting the cell viability. The following protease inhibitors were used for this purpose: leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin A, phosphoramidon, ALLN, TPCK, EDTA, E64d, and 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin and were added after the pulse with 35S(Met+Cys) to the chase medium for 2 h or 48 h. hTPO was then immunoprecipitated using mAb15 (Fig. 6). Among the protease inhibitors tested, (i) leupeptin, aprotinin, and ALLN were found to substantially reduce the degradation rate of hTPO immunoprecipitated by mAb15, (ii) pepstatin A weakly reduced this degradation rate, (iii) for unknown reasons the metalloprotease inhibitors (phosphoramidon, EDTA) and the chymotrypsin inhibitor (TPCK) accelerate this degradation at 48 h (Fig. 6), (iv) other inhibitors of cysteine proteases (E64d) and serine proteases (4-dichloroisocoumarin) had no effect on the degradation rate (data not shown). To examine this point more closely, we performed additional pulse-chase experiments using the three protease inhibitors, which significantly reduced the degradation of the hTPO15+ forms: leupeptin (a serine/cysteine protease inhibitor), aprotinin (a serine protease inhibitor), and ALLN (which inhibits cysteine proteases and calpain and which is also known to inhibit proteasomal degradation) (Fig. 7). The results confirmed our previous finding that the degradation of the hTPO15+ forms was noticeably inhibited by leupeptin, aprotinin, and ALLN, which suggests that the hTPO15+ forms were degraded by cysteine and serine proteases at the ER level (cytosol, ER membrane, or ER lumen level). Note that the effects of leupeptin, aprotinin, and ALLN were not additive, since they did not lead to any additional enhancement of the stability of the hTPO15+ forms (data not shown).Figure 7Effects of leupeptin, aprotinin, and ALLN on the degradation of partially folded hTPO molecules. hTPO cells were pulse-labeled for 30 min with 35S(Met+Cys) and then chased for various times without (○) or with leupeptin (a, ●), aprotinin (a, ▴), or ALLN (b, ●). Control experiments were performed in which the same quantity of corresponding solvent was added to the media (PBS for a, Me2SO for b). The cells were then scraped off and extracted with the hTPO extraction buffer containing 100 mm iodoacetamide. Immunoprecipitation was performed with mAb15. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE. The radioactivity was detected and quantified with a phosphorimaging device. This figure gives the results of an experiment that is representative of three identical experiments performed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further define the location of the pathway responsible for the degradation of the partially folded hTPO forms, we performed cell fractionation and purified the ER membrane. After incubating these isolated ER membranesin vitro (Fig. 8 a), we observed that the degradation of the hTPO15+ forms persisted, which indicates that the proteases involved were located at the ER membrane level and not in the cytosol. Furthermore, this degradation process was always inhibited by ALLN (Fig. 8 b) and to a weaker extent by leupeptin and aprotinin (Fig. 8 b) but not by lactacystin (data not shown). These data rule out the possibility that proteasomes bound to the ER (18.Yu H. Kaung G. Kobayashi S. Kopito R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20800-20804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) may have been responsible for the degradation of the hTPO15+ forms in vitro. It is worth noting, however, that the inhibitory effects of leupeptin and aprotinin were less noticeable in vitro than in CHO cells (Figs. 8 aand 7 a). To determine whether the “lumen-free” membrane fragments still contained the proteases necessary for the degradation of the partially folded hTPO15+ forms, ER membranes were sonicated, and the resulting disrupted ER membranes were isolated by ultracentrifugation. With these membranes, the in vitro degradation of the hTPO15+ forms still occurred, and its rate was even greatly enhanced in comparison with that recorded in the case of the control ER membranes (Fig. 8,c and d). The degradation of the hTPO15+ forms therefore does not require the presence of soluble lumenal proteases. Membrane fragments conserve the proteases necessary for the degradation of the partially folded hTPO forms. The results of our experiments therefore indicate that some ER membrane-bound cysteine/serine proteases are involved in the degradation of the hTPO15+ forms bothin vivo and in vitro. It is worth mentioning that a great increase in the hTPO15+ forms was observed in the presence of ALLN during the incubation periods (Fig. 8 b), which may possibly be due to the hTPO47+ forms being transformed into hTPO15+ forms. In a previous study (4.Fayadat L. Niccoli-Sire P. Lanet J. Franc J.L. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4277-4285Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we described the occurrence of two crucial steps in the folding of the hTPO molecules expressed in CHO cells. Only 15–20% of the hTPO molecules were able to acquire a suitable three-dimensional structure to be recognized by mAb15, and only 2% were able to reach the cell surface. In the current study, we observed that the rate at which the remaining molecules were degraded varied depending on their folding state (Fig. 3). The disappearance of the hTPO molecules recognized by mAbs may have been due to the formation of complex or insoluble forms of the molecule, as previously found to occur in the case of the CFTR and T cell receptor α molecules (17.Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar, 18.Yu H. Kaung G. Kobayashi S. Kopito R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20800-20804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Using the techniques described in the latter two studies, we were unable to detect the presence of insoluble hTPO molecules (data not shown). But we did observe that the degradation of the unfolded forms was significantly inhibited by lactacystin or MG132, which indicates that these molecules underwent proteasome-mediated degradation (Fig. 3). However, under these conditions, we were unable to detect either ubiquitinated or deglycosylated hTPO in the soluble or the non-soluble fractions (data not shown). In another study (6.Fayadat L. Siffroi-Fernandez S. Lanet J. Franc J.L. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 959-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we reported that when the association of hTPO with calnexin or calreticulin was impaired, hTPO was dramatically degraded, and that this degradation involved the proteasome pathway. The latter data are consistent with the present data, since they indicate that treating the cells with castanospermine led to a dramatic decrease in the proportion of the hTPO molecules that was able to reach the partially folded state and be recognized by mAb15. In the present study, the degradation of the partially folded forms of hTPO was not inhibited by lactacystin (Fig. 3). Since the hTPO15+ forms were not degraded by the proteasome, we investigated the nature of the proteases involved in their degradation. Among the panel of protease inhibitors tested, leupeptin, aprotinin, and ALLN significantly reduced the degradation rates of these forms. The degradation of the hTPO15+ forms therefore involved cysteine/serine proteases. On the other hand, this degradation process was not affected by treating the cells with lysosomotropic agents or brefeldin A, which indicates that the degradation occurs in a pre-Golgi compartment. Note that in vivo, the inhibitory effects of aprotinin and leupeptin may have been underestimated, since aprotinin is a 58-residue peptide, and the cells might not be completely permeable to this component, whereas leupeptin is a tripeptide that is likely to be membrane-permeant. The results of further in vitro studies carried out with purified ER membranes indicated that the hTPO15+ molecules were still degraded and that the degradation was sensitive to leupeptin, aprotinin, and ALLN. These data suggest that the process of in vitro degradation of hTPO15+ forms resembles the in vivo process, whereas, in the case of HMG-CoA reductase, the in vivo and in vitrodegradation processes are different (19.Moriyama T. Sather S.K. McGee T.P. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22037-22043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In vivo, this protein is degraded by the proteasome, whereas the in vitrodegradation is not inhibited by lactacystin but is inhibited by cysteine protease inhibitors. Further experiments performed with lumen-free ER membrane fragments showed that a soluble lumenal content was not required for the degradation of the partially folded hTPO forms to occur. These results therefore showed that these forms were degraded by some ER membrane-bound cysteine/serine proteases. In vivo, the finding that the degradation of the partially folded forms is inhibited by cycloheximide and emetine, two protein synthesis inhibitors, suggests that ongoing protein synthesis is required for this degradation process to occur. As was to be expected, cycloheximide had no noticeable effects on isolated ER membranes, in which the mechanism of protein synthesis is impaired (data not shown). Our hypothesis is that in vivo cycloheximide might either inhibit the synthesis of the protease(s) involved in the degradation of these forms or inhibit that of a component, contributing to the activation of this protease(s). A number of proteins known to undergo ER-associated degradation have been found to be degraded via the proteasome pathway (8.Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 19-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar), although there exists new evidence in favor of the idea that a cytosolic giant protease (TPP II) might take over some of the functions of the proteasome (20.Glas R. Bogyo M. McMaster J.S. Gaczynska M. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1998; 392: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 21.Geier E. Pfeifer G. Wilm M. Lucchiari Hartz M. Bausmeister W. Eichmann K. Niedermann G. Science. 1999; 283: 978-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). On the other hand it has been suggested that (i) asialoglycoprotein receptor subunit is degraded by two different pathways in a pre-Golgi compartment (22.Wikstöm L. Lodish H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), (ii) the degradation pathway of mutants of α1 antitrysin (Z and S) is at least partly different from that of asialoglycoprotein subunits (23.Teckman J.K. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13215-13220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), (iii) cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (24.Jensen T.J.

J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) might be degraded via the proteosomal and via a nonproteosomal pathway. However, relatively little is known so far about the ER proteases possibly involved in protein degradation in the ER. ER proteases are involved in the degradation of resident ER proteins, stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase (9.Heinemann F.S. Ozols J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3445-3453Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and in that of P-glycoprotein (10.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32373-32376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), whereas proteasome and a cysteine protease are selectively involved in the differential processing of antigen presentation by major histocompatibility complex class I (11.Lopez D. Del Val M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5769-5772PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the inhibition of the degradation of the hTPO15+ forms by leupeptin, aprotinin, and ALLN suggests that multiple proteases may be involved in the degradation process or that a single protease with multiple enzymatic activities may take part in the process. One of the main aims of our ongoing studies is to identify and eventually clone the relevant ER proteases. The term “ER degradation” refers here to a degradation process that takes place in the ER or in the close vicinity. In this study, it was definitely established that depending on its folding state, hTPO is degraded either by the cytosolic proteasome pathway or by a novel degradative system involving some still unknown membrane-bound cysteine/serine proteases present in the ER itself. This second degradation system might be used by the cell to regulate the continuous turnover of proteins and to eliminate resident ER proteins. All in all, our data provide valuable insights into the quality control mechanisms whereby the cells get rid of misfolded or unfolded proteins, and to our knowledge, this is the first time a wild type protein has been described that is degraded via two distinct degradation pathways (the proteaseome and ER cysteine/serine proteases), depending on the folding state of the protein.

We have previously demonstrated potential pro-inflammatory effects of soluble E-selectin upon neutrophil effector functions, using a soluble recombinant molecule (E-zz), which increased β2-integrin-mediated adhesion, decreased β2-integrin-dependent migration, and triggered reactive oxygen species generation and release. In this study, we have examined the intracellular signals following neutrophil activation by soluble E-selectin. We show that exposure of neutrophils to E-selectin and platelet-activating factor (PAF) in combination induced a synergistic effect upon β2-integrin-mediated adhesion. Although soluble E-selectin did not induce Ca2+ mobilization in neutrophils by itself, elevation of intracellular Ca2+ was specifically prolonged in response to PAF but not leukotriene B4 orN-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe. The prolonged Ca2+mobilization observed in the presence of E-selectin was dependent on Ca2+ influx from intracellular stores rather than influx of extracellular Ca2+ through SKF 96365-sensitive channels.

Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6373) Google Scholar). The control of events involved in leukocyte recruitment is critical for the development of effective anti-microbial defenses and also for efficient wound healing. Failure to recruit granulocytes is life threatening, resulting in inadequate clearance of opportunistic pathogens. However, excessive inflammatory cell recruitment or inappropriate cell activation leads to the development of chronic inflammatory conditions that may favor fibrotic repair mechanisms and, ultimately, loss of organ function (2.Henson P.M. Johnston R.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 669-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar).It is now well established that a multistep molecular process allows leukocyte recruitment to different tissue sites. In acute inflammatory responses, neutrophil granulocyte recruitment involves L-selectin and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 that engage endothelial counter-receptors including endothelial P-and E-selectin (3.Mulligan M.S. Varani J. Dame M.K. Lane C.L. Smith C.W. Anderson D. Ward P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1396-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Conversion of “rolling” adhesion to “firm” adhesion necessary for subsequent transmigration requires an additional co-stimulus, for example via intracellular signals from occupancy of G protein-coupled seven-transmembrane receptors for bacterial peptides, inflammatory mediators, and chemokines (4.Lo S. Detmers P.A. Levin S. Wright S. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1779-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 5.Weber C. Kitayama J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10939-10944Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Trans-endothelial migration is clearly a complex process but is thought to involve dynamic modulation of integrin-mediated adhesion events to allow formation of new sites of contact at the leading edge of the cell and selective detachment at the trailing end (6.Altieri D. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1891-1998PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Dransfield I. Cabañas C. Craig A. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 8.Stewart M. Cabañas C. Hogg N. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1810-1817PubMed Google Scholar). The existence of multiple levels of control for adhesion processes ensures that “inappropriate” recruitment of leukocytes does not occur. However, a breakdown in the normal adhesion regulatory mechanisms may contribute to pathogenesis of a number of diseases in which the granulocyte has been implicated (9.Malech H.D. Gallin J.I. N, Engl. J. Med. 1988; 317: 687-694Crossref Scopus (681) Google Scholar).Cellular recruitment is critically dependent on formation of molecular interactions between receptor/counter-receptor pairs. However, it is now clear that many adhesion receptors are also coupled to the intracellular signal transduction machinery, providing “outside-in” signals that modulate leukocyte responses. Initiation of signal transduction pathways following integrin occupancy is relatively well established (10.Williams M.A. Solomkin J.S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 725-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For example, release of degradative enzymes and toxic oxidant species required for antimicrobial defense is augmented following adhesion to matrix components. However, the role of other adhesion receptors in triggering signaling events has only recently begun to be defined. Engagement of CD31 has been demonstrated to augment the rate of integrin-dependent migration, providing a mechanism for ensuring efficient diapedesis (11.Varon D. Jackson D.E. Shenkman B. Dardik R. Tamarin I. Savion N. Newman P.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 500-507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent evidence also suggests that engagement of receptors involved in rolling adhesion may also transduce specific signals that alter neutrophil behavior. In particular, ligation of neutrophil L-selectin and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 augment β2-integrin-mediated adhesion and increase production of damaging reactive oxygen intermediates (12.Simon S.I. Burns A.R. Taylor A.D. Gopalan P.K. Lynam E.B. Sklar L.A. Smith C.W. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1502-1514PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Blanks J.E. Moll T. Eytner R. Vestweber D Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 433-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Selectin-dependent alterations in neutrophil function have been suggested to require co-stimulation with other agents, e.g. platelet-activating factor (PAF)1 (14.Lorant D.E. Patel K.D. McIntyre T.M. McEver R.P. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 223-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 15.Otrovsky L. King A.J. Bond S. Mitchell D. Lorant D.E. Zimmerman G.A. Larsen R. Niu X.F. Kubes P. Blood. 1998; 91: 3028-3036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The functional alterations induced by agents that activate neutrophils appear distinct from those caused by “priming” agents, which have little effect on generation of reactive oxygen species by themselves. Together these findings indicate that the repertoire of receptors engaged on the neutrophil surface determines the functional responses in terms of adhesion, migration, and secretion. One implication is that although it may be possible to define experimental conditions in vitro under which neutrophils are “unprimed,” “primed,” or “activated,” the functional status of neutrophils during recruitment in vivo may approximate to a continuum of activation states.Our previous studies have demonstrated that neutrophils treated with soluble recombinant E-selectin (E-zz) comprising the N-terminal C-type lectin domain, epidermal growth factor domain and two of the short consensus repeats with two protein A domains in tandem cause increased β2-integrin-mediated adhesion with a concomitant decrease in β2-integrin-dependent migration. In addition, generation and release of reactive oxygen species is increased following exposure to E-selectin (16.Ruchaud-Sparagano M-H. Drost E.M. Donnelly S.C. Bird M.I. Haslett C. Dransfield I. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 80-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These effects could be blocked by F(ab′)2 anti-E-selectin monoclonal antibody binding to the lectin domain of E-selectin. The kinetics of the neutrophil response to E-zz raised the possibility that the effects might be indirect because of secondary release of inflammatory mediators from neutrophils, for example PAF. In this paper we examine the generation of intracellular signals following exposure of neutrophils to E-selectin. We have found that E-selectin specifically prolongs [Ca2+]i increase in neutrophils treated with PAF but not N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) or leukotriene B4 (LTB4). In addition, we have addressed whether soluble E-selectin effects were due to a second release of PAF and found that soluble E-selectin was not acting directly through PAF receptors. However, our data suggest that specific changes in [Ca2+]i are not required for E-selectin-dependent augmentation of functional responses in neutrophils.DISCUSSIONAppropriate recruitment of neutrophils to sites of infection or tissue injury is critical for the initiation and progression of the inflammatory response. A number of studies have shown the importance of selectins in the orchestration of adhesion and migration of neutrophils in the initial capture and subsequent rolling on vascular endothelial ligands (22.Lawrence M.B. Springer T.A. Cell. 1991; 65: 859-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1872) Google Scholar, 23.Phillips M.L. Schwartz B.R. Etzioni A. Bayer R. Ochs H.D. Paulson J.C. Harlan J.M. J. Clin.

Cell. 1996; 84: 563-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Selectins also have a more complex regulatory role in inflammatory processes, initiating intracellular signal transduction cascades that lead to neutrophil activation and altered functional responses (12.Simon S.I.

J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1061-1067PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that soluble E-selectin (E-zz) specifically potentiates neutrophil adhesion and augments reactive oxygen species production and release (16.Ruchaud-Sparagano M-H. Drost E.M. Donnelly S.C. Bird M.I. Haslett C. Dransfield I. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 80-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In this paper we further examine the nature of the signaling pathway that may underlie these regulatory effects.The data presented here demonstrate several important findings relating to altered functional status following E-zz treatment, which are consistent with the concept of a juxtacrine activation process demonstrated for neutrophil-platelet interactions involving PAF and P-selectin (15.Otrovsky L. King A.J. Bond S. Mitchell D. Lorant D.E. Zimmerman G.A. Larsen R. Niu X.F. Kubes P. Blood. 1998; 91: 3028-3036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). First, in support of our suggestion that elevated levels of soluble E-selectin may cause alterations in neutrophil behavior that are pro-inflammatory, E-zz is able to markedly alter neutrophil production of reactive oxygen species. Unlike classical priming agents (PAF or TNF-α), E-zz is able to trigger O⨪2release when used alone. However, in combination with stimuli that do not normally trigger O⨪2 release from unprimed carefully prepared neutrophils (for example the bacterial peptide fMLP), E-zz potentiates O⨪2 production (Fig. 6). Second, we have observed that E-zz acts synergistically with PAF but not fMLP or LTB4 to augment β2-integrin activity, providing a mechanism for alteration of the adhesion repertoire of neutrophils exposed to specific inflammatory mediators at sites of extravasation. Third, analysis of the effects of E-zz upon Ca2+ mobilization within neutrophils revealed that E-zz specifically prolongs elevation of [Ca2+]i in response to PAF but not fMLP or LTB4. It has been suggested that [Ca2+]i elevation was a necessary step in the signaling between the fMLP receptor and NADPH oxidase (20.Foyousi-Youssefi R. Petersson F. Lew D.P. Krause K.H. Nusse O. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 709-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Our data show that Ca2+ mobilization is not required for fMLP-induced β2-integrin activation. Moreover, we have shown that the effect of E-zz upon PAF-induced β2-integrin adhesion is dependent on a threshold increase in [Ca2+]i and is blocked when neutrophils are treated with an intracellular Ca2+ antagonist (Fig.1 B). The observed dissociation between the effects of E-zz on β2-integrin activation, augmentation of O⨪2release, and Ca2+ mobilization in response to PAF indicates that altered Ca2+ mobilization following PAF receptor ligation is not important for the synergistic action of PAF and E-zz upon O⨪2 release.We have examined a number of parameters of neutrophil activation that might be affected by changes in PAF-induced Ca2+mobilization, including the extent and duration of neutrophil polarization and whether transient β2-integrin mediated adhesion responses are prolonged following E-zz treatment. Although we have observed synergism between E-zz and PAF in terms of β2-integrin-mediated adhesion, the precise relationship between these events is difficult to determine. Because E-zz induces a low level of β2-integrin activation by itself yet fails to induce Ca2+ mobilization, a distinct functional correlate of prolonged Ca2+ elevation following E-zz and PAF treatment remains to be defined. One possibility is that [Ca2+]i elevation may have important consequences for arachidonic acid metabolism. Treatment of macrophages with PAF required a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i to induce arachidonic acid release (32.Qiu Z.-H. Gijon M.A. de Carvalho M.S. Spencer D.M. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8203-8211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanisms of E-zz action upon PAF-induced Ca2+ mobilization remain to be determined, it would be interesting to investigate whether neutrophil arachidonic acid metabolism is affected by E-zz/PAF.We are currently investigating the effects of E-zz upon neutrophil migration in response to PAF, where prolonged elevation of [Ca2+]i may interfere with the dynamic activation/deactivation cycles of integrin ligand binding that are necessary for an efficient migration.PAF induces an initial rapid increase in [Ca2+]ibecause of IP3-dependent release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (33.Naccache P.H. Molski M.N. Volpi M. Becker E.L. Sha'afi R.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), which is blocked by TMB-8 and is essential for E-zz effect upon PAF-induced Ca2+ mobilization. The second phase of PAF response is due to Ca2+ influx from extracellular sources through receptor-operated channels. The effects of E-zz upon PAF-induced Ca2+ mobilization was not blocked by SKF 96365, indicating that the sustained [Ca2+]i elevation following incubation with E-zz was not due to extracellular Ca2+ entry through SKF 96365-sensitive receptor-operated channels. Alternatively, because the E-zz effect requires a threshold increase in [Ca2+]i following Ca2+release from IP3-dependent intracellular stores, the sustained changes in [Ca2+]i observed in the presence of E-zz could be due to extracellular Ca2+entering the cells via store-operated channels (34.von Tscharner V. Prod'hom B. Baggiolini M. Reuter H. Nature. 1986; 324: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), which are primed by E-zz and activated by intracellular Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum. One hypothesis for the mechanism of activation of store-operated channels is the release of an intracellular messenger from the endoplasmic reticulum (for example arachidonic acid generated by the activation of phospholipase A2), which would bind to the store-operated channels and increase the probability of opening of the channels (35.Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 36.Wolf M.J. Wang J. Turk J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1522-1526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Another possibility would be an effect of E-zz upon intracellular Ca2+ stores, which may be insensitive to IP3.Inhibition of E-zz effects upon neutrophil O⨪2 release by genistein suggests that tyrosine phosphorylation represents a critical step in E-selectin-mediated signaling, possibly controlling downstream functional events, such as the oxidative burst. Although L-selectin-induced Ca2+ mobilization has been reported to be tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent (28.Waddell T.K. Fialkow L. Chan C.K. Kishimoto T.K. Downey G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15403-15411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), we show for the first time that tyrosine phosphorylation is required for E-selectin induced signaling. Whether the sustained [Ca2+]ielevation following E-zz preincubation requires tyrosine phosphorylation has been difficult to assess, partly because PAF-induced Ca2+ mobilization itself is suppressed by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (data not shown). One possibility is that suppression of PAF-induced [Ca2+]i elevation was not sufficient to trigger E-zz-induced prolongation of [Ca2+]i elevation (Fig. 2 B). Cross-linking of neutrophil L-selectin induced a rapid and transient [Ca2+]i increase and O⨪2 generation, which were both inhibited by genistein (37.Crockett-Torabi E. Fantone J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H1302-H1308PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that activation of NADPH and Ca2+ mobilization may be downstream of the early signal cascade and require protein tyrosine kinase activation.In conclusion, we present data that soluble E-selectin can specifically alter PAF induced Ca2+ mobilization in neutrophils but has little effect on Ca2+ mobilization in response to other agonists. Exposure of neutrophils to soluble E-selectin also alters the capacity for production of damaging reactive oxygen species in a manner that is distinct from classical priming agents. In addition, neutrophil β2-integrin-mediated adhesion is also altered following exposure to E-selectin, with some degree of synergy observed when E-selectin-treated neutrophils are stimulated with other agonists,e.g. PAF. It is possible that engagement of E-selectin receptors on neutrophils may act physiologically to fine tune processes involved in adhesion and emigration. In view of recent findings that ligation of other neutrophil receptors such as CD31 (11.Varon D. Jackson D.E. Shenkman B. Dardik R. Tamarin I. Savion N. Newman P.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 500-507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), L-selectin (27.Steeber A.D. Engel P. Miller A.S. Sheetz M.P. Tedder T.F. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 952-963PubMed Google Scholar), or ICAM-3 (31.Feldhaus M.J. Kessel J.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6280-6287PubMed Google Scholar) influences either β2-integrin-mediated adhesion and/or production and release of reactive oxygen species, it seems likely that the repertoire of adhesion receptors engaged provides regulatory signals that determine neutrophil functional status. Recruitment of inflammatory cells in response to injury or infection involves coordinated regulation of specific receptor/counter-receptor pairs from the integrin, immunoglobulin, selectin, and mucin families (1.Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6373) Google Scholar). The control of events involved in leukocyte recruitment is critical for the development of effective anti-microbial defenses and also for efficient wound healing. Failure to recruit granulocytes is life threatening, resulting in inadequate clearance of opportunistic pathogens. However, excessive inflammatory cell recruitment or inappropriate cell activation leads to the development of chronic inflammatory conditions that may favor fibrotic repair mechanisms and, ultimately, loss of organ function (2.Henson P.M. Johnston R.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 669-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). It is now well established that a multistep molecular process allows leukocyte recruitment to different tissue sites. In acute inflammatory responses, neutrophil granulocyte recruitment involves L-selectin and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 that engage endothelial counter-receptors including endothelial P-and E-selectin (3.Mulligan M.S. Varani J. Dame M.K. Lane C.L. Smith C.W. Anderson D. Ward P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1396-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Conversion of “rolling” adhesion to “firm” adhesion necessary for subsequent transmigration requires an additional co-stimulus, for example via intracellular signals from occupancy of G protein-coupled seven-transmembrane receptors for bacterial peptides, inflammatory mediators, and chemokines (4.Lo S. Detmers P.A. Levin S. Wright S. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1779-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 5.Weber C. Kitayama J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10939-10944Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Trans-endothelial migration is clearly a complex process but is thought to involve dynamic modulation of integrin-mediated adhesion events to allow formation of new sites of contact at the leading edge of the cell and selective detachment at the trailing end (6.Altieri D. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1891-1998PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Dransfield I. Cabañas C. Craig A. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 8.Stewart M. Cabañas C. Hogg N. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1810-1817PubMed Google Scholar). The existence of multiple levels of control for adhesion processes ensures that “inappropriate” recruitment of leukocytes does not occur. However, a breakdown in the normal adhesion regulatory mechanisms may contribute to pathogenesis of a number of diseases in which the granulocyte has been implicated (9.Malech H.D. Gallin J.I. N, Engl. J. Med. 1988; 317: 687-694Crossref Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Cellular recruitment is critically dependent on formation of molecular interactions between receptor/counter-receptor pairs. However, it is now clear that many adhesion receptors are also coupled to the intracellular signal transduction machinery, providing “outside-in” signals that modulate leukocyte responses. Initiation of signal transduction pathways following integrin occupancy is relatively well established (10.Williams M.A. Solomkin J.S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 725-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For example, release of degradative enzymes and toxic oxidant species required for antimicrobial defense is augmented following adhesion to matrix components. However, the role of other adhesion receptors in triggering signaling events has only recently begun to be defined. Engagement of CD31 has been demonstrated to augment the rate of integrin-dependent migration, providing a mechanism for ensuring efficient diapedesis (11.Varon D. Jackson D.E. Shenkman B. Dardik R. Tamarin I. Savion N. Newman P.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 500-507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent evidence also suggests that engagement of receptors involved in rolling adhesion may also transduce specific signals that alter neutrophil behavior. In particular, ligation of neutrophil L-selectin and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 augment β2-integrin-mediated adhesion and increase production of damaging reactive oxygen intermediates (12.Simon S.I. Burns A.R. Taylor A.D. Gopalan P.K. Lynam E.B. Sklar L.A. Smith C.W. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1502-1514PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Blanks J.E. Moll T. Eytner R. Vestweber D Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 433-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Selectin-dependent alterations in neutrophil function have been suggested to require co-stimulation with other agents, e.g. platelet-activating factor (PAF)1 (14.Lorant D.E. Patel K.D. McIntyre T.M. McEver R.P. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 223-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 15.Otrovsky L. King A.J. Bond S. Mitchell D. Lorant D.E. Zimmerman G.A. Larsen R. Niu X.F. Kubes P. Blood. 1998; 91: 3028-3036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The functional alterations induced by agents that activate neutrophils appear distinct from those caused by “priming” agents, which have little effect on generation of reactive oxygen species by themselves. Together these findings indicate that the repertoire of receptors engaged on the neutrophil surface determines the functional responses in terms of adhesion, migration, and secretion. One implication is that although it may be possible to define experimental conditions in vitro under which neutrophils are “unprimed,” “primed,” or “activated,” the functional status of neutrophils during recruitment in vivo may approximate to a continuum of activation states. Our previous studies have demonstrated that neutrophils treated with soluble recombinant E-selectin (E-zz) comprising the N-terminal C-type lectin domain, epidermal growth factor domain and two of the short consensus repeats with two protein A domains in tandem cause increased β2-integrin-mediated adhesion with a concomitant decrease in β2-integrin-dependent migration. In addition, generation and release of reactive oxygen species is increased following exposure to E-selectin (16.Ruchaud-Sparagano M-H. Drost E.M. Donnelly S.C. Bird M.I. Haslett C. Dransfield I. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 80-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These effects could be blocked by F(ab′)2 anti-E-selectin monoclonal antibody binding to the lectin domain of E-selectin. The kinetics of the neutrophil response to E-zz raised the possibility that the effects might be indirect because of secondary release of inflammatory mediators from neutrophils, for example PAF. In this paper we examine the generation of intracellular signals following exposure of neutrophils to E-selectin. We have found that E-selectin specifically prolongs [Ca2+]i increase in neutrophils treated with PAF but not N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) or leukotriene B4 (LTB4). In addition, we have addressed whether soluble E-selectin effects were due to a second release of PAF and found that soluble E-selectin was not acting directly through PAF receptors. However, our data suggest that specific changes in [Ca2+]i are not required for E-selectin-dependent augmentation of functional responses in neutrophils. DISCUSSIONAppropriate recruitment of neutrophils to sites of infection or tissue injury is critical for the initiation and progression of the inflammatory response. A number of studies have shown the importance of selectins in the orchestration of adhesion and migration of neutrophils in the initial capture and subsequent rolling on vascular endothelial ligands (22.Lawrence M.B. Springer T.A. Cell. 1991; 65: 859-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1872) Google Scholar, 23.Phillips M.L. Schwartz B.R. Etzioni A. Bayer R. Ochs H.D. Paulson J.C. Harlan J.M. J. Clin.

Cell. 1996; 84: 563-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Selectins also have a more complex regulatory role in inflammatory processes, initiating intracellular signal transduction cascades that lead to neutrophil activation and altered functional responses (12.Simon S.I.

J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1061-1067PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that soluble E-selectin (E-zz) specifically potentiates neutrophil adhesion and augments reactive oxygen species production and release (16.Ruchaud-Sparagano M-H. Drost E.M. Donnelly S.C. Bird M.I. Haslett C. Dransfield I. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 80-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In this paper we further examine the nature of the signaling pathway that may underlie these regulatory effects.The data presented here demonstrate several important findings relating to altered functional status following E-zz treatment, which are consistent with the concept of a juxtacrine activation process demonstrated for neutrophil-platelet interactions involving PAF and P-selectin (15.Otrovsky L. King A.J. Bond S. Mitchell D. Lorant D.E. Zimmerman G.A. Larsen R. Niu X.F. Kubes P. Blood. 1998; 91: 3028-3036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). First, in support of our suggestion that elevated levels of soluble E-selectin may cause alterations in neutrophil behavior that are pro-inflammatory, E-zz is able to markedly alter neutrophil production of reactive oxygen species. Unlike classical priming agents (PAF or TNF-α), E-zz is able to trigger O⨪2release when used alone. However, in combination with stimuli that do not normally trigger O⨪2 release from unprimed carefully prepared neutrophils (for example the bacterial peptide fMLP), E-zz potentiates O⨪2 production (Fig. 6). Second, we have observed that E-zz acts synergistically with PAF but not fMLP or LTB4 to augment β2-integrin activity, providing a mechanism for alteration of the adhesion repertoire of neutrophils exposed to specific inflammatory mediators at sites of extravasation. Third, analysis of the effects of E-zz upon Ca2+ mobilization within neutrophils revealed that E-zz specifically prolongs elevation of [Ca2+]i in response to PAF but not fMLP or LTB4. It has been suggested that [Ca2+]i elevation was a necessary step in the signaling between the fMLP receptor and NADPH oxidase (20.Foyousi-Youssefi R. Petersson F. Lew D.P. Krause K.H. Nusse O. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 709-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Our data show that Ca2+ mobilization is not required for fMLP-induced β2-integrin activation. Moreover, we have shown that the effect of E-zz upon PAF-induced β2-integrin adhesion is dependent on a threshold increase in [Ca2+]i and is blocked when neutrophils are treated with an intracellular Ca2+ antagonist (Fig.1 B). The observed dissociation between the effects of E-zz on β2-integrin activation, augmentation of O⨪2release, and Ca2+ mobilization in response to PAF indicates that altered Ca2+ mobilization following PAF receptor ligation is not important for the synergistic action of PAF and E-zz upon O⨪2 release.We have examined a number of parameters of neutrophil activation that might be affected by changes in PAF-induced Ca2+mobilization, including the extent and duration of neutrophil polarization and whether transient β2-integrin mediated adhesion responses are prolonged following E-zz treatment. Although we have observed synergism between E-zz and PAF in terms of β2-integrin-mediated adhesion, the precise relationship between these events is difficult to determine. Because E-zz induces a low level of β2-integrin activation by itself yet fails to induce Ca2+ mobilization, a distinct functional correlate of prolonged Ca2+ elevation following E-zz and PAF treatment remains to be defined. One possibility is that [Ca2+]i elevation may have important consequences for arachidonic acid metabolism. Treatment of macrophages with PAF required a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i to induce arachidonic acid release (32.Qiu Z.-H. Gijon M.A. de Carvalho M.S. Spencer D.M. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8203-8211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar).

We have examined a number of parameters of neutrophil activation that might be affected by changes in PAF-induced Ca2+mobilization, including the extent and duration of neutrophil polarization and whether transient β2-integrin mediated adhesion responses are prolonged following E-zz treatment. Although we have observed synergism between E-zz and PAF in terms of β2-integrin-mediated adhesion, the precise relationship between these events is difficult to determine. Because E-zz induces a low level of β2-integrin activation by itself yet fails to induce Ca2+ mobilization, a distinct functional correlate of prolonged Ca2+ elevation following E-zz and PAF treatment remains to be defined. One possibility is that [Ca2+]i elevation may have important consequences for arachidonic acid metabolism. Treatment of macrophages with PAF required a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i to induce arachidonic acid release (32.Qiu Z.-H. Gijon M.A. de Carvalho M.S. Spencer D.M. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8203-8211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanisms of E-zz action upon PAF-induced Ca2+ mobilization remain to be determined, it would be interesting to investigate whether neutrophil arachidonic acid metabolism is affected by E-zz/PAF. We are currently investigating the effects of E-zz upon neutrophil migration in response to PAF, where prolonged elevation of [Ca2+]i may interfere with the dynamic activation/deactivation cycles of integrin ligand binding that are necessary for an efficient migration. PAF induces an initial rapid increase in [Ca2+]ibecause of IP3-dependent release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (33.Naccache P.H. Molski M.N. Volpi M. Becker E.L. Sha'afi R.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), which is blocked by TMB-8 and is essential for E-zz effect upon PAF-induced Ca2+ mobilization. The second phase of PAF response is due to Ca2+ influx from extracellular sources through receptor-operated channels. The effects of E-zz upon PAF-induced Ca2+ mobilization was not blocked by SKF 96365, indicating that the sustained [Ca2+]i elevation following incubation with E-zz was not due to extracellular Ca2+ entry through SKF 96365-sensitive receptor-operated channels. Alternatively, because the E-zz effect requires a threshold increase in [Ca2+]i following Ca2+release from IP3-dependent intracellular stores, the sustained changes in [Ca2+]i observed in the presence of E-zz could be due to extracellular Ca2+entering the cells via store-operated channels (34.von Tscharner V. Prod'hom B. Baggiolini M. Reuter H. Nature. 1986; 324: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), which are primed by E-zz and activated by intracellular Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum. One hypothesis for the mechanism of activation of store-operated channels is the release of an intracellular messenger from the endoplasmic reticulum (for example arachidonic acid generated by the activation of phospholipase A2), which would bind to the store-operated channels and increase the probability of opening of the channels (35.Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 36.Wolf M.J. Wang J. Turk J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1522-1526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Another possibility would be an effect of E-zz upon intracellular Ca2+ stores, which may be insensitive to IP3. Inhibition of E-zz effects upon neutrophil O⨪2 release by genistein suggests that tyrosine phosphorylation represents a critical step in E-selectin-mediated signaling, possibly controlling downstream functional events, such as the oxidative burst. Although L-selectin-induced Ca2+ mobilization has been reported to be tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent (28.Waddell T.K. Fialkow L. Chan C.K. Kishimoto T.K. Downey G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15403-15411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), we show for the first time that tyrosine phosphorylation is required for E-selectin induced signaling. Whether the sustained [Ca2+]ielevation following E-zz preincubation requires tyrosine phosphorylation has been difficult to assess, partly because PAF-induced Ca2+ mobilization itself is suppressed by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (data not shown). One possibility is that suppression of PAF-induced [Ca2+]i elevation was not sufficient to trigger E-zz-induced prolongation of [Ca2+]i elevation (Fig. 2 B). Cross-linking of neutrophil L-selectin induced a rapid and transient [Ca2+]i increase and O⨪2 generation, which were both inhibited by genistein (37.Crockett-Torabi E. Fantone J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H1302-H1308PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that activation of NADPH and Ca2+ mobilization may be downstream of the early signal cascade and require protein tyrosine kinase activation. In conclusion, we present data that soluble E-selectin can specifically alter PAF induced Ca2+ mobilization in neutrophils but has little effect on Ca2+ mobilization in response to other agonists. Exposure of neutrophils to soluble E-selectin also alters the capacity for production of damaging reactive oxygen species in a manner that is distinct from classical priming agents. In addition, neutrophil β2-integrin-mediated adhesion is also altered following exposure to E-selectin, with some degree of synergy observed when E-selectin-treated neutrophils are stimulated with other agonists,e.g. PAF. It is possible that engagement of E-selectin receptors on neutrophils may act physiologically to fine tune processes involved in adhesion and emigration. In view of recent findings that ligation of other neutrophil receptors such as CD31 (11.Varon D. Jackson D.E. Shenkman B. Dardik R. Tamarin I. Savion N. Newman P.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 500-507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), L-selectin (27.Steeber A.D. Engel P. Miller A.S. Sheetz M.P. Tedder T.F. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 952-963PubMed Google Scholar), or ICAM-3 (31.Feldhaus M.J. Kessel J.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6280-6287PubMed Google Scholar) influences either β2-integrin-mediated adhesion and/or production and release of reactive oxygen species, it seems likely that the repertoire of adhesion receptors engaged provides regulatory signals that determine neutrophil functional status. We are very grateful to Dr. M. Bird and C. Horgan (Glaxo Wellcome, UK) for the generous gift of the recombinant human E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecules."

Richards J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7276-7278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar),31P NMR has become the standard noninvasive technique to determine the intracellular pH in a variety of biological models, based on the dependence of the endogenous inorganic phosphate (Pi) chemical shift on pH. In addition, the ex vivo or in vivo use of 31P NMR can concomitantly give access to dynamic processes involving the cellular phosphorylated metabolites. However, the usefulness of Pias a 31P NMR probe for the measurement of pH in biological systems is limited by its low and varying concentration during metabolism and by its sensitivity to ionic strength. Indeed, owing to the large line widths of cellular peaks, and since the mean difference Δδab between the 31P NMR chemical shifts of the protonated (δa) and the unprotonated (δb) forms of Pi is only 2.6–2.7 ppm, it cannot be used to provide information on differences on pH between intra- and extracellular compartments of less than 0.2 pH units (2.Gillies R.J.

A number of endogenous and exogenous analogues of phosphates and phosphonic acid metabolites have been tested as alternatives to Pi for the 31P NMR measurement of pH but their pK a and chemical shifts were found to be influenced by ionic strength and Mg2+ concentration while their NMR sensitivity Δδab was not greatly increased with respect to that of Pi (1.Moon R.B.

A marked modulation of the pK a value range was obtained by introducing an amino function in the α position of the phosphonate structure (7.Brénot F. Aubry L. Martin J.B. Satre M. Klein G. Biochimie (Paris). 1992; 74: 883-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 10.Gillies R.J. Liu Z. Bhujwalla Z. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C195-C203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and examples of such charged aminophosphonates having their pK a values in a more acidic domain have been recently reported (7.Brénot F. Aubry L. Martin J.B. Satre M. Klein G. Biochimie (Paris). 1992; 74: 883-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, because the NMR sensitivity of these compounds was still in the range of 2–3 ppm (7.Brénot F. Aubry L. Martin J.B. Satre M. Klein G. Biochimie (Paris). 1992; 74: 883-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 10.Gillies R.J. Liu Z. Bhujwalla Z. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C195-C203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), they have met with limited success as pH probes despite their low toxicity and relative insensitivity to temperature and ionic strength. Taking into account the results of these previous studies (5–16), the rationale behind the present investigation was that, regarding the property of 31P NMR pH marker, there might be a favorable interplay between the phosphorylated and amine functions of a properly designed aminophosphonate if the preferred protonation site is at the nitrogen atom rather than at the anionic oxygen atoms linked to the phosphorus nucleus. Thus, the pK a would be very sensitive to the environment of the nitrogen atom and the31P NMR behavior (i.e. Δδab) would strongly depend on the substituents linked to the phosphorus nucleus and their electric charge. In this study, we have therefore designed a new series of uncharged α- and β-aminophosphonates with improved and versatile characteristics as 31P NMR pH probes in biological studies,i.e. that allow to investigate the largest range of pK a values and that may offer the maximum NMR sensitivity at a given pK a value (i.e.with resonances reasonably different from those of cellular metabolites, and the greatest Δδab values). The calibration curves of these phosphorylated pH probes have been obtained in modified Krebs-Henseleit medium and the effects of temperature and ionic composition have been assessed. Semi-empirical models have been established to correlate the experimental pK a, δa, and δb values with the chemical structure of any of the uncharged and charged aminophosphonates described herein or previously reported in the literature. Finally, to allow a sensitive detection by 31P NMR a concentration of at least 0.5 mm for such pH probes is required in biological experiments, and thus the toxicity of three selected uncharged α-aminophosphonates has been evaluated in normoxic isolated hearts. All reagents and commercially available phosphonates were of the highest grade from Aldrich Chimie, Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, France. The general structures of the studied aminophosphonates are indicated in Structure FS1. In the case of previously described syntheses, satisfactory elemental (± 0.3% for C, H, and P) and NMR data were obtained. Detailed synthetic procedures and analytical data for the three newly prepared α- and β-aminophosphonates are described in the “.” The following compounds were prepared according to published procedures: diethyl(2-methylpyrrolidin-2-yl)phosphonate 1(DEPMPH)1 (17.Fréjaville C.

Diethyl(1-tert-butylamino-2-methylprop-1-yl)phosphonate10 and diethyl(1-methylethylamino-1-cyclohexyl)phosphonate11 were obtained by a procedure described in Ref. 26.Grimaldi S. Ph. D. Thesis.

Tetraethyl(N-tert-butylaminomethylene)bisphosphonate12 was prepared by addition of POCl3 to a mixture of triethylphosphite andN-tert-butylacetamide as reported (20.Pietri, S., Miollan, M., Le Moigne, F., and Culcasi, M. (March 18, 1998) French Patent CNRS 98,03317Google Scholar, 23.Fields E.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1952; 74: 1528-1531Crossref Scopus (540) Google Scholar). 31P NMR spectra were acquired at 161.9 MHz with proton decoupling using a AMX400 Bruker spectrometer (Karlsruhe, Germany) equipped with a 10-mm broadband probe and a temperature control unit. The chemical shifts (δ) were expressed relative to external 85% H3PO4 in D2O. Fourier-transformed spectra were obtained with a pulse duration of 10 μs (90°) and a pulse interval of 1 s; the acquisition time was 2 s and 64 scans were typically averaged. As test compounds were intended to serve as pH markers in biological milieu, NMR titrations were performed in a standard Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing: KH2PO4 (1.2 mm), NaCl (118.5 mm), KCl (4.8 mm), MgSO4 (1.2 mm), NaHCO3 (25 mm), and EDTA (0.55 mm) in doubly distilled deionized water. Solutions of each test compound (5 mm) were freshly prepared and filtered through a 0.2-μm Millipore filter prior to use. For each test compound, the temperature of the solution was maintained at 20 or 37 °C using a circulating water bath, the pH was adjusted (Tacussel pH meter) to a selected value in the range 1.0–12.0 (10–30 values) using 6 m HCl or KOH and the final solution was transferred into a 10-mm sample tube for NMR assay. The pK avalue and the limiting chemical shifts δa and δb were calculated by iteratively fitting the δversus pH data (n = three independent experiments for each compound) to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, pH=pKa+log [(δ­δa)/(δb­δ)]Equation 1 using a nonlinear regression. To examine the effect of increasing ionic strength on titration curves, additional experiments were performed on 1 in which31P NMR spectra were recorded under the same conditions as stated above except that buffer contained 0.3 m of either NaCl or KCl. These experiments also allowed the measurement of the effects of high ionic strengths on the KH2PO4resonance peak (i.e. of Pi). Since the presence of calcium and glucose is required in many organ perfusion buffers (e.g. in isolated heart studies), their effect on titration curves was assessed in additional experiments using a CaCl2(2.5 mm)- and glucose (11.1 mm)-supplemented Krebs buffer. Male Wistar rats (350–370 g) were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection. Hearts were quickly excised and retrogradely perfused at 37 °C via the aorta in the nonrecirculating Langendorff mode. Constant perfusion pressure of 100 cm H2O was used. The perfusate was the CaCl2- and glucose-supplemented Krebs buffer prepared as described above, gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2 (pH 7.35) and passed through a 0.2-μm Millipore filter before use. A saline-filled latex balloon connected to a pressure transducer (Gould Statham P23) was inserted into the left ventricle, allowing measurement of contractile function. The filling pressure was adjusted until left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was in the range 8–12 mm Hg. The heart was enclosed into a water-jacketed chamber at a thermostatically controlled temperature of 37 °C. Throughout perfusion, heart rate, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, left ventricular developed pressure, and its first derivative with time, dp/dt, were monitored at 5-min intervals via a Gould 8000S recorder. Cardiac performance was estimated by rate pressure product, calculated as the product of heart rate and left ventricular developed pressure. Coronary flow was measured by timely collecting the coronary effluent.

The perfusion protocol consisted of a 30-min normothermic control period with plain buffer followed by three subsequent 30-min periods where increasing concentrations of the tested aminophosphonate were added to the perfusion medium, and a final 30-min stabilization period with plain buffer. Three groups of hearts (n = 6) receiving the following compounds: 1(at 5, 10, and 15 mm), 2 (at 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5 mm), and 3 (at 1, 5, and 10 mm) were studied and hemodynamic data were compared with that of an untreated group (n = 6) perfused with Krebs buffer throughout. In titration experiments, data represent the means of three separate experiments and are expressed as mean ± S.D. In hemodynamic experiments, data as absolute values are expressed as mean ± S.D. Evaluation of statistical significance was conducted by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), with repeated measures over the different phases of the experimental protocol. The 31P NMR chemical shift of each aminophosphonate was determined as a function of pH at 20 °C in standard Krebs buffer containing physiological concentrations of NaCl and KCl (i.e. 118.5 and 4.8 mm, respectively). The ionic strength of this buffer being 0.207, measured pK a values must therefore be considered as apparent pK a values as obtained in intracellular medium (ionic strength range 0.15–0.20). For all compounds monophasic titration curves were obtained which could be fitted to the equation of a single sigmoidal curve, likely suggesting that protonation always occurred at the nitrogen atom. The fits were characterized by the sets of data presented in Table I and representative titration curves are shown in Fig.1. Since compound 6 has two chiral centers (see Structure 1A), its couples of diastereoisomers6a and 6b can be distinguished by 31P NMR, yielding two distinct resonance peaks that allowed calculation of their respective pK a values (Table I).Table IpH-dependent 31 P NMR properties of aminophosphonates (5 mm)Chemical shift (ppm)Compounds20 °C37 °CδaδbΔδabpK aδaδbΔδabpK aKH2PO4 Pi−0.06 ± 0.002.62 ± 0.032.68 ± 0.036.75 ± 0.050.02 ± 0.002.63 ± 0.012.61 ± 0.016.69 ± 0.01NaCl, 300 mmaConcentrations used in high ionic strength studies.

Open table in a new tab Titrations were performed in a standard Krebs-Henseleit buffer as described under “Materials and Methods.” When compared with commonly used pH markers such as Pi and methylphosphonate, all α-aminophosphonates showed a 2–4-fold increase in sensitivity, as assessed by Δδab = δa − δb measurements (Table I). This increase in Δδab was also observed for the β-aminophosphonate 9 but in a lesser extent (Table I). Titration curves were also obtained in the same buffer at 37 °C for Pi and six selected compounds and, as expected, a general decrease in pK a with increasing temperature was observed (Table I). From temperature studies a change of −0.004 pH unit/°C was calculated for Pi, similar to that reported by DeFronzo and Gillies (6.DeFronzo M. Gillies R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11032-11037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for methylphosphonate. Interestingly, the decrease rate of pK a with increasing temperature was found higher for α-monophosphorylated compounds such as 1and 7 (i.e. −0.013 and −0.011 pH unit/°C, respectively) than for α-bisphosphorylated compounds such as3, 4, and 5 (i.e. −0.008, −0.005, and −0.005 pH unit/°C, respectively). Of the tested compounds, β-aminophosphonate 9 showed the most sensitive pK a dependence with temperature (−0.027 pH unit/°C). It is known that any change in ionic strength dramatically affects pK a values for Pi, methylphosphonate, and other phosphorylated metabolites (4.Robitaille P.M.L. Robitaille P.A. Brown Jr., G.G. Brown G.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 92: 73-84Google Scholar, 6.DeFronzo M. Gillies R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11032-11037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Stewart I.M. Chapman B.E. Kirk K. Kuchel P.W. Lovric V.A. Raftos J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 885: 23-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, when titrations were repeated for 1 at 20 °C under nonphysiological ionic strength conditions (i.e. in Krebs buffer containing KH2PO4 and supplemented with 0.3 m Na+ or K+, yielding a ionic strength of 0.388), the observed changes in pK a were even lower (i.e. +0.04 pH unit/0.1 m NaCl and +0.01 pH unit/0.1 m KCl; Table I) than that reported for methylphosphonate (6.DeFronzo M. Gillies R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11032-11037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) while the pK a of Pi was strongly decreased (i.e. −0.13 pH unit/0.1 m NaCl and −0.09 pH unit/0.1 m KCl; Table I). Consistently, when Krebs buffer was converted into a standard organ perfusion buffer by adding CaCl2 (2.5 mm) and glucose (11.1 mm), the pK a value of1 remained unchanged at 7.01. Since titration experiments showed that aminophosphonates have an enhanced potential as 31P NMR pH indicators with respect to Pi and other commonly used phosphonates (4.Robitaille P.M.L. Robitaille P.A. Brown Jr., G.G. Brown G.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 92: 73-84Google Scholar, 5.Labotka R.J. Kleps R.A.

Biochimie (Paris). 1989; 71: 941-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), it was considered pertinent to devise a predictive model that could account for the large pK a values and chemical shift ranges as a function of the chemical structure (Table I). According to the hypothesis that the nitrogen atom of tested compounds is the protonation site, the pK a should therefore mainly depend upon the substituents which are in the vicinity of the secondary amine function, i.e. those R1 − R6 connected to the two sp 3 carbon atoms bonded to the nitrogen atom (Fig.2 A). Assuming that the effect of substituents on pK a was additive, the validity of the linear model given by Equation 2 was tested, pKa=a0+∑ai·niEquation 2 where each substituent was classified into the seven types defined in Table II. In Equation 2, the coefficients n i and a i represent the number of each substituent of type i (with Σn i = 6) and its corresponding electronic effect on the pK a, respectively. Given that most of the studied compounds belong to the pyrrolidine series (termed as “cyclic alkyl” in Table II), the cyclic alkyl substituent was chosen as reference substituent with its coefficient a iarbitrary taken as 0. The coefficientsa 0-a 6 were computed by linear regression of the pK a values at 20 °C of the 14 tested pyrrolidines and aminophosphonates of Table I, together with additional data on six relevant nonphosphorylated secondary amines taken from the literature (Refs. 27.Gordon A.J. Ford R.A. The Chemist's Companion: A Handbook of Practical Data, Techniques, and References. Wiley-Interscience, New York1972: 55-81Google Scholar and 28.Sosnovsky G. Bell P. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 639-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, see TableIII). A satisfactory fit to the experimental pK a values was obtained with Equation 2(standard deviation ς = 0.46 pH unit), which was further improved in the final Equation 3 (ς = 0.17 pH unit) by introducing a new coefficient termed asa gem·n gem accounting for the geometric nonlinear effect induced when a second phosphorylated substituent is linked in gem position to a carbon substituted by a phosphorylated group (e.g. in compounds3, 4, and 12). pKa=a0+∑ai·ni+agem·ngemEquation 3 Tables II and III show the computed a ivalues and the calculated pK a values at 20 °C obtained from Equation 3, respectively.Table IICalculated effects of substituents on pKa values at 20 °C drawn from : pKa = a0 + (Σai·ni) + agem · ngemSubstituent typeCyclic alkylAlkylHPhenyl4-NO2-phenylCH2P(O)XYP(O)XYgem-P(O)XYivalue(reference)123456a i (pH u"

Turbidity studies showed no evidence of fibrin polymerization, although size exclusion chromatography, transmission electron microscopy, and dynamic light scattering studies showed small aggregates. These aggregates did not resemble normal protofibrils nor did they clot. Fibrinopeptide A release was normal, whereas fibrinopeptide B release was delayed approximately 3-fold. Plasmin cleavage of this fibrinogen was not changed by the presence of calcium or Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro, indicating that both the calcium-binding site and the “a” polymerization site were non-functional. We conclude that the loss of normal polymerization was due to the lack of “A-a” interactions. Moreover, functions associated with the C-terminal end of the γ chain, such as platelet aggregation and factor XIII cross-linking, were also disrupted, suggesting that this deletion of two residues affected the overall structure of the C-terminal domain of the γ chain.

The molecule is symmetric, consisting of two globular D nodules connected to a central E nodule by a coiled-coil region (1.Brown J.H. Volkmann N. Jun G. Henschen-Edman A.H. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The D nodule consists of a portion of the coiled-coil region and the C termini of both the Bβ and γ chains, whereas the E nodule consists of the N termini of all six polypeptides. Thrombin cleaves the N termini of both the Aα and the Bβ chains, releasing fibrinopeptides A (FpA)1 and B (FpB) and producing fibrin monomers that polymerize to form a fibrin clot. FpA is released first, exposing the polymerization site “A” that binds to the polymerization site “a” in the γ chain in the D domain of another molecule (2.Budzynski A.Z. Olexa S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1374-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This “A-a” interaction allows molecules to align into double-stranded, half-staggered protofibrils (3.Hantgan R.R. Hermans J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11272-11281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Ferry J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1952; 38: 566-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is unclear by what molecular mechanism FpB release affects polymerization, although a commonly accepted model proposes that FpB is released from growing protofibrils, enhancing the assembly of protofibrils into fibers (5.Blombäck B. Hessel B. Hogg D. Therkildsen L. Nature. 1978; 275: 501-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Weisel J.W. Biophys.

Res. 1990; 57: 183-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In vivo, the result of fibrin polymerization is an intricate fibrous network that, along with platelets, forms a hemostatic plug (11.Blombäck B. Thromb. Res. 1996; 83: 1-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallography studies have defined several important residues of the C-terminal domain of the γ chain. When the peptide Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro (GPRP), which mimics the “A” site, was co-crystallized with either two covalently linked D nodules (12.Spraggon G. Everse S.J. Doolittle R.F. Nature. 1997; 389: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) or the γ C-terminal fragment of the D nodule (13.Pratt K.P. Coté H.C.F. Chung D.W. Stenkamp R.E. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Two of the three high affinity calcium-binding sites in fibrinogen (14.Marguerie G. Chagniel G. Suscillion M. Biochim. Biophys.

These γ chain calcium-binding sites lie adjacent to the polymerization pocket “a” (12.Spraggon G. Everse S.J. Doolittle R.F.

The structure of the last 14 residues of the C terminus of the γ chain (γ398–γ411) has been difficult to resolve. Crystallography of a 30-kDa fragment of γ chain provided information through residue 401 (16.Yee V.C. Pratt K.P. Coté H.C.F. Le Trong I. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 125-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar); the last residue resolved in the structure of the 80-kDa fragment D was 398 (12.Spraggon G. Everse S.J. Doolittle R.F. Nature. 1997; 389: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, biochemical studies have shown that the sites necessary for factor XIII (FXIII) γ chain cross-linking and platelet aggregation reside in these C-terminal residues. Specifically, FXIII forms a covalent bond between γGln-398 on one molecule and γLys-406 from another molecule (17.Chen R. Doolitle R.F. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4486-4491Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The last four residues, γ408–411, are required for platelet aggregation (18.Rooney M.M. Parise L.V. Lord S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8553-8555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We have synthesized the recombinant fibrinogen, γΔ319,320, modeled after the heterozygous dysfibrinogen Vlissingen/Frankfurt IV (V/F IV), in which residues γAsn-319 and γAsp-320 are absent. We found that calcium binding, fibrin polymerization, and platelet aggregation were completely disrupted with the recombinant variant, in contrast to the plasma V/F IV fibrinogen, where functions were partially impaired (19.Koopman J. Haverkate F. Briet E. Lord S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13456-13461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the overall structure of the γ C-terminal fragment has been altered. All chemicals were of reagent grade and, unless specified, were purchased from Sigma. Human α-thrombin was purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories, Inc. (South Bend, IN), and recombinant hirudin was purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. Factor XIII was a generous gift from Dr. Kevin Siebenlist (Sinai Samaritan Medical Center, Milwaukee, WI). Plasminogen was purified from human plasma by the method previously described (20.Deutsch D.G. Mertz E.T. Science. 1970; 170: 1095-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar) and stored at −20 °C. Streptokinase was purchased from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT).

The 6 base pairs coding for Asn-319 and Asp-320 were deleted by oligo-directed mutagenesis using the Transformer TM site-directed mutagenesis kit fromCLONTECH Laboratories (Palo Alto, CA) based on the procedure described by Deng et al. (22.Deng W.P. Nickloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The primers used to construct the mutation have been described (23.Hogan K.A. Lord S.T.

Individual clones, secreting high amounts of fibrinogen as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, were grown in serum-free medium in roller bottles for large scale protein expression. The medium was harvested; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added, and the medium was stored at −20 or −70 °C. Both γΔ319,320 and normal recombinant fibrinogen (24.Gorkun O.V. Veklich Y.I. Weisel J.W. Lord S.T. Blood. 1997; 89: 4407-4414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and immunoaffinity chromatography using IF-1 monoclonal antibody (Iatron Corp., Tokyo, Japan) conjugated to Sepharose 4B (see Refs. 24.Gorkun O.V.

Proteins were dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl (HEPES buffer), aliquoted, and stored at −70 °C. To test the purity and assembly of the recombinant fibrinogen, proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reduced and non-reduced conditions by the method of Laemmli (26.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Polymerization was monitored at ambient temperature, and the change in turbidity at 350 nm using a Biospec 1601 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Corp., Tokyo, Japan) was as described (24.Gorkun O.V. Veklich Y.I. Weisel J.W. Lord S.T. Blood. 1997; 89: 4407-4414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, in a 100-μl cuvette (Starna Cells, Inc., Alscadero, CA), 10 μl of thrombin (0.5 units/ml) was added at zero time to 90 μl of fibrinogen (0.11 mg/ml), in HEPES buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2. Reactions were initiated by adding 10 μl of thrombin (4 units/ml) to 90 μl of fibrinogen (0.45 mg/ml). At specified time points, 1 μl of hirudin (2,000 units/ml) was added to inhibit thrombin. Samples were immediately injected onto an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech HR 10/30 column packed with Superose 6 resin according to the manufacturer's instructions; this resin has a separation range from 5 to 5,000 kDa. The column was equilibrated with the reaction buffer (HEPES buffer containing 1 mmCaCl2). The products were eluted under constant flow at 1 ml/min and monitored at 280 nm. The void volume was determined with blue dextran 2,000 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fibrinogen (0.1 mg/ml) was preincubated at ambient temperature for 15 min with EDTA (5 mm), CaCl2 (5 mm), or GPRP (2 mm). Meanwhile, 100 μl of plasminogen (0.11 mg/ml) was activated with 10 μl of streptokinase (10,000 units/ml) for 5 min, and 2 μl was added to the fibrinogen samples (100 μl) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. After incubation, the samples were run on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel, under non-reduced conditions, as described by Laemmli (26.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). The gel was electroblotted in 50 mm Tris, 380 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS, 20% methanol at 150 mA for 1.5 h to a nitrocellulose membrane (Micron Separations Inc, Westborough, MA). The membrane was blocked overnight at 4 °C in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) with 5% non-fat milk. Then it was incubated with a 1:10,000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal antiserum to fibrinogen (Dako, Carpenteria, CA) for 2 h in TBST (TBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (Aldrich)), containing 1% bovine serum albumin. The membrane was next washed three times with TBST and incubated with a 1:5000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Calbiochem) for 1 h in TBST with 1% bovine serum albumin. The blot was washed three times and developed with ECLTM Western blotting Detection Reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Reactions initiated by adding thrombin (either 0.01 or 0.005 units/ml) to fibrinogen (0.1 mg/ml) in HEPES buffer containing 1 mmCaCl2 were performed as described (27.Lord S.T. Strickland E. Jayjock E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2342-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Immediately after thrombin addition, the solutions were aliquoted, and at specified time points, the samples were boiled for 15 min to stop the reaction. The samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 × g, and the supernatants were stored at −70 °C. The amount of FpA and FpB in the supernatants was monitored by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. The FpA and FpB peak areas were calculated, and the data were fit to two successive first-order rate equations, and specificity constants,k cat/K m, were calculated as described (27.Lord S.T. Strickland E. Jayjock E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2342-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The means were compared by an unpaired ttest using Statview (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA). Reactions were initiated by adding 3 μl of thrombin (4 units/ml) to 27 μl of fibrinogen (0.45 mg/ml, HEPES buffer containing 1 mmCaCl2). At specified time points, 5 μl of the reaction was added to tubes containing 5 μl of hirudin (4 units/ml). These samples were immediately diluted in 90 μl of 50 mmammonium formate, 70% glycerol, pH 7.4, and sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica. The samples were dried and rotary-shadowed with tungsten in a Denton Vacuum DV-502, as described previously (28.Fowler W.E. Erickson H.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 134: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 29.Weisel J.W. Stauffacher C.V. Bullitt E. Cohen C. Science. 1985; 230: 1388-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 30.Veklich Y.I. Gorkun O.V. Medved L.V. Nieuwenhuizen W. Weisel J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13577-13585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The shadowed protein films were picked up on 400 mesh copper grids and viewed on a LEO EM 910 transmission electron microscope. The human platelets were isolated by the method previously described (18.Rooney M.M. Parise L.V. Lord S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8553-8555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, human blood was drawn into citrate, and the platelet-rich plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 800 rpm for 20 min. Prostaglandin E-1 (final concentration 20 nm) was added, and the sample was centrifuged again at 1800 rpm for 20 min. The pellet containing platelets was resuspended in Tyrode's buffer, pH 7.2 (10 mm HEPES, 135 mmNaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 5.5 mm glucose, 2% bovine serum albumin), and loaded onto a Sepharose CL-2B column. The platelets were eluted, and CaCl2 was added to 1 mm and MgCl2added to 2 mm. For aggregation, 2 × 108platelets/ml were preincubated at 37 °C with 250 nmfibrinogen, prior to activation with 10 μm ADP. Aggregation of stirred solutions was monitored with a platelet aggregometer (Chrono-Log) as the increase in light transmission. Normal and γΔ319,320 fibrinogens were assayed three times with one platelet donor. For fibrin cross-linking, each reaction contained 16 μl of fibrinogen (0.375 mg/ml), 2 μl of FXIII (0.04 mg/ml), and 2 μl of thrombin (3 units/ml) in HEPES buffer containing 1 mmCaCl2. After incubation at ambient temperature, the reaction was stopped with the addition of reducing buffer followed by boiling. For γΔ319,320 fibrinogen, an additional set of experiments was performed where 16 μl of fibrinogen (0.375 mg/ml) was first incubated with 2 μl of thrombin (3 units/ml) for 4 h. Next, 2 μl of FXIII (40 units/ml) and 1 μl of thrombin (3 units/ml) were added and incubated for the specified times. For fibrinogen cross-linking, 18 μl of FXIII (0.67 mg/ml) and 18 μl of thrombin (20 units/ml) were mixed in the presence of HEPES buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2 and incubated at 37 °C for 35 min to activate the FXIII. Thrombin was inhibited by incubating with 12 μl of hirudin (450 units/ml) at ambient temperature for 1 min. Four μl of the FXIIIa mix was added to 16 μl fibrinogen (0.375 mg/ml) and incubated at ambient temperature for the specified times. All cross-linked products were analyzed on 7.5% reduced gels, electrophoresed, and blotted as described for the plasmin protection assay. The variant γΔ319,320 fibrinogen was further purified by gel filtration chromatography with an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech 10/50 HR column packed with Superose 6B resin. The elution buffer was HEPES buffer, and the flow rate was 1 ml/min. Peak fractions were collected, concentrated using a Millipore Ultrafree® centrifugal filter device (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and used for polymerization. All fibrinogen solutions were filtered using a 0.2-μm Millipore filter before use to remove dust. Light-scattering intensity versus time measurements were performed using a 35-milliwatt He-Ne laser (model 120, Spectra Physics Inc., Mountain View, CA), a red-sensitive photomultiplier tube (R298P, Hamatsu, Middlesex, NJ), and a Brookhaven Instruments BI200 SM goniometer at a 90o angle (31.Hantgan R.R. Paumi C. Rocco M. Weisel J.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14461-14474Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 32.Hantgan R.R. Braaten J.V. Rocco M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3935-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For dynamic light scattering, a 72-channel digital correlator (BI-2030 AT, Brookhaven Instruments) was used with a “multiple sample times” option to divide each channel into four distinct real-time bases, allowing for an expanded decay time collection range. Data were acquired using the program BI-30ATN, and the resultant auto-correlation functions were analyzed employing cumulants analysis to obtain z-average translational diffusion coefficients (33.Koppel D.E. J. Chem. Phys. 1972; 57: 4814-4820Crossref Scopus (2730) Google Scholar, 34.Johnson C.S. Gabriel D.A. Bell J.E. Spectroscopy in Biochemistry. 2.

Polymerizations were performed at 0.2 mg/ml fibrinogen, 0.3 units/ml thrombin in HEPES buffer. Time-averaged intensities were taken incrementally for 4 h. The recombinant fibrinogen γΔ319,320 was synthesized and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” SDS-PAGE performed under non-reduced conditions demonstrated that the variant fibrinogen was pure and that it was assembled into the 340-kDa molecule (data not shown). A reduced gel showed that all three chains were produced and were intact (Fig. 1). As previously demonstrated with the plasma fibrinogen V/F IV (19.Koopman J. Haverkate F. Briet E. Lord S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13456-13461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the variant γ chain (lane 2) had a different mobility than the normal γ chain (lane 1). The difference in mobility was clearly seen in lane 3, with a 1:1 mix of normal and variant γ chain. Thrombin-catalyzed polymerization was monitored as turbidity at 350 nm. Under conditions where normal fibrinogen polymerized rapidly, γΔ319,320 fibrinogen did not show a rise in turbidity (Fig. 2). Additional experiments (data not shown) were performed under varied conditions that augment polymerization. Nevertheless, no turbidity change was detected with γΔ319,320 fibrinogen, even when the thrombin concentration was increased to 10 units/ml, the fibrinogen concentration was increased to 1.3 mg/ml, the temperature was lowered to 14 °C, the duration of the experiment was extended to 14 h, or the calcium concentration was raised to 10 mm. To test whether the polymerization curves resulted from a blocked “A” site, we measured fibrinopeptide A and B release from normal and γΔ319,320 fibrinogen over a 2-h time course. The data were fit to two successive first-order rate equations under the assumption that FpA was released before FpB (37.Ng A.S. Lewis S.D. Shafer J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 341-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows that indeed both FpA and FpB were released from γΔ319,320 fibrinogen, but the release of FpB was delayed relative to normal fibrinogen. The kinetic data presented in Table I show that FpA was released at a normal rate, whereas FpB was released at a rate about 3-fold slower than normal. The delayed release of FpB indicates that protofibril formation was impaired, as the release of FpB is reported to be accelerated by protofibril formation (5.Blombäck B. Hessel B. Hogg D. Therkildsen L. Nature. 1978; 275: 501-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Table ISpecificity constants (Kcat/Km) for fibrinopeptide releaseFibrinogenFibrinopeptideK cat/K mpvalueNormalFpA12 ± 61.0γΔ319, 320FpA12 ± 4NormalFpB6.8 ± 2.30.03aRepresents a significant pvalue.γΔ319, 320FpB2.2 ± 0.6The units are 10−6m−1 s−1.

The average of three experiments is shown ± the standard deviation. To determine whether the “a” site was functional in γΔ319,320 fibrinogen, we examined plasmin cleavage in the presence of GPRP, which mimics the “A” site (38.Laudano A.P. Doolittle R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3085-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). After incubating γΔ319,320 or normal fibrinogen with GPRP, we performed a plasmin digest as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 4, normal fibrinogen was protected from plasmin cleavage by the presence of GPRP (lane 3), as the product labeled D1 remained. Normal fibrinogen was also protected from cleavage in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2 (lane 4), as described previously (39.Haverkate F. Timan G. Thromb. Res. 1977; 10: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In the absence of calcium or GPRP (lane 1), plasmin cleavage was demonstrated by the loss of the D1 product and the appearance of D2 and D3, as described previously (39.Haverkate F. Timan G. Thromb. Res. 1977; 10: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 40.Yamazumi K. Doolittle R.F. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1719-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We examined plasmin cleavage of γΔ319,320 fibrinogen under all three conditions and found no protection from plasmin cleavage as evidenced by the D2 and D3 products (lanes 6–8). Because the two-residue deletion removed part of the high affinity calcium-binding site (13.Pratt K.P. Coté H.C.F. Chung D.W. Stenkamp R.E. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7176-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 16.Yee V.C. Pratt K.P. Coté H.C.F. Le Trong I. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 125-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), it was not surprising that calcium provided no protection to γΔ319,320 fibrinogen (lane 8), similar to data obtained with plasma V/F IV (19.Koopman J. Haverkate F. Briet E. Lord S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13456-13461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We conclude from the plasmin cleavage profile that GPRP did not bind to γΔ319,320 fibrinogen. We further examined the polymerization of γΔ319,320 fibrin by size exclusion chromatography to determine whether products larger than fibrin monomers were formed (Fig. 5). At various time points, thrombin was inhibited, and the reaction products were immediately run on a size exclusion column. When thrombin was added to normal fibrinogen, polymerization was evident almost instantly. A peak at the void volume was seen as early as 28 s (data not shown), and a small monomer peak was still evident at 1 min (Fig. 5, panel B). After 3 min, a monomer peak was not detected (panel C), and only a small peak at the void volume was seen. With γΔ319,320 fibrinogen, the result was quite different. At 3 min (panel E), most of the protein was still in the monomer peak. A peak at the void volume was not seen until 30 min (data not shown), and after 240 min (panel F), the monomer peak was still evident. The void volume peak was not present when γΔ319,320 fibrinogen was incubated with inhibited thrombin for 240 min (data not shown), ensuring that the formation of high molecular components was thrombin-dependent. Finally, we observed that the size distribution of larger species was different between the normal and γΔ319,320 fibrin. For example, at 1 min, normal fibrinogen had two distinctive fractions represented by two peaks with little material between the two peaks. In contrast, at 240 min, γΔ319,320 fibrin had two major peaks, but there was also evidence of a broad spectrum of material between these two peaks. We concluded that γΔ319,320 fibrin is capable of forming higher molecular weight species, although the nature of this material could not be determined by size exclusion chromatography. To characterize this high molecular weight material, we used transmission electron microscopy. We performed reactions as for size exclusion chromatography, inhibited thrombin at specific times, and immediately diluted and sprayed the solutions onto mica. The samples were visualized by rotary shadowing with tungsten (Fig. 6). Under these conditions, normal fibrin became a gel within 1 min, such that at 1 min and thereafter only the unclottable/soluble fraction of normal fibrin was visible by transmission electron microscopy, and the microscopic fields were sparsely populated with molecules (Fig. 6, panel C). We limited our analysis of normal fibrin to time points ≤1 min, and we assumed that the discernible fibrin monomers and aggregates were those that did not incorporate into the clot. In contrast, under these conditions γΔ319,320 fibrin did not form a gel, and over the 4-h incubation, microscopic fields remained densely populated with molecules (Fig. 6, panel D). As can be seen in Fig. 6, the γΔ319,320 fibrinogen molecules (panel B) appeared the same as normal fibrinogen molecules (panel A); most γΔ319,320 fibrinogen molecules appeared tri-nodular, and the majority of molecules were monomeric, and there were no obvious abnormal structures. Following incubation with thrombin, both normal and γΔ319,320 fibrin demonstrated a shift in the population of molecules seen. We analyzed many fields, counted the number of molecules, and scored these as monomers, pairs, or aggregates (TableII). Paired molecules were defined as two molecules touching each other in any orientation, whereas aggregates were defined as a group of three molecules or more. The data were expressed as a percentage of molecules (of total counted) in monomers, pairs, or aggregates, where, for example, the number of molecules counted as pairs was twice the number of pairs. Aggregates from both normal and γΔ319,320 fibrin were scored as being either elongated, indicated by an arrowhead, or irregular-shaped, indicated by an asterisk, in Fig. 6, panels E andF. Often, it was difficult to discern if a nodule belonged to one molecule or another, so the number of monomers per aggregate was based on an estimate of the total number of nodules seen (one molecule is tri-nodular).

https://openalex.org/W2021592268,"Among the large number of hypothetical proteins within the genomes of Helicobacter pylori, there is a family of unique and highly disulfide-bridged proteins, designated family 12, for which no function could originally be assigned. Sequence analysis revealed that members of this family possess a modular architecture of α/β-units and a stringent pattern of cysteine residues. The H. pylori cysteine-rich protein A (HcpA), which is a member of this family, was expressed and refolded from inclusion bodies. Six pairs of cysteine residues, which are separated by exactly seven residues, form disulfide bridges. HcpA is a β-lactamase. It slowly hydrolyzes 6-aminopenicillinic acid and 7-aminocephalosporanic acid (ACA) derivatives. The turnover for 6-aminopenicillinic acid derivatives is 2–3 times greater than for ACA derivatives. The enzyme is efficiently inhibited by cloxacillin and oxacillin but not by ACA derivatives or metal chelators. We suggest that all family 12 members possess similar activities and might be involved in the synthesis of the cell wall peptidoglycan. They might also be responsible for amoxicillin resistance of certain H. pylori strains.

Marshall B. Lancet. 1983; 1: 1273-1275PubMed Google Scholar). It settles in the gastric lumen of primates, and it is a major risk factor for several gastric diseases (2.Blaser M.J. J. Infect.

For approximately two-thirds of all ORFs,1 a function was assigned by sequence comparisons. A group of seven ORFs that were unique to H. pylori was identified. This group was called family 12 (9), but a functional assignment was impossible. In order to work toward the functional and structural characterization of family 12, we expressed and characterized the gene product of HP0211. Cao et al. (11.Cao P. McClain M.S. Forsyth M.H. Cover T.L. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2984-2986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) identified the HP0211 gene product inH. pylori culture broth supernatant, verifying that this gene was expressed and secreted into the medium. The protein was termed HcpA (H. pylori cysteine-rich protein A), but a function was not assigned. In a further study, the HP0160 gene product, which is another family 12 member, was identified in H. pylorimembrane fractions, and it was shown that this gene product was able to bind penicillin derivatives (12.Krishnamurthy P. Parlow M.H. Schneider J. Burroughs S. Wickland C. Vakil N.B. Dunn B.E. Phadnis S.H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5107-5110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) and β-lactamases are enzymes that belong to the same class of proteins. PBPs are involved in the assembly, regulation, and maintenance of the cell wall peptidoglycan. They have in common that they covalently bind penicillins, but their biological functions are more diverse, involving carboxypeptidase, transpeptidase, and transglycosylase activities. In contrast to PBPs, β-lactamases hydrolyze β-lactame antibiotics. Many β-lactamases evolved from PBPs under the selective pressure of β-lactame antibiotics (13.Kelly J.A. Dideberg O. Charlier P. Wery J.P. Libert M. Moews P.C. Knox J.R. Duez C. Fraipont C. Joris B. Science. 1986; 231: 1429-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Four classes of β-lactamases (classes A, B, C, and D) and six PBP classes are known (classes A, B, and C and low and high molecular weight of each) (reviewed in Refs. 14.Massova I. Mobashery S.

Most of these proteins contain an active site serine residue, but a minority are zinc-dependent enzymes (β-lactamase class B). Here we report the recombinant expression, refolding, and characterization of the HP0211 gene product. This gene codes for a protein that binds and hydrolyzes penicillin derivatives and might be involved in H. pylori antibiotic resistance. Since there are no sequence similarities with known β-lactamase or PBP classes, we suggest that HcpA belongs to a new class of β-lactamases, designated class E. Multiple sequence alignment, dot blot analysis, and data base searches were done with the program package GCG from the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (18.Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11514) Google Scholar) or with the program ClustalX (19.Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G.

Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4911) Google Scholar), and secondary structure was predicted using the PredictProtein server (21.Rost B.

The HP0211 gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the 3′- and 5′-end primers TACGCTCCCGGGTTAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGT GAAGTTCTATTTTTAATTCCTTGAGAGC and GCACCCCATGGCAGAGCCAGACGCTAAAG, respectively. The first 23 amino acids corresponding to the leader peptide were deleted, and the C terminus was extended by a His6 tag. After digestion with the restriction enzymes NcoI and XbaI, the insert was ligated into a pTFT74 expression vector and transformed intoEscherichia coli BL21-competent cells. Ampicillin-resistant colonies were screened for expression in 1-ml cultures. A 2-liter culture of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated with 40 ml of a stationary overnight culture of HcpA expressing BL21 cells. Cultures were grown at 37 °C with constant agitation (270 rpm). After approximately 2 h (A 600 = 0.7), expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cultures were grown for an additional 3 h, and cells were harvested by centrifugation (30 min, 2,000 × g, 4 °C). Cells were suspended in 10–20 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, 2 mm magnesium sulfate, pH 6.8) and ruptured by sonification. 50 μg/ml DNase and 65 μg/ml RNase were added, and the solution was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After adding EDTA and CHAPS to final concentrations of 25 mm and 0.25%, respectively, the solution was kept on ice for an additional 30 min. Inclusion bodies were collected by centrifugation (15 min, 20,000 × g, 4 °C), and the soluble fraction was discarded. The pellet was washed two times with buffer A (0.1 m Tris/HCl, 20 mmEDTA, pH 6.8) and subsequently buffer B (0.5 m GdnCl in buffer A). Inclusion bodies were solubilized in buffer C (5m GdnCl, 0.2 m Tris/HCl, 0.1 m DTT, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. Solubilized inclusion bodies were dialyzed against buffer D (5 m GdnCl, 0.1 m acetic acid). HcpA was refolded by immobilizing the solubilized inclusion bodies to Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) and removing the guanidinium hydrochloride from the buffer. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (ε595 = 0.084 ml·μg−1·cm−1) or amino acid analysis. 80 mg of unfolded HcpA was loaded onto 7 ml of Ni2+-NTA-agarose in buffer D. After adjusting the pH to 8.0, the slurry was filled into a column. A 400-ml gradient from 5 to 0m GdnCl in 0.1 m Tris/HCl, 3 mmGSH, pH 8.0, refolded the immobilized protein (flow 1 ml/min, 20 °C). Protein was eluted with 0.25 m imidazolium, 40 mm MES, pH 6.8, and protein-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer E (40 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 5.4). To separate misfolded from active protein, the material was further purified on an ampicillin affinity matrix. Ampicillin was bound to activated agarose beads (Affi-Gel® 10 Gel, Bio-Rad) according to the guidelines of the manufacturer. 25 mg of refolded protein was bound to 2 ml of ampicillin affinity resin, washed with 20–30 ml of buffer E, and eluted with 10 ml of 0.8 m hydroxylamine in buffer E. Purified HcpA was dialyzed extensively against buffer E. Protein samples were analyzed on a Nucleosil 300/5 C8 reversed phase column attached to a Hewlett Pakard 1100 Chemstation HPLC system in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water. The sample was eluted with 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in 84% acetonitrile/water at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and detected at a wavelength of 215 nm. For gel filtration chromatography, a Superdex 200 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline buffer (150 mm sodium chloride, 20 mm sodium phosphate) (pH 5.4) and calibrated with a standard mixture of proteins (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The following elution profile was used for calibration: blue dextran (2 MDa), 7.8 ml; bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), 13.8 ml; ovalbumin (43 kDa), 14.9 ml; chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), 17.1 ml; ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa), 17.8 ml.

Dye-labeled protein was separated by 15% SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, and the gels were scanned at 530 nm on a Molecular Dynamics Fluorimager 575. β-Lactamase activity was assayed spectroscopically by using various chromogenic substrates. Ampicillin, amoxicillin, cefotaxime, cloxacillin, and benzylpenicillin were from Fluka; carbenicillin, cefalotin, cefoxitin, cephaloridine, and oxacillin were from Sigma; and nitrocefine was from Becton Dickinson. Ampicillin sulfone was a kind gift from the group of A. Plückthun (Zürich, Switzerland). All reactions were performed in phosphate-buffered saline buffer (pH 6.0) at 25 °C on a Cary 300 UV spectrophotometer. IC50 values were determined with 200 μm nitocefine at a protein concentration of 27 μg/ml. Data were processed as described (24.Copeland R.A. Enzymes: A Practical Introduction to Structure, Mechanism, and Data Analysis. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1996: 187-223Google Scholar). The folding/unfolding behavior was investigated by CD spectroscopy and by binding the fluorescent dye 8-anilino-1-naphtalenesulfonic acid (ANS) to HcpA. CD spectra were recorded at a protein concentration of 5 μm in 0–3m GdnCl, 30 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.9, on a Jasco J-751 CD spectrometer. ANS fluorescence was recorded at a protein concentration of 6.5 μm in 0–3 m GdnCl, 0.1 mm ANS, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.9, and on a PTI-500 fluorescence spectrometer. The excitation wavelength was 350 nm. Fluorescence at 472 nm was plotted over the GdnCl concentration. The temperature was maintained at 22 °C, and the data were fitted to Equation 1 (25.Pace C.N.

Disulfide bridges were reduced by adding 0.5 μl of 25 mm triscarboxyethylphosphine (Pierce) to 2 μl of the digested sample (20 min, 21 °C). 2 μl of the reduced and oxidized digests were mixed with 2 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and desalted with a ZipTip C18 (Millipore Corp.).

According to this analysis, ORFs HP0235, HP0160, HP0211, HP0336, HP00628, HP1098, and HP1117 belong to family 12 (9) (Fig.1 a). The ORFs share between 66 and 22% sequence identity and are rich in cysteine, lysine, and arginine residues. All sequences besides HP0628 and HP0336 possess significant N-terminal signal sequences that guide these proteins into the periplasmic space. Dot plot analysis (18.Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11514) Google Scholar) reveal significant homology within each ORF, indicating that these proteins are composed of several repeats of a common sequence motif. The number of repeats varies between four for HP0336 and nine for HP0235. The sequence motif is approximately 36 residues long and shows a characteristic profile. The most prominent feature of this profile is two cysteine residues that are separated by seven residues (Fig. 1 b). The cysteine residues are preceded by alanine, glycine, or serine residues and are present in all family members except HP1117. There is also a conserved alanine residue at position 10 of the profile (Fig. 1 b). Residues up to the first cysteine residue are predicted to fold into an α-helix, and residues on the C-terminal side of the second cysteine are predicted to fold into a β-sheet conformation. The exact boundaries of the secondary structure predictions differ slightly, but the predictions are the same for all ORFs. Data base searches did not reveal sequence homology with any protein of known function. As anticipated due to the presence of 12 cysteine residues, recombinant HcpA accumulated in an insoluble form as inclusion bodies in E. coli. Several refolding protocols were tested. When the protein was refolded by dilution, the protein was soluble but precipitated upon concentration. We therefore refolded the protein when it was immobilized on a Ni2+-NTA-agarose column. This method had two advantages. It combined the purification and the refolding steps, and the protein was eluted at a relatively high concentration of 3–4 mg/ml. At the beginning of this investigation, the function of HcpA was unknown, and the refolding was done under standard conditions. When a functional assay became available, we optimized the refolding conditions such that the specific activity was maximized. A basic pH (pH > 7) and the presence of reduced glutathione were beneficial, but the addition of arginine and oxidized glutathione reduced the specific activity and were therefore omitted. The protein was pure, according to SDS-PAGE and HPLC analysis as indicated in Figs. 2,a and b, and3 a and was concentrated to 5–10 mg/ml. The yield of soluble protein was between 25 and 30%. To separate traces of misfolded molecules from the native protein, we added an affinity chromatography step. HcpA was bound to ampicillin that was immobilized on agarose beads by its primary amino group. After extensive washing, the bond between the protein and ampicillin was cleaved by hydroxylamine treatment.Figure 3a, reversed phase HPLC chromatogram of refolded (thin line) and reduced HcpA (bold line).

The slope of the regression line (dashed line) indicates that 11.8 SH groups/mol of protein react with DTNB after reduction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The oligomerization state of purified HcpA was analyzed by gel filtration chromatography. The protein eluted as a single peak at 16.7 ± 0.1 ml, indicating that the protein is monomeric in solution (data not shown). The HcpA sequence contains 12 cysteine residues. In order to determine if these cysteine residues form disulfide bridges, we analyzed the reaction with 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB). As shown in Fig.3 b, DTNB is not reduced by refolded HcpA under native conditions or in the presence of 3 m GdnCl. However, DTNB reacted with HcpA prior to refolding. This indicates that there are no free SH groups present on the surface of refolded HcpA or buried in the hydrophobic core. All cysteine residues must be involved in disulfide bridges. This is also supported by the different retention times of native and reduced protein in reversed phase HPLC (Fig. 3 a) and by the molecular mass of refolded HcpA. In contrast to the native protein that elutes after 20.6 min as a single peak with a small shoulder, the reduced protein (3 m GdnCl, 0.2 mDTT, 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 15 min at 95 °C) elutes as a double peak after 23.3 min. A decreased retention time is frequently found for oxidized proteins. The molecular mass of refolded HcpA was determined by mass spectroscopy to be 25,613.3 ± 1.6 Da, whereas the molecular mass predicted from the sequence was 25,625.0 Da. The mass determination was consistent with the presence of six disulfide bridges and the absence of the N-terminal methionine. The processing of Met24 was validated by N-terminal sequencing (data not shown). Disulfide bridges in HcpA were assigned by tryptic digestion and subsequent reduction of the peptide mixture with triscarboxyethylphosphine. The MALDI spectra of oxidized peptides contained signals for five peptides that included cysteine pairs (Table I). The mass differences between oxidized and reduced peptides confirmed that cysteine pairs Cys56/Cys64, Cys92/Cys100, Cys128/Cys136, Cys164/Cys172, and Cys196/Cys204 formed disulfide bridgesa, b, c, f, andg in refolded HcpA. However, no unique peptide containing a disulfide bridge between Cys232 and Cys240(disulfide h) was observed, although DTNB titration strongly suggested the presence of six disulfide bridges. Cys232 and Cys240 should also form a disulfide bridge, because no free SH groups were detected in refolded HcpA, and all cysteine residues besides these two residues were assigned to disulfide bridges. In addition, the observed intramolecular sequence similarity suggested that the disulfide connectivity is the same for all α/β-units. HcpA contained 34 theoretical trypsin cleavage sites, and five of them cluster around the proposed disulfide bridge h. Perhaps the resulting peptides are simply too small for MALDI mass spectroscopy, or the digestion products are too heterogeneous.Table IDisulfide-containing peptides after tryptic digestion of HcpAPeptideMass of oxidized peptideaMonoisotopic masses of singly charged ions are given.PeptideMass of reduced peptideaMonoisotopic masses of singly charged ions are given.SequenceDeterminedTheoreticalDeterminedTheoreticalDaDa31–35/36–512297.442298.0631–35563.76563.29A C ELK36–511737.471737.79NGFG C VFLGAFYEEGK67–912648.422649.1767–912650.482651.19G C ELNDGYG C NLLGNLYYNGQGVSK103–1272606.452607.19103–1272608.522609.21A C DLNHAEG C MVLGSLHHYGVGTPK139–1592215.472216.04139–1592217.522218.05A C DLKDSPG C INAGYTYSVTK171–175/179–1952377.452378.10171–175563.76563.29A C ELK179–1951817.471817.83G C YNLGVMQYNAQGTAKa Monoisotopic masses of singly charged ions are given.

We repeated similar experiments with the refolded and purified HcpA protein and the chromogenic penicillin derivatives 6′-Flu-Gly-6-APA (22.Lakaye B. Damblon C. Jamin M. Galleni M. Lepage S. Joris B.

Since both substances had only the penicillin moiety in common, it was unlikely that binding was mediated by the chromogenic groups. However, we also tested the ability of HcpA to hydrolyze other β-lactame substances. The results for a panel of frequently used β-lactame antibiotics are summarized in Table II. HcpA hydrolyzed several APA and ACA derivatives, indicating that besides its penicillin binding activity HcpA possesses also a β-lactamase activity. Using the chromogenic substrate nitrocefine, we analyzed the pH and temperature dependences of the hydrolysis (Fig. 5). The maximum activity was observed for pH 5.5. At acidic or basic conditions, HcpA is approximately 3–5 times less active. The temperature optimum was between 35 and 40 °C. HcpA was efficiently inhibited by APA derivatives such as carbenicillin, cloxacillin, and oxacillin. ACA derivatives like cefotaxime, cefoxitin, and cefalotin were much less effective. Metal chelators such as EDTA and dipicolinic acid had no significant inhibitory activity.Table IIKinetic and inhibitory parameters of HcpASubstanceConcentrationΔɛλKmk catIC50aInhibition at 200 μmnitrocefine, 1 μm HcpA, 150 mm sodium chloride, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 25 °C.μmm −1 cm −1nmμmmin −1μm6-Aminopenillinic acid derivatives Ampicillin20–1,000−8202351451.06NDbND, not detected.

Since HcpA does not contain any tryptophane residues, we investigated the fluorescence quenching of ANS as a function of the guanidinium hydrochloride concentration. In the absence of GdnCl, HcpA possesses a CD spectrum that indicates a high α-helix content (Fig. 6 a). From the CD spectrum, the contents of α-helix, β-sheet, turn, and random coil were determined to be 46, 30, 10, and 14%, respectively. From the sequence, the α-helix, β-sheet, and random coil contents were predicted to be 51, 13, and 36%, respectively. In the presence of 3 m GdnCl, the α-helix signal vanished completely from the CD spectrum. By plotting the CD signal at 222 nm over the GdnCl concentration, the free energy of unfolding (Δ GH2O) and the cooperativity parameter (m) were determined from the intercepts and the slopes of the curves at the transition phase. Similar values were obtained when folding/unfolding was monitored by ANS fluorescence. From the titration curves shown in Fig. 6,a and b, we calculated Δ GH2O values of 18.1 (CD) and 25.8 kJ/mol (ANS) and m values of 15.1 (CD) and 16.6 kJ/(mol·m) (ANS) for the unfolding of HcpA. The protein HcpA was expressed, refolded from inclusion bodies, and purified by Ni2+-NTA and affinity chromatography.

Phosphorylation of serine 480 was attributable to the action of protein kinase C. Using a permanently dephosphorylated form of rat VAChT, S480A rVAChT, it was shown that this mutant displays the same kinetics for the transport of acetylcholine and the binding of the inhibitor vesamicol as does the wild type transporter. However, sucrose gradient density centrifugation showed that, unlike wild type VAChT, the S480A mutant did not localize to synaptic vesicles.

Eiden L.E. Bonner T.I. Erickson J.D. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18 (224): 281Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Acetylcholine (ACh) transport involves the exchange of two luminal protons for each molecule of cytoplasmic transmitter transported into the vesicle (2.Song H. Ming G. Fon E. Bellocchio E.

The driving force for transport is derived from a proton electrochemical gradient across the vesicular membrane generated by a vacuolar type H+-ATPase located on the synaptic vesicle (5.Rudnick G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1986; 48: 403-413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,6.Parsons S.M. Prior C. Marshall I.G. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1993; 35: 279-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The filled vesicles release their contents through exocytosis, producing an action potential at the nerve terminal (7.Smith A.D. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1992; 36: 103-131Google Scholar). As a consequence of this process VAChT is transported with the synaptic vesicle to the plasma membrane where it fuses with the plasma membrane. Synaptic vesicles and their component proteins, including VAChT, are recycled from the plasma membrane back to the synaptic vesicle by endocytosis via an endosomal compartment (8.De Camilli P. Jahn R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 625-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). This cycle is critical for neurotransmission, and it appears that newly synthesized synaptic vesicle proteins are transported to the plasma membrane even before they reach the synaptic vesicle (9.Matteoli M.

The amino acid sequence of VAChT has revealed that it belongs to a family of transporters which includes the monoamine transporters VMAT1 and VMAT2.

Feldman J. Kohan S.A. Shirzadi A. Gundersen C.B. Brecha N. Edwards R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10620-10624Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The 12 transmembrane domains are highly conserved and maintain native conformation of the transporters (4.Varoqui H. Erickson J.D. Mol. Neurobiol. 1997; 15: 165-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the cytoplasmic amino and carboxyl-terminal domains are rather divergent (4.Varoqui H. Erickson J.D. Mol. Neurobiol. 1997; 15: 165-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that VMAT2 can be phosphorylated by casein kinase I, and possibly casein kinase II, on two serine residues, serine 512 and serine 514, located on the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic tail (15.Krantz D.E. Peter D. Liu Y. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6752-6759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These serine residues are not conserved in VAChT, and thus the question of whether or not VAChT is also phosphorylated on the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic tail or elsewhere has been addressed in this study. We utilized a mutant PC12 cell line, PC12A123.7, which has reduced levels of protein kinase A type I and type II activity (16.Ginty D.D. Glowacka D. DeFranco C. Wagner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15325-15333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and as a consequence VAChT gene transcription is reduced (17.Shimojo M. Wu D. Hersh L.B. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1118-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) such that VAChT protein is undetectable. On the other hand, PC12A123.7 contains synaptic vesicles which can be reconstituted with recombinant VAChT to produce a transport competent vesicle (18.Kim M.-H. Lu M. Lim E.-J. Chai Y.-G. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 673-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this study this system has been used to demonstrate that rVAChT, like VMAT2, is phosphorylated on its COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain. However, VAChT phosphorylation occurs at a distinct site and appears to be catalyzed by protein kinase C, rather than casein kinase II as is the case for VMAT2. Studies of a VAChT species in which the phosphorylation site is removed by site-directed mutagenesis suggests that phosphorylation of rVAChT may play a role in trafficking of the transporter. We used for these studies a parental PC12 cell line, a protein kinase A (PKA) deficient variant of the parental PC12 cell referred to as PC12A123.7 (16.Ginty D.D. Glowacka D. DeFranco C. Wagner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15325-15333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a derivative of PC12A123.7 stably transfected with a rat VAChT cDNA, PC12A123.7/VAChT (18.Kim M.-H. Lu M. Lim E.-J. Chai Y.-G. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 673-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were maintained at 37 °C in 10% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% horse serum, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The PKA-deficient PC12 cell line PC12A123.7 was maintained in F-12 medium containing 5% horse serum, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. PC12A123.7/VAChT was cultured in the same media with 100 μg/ml G418 added. For transient transfection of PC12A123.7, cells were suspended at a density of ∼6 × 107 cells/ml in cold phosphate-buffered saline. To the cell suspension was added 100 μg of plasmid DNA and following a 10-min incubation on ice, cells were electroporated in a 0.4-cm gap cuvette (Bio-Rad) at 0.2 kV, 950 microfarads using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser apparatus. The cells were then transferred to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 medium and cultured. Cells were harvested 40–60 h after transfection. VAChT expression was determined by Western blot analysis. For transient transfection of CHO cells, 2 μg of plasmid DNA was incubated with 8 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 200 μl of Opti-MEM media (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 15 min at room temperature. 800 μl of Opti-MEM media was then added and the lipid-DNA complex was transferred to 1 × 105 cells grown on a coated coverslip in a 6-well plate. The cells were incubated with the LipofectAMINE/plasmid mixture for 4 h. After washing the cells with 3 ml of PBS, 3 ml of media was added and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. Following this time period cells were used for immunofluorescence studies. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on subcloned regions of the VAChT cDNA using either the “Quick Site” mutagenesis kit from Stratagene employing Pfu DNA polymerase or according to the method of Kunkel (19.Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar) using theEscherichia coli strain BD2399 to prepare single-stranded uracil containing DNA. The mutagenized DNA fragments were subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) containing the wild-type rVAChT cDNA using EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites. The dideoxy sequencing method (20.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 74: 5463-5467Crossref Scopus (52674) Google Scholar) was used to verify mutations. PC12A123.7 cells, PC12A123.7 cells transiently expressing rVAChT mutants, or PC12A123.7/VAChT cells were cultured in phosphate-free medium (ICN) for 1 h. After washing with TBS (150 mmNaCl in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), cells were metabolically labeled with 0.5 mCi/ml [32P]inorganic phosphate (H3PO4) (ICN) in 4 ml of phosphate-free medium. After labeling for 2 h, cells were rinsed with TBS, detached by scraping with a rubber policeman into lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA) containing 50 mm sodium fluoride, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, and a protein inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Sodium vanadate and protein inhibitor mixture were added fresh before use. After incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, the cell debris and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Radiolabeled VAChT was isolated by immunoprecipitation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For immunoprecipitation of VAChT the supernatant of a cell lysate was first precleared by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C with protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) containing 25 μl of rabbit serum. Following centrifugation, the cleared cell lysate was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with a rabbit anti-rVAChT antisera (21.Gilmor M.L. Nash N.R. Roghani A. Edwards R.H. Yi H. Hersch S.M. Levey A.I. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2179-2190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at a dilution of 1:500, and precipitated by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C with 30 μl of prewashed protein G-Sepharose. The precipitate was washed two times in lysis buffer and once in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The washed precipitate was resuspended in 30 μl of SDS sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol, 100 mmdithiothreitol), and subjected to electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Following electrophoresis the gel was dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Kodak). For Western blot analysis, the dried gels were rehydrated in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 30 min and the proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The membrane was blocked for 1 h in TBS-T (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 135 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 10% non-fat dry milk, washed three times with TBS-T, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a goat anti-VAChT polyclonal antibody (Chemicon International) at a dilution of 1:500 in TBS-T containing 5% nonfat dry milk. Following removal of the primary antibody and washing, a peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-goat IgG (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:4,000 in 5% nonfat dry milk was added. Following incubation for 1 h at room temperature and washing, immune complexes were visualized by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on x-ray film. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed as described (22.Sefton B. Curr. Prot. Mol. Biol. 1997; 40: 18.3.1-18.3.8Google Scholar) with minor modification. Briefly, extracts prepared from PC12A123.7/VAChT cells metabolically labeled with [32P]inorganic phosphate were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-rVAChT antisera as described above. Immunoprecipitated VAChT was separated by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The radiolabeled VAChT band was excised from the gel and rehydrated in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, and eluted overnight in 0.2% SDS, 2% β-mercaptoethanol. The eluate was then precipitated with 20% trichloroacetic acid and hydrolyzed in 6m HCl for 2 h at 110 °C. The hydrolysates were evaporated on a Speed-vac, resuspended in a mixture of phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine at a final concentration of 0.3 μg/ml each, and spotted onto a thin-layer cellulose plate (Merck). Electrophoresis was performed for 20 min at 1.5 kV using pH 1.9 buffer (0.58 m formic acid, 1.36 m glacial acetic acid) for the first dimension and for 16 min at 1.3 kV using pH 3.5 buffer (0.87 m glacial acetic acid, 0.5% pyridine) for the second dimension. After drying the plates, standards were stained with ninhydrin and the plates were exposed to a PhosphorImager screen. Postnuclear supernatants were isolated by differential centrifugation as described previously (18.Kim M.-H. Lu M. Lim E.-J. Chai Y.-G. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 673-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell pellets were harvested by centrifugation and suspended in 10 mmHEPES-KOH buffer (pH 7.4), 0.32 m sucrose, 5 mmEGTA (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 4% of protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). Cells were disrupted at 4 °C with a Potter-Elvejham homogenizer, and the postnuclear supernatant collected by centrifugation at 800 ×g for 10 min. Protein concentration was measured with the Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent based on the Bradford method (Pierce). Synaptic vesicles were isolated from postnuclear supernatants by centrifugation for 6 h at 30,000 rpm in an SW40 rotor in a Beckman LE-80 centrifuge at 4 °C through a 0.6–1.6 mlinear sucrose gradient (18.Kim M.-H. Lu M. Lim E.-J. Chai Y.-G. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 673-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The postnuclear supernatant from PC12A123.7/rVAChT or control PC12 cells was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was carefully removed without disturbing the pellet. The pellet was then washed three times with kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol) and resuspended into kinase buffer. The resuspended pellet (10 μg) was preincubated for 20 min at 30 °C with 7 nm protein kinase A inhibitor (H-Thr-Thr-Tyr-Ala-Asp-Phe-Ile-Ala-Ser-Gly-Arg-Thr-Gly-Arg-Arg-Asn-Ala-Ile-His-Asp-OH), 45 μm protein kinase C inhibitor (H-Arg-Phe-Ala-Arg-Lys-Gly-Ala-Leu-Arg-Gln-Lys-Asn-Val-His-Glu-Val-Lys-Asn-OH), or 18 μm casein kinase II inhibitor (5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole). To the reaction mixture was added 400 μm[γ-32P]ATP (specific radioactivity = 500 μCi/μmol), and incubation was continued for 20 min at 30 °C. Radiolabeled VAChT was immunoprecipitated as described above, subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by electrophoretic transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride paper, and autoradiography. Protein kinase inhibitors were obtained from Calbiochem. Protein kinase C activity and calcium kinase II activity were measured with 10 μg of postnuclear supernatant protein from PC12A123.7 cells. Assays involved measurement of the incorporation of32P-label from 0.1 mm[γ-32P]ATP (specific radioactivity = 200 cpm/pmol) in reaction mixtures containing kinase buffer and 20 μmpeptide substrate. For measurement of protein kinase C activity the specific peptide substrate H-Pro-Leu-Ser-Arg-Thr-Leu-Ser-Val-Ala-Ala-Lys-Lys-OH was used while for measurement of casein kinase II activity the specific peptide substrate H-Arg-Arg-Arg-Ala-Asp-Asp-Ser-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-OH was used. Reactions were terminated by addition of 50 μl of 7.5 mmphosphoric acid, and an aliquot was spotted onto a P81 filter (Whatman) and washed 5 times in 75 mm phosphoric acid with vigorous shaking. 32P incorporation was determined by scintillation counting. ACh transport into synaptic vesicles was determined by a modification of the procedure of Varoqui and Erickson (23.Varoqui H. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27229-27232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) as described in Kim et al. (18.Kim M.-H. Lu M. Lim E.-J. Chai Y.-G. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 673-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, ACh transport was measured with 500 μg of a postnuclear supernatant containing synaptic vesicles using a tartrate/HEPES/ascorbate buffer (110 mm potassium tartrate, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 1 mm ascorbic acid), 5 mmMg2+-ATP, and [3H]ACh (40–50 mCi/mmol, NEN Life Science Products Inc.) at the desired concentration. Reactions (200 μl) were allowed to proceed at 37 °C for the desired time period. The reaction was terminated by collecting and washing the synaptic vesicles on a pre-wetted HAWP membrane (Millipore) using a vacuum manifold. Vesicular ACh was determined by scintillation counting. To determine nonspecific binding assays were conducted in the absence of ATP and in the presence of 4 μm vesamicol at 0 °C. No ACh transport was observed with the postnuclear supernatant from PC12A123.7 cells. Postnuclear supernatants containing 200 μg of protein were prepared in the tartrate/HEPES/ascorbate buffer and mixed with 20 nmol of [3H]vesamicol (31 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products Inc.). Following incubation for 10 min at 37 °C, the synaptic vesicles were collected as described above and bound vesamicol was determined by scintillation counting. PC12A123.7/VAChTcells, pretreated with 50 ng/ml nerve growth factor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 4 days, were grown on 5 μg/ml laminin (Sigma)-coated glass coverslips. After fixing the cells for 20 min at room temperature in a solution containing 3% formaldehyde, 490 μm MgCl2, 410 μmMgSO4, and 1.26 mm CaCl2 in PBS, they were washed three times with 2 ml of PBS. Free aldehyde was quenched with 2 ml of 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and washed with PBS. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 4 min at room temperature and washed with a blocking buffer (5% calf serum, 5% horse serum in PBS) for 20 min at room temperature. Staining was performed using a goat anti-VAChT polyclonal antiserum diluted 1:800 or mouse anti-synaptophysin monoclonal antibody (Sigma) diluted 1:200 in blocking buffer. Primary antibodies were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. After three washes in 2 ml of blocking buffer, cells were incubated with fluorescein-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG antibodies (Vector Laboratories Inc.) diluted 1:250 and Texas Red-conjugated horse anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Vector Labs) diluted 1:200 in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed three times in blocking buffer, rinsed three times in PBS, and the coverslips were mounted with 6 μl of vectashield (Vector Labs) and applied for fluorescence microscopy. To investigate whether the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (rVAChT) can be phosphorylated, we utilized a PC12 cell line, PC12A123.7 which expresses a mutant regulatory subunit of PKA and thus exhibits low levels of PKA I and PKA II enzymatic activity (16.Ginty D.D. Glowacka D. DeFranco C. Wagner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15325-15333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PC12A123.7 has been shown to express low levels of VAChT and ChAT mRNA and VAChT and ChAT protein (17.Shimojo M. Wu D. Hersh L.B. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1118-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 24.Inoue H. Li Y.-P. Wagner J.A. Hersh L.B. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 985-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This PC12A123.7 cell line produces small synaptic vesicles containing synaptophysin (P38), and as described previously, these vesicles can be reconstituted with recombinant VAChT (18.Kim M.-H. Lu M. Lim E.-J. Chai Y.-G. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 673-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We established a stably transfected PC12A123.7 cell line expressing recombinant rat VAChT, PC12A123.7/rVAChT. 2M.-H. Kim, B. Wolfe, S. Parsons, R. Gandour, M. Lu, and L. B. Hersh, manuscript in preparation. As shown in Fig. 1, VAChT expression in PC12A123.7/rVAChT exhibits a punctate staining pattern which is predominantly co-localized with the synaptic vesicle marker α-synaptophysin. Synaptic vesicles isolated from PC12A123.7 expressing recombinant rVAChT transport ACh and bind the specific VAChT inhibitor vesamicol (18.Kim M.-H. Lu M. Lim E.-J. Chai Y.-G. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 673-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These findings provide evidence that recombinant rVAChT is expressed on synaptic vesicles in the PC12A123.7 cell line. Similar results have been obtained with wild type PC12 cells transfected with recombinant VAChT (4.Varoqui H. Erickson J.D. Mol. Neurobiol. 1997; 15: 165-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Varoqui H. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9094-9098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To determine whether rVAChT is phosphorylated in neuroendocrine cells, we metabolically labeled PC12A123.7/rVAChT with [32P]inorganic phosphate. Following metabolic labeling, cells were disrupted and VAChT immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal rabbit anti-VAChT antisera. The immunoprecipitate was subjected to SDS-PAGE, dried, and analyzed by radioautography. As shown in Fig.2A, lane 2, a 70-kDa phospho-protein was observed. Applying the same protocol to the parental PC12A123.7 cell line which does not express detectable VAChT, no phosphorylated protein at 75 kDa was observed, Fig. 2 A, lane 1. The gel was rehydrated, proteins were then electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride paper, and submitted to Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2 B, lane 2, the phosphorylated protein at 70 kDa reacted with a goat anti-VAChT antiserum different from the one used for immunoprecipitation. No band was detected with the parental cell line, Fig. 2 B, lane 1. Although not shown phosphorylation of recombinant VAChT was also observed with wild type PC12 cells expressing recombinant VAChT, and as noted below cytosolic extracts from wild type VAChT can phosphorylate recombinant VAChT on vesicles derived from PC12A123.7/rVAChT. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the phosphorylated VAChT was performed to identify the nature of the phosphorylated residue. PC12A123.7/rVAChT was metabolically labeled with [32P]inorganic phosphate and VAChT immunoprecipitated as described above. The immunoprecipitated VAChT was purified by electrophoresis through a polyacrylamide gel, localized by autoradiography, excised from the gel, eluted, and hydrolyzed in 6m HCl at 110 °C. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the hydrolysate by two-dimensional electrophoresis on cellulose thin layer chromatography plates showed phosphorylation of serine, but not threonine or tyrosine, Fig. 3. Thus, the phosphorylation of rVAChT in intact cells occurs on one or more serine residues. The cDNA sequence of rVAChT predicts a protein of 530 amino acids with 12 transmembrane domains (13.Roghani A. Feldman J. Kohan S.A. Shirzadi A. Gundersen C.B. Brecha N. Edwards R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10620-10624Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), related in structure to the vesicular monoamine transporters VMAT1 (25.Erickson J.D. Eiden L.E. Hoffman B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10993-10997Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) and VMAT2 (26.Liu Y. Peter D. Roghani A. Schuldiner S. Prive G.G. Eisenberg D. Brecha N. Edwards R.H. Cell. 1992; 70: 539-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of VMAT2 has been observed on its COOH-terminal cytoplasmic tail (15.Krantz D.E. Peter D. Liu Y. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6752-6759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), thus this domain represents a potential phosphorylation site of VAChT. The COOH-terminal cytoplasmic tail of rat VAChT contains five serine residues, Fig.4. Of these, serine 478 and serine 480 represent consensus casein kinase II sites, while serine 480 is also a consensus protein kinase C site (27.Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). These potential phosphorylation sites are highly conserved in all mammalian VAChTs obtained so far (Fig. 4). In order to determine whether any of the five serines on the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic tail represent a VAChT phosphorylation site, we used site-directed mutagenesis to replace each with an alanine residue. The rVAChT cDNAs containing these point mutations were expressed in PC12A123.7 cells by transient transfection and metabolically labeled with [32P]inorganic phosphate. VAChT was immunoprecipitated, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the32P content determined by radioautography. As shown in Fig.5, replacement of serine 478 with alanine (lane 2) had no effect on VAChT phosphorylation. However, replacement of serine 480 with alanine (lane 3), or the double mutant in which both serine 478 and serine 480 were replaced with alanine (lane 4), completely eliminated VAChT phosphorylation. To prove that the lack of VAChT phosphorylation with S480A and the S478/S480A double mutant was not due to a reduced expression of the mutant proteins, we performed Western blot analysis on the immunoprecipitated proteins. This analysis showed that each mutant VAChT was expressed to the same level as the wild type protein (Fig. 5). Although not shown, the ability to phosphorylate VAChT mutants S512A, S528A, and S530A was unaffected by conversion of the appropriate serine to alanine. These results indicate that only the serine at position 480 of VAChT undergoes phosphorylation within the intact PC12 cell.Figure 5VAChT is phosphorylated on serine 480.PC12A123.7 cells transiently transfected with a cDNA encoding the wild type (wild) VAChT protein (lane 1), or with the cDNA of mutants S478A (lane 2), S480A (lane 3), S478A/S480A (lane 4), or with no plasmid (lane 5). Transformants were metabolically labeled with [32P]Pi, immunoprecipitated with anti-rVAChT antisera, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (upper panel). The gel was rehydrated and used for Western blot analysis (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assess which kinase is involved in rVAChT phosphorylation, we measured phosphorylation of the transporter in a postnuclear supernatant fraction of PC12A123.7/rVAChT cells in which VAChT is present on synaptic vesicles. The cytosolic fraction from PC12A123.7 cells was used as a source of kinase activity. We tested the effect on VAChT phosphorylation of the protein kinase A inhibitor peptide (H-Thr-Thr-Tyr-Ala-Asp-Phe-Ile-Ala-Ser-Gly-Arg-Thr-Gly-Arg-Arg-Asn-Ala-Ile-His-Asp-OH) at 7 nm (K i = 2.3 nm) (28.Knighton D.R.

https://openalex.org/W1995654085,"We have examined the role of CrkII in the cellular response to both human growth hormone (hGH) and human insulin-like growth factor-1 (hIGF-1). We have demonstrated that overexpression of the adaptor molecule enhances both basal phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity and also dramatically enhances the ability of both hormones to stimulate PI 3-kinase activity in the cell. Many of the effects of CrkII overexpression on hGH- and hIGF-1-stimulated cellular function can then be attributed to CrkII enhancement of PI 3-kinase stimulation by these hormones. Thus, CrkII-enhanced PI 3-kinase activity is used to enhance actin filament reorganization in response to both hGH and hIGF-1, to enhance stress activated protein kinase (SAPK) activity in response to hGH, and to diminish STAT5-mediated transcription in response to hGH. It is apparent, however, that CrkII also regulates cellular function independent of its ability to stimulate PI 3-kinase activity. This is evidenced by the ability of CrkII, in a PI 3-kinase-independent manner, to diminish the activation of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase in response to both hGH and hIGF-1 and to inhibit the activation of SAPK by hIGF-1. Therefore, despite the common use of CrkII to activate PI 3-kinase, CrkII also allows hGH or hIGF-1 to selectively switch the activation of SAPK. Thus, common utilization of CrkII by hGH and hIGF-1 allows the execution of common cellular effects of these hormones, concomitant with the retention of hormonal specificity. We have examined the role of CrkII in the cellular response to both human growth hormone (hGH) and human insulin-like growth factor-1 (hIGF-1). We have demonstrated that overexpression of the adaptor molecule enhances both basal phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity and also dramatically enhances the ability of both hormones to stimulate PI 3-kinase activity in the cell. Many of the effects of CrkII overexpression on hGH- and hIGF-1-stimulated cellular function can then be attributed to CrkII enhancement of PI 3-kinase stimulation by these hormones. Thus, CrkII-enhanced PI 3-kinase activity is used to enhance actin filament reorganization in response to both hGH and hIGF-1, to enhance stress activated protein kinase (SAPK) activity in response to hGH, and to diminish STAT5-mediated transcription in response to hGH. It is apparent, however, that CrkII also regulates cellular function independent of its ability to stimulate PI 3-kinase activity. This is evidenced by the ability of CrkII, in a PI 3-kinase-independent manner, to diminish the activation of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase in response to both hGH and hIGF-1 and to inhibit the activation of SAPK by hIGF-1. Therefore, despite the common use of CrkII to activate PI 3-kinase, CrkII also allows hGH or hIGF-1 to selectively switch the activation of SAPK. Thus, common utilization of CrkII by hGH and hIGF-1 allows the execution of common cellular effects of these hormones, concomitant with the retention of hormonal specificity. growth hormone human growth hormone insulin-like growth factor-1 human IGF-1 focal adhesion kinase phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate fluorescein isothiocyanate phosphate-buffered saline mitogen-activated protein stress-activated protein kinase chloramphenicol acetyltransferase phosphatidylinositol signal transducer and activator of transcription Growth hormone (GH)1 is the major regulator of postnatal somatic growth (1.Isaksson O.G.P. Eden S. Jansson J.O. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 433-489Crossref Google Scholar). The anabolic and growth-promoting effects of GH are largely thought to be mediated via stimulation of insulin-like growth factor-1 expression in hepatic and extrahepatic tissues (2.Butler A.A.

Although it is now apparent that GH may act independently of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), the two hormones possess multiple common effects on cellular function. The GH receptor is a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily and therefore mediates tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins by its association with the JAK family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (3.Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Smit L.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 187-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In contrast, the IGF-1 receptor is a receptor tyrosine kinase, and ligand stimulation results in direct phosphorylation of signaling molecules by the receptor itself. Despite the difference in which the hormones initiate signal transduction, there exists a common utilization of multiple signal-transducing molecules such as FAK, CrkII, p130 cas, IRS-1, IRS-2, p44/42 MAP kinase, and PI 3-kinase, which may provide the basis for the shared cellular function (4.Zhu T.

CrkII is a member of a family of adaptor proteins predominantly composed of Src homology 2 and 3 domains whose role in signaling pathways is presently unclear, although it has been implicated in various cellular functions such as cytoskeletal reorganization and mitogenesis (11.Klemke R.L.

Similarly, the structure of p130 cas suggests that it is a docking protein with a role in multiprotein signaling complexes (13.Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Other components of the hGH-stimulated complex include c-Src, c-Fyn, c-Cbl, Nck, FAK, paxillin, IRS-1, C3G, SHC, Grb-2, and Sos-1 (6.Zhu T. Goh E.L.K. LeRoith D. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33864-33875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Here we have examined the role of CrkII in the cellular responses to both GH and IGF-1 and demonstrate that the adaptor molecule acts as both a point of convergence and divergence in their cellular effects. It appears that many of the effects of CrkII on the cellular functions of hGH and hIGF-1 lie with its ability to dramatically enhance PI 3-kinase activity stimulated by these hormones. Despite the common use of CrkII to activate PI 3-kinase, CrkII also allows these hormones to selectively switch the activation of SAPK. Thus, common utilization of CrkII by hGH and hIGF-1 allows the execution of the common cellular effects of these hormones, concomitant with the retention of hormonal specificity.DISCUSSIONWe have demonstrated here that the CrkII adaptor molecule regulates various hGH and hIGF-1 signaling pathways. We have identified CrkII as a powerful positive regulator of PI 3-kinase activity stimulated by both hGH and hIGF-1. The mechanism by which CrkII regulates PI 3-kinase activity is not clear, although we have previously demonstrated that both CrkII and the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase co-exist in a multiprotein signaling complex stimulated by hGH (6.Zhu T. Goh E.L.K. LeRoith D. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33864-33875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Other components of this complex include p130 cas, c-Src, c-Fyn, c-Cbl, Nck, FAK, paxillin, IRS-1, C3G, SHC, Grb-2, and Sos-1. One possibility is that CrkII simply acts as an adaptor molecule to facilitate the interactions between components of the hGH-stimulated complex regulating PI 3-kinase activity. In this regard, it is interesting that c-Fyn has been reported to phosphorylate tyrosine 731 of c-Cbl, which is required for the binding of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase to c-Cbl (21.Hunter S. Burton E.A. Wu S.C. Anderson S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2097-2106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Similarly, IRS-1 has been reported to be a substrate for FAK, and FAK overexpression has been reported to increase IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and the association between IRS-1 and the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase (22.Lebrun P. Mothe-Satney I. Delahaye L. Van Obberghen E. Baron V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32244-32253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Activation of PI 3-kinase by the related hormone prolactin has been demonstrated to require c-Fyn (23.al-Sakkaf K.A. Dobson P.R. Brown B.L. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 19: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), although c-Fyn and the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase may associate directly (24.Mak P. He Z. Kurosaki T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 183-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase has also been reported to associate with FAK either directly or indirectly, and FAK has been demonstrated to phosphorylate p85 in vitro (25.Chen H.C. Appeddu P.A. Isoda H. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26329-26334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). In any case, the majority of the effects of CrkII overexpression on hGH- and hIGF-1-stimulated cellular function can be attributed to CrkII enhancement of PI 3-kinase stimulation by these hormones. It is apparent, however, that CrkII also regulates cellular function independent of its ability to stimulate PI 3-kinase activity as evidenced by the ability of CrkII to diminish the activation of p44/42 MAP kinase in response to both hGH and hIGF-1 in a PI 3-kinase-independent manner.We have previously demonstrated that actin cytoskeletal reorganization stimulated by both hGH and hIGF-1 is PI 3- kinase-dependent (18.Goh E.L.K. Pircher T.J. Wood T.J.J. Norstedt G. Graichen R. Lobie P.E. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3207-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, CrkII-enhanced stimulation of PI 3-kinase activity by both hormones resulted in increased formation of membrane ruffles in these cells (this study); since the effect of CrkII overexpression on cytoskeletal reorganization could be inhibited with PI 3-kinase inhibitors. These results are in agreement with a recent report in which microinjection of CrkII antibody into cells prevented membrane ruffle formation induced by IGF-1 (12.Nakashima N. Rose D.W. Xiao S. Egawa K. Martin S.S. Haruta T. Saltiel A.R. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3001-3008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). CrkII overexpression in fibroblasts has also been demonstrated to enhance p130 cas phosphorylation and Rac-dependent cell migration (11.Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molamder R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), and the formation of a p130 cas -CrkII complex has been demonstrated to be sufficient for cell migration. We have also demonstrated that CrkII possessed the appropriate spatial distribution within the cell to mediate membrane ruffle formation, with both CrkII and the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase localized to the membrane ruffles. It has also been previously demonstrated that CrkII is localized to the membrane ruffles of cells induced by attachment of the cells to vitronectin matrix or upon insulin treatment (11.Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molamder R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The association and functional interactions between PI 3-kinase and the mediators of actin rearrangements, the small GTPases Rho and Rac, is well established (26.Keely P.J. Westwick J.K. Whitehead I.P. Der C.J. Parise L.V. Nature. 1997; 11: 632-636Crossref Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Recently, CrkII has been shown to regulate the Rho signaling pathway (11.Klemke R.L. Leng J.

In addition, DOCK180, a CrkII Src homology 3-binding protein, was shown to participate in the activation of Rac1 in integrin signaling (34.Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kobayashi S. Sugimura H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3331-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar).We have demonstrated here that overexpression of CrkII enhances the ability of hGH to stimulate SAPK activity as previously published (6.Zhu T. Goh E.L.K. LeRoith D. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33864-33875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and in accord with the demonstration that a CrkII-C3G complex activates SAPK through a pathway involving the mixed lineage kinase family of proteins (35.Tanaka S. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1281-1284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, we observe that CrkII overexpression diminishes the hGH stimulation of p44/42 MAP kinase activity. We have previously reported that C3G is present in the hGH-stimulated multiprotein signaling complex centered around CrkII, and we have also observed hGH-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of C3G. 2T. Zhu and P. E. Lobie, unpublished observations. C3G appears to function as a specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rap1 (36.Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), and membrane targeting of Crk enhances the Rap1 guanine nucleotide exchange activity of C3G (37.Ichiba T. Kuraishi Y. Sakai O. Nagata S. Groffen J. Kurata T. Hattori S. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22215-22220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It has been reported that insulin stimulation of cells results in a rapid disassociation of the CrkII-C3G complex (38.Okada S. Matsuda M. Anafi M. Pawson T. Pessin J.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2554-2565Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) with subsequent inhibition of the Rap1-Raf1 interaction. These authors postulate that uncoupling of the CrkII-C3G complex by insulin de-represses Rap1 function, thereby releasing Raf1 for activation by Ras, with resultant MEK activation (38.Okada S. Matsuda M. Anafi M. Pawson T. Pessin J.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2554-2565Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In contrast, since CrkII overexpression inhibited hGH stimulation of p44/42 MAP kinase, hGH stimulation of cells would be expected to activate Rap1 in a CrkII-dependent manner, and this is indeed what we find. 3T. Zhu, and P. E. Lobie, manuscript in preparation. The effect of hIGF-1 on the CrkII-C3G complex has not been reported, but it should not be expected to be similar to insulin, since IGF-1 and insulin differentially regulate CrkII-associated proteins. One example is that insulin stimulates the dephosphorylation of p130 cas, whereas cellular stimulation with IGF-1 results in increased p130 cas phosphorylation (7.Sorokin A. Reed E. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). One difference that has been reported for hGH and hIGF-1 is that hGH stimulates the association between CrkII and IRS-1 (6.Zhu T. Goh E.L.K. LeRoith D. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33864-33875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), whereas IGF-1 stimulates the disassociation between CrkII and IRS-1 (39.Beitner-Johnson D. Blakesley V.A. Shen-Orr Z. Jimenez M. Stannard B. Wang L.M. Pierce J. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9287-9290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In any case, although both hGH and IGF-1 stimulate the phosphorylation of CrkII, it is differentially utilized for regulation of SAPK but not p44/42 MAP kinase activities. Further studies are required to identify the mechanisms involved in the selective activation of p44/42 MAP kinase or SAPK by these hormones.We have demonstrated in this paper that overexpression of CrkII diminishes hGH stimulation of STAT5-mediated transcription in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner without alteration of hGH-stimulated STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation. This suggests that CrkII regulation of STAT5 transcription occurs distally. It has been demonstrated that type I interferons induced the formation of a CrkL-STAT5 complex that translocates to the nucleus, and CrkL, in this case, modulates STAT5-mediated transcription directly at the level of DNA binding (40.Fish E.N. Uddin S. Korkmaz M. Majchrzak B. Druker B.J. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 571-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). A similar direct association between phosphorylated STAT5 and CrkL has been demonstrated upon stimulation of the EPO receptor (41.Ota J. Kimura F. Sato K. Wakimoto N. Nakamura Y. Nagata N. Suzu S. Yamada M. Shimamura S. Motoyoshi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that CrkII also associates with phosphorylated STAT5 and prevents its binding to DNA and therefore transcriptional activation. It is interesting that c-Cbl, which is also found in the multiprotein signaling complex stimulated by hGH, decreases hGH stimulated STAT5-mediated transcription by inhibition of STAT5 phosphorylation. 4E. L. K. Goh, T. Zhu, and P. E. Lobie, unpublished observations. Thus, two adaptor molecules present in the hGH stimulated multiprotein complex act to inhibit STAT5-mediated transcription at either proximal or distal points in the signal transduction pathway. At the present time, it is not clear why CrkII inhibition of STAT5-mediated transcription is PI 3-kinase-dependent. It is interesting to note that the activation of phospholipase C is PI 3-kinase dependent and pharmacological inhibition of phospholipase C also increases GH-stimulated STAT5-mediated transcription (42.Fernandez L. Flores-Morales A. Lahuna O. Sliva D. Norstedt G. Haldosen L.A. Mode A. Gustafsson J.A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1815-1824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by maintaining the activation (or delaying the deactivation) of STAT5. It remains to be determined how PI 3-kinase negatively regulates STAT5-mediated transcription.In conclusion, we have examined the role of CrkII in the cellular response to both GH and IGF-1 and demonstrate that the adaptor molecule acts as both a point of convergence and divergence in their cellular effects. It appears that many of the effects of CrkII on the cellular function of hGH and hIGF-1 lie with its ability to dramatically enhance PI 3-kinase activity stimulated by these hormones. Despite the common use of CrkII to activate PI 3-kinase, CrkII also allows these hormones to selectively switch the activation of SAPK. Thus, common utilization of CrkII by hGH and hIGF-1 allows the execution of the common cellular effects of these hormones, concomitant with the retention of hormonal specificity. Growth hormone (GH)1 is the major regulator of postnatal somatic growth (1.Isaksson O.G.P. Eden S. Jansson J.O. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 433-489Crossref Google Scholar). The anabolic and growth-promoting effects of GH are largely thought to be mediated via stimulation of insulin-like growth factor-1 expression in hepatic and extrahepatic tissues (2.Butler A.A.

The p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase has also been reported to associate with FAK either directly or indirectly, and FAK has been demonstrated to phosphorylate p85 in vitro (25.Chen H.C. Appeddu P.A. Isoda H. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26329-26334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). In any case, the majority of the effects of CrkII overexpression on hGH- and hIGF-1-stimulated cellular function can be attributed to CrkII enhancement of PI 3-kinase stimulation by these hormones. It is apparent, however, that CrkII also regulates cellular function independent of its ability to stimulate PI 3-kinase activity as evidenced by the ability of CrkII to diminish the activation of p44/42 MAP kinase in response to both hGH and hIGF-1 in a PI 3-kinase-independent manner.We have previously demonstrated that actin cytoskeletal reorganization stimulated by both hGH and hIGF-1 is PI 3- kinase-dependent (18.Goh E.L.K. Pircher T.J. Wood T.J.J. Norstedt G. Graichen R. Lobie P.E. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3207-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, CrkII-enhanced stimulation of PI 3-kinase activity by both hormones resulted in increased formation of membrane ruffles in these cells (this study); since the effect of CrkII overexpression on cytoskeletal reorganization could be inhibited with PI 3-kinase inhibitors. These results are in agreement with a recent report in which microinjection of CrkII antibody into cells prevented membrane ruffle formation induced by IGF-1 (12.Nakashima N. Rose D.W. Xiao S.

CrkII overexpression in fibroblasts has also been demonstrated to enhance p130 cas phosphorylation and Rac-dependent cell migration (11.Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molamder R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), and the formation of a p130 cas -CrkII complex has been demonstrated to be sufficient for cell migration. We have also demonstrated that CrkII possessed the appropriate spatial distribution within the cell to mediate membrane ruffle formation, with both CrkII and the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase localized to the membrane ruffles. It has also been previously demonstrated that CrkII is localized to the membrane ruffles of cells induced by attachment of the cells to vitronectin matrix or upon insulin treatment (11.Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molamder R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The association and functional interactions between PI 3-kinase and the mediators of actin rearrangements, the small GTPases Rho and Rac, is well established (26.Keely P.J. Westwick J.K.

In addition, DOCK180, a CrkII Src homology 3-binding protein, was shown to participate in the activation of Rac1 in integrin signaling (34.Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kobayashi S. Sugimura H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3331-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar).We have demonstrated here that overexpression of CrkII enhances the ability of hGH to stimulate SAPK activity as previously published (6.Zhu T.

Chem. 1998; 273: 33864-33875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and in accord with the demonstration that a CrkII-C3G complex activates SAPK through a pathway involving the mixed lineage kinase family of proteins (35.Tanaka S. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1281-1284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, we observe that CrkII overexpression diminishes the hGH stimulation of p44/42 MAP kinase activity. We have previously reported that C3G is present in the hGH-stimulated multiprotein signaling complex centered around CrkII, and we have also observed hGH-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of C3G. 2T. Zhu and P. E. Lobie, unpublished observations. C3G appears to function as a specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rap1 (36.Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), and membrane targeting of Crk enhances the Rap1 guanine nucleotide exchange activity of C3G (37.Ichiba T. Kuraishi Y. Sakai O. Nagata S. Groffen J. Kurata T. Hattori S. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22215-22220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It has been reported that insulin stimulation of cells results in a rapid disassociation of the CrkII-C3G complex (38.Okada S. Matsuda M. Anafi M. Pawson T. Pessin J.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2554-2565Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) with subsequent inhibition of the Rap1-Raf1 interaction. These authors postulate that uncoupling of the CrkII-C3G complex by insulin de-represses Rap1 function, thereby releasing Raf1 for activation by Ras, with resultant MEK activation (38.Okada S. Matsuda M. Anafi M. Pawson T. Pessin J.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2554-2565Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In contrast, since CrkII overexpression inhibited hGH stimulation of p44/42 MAP kinase, hGH stimulation of cells would be expected to activate Rap1 in a CrkII-dependent manner, and this is indeed what we find. 3T. Zhu, and P. E. Lobie, manuscript in preparation. The effect of hIGF-1 on the CrkII-C3G complex has not been reported, but it should not be expected to be similar to insulin, since IGF-1 and insulin differentially regulate CrkII-associated proteins. One example is that insulin stimulates the dephosphorylation of p130 cas, whereas cellular stimulation with IGF-1 results in increased p130 cas phosphorylation (7.Sorokin A. Reed E. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). One difference that has been reported for hGH and hIGF-1 is that hGH stimulates the association between CrkII and IRS-1 (6.Zhu T. Goh E.L.K. LeRoith D. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33864-33875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), whereas IGF-1 stimulates the disassociation between CrkII and IRS-1 (39.Beitner-Johnson D. Blakesley V.A. Shen-Orr Z. Jimenez M. Stannard B. Wang L.M. Pierce J. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9287-9290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In any case, although both hGH and IGF-1 stimulate the phosphorylation of CrkII, it is differentially utilized for regulation of SAPK but not p44/42 MAP kinase activities. Further studies are required to identify the mechanisms involved in the selective activation of p44/42 MAP kinase or SAPK by these hormones.We have demonstrated in this paper that overexpression of CrkII diminishes hGH stimulation of STAT5-mediated transcription in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner without alteration of hGH-stimulated STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation. This suggests that CrkII regulation of STAT5 transcription occurs distally. It has been demonstrated that type I interferons induced the formation of a CrkL-STAT5 complex that translocates to the nucleus, and CrkL, in this case, modulates STAT5-mediated transcription directly at the level of DNA binding (40.Fish E.N. Uddin S. Korkmaz M. Majchrzak B. Druker B.J. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 571-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). A similar direct association between phosphorylated STAT5 and CrkL has been demonstrated upon stimulation of the EPO receptor (41.Ota J. Kimura F. Sato K. Wakimoto N. Nakamura Y. Nagata N. Suzu S. Yamada M. Shimamura S. Motoyoshi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that CrkII also associates with phosphorylated STAT5 and prevents its binding to DNA and therefore transcriptional activation. It is interesting that c-Cbl, which is also found in the multiprotein signaling complex stimulated by hGH, decreases hGH stimulated STAT5-mediated transcription by inhibition of STAT5 phosphorylation. 4E. L. K. Goh, T. Zhu, and P. E. Lobie, unpublished observations. Thus, two adaptor molecules present in the hGH stimulated multiprotein complex act to inhibit STAT5-mediated transcription at either proximal or distal points in the signal transduction pathway. At the present time, it is not clear why CrkII inhibition of STAT5-mediated transcription is PI 3-kinase-dependent. It is interesting to note that the activation of phospholipase C is PI 3-kinase dependent and pharmacological inhibition of phospholipase C also increases GH-stimulated STAT5-mediated transcription (42.Fernandez L. Flores-Morales A. Lahuna O. Sliva D. Norstedt G. Haldosen L.A. Mode A. Gustafsson J.A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1815-1824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by maintaining the activation (or delaying the deactivation) of STAT5. It remains to be determined how PI 3-kinase negatively regulates STAT5-mediated transcription.In conclusion, we have examined the role of CrkII in the cellular response to both GH and IGF-1 and demonstrate that the adaptor molecule acts as both a point of convergence and divergence in their cellular effects. It appears that many of the effects of CrkII on the cellular function of hGH and hIGF-1 lie with its ability to dramatically enhance PI 3-kinase activity stimulated by these hormones. Despite the common use of CrkII to activate PI 3-kinase, CrkII also allows these hormones to selectively switch the activation of SAPK. Thus, common utilization of CrkII by hGH and hIGF-1 allows the execution of the common cellular effects of these hormones, concomitant with the retention of hormonal specificity. We have demonstrated here that the CrkII adaptor molecule regulates various hGH and hIGF-1 signaling pathways. We have identified CrkII as a powerful positive regulator of PI 3-kinase activity stimulated by both hGH and hIGF-1. The mechanism by which CrkII regulates PI 3-kinase activity is not clear, although we have previously demonstrated that both CrkII and the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase co-exist in a multiprotein signaling complex stimulated by hGH (6.Zhu T. Goh E.L.K. LeRoith D. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33864-33875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Other components of this complex include p130 cas, c-Src, c-Fyn, c-Cbl, Nck, FAK, paxillin, IRS-1, C3G, SHC, Grb-2, and Sos-1. One possibility is that CrkII simply acts as an adaptor molecule to facilitate the interactions between components of the hGH-stimulated complex regulating PI 3-kinase activity. In this regard, it is interesting that c-Fyn has been reported to phosphorylate tyrosine 731 of c-Cbl, which is required for the binding of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase to c-Cbl (21.Hunter S. Burton E.A. Wu S.C. Anderson S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2097-2106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Similarly, IRS-1 has been reported to be a substrate for FAK, and FAK overexpression has been reported to increase IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and the association between IRS-1 and the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase (22.Lebrun P. Mothe-Satney I. Delahaye L. Van Obberghen E. Baron V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32244-32253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Activation of PI 3-kinase by the related hormone prolactin has been demonstrated to require c-Fyn (23.al-Sakkaf K.A. Dobson P.R. Brown B.L. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 19: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), although c-Fyn and the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase may associate directly (24.Mak P. He Z. Kurosaki T.

https://openalex.org/W2005701792,"Expression of the cysteine-rich fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor (CFR) in COS-1 cells strongly inhibits the secretion of co-expressed FGF3. By using a column retention assay and affinity chromatography, we demonstrate that at physiological salt concentrations FGF3 binds with strong affinity to CFR in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, to show that FGF3 binds to CFR in vivo, truncation mutants of CFR with changed subcellular distributions were shown to cause a similar redistribution of FGF3. Although CFR is a 150-kDa integral membrane glycoprotein that is primarily located in the Golgi apparatus, we show here that in COS-1 cells a substantial proportion of CFR is secreted. This is due to a carboxyl-terminal proteolytic cleavage that releases the intraluminal portion of the protein for secretion. However, the apparent size of the integral membrane and secreted CFR appears similar, since the loss of protein mass is balanced by a gain of complex carbohydrates. The released CFR is associated with the extracellular matrix through its affinity for glycosaminoglycans. These findings show that CFR can modulate the secretion of FGF3 and may control its biological activity by regulating its secretion.

These findings show that CFR can modulate the secretion of FGF3 and may control its biological activity by regulating its secretion. fibroblast growth factor extracellular matrix cysteine-rich FGF receptor polymerase chain reaction phosphate-buffered saline fluorescein isothiocyanate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis glutathione S-transferase transforming growth factor-β Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs)1 are a family of at least 18 structurally related polypeptides that can modulate the growth, differentiation, migration, and survival of various cell types in culture (reviewed in Refs. 1.Basilico C.

Genet. & Dev. 1995; 5: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The properties of FGFs indicate they act primarily as intercellular signaling molecules, by binding to and activating receptors on the surface of the same or adjacent cells. Four high affinity FGF receptor genes (FGFR1–4) have been identified that encode transmembrane tyrosine kinases (5.Green P.J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 639-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 6.Johnson D. Williams L. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). Moreover, signal transduction requires the presentation of FGFs by a second type of receptor composed of heparan sulfate containing proteoglycan. In addition to the transmembrane signaling receptor complex, a third class of membrane-anchored FGF-binding protein has been identified as a cysteine-rich FGF receptor (CFR) (7.Burrus L.W. Zuber M.E. Lueddecke B.A. Olwin B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5600-5609Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 8.Zhou Z. Zuber M.E. Burrus L.W. Olwin B.B. J. Biol.

Olwin B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18647-18653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It subsequently emerged that the CFR is homologous to a rat protein cloned as a Golgi-specific protein designated MG-160 (10.Gonatas J.O. Mezitis S.G.E. Steiber A. Fleischer B. Gonatas N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 646-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Gonatas J.O. Mourelatos Z. Stieber A. Lane W.S. Brosius J. Gonatas N.K. J.

More recently, the human homologue of the same protein was identified as an E-selectin-binding protein (ESL-1) provided it was modified by α(1,3)-fucosylation (13.Steegmaier M. Levinovitz A.

A comparison of the derived amino acid sequences of the chicken and human homologues shows more than 90% sequence identity, demonstrating a high degree of conservation during evolution (7.Burrus L.W.

Chicken CFR and rat-MG160 were shown to localize primarily to the Golgi apparatus, and ESL-1 was described as a cell surface protein (11.Gonatas J.O. Mourelatos Z. Stieber A. Lane W.S. Brosius J. Gonatas N.K. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 457-467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Mourelatos Z. Gonatas J.O. Cinato E. Gonatas N.K.

Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 687-694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The sequence of CFR reveals 16 cysteine-rich repeats in the intraluminal domain and a short cytoplasmic tail (7.Burrus L.W. Zuber M.E. Lueddecke B.A. Olwin B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5600-5609Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 12.Mourelatos Z. Gonatas J.O. Cinato E. Gonatas N.K. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 1121-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). CFR binds FGF1, FGF2, and FGF4, and its presence has been shown to alter the levels of intracellular FGF1 and FGF2 suggesting a role in the intracellular trafficking of the FGFs (7.Burrus L.W. Zuber M.E. Lueddecke B.A. Olwin B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5600-5609Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 17.Zuber M.E. Zhou Z. Burrus L.W. Olwin B.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 170: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, the CFR shows no recognizable sequence homology to the FGF tyrosine kinase receptors, nor to the proteoglycan co-receptors. The CFR failed to bind several other growth factors tested (platelet-derived growth factor-BB, epidermal growth factor, insulin, and insulin-like growth factor-II), but forms a secreted complex with TGF-β (7.Burrus L.W. Zuber M.E. Lueddecke B.A. Olwin B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5600-5609Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 18.Olofsson A. Hellman U. Ten Dijke P.B. Ichijo S., H. Moren A. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).Previously we showed that mouse FGF3 was retained in the medial Golgi complex of COS-1 cells and only slowly released into the culture medium, raising the possibility that FGF3 export may be controlled (19.Kiefer P. Peters G. Dickson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5781-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Regulation at the level of secretion has been also described for TGF-β, and interestingly, this ligand is also retained in the Golgi complex as an inactive precursor (18.Olofsson A. Hellman U. Ten Dijke P.B. Ichijo S., H. Moren A. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 20.Miyazono K. Thyberg J. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5668-5675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The coincident intracellular localization of FGF3 and the CFR in the Golgi apparatus prompted us to investigate whether there was a functional interaction between these two proteins. We show here that FGF3 binds to the CFR and that the CFR can alter FGF3 secretion and its subcellular localization.DISCUSSIONIn this study we show that FGF3 can associate with the CFR, and this could account for its poor secretion and retention in the Golgi apparatus (19.Kiefer P. Peters G. Dickson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5781-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). CFR protein (MG160) is primarily located in the Golgi apparatus, consistent with previous reports, but we also detect a soluble form of the protein that associates with the cell surface and ECM (11.Gonatas J.O. Mourelatos Z. Stieber A. Lane W.S. Brosius J. Gonatas N.K. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 457-467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Mourelatos Z. Gonatas J.O. Cinato E. Gonatas N.K. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 1121-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16.Steegmaier M. Borges E. Berger J. Schwarz H. Vestweber D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 687-694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Zuber M.E. Zhou Z. Burrus L.W. Olwin B.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 170: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). From the size of the core protein after carbohydrate removal, the secreted CFR is cleaved at the carboxyl terminus, which removes the intra-luminal and transmembrane domain allowing the protein to be secreted. Since we could never detect extracellular or cell-associated CFR forms with a significantly higher molecular mass than 170 kDa, which might correspond to a CFR protein with a sialylated intact protein backbone, the residual bands present after treatment of CFR medium proteins with glycosidases derive most likely from partial digestion. The extracellular and soluble CFR appears to be associated with the ECM and/or cell surface through an affinity with glycosaminoglycans, since soluble heparin is efficient at competing CFR from the cell surface and ECM. CFR/MG160 appears to be homologous to ESL-1, a high affinity binding protein for E-selectin. ESL-1 was identified as a cell surface glycoprotein expressed on myeloid and some lymphoid cells (11.Gonatas J.O. Mourelatos Z. Stieber A. Lane W.S. Brosius J. Gonatas N.K. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 457-467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Mourelatos Z. Gonatas J.O. Cinato E. Gonatas N.K. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 1121-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 15.Stieber A. Mourelatos Z. Chen Y.-J. Le Douarin N. Gonatas N.K. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 562-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16.Steegmaier M. Borges E. Berger J. Schwarz H. Vestweber D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 687-694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in the light of the results presented here, it would be interesting to know whether cell surface ESL-1 is present as an integral membrane protein or associated with the cell surface by its affinity to glycosaminoglycans. Although the bulk of the intracellular CFR is Golgi complex-associated, it was also found in endosomal vesicles that were identified by co-staining with FITC-labeled dextran. Interestingly, the CFR carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants that lack either the cytoplasmic domain or both cytoplasmic and transmembrane domain showed a more pronounced staining of endosomal compartment. This suggests that the deletion mutations have weakened but not destroyed the Golgi retention and have allowed a greater amount of CFR to enter endosomes. Moreover, a spontaneous carboxyl-terminal truncation mutant of CFR which lacks the cytoplasmic, transmembrane, and juxtamembrane regions appeared to be widely distributed in the cell suggesting that the intraluminal juxtamembrane domain is important for targeting and retention of CFR to the medial Golgi (17.Zuber M.E. Zhou Z. Burrus L.W. Olwin B.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 170: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).The effect of CFR on the biological properties of FGFs remains puzzling. A recent study looking at the effect on exogenously applied FGF1 or FGF2 to Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing elevated levels of CFR demonstrated a significant reduction in the intracellular levels of these FGFs (17.Zuber M.E. Zhou Z. Burrus L.W. Olwin B.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 170: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As CFR did not appear to block entry of these FGFs, or reduce their intracellular stability, the effect was ascribed to an enhanced trafficking of the FGFs from endocytic compartments to the cell exterior, possibly via the Golgi apparatus (17.Zuber M.E. Zhou Z. Burrus L.W. Olwin B.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 170: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The fate of FGF3 represents a very different situation; in this case FGF3 is synthesized as a naturally secreted ligand that would be expected to encounter CFR in the Golgi apparatus. Furthermore, we show here that FGF3 binds CFRin vivo and in vitro (Figs. 3 and 4). In cell culture, increased intracellular levels of CFR result in a progressive reduction in the secretion of FGF3 without a noticeable effect on FGF3 synthesis (Fig. 2 B). In COS-1 cells, the gp30.5 and gp31.5 products associated with the medial Golgi have a half-life time in excess of 4 h and are continuously sensitive to endoglycosidase H digestion and represent the majority of the steady state level of FGF3-related protein (19.Kiefer P. Peters G. Dickson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5781-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The secreted 32.5-kDa form of FGF3 is derived from the smaller products by secondary modification in a Golgi or post-Golgi compartment (19.Kiefer P. Peters G. Dickson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5781-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the presence of heparin to displace the already secreted form from its binding to cell surface heparan-sulfate proteoglycans, no cell-associated gp32.5-kDa product is detectable, suggesting that as soon as FGF3 leaves the medial Golgi the further steps of secretion and modification appear to happen very fast (19.Kiefer P. Peters G. Dickson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5781-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22.Kiefer P. Peters G. Dickson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5929-5936Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Since we have been unable to detect a cell-associated gp32.5-kDa product as a consequence of co-expression of CFR (Fig.2 B), we concluded that CFR must interact with the FGF3 forms when associated with the medial Golgi before they had undergone further modification. However, since the overall amount of intracellular FGF3 protein is not changed within the limits of our assay, the half-life of the FGF3 products routed via CFR in the endosomal-lysosomal compartment is presumably considerably lower than those in the medial Golgi.The sequestration of FGF3 by CFR was further supported by the behavior of the carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants of CFR. The degree to which the CFR proteins change the amount of extracellular FGF3 positively correlates to their own Golgi retention, with the CFR3.1 mutant having the smallest effect on the FGF3 release.In essence, the redistribution of truncated CFR to intracellular vesicles was reflected by an analogous distribution of FGF3 when present in co-transfected COS-1 cells. The CFR potentially contains a Golgi retention and endosomal targeting signal that might shuttle internalized CFR·FGF complex between the endosomal compartment and Golgi via the trans-Golgi network and thereby also provide an interface with the cell surface via endosomes. A possible retrieval of FGF3 by the CFR from the endosomal compartment back to the trans-Golgi network could also account for the significant retardation of FGF3 secretion. As the deleted CFRs may be less efficiently retrieved from the plasma membrane, this would explain their accumulation in the endosomal/lysosomal compartment and also their diminished effect on the FGF secretion.Recently, CFR was also identified as part of a secreted but latent TGF-β complex and was termed latent TGF-β-complexed protein-1 (LTCP-1) (18.Olofsson A. Hellman U. Ten Dijke P.B. Ichijo S., H. Moren A. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It is interesting that TGF-β as well as FGF3 are retained in the Golgi apparatus as a pre-secreted store. Thus, the presence of CFR/MG-160 in the latent transforming growth factor-β complex and its localization to the medial cysternae of the Golgi complex suggest a possible function in the processing and secretion of a member of another growth factor family (19.Kiefer P. Peters G. Dickson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5781-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 20.Miyazono K. Thyberg J. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5668-5675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CFR/MG160/ESL-1/LTCP-1 appears to be a multifunctional protein, although its role within the organism is not clear. It is interesting that ESL-1, a ligand for E-selectin, is a cytokine modulated by cell adhesion molecule that causes the binding of neutrophils to the endothelium. Both FGFs and TGF-β have been implicated as having an involvement in tissue repair and inflammatory responses, albeit with opposing effects. Therefore, we would speculate that maybe this multi-functional protein may help to balance or buffer the effects of these powerful cell signaling molecules in a developmental or tissue repair context. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs)1 are a family of at least 18 structurally related polypeptides that can modulate the growth, differentiation, migration, and survival of various cell types in culture (reviewed in Refs. 1.Basilico C. Moscatelli D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 59: 115-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar, 2.McKeehan W.L. Wang F. Kan M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

Genet. & Dev. 1995; 5: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The properties of FGFs indicate they act primarily as intercellular signaling molecules, by binding to and activating receptors on the surface of the same or adjacent cells. Four high affinity FGF receptor genes (FGFR1–4) have been identified that encode transmembrane tyrosine kinases (5.Green P.J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 639-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 6.Johnson D. Williams L. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). Moreover, signal transduction requires the presentation of FGFs by a second type of receptor composed of heparan sulfate containing proteoglycan. In addition to the transmembrane signaling receptor complex, a third class of membrane-anchored FGF-binding protein has been identified as a cysteine-rich FGF receptor (CFR) (7.Burrus L.W. Zuber M.E.

CFR protein (MG160) is primarily located in the Golgi apparatus, consistent with previous reports, but we also detect a soluble form of the protein that associates with the cell surface and ECM (11.Gonatas J.O.

However, in the light of the results presented here, it would be interesting to know whether cell surface ESL-1 is present as an integral membrane protein or associated with the cell surface by its affinity to glycosaminoglycans. Although the bulk of the intracellular CFR is Golgi complex-associated, it was also found in endosomal vesicles that were identified by co-staining with FITC-labeled dextran. Interestingly, the CFR carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants that lack either the cytoplasmic domain or both cytoplasmic and transmembrane domain showed a more pronounced staining of endosomal compartment. This suggests that the deletion mutations have weakened but not destroyed the Golgi retention and have allowed a greater amount of CFR to enter endosomes. Moreover, a spontaneous carboxyl-terminal truncation mutant of CFR which lacks the cytoplasmic, transmembrane, and juxtamembrane regions appeared to be widely distributed in the cell suggesting that the intraluminal juxtamembrane domain is important for targeting and retention of CFR to the medial Golgi (17.Zuber M.E. Zhou Z. Burrus L.W. Olwin B.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 170: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).The effect of CFR on the biological properties of FGFs remains puzzling. A recent study looking at the effect on exogenously applied FGF1 or FGF2 to Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing elevated levels of CFR demonstrated a significant reduction in the intracellular levels of these FGFs (17.Zuber M.E. Zhou Z. Burrus L.W. Olwin B.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 170: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As CFR did not appear to block entry of these FGFs, or reduce their intracellular stability, the effect was ascribed to an enhanced trafficking of the FGFs from endocytic compartments to the cell exterior, possibly via the Golgi apparatus (17.Zuber M.E. Zhou Z. Burrus L.W. Olwin B.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 170: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The fate of FGF3 represents a very different situation; in this case FGF3 is synthesized as a naturally secreted ligand that would be expected to encounter CFR in the Golgi apparatus. Furthermore, we show here that FGF3 binds CFRin vivo and in vitro (Figs. 3 and 4). In cell culture, increased intracellular levels of CFR result in a progressive reduction in the secretion of FGF3 without a noticeable effect on FGF3 synthesis (Fig. 2 B). In COS-1 cells, the gp30.5 and gp31.5 products associated with the medial Golgi have a half-life time in excess of 4 h and are continuously sensitive to endoglycosidase H digestion and represent the majority of the steady state level of FGF3-related protein (19.Kiefer P. Peters G. Dickson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5781-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The secreted 32.5-kDa form of FGF3 is derived from the smaller products by secondary modification in a Golgi or post-Golgi compartment (19.Kiefer P. Peters G. Dickson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5781-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the presence of heparin to displace the already secreted form from its binding to cell surface heparan-sulfate proteoglycans, no cell-associated gp32.5-kDa product is detectable, suggesting that as soon as FGF3 leaves the medial Golgi the further steps of secretion and modification appear to happen very fast (19.Kiefer P. Peters G. Dickson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5781-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22.Kiefer P. Peters G. Dickson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5929-5936Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Since we have been unable to detect a cell-associated gp32.5-kDa product as a consequence of co-expression of CFR (Fig.2 B), we concluded that CFR must interact with the FGF3 forms when associated with the medial Golgi before they had undergone further modification. However, since the overall amount of intracellular FGF3 protein is not changed within the limits of our assay, the half-life of the FGF3 products routed via CFR in the endosomal-lysosomal compartment is presumably considerably lower than those in the medial Golgi.The sequestration of FGF3 by CFR was further supported by the behavior of the carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants of CFR. The degree to which the CFR proteins change the amount of extracellular FGF3 positively correlates to their own Golgi retention, with the CFR3.1 mutant having the smallest effect on the FGF3 release.In essence, the redistribution of truncated CFR to intracellular vesicles was reflected by an analogous distribution of FGF3 when present in co-transfected COS-1 cells. The CFR potentially contains a Golgi retention and endosomal targeting signal that might shuttle internalized CFR·FGF complex between the endosomal compartment and Golgi via the trans-Golgi network and thereby also provide an interface with the cell surface via endosomes. A possible retrieval of FGF3 by the CFR from the endosomal compartment back to the trans-Golgi network could also account for the significant retardation of FGF3 secretion. As the deleted CFRs may be less efficiently retrieved from the plasma membrane, this would explain their accumulation in the endosomal/lysosomal compartment and also their diminished effect on the FGF secretion.Recently, CFR was also identified as part of a secreted but latent TGF-β complex and was termed latent TGF-β-complexed protein-1 (LTCP-1) (18.Olofsson A. Hellman U. Ten Dijke P.B. Ichijo S., H. Moren A. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It is interesting that TGF-β as well as FGF3 are retained in the Golgi apparatus as a pre-secreted store. Thus, the presence of CFR/MG-160 in the latent transforming growth factor-β complex and its localization to the medial cysternae of the Golgi complex suggest a possible function in the processing and secretion of a member of another growth factor family (19.Kiefer P. Peters G. Dickson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5781-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 20.Miyazono K. Thyberg J. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5668-5675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CFR/MG160/ESL-1/LTCP-1 appears to be a multifunctional protein, although its role within the organism is not clear. It is interesting that ESL-1, a ligand for E-selectin, is a cytokine modulated by cell adhesion molecule that causes the binding of neutrophils to the endothelium. Both FGFs and TGF-β have been implicated as having an involvement in tissue repair and inflammatory responses, albeit with opposing effects. Therefore, we would speculate that maybe this multi-functional protein may help to balance or buffer the effects of these powerful cell signaling molecules in a developmental or tissue repair context. In this study we show that FGF3 can associate with the CFR, and this could account for its poor secretion and retention in the Golgi apparatus (19.Kiefer P. Peters G. Dickson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5781-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). CFR protein (MG160) is primarily located in the Golgi apparatus, consistent with previous reports, but we also detect a soluble form of the protein that associates with the cell surface and ECM (11.Gonatas J.O. Mourelatos Z. Stieber A. Lane W.S. Brosius J. Gonatas N.K. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 457-467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Mourelatos Z. Gonatas J.O. Cinato E. Gonatas N.K.

From the size of the core protein after carbohydrate removal, the secreted CFR is cleaved at the carboxyl terminus, which removes the intra-luminal and transmembrane domain allowing the protein to be secreted. Since we could never detect extracellular or cell-associated CFR forms with a significantly higher molecular mass than 170 kDa, which might correspond to a CFR protein with a sialylated intact protein backbone, the residual bands present after treatment of CFR medium proteins with glycosidases derive most likely from partial digestion. The extracellular and soluble CFR appears to be associated with the ECM and/or cell surface through an affinity with glycosaminoglycans, since soluble heparin is efficient at competing CFR from the cell surface and ECM. CFR/MG160 appears to be homologous to ESL-1, a high affinity binding protein for E-selectin. ESL-1 was identified as a cell surface glycoprotein expressed on myeloid and some lymphoid cells (11.Gonatas J.O. Mourelatos Z. Stieber A. Lane W.S. Brosius J. Gonatas N.K. J.

https://openalex.org/W2006843720,"Myotonic dystrophy is caused by a CTGn expansion in the 3′-untranslated region of a serine/threonine protein kinase gene (DMPK), which is flanked by two other genes, DMWD and SIX5. One hypothesis to explain the wide-ranging effects of this expansion is that, as the mutation expands, it alters the expression of one or more of these genes. The effects may vary in different tissues and developmental stages, but it has been difficult to develop these hypotheses as the normal postnatal developmental expression patterns of these genes have not been adequately investigated. We have developed accurate transcript quantification based on fluorescent real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (TaqMan) to develop gene expression profiles during postnatal development in C57Bl/10 mice. Our results show extensive independent postnatal regulation of the myotonic dystrophy-locus genes in selected tissues and demonstrate which are the most highly expressed of the genes in each tissue. All three genes at the locus are expressed in the adult lens, questioning a previous model of cataractogenesis mediated solely by effects onSix5 expression. Additionally, using an in vivomodel, we have shown that Dmpk levels decrease during the early stages of muscle regeneration. Our data provide a framework for investigation of tissue-specific pathological mechanisms in this disorder.

Our data provide a framework for investigation of tissue-specific pathological mechanisms in this disorder. myotonic dystrophy reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction Myotonic dystrophy (DM1)1 is an autosomal dominant neuromuscular disorder with very variable symptom presentation. Anticipation (a decrease in the age of onset with transmission) is often seen in DM1 and is usually accompanied by increased symptom severity (1.Harper P.S. Myotonic Dystrophy. 2nd Ed. W. B. Saunders Co. Ltd., London1989Google Scholar). The most severe manifestation of the disease is the congenital form, in which newborns present with generalized skeletal muscle hypotonia. In marked contrast, the most minimally affected patients may simply develop late-onset cataracts (clinical presentation reviewed in Ref. 1.Harper P.S. Myotonic Dystrophy. 2nd Ed. W. B. Saunders Co. Ltd., London1989Google Scholar). The mutation underlying DM1 is a CTGn expansion on chromosome 19 (2–7). In the normal population the repeat is between 5–37 copies, but in the DM1 population this may reach several kilobases in peripheral blood leukocytes (8.Brunner H.G. Nillesen W. van Oost B.A. Jansen G. Wieringa B. Ropers H.H. Smeets H.J. J. Med. Genet. 1992; 29: 780-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The repeat is mitotically and meiotically unstable, and there is a broad but not absolute correlation between the expansion size and symptom severity, providing a molecular basis for anticipation (9.Anvret M.

A number of hypotheses have been advanced, including the titration and sequestration of specific RNA-binding proteins (12.Timchenko L.T. Miller J.W. Timchenko N.A. DeVore D.R. Datar K.V. Lin L.

Most attention has focused on the effects of the expansion on nearby genes. The CTG repeat lies in the 3′-untranslated region of a serine/threonine protein kinase (DMPK) (3.Brook J.D. McCurrach M.E.

It has been hypothesized that the expansion may influence the expression of these DM1-locus genes and that this effect could vary in different tissues and at different developmental stages. Allele-specific decreases in the expression of the DM1 locus genes in tissues derived from DM1 patients have been reported (20.Wang J. Pegoraro E. Menegazzo E. Gennarelli M. Hoop R.C. Angelini C.

Ansved T. Edstrom L. Anvret M. Carey N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1053-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).If gene dosage at the DM1-locus contributes to the development of the phenotype, its effects may vary in different tissues, depending on the basal expression of each gene. Existing data on expression of the DM1-locus genes is mainly based on relatively insensitive techniquese.g. Northern blotting, which is insufficient to detectSIX5 expression in most tissues or non-quantitative RT-PCR. Additionally, there have been no truly systematic studies addressing the alterations in expression occurring postnatally, which may be significant given the very different presentations in the congenital and adult forms of the disorder and the late-onset of some of the symptoms.To address this we have examined the expression of the DM1 locus genes in a range of tissues from neonatal and mature mice to generate a spatial and temporal map of expression from this highly conserved locus. To obtain genuinely quantitative data for a large number of samples, it is essential to use a technique that is sensitive, accurate, and has high throughput. The TaqMan system (Perkin-Elmer), which measures fluorescence in real time, fulfils all these requirements and was used throughout.Additionally, it has been reported that in tissue culture systems high levels of DMPK or its 3′-untranslated region inhibit differentiation of myoblasts to mature myotubes (25.Okoli G. Carey N. Johnson K.J. Watt D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 905-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 26.Sabourin L.A. Tamai K. Narang M.A. Korneluk R.G. J. Biol.

By using an in vivo experimental model of skeletal muscle regeneration in mice, we have extended the physiological significance of these findings.RESULTSFollowing initial optimization of the PCR protocols, all primer pairs successfully amplified single products from cDNA, of the expected sequence. No products were detected with genomic DNA template or when excess no-RT controls were analyzed (data not shown), demonstrating that the assays were specific for the transcribed products. Analyses of different dilutions of selected cDNA preparations on different days and using freshly made reaction mixes showed that the variation between assays for individual samples did not exceed 5%. The standard curves demonstrated linearity of the assays with no change in the amplification efficiency over the tested range of 12 up to 1,200,000 copies of template.Postnatal Expression of the DM1-locus GenesFig.1 summarizes the expression of the DM1-locus genes in both neonatal and adult tissue samples.Dmpk is the gene whose expression changes most markedly during postnatal development, increasing in the male distal and proximal skeletal muscles, the heart, and the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. In females there is also an increase in Dmpkexpression in the distal skeletal muscles, the heart, and the small intestine but no significant postnatal changes in the other tissues (see “Discussion” for further information on the small intestine data for the male mice). Postnatal up-regulation of Dmwd was also observed. Dmwd was up-regulated in the male adult distal skeletal muscles, cerebral cortex, and testis, but in contrast,Dmwd levels decreased postnatally in the female cerebral cortex. A similar postnatal decrease was seen in the female small intestine. Six5 expression was down-regulated in adult male proximal skeletal muscles and testis compared with the neonates, but expression increased postnatally in the cerebral cortex. In female mice the only significant change detected for Six5 was a postnatal increase in expression in the small intestine.Patterns of Expression of the DM1-locus GenesIn Fig.2 the graphs demonstrate the patterns of DM1-locus gene expression in different mouse tissues. In certain tissues Dmpk is strikingly much more highly expressed than the other genes. In the distal and proximal skeletal muscles, the small intestine, and the adult heart the levels of Dmpktranscripts far exceed those of Dmwd and Six5 by as much as 2 orders of magnitude. The Dmpk expression in these tissues is also much higher than the levels of Dmpk in the other tissues sampled, e.g. Dmpk is approximately 100-fold more highly expressed in the adult female heart than in the ovaries. It is also notable that in some tissuesDmpk is not the most highly expressed of the genes. In neonatal cortex and cerebellum, Dmwd is more highly expressed that the other two genes, although this is less apparent in the adult samples, except for the female cortex. Dmwd is also the most highly expressed of the DM1-locus genes in the adult testis. There is no tissue in which Six5 is the most highly expressed of the three genes, and in the majority of samples it is expressed at a very low level, particularly in the neonatal brain and the adult testis. Due to technical constraints, we did not dissect out the lens from neonatal mice and, therefore, do not have development data for this tissue. However, it is apparent that all three DM1-locus genes are expressed in the adult lens.Figure 2Relative expression of the DM1-locus genes in C57Bl/10 mouse tissues.

Regenerated fibers are characterized by central nuclei. 3 days post-injection the BaCl2-treated muscles consisted mainly of newly regenerated small diameter muscle fibers interspersed with connective tissue and some peripherally nucleated fibers that had not undergone regeneration. Counts of central nucleation were not recorded at 3 days because of the disparity in fiber size and presence of connective tissue compared with the later time points. 10 days post-injection treated muscles contained centrally nucleated fibers (35–45%) of increased diameter, with minimal amounts of surrounding connective tissue compared with the earlier time point. A similar pattern was seen at 25 days post-injection (16–27% of fibers centrally nucleated). Control contralateral muscles at all 3 time points consisted of close-packed muscle fibers of uniform diameter with virtually no regeneration (data not shown). At 3 days post-treatment Dmpk levels in the regenerating muscles were significantly lower than in the controls. This was the only significant difference seen in gene expression during in vivoregeneration.Figure 3Expression of the DM1-locus genes duringin vivo muscle regeneration.

The majority of previously published studies have analyzed expression of only one or, at most, two of the DM1-locus genes, making it very difficult to compare relative levels of gene expression, e.g. to determine if in a particular tissueDmpk is more highly expressed than Dmwd or how expression of a gene varies between tissues. In contrast, in this report we have used the highly quantitative and reproducible technique of fluorescent real-time RT-PCR, the most sensitive method of quantification available for high throughput studies, which is rapidly becoming the technique of choice in expression studies. Because of its extended linear detection range, the same technique can be used to assess accurately transcript levels from genes that are expressed at widely varying levels, an advantage not enjoyed by the methods previously applied to the DM1-locus genes. Additionally, by including a standard curve for the relevant amplicon on every plate and analyzing all genes for a tissue on a single diluted cDNA preparation, we have abrogated the effects of any inter-test variation in amplification efficiency.It is clear that there is a complex set of postnatal changes in expression of the DM1-locus genes, and the genes are clearly independently regulated during postnatal development. The most striking changes are seen for Dmpk. Expression of Dmpkincreases postnatally in skeletal muscles (with the possible exception of distal muscles in females), the heart, and the small intestine in females. It appears from Fig. 1 that similar increases occur in the male small intestine, but we cannot perform statistical analyses asn = 2 for the adult small intestine (despite repeated extractions and assays, the Tbp data for this sample failed to match our selection criteria). It is noteworthy that these increased levels of Dmpk expression occur in tissues rich in either striated or smooth muscle. The workload of the muscle cells in all these tissues increases considerably during postnatal development, and it may be inferred that increased levels of Dmpk are required under these conditions. Whether this increase is mediated through mechanotransductive processes or is a consequence of changing hormonal influences remains to be established. Preliminary data from juvenile mice (3 weeks old) suggested that in distal skeletal muscles and hearts much of this up-regulation was established within the first few weeks of birth (data not shown). The increased expression ofDmpk in these samples does not represent merely a general pattern in which expression of all non-housekeeping genes is up-regulated, as it is noticeable that expression of Dmwd in the small intestine falls dramatically postnatally.Expression of the DM1-locus genes in the cerebral cortex also seems to exhibit significant levels of postnatal regulation. In all male mice there is significant up-regulation of each gene in the adult cortex compared with neonates, but the same effect is not observed for female mice, where levels of Dmwd drop significantly postnatally. It is not known if these gender-specific differences represent a physiologically relevant phenomenon, perhaps related to hormonal influences.The postnatal expression of the DM1-locus genes does not alter significantly in the ovaries, in contrast to the testis. Levels ofDmwd are significantly increased in the adult testis compared with the neonates, but the opposite trend is observed forSix5. Dmpk levels in the testis do not change postnatally, again reinforcing the concept that there is no obligatory co-ordinate regulation of the genes at this locus.As our technique is standardized, we can calculate definitively the absolute expression patterns of the DM1-locus genes within and between samples. In the skeletal muscles, heart, and small intestine, expression of Dmpk far outstrips that of Dmwd orSix5, in some cases by more than 2 orders of magnitude. In the other tissues analyzed, there are fewer major differences between the expression of the genes, with the exception of the cerebral cortex and adult testis, in which Dmwd is the most highly expressed of the DM1-locus genes. It has been suggested for some time thatDmwd has its highest expression levels in these tissues (19.Jansen G. Bachner D. Coerwinkel M. Wormskamp N. Hameister H. Wieringa B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 843-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), but ours is the first report showing that these levels outstrip those of the other DM1-locus genes. In all adult tissues it was noticeable that Six5 was never the most highly expressed gene, and in some tissues its expression was markedly reduced compared with Dmpk and Dmwd, although we cannot exclude the possibility that there may be small subsets of cells overexpressing a particular gene in a heterogeneous tissue sample. Cell-specific expression can only be determined by in situ hybridization or immuno-histochemistry if suitable antibodies become available, but neither of these techniques is genuinely quantitative. The other alternative, of micro-dissection of samples prior to the TaqMan analyses, is not technically feasible for this work.Our data also indicate that, unlike Dmwd andSix5, expression of Dmpk is influenced by the regenerative status of the muscle. Dmpk is down-regulated during skeletal muscle regeneration, and taken together with the previously published cell culture work (25.Okoli G. Carey N. Johnson K.J. Watt D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 905-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 26.Sabourin L.A. Tamai K. Narang M.A. Korneluk R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29626-29635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), this suggests that very elevated levels of this transcript may be incompatible with the fusion of myoblasts to the terminally differentiated myotube state. This may introduce additional difficulties in analyzing DMPKexpression data from patients with DM1, as it will be important to determine if apparent changes in levels of DMPK in skeletal muscles between DM1/non-DM1 patients are actually a primary molecular effect or a secondary consequence of increased regeneration in a particular sample.What are the implications of the data published here for an understanding of the pathology observed in DM1? Probably the most clear-cut conclusions can be drawn from the data for the adult lens. Winchester et al. (33.Winchester C.L. Ferrier R.K. Sermoni A. Clark B.J. Johnson K.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) analyzed the expression ofSIX5 and DMPK in the human lens using in situ hybridization and RT-PCR. They were unable to detect transcripts for DMPK and concluded that SIX5 was thus a much stronger candidate for involvement in the formation of the characteristic cataracts that are such a common feature in this disease. In contrast, transcripts for all three DM1-locus genes were detected in our adult mouse lens samples. This is unlikely to reflect contamination by other adherent tissues. Samples were collected by a veterinarian with considerable experience of mouse anatomy, and every effort was taken to minimize tissue contamination compatible with minimizing the time before samples were frozen. It is also unlikely that our data represent a simple cross-species difference. In our hands transcripts for all three genes can be readily detected by RT-PCR in freshly isolated human primary lens epithelial cells, 2N. Carey, manuscript in preparation. casting considerable doubt on any model of cataract formation solely based aroundSIX5.DM1 has a very complex multisystemic phenotype and may be more correctly described as a single-locus than a single-gene disorder,i.e. functional haploinsufficiency for one or more of the genes may vary between tissues and ages, depending on the physiological threshold for each gene product. However, attempts to identify molecular pathological mechanisms in DM1 based on models of gene dosage have been severely hampered by the lack of background data available on the normal expression patterns of the DM1-locus genes. This paper attempts to address this by providing the first genuinely quantitative data that allows cross-comparisons between the different genes. Although this work was carried out in a model organism rather than in human material, it provides a useful starting point for generating a developmental map of expression.During mapping efforts to identify human disease genes, it is quite common to be faced with a number of candidate genes from a defined genetic interval. Under these circumstances, a common strategy is to investigate which of the candidates shows the closest correlation between the expression of the gene and the expression of the phenotype. The same rationale can be applied to the DM1 locus, whereby we have three candidate genes for which we need to determine if one of them shows a close correlation between phenotype and expression. Intriguingly, such a correlation appears to exist between the tissues most commonly involved in adults with DM1 and Dmwd. Its levels are highest in lens, testis, and heart and lowest in the tissues rarely implicated, e.g. ovaries and liver (although DM1 patients are often insulin-resistant, this is a purely skeletal muscle phenomenon, as the hepatic response to insulin is normal (34.Moxley R.T. Corbett A.J. Minaker K.L. Rowe J.W. Ann. Neurol. 1984; 15: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar)). The high expression in the lens may be significant, as this tissue acts as the most sensitive indicator of DM1 pathology in minimal expansion patients. Such a correlation is less apparent for the other genes,e.g. Dmpk levels are lowest in the adult gonads, cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and lens, all of which, with the exception of the ovaries, are commonly implicated in DM1. Six5 levels in adults are higher in the liver than the cerebral cortex or testis, inconsistent with the DM1 phenotype. Dmwd levels are also very low in the small intestine, but the pathological data on the small intestine is difficult to interpret. Gastro-intestinal disturbances are commonly reported in DM1 with abnormalities in the large bowel (35.Brunner H.G. Hamel B.C. Rieu P. Howeler C.J. Peters F.T. J. Med. Genet. 1992; 29: 791-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and the duodenum (36.Ronnblom A. Danielsson A. el Salhy M. J. Intern. Med. 1999; 245: 91-97Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) (not analyzed in our study) clearly demonstrated, but more research is required to determine the extent to which the rest of the small intestine is involved. Our data suggest this issue of the precise patterns of tissue involvement in the phenotype may be important. The apparent correlation of symptom presentation withDmwd expression is intriguing, but unfortunately, very few molecular studies have analyzed the expression of Dmwd in patient material. Although our own work suggests that the cytoplasmic levels of DMWD transcripts in skeletal muscle may fall within those found in the control population (24.Eriksson M. Ansved T. Edstrom L. Anvret M. Carey N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1053-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), an allele-specific decrease in DMWD transcripts from the expanded allele has been reported (22.Alwazzan M. Newman E. Hamshere M.G. Brook J.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1491-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The data here suggest that this gene may warrant closer examination than it has previously been awarded to establish conclusively if in a range of DM1 patient tissues, including individual muscle fibers, there is a genuine decrease in DMWDtranscripts. As there is currently no data on the activities and intracellular functions of DMWD protein, it is difficult to speculate at this stage on potential pathological pathways that might result if there is haploin sufficiency of this gene product in patient tissues.In summary, our data have shown that in both muscle regeneration and postnatal expression there is independent regulation of the three DM1-locus genes. This has implications for developing molecular models of DM1, including differentiating between mechanisms for congenital and adult forms of the disorder. Although the very high level of expression of Dmpk suggests it has an important role in adult skeletal muscle function, it is down-regulated during muscle regeneration. Additionally this research demonstrates that SIX5 is not the sole candidate for cataractogenesis and that DMWD may be a stronger candidate for involvement in many aspects of the adult phenotype than has generally been recognized. Myotonic dystrophy (DM1)1 is an autosomal dominant neuromuscular disorder with very variable symptom presentation. Anticipation (a decrease in the age of onset with transmission) is often seen in DM1 and is usually accompanied by increased symptom severity (1.Harper P.S. Myotonic Dystrophy. 2nd Ed. W. B. Saunders Co. Ltd., London1989Google Scholar). The most severe manifestation of the disease is the congenital form, in which newborns present with generalized skeletal muscle hypotonia. In marked contrast, the most minimally affected patients may simply develop late-onset cataracts (clinical presentation reviewed in Ref. 1.Harper P.S. Myotonic Dystrophy. 2nd Ed. W. B. Saunders Co. Ltd., London1989Google Scholar). The mutation underlying DM1 is a CTGn expansion on chromosome 19 (2–7). In the normal population the repeat is be"

Gennis R.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 675-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Electron transfer through this complex is coupled with translocating protons across the chromatophore membrane with a 2H+/e stoichiometry. The purified complex contains four protein subunits: the largest three, housing two b-type cytochromes (b 566 andb 562), one c-type cytochrome (c 1), and one high potential iron-sulfur cluster (2Fe-2S), respectively, are the core subunits; the smallest one (subunit IV), containing no redox prosthetic group, is a supernumerary subunit (2.Yu L. Yu C.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4934-4939Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although all cytochrome bc 1 complexes contain three core subunits, they vary significantly in supernumerary subunit composition. Whereas the bc 1 complex from bovine heart mitochondria has eight supernumerary subunits (3.Schägger H. Brandt U. Gencic S. von Jagow G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 82-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and that from yeast has seven (4.Lijungdahl P.P. Pennoyer J.D. Robertson D.E. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 891: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), the R. sphaeroides complex has one (5.Yu L. Tso S-C. Shenoy S.K. Quinn B.N. Xia D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and those from Rhodopseudomonas rubrum (6.Kriauciunas A., Yu, L., Yu, C.A. Max Wynn R. Knaff D. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1310-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) have none. The complexes containing no supernumerary subunit are less stable and have lower activity than those with supernumerary subunit (4.Lijungdahl P.P. Pennoyer J.D. Robertson D.E. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 891: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The turnover rates for the cytochrome bc 1 complexes purified from mitochondria of bovine heart and yeast and chromatophores of R. sphaeroides and R. capsulatus, by a single chromatographic procedure are: 1152, 219, 128, and 64 s−1(4.Lijungdahl P.P. Pennoyer J.D. Robertson D.E. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 891: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). It is possible that the increased enzymatic activity for the mitochondrial and R. sphaeroides complexes results from interaction of the core complex with supernumerary subunit. However, the study of supernumerary/core subunit interactions in the mitochondrial complex has been complicated by the presence of multiple supernumerary subunits. Since R. sphaeroides bc 1complex has only one supernumerary subunit, it is an ideal system for studying supernumerary/core subunit interactions. The gene encoding subunit IV (fbcQ) was cloned and sequenced (9.Usui S. Yu L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15644-15649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Genomic mapping indicates that the fbcQ gene is at least 900 kilobase pairs away from the fbc operon, which encodes the three core subunits, in the R. sphaeroideschromosome (10.Yun C-H. Beci R. Crofts A.R. Kaplan S. Gennis R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 194: 399-411Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Subunit IV contains 124 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 14,384 (9.Usui S. Yu L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15644-15649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of subunit IV bears no homology with any of the eight supernumerary subunits of the bovine heart mitochondrial bc 1 complex, whose three-dimensional structure at 2.9-Å resolution recently became available (11.Xia D., Yu, C.A. Kim H. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L., Yu, L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1997; 277: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 12.Iwata S. Lee J.W. Okada K. Lee J.K. Iwata M. Rasmussen B. Link T.A. Ramaswamy S. Jap B.K. Science. 1998; 281: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Based on the hydropathy plot of its amino acid sequence, subunit IV contains only one transmembrane helix (amino acid residues 86–109) with 86 and 15 residues at the N-terminal and C-terminal ends, respectively. The sideness of the membrane is unknown, although there has been speculation based on preliminary results of proteolytic enzyme digestion (13.Wu J. Niederman R.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 823-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). When the fbcQ gene is deleted from the R. sphaeroides chromosome, the resulting strain (RSΔIV) requires a period of adaptation (48 h) before the start of photosynthetic growth (14.Chen Y-R. Usui S., Yu, C.A. Yu L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10207-10214Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The cytochrome bc 1 complex in adapted chromatophores is labile to detergent treatment (75% inactivation) and shows a 4-fold increase in the K m for Q2H21(14.Chen Y-R. Usui S., Yu, C.A. Yu L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10207-10214Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Introducing wild-type fbcQ on a stable low copy number plasmid, pRK415, into RSΔIV restores photosynthetic growth behavior, the apparent K m for Q2H2, and tolerance to detergent treatment to that of wild-type cells. Cytochrome bc 1 complex purified from adapted RSΔIV contains only three core subunits. It has only 25% of the activity of the four-subunit enzyme purified from complement or wild-type cells. This low activity is accompanied by an increase of the apparent K m for Q2H2 from 3 to 13 μm. We attribute the changes observed in photosynthetic growth behavior (requires adaptation time) and in detergent lability of the cytochrome bc 1 complex activity (75% inactivation) to a structural role for subunit IV; the change in Q-binding parameter (K m increase) to its Q-binding function. Although the observation of increased K m for Q2H2 for the three-subunit core complex is consistent with the identification of subunit IV as one of the Q-binding proteins in this complex by photoaffinity labeling technique using 3H-azido-Q derivatives (15.Yu L. Yu C.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3658-3664Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar), its Q-binding role has always been regarded as auxiliary. The other Q-binding protein is cytochrome b. Like subunit IV in R. sphaeroides bc 1 complex, subunit VII is identified as the small molecular weight Q-binding protein in beef heart mitochondrialbc 1 complex (16.Yu L. Yang F-D. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 963-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was suggested that the presence of subunit IV or subunit VII stabilizes the Q-binding sites located in cytochrome b, in their respective complexes. However, the idea that subunit VII participates in the Q-binding site of the beef complex was abandoned after the three-dimensional structure of this complex became available in 1997 (11.Xia D., Yu, C.A. Kim H. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L., Yu, L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1997; 277: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Subunit VII is too far from the Q-binding sites of cytochrome b. Perhaps the observed azido-Q labeling on subunit IV is a result of this subunit being a Q sequestering protein. The Q binding activity of mitochondrial subunit VII has been established spectrophotometrically (17.Yu L. Deng K-P. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25634-25638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The decrease in K m for Q2H2 and increase in enzymatic activity for the wild-type or complement complex may result from a conformational change in the three-subunit core complex upon interaction with subunit IV. The conformation of the wild-type or complement complex is now more favorable for Q binding. Some essential amino acid residues in subunit IV have been identified by site-directed mutagenesis followed by gene complementation (in vivo reconstitution) (18.Chen Y-R. Shenoy S.K., Yu, C.A. Yu L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11496-11501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Although this approach is very useful in structure-function studies of subunit IV, it is often complicated by mutational effects on complex assembly and by mutant protein stability (18.Chen Y-R. Shenoy S.K., Yu, C.A. Yu L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11496-11501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Recently we overexpressed subunit IV in Escherichia coli as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein (19.Chen Y-R., Yu, C.A. Yu L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 2057-2062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and purified recombinant GST-IV fusion protein from cell extracts on glutathione-agarose gel. Purified recombinant subunit IV is obtained by thrombin digestion of recombinant fusion protein followed by gel filtration to remove uncleaved fusion protein and thrombin. Addition of recombinant IV to the three-subunit core complex, which has a fraction of the wild-type bc 1 complex activity and a 4-fold increase of the K m for Q2H2 (14.Chen Y-R. Usui S., Yu, C.A. Yu L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10207-10214Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), restores enzymatic activity and Q-binding parameter to that of the wild-type complex, indicating that recombinant subunit IV is properly assembled into thebc 1 complex (19.Chen Y-R., Yu, C.A. Yu L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 2057-2062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus we can use reconstitutively active recombinant subunit IV to study its interaction in the bc 1 complex by site-directed mutagenesis coupled with in vitro reconstitution. Herein we report generation and characterization of subunit IV mutants which identify the regions of subunit IV required for interaction with the core complex to restore bc 1 activity. The topological arrangement of subunit IV in the chromatophore membrane is determined by monospecific polyclonal antibodies for various segments of subunit IV. The docking model for subunit IV in the bc 1complex is presented. The effect of the transmembrane helix region of subunit IV on its assembling into the bc 1complex is investigated. The effect of Rieske iron-sulfur protein on the incorporation of subunit IV to the bc 1complex is also examined. Dodecyl maltoside was purchased from Anatrace.

E. coli cells were grown at 37 °C on LB medium. Extra-rich medium (TYP) was used in procedures for the rescue of single-stranded DNA. For photosynthetic growth of the plasmid-bearing R. sphaeroides cells, an enriched Siström medium containing 5 mm glutamate and 0.2% casamino acids was used (23.Tian H., Yu, L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27953-27959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The pH of the medium was adjusted to 7.1 with 6 n NaOH to increase the sodium ion content to a more optimal level (24.Siström W.R. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1960; 22: 778-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Antibiotics were added to the following concentrations: ampicillin, 100–125 mg/liter; tetracycline, 10–15 mg/liter for E. coli and 1 mg/liter for R. sphaeroides; kanamycin sulfate, 30–50 mg/liter for E. coli and 20 mg/liter for R. sphaeroides; trimethoprim, 25 mg/liter for R. sphaeroides. The expression vector for His-tagged, wild-type, four-subunit cytochrome bc 1 complex (pRKDfbcFBCHQ) was constructed previously in our laboratory (23.Tian H., Yu, L. Yu C.A. J. Biol.

The expression vector for the subunit IV-deficient, three-subunit core complex (pRKDfbcFBCH) was generated by digestion of the pRKDfbcFBCHQ plasmid with BamHI and HindIII to remove thefbcQ gene, filling in with Klenow and annealing the ends. pRKDfbcFBCHQ and pRKDfbcFBCH were mobilized into BC17 and RSΔIV, respectively, by parental conjugation (25.Donohue T.J.

The His6-tagged four-subunit wild-type complex, three-subunit core complex, and two-subunit (cytochromes b and c 1) complex were purified from chromatophores of photosynthetically grown pRKD fbcFBCHQ/BC17, pRKDfbcFBCH/RSΔIV, and pRKDfbcF(ΔADV)BCHQ/BC17 (22.Tian H., Yu, L.

An appropriate amount of enzyme preparation was added to an assay mixture (1 ml) containing 50 mmNa+/K+ phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μm cytochrome c, and 25 μm Q2H2. Activity was determined by measuring the reduction of cytochrome c (the increase in absorbance at 550 nm) in a Shimadzu UV-2101PC, at 23 °C. Nonenzymatic oxidation of Q2H2 was determined under the same conditions in the absence of enzyme. A millimolar extinction coefficient of 18.5 was used to calculate the concentration of cytochrome c. Restriction enzyme digestion, large scale isolation and mini-preparation of plasmid DNA, agarose electrophoresis, purification of DNA fragments from gel matrices, and immunological screening of transformants for production of subunit IV mutants with antibodies against subunit IV were performed according to the protocols described by Sambrook et al. (26.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Goat anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate was used as the second antibody in the screening of transformants. The expression vectors for mutants IV(1–40), IV(1–76), IV(1–85), and IV(1–109) were constructed by introducing the stop codon (TGA) at positions 121, 229, 256, and 328 base pairs downstream from the start codon of the fbcQ gene in the pSelect/IV plasmid, respectively. They were achieved by site-directed mutagenesis using the Altered Sites System from Promega Corp. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutant oligonucleotides used were: IV(1–40), CGCCTGGTGCAGAAATCGTGAGAGCTCCTCAAC; IV(1–76), GCCAGCGCGATTTCGAGTGAGTCTGGAAATATC; IV(1–85), CGCTACCGCCTCTGAGGCTTCGCCTCG; IV(1–109), GGCAACTTCGGAGGCTGATCGGACGCCGGCAAC. TheBamHI fragments from pSelect/IVm plasmids containing mutated subunit IV genes were ligated into the BamHI site of pGEX to generate pGEX/IV(1–40), pGEX/IV(1–76), pGEX/IV(1–85), and pGEX/IV(1–109) plasmids which were transformed into E. coliKS1000 cells. Expression vectors for mutants IV(86–109), IV(77–109), IV(54–109), IV(41–109), and IV(21–109) were generated by the PCR amplification method using the pGEX/IV(1–109) plasmid as a template, oligonucleotide GAAAAGCTTCAGATGCGC as a reversed primer, and one of the following oligonucleotides as a forward primer: IV (86–109), CCGCGTGGATCCGGCGGCTTCGCC; IV(77–109), CCGCGTGGATCCACTGTCTGGAAATATCGCT; IV(54–109), CCGCGTGGATCCGCGACCTGGATC; IV(41–109), CCGCGTGGATCCCGCGAGCTCCTC; IV(21–109), CCGCGTGGATCCGACCTCAGGAAA. For construction of the IV(86– 124) expression vector, the pGEX/IV plasmid was used as the template and oligonucleotides, CCGCGTGGATCCGGCGGCTTCGCC and GAAAAGCTTCAGATGCGC, were used as forward and reversed PCR primers, respectively. PCR amplification was performed in a minicycler from M. J. Research. The thermal cycle was set-up as follows: step 1, 94 °C for 1 min; step 2, 92 °C for 40 s for denaturation; step 3, 60 °C for 40 s for annealing; and step 4, 75 °C for 90 s for extension. A total of 30 cycles were performed with a final extension step of 5 min. The annealing time for the PCR amplification of the IV(77–109) fragment was set for 70 s. PCR products were confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis and cloned into the pCR cloning vector pCR2.1 from Invitrogen to generate pCR/IVm plasmids. TheBamHI-HindIII fragments from pCR/IVm plasmids were ligated into pGEX-2TH vectors to generate pGEX/IVm plasmids. These pGEX/IVm plasmids were individually transformed into E. coliKS1000. Transformants producing the GST-IVm fusion proteins were identified by immunological screening of colonies with antibodies against subunit IV and/or against GST. Production of GST-IV or GST-IVm fusion protein by E. coli KS1000 carrying pGEX/RSΔIV or pGEX/RSIVm was essentially the same as that described previously (18.Chen Y-R. Shenoy S.K., Yu, C.A. Yu L. J.

The resulting culture was incubated at 37 °C with vigorous shaking until theA 600 nm reached 1.0 (approximately 2.5 h). The cell cultures were cooled to 27 °C, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm, and grown at 27 °C for 3 h before being harvested by centrifugation at 8,000 ×g for 30 min. About 52 g cells were obtained and resuspended in 150 ml of 12 mmNa+/K+ phosphate, pH 7.3, containing 140 mm NaCl and 2.7 mm KCl (phosphate-buffered saline). Cells were broken in a French press at 1000 p.s.i. During French pressing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (500 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide) was added to the cell suspension to a final concentration of 1 mm. Triton X-100 was added to the broken cell suspension to a final concentration of 1%. The suspension was stirred for 30 min at 0 °C and centrifuged at 40,000 ×g for 20 min. The supernatant was mixed with 20 ml of glutathione-agarose gel equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline. This gel mixture was shaken gently for 30 min at room temperature and packed into a column (1.6 × 20 cm). After washing five times with 500 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, the GST/subunit IV fusion protein was eluted from the column with 10 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and concentrated to a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml by Centriprep-10. The fusion protein was treated with thrombin (1/500, w/w) at room temperature for 1 h to release subunit IV from GST. The thrombin-digested sample was first treated with a small amount of glutathione beads to partially remove the released GST and then subjected to gel filtration with a Superose-12 FPLC column to completely remove GST and thrombin. A 15-amino acid residue C-terminal peptide (NH2-SSDAGNRPSVVYPIE-COOH) corresponding to residues 110–124 and a near N-terminal peptide containing 15 amino acid residues (NH2-KRMPSREEVAARRQR-COOH) corresponding to residues 59–73 were synthesized, purified, and used as antigens, after conjugation with ovalbumin, to raise antibodies in rabbits (27.Li L.-B. Zou Y-P., Yu, L. Yu C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1057: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Boosters were given weekly for 5 weeks, and sera were collected by cardiac puncture. Purification of antibodies and preparation of the antibody Fab′ fragment-horseradish peroxidase conjugates were as previously reported (28.Yu L. Wei Y.Y. Usui S. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24508-24515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase activity of the purified conjugate was assayed using TMB peroxidase substrate kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer instructions. SDS-PAGE were performed by the method of Laemmli (29.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205463) Google Scholar) or Schägger and von Jagow (30.Schägger H. von Jagow G.

Chem. 1996; 270: 2057-2062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (19) Google Scholar) that addition of purified recombinant subunit IV to the three-subunit complex restores thebc 1 complex activity to the same level as that of wild-type or complement four-subunit complex, indicating that recombinant subunit IV is properly assembled into the complex. To localize the regions required for reconstitutive activity, recombinant subunit IVs with progressive deletion of amino acid residues from the C terminus were generated and characterized. These are: IV(1–109), IV(1–85), IV(1–76), and IV(1–40), with deletions of 15, 39, 48, and 84 amino acid residues from the C terminus of subunit IV, respectively. These four C-terminal truncated subunit IV mutants are produced inE. coli as GST fusion proteins using constructed expression vectors, pGEX/IV(1–109), pGEX/IV(1–85), pGEX/IV(1–76), and pGEX/IV(1–40), respectively. These expression vectors were constructed by in-frame ligation of the subunit IV gene having the stop codon genetically engineered at positions 328, 256, 229, and 121 base pairs downstream from the start codon, respectively, into the GST gene in the pGEX-2TH vector. The yield and purity of these four recombinant GST-mutant IV fusion proteins are comparable to that of GST-wild-type IV fusion protein (see Fig.1 A). Purified recombinant subunit IV mutants, IV(1–40), IV(1–76), IV(1–85), and IV(1–109) (see Fig. 1 B) are obtained from their respective fusion proteins by thrombin cleavage and gel filtration. Table I shows reconstitutive activities of the C-terminal truncated subunit IV mutants, with and without fused GST. Addition of purified recombinant IV(1–109) to the three-subunit complex restores the cytochrome bc 1 complex activity to the same level as that of the recombinant wild-type IV, suggesting that 15 amino acid residues (residues 110–124) on the C terminus of subunit IV are not essential. This result is consistent with the in vivo gene complementation study which showed that deletion of residues 120–124 of subunit IV does not impair the cytochrome bc 1 complex activity (17.Yu L. Deng K-P. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25634-25638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). While the IV(1–109) mutant possesses full reconstitutive activity, the IV(1–85) mutant shows no reconstitutive activity, indicating that residues 86–109 are essential. As expected, mutants IV(1–76) and IV(1–40) have no reconstitutive activity because the essential residues 86–109 are missing.Table IReconstitutive activities of the C-terminal truncated subunit IV mutantsPreparationsReconstitutive activity, %Fused GSTFreeWild type100100IV(1–109)9997IV(1–85)80IV(1–76)60IV(1–40)00Five-μl aliquots of the three-subunit core complex (20 μm cytochrome b) were added to 40 μl of TDE buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.01% dedecylmaltoside, 1 mm EDTA) containing none, purified recombinant wild-type IV (12 μg), IV(1–109) (13 μg), IV(1–85) (11 μg), IV(1–76) (9 μg), and IV(1–40) (5 μg). The mixtures were incubated at 4 UC for 1 h, treated with 55 μl of 50 mm TrisCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm EDTA and assayed for the bc1complex activity. The same conditions were used for fusion proteins. The amounts of fusion protein used were: GST-IV(1–124), 40 μg; GST-IV(1–109), 39 μg; GST-IV(1–85), 37 μg; GST-IV(1–76), 35 μg; and GST-IV(1–40), 31 μg.

The 100% reconstitutive activity is that restored by recombinant wild-type IV with or without fused GST. As shown in Table I, when these four C-terminal truncated subunit IVs fused with GST are added to the three-subunit core complex, the percent activity restoration is the same as when non-fusion proteins are added, indicating that a free N-terminal of subunit IV may not be essential for its interaction with the three-subunit core complex. Since residues 86–109 are essential for reconstitutive activity of subunit IV, it is important to elucidate the role this fragment plays during reconstitution.

https://openalex.org/W2086487198,"It has been shown that skeletal and smooth muscle myosin heads binding to actin results in the movement of smooth muscle tropomyosin, as revealed by a change in fluorescence resonance energy transfer between a fluorescence donor on tropomyosin and an acceptor on actin (Graceffa, P. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 11984–11992). In this work, tropomyosin movement was similarly monitored as a function of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated smooth muscle myosin double-headed fragment smHMM. In the absence of nucleotide and at low myosin head/actin ratios, only phosphorylated heads induced a change in energy transfer. In the presence of ADP, the effect of head phosphorylation was even more dramatic, in that at all levels of myosin head/actin, phosphorylation was necessary to affect energy transfer. It is proposed that the regulation of tropomyosin position on actin by phosphorylation of myosin heads plays a key role in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction. In contrast, actin-bound caldesmon was not moved by myosin heads at low head/actin ratios, as uncovered by fluorescence resonance energy transfer and disulfide cross-linking between caldesmon and actin. At higher head concentration caldesmon was dissociated from actin, consistent with the multiple binding model for the binding of caldesmon and myosin heads to actin (Chen, Y., and Chalovich, J. M. (1992) Biophys. J. 63, 1063–1070).

The sliding movement is due to the cyclic interaction of myosin heads from the thick filament with actin in the thin filament and the contraction is switched on by Ca2+ infusion into the muscle cell. In skeletal muscle, Ca2+ binding to the troponin complex, which is bound to tropomyosin and actin in the thin filament, relieves the inhibition of the actomyosin ATPase activity. It is thought that the inhibition is due to some type of steric blocking of the myosin binding site on actin by tropomyosin. Tropomyosin is a coiled-coil dimer that binds end-to-end on the actin filament, each molecule spanning seven actin subunits. It is thought that the movement of tropomyosin away from this blocking position, initiated by the binding of Ca2+ to troponin, removes the inhibition of contraction (reviewed in Ref. 1.Leavis P.C. Gergely J. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 16: 235-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Interaction of each tropomyosin molecule with seven actin subunits and end-to-end tropomyosin interaction on the thin filament imparts cooperativity to the switching process. The initial binding of myosin heads to the thin filament is also thought to take part in the switching on of skeletal muscle contraction by a shifting of the dynamic equilibrium of tropomyosin between on and off states toward the on state (reviewed in Refs. 2.Lehrer S.S. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1994; 15: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar and 3.Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 1081-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Such a process could also involve a movement of tropomyosin. Recent electron microscopic studies of skeletal muscle actin thin filaments have given strong evidence to support these ideas (4.Lehman W. Craig R. Vibert P. Nature. 1994; 368: 65-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 5.Lehman W. Vibert P. Uman P. Craig R. J. Mol.

Tobacman L. Horowitz R. Lehman W. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 985-992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These studies have shown that for the full movement of skeletal tropomyosin, i.e. for the myosin binding site on actin to be fully exposed, it is necessary that Ca2+ binds to troponin and that some myosin heads bind to actin.Smooth muscle contraction is initiated by the Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of light chains bound to the head region of myosin in the thick filament and switched off by dephosphorylation (reviewed in Ref. 8.Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1985; 25: 593-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The basis of this control is that the actin-activated myosin ATPase activity is dramatically elevated by myosin phosphorylation. The molecular mechanism of this phosphorylation-dependent activation is not understood. It is also unknown what role the thin filament plays in regulation, since Ca2+ regulation takes place in the thick filament and the smooth muscle actin thin filament does not contain troponin. The thin filament contains a smooth muscle isoform of tropomyosin and two smooth muscle-specific proteins, caldesmon and calponin. It is known that one function of smooth muscle tropomyosin is to elevate (or potentiate) the actin-activated myosin ATPase activity (reviewed in Refs. 9.Small J.V. Sobieszek A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 64: 241-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 10.Marston S.B. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1982; 41: 1-41Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 11.Small J.V. Sobieszek A.

Chem. 1990; 265: 2105-2110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of this potentiation is unknown. Although caldesmon and calponin control the in vitrosmTm1-actin-activated myosin ATPase activity, their in vivo function is uncertain (13.Allen B.G. Walsh M.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 362-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar).Although myosin phosphorylation is necessary to switch on smooth muscle contraction, the resulting force produced and the level of phosphorylation are not uniquely coupled (reviewed in Refs. 14.Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 15.Gerthoffer W.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: L15-L28PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Walsh M.P. Can. J. Physiol.

Thus, it has generally been considered that there are additional mechanism(s) of regulation or modulation of contraction, mechanisms that might reside in the thin filament. Since it is fairly well established that the movement of skeletal muscle tropomyosin plays a key role in the thin filament regulation of skeletal muscle contraction, the question arises as to whether such a movement of smooth muscle tropomyosin also exists. In our previous work, using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), we found that, indeed, smooth muscle tropomyosin moved upon the binding to actin of single-headed (skS1) and double-headed (skHMM) fragments of skeletal muscle myosin and the single-headed (smS1) fragment of smooth muscle myosin (23.Graceffa P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11984-11992Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Since smS1 is constitutively active (reviewed in Ref. 24.Adelstein R.S. Sellers J.R. Barany M. Biochemistry of Smooth Muscle Contraction. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1996: 3-19Crossref Google Scholar) (i.e. its ATPase activity is activated by smTm-actin whether phosphorylated or not), in the present study we examined the movement of smooth muscle tropomyosin by the double-headed (smooth muscle heavy meromyosin; smHMM) fragment of smooth muscle myosin whose activity is regulated by phosphorylation. We found that the smHMM-induced movement of tropomyosin was controlled by the phosphorylation of smHMM, suggesting the involvement of the movement of tropomyosin in the switching on and off of smooth muscle contraction. Indeed, an early x-ray diffraction study suggested that the activation of smooth muscle led to the movement of tropomyosin (25.Vibert P.J. Haselgrove J.C. Lowy J. Poulsen F.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 71: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESUnless stated otherwise, the procedures used in this study are those described in the previous work (23.Graceffa P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11984-11992Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In those cases where the Lowry assay was used for protein determination in the previous work, I have substituted the BCA assay (27.Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Knenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18445) Google Scholar) in this study. The BCA protein assay reagent A was purchased from Pierce. Previously, I have prepared G-actin for labeling with the acceptor DAB by homogenizing an actin pellet, prepared from acetone powder according to Spudich and Watt (28.Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with G buffer plus a 1 mm concentration of the reducing agent DTT and then dialyzing extensively versusG-buffer to remove the DTT. Labeling of this preparation always resulted in a DAB/actin ratio of about 0.7, significantly less than the maximum of 1 (23.Graceffa P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11984-11992Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this work, the actin pellet was homogenized with G buffer plus 10 mm DTT and incubated 30–60 min before dialysis, which ultimately resulted in a labeling ratio very close to the maximum of 1. Smooth muscle myosin from chicken gizzard was thiophosphorylated according to Trybus and Lowey (29.Trybus K.M. Lowey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8564-8571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with ATPγS from Sigma. The degree of thiophosphorylation was assayed by urea gel electrophoresis (30.Perrie W.T. Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1970; 119: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 31.Perrie W.T. Smillie L.B. Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1973; 135: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and found to be between 70 and 100% as judged by scanning and desitometry of the urea gel. The thiophosphorylated double-headed fragment of smooth muscle myosin, smHMM, was prepared by chymotryptic digestion of thiophosphorylated myosin according to Suzukiet al. (32.Suzuki H. Kondo Y. Carlos A.D. Seidel J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10974-10979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and will be referred to as smHMM-SP. Thiophosphorylation was used to avoid dephosphorylation by a myosin phosphatase, which sometimes contaminates smooth muscle myosin preparations. The smHMM molecular mass was taken as 334 kDa, and its concentration was obtained from the absorbance at 280 nm minus that at 320 nm using an extinction coefficient A280 nm1% = 6.4 cm−1.Caldesmon (CaD) from chicken gizzard (33.Graceffa P. Jancso A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20305-20310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and pig stomach (34.Lash J.A. Sellers J.R. Hathaway D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16155-16160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was prepared and labeled at Cys580 with IAEDANS (35.Graceffa P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30187-30193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Graceffa P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3792-3801Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) as described previously. Cys580 of chicken gizzard CaD was disulfide cross-linked to Cys374 of actin with dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) as we have reported (33.Graceffa P. Jancso A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20305-20310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).FRET was determined by the change in steady-state fluorescence of the AED donor attached to Cys36 of smooth muscle tropomyosin (AED36smTm) in the presence of the DAB acceptor attached to actin Cys374 (DAB-A) as a function of smHMM, as described (23.Graceffa P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11984-11992Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Measurements were made at 20 °C in 40 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, pH 7.5, with AED36smTm at 0.6 μm and DAB-A at 4.8 μm. Fluorescence changes were first corrected for changes that were not due to energy transfer. These corrections were all very small or negligible as in the previous work. First of all, the direct effect of actin on the fluorescence of AED36smTm was insignificant. Second, the drop in AED36smTm fluorescence due to the trivial absorption (37.Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 44Google Scholar) of excitation and emission light by the DAB-A was small at about 5%. This was determined in two different ways, which gave the same value. It was either calculated (37.Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 44Google Scholar) from the change in optical density at the 340-nm excitation and 505-nm emission wavelengths upon the addition of DAB-A to unlabeled smTm or determined from the change in fluorescence of AED-DTT in the presence of smTm upon the addition of DAB-A. Finally, fluorescence was corrected for the direct effect of smHMM on the fluorescence of AED36smTm or due to trivial absorption by smHMM either by direct absorption or by increased light scattering due to its interaction with smTm-actin. These corrections were determined in two different ways and in both cases found to be insignificant. In the first, the fluorescence of AED36smTm in the presence of unlabeled actin was titrated with smHMM. In this case, fluorescence changes were the result of both a direct effect of smHMM on AED36smTm fluorescence and trivial absorption due to smHMM. In the second case, the fluorescence of AED-DTT in the presence of unlabeled smTm and actin was titrated with smHMM. In this case, changes in fluorescence were due only to changes in trivial absorption. In both cases, after small corrections for dilution due to small volumes of added smHMM, there was no significant change in fluorescence. Therefore, smHMM (thiophosphorylated or not) had no significant direct effect on the fluorescence of AED36smTm or indirect effect on fluorescence due to trivial absorption. It was also necessary to check the effect of smHMM on the absorption spectrum of DAB bound to actin in the presence of unlabeled Tm. Any change in the absorption spectrum would change the overlap integral and thus change FRET (see Ref. 23.Graceffa P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11984-11992Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar and references therein). We found that both smHMM-SP and skS1 had no effect on the absorption spectrum of DAB-actin/Tm, thus ruling out such a change as responsible for the changes in FRET that we observe. Since the energy transfer depends on the sixth power of the overlap integral, only a large change in DAB absorption would have a significant effect.RESULTSAs in the previous study (23.Graceffa P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11984-11992Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) the movement of smooth muscle tropomyosin by myosin heads was monitored by measuring the change in distance between a fluorescent AED donor attached to tropomyosin and a DAB acceptor (which is nonfluorescent) attached to Cys374of actin (DAB-A), using the technique of fluorescence resonance energy transfer. We used chicken gizzard smooth muscle tropomyosin which is a coiled-coil heterodimer of an α-chain with a single cysteine at position 190, in the C-terminal half of the molecule, and a β-chain with a single cysteine at position 36, near the N terminus, both chains containing 284 residues. In this work, the donor was attached to Cys36 of the heterodimer, since in the previous work (23.Graceffa P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11984-11992Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) the donor at this residue showed a larger change in fluorescence than that at Cys190.Upon the addition of DAB-A to AED36smTm, there was a drop in AED fluorescence due to a transfer of energy to DAB on actin (Fig.1). This transfer corresponded to a distance of about 45 Å between the donor and acceptor in the smTm-actin complex, assuming energy transfer between a single donor and single acceptor, close to the 43 Å we reported earlier (23.Graceffa P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11984-11992Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The further addition of thiophosphorylated smHMM (smHMM-SP), in the absence of nucleotide, resulted in an additional drop in AED fluorescence (Fig.1), corresponding to a decrease in distance between tropomyosin donor and actin acceptor of about 4.5 Å and thus to a movement of tropomyosin. This is roughly the same change in distance brought about by the single-headed smooth muscle myosin fragment smS1 (23.Graceffa P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11984-11992Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The head-induced change in fluorescence was measured as a function of added thiophosphorylated and unphosphorylated smHMM (smHMM-UP). A comparison of these titrations demonstrated that smHMM-UP did not change fluorescence up to a smHMM-UP head/actin ratio of 1:7, whereupon the fluorescence dropped with a further increase in smHMM-UP concentration, whereas smHMM-SP showed no such lag (Fig.2). Both smHMM-SP and smHMM-UP bound to the AEDsmTm-DAB-A complex, determined under the same exact conditions used for fluorescence measurements, close to 100% at all levels of head/actin used in the titration. Thus, the lag in FRET change with smHMM-UP is not due to a lag in its binding to actin.Figure 2Titration of AED36smTm fluorescence (arbitrary units) in the presence of DAB-A as a function of added smHMM-UP (×) or smHMM-SP (open circles). Other conditions were as described in the legend to Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the presence of ADP, the difference between smHMM-SP and smHMM-UP was even more dramatic (Fig. 3). While smHMM-SP showed roughly the same change in FRET as in the absence of ADP, smHMM-UP essentially had no effect on FRET at all levels of head/actin tested. Although ADP had no effect on the binding of smHMM-SP to donor-smTm/acceptor-actin, ADP did weaken the binding of smHMM-UP (Table I). The percentage binding of smHMM-UP increased as the smHMM head/actin ratio increased (Table I), indicating a positive cooperativity. However, this weakened binding does not explain the lack of effect of smHMM-UP on FRET, since, for example, at a smHMM-UP added head/actin ratio of 6:7, greater than 90% of smHMM is bound to actin, and yet there is essentially no change in FRET (Fig. 3).Figure 3Titration of AED36smTm fluorescence (arbitrary units) in the presence of DAB-A as a function of added smHMM-UP (×) or smHMM-SP (open circles) in the presence of 0.5 mm MgADP.

Open table in a new tab The fluorescence dependence on smHMM-SP concentration shows a leveling off at a head/actin ratio of about 4:7 (Fig. 2), lower than saturation at 7:7 but considerably higher than the 1:7 for smS1 (23.Graceffa P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11984-11992Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The difference in the steepness of the change in fluorescence between smHMM-SP and smS1 is similar to the difference between the skeletal muscle myosin single- and double-headed fragments (23.Graceffa P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11984-11992Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), indicating that this difference is due to single- and double-headed moieties. Thus, it appears that the double-headed myosin fragments affect the tropomyosin less cooperatively than the single-headed fragments.To quantitate this difference in cooperativity, we employed the same model (38.Lehrer S.S. Golitsina N.L. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13449-13454Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) that we used in the analysis of the movement of smTm by skS1 in our previous study (23.Graceffa P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11984-11992Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this model, it is assumed that: 1) there is random binding of HMM or S1 to actin monomers in the thin filament; 2) HMM binds to two actin subunits; and 3) the binding of more than one S1 or HMM within a cooperative unit has no further effect on the movement of tropomyosin. There is evidence that for strong- binding heads (i.e. at low salt and in the absence of nucleotide), both heads of HMM bind to actin subunits (see Ref. 39.Conibear P.B. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 926-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar and references therein), and S1 or HMM molecules bind randomly (i.e. as a linear function of head concentration) to actin (38.Lehrer S.S. Golitsina N.L. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13449-13454Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 40.Ishii Y. Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1160-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 41.Golitsina N.L. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Lehrer S.S. Biophys. J. 1995; 68 (abstr.): A60Google Scholar). We used the equation f m = 1 − (1 −f b) n (38.Lehrer S.S. Golitsina N.L. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13449-13454Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), where f m is the fraction of tropomyosin molecules moved, f bis the fraction of actin monomers to which S1 or HMM is bound, andn, the cooperative unit, is the number of actin monomers affected, via the movement of tropomyosin, by the binding of each S1 or HMM molecule to the actin thin filament. Several curves were generated for this equation, using multiples of 7 for n, and compared with data from Fig. 2 of this work or Fig. 4 of Ref. 23.Graceffa P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11984-11992Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, assuming that the fractional change in AED36smTm fluorescence corresponds to the fraction of tropomyosin molecules moved (Fig.4). The effect of skS1 is highly cooperative in that each head affects 21–28 actin monomers (in effect the movement of three or four tropomyosin molecules), whereas smHMM-SP- and skHMM-induced effects are much less cooperative in affecting about seven actin subunits through the movement of one tropomyosin molecule. This difference can be explained, at least in part, by the fact that both heads of HMM have to bind within the same cooperative unit and thus are less effective than single-headed S1. In such a case, however, the HMM effect should level off at twice the concentration of S1, that is at a head/actin ratio of about 2:7 as opposed to about 1:7 for S1. Since the HMM effect usually levels off at a head/actin ratio between 3:7 and 5:7, the effect of HMM on tropomyosin must be more complex. A similar difference in cooperativity between skS1 and skHMM has been observed by others in the head-induced transition of smTm from off to on states (38.Lehrer S.S. Golitsina N.L. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13449-13454Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 41.Golitsina N.L. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Lehrer S.S. Biophys. J. 1995; 68 (abstr.): A60Google Scholar).Figure 4Cooperativity of smooth muscle tropomyosin movement by myosin heads. The fraction of AED36smTm moved is assumed to equal the fractional change in AED36smTm fluorescence. Myosin heads are as follows: skS1 (closed circles), skHMM (closed squares), smHMM-SP (open squares). The curves (solid lines) were generated from a random head binding model with different values for the cooperative unit parametern, using the equation f m = 1 − (1 − f b) n, where f mrepresents the fraction of AED36smTm moved, f brepresents the fraction of actin monomers occupied with heads, andn represents the number of actin monomers affected, via the movement of AED36smTm, by the binding of each S1 or HMM molecule to the actin thin filament.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The calculation of distances from fluorescence resonance energy transfer depends, among other factors, on the relative orientation of the donor and acceptor probes (see Ref. 23.Graceffa P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11984-11992Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar and references to reviews therein). This is expressed in the factor κ2, which can be assumed to have a value of 23 if there is sufficient mobility and/or a broad orientation distribution of the donor and/or acceptor. This is a reasonable assumption for the AED36smTm/DAB-A system given the rather low AED polarization of 0.15 (and thus high mobility) of AED in the AED36smTm-DAB-A complex (23.Graceffa P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11984-11992Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 42.Tao T. Lamkin M. Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3059-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the experimental rigid limit polarization of the parent IAEDANS probe (0.35) is low compared with the theoretical limit of 0.5 (43.Hudson E.N. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4154-4160Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). This suggests multiple transitions with mixed polarizations, which further reduces the uncertainty in assuming that κ2 is 23(44.Haas E. Katchalski-Katzir E. Steinberg I.Z. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5064-5070Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). However, more importantly for this study, for changes in FRET upon titration with myosin heads to be interpreted as due to changes in distance between donor and acceptor, the actual value of κ2 is unimportant, but it is necessary that it does not change. In order to evaluate the validity of this assumption, the following experiments were conducted. First of all, the mobility of the AED probe on AED36smTm bound to unlabeled actin was assessed by determining the fluorescence polarization, which had a value close to 0.15 and which remained constant upon titration with smHMM-SP, indicating a lack of change in κ2 due to a change of mobility of the AED probe. The same results were obtained with skS1 in the previous work (23.Graceffa P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11984-11992Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In the previous study, we also showed that, although skS1 changed FRET between AED36smTm αβ-heterodimer and DAB-A, skS1 had little or no effect on FRET between AED36smTm ββ-homodimer and DAB-A (Fig"
https://openalex.org/W2014418005,"Abstract The antagonist activity of short-chain toxins from snake venoms toward the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is neutralized upon binding to a toxin-specific monoclonal antibody called Mα2-3 (1). To establish the molecular basis of this specificity, we predicted from both mutational analyses and docking procedures the structure of the Mα2-3-toxin complex. From knowledge of the functional paratope and epitope, and using a double-mutation cycle procedure, we gathered evidence that Asp31 in complementarity determining region 1H is close to, and perhaps interacts with, Arg33 in the antigen. The use of this pair of proximate residues during the selection procedure yielded three models based on docking calculations. The selected models predicted the proximity of Tyr49 and/or Tyr50 in the antibody to Lys47 in the toxin. This was experimentally confirmed using another round of double-mutation cycles. The two models finally selected were submitted to energy minimization in a CHARMM22 force field, and were characterized by a root mean square deviation of 7.0 ± 2.9 A. Both models display most features of antibody-antigen structures. Since Mα2-3 also partially mimics some binding properties of nAChR, these structural features not only explain its fine specificity of recognition, but may also further clarify how toxins bind to nAChR."
