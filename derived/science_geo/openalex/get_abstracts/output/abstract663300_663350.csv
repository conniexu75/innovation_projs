https://openalex.org/W3100967665,"We present deterministic barcoding in tissue for spatial omics sequencing (DBiT-seq) for co-mapping of mRNAs and proteins in a formaldehyde-fixed tissue slide via next-generation sequencing (NGS). Parallel microfluidic channels were used to deliver DNA barcodes to the surface of a tissue slide, and crossflow of two sets of barcodes, A1-50 and B1-50, followed by ligation in situ, yielded a 2D mosaic of tissue pixels, each containing a unique full barcode AB. Application to mouse embryos revealed major tissue types in early organogenesis as well as fine features like microvasculature in a brain and pigmented epithelium in an eye field. Gene expression profiles in 10-μm pixels conformed into the clusters of single-cell transcriptomes, allowing for rapid identification of cell types and spatial distributions. DBiT-seq can be adopted by researchers with no experience in microfluidics and may find applications in a range of fields including developmental biology, cancer biology, neuroscience, and clinical pathology."

Although Tau PTM maps reveal heterogeneity across subjects, a subset of PTMs display high occupancy and frequency for AD, suggesting importance in disease. Unsupervised analyses indicate that PTMs occur in an ordered manner, leading to Tau aggregation. The processive addition and minimal set of PTMs associated with seeding activity was further defined by analysis of size-fractionated Tau. To summarize, features in the Tau protein critical for disease intervention at different stages of disease are identified, including enrichment of 0N and 4R isoforms, underrepresentation of the C terminus, an increase in negative charge in the proline-rich region (PRR), and a decrease in positive charge in the microtubule binding domain (MBD).

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with aging and results in devastating disability and diminished quality of life; its occurrence will reach epidemic proportions by 2050 if not abated. The pathological hallmarks of AD are the two proteins β-amyloid (Aβ) and Tau. Aβ forms extracellular plaques (Glenner and Wong, 1984Glenner G.G. Wong C.W.

Although many studies have shown the importance of Aβ, therapeutic efforts targeting Aβ have not been successful, shifting the focus to Tau. The discovery of dominantly inherited Tau mutations leading to frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (Poorkaj et al., 1998Poorkaj P. Bird T.D. Wijsman E. Nemens E. Garruto R.M. Anderson L. Andreadis A.

What is the evidence that tau pathology spreads through prion-like propagation?.Acta Neuropathol. Commun. 2017; 5: 99Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Since the discovery of phosphorylation and the first description of isoforms of Tau (Cleveland et al., 1977Cleveland D.W. Hwo S.Y. Kirschner M.W. Physical and chemical properties of purified tau factor and the role of tau in microtubule assembly.J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 227-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), the roles of Tau proteoforms (different chemical versions of a polypeptide) have been explored functionally (Adams et al., 2010Adams S.J. DeTure M.A. McBride M. Dickson D.W. Petrucelli L. Three repeat isoforms of tau inhibit assembly of four repeat tau filaments.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e10810Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and many of these studies have highlighted the importance of post-translational modifications (PTMs) of Tau in AD and FTD (Bramblett et al., 1993Bramblett G.T. Goedert M. Jakes R. Merrick S.E. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.

Mukherjee C. et al.Acetylation of tau inhibits its degradation and contributes to tauopathy.Neuron. 2010; 67: 953-966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). During disease progression in AD, pathological neurofibrillary Tau aggregates show a pattern of accumulation that starts in the entorhinal cortex and spreads through connected pathways to cortical areas (Jucker and Walker, 2013Jucker M. Walker L.C. Self-propagation of pathogenic protein aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases.Nature. 2013; 501: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). This encompasses a cycle that involves production of a Tau seed followed by uptake of seed-competent Tau into connected cells (Clavaguera et al., 2013Clavaguera F. Lavenir I. Falcon B. Frank S. Goedert M. Tolnay M. “Prion-like” templated misfolding in tauopathies.Brain Pathol. 2013; 23: 342-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This seeding of soluble Tau in recipient neurons and propagation of Tau aggregates by release of Tau seeds into the extracellular space (de Calignon et al., 2012de Calignon A. Polydoro M. Suárez-Calvet M. William C. Adamowicz D.H. Kopeikina K.J. Pitstick R. Sahara N. Ashe K.H. Carlson G.A. et al.Propagation of tau pathology in a model of early Alzheimer’s disease.Neuron. 2012; 73: 685-697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar) has been called prion-like (Walker et al., 2013Walker L.C. Diamond M.I. Duff K.E. Hyman B.T. Mechanisms of protein seeding in neurodegenerative diseases.JAMA Neurol. 2013; 70: 304-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that brain lysates seed Tau aggregation when high-molecular-weight (HMW) oligomeric hyperphosphorylated (AT8 and AT100) Tau species are present (Takeda et al., 2015Takeda S. Wegmann S. Cho H. DeVos S.L. Commins C. Roe A.D. Nicholls S.B. Carlson G.A. Pitstick R.

Neurosci. 2016; 36: 762-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Besides phosphorylation, the neurofibrillary aggregates are also subject to a wide range of other PTMs (Hanger et al., 2007Hanger D.P. Byers H.L. Wray S. Leung K.Y. Saxton M.J. Seereeram A. Reynolds C.H. Ward M.A. Anderton B.H. Novel phosphorylation sites in tau from Alzheimer brain support a role for casein kinase 1 in disease pathogenesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23645-23654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been hypothesized that the types of PTMs, their site-specific localization, and their extent of modification induce or mediate Tau aggregation and propagation (Cohen et al., 2011Cohen T.J. Guo J.L. Hurtado D.E. Kwong L.K. Mills I.P. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. The acetylation of tau inhibits its function and promotes pathological tau aggregation.Nat. Commun. 2011; 2: 252Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar; Alonso et al., 2001Alonso A. Zaidi T. Novak M. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Hyperphosphorylation induces self-assembly of tau into tangles of paired helical filaments/straight filaments.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 6923-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Profiling the specific molecular characteristics of pathological Tau in human AD is critical for early diagnosis and development of mechanism-directed therapies. A protein can be modified by PTMs, giving rise to different proteoforms (Smith et al., 2013Smith L.M. Kelleher N.L. Consortium for Top Down ProteomicsProteoform: a single term describing protein complexity.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10: 186-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Combinations of such PTMs are responsible for regulating and fine-tuning protein conformation and activity (Aebersold et al., 2018Aebersold R. Agar J.N. Amster I.J. Baker M.S. Bertozzi C.R. Boja E.S. Costello C.E. Cravatt B.F. Fenselau C. Garcia B.A. et al.How many human proteoforms are there?.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2018; 14: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar; Soria et al., 2014Soria P.S. McGary K.L. Rokas A. Functional divergence for every paralog.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2014; 31: 984-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and can dramatically change the function and toxicity of proteins. To effectively understand the functional significance of protein modification, all possible PTMs should be mapped from the N to the C terminus. Although several PTMs are present at basal levels in cells, not all of these are functionally significant in the context of specific pathological conditions (Singh et al., 2014Singh S.A. Winter D. Kirchner M. Chauhan R. Ahmed S. Ozlu N. Tzur A. Steen J.A. Steen H. Co-regulation proteomics reveals substrates and mechanisms of APC/C-dependent degradation.EMBO J. 2014; 33: 385-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, to understand the function of a particular PTM, it is equally important to obtain information about PTM stoichiometry. Knowledge of human Tau in disease and health is important for development of diagnostics such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET) reagents and therapeutic agents. For example, to develop a Tau PET radiotracer for detection of disease before cognitive decline, the chemical composition and abundance of pathological species at early disease stages is essential (Brosch et al., 2017Brosch J.R. Farlow M.R. Risacher S.L. Apostolova L.G. Tau Imaging in Alzheimer’s Disease Diagnosis and Clinical Trials.Neurotherapeutics. 2017; 14: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition, knowledge of the pattern of Tau PTMs on the pathologic species would allow improvement of PET reagent affinities for Tau. Defining the chemistry of the pathologic Tau proteoforms during progression of disease will allow us to target specific epitopes using therapeutic antibodies or small molecules at every stage of disease. Furthermore, the minimum set of PTMs important for oligomer formation and Tau aggregation is not known. Finally, it is not known which PTMs occur on Tau seeds that can potentiate further aggregation. The mechanistic role of PTMs in initiating Tau seeding and propagation still remains to be elucidated (Guo et al., 2017Guo T. Noble W. Hanger D.P. Roles of tau protein in health and disease.Acta Neuropathol. 2017; 133: 665-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar; Wang and Mandelkow, 2016Wang Y. Mandelkow E. Tau in physiology and pathology.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2016; 17: 5-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry has been the workhorse for identification and quantification of Tau proteoforms. Although such antibody-based approaches are simple to implement and provide semiquantitative information, they cannot accurately measure quantitative changes or determine PTM stoichiometry. Finally, all antibody-based approaches require a priori knowledge of sites and cannot be used for discovery purposes. To overcome these issues, we previously developed a targeted, high-throughput quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) method called FLEXITau (full-length expressed stable isotope-labeled Tau) (Mair et al., 2016Mair W. Muntel J. Tepper K. Tang S. Biernat J. Seeley W.W. Kosik K.S. Mandelkow E. Steen H. Steen J.A. FLEXITau: Quantifying Post-translational Modifications of Tau Protein in Vitro and in Human Disease.Anal. Chem. 2016; 88: 3704-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), which provides absolute quantification and unbiased stoichiometric information of Tau PTMs from the N to the C terminus. Tens of possible PTM sites have been described for Tau in studies involving in vitro (Hanger et al., 2007Hanger D.P. Byers H.L. Wray S. Leung K.Y. Saxton M.J. Seereeram A. Reynolds C.H.

To our knowledge, a qualitative and quantitative approach using a large cohort of human AD subjects has not been performed. Obtaining data from a large cohort of patients could allow us to understand which combinations of specific PTMs can contribute to seeding and aggregation and better understand the mechanisms of oligomer and fibril formation. Although mapping these PTMs is important, specifying the PTMs that contribute to fibril formation as well as propagation of seeding is key to prevent formation of Tau fibrils. In this study, we had multiple aims, including determining the absolute quantities (molar concentrations) of pathologic Tau in AD, providing a comprehensive map of PTMs in human AD, determining the distribution of isoforms of Tau in the pathologic and non-pathologic forms of Tau, and understanding the extent (stoichiometry) of modification and the heterogeneity of modification profiles across AD patients and control (CTR) subjects. To understand the importance of PTMs in disease, a comprehensive analysis of PTMs in a cohort requires numerous levels of information, including (1) the type of PTM, (2) PTM localization, (3) PTM frequency in the subject cohort, and (4) PTM stoichiometry. Thus, quantitative and qualitative protein profiling of human tissues (n = 91) was performed. FLEXITau and unbiased MS-based proteomics were used to characterize and map the PTM landscape of pathological Tau for AD. We then used supervised and unsupervised data analyses to determine the most relevant molecular features of Tau pathology that are important in Tau aggregation. Further, we studied size-resolved fractions of Tau to identify the minimal set of PTMs associated with seeding potential and the role of PTMs in the ontogeny of fibril formation. These qualitative and quantitative data provide key insights into the role of PTMs in the progression of disease and identification of key targets for development of therapeutic antibodies, imaging reagents, and diagnostics for AD. Multiple types of qualitative and quantitative MS analyses were employed to characterize the molecular features of Tau from the BA39 angular gyrus region in postmortem brain tissue from two cohorts with overlapping subjects comprised of 49 AD patients and 42 age-, postmortem interval (PMI)-, and sex-matched control subjects (Tables S1 and S2). The subjects were selected based on the criterion of diagnosis prior to death as being clinical AD or were asymptomatic (controls). The next criterion was definitive postmortem neuropathological final diagnosis by the respective brain banks as AD or unaffected. Selected subjects had the least possible concurrent pathologies and were assessed for Braak NFT stages (Braak and Braak, 1991Braak H. Braak E. Neuropathological stageing of Alzheimer-related changes.Acta Neuropathol. 1991; 82: 239-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (10648) Google Scholar), as determined by the location of NFTs with total Tau immunostaining and Bielschowsky’s silver stain. Inclusion in the study required a high-confidence postmortem neuropathological diagnosis of AD, based on relevant criteria (Montine et al., 2016Montine T.J. Monsell S.E. Beach T.G. Bigio E.H. Bu Y.

Principal-component analysis (PCA) analysis did not show any effect of age, PMI, or sex on the Tau PTM profiles for both cohorts (Figure S1). The angular gyrus was selected as a brain region of intermediate pathology in the end stage of disease without a large amount of neuronal loss. To determine whether similar Tau PTMs and quantitative profiles were observed in other affected brain regions, we analyzed the molecular features of Tau from the frontal gyrus (BA46) region in 9 control and 10 AD patients (Table S2) using complementary analysis. A schematic overview of cohort selection, sample preparation, and MS analysis is shown in Figure 1A. The data and subsequent analyses showed that the highest-frequency PTMs, isoform distributions, and quantitative profiles of the BA46 region are shared between the two brain regions (see below and Figure S2).Figure 1Molecular Characterization of the Isoform Distribution and PTMs of Sarkosyl-Soluble and Insoluble Tau Extracted from Postmortem Angular Gyrus (BA39) Tissues from AD and Healthy Controls (CTR)Show full caption(A) Schematic overview of the study and workflow.(B) Total absolute insoluble Tau abundance, quantified by FLEXITau, is significantly higher in AD than in controls (t test) whereas the soluble Tau counterpart is lower in AD than in controls (t test).(C) Isoform composition of sarkosyl-insoluble Tau from human angular gyrus tissue shows that pathogenic Tau aggregates are predominately composed of the 0N and 1N isoforms (yellow boxplot) and 4R isoform (blue boxplot) across the tauopathy disease spectrum, whereas 1N and 4R are the predominant forms in the sarkosyl-soluble fraction.

(F) The patient frequencies of PTMs from the N to the C terminus of Tau show a wide range of frequencies from 2%–90% for AD. Some high-frequency sites are known AD epitopes, such as the 202–205 phosphorylation site (AT8 antibody), pinpointing important PTM-specific sites. Interestingly, some of the-high frequency PTMs, particularly in the MBD, have not been described as being important for pathological Tau. Antibodies commonly used in Tau biology are annotated, and antibodies used for pathology diagnosis are depicted in brown. FLEXITau heatmaps of median peptide modification extent are overlayed with the frequency data to evaluate the stoichiometry of PTMs. p-value: ∗∗∗∗p<0.0001; ∗∗∗p<0.001; ∗∗p<0.01; ∗p<0.1. A) The isoforms observed in the sarkosyl insoluble Tau from human BA46 tissue is similar to that observed in BA39 angular gyrus tissue (see also Figure 1B). Pathogenic Tau aggregates in AD are predominately composed of 0N and 1N isoforms (yellow boxplot) and the 4R isoform (blue boxplot) in both brain regions. Peptides were quantified using heavy-isotope labeled isoform-specific peptides, and an ANOVA analysis (Kruskal-Wallis) was performed using the Dunn’s test for multiple comparisons.

https://openalex.org/W3098500959,"Interactions between the thalamus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) play a critical role in cognitive function and arousal. Here, we use anatomical tracing, electrophysiology, optogenetics, and 2-photon Ca2+ imaging to determine how ventromedial (VM) and mediodorsal (MD) thalamus target specific cell types and subcellular compartments in layer 1 (L1) of mouse PFC. We find thalamic inputs make distinct connections in L1, where VM engages neuron-derived neurotrophic factor (NDNF+) cells in L1a and MD drives vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP+) cells in L1b. These separate populations of L1 interneurons participate in different inhibitory networks in superficial layers by targeting either parvalbumin (PV+) or somatostatin (SOM+) interneurons. NDNF+ cells also inhibit the apical dendrites of L5 pyramidal tract (PT) cells to suppress action potential (AP)-evoked Ca2+ signals. Lastly, NDNF+ cells mediate a unique form of thalamus-evoked inhibition at PT cells, selectively blocking VM-evoked dendritic Ca2+ spikes. Together, our findings reveal how two thalamic nuclei differentially communicate with the PFC through distinct L1 micro-circuits."

Dysregulated RNP granules drive neuromuscular degenerative disease but have not previously been linked to heart failure. By exploring the molecular basis of congenital dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in genome-edited pigs homozygous for an RBM20 allele encoding the pathogenic R636S variant of human RNA-binding motif protein-20 (RBM20), we discovered that RNP granules accumulated abnormally in the sarcoplasm, and we confirmed this finding in myocardium and reprogrammed cardiomyocytes from patients with DCM carrying the R636S allele. Dysregulated sarcoplasmic RBM20 RNP granules displayed liquid-like material properties, docked at precisely spaced intervals along cytoskeletal elements, promoted phase partitioning of cardiac biomolecules and fused with stress granules. Our results link dysregulated RNP granules to myocardial cellular pathobiology and heart failure in gene-edited pigs and patients with DCM caused by RBM20 mutation."
https://openalex.org/W3102171959,"Single-cell RNA-sequencing and in vivo functional imaging provide expansive but disconnected views of neuronal diversity. Here, we developed a strategy for linking these modes of classification to explore molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for detecting and encoding touch. By broadly mapping function to neuronal class, we uncovered a clear transcriptomic logic responsible for the sensitivity and selectivity of mammalian mechanosensory neurons. Notably, cell types with divergent gene-expression profiles often shared very similar properties, but we also discovered transcriptomically related neurons with specialized and divergent functions. Applying our approach to knockout mice revealed that Piezo2 differentially tunes all types of mechanosensory neurons with marked cell-class dependence. Together, our data demonstrate how mechanical stimuli recruit characteristic ensembles of transcriptomically defined neurons, providing rules to help explain the discriminatory power of touch. We anticipate a similar approach could expose fundamental principles governing representation of information throughout the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W3102859773,"RNA viruses are among the most prevalent pathogens and are a major burden on society. Although RNA viruses have been studied extensively, little is known about the processes that occur during the first several hours of infection because of a lack of sensitive assays. Here we develop a single-molecule imaging assay, virus infection real-time imaging (VIRIM), to study translation and replication of individual RNA viruses in live cells. VIRIM uncovered a striking heterogeneity in replication dynamics between cells and revealed extensive coordination between translation and replication of single viral RNAs. Furthermore, using VIRIM, we identify the replication step of the incoming viral RNA as a major bottleneck of successful infection and identify host genes that are responsible for inhibition of early virus replication. Single-molecule imaging of virus infection is a powerful tool to study virus replication and virus-host interactions that may be broadly applicable to RNA viruses."
https://openalex.org/W3102037370,"We present a high-resolution cross-disciplinary analysis of kinship structure and social institutions in two Late Copper Age Bell Beaker culture cemeteries of South Germany containing 24 and 18 burials, of which 34 provided genetic information. By combining archaeological, anthropological, genetic and isotopic evidence we are able to document the internal kinship and residency structure of the cemeteries and the socially organizing principles of these local communities. The buried individuals represent four to six generations of two family groups, one nuclear family at the Alburg cemetery, and one seemingly more extended at Irlbach. While likely monogamous, they practiced exogamy, as six out of eight non-locals are women. Maternal genetic diversity is high with 23 different mitochondrial haplotypes from 34 individuals, whereas all males belong to one single Y-chromosome haplogroup without any detectable contribution from Y-chromosomes typical of the farmers who had been the sole inhabitants of the region hundreds of years before. This provides evidence for the society being patrilocal, perhaps as a way of protecting property among the male line, while in-marriage from many different places secured social and political networks and prevented inbreeding. We also find evidence that the communities practiced selection for which of their children (aged 0–14 years) received a proper burial, as buried juveniles were in all but one case boys, suggesting the priority of young males in the cemeteries. This is plausibly linked to the exchange of foster children as part of an expansionist kinship system which is well attested from later Indo-European-speaking cultural groups."
https://openalex.org/W3105252786,"We present a new test–the UNSW Face Test ( www.unswfacetest.com )–that has been specifically designed to screen for super-recognizers in large online cohorts and is available free for scientific use. Super-recognizers are people that demonstrate sustained performance in the very top percentiles in tests of face identification ability. Because they represent a small proportion of the population, screening large online cohorts is an important step in their initial recruitment, before confirmatory testing via standardized measures and more detailed cognitive testing. We provide normative data on the UNSW Face Test from 3 cohorts tested via the internet (combined n = 23,902) and 2 cohorts tested in our lab (combined n = 182). The UNSW Face Test: (i) captures both identification memory and perceptual matching, as confirmed by correlations with existing tests of these abilities; (ii) captures face-specific perceptual and memorial abilities, as confirmed by non-significant correlations with non-face object processing tasks; (iii) enables researchers to apply stricter selection criteria than other available tests, which boosts the average accuracy of the individuals selected in subsequent testing. Together, these properties make the test uniquely suited to screening for super-recognizers in large online cohorts."
https://openalex.org/W3105015899,"Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) is a global indicator of mitochondrial function. Previous reports on heterogeneity of ΔΨm were qualitative or semiquantitative. Here, we quantified intercellular differences in ΔΨm in unsynchronized human cancer cells, cells synchronized in G1, S, and G2, and human fibroblasts. We assessed ΔΨm using a two-pronged microscopy approach to measure relative fluorescence of tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) and absolute values of ΔΨm. We showed that ΔΨm is more heterogeneous in cancer cells compared to fibroblasts, and it is maintained throughout the cell cycle. The effect of chemical inhibition of the respiratory chain and ATP synthesis differed between basal, low and high ΔΨm cells. Overall, our results showed that intercellular heterogeneity of ΔΨm is mainly modulated by intramitochondrial factors, it is independent of the ΔΨm indicator and it is not correlated with intercellular heterogeneity of plasma membrane potential or the phases of the cell cycle."

The direct detection (physical sighting) of individuals is required to improve conservation management strategies. We provide a comparative assessment of three survey methods for the direct detection of koalas: systematic spotlighting (Spotlight), remotely piloted aircraft system thermal imaging (RPAS), and the refined diurnal radial search component of the spot assessment technique (SAT). Each survey method was repeated on the same morning with independent observers (03:00–12:00 hrs) for a total of 10 survey occasions at sites with fixed boundaries (28–76 ha) in Port Stephens ( n = 6) and Gilead ( n = 1) in New South Wales between May and July 2019. Koalas were directly detected on 22 occasions during 7 of 10 comparative surveys (Spotlight: n = 7; RPAS: n = 14; and SAT: n = 1), for a total of 12 unique individuals (Spotlight: n = 4; RPAS: n = 11; SAT: n = 1). In 3 of 10 comparative surveys no koalas were detected. Detection probability was 38.9 ± 20.03% for Spotlight, 83.3 ± 11.39% for RPAS and 4.2 ± 4.17% for SAT. Effective detectability per site was 1 ± 0.44 koalas per 6.75 ± 1.03 hrs for Spotlight (1 koala per 6.75 hrs), 2 ± 0.38 koalas per 4.35 ± 0.28 hrs for RPAS (1 koala per 2.18 hrs) and 0.14 ± 0.14 per 6.20 ± 0.93 hrs for SAT (1 koala per 43.39 hrs). RPAS thermal imaging technology appears to offer an efficient method to directly survey koalas comparative to Spotlight and SAT and has potential as a valuable conservation tool to inform on-ground management of declining koala populations."
https://openalex.org/W3100233064,"Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), which is a heterodimeric tetramer composed of RRM1 and RRM2 subunits, is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) and essential for both DNA replication and the repair of DNA damage. The activity of RNR is coordinated with the cell cycle and regulated by fluctuations in the level of the RRM2 subunit. Multiple cancer types, including Ewing sarcoma tumors, are sensitive to inhibitors of RNR or a reduction in the levels of either the RRM1 or RRM2 subunits of RNR. Here, we show that the expression of the RRM2 protein is dependent on active protein synthesis and that 4E-BP1, a repressor of cap-dependent protein translation, specifically regulates the level of the RRM2 protein. Furthermore, inhibition of mTORC1/2, but not mTORC1, activates 4E-BP1, inhibits protein synthesis, and reduces the level of the RRM2 protein in multiple sarcoma cell lines. This effect of mTORC1/2 inhibitors on protein synthesis and RRM2 levels was rescued in cell lines with the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of 4E-BP1. In addition, the inducible expression of a mutant 4E-BP1 protein that cannot be phosphorylated by mTOR blocked protein synthesis and inhibited the growth of Ewing sarcoma cells in vitro and in vivo in a xenograft. Overall, these results provide insight into the multifaceted regulation of RRM2 protein levels and identify a regulatory link between protein translation and DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W3101590382,"Aim The optimal surgical management strategy for para-aortic lymph node (PALN) metastasis has not attracted as much attention as surgery for liver or lung metastasis. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the oncologic outcomes after synchronous resection of PALN metastasis in left-sided colon and rectal cancer. Methods Between January 1986 and August 2016, 29 patients with pathologically positive PALN metastases who underwent curative resection at our hospital were retrospectively reviewed. We examined clinicopathological characteristics, long-term oncologic outcomes, and factors related to favorable prognosis in these patients. Results The 3-year overall survival and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were 50.5% and 17.2%, respectively. In total, 6 (20.7%) patients experienced no recurrence in the 3 years after surgery, while postoperative complications were seen in 9 (31.0%) patients. The 3-year RFS rate was significantly better in the pM1a group than in the pM1b/pM1c group (26.3% and 0.0%, respectively, p = 0.032). Conclusion PALN dissection for patients without other organ metastases in left-sided colon or rectal cancer is a good indication as it is for liver and lung metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W3099651662,"Chlamydia abortus is one of the most commonly diagnosed causes of infectious abortion in small ruminants worldwide. Control of the disease (Enzootic Abortion of Ewes or EAE) is achieved using the commercial live, attenuated C . abortus 1B vaccine strain, which can be distinguished from virulent wild-type (wt) strains by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. Published studies applying this typing method and whole-genome sequence analyses to cases of EAE in vaccinated and non-vaccinated animals have provided strong evidence that the 1B strain is not attenuated and can infect the placenta causing disease in some ewes. Therefore, the objective of this study was to characterise the lesions found in the placentas of ewes vaccinated with the 1B strain and to compare these to those resulting from a wt infection. A C . abortus -free flock of multiparous adult ewes was vaccinated twice, over three breeding seasons, each before mating, with the commercial C . abortus 1B vaccine strain (Cevac® Chlamydia, Ceva Animal Health Ltd.). In the second lambing season following vaccination, placentas (n = 117) were collected at parturition and analysed by C . abortus -specific real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Two placentas, from a single ewe, which gave birth to live twin lambs, were found to be positive by qPCR and viable organisms were recovered and identified as vaccine type (vt) by PCR-RFLP, with no evidence of any wt strain being present. All cotyledons from the vt-infected placentas were analysed by histopathology and immunohistochemistry and compared to those from wt-infected placentas. Both vt-infected placentas showed lesions typical of those found in a wt infection in terms of their severity, distribution, and associated intensity of antigen labelling. These results conclusively demonstrate that the 1B strain can infect the placenta, producing typical EAE placental lesions that are indistinguishable from those found in wt infected animals."

In the absence of this benefit, the light refracting and immunoprotective tear film on eyes would collapse. Premature collapse, coupled with chronic inflammation compromising visual acuity, is a hallmark of dry eye disease affecting 7 to 10% of individuals worldwide. Although collapse seems independent of mutation (unlike newborn lung alveoli), selective proteome and possible lipidome changes have been noted. These include elevated tissue transglutaminase and consequent inactivation through C-terminal cross-linking of the tear mitogen lacritin, leading to significant loss of lacritin monomer. Lacritin monomer restores homeostasis via autophagy and mitochondrial fusion and promotes basal tearing. Here, we discover that lacritin monomer C-terminal processing, inclusive of cysteine, serine, and metalloproteinase activity, generates cationic amphipathic α-helical proteoforms. Such proteoforms (using synthetic peptide surrogates) act like alveolar surfactant proteins to rapidly bind and stabilize the tear lipid layer. Immunodepletion of C- but not N-terminal proteoforms nor intact lacritin, from normal human tears promotes loss of stability akin to human dry eye tears. Stability of these and dry eye tears is rescuable with C- but not N-terminal proteoforms. Repeated topical application in rabbits reveals a proteoform turnover time of 7 to 33 h with gradual loss from human tear lipid that retains bioactivity without further processing. Thus, the processed C-terminus of lacritin that is deficient or absent in dry eye tears appears to play a key role in preventing tear film collapse and as a natural slow release mechanism that restores epithelial homeostasis.

To gain insight into premature tear film collapse and whether lacritin deficiency in dry eye may be contributory, Langmuir surface balance studies were performed. Such studies are performed in a “Langmuir-Blodgett trough” consisting of a shallow (225 cm2) reservoir of PBS (40 ml) with surface tear film that is compressed or expanded by symmetric movement of opposing barriers. As area changes, surface pressure is monitored by a Wilhelmy wire probe with sensitivity exceeding 0.01 mN/m. Surface pressure represents the surface tension of the buffer minus the surface tension of the film. We floated onto PBS normal human tears (3 μl) pooled from over 50 different individuals, or the same tear pools passed over immobilized anti-C-term lacritin antibodies (C-term depleted; Fig. S1A), or over a preimmune Ig column (Fig. 1C; mock depleted). Each was subjected to compression and expansion isocycling (Fig. 1C, right) that mimics blinking. Isocycling is the synchronized repeated inward or outward movement of barriers at constant speed. Isocycling was performed at 35 °C, the surface temperature of the human eye (36Abreau K. Callan C. Kottaiyan R. Zhang A. Yoon G. Aquavella J.V. Zavislan J. Hindman H.B. Temperatures of the ocular surface, lid, and periorbital regions of Sjögren’s, evaporative, and aqueous-deficient dry eyes relative to normals.Ocul. Surf. 2016; 14: 64-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Normal and mock depleted films (Fig. 1, D–E) were more stable as per a higher “lift off” area (∼50%; Fig. 1D(i), D inset, right) and maximum surface pressure (∼25 mN/m; Fig. 1D(ii), D inset, left) achieved with compression. “Lift off” is when surface pressure first reaches 1 mN/m as compression progressively reduces film area (37Brown R.E. Brockman H.L. Using monomolecular films to characterize lipid lateral interactions.Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 398: 41-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)—an indicator of the capability of film constituents to restructure at the interface. Maximum surface pressure is when constituents are the most densely compressed in a stable film. Tears lacking lacritin were less resistant to compression (respectively ∼25% and ∼15–20 mN/m; Fig. 1D (i and ii), D inset, right and left) and expansion (Fig. 1E). Film stability is considered in terms of molecular packing density at the interface (38Brockman H. Lipid monolayers: why use half a membrane to characterize protein-membrane interactions?.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Normal basal tears contain different forms of lacritin as monomer, polymer, and proteoforms (26Velez V.,F. Romano J.A.

Vis. Sci. 2013; 54: 2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) - of which five N- and 42 different C-terminal proteoforms have been detected to date by top-down mass spectrometry ((30Azkargorta M.

Lacritin dimers, trimers, and larger polymers are attributable to cross-linking by tear tissue transglutaminase, a calcium-dependent glutamine γ-glutamyltransferase that is active in normal tears (26Velez V.,F. Romano J.A. McKown R.L. Green K. Zhang L. Raab R.W. Ryan D.S. Hutnik C.M.L. Frierson Jr., H.F. Laurie G.W. Tissue transglutaminase is a negative regulator of monomeric lacritin bioactivity.Invest.

Which form of lacritin contributes to tear film stability? Anti-C-term lacritin antibody detects lacritin monomer, polymer, and C-terminal proteoforms—but not N-terminal proteoforms. Anti-N-term lacritin antibody 1F5 detects N-terminal proteoforms, monomer, and polymer, but not C-terminal proteoforms (Fig. 1A; (26Velez V.,F. Romano J.A. McKown R.L. Green K. Zhang L. Raab R.W. Ryan D.S. Hutnik C.M.L. Frierson Jr., H.F. Laurie G.W. Tissue transglutaminase is a negative regulator of monomeric lacritin bioactivity.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2013; 54: 2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar)). We subjected normal human tears to 1F5 immunodepletion (Fig. 1C; Fig. S1A). Film stability under compression was unaffected per “lift off” area (∼48%; Fig. 1D(i), D inset, right) and maximum surface pressure (∼26 mN/m; Fig. 1D(ii), D inset, left) suggesting that C-terminal proteoforms maybe contributory. To test this possibility, we synthesized C-terminal synthetic peptides “N-94,” “N-94/C-6,” and “N-64/C-31” that together span all detected C-terminal proteoforms in tears (Fig. 1A) and therefore serve as surrogates. N-terminal 24 amino acid peptide “C-95” lacking 95 C-terminal amino acids (Fig. 1A) was included as a negative control. “N-94” represents lacritin's C-terminal 25 amino acids with two amphipathic α-helices and a six amino acid C-terminal random coil domain, whereas “N-94/C-6” lacks the latter. “N-64/C-31” is a more internal amphipathic α-helix ((29McKown R.L.

In total, 6 μM is the suspected concentration of C-terminal lacritin proteoforms in human basal tears, versus ∼18 to 27 μM for all anti-Pep Lac N-Term detectable lacritin (39Karnati R. Laurie D.E.

N-94 and N-94/C-6 (“lift off” area: 41 and 49%, [Fig. 1, G–H]; maximum surface pressure: 23 and 24 mN/m; respectively) largely restored film stability under compression (Fig. 1, G–H) and expansion (Fig. S1B). Not beneficial were N-64/C-31 and C-95 (“lift off” area: 23 and 21%; maximum surface pressure: 17 and 11 mN/m (Fig. 1, G–H). Lacritin monomer is selectively deficient in tears of almost all forms of dry eye (reviewed by Willcox et al. (40Willcox M.D.P. Argüeso P. Georgiev G.A. Holopainen J.M. Laurie G.W. Millar T.J.

Are C-terminal proteoforms also lacking, and if so is their absence contributory to tear film instability? Dry eye is generally most severe in Sjögren's syndrome, an autoimmune form of dry eye disease (41McNamara N.A. Ge S. Lee S.M. Enghauser A.M. Kuehl L. Chen F.Y.-T. Gallup M. McKown R.L. Reduced levels of tear lacritin are associated with corneal neuropathy in patients with the ocular component of sjögren’s syndrome.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2016; 57: 5237Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We tested basal tears from 21 normal or 21 non-Sjögren's dry eye individuals (Fig. 1J (i)) and tears collected without anesthesia from 21 Secondary Sjögren's syndrome dry eye patients (Fig. 1J (ii)). C-terminal proteoforms and monomer were deficient or absent in most non-Sjögren's and Sjögren's syndrome dry eye tears (Fig. 1J). Sjögren's syndrome samples were kindly provided by the Sjögren's International Collaborative Alliance for which volume was limiting. Non-Sjögren's dry eye tears (from the Warfighter Refractive Eye Surgery Program and Research Center, Fort Belvoir VA) were sufficient for compression and expansion isocycling. Compression values (“lift-off” area 26% [Fig. 1, H–I]; highest surface pressure 15%; Fig. 1I) were essentially identical to anti-C-term lacritin-depleted normal tears, as was the benefit of supplementation with 6 μM N-94 or N-94/C-6 (42–43% [Fig. 1, H–I] and 21–22 mN/m; Fig. 1I). Similar benefit was apparent in expansion profiles (Fig. S1B). Thus, lacritin C-terminal proteoforms, but not apparently lacritin monomeric or polymeric forms, lower tear sur"

The objective of this study was to compare the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit 7-item (CAM-ICU-7) and the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) as measures of the spectrum of delirium severity in critically ill adult patients. Methods In this cross-sectional study, 218 patients underwent 641 paired assessments by bedside nurses (ICDSC, as per usual care) and trained research assistants (CAM-ICU-7). Correlation between the CAM-ICU-7 and ICDSC scores was evaluated. Logistic regression was used to explore associations between CAM-ICU-7 or ICDSC score and length of ICU stay and mechanical ventilation (receipt, ≥96 hours). Results Delirium prevalence evaluated by the CAM-ICU-7 and ICDSC were 46.3% (95% CI:39.7–53.0) and 34.4% (95% CI:28.3–41.0). Prevalence of less than clinical threshold symptoms of delirium evaluated by the CAM-ICU-7 (score: 1–2) and ICDSC (score: 1–3) were 30.3% (95%CI:24.5–36.7) and 50.9% (95%CI:44.3–57.6). The CAM-ICU-7 and ICDSC had significant positive correlation (0.58, p&lt;0.001). Agreement between the tools as measures of delirium was moderate (kappa = 0.51) and as measures of less than clinical threshold symptoms of delirium was fair (kappa = 0.21). Less than clinical threshold symptoms of delirium identified by the ICDSC, not CAM-ICU-7, were associated with prolonged length of ICU stay (≥7 days) in patients &lt;65 years of age [Odds Ratio (OR) 9.2, 95% CI:2.5–34.0] and mechanical ventilation (receipt: OR 2.8, 95% CI:1.3–6.4; ≥96 hours: OR 6.6, 95% CI:1.9–22.9), when compared to patients with no delirium. Conclusions The CAM-ICU-7 and ICDSC are measures of the spectrum of delirium severity that are closely correlated. Less than clinical threshold symptoms of delirium measure by the ICDSC is a better predictor of outcomes, when compared with the CAM-ICU-7."
https://openalex.org/W3099122391,"Background Lebanon boosts one of the highest pharmacists to population ratios globally (20.3/10,000). Yet, workforce analysis elicited serious concerns with the distribution, practice environments and regulation of Lebanese pharmacists. Recent workforce data shows that the profession has been majorly destabilized with hundreds of pharmacists closing their pharmacies or losing their employment. Proper planning for the future of the pharmacy profession in Lebanon necessitates a deeper understanding of the current challenges and the necessary policy and practice recommendations. The aim of this study is to examine stakeholders’ perspectives on the current pharmacist workforce challenges and the necessary measures to support the profession. Methods The research team carried out a series of semi-structured interviews with twenty-one key stakeholders within the pharmacy profession in Lebanon. We categorized stakeholders according to their experience as policy makers, practitioners, academicians, and media experts. The interview guide included questions about workforce trends, labor market challenges and recommendations for improvement. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed thematically. Results Four major themes emerged from this study: the oversupply of pharmacists in Lebanon, the demand supply imbalance, poor regulation of the pharmacy practice, and the difficult practice environment. There was a consensus among interviewees that the oversupply of pharmacists is due to the poor workforce planning and weak regulatory framework, combined with the easy integration of foreign-trained pharmacists into the labor market. The lack of coordination between the educational and practice sectors is further widening the demand-supply gap. Interviewees further revealed that the regulatory policies on pharmacy practice were outdated and/or weakly enforced which increases the risk of unethical practices and erodes the image of pharmacists in the society. With respect to the practice environment, there is an ongoing struggle by Lebanese pharmacists to maintain profitability and exercise their full scope of practice. Conclusion The poor pharmacy workforce planning and regulation is significantly weakening the pharmacy profession in Lebanon. A concerted effort between the various stakeholders is necessary to enhance workforce planning, regulate supply, optimize the integration of pharmacists into work sectors of need, and improve the financial and professional wellbeing of pharmacists in Lebanon."
https://openalex.org/W3105038088,"Purpose To predict the anterior chamber volume (ACV) after implantable collamer lens (ICL) implantation based on ICL size and parameters of anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT). Design Retrospective study. Methods This study included 222 eyes of 222 patients who underwent ICL implantation at Nagoya Eye Clinic. The patients were divided into two groups: prediction group, for creating the prediction equation (148 eyes, mean age: 32.11 ± 8.04 years), and verification group, for verifying the equation (74 eyes, mean age: 33.03 ± 6.74 years). The angle opening distance (AOD), anterior chamber width (ACW), ACV, anterior chamber depth, lens vault, angle-to-angle distance, angle recess area, and trabecular iris space area were calculated using AS-OCT. A stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed. After the creation of the prediction equation, its accuracy was verified in the verification group. Results The ACV, AOD750, ACW, and ICL size were selected as explanatory variables to predict postoperative ACV. Mean predicted (114.2 ± 21.83 mm 3 ) and actual postoperative ACVs (116.1 ± 25.41 mm 3 ) were not significantly different (P = 0.269); absolute error was 10.59 ± 9.13 mm 3 . In addition, there was high correlation between actual and predictive ACV (adjusted R 2 = 0.6996, p &lt; 0.0001). Bland-Altman plot revealed that there was no addition or proportional error between predicted and actual postoperative ACV. Conclusion Postoperative ACV was accurately predicted using AS-OCT parameters and ICL size. This prediction equation may be useful for making decisions regarding ICL size."
https://openalex.org/W3098534690,"Tubby-like proteins (TULPs) are characterized by a conserved C-terminal domain that binds phosphoinositides. Collectively, mammalian TULP1-4 proteins play essential roles in intracellular transport, cell differentiation, signaling, and motility. Yet, little is known about how the function of these proteins is regulated in cells. Here, we present the protein–protein interaction network of TULP3, a protein that is responsible for the trafficking of G-protein-coupled receptors to cilia and whose aberrant expression is associated with severe developmental disorders and polycystic kidney disease. We identify several protein interaction nodes linked to TULP3 that include enzymes involved in acetylation and ubiquitination. We show that acetylation of two key lysine residues on TULP3 by p300 increases TULP3 protein abundance and that deacetylation of these sites by HDAC1 decreases protein levels. Furthermore, we show that one of these sites is ubiquitinated in the absence of acetylation and that acetylation inversely correlates with ubiquitination of TULP3. This mechanism is evidently conserved across species and is active in zebrafish during development. Finally, we identify this same regulatory module in TULP1, TULP2, and TULP4 and demonstrate that the stability of these proteins is similarly modulated by an acetylation switch.

Nishina P.M. Naggert J.K. The tubby-like proteins, a family with roles in neuronal development and function.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 9-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This domain consists of a central alpha helix enclosed by a beta barrel structure and includes two amino acids (Lys330 and Arg332) that coordinate binding to membrane phosphoinositides such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5,-bisphosphate (PIP2) through an electrostatic interaction (7Santagata S. Boggon T.J. Baird C.L. Gomez C.A. Zhao J. Shan W.S. Myszka D.G. Shapiro L. G-protein signaling through tubby proteins.Science. 2001; 292: 2041-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The N-terminal regions of TUB and TULP homologs are variable and may be divided into three distinct classes: (1) those containing WD40 domains and/or suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) motifs, (2) those without any apparent domains/motifs, and (3) those containing F-box domains (8Wang M. Xu Z. Kong Y. The tubby-like proteins kingdom in animals and plants.Gene. 2018; 642: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). TUB/TULPs carry out a diverse range of important physiological functions ranging from biotic and abiotic stress defense in plants to regulation of cell metabolism, intracellular transport, and neural differentiation in animals (8Wang M. Xu Z. Kong Y. The tubby-like proteins kingdom in animals and plants.Gene. 2018; 642: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Mutations in these genes have been associated with numerous conditions including impaired development (9Ikeda A. Ikeda S. Gridley T. Nishina P.M. Naggert J.K.

TULP3 is distributed equally in nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments, while TULP1 is localized to the inner segment of photoreceptors, and TULP2–TULP4 are predominately cytoplasmic (4Mukhopadhyay S.

Furthermore, nephron-specific TULP3 knockout mice develop cystic kidneys (11Legue E. Liem Jr., K.F. Tulp3 is a ciliary trafficking gene that regulates polycystic kidney disease.Curr.

These striking phenotypes have been attributed to improper trafficking of membrane proteins to cilia caused by TULP3 deletion (4Mukhopadhyay S. Jackson P.K. The tubby family proteins.Genome Biol. 2011; 12: 225Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The N-terminus of TULP3 contains a conserved helix that interacts with the IFT-A complex, a component of intraflagellar transport (IFT) particles, which are required to assemble cilia and for trafficking inside cilia (4Mukhopadhyay S. Jackson P.K. The tubby family proteins.Genome Biol. 2011; 12: 225Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 22Han S. Miyoshi K. Shikada S. Amano G. Wang Y. Yoshimura T. Katayama T.

TULP3 bridges the IFT-A complex and membrane phosphoinositides to promote trafficking of G protein-coupled receptors into primary cilia.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 2180-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). With the IFT-A complex, TULP3 acts as an adaptor for the transport of at least 16 class A cilia-targeted G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) including melanin-concentrating hormone receptor, neuropeptide Y receptors, and GPR161, a repressor of sonic hedgehog signaling (24Badgandi H.B. Hwang S.H. Shimada I.S. Loriot E. Mukhopadhyay S. Tubby family proteins are adapters for ciliary trafficking of integral membrane proteins.J. Cell Biol. 2017; 216: 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). TULP3-IFT-A is also responsible for the ciliary transport of other integral membrane proteins such as the Polycistin 1/2 complex, which is implicated in polycystic kidney disease (PKD) (24Badgandi H.B. Hwang S.H. Shimada I.S. Loriot E. Mukhopadhyay S. Tubby family proteins are adapters for ciliary trafficking of integral membrane proteins.J. Cell Biol. 2017; 216: 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Three steps have been proposed for how this transport occurs: (1) capture of membrane cargo by TULP3 in a PIP2-dependent manner, (2) association with IFT-A and transport to cilia, and (3) release into a PIP2-deficient ciliary membrane (24Badgandi H.B. Hwang S.H. Shimada I.S. Loriot E. Mukhopadhyay S. Tubby family proteins are adapters for ciliary trafficking of integral membrane proteins.J. Cell Biol. 2017; 216: 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Inpp5e, an enzyme that hydrolyzes the 5ʹ phosphate from PIP2, has been shown to reduce TULP3 and GPR161 localization to cilia, indicating that low levels of PIP2 are required to anchor these proteins in place (25Garcia-Gonzalo F.R. Phua S.C. Roberson E.C. Garcia 3rd, G. Abedin M. Schurmans S. Inoue T. Reiter J.F. Phosphoinositides regulate ciliary protein trafficking to modulate hedgehog signaling.Dev. Cell. 2015; 34: 400-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). TULP3 contains a nuclear localization sequence that overlaps with its IFT-A binding region (4Mukhopadhyay S. Jackson P.K. The tubby family proteins.Genome Biol. 2011; 12: 225Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that hydrolysis of PIP2 induces relocalization of TULP3 to the nucleus (8Wang M. Xu Z. Kong Y. The tubby-like proteins kingdom in animals and plants.Gene. 2018; 642: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). While some evidence suggests that TULP3 and other TULPs might have the ability to directly bind DNA and act as transcription factors, their function in the nucleus is unclear (26Boggon T.J. Shan W.S. Santagata S. Myers S.C. Shapiro L. Implication of tubby proteins as transcription factors by structure-based functional analysis.Science. 1999; 286: 2119-2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Moreover, little is known about how the localization, stability, and activity of tubby-like proteins might be regulated. Here, we use Immunoprecipitation–Mass Spectrometry (IP-MS) to catalog the entire protein interaction network of TULP3. In addition to confirming previously validated interactions, we identify many new putative interactors, including enzymes such as SIRT1 and HDAC1 and Cullin-3, which regulate lysine acetylation (27Hubbard B.P. Loh C. Gomes A.P. Li J. Lu Q. Doyle T.L. Disch J.S. Armour S.M. Ellis J.L. Vlasuk G.P. Sinclair D.A.

Rep. 2017; 7: 45047Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and ubiquitination (29Dubiel W. Dubiel D. Wolf D.A. Naumann M. Cullin 3-based ubiquitin ligases as master regulators of mammalian cell differentiation.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2018; 43: 95-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), respectively. We find that acetylation of TULP3 by p300 on several key residues including Lys316 and Lys389 increases its protein stability, while deacetylation by HDAC1 decreases TULP3 protein levels through a pathway involving proteasomal degradation. We use LC-MS/MS to map the ubiquitination sites on TULP3 and identify one site (Lys316) that can support either acetylation or ubiquitination and show that TULP3 ubiquitination correlates inversely with acetylation. We establish that this regulatory mechanism is active in zebrafish during embryonic development. Highlighting the fundamental importance of this regulatory pathway, we find that some of these lysine residues are partially conserved and that Lys389 is fully conserved throughout all members of the tubby-like protein family in mammals. We show that TULP1, TULP2, and TULP4 protein levels are regulated by a parallel lysine acetylation switch. These data help define a new posttranslational regulatory pathway that facilitates rapid cross talk between chromatin modulating enzymes in the nucleus and membrane-bound receptors in cilia via TULP3. Additionally, through the application of small-molecule p300 and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, this study presents a framework for future therapeutic applications by illustrating how the stability of all tubby-like proteins can be altered using drugs. To better understand the biological role of TULP3 in the nucleus and to identify potential regulatory mechanisms for this protein, we performed an IP-MS experiment to profile its protein interactome. We transfected HEK293T cells with either mock-FLAG or FLAG-TULP3 and immunoprecipitated the resulting complexes using anti-FLAG coated beads (Fig. 1A). After identifying proteins in the IPs by mass spectrometry (Supplemental File 1; tabs 1,2), we generated a high-confidence list of TULP3 interactors by removing proteins present in the mock-FLAG IP as well as proteins having high average spectral counts of >2.1 in the CRAPome database (30Mellacheruvu D.

We used the top 35 of these 221 hits, ordered by Protein Score, to generate a STRING (31Szklarczyk D. Gable A.L. Lyon D. Junge A. Wyder S. Huerta-Cepas J. Simonovic M. Doncheva N.T. Morris J.H.

This analysis revealed several nodes containing proteins involved in the IFT-A complex, nucleic acid repair, transcription, and splicing, mediators of cell signaling, and components of the Cullin-3 RING ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL-3) (32Fouad S.

Of particular interest, we also identified interactions with several nuclear lysine deacetylase enzymes including SIRT1 and HDAC1 (27Hubbard B.P. Loh C. Gomes A.P. Li J. Lu Q. Doyle T.L. Disch J.S.

Subsequently, we validated the results from our mass spectrometry screen by performing coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) followed by western blot. We confirmed that FLAG-TULP3 pulled down SIRT1 in reciprocal co-IP experiments (Fig. 1D, Fig. S1A). As well, we validated TULP3 interactions with two other potential regulatory enzymes, RAD18 (Fig. 1E), a ubiquitin ligase involved in DNA double-strand break repair (34Inagaki A. Sleddens-Linkels E. van Cappellen W.A. Hibbert R.G. Sixma T.K. Hoeijmakers J.H. Grootegoed J.A. Baarends W.M. Human RAD18 interacts with ubiquitylated chromatin components and facilitates RAD9 recruitment to DNA double strand breaks.PLoS One. 2011; 6e23155Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and PP6R3/SAPS3 (Fig. 1F), a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 6 (35Heo J. Larner J.M. Brautigan D.L. Protein kinase CK2 phosphorylation of SAPS3 subunit increases PP6 phosphatase activity with Aurora A kinase.Biochem. J. 2020; 477: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Based on our observations that TULP3 physically interacts with enzymes involved in lysine acetylation and ubiquitination, we hypothesized that TULP3 might be posttranslationally regulated by one or both of these modifications. To explore potential acetylation of TULP3, we performed an immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged TULP3 from 293T cells in the absence or presence of tagged histone acetyltransferase (HAT) enzymes including p300, PCAF, and GCN5 and probed the resulting western blot with a pan-acetyl antibody. We observed a strong acetylation signal resulting from p300 stimulation (Fig. 2A), but not the other HATs, which overlapped with the predicted molecular weight of TULP3. This effect was associated with an apparent increase in the total protein levels of TULP3 in the input of the experiment (Fig. 2A). Next, we used LC-MS/MS to validate that the observed acetylation signal was due to acetylation on TULP3. We identified a total of five acetylated lysine residues (Lys37, Lys268, Lys316, Lys320, Lys389) in the presence of p300, several of which were also present under basal conditions, or in the presence of exogenous PCAF or GCN5 (Fig. 2B). To further investigate the p300-dependent increase in TULP3 levels observed in Figure 2A, we expressed exogenous p300 in HeLa cells and performed a western blot to evaluate TULP3 protein expression. Consistent with our previous result, TULP3 protein levels were increased by nearly twofold following p300 stimulation (Fig. 2C, Fig. S1B). Importantly, TULP3 mRNA expression was unchanged by p300, suggesting that the increase in protein levels was not due to increased transcription of the gene (Fig. 2D). We next examined the effect of knocking down p300 in HeLa cells on TULP3 protein levels. Stable knockdown of endogenous p300 protein resulted in a reduction in TULP3 protein levels (Fig. 2E, Fig. S1C). To distinguish if inhibition of p300 enzymatic activity versus complete loss of protein was sufficient to replicate these results, we treated cells with 30 μM of C646 or 50 μM anacardic acid, two potent small-molecule p300 inhibitors (36Babu A. Kamaraj M. Basu M. Mukherjee D. Kapoor S. Ranjan S. Swamy M.M. Kaypee S. Scaria V. Kundu T.K. Sachidanandan C. Chemical and genetic rescue of an ep300 knockdown model for Rubinstein Taybi Syndrome in zebrafish.Biochim. Biophys. Acta Mol. Basis Dis. 2018; 1864: 1203-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Consistent with our knockdown results, we found that pharmacological inhibition of p300 HAT activity resulted in a reduction in TULP3 protein levels in excess of fivefold (Fig. 2F). This effect was not due to reduced TULP3 mRNA expression (Fig. 2G). To investigate if this effect was associated with a decrease in TULP3 acetylation, we performed an immunoprecipitation of FLAG-TULP3 from cells treated with either DMSO or C646, normalized protein levels between the two IPs, and probed with a pan-acetyl antibody. Indeed, drug treatment resulted in a decrease in total TULP3 acetylation, concomitant with reduced protein levels in the input (Fig. 2H). Finally, we confirmed a protein–protein interaction between TULP3 and p300 in cells by performing reciprocal co-IP experiments (Fig. S1, D–E) and demonstrated the ability of p300 to directly acetylate TULP3 using an in vitro assay (Fig. S1F). Overall, these results demonstrate that TULP3 is acetylated in a p300-dependent manner and that its hyperacetylation is associated with an increase in its protein abundance. Previous studies have demonstrated a strong link between lysine acetylation and protein stability, often in the context of lysine acetylation/ubiquitination switches (37Caron C. Boyault C. Khochbin S. Regulatory cross-talk between lysine acetylation and ubiquitination: role in the control of protein stability.Bioessays. 2005; 27: 408-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Of the five acetylation sites we identified, four are located within the conserved tubby domain, and one is located within the N-terminal IFT-A interaction domain (Fig. 3A). We hypothesized that acetylation at one or more of these residues might directly affect TULP3 protein stability. To examine this possibility, we generated stable cells lines expressing Lys->Gln (acetyl mimetic) and Lys->Arg (deacetyl mimetic) mutant proteins (27Hubbard B.P. Loh C. Gomes A.P. Li J. Lu Q. Doyle T.L. Disch J.S. Armour S.M. Ellis J.L. Vlasuk G.P. Sinclair D.A. Carboxamide SIRT1 inhibitors block DBC1 binding via an acetylation-independent mechanism.Cell Cycle. 2013; 12: 2233-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) corresponding to each residue using site-directed mutagenesis. All of these proteins displayed nuclear-cytoplasmic localization patterns similar to the wild-type protein (Fig. S2). Next, we compared their stabilities to the wild-type protein by performing cycloheximide pulse-chase experiments. While the half-life of the wild-type protein was <3 h (Fig. 3B), we found that mutation of Lys316 or Lys389 to Gln or Arg greatly increased this (Fig. 3, C–F). Substitutions at other sites appeared to have little effect with the exception of K320Q, which also increased protein half-life (Fig. S3). Dual substitution of Lys316/Lys389 with Q or R increased TULP3 half-life by >20- and >7-fold, respectively, blocking virtually all degradation throughout the 12-h time window tested (Fig. 3, G–I). Moreover, these proteins were completely resistant to C646-induced TULP3 degradation (Fig. 3J). These data suggest that the mechanism by which p300 regulates TULP3 stability involves modification of key residues including Lys316 and Lys389. Based on the results of the protein interaction screen (Fig. 1, Supplemental File 1), we reasoned that SIRT1 and HDAC1 were likely deacetylase candidates for TULP3. To test this assertion, we treated cells with various class I and class II HDAC as well as sirtuin inhibitors (38Hubbard B.P. Gomes A.P. Dai H. Li J. Case A.W. Considine T. Riera T.V. Lee J.E. E S.Y. Lamming D.W. Pentelute B.L. Schuman E.R. Stevens L.A. Ling A.J. Armour S.M. et al.Evidence for a common mechanism of SIRT1 regulation by allosteric activators.Science. 2013; 339: 1216-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) and evaluated changes in FLAG-TULP3 acetylation (following normalization of protein levels) and total protein levels by immunoblot. We found that inhibition of SIRT1 using nicotinamide or EX-527 had no effect on TULP3 acetylation or protein levels (Fig. S4). However, treatment with several class I and class II HDAC inhibitors, namely trichostatin A (TSA), HDAC inhibitor XXIV, and MS-275, all boosted TULP3 protein levels by more than threefold and similarly affected protein acetylation levels (Fig. 4A). TSA is a pan-HDAC inhibitor while MS-275 selectively inhibits HDACs 1 and 3 and HDAC inhibitor XXIV inhibits numerous HDACs including HDAC1, but not HDAC3 (28Leus N.G. van den Bosch T. van der Wouden P.E.

Rep. 2017; 7: 45047Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These results served to strengthen the hypothesis that HDAC1 might deacetylate TULP3 in cells. To confirm this, we expressed HA-HDAC1 in 293T cells and examined the effect on TULP3 protein levels and acetylation. We found that HDAC1 decreased TULP3 protein levels by >50% in addition to reducing its acetylation by an equal degree (Fig. 4B). We repeated this experimen"
https://openalex.org/W3100264649,"Science is becoming increasingly international in terms of breaking down walls in its pursuit of high impact. Despite geographical location and distance still being major barriers for scientific collaboration, little is known about whether high-impact collaborations are similarly constrained by geography compared to collaborations of average impact. To address this question, we analyze Web of Science (WoS) data on international collaboration between global leader cities in science production. We report an increasing intensity of international city-city collaboration and find that average distance of collaboration of the strongest connections has slightly increased, but distance decay has remained stable over the last three decades. However, high-impact collaborations span large distances by following similar distance decay. This finding suggests that a larger geographical reach of research collaboration should be aimed for to support high-impact science. The creation of the European Research Area (ERA) represents an effective action that has deepened intracontinental research collaborations and the position of the European Union (EU) in global science. Yet, our results provide new evidence that global scientific leaders are not sufficiently collaborative in carrying out their big science projects."

Baseline estimates of intrinsic bacterial fitness were derived from the population growth curves. Effects of ampicillin (32 μg/mL), ceftriaxone (4 μg/mL) and meropenem (4 μg/mL) on each strain and resistance-group also were assessed. Further, in vitro batch cultures were prepared by mixing equal concentrations of 10 representative E . coli strains (two from each resistance gene group), and each mixture was incubated at 37°C for 24 hours in non-antibiotic cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton II (CAMH-2) broth, ampicillin + CAMH-2 broth (at 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 μg/mL) and ceftiofur + CAMH-2 broth (at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8μg/mL). Relative and absolute abundance of resistance-groups were estimated phenotypically. Line plots of the raw data were generated, and non-linear Gompertz models and multilevel mixed-effect linear regression models were fitted to the data. The observed strain growth rate distributions were significantly different across the groups. AmpC strains (i.e., bla CMY-2 ) had distinctly less robust (p &lt; 0.05) growth in ceftriaxone (4 μg/mL) compared to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers harboring bla CTX-M-* variants. With increasing beta-lactam antibiotic concentrations, relative proportions of ESBLs and CREs were over-represented in the mixed bacterial communities; importantly, this was more pronounced with ceftiofur than with ampicillin. These results indicate that aminopenicillins and extended-spectrum cephalosporins would be expected to propagate carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in food animals if and when Enterobacteriaceae from human health care settings enter the food animal environment."
https://openalex.org/W3099945785,"Autophagy, a cellular stress response to starvation and bacterial infection, is executed by double-membrane-bound organelles called autophagosomes. Autophagosomes transfer cytosolic material to acidified lysosomes for degradation following soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor (SNARE)-dependent fusion processes. Many of the autophagy-related disorders stem from defective end-step proteolysis inside lysosomes. The role of epithelial cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel has been argued to be critical for efficient lysosomal clearance; however, its context to autophagic clearance and the underlying mechanism is poorly defined. Here, we report that syntaxin17 (Stx17), an autophagic SNARE protein interacts with CFTR under nutritional stress and bacterial infection and incorporates it into mature autophagosomes to mediate an efficient lysosomal clearance. Lack of CFTR function and Stx17 and loss of CFTR-Stx17 interaction impairs bacterial clearance. We discover a specialized role of the Stx17-CFTR protein complex that is critical to prevent defective autophagy as has been the reported scenario in CF airway epithelial cells, infectious diseases, and lysosomal clearance disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3100042600,"Background Residual kidney function (RKF) is associated with improved survival and quality of life in dialysis patients. Previous studies have suggested that initiation of peritoneal dialysis (PD) may slow RKF decline compared to the pre-dialysis period. We sought to evaluate the association between PD initiation and RKF decline in the Initiating Dialysis Early And Late (IDEAL) trial. Methods In this post hoc analysis of the IDEAL randomized controlled trial, PD participants were included if results from 24-hour urine collections had been recorded within 30 days of dialysis initiation, and at least one value pre- and one value post-dialysis commencement were available. The primary outcome was slope of RKF decline, calculated as mean of urinary creatinine and urea clearances. Secondary outcomes included slope of urine volume decline and time from PD initiation to anuria. Results The study included 151 participants (79 early start, 72 late start). The slope of RKF decline was slower after PD initiation (-2.69±0.18mL/min/1.73m 2 /yr) compared to before PD (-4.09±0.33mL/min/1.73m 2 /yr; change in slope +1.19 mL/min/1.73m 2 /yr, 95%CI 0.48–1.90, p&lt;0.001). In contrast, urine volume decline was faster after PD commencement (-0.74±0.05 L/yr) compared to beforehand (-0.57±0.06L/yr; change in slope -0.18L/yr, 95%CI -0.34—-0.01, p = 0.04). No differences were observed between the early- and late-start groups with respect to RKF decline, urine volume decline or time to anuria. Conclusions Initiation of PD was associated with a slower decline of RKF compared to the pre-dialysis period."
https://openalex.org/W3101246358,"During mitosis, chromosomes are compacted in length by more than 100-fold into rod-shaped forms. In yeast, this process depends on the presence of a centromere, which promotes condensation in cis by recruiting mitotic kinases such as Aurora B kinase. This licensing mechanism enables the cell to discriminate chromosomal from noncentromeric DNA and to prohibit the propagation of the latter. Aurora B kinase elicits a cascade of events starting with phosphorylation of histone H3 serine 10 (H3S10ph), which signals the recruitment of lysine deacetylase Hst2 and the removal of lysine 16 acetylation in histone 4. The unmasked histone 4 tails interact with the acidic patch of neighboring nucleosomes to drive short-range compaction of chromatin, but the mechanistic details surrounding the Hst2 activity remain unclear. Using in vitro and in vivo assays, we demonstrate that the interaction of Hst2 with H3S10ph is mediated by the yeast 14-3-3 protein Bmh1. As a homodimer, Bmh1 binds simultaneously to H3S10ph and the phosphorylated C-terminus of Hst2. Our pull-down experiments with extracts of synchronized cells show that the Hst2–Bmh1 interaction is cell cycle dependent, peaking in the M phase. Furthermore, we show that phosphorylation of C-terminal residues of Hst2, introduced by genetic code expansion, stimulates its deacetylase activity. Hence, the data presented here identify Bmh1 as a key player in the mechanism of licensing of chromosome compaction in mitosis.

In mitosis, cells condense their chromosomes into compact, cylindrical bodies to ensure their faithful mechanical transport during cell division (1Antonin W. Neumann H. Chromosome condensation and decondensation during mitosis.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2016; 40: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, ring-shaped protein complexes, the condensins, compact mitotic chromosomes into helical arrays of chromatin loops (2Kschonsak M. Haering C.H. Shaping mitotic chromosomes: from classical concepts to molecular mechanisms.Bioessays. 2015; 37: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Condensins are believed to act by loop extrusion (3Goloborodko A. Marko J.F. Mirny L.A. Chromosome compaction by active loop extrusion.Biophys.

However, additional forces and factors must contribute to chromosome condensation because even in the absence of condensins, chromatin still aggregates in mitosis (11Vagnarelli P. Hudson D.F.

Maximal chromosome compaction occurs by axial shortening in anaphase and depends on Aurora kinase.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 822-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Among the many factors that may contribute to this phenomenon, posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of histones are particularly attractive (13Cuijpers S.A.G. Vertegaal A.C.O. Guiding mitotic progression by crosstalk between post-translational modifications.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2018; 43: 251-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 14Zhiteneva A. Bonfiglio J.J. Makarov A. Colby T. Vagnarelli P. Schirmer E.C. Matic I. Earnshaw W.C. Mitotic post-translational modifications of histones promote chromatin compaction in vitro.Open Biol. 2017; 7: 170076Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Histone PTMs may contribute to chromosome condensation in various ways: they could signal the recruitment of effector proteins by serving as recognition marks, might influence the activity of enzymes involved in condensation, or directly control an inherent tendency of chromatin to condense. The most intensely studied mitotic PTM is phosphorylation of histone H3S10 (15Hendzel M.J. Wei Y. Mancini M.A. VanHooser A. Ranalli T. Brinkley B.R. BazettJones D.P. Allis C.D. Mitosis-specific phosphorylation of histone H3 initiates primarily within pericentromeric heterochromatin during G2 and spreads in an ordered fashion coincident with mitotic chromosome condensation.Chromosoma. 1997; 106: 348-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). This hallmark of mitotic chromatin is initially deposited at centromeres by Aurora B kinase as part of the chromosomal passenger complex (16Hsu J.Y. Sun Z.W. Li X.M. Reuben M. Tatchell K. Bishop D.K. Grushcow J.M. Brame C.J. Caldwell J.A. Hunt D.F. Lin R.L. Smith M.M. Allis C.D.

In budding yeast, phosphorylation of histone H3 serine 10 (H3S10ph) signals the recruitment of lysine deacetylase (KDAC) Hst2 to chromatin in mitosis (17Wilkins B.J. Rall N.A. Ostwal Y. Kruitwagen T. Hiragami-Hamada K. Winkler M. Barral Y. Fischle W. Neumann H. A cascade of histone modifications induces chromatin condensation in mitosis.Science. 2014; 343: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Hst2 in turn removes acetyl groups from lysine-16 of nearby H4 tails, thereby enabling them to engage with the acidic patch of neighboring nucleosomes. This internucleosomal interaction provides a driving force of chromatin compaction in mitosis, mediating hypercondensation of chromatid arms in late anaphase (17Wilkins B.J. Rall N.A. Ostwal Y. Kruitwagen T. Hiragami-Hamada K. Winkler M. Barral Y. Fischle W. Neumann H. A cascade of histone modifications induces chromatin condensation in mitosis.Science. 2014; 343: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 18Neurohr G. Naegeli A. Titos I. Theler D. Greber B. Diez J. Gabaldon T. Mendoza M. Barral Y. A midzone-based ruler adjusts chromosome compaction to anaphase spindle length.Science. 2011; 332: 465-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This short-range compaction acts independently of the axial contraction by condensins (17Wilkins B.J. Rall N.A. Ostwal Y. Kruitwagen T. Hiragami-Hamada K. Winkler M. Barral Y. Fischle W. Neumann H. A cascade of histone modifications induces chromatin condensation in mitosis.Science. 2014; 343: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 18Neurohr G. Naegeli A. Titos I. Theler D. Greber B. Diez J. Gabaldon T. Mendoza M. Barral Y. A midzone-based ruler adjusts chromosome compaction to anaphase spindle length.Science. 2011; 332: 465-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, compaction by internucleosomal interactions is initiated by activation of Aurora B kinase at kinetochores. The signal subsequently propagates along chromosome arms in a Shugoshin-dependent process, thereby coupling the ability of chromatin to condense to the presence of a centromere (19Kruitwagen T. Chymkowitch P. Denoth-Lippuner A. Enserink J. Barral Y. Centromeres license the mitotic condensation of yeast chromosome arms.Cell. 2018; 175: 780-795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This licensing of condensation by centromeres is a potential mechanism by which yeasts discriminate nonchromosomal DNA from chromosomes, protecting its progeny from infectious genetic material (19Kruitwagen T. Chymkowitch P. Denoth-Lippuner A. Enserink J. Barral Y. Centromeres license the mitotic condensation of yeast chromosome arms.Cell. 2018; 175: 780-795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The spreading mechanism of short-range compaction is essential to create a chromosome-autonomous process. Little is presently known about the molecular mechanism of spreading. Here, we explore how Hst2 recognizes H3S10ph and how this interaction is controlled by the cell cycle. H3 peptides phosphorylated at Ser-10 efficiently recovered Hst2 from yeast whole-cell extracts, demonstrating the significance of H3S10 phosphorylation in recruiting Hst2 to mitotic chromatin (17Wilkins B.J. Rall N.A. Ostwal Y. Kruitwagen T. Hiragami-Hamada K. Winkler M. Barral Y. Fischle W. Neumann H. A cascade of histone modifications induces chromatin condensation in mitosis.Science. 2014; 343: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, recombinant Hst2 purified from Escherichia coli did not interact with H3S10ph peptides (Fig. S1), indicating that additional factors or PTMs on Hst2 are needed to mediate the interaction. To identify such factors that recruit Hst2 to the phosphorylated Histone H3 tail, we purified FLAG-tagged Hst2 from yeast extracts (Fig. 1A) and analyzed the copurifying proteins by mass spectrometry. We identified several novel interactors of Hst2 with a high fold difference compared with the negative control (untagged Hst2) (Fig. S2 and Table S3). Gene ontology analysis revealed a strong overrepresentation of proteins involved in chromatin related processes, such as replication (Fig. 1B). We confirmed the interaction of Hst2 with minichromosome maintenance2, a component of the minichromosome maintenance helicase complex by Western blot (Fig. S3). However, because the association of minichromosome maintenance helicase with chromatin is regulated by other mechanisms than H3 phosphorylation (20Hyrien O. How MCM loading and spreading specify eukaryotic DNA replication initiation sites.F1000Res. 2016; 5: 2063Crossref Google Scholar), this complex is unlikely to recruit Hst2 to phosphorylated H3 tails. If the Hst2–H3 interaction requires the presence of PTMs on Hst2, the abundance of the bridging factors in the pull-down might be very low because of the usually low stoichiometry of PTMs. Therefore, we analyzed Hst2 for the presence of phosphorylated residues by MS/MS (Fig. S4) and identified five serine and two threonine phosphorylation sites (Fig. 1C). Most sites reside in the unstructured C-terminus of the protein. One of the residues, S340, had been reported previously as being phosphorylated (21Albuquerque C.P. Smolka M.B. Payne S.H. Bafna V. Eng J. Zhou H.L. A multidimensional chromatography technology for in-depth phosphoproteome analysis.Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2008; 7: 1389-1396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Three serine phosphorylation sites (S316, S320, and S324) cluster downstream of the nuclear export sequence in the C-terminus (Fig. 1D) and may therefore be involved in regulating nuclear export. We hypothesized that phosphorylation of Hst2 is essential for its recruitment to H3S10ph. Typical mediators of interactions between two phosphorylated proteins are 14-3-3 proteins (22Braselmann S.

The 14-3-3 proteins are involved in numerous important cellular processes such as transcription (25Tzivion G. Dobson M. Ramakrishnan G.

The interaction of 14-3-3 proteins with H3S10ph is well established across different organisms (28MacDonald N. Welburn J.P.I. Noble M.E.M. Nguyen A. Yaffe M.B. Clynes D. Moggs J.G. Orphanides G.

Conversely, several KDACs are known to interact with 14-3-3 proteins in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (31Healy S. Khan D.H. Davie J.R. Gene expression regulation through 14-3-3 interactions with histones and HDACs.Discov. Med. 2011; 11: 349-358PubMed Google Scholar). For example, SirT2 interacts with 14-3-3β/γ in humans (32Jin Y.H. Kim Y.J. Kim D.W. Baek K.H. Kang B.Y. Yeo C.Y. Lee K.Y. Sirt2 interacts with 14-3-3 beta/gamma and down-regulates the activity of p53.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Ageing Dev. 2006; 127: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether deletion of the budding yeast 14-3-3 proteins, Bmh1 and Bmh2, interferes with deacetylation of H4K16 by Hst2 in mitosis, an established hallmark of short-range chromatin compaction (17Wilkins B.J. Rall N.A. Ostwal Y. Kruitwagen T. Hiragami-Hamada K. Winkler M. Barral Y. Fischle W. Neumann H. A cascade of histone modifications induces chromatin condensation in mitosis.Science. 2014; 343: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Yeast cells lacking BMH1 that were metaphase-blocked with nocodazole indeed showed elevated H4K16ac levels similar to cells without HST2 (Fig. 2A). Deletion of BMH2 had the same effect to a lesser extent, suggesting that both isoforms contribute to the recruitment of Hst2. Because Bmh1 is more abundant than Bmh2 (35Ghaemmaghami S. Huh W.K. Bower K. Howson R.W. Belle A. Dephoure N. O'Shea E.K. Weissman J.S. Global analysis of protein expression in yeast.Nature. 2003; 425: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (2877) Google Scholar), deletion of BMH1 is expected to cause a more severe defect. Truncating Hst2 after residue 295 was sufficient to prevent H4K16 deacetylation, supporting our hypothesis that the unstructured C-terminus of Hst2 (which contains most of the phosphorylation sites) is necessary for its recruitment to H3S10ph. Next, we tested whether Bmh1 and Hst2 interact physically. Indeed, when we immune-precipitated Hst2 (overexpressed with N-terminal FLAG-tag), Bmh1 efficiently copurified only in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors, indicating a phosphorylation-dependent interaction between both proteins (Fig. 2B). The interaction further depended on the presence of serine residues 320 and 324, which we had shown to be phosphorylated in Hst2 (Fig. 1C). Mutating the other phosphorylation sites did not affect the interaction with Bmh1. Interestingly, mutation of either Ser-320 or Ser-324 to alanine alone was sufficient to completely abolish Bmh1 binding. Because optimal sequence motifs for 14-3-3 proteins are R-X2-3-(pS/pT)-X-P (36Kakiuchi K. Yamauchi Y. Taoka M. Iwago M. Fujita T. Ito T. Song S.Y. Sakai A. Isobe T. Ichimura T. Proteomic analysis of in vivo 14-3-3 interactions in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 7781-7792Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we consider it unlikely that Bmh1 requires the presence of both phosphorylations for binding. It seems more likely that the two phosphorylation sites interact functionally, for example, that phosphorylation of one site depends on the presence of a serine residue at the other site. Because overexpression of Hst2 might artificially induce the interaction with Bmh1, we repeated the pull-down experiments at endogenous protein levels. Therefore, we precipitated Bmh1-GFP from yeast lysates with genomically FLAG-tagged Hst2 (Fig. 2C). Hst2-FLAG specifically co-eluted with Bmh1 depending on the GFP-tag on the latter, confirming that the Hst2–Bmh1 interaction also occurs at endogenous protein concentrations. Next, we asked whether the Hst2–Bmh1 interaction is influenced by the cell-cycle stage. Therefore, we repeated the pull-down experiments at endogenous protein levels with cell cycle–synchronized yeast cultures (Fig. 2D). Pull-down experiments with lysates from yeasts blocked in the G1 phase with α-factor or the S phase with hydroxyurea showed very little interaction of Hst2 with Bmh1. In contrast, we observed efficient interaction of Hst2 with Bmh1 when cells were blocked in the metaphase with nocodazole. This result agrees with our model that Bmh1 recruits Hst2 to chromatin in mitosis when it is needed for short-range chromosome compaction. Finally, we tested the requirement of individual phosphosites in Hst2 for H4K16 deacetylation in mitosis. Therefore, we created point mutants of Hst2 in which S316, S320, or S324 is replaced with alanine using CRISPR/Cas9. In this case, the S320A and S324A mutants were defective in deacetylating H4K16ac in mitosis, whereas the S316A mutant was functional (Fig. 2E). Hence, mutations that interfere with the phosphorylation dependent interaction of Hst2 with Bmh1 also abrogate H4K16ac removal in mitosis. To test the Hst2–Bmh1 interaction under defined conditions, we prepared singly phosphorylated Hst2 proteins in E. coli using genetic code expansion (37Rogerson D.T. Sachdeva A. Wang K. Haq T. Kazlauskaite A. Hancock S.M. Huguenin-Dezot N. Muqit M.M. Fry A.M. Bayliss R. Chin J.W. Efficient genetic encoding of phosphoserine and its nonhydrolyzable analog.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2015; 11: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thereby, phosphoserine is encoded in response to amber (UAG) stop codons by an archaeal phosphoseryl-tRNA synthetase–tRNACUA pair introduced in an E. coli strain lacking phosphoserine phosphatase SerB. Suppression of amber codons replacing the codon for phosphorylated serine residues in Hst2 results in the production of site-specifically phosphorylated protein. We produced Hst2 S320ph and Hst2 S324ph and compared their ability to bind to Strep-tagged Bmh1 with unphosphorylated Hst2 (Fig. 3A). Both phosphorylated forms of Hst2 were efficiently recovered in these pull-down experiments, whereas unmodified Hst2 did not associate with Bmh1. Hence, both serine residues mutually required for the Hst2–Bmh1 interaction in vivo are individually sufficient to mediate the interaction in vitro. Next, we investigated whether Bmh1 is required to bridge the interaction between phosphorylated Hst2 and H3 tails. Therefore, we immobilized H3 peptides with or without phosphorylation on S10 on agarose beads and performed pull-down experiments in the presence of Bmh1 and Hst2 (Fig. 3B). Bmh1 bound to the beads in the presence of the phosphorylation on H3 (lane 8) but was unable to bind in the presence of calf-intestinal phosphatase (CIP), which dephosphorylates the peptide (lane 9). Hst2 bound phosphorylated H3 peptides in the presence of Bmh1 when either S320 or S324 was phosphorylated (lanes 11 and 12). In the absence of H3 phosphorylation (lanes 13–15), Bmh1 (lanes 5–7), or Hst2 phosphorylation (lane 10), Hst2 was not recovered with the beads. Hence, Bmh1 is indeed necessary and sufficient to mediate the interaction of phospho-Hst2 with phosphorylated H3 tails. The phosphorylation of Hst2 may have additional functions in the regulation of Hst2 activity. For example, phosphorylation of S316 could regulate nuclear export of Hst2 because this residue is part of the nuclear export sequence. Furthermore, the C-terminal α-helix of Hst2 has been shown to interfere with NAD+ binding (38Zhao K. Chai X. Clements A. Marmorstein R. Structure and autoregulation of the yeast Hst2 homolog of Sir2.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 864-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Therefore, we measured the activity of recombinant Hst2 with or without phosphorylation of S320 or S324 in dependence of NAD+ concentration using acetylated firefly luciferase (FLuc) as substrate (39Spinck M. Ecke M. Sievers S. Neumann H. Highly sensitive lysine deacetylase assay based on acetylated firefly luciferase.Biochemistry. 2018; 57: 3552-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3C). The phosphorylated forms of Hst2 both showed a 3-fold increase in Vmax and a 3-fold decrease in KM for NAD+, resulting in an almost 10-fold higher catalytic efficiency. The enhanced catalytic efficiency was reverted by preincubation of the phosphorylated proteins with CIP, confirming that the presence of the phosphorylation is essential for the effect. The addition of Bmh1 to the deacetylation reaction did not further enhance the activity of phosphorylated Hst2 (Fig. 3D). Hence, phosphorylation is sufficient to fully activate Hst2 activity. This indicates that the unphosphorylated Hst2 C-terminus acts like a mixed noncompetitive inhibitor that is masked by phosphorylation. This can be interpreted in the way that binding of the C-terminus to the catalytic core reduces the affinity for NAD+ (increasing KM) and also slows catalysis (reducing Vmax). The regulation of the catalytic activity by phosphorylation of C-terminal residues appears to be a conserved mechanism that has also been observed for the human Hst2 homologue, SirT2 (40Naini S.M.

https://openalex.org/W3098987174,"Whether the visceral-to-subcutaneous fat ratio (V/S ratio) is associated with renal prognosis in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains unclear. Furthermore, little is known about the effect of sex and the absolute amount of visceral fat accumulation such as visceral fat area (VFA) ≥100 cm 2 on the V/S ratio in relation to renal prognosis. In this study, 200 patients with CKD were evaluated for renal prognosis. Survival analyses and logistic regression analyses were conducted, generating time-series pseudo- R 2 values. The mean and percent change of the pseudo- R 2 values from the 6 th year to the 10 th year (6Y–10Y Mean and 6Y–10Y Change, respectively) were calculated for determining the cut-off points for the medium-term renal prognosis. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that the V/S ratio was significantly associated with renal outcomes and that the VFA category (VFA ≥ 100 cm 2 ) had significant interactions with the V/S ratio regarding renal prognosis. The hazard ratio (HR) of the V/S ratio was higher in the sub-cohort of VFA &lt; 100 cm 2 than in the sub-cohort of VFA ≥ 100 cm 2 (HR: 6.42 vs. 1.00). Regarding sex differences, a strong association was noted between the V/S ratio and renal prognosis in women but not in men (HR: 2.40 vs. 1.10). On the other hand, 6Y–10Y Mean of the pseudo- R 2 values indicated differences in the cut-off points of the V/S ratio between men and women (V/S ratio: 0.75 vs. 0.5). Our findings indicate that it may be clinically meaningful to consider the differences in sex and the amount of VFA ≥100 cm 2 for the V/S ratio in relation to renal outcomes in patients with CKD. The 6Y–10Y Mean of the pseudo- R 2 values contributed to determining the cut-off points of the V/S ratio according to the sex difference."

While the importance of classic cadherins such as E- or N-cadherin for tumorigenesis is acknowledged, there is much less information about other cadherins that are merely considered as tissue-specific adhesion molecules. Here, we focused on the atypical cadherin MUCDHL that stood out for its unusual features and unique function in the gut. Analyses of transcriptomic data sets (n > 250) established that MUCDHL mRNA levels are down-regulated in colorectal tumors. Importantly, the decrease of MUCDHL expression is more pronounced in the worst-prognosis subset of tumors and is associated with decreased survival. Molecular characterization of the tumors indicated a negative correlation with proliferation-related processes (e.g., nucleic acid metabolism, DNA replication). Functional genomic studies showed that the loss of MUCDHL enhanced tumor incidence and burden in intestinal tumor-prone mice. Extensive structure/function analyses revealed that the mode of action of MUCDHL goes beyond membrane sequestration of ß-catenin and targets through its extracellular domain key oncogenic signaling pathways (e.g., EGFR, AKT). Beyond MUCDHL, this study illustrates how the loss of a gene critical for the morphological and functional features of mature cells contributes to tumorigenesis by dysregulating oncogenic pathways."
https://openalex.org/W3100693450,"Current clinical and anatomical studies show that the venous problem associated with the deep inferior epigastric perforator flap results from poor midline-crossing. We examined the venous anatomy of the infraumbilical midline area and the dynamic venous flow of the deep inferior epigastric perforator flap in nine fresh cadavers. All nine abdominal specimens were harvested between the subcostal margin and the groin crease. Two specimens were used to analyze the abdominal venous anatomy, one of which was divided into two hemi-abdominal specimens. The remaining seven specimens were harvested as deep inferior epigastric perforator flaps with one major paraumbilical perforator. Venous cannulation and serial angiographic agent injection were performed in several conditions. Each specimen was radiographed using a soft X-ray system. For additional information, computed tomography (CT) angiography-visualized superficial inferior epigastric veins (SIEVs) and the supraumbilical branch were analyzed. We noted that the venous drainage between the bilateral SIEVs was easier to configure in the supraumbilical area than in the infraumbilical area. Only one to two short polygonal venous networks connect the bilateral superficial inferior epigastric veins in the supraumbilical area; however, long and multiple polygonal venous networks connect the bilateral superficial inferior epigastric veins in the infraumbilical area, which could be a predisposing factor for venous congestion. The mean distance from the umbilicus upper border to evident supraumbilical midline crossover was 18.39±4.03 mm (range: 10.10–28.49) in CT angiograms. In cadaver specimens, the mean distance was 10.87±4.85 mm (range: 4.6–18.9). Supraumbilical midline crossover was more favorable than infraumbilical midline crossover in venous flow."
https://openalex.org/W3101388580,"The ClpB–DnaK bichaperone system reactivates aggregated cellular proteins and is essential for survival of bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and plants under stress. AAA+ ATPase ClpB is a promising target for the development of antimicrobials because a loss of its activity is detrimental for survival of many pathogens and no apparent ClpB orthologs are found in metazoans. We investigated ClpB activity in the presence of several compounds that were previously described as inhibitor leads for the human AAA+ ATPase p97, an antitumor target. We discovered that N2,N4-dibenzylquinazoline-2,4-diamine (DBeQ), the least potent among the tested p97 inhibitors, binds to ClpB with a Kd∼60 μM and inhibits the casein-activated, but not the basal, ATPase activity of ClpB with an IC50∼5 μM. The remaining p97 ligands, which displayed a higher affinity toward p97, did not affect the ClpB ATPase. DBeQ also interacted with DnaK with a Kd∼100 μM and did not affect the DnaK ATPase but inhibited the DnaK chaperone activity in vitro. DBeQ inhibited the reactivation of aggregated proteins by the ClpB–DnaK bichaperone system in vitro with an IC50∼5 μM and suppressed the growth of cultured Escherichia coli. The DBeQ-induced loss of E. coli proliferation was exacerbated by heat shock but was nearly eliminated in a ClpB-deficient E. coli strain, which demonstrates a significant selectivity of DBeQ toward ClpB in cells. Our results provide chemical validation of ClpB as a target for developing novel antimicrobials. We identified DBeQ as a promising lead compound for structural optimization aimed at selective targeting of ClpB and/or DnaK."
https://openalex.org/W3104459303,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a fundamental component of a protein kinase cascade that is an energy sensor. AMPK maintains energy homeostasis in the cell by promoting catabolic and inhibiting anabolic pathways. Activation of AMPK requires phosphorylation by the liver kinase B1 or by the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 2 (CaMKK2). The scaffold protein IQGAP1 regulates intracellular signaling pathways, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase and AKT signaling cascades. Recent work implicates the participation of IQGAP1 in metabolic function, but the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are poorly understood. Here, using several approaches including binding analysis with fusion proteins, siRNA-mediated gene silencing, RT-PCR, and knockout mice, we investigated whether IQGAP1 modulates AMPK signaling. In vitro analysis reveals that IQGAP1 binds directly to the α1 subunit of AMPK. In addition, we observed a direct interaction between IQGAP1 and CaMKK2, which is mediated by the IQ domain of IQGAP1. Both CaMKK2 and AMPK associate with IQGAP1 in cells. The ability of metformin and increased intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations to activate AMPK is reduced in cells lacking IQGAP1. Importantly, Ca2+-stimulated AMPK phosphorylation was rescued by re-expression of IQGAP1 in IQGAP1-null cell lines. Comparison of the fasting response in wild-type and IQGAP1-null mice revealed that transcriptional regulation of the gluconeogenesis genes PCK1 and G6PC and the fatty acid synthesis genes FASN and ACC1 is impaired in IQGAP1-null mice. Our data disclose a previously unidentified functional interaction between IQGAP1 and AMPK and suggest that IQGAP1 modulates AMPK signaling."

In this study, broilers were fed ad libitum (CT) or withdrew food for 12 (FH12), 24 (FH24), 36 (FH36), or 48 hours (FH48). We showed that food withdrawal increased the energy assimilation when compared with the CT. Food withdrawal improved the digestibility of ether extract and the level of lipid substances and fatty acid-derived β-hydroxybutyrate in serum. Compared to the CT, food withdrawal did not influence the digestibility of starch. Due to 12 hours or longer food withdrawal duration increased glutamate oxidation and uric acid excretion, the analyzed digestibility of crude protein was underestimated, although the upregulated amino acid transporter genes. In addition, histological analysis showed that short-term food withdrawal (12 hours) increased intestinal villus height, crypt depth, and proliferative cell, whereas prolonged food withdrawal (more than 24 hours) impaired villus structure due to the decreased cell proliferation. Moreover, proteomics analysis revealed upregulated pathways in birds withdrawn food for 36 hours involved in nutrient absorption and amino acid oxidation. In conclusion, food withdrawal changes nutrient absorption and utilization, especially for amino acid and ether extract, and results in increased ME. Both glutamate oxidation and fatty acid incomplete oxidation are involved in energy supply after refeeding. In contrast to short-term food withdrawal, prolonged food withdrawal impairs the intestinal structure and villus renewal. Our findings deserve attention from nutritionists who are analyzing food digestibility."

To characterize the fish composition of the tributaries and mainstream in the upper reaches of the Ganjiang River, we identified seventy-five species of 15 families in 14 sampling sites. These data were analyzed using the inclusion index at the taxonomic level (TINCLi), the importance value index (IVI), the taxonomic diversity indices (Δ + and Λ + ), cluster analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS). The results showed that the most common and dominant order was the Cypriniformes, represented most frequently by Hemiculter leucisculus among the sample sites. Most fishes were omnivorous, mountain stream or settled fish that lay sinking or viscid eggs. Most sites showed a trend of more discrete distribution from high latitude to low latitude. According to the taxonomic diversity indices, the fish taxonomic composition in the upper reaches of Ganjiang River is uneven. The Bray-Curtis resemblance matrix and nMDS showed that the habitats of the Ganjiang River were divided into four areas. The results will provide information needed for freshwater fish resource protection in the upper reaches of the Ganjiang River."

We aimed to determine the angle range over which estimation is unreliable; build a low-cost PS placement support system that uses an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to enable the monitoring of surgical tools and PS trajectories, and determine the situations where IMU support would be most beneficial. In PS insertion experiments, we used cadaver samples that included lumbar porcine spines. Computed tomography images obtained before and after PS insertion were viewed. Offsets between the planned and implanted PS trajectories in the freehand and IMU-assisted groups were analyzed. The PS cortical bone breaches were classified according to the Gertzbein and Robbins criteria (GRC). Added head-down tilted sample experiments were repeated wherein we expected a decreased rostro-caudal rotational accuracy of the PS according to the angle estimation ability results. Evaluation of the PS trajectory accuracy revealed no significant advantage of IMU-assisted rostro-caudal rotational accuracy versus freehand accuracy. According to the GRC, IMU assistance significantly increased the rate of clinically acceptable PS positions (RoCA) than the freehand technique. In the head-down tilted sample experiments, IMU assist provided increased accuracies with both rostro-caudal and medial rotational techniques when compared with the freehand technique. In the freehand group, RoCA was significantly decreased in samples with rostral tilting relative to that in the samples without. However, In the IMU-assisted group, no significant difference in RoCA between the samples with and without head-down tilting was observed. Even when the planned PS medial and/or rostro-caudal rotational angle was relatively large and difficult to reproduce manually, IMU-support helped maintain the PS trajectory accuracy and positioning safety. IMU assist in PS placement was more beneficial, especially for larger rostro-caudal and/or medial rotational pedicle angles."

Recently, we developed a highly sensitive, rapid-detection device (an immuno-wall device) that utilizes photoreactive polyvinyl alcohol immobilized with antibodies against a target protein via a streptavidin–biotin interaction. To evaluate its performance, we assayed epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutations, such as E746_A750 deletion in exon 19 or L858R substitution in exon 21, both of which are common in non-small cell lung cancer and important predictors of the treatment efficacy of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The results showed that in 20-min assays, the devices detected as few as 1% (E746_A750 deletion) and 0.1% (L858R substitution) of mutant cells. Subsequent evaluation of detection of the mutations in surgically resected lung cancer specimens from patients with or without EGFR mutations and previously diagnosed using commercially available, clinically approved genotyping assays revealed diagnostic sensitivities of the immuno-wall device for E746_A750 deletion and L858R substitution of 85.7% and 87.5%, respectively, with specificities of 100% for both mutations. These results suggest that the immuno-wall device represents a good candidate next-generation diagnostic tool, especially for screening of EGFR mutations."

The present study aimed at improving knowledge about IS in the elderly (aged 65 years and older), in particular about its association with both emotive/affective and cognitive variables. The sample ( N = 172) was divided into three groups on the basis of age: late adult (aged 55–64, N = 59), young elderly (aged 65–74, N = 63), and elderly (aged 75 and older, N = 50). Cognitive (i.e., Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test-2, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test), emotive/affective (i.e., Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Marlowe–Crowne Social Desirability Scale, Penn State Worry Questionnaire) and suggestibility measures (i.e., Gudjonsson Suggestibility Scale-2) were administered. In order to identify differences and associations between groups in IS, cognitive and emotive/affective variables, ANOVAs tests and Pearson’s correlations were run. Furthermore, moderation analyses and hierarchical regression were set to determine whether age, cognitive and emotive/affective variables predicted IS components (i.e., Yield and Shift). Finally, machine learning models were developed to highlight the best strategy for classifying elderly subjects with high suggestibility. The results corroborated the significant link between IS and age, showing that elderly participants had the worst performance on all suggestibility indexes. Age was also the most important predictor of both Yield and Shift. Results also confirmed the important role of non-verbal intelligence and memory impairment in explaining IS dimensions, showing that these associations were stronger in young elderly and elderly groups. Implications about interrogative procedures with older adults were discussed."

The linker helix-α13 is the last secondary structure of the NTD and protrudes from its active site to connect it to the CTD (Fig. 1D). The catalytic residues D209 and D657 are required to deprotonate the hydroxyl on C6 of glucose in preparation for its nucleophilic attack on the γ-phosphate of ATP (7Ardehali H. Printz R.L.

Currently, the most commonly used cancer treatment is still chemotherapy, a procedure with high side effects due to its low specificity for cancer cells (27Garcia S.N. Guedes R.C. Marques M.M. Unlocking the potential of HK2 in cancer metabolism and therapeutics.Curr. Med. Chem. 2019; 26: 7285-7322Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).

Inhibition of glycolytic enzyme hexokinase II (HK2) suppresses lung tumor growth.Cancer Cell Int. 2016; 16: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Due to the highly conserved identity of the active site residues of human HKs, one of the greatest challenges in the design and development of anticancer inhibitors based on the HK reaction is the preferential targeting of HK2 over the other human isozymes (12Nawaz M.H. Ferreira J.C. Nedyalkova L. Zhu H. Carrasco-Lopez C. Kirmizialtin S. Rabeh W.M.

Hexokinase 2 is required for tumor initiation and maintenance and its systemic deletion is therapeutic in mouse models of cancer.Cancer Cell. 2013; 24: 213-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Anticancer therapeutics that target cancer growth will have to specifically inhibit HK2 and avoid interactions with HK in normal tissues. For this reason, successful drug candidates need to bind outside the highly conserved HK active site to avoid the inhibition of all human isozymes. Although HK1 and HK2 share high structural fold similarity, they do exhibit biochemical differences that can be explored for the development of HK2-specific inhibitors. The CTD is catalytically active in all human HKs. Despite its structural fold similarity to the CTD, the NTD is inactive in all human isozymes except HK2. We previously found that the size of the linker helix-α13 regulates the activity of the NTD of HK2 (12Nawaz M.H. Ferreira J.C. Nedyalkova L. Zhu H. Carrasco-Lopez C. Kirmizialtin S. Rabeh W.M. The catalytic inactivation of the N-half of human hexokinase 2 and structural and biochemical characterization of its mitochondrial conformation.Biosci. Rep. 2018; 38BSR20171666Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). When expressed separately from the full-length (FL) enzyme with four of the eight helical turns of the linker helix-α13, the NTD variant was inactive. However, increasing the number of helical turns of the linker helix-α13 recovered the activity of the NTD variant. The ability of the linker helix-α13 to regulate the NTD activity of HK2 makes it an excellent target for the development of specific inhibitors of HK2's active NTD without interacting with or binding to the HK active site. In this study, we investigated the roles of the linker helix-α13 residues on the catalytic activity of the NTD of HK2 to identify a possible regulatory site. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to determine the roles of residues in the linker helix-α13 and its network of interactions on the NTD activity of HK2. We identified three residues (D447, S449, and K451) at the beginning of the linker helix-α13 that regulate the activity of the NTD of HK2. These residues have been found to maintain the conformational stability around the NTD active site, enhancing the structural stability of the linker helix-α13 and its interaction with the catalytic helix-α5 of the NTD. CTD of HK1 and that of HK2 contain identical residues to those in the NTD regulatory site, but these residues were unable to control the activity of the CTD. The newly identified NTD regulatory site of HK2 is a promising target for the design of anticancer therapeutics that would reduce the rate of glycolysis in cancer through specific inhibition of the upregulated HK2. Human HK2, similar to isozymes HK1, HK3, and HKDC1, is a homodimer in which each monomer is split into two structurally identical domains, the NTD and CTD (Fig. 1, A–C) (10Aleshin A.E. Zeng C.

Lett. 2016; 7: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and the active site is located in a cleft between the large and small subdomains. In mammalian HK, the glucose binding site is conserved and includes the catalytic residues D209 and D657 in the NTD and CTD, respectively (12Nawaz M.H. Ferreira J.C. Nedyalkova L. Zhu H. Carrasco-Lopez C. Kirmizialtin S. Rabeh W.M. The catalytic inactivation of the N-half of human hexokinase 2 and structural and biochemical characterization of its mitochondrial conformation.Biosci. Rep. 2018; 38BSR20171666Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We previously reported that the linker helix-α13 (residues G448–Q478) is important for maintaining the catalytic activity of the NTD (Fig. 1, A and B), which is composed of a long eight-turn α-helix (12Nawaz M.H. Ferreira J.C. Nedyalkova L. Zhu H. Carrasco-Lopez C. Kirmizialtin S. Rabeh W.M. The catalytic inactivation of the N-half of human hexokinase 2 and structural and biochemical characterization of its mitochondrial conformation.Biosci. Rep. 2018; 38BSR20171666Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The linker helix-α13 protrudes from the active site at the end of the NTD, thus connecting it to the CTD. It is also perpendicular to the catalytic helix-α5 that carries the catalytic residue D209 (Fig. 1D). In this study, we investigated the roles of residues of the linker helix-α13 on the catalytic activity of the NTD of HK2 to identify a possible regulatory site, which would be targeted in the design of anticancer therapeutics to reduce the rate of glycolysis in cancer through the inhibition of upregulated HK2. To assess the role of residues of the linker helix-α13 in the catalytic activity of the NTD of HK2, site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce mutants into the linker helix-α13 and its network of interactions. Since both the NTD and CTD of HK2 are catalytically active, the enzymatic rate of the NTD was measured in the FL variant in the presence of D657A mutant to catalytically inactive the CTD. All HK2 mutants were expressed and purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography followed by size-exclusion chromatography as described before (12Nawaz M.H. Ferreira J.C. Nedyalkova L. Zhu H. Carrasco-Lopez C. Kirmizialtin S. Rabeh W.M. The catalytic inactivation of the N-half of human hexokinase 2 and structural and biochemical characterization of its mitochondrial conformation.Biosci. Rep. 2018; 38BSR20171666Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The protein purity was assessed using SDS-PAGE with high purity to enable detailed characterization of the WT and mutant enzymes (Fig. S1). The enzymatic rate of HK2 mutants was measured at saturated concentrations of glucose and ATP using the coupled G6P dehydrogenase assay. First, the interaction of the linker helix-α13 with the catalytic helix-α5 and loop444−447 of the large subdomain in the NTD was investigated. The last β-strand of the large subdomain extends outward as loop444−447 to connect to the linker helix-α13, where D447 of loop444−447 forms a salt bridge (3.1 Å) with K451 of the linker helix-α13 (Fig. 1E). K451 is conserved in human HKs, while D447 is partially conserved and replaced by S447 in HK1 and HKDC1 (Fig. S2). The enzyme titration assay showed that D447A and K451A mutants were surprisingly catalytically inactive, where the alanine substitution of each residue was introduced in the presence of D657A in the FL variant (Fig. 2, A and G). These alanine substitutions at nonactive site residues were able to eliminate the catalytic activity of NTD of HK2. To recover the activity of D447A and K451A mutants, alternative amino acid substitutions were introduced. The NTD activity was partially recovered in the presence of D447E, D447N, D447S, and K451R (Fig. 2, A and G). The amino acid substitutions D447E and K451R conserved the ionic charges but increased the size of the side chains for these residues, thus decreasing the distance between D447 and K451. The partial recovery of the NTD activity of D447E and K451R mutants indicates that not only the charge but also the distance between D447 and K451 is important in maintaining the activity of the NTD. Therefore, D447 and K451 facilitate strong interactions and mediate a specific distance between the linker helix-α13 and loop444−447 for optimum activity of the NTD of HK2. An intramolecular interaction is observed between E446 and R444 (3.1 and 4.1 Å) in loop444−447 (Fig. 1E), where the NTD enzymatic rate was also reduced by 57% ± 1% and 74% ± 1% in the presence of R444L and E446A mutations, respectively (Fig. 2, B and G). Interestingly, only HK2 harbors a positively charged residue R444, whereas the corresponding residue is leucine in HK1 and HKDC1, proline in HK3, and E440 in HK4 (Fig. S2). An alternative amino acid substitution, E446N, recovered the enzymatic activity of the NTD. In contrast to D447 and K451, the intramolecular interactions of loop444−447 reduced, but did not eliminate the catalytic activity of the NTD of HK2. Furthermore, E446 forms an additional bond with K418 of the large subdomain (4.4 Å), where both residues are conserved in the NTD and CTD of all human HK isozymes (Fig. 1E). The K418A mutant increased the activity of the NTD at 146% ± 1% compared with the control (Fig. 2, B and G). In the NTD of HK2, the catalytic helix-α5 (residues: D209–D220) is a small three-turn α-helix that harbors the catalytic residue D209. The catalytic helix-α5 is perpendicular to the linker helix-α13, and both are wedged between the two β-sheets of the large and small subdomains (Fig. 1B). The linker helix-α13 interacts with the catalytic helix-α5 at three sites. First, S449 at the beginning of the linker helix-α13 interacts with the side chain of T213 (3.0 Å) and peptide backbone of D209 (3.1 Å), both of which are located on the catalytic helix-α5 (Fig. 1D). Similar to D447A and K451A, the introduction of S449A eliminated the catalytic activity of the NTD of HK2 (Fig. 2, C and H). Multiple amino acid substitutions were introduced at S449 to evaluate its role in catalysis, where S449N mutant slightly recovered the NTD activity. Interestingly, S449T was inactive, although threonine has the same hydroxyl functional group on its side chain as serine, and S449D slightly increased the NTD activity (Fig. 2H). This indicates that not only the hydrogen bonding int"
https://openalex.org/W3100481512,"Responses to drought within a single species may vary based on plant developmental stage, drought severity, and the avoidance or tolerance mechanisms employed. Early drought stress can restrict emergence and seedling growth. Thus, in areas where water availability is limited, rapid germination leading to early plant establishment may be beneficial. Alternatively, germination without sufficient water to support the seedling may lead to early senescence, so reduced germination under low moisture conditions may be adaptive at the level of the population. We studied the germination response to osmotic stress of diverse chile pepper germplasm collected in southern Mexico from varied ecozones, cultivation systems, and of named landraces. Drought stress was simulated using polyethylene glycol solutions. Overall, survival time analysis revealed delayed germination at the 20% concentration of PEG across all ecozones. The effect was most pronounced in the genotypes from hotter, drier ecozones. Additionally, accessions from wetter and cooler ecozones had the fastest rate of germination. Moreover, accessions of the landraces Costeño Rojo and Tusta germinated more slowly and incompletely if sourced from a drier ecozone than a wetter one, indicating that slower, reduced germination under drought stress may be an adaptive avoidance mechanism. Significant differences were also observed between named landraces, with more domesticated types from intensive cultivation systems nearly always germinating faster than small-fruited backyard- or wild-types, perhaps due to the fact that the smaller-fruited accessions may have undergone less selection. Thus, we conclude that there is evidence of local adaptation to both ecozone of origin and source cultivation system in germination characteristics of diverse chile peppers."
https://openalex.org/W3101879494,"Proteins are complex biomolecules which perform critical tasks in living organisms. Knowledge of a protein’s structure is essential for understanding its physiological function in detail. Despite the incredible progress in experimental techniques, protein structure determination is still expensive, time-consuming, and arduous. That is why computer simulations are often used to complement or interpret experimental data. Here, we explore how in silico protein structure determination based on replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) can benefit from including contact information derived from theoretical and experimental sources, such as direct coupling analysis or NMR spectroscopy. To reflect the influence from erroneous and noisy data we probe how false-positive contacts influence the simulated ensemble. Specifically, we integrate varying numbers of randomly selected native and non-native contacts and explore how such a bias can guide simulations towards the native state. We investigate the number of contacts needed for a significant enrichment of native-like conformations and show the capabilities and limitations of this method. Adhering to a threshold of approximately 75% true-positive contacts within a simulation, we obtain an ensemble with native-like conformations of high quality. We find that contact-guided REMD is capable of delivering physically reasonable models of a protein’s structure."
https://openalex.org/W3101957645,"Introduction We evaluated trends in hospitalization incidence and mortality due to hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke in young adults, according to gender and developed regions in Brazil. Methods Between 2008–2018, we performed a population-based time-series study using official hospitalization and death data due to stroke, in individuals aged 10–49 years, from Southeast and South, Brazil. Data were based on reports from the Unified Health System of Hospital Information System and Mortality Information System. Stroke was defined by the International Classification of Diseases, 10 th revision (I60–I63). A Prais-Winsten regression model was performed and the Annual Percentage Change was calculated. Results In total, 78,123 hospitalizations of individuals aged 10–49 years were recorded, of which 59,448 (76%) resulted from hemorrhagic stroke (HS). The hospitalizations for HS was significantly decreased (- 4.37%) among men and women in both regions. The hospitalizations for ischemic stroke (IS) was flat, except between 2011 and 2018, when IS hospitalization rates increased. In the analysis by states, HS hospitalizations declined across all states, except for Espírito Santo, where it remained unchanged (p &gt; 0.05). IS flat hospitalizations were observed in all states, except Espírito Santo, where it increased by 24.93%. In terms of mortality, 28,625 deaths were recorded, of which 26,548 (92.7%) resulted from HS. HS mortality decreased significantly by -3.48%and IS mortality by -3.84%. Decreases also occurred in all Southeast and South states (p &lt; 0.05). IS remained unchanged across all states, except Minas Gerais, where it decreased by -14.95%. Conclusions We identified a decline in the hospitalizations and mortality of HS and a flat trend for IS in developed regions of Brazil. The recent period (2011–2018) demonstrated increasing rates in the hospitalizations of IS in both regions and genders. The mortality rates for HS and IS decreased between 2008–2018 in Southeast and South Brazil for both genders."
https://openalex.org/W3101979715,"Oncology is a highly siloed field of research in which sub-disciplinary specialization has limited the amount of information shared between researchers of distinct cancer types. This can be attributed to legitimate differences in the physiology and carcinogenesis of cancers affecting distinct anatomical sites. However, underlying processes that are shared across seemingly disparate cancers probably affect prognosis. The objective of the current study is to investigate whether multitask learning improves 5-year survival cancer patient survival prediction by leveraging information across anatomically distinct HPV related cancers. Data were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program database. The study cohort consisted of 29,768 primary cancer cases diagnosed in the United States between 2004 and 2015. Ten different cancer diagnoses were selected, all with a known association with HPV risk. In the analysis, the cancer diagnoses were categorized into three distinct topography groups of varying specificity. The most specific topography grouping consisted of 10 original cancer diagnoses differentiated by the first two digits of the ICD-O-3 topography code. The second topography grouping consisted of cancer diagnoses categorized into six distinct organ groups. Finally, the third topography grouping consisted of just two groups, head-neck cancers and ano-genital cancers. The tasks were to predict 5-year survival for patients within the different topography groups using 14 predictive features which were selected among descriptive variables available in the SEER database. The information from the predictive features was shared between tasks in three different ways, resulting in three distinct predictive models: 1) Information was not shared between patients assigned to different tasks (single task learning); 2) Information was shared between all patients, regardless of task (pooled model); 3) Only relevant information was shared between patients grouped to different tasks (multitask learning). Prediction performance was evaluated with Brier scores. All three models were evaluated against one another on each of the three distinct topography-defined tasks. The results showed that multitask classifiers achieved relative improvement for the majority of the scenarios studied compared to single task learning and pooled baseline methods. In this study, we have demonstrated that sharing information among anatomically distinct cancer types can lead to improved predictive survival models."
https://openalex.org/W3104856184,"Background Our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of novel rapid diagnostic tests: rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDT), digital immunoassays (DIA), rapid nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT), and other treatment algorithms for influenza in high-risk patients presenting to hospital with influenza-like illness (ILI). Methods We developed a decision-analytic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic test strategies (RIDT, DIA, NAAT, clinical judgement, batch polymerase chain reaction) preceding treatment; no diagnostic testing and treating everyone; and not treating anyone. We modeled high-risk 65-year old patients from a health payer perspective and accrued outcomes over a patient’s lifetime. We reported health outcomes, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), healthcare costs, and net health benefit (NHB) to measure cost-effectiveness per cohort of 100,000 patients. Results Treating everyone with no prior testing was the most cost-effective strategy, at a cost-effectiveness threshold of $50,000/QALY, in over 85% of simulations. This strategy yielded the highest NHB of 15.0344 QALYs, but inappropriately treats all patients without influenza. Of the novel rapid diagnostics, NAAT resulted in the highest NHB (15.0277 QALYs), and the least number of deaths (1,571 per 100,000). Sensitivity analyses determined that results were most impacted by the pretest probability of ILI being influenza, diagnostic test sensitivity, and treatment effectiveness. Conclusions Based on our model, treating high-risk patients presenting to hospital with influenza-like illness, without performing a novel rapid diagnostic test, resulted in the highest NHB and was most cost-effective. However, consideration of whether treatment is appropriate in the absence of diagnostic confirmation should be taken into account for decision-making by clinicians and policymakers."
https://openalex.org/W3105074301,"Artemin is an abundant thermostable protein in Artemia embryos and it is considered as a highly efficient molecular chaperone against extreme environmental stress conditions. The conformational dynamics of artemin have been suggested to play a critical role in its biological functions. In this study, we have investigated the conformational and functional changes of artemin under heat and oxidative stresses to identify the relationship between its structure and function. The tertiary and quaternary structures of artemin were evaluated by fluorescence measurements, protein cross-linking analysis, and dynamic light scattering. Based on the structural analysis, artemin showed irreversible substantial conformational lability in responses to heat and oxidant, which was mainly mediated through the hydrophobic interactions and dimerization of the chaperone. In addition, the chaperone-like activity of heated and oxidized artemin was examined using lysozyme refolding assay and the results showed that although both factors, i.e. heat and oxidant, at specific levels improved artemin potency, simultaneous incubation with both stressors significantly triggered the chaperone activation. Moreover, the heat-induced dimerization of artemin was found to be the most critical factor for its activation. It was suggested that oxidation presumably acts through stabilizing the dimer structures of artemin through formation of disulfide bridges between the subunits and strengthens its chaperoning efficacy. Accordingly, it is proposed that artemin probably exists in a monomer–oligomer equilibrium in Artemia cysts and environmental stresses and intracellular portion of protein substrates may shift the equilibrium towards the active dimer forms of the chaperone."
https://openalex.org/W3106089737,"Background Few studies have reported on the clustering pattern of CVD risk factors, including sedentary behavior, systemic inflammation, and cadiometabolic components in the general population. Objective We aimed to explore the clustering pattern of CVD risk factors using exploratory factor analysis to investigate the underlying relationships between various CVD risk factors. Methods A total of 5606 subjects (3157 male, 51.5±11.7 y/o) were enrolled, and 14 cardiovascular risk factors were analyzed in an exploratory group (n = 3926) and a validation group (n = 1676), including sedentary behaviors. Results Five factor clusters were identified to explain 69.4% of the total variance, including adiposity (BMI, TG, HDL, UA, and HsCRP; 21.3%), lipids (total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol; 14.0%), blood pressure (SBP and DBP; 13.3%), glucose (HbA1C, fasting glucose; 12.9%), and sedentary behavior (MET and sitting time; 8.0%). The inflammation biomarker HsCRP was clustered with only adiposity factors and not with other cardiometabolic risk factors, and the clustering pattern was verified in the validation group. Conclusion This study confirmed the clustering structure of cardiometabolic risk factors in the general population, including sedentary behavior. HsCRP was clustered with adiposity factors, while physical inactivity and sedentary behavior were clustered with each other."
