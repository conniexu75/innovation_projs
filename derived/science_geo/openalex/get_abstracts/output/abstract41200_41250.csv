https://openalex.org/W2091095324,"Hereditary hypogonadism in the hypogonadal (hpg) mouse is caused by a deletional mutation of at least 33.5 kilobases encompassing the distal half of the gene for the common biosynthetic precursor of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and GnRH-associated peptide (GAP). The partially deleted gene is transcriptionally active as revealed by in situ hybridization histochemistry of hpg hypothalamic tissue sections, but immunocytochemical analysis failed to show the presence of antigen corresponding to any part of the precursor protein."
https://openalex.org/W1578508637,"We have isolated cDNA clones for the rat stomach (H+ + K+)-ATPase by employing a novel procedure involving the use of oligonucleotides corresponding to conserved amino acid sequences of related cation transport ATPase and a cross-hybridization with the sheep kidney (Na+ + K+)-ATPase alpha-subunit cDNA. The complete nucleotide sequence of the cDNA has been determined and the amino acid sequence of the protein deduced. The ATPase consists of 1,033 amino acids and has an Mr of 114,012. Amino acid homology and hydropathy plot comparisons between the gastric ATPase and the (Na+ + K+)-ATPase catalytic subunit demonstrate a striking similarity which suggests that their higher order structure and mechanism of action are virtually identical. The greatest homology occurs in the phosphorylation site region and in domains which may be involved in nucleotide binding and energy transduction. The most substantial differences occur in the N-terminal region and in the transmembrane domains. In addition, we report the presence of an open reading frame 5' to the translation initiation site of the gastric ATPase, which raises the possibility that the mRNA is polycistronic."
https://openalex.org/W1520316237,"The lignin peroxidase (ligninase) of Phanerochaete chrysosporium catalyzes the oxidation of a variety of lignin-related compounds. Here we report that this enzyme also catalyzes the oxidation of certain aromatic pollutants and compounds related to them, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with ionization potentials less than or equal to approximately 7.55 eV. This result demonstrates that the H2O2-oxidized states of lignin peroxidase are more oxidizing than the analogous states of classical peroxidases. Experiments with pyrene as the substrate showed that pyrene-1,6-dione and pyrene-1,8-dione are the major oxidation products (84% of total as determined by high performance liquid chromatography), and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis of ligninase-catalyzed pyrene oxidations done in the presence of H2(18)O showed that the quinone oxygens come from water. We found that whole cultures of P. chrysosporium also transiently oxidize pyrene to these quinones. Experiments with dibenzo[p]dioxin and 2-chlorodibenzo[p]dioxin showed that they are also substrates for ligninase. The immediate product of dibenzo[p]dioxin oxidation is the dibenzo[p]dioxin cation radical, which was observed in enzymatic reactions by its electron spin resonance and visible absorption spectra. The cation radical mechanism of ligninase thus applies not only to lignin, but also to other environmentally significant aromatics."

https://openalex.org/W1526825773,"Leukotriene (LT) synthesis and metabolism were studied in porcine aortic endothelial cells. Leukotrienes were identified by combinations of guinea pig lung parenchymal strip bioassay, radioimmunoassay, and UV spectrophotometry with high performance liquid chromatography. Endothelial cells stimulated with the calcium ionophore, A23187, were unable to convert arachidonic acid to detectable levels of LTA4-derived products including the biologically active metabolites, LTB4 or LTC4. However, these cells readily converted exogenous LTA4 to the potent slow-reacting substance, LTC4. Smaller quantities of 11-trans-LTC4 and LTD4 were also observed. LTB4 was not detectable in these incubations nor was LTB4 metabolism observed. The possible intercellular transfer of LTA4 between polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) and endothelial cells was tested since PMNL release LTA4 when stimulated and have significant contact with endothelium. When A23187-stimulated neutrophils were coincubated with endothelial cells, a significant increase in LTC4 levels was detected over PMNL alone. LTC4 is formed by the enzymatic conjugation of glutathione (GSH) with LTA4. Therefore in some experiments, endothelial cells were prelabeled with [35S]cysteine to allow intracellular synthesis of [35S]GSH. When unlabeled PMNL were added, as a source of LTA4 to the prelabeled endothelial cells, substantial levels of [35S] LTC4 were recovered. The data indicate that endothelial cells synthesize LTC4 from LTA4. They also demonstrate a specific PMNL-endothelial cell interaction in which endothelial cell LTC4 synthesis results from the intercellular transfer of LTA4 produced by PMNL."
https://openalex.org/W1568427873,"In platelets activated by thrombin, the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate by phospholipase C produces inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol, metabolites which are known to cause Ca2+ release from the platelet dense tubular system and granule secretion. Previous studies suggest that phospholipase C activation is coupled to platelet thrombin receptors by a guanine nucleotide-binding protein or G protein. The present studies examine the contribution of this protein to thrombin-induced platelet activation and compare its properties with those of Gi, the G protein which mediates inhibition of adenylate cyclase by thrombin. In platelets permeabilized with saponin, nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs reproduced the effects of thrombin by causing diacylglycerol formation, Ca2+ release from the dense tubular system and serotonin secretion. In intact platelets, fluoride, which by-passes the thrombin receptor and directly activates G proteins, caused phosphoinositide hydrolysis and secretion. Fluoride also caused an increase in the platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration that appeared to be due to a combination of Ca2+ release from the dense tubular system and increased Ca2+ influx across the platelet plasma membrane. Guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP beta S), which inhibits G protein function, inhibited the ability of thrombin to cause IP3 and diacylglycerol formation, granule secretion, and Ca2+ release from the dense tubular system in saponin-treated platelets. Increasing the thrombin concentration overcame the effects of GDP beta S on secretion without restoring diacylglycerol formation. The effects of GDP beta S on platelet responses to thrombin which had been subjected to partial proteolysis (gamma-thrombin) were similar to those obtained with native alpha-thrombin despite the fact that gamma-thrombin is a less potent inhibitor of adenylate cyclase than is alpha-thrombin. Thrombin-induced diacylglycerol formation and 45Ca release were also inhibited when the saponin-treated platelets were preincubated with pertussis toxin, an event that was associated with the ADP-ribosylation of a protein with Mr = 41.7 kDa. At each concentration tested, the inhibition of thrombin-induced diacylglycerol formation by pertussis toxin paralleled the inhibition of thrombin's ability to suppress PGI2-stimulated cAMP formation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1607359458,"While attempting to isolate a cDNA clone for the catalytic subunit of the bovine cAMP-dependent protein kinase, we have isolated cDNAs which code for a protein slightly different than the known amino acid sequence. The alternate cDNA was identified by screening a bovine pituitary cDNA library using synthetic oligonucleotides predicted from the known amino acid sequence of the catalytic subunit. The cDNA which we identified, encodes a protein which is 93% identical to the known amino acid sequence of the bovine catalytic subunit. It seems likely that this cDNA represents a previously undiscovered catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The mRNA for the alternate catalytic subunit is different in size from the mRNA coding for the previously known catalytic subunit and also has a different tissue distribution. These findings suggest that there are at least two different genes for the catalytic subunit. The differences in amino acid sequence and tissue distribution suggest the possibility of important functional differences in the two enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1565755747,"Basic or acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF), alone, was found to be as potent as alpha-thrombin to reinitiate DNA synthesis in G0-arrested Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (CCL39). Basic FGF at 50 ng/ml or thrombin at 1 unit/ml rapidly initiated early events such as cytoplasmic alkalinization (0.2-0.3 pH units), rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+, phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 and increased c-myc expression, followed by a 30-40-fold increase in labeled nuclei. Whereas thrombin is a potent activator of phospholipase C as judged by the rapid release of inositol trisphosphate, inositol bisphosphate and by the massive accumulation of total inositol phosphate (IP) in the presence of 20 mM Li+, FGF failed to induce the breakdown of polyphosphoinositides in quiescent CCL39 cells. Indeed, no inositol trisphosphate nor inositol bisphosphate could be detected in response to FGF; in presence of Li+ the total IP release never exceeded 8% of the IP released by the action of thrombin. Two additional findings indicated that FGF and thrombin activate different signaling pathways. First, we found that, in contrast to thrombin, the FGF-induced rise in the cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration measured by quin-2 fluorescence, is strictly dependent upon the presence of Ca2+ in the external medium. Second, we found that FGF failed to activate protein kinase C as judged by the epidermal growth factor-receptor binding assay. Treatment of the cells with either thrombin or phorbol esters, rapidly inhibited 125I-labeled epidermal growth factor binding (50-60%). Basic or acidic FGF had no effect. We conclude that: the FGF-receptor signaling pathway is not coupled to phospholipase C activation, and early mitogenic events and reinitiation of DNA synthesis can be initiated independently of inositol lipid breakdown and protein kinase C activation."

https://openalex.org/W1562330161,"In the present study it is demonstrated that platelet-activating factor (PAF) was produced by chick retinas, upon stimulation with neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine (ACh), dopamine, or with calcium ionophore A23187, but not upon stimulation with gamma-amino-n-butyric acid, L-glycine, L-glutamate, epinephrine, or histamine. PAF produced in response to ACh, dopamine, or A23187 was not released into supernatants but was extractable from retinas. The amounts of extractable PAF increased after sonication of stimulated retinas. While no PAF activity could be recovered from unstimulated retinas, small amounts of this lipid can be detected following sonication of the tissue. The amount of extractable PAF from ACh-, dopamine-, or A23187-stimulated retinas was dependent upon the incubation time and concentration of the agonists. PAF was identified on the basis of chemical and lipase treatments, biological activity with washed rabbit platelets, behavior on thin layer chromatography, and high pressure liquid chromatography. Control cell preparations (leukocytes, erythrocytes, and embryogenic fibroblasts) did not produce PAF upon neurotransmitter stimulation. ACh and dopamine promoted PAF production by increasing dithiothreitol-insensitive cholinephosphotransferase activity, without affecting the acetyltransferase activity. In contrast, the A23187 ionophore stimulated the acetyltransferase activity but did not affect the dithiothreitol-insensitive cholinephosphotransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1527689406,"The cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase of Dictyostelium discoideum functions to maintain the responsiveness of cells to the chemoattractant cAMP during the aggregation phase of development. We have prepared a cDNA library and have isolated clones which contain a portion of the 5' untranslated region and the entire coding and 3' untranslated portions of the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase gene. The primary structure of the extracellular cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase precursor has been deduced from the nucleotide sequence. The molecule is composed of 452 amino acids and was calculated to have a molecular mass of 51,078 daltons. Forty-nine amino-terminal residues which contain a hydrophobic leader sequence are not present in the mature extracellular enzyme. Four potential asparagine-linked glycosylation sites were found within the phosphodiesterase. An amino acid sequence homology search revealed no closely related proteins. Phosphodiesterase mRNA levels are low in growing cells and first increase soon after the onset of development. The amount of transcript then decreases before rising in abundance to maximum levels during the terminal stages of cell aggregation and apical tip formation. During formation of the fruiting body, levels of phosphodiesterase mRNA decrease. Exposure of cells to cAMP increases the amount of phosphodiesterase mRNA. Increases of mRNA abundance are correlated with increases in enzyme activity, suggesting regulation at the level of transcription."

https://openalex.org/W1504072603,"The ompB locus, comprised of the genes ompR and envZ, regulates the expression of the genes ompF and ompC that encode the major porin proteins in the outer membrane of Escherichia coli K-12. OmpR is believed to activate transcription of ompF and ompC in a reciprocal manner depending upon the osmolarity of the culture medium. We were able to purify OmpR to homogeneity and to characterize its interaction with the porin gene promoters. The purified OmpR was shown to bind specifically to promoter fragments of both ompF and ompC. Deoxyribonuclease I footprinting was carried out in order to determine binding sites of OmpR in the promoter regions of the ompF and ompC. OmpR was found to protect the regions -105 to -60 of ompF and -102 to -78 of ompC, respectively. Two consensus sequences were found in these protected sites and are likely to play an important role in OmpR recognition of these promoter regions. The purified OmpR was also shown to be functionally active in transcription in vitro; OmpR activates the expression of ompF and inhibits the transcription of ompC from the most distal of its three tandem promoters, P3."

Both in humans and rats, expression of the IGF-II gene results in the appearance of several mRNA species. In the present study, cDNA and synthetic oligonucleotide probes were used to isolate and characterize the rat IGF-II gene from genomic libraries. The rat IGF-II gene extends over 12 kilobase pairs and contains two 5'-noncoding exons and three protein-coding exons. The two 5' exons represent alternative 5' regions of different mRNA molecules and are expressed from two distinct promoters. The two promoters are transcribed with different efficiencies but exhibit similar tissue-specific expression and regulation with developmental age."

E., Rosen, G. M., Chai, Y., and Cohen, M. S. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 4426-4431). Even then, .OH formation wanes in spite of ongoing superoxide (O2-.) production. In contrast, ferric salt supplementation of a hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase O2-. generating system containing DETAPAC produces continual .OH, suggesting that neutrophils limit the formation of this free radical. To evaluate this hypothesis, neutrophil cytoplasts (largely devoid of granules but able to generate O2-.) were stimulated with PMA in the presence of Fe3+, DETAPAC, dimethyl sulfoxide, and DMPO. This resulted in continual production of DMPO-CH3. In the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide, HL-60 (promyelocytic) cells differentiate into cells similar in morphology and O2-. generating capacity to neutrophils. However, their granules lack the iron-binding protein lactoferrin (LF). Ferric salt supplementation of HL-60 cells stimulated with PMA yielded an EPR spectrum similar to cytoplasts. Supernatant obtained following PMA-induced neutrophil degranulation (which releases LF extracellularly) suppressed DMPO-CH3 formation by the hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase/Fe3+/DETAPAC system. Anti-LF antibody, but not anti-transferrin antibody, prevented stimulated neutrophil supernatant inhibition of hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase/Fe3+/DETAPAC-mediated .OH formation. Similarly, neutrophils stimulated with PMA in the presence of Fe3+, DETAPAC, and anti-LF antibody (but not anti-transferrin antibody) demonstrated continual formation of .OH. Neutrophil degranulation of LF limits Fe3+-catalyzed .OH formation which in vivo could protect tissue from possible .OH-mediated injury."
https://openalex.org/W1517936321,"The formation and removal of UV-induced pyrimidine dimers were measured in restriction fragments near and within the essential dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene in Chinese hamster ovary cells in order to map the genomic fine structure of DNA repair. Dimer frequencies were determined at 0, 8, and 24 h after irradiating the cells with 20 J/m2 UV light (254 nm). Within 8 h, the cells had removed more than 40% of the dimers from sequences near the 5' end of the gene, somewhat fewer from the 3' end, but only 2% from the 3' flanking region and 10% from a region upstream from the gene. The corresponding extent of repair in the genome as a whole is 5-10% in the 8-h period. Isoschizomeric restriction enzyme analysis was used to detect the level of methylation in the fragments in which repair was measured. We found that the only hypomethylated sites in and around the DHFR gene were in the fragment near its 5' end, which displayed maximal DNA repair efficiency. The size of the region of preferential DNA repair at the DHFR locus appears to be in the range of 50-80 kilobases, and this finding is discussed in relation to genomic domains and the structure of mammalian chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W1586170588,"1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) induces the synthesis of calcium binding protein (calbindin-D28K) and calbindin-D28K-mRNA in the chick intestine. We have examined the relationship between nuclear uptake of 1,25-(OH)2D3, 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor occupancy levels, and transcription of the calbindin-D28K gene and found all three parameters to be highly correlated. All three events occur rapidly (within 15-30 min) following a single dose of 6.5 nmol of 1,25-(OH)2D3 to vitamin D-deficient chicks, reaching peak values by 1-2 h; by 4 h, values of all three parameters start to decline. Calbindin-D28K-mRNA begins to accumulate by 3-5 h but does not peak until 12 h following hormone administration. The levels of calbindin-D28K start to increase by 5-8 h and do not peak until 48 h after the 1,25-(OH)2D3 dose. These observations suggest that post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms may be involved. Measurements of basal levels of calbindin-D28K gene transcription show that there is virtually no transcription in the vitamin D-deficient chick intestine, and a 12-fold induction in the intestine of vitamin D-replete chicks. This basal level of transcription in vitamin D-replete chick intestine is not inhibited by cycloheximide pretreatment. These results confirm the thesis that a major component of the mechanism of action of 1,25-(OH)2D3 is functioning as a steroid hormone, effected through the direct action of the seco-steroid-receptor complex on the initiation of transcription of specific genes."
https://openalex.org/W1482553721,"The respiratory deficiency of yeast strains previously assigned to complementation group G7 has been ascribed to the absence in the mutants of functional cytochrome b. Since G7 mutants are capable of synthesizing the apoprotein, the primary effect of the mutations is to prevent maturation of this electron carrier. The recombinant plasmid pG7/T1 with a 6.7-kilobase pairs (kb) insert of wild type yeast nuclear DNA has been selected from a genomic library by transformation of a G7 mutant to respiratory competency. The genetically active region of the pG7/T1 insert has been subcloned on a 3-kb fragment of DNA which has been shown to contain an open reading frame encoding a protein of 50,236 Mr. In situ disruption of the reading frame causes a deficiency in cytochrome b. The strain with the disrupted gene fails to complement G7 mutants thereby confirming the correct identification of the gene henceforth referred to as COR1. The carboxyl-terminal half of the COR1 gene has been fused to the amino-terminal half of the Escherichia coli trpE gene in the high expression vector pATH2. This plasmid construct promotes a high level of expression of the trpE/COR1 hybrid protein. Antibodies against the purified hybrid protein react with a 44 kDa protein subunit of yeast coenzyme QH2-cytochrome c reductase corresponding to the largest core subunit of the complex. These data indicate that the yeast nuclear gene COR1 codes for the 44-kDa core protein and that the latter is required for the conversion of apocytochrome b to mature cytochrome b."
https://openalex.org/W1580193796,"The glucose-permease (IIGlc) of the bacterial phosphotransferase system mediates sugar transport across the cytoplasmic membrane concomitant with sugar phosphorylation. It also functions as a receptor for bacterial chemotaxis. The structural gene of the permease, ptsG, has been cloned on a multicopy plasmid, and transformants constitutively overproducing the protein 10-15 times over wild-type level have been isolated. Overproduction is slightly inhibited if transformants are grown in a glucose-containing medium. The complete amino acid sequence of the glucose-permease is deduced from the nucleotide sequence. It consists of 477 residues and is moderately hydrophobic. A comparison of the glucose-permease with the mannitol-permease (Lee, C. A., and Saier, M. H., Jr. (1983) J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1546031396,"The bifunctional enzyme FAD synthetase from Brevibacterium ammoniagenes was purified by a method involving ATP-affinity chromatography. The final preparation was more than 95% pure. The apparent molecular weight of the enzyme was determined as 38,000 and the isoelectric point as 4.6. Although previous attempts to separate the enzymatic activities had failed, ATP:riboflavin 5'-phosphotransferase and ATP:FMN-adenylyltransferase activities in B. ammoniagenes were believed to be located on two separate proteins with similar properties, possibly joined in a complex. The following evidence, however, suggests the presence of both activities on a single polypeptide chain. The two activities copurify in the same ratio through the purification scheme as presented. Only a single band could be detected when aliquots from the final purification step were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, nondenaturing gel electrophoresis, and isoelectric focusing. Edman degradation of the protein yielded a single N-terminal sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1582928646,"Through the use of specific staining and the analysis of the interaction of pure beta-adrenergic receptor of S49 mouse lymphoma cells with lectins immobilized to insoluble matrices, we establish that this beta-adrenergic receptor is a glycoprotein. The effects of swainsonine (0.2 microgram/ml), an inhibitor of Golgi mannosidase II, as well as those of tunicamycin (0.2 microgram/ml), an inhibitor of N-glycosylation, on the expression and function of this integral membrane glycoprotein were investigated in S49 mouse lymphoma cells grown in culture. Preexisting receptors on the cells were inactivated by alkylation with the beta-adrenergic antagonist ligand N-(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoxylpropyl)-N'-bromoacetyl-ethylenediamine. Swainsonine did not alter the number of beta-receptors measured in intact cells, the Bmax, or Kd of receptors measured in membranes prepared from these cells as assayed by [125I]iodocyanopindolol binding or their functional coupling to adenylate cyclase. Autoradiograms of membranes photoaffinity-labeled with [125I]iodoazidobenzylpindolol and subjected to electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels reveal a reduction of 6,000 in the Mr of beta-receptors in membranes prepared from swainsonine-treated cells. This form of receptor was sensitive to endoglycosaminidase H, indicating its high mannose hybrid oligosaccharide nature. The number and affinity of beta-receptors in tunicamycin-treated S49 cells were normal. Whereas stimulation of cyclic AMP accumulation in cells or adenylate cyclase in membranes by prostaglandin E1 was essentially abolished by tunicamycin treatment, stimulation by isoproterenol was largely unaffected. The nonglycosylated receptor displays an Mr that is approximately 8,000-11,000 smaller than the native receptor. Thus, N-glycosylation does not affect the expression (steady-state) or function of the beta-adrenergic receptor, whereas prostaglandin E1 receptor function is lost. The role of N-glycosylation in receptor function is not universal among receptors coupled to adenylate cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W1593357670,"The effect of the tumor promoter phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) on expression of the P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase gene was studied in rat hepatoma H4IIE cells. Like insulin, PMA provokes a concentration and time-dependent decrease of mRNA coding for that enzyme that is due to an inhibition of P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase gene transcription. This effect of PMA is rapid, reversible, specific for phorbol esters known to be active in other systems, and it does not require on-going protein synthesis. PMA overrides the stimulatory effects cAMP and glucocorticoid analogs have on the transcription of this gene. A synthetic diacylglycerol, sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol, also inhibits P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase gene transcription. These effects of PMA and synthetic diacylglycerol are specific, since neither affected total mRNA synthesis. We conclude that diacylglycerol and phorbol esters, specific stimulators of protein kinase C, inhibit the transcription of P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase gene in H4IIE cells. The findings support the hypothesis that diacylglycerols generated in the plasma membrane can act as an intracellular signal that regulates specific gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1561941585,"The gene COX9 for subunit VIIa of cytochrome c oxidase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been cloned with the aid of an oligonucleotide probe. From the nucleotide sequence of COX9, we deduce that subunit VIIa is derived from a precursor that is 59 amino acids in length (Mr = 6963). This precursor is longer than mature subunit VIIa by one amino acid at its NH2 terminus and four amino acids at its COOH terminus. COX9 exists as a single copy in the haploid genome of S. cerevisiae and produces one major transcript. When the genomic copy of COX9 is removed, cells lack a functional cytochrome c oxidase holoenzyme. From the predicted secondary structure of subunit VIIa, previous data concerning its relationship to the lipid bilayer of the inner membrane and the location of its hydrophobic domains (Power, S.D., Lochrie, M.A., and Poyton, R.O. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 9206-9209) and the finding that it is essential for the holoenzyme, we propose a model for subunit VIIa which suggests that this small integral protein plays a role in holoenzyme assembly or stability."
https://openalex.org/W1504183214,"cAMP receptor protein (CRP)-dependent operon expression in Escherichia coli requires the CRP X cAMP complex form of wild-type CRP. One class of crp mutants (crp*) activates CRP-dependent promoters in strains (cya) incapable of endogenous cAMP synthesis. Of fundamental interest is the difference in regulatory properties exhibited by crp* mutant strains, some of which exhibit glucose-mediated repression of beta-galactosidase synthesis, some of which do not. To gain a better understanding of the mechanisms of cAMP-independent promoter activation and repression we have: determined through cloning and DNA sequence analysis the primary structure of three CRP* forms of CRP; purified the mutant proteins; characterized the effect of these mutations on CRP secondary structure; and studied CRP*-activated lac promoter regulation in a purified in vitro transcription system. The results of this study provide strong evidence that mutations in crp alter the conformation of CRP and result in cAMP-independent activation of CRP-dependent promoters in vitro. In addition, a CRP allele-specific inhibition of CRP* activity by spermidine was observed in vitro that parallels crp* strain-specific sensitivity to glucose-mediated repression of CRP-dependent enzyme synthesis in vivo. This observation provides evidence that catabolite repression in cells lacking cAMP may be mediated through a mechanism that inhibits CRP* activity."
https://openalex.org/W1607449281,"From the amino acid sequence of yeast cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIII published previously (Power, S. D., Lochrie, M.A., Patterson, T.E., and Poyton, R.C. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 6571-6574), we have synthesized a pair of oligonucleotide probes and used them to identify COX8, its structural gene. By genomic Southern blot analysis and disruption of the COX8 chromosomal locus, we have shown that this gene is present in one copy per haploid genome and that its product, subunit VIII, is essential for maximal levels of cellular respiration and cytochrome c oxidase activity. Alignment of the amino acid sequence predicted from the DNA sequence of COX8 with the determined amino acid sequence of subunit VIII indicates that mature subunit VIII is derived from a larger precursor that extends from both the NH2 and COOH termini of the mature polypeptide. Thus, like many other nuclear coded mitochondrial proteins, subunit VIII is derived from a precursor which carries a leader peptide. In addition, this precursor, like that for yeast cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIIa, appears to carry a four-amino acid trailer peptide at its COOH terminus."
https://openalex.org/W1513083878,"Comparative studies investigating influences of temperature and time of preincubation on the interactions of an organomercurial agarose gel and p-mercuribenzoate with glucose-6-phosphatase of native and Triton X-114-modified rat liver microsomes were carried out. The effect of p-mercuribenzoate on glucose 6-phosphate hydrolysis is a result of two processes, a moderate membrane perturbation connected with release of some latency and temperature- and time-dependent inhibition of the catalytic activity. Short-term preincubation with both organic mercurials at 37 degrees C is a necessary condition for the entire inhibition of the enzyme activity of native as well as of Triton X-114-modified microsomes. A binding site of the phosphohydrolase itself is accessible to p-mercuribenzoate and the phenyl mercury residue of the affinity gel from the cytoplasmic surface even in native microsomes. Kinetic analyses reveal a formally competitive mechanism of inhibition using native microsomes, but the kinetic picture changes to a noncompetitive pattern of Lineweaver-Burk plots when the inhibitor-loaded microsomes are modified optimally by Triton X-114. This behavior can be evaluated as the first convincing evidence for drastic changes of the conformational status of the phosphohydrolase during the membrane modification process. A combined conformational flexibility-substrate transport model characterizing the microsomal glucose-6-phosphatase as an integral channel-protein embedded within the hydrophobic interior of the membrane is proposed."

https://openalex.org/W1567215256,"Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) caused a rapid and dose-dependent increase in cAMP levels, followed by elevation of c-myc mRNA levels and then increased DNA synthesis in quiescent cultures of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. The dose-response curves of PGE1 were nearly the same for each of these three processes. Both 8-bromo-cAMP and forskolin increased c-myc mRNA levels to 40-50% and DNA synthesis to 70-80% of those caused by a maximally effective dose of PGE1. Under the comparable conditions, PGE1 did not stimulate diacylglycerol formation or activate protein kinase C. However, PGE1 did elevate cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration as measured with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator quin 2. 8-Bromo-cAMP and forskolin were inactive in this capacity. The Ca2+ ionophore A23187 increased the level of c-myc mRNA. Diacylglycerol and Ca2+ mediate the elevation of c-myc mRNA levels which is caused by platelet-derived growth factor and fibroblast growth factor (Kaibuchi, K., Tsuda, T., Kikuchi, A., Tanimoto, T., Yamashita, T., and Takai, Y. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 1187-1192). In contrast, the present results suggest that both cAMP and Ca2+ are involved in this PGE1-induced response in Swiss 3T3 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1541093433,"Incubation of hepatocytes from fasted rats with LiCl provoked a concentration- and time-dependent activation of glycogen synthase. This effect was observed in the absence of glucose in the incubation medium. No changes in the intracellular concentrations of ATP or glucose-6-phosphate were detected. Lithium was also able to activate glycogen synthase in the absence of extracellular calcium. If hepatocytes were incubated with lithium and insulin, an additive effect of both agents on glycogen synthase activity was observed. LiCl was also effective in activating the enzyme in hepatocytes obtained from fed rats. When hepatocytes were incubated with [33P]phosphate and then treated with LiCl, a decrease in the amount of [32P]phosphate incorporated in the enzyme was observed. This dephosphorylation affected two CNBr fragments of the enzyme (CB-2 and CB-1), suggesting that several phosphorylation sites were involved. Lithium was also able to activate glycogen phosphorylase from both fasted and fed rats. Phosphorylase activation was concentration- and time-dependent, either in the presence or absence of calcium in the incubation medium. These findings demonstrate that although lithium appears to mimic the effects of insulin on glycogen synthase activity, its mechanism of action must be different from that of the hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1568227881,"Glucose stimulation of islets is coupled with the rapid intracellular release of myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and arachidonic acid which in turn mobilize Ca2+ stored in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The metabolism of glucose is required for insulin secretion although the link between glucose metabolism and the cellular events resulting in insulin release is unknown. In digitonin-permeabilized islets, glucose 6-phosphate (0.5-4 mM) increased significantly the ATP-dependent Ca2+ content of the ER at a free Ca2+ concentration of 1 microM. At 0.2 microM free Ca2+, glucose 6-phosphate (2-10 mM) had a smaller effect. Glucose, phosphate, mannose 6-phosphate, and fructose 1,6-diphosphate had no effect on the ATP-dependent Ca2+ content of the ER. Glucose 1-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate also increased ATP-dependent Ca2+ content of the ER, presumably due to conversion to glucose 6-phosphate by islet phosphoglucomutase and phosphoglucoisomerase, respectively. The glucose 6-phosphate increase in the ATP-dependent Ca2+ content of the ER was shown to be mediated by glucose 6-phosphatase localized to the ER. Both arachidonic acid (10 microM) and the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (2 microM) mobilized Ca2+ stored in the ER by glucose 6-phosphate. However, IP3-induced (10 microM) Ca2+ release from the ER was abolished in the presence of glucose 6-phosphate (0.5-10 mM). We propose that glucose 6-phosphate could provide a regulatory link between glucose metabolism and intracellular Ca2+ regulation by augmenting Ca2+ sequestered in the ER as well as attenuating IP3-induced Ca2+ release. Thus, glucose 6-phosphate would serve as an off signal leading to a decrease in intracellular Ca2+ when both the free Ca2+ and glucose 6-phosphate concentrations have increased following glucose stimulus."
https://openalex.org/W1497060658,"Potential bisubstrate analogs, in which the 5'-hydroxyl group of adenosine was joined to the phosphoryl group acceptor by polyphosphoryl bridges of varying length (ApnX, where n is the number of phosphoryl groups and X is the nucleoside moiety of the acceptor), were tested as inhibitors of human liver adenosine kinase and of thymidylate kinase from peripheral blast cells of patients with acute myelocytic leukemia. Adenosine kinase was most strongly inhibited by P1,P4-(diadenosine 5')-tetraphosphate (Kd = 30 nM) and P1,P5-(diadenosine 5')-pentaphosphate (Kd = 73 nM). Thymidylate kinase was most strongly inhibited by P1-(adenosine 5')-P5-(thymidine 5')-pentaphosphate (Kd = 120 nM) and by P1(adenosine 5')-P6-(thymidine 5')-hexaphosphate (Kd = 43 nM). In these enzymes, as in adenylate and thymidylate kinases, strongest inhibition was achieved in compounds containing one or two more phosphoryl groups than the substrates combined. These results support the view that nucleoside and nucleotide kinases mediate direct transfer of phosphoryl groups from ATP to acceptors, rather than acting by a double displacement mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1578655160,"A cDNA clone encoding the entire E1 envelope protein (410 amino acid residues) and a portion of the C-terminal end of the E2 envelope protein of the rubella virus has been isolated and characterized. DNA sequence analysis has revealed a region 20 nucleotides in length at the 3' end of the cloned cDNA which may be a replicase recognition site or a recognition site for encapsidation. The proteolytic cleavage site between the E1 and E2 proteins was localized based on the known amino-terminal sequence of the isolated E1 protein (Kalkkinen, N., Oker-Blom, C., and Pettersson, R. F. (1984) J. Gen. Virol. 65, 1549-1557) and the deduced amino acid sequence. The mature E1 protein is preceded by a set of 20 highly hydrophobic amino acid residues possessing characteristics of a peptide. This signal peptide is flanked on both sides by typical protease cleavage sites for trypsin-like enzyme and peptidase. The presence of a leader sequence in the E1 protein precursor may facilitate its translocation through the host cell membrane. The E1 protein of rubella virus shows no significant homology with alphavirus E1 envelope proteins. However, a stretch of 39 amino acids in the E1 protein of rubella virus (residues 262-300) was found to share a significant homology with the first 39 residues of bovine sperm histone. The position of 4 half-cystines and 8 arginines overlaps. The E1 protein of rubella virus has been successfully expressed in COS cells after transfecting them with rubella virus cDNA in simian virus 40-derived expression vector. This protein is antigenically similar to the one expressed by cells infected with rubella virus."
https://openalex.org/W1508568519,"Cytochrome c oxidase has been purified from the ammonia oxidizing chemoautotroph Nitrosomonas europaea by ion-exchange chromatography in the presence of Triton X-100. The enzyme has absorption maxima at 420 and 592 nm in the resting state and at 444 and 598 nm in the dithionite-reduced form; optical extinction coefficient (598 nm minus 640 nm) = 21.9 cm-1 nM-1. The enzyme has approximately 11 nmol of heme a and approximately 11 nmol of copper per mg of protein (Lowry procedure). There appear to be three subunits (approximate molecular weights 50,800, 38,400, and 35,500), two heme groups (a and a3), and two copper atoms per minimal unit. The EPR spectra of the resting and partially reduced enzyme are remarkably similar to the corresponding spectra of the mitochondrial aa3-type oxidase. Although the enzyme had been previously classified as cytochrome on the basis of its ferrous alpha absorption maximum (598 nm), its metal content and EPR spectral properties clearly show that it is better classified as a aa3. Neither the data reported here nor a review of the literature supports the existence of a1 as an entity discrete from aa3. The purified enzyme is reduced rapidly by ferrous horse heart c or c-554 from N. europaea, but not with c-552 from N. europaea. The identity of the natural electron donor is as yet unestablished. With horse heart c as electron donor, the purified enzyme could account for a significant portion of the terminal oxidase activity in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1541354727,"A mutagenesis approach was initiated in order to examine further the folding behavior of the alpha-subunit of the Escherichia coli tryptophan synthase. A random single base pair saturation mutagenesis procedure (Myers, R.M., Lerman, L.S., and Maniatis, T. (1985) Science 229, 242-247) was applied in vitro to subcloned fragments of the trpA gene, which codes for this polypeptide. Mutagenesis plasmid vectors were constructed containing three fragments of the trpA gene which together code for about half of the total amino acid residues of the alpha-subunit. The vectors were constructed such that each strand of each trpA fragment could be altered. These trpA fragments were mutagenized in vitro (using nitrous acid, formic acid, hydrazine, and potassium permanganate), and several thousands of mutants have been isolated. Thirty-two mutants, contained within the first two trpA fragments (which encompass the first 206 base pairs of the trpA gene and encode the first 63 residues of the alpha-subunit) have been sequenced. Of these, 20 (63%) contained single base pair alterations, 12 (37%) contained multiple alterations, and 17 (53%) of these base pair alterations resulted in single amino acid substitutions. Selected mutant trpA fragments were subcloned into an overexpression vector in which the trpA gene is controlled by the tac promoter and is inducible by lactose. The kinetics and extent of induction show that after 22 h of induction, the wild-type alpha-subunit constituted about 30% of the total protein. A simple one-step purification procedure for the alpha-subunit is described in which 15 mg of alpha-subunit can be obtained from 200 ml of fully induced cultures. The mutant trpA genes were induced for mutant alpha-subunit expression, and an initial examination of their properties in crude extracts was performed. Of the 17 mutant proteins examined, most were overproduced to levels comparable to that for the wild-type alpha-subunit. An analysis of the apparent stability, beta 2-subunit-activating activity, and intrinsic activity of this group of mutant alpha-subunits suggests that many amino acid alterations have no apparent effect; there is a variety of novel functional defects; and a sequence located near residues 28 through 54 may be particularly critical for the normal folding of the polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W2153838014,"Sodium and potassium ion-transport adenosine triphosphatase from dog kidney was incubated with 0.4-2 mM Ca2+ at 23 degrees C for more than 2 min in the absence of monovalent inorganic cations, cooled to 0 degrees C, and phosphorylated from 1 mM Pi with 2.4 mM MgCl2. The resultant phosphoenzyme resembled that obtained by incubating the enzyme with K+ in place of Ca2+ in six respects. It was concluded that Ca2+ can occupy the monovalent cation-binding center for K+. The rate constant for release of Ca2+ from the dephosphoenzyme at 0 degrees C was 0.17 s-1. The rate of release from the phosphoenzyme was at least 7-fold slower. Phosphorylation stabilized the binding of Ca2+ to the enzyme in contrast to its destabilization of the corresponding K X enzyme complex. K-sensitive phosphoenzyme did not respond to free Ca2+. Thus Ca2+ was not easily accepted by nor released from the phosphoenzyme and would not be an effective substrate for transport. A selective barrier against Ca2+ between the monovalent cation binding center and the extracellular solution is proposed. Release of calcium from the dephosphoenzyme yielded a conformation that was not phosphorylated from Pi. The enzyme changed the conformation of its center for phosphorylation before or at the same time that it changed the conformation of its center for ion transport."
https://openalex.org/W1587590466,"Upon infection of Escherichia coli with bacteriophage Mu, a 64-kDa protein is injected into the host cell along with the phage DNA. This protein is involved in circularizing the infecting Mu DNA (Harshey, R. M., and Bukhari, A. I. (1983) J. Mol. Biol. 167, 427-441; Puspurs, A. H., Trun, N. J., and Reeve, J. N. (1983) EMBO J. 2, 345-352). Its possible role in the integration of infecting Mu DNA and in the infection process remains to be established. To identify the source of this protein we have prepared antiserum to the protein purified from viral particles. We have shown that the antiserum is specific for the Mu N gene product. The antiserum has been used to immunologically screen a Mu DNA library cloned into an expression vector. Four clones have been shown to produce a protein of 64 kDa that is specifically bound by the antiserum. The only Mu gene common to all four clones is the N gene, as demonstrated by physical and genetic mapping. We have also demonstrated by peptide mapping that the cloned N gene product is identical to the 64-kDa protein found complexed with the injected Mu DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1520835721,"Two steroid binding states of an estrogen receptor each with different equilibrium constants (Kd values) Rx (Kd = 0.06 nM) and Ry (Kd = 0.8 nM) have been identified and characterized in the hen and estrogen-stimulated chick oviduct. A third nonestrogen binding form of the receptor, designated Rnb, is now described which exists in short-term estrogen withdrawn chick oviduct cytosol. A model is presented in which the receptor can be interconverted between the three states. The interconversion is monitored by Scatchard analysis, sucrose density gradient analysis, and affinity labeling using [3H]tamoxifen aziridine followed by receptor purification with estrogen receptor monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. The results are consistent with each state existing in different conformations having a common molecular weight of approximately 66,000. This paper defines the conditions and nucleotide requirements for the Rnb to Ry conversion. The conversion to the steroid binding form is induced by ATP, ADP, and GTP. Cyclic nucleotides are ineffective. There is a specific requirement for Mg2+; neither Ca2+ nor Mn2+ will substitute. Nonhydrolyzable nucleotide analogues were tested for their relative efficiency to convert Rnb to Ry. Conversion occurred with alpha,beta-methylene adenosine triphosphate, but beta,gamma-methylene adenosine triphosphate and alpha,beta-methylene adenosine diphosphate were inert. Thus, activation of Rnb to form Ry appears to be catalyzed by an event requiring the loss of the terminal phosphoryl moiety from either ATP or ADP. Receptor derived from conversion of Rnb to Ry has the same physical properties as native Ry. Activation of Rnb is to Ry specifically; no increase in the Rx form of estrogen receptor was ever observed. The accompanying paper similarly describes the Rx to Ry conversion. Since these data also explain observations made with glucocorticoid and with epidermal growth factor receptors, it is speculated that the receptor interconversion model may have general application to hormone action."
https://openalex.org/W1492097204,"Newly replicated duplex DNA minicircles of trypanosomal kinetoplast DNA are nicked in both their monomeric and catenated topological states, whereas mature ones are covalently sealed. The possibility that nicking may play a role during kinetoplast DNA replication by affecting the topological interconversions of monomeric DNA minicircles and catenane networks was studied here in vitro using Crithidia fasciculata DNA topoisomerase. An enzyme that catalyzes the nicking of duplex DNA circles has been purified to apparent homogeneity from C. fasciculata cell extracts. The native enzyme has a sedimentation coefficient of 6.8 S and was found to be a dimer with a protomer Mr = 60,000. Nicking of kinetoplast DNA networks by the purified enzyme inhibits their decatenation by the Crithidia DNA topoisomerase but has no effect on the catenation of monomeric DNA minicircles into networks. This differential effect on decatenation versus catenation is specific to the purified nicking enzyme. Random nicking of interlocked DNA minicircles has no detectable effect on the reversibility of the topological reaction. The potential role of Crithidia nicking enzyme in the replication of kinetoplast DNA networks in trypanosomatids is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1544387912,"Growth hormone-releasing factor (GRF) stimulates the release of growth hormone from the anterior pituitary and is related to the peptides of the glucagon/secretin family. Although the mechanism of action of this hormone has been studied in considerable detail, little is known concerning the GRF receptor itself. We have attempted to label the GRF receptor by chemically coupling the 125I-GRF analog [His1, Nle27]-hGRF(1-32)-NH2 (GRFa) (where Nle is norleucine) to plated rat anterior pituitary cells with the protein cross-linker disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) (0.1 mM). Verification of biological activity of the 125I-GRFa was confirmed prior to the cross-linking experiments using the reverse hemolytic plaque assay. Whole cell extracts prepared from the cross-linked cells were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography of the dried gels. Four bands of 72, 50, 30, and 26 kDa were detected in autoradiograms from cells exposed to the labeled analog for 20 min (22 degrees C) followed by exposure to DSS for 2 min. The 72-kDa band was interpreted to be bovine serum albumin, which was used as a carrier in initial studies. The 50- and 30-kDa bands were very faint and probably represent nonspecific binding sites since they were unchanged in the presence of excess unlabeled GRFa. The 26-kDa band was diminished in a concentration-dependent manner by unlabeled rat GRF, GRFa, and to a lesser extent by vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). It is unlikely, however, that GRFa was acting at a VIP receptor since the labeled analog did not induce prolactin secretion (VIP is a prolactin secretagogue). GRFa also increased cellular cAMP to levels similar to GRF and greater than VIP. Autoradiographs from gels run under nonreducing conditions revealed the 26-kDa band as the major species, indicating that, if a polymeric form of this binding protein exists, it does not involve disulfide linkages. Thus, the best candidate for the putative GRF receptor is the 26-kDa band. We have further demonstrated that the higher concentrations of DSS used previously (5 mM) result in diffuse autoradiograms with multiple bands, suggesting that caution should be exercised when interpreting cross-linking data under these conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1494499936,"We have previously reported that the estrogen receptor exists in three distinct states in the oviduct of the estrogen-treated chick. Since two of these forms bind estrogen and possess a number of similar properties, the intrinsic relationship between these two receptor forms has been investigated. We now show that a quantitative conversion of the high affinity (Rx) to the lower affinity (Ry) state can be induced by mild heating (30 degrees C) in the presence of estradiol and ATP, or the synthetic analogue alpha,beta-methylene adenosine triphosphate and the divalent cation Mg2+. Other nucleotides, including ADP, GTP, CTP, cAMP, and cGMP, as well as the nonhydrolyzable analogues beta,gamma-methylene adenosine triphosphate and alpha,beta-methylene adenosine diphosphate are ineffective. The conversion occurs only partially in the absence of estradiol but completely in its presence. The process is not inhibited by the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and alpha 2-macroglobulin, and when conversion is induced by low concentrations of ATP (1 mM), a time dependent reequilibration back to Rx occurs. These observations and the fact that the pure hormone-binding peptides Rx and Ry have similar molecular weights on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels (66,000) confirm that proteolysis is not involved in the conversion. Moreover their physical properties suggest that Rx and Ry exist in alternate conformations, with Ry being favored as a result of an ATP-mediated event involving the gamma-phosphoryl moiety. The biological relevance of the receptor conversion is suggested by studies with the antiestrogen hydroxytamoxifen. This antiestrogen binds to Rx with higher affinity than either estradiol or diethylstilbestrol but with low affinity to Ry. Hydroxytamoxifen also inhibits the conversion of Rx to Ry. Since this antiestrogen is a complete antagonist in the chick oviduct and prevents estradiol-induced stimulation of ovalbumin gene transcription, it is speculated that Rx to Ry conversion is crucial for ovalbumin gene activation and that Rx may act as a transcriptional repressor. Furthermore, since Rx and Ry both bind to nuclei and DNA, it is proposed that the presence of Ry is a better predictor of ovalbumin gene activation than DNA binding alone."
https://openalex.org/W1559831726,"We have recently shown that inactivation of renal Na,K-ATPase by 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide occurs via an intramolecular cross-link formed between an activated carboxyl group and an endogenous nucleophile (Pedemonte, C.H., and Kaplan, J.H. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 3632-3639). The modified enzyme shows the same level of Rb+ binding as untreated enzyme: 3.16 and 2.93 ATP-sensitive mumol of Rb+ binding/mumol of phosphoenzyme, respectively. Thus, the Rb+ binding site and the transition accomplished by low affinity nucleotide binding which accelerates de-occlusion are not greatly affected by the carbodiimide inactivation. 1 mM K+ reduces the ADP binding to the high affinity nucleotide binding site to the same extent in normal and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide-treated enzyme and Na+ counteracts this effect. Thus, the competition between Na+ and K+ ions for binding to the free enzyme are also largely unaltered by the modification. Phosphorylation from ATP (microM) in the presence of Na+ and Mg2+ ions and from inorganic phosphate in the presence of Mg2+ ions (in the absence or presence of ouabain) is greatly inhibited (85%) following carbodiimide treatment. The extent of inhibition of phosphorylation quantitatively correlates with the residual Na,K-ATPase activity (15%). Consequently, the rate of inactivation by carbodiimide is reduced when a greater proportion of the enzyme is in the phosphorylated form. Fluoroscein isothiocyanate, which inhibits the Na,K-ATPase by covalently modifying a lysine residue close to the high affinity binding site for ATP in the alpha-subunit does not bind to the carbodiimide-inactivated enzyme. Since high affinity nucleotide binding is only partially inhibited by the modification produced by the carbodiimide this suggests that the lysine residue to which fluoroscein isothiocyanate binds is not specifically required for competent nucleotide binding."

By contrast, under the same conditions, neither the plasmid copy number nor the G gene mRNA levels were detectably affected by interferon treatment. Likewise, the synthesis of simian virus 40 large T-antigen was not inhibited by interferon treatment of transfected COS cells even though the synthesis of vesicular stomatitis virus G protein was markedly inhibited.

https://openalex.org/W1543029954,"The proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of several chloroperoxidase-inhibitor complexes have been investigated. Titrations of chloroperoxidase with azide, thiocyanate, cyanate, or nitrite ions indicate that only the chloroperoxidase-thiocyanate complex exhibits slow ligand exchange on the 360-MHz NMR time scale. The temperature dependence of the proton NMR spectra of the complexes suggests that, although the complexes are predominantly low-spin ferric heme iron, a spin equilibrium is present presumably between S = 1/2 and S = 5/2 states. The pH dependence of the proton NMR spectra of the psuedo-halide-chloroperoxidase complexes was examined at 360 and 90 MHz. Chloroperoxidase complexes with azide and cyanate show similar behavior; 360-MHz proton spectra are readily observed at low pH (less than 5.0) but not at high pH. At high pH, the ligand exchange rate falls in an intermediate time range. When the complexes are examined at 90 MHz, however, spectra consisting of averaged signals are observed. The chloroperoxidase-thiocyanate complex does not form at high pH values; the proton NMR spectrum observed is that of native chloroperoxidase. The pKa for the chloroperoxidase-thiocyanate heme-linked ionizable amino acid residue falls between 4.2 and 5.0. Only an averaged azide signal was observed in the nitrogen-15 NMR spectra for solutions that contained the azide complex of chloroperoxidase, horseradish peroxidase, and myoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W1592720458,"We have used a model system consisting of two human hepatoma cell lines, Hep G2, representing well differentiated normal hepatocytes, and PLC/PRF/5, representing poorly differentiated malignant hepatocytes, to demonstrate that the differential presence of asialoglycoprotein receptor activity in these cell lines can be used to influence transferrin-mediated iron uptake. We based our experiments on the following facts: Hep G2 cells possess receptors that bind, internalize, and degrade galactose-terminal (asialo-)glycoproteins; PLC/PRF/5 cells have barely detectable asialoglycoprotein receptor activity; both cell lines possess active transferrin-mediated iron uptake; transferrin releases iron during acidification of intracellular vesicular compartments; primary amines, e.g. primaquine, inhibit acidification and iron release from transferrin. When added to culture medium, [55Fe]transferrin delivered 55Fe well to both cell lines. As expected, in the presence of [55Fe]transferrin, free primaquine caused a concentration-dependent decrease in 55Fe uptake in both cell lines. To create a targetable conjugate, primaquine was covalently coupled to asialofetuin to form asialofetuin-primaquine. When PLC/PRF/5 (asialoglycoprotein receptor (-)) cells were preincubated with this conjugate, transferrin-mediated 55Fe uptake was unaffected. However, transferrin-mediated 55Fe uptake by Hep G2 (asialoglycoprotein receptor (+)) cells under identical conditions was specifically decreased by 55% compared to control cells incubated without the conjugate."
