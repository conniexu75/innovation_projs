https://openalex.org/W2037328290,"Ghrelin, a circulating appetite-inducing hormone, is derived from a prohormone by posttranslational processing. On the basis of the bioinformatic prediction that another peptide also derived from proghrelin exists, we isolated a hormone from rat stomach and named it obestatin—a contraction of obese, from the Latin “obedere,” meaning to devour, and “statin,” denoting suppression. Contrary to the appetite-stimulating effects of ghrelin, treatment of rats with obestatin suppressed food intake, inhibited jejunal contraction, and decreased body-weight gain. Obestatin bound to the orphan G protein–coupled receptor GPR39. Thus, two peptide hormones with opposing action in weight regulation are derived from the same ghrelin gene. After differential modification, these hormones activate distinct receptors."

Positional cloning identified Ppd-H1 , the major determinant of barley photoperiod response, as a pseudo-response regulator, a class of genes involved in circadian clock function. Reduced photoperiod responsiveness of the ppd-H1 mutant, which is highly advantageous in spring-sown varieties, is explained by altered circadian expression of the photoperiod pathway gene CONSTANS and reduced expression of its downstream target, FT , a key regulator of flowering."
https://openalex.org/W2167150894,"During transcription, RNA polymerase (RNAP) moves processively along a DNA template, creating a complementary RNA. Here we present the development of an ultra-stable optical trapping system with ångström-level resolution, which we used to monitor transcriptional elongation by single molecules of Escherichia coli RNAP. Records showed discrete steps averaging 3.7 +/- 0.6 A, a distance equivalent to the mean rise per base found in B-DNA. By combining our results with quantitative gel analysis, we conclude that RNAP advances along DNA by a single base pair per nucleotide addition to the nascent RNA. We also determined the force-velocity relationship for transcription at both saturating and sub-saturating nucleotide concentrations; fits to these data returned a characteristic distance parameter equivalent to one base pair. Global fits were inconsistent with a model for movement incorporating a power stroke tightly coupled to pyrophosphate release, but consistent with a brownian ratchet model incorporating a secondary NTP binding site."

We determined the structure of V3 in the context of an HIV-1 gp120 core complexed to the CD4 receptor and to the X5 antibody at 3.5 angstrom resolution. Binding of gp120 to cell-surface CD4 would position V3 so that its coreceptor-binding tip protrudes 30 angstroms from the core toward the target cell membrane. The extended nature and antibody accessibility of V3 explain its immunodominance. Together, the results provide a structural rationale for the role of V3 in HIV entry and neutralization."
https://openalex.org/W2058982772,"In animals, the majority of microRNAs regulate gene expression through the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery without inducing small-interfering RNA (siRNA)-directed mRNA cleavage1. Thus, the mechanisms by which microRNAs repress their targets have remained elusive. Recently, Argonaute proteins, which are key RNAi effector components, and their target mRNAs were shown to localize to cytoplasmic foci known as P-bodies or GW-bodies2,3. Here, we show that the Argonaute proteins physically interact with a key P-/GW-body subunit, GW182. Silencing of GW182 delocalizes resident P-/GW-body proteins and impairs the silencing of microRNA reporters. Moreover, mutations that prevent Argonaute proteins from localizing in P-/GW-bodies prevent translational repression of mRNAs even when Argonaute is tethered to its target in a siRNA-independent fashion. Thus, our results support a functional link between cytoplasmic P-bodies and the ability of a microRNA to repress expression of a target mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2059412749,"The primary event that initiates vision is the light-induced 11-cis to all-trans isomerization of retinal in the visual pigment rhodopsin. Despite decades of study with the traditional tools of chemical reaction dynamics, both the timing and nature of the atomic motions that lead to photoproduct production remain unknown. We used femtosecond-stimulated Raman spectroscopy to obtain time-resolved vibrational spectra of the molecular structures formed along the reaction coordinate. The spectral evolution of the vibrational features from 200 femtoseconds to 1 picosecond after photon absorption reveals the temporal sequencing of the geometric changes in the retinal backbone that activate this receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2089498979,"Rapid global warming of 5° to 10°C during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) coincided with major turnover in vertebrate faunas, but previous studies have found little floral change. Plant fossils discovered in Wyoming, United States, show that PETM floras were a mixture of native and migrant lineages and that plant range shifts were large and rapid (occurring within 10,000 years). Floral composition and leaf shape and size suggest that climate warmed by ∼5°C during the PETM and that precipitation was low early in the event and increased later. Floral response to warming and/or increased atmospheric CO 2 during the PETM was comparable in rate and magnitude to that seen in postglacial floras and to the predicted effects of anthropogenic carbon release and climate change on future vegetation."
https://openalex.org/W1996917852,"Plants and cyanobacteria produce atmospheric dioxygen from water, powered by sunlight and catalyzed by a manganese complex in photosystem II. A classic S-cycle model for oxygen evolution involves five states, but only four have been identified. The missing S 4 state is particularly important because it is directly involved in dioxygen formation. Now progress comes from an x-ray technique that can monitor redox and structural changes in metal centers in real time with 10-microsecond resolution. We show that in the O 2 -formation step, an intermediate is formed—the enigmatic S 4 state. Its creation is identified with a deprotonation process rather than the expected electron-transfer mechanism. Subsequent electron transfer would give an additional S 4 ′ state, thus extending the fundamental S-state cycle of dioxygen formation."

https://openalex.org/W2131847864,"We have identified a small-molecule inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) that promotes subunit disassembly of this trimeric cytokine family member. The compound inhibits TNF-alpha activity in biochemical and cell-based assays with median inhibitory concentrations of 22 and 4.6 micromolar, respectively. Formation of an intermediate complex between the compound and the intact trimer results in a 600-fold accelerated subunit dissociation rate that leads to trimer dissociation. A structure solved by x-ray crystallography reveals that a single compound molecule displaces a subunit of the trimer to form a complex with a dimer of TNF-alpha subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1971890898,"We demonstrate Mach-Zehnder-type interferometry in a superconducting flux qubit. The qubit is a tunable artificial atom, whose ground and excited states exhibit an avoided crossing. Strongly driving the qubit with harmonic excitation sweeps it through the avoided crossing two times per period. As the induced Landau-Zener transitions act as coherent beamsplitters, the accumulated phase between transitions, which varies with microwave amplitude, results in quantum interference fringes for n=1...20 photon transitions. The generalization of optical Mach-Zehnder interferometry, performed in qubit phase space, provides an alternative means to manipulate and characterize the qubit in the strongly-driven regime."

It is now well established that Aβ exists as monomers, oligomers, and fibrils. To study the temporal profile of Aβ oligomer formation in vivo and to determine their interaction with tau pathology, we used the 3xTg-AD mice, which develop a progressive accumulation of plaques and tangles and cognitive impairments. We show that SDS-resistant Aβ oligomers accumulate in an age-dependent fashion, and we present evidence to show that oligomerization of Aβ appears to first occur intraneuronally. Finally, we show that a single intrahippocampal injection of a specific oligomeric antibody is sufficient to clear Aβ pathology, and more importantly, tau pathology. Therefore, Aβ oligomers may play a role in the induction of tau pathology, making the interference of Aβ oligomerization a valid therapeutic target.

Alzheimer disease (AD) 2The abbreviations used are: ADAlzheimer diseaseAβamyloid-βLTPlong term potentiation. is the most common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting ∼5 million Americans (1Hebert L.E. Scherr P.A. Bienias J.L. Bennett D.A. Evans D.A. Arch. Neurol. 2003; 60: 1119-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1947) Google Scholar). Neuropathologically, it is characterized by the accumulation of extracellular plaques, mainly comprised of a small peptide called amyloid-β (Aβ), and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, consisting of aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein (2Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5196) Google Scholar). Based on compelling genetic evidence, it has been postulated that pathological assemblies of Aβ are the cause of all forms of AD (3Hardy J. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (11121) Google Scholar), whereas tau pathology and other neuropathological changes are a downstream consequence of the pathological accumulation of Aβ species. This hypothesis has received strong experimental support from studies of various transgenic models of AD (4Lewis J. Dickson D.W. Lin W.L. Chisholm L. Corral A. Jones G. Yen S.H. Sahara N. Skipper L.

Traditionally, Aβ has been viewed as being generated and secreted extracellularly, but it is also becoming increasingly apparent that some Aβ can be generated in different intracellular compartments, such as the endoplasmic reticulum and the trans-Golgi (7Cook D.G.

Moreover, there is mounting evidence to support a pathophysiologic role for intracellular Aβ in AD an Down syndrome (see Ref. 12Tseng B.P. Kitazawa M. LaFerla F.M. Curr.

Aβ exists in several different physical states, including as monomers, oligomers, or fibrils. Evidence from in vitro studies demonstrates that synthetic Aβ monomers aggregate in a time-dependent fashion to form oligomers, which eventually may form fibrils (13Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B.

During the last decade, in vitro and in vivo experimental evidence points to soluble Aβ oligomers, also referred to as Aβ-derived diffusible ligands, as the predominant neurotoxic species for neurons (16Klein W.L. Neurochem. Int. 2002; 41: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 17Glabe C.C. Subcell. Biochem. 2005; 38: 167-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this regard, Aβ oligomers are very potent toxic species, as even nanomolar concentrations have been shown to kill mature neurons in hippocampal slices (18Lambert M.P. Barlow A.K. Chromy B.A. Edwards C. Freed R. Liosatos M. Morgan T.E. Rozovsky I. Trommer B. Viola K.L. Wals P. Zhang C. Finch C.E. Krafft G.A. Klein W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6448-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (3144) Google Scholar). Moreover, Aβ oligomers appear to interfere with many critical neuronal activities, including inhibiting long term potentiation (LTP) in organotypic hippocampal slices (18Lambert M.P. Barlow A.K. Chromy B.A. Edwards C. Freed R. Liosatos M. Morgan T.E. Rozovsky I. Trommer B. Viola K.L. Wals P. Zhang C. Finch C.E. Krafft G.A. Klein W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Brain Res. 2002; 924: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Aβ oligomers can also cause calcium dysregulation and membrane disruption, thus interfering with overall cell functioning (20Demuro A. Mina E. Kayed R. Milton S.C. Parker I. Glabe C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17294-17300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 21Kayed R. Sokolov Y. Edmonds B. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Hall J.E. Glabe C.G. J. Biol.

In particular, intracerebroventricular injection of oligomers inhibits LTP (22Walsh D.M. Klyubin I. Fadeeva J.V. Cullen W.K. Anwyl R. Wolfe M.S. Rowan M.J. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 2002; 416: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (3721) Google Scholar) and specifically disrupts cognitive function (23Cleary J.P. Walsh D.M. Hofmeister J.J. Shankar G.M. Kuskowski M.A. Selkoe D.J. Ashe K.H. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar). Importantly, the concomitant injection of the anti-Aβ antibody 6E10 with Aβ oligomers neutralizes the oligomer-induced LTP dysfunction (24Klyubin I. Walsh D.M. Lemere C.A. Cullen W.K. Shankar G.M. Betts V. Spooner E.T. Jiang L. Anwyl R. Selkoe D.J. Rowan M.J. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 556-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). These data strongly support the idea that oligomers represent a fundamental species responsible for mediating Aβ toxicity in AD (2Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5196) Google Scholar, 16Klein W.L. Neurochem. Int. 2002; 41: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Given the critical role that Aβ oligomers appear to play in the pathogenesis of AD, we sought to understand their genesis in an in vivo model of AD. We used the 3xTg-AD mice, which develop an age-dependent accumulation of both plaques and tangles in AD-relevant brain regions (25Oddo S. Caccamo A. Shepherd J.D. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Kayed R. Metherate R. Mattson M.P. Akbari Y. LaFerla F.M. Neuron. 2003; 39: 409-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3229) Google Scholar). We first charted the temporal relationship between Aβ monomers, oligomers, and fibrils formation. Of particular relevance, we found that oligomerization of Aβ appears to commence intraneuronally in the 3xTg-AD brains, a finding consistent with other in vitro and in vivo studies (26Kawarabayashi T. Shoji M. Younkin L.H. Wen-Lang L. Dickson D.W. Murakami T. Matsubara E. Abe K. Ashe K.H. Younkin S.G. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 3801-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 27Takahashi R.H.

Selkoe D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10831-10839Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). As we previously showed that the administration of Aβ-specific antibodies reduces not only the Aβ pathology but also early forms of tau pathology (6Oddo S. Billings L. Kesslak J.P. Cribbs D.H. LaFerla F.M. Neuron. 2004; 43: 321-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar), here we extended these studies and showed that the administration of an Aβ oligomeric-specific antibody is also able to reduce the tau pathology in these mice. These findings suggest that the action of Aβ oligomers may be a key event in the initiation of the tau pathology. Mice—We previously described the generation of the 3xTg-AD mice (25Oddo S. Caccamo A. Shepherd J.D. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Kayed R. Metherate R. Mattson M.P. Akbari Y. LaFerla F.M. Neuron. 2003; 39: 409-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3229) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 3xTg-AD mice were derived by co-microinjecting two independent transgenes encoding human APPSwe and the human tauP301L (both under control of the mouse Thy1.2-regulatory element) into single-cell embryos harvested from homozygous mutant PS1M146V knock-in (PS1-KI) mice. Immunoblotting—Brains from 3xTg-AD and NonTg mice were homogenized in 2% SDS supplemented with a complete miniprotease inhibitor tablet (Roche Diagnostics). The homogenized mixes were briefly sonicated to sheer the DNA and centrifuged at 4 °C for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The supernatant was used for dot blot and Western blot. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay, and samples were adjusted with 2% SDS to the same concentration. For the dot blot, brain extracts were applied to a nitrocellulose membrane and air-dried. For the Western blot, brain extracts were heated in loading buffer (NuPAGE LDS sample buffer from Invitrogen) for 10 min at 70 °C and resolved by SDS-PAGE (10% Bis-Tris from Invitrogen) under reducing conditions and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were incubated in a 5% solution of nonfat dry milk for 1 h at 20 °C. After overnight incubation at 4 °C with primary antibody, the blots were washed in Tween 20-TBS (T-TBS) (0.02% Tween 20, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 nm NaCl) for 20 min and incubated at 20 °C with the appropriate secondary antibody for 1 h. The blots were washed in T-TBS for 20 min and incubated for 5 min with Super Signal (Pierce), washed, and exposed. Immunohistochemistry—Brains from 3xTg-AD and NonTg mice were fixed for 48 h in 4% paraformaldehyde. Free-floating sections (50-μm thick) were obtained using a vibratome slicing system (Pelco, Redding, CA) and stored in 0.02% sodium azide in phosphate-buffered saline. The endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched for 30 min in 3% H2O2. Sections were then incubated in 90% formic acid for 7 min to expose the epitope. The appropriate primary antibody was applied overnight at 4 °C. Sections were washed with TBS and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody for 1 h at 20°C. Sections were developed with diaminobenzidine substrate using the avidin-biotin horseradish peroxidase system (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). For confocal microscopy, after incubating the sections in the appropriate primary antibody, suitable Alexa Fluor secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) was applied. Subsequently, sections were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, mounted on slide and coverslip with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Surgeries—3xTg-AD and NonTg mice (12-months old) were anesthetized with 0.6 ml/25 g of body weight of avertin (1.3% tribromoethanol, 0.8% amylalcohol) and placed in a stereotactic apparatus (MyNeuroLab, St. Louis, MO) with a mouse adaptor. 2 μg of the A11 antibody, an isotype control antibody (anti-protozoan) or phosphate-buffered saline were injected into the left hippocampus through a 33-gauge injector attached to a 5-μl Hamilton syringe (Hamilton Company, Reno, NV). The coordinates, with respect to bregma, were -2.7 mm posterior, +2.5 mm lateral, and -2.0 mm ventral to the skull. The rate of injection was 1 μl/min, after which the cannula was left in place for an additional 5 min to allow for diffusion. Animals were kept on a warming pad until they had fully recovered from anesthesia and were kept in individual cages until they were sacrificed for tissue processing to prevent damage to the scalp sutures. All animal procedures were in accordance with the National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the UCI IACUC. All appropriate measures were taken to minimize pain and discomfort in experimental animals. Statistical Analysis—Data were subsequently analyzed by analysis of variance or t test comparison, using Graphpad Prism software. The development of oligomeric-specific antibodies has greatly facilitated the understanding of the role of oligomers in the pathogenesis AD. In this study we used antibody M71/3, which is highly sensitive and detects minute amounts of low molecular weight Aβ oligomers (12–24 mers) (29Gong Y. Chang L. Viola K.L. Lacor P.N. Lambert M.P.

Neurosci. 2003; 20: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and antibody A11, which is selective for higher molecular weight Aβ oligomers (31Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3470) Google Scholar). Neither of these antibodies cross-react with Aβ monomers or natively folded amyloid precursor protein (29Gong Y. Chang L. Viola K.L. Lacor P.N. Lambert M.P. Finch C.E. Krafft G.A. Klein W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10417-10422Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 31Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3470) Google Scholar). Aβ Oligomers Are First Detected Intraneuronally—We first defined the temporal profile of Aβ oligomers in the brain of the 3xTg-AD mice using both biochemical and immunohistochemical methods. Brains from 3xTg-AD and age-matched NonTg were extracted in 2% SDS, and the resultant proteins were applied to a nitrocellulose membrane, which was subsequently probed with the oligomer-specific antibodies M71/3 and A11. At 2 months of age, the signal intensity was comparable between the 3xTg-AD and NonTg samples, suggesting that Aβ oligomers have not yet built up to any significant extent (Fig. 1A). Although the NonTg signal remained low across all time points, there was an age-dependent increase in M71/3- and A11-specific immunoreactivity in the 3xTg-AD samples, first apparent by 6 months of age (Fig. 1, A and B). Thus, oligomerization of Aβ starts between 2 and 6 months of age. Interestingly, we found that the intensity of both M71/3 and A11 immunoreactivity was significantly lower at 9 and 12 months of age compared with the 6 months time point (Fig. 1, A and B). Although the reason for this decrease in oligomer levels during these ages is not clear, it may be because of an increase in Aβ fibrillarization that occurs at these ages (see below). This transient reduction occurs within a narrow time frame as between 12 and 20 months, we again found an age-dependent increase in Aβ oligomers in the 3xTg-AD brains (Fig. 1, A and B). Aβ oligomers appear to be relatively stable structures, as SDS-resistant species have been isolated from post-mortem human brains and cell lines (22Walsh D.M. Klyubin I. Fadeeva J.V. Cullen W.K.

J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). We determined whether SDS-resistant Aβ oligomers could also be isolated from the 3xTg-AD brains and resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Following preparation of protein extracts in 2% SDS, we detected SDS-resistant Aβ dimers, trimers, and pentamers in brain samples from 20-month-old mice by Western blot using 6E10 (Fig. 1C). We were unable to detect Aβ (monomeric or oligomeric) in younger mice using this particular immunoblotting approach, perhaps because Aβ oligomers are not yet SDS-resistant and/or their presence is below threshold for detection by a Western blot. These data indicate that the SDS-resistant oligomers build-up in an age-dependent fashion in the 3xTg-AD mice and are readily detectable in older mice. Results from several in vitro studies suggest that Aβ oligomers may be a transient intermediate stage leading to plaque formation; however, recent studies have also raised the possibility that Aβ oligomers could be more stable and not convert into fibrils (34Souillac P.O.

To determine the temporal relationship between these two Aβ species in vivo, we charted their accumulation in the hippocampus of the 3xTg-AD mice using antibody 6E10 (which detects all forms of Aβ), M71/3 (which detects low molecular weight Aβ oligomers at the fentomole levels) (30Chang L. Bakhos L. Wang Z. Venton D.L. Klein W.L. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2003; 20: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and thioflavine S staining (to identify fibrillar Aβ deposits). We focused on the hippocampus because this brain region is highly affected by Aβ pathology in both AD and in the 3xTg-AD mice; moreover, the well defined structural organization of the hippocampus facilitates the study of the temporal progression of Aβ aggregation. At 4 months of age, robust intraneuronal staining was apparent with antibody 6E10, but not with M71/3 or thioflavine S (Fig. 2, A–C), suggesting that the overwhelming majority of Aβ exists in a soluble, monomeric state at this age. At 6 months of age, 6E10 staining increased (Fig. 2D), and intraneuronal M71/3 immunoreactivity first becomes apparent (Fig. 2E), suggesting that oligomerization of Aβ occurs intraneuronally between 4–6 months of age (see also Fig. 3A). Notably, by 12 months, intraneuronal Aβ oligomers are no longer apparent in the CA1/subiculum, although we found a marked increase in M71/3 extracellular staining (c.f. Fig. 2, I and H). Because the M71/3 antibody does not discriminate between oligomers and fibrils, we cannot exclude the possibility that some of the positive material shown in Fig. 2H is fibrillar in nature. However, staining of an adjacent section with thioflavine S (Fig. 2I) reveals far less staining compared with that detected by M71/3, suggesting that the majority of the extracellular deposits shown in Fig. 2H is most likely extracellular Aβ oligomers. Thus, there is an age-dependent shift in M71/3 immunoreactivity in the CA1/subiculum region from predominantly intracellular to predominantly extracellular staining between 6 and 12 months. Please note that protein samples shown in the dot blot in Fig. 1 were prepared in 2% SDS, which may have disrupted some Aβ structures, thereby accounting for the lower levels at this time point compared with the immunohistochemistry data. The presence of extracellular Aβ oligomers appears to occur prior to extracellular thioflavine-positive plaques (Fig. 2I), providing correlative in vivo evidence that oligomers represent an intermediate step leading to plaque formation. However, these data do not exclude the possibility that a fraction of Aβ oligomers can be more stable structures or that these structures can be independent of fibrillarization.FIGURE 3Intraneuronal oligomers show different conformations. Sections from hippocampus (A–C) or cortex (D–F) of the 3xTg-AD mice were double stained with M71/3 and a C-terminal Aβ42-specific antibody and analyzed using confocal microscopy. As expected, a proportion of the deposits positive with the Aβ42-specific antibody are also positive for M71/3, as this antibody recognizes monomeric Aβ as well. Surprisingly, however, we found a proportion of M71/3-positive structures that are negative for Aβ42-specific antibodies (green staining in C), suggesting that intraneuronal oligomers exist in different conformations, one where the C-terminal of Aβ is accessible, and one where it is not. Original magnification for A–C is 80× and for D–F is 20×.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To better analyze the conformation of intraneuronal Aβ oligomers, we double labeled sections from the 3xTg-AD mice with M71/3 and Aβ42-specific antibodies and analyzed them using confocal microscopy. We found that the oligomeric Aβ staining in the soma was very punctuate, indicating that these structures are located in an intracellular compartment (Fig. 3A). A similar staining pattern was detected with the Aβ42-specific antibody (Fig. 3B). We found that only a proportion of deposits detected by the Aβ42-specific antibody were also immunoreactive for M71/3, as Aβ-specific antibodies recognize monomeric Aβ as well (Fig. 3C). Surprisingly, however, we found a proportion of M71/3-positive structures that were negative for Aβ specific antibodies (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that intraneuronal oligomers exist in different conformations, one where the C-terminal of Aβ is accessible, and one where it is not. It is possible that these different conformations represent different stages of Aβ aggregation, and further biochemical experiments will be necessary to better address these conformational changes. Co-localization of Aβ Oligomers with Early, Somatodendritic Tau but Not Late Hyperphosphorylated Tau—Recent evidence suggests that Aβ and tau pathology may influence each other. As part of our efforts to discern the nature of this interaction and to establish which form of Aβ may be involved, we first determined whether there was co-localization between Aβ oligomers and tau in vivo. Sections from 6- and 20-month-old 3xTg-AD mice were double-labeled with M71/3 and anti-tau antibodies. These ages were selected because tau accumulation in the somatodendritic compartment is the earliest sign of tau pathology in the 3xTg-AD mice, which is first apparent by 6 months of age. By 20 months, the tangle pathology is quite advanced and apparent with different silver stains and also immunoreactive with several phosphospecific tau antibodies (e.g. AT8, PHF-1) (25Oddo S. Caccamo A. Shepherd J.D. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Kayed R. Metherate R. Mattson M.P. Akbari Y. LaFerla F.M. Neuron. 2003; 39: 409-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3229) Google Scholar). Our analysis indicates that there is some but not complete co-localization between the M71/3 and HT7 immunoreactivity (Fig. 4, A–C). In contrast we found scant evidence of M71/3 and AT8 co-localization in 20-month-old mice (Fig. 4, D–F). These results indicate that Aβ oligomers co-localize with HT7-positive somatodendritic tau deposits. The co-localization of Aβ oligomers with early tau pathology may be fortuitous or given the growing appreciation that Aβ can induce the tau pathology, it is tempting to speculate that Aβ oligomers acting either intraneuronally or extraneuronally at the synaptic surface may contribute to the development of the tau pathology. Anti-oligomeric Aβ Antibody Clears Tau Pathology as Well as Aβ Pathology—We previously showed that a single injection of an anti-Aβ antibody clears Aβ deposits from the brains of the 3xTg-AD mice, which consequently leads to the reduction in early tau pathology (6Oddo S. Billings L. Kesslak J.P. Cribbs D.H. LaFerla F.M. Neuron. 2004; 43: 321-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). As it is plausible that only certain Aβ species may also result in clearance of tau, we determined the effects of an Aβ oligomeric-specific antibody on the clearance of the Aβ and tau pathology. We injected 2 μg of antibody A11 into the hippocampus of 12-month-old hemizygous 3xTg-AD mice. This antibody was used because it is highly selective for oligomeric Aβ, whereas M71/3 does not discriminate between oligomers and fibrils. We found that 7 days after a single administration of antibody A11, the Aβ pathology was reduced in the areas surroundings the injection site (Fig. 5, A–C). Remarkably, the removal of Aβ oligomers led to the clearance of the early tau pathology in the somatodendritic compartment of CA1 neurons (c.f. Fig. 5D–F). No clearance of Aβ or tau pathology was observed in the uninjected, contralateral hippocampus that served as an internal control (Fig. 5, A and D). We also injected 3xTg-AD mice with phosphate-buffered saline or an isotype control antibody and found that neither of these treatments had any effects on the Aβ and tau pathology (data not shown). These data strongly suggest that Aβ oligomers may be link between Aβ and tau pathology. Thus, besides impairing LTP (18Lambert M.P. Barlow A.K. Chromy B.A. Edwards C. Freed R. Liosatos M. Morgan T.E.

One of the earliest clinical manifestations that occurs in AD is a profound memory loss. Recently, it has been proposed that this initial memory loss may be caused by synaptic failure, which may be a consequence of the accumulation of soluble Aβ oligomers (35Klein W.L. Krafft G.A. Finch C.E. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 219-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 36Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 298: 789-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3438) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is further strengthened by the isolation of oligomers from AD brains (29Gong Y. Chang L. Viola K.L. Lacor P.N. Lambert M.P. Finch C.E. Krafft G.A. Klein W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10417-10422Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 32McLean C.A. Cherny R.A. Fraser F.W.

Aβ oligomers isolated from AD brains, human cerebrospinal fluid, or cell lines are resistant to common solvents such as SDS (28Walsh D.M. Tseng B.P. Rydel R.E. Podlisny M.B. Selkoe D.J.

In this study, we showed that the 3xTg-AD mice develop SDS-resistant oligomers in a progressive manner, suggesting that these structures are fairly stable. This is notable considering that recently it has been proposed that Aβ oligomers may not just be a transient stage to fibrils, but they maybe metastable structures that interfere with neuronal function (34Souillac P.O. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8094-8104Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). One of the major findings of this work was that Aβ oligomerization starts intraneuronally. These data are consistent with previous data showing that Aβ oligomerization also begins intracellularly in primary human neurons and in other neuronal cell lines and in transgenic mice (27Takahashi R.H. Almeida C.G. Kearney P.F. Yu F. Lin M.T. Milner T.A. Gouras G.K. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 3592-3599Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 28Walsh D.M. Tseng B.P. Rydel R.E. Podlisny M.B. Selkoe D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10831-10839Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that intraneuronal Aβ plays a pathophysiological role in the progression of the disease (reviewed in Ref. 12Tseng B.P. Kitazawa M. LaFerla F.M. Curr. Alzheimer Res. 2004; 1: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In particular, we previously showed that the 3xTg-AD mice have a selective loss of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7nAChRs) restricted to brain regions that accumulate intraneuronal Aβ (38Oddo S. Caccamo A. Green K.N. Liang K. Tran L. Chen Y. Leslie F.M. LaFerla F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3046-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Moreover, we showed that 6-month-old 3xTg-AD mice have profound LTP and cognitive deficits caused by intraneuronal Aβ (25Oddo S. Caccamo A. Shepherd J.D. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Kayed R. Metherate R.

Neuron. 2005; 45: 675-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data strongly argue that intraneuronal Aβ oligomers may be responsible for the loss of α7nAChRs and the LTP and cognitive deficits in the 3xTg-AD mice. On the other hand, there is also evidence that Aβ oligomers can act as extracellular ligands for synapses (29Gong Y. Chang L. Viola K.L. Lacor P.N. Lambert M.P. Finch C.E. Krafft G.A. Klein W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10417-10422Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 40Lacor P.N. Buniel M.C. Chang L. Fernandez S.J. Gong Y. Viola K.L. Lambert M.P. Velasco P.T. Bigio E.H. Finch C.E. Krafft G.A. Klein W.L. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10191-10200Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). These two views are not mutually exclusive. Considering the potency of Aβ oligomers, it is possible that these structures are bioactive within the cell, interfering with cell function, and also, once in the extracellular space (Fig. 2), they can act as a ligand and interfere with general neuronal networking. Moreover, we cannot exclude the possibility that some Aβ oligomers may also form extracellularly and further contribute to Aβ toxicity and fibril formation. Additional studies will be necessary to determine the extent of the contribution of Aβ oligomers to the loss of α7nAChRs and the LTP and cognitive impairments in the 3xTg-AD mice. Nevertheless, the data presented here, along with other studies showing that Aβ oligomers impair LTP and cognitive functions (18Lambert M.P. Barlow A.K. Chromy B.A. Edwards C. Freed R. Liosatos M.

We and others presented data to show that Aβ and tau pathologies interact in vivo (4Lewis J. Dickson D.W. Lin W.L. Chisholm L. Corral A. Jones G. Yen S.H. Sahara N. Skipper L. Yager D. Eckman C.

Neuron. 2004; 43: 321-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). In particular, we have shown that anti-Aβ antibodies clear both intracellular and extracellular Aβ deposits and lead to the subsequent clearance of the early tau pathology (6Oddo S. Billings L. Kesslak J.P. Cribbs D.H. LaFerla F.M. Neuron. 2004; 43: 321-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that a single intrahippocampal injection of the oligomeric-specific antibody A11 reduces intracellular Aβ deposits. In this regard, we have previously shown that intraneuronal Aβ deposits can also be removed by other anti-Aβ antibodies (6Oddo S. Billings L. Kesslak J.P. Cribbs D.H. LaFerla F.M. Neuron. 2004; 43: 321-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 39Billings L.M. Oddo S. Green K.N. McGaugh J.L. LaFerla F.M. Neuron. 2005; 45: 675-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying the removal of intraneuronal Aβ seems to be because of a dynamic relationship between intraneuronal and extracellular pools of Aβ (41Oddo S. Caccamo A. Smith I.F. Green K.N. LaFerla F.M. Am. J. Pathol. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, the injection of the anti-oligomeric Aβ antibody A11, leads to the reduction of tau pathology as well as Aβ pathology. These data strongly suggest that Aβ oligomers may represent a link between Aβ and tau pathology. It has recently been shown that Aβ immunotherapy neutralizes Aβ oligomers, thus rescuing the oligomer-induced LTP deficit (24Klyubin I. Walsh D.M. Lemere C.A. Cullen W.K. Shankar G.M. Betts V. Spooner E.T. Jiang L. Anwyl R. Selkoe D.J. Rowan M.J. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 556-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Walsh and colleagues (42Walsh D.M. Townsend M. Podlisny M.B. Shankar G.M. Fadeeva J.V. Agnaf O.E. Hartley D.M. Selkoe D.J. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2455-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) showed that the oligomer-induced LTP deficit can be rescued by small molecules that block Aβ oligomerization. In consideration of these data and the findings presented here, it is plausible to speculate that blocking Aβ oligomerization is a valid therapeutic target to lessen or halt AD neurodegeneration, as preventing Aβ oligomer formation can rescue the LTP and behavioral impairments and the early tau pathology. This last point is very important as tau pathology is sufficient to cause neurodegeneration in humans; therefore, for any AD therapeutic intervention to be suitable, it needs to remove/halt the progression of tau pathology as well as Aβ pathology."

We have previously shown that a natural soluble form of IL-15Rα chain corresponding to the entire extracellular domain of IL-15Rα behaves as a high affinity IL-15 antagonist. In sharp contrast with this finding, we demonstrate in this report that a recombinant, soluble sushi domain of IL-15Rα, which bears most of the binding affinity for IL-15, behaves as a potent IL-15 agonist by enhancing its binding and biological effects (proliferation and protection from apoptosis) through the IL-15Rβ/γ heterodimer, whereas it does not affect IL-15 binding and function of the tripartite IL-15Rα/β/γ membrane receptor.

Whereas IL-2 or IL-2Rα knock-out in mice was associated with autoimmune phenotypes with increased populations of activated T and B cells, IL-15 and IL-15Rα knock-out resulted in specific defects in NK, NK-T, intraepithelial lymphocytes, and memory CD8 T cells (7Kennedy M.K.

Med. 2001; 194: 1187-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Furthermore, IL-2 promotes peripheral tolerance by inducing activation-induced cell death, whereas IL-15 inhibits IL-2-mediated activation-induced cell death (9Marks-Konczalik J. Dubois S. Losi J.M. Sabzevari H. Yamada N. Feigenbaum L. Waldmann T.A. Tagaya Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11445-11450Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), and, unlike IL-2, IL-15 is a survival factor for CD8 memory T cells (10Ku C.C. Murakami M. Sakamoto A. Kappler J. Marrack P. Science. 2000; 288: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). In line with these observations, it has been suggested that the major role of IL-2 is to limit continuous expansion of activated T cells, whereas IL-15 is critical for initiation of T cell division and survival of memory T cells (11Li X.C. Demirci G. Ferrari-Lacraz S. Groves C. Coyle A. Malek T.R. Strom T.B. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). A novel mechanism of IL-15 action described recently is that of transpresentation in which IL-15 and IL-15Rα are coordinately expressed by antigen-presenting cells (monocytes and dendritic cells), and IL-15 bound to IL-15Rα is presented in trans to neighboring NK or CD8 T cells expressing only the IL-15Rβ/γ receptor (12Dubois S. Mariner J. Waldmann T.A. Tagaya Y. Immunity. 2002; 17: 537-547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). As a co-stimulatory event occurring at the immunological synapse, IL-15 transpresentation now appears to be a dominant mechanism for IL-15 action in vivo (13Burkett P.R. Koka R. Chien M. Chai S.

Aguila H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5616-5621Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and appears to play a major role in tumor immunosurveillance (15Kobayashi H. Dubois S. Sato N. Sabzevari H. Sakai Y. Waldmann T.A. Tagaya Y. Blood. 2005; 105: 721-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The IL-15Rα and IL-2Rα subunits form a sub-family of cytokine receptors in that they comprise extracellular parts, so called “sushi” structural domains (one in IL-15Rα and two in IL-2Rα), at their N terminus, which are also found in complement or adhesion molecules (16Norman D.G. Barlow P.N. Baron M. Day A.J. Sim R.B. Campbell I.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In both cases, these sushi domains have been shown to bear most of the structural elements responsible for cytokine binding. Whereas IL-2Rα alone is a low affinity receptor for IL-2 (Kd = 10 nm), IL-15Rα binds IL-15 with high affinity (Kd = 100 pm). Shedding of IL-2Rα by proteolysis is a natural mechanism that participates in the down-regulation of lymphocyte activation. IL-2Rα is cleaved by Der p1, a major mite allergen, thereby inhibiting Th1 cells and favoring an allergic environment (17Schulz O. Sewell H.F. Shakib F. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). IL-2Rα cleavage by tumor-derived metalloproteinases also results in the suppression of the proliferation of cancer-encountered T cells (18Sheu B.C. Hsu S.M. Ho H.N. Lien H.C. Huang S.C. Lin R.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 237-242PubMed Google Scholar). The soluble IL-2Rα thus generated is a competitive inhibitor of IL-2 action in vitro. However, it remains a low affinity IL-2 binder and is not likely to efficiently participate in down-regulation of IL-2 activity in vivo. We have recently shown that a soluble form of the human IL-15Rα can also be naturally released from IL-15Rα-positive cells by a shedding process involving matrix metalloproteinases (19Mortier E. Bernard J. Plet A. Jacques Y. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 1681-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In contrast to soluble IL-2Rα, this soluble IL-15Rα receptor was able to bind IL-15 with high affinity and efficiently blocked proliferation driven through the high affinity IL-15Rα/β/γ signaling complex. This result was consistent with the concept of sIL-15Rα behaving, like its homolog sIL-2Rα, as an antagonist, and with the inhibitory effects of mouse sIL-15Rα in vitro or in vivo (20Ruchatz H. Leung B.P. Wei X.Q. McInnes I.B. Liew F.Y. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5654-5660PubMed Google Scholar, 21Smith X.G. Bolton E.M. Ruchatz H. Wei X. Liew F.Y. Bradley J.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3444-3450Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Here, we show that a soluble receptor consisting of the N-terminal structural domain of IL-15Rα (sushi domain) has the opposite action; it is able to enhance the binding as well as the bioactivity of IL-15 through the IL-15Rβ/γ intermediate affinity receptor, without affecting binding and bioactivity through the high affinity receptor. In addition, we describe fusion proteins consisting of human IL-15 and human IL-15Rα fused by flexible linkers that behave as potent superagonists of the IL-15Rβ/γ complex. Cell Culture and Cytokines—Recombinant human IL-15 (rIL-15) was purchased from Peprotech Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). The Mo-7e myeloid leukemia (22Meazza R. Basso S. Gaggero A. Detotero D. Trentin L.

TF1-β cells (23Farner N.L. Gan J. de Jong J.L. Leary T.P. Fenske T.S. Buckley P. Dunlap S. Sondel P.M. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 316-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) were cultured in the same medium supplemented with 250 μg/ml Geneticin. The Kit 225 human T lymphoma cell line (24Hori T. Uchiyama T. Tsudo M. Umadome H. Ohno H. Fukuhara S. Kita K. Uchino H. Blood. 1987; 70: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (obtained from Dr. Doreen Cantrell, University of Dundee, UK) was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 6% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 10 ng/ml rIL-2 (Chiron, Emeryville, CA). 32Dβ cells (25Nakamura Y.

Nature. 1994; 369: 330-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. Warren Leonard, Bethesda, MD) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 0.4 ng/ml mIL-3 (R&D Systems), 10 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 250 μg/ml Geneticin. sIL-15Rα·IL-2, sIL-15Rα-sushi·IL-2, and sIL-15Rα-sushi—sIL-15Rα·IL-2 was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and prepared as described (26Bernard J. Harb C. Mortier E. Quemener A. Meloen R.H. Vermot-Desroches C. Wijdeness J. van Dijken P. Grotzinger J. Slootstra J.W. Plet A. Jacques Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24313-24322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A similar construction was made in which the sushi domain of IL-15Rα (amino acids 1-66 of mature coding sequence) was linked to a molecule of human IL-2 (sIL-15Rα-sushi·IL-2). The sushi domain of IL-15Rα was amplified by PCR. PCR products were purified, digested with BamHI and HindIII (Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania) and ligated into a pQE30 expression vector. Expression was performed in Escherichia coli SG13009 cells under isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction. After cell lysis, inclusions bodies were washed, solubilized in 6 mm guanidine HCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 20 mm imidazole, 150 mm sodium chloride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The IL-15Rα-sushi was trapped in an nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen) equilibrated with the solubilization buffer plus 1 mm reduced glutathione and 0.2 mm oxidized glutathione. It was then refolded via a gradient from 6 to 0 m guanidine HCl in the column buffer (27Matsumoto M. Misawa S. Tsumoto K. Kumagai I. Hayashi H. Kobayashi Y. Protein Expr. Purif. 2003; 31: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and eluted with 250 mm imidazole. RLI and ILR Fusion Proteins—The constructions of the fusion proteins are shown in Fig. 2E. The human IL-15Rα-sushi domain (amino acids 1-77) and human IL-15 were separated by linker 20 (SGGSGGGGSGGGSGGGGSLQ) for RLI or by linker 26 (SGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGSLQ) for ILR. A sequence coding for the FLAG epitope and Factor Xa binding site (DYKDDDDKIEGR) was added between the signal peptide and the coding sequences. The endogenous signal peptide of human IL-15Rα was used for RLI and the signal peptide of bovine preprolactin for ILR. These constructions were inserted between the BamHI and the Hind III sites of a pFastBac 1 (Invitrogen) expression vector thus generating two expression vectors, which were recombined in baculovirus DNA using the Bac to Bac expression system (Invitrogen). The recombinant baculoviruses were used to infect SF9 cells, and fusion proteins were expressed in the SF 900 II medium and harvested 4 days post infection. The concentrations of the fusion proteins were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with the anti-IL-15 monoclonal antibody 247 (R & D Systems) as the capture antibody and the anti-FLAG M2-peroxydase conjugate (Sigma) as the revealing antibody. Surface Plasmon Resonance Studies—The SPR experiments were performed with a BIAcore 2000 biosensor (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden). rIL-15 was covalently linked to CM5 sensor chips, and the binding of increasing concentrations of sIL-15Rα·IL-2, sIL-15Rα-sushi·IL-2, or sIL-15Rα-sushi was monitored. Analysis of sensorgrams was performed using BIAlogue kinetics evaluation software. Proliferation Assays—The proliferative responses of Mo-7e, TF-1β, and Kit 225 cells to rIL-15, rIL-2, RLI, or ILR were measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation as described (19Mortier E. Bernard J. Plet A. Jacques Y. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 1681-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) after 4 h in cytokine-deprived medium, 48 h culture, and 16 h with [3H]thymidine. Apoptosis—The annexin V assay was performed using a FACScan flow-cytometer and the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis detection kit (BD Biosciences). After cytokine starvation, cells were seeded in multiwell plates at 5 × 105 cells/well in 1 ml and cultured in medium supplemented with the various reactants (rIL-15, sIL-15Rα-sushi, and RLI fusion protein). Data were acquired and analyzed using CellQuest software. Binding Assays and Internalization—Labeling with [125I]iodine of human rIL-15, sIL-15Rα-sushi, and RLI fusion protein, as well as subsequent binding experiments, were performed as described previously (19Mortier E. Bernard J. Plet A. Jacques Y. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 1681-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For internalization, cells were equilibrated at 4 °C with labeled sIL-15Rα-sushi or RLI, and the temperature was switched to 37 °C. At different time intervals, two samples were washed and centrifuged. One of the cell pellets was treated with glycine-HCl buffer (0.2 m, pH 2.5), whereas the other was treated with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) at 4 °C for 5 min. After centrifugation, total ligand binding was determined from the pellet of the cells treated with PBS, whereas the membrane-bound and internalized fractions were determined, respectively, from the supernatant and pellet of cells treated with acid pH. IL-15Rα Binding to IL-15 Is Mainly Due to the Sushi Domain—In a previous study (28Dubois S. Magrangeas F. Lehours P. Raher S. Bernard J. Boisteau O. Leroy S. Minvielle S. Godard A. Jacques Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26978-26984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we have shown that removal of the sushi domain encoded by exon 2 of IL-15Rα resulted in a complete abrogation of IL-15 binding to membrane anchored IL-15Rα, suggesting that the sushi domain was indispensable for binding. To directly measure the contribution of the sushi domain to IL-15 binding, soluble forms of IL-15Rα containing the entire extracellular domain or only the N-terminal sushi domain were prepared and assayed for IL-15 binding in a competition assay and using SPR technology. As shown in Fig. 1A, a sIL-15Rα·IL-2 fusion protein produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells and consisting of the entire IL-15Rα extracellular domain linked to a molecule of human IL-2 (used as a tag for purification) bound IL-15 with high affinity (kon = 3.7 × 105 m-1 s-1; koff = 1.4 × 10-5 s-1; Kd = 38 pm). A similar construction linking the sushi domain of IL-15Rα to human IL-2 also bound IL-15 (Fig. 1B) but with a 10-fold lower affinity, mainly due to a more rapid off rate (kon = 3.1 × 105 m-1 s-1; koff = 1.3 × 10-4 s-1; Kd = 420 pm). A soluble sushi domain was also produced in E. coli. This sIL-15Rα-sushi also bound IL-15 with a lower affinity (kon = 2.5 × 105 m-1 s-1; koff = 3.8 × 10-4 s-1; Kd = 1.5 nm) (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that the sushi domain is responsible for most of the binding affinity of IL-15 but that it does not fully reconstitute the high affinity binding displayed by the full-length extracellular domain. Soluble IL-15Rα Proteins Inhibit IL-15 Binding to Membrane-anchored IL-15Rα—The three soluble forms of IL-15Rα were tested for their ability to compete with radioiodinated IL-15 for binding to IL-15Rα expressed by the human cell line TF-1 that also expresses the IL-15Rγ chain but not the IL-15Rβ chain (Fig. 1D). The three proteins completely inhibited IL-15 binding to TF-1 cells with IC50 values that were similar to the Kd values measured by the SPR technology: 100 pm (sIL-15Rα·IL-2), 270 pm (sIL-15Rα-sushi·IL-2), and 1.3 nm (sIL-15Rα-sushi). sIL-15Rα-sushi Increases IL-15-driven Cell Proliferation through the IL-15Rβ/γ Complex—Because the soluble sushi domain was easily produced in E. coli in high yields, it was selected for all further studies. It was first tested on cell lines that only express the IL-15Rβ/γ complex (the human Mo-7e cell line and the mouse 32Dβ cell line that expresses endogenous mouse IL-15Rγ chain and transfected human IL-15Rβ chain). As expected, the Mo-7e cell line proliferated in response to nanomolar concentrations of rIL-15 or rIL-2 (Fig. 2, A and B). Unexpectedly, addition of a fixed concentration of sIL-15Rα-sushi (10 nm)to the assay increased the proliferative response to lower concentrations of rIL-15 by ∼4-fold. By itself, sIL-15Rα-sushi did not induce any proliferative response (data not shown). Similar results were obtained for 32Dβ with a shift of ∼10-fold (data not shown). The specificity was assessed by the fact that sIL-15Rα-sushi did not affect the rIL-2-driven proliferation of Mo-7e cells (Fig. 2B). Fig. 2C shows that sIL-15Rα-sushi dose dependently (with an IC50 of 3.5 nm, similar to its Kd for IL-15) potentiated the effect of a fixed concentration of rIL-15 (1 nm) that alone induces only a low level of proliferation. RLI and ILR Fusion Proteins Are Potent Inducers of Cell Proliferation through the IL-15Rβ/γ Complex—To evaluate whether the synergistic effect of sushi on IL-15 bioactivity could be transferred by a single molecule, molecular constructs encoding fusion proteins linking IL-15 and the sushi domain were elaborated. For the two constructions, a flexible linker was introduced between the C terminus of IL-15 and the N terminus of the sushi domain (ILR) or vice versa (RLI) (Fig. 2E). Molecular models illustrating the structures of these proteins are shown in Fig. 2F. These two fusion proteins were tested for their effect on the proliferation of Mo-7e cells. As shown in Fig. 2D, both proteins induced dose-dependent induction of Mo-7e cell proliferation, with EC50s that were similar (∼25 pm) and far lower than those of rIL-15 alone (3 nm), or of an equimolar mixture of rIL-15 plus sIL-15Rα-sushi (0.9 nm). These results further confirm the synergistic effect of sIL-15Rα-sushi on the actions of IL-15 and indicate that stabilizing the IL-15·sIL-15Rα-sushi complex with a covalent linker markedly enhances this synergistic action. sIL-15Rα-sushi Increases IL-15-induced Prevention of Apoptosis, and RLI Efficiently Prevents Cellular Apoptosis—Following cytokine withdrawal, the fraction of apoptotic Mo-7e cells increased from 10 to 80% in 48 h (Fig. 3, A (panel a) and A (panel b)). When added at time zero, rIL-15 (5 nm) reduced this apoptosis to 70% (Fig. 3A, panel c). Alone, sIL-15Rα-sushi (10 nm) had no effect (Fig. 3A, panel b). However, it markedly potentiated the anti-apoptotic effect of rIL-15 (35% apoptosis at 48 h, Fig. 3A, panel c). The synergistic effect of sIL-15Rα-sushi on IL-15-mediated prevention of apoptosis was confirmed by a kinetic analysis (Fig. 3B) as well as by dose-response curves (Fig. 3C). rIL-15 acted with an IC50 of ∼1.5 nm, a value in agreement with the saturation of IL-15β/γ receptors. This IC50 was ∼10-fold lower (170 pm) in the presence of 10 nm sIL-15Rα-sushi. The RLI fusion protein markedly prevented apoptosis (Fig. 3B). On a molar basis, it was even more active than the IL-15·sIL-15Rα-sushi association, with an IC50 of ∼40 pm (Fig. 3C). sIL-15Rα-sushi Increases IL-15 Binding to Mo-7e Cells, and the RLI Fusion Protein Binds to and Is Internalized by Mo-7e Cells—As expected, Mo-7e cells bound IL-15 with intermediate affinity (Kd = 13.5 nm), with a maximal binding capacity of 800 sites/cell (Fig. 4A). The addition of sIL-15Rα-sushi (10 nm) increased the affinity of IL-15 binding (Kd = 7 nm) without significantly affecting the maximal binding capacity (1180 sites/cell). When using a radioiodinated RLI fusion protein (Fig. 4B), we detected binding to a similar number of receptor sites (730 sites/cell), and the affinity of binding (Kd = 780 pm) was markedly higher than that of IL-15. Fig. 4C shows that RLI can be efficiently and rapidly internalized. The fraction of cell-bound radioactivity decreased within ∼20 min and was accompanied by a concomitant increase in intracellular radioactivity. sIL-15Rα-sushi Does Not Affect IL-15-driven Cell Proliferation nor Inhibition of Apoptosis through the High Affinity IL-15Rα/β/γ Complex—The human lymphoma cell line Kit 225 expresses endogenous IL-15Rα, -β, and -γ chains, and the human TF-1β cell line expresses endogenous IL-15Rα and -γ chains plus the transfected human IL-15Rβ chain. Consequently, these cell lines proliferate in response to low, picomolar concentrations of IL-15, as shown in Fig. 5 (A and B) (EC50 = 19 pm and 21 pm, respectively). In contrast to what was found using Mo-7e or 32Dβ cells, addition of equimolar concentrations of sIL-15Rα-sushi to IL-15 did not significantly affected the IL-15 dose-response curve on either cell type. The ILR fusion protein was as active as rIL-15 on the two cell lines. The RLI was also as active as rIL-15 on Kit 225 cells but was ∼16-fold more efficient (EC50 = 1.2 pm) than rIL-15 on TF-1β cells. The effects of sIL-15Rα-sushi and RLI were further analyzed on TF-1β cell apoptosis induced by cytokine deprivation. Histograms showing these effects are given in Fig. 5C, whereas the kinetics and dose responses of these effects are shown in Fig. 5, D and E, respectively. rIL-15 dose and time dependently inhibited TF-1β apoptosis. sIL-15Rα-sushi alone had no effect and did not change the effect of IL-15 IC50 = 6.5 pm for rIL-15 or sIL-15Rα-sushi plus rIL-15. The ILR fusion protein was as active as rIL-15, whereas RLI was about three times more active (IC50 = 2.5 pm). IL-15, sIL-15Rα-sushi, and RLI Binding to TF-1β Cells—Insofar as IL-15Rα-sushi did not affect IL-15 proliferation of TF-1β, we examined its effect on IL-15 binding over a wide concentration range (Fig. 6A). Scatchard analysis of the saturation binding curve indicated the presence of two classes of IL-15 binding sites, compatible with the presence of a small number of high affinity binding sites (IL-15Rα/β/γ complexes, Kd = 22 pm, Bmax = 100 sites/cell) plus higher amounts of intermediate affinity binding sites (IL-15Rβ/γ complexes, Kd = 30 nm, 2800 sites/cell). sIL-15Rα-sushi induced an increase in IL-15 binding that, according to Scatchard analysis, was mainly due to an increase in the affinity of IL-15 binding for the intermediate-affinity component (Kd = 3.5 nm). To more specifically test the effect of sIL-15Rα on the high affinity component, its effect was analyzed on the binding of a low concentration of radiolabeled IL-15 (200 pm) that mainly targets the high affinity receptor. As shown in Fig. 6B, sIL-15Rα-sushi, at concentrations of up to 25 nm, did not affect this binding. The binding of radiolabeled sIL-15Rα-sushi to TF-1β cells (Fig. 6C) revealed a specific binding component that was strictly dependent on the presence of rIL-15. In the presence of 1 nm rIL-15, the Kd reflecting sIL-15Rα-sushi binding was 3.5 nm, a value compatible with its affinity for IL-15, with a maximal binding capacity (3300 sites/cell) compatible with the number of IL-15 intermediate binding sites. As further shown in Fig. 6D, the radiolabeled sIL-15Rα-sushi was efficiently internalized. Radiolabeled RLI fusion protein also bound to TF-1β cells (Fig. 6E). A single specific binding component was observed with a Kd of 250 pm and a maximal capacity (4000 sites/cell) again comparable to the number of IL-15 intermediate affinity binding sites. Once bound, the RLI was also efficiently internalized (Fig. 6F). Deletion of the exon 2-encoded sushi domain of human IL-15Rα was formerly shown to completely abrogate IL-15 binding, indicating the dispensable role of the sushi domain in cytokine recognition (28Dubois S. Magrangeas F. Lehours P. Raher S. Bernard J. Boisteau O. Leroy S. Minvielle S. Godard A. Jacques Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26978-26984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Conversely, we show in this study that removal of the C-terminal tail (exons 3-5) of the extracellular part of IL-15Rα (in the context of the sIL-15Rα·IL-2 fusion protein) results in a 10-fold decrease in its binding affinity for IL-15, as seen by SPR, and a 3.5-fold decrease in its affinity as seen in a competition assay. In terms of thermodynamics, the 10-fold decrease in affinity was calculated to correspond to a 10% loss of the free energy of interaction of IL-15 with IL-15Rα. Thus, the N-terminal structural domain encoded by exon 2 (sushi domain) bears most (90%) but not all of the IL-15 binding capacity. Recent data from our laboratory 4E. Mortier, unpublished results. indicate that the domain encoded by exon 3 also contributes to IL-15 binding. The sIL-15Rα-sushi produced in E. coli had an affinity that was 3- to 4-fold lower than that of sIL-15Rα-sushi·IL-2 produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells. This difference cannot be explained by differences in the glycosylation status of the two proteins, inasmuch as the sushi domain does not contain any potential sites for N-or O-linked glycosylations (2Giri J.G.

https://openalex.org/W1978853470,"Dansgaard–Oeschger events are rapid climate fluctuations that occurred during and at the end of the last ice age with remarkable regularity: there were 23 such events between 110,000 and 23,000 years bp, with a periodicity of 1,470 years. Identify the source of this cycle, and it should be possible to say what triggered these events. The Sun had been excluded as a possible cause because of the lack of a 1,470-year spectral contribution in records of solar variability. Despite this, Braun et al. present a new hypothesis that convincingly explains the 1,470-year period as the net result of two well known solar cycles, the DeVries and Gleissberg cycles, with periods of 210 years and 87 years. Many palaeoclimate records from the North Atlantic region show a pattern of rapid climate oscillations, the so-called Dansgaard–Oeschger events, with a quasi-periodicity of ∼1,470 years for the late glacial period1,2,3,4,5,6. Various hypotheses have been suggested to explain these rapid temperature shifts, including internal oscillations in the climate system and external forcing, possibly from the Sun7. But whereas pronounced solar cycles of ∼87 and ∼210 years are well known8,9,10,11,12, a ∼1,470-year solar cycle has not been detected8. Here we show that an intermediate-complexity climate model with glacial climate conditions simulates rapid climate shifts similar to the Dansgaard–Oeschger events with a spacing of 1,470 years when forced by periodic freshwater input into the North Atlantic Ocean in cycles of ∼87 and ∼210 years. We attribute the robust 1,470-year response time to the superposition of the two shorter cycles, together with strongly nonlinear dynamics and the long characteristic timescale of the thermohaline circulation. For Holocene conditions, similar events do not occur. We conclude that the glacial 1,470-year climate cycles could have been triggered by solar forcing despite the absence of a 1,470-year solar cycle."

In this study, we have shown that the forkhead transcription factor Foxo1/FKHR plays a role as a mediator between the JNK pathway and PDX-1. Under oxidative stress conditions, Foxo1 changed its intracellular localization from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in the pancreatic β-cell line HIT-T15. The overexpression of JNK also induced the nuclear localization of Foxo1, but in contrast, suppression of JNK reduced the oxidative stress-induced nuclear localization of Foxo1, suggesting the involvement of the JNK pathway in Foxo1 translocation. In addition, oxidative stress or activation of the JNK pathway decreased the activity of Akt in HIT cells, leading to the decreased phosphorylation of Foxo1 following nuclear localization. Furthermore, adenovirus-mediated Foxo1 overexpression reduced the nuclear expression of PDX-1, whereas repression of Foxo1 by Foxo1-specific small interfering RNA retained the nuclear expression of PDX-1 under oxidative stress conditions. Taken together, Foxo1 is involved in the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of PDX-1 by oxidative stress and the JNK pathway.

Diabetes mellitus is the most prevalent metabolic disorder all over the world. Impaired insulin secretion and whole body insulin resistance play major roles in the development and progression of diabetes. In particular, pancreatic β-cell function, such as insulin biosynthesis and secretion, is often impaired under the chronic hyperglycemic conditions found in diabetes (1Poitout V. Robertson R.P.

Extracellular hyperglycemia readily causes intracellular hyperglycemia in β-cells, leading to the induction of reactive oxygen species in pancreatic islets of diabetic animals as best represented by the enhanced expression of oxidative stress markers such as 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine and 4-hydroxy-2,3-nonenal (7Ihara Y.

In addition, because pancreatic islet cells express a relatively low amount of anti-oxidative enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidase and catalase (11Tiedge M. Lortz S. Drinkgern J. Lenzen S.

As an underlying molecular mechanism of oxidative stress-mediated β-cell deterioration, we have reported (15Kaneto H. Xu G. Fujii N. Kim S. Bonner-Weir S. Weir G.C. J. Biol.

In addition, we have shown (17Nakatani Y. Kaneto H. Kawamori D. Hatazaki M. Miyatsuka T. Matsuoka T.A. Kajimoto Y. Matsuhisa M. Yamasaki Y. Hori M. J. Biol.

PDX-1, also known as IPF-1, IDX-1, and STF-1, is a homeodomain-containing transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in pancreatic development, β-cell differentiation (19Edlund H.

As support for the implication of PDX-1 in β-cell dysfunction, the reduction of insulin gene expression in β-cells chronically exposed to high glucose conditions either in vivo or in vitro is often accompanied by a decrease of PDX-1 expression in nuclei (4Tanaka Y.

Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Regulation of the intracellular localization of transcription factors is a crucial requirement for their action, and stimulus-dependent nuclear import can serve as a mechanism to regulate gene expression (26Yoneda Y. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 27Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). PDX-1 is reported to have a functional nuclear localization signal (28Moede T. Leibiger B. Pour H.G. Berggren P. Leibiger I.B.

Conversely, we have shown that PDX-1 also possesses a nuclear export signal and showed its nuclear export in a JNK-dependent manner (16Kawamori D. Kajimoto Y. Kaneto H. Umayahara Y. Fujitani Y. Miyatsuka T. Watada H. Leibiger I.B. Yamasaki Y. Hori M. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2896-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism as to how the JNK pathway induces the nuclear export of PDX-1 is still unknown. The forkhead transcription factor Foxo1 (previously known as FKHR) is a mammalian homologue of DAF-16 and is known as one of the important fundamental transcription factors playing a key role in apoptosis, cellular proliferation, differentiation and glucose metabolism through regulating the transcription of various target genes (33Ogg S. Paradis S. Gottlieb S. Patterson G.I. Lee L. Tissenbaum H.A. Ruvkun G. Nature. 1997; 389: 994-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1551) Google Scholar, 34Accili D. Arden K.C. Cell. 2004; 117: 421-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). It is reported that Foxo1 regulates hepatic gluconeogenesis and thus contributes to insulin resistance (35Nakae J. Biggs III, W.H. Kitamura T. Cavenee W.K. Wright C.V. Arden K.C. Accili D. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Insulin inhibits the function of Foxo1 through Akt/PKB-mediated phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion (36Biggs III, W.H.

Foxo1 was recently reported to inhibit PDX-1 gene transcription in pancreatic β-cells (35Nakae J. Biggs III, W.H. Kitamura T. Cavenee W.K. Wright C.V. Arden K.C. Accili D. Nat.

Investig. 2002; 110: 1839-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), suggesting that it is involved in the deterioration of β-cell function. Moreover, because Foxo1 exhibits a counterlocalization to PDX-1 in β-cells (37Kitamura T. Nakae J. Kitamura Y. Kido Y. Biggs III, W.H. Wright C.V. White M.F. Arden K.C. Accili D. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1839-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), Foxo1 translocation might modulate the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of PDX-1 by oxidative stress. Here, we have investigated the missing link between the JNK pathway and PDX-1 function in β-cells, and found that oxidative stress induces the nuclear translocation of Foxo1 through activation of the JNK pathway, which leads to the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of PDX-1. Our findings suggest the involvement of the JNK-Akt-Foxo1-PDX-1 axis in the impairment of PDX-1 function, and this pathway may explain part of the molecular mechanisms of β-cell dysfunction found in diabetes. Materials—Restriction enzymes, DNA polymerases, antibodies, and other modification enzymes were purchased from commercial suppliers (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA; Toyobo, Tokyo, Japan; Sigma; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; and Zymed Laboratories, San Francisco, CA). PCR primers and oligonucleotides were purchased from Invitrogen Japan (Tokyo, Japan). Tissue culture media were purchased from Sigma and fetal calf serum from Invitrogen Japan. Cell Culture—HIT-T15 cells (American Type Culture Collection number 1777) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 11.1 mm glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. The HIT-T15 cells used in this study were between passages 80 and 100. Immunocytochemistry—For immunostaining of cultured cells, the cells were seeded on a Lab-Tek chamber slide (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) and cultured for 2 days in appropriate medium. After rinsing with phosphate-buffered saline three times, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. For detection of Foxo1 and PDX-1, the cells were microwaved in citrate buffer for antigen retrieval before being incubated with blocking serum. Each slide was treated with a H2O2 solution to inactivate endogenous peroxidase. Detection of Foxo1 and PDX-1 was performed by the avidin-biotin complex method using the Vectastain Elite avidin-biotin complex kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). After blocking, the cells were incubated for 60 min with an anti-Foxo1 rabbit IgG antibody diluted at a ratio of 1:100 (Cell Signaling Technology) or an anti-PDX-1 antibody diluted at 1:1000 (38Watada H. Kajimoto Y. Umayahara Y. Matsuoka T. Kaneto H. Fujitani Y. Kamada T. Kawamori R. Yamasaki Y. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1478-1488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin. The cells were subsequently incubated for 30 min with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories) at a dilution of 1:200. The sections were then incubated with avidin-biotin complex reagent for 30 min, and positive reactions were visualized by incubation with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride substrate (Zymed Laboratories). Isolation of Nuclear, Cytoplasmic, and Whole Cell Extracts and Western Blot Analyses—HIT-T15 cells were cultured in 60-mm diameter culture dishes until ∼80% confluency. For isolation of nuclear extracts, the cells were then collected into microtubes, centrifuged for 20 s in a microcentrifuge, and resuspended in 200 μl of 10.0 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, containing 10.0 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. After incubation at 4 °C for 15 min, the cells were lysed by passing 10 times through a 22-gauge needle. Next, the cells were centrifuged for 20 s in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction) was removed and frozen in small aliquots. The pellet, which contained the nuclei, was resuspended in 150 μl of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, containing 20% v/v glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and then stirred at 4 °C for 30 min. The nuclear extracts were then centrifuged for 20 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant was collected, aliquoted into small volumes, and stored at -80 °C. For isolation of whole cell extracts, the cells were collected into microtubes, centrifuged for 1 min in a microcentrifuge, and resuspended in 150 μl of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, containing 20% v/v glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and then stirred at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation for 20 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge, the supernatant was collected as whole cell extracts, aliquoted into small volumes, and stored at -80 °C. Western blot analyses were performed following standard procedures as described below. Nuclear, cytoplasmic, or whole cell proteins derived from each cell sample were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Optitran BA-S85, Schleicher & Schuell), and incubated overnight at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline containing a 1:1000 dilution of either rabbit anti-Foxo1, anti-Ser256-phosphospecific Foxo1, anti-Thr24-phosphospecific Foxo1, anti-Akt, anti-Ser473-phosphospecific Akt, anti-JNK antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), or anti-USF-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), a 1:5000 dilution of rabbit anti-PDX-1 antibody (38Watada H.

Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1478-1488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or a 1:1000 dilution of goat anti-β-actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The membrane was then incubated at room temperature for 60 min in phosphate-buffered saline with a 1:2000 dilution of anti-rabbit IgG or anti-goat IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Zymed Laboratories), and then for 2 min with chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The antigen-antibody complex was detected by exposure to a light-sensitive film for the appropriate exposure time. Relative protein amounts were estimated by densitometry after scanning using a Fluorchem IS-8000 image analyzer system (Alpha Innotech Corporation, San Leandro, CA). Preparation of Recombinant Adenoviruses—Recombinant adenoviruses expressing the wild type (WT) and dominant negative (DN) form of JNK, the WT and DN form of Foxo1, and Foxo1-specific siRNA were prepared using the AdEasy system (kindly provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein, the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center) (39He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). The generation of JNK WT- and DN-expressing adenoviruses was described previously (15Kaneto H. Xu G. Fujii N. Kim S. Bonner-Weir S. Weir G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30010-30018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids for the WT and DN forms (Δ256) of mouse Foxo1 were kind gifts from Dr. J. Nakae (Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan) (40Nakae J. Barr V. Accili D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In brief, the coding region of WT and Foxo1 DN (Δ256) was cloned into the SalI-EcoRV site of the shuttle vector pAdTrack-CMV, and annealed double strand-synthesized hair-pin siRNA template oligonucleotides, including 21-bp sequences for Foxo1-specific siRNA (5′-AAAAGTCCTTCAGATTGTCTG-3′) (41Hribal M.L. Nakae J. Kitamura T. Shutter J.R. Accili D. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) was also cloned into the MluI-HindIII site of the shuttle vector pRNAT-H1.1/Adeno (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ). To allow for homologous recombination, the linearized plasmid containing Foxo1 WT or Foxo1 DN or Foxo1-specific siRNA and the adenoviral backbone plasmid pAdEasy-1 were introduced into electrocompetent Escherichia coli BJ5183. The linearized plasmids were transfected into the adenovirus packaging cell line 293 using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), and the adenovirus titers were increased up to 1 × 108 plaque-forming units/ml in the 293 cells. Control adenovirus expressing green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP) was prepared in the same manner. Adenovirus titers were further increased up to 1 × 1010 plaque-forming units/ml using the Virakit for Adenovirus5 recombinant adenovirus purification kit (Virapur LLC, San Diego, CA). The HIT-T15 cells were infected with various adenoviruses at 3 × 108 plaque-forming units/ml. Subsequent experiments were conducted 48 h after the initial addition of the virus. The efficiencies of the adenovirus-mediated gene transfers were between 80 and 95%. Oxidative Stress Induces Nuclear Accumulation of Foxo1—To investigate the effect of oxidative stress on the expression and intracellular localization of Foxo1, we first examined the intracellular distribution of Foxo1 by immunostaining. In the pancreatic β-cell-derived cell line HIT-T15, Foxo1 changed its intracellular localization from the cytoplasm to the nucleus under oxidative stress conditions (Fig. 1A). Next, to quantify the change in intracellular distribution of Foxo1 by oxidative stress, we performed Western blot analyses using nuclear and cytoplasmic protein extracts isolated from the HIT cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, the amount of nuclear Foxo1 was increased by treatment with 50 μm H2O2, whereas the amount of cytoplasmic Foxo1 was decreased (Fig. 1B). In contrast to Foxo1, the nuclear expression of PDX-1 was decreased and its cytoplasmic distribution was increased by oxidative stress (Fig. 1C). Also in immunostaining, PDX-1 showed nucleocytoplasmic translocation under oxidative stress conditions (Fig. 1C). The equivalence of nuclear and cytoplasmic components was verified by the expression of USF-1 (42Read M.L. Clark A.R. Docherty K. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and β-actin, respectively (Fig. 1D). It is known that the intracellular distribution of Foxo1 is mainly determined by its phosphorylation status (36Biggs III, W.H. Meisenhelder J. Hunter T. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7421-7426Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). Foxo1 is retained in the cytoplasm upon phosphorylation by Akt at multiple sites (36Biggs III, W.H. Meisenhelder J. Hunter T. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7421-7426Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). Conversely, a decrease in phosphorylation of Foxo1 allows Foxo1 to remain in the nucleus. The phosphorylation of Foxo1 at Ser256, which was reported to be important in determining the intracellular localization of Foxo1 (36Biggs III, W.H. Meisenhelder J. Hunter T. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7421-7426Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar), was shown to be reduced under oxidative stress conditions (Fig. 1E). This is consistent with the observations of the nuclear accumulation of Foxo1 under oxidative stress conditions (Fig. 1B). These results thus indicate that oxidative stress induces the nuclear accumulation of Foxo1 via reducing its phosphorylation status of Foxo1. Oxidative Stress Reduces Insulin-induced Phosphorylation of Akt—Next, to explore the upstream mechanism of oxidative stress-induced nuclear accumulation of Foxo1, we investigated the insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt. Because Akt is primarily activated as a result of its phosphorylation at the Thr308 and Ser473 residues (43Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Frech M. Cron P. Cohen P. Lucocq J.M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31515-31524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of oxidative stress on the insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 in HIT cells. Treatment with 17 nm insulin induced phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 in a time-dependent manner in vehicle-treated control HIT cells. However, insulin-induced up-regulation of Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 was reduced by treatment with 50 μm H2O2 (Fig. 2A, upper panel). Following 15 min of insulin treatment, the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 was increased to 432 ± 45.0% of basal conditions (0 min). On the other hand, under oxidative stress conditions, the increase of Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 was reduced to 323 ± 32.1% of basal conditions. To confirm that equal amounts of protein were loaded among the samples, whole cell protein extracts were immunoblotted with an anti-Akt antibody (Fig. 2A, middle panel) and an anti-β-actin antibody (Fig. 2A, lower panel). The graphs depict the averages of data obtained from three individual experiments, and data are expressed as means ± S.D. (Fig. 2B). Thus, these results indicate that oxidative stress reduces the insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt, which leads to an alteration in the phosphorylation status of Foxo1 and its nuclear accumulation. The JNK Pathway Is Involved in the Nuclear Translocation of Foxo1—Two major mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, the JNK and p38 MAP kinase pathways, can be activated by a variety of extracellular stress signals, such as UV light, heat, and oxidative stress, and induce various cellular responses (12Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar, 13Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F85-F104PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that activation of the JNK pathway is involved in β-cell dysfunction by oxidative stress (15Kaneto H. Xu G. Fujii N. Kim S. Bonner-Weir S. Weir G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30010-30018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In addition, we have recently reported that the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of PDX-1 induced by oxidative stress is mediated by activation of the JNK pathway (16Kawamori D. Kajimoto Y. Kaneto H. Umayahara Y. Fujitani Y. Miyatsuka T. Watada H. Leibiger I.B. Yamasaki Y. Hori M. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2896-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Hence, we next investigated the possible implication of the JNK pathway in this oxidative stress-induced nuclear accumulation of Foxo1. When a dominant negative form of JNK (JNK DN) was expressed by the infection of a JNK DN-expressing adenovirus (Fig. 3A), the oxidative stress-induced nuclear accumulation of Foxo1 was greatly inhibited (Fig. 3B, upper panel). In contrast, no such effects were observed when a GFP-expressing adenovirus was infected (Fig. 3B, upper panel). Moreover, when a JNK WT was overexpressed by infection of a JNK WT-expressing adenovirus (Fig. 3A), Foxo1 showed nuclear accumulation even without oxidative stress (Fig. 3B, upper panel). As sh"

Recent studies have demonstrated that the apoptotic activity of Bim can be regulated through a post-translational mechanism whereby ERK phosphorylation serves as a signal for Bim ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. In this report, we investigated the signaling pathways leading to Bim phosphorylation in Ba/F3 cells, an interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent B-cell line. IL-3 stimulation induced phosphorylation of BimEL, one of the predominant isoforms of Bim expressed in cells, at multiple sites, as evidenced by the formation of at least three to four bands by Western blotting that were sensitive to phosphatase digestion. The appearance of multiple, phosphorylated species of BimEL correlated with Akt, and not ERK, activation. The PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, blocked IL-3-stimulated Akt activity and partially blocked BimEL phosphorylation. In vitro kinase assays showed that recombinant Akt could directly phosphorylate a GST-BimEL fusion protein and identified the Akt phosphorylation site in the BimEL domain as Ser87. Further, we demonstrated that cytokine stimulation promotes BimEL binding to 14-3-3 proteins. Finally, we show that mutation of Ser87 dramatically increases the apoptotic potency of BimEL. We propose that Ser87 of BimEL is an important regulatory site that is targeted by Akt to attenuate the pro-apoptotic function of BimEL, thereby promoting cell survival.

Following a pro-apoptotic stimulus, however, Bim localizes to the mitochondria, where it initiates the mitochondrial cell death pathway by either directly activating Bax-like proteins (7Marani M.

However, as opposed to negative regulation of Bim expression levels by these pro-survival cytokines, we have recently demonstrated that addition of a pro-apoptotic cytokine, TGFβ 3The abbreviations used are: TGFβtransforming growth factor βmTORmammalian target of rapamycinPI3Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinaseIL-3interleukin-3MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseMEKMAPK/ERK kinaseGsk-3βglycogen synthase kinase-3βHRPhorseradish peroxidaseIPimmunoprecipitationCMVcytomegalovirusGFPgreen fluorescent proteinCIPcalf alkaline phosphataseCMconditioned mediumJNKc-Jun NH2-terminal kinaseMAPKAPMAPK-activated protein kinaseRskribosomal S6 kinase. , results in the up-regulation of Bim expression levels in two different B-cell lines, WEHI 231 and Ba/F3 (22Wildey G.M.

We further demonstrated that stimulation of the pro-survival CD40 receptor is capable of inhibiting TGFβ-mediated Bim expression and cell death in WEHI 231 cells concomitant with its rescue of the cells from apoptosis. transforming growth factor β mammalian target of rapamycin phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase interleukin-3 mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase MAPK/ERK kinase glycogen synthase kinase-3β horseradish peroxidase immunoprecipitation cytomegalovirus green fluorescent protein calf alkaline phosphatase conditioned medium c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase MAPK-activated protein kinase ribosomal S6 kinase. Several cell signaling pathways have been implicated in the control of Bim expression levels. In Ba/F3 cells, selective activation of either the Ras/MAPK or the Ras/PI3K pathway by inducible Ras mutants suppresses the increase in Bim expression normally observed during IL-3 deprivation (16Shinjyo T. Kuribara R. Inukai T. Hosoi H. Kinoshita T. Miyajima A. Houghton P. Look A.T. Ozawa K. Inaba T. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 854-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The inhibition of Bim expression by Ras/PI3K activation could be blocked by either the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin or the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, but not by overexpression of a dominant negative form of Akt. Taken together, these results suggest that, although both Akt and mTOR are downstream effectors of PI3K activation, only mTOR regulates Bim expression levels. Other studies have also demonstrated an inhibitory effect of PI3K signaling on Bim expression. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 induces Bim expression in B cells (Ba/F3) (15Dijkers P.F. Medema R.H. Lammers J.J. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1201-1204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar) and T cells (CTLL2) (14Stahl M. Dijkers P.F. Kops G.J.P.L. Lens S.M.A Coffer P.J. Burgering B.M.T Medema R.H. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5024-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), concomitant with an increase in cell death. Thus, the biological effects of LY294002 were identical with those of cytokine withdrawal in these model systems. In these studies, however, it was proposed that an important downstream effect of LY294002 was to reduce the amount of Akt in its active, phosphorylated form. The link between reduced Akt activity and increased Bim expression levels was shown to be FOXO3 (previously termed FKHR-L1), a member of the forkhead family of transcriptional regulators that can directly elevate Bim expression levels and induce apoptosis in Ba/F3 and CTLL2 cells when overexpressed. FOXO3 is phosphorylated by Akt, leading to its cytoplasmic retention by 14-3-3 proteins and loss of target gene activation (23Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5488) Google Scholar). Thus, the up-regulation of Bim expression induced by cytokine withdrawal or LY294002 addition correlated with a loss of the active, phosphorylated form of Akt and an increase in the active, non-phosphorylated form of FOXO3. More recent studies have demonstrated that the apoptotic function of Bim is regulated by phosphorylation, followed by ubiquitination and degradation. Phosphorylated forms of BimEL and BimL were initially reported in Ba/F3 cells grown in the presence, but not the absence, of IL-3 (16Shinjyo T. Kuribara R. Inukai T. Hosoi H. Kinoshita T. Miyajima A. Houghton P. Look A.T. Ozawa K. Inaba T. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 854-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Subsequently, BimEL phosphorylation has been demonstrated in nerve growth factor-stimulated PC12 cells (21Biswas S.C. Greene L.A. J. Biol.

A specific role for ERK in Bim phosphorylation was established using in vitro kinase assays, where it was demonstrated that purified ERK could phosphorylate only BimEL, and not BimL or BimS (25Ley R.

Furthermore, multiple ubiquitinated forms of Bim protein could be demonstrated in the presence of proteasomal inhibitors (28Akiyama T. Bouillet P. Miyazaki T. Kadono Y. Chikuda H. Chung U. Fukuda A.

Thus, these studies outline an additional mechanism to control the apoptotic function of Bim via its phosphorylation by ERK and subsequent ubiquitination and degradation. In this report we investigate the IL-3-induced signaling pathways leading to Bim phosphorylation in Ba/F3 cells. IL-3 stimulation leads to the appearance of multiple phosphorylated isoforms of BimEL in Ba/F3 cells. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 blocks IL-3-stimulated Akt activity and, surprisingly, partially blocks BimEL phosphorylation. We further demonstrate that GST fusion proteins containing the protein domain unique to BimEL can be phosphorylated in vitro by Akt and identified the Akt phosphorylation site in the BimEL domain as Ser87. Akt activation by survival cytokines promotes BimEL phosphorylation and association with 14-3-3 proteins. Finally, we show that mutation of the Akt phosphorylation site at Ser87 dramatically increases the apoptotic potency of BimEL. Reagents—TGFβ was a generous gift from Genzyme Inc.

At the end of the experiment, the cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in the appropriate lysis buffer. Ba/F3 cells were kept at 4 °C during all the above procedures. Where indicated LY294002 (50 μm), wortmannin (100 nm), U0126 (10 μm), PD98059 (10 μm), SP600125 (10 μm), SB202190 (15 μm), or MG-132 (50 μm) were added to the culture medium 30–60 min before IL-3 stimulation and remained present during the IL-3 treatment. Human Hep3B and rat FAO hepatoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics/antimycotics. Where indicated, Hep3B cells were serum-starved for 48 h prior to the addition of insulin (10 μg/ml). MG-132 (50 μm) was added to the culture medium 60 min before insulin stimulation and remained present during the insulin treatment. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed by standard SDS-PAGE, as described previously (22Wildey G.M. Patil S. Howe P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18069-18077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Whole cell lysates were prepared in TNMG lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5.0 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol) containing protease inhibitors and 1 mm Na3V04. Lysates were sonicated and clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min in a Beckman tabletop microcentrifuge at maximum speed. Protein concentration of the extracts was determined using Bradford's reagent (Pierce). Typically, 50–150 μg of whole cell lysate was separated on 10 or 12% acrylamide minigels and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membrane was blocked for 1 h in wash buffer (Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk, followed by a 2-h incubation with primary antibody diluted in the same blocking buffer. For phospho-specific antibodies, the primary antibody incubation was carried out in Tris-buffered saline-casein solution. After extensive washing, the blot was incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h in blocking buffer, washed, and processed using the ECL+ Western blotting Detection System (Amersham Biosciences). Primary antibodies were employed at a 1:500 to 1:5,000 dilution, and secondary antibodies were used at a 1:5,000 to 1:10,000 dilution. Western blotting was performed at room temperature. Alkaline Phosphatase Digestion of Bim—Triplicate samples of cell lysates (150 μg) were individually digested with either a low (20 units) or high (50 units) dose of calf alkaline phosphatase for 1 h at 37 °C in buffer supplied by the manufacturer. For one set of digests, the calf alkaline phosphatase was heat-inactivated at 95 °C for 5 min prior to adding the cell lysate. For the third set of digests, the phosphatase inhibitor Na3V04 (5 mm) was added to the digestion buffer. As a control, a sample of the lysate was incubated with buffer alone for 1 h at 37 °C. GST-Bim Fusion Proteins—A GST-Bim fusion protein was produced that contained only the amino acid sequence unique to human BimEL (amino acids 42–101). A BimEL fragment was amplified by PCR using full-length human BimEL cloned into the pFLAG-CMV2 expression vector as a template (11Yamaguchi H. Wang H.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41604-41612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The top primer was 5′-GGATCCGGATCCGGTAATCCTGAAGGCAAT-3′, and the bottom primer was 5′-GAATTCGAATTCCTGTGTCAAAAGAGAAAT A-3′. The BimEL PCR fragment was digested with Bam H1 and Eco R1, purified and cloned into similarly digested pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences). The expression of GST-Bim fusion protein was induced for 4 h in BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen, Madison, WI) with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). When necessary, recombinant protein was eluted from the beads with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm reduced glutathione. The concentration of GST-BimEL fusion protein was estimated from Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels. Recombinant GST protein was produced in parallel with recombinant GST-BimEL protein for use in control experiments. A GST-BimEL fusion protein containing a 16-amino acid truncation in the BimEL C-terminal sequence (GST-Bim–16EL) was produced in a similar manner. The truncated BimEL fragment was amplified by PCR using the same top primer as described above and 5′-GAATTCGAATTCCTCTTCTCATAAAGATGAA-3′ as the bottom primer and ligated into pGEX-2T to obtain the truncated BimEL GST fusion protein. GST-BimEL fusion proteins containing single serine to alanine substitutions were produced using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's directions. The template for mutations was BimEL-ligated into pGEX-2T. The serine 87 to alanine substitution (GST-BimS87AEL) was made using the top primer 5′-CTTTATGAGAAGATCCGCCCTGCTGTCTCGATC-3′ and its complement in PCR reactions. The serine 94 to alanine substitution (GST-BimELS94A) was made using the top primer 5′-CTGCTGTCTCGATCCTCCGCCGGGTATTTCTCTTTTGACAC-3′ and its complement in PCR reactions. In Vitro Kinase Assays—In vitro kinase assays were performed using both purified enzymes and kinases immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates. Whole cell lysates for immunoprecipitation (IP) were prepared in IP lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors and 1 mm Na3V04. Lysates were sonicated and clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min in a Beckman tabletop microcentrifuge at maximum speed. Cell lysates (250 μg) were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with 2.5 μg of either rabbit anti-p-Akt antibody or anti-Akt antibody in 200 μl of IP lysis buffer containing Protein G-agarose (Amersham Biosciences). The immune complexes were collected by centrifugation, washed five times in IP lysis buffer, and resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 10 μm ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10mm MgCl2). Kinase reactions were initiated by adding 5 μg of substrate protein and 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 20 μl of kinase buffer. The model substrate proteins utilized in kinase assays were dephosphorylated bovine myelin basic protein (Upstate) for ERK, Gsk-3 fusion protein (Cell Signaling Technology) for Akt, cAMP-response element-binding protein fusion protein (Upstate) for RSK and GSM peptide (Upstate) for Gsk-3β. In addition, GST and GST-BimEL fusion proteins were used as substrates in kinase assays. The reactions were stopped after a 20-min incubation at 30 °C by adding SDS-PAGE loading buffer and heating to 95 °C for 2 min. The samples were run on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and analyzed by autoradiography. In those experiments using pure enzymes, equivalent units (0.0608 unit) of kinase activity was added to reaction mixtures in 30 μl of kinase buffer. Co-immunoprecipitation of Endogenous Bim and 14-3-3 Proteins—Whole cell lysates (500–1000 μg) were incubated for 4 h at 4 ° C with 2.5 μg of either rabbit anti-Bim antibody or normal rabbit IgG in 200 μlof IP lysis buffer containing Protein G-agarose. The immune complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed five times in IP lysis buffer. The presence of 14-3-3 proteins in the immune complexes was detected by Western blotting. Transient Transfection of FAO Cells—Full-length human BimEL was cut out of pFLAG-CMV2 by XhoI/EcoRI double digestion and ligated into pcDNA3.1/HisC (Invitrogen). Serine to alanine mutations at residues 69, 87, and 94 were obtained as described above for GST-BimEL fusion proteins. The top PCR primer to produce the S69A mutation was 5′-GCTGGCCCCACCTGCCGCCCCTGGCCCTTTTGC-3′, and the bottom primer was 5′-GCAAAAGGGCCAGGGGCGGCAGGTGGGGCCAGC-3′. Transient transfection of FAO cells was accomplished using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) under serum-free conditions following the manufacturer's instructions. After 5–6 h of transfection, the medium was replaced with complete medium. For reporter assays, 150,000 cells/well were seeded into 12-well plates and transfected with 200 ng of pRL-TK-Renilla luciferase and varying amounts of pcDNA-BimEL. GFP was used as a negative control and to ensure that all cells received equal amounts of DNA. Approximately 24 h after the start of transfection, the cells were lysed in 200 μl and a 20-μl aliquot was assayed for luciferase activity using Stop & Glo reagent (Promega). For Western blot and DNA ladder assays, 4 × 106 cells were seeded into 100-mm dishes and transfected with either 5 or 15 μg of pcDNA-BimEL or GFP. Cells were collected 24 h later for analyses. DNA ladder formation was assayed as described previously (22Wildey G.M. Patil S. Howe P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18069-18077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). BimEL Is Phosphorylated and Proteasomally Degraded in Ba/F3 Cells—Ba/F3 cells require IL-3 in the tissue culture medium to survive and proliferate, and withdrawal of IL-3 leads to increased Bim expression and DNA ladder formation, a hallmark of apoptosis (15Dijkers P.F.

Using a proteomic approach specifically targeted to the Arabidopsis chloroplast envelope, we have identified HMA1, which belongs to the metal-transporting P1B-type ATPases family. HMA1 is mainly expressed in green tissues, and we validated its chloroplast envelope localization. Yeast expression experiments demonstrated that HMA1 is involved in copper homeostasis and that deletion of its N-terminal His-domain partially affects the metal transport. Characterization of hma1 Arabidopsis mutants revealed a lower chloroplast copper content and a diminution of the total chloroplast superoxide dismutase activity. No effect was observed on the plastocyanin content in these lines. The hma1 insertional mutants grew like WT plants in standard condition but presented a photosensitivity phenotype under high light. Finally, direct biochemical ATPase assays performed on purified chloroplast envelope membranes showed that the ATPase activity of HMA1 is specifically stimulated by copper. Our results demonstrate that HMA1 offers an additional way to the previously characterized chloroplast envelope Cu-ATPase PAA1 to import copper in the chloroplast.

Chloroplasts contain a large variety of ions among which metal ions such as copper, iron, manganese, and zinc that are essential for their development and function. Copper is an essential redox cofactor required for a wide variety of processes, including photosynthetic electron transfer reactions (plastocyanin) and detoxification of superoxide radicals (Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase, SOD) 4The abbreviations used are: SOD, superoxide dismutase; Cu/Zn-SOD, Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase; PS, photosystem; ICP-AES, inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry; TMs, transmembrane segments; GFP, green fluorescent protein; T-DNA, segment of the Ti plasmid of A. tumifaciens; Ws, Wassilevskija background; MS, Murashige and Skoog. 4The abbreviations used are: SOD, superoxide dismutase; Cu/Zn-SOD, Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase; PS, photosystem; ICP-AES, inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry; TMs, transmembrane segments; GFP, green fluorescent protein; T-DNA, segment of the Ti plasmid of A. tumifaciens; Ws, Wassilevskija background; MS, Murashige and Skoog. (1Fox T.C. Guerinot M.L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 669-696Google Scholar). Other metal ions are cofactors for several enzymatic reactions: zinc is associated with chloroplast SOD, methionine synthase, carbonic anhydrase; manganese is required for oxygen evolution in photosynthesis; whereas iron is a cofactor of iron SOD and is found in iron-sulfur clusters of cytochrome b6 f complex, ferredoxin, photosystem I (PSI), and photosystem II (PSII) (2Raven J.A. Evans M.C.W. Korb R.E. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 111-149Crossref Google Scholar). All these metals are essential micronutrients but are toxic when present in excess (3Williams L.E. Pittman J.K. Hall J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 104-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). To maintain the concentration of metals within physiological limits, cells possess mechanisms that control the uptake, accumulation, trafficking, and also detoxification of metal ions. Little is known about metal transport into chloroplasts. Until now, the sole chloroplast proteins demonstrated as being involved in metal ions transport are PAA1 (4Shikanai T. Müller-Moulé P. Munekage Y. Niyogi K.K. Pilon M. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 1333-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and very recently PAA2 (5Abdel-Ghany S.E. Müller-Moulé P. Niyogi K.K. Pilon M. Shikanai T. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 1-19Crossref Scopus (259) Google Scholar), two P1B-type ATPases. PAA1, localized into the chloroplast envelope, supplies copper to the chloroplast, whereas PAA2, localized into the thylakoid membrane, delivers copper to the thylakoid lumen. One important result derived from this work is the fact that the disruption of the PAA1 gene does not fully abolish the import of copper into the chloroplast. From this recent observation, Abdel-Ghany and coworkers (5Abdel-Ghany S.E. Müller-Moulé P. Niyogi K.K. Pilon M. Shikanai T. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 1-19Crossref Scopus (259) Google Scholar) concluded that an as yet unidentified and additional way to PAA1 must exist to import copper into the chloroplast. From proteomic analyses of the Arabidopsis chloroplast envelope, we have identified several candidates for metal transport: putative ABC transporters (At1g70610, At2g01320, At5g58270, At5g03910, and At4g25450), a magnesium transporter protein (At5g22830), and the P-type ATPase HMA1 (6Ferro M.

Seigneurin-Berny, J. Joyard, and N. Rolland, unpublished data. 5D. Seigneurin-Berny, J. Joyard, and N. Rolland, unpublished data. P-ATPases are transmembrane proteins that couple ATP hydrolysis to the transport of various cations across membranes through a catalytic cycle involving the autophosphorylation of an Asp residue within a highly conserved DKTGT motif. P-ATPases are classified in several subgroups. Transition metal transporters are present within the P1B-ATPase subfamily (7Palmgren M.G. Axelsen K.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The vast majority of the characterized P1B-ATPases displays eight predicted transmembrane helices with a typical CPC motif in the sixth helix that is essential for metal transport. They have been classified, respectively, in the P1B-1 and P1B-2 ATPases subgroup their specificity to either Cu+/Ag+ or to Zn2+/Cd2+/Co2+/Pb2+ (8Argüello J.M. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 195: 93-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Such metal specificities are related to the presence of conserved residues, especially at the level of the seventh and eighth helices and can therefore be predicted from primary sequences. Among the eight P1B-ATPases from Arabidopsis (for review see Ref. 9Williams L.E. Mills R.F. Trends Plant Sci. 2005; 10: 491-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), in silico substrate predictions were experimentally confirmed for six transporters: PAA1, PAA2, and RAN1 (members of the P1B-1 subgroup) and HMA2, HMA3, and HMA4 (members of the P1B-2 subgroup). RAN1 was shown to be involved in the copper intracellular compartmentation allowing the supply of copper to ethylene receptors (10Hirayama T. Kieber J.J. Hirayama N. Kogan M. Guzman P. Nourizadeh S. Alonso J.M. Dailey W.P. Dancis A. Ecker J.R. Cell. 1999; 97: 383-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Concerning HMA2-4, an increasing amount of data supports the predictions that they are involved in zinc, cadmium, and/or lead transport (11Mills R.F. Krijger G.C. Baccarini P.J. Hall J.L. Williams L.E. Plant J. 2003; 35: 164-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 12Mills R.F. Francini A. Ferreira da Rocha P.S. Baccarini P.J. Aylett M. Krijger G.C. Williams L.E.

FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 1515-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In contrast, the few experimental data on transporters of the P1B-4 subgroup, such as HMA1 and OsHMA1, does not allow any accurate substrate and structure predictions. Because disruption of CoaT in Synechocystis, an enzyme of this group, reduces Co tolerance and increases Co accumulation (16Rutherford J.C. Cavet J.S. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25827-25832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), it was suggested that proteins of the P1B-4 subgroup could be devoted to divalent cation transport, especially cobalt (8Argüello J.M. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 195: 93-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In this study, we report the identification and functional characterization of a new chloroplast P-type ATPase, HMA1. We first provide evidence for this protein to reside in the chloroplast envelope. We also demonstrate through yeast expression that HMA1 is involved in both zinc and copper homeostasis. Furthermore, characterization of hma1 Arabidopsis mutants reveals a decrease in chloroplast copper content and in SOD activity and a photosensitivity phenotype under high light. Finally, measurements of ATPase activity in purified chloroplast envelope membranes demonstrate that HMA1 activity is specifically enhanced by copper. Altogether these results demonstrate that HMA1 is an envelope ATPase involved in delivering copper ions to the stroma, where they are essential for the detoxification of active oxygen species formed during photosynthesis under high light conditions. Plant Material and Growth Conditions—Arabidopsis plants, Wassilevskija background (Ws), were germinated in Petri dishes containing solidified medium (Murashige and Skoog (MS), 1% (w/v) sucrose, and 1% (w/v) agarose) for 2 weeks before transfer to soil. Plants were then grown in culture chambers at 23 °C (12-h light cycle) with a light intensity of 150 μmol·m-2·s-1 in standard conditions. For phenotypic analyses, seeds were germinated in plates containing MS salts in the absence or presence of CuSO4 at various concentrations (0.1, 1, 10, and 50 μm), under different light intensities (50, 110, 280, and 340 μmol·m-2·s-1) for 4 weeks. Purification of Chloroplasts and Chloroplast Subfractions from Arabidopsis—All operations were carried out at 0-5 °C. Percoll-purified chloroplasts were obtained from 100-200 g of Arabidopsis thaliana leaves. Crude cell extracts and chloroplast subfractions were purified and stored as previously described (6Ferro M. Salvi D. Brugiere S. Miras S. Kowalski S. Louwagie M. Garin J. Joyard J. Rolland N. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 325-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Analyses of the purity of chloroplast envelope preparations have shown a contamination with thylakoid protein between 1 and 3% (6Ferro M. Salvi D. Brugiere S. Miras S. Kowalski S. Louwagie M. Garin J. Joyard J. Rolland N. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 325-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Chloroplasts purified for ICP-AES analyses were washed in the following resuspension buffer: 400 mm sorbitol, 20 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.6), 2.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2. Protein content was estimated using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (17Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Chlorophyll content was determined by spectrophotometry in acetone solutions (18Bruinsma J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1961; 52: 576-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Isolation of HMA1 Insertional Mutants—The Arabidopsis hma1 mutants (lines ACT7 and DRC42) were identified by screening the FLAGdb/FST data base (19Samson F. Brunaud V. Balzergue S. Dubreucq B. Lepiniec L. Pelletier G. Caboche M. Lecharny A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) from the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (Versailles, France) collection of T-DNA insertional mutants. These lines, produced by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (20Bechtold N. Ellis J. Pelletier G. CR Acad. Sci. Paris Life Sci. 1993; 316: 1194-1199Google Scholar), were transformed with a T-DNA construct (pGKB5 binary vector) that carries both bar and nptII selection markers. Primary transformants were self-pollinated to obtain plants homozygous for the insertion. To identify homozygous plants, PCR analyses were carried out on genomic DNA using a primer for the T-DNA (Tag5, CTACAAATTGCCTTTTCTTATCGAC) and a gene-specific primer (FST1, CACCTCGAAGATCAGCCTCG the for ACT7 line and FST2, AGTGAGCTCCTAATGTGCAGAGCTTAAACG for the DRC42 line). In addition, the two gene-specific primers (FST1 and FST2) were used to detect plants that contain only a WT copy of the gene. The amplified bands were sequenced to confirm the T-DNA locations and orientations in HMA1 gene. Segregation patterns were analyzed by germinating progeny seeds on plates containing MS salts plus kanamycin (100 mg.1-1). Plants selected for further analysis segregated according to a 3:1 ratio, indicative of a single insert. Construction of Vectors for Stable Expression in Arabidopsis—To construct the vector for HMA1 overexpression in Arabidopsis Ws ecotype, the coding region of HMA1 was PCR-amplified using the two flanking primers BglII-N-ter (TCGAGATCTATGGAACCTGCAACTCTTACTC) and SacI-C-ter (AGTGAGCTCCTAATGTGCAGAGCTTAAACTG) from an Arabidopsis cDNA library. The PCR product was cloned into the pBluescript KS- vector (Stratagene). The BglII-SacI fragment cleaved from this plasmid was inserted into the BamHI-SacI digested pEL103 binary vector (kanamycin resistance to transform wild-type plants). Plasmids used for Agrobacterium tumefaciens transformation were prepared using the “QIAfilter Plasmid Midi Kit” (Qiagen Laboratories; Germany). Arabidopsis Transformation—Wild-type Arabidopsis plants (ecotype Ws) were transformed by dipping the floral buds of 4-week-old plants into an A. tumefaciens (C58 strain) solution containing a surfactant (Silwett L-77) according to Clough and Bent (21Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primary transformants were selected on MS medium containing 100 mg·liter-1 kanamycin. Only lines segregating 3:1 for the resistance to kanamycin and expressing the recombinant protein were selected for further analysis. Primary transformants were then self-pollinated to obtain plants homozygous for the insertion. Construction of GFP Reporter Plasmids for Transient Expression in Arabidopsis—The GFP reporter plasmid Pro35SS:sGFP(S65T) and the plasmid containing the transit peptide (TP) sequence from small unit of Rubisco fused to GFP [Pro35S:TP-sGFP(S65T)] were described previously (22Chiu W. Niwa Y. Zeng W. Hirano T. Kobayashi H. Sheen J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 325-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). To express HMA1:GFP fusion, we PCR-amplified the entire sequence of HMA1 using the primers SalI-N-ter (TTCGTCGACATGGAACCTGCAACTCTTACTCG) and PciI-C-ter (GCAACAGTTTAAGCTCTGCACATCACTGTGG) from an A. thaliana cDNA library. The PCR product was cloned into the pBluescript KS- vector (Stratagene). The SalI-PciI fragment was inserted into the SalI-NcoI-digested GFP reporter plasmid Pro35SS:sGFP(S65T) to create the Pro35SS: HMA1-sGFP(S65T) plasmid. From this construct, we extracted the entire cassette Pro35S-HMA1-GFP-Nos Ter using EcoRI and a partial HindIII digestion. This fragment was purified and inserted into the EcoRI-HindIII-digested pEL103 binary vector (kanamycin resistance to transform wild-type plants). The plasmid used for A. tumefaciens transformation were prepared using the QIAfilter Plasmid Midi Kit (Qiagen Laboratories). Arabidopsis Leaves Agroinfiltration—Leaves from A. thaliana (ecotype Ws) were injected with A. tumefaciens strains harboring the appropriate plasmids according to (23Lavy M. Bracha-Drori K. Sternberg H. Yalovsky S.A. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 2431-2450Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Three or four days after injection, localization of GFP and GFP fusions in leaves was analyzed by confocal fluorescence microscopy as previously described (24Miras S. Salvi D. Ferro M. Grunwald D. Garin J. Joyard J. Rolland N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47770-47778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Foliar and Chloroplastic Metal Content—Leaves were dried for 48 h at 50 °C. Chloroplasts and dried leaves were mineralized, and metal content was determined using ICP-AES as previously described (25Gravot A. Lieutaud A. Verret F. Auroy P. Vavasseur A. Richaud P. FEBS Lett. 2004; 561: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). RT-PCR—A. thaliana (Ws) plants were grown on sand up to 2 months with an 8-h photoperiod. Total RNA were extracted from various plant tissues with TRIzol (Invitrogen). RT-PCR experiments were performed as previously described (25Gravot A. Lieutaud A. Verret F. Auroy P. Vavasseur A. Richaud P. FEBS Lett. 2004; 561: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We used the following primers to analyze the expression of HMA1, PAA1, and PAA2: HMA1 For (GATCATCACAACCACCATCATC) and HMA1 Rev (CGCTTTTGTATGACAAATCAG); PAA1 For (ACGGGTTATAGCAGGAG) and PAA1 Rev (GTCGTTTCGGTTCGAG); PAA2 For (AAAGGTGGTTTGGCCG) and PAA2 Rev (GGACACTCCCATCGAC); CSD2 For (TCCGTCGAAAGCGTTG) and CSD2 Rev (GCCTCTGACTTAGAGCG). SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analyses—SDS-PAGE analyses were performed as described by Chua (26Chua N.H. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 69: 434-436Crossref Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Proteins were revealed by Coomassie Blue staining. For Western blot analyses, gels were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (BA85, Schleicher and Schuell). The polypeptide corresponding to the predicted loop between amino acids 213 and 368 was produced in Escherichia coli and purified for the production of a rabbit polyclonal antiserum. This antiserum was used, at a 1/1000 dilution, to detect HMA1. Plasma membrane and mitochondria were purified, from Arabidopsis, as previously described (27Marmagne A. Rouet M.A. Ferro M. Rolland N.

To validate purity of the membrane fractions, we used antibodies directed against envelope E37 (29Teyssier E. Block M.A. Douce R. Joyard J.

Superoxide Dismutase Activity—SOD activity was performed according to McCord and Fridovich (32McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The reaction mixture consisted of 50 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.8) buffer, 0.5 mm EDTA, 4 mm xanthine, 0.5 mm nitroblue tetrazolium, and 0.01 unit of xanthine oxidase. A concentration curve was produced for each sample to calculate SOD activity. One unit of SOD activity was defined as the amount of extract that inhibited the rate of nitroblue tetrazolium reduction by 50%. The assays were carried out on purified stromal proteins. Cloning of HMA1—A reverse transcription was performed on poly(A)+ mRNA extracted from leaves of A. thaliana (Ws ecotype). The open reading frame of HMA1 was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′HMA1: CCATGGAACCTGCAACTCTTACTCGTTC and 3′HMA1: CCCCCTAATGTGCAGAGCTTAAACTGTTGC, subcloned in the pCR®-XL-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. This plasmid was modified to insert the NotI restriction site, allowing the subsequent cloning of the full-length cDNA in the pYES2 yeast expression vector (Invitrogen). Two truncated versions of HMA1, HMA1Δ60 and HMA1Δ89, deleted, respectively, from the first 60 and 89 amino acids, were cloned in the pYES2-TOPO vector using, respectively, as forward primers HMA1Δ60for: CCGGAATTCCGGATGCTACGTGCTGTCGAAGATCACCATC and HMA1Δ89for: GGGATGGGATGCTGTTCTGTGGAATTGAAAGCGG. Both reactions were conducted using the reverse primer HMA1rev: AAGGAAAAAAGCGGCCGCAAAAGGAAAACTAATGTGCAGAGCTTAAACTGTTG. Directed mutagenesis was performed on the pYES2-HMA1Δ60 plasmid using the QuikChange® kit (Stratagene), allowing the expression in yeast of D453A, S410C, and H769E substituted versions of HMA1Δ60 or HMA1Δ89. Yeast Expression, Metal Tolerance, and Accumulation—BY4741 wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain (EUROSCARF acc. no. Y00000) was transformed with the different plasmids and grown on synthetic medium as described in Gravot et al. (25Gravot A. Lieutaud A. Verret F. Auroy P. Vavasseur A. Richaud P. FEBS Lett. 2004; 561: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), except that the precultures were performed with glucose 2% (w/w) as carbon source to repress the protein expression. Drop-test experiments were performed using CuSO4, ZnSO4, NiCl2, and CoSO4 at various concentrations, and growth was controlled from 2 to 5 days depending on the metal and the concentration. Liquid medium experiments were performed starting from a preculture with 2% (w/w) glucose, diluted in 30 ml to OD = 1 and then cultivated with 2% (w/w) galactose plus 1% (w/w) raffinose for 24 h. Cells were then washed twice with 10 mm EDTA and twice with water. Yeast pellets were then dried at 50 °C and mineralized, and the metal content was analyzed using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer ICP-AES (Vista MPX, Varian). In Vivo Spectroscopic Estimation of Plastocyanin (PC)/PSI Ratios—Estimation of the PC pool in WT and mutant chloroplasts was performed in vivo using an home built spectrophotometer, as previously described (33Joliot P. Joliot A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4913-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Leaves were illuminated by a far red source at 720 nm to oxidize completely the pool of the PSI donors. Alternatively, experiments were performed in the presence of the PSII inhibitor 3-(3′,4′-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea. Absorption changes were detected by discrete flashes provided by a light-emitting-diode source that delivers 10-μs square pulses. Light was filtered with appropriate filters, to select P700 and PC redox changes. Absorption changes associated to P700 redox changes were computed as ΔI/I 705 nm -ΔI/I 870 nm/2. DI/I PC was computed as ΔI/I 870 nm +ΔI/I 705 nm/10. ATPase Assay—ATPase activity was measured as the rate of ADP-dependent NADH oxidation in a coupled system containing NADH, phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase as described by Blumwald and Poole (34Blumwald E. Poole R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3683-3687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activity was monitored in the presence of Mg-ATP and after addition of 3 mm CuSO4, CoSO4, ZnSO4, FeSO4, and MnSO4. The assays were performed on highly purified envelope proteins derived from chloroplasts of WT, hma1 mutants, and HMA1-overexpressing plants. Sequence Analyses—Subcellular localizations were predicted using the following programs: ChloroP at www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ChloroP/ (35Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 978-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar) and Predotar at genoplante-info.infobiogen.fr/predotar/ (36Small I. Peeters N. Legeai F. Lurin C. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 1581-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). The location of possible transmembrane helices was determined using the program ARAMEMNON at aramemnon.botanik.uni-koeln.de/ (37Schwacke R. Schneider A. van Der Graaff E. Fischer K. Catoni E. Desimone M. Frommer W.B. Flügge U.I. Kunze R. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 16-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Sequence data from this article have been deposited with the GenBank data library under accession number AY907350 for HMA1 (At4g37270). Primary Sequence Analysis—According to Argüello (8Argüello J.M. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 195: 93-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), and as predicted by hydropathy analysis (ARAMEMNON) (37Schwacke R. Schneider A. van Der Graaff E. Fischer K. Catoni E. Desimone M. Frommer W.B. Flügge U.I. Kunze R. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 16-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), the membrane topology of HMA1 (At4g37270) suggests the presence of 6 or 7 transmembrane segments (TMs) with 4/5 in the N-half of the protein and two downstream of the large loop characterizing P-type ATPases (Fig. 1). HMA1 possesses the typical Ser-Pro-Cys motif in the 4th/5th TM rather than the usual Cys-Pro-Cys/His/Ser motif found in other P1B-ATPases. Furthermore, HMA1 has a His-rich region in its N-terminal part that could play a role in the function or regulation of this transporter, because His residues are often featured in metal-binding domains. The 6 TMs model would put both the His-rich region and the ATPase domain on the same side of the membrane, as for other P1B-ATPases (for review, see Ref. 9Williams L.E. Mills R.F. Trends Plant Sci. 2005; 10: 491-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). These two domains would then face the intermembrane space of the chloroplast envelope. In silico analysis using ChloroP on HMA1 primary sequence (35Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 978-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar) predicted the presence of a cleavable transit peptide (60 first amino acids; Fig. 1). However, other prediction programs (found in ARAMEMNON) predicted a mitochondrial localization. The experimental validation of the subcellular localization was therefore necessary. Validation of the Subplastidial Localization—We first performed transient expression of HMA1-GFP fusion in Arabidopsis cells. Because the entire protein fused to GFP was not expressed in this system, we used the 119 first amino acids of HMA1 (including the predicted transit peptide) fused to GFP to transform Arabidopsis cells. Consistent with the prediction of ChloroP, HMA1-1/119 fused to GFP was associated to chloroplasts (supplemental Fig. S1). To validate the localization of the full-length protein, we also performed transient expression of HMA1-GFP fusion in Arabidopsis leaves. As expected (Fig. 2A), GFP alone was localized in the nucleus and the cytoplasm, whereas the plastid control (the transit sequence of the small subunit of Rubisco fused to GFP) was targeted to the chloroplast. HMA1 fused to GFP was only detected in the chloroplasts from both epidermal and parenchymal cells, and no staining was observed in other membranes (Fig. 2A). To strengthen this result, we then performed Western blot experiments on purified subplastidial fractions, purified mitochondria, and plasma membrane proteins. In good agreement with transient expression experiments, HMA1 was only detected in the envelope membranes (Fig. 2B) thus excluding the mitochondrial localization predicted in ARAMEMNON database (37Schwacke R. Schneider A. van Der Graaff E. Fischer K. Catoni E. Desimone M. Frommer W.B. Flügge U.I. Kunze R. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 16-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). HMA1 was also not detected in two independent plasma membrane preparations thus excluding localization of HMA1 in this membrane system. Finally, the use of antibodies directed against markers from other membrane fractions, clearly demonstrates that association of HMA1 with the chloroplast envelope cannot be due to cross-contamination of envelope preparations with proteins from mitochondria, thylakoids, or plasma membrane. The expression of HMA1 was analyzed by RT-PCR. HMA1 transcripts were mainly detected in green tissues, which is consistent with a chloroplast localization of the protein (Fig. 2C). A comparative analysis was performed for the two other previously identified chloroplast Cu-ATPases. A faint expression was observed in roots thus suggesting a possible expression in non-green plastids. In good agreement with the work of Abdel-Ghany et al. (5Abdel-Ghany S.E. Müller-Moulé P. Niyogi K.K. Pilon M. Shikanai T. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 1-19Crossref Scopus (259) Google Scholar), PAA2 transcripts were detected in green tis"
https://openalex.org/W2097664895,"Mutations in the VMD2 gene cause Best's disease, an inherited form of macular degeneration. The reduction in the light-peak amplitude in the patient's electro-oculogram suggests that bestrophin-1 influences the membrane conductance of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Systemic application of the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nimodipine reduced the light-peak amplitude in the rat electroretinogram but not a- and b-waves. Expression of bestrophin-1 in a RPE cell line (RPE-J) led to changes in L-type channel properties. Wild-type bestrophin-1 induced an acceleration of activation kinetics of Ba2+ currents through L-type Ca2+ channels and a shift of the voltage-dependent activation to more negative values, closer to the resting potential of RPE cells. Expression of bestrophin-1 with Best disease-causing mutations led to comparable shifts in voltage-dependent activation but different effects on activation and inactivation kinetics. Bestrophin W93C exhibited slowed activation and inactivation, and bestrophin R218C accelerated the activation and inactivation. Thus, transfection of RPE cells with bestrophin-1 distinctively changed L-type Ca2+ channel kinetics and voltage-dependence. On the basis of these data, we propose that presence of bestrophin-1 influences kinetics and voltage-dependence of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and that these effects might open new ways to understand the mechanisms leading to retinal degeneration in Best's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2163073874,"Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a life-threatening disorder characterized by skeletal muscle rigidity and elevated body temperature in response to halogenated anesthetics such as isoflurane or halothane. Mutation of tyrosine 522 of RyR1 (the predominant skeletal muscle calcium release channel) to serine has been associated with human malignant hyperthermia. In the present study, mice created harboring this mutation were found to represent the first murine model of human malignant hyperthermia. Mice homozygous for the Y522S mutation exhibit skeletal defects and die during embryonic development or soon after birth. Heterozygous mice, which correspond to the human occurrence of this mutation, are MH susceptible, experiencing whole body contractions and elevated core temperatures in response to isoflurane exposure or heat stress. Skeletal muscles from heterozygous mice exhibit increased susceptibility to caffeine- and heat-induced contractures in vitro. In addition, the heterozygous expression of the mutation results in enhanced RyR1 sensitivity to activation by temperature, caffeine, and voltage but not uncompensated sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium leak or store depletion. We conclude that the heterozygous expression of the Y522S mutation confers susceptibility to both heat- and anesthetic-induced MH responses."
https://openalex.org/W1965311107,"The laser-induced movement of CO molecules over a platinum surface was followed in real time by means of ultrafast vibrational spectroscopy. Because the CO molecules bound on different surface sites exhibit different C-O stretch vibrational frequencies, the site-to-site hopping, triggered by excitation with a laser pulse, can be determined from subpicosecond changes in the vibrational spectra. The unexpectedly fast motion--characterized by a 500-femtosecond time constant--reveals that a rotational motion of the CO molecules, rather than pure translation, is required for this diffusion process. This conclusion is corroborated by density functional theory calculations."
https://openalex.org/W2061561620,"Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) regulate apoptosis primarily by inhibiting caspase-family proteases. However, many IAPs also possess E3 ligase (ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase) activities implicated in both caspase-dependent and -independent functions of these proteins. Here, we compared the structural features of cIAP1 responsible for its interactions with two known target proteins, TRAF2 and SMAC. The N-terminal (BIR1) and C-terminal (BIR3) BIR domains of cIAP1 were determined to be necessary and sufficient for binding TRAF2 and SMAC, respectively. Mutational analysis of the BIR1 and BIR3 domains identified critical residues required for TRAF2 and SMAC binding. Using these mutants, cIAP1-mediated ubiquitination of TRAF2 and SMAC in vitro was determined to be correspondingly dependent on intact binding sites on BIR1 and BIR3. Because TRAF2 regulates NF-κB activation, the effects of cIAP1 on TRAF2-mediated induction of NF-κB transcriptional activity were studied using reporter gene assays. Expression of a fragment of cIAP1 encompassing the three BIR domains (but not full-length cIAP1) greatly enhanced TRAF2-induced increases in NF-κB activity, providing a convenient assay for monitoring BIR-dependent effects of cIAP1 on TRAF2 in cells. BIR1 mutants of the BIR1-3 fragment of cIAP1 that failed to bind TRAF2 lost the ability to modulate NF-κB activity, demonstrating a requirement for BIR1-mediated interactions with TRAF2. Altogether, these findings demonstrate the modularity and diversification of BIR domains, showing that a single cIAP can direct its E3 ligase activity toward different substrates and can alter the cellular functions of different protein targets in accordance with differences in the specificity of individual BIR domains.

The human genome includes eight genes that encode BIR-containing proteins. Among these are cIAP1 and cIAP2, which are highly homologous in amino acid sequence and domain structure, containing (from the N to C terminus) three tandem BIR domains followed by a CARD and RING. The cIAP1 and cIAP2 proteins are unique among the BIR-family proteins in their ability to form complexes with TRAF-family adapter proteins involved in TNF receptor signaling (3Shu H.B. Takeuchi M. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13973-13978Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 4Rothe M. Pan M.G. Henzel W.J. Ayres T.M. Goeddel D.V.

These members of the IAP family are known to induce ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of the TRAFs to which they bind (e.g. TRAF1, TRAF2), but the structural basis for this phenomenon is largely unknown. In addition to binding certain caspases (6Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar), cIAP1 and cIAP2 are reported to bind SMAC, a mitochondrial protein that competes with caspases for binding to IAPs when released into the cytosol (7Hu S. Yang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10055-10060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In the IAP-family member, XIAP, the binding site for SMAC has been mapped to the third BIR domain (BIR3), where it competes for binding to caspase-9 (8Srinivasula S.M. Hegde R. Saleh A. Datta P. Shiozaki E. Chai J. Lee R.A. Robbins P.D. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Shi Y. Alnemri E.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). However, the site on cIAP1 and cIAP2, where SMAC binds has not been previously elucidated, and its relation to the sites required for binding to other targets such as TRAF1 and TRAF2 have not been heretofore defined. Here, we undertook a structure-function analysis of cIAP1 to compare the binding sites for TRAF2 and SMAC and to reveal the functional consequences of disruptions in these binding sites. Our findings indicate that TRAF2 binds the BIR1 domain, whereas SMAC binds the BIR3 domain of cIAP1. The integrity of these binding sites on BIR1 and BIR3 is required for cIAP1-mediated ubiquitination of TRAF2 and SMAC, respectively, revealing the basis for differential targeting of protein substrates by this E3 ligase. We also show evidence of BIR1-dependent modulation of TRAF2-mediated regulation of NF-κB. Altogether, these findings demonstrate the modularity and diversification of BIR domains, showing that a single IAP-family protein can direct its E3 ligase activity toward different substrates and can alter the cellular functions of different protein targets in accordance with differences in the specificity of individual BIR domains. Plasmids, Mutagenesis, Recombinant Proteins—A cDNA clone encoding cIAP1 (ID 627116) was obtained from IMAGE consortium through ResGen (Invitrogen) and PCR-subcloned into the pcDNA3-FLAG expression vector. Deletion or point mutations were introduced by PCR or using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The resulting cDNAs were subcloned into either pGEX4T-1 or a modified pET21b plasmid. Plasmids encoding some of the cIAP1 proteins and all of the cIAP2, XIAP, and other proteins have been described (6Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C.

Cell Culture and Transfections—Cells were grown in either Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (HEK293 and HEK293T) or RPMI (MCF-7) media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Transfections were performed using Superfect (Qiagen) for HEK293T cells or Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM-reduced serum medium (Invitrogen). The Lipofectamine transfection mix was replaced with fresh medium after 4 h, whereas cells were incubated with Superfect transfection mix for 24 h. Immunoprecipitations—Cells were harvested for SDS-PAGE or immunoprecipitation ∼24 h post-transfection. Cells were lysed in ice-cold immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0. 2% Nonidet P-40, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Lysis with immunoprecipitation buffer was complemented with sonication (5 pulses) on ice. The lysate was cleared of cell debris by centrifugation at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was saved for SDS-PAGE or immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG or anti-Myc antibodies conjugated to Sepharose beads overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The beads were washed 3 times in lysis buffer, resuspended in 2× Laemmli buffer, and boiled for 5 min to release bound proteins. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting after transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Osmonics, Inc.). Competition assays involving immunoprecipitated proteins were performed by co-incubating the immunoprecipitation reaction with 1 mm competitor tetrapeptides (AVPI, GVPF) or 5 μm protein (His-BIR3 XIAP). Anti-SMAC antiserum was generated in rabbits. Other antibodies used were anti-TRAF2 (Santa Cruz, N-19 and C-20), anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), anti-Myc clone 9E10 (Santa Cruz Bio-technology).

A total of 5-10 μl of 35S-labeled in vitro translated mix was incubated with purified recombinant proteins (20-50 μg) in 0. 3 ml of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 0. 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm KCl, and 0. 05% Triton X-100) at 4 °C for 120 min. After the incubation, 20 μl of binding buffer-equilibrated glutathione-Sepharose beads were added to the mixture and further incubated for 90 min. The beads were washed 3 times for 10 min each with 1.0 ml of binding buffer. Bound proteins were released by boiling in 25 μl of SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10%) and autofluorography. For autofluorography, gels were first fixed in a 25% isopropanol, 10% acetic acid solution for 20 min, briefly rinsed with deionized water, and incubated in a 1 m salicylic acid solution for 30 min. After a brief washing, the gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film for 2-16 h at -70 °C. Where competition assays were performed, the competitor peptides (AVPI, GVPF) or proteins (BIR1, SMAC) were co-incubated in the binding reaction with the test proteins. Ex Vivo Ubiquitination Assay—FLAG-tagged cIAP1 proteins were ectopically expressed in 293T cells. After 24 h the cells were lysed in assay buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and a protease inhibitor mixture) augmented with brief sonication. The lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG M2 antibody-conjugated Sepharose beads. Beads were washed first with 1.0 ml of assay buffer for 10 min, then once with 0. 5 ml of assay buffer containing 250 mm NaCl for 5 min, and a third time with 1.0 ml of assay buffer for 10 min. The washed beads were incubated with a 26-μl mixture of E1- and E2-containing fractions (8 μg of total protein each), ubiquitin (150 μm), ubiquitin aldehyde (1 μm), and energy-generating system (32 μg) (ubiquitin-protein conjugation kit, Boston Biochem). After incubating at 30 °C for 3 h, the reaction was stopped by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 20 mm. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant was analyzed for formation of high molecular weight ubiquitin conjugate formation by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. NF-κB Reporter Assays—HEK293 or HEK293T cells were seeded either into 96- or 24-well dishes. After 24 h, the cells in 96-well dishes were transfected with 3.3 ng of plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase, 10 ng of firefly luciferase, and 8-33 ng of test plasmids per well. For 24-well dishes, each well contained 4 ng of Renilla luciferase, 80 ng of firefly luciferase, and 600-1000 ng of test plasmids. All transfections were performed in triplicate, and the total DNA per well was normalized by the addition of pcDNA3 empty vector plasmid DNA. Assays results were determined 24-27 h after transfection using the Dual Luciferase Assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The BIR1 Domain of cIAP1 Is Sufficient to Bind TRAF2—Previous studies have shown that cIAP1 and cIAP2 can bind TRAF1 and TRAF2 in the context of TNFRI and TNFRII signaling (3Shu H.B. Takeuchi M. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13973-13978Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 4Rothe M. Pan M.G. Henzel W.J. Ayres T.M. Goeddel D.V.

To determine the structural basis for the interaction of cIAP1 with TRAF2, we expressed various fragments of cIAP1 (Fig. 1) as epitope-tagged proteins in HEK293T cells and assessed their ability to interact with endogenous TRAF2 present in the lysates using co-immunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 2A). Moreover, by relying on endogenous SMAC present in detergent lysates, we simultaneously assessed the binding of these fragments of cIAP1 to the SMAC protein. Comparisons were made with XIAP, which does not bind TRAF2 but does bind SMAC (6Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar, 17Liu Z. Sun C. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Betz S.F. Oost T. Herrmann J. Wu J.C. Fesik S.W.

A, the BIR1 domain of cIAP1 is necessary and sufficient for interaction with TRAF2. The indicated Myc or FLAG epitope-tagged cIAP1 proteins were expressed in 293T cells. The expressed proteins were immunoprecipitated (IP) using anti-epitope tag antibodies, and co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous TRAF2 was analyzed by immunoblotting (WB). The same membranes were then re-probed with anti-SMAC antibody (fourth panel). The second and fifth panels show the endogenous proteins TRAF2 and SMAC, respectively, whereas the third panel shows expression of the ectopic IAP and control proteins in lysate. Because of its small size, the cIAP1 BIR3 fragment was not resolvable on the same gel, and its expression was verified separately (data not shown). The asterisk (*) represents the apparent decrease in SMAC co-immunoprecipitation due to increased degradation when the BIR3-RING fragment is expressed in cells (data not shown). The inset panel (#) shows a longer membrane exposure time to demonstrate BIR2-3 cIAP1 expression. FL, full-length. B, XIAP does not bind TRAF2. The indicated XIAP protein fragments were expressed in 293T cells. Immunoprecipitation and detection of co-immunoprecipitated proteins was carried out as in panel A. XIAP-associated proteins were detected by immunoblotting using anti-TRAF2 antibody (first panel) or anti-SMAC antibody (fourth panel). The second, third, and fifth panels show the expression of TRAF2, IAP, and SMAC proteins, respectively. In panels A and B, the protein FLAG-Hippi was expressed as an irrelevant control protein to demonstrate specificity of protein interactions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) TRAF2 co-immunoprecipitated with all fragments of cIAP1 containing the BIR1 domain but failed to associate with all fragments lacking the BIR1 domain (Fig. 2A). Moreover, TRAF2 co-immunoprecipitated with a fragment of cIAP1 containing only the BIR1 domain. In contrast, SMAC co-immunoprecipitated with all cIAP1 fragments that contained BIR3 while failing to associate with all cIAP1 fragments lacking BIR3 (Fig. 2A). Unlike BIR3, BIR2 and a fragment containing BIR1-2 of cIAP1 failed to associate with SMAC (Fig. 2 and supplemental data), suggesting that the BIR1 and BIR2 domains of cIAP1 may not have the structural determinants required to efficiently bind SMAC in cells. Immunoblot analysis using anti-epitope antibodies confirmed production of all fragments of cIAP1. Although not as comprehensively analyzed, similar results were obtained for cIAP2, confirming that BIR1 is necessary and sufficient for co-immunoprecipitating TRAF2 (Fig. 3B and not shown). In contrast to cIAP1, TRAF2 co-immunoprecipitated neither with full-length XIAP nor with any of the XIAP fragments tested (Fig. 2B). However, SMAC did co-immunoprecipitate with full-length XIAP and with all fragments of XIAP containing BIR3. SMAC also co-immunoprecipitated weakly with fragments of XIAP containing BIR2, consistent with recent comparisons of SMAC-based peptide binding to BIR2 versus BIR3 of XIAP (18Huang Y. Rich R.L. Myszka D.G. Wu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49517-49522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thus, cIAP1 and XIAP differ in their ability to bind TRAF2 while displaying a conserved ability to bind SMAC via their BIR3 domains. To confirm that the BIR1 is directly responsible for TRAF2 binding, we performed in vitro protein binding assays using GST fusion proteins produced in and purified from bacteria. First, we used the GST pull-down method to compare the ability of cIAP1, cIAP2, and XIAP to bind TRAF2 in vitro, employing fragments of cIAP1, cIAP2, and XIAP comprised of the three tandem BIR domains and using l-[35S]methionine-labeled TRAF2 prepared by in vitro translation (Fig. 3A). TRAF2 associated with GST-cIAP1 (BIR1-3) and with GST-cIAP2 (BIR1-3) but not with GST-XIAP (BIR1-3). TRAF2 also did not associate with a GST fusion protein containing the full-length XIAP protein. Thus, consistent with prior data, TRAF2 selectively binds cIAP1 and cIAP2, failing to associate with XIAP. As controls for this TRAF2 binding assay, we also compared the GST control (non-fusion) protein and GST-CD40 cytosolic domain, showing binding of TRAF2 to the latter but not the former, consistent with published evidence that TRAF2 binds directly to the cytosolic tail of CD40 (19Leo E. Zapata J.M. Reed J.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3908-3913Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Next, we tested whether GST fusion proteins containing only the BIR1 domain could bind TRAF2. Because production of the soluble recombinant GST fusion BIR1 domain of cIAP1 proved difficult, we used the BIR1 domain of cIAP2 in an in vitro binding assay. For this experiment, we compared GST-BIR1 fusion from cIAP2 with GST-BIR1 of XIAP using in vitro translated 35S-labeled TRAF2. As shown in Fig. 3B, the BIR1 domain of cIAP2 bound to TRAF2, whereas BIR1 of XIAP did not. The binding was specific, as the positive control fragment containing all the three BIR domains of cIAP2, but not the negative control GST protein, was able to bind TRAF2. We also observed that GST-BIR1 of cIAP2 bound full-length TRAF2 as well as a fragment of TRAF2 lacking the ring and zinc finger domains but not a fragment of TRAF2 containing only the C-TRAF domain (supplemental data), consistent with prior data indicating that cIAP1 and cIAP2 require the coiled-coil region of TRAF2 for binding (4Rothe M. Pan M.G. Henzel W.J. Ayres T.M. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 83: 1243-1252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). Finally, we used the GST-BIR1 domain of cIAP2 to perform competitive binding experiments as another means of determining whether the BIR1 domain is responsible for TRAF2 binding. For these experiments, lysates were prepared from HEK293T cells that had been transfected with plasmids encoding FLAG-cIAP1 and which contain endogenous TRAF2 (and SMAC), then either GST-BIR1 from cIAP2 or GST-BIR1 from XIAP protein was added to the lysates as a competitor. FLAG-cIAP1 was immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG antibody, and associated TRAF2 (and SMAC) were detected by immunoblotting. Although TRAF2 associated with FLAG-cIAP1 immunoprecipitates that were prepared using lysates that were untreated or that were treated with GST-BIR1 of XIAP, the addition of GST-BIR1 of cIAP2 to lysates inhibited TRAF2 binding to FLAG-cIAP1. In contrast, SMAC co-immunoprecipitation with FLAG-cIAP1 was unaffected by the addition of these GST fusion proteins (Fig. 3C), demonstrating the specificity of the competition for TRAF2. After performing immunoprecipitations, glutathione-Sepharose was added to the same lysates, and the GST fusion proteins were recovered and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting for associated TRAF2. As shown in Fig. 3C, TRAF2 was recovered with GST-BIR1 of cIAP2 but not GST-BIR1 of XIAP, confirming that the BIR1 domain of cIAP2 is sufficient to bind TRAF2. Altogether, these data demonstrate the BIR1 domains of cIAP1 and cIAP2 are sufficient to bind TRAF2. Mutagenesis Analysis of BIR1 Domain of cIAP1 Identifies Residues Required for TRAF2 Binding—TRAF2 binds the BIR1 domain of cIAP1 and cIAP2 but not the BIR1 domain of XIAP. We, therefore, compared the amino acid sequences of the BIR1 domains of cIAP1 and cIAP2 with XIAP to identify differences that might explain their differential ability to bind TRAF2 (Fig. 4A). Also, because the BIR1 domain of cIAP1 binds TRAF2, whereas the BIR2 and BIR3 domains of cIAP1 do not, we also compared the amino acid sequence of the BIR1 of cIAP1 with the BIR2 and BIR3 domains (Fig. 4B). Additionally, to narrow the choice of residues to consider for mutagenesis studies, we employed comparative homology modeling (13Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar, 14Guex N. Peitsch M.C.

Sci. 1995; 20: 82-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) of the cIAP1-BIR1 domain using the previously solved three-dimensional structures for XIAP-BIR2 and XIAP-BIR3 as templates (Fig. 4C). Homology modeling for BIR1 of cIAP1 predicted the presence of a typical BIR domain core structure comprised of two α-helices followed by three antiparallel β strands followed by a third α-helix. We used this model to distinguish residues that were likely to be surface-exposed from residues buried in the core of the domain, favoring surface exposed residues for mutagenesis. Because TRAF2 has been reported to bind a peptidyl motif found in the cytosolic domains of certain TNF-family receptors comprised of the consensus sequence PXQX(T/S) (20Li C. Norris P.S. Ni C. -Z. Havert M.L. Chiong E.M. Tran B.R. Cabezas E. Cheng G. Reed J.C. Satterthwait A.C. Ware C.F. Ely K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50523-50529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we focused on regions of the BIR1 domain of cIAP1 that showed similarity to this binding motif. PXQX(T/S)-like motifs were present at residues 61-65 of cIAP1 (PVSER) and at residues 99-103 (PIQKH). In both cases these motifs occur at the border of a loop and beginning of an α-helix and are predicted to be surface-exposed, based on the three-dimensional model. Also, comparison of these candidate motifs with the sequences of BIR domains that fail to bind TRAF2 suggested specific residues within these motifs that might account for specificity. For example, the PVSER motif at residues 61-66 of cIAP1 is perfectly matched with the corresponding sequence of the BIR1 domain of cIAP2 but differs from XIAP, which has the sequence PVSAS (Fig. 4A, motif 1). Also, the PIQKH motif at 99-103 of cIAP1 compares with the similar sequence of PTEKH in cIAP2 but is quite different from the corresponding AVGRH sequence within BIR1 of XIAP (Fig. 4, motif 2). Additional sequences resembling the PXQX(T/S) motif were also found in BIR1 of cIAP1 but were discounted as likely binding sites for TRAF2 bec"

In the resting state, the EGFR exists as a monomeric, single membrane spanning protein. Binding of its ligand to the extracellular domain of the receptor induces dimerization of the receptor and stimulation of its intrinsic kinase domain. This kinase transphosphorylates a number of carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic portion of the receptor that then serve as docking sites for the Src homology 2 domains of downstream signaling effectors (2Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M.

As such, the EGFR has been a useful chemotherapeutic target in a number of cancers (5Rowinsky E.K. Annu. Rev. Med. 2004; 55: 433-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In addition to the signaling events initiated by ligand binding, EGFR stimulation also triggers the internalization of the ligand-receptor complex via the canonical clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway (6Wiley H.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Through a series of budding and fusion reactions, the ligand and receptor traffic through clathrin-coated vesicles, early and late endosomes, and lysosomes. There are at least three known functions of the endocytic pathway. First, it regulates the duration of the EGF·EGFR complex by causing the dissociation of the two proteins in acidic compartments. Second, EGFR levels are controlled through lysosomal degradation after ligand stimulation. Third, it places the activated EGFR in the proper cellular locale to allow it to signal to the appropriate downstream effectors (6Wiley H.S. Exp.

Identification of proteins that regulate these transitions will be useful for generating tools to examine the functional significance of various compartments in the regulation of EGFR signaling. Rab proteins are a family of small molecular weight guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins) that regulate vesicular budding and fusion reactions by oscillating between active, GTP and inactive, GDP bound forms (14Rodman J.S. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 183-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Over 60 different Rab proteins have been identified; each is unique in cellular and subcellular localization as well as the vesicles that they fuse (15Seabra M.C. Wasmeier C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Many G-proteins have been implicated in EGFR endocytic trafficking. There is literature indicating that dynamin coordinates EGFR endocytosis (13Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L.

However, it is unclear whether rab7 coordinates endocytic trafficking of all proteins or if rab7 regulates the movement of select cargoes. Specifically, it is unclear if functional rab7 is needed for normal EGF·EGFR endocytic trafficking. Second, it is unclear in which compartment cargo accumulates if rab7-mediated trafficking were disrupted. Currently, the literature remains controversial as to whether rab7 coordinates movement between the early and late endosome or whether it regulates trafficking between the late endosome and lysosome (22Feng Y. Press B. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1435-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 23Press B. Feng Y. Hoflack B. Wandinger-Ness A. J.

To understand the physiologic significance of endocytic trafficking, a better characterization of the compartments affected by the expression of mutant forms of regulatory proteins is needed. In this report, dominant negative and constitutively active mutants of rab7 are transiently overexpressed in HeLa cells to study the role of this GTPase in EGFR trafficking. We find that changes in rab7 activity do not alter either the steady-state distribution of the EGFR or ligand-mediated entry of the receptor into the cell. However, inhibition and activation of rab7 activity differentially modulate the kinetics of radiolabeled EGF degradation. Similarly, expression of dominant negative rab7 slows the rate of EGFR degradation. Separation of endocytic vesicles from cells expressing dominant negative rab7 on an isotonic Percoll gradient reveals that cells expressing dominant negative rab7 accumulate internalized radiolabeled EGF in more dense endosomes. From these findings, we conclude that functional rab7 is required for the degradation of the EGF·EGFR complex by the lysosome. Cell Culture—tTA-HeLa cells (HeLa cells stably transfected with the tetracycline transactivator (tTA)) were a gift of Dr. Sandra Schmid (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential media (DMEM) of 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine (27Damke H. Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bujard H. Schmid S.L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 157: 209-220Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Generation and Usage of Adenoviruses—This study uses canine rab7 constructs that are 99% homologous to the human rab7 protein (Gen-Bank®). Constitutively active rab7, denoted rab7(Q67L) refers to rab7 with a glutamine to leucine mutation at amino acid 67 and has been documented extensively elsewhere (22Feng Y. Press B. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1435-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 23Press B. Feng Y. Hoflack B. Wandinger-Ness A. J.

Cell. 2000; 11: 467-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). This mutation, in the GTPase domain of the protein, renders the GTPase inactive and maintains the protein predominantly in the GTP-bound state. Dominant negative rab7 has a point mutation of asparagine to isoleucine at amino acid 125, and is referred to as rab7(N125I); it cannot bind guanine nucleotide (22Feng Y. Press B. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1435-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 23Press B. Feng Y. Hoflack B. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1075-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Adenoviruses were generated and maintained as described previously (16Dinneen J.L. Ceresa B.P. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 294: 509-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 17Dineen J.L. Ceresa B.P. Traffic. 2004; 5: 606-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Adenoviruses were cesium chloride purified and concentrated to minimize any potential effects of cytosol or media from the HEK293 cells in which they were amplified. Adenoviruses were subjected to sequence analysis at the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation DNA Sequencing facility. For adenoviral expression experiments, subconfluent dishes of tTA-HeLa cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 20 plaque forming units/cell for 2 h in serum-free DMEM at 37 °C in 5% CO2, followed by the indicated length of incubation in growth media. Mock infected cells were incubated with virus in the presence of 1 μg/ml tetracycline during infection and recovery. For all experiments, recombinant protein expression from adenoviruses was verified by immunoblotting and/or indirect immunofluorescence with a dish of cells treated in parallel. Cell Lysate Preparation and Immunoblotting—Cell lysates were generated by washing the cells twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and solubilizing cells in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) on ice. Proteins were solubilized by rotating the lysis buffer:cell mixture end over end for 10 min at 4 °C; insoluble material was removed by microcentrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration of the solubilized protein was assessed by BCA assay (Pierce), and samples were diluted in SDS sample buffer. Equivalent amounts of protein were separated by the indicated percentage using SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, detected using monoclonal antibodies against the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (12CA5) (Roche), LAMP-1 (BD Transduction Laboratories, San Jose, CA), EEA1 (BD Transduction Laboratories), or a rabbit polyclonal antibody against EGFR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), rab7 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by probing with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Detected proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) and either film or the UV Products Imaging system. Relative intensity of the immunoreactive protein bands was determined by scanning multiple film exposures of the same immunoblot from the same experiment to ensure the signal was in the linear range. Densitometric analysis was performed using Image J software (NIH). LysoTracker and Indirect Immunofluorescence—To visualize the presence of acidic lysosomes, infected cells were incubated with 50 nm LysoTracker DND-99 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in serum-free DMEM for 30 min at 37 °C. LysoTracker DND-99 is a fluorescent dye that accumulates in acidic compartments, but the fluorescent intensity does not change in response to pH. Cells were fixed in a 4% p-formaldehyde:PBS2+ (PBS, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2) solution at room temperature for 5 min and on ice for 15 min. Excess formaldehyde was removed with three 5-min washes in PBS2+. Cells were then permeabilized for 20 min in 0.1% saponin, 5% fetal bovine serum:PBS2+, and washed 3× 5 min using PBS2+. After washing, cells were incubated for 1 h with the indicated antibody. The EGFR was detected with a mouse monoclonal antibody (α-EGFR Ab-5, Oncogene Research Products, La Jolla, CA). HA-tagged rab7 constructs were detected using the anti-HA 12CA5 mouse monoclonal antibody (Roche). Unbound primary antibody was removed with 3× 5-min washes in PBS2+ and cells were incubated 1 h with an Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). After six 10-min washes with PBS2+, coverslips were rinsed in Millipore water and mounted on a slide with Prolong Antifade (Molecular Probes). Confocal images were collected at the Warren Medical Research Institute Flow and Image Cytometry Laboratory (on the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center Campus) using a Leica TCS NT microscope and analyzed using the Leica TCS NT software (Wetzlar, Germany). Fluorescent images were collected using a Nikon Eclipse TE-2000-U microscope and processed using OpenLab Imaging Software. Pixel intensities of individual endosomes were quantified using Image J software (NIH). 125I-EGF Degradation and Secretion—Cells were incubated for 7.5 min with 125I-EGF (1 ng/ml) at 37 °C in binding buffer (DMEM, 20 mm HEPES, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.3). Cells were washed four times in ice with ice-cold PBS to remove external, unbound 125I-EGF. Pre-warmed, 37 °C media was added to the cells and they were returned to 37 °C for the indicated periods of time. At each time point, the media was collected. The remaining cells were solubilized in 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Cell lysates were incubated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and 1% BSA as a carrier protein on ice for 1 h. Intact protein was separated from degraded by centrifugation for 15 min at 14,000 × g in an Ependorf microcentrifuge at 4 °C. The radioactivity for all three fractions (secreted, intact, and degraded) was determined by calculating each fraction in a Beckman γ-counter (28Sorkin A.D. Teskenko L.V. Nikolsky N.N. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 192-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Monensin (100 μm) was used as a control to block 125I-EGF degradation (29King A.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 124: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). 125I-EGF Percoll Gradients—Analysis of radioligand distribution was performed as described by Kornilova et al. (30Kornilova E. Sorkina T. Beguinot L. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30340-30346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated for 15 min with 125I-EGF (1 ng/ml) at 37 °C in binding buffer. Cells were washed four times with PBS, and returned to 37 °C in growth media. After 45 more minutes (60 min total), cells were washed twice with TES (10 mm triethanolamine, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 m sucrose, pH 7.2) and harvested in 2 ml of TES. Lysates were pipetted up and down 40 times. Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 200 × g in a Sorvall JA25.5 rotor. The supernatant was transferred to a clean tube and the pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of TES, and centrifuged again. The resulting 4 ml of post-nuclear supernatant was diluted with a 90% Percoll solution (in 0.25 m sucrose, pH 7.2) to 17% in TES in 11.5 ml. Samples were centrifuged for 25 min at 4 °C at 50,000 × g in a Beckman Ti65 rotor and fractionated into 10 drop fractions (∼350 μl/fraction) from the bottom and assayed for radioactivity in a Beckman γ-counter. Data were plotted at the percentage of total radioactivity in each tube versus the relative migration of each fraction in the sample. For each experiment, a parallel tube of TES, 17% Percoll containing density marker beads (Amersham Bioscience) was run to monitor relative density. After the amount of radioactivity in each fraction was determined, samples were solubilized in SDS sample buffer, heated for 3 min at 100 °C, and centrifuged to remove the silica. Every other fraction (150 μl) was resolved by 7.5 or 12% SDS-PAGE. After transfer to nitrocellulose, the resulting membrane was blotted with LAMP1 (lysosome) and EEA1 (early endosome). Functional Expression of Dominant Negative and Constitutively Active Mutants of rab7—To determine the effect of rab7 activity on EGFR endocytic trafficking, we generated tetracycline-regulatable adenoviruses that express amino-terminal HA-tagged mutants of rab7. HA-rab7(N125I) has a mutation of asparagine to isoleucine at amino acid 125, rendering the small molecular weight G-protein unable to bind guanine nucleotide. Overexpression of HA-rab7(N125I) has been shown to inhibit endogenous rab7 function (22Feng Y. Press B. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1435-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 23Press B. Feng Y. Hoflack B. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1075-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). A constitutively active form of rab7 was generated by substitution of glutamate with leucine at amino acid 67 (HA-rab7(Q67L)). This mutation inactivates the endogenous GTPase activity of the protein, causing the protein to stay in the GTP bound form (25Bucci C. Thomsen P. Nicozizni P. McCarthy J. van Deurs B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 467-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Adenoviruses were expressed in HeLa cells because they contain a physiological number of EGFRs and the EGFR endocytic trafficking has been well characterized (11Huang F. Khvorova A. Marshall W. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16657-16661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 13Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 16Dinneen J.L. Ceresa B.P. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 294: 509-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The tetracycline regulation of the adenoviruses require the co-expression of the tTA and these studies utilized HeLa cells stably transfected with the tTA (tTA-HeLa) (27Damke H. Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bujard H. Schmid S.L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 157: 209-220Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The use of the tetracycline-regulatable adenoviral expression system in the tTA-HeLa cells has been an effective tool in the study of proteins involved in endocytic trafficking (16Dinneen J.L. Ceresa B.P. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 294: 509-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 17Dineen J.L. Ceresa B.P. Traffic. 2004; 5: 606-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 31Fish K.N. Schmid S.L. Damke H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 32Newmeyer S.L. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These adenoviruses are able to infect a high percentage of cells (>95%, see Fig. 3C) and protein expression can be attenuated by the addition of tetracycline. The transient nature of infection helps circumvent any deleterious effects that prolonged expression of the exogenous protein may have on the cell. Furthermore, because the infection in the presence of tetracycline inhibits protein expression, any unintended effects from the viral infection are readily distinguished. Cell lysates were prepared from infected cells, resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted using antibodies against either rab7 (Fig. 1A, upper panel) or the HA-epitope (12CA5, Fig. 1A, lower panel). We estimate that the level of exogenous rab7 expression is ∼10-20-fold of endogenous rab7, based on densitometric scans of multiple gels. Adenovirally infected HA-rab7(N125I) migrates faster than HA-rab7(Q67L) on SDS-PAGE. Whereas the biochemical cause of this altered migration is not known, this observation is consistent with what has been reported in baby hamster kidney cells stably transfected with rab7(N125I) (23Press B. Feng Y. Hoflack B. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1075-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). When cells are infected in the presence of tetracycline, mutant rab7 expression is completely abrogated. Under these infection conditions, greater than 95% of cells are infected (see Fig. 3C for representative infection). For all experiments, parallel dishes of cells were infected with the same amount of adenovirus (either HA-rab7(N125I) or HA-rab7(Q67L)) in the presence of 1 μg/ml tetracycline, to control for adenoviral effects and are noted as “mock” infected in subsequent figures. To determine whether each rab7 mutant was functioning as previously reported, we examined the ability of the infected cells to form acidic vesicles in the presence of exogenous rab7. After infection with the indicated adenovirus or mock infection, cells were allowed to recover overnight. The next day, cells were incubated with LysoTracker DND-99 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), a fluorescent, but pH-insensitive dye that selectively accumulates in acidic lysosomes. Cells were fixed, processed for indirect immunofluorescence using the 12CA5 antibody that selectively recognizes the HA-tagged exogenous rab7, and examined under a confocal microscope for the presence of Lyso-Tracker-labeled acidic lysosomes (Fig. 1, red) and the relative distribution of the exogenous rab7. In Fig. 1B, acidic vesicles are observed under all three infection conditions (rab7(N125I), rab7(Q67L), and mock infected). However, the acidic vesicles seen in the rab7(Q67L) expressing cells were brighter and larger in size. These data are consistent with what others have reported using these rab7 mutants and are consistent with our expression system generating the expected consequences on acidic vesicles (21Dale L.B. Seachrist J.L. Babwah A.V. Ferguson S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13110-13118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To determine the optimal time frame to examine the effect of rab7 activity on EGFR trafficking, we collected cell lysates from HeLa cells at 24-h intervals post-infection. These lysates were separated on a 12% gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with antibodies against the HA epitope (12CA5). HeLa cells robustly expressed rab7(Q67L) at levels that did not significantly change over the 24-72-h time course examined (Fig. 2A). However, cells infected with HA-rab7(N125I) expressed the mutant protein at the 24-h time point, but the levels trailed off dramatically at later time points. Thus, our subsequent analysis of EGFR trafficking used cells that had been infected within 18-24 h. rab7 Mutants Do Not Affect EGFR Expression, Localization, or Ligand-stimulated Endocytosis—Prior to examining the role of rab7 on EGFR endocytic trafficking, it was important to first determine whether rab7 activity had any effect on the steady-state distribution and expression levels of the EGFR. The localization of the unliganded EGFR, like many proteins, is dynamic. In resting cells, the vast majority of EGFRs reside at the plasma membrane, however, there is a small percentage of receptors that continually shuttle to and from the plasma membrane (33Herbst J.J. Opresko L.K. Walsh B.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12865-12873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Past studies have shown that continual expression of activated mutant of the small molecular weight G-protein rab5 causes the redistribution of the EGFR into endocytic vesicles and subsequent degradation in the absence of ligand stimulation (17Dineen J.L. Ceresa B.P. Traffic. 2004; 5: 606-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To determine whether our rab7 mutants could elicit similar effects, we examined both the steady-state levels of total cellular EGFR and its cellular distribution. Cell lysates from rab7-infec"

Additionally, the 10-kDa PsbR protein has been found in plant PSII and anticipated to play a role in water oxidation, yet the physiological significance of PsbR has remained obscure. Using the Arabidopsis psbR mutant, we showed that the light-saturated rate of oxygen evolution is strongly reduced in the absence of PsbR, particularly in low light-grown plants. Lack of PsbR also induced a reduction in the content of both the PsbP and the PsbQ proteins, and a near depletion of these proteins was observed under steady state low light conditions. This regulation occurred post-transcriptionally and likely involves a proteolytic degradation of the PsbP and PsbQ proteins in the absence of an assembly partner, proposed to be the PsbR protein. Stable assembly of PsbR in the PSII core complex was, in turn, shown to require a chloroplast-encoded intrinsic low molecular mass PSII subunit PsbJ. Our results provided evidence that PsbR is an important link in the PSII core complex for stable assembly of the oxygen-evolving complex protein PsbP, whereas the effects on the assembly of PsbQ are probably indirect.

Photosystem II (PSII) 2The abbreviations used are: PSIIphotosystem IIPSIphotosystem IChlchlorophyllLHClight-harvesting complexLMMlow molecular massOECoxygen-evolving complexWTwild typeLLlow lightHLhigh lightGLgrowth light. is a supramolecular pigment-protein complex embedded in the thylakoid membrane. It catalyzes light-induced electron transfer from water to plastoquinone, with concomitant evolution of oxygen occurring on the luminal side of PSII. The oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of eukaryotic PSII is composed of three extrinsic nuclear-encoded subunits, PsbO (33 kDa), PsbP (23 kDa), and PsbQ (17 kDa), which protect the CaMn4 cluster bound to D1 and CP43 proteins (1Ferreira K.N. Iverson T. Maghlaoui K. Barber J. Iwata S. Science. 2004; 303: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (2872) Google Scholar). Cyanobacterial OEC, on the other hand, is composed of the PsbO protein, together with PsbU and PsbV (the cytochrome c550) (2Seidler A. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 2004; 44: 805-815Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The PsbQ homolog was found to be present as one molecule for each cyanobacterial PSII core, whereas the PsbP homolog was suggested to be present only in substoichiometric amounts (5Thornton L.E. Ohkawa H. Roose J.L. Kashino Y. Keren N. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2164-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it was recently found that in total membrane preparations and in whole cell extracts, the PsbP homolog is present in amounts comparable with other PSII proteins, suggesting that the protein becomes depleted by detergents used during the isolation of PSII complexes (7Ishikawa Y. Schröder W.P. Funk C. Photosynth. Res. 2005; 84: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) Moreover, it has been reported that the 20-kDa extrinsic protein, which belongs to the OEC proteins of red algae, shows sequence similarity with the PsbQ protein of green algae and higher plants as well as with the PsbQ homolog of cyanobacteria, and it was proposed that the red algae 20-kDa protein is an ancestral form of the PsbQ protein (8Ohta H. Suzuki T. Ueno M. Okumura A. Yoshihara S. Shen J.-R. Enami I. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4156-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The assembly process of the 33-kDa PsbO protein to the luminal side of the PSII core complex has been reported to take place in stroma-exposed thylakoid membranes of higher plants (9Hashimoto A. Ettinger W.F. Yamamoto Y. Theg S.M. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 441-452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Structural studies have revealed that the luminal loops of the PSII core proteins D2 and CP47 are essential for docking the PsbO protein (10Nield J. Orlova E. Morris E. Gowen V. van Heel M. Barber J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 44-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and the presence of CP43 is also necessary since no stable assembly of the PsbO protein was found in the PSII monomer lacking CP43 (11Suorsa M. Regel R.E. Paakkarinen V. Battchikova N. Herrmann R.G. Aro E.-M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 96-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The 23- and 17-kDa OEC proteins PsbP and PsbQ have been found to associate with PSII only in the grana thylakoids (9Hashimoto A. Ettinger W.F. Yamamoto Y. Theg S.M. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 441-452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the low molecular mass (LMM) PSII core protein PsbJ was recently reported to be a prerequisite for the association of PsbP with the PSII core (11Suorsa M. Regel R.E. Paakkarinen V.

It has been suggested that PsbO provides a docking site for PsbP, and both PsbO and PsbP together are needed for the binding of PsbQ (13Andersson B. Larsson C. Jansson C. Ljungberg U. Åkerlund H.-E.

Unlike in higher plants, the PsbP and PsbQ homologs in cyanobacteria contain a lipid moiety in their N terminus, which probably anchors these proteins to the thylakoid membrane (5Thornton L.E.

Besides the OEC proteins, the PSII core complex in higher plants and cyanobacteria also differs with respect to the necessity of several intrinsic LMM proteins to the function and assembly of the complex (15Baena-Gonzalez E.

Acta. 2004; 1608: 75-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). PsbJ is a representative example of such proteins. In cyanobacteria, the deletion of PsbJ allows slow photoautotrophic growth, whereas in tobacco plants, the corresponding deletion leads to a complete heterotrophy (11Suorsa M. Regel R.E.

Moreover, higher plant PSII contains the nuclear-encoded LMM subunits PsbW and PsbR, which are completely lacking from cyanobacterial PSII. The functional role and properties of PsbR, also known as the 10-kDa PSII polypeptide, have remained poorly characterized. It has been proposed that PsbR is located on the luminal side of PSII and is involved in binding the OEC proteins (20Ljungberg U. Åkerlund H.-E. Andersson B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 158: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), although no direct in vivo experimental proof is available. Here we have characterized the Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion mutant psbR and demonstrated the requirement of the PsbR protein for stable association of the OEC subunit PsbP with the PSII core. Plant Material and Growth Conditions—Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia T-DNA insertion mutant (SALK_114469) was obtained from the Salk collection (the Salk Institute Genomic Analysis Laboratory) (21Alonso J.M. Stepanova A.N. Leisse T.J. Kim C.J. Chen H. Shinn P. Stevenson D.K. Zimmerman J. Barajas P. Cheuk R. Gadrinab C. Heller C. Jeske A. Koesema E. Meyers C.C. Parker H. Prednis L. Ansari Y. Choy N.

Three plants were obtained lacking the PsbR protein, as analyzed by Western blotting. Furthermore, PCR analysis of these three plants and the wild type (WT) (ecotype Columbia) with primers specific to the flanking sequences of both the left (LP, 5′-ACCGGATCTTCTCTCCCTCGT-3′) and the right (RP, 5′-TCTTGTGCATGGAAATCATAAAGGA-3′) sides of the PsbR gene together with a primer inside the T-DNA insert (LB, 5′-TGGTTCACGTAGTGGGCCATCG-3′) confirmed the three plants to be homozygous mutants. PCR amplification of homozygous psbR mutant DNA resulted in a 780-bp product, whereas amplification of the WT DNA with the same primers produced a 960-bp fragment. Both psbR and WT plants were grown in a growth chamber under a photon flux density of 125 μmol of photons m–2 s–1 in 8-h light/16-h dark cycles at a temperature of 25 °C. For some experiments, plants were also grown under very low (15 μmol of photons m–2 s–1), low (50–60 μmol of photons m–2 s–1), and high (450 μmol of photons m–2 s–1) light. Fully grown rosettes were used for studies. For short-time regulation studies, WT plants were, after turning the lights on, first kept under growth light for 2 h and then exposed for 5 h to darkness, very low light (15 μmol of photons m–2 s–1), growth light (125 μmol of photons m–2 s–1), and high light (450 or 750 μmol of photons m–2 s–1). The details of transformation, selection, and growth of the tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) psbEFLJ operon mutants were described earlier (11Suorsa M. Regel R.E. Paakkarinen V. Battchikova N.

WT and “RV” (which has an aadA gene cassette in a neutral EcoRV site in the 3′-untranslated region of the operon) plants, grown under the same conditions as the mutants, were used as controls. Northern Blotting—Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to Tri reagent total RNA isolation protocol (Sigma), and Northern blotting was performed with standard techniques (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.37-7.42Google Scholar). Isolation of Thylakoid Membranes—Leaves were briefly homogenized with a blender in 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 330 mm sorbitol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 5mm ascorbate, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, and 10 mm NaF, filtered through Miracloth, and centrifuged for 4 min, 2500 × g, and at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm sorbitol, 10 mm NaF and centrifuged for 4 min at 2500 × g, 4 °C. The thylakoid pellet was resuspended in 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, with 100 mm sorbitol, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm NaF, centrifuged for 3 min at 2500 × g, 4 °C, and finally resuspended in the same buffer. Chlorophyll (Chl) was extracted in 80% (v/v) buffered acetone (2.5 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5) and quantified as described (23Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4743) Google Scholar). Protein Analysis—Proteins were separated in SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide, 6 m urea) (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, proteins were electroblotted to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore). Western blotting with chemiluminescence detection was performed with standard techniques using protein-specific antibodies or an antibody raised against the PSI complex. The PsbR antibody was produced against synthetic peptides (Eurogentec). Antibodies against the Lhcb and Lhca proteins were purchased from Agrisera, and the phosphothreonine antibody was from New England Biolabs. 0.5 μg of Chl was loaded, except for the detection of Lhca and Lhcb subunits (0.3 μg), PsbQ (2 μg), and the phosphothreonine antibody (1 μg). These amounts of protein have been tested in our laboratory to give a linear immunoresponse with respective antibodies. Immunoblots were quantified with FluorChem Image Analyzer (Alpha Innotech Corp.). Blue native gel electrophoresis was performed as described earlier (25Rokka A. Suorsa M. Saleem A. Battchikova N. Aro E.-M. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Functional Measurements—Light-saturated steady state rates of oxygen evolution were measured at 25 °C with Hansatech DW1 O2 electrode using 1 mm 2,6-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone as an artificial electron acceptor. Isolated thylakoid membranes were suspended in 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.0), 15 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 400 mm sucrose at a Chl concentration of 10 μg ml–1. PSII excitation pressure (1-qP) was measured with a PAM fluorometer (PAM 101/103, Heinz Walz) according to Ref. 26Pursiheimo S. Mulo P. Rintamäki E. Aro E.-M. Plant J. 2001; 26: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, and the PSII efficiency was measured as a ratio of variable to maximal fluorescence (Fv/Fmax), detected from intact leaves with a Hansatech Plant Efficiency Analyzer fluorometer (King's Lynn, UK) after dark incubation of 30 min. Room temperature EPR was measured with a Bruker ELEXSYS E500 spectrometer equipped with a standard Bruker 4102 cavity as described (27Danielsson R. Albertsson P.-Å. Mamedov F. Styring S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1608: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The relative amount of photosystem I (PSI) in the thylakoid membrane was estimated from the intensity of non-saturated EPR spectra from chemically oxidized P700+. The relative amount of PSII was estimated from the intensity of non-saturated EPR spectra from the dark stable radical form Y·D (tyrosine 161 on the D2 protein). The intensities of the YD and P700+ were determined by double integration of the spectra. We have characterized the T-DNA insertion mutant line SALK_114469, having an insert located in the third exon of the PsbR gene (At1g79040). psbR mutant plants showed no phenotype when grown under normal light conditions (125 μmol of photons m–2 s–1), under high light (450 μmol of photons m–2 s–1), or low light (15 or 50 μmol of photons m–2 s–1). The Chl a/b ratio was slightly lower in the mutant thylakoids as compared with WT (Table 1), although no statistically significant difference could be detected.TABLE 1Chlorophyll (Chl) a/b ratio, rate of oxygen evolution and the PSII excitation pressure (1-qP) of the psbR and WT plantsWTpsbRChl a/b3.15 ± 0.133.08 ± 0.13O2 evolution (μmol O2/mg Chl h-1) GL313 ± 8.9216 ± 11.2 (69%) LL216 ± 12.4126 ± 8.3 (54%) PSII excitation pressure0.065 ± 0.0090.147 ± 0.020 Open table in a new tab Functional Properties of PSII in the Absence of the PsbR Protein—The steady state oxygen evolution was markedly lower in the thylakoids of the psbR mutant as compared with WT. 30% reduction was measured for psbR plants grown under standard growth light conditions, and over 50% reduction was measured under low light conditions (Table 1). PSII photochemical efficiency, deduced from the Fv/Fmax measurements, was, however, not compromised in the absence of PsbR. Moreover, the lack of PsbR did not make plants more susceptible to donor site photoinhibition (28Aro E.-M. Virgin I. Andersson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 113-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar) during high light illumination of the leaves (data not shown). On the other hand, the psbR mutant exhibited over 2-fold higher PSII excitation pressure as compared with WT plants (Table 1). Such defects in the electron transfer chain were reflected as reduced steady state phosphorylation of both the PSII core and the LHCII phosphoproteins as compared with WT (Fig. 1A). PSI/PSII Ratio in the psbR Mutant and WT Plants—By using room temperature EPR measurements of the dark stable YD· radical and the P700+ radical, recorded from the ferricyanide-oxidized samples, we obtained the values of 0.71 and 1.01 for the PSI/PSII ratios in WT and psbR thylakoids, respectively (Fig. 1B). This clearly indicates that the WT thylakoids in our growth conditions (125 μmol of photons m–2 s–1) had fewer PSI centers than PSII centers, whereas in the psbR mutants, the amounts of PSI and PSII centers were nearly equal. On the basis of measurements of Y·D, we found that the amount of PSII (on a Chl basis) in the psbR mutant was 72% of that in WT, whereas the amount of PSI was quite unaffected by the mutation. Protein Composition of the psbR Mutant and WT Thylakoid Membranes—As expected, the T-DNA insert in the PsbR gene resulted in a complete loss of the PsbR protein, determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 2A). Of the OEC proteins, PsbO was present in near equal amounts in the psbR mutant and in the WT thylakoids, whereas the amounts of PsbP and PsbQ were drastically reduced in the psbR mutant, PsbP being only 37 ± 3% (mean ± S.D., n = 3) of that in the WT plants (Fig. 2A). As to the PSII core proteins, the amount of D1 in the psbR mutant was slightly lowered (78 ± 5%, n = 3) as was also true of the other tested PSII core protein, the internal antenna protein CP43 (Fig. 2B). The amounts of the LHCII antenna proteins Lhcb1, Lhcb5 (CP26), and Lhcb4 (CP29) (data not shown) were similar in psbR and the WT thylakoid membranes (Fig. 2B). Opposite to PSII core proteins, the amounts of the PSI reaction center heterodimer PsaA/B and α/β subunits of CF1 were higher (113 ± 8%, n = 3 and 136 ± 10%, n = 3, respectively) in psbR (Fig. 2B), whereas no distinct differences were observed in the amounts of LHCI antenna proteins Lhca1, Lhca2, Lhca3, or Lhca4 between the mutant and WT plants (not shown). The cytochrome b6 f complex seemed to be unaffected by the lack of PsbR, deduced from the equal presence of the cytochrome f subunit (Fig. 2B). It was also tested by blue native gel electrophoresis that the oligomeric structures of the membrane protein complexes in psbR thylakoids were not altered (data not shown). Expression of the OEC Proteins and the PsbR Protein in Mutant and WT Plants Grown under Low Light Intensity—When WT and the psbR mutant plants were grown under low light (50 μmol of photons m–2 s–1), extremely low amounts of both the PsbP and the PsbQ proteins were present in the psbR mutant as compared with WT, PsbP being only 6 ± 2% (n = 3) and PsbQ 31 ± 8% (n = 3) of that in WT plants as determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 3A). Similar low amounts of PsbP and PsbQ were evident from Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gels of WT and psbR thylakoid proteins (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, the PsbO protein was present in equal amounts in the psbR mutant and WT, independently of the growth light conditions (Fig. 3A). When WT plants grown under medium light (125 μmol of photons m–2 s–1) and low light (50 μmol of photons m–2 s–1) conditions were compared, it was observed that the amounts of the OEC proteins PsbP and PsbQ were much higher in the thylakoids from low light-grown plants (Fig. 3A). Also, the amount of the PsbR protein was somewhat higher in low light-grown than in control light-grown WT plants, although not as much increased as the PsbP and PsbQ proteins. No low light-induced increase was detected for the PsbO protein (Fig. 3A). Because drastic differences were found in the amounts of the OEC proteins PsbP and PsbQ between the psbR mutant and the WT, we next investigated whether the regulation takes place at the level of transcription. Northern blots revealed that PsbP2 and PsbQ2 as well as PsbO1 transcripts were present in both the WT and the psbR mutant plants in more or less equal amounts (Fig. 3C). Moreover, albeit clear increases at the protein level were observed in WT plants grown under low light, the amounts of PsbP and PsbQ mRNAs in low light- and growth light-grown plants were nearly equal. Short Term Light Regulation of the OEC Proteins and the PsbR Protein—Short term light regulation of genes encoding the OEC proteins and PsbR was also tested by exposing WT plants for 5 h to darkness, low light (LL) (here 15 μmol of photons m–2 s–1), two different intensities of high light (HL), 450 μmol of photons m–2 s–1 and 750 μmol of photons m–2s–1, and as a control, growth light (125 μmol of photons m–2 s–1). As shown in Fig. 4A, the PsbR transcripts were clearly up-regulated in LL as compared with growth light (GL). The same trend was detected for the expression of PsbP and, to a lesser extent, also for PsbO and PsbQ. Moreover, a slight decrease occurred in these mRNAs at high light, especially for intensities ≥450 μmol of photons m–2 s–1 (Fig. 4A). For comparison, the amounts of the psbA transcripts were recorded under similar conditions, and contrary to the OEC transcripts, a slight up-regulation under high light was detected for the psbA mRNA. In parallel with mRNA studies, we addressed the possible protein changes of PsbR after the 5-h exposure of plants to different light quantities. PsbR protein contents of the WT plants treated for 5 h at different light conditions were more stable than the respective transcripts. Nevertheless, a decrease in the PsbR protein content was observed after exposing the plants to high light for 5 h (Fig. 4B), being 82 ± 7% and 70 ± 5% of the control light values after the 5 h of treatment at 450 and 750 μmol of photons m–2 s–1, respectively. No decrease in the quantity of the D1 protein occurred during the 5-h treatment of plants under elevated irradiances (Fig. 4B). Occurrence of the PsbR Protein in psbEFLJ Operon Mutants of Tobacco—To gain insights into the interaction of PsbR with the PSII core proteins, we tested the presence of PsbR in the thylakoid membranes of tobacco psbEFLJ operon mutants (11Suorsa M.

Pakrasi H.B. Ohad I. Herrmann R.G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2003; 268: 699-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). PsbR was missing from the thylakoids of the ΔpsbE and ΔpsbF mutants (Fig. 5), which do not show assembly of PSII core complexes (11Suorsa M. Regel R.E. Paakkarinen V. Battchikova N. Herrmann R.G. Aro E.-M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 96-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In the absence of PsbL, only a small amount of the PsbR protein was accumulated in the thylakoid membranes, corresponding to the contents of the D1 protein and the amount of assembled PSII complexes in this mutant. This straightforward comparison between the D1 protein and assembled PSII core complexes is possible because the D1 protein was never detected as a free protein in the thylakoid membrane. Thylakoids of the ΔpsbJ mutant, on the contrary, completely missed the PsbR protein, whereas these thylakoids have high amounts of assembled PSII complexes, although inactive in oxygen evolution (11Suorsa M. Regel R.E. Paakkarinen V. Battchikova N. Herrmann R.G. Aro E.-M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 96-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the OEC protein PsbP was also completely missing from the ΔpsbJ thylakoids, whereas PsbO was present in amounts comparable with those in WT thylakoids. Moreover, although the ΔpsbL mutant had only traces of assembled PSII centers, we also found traces of PsbP protein in ΔpsbL thylakoids (Fig. 5). An immunoblot of the D1 protein is included in Fig. 5 to indicate the overall contents of the PSII complexes in psbEFLJ mutants (Fig. 5) (for details, see Ref. 11Suorsa M. Regel R.E. Paakkarinen V. Battchikova N. Herrmann R.G. Aro E.-M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 96-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). PsbR has long been regarded as a “mystery” subunit of PSII implicated to reside on the luminal side of PSII in a close association with the OEC proteins. Since the PsbR gene is missing from cyanobacterial genomes, the high resolution structures of PSII complexes have not been helpful in elucidation of the location and the functional roles of PsbR in the PSII complex. As we have shown here, the absence of PsbR clearly diminishes the oxygen evolution capacity of thylakoid membranes, indicating that PsbR is essential for optimization of photosynthetic water splitting and electron transfer in PSII. Based on the high PSII excitation pressure, which is an indicator of a high redox state of QA, together with a low phosphorylation state of both the PSII core and the LHCII proteins in the psbR mutant, it can be deduced that the electron transfer from PSII to the plastoquinone pool is hampered in the psbR mutant. Moreover, the higher PSI/PSII ratio in psbR is likely to keep the plastoquinone pool more oxidized than in WT under the steady state growth conditions. The PsbR Protein Enables the Stable Assembly of the OEC Protein PsbP to the PSII Core—Among plants grown under low light intensity (50 μmol of photons m–2 s–1), the psbR mutant showed a near complete loss of the OEC protein PsbP and extremely low amounts of PsbQ. Under moderate growth light (125 μmol of photons m–2 s–1), the PsbP and PsbQ proteins were clearly observable yet in much smaller quantities as compared with WT thylakoids. It is thus conceivable that in higher plants, the PsbR protein is a prerequisite for a stable assembly of these two OEC proteins. The exact location of PsbR in the PSII core is not known, and it remains to be investigated whether PsbR offers a direct docking site for PsbP (and probably PsbP, in turn, for PsbQ, see below) or whether PsbR only fine-tunes the structure of PSII on the luminal side, making the association of PsbP and PsbQ more feasible. Cyanobacteria lack the PsbR protein and also the proper PsbP and PsbQ proteins. However, homologs of PsbP and PsbQ are found in cyan"

https://openalex.org/W2075744025,"We have investigated the signaling of OX1 receptors to cell death using Chinese hamster ovary cells as a model system. OX1 receptor stimulation with orexin-A caused a delayed cell death independently of cytosolic Ca2+ elevation. The classical mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, ERK and p38, were strongly activated by orexin-A. p38 was essential for induction of cell death, whereas the ERK pathway appeared protective. A pathway often implicated in the p38-mediated cell death, activation of p53, did not mediate the cell death, as there was no stabilization of p53 or increase in p53-dependent transcriptional activity, and dominant-negative p53 constructs did not inhibit cell demise. Under basal conditions, orexin-A-induced cell death was associated with compact chromatin condensation and it required de novo gene transcription and protein synthesis, the classical hallmarks of programmed (apoptotic) cell death. However, though the pan-caspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-(O-methyl)fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD-fmk) fully inhibited the caspase activity, it did not rescue the cells from orexin-A-induced death. In the presence of Z-VAD-fmk, orexin-A-induced cell death was still dependent on p38 and de novo protein synthesis, but it no longer required gene transcription. Thus, caspase inhibition causes activation of alternative, gene transcription-independent death pathway. In summary, the present study points out mechanisms for orexin receptor-mediated cell death and adds to our general understanding of the role of G-protein-coupled receptor signaling in cell death by suggesting a pathway from G-protein-coupled receptors to cell death via p38 mitogen-/stress-activated protein kinase independent of p53 and caspase activation.

However, the mechanisms of GPCR signaling in these processes are poorly characterized. The pathways engaged seem to include classical GPCR signals like second messenger-dependent activation of protein kinase A and C but also (for GPCRs) more novel signal transducers like small G-proteins (of Ras and Rho families), PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) and non-receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g. Src).

In this study we have focused on the signaling of a novel GPCR, OX1 orexin receptor. Little is known about the intracellular signaling of OX1 receptor and its cognate receptor, OX2 receptor. Orexin receptor-expressing neuronal, endocrine, and muscle cells often seem to be excited by orexins, an effect that may be related to activation of Ca2+ or non-selective cation channels (reviewed in Refs. 4Kukkonen J.P.

Hypocretins as Integrators of Physiological Signals. Springer Science and Business Media, Berlin2005: 221-231Google Scholar). Recently, orexin receptors have been suggested to regulate cell plasticity. ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) is strongly activated in CHO cells heterologously expressing OX1 receptors (4Kukkonen J.P. Holmqvist T. Ammoun S. Åkerman K.E. Am. J.

Long lasting activation of OX1 receptors leads to cell death in native transformed colon cancer and neuroblastoma cell lines and in recombinant immortal CHO cells (9Rouet-Benzineb P. Rouyer-Fessard C. Jarry A. Avondo V. Pouzet C. Yanagisawa M. Laboisse C. Laburthe M. Voisin T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45875-45886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, the signal pathways leading to this response are unclear except for an apparent involvement of caspases in the demise of colon cancer cell lines. We have therefore in this study investigated the mechanistic basis of the OX1 receptor-mediated cell death in CHO cells. The results demonstrate that stimulation of OX1 receptors with orexin-A induces activation of p38 mitogen-/stress-activated kinase(s) (MAP-/SAP-kinase(s)), which in its turn projects to delayed death of CHO cells via caspase-dependent and -independent pathways. The findings are important for our understanding of how GPCRs can take part in the control of cell fate determination in normal and transformed tissue. Cell Culture—CHO-OX1 cells, expressing human OX1 receptors, have been described before (10Lund P.E. Shariatmadari R. Uustare A. Detheux M. Parmentier M. Kukkonen J.P. Åkerman K.E.O J. Biol.

They were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin G (Sigma), 80 units/ml streptomycin (Sigma), 400 μg/ml Geneticin (G418; Invitrogen) and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in an air-ventilated humidified incubator in 260-ml plastic culture flasks (75 cm2 bottom area; Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Frickenhausen, Germany). For different assays, the cells were cultured on multiwell plates (24- or 96-well), on plastic culture dishes (inner diameter, 32, 52, or 82 mm), or on uncoated circular glass coverslips (diameter, 13 or 25 mm).

Human orexin-A was from Neosystem (Strasbourg, France), and BAPTA-AM (1,2-bis[2-aminophenoxy]ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester), fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester, and Hoechst 33352 were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Anisomycin, SB203580 (4-[4-fluorophenyl]-2-[4-methylsulfinylphenyl]-5-[4-pyridyl]-1H-imidazole), and wortmannin were from Tocris Cookson (Bristol, UK), and thapsigargin was from RBI (Natick, MA).

Courtney (A. I. Virtanen Institute, University of Kuopio, Kuopio, Finland). All the inhibitors of the signal pathways were added 30 min before orexin-A or thapsigargin. Expression Vectors—pCMV-p53-wt (mouse wild-type p53) and pCMV-p53-DD (mouse p53 lacking amino acids 15–301; Ref. 11Shaulian E. Zauberman A. Ginsberg D. Oren M. Mol. Cell.

Klas Wiman and Vladimir Bykov (Department of Oncology-Pathology, Cancer Center Karolinska, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden). pEGFP-hM1 (human muscarinic receptor C-terminally fused to GFP) was produced within the laboratory. Transfection—Transfection of the cells was performed to introduce dominant-negative p53 or different GFP-expressing plasmids to the cells. The dishes/plates were washed with PBS, and the cells were transfected in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). After 5 h, this medium was replaced with fresh Ham's F-12 medium with all the usual supplements (see above). Transfection efficiency was 40–70% as determined using expression of green fluorescent protein and function of transfected proteins (e.g. receptors and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases; data not shown). The total amount of DNA was kept the same in all the transfections using empty plasmids. Different Staining Protocols for Dead and Living Cells—Cell viability was assayed using MTT, which stains viable mitochondria blue, and morphological observation. Spectrophotometric MTT was used to assay the total number of cells alive. This method, although displaying linear a relationship between the absorbance and cell viability, cannot thus distinguish between treatments that reduce the number of cells alive by killing them or by simply inhibiting the cell growth. Therefore, spectrophotometric MTT was supplemented with manual counting of stained and non-stained cells. The data from these two methods were consistent in this study (see e.g. Fig. 1B), and the data have therefore been pooled for figures other than Fig. 1. The cells were stained with 0.5 mg/ml MTT for 1 h in the cell culture medium. For spectrophotometric MTT, the crystals formed were dissolved in 65 mm HCl in isopropyl alcohol, and the specific absorbance was measured at 570 nm (the nonspecific absorbance, to be subtracted, was measured at 690 nm; Labsystems Multiskan MS). For manual counting, the stained cells were photographed with color reversal film and the numbers of stained and non-stained cells were counted from the photographs. For nuclear staining (Figs. 1, 5, and 8), the cells were stained with 5 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 for 30 min, and the fluorescent condensed and non-condensed nuclei counted from digital images (Zeiss Axioplan 2 fluorescence microscope with a CCD camera). In some experiments the dead/dying cells were stained with 2.5 μg/ml propidium iodide (for 5–30 min), and the fluorescent cells were counted from the images (Zeiss Axioplan 2 or Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope) and compared with the total number of cells from Hoechst staining. The results with propidium iodide were in accordance with the results from MTT staining and are thus not presented.FIGURE 8OX1 receptor activation can induce both caspase-dependent and -independent cell death (72 h).

All the inhibitors were added 30 min before the addition of orexin-A or thapsigargin. When no inhibition was seen with an inhibitor, another protocol, designed to circumvent possible breakdown, was tested. In this the inhibitors, in addition to the initial dose, were added once a day in half of the original concentration. This did not improve the efficacy of any of the inhibitors. BrdUrd Incorporation for Cell Growth—The cells growing on 24-well plates were labeled with 10 μm BrdUrd for 12–16 h. The medium was discarded, and the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS, and 2 m HCl was added for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were rinsed again, blocked with PBS containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100, and stained with mouse primary anti-BrdUrd IgG (B2531 or B8434; 1:1000; Sigma). After a wash, the cells were labeled with the secondary antibody, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab′2) fragments (F2772; 1:500; Sigma). All the cells (dead and alive) were stained using Hoechst 33342 as described above. The cells were digitally photographed under fluorescence microscope, and the dividing cell (BrdUrd (fluorescein isothiocyanate)) and total cell numbers (Hoechst 33342) were manually counted from the images. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Cell Cycle—The attached cells on 82-mm plates were harvested using PBS + 0.02% (w/v) EDTA, pooled with the spontaneously detached cells (= medium from the dishes), spun down, and washed with PBS, after which they were fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol for 30 min. Ethanol was carefully washed away with PBS, and 1 mg/ml RNase was added for 5 min in room temperature before staining with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide. The intensity distribution was analyzed using standard protocols of BD Biosciences FACSCalibur instrument. A minimum of 10,000 cells was run from each sample. Western Blotting—The experiments were performed essentially as described in Refs. 7Ammoun S. Johansson L. Holmqvist T. Danis A.S. Korhonen L. Åkerman K.E. Kukkonen J.P. Mol.

Briefly, the cells, cultured on 24-mm plates, were rapidly washed with ice cold PBS supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors (1 mm Na+-orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 250 μm p-nitrophenol phosphate, leupeptin) and lysed. The protein concentration was determined (DC protein assay; Bio-Rad) and adjusted accordingly. The samples were diluted in Laemmli buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, + 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue), boiled, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to methanol-soaked polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). The membranes were blocked with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate) and 5% (w/v) milk in PBS (TPBS-milk) before probing with antisera. Primary antibody incubation was done in TPBS in +4 °C overnight and secondary antibody incubation in TPBS-milk at room temperature for 1 h after two 20-min washes with TPBS. Specific protein detection was performed using antibodies specific for phosphorylated (active) states of MAP/SAP-kinases (MAPK/SAPK) and total MAPK/SAPK and p53. The following primary antibodies were used: for active ERK1/2, rabbit polyclonal anti-pThr183-pTyr185-ERK1/2 antibody (V8031; 1:5000; Promega, Madison, WI); for total ERK, rabbit polyclonal anti-total MAPK (ERK1/2) antibody (NA 9340; 1:2000; Oncogene Research Products, San Diego, CA); for active p38 MAPK/SAPK, rabbit polyclonal anti-dually phosphorylated-p38 antibody (V1211; 1:1000; Promega); for total p38 MAPK/SAPK, rabbit polyclonal anti-total p38 antibody (#9212; 1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA); for active c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), mouse monoclonal anti-pThr183-pTyr185-JNK antibody (sc-6254; 1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); for total JNK, mouse monoclonal anti-total JNK antibody (554285; 1:1000; Pharmingen); and for p53, mouse monoclonal anti-p53 antibodies (sc-99 or sc-126; 1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Primary antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (NA9340, 1:2000; Amersham Biosciences; P0260, 1:1000; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark; or #7076, 1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology) and enhanced chemiluminescence assay (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were stripped between probing with phospho-specific and total protein antibodies. After an additional stripping, the lanes were probed for actin using rabbit anti-actin antibody (A2066, 1:2000; Sigma) and the same secondary antibody as above. The densities of the exposed films were quantified as described in Ref. 14Holmqvist T. Johansson L. Östman M. Ammoun S. Åkerman K.E. Kukkonen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6570-6579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar. Samples to be compared with each other were always run on same gels. The phospho-specific signals were correlated to the corresponding total MAPK/SAPK (Fig. 4) or actin (data not shown). p53-reporter Assay—The activity of the transcriptional activity of p53 was assayed by p53-driven expression of (enhanced) GFP. The cells were transfected with the p53-GFP plasmid and the fluorescence was assayed 48 or 72 h later (42- and 66-h orexin-A treatment, respectively) using regular or confocal fluorescence microscopy. Data Analysis—All the experiments were performed at least in triplicate and at least with three independent batches of cells; for the most experiments, the number of replicates and independent experiments was substantially higher. For cell counting, a minimum of three pictures was counted for each sample. Student's non-paired two-tailed t test was used for pairwise comparisons and analysis of variance, followed by Tukey's post-hoc test, for multiple comparisons. Significances: ns, not significant; p > 0.05; *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001. Significances are indicated only for the data where the results are not self-evident. In the figures, mean ± S.E. is given. SigmaPlot 4.1 (Jandel Scientific, Corte Madera, CA) was used for non-linear curve-fitting. OX1 Receptor Activation Induces Death of CHO Cells—To avoid complex effects from growth factors and other mediators present in serum, CHO-K1 cells, stably transfected with the OX1 orexin receptor, were prior to the exposure to other treatments serum-starved for 24 h. CHO cells were surprisingly resistant to the removal of serum as such, after 72–96 h, 94 ± 3% of the cells were alive, as indicated by the manual counting of MTT-stained and non-stained cells (see also Fig. 1A). Cell growth was markedly, but far from completely, reduced as evaluated from manual counting of cell numbers and MTT staining (data not shown). 30–40% of the serum-starved cells incorporated BrdUrd in a 12-h period. Cell cycle analysis also showed that serum-starved cells were cycling (see below). Orexin-A markedly reduced the fraction of viable cells in a concentration-(EC50 ≈ 20 nm) and time-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A and B). The response to orexin-A was the same independently of whether the cell death was evaluated using spectrophotometric measurement of MTT staining (Fig. 1B, empty symbols)ormanual counting of live and total numbers of cells (Fig. 1B, filled symbols). Thus, orexin-A indeed induced cell death and not inhibition of cell growth. This response to orexin-A was fully blocked with 10 μm OX1 receptor antagonist, SB-334867 (data not shown), confirming the involvement of OX1 receptors. A similar slow decrease in cell viability as with orexin-A was observed with thapsigargin (Fig. 1A), a compound that persistently elevates cytosolic Ca2+ and induces cell death in most cell types, probably via mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Presence of serum reversed the negative effects of both orexin-A and thapsigargin on cell viability (Fig. 1C). Nuclear staining with Hoechst 33352 revealed sharp and compact chromatin condensation, suggesting a caspase-dependent classical apoptotic mechanism of cell death (reviewed in Refs. 15Leist M. Jäättelä M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar and 16Jäättelä M. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2746-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) for both treatments (Fig. 1D). The pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (25 μm), fully inhibited chromatin condensation (Fig. 1D), confirming the engagement of caspases in this response. OX1 Receptor-mediated Cell Death Requires de Novo Gene Transcription and Protein Synthesis—The protein synthesis inhibitors anisomycin and cycloheximide concentration-dependently inhibited orexin-A-induced loss of cell viability (data not shown). A full reversal was obtained at 100 nm anisomycin or 1 μm cycloheximide, concentrations which themselves did not induce cell death (Fig. 2A). To investigate whether the orexin-A-induced cell death also required de novo synthesis of mRNA, we treated CHO cells with an inhibitor of gene transcription, actinomycin D. At the concentration of 10 nm, actinomycin D only weakly affected cell viability, but it fully reversed orexin-A-induced cell death (Fig. 2B). We thus conclude that de novo gene transcription and protein synthesis are required for the cell death induced by OX1 receptor activation under these conditions. OX1 Receptor-mediated Cell Death Occurs Independently of Ca2+ Elevation, PKC, and PI3K—Our previous studies with CHO cells have indicated that OX1 receptor stimulation induces strong Ca2+ elevation via Ca2+ influx and release (10Lund P.E.

Chelation of intracellular Ca2+ with 1 μm BAPTA-AM significantly improved cell viability in response to thapsigargin, as expected, but did not affect orexin-A-mediated cell death (Fig. 3A). Thus, orexin-A-induced cell death does not seem to be mediated by persistent Ca2+ elevation. For inhibition of PI3K and PKC we used wortmannin (100 nm), LY294002 (10 μm), and GF109203X (1 μm), which at these concentrations should be effective inhibitors of the respective enzymes in CHO cells (7Ammoun S.

The PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 and the PKC inhibitor GF109203X were without an effect (Fig. 3B), suggesting that PI3K and PKC pathways are not (centrally) involved in the cell death induced by orexin-A or thapsigargin. OX1 Receptor Induces Cell Death via the p38 MAPK/SAPK Pathway—Activation of MAPK pathways was assessed with Western blotting using antibodies specific for active (phosphorylated) MAPK species. p44/42 (ERK1/2) and p38 MAPKs were rapidly and strongly activated by orexin-A (Fig. 4, A, C, and D). In contrast to phosphorylation of p38, which was a long lasting response, the ERK response had much decayed already at 3 h to fully cease at 6–24 h (Fig. 4, A and C). CHO cells also expressed 46- and 55-kDa isoforms of JNKs. Cell stress induced by UV light or hyperosmolarity (500 mm sucrose) led to a rapid and strong phosphorylation of both distinguishable species (data not shown). However, OX1 receptor stimulation only induced a very weak phosphorylation of the 46-kDa species alone (Fig. 4, B and E). Correlation of the phosphorylated MAPK/SAPK species to actin gave qualitatively and quantitatively similar results as correlation to the respective non-phosphotylated MAPK/SAPK species (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W1994447633,"Neurotrophins, such as nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, activate Trk receptor tyrosine kinases through receptor dimerization at the cell surface followed by autophosphorylation and recruitment of intracellular signaling molecules. The intracellular pathways used by neurotrophins share many common protein substrates that are used by other receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), such as Shc, Grb2, FRS2, and phospholipase C-γ. Here we describe a novel RTK mechanism that involves a 220-kilodalton membrane tetraspanning protein, ARMS/Kidins220, which is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated in primary neurons after neurotrophin treatment. ARMS/Kidins220 undergoes multiple tyrosine phosphorylation events and also serine phosphorylation by protein kinase D. We have identified a single tyrosine (Tyr1096) phosphorylation event in ARMS/Kidins220 that plays a critical role in neurotrophin signaling. A reassembled complex of ARMS/Kidins220 and CrkL, an upstream component of the C3G-Rap1-MAP kinase cascade, is SH3-dependent. However, Tyr1096 phosphorylation enables ARMS/Kidins220 to recruit CrkL through its SH2 domain, thereby freeing the CrkL SH3 domain to engage C3G for MAP kinase activation in a neurotrophin dependent manner. Accordingly, mutation of Tyr1096 abolished CrkL interaction and sustained MAPK kinase activity, a response that is not normally observed in other RTKs. Therefore, Trk receptor signaling involves an inducible switch mechanism through an unconventional substrate that distinguishes neurotrophin action from other growth factor receptors.

Therefore, Trk receptor signaling involves an inducible switch mechanism through an unconventional substrate that distinguishes neurotrophin action from other growth factor receptors. Neurotrophins are a family of growth factors that exert their action through the Trk receptor tyrosine kinases and the p75 neurotrophic receptor (p75NTR). All neurotrophins bind to p75NTR, but nerve growth factor (NGF) 4The abbreviations used are: NGFnerve growth factorBDNFbrain-derived neurotrophic factorTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineGSTglutathione S-transferase. binds specifically to TrkA, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) bind to TrkB, and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) binds preferentially to TrkC (1Chao M.V.

Signaling mediated by neurotrophins produces several effects in the nervous system including survival of peripheral neurons during embryonic development and promotion of axonal growth and branching as well as modulation of synaptic activity (1Chao M.V. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar, 2Huang E.J. Reichardt L.F. Annu. Rev.

Like other receptor tyrosine kinases, Trk receptors are activated after ligand-induced dimerization. Upon neurotrophin binding, activated Trk receptors provide several docking sites for different adaptor proteins and enzymes. Two tyrosine residues, Tyr490 and Tyr785, are principally responsible for triggering the majority of the different intracellular signaling pathways for neurotrophins. Phosphorylation of Tyr490 site is responsible for initiating MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt activities, whereas the Tyr785 site engages phospholipase C-γ and protein kinase C activities (1Chao M.V. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar, 2Huang E.J. Reichardt L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 609-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1982) Google Scholar). These activities are promoted by a set of adaptor proteins, such as Shc, Grb2, Gab1, and FRS2. Two of these proteins, Shc and FRS2, interact directly with phosphorylated tyrosine residue Tyr490 (4Meakin S.O. MacDonald J.I. Gryz E.A. Kubu C.J. Verdi J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9861-9870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 5Kao S. Jaiswal R.K. Kolch W. Landreth G.E. J. Biol.

However, several reports suggest that the Shc-binding Tyr490 site does not fully account for the survival and differentiation activities associated with neurotrophin action. Mice harboring Y490F mutations in TrkB and TrkC receptors display only minimal neurotrophin-related deficits (6Minichiello L. Casagranda F. Tatche R.S. Stucky C.L. Postigo A. Lewin G.R. Davies A.M.

Hence, there are other Tyr490-independent mechanisms that also account for the effects of neurotrophins. One recently reported Trk-associated molecule, the ankyrin-rich membrane-spanning (ARMS/Kidins220) protein (referred hereafter as ARMS), represents a prime candidate for a specific target of Trk receptor tyrosine phosphorylation (11Kong H. Boulter J. Weber J.L. Lai C. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 176-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ARMS is a transmembrane protein highly expressed in many Trk receptor neuronal populations. The ARMS protein is closely associated with Trk receptors through its transmembrane domains but does not interact with the epidermal growth factor receptor (12Arevalo J.C. Yano H. Teng K.K. Chao M.V. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2358-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). ARMS is a large protein that contains a SAM domain, mutiple potential phosphorylation sites (>40), and a PDZ-binding motif at the C terminus. It does not contain classical domains of adaptor proteins, such as SH2, SH3, or pleckstrin homology (PH) domains. Recently, ARMS has been shown to be phosphorylated after neurotrophin treatment in PC12 cells and cortical neurons, leading to a prolonged MAP kinase response (12Arevalo J.C. Yano H. Teng K.K. Chao M.V. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2358-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It also serves as a substrate for protein kinase D (13Iglesias T. Cabrera-Poch N. Mitchell M.P. Naven T.J. Rozengurt E. Schiavo G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40048-40056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate a new mechanism for receptor tyrosine kinases that involves the phosphorylation of ARMS at a single tyrosine residue to produce a switch between short term and long term signaling. Mutation of this amino acid impairs prolonged MAPK activation and differentiation of PC12 cells in response to NGF treatment. Our data support a model in which a constitutive association of Trk receptors, ARMS and CrkL, is altered by a switch in the motif recognition of adaptor molecules after neurotrophin treatment. The phosphorylation of a specific tyrosine residue in ARMS allows the adaptor protein CrkL to engage C3G and activate Rap1. These results provide a new mechanism that goes beyond established models of neurotrophin signaling (1Chao M.V. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar, 2Huang E.J. Reichardt L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 609-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1982) Google Scholar, 14Segal R.A.

Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar) and indicate that Trk receptor tyrosine phosphorylation is capable of altering its signaling potential through a non-conventional downstream substrate. Subcellular Fractionation—Subcellular fractionation was performed as described previously (16Yano H. Chao M.V. J. Neurobiol. 2004; 58: 244-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), using iodixanol density gradient centrifugation. Cortical neurons (DIV11) were homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer in buffer H (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, with protease and phosphatase inhibitors). Membrane fractions (P2 and P3) were prepared by sequential centrifugation (800, 16,000, and 200,000 × g). P2 was then adjusted to 25% iodixanol (OptiPrep; Accurate, Westbury, NY) and overlaid with 20, 15, 10, and 5% iodixanol in buffer H. Gradients were centrifuged either in a SW40Ti rotor (Beckman, Fullerton, CA) at 27,000 rpm for 18 h or in a TLS55 rotor (Beckman) at 38,000 rpm for 5 h at 4°C. After gradient centrifugation, membrane fractions were collected, and equal volumes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with different antibodies. Preparation of GST Fusion Proteins and in Vitro Binding Assays—For the production of tyrosine-phosphorylated recombinant proteins, TKX1 bacteria (Stratagene) were used. We followed the instructions recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, expression of recombinant proteins in TKX1 bacteria was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h at 37°C. After collecting the cells the expression of the tyrosine kinase gene was induced in tryptophan starvation media containing indoleacrylic acid, and 2 h later bacteria were harvested, and recombinant tyrosine-phosphorylated GST fusion proteins were purified. In vitro binding experiments were performed as described previously (12Arevalo J.C. Yano H. Teng K.K. Chao M.V. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2358-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In Vitro Protein Translation—The wild type, R39N and W160L CrkL constructs, were in vitro translated and 35S-labeled with the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system using pDual GC vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Following translation, 35S-labeled CrkL proteins were incubated with HEK293 cell extracts in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer at 4 °C for 7 h with GST alone or GST-ARMS tyrosine-phosphorylated or non-tyrosine-phosphorylated recombinant proteins prebound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were then washed with lysis buffer and boiled in 1xLaemmli sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and 35S-labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography with signal enhancement (Amplify, Amersham Biosciences). Levels of GST fusion proteins were assessed by Coomassie Blue RC50 staining (Amersham Biosciences). Generation and Affinity Purification of Antibodies against Phosphorylated ARMS—A peptide containing phosphorylated Tyr1096 of ARMS rat protein was used to immunize rabbits (HEGPPRPPSGpYSQPASVC). The purification of antibodies against the phosphorylated residue was done as described previously (17Rajagopal R. Chen Z.Y. Lee F.S. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6650-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Crude serum was precleared of non-phosphorylated antibodies twice using an affinity column made by coupling the non-phosphorylated version of the peptide to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The flow-through from the second preclearing was then passed through a column made by coupling the phosphopeptide to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose. The column was washed extensively with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, and antibodies were then eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5. Fractions were collected from the eluate, neutralized with Tris buffer, pH 9.5, and then tested for specificity by blotting ARMS immunoprecipitates from neurotrophin treated cells. Isolation of Lipid Raft Fractions—To obtain detergent-insoluble membranes, hereon referred to as lipid rafts, we used a similar protocol to that described previously (18Bruckner K. Pablo Labrador J. Scheiffele P. Herb A. Seeburg P.H. Klein R. Neuron. 1999; 22: 511-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Briefly, DIV 9-11 cortical primary neuron cultures were lysed in TNE (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, and 5 mm EDTA) with 0.5% Triton X-100 (TXNE) where they were left to incubate for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysates were loaded on the bottom of a discontinuous Optiprep (iodixanol) density gradient by bringing them to 35% Optiprep in a SW40 centrifuge tube (Beckman). Layers of TXNE containing 30 and 0% Optiprep were subsequently added. After centrifugation at 36,000 rpm for 6 h, eight fractions were collected from the top. Equal volumes of each fraction were analyzed by Western blot. ARMS Is Tyrosine-phosphorylated at Tyr1096 in Response to Neurotrophins—ARMS is phosphorylated on many tyrosine residues in response to neurotrophins (11Kong H. Boulter J. Weber J.L. Lai C. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 176-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Arevalo J.C. Yano H. Teng K.K. Chao M.V. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2358-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, no specific tyrosine residues have been mapped in the ARMS protein. We therefore scanned the amino acid sequence of ARMS to search for consensus tyrosine motifs. One sequence, Y1096SQP, was found in the polyproline-rich region of ARMS that conforms to the consensus sequence previously described for binding to the SH2 domain of CrkL (for a review see (19Feller S.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6348-6371Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar)). CrkL was previously found to interact through its SH3 domain with a polyproline sequence of ARMS (12Arevalo J.C. Yano H. Teng K.K. Chao M.V. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2358-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To test whether ARMS undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation at Y1096SQP, we developed phosphoantibodies against a peptide carrying this phosphorylated residue. PC12 cells and cortical neurons were stimulated with NGF and BDNF, respectively. ARMS protein was immunoprecipitated with an anti-ARMS serum and subjected to Western blots with the purified phospho-ARMS antibody. An increase in the level of phosphorylated ARMS protein was observed upon NGF treatment in PC12 cells (2.6-fold) and BDNF treatment of cortical neurons (3.1-fold) (Fig. 1A). These results indicated that the Tyr1096 residue in ARMS was phosphorylated upon neurotrophin treatment. To confirm the specificity of the phosphotyrosine antibody, we transfected HEK293 cells with wild type ARMS and ARMSY1096F together with TrkA. TrkA activation resulted in a stronger signal detected by the phospho-ARMS antibody of wild type ARMS compared with ARMSY1096F (Fig. 1B). However, reprobing with a general p-Tyr antibody revealed a smaller decrease in the total tyrosine phosphorylation in ARMSY1096F. These results indicated that the phospho-ARMS antibody displays enhanced specificity for recognizing phosphorylated Tyr1096. Tyrosine-phosphorylated ARMS Can Bind to SH2 Domain of CrkL—To assess the functional consequences of the sequence Y1096SQP in ARMS, we produced recombinant tyrosine-phosphorylated GST fusion proteins carrying ARMS sequences (Fig. 2A). The recombinant proteins were phosphorylated on tyrosine using the bacterial strain TKX1, which contains an inducible tyrosine kinase activity (see “Experimental Procedures”). The proteins were purified and used to carry out protein interaction assays. The GST fusion proteins were first analyzed for their ability to bind to CrkL, a known binding partner of ARMS (12Arevalo J.C. Yano H. Teng K.K. Chao M.V. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2358-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The tyrosine-phosphorylated GST-ARMS7.2 protein bound more CrkL protein compared with the non-phosphorylated protein (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 3 and 4). To distinguish between the binding of GST-ARMS7.2 to the SH2 and the SH3 domains of CrkL, a deletion of the polyproline region was analyzed (GST-ARMS7.2ΔP). Interestingly, an association between CrkL and tyrosine-phosphorylated GST-ARMS7.2ΔP deletion protein was observed, whereas the interaction did not occur when the GST-ARMS7.2ΔP was not tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and 6). This implies that ARMS can bind to the SH2 domain of CrkL through a phosphotyrosine residue of ARMS. To investigate this possibility further, the Tyr1096 was mutated to phenylalanine. The interaction between the GST-ARMS proteins and CrkL was abolished (Fig. 2B, lanes 7-10). Binding to CrkL was not detected with the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins GST-ARMS7.3 and GST-ARMS7.6 that do not contain the Tyr1096 residue, verifying the specificity for this tyrosine (Fig. 2B, lanes 12 and 14). Surprisingly, the interaction between non-tyrosine phosphorylated ARMS7.2 and CrkL was also disrupted by mutation of Tyr1096 (Fig. 2B, lane 7). These results suggest that constitutive binding of the SH3 domain of CrkL to ARMS may also require this tyrosine residue for proper association. The involvement of flanking amino acids of the polyproline consensus motif in protein interactions has been previously reported (for a review, see Ref. 19Feller S.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6348-6371Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Interactions between ARMS and CrkII were not detected using recombinant proteins (data not shown). These findings indicate that the binding of ARMS to CrkL can be accomplished by the phosphorylation of ARMS specifically at Tyr1096. To confirm the participation of SH2 domain of CrkL in ARMS-CrkL interaction [35S]methionine CrkL proteins were synthesized and tested for association with ARMS. In vitro translated wild type CrkL interacted with GST-ARMS fusion proteins (Fig. 2C, top panel). A SH2 mutant CrkL protein, CrkLR39N, that abolished the interaction with previous known interactors as Cbl or paxillin, (20Senechal K. Heaney C. Druker B. Sawyers C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5082-5090Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), was not capable of binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated GST-ARMS fusions (Fig. 2C, middle panel). On the other hand, an SH3 CrkL mutant, CrkLW160L, that disrupted the binding of Abl, Sos, or C3G (20Senechal K. Heaney C. Druker B. Sawyers C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5082-5090Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), did not display any constitutive association but maintained the interaction with phosphorylated GST-ARMS proteins (Fig. 2C, bottom panel). As a control, binding of GST-ARMS7.2DPY1096 did not display any binding to the CrkL mutant proteins. These data support an interaction of the ARMS and CrkL proteins mediated by the phosphorylation of ARMS at residue Tyr1096 and the SH2 domain of CrkL. Trk Receptors, ARMS, CrkL, C3G, and Rap1, Are Present in Endosomal Membranes—To study the association of ARMS, CrkL, and Trk receptors further, we utilized Optiprep gradient centrifugation of membranes isolated from primary cortical neurons. This will better resemble the in vivo situation as compared with using cell lines. The Optiprep gradient effectively separates intracellular membrane compartments, including organella, vesicles, and endosomal membranes (16Yano H. Chao M.V. J. Neurobiol. 2004; 58: 244-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Membrane fractions were prepared by sequential centrifugation and then adjusted to 25% iodixanol. The P2 pellet was subjected to discontinuous Optiprep gradient centrifugation (Fig. 3A). Fractions from each interface were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for Trk and Trk-related proteins. After centrifugation, ARMS, CrkL, C3G, and Rap1 were present in the same fractions as EEA1, an endosomal marker (Fig. 3B). Co-localization of ARMS and EEA1 using indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. 4A) also confirms these results. ARMS, CrkL, C3G, and Rap1 were not found in the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi membranes, as assessed by ribophorin and GM130 co-migration, respectively (Fig. 3B). Trk receptors were found predominantly in endosomal membranes but displayed a broader distribution (Fig. 3B). Treatment with BDNF of these primary neurons resulted in a slight shift of Trk receptors to heavier membranes without affecting the mobility of the other proteins in these fractions (Fig. 3B). Similar results have been observed in the localization of TrkA and ARMS in PC12-615 cells (21Yano H. Chao M.V. Neurochem. Res. 2005; 30: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These data suggest that ARMS, CrkL, C3G, and Rap1 reside in similar endosomal membrane compartments. Endosomes serve as a meeting point for the formation of signaling complexes for a wide variety of ligands and their receptors, including transforming growth factor-β (22Hayes S. Chawla A. Corvera S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and epidermal growth factor (23Wang Y. Pennock S. Chen X. Wang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7279-7290Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). This would be consistent with experiments indicating that Trk and ARMS exist in a complex previous to its activation (12Arevalo J.C. Yano H. Teng K.K. Chao M.V. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2358-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 24Chang M.S. Arevalo J.C. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 78: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) in “signaling endosomes” (25Grimes M.L. Zhou J. Beattie E.C. Yuen E.C. Hall D.E. Valletta J.S. Topp K.S. LaVail J.H. Bunnett N.W. Mobley W.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7950-7964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another specialized membrane compartments implicated in cell signaling are lipid rafts (for a review, see Ref. 26Golub T. Wacha S. Caroni P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 542-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Previously, it has been reported that Trk receptors are recruited to lipid rafts in response to neurotrophins in cortical neurons (27Suzuki S. Numakawa T. Shimazu K. Koshimizu H. Hara T. Hatanaka H. Mei L. Lu B. Kojima M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1205-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To address whether ARMS and CrkL are present in these specialized membranes we isolated lipid rafts from primary cortical neurons in presence or absence of BDNF treatment using Triton X-100 extraction and centrifugation in an Optiprep gradient. ARMS and TrkB are slightly enriched in the lipid raft fractions. CrkL levels in that fraction are very low, and we do not find an enrichment of this protein in lipid rafts as compared with fractions 3-6, as it is clear for TrkB and ARMS. BDNF consistently induced the translocation of a small fraction of TrkB receptors to lipid rafts without changing the location of ARMS and CrkL (Fig. 4B). Fyn and transferrin receptor were used as positive and negative controls, respectively, for lipid raft association (Fig. 4B). ARMSY1096F Impairs Prolonged MAPK Activation and Differentiation in PC12 Cells—The biological effects of trophic factors require that signals are conveyed over long distances from the nerve terminal to the cell body. It has been proposed that signaling endosomes containing the receptor and associated proteins are delivered to the cell body, where signals are transduced to ensure trophic effects and differentiation (25Grimes M.L. Zhou J. Beattie E.C. Yuen E.C. Hall D.E. Valletta J.S. Topp K.S. LaVail J.H. Bunnett N.W. Mobley W.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7950-7964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To address whether phosphorylation of ARMS at Tyr1096 is directly involved in neurotrophin signaling, we assessed the ability of NGF to signal through the Trk receptor. A well established response is the induction of MAP kinase activity. Therefore, PC12 cells were transiently transfected with GFP, GFP-ARMS, and GFP-ARMSY1096F, and the activation of MAP kinase was followed in response to NGF. Our results indicated that the late phase activation of MAP kinase (40 min treatment) was impaired with the GFP-ARMSY1096F mutant compared with the wild type ARMS or GFP alone (Fig. 5B). This can be readily observed when comparing the p-MAPK staining at 5 versus 40 min of NGF treatment (Fig. 5A). No effects were observed in transient MAPK activation at 5 min after NGF treatment (Fig. 5B). We also noticed a detectable decrease in the number of PC12 cells transfected with GFP-ARMSY1096F that underwent NGF-dependent differentiation, in comparison with GFP and GFP-ARMS cells (Fig. 6A). A 40% decrease in the number of differentiated cells was observed (Fig. 6B). These data support the involvement of ARMS tyrosine phosphorylation at Tyr1096 residue in sustained MAPK activation and in the differentation of PC12 cells elicited by neurotrophins. It was previously reported that C3G binding to CrkL increased with neurotrophin treatment (12Arevalo J.C. Yano H. Teng K.K. Chao M.V. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2358-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To test whether the Tyr1096 residue in ARMS was required for this association, we performed in vitro binding studies with GST-ARMS fusion proteins. In contrast to GST-wild type ARMS protein (7.2), a decrease in binding of C3G to CrkL was observed with GST-ARMSY1096F fusion protein (Fig. 7A). Quantitation of the levels of C3G indicated that there was 112-fold more binding in the presence of wild type ARMS versus ARMSY1096F. As well, the ΔP deletion of ARMS bound 20-fold better that the ΔPY1096F mutation. These results verify that the Tyr1096 residue of ARMS is important for the association of C3G to CrkL. Neurotrophin signal transduction through Trk receptor tyrosine kinases is well understood (1Chao M.V. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar, 2Huang E.J.

Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar), in part from the similarity between other receptor tyrosine kinases to Trk receptors. A common set of cytoplasmic proteins is generally recruited to receptor tyrosine kinases. At the heart of Trk receptor function is the activation of phospholipase C-γ, MAP kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activities, which are utilized by nearly all members of the RTK family. Here we describe an unusual protein substrate for neurotrophin receptors, the ARMS protein, which is a very large protein with four closely spaced transmembrane domains. To our knowledge, this type of protein structure has not been observed in other tyrosine kinase substrates. Another analogous substrate, LAT (linker for activation of T cells) protein, is a single transmembrane protein that is utilized by the T cell receptor in mediating immune responses (28Sommers C.L. Menon R.K. Grinberg A. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Love P.E. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Among over forty potential phosphorylation sites, we have identified a key tyrosine phosphorylation event in ARMS protein that serves to recruit CrkL through its SH2 domain. In vitro binding assays established that this interaction is of a higher affinity than the polyproline sequence for the SH3 domain of CrkL (Fig. 2). Disruption of this phosphorylation event impairs the prolonged MAPK activation and the differentation of PC12 cells in response to neurotrophins (Figs. 5 and 6). What is the significance of two separate binding interactions between ARMS and CrkL? This is an intriguing question, since the Tyr1096 is within two amino acids of the polyproline sequence P1089PRPP in ARMS used to bind the CrkL SH3 domain. A model can be proposed in which a constitutive association of Trk-ARMS-CrkL occurs through the polyproline sequence in ARMS and SH3 domain of CrkL. Activation of Trk receptors by neurotrophins induces the phosphorylation of the Tyr1096 residue in ARMS that binds to the SH2 domain of CrkL. This switch in the binding requirement would allow for the release of the SH3 domain of CrkL to recruit C3G and trigger the activation of MAPK (Fig. 7). Thus, the spatial fidelity of signal transduction may be maintained by a constitutive interaction of ARMS and CrkL (SH3-dependent) while allowing for an NGF-inducible cascade of MAP kinase activation, once ARMS becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated (SH2-dependent). Support for this model comes from evidence that C3G recruitment is enhanced to the Trk-ARMS-CrkL complex upon NGF-induced phosphorylation (12Arevalo J.C. Yano H. Teng K.K. Chao M.V. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2358-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A preformed Trk-ARMS complex has also been consistently observed in co-immunoprecipitation experiments (11Kong H. Boulter J. Weber J.L. Lai C. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 176-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Arevalo J.C. Yano H. Teng K.K. Chao M.V. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2358-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 24Chang M.S. Arevalo J.C. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 78: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicated that conformational changes occur intramolecularly in Crk proteins that modify the binding specificities of Crk to other signaling proteins (29Escalante M. Courtney J. Chin W.G. Teng K.K. Kim J.I. Fajardo J.E. Mayer B.J. Hempstead B.L. Birge R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24787-24797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 30Kurokawa K.

Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15003-15008Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). An implicit prediction is that tyrosine-phosphorylated ARMS would facilitate CrkL to use its SH3 domain for recruitment of C3G or other adaptor proteins. Other adaptor proteins include c-Abl, DOCK2, IRS-4, and STAT5 (19Feller S.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6348-6371Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Therefore, regulation of neurotrophin signaling could be dependent upon the specific phosphorylation status of ARMS and the expression of other signaling proteins. In this study, the Tyr1096 residue was found to be critical for the activation of a key signaling pathway, MAP kinase. Indeed, disruption of Try1096 phosphorylation in ARMS abolished CrkL interaction (Fig. 2) and impaired prolonged MAPK activation and differentiation of PC12 cells in response to neurotrophins (Fig. 5 and 6). The switch in domain requirements for ARMS-CrkL is directly influenced by the binding affinity and phosphorylation status of ARMS and CrkL (Fig. 2, B and C). Another key parameter in neurotrophin signaling is the intracellular localization of Trk receptors and their effectors. Activation of TrkA in PC12 cells leads to its internalization and presence in early endosome compartments (32Wu C. Lai C.F. Mobley W.C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5406-5416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that activated Trk receptors can signal during the retrograde transport after internalization (33Yano H. Lee F.S. Kong H. Chuang J. Arevalo J. Perez P. Sung C. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Delcroix J.D. Valletta J.S. Wu C. Hunt S.J. Kowal A.S. Mobley W.C.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6650-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). We have detected the ARMS, CrkL, C3G, and Rap1 proteins in the same membrane compartments as Trk receptors with EEA1, a marker for early endosomes (Fig. 3B). The co-localization of ARMS with EEA1 (Fig. 4A), is consistent with the localization of TrkA in endosomal compartments (32Wu C. Lai C.F. Mobley W.C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5406-5416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with a specialized location, ARMS has been also found associated in lipid raft compartments in neurons (36Cabrera-Poch N. Sanchez-Ruiloba L. Rodriguez-Martinez M. Iglesias T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28592-28602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), where TrkB receptors have been found to be recruited in response to neurotrophins (27Suzuki S. Numakawa T. Shimazu K. Koshimizu H. Hara T. Hatanaka H. Mei L. Lu B. Kojima M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1205-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts are specialized microdomains in membranes rich in low density lipids, such as cholesterol and sphingolipids, implicated in many signaling processes at the cell surface (for a review, see Ref. 26Golub T. Wacha S. Caroni P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 542-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that the presence of ARMS in lipid rafts has a role in the neurotrophin signaling after recruitment of Trk receptors to these microdomains. The ARMS protein is a member of an atypical family of P-loop NTPases, KAP (Kidins220/ARMS and PifA), with a predicted function as NTP-dependent regulator of the assembly of membrane-associated signaling complexes (37Aravind L. Iyer L.M. Leipe D.D. Koonin E.V. Genome Biol. 2004; 5: R30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted that ARMS can serve as a substrate for ephrin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation (11Kong H. Boulter J. Weber J.L. Lai C. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 176-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, recent experiments indicate that ARMS/Kidins220 interact with alpha-syntrophin and modulate ephrin-mediated signaling (38Luo S. Chen Y. Lai K.O. Arevalo J.C. Froehner S.C. Adams M.E. Chao M.V. Ip N.Y. J. Cell. Biol. 2005; 169: 813-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The function of ARMS in signal transduction has yet to be fully understood, but it is likely to play a fundamental role in the response to extracellular cues. We thank the members of the Chao laboratory, particularly Rithwick Rajagopal and Niccolò Zampieri for insightful comments, Mercedes Beyna for technical assistance, and Belen Dominguez for continuous support."

In the grixazone biosynthesis gene cluster, griF (encoding a tyrosinase homolog) and griE (encoding a protein similar to copper chaperons for tyrosinases) are encoded. An expression study of GriE and GriF in Escherichia coli showed that GriE activated GriF by transferring copper ions to GriF, as has been observed for a Streptomyces melanogenesis system in which the MelC1 copper chaperon transfers copper ions to MelC2 tyrosinase. In contrast with tyrosinases, GriF showed no monophenolase activity, although it oxidized various o-aminophenols as preferable substrates rather than catechol-type substrates. Deletion of the griEF locus on the chromosome resulted in accumulation of 3-amino-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (3,4-AHBAL) and its acetylated compound, 3-acetylamino-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde. GriF oxidized 3,4-AHBAL to yield an o-quinone imine derivative, which was then non-enzymatically coupled with another molecule of the o-quinone imine to form a phenoxazinone. The coexistence of N-acetylcysteine in the in vitro oxidation of 3,4-AH-BAL by GriF resulted in the formation of grixazone A, suggesting that the –SH group of N-acetylcysteine is conjugated to the o-quinone imine formed from 3,4-AHBAL and that the conjugate is presumably coupled with another molecule of the o-quinone imine. GriF is thus a novel o-aminophenol oxidase that is responsible for the formation of the phenoxazinone chromophore in the grixazone biosynthetic pathway.

GriF is thus a novel o-aminophenol oxidase that is responsible for the formation of the phenoxazinone chromophore in the grixazone biosynthetic pathway. We have long studied the A-factor regulatory cascade that leads to secondary metabolite formation and morphological differentiation in Streptomyces griseus (1Horinouchi S. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: d2045-d2057PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ohnishi Y. Horinouchi S. Biofilms. 2004; 1: 319-328Crossref Google Scholar). The A-factor (2-isocapryloyl-3R-hydroxymethyl-γ-butyrolactone) triggers the synthesis of almost all the secondary metabolites produced by this species. One of the secondary metabolites under the control of the A-factor is grixazone. Grixazone is a yellow pigment and actually a mixture of grixazones A and B (compounds 1a and 1b) (see Fig. 2C) (3Ohnishi Y. Furusho Y. Higashi T. Chun H.-K. Furihata K. Sakuda S. Horinouchi S. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 2004; 57: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Grixazone A is a novel compound, and grixazone B has been reported to show a parasiticide activity (4Axel, Z., Sabine, B.-M., Susanne, G., Hartmut, V., and Gerhard, S. (March 23, 1988) European Patent EP260486Google Scholar). Grixazones contain a phenoxazinone chromophore. The phenoxazinone skeleton is common to actinomycin D produced by Streptomyces antibioticus (5Arison B.H. Hoogsteen K. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 3976-3983Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), michigazone produced by Streptomyces michiganensis (6Wolf G. Worth J. Achenbach H. Arch.

(Tokyo). 1990; 43: 1606-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and 4-demethoxymichigazone produced by Streptomyces halstedii (9Kunigami T. Shin-ya K. Furihata K. Furihata K. Hayakawa Y. Seto H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1996; 49: 312-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Hsieh and Jones (10Hsieh C.-J. Jones G.H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5740-5747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported a phenoxazinone synthase in S. antibioticus that catalyzes the six-electron oxidative coupling of o-aminophenol compounds derived from tryptophan through 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid. However, disruption of the phenoxazinone synthase gene in S. antibioticus does not affect actinomycin D synthesis, showing that the phenoxazinone skeleton in actinomycin D is biosynthesized in vivo by a still unknown enzyme or non-enzymatically (11Jones G.H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 1322-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). On the other hand, michigazone with a hydroxymethyl group at the 8-position of the phenoxazinone and texazone with a carboxyl group at this position are assumed to be synthesized from a precursor(s) different from that of actinomycin D with no functional group at this position (7Gerber N.N. Yale H.L. Taber W.A. Kurobane I. Vining L.C. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1983; 36: 688-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). No study on the precursor(s) or the biosynthetic enzyme for the phenoxazinone skeleton of these compounds has so far been reported. Because grixazones A and B contain an aldehyde and a carboxyl group, respectively, at the 8-position, the biosynthesis of the phenoxazinone skeleton in grixazones should be the same as those in michigazone and texazone. The phenoxazinones of exfoliazone and 4-demethoxymichigazone (which both contain a hydroxymethyl group at this position) are also presumed to be synthesized in a similar way. We cloned the grixazone biosynthesis gene cluster and revealed the organization of the genes. 2T. Higashi, Y. Ohnishi, and S. Horinouchi, unpublished data. Because all the biosynthesis and regulatory genes for a certain secondary metabolite are usually contained within the gene cluster, we expected that one of the gene products encoded in this gene cluster is responsible for the formation of the phenoxazinone skeleton of grixazones. Because some tyrosinases show an additional activity to use o-aminophenol as a substrate and yield phenoxazinones (12Toussaint O. Lerch K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8567-8571Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 13Gasowska B. Kafarski P. Wojtasek H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1673: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we aimed at two gene products (GriE and GriF) that are similar to the MelC1 and MelC2 proteins in streptomycetes, respectively. MelC2 is a tyrosinase and MelC1 is a copper chaperon for MelC2. Tyrosinase is a copper-containing monooxygenase that catalyzes two types of reaction, the o-hydroxylation of monophenols (monophenolase activity) and the oxidation of o-diphenols to o-quinone (diphenolase activity) using molecular oxygen. Tyrosinase is a member of the type 3 copper protein family, which also includes hemocyanins and catechol oxidases. The type 3 copper proteins contain a binuclear copper active site that is composed of two closely spaced copper atoms, each coordinated by three histidine residues. Although the binuclear copper active site is highly conserved, as determined by its characteristic spectroscopic signatures, by sequence homologies, and by the crystal structures of several hemocyanins and a catechol oxidase, their functions in catalysis are different. Catechol oxidases oxidize diphenols to the corresponding quinones but lack tyrosine hydroxylase activity. Hemocyanins serve as oxygen carriers and oxygen storage proteins in arthropods and mollusks. Tyrosinases are responsible for melanin pigmentation in streptomycetes, browning in plants, and melanization in animals. In addition to the intrinsic tyrosinase activities, the tyrosinases from Neurospora crassa (12Toussaint O. Lerch K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8567-8571Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), mushroom (13Gasowska B. Kafarski P. Wojtasek H. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8567-8571Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) convert 2-aminophenols into the corresponding o-quinone imines in vitro at a lesser rate, which are then non-enzymatically converted into phenoxazinones. In this study, we determined the plausible substrate of GriF by structural elucidation of an intermediate (3-amino-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (3,4-AHBAL 3The abbreviations used are: 3,4-AHBAL3-amino-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde3,4-AcAH-BAL3-acetylamino-4-hydroxybenzaldehydeHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyAPO2-aminophenoxazin-3-oneHPO2-hydroxyphenoxazin-3-oneAPOAL2-aminophenoxazin-3-one-8-aldehyde3,4-AHBA3-amino-4-hydroxybenzoic acidAPOC2-aminophenoxazin-3-one-8-carboxylate4,3-AHBA4-amino-3-hydroxybenzoic acidmmumillimass unit. ; compound 2a) (see Fig. 2C) that accumulated in a griEF-deleted mutant and revealed the in vitro formation of a phenoxazinone skeleton from 3,4-AHBAL by recombinant GriF produced in Escherichia coli. GriF did not use tyrosine as a substrate, although it showed ∼50% identity in amino acid sequence to melanin-producing tyrosinases in Streptomyces.

E. coli strain BL21(DE3)/pLysS was used for production of GriE and GriF. Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, Pyrobest DNA polymerase, and other DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from Takara Biochemicals. DNA was manipulated in Streptomyces (14Hopwood D.A. Bibb M.J.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) as described. l-Tyrosine, l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, and benzoic compounds except for 3,4-AHBAL were purchased from Wako Chemicals. 3,4-AHBAL was purified from the culture supernatant of S. griseus mutant ΔgriEF-harboring pIJ702-griR (see below). The tyrosinase from mushroom was purchased from Sigma. Deletion of griEF—The chromosomal griEF region of S. griseus IFO13350 was deleted as follows (see Fig. 1A). A 3.6-kb NcoI-SphI fragment containing a region upstream from griE and a 3.6-kb PmaCI fragment containing a 3′-portion of griF and a region downstream from griF were connected with a short linker derived from the multi-cloning linker of pUC19. This 7.2-kb fragment, which had a 1.1-kb deletion of the sequence in the griEF locus (from Met3 of GriE to His226 of GriF), was cloned into pUC19 together with a 1.1-kb HindIII fragment carrying the kanamycin resistance gene from Tn5, resulting in pΔgriEF. The plasmid was alkali-denatured and introduced by protoplast transformation into S. griseus IFO13350. Kanamycin-resistant transformants containing pΔgriEF in the chromosome (as a result of a single crossover) were first isolated, and one of the transformants was cultivated several times on YPD medium without kanamycin. Kanamycin-sensitive colonies (derived after a second crossover) were candidates for griEF-disrupted strains (mutant ΔgriEF). The correct replacement was checked by Southern hybridization using a 0.5 kb PmaCI-SphI fragment as a 32P-labeled probe (see Fig. 1A). Identification of 3,4-AHBAL and 3-Acetylamino-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (3,4-AcAHBAL) in the Supernatant of S. griseus Mutant ΔgriEF— For the purpose of overproduction of grixazone and its intermediates, we placed griR under the control of the melC promoter in pIJ702. The griR-coding sequence was amplified by the following two primers, 5′-GCGCATGCCTACGCACCATC-3′ (with the start codon of griR in italic letters and the SphI site underlined) and 5′-TCGAATTCTCAGCCGGAGCGCCC-3 (with the stop codon of griR in italic letters and the EcoRI site underlined). After the amplified fragment had been cloned into pCR4Blunt-TOPO and sequenced to confirm the absence of PCR-generated errors, the griR sequence was excised with SphI plus EcoRI and cloned between the SphI and EcoRI sites of a pIJ702-derived plasmid in which the melC1-melC2 sequence was replaced by a short linker containing SphI, BglII, and EcoRI sites, resulting in pIJ702-griR. S. griseus mutant ΔgriEF-containing pIJ702-griR was cultivated at 26.5 °C with rotary shaking for 3 days in SMM medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml thiostrepton. The culture broth was cleared by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 20 min and treated with hexane for liquid-liquid distribution. The materials in the aqueous layer were extracted with ethyl acetate and dried by evaporation. The crude material was dissolved in Me2SO and subjected to reversed-phase HPLC using a Waters 600 HPLC system equipped with a Waters 996 photodiode array detector. Compounds 2a and 2b (see Fig. 2C) were collected. HPLC conditions were as follows: column, CAPCELL PAK C18 (10 × 250 mm; Shiseido Fine Chemicals); flow rate, 3 ml/min; solvent A, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water; and solvent B, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 90% (v/v) acetonitrile in water. After 100 μl of the crude material had been injected into the column equilibrated with 5% solvent B, the column was initially developed isocratically for 3 min, followed by elution with a linear gradient from 5 to 100% solvent B over 13 min. 3,4-AHBAL (compound 2a) and 3,4-AcAHBAL (compound 2b) were identified on the basis of the following spectroscopic parameters (see Fig. 2C). 3,4-AHBAL (compound 2a): 1H NMR (500 MHz, Me2SO-d6) δ 9.63 (s, 1H, CHO), δ 7.10 (d, 1H, J = 2.5 Hz, ArH), δ 7.03 (dd, 1H, J = 8.0, 2.5 Hz, ArH), and δ 6.81 (d, 1H, J = 8.0 Hz, ArH); 13C NMR (125 MHz, Me2SO-d6) δ 191.6 (C-7), δ 150.7 (C-4), δ 137.6 (C-3), δ 129.3 (C-1), δ 122.4 (C-6), δ 114.0 (C-2), and δ 112.5 (C-5); high resolution electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrum, m/z 137.09312 [M]+ (calculated for C7H7N1O2, 2.39 mmu error). 3,4-AcAHBAL (compound 2b): 1H NMR (500 MHz, Me2SO-d6) δ 11.12 (s, 1H, OH), δ 9.76 (s, 1H, CHO), δ 9.34 (s, 1H, NH), δ 8.41 (d, 1H, J = 2.0 Hz, ArH), δ 7.53 (dd, 1H, J = 8.5 Hz, 2.0, ArH), δ 7.03 (d, 1H, J = 8.0 Hz, ArH), and δ 2.12 (s, 3H, CH3); 13C NMR (125 MHz, Me2SO-d6) δ 191.3 (C-7), δ 169.2 (C-8), δ 153.6 (C-4), δ 128.3 (C-3), δ 127.7 (C-6), δ 127.2 (C-1), δ 122.6 (C-2), δ 115.4 (C-5), and δ 23.8 (C-9); high resolution electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrum, m/z 180.06632 [M + H]+ (calculated for C9H10N1O3, 0.25 mmu error). Expression of griE and griF in E. coli—The griF sequence was amplified by PCR with two primers, 5′-CATATGGTCCACGTACGCAAG-3′ (with the start codon of griF in italic letters and the NdeI site underlined) and 5′-CTCGAGCTGGTCGTAGGTGTAGAAC-3 (with the XhoI site underlined). After the amplified fragment had been cloned into pCR4Blunt-TOPO and sequenced to confirm the absence of errors during PCR, the griF sequence was excised with NdeI and XhoI and cloned into pET-26b(+). The griF sequence, together with the lacI gene, was excised from the plasmid by digestion with Bpu1102I and Bst1107I and transferred onto pET-17b digested with Bpu1102I and Bst1107I, resulting in pET-griF, which contained griF under the control of the T7/lac promoter. The griE sequence was amplified by PCR with primers 5′-CATATGCCCATGAACAGGCGAG-3′ (with the start codon of griE in italic letters and the NdeI site underlined) and 5′-CTCGAGTCAGAGGTGCGTGACGTG-3 (with the stop codon of griE in italic letters and the XhoI site underlined). The amplified fragment was cloned into pCR4Blunt-TOPO and sequenced to confirm the absence of errors during PCR. The griE sequence was excised with NdeI and XhoI and cloned in pET-17b, resulting in pET-griE, which contained griE under the control of the T7 promoter. For construction of plasmid containing both griE and griF, pET-griF was digested with SphI and treated with T4 DNA polymerase to produce blunt ends, followed by BglII digestion. To this linear plasmid with a BglII site at one end and a blunt end at the other end, a 0.9-kb fragment containing the griE expression cassette excised from pET-griE by digestion with SspI and BglII was ligated, resulting in pET-griEF, which contained griE under the control of the T7 promoter and griF under the control of the T7/lac promoter. These plasmids were used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3)/pLysS cells. Transformant cells were cultured at 26.5 °C for 10 h in LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin, 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 1% (w/v) lactose, allowing constant expression of the T7 and T7/lac promoters. Purification of Recombinant GriF—All operations were carried out at 4 °C. Cells (3.6 g, wet weight) were harvested by centrifugation and suspended in 6 ml of buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, and 10% glycerol) containing 10 mm imidazole and 2 mg/ml lysozyme. After incubation of the mixture on ice for 30 min, the cell suspension was sonicated for 3 min and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris. Polyethyleneimine was added to the supernatant to give a final concentration of 0.1% (w/v), followed by centrifugation of the mixture at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was a crude enzyme solution used for some analyses. For further purification of GriF, the supernatant was applied to a Cu2+-charged HiTrap chelating HP column (1 ml; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A containing 10 mm imidazole. The column was successively washed with buffer A containing 10 mm imidazole and buffer B (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0) containing 50 mm imidazole, and then the materials were eluted with buffer B containing 200 mm imidazole. The eluate was applied to a HiTrap Q column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer B containing 200 mm imidazole, and the column was washed with the same buffer. The flow-through and wash fractions were pooled, and ammonium sulfate was added to 20% saturation. The enzyme solution was subjected to fast protein liquid chromatography with a Resource PHE column (1 ml; Amersham) equilibrated with buffer C (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, and 20% saturated ammonium sulfate) and eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The column was washed with the same buffer for 10 min, followed by elution with a 0–100% linear gradient of buffer D (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, and 50% (v/v) ethylene glycol) over 10 min. Proteins were quantified using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Gel filtration analysis was performed using a Superdex 200 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) by fast protein liquid chromatography with isocratic elution in 20 mm sodium phosphate (adjusted to pH 7.2) containing 0.15 m NaCl at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Enzyme Assays—The standard reaction mixture (400 μl) consisted of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 5 mm substrate, and an enzyme sample. The mixture without enzyme was preincubated at 30 °C in a cuvette, and the reaction was started by the addition of the enzyme. GriF activity was assayed by monitoring the formation of 2-aminophenoxazin-3-one (APO; ϵ433 = 9600 m–1 cm–1) from o-aminophenol as a substrate by measuring the absorbance at 433 nm on a spectrometer (Spectra Max Plus, Molecular Devices Corp.). The initial velocity was used for the calculation of activity, which was defined as the amount (moles) of substrate decreased per s at 30 °C. The tyrosinase activity of GriF and the mushroom tyrosinase was assayed by monitoring the formation of dopachrome (ϵ475 = 3600 m–1 cm–1) from l-tyrosine or l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine as a substrate by measuring the absorbance at 475 nm (16Kohashi Y.P. Kumagai T. Matoba Y. Yamamoto A. Maruyama M. Sugiyama M. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 34: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). One unit of GriF activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that decreased 1 nmol of substrate/s at 30 °C. Identification of the Reaction Products from o-Aminophenol, o-Aminophenol Plus Catechol, and 3,4-AHBAL—The products were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC. HPLC conditions were as follows: column, Senshu Pak DOCOSIL-B (4.6 × 250 mm, Senshu Kagaku); column temperature, 30 °C; and flow rate, 1 ml/min. After 10 μlofthe reaction mixture had been injected into the column equilibrated with solvent A, the column was initially developed isocratically for 3 min, followed by elution with a linear gradient from 0 to 100% solvent B over 15 min. The reaction products from o-aminophenol, o-aminophenol plus catechol, and 3,4-AHBAL were identified as APO (compound 3a) (see Fig. 2C), 2-hydroxyphenoxazin-3-one (HPO; compound 3b), and 2-aminophenoxazin-3-one-8-aldehyde (APOAL; compound 3c), respectively, on the basis of the following spectroscopic parameters. APO (compound 3a): 1H NMR (500 MHz, Me2SO-d6) δ 7.69 (dd, 1H, J = 8.0, 1.5, ArH), δ 7.49 (dd, 1H, J = 8.3, 1.5 Hz, ArH), δ 7.45 (td, 1H, J = 7.0, 1.5 Hz, ArH), δ 7.38 (td, 1H, J = 7.5, 1.5, ArH), δ 6.36 (s, 1H, ArH), and δ 6.35 (s, 1H, ArH); 13C NMR (125 MHz, Me2SO-d6) δ 180.2 (C-3), δ 149.1 (C-10a), δ 148.1 (C-4a), δ 147.6 (C-2), δ 141.9 (C-5a), δ 133.4 (C-9a), δ 128.8 (C-7), δ 127.7 (C-9), δ 125.3 (C-8), δ 116.0 (C-6), δ 103.5 (C-1), and δ 98.1 (C-4); high resolution electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrum, m/z 213.06874 [M + H]+ (calculated for C12H9N2O2, 2.34 mmu error). HPO (compound 3b): 1H NMR (500 MHz, Me2SO-d6) δ 7.81 (d, 1H, J = 7.0, ArH), δ 7.59 (t, 1H, J = 7.5 Hz, ArH), δ 7.54 (d, 1H, J = 8.0 Hz, ArH), δ 7.44 (t, 1H, J = 7.5, ArH), δ 6.69 (s, 1H, ArH), and δ 6.43 (s, 1H, ArH); 13C NMR (125 MHz, Me2SO-d6) δ 180.3 (C-3), δ 155.7 (C-2), δ 149.1 (C-10a), δ 148.6 (C-4a), δ 142.6 (C-5a), δ 133.2 (C-9a), δ 131.1 (C-7), δ 128.9 (C-9), δ 125.5 (C-8), δ 116.2 (C-6), δ 106.7 (C-1), and δ 104.2 (C-4); high resolution electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrum, m/z 214.06998 [M + H]+ (calculated for C12H8N1O3, 4.25 mmu error). APOAL (compound 3c): 1H NMR (500 MHz, Me2SO-d6) δ 10.05 (s, 1H, CHO), δ 8.20 (d, 1H, J = 2.0 Hz, ArH), δ 7.93 (dd, 1H, J = 8.5, 1.5 Hz, ArH), δ 7.66 (d, 1H, J = 8.0, ArH), δ 6.43 (s, 1H, ArH), and δ 6.36 (s, 1H, ArH); 13C NMR (125 MHz, Me2SO-d6) δ 191.8 (CHO), δ 180.5 (C-3), δ 149.2 (C-10a), δ 148.6 (C-4a), δ 147.8 (C-2), δ 146.0 (C-5a), δ 133.9 (C-9a), δ 133.2 (C-8), δ 130.1 (C-7), δ 128.1 (C-9), δ 117.1 (C-6), δ 104.3 (C-1), and δ 98.2 (C-4); high resolution electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrum, m/z 241.09174 [M + H]+ (calculated for C13H9N2O3, 30.42 mmu error). GriF as a Tyrosinase Homolog—We cloned and sequenced the whole gene cluster for the biosynthesis of grixazone from S. griseus IFO13350 (Fig. 1A).2 The gene cluster contains 13 open reading frames. Of the 13 gene products, two proteins (GriE and GriF) are similar to the MelC1 and MelC2 proteins, respectively, both of which are responsible for melanin biosynthesis in streptomycetes (17Bernan V. Filpula D. Herber W. Bibb M. Katz E. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 37: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 18Huber M. Hintermann G. Lerch K.

MelC2 tyrosinase belongs to the type 3 copper protein family, and MelC1 serves as a copper chaperon for MelC2. Although tyrosinases from various organisms from bacteria to human have different secondary and tertiary structures and domain structures, they all contain two copper-binding sites, each formed by three histidine residues (Fig. 1B). The two copper-binding sites of GriF are also highly conserved. Therefore, GriF was expected to contain two copper atoms. The two closely spaced copper atoms, each coordinated by three histidine residues, must compose a binuclear copper active site of GriF, as is found for the type 3 copper proteins. Thus, because of the high end-to-end similarity (∼50% identity) to MelC2, GriF was expected to show monophenolase and/or diphenolase activity by the same catalytic mechanism as tyrosinases do by using molecular oxygen as an oxidizing agent. GriE shows end-to-end similarity to MelC1 in streptomycetes and has a probable twin arginine translocation-type N-terminal signal peptide for protein secretion (data not shown), as does MelC1 (22Schaerlaekens K. Schierová M. Lammertyn E. Geukens N. Anné J. van Mellaert L. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6727-6732Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of MelC1 in streptomycetes are conserved at a moderate level (40–50% identity) and are always encoded as a neighbor of melC2 (17Bernan V. Filpula D. Herber W. Bibb M. Katz E. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 37: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 20Ikeda K. Masujima T. Suzuki K. Sugiyama M. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1992; 45: 80-85Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). GriE was therefore expected to be involved in the transfer of copper ion to the apo form of GriF via binary complex formation (23Chen L.-Y. Leu W.-M. Wang K.-T. Lee Y.-H. W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20100-20107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Chen L.-Y. Chen M.-Y. Leu W.-M. Tsai T.-Y. Lee Y.-H. W. J. Biol.

Accumulation of 3,4-AHBAL and 3,4-AcAHBAL in S. griseus Mutant ΔgriEF—Because some tyrosinases show the ability to convert o-aminophenols into the corresponding phenoxazinone moieties, in addition to their intrinsic tyrosinase activity (12Toussaint O. Lerch K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8567-8571Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 13Gasowska B. Kafarski P. Wojtasek H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1673: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we expected that a mutation in griF would result in accumulation of o-aminophenol(s) as a substrate of GriF for the formation of the phenoxazinone chromophore of grixazone. We deleted the griEF locus on the chromosome of S. griseus IFO13350 to determine the chemical structure of a possible substrate for GriF or an intermediate in the grixazone biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 1A). As a result of double-reciprocal crossover, a 1.1-kb griEF locus (corresponding to the region from Met3 of GriE to His226 of GriF) was deleted, which was confirmed by Southern hybridization with the 0.5-kb PmaCI-SphI fragment (shown in Fig. 1A) as a 32P-labeled probe against the chromosomal DNA digested with SphI (data not shown). HPLC analysis of the culture broth of mutant ΔgriEF revealed the accumulation of some compounds different from grixazones. After 3 days of cultivation, mutant ΔgriEF accumulated two major compounds (2a and 2b) that were not seen in the culture broth of the parental strain when detected by absorbance at 254 nm (Fig. 2, A and B). After 5 days of cultivation, the parental strain accumulated grixazone A (c"

The Bordetella pertussis FhaC/FHA couple serves as a model for the two-partner secretion pathway in Gram-negative bacteria, with the TpsB protein, FhaC, being the specific transporter of its TpsA partner, FHA, across the outer membrane. In this work, we have investigated the structure/function relationship of FhaC by analyzing the ion channel properties of the wild type protein and a collection of mutants with varied FHA secretion activities. We demonstrated that the channel is formed by the C-terminal two-thirds of FhaC most likely folding into a β-barrel domain predicted to be conserved throughout the family. A C-proximal motif that represents the family signature appears essential for pore function. The N-terminal 200 residues of FhaC constitute a functionally distinct domain that modulates the pore properties and may participate in FHA recognition.

Targeting and translocation of soluble and integral membrane proteins to the ad hoc subcellular compartments are essential for cell function and organelle biogenesis. Transport of proteins across membranes and their insertion into membranes are typically mediated by proteinaceous transmembrane complexes, and some of these pathways have been conserved throughout evolution (1Alder N.N. Theg S.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 442-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). With their complex envelope structure, Gram-negative bacteria and eukaryotic organelles face similar challenges for the translocation of proteins (2Matouschek A. Glick B.S. Nat. Struct.

Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Similarly, polypeptide-transporting β-barrel proteins are also found in the outer membranes of eukaryotic organelles of prokaryotic origin such as chloroplasts and mitochondria (6Schnell D.J.

The recently revealed Omp85/TpsB superfamily of outer membrane proteins is dedicated to protein transport in most major kingdoms of life, although no members have been identified in Archaebacteria yet (8Moslavac S.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1562: 6-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). TpsB transporters are found in two-partner secretion systems, developed by Gram-negative bacteria for the secretion of large “TpsA” proteins destined to the cell surface or the milieu and serving mostly as virulence factors (10Jacob-Dubuisson F. Fernandez R. Coutte L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The other members of the Omp85/TpsB superfamily are transporter proteins included in large hetero-oligomeric complexes, such as the Toc75 homologs in chloroplasts, the Tob55/Sam50 homologs in mitochondria and the Omp85 homologs in Gram-negative bacteria. These transporters mediate inward protein transport across the chloroplast outer membrane and assembly of β-barrel proteins into the outer membrane of mitochondria and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively (11Schleiff E.

Bordetella pertussis secretes its major adhesin, FHA, via a TpsB family member, the outer membrane transporter FhaC (25Jacob-Dubuisson F. Locht C. Antoine R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). A topology model for FhaC was proposed earlier, based on sequence alignments of several TpsB proteins, predicting 19 amphipathic anti-parallel β-strands linked by large surface loops and periplasmic turns (24Guédin S.

The C-terminal portion of this model was reasonably well validated by an epitope insertion method, whereas the N-terminal moiety has remained significantly less well defined (24Guédin S. Willery E.

FhaC was shown to form ion-permeable channels in artificial membranes, although the relationship between this pore activity and the FHA-secreting activity of FhaC has not been established (21Jacob-Dubuisson F.

A collection of mutant FhaC proteins each carrying a two-residue insertion at a specific sequence position were generated previously (24Guédin S. Willery E. Tommassen J. Fort E. Drobecq H. Locht C.

We have thus established that the C-terminal two-thirds of FhaC participate in channel formation, and its first 200 residues most likely form a functionally distinct domain. The results also suggest that the ion channel corresponds to the protein-conducting pore. wild type tobacco etch virus. Plasmid Construction—pFJD118 was constructed as follows. pFcc3 (24Guédin S.

The oligonucleotides 5′-GATCCCACCATCACCACCATCACGGGCCCG-3′ and 5′-GATCCGGGCCCGTGATGGTGGTGATGGTGG-3′ were annealed and inserted into BamHI-restricted pFcc3. The orientation of that linker was verified by sequencing, and the resulting plasmid was called pFcc3-His6. The latter plasmid was restricted with XbaI and SacI, and the fhaC-containing DNA fragment was inserted into the same sites of pET24d (Novagen), resulting in pFJD118. To prepare the pFJD118 derivatives harboring fhaC each with a given insertion, pFJD118 was restricted with PstI (which cleaves a few nucleotides 3′ of the position of the BamHI site in fhaC) and SacI (which cleaves after the termination codon of fhaC). The PstI-SacI fragments prepared from the corresponding pFccx, pMycx, or pTEVx plasmids (24Guédin S. Willery E. Tommassen J. Fort E. Drobecq H. Locht C. Jacob-Dubuisson F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30202-30210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), each coding for FhaC with a particular insertion (or deletion), were exchanged for the WT fragment of pFJD118. The resulting plasmids were called pT7FcxB (where x represents the position of the codon with a BamHI insert), pT7FcxM (for a Myc-encoding insert at codon x), pT7FcxT (for a tobacco etch virus (TEV) cleavage site encoding insert at codon x), or pT7FcΔx-y (with a deletion between codons x and y). The corresponding amino acid sequences of the mutants are shown in the supplemental Table. To construct pFJD150, the plasmid encoding the C-terminal truncate FhaC-Δ3–206, pFcc206 was restricted with BamHI and HindIII, and the resulting fragment coding for the last 349 residues of FhaC was inserted into a pFJD118 derivative called pFJD138 in replacement of its own BamHI-HindIII fragment. pFJD138 is similar to pFJD118 except that there is a BamHI site only 3′ of the His6 tag-coding linker, but not in the 5′ position. The resulting pFJD150 encodes the C-terminal truncate of FhaC with a His6 sequence located three residues after the signal peptide cleavage site. Expression and Purification of Wild Type and Mutant FhaC Proteins—The WT and mutant FhaC proteins were produced and purified, as described previously (21Jacob-Dubuisson F. El-Hamel C. Saint N. Guedin S. Willery E. Molle G. Locht C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37731-37735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) from Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)-omp5 (26Prilipov A. Phale P.S. van Gelder P. Rosenbusch J.P. Koebnik R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 163: 65-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) carrying each of the pT7Fc plasmids, with the following modifications. After harvesting the membrane fractions by ultracentrifugation, two steps of extraction were performed successively with 0.8 and 1.5% β-octyl glucoside. The second detergent extract was chromatographed as described previously (21Jacob-Dubuisson F. El-Hamel C. Saint N. Guedin S. Willery E. Molle G. Locht C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37731-37735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), except that 1% Elugent was used in the buffers rather than 0.4%. The metal-chelate chromatography was performed with 400 mm imidazole in the elution buffer. Secretion Assay—E. coli UT5600 bacteria harboring pFJD12 (coding for Fha44, a C-terminally truncated version of FHA whose secretion properties parallel those of FHA (27Jacob-Dubuisson F. Buisine C. Mielcarek N. Clement E. Menozzi F.D. Locht C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar)) and each of the plasmids of the pFcx series (or pTEVx or pMycx) were grown as described previously (24Guédin S. Willery E.

Jacob-Dubuisson F. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 763-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The culture supernatants were harvested following a 2-h period of induction with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and were subjected to electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels in the presence of SDS. The proteins were then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunodetection was performed using a mixture of two monoclonal antibodies raised against FHA, F4 and F5 (29Coutte L. Antoine R. Drobecq H. Locht C. Jacob-Dubuisson F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5040-5048Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To compare the amounts of FhaC produced by those strains, bacteria were harvested from liquid cultures at mid-exponential phase, washed in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7), and resuspended in 1/10 volume of the same buffer. Equal amounts of bacteria were used for all strains. They were broken by passages in a French press, and the clarified lysates were subjected to a 1-h ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g to pellet the membranes. The pellets were resuspended in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7), and membrane aliquots from each strain were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-FhaC antibodies (24Guédin S. Willery E.

The amounts of Fha44 and FhaC in all strains were determined by densitometry scanning of immunoblots. The secretion activities were calculated by determining the ratios Fha44/FhaC and setting the secretion activity of the strain producing WT FhaC to 100%. Planar Lipid Bilayer Recordings—From a 0.5% solution of azolectin (Sigma) in hexane, virtually solvent-free planar lipid bilayers were formed by the apposition of two monolayers as described (21Jacob-Dubuisson F.

The membrane was formed over a 125–200-μm diameter hole in a thin Teflon film (10-μm) sandwiched between two glass cells pretreated with hexadecane/hexane (1:40, v/v). The cis- and trans-compartments contained 1 m KCl buffered with 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4). 0.5–5 μl of purified FhaC (initial concentration of 0.2–0.5 mg/ml) were diluted 100-fold in 1% octyl-polyoxyethylene and added to the cis-compartment. The measuring cell was connected with an Ag/AgCl electrode at the cis-side, and the electrode on the so-called trans-side was grounded. All experiments were performed at room temperature. In macroscopic conductance experiments, the doped membranes were subjected to slow voltage ramps (10 mV/s), and transmembrane currents were fed into an amplifier (BBA-01, Eastern Scientific, Rockville, MD). Current-voltage curves were analyzed with the SCOPE software (Bio-Logic, Claix, France). In single-channel recordings, currents were amplified and potentials were applied simultaneously by a patch clamp amplifier (RK 300, Bio-Logic). Single-channel currents were monitored using an oscilloscope (TDS 3012, Tektronix, Beaverton, OR) and stored on a CD recorder (DRA 200, Bio-Logic) for off-line analysis. CD data were then analyzed by the WinEDR (Bio-Logic) and Clampfit (Axon Instruments) software. Data were filtered at 1 kHz before digitizing at 11.2 kHz for analysis. TEV Protease Digestion of FhaC-150T Mutant—Purified FhaC-150T diluted in 0.05% dodecyl maltoside was treated with TEV protease (AcTEV Protease, Invitrogen) in 40 samples of 20 μl each. The digestion was performed overnight at 30 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, with 6 units of AcTEV protease (10 units/μl) in each reaction tube. The ratio of TEV protease to FhaC-150T was ∼1:1. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Choice of the Mutant FhaC Derivative—To study the relationship between the channel properties of FhaC and its secretion activity, 20 different mutants were selected from a collection generated previously by random insertion of 6-mer BamHI linkers into the fhaC sequence (24Guédin S. Willery E. Tommassen J. Fort E. Drobecq H. Locht C. Jacob-Dubuisson F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30202-30210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The corresponding mutant FhaCs contain each a 2-residue insertion at a given position in the protein (Fig. 1A and supplemental Table). Four FhaC derivatives with longer c-Myc insertions (16 residues), FhaC-125M, FhaC-260M, FhaC-434 M, and FhaC-503M, were included in the analysis, as well as two additional FhaC variants, FhaC-Δ3–26 and FhaC-Δ221–228, each carrying a small deletion in predicted loops L1 and L3, respectively (24Guédin S.

All the mutant genes were coexpressed with the fha44 gene in E. coli UT5600 to determine the secretion activities of the corresponding FhaC proteins, as described previously (24Guédin S. Willery E. Tommassen J. Fort E. Drobecq H. Locht C. Jacob-Dubuisson F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30202-30210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Fha44 is an N-terminal fragment of FHA whose secretion properties parallel those of the full-length protein (27Jacob-Dubuisson F. Buisine C. Mielcarek N. Clement E. Menozzi F.D. Locht C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The levels of production of the FhaC mutant proteins were determined by immunoblot analyses of total membrane fractions of the recombinant strains using anti-FhaC antibodies (24Guédin S. Willery E. Tommassen J. Fort E. Drobecq H. Locht C. Jacob-Dubuisson F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30202-30210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). In parallel, we assessed Fha44 secretion by immunoblot analyses of nonconcentrated culture supernatants of these recombinant strains using anti-FHA antibodies (Fig. 1B). The secretion activities were obtained by calculating the Fha44/FhaC ratio for each strain (Table 1). The FhaC mutant proteins secreted Fha44 with widely varied efficiencies (Table 1). Altogether, the levels of Fha44 secretion were found to depend essentially on the positions of the mutations rather than on the abundance of the mutant FhaC proteins, as observed earlier (24Guédin S. Willery E. Tommassen J. Fort E. Drobecq H. Locht C. Jacob-Dubuisson F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30202-30210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B and Table 1). Of note, the c-Myc insertion immediately after residue 125, although predicted to interrupt a transmembrane strand, did not affect the production of FhaC or its ability to secrete Fha44 in vivo (Fig. 1B).TABLE 1Secretion activities and electrophysiological properties of FhaC derivativesMutationSecretion activity of mutantaSecretion activities correspond to the levels of Fha44 secreted in the supernatants corrected by the levels of FhaC produced by the recombinant strains.

Open table in a new tab We then sought to purify each of the mutant proteins in order to analyze their pore properties in lipid bilayers. To this end, WT FhaC as well as each of the mutant proteins were overproduced in a porin-deficient E. coli strain, BL21(DE3)-omp5, and the corresponding proteins were purified. Under those conditions, most mutant FhaCs were obtained at reasonable yields. However, FhaC-243B was obtained in very low amounts, whereas FhaC-33B could not be extracted from the membranes, most likely because it was significantly perturbed by the insertion. FhaC-33B was thus not considered further. Characterization of WT FhaC in Artificial Lipid Bilayers; Macroscopic I/V Curves—In a previous study, we reported that FhaC formed ion-permeable channels showing relatively brief openings and with conductance values around 1200 pS in 1 m KCl (21Jacob-Dubuisson F. El-Hamel C. Saint N. Guedin S. Willery E. Molle G. Locht C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37731-37735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In the present study, we looked at ion channel properties of FhaC by recording macroscopic current-voltage (I/V) curves (Fig. 2A). In this configuration, up to a hundred channels are incorporated and submitted to slow voltage ramps at relatively high protein concentrations. Macroscopic I/V curves are useful to screen the functional properties of potential channel formers in lipid bilayers and allow relatively rapid comparisons between related proteins, i.e. mutants of FhaC. The I/V curves obtained after addition of FhaC at a final concentration around 100 ng/ml to the cis-side of azolectin bilayers submitted to slow triangular voltage ramps (10 mV/s) were asymmetric, with the apparition of a hysteresis in the negative quadrant (Fig. 2A). This result indicates that structurally asymmetric FhaC molecules, as suggested by secondary structure predictions, insert in a preferred orientation into lipid bilayers. However, the absolute orientation of the molecules could not be determined from these current-voltage recordings. The I/V curve in Fig. 2A exhibits a linear part from +100 mV to around –60 mV, indicating a voltage-independent conductance of FhaC channels in this voltage range, whereas a curve bending appeared from –60 to –100 mV in the increasingly negative voltage branch. This latter observation suggests the following. (i) The conductance characteristics of FhaC are dependent on the membrane potential above a threshold voltage (around –60 mV). (ii) A conformational change of FhaC channels, such as a displacement of loops, may appear at this particular voltage, which results in higher ion-conducting pores as observed from increasing currents recorded above this potential. It is noteworthy that the falling voltage branch in the negative part of the I/V curve did not present a curve bending as observed in the corresponding rising voltage branch. This indicates that the channels might not switch back to their initial conformation during the relaxation process at negative voltages. Characterization of Wild Type FhaC in Artificial Lipid Bilayers; Single-channel Measurements—In order to characterize further the FhaC channels and to confirm that the asymmetric properties in ion conduction observed from the I/V recordings were an intrinsic property of membrane-inserted FhaC, we also examined the influence of membrane potential on conductance in single-channel experiments. To this end, very small amounts of FhaC molecules were introduced into the cis-compartment bathing the lipid bilayer (final concentration around 0.1 to 1 ng/ml). Fig. 2B shows ionic currents through a single FhaC channel recorded at different membrane potentials. The current increased with increasing voltages between +40 and +80 mV, and the conductance value (about 1200 pS; see the amplitude histogram on Fig. 2C) remained stable, indicating that no voltage-dependent conductance occurred in this potential range. In contrast, the conductance characteristics of FhaC changed at negative voltages. Although altered conductance could not be well visualized at –40 mV, current recordings at –60 mV became slightly noisy and revealed that the FhaC channel occasionally displayed switches into substrates. This behavior became more pronounced at increasing negative potentials until the channel conductance appeared very noisy. Fig. 2D shows current recorded through an FhaC channel at repetitive pulses of +60 and –60 mV. The appearance of noisy currents during negative pulses is a consequence of applied negative voltages, because noisy channels did not persist when potentials were switched back to positive polarity. The increasing noise at high negative potentials could be because of an asymmetric distribution of positive and negative charges across the membrane combined with a conformational mobility of parts of the protein, as described earlier for TolC and engineered variants of LamB (30Andersen C.

https://openalex.org/W2037602302,"Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are neuronal Na+ channels that are members of the epithelial Na+ channel/degenerin family and are transiently activated by extracellular acidification. ASICs in the central nervous system have a modulatory role in synaptic transmission and are involved in cell injury induced by acidosis. We have recently demonstrated that ASIC function is regulated by serine proteases. We provide here evidence that this regulation of ASIC function is tightly linked to channel cleavage. Trypsin cleaves ASIC1a with a similar time course as it changes ASIC1a function, whereas ASIC1b, whose function is not modified by trypsin, is not cleaved. Trypsin cleaves ASIC1a at Arg-145, in the N-terminal part of the extracellular loop, between a highly conserved sequence and a sequence that is critical for ASIC1a inhibition by the venom of the tarantula Psalmopoeus cambridgei. This channel domain controls the inactivation kinetics and co-determines the pH dependence of ASIC gating. It undergoes a conformational change during inactivation, which renders the cleavage site inaccessible to trypsin in inactivated channels."

The polyadenylation of messenger RNAs in the nucleus is an important step in the biogenesis of mRNAs in eukaryotes. This RNA processing reaction adds an essential cis element, the poly(A) tail, to the 3′-end of a processed pre-mRNA. This process is also coupled with many other steps in mRNA biogenesis (1Proudfoot N. O'Sullivan J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R855-R857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, some polyadenylation factors are associated with transcription factors and recruit parts of the polyadenylation apparatus to the transcription initiation complex (2Dantonel J.C. Murthy K.G. Manley J.L. Tora L. Nature. 1997; 389: 399-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Polyadenylation is linked to pre-mRNA splicing in a number of ways. For example, interactions between the polyadenylation and splicing machineries are important for the definition of 3′-terminal exons in animal cells (3Lutz C.S. Alwine J.C.

Other interactions help to modulate different processing fates for pre-mRNAs, thus contributing to the scope of alternative splicing and polyadenylation in eukaryotes. The polyadenylation apparatus interacts with the C-terminal domain of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II (5Barilla D. Lee B.A. Proudfoot N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In mammals, the factors involved in this process have been classified according to chromatographic and biochemical behaviors, and termed cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF), 2The abbreviations used are: CPSFcleavage and polyadenylation specificity factorPAPpoly(A) polymeraseCPSF30, CPSF73, CPSF100 and CPSF16030-,73-, 100-, and 160-kDa subunit of CPSF, respectivelyCstFcleavage-stimulatory factorCstF50, CstF64, and CstF7750-, 64-, and 77-kDa subunit of CstF, respectivelyhFiphuman FipMBPmaltose-binding proteinCBDcalmodulin binding domainCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseGSTglutathione S-transferaseRTreverse transcriptionADactivation domainBDbinding domainFUEfar upstream elementNUEnear upstream elementCScleavage/polyadenylation siteCaMVcauliflower mosaic virusMES2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid.2The abbreviations used are: CPSFcleavage and polyadenylation specificity factorPAPpoly(A) polymeraseCPSF30, CPSF73, CPSF100 and CPSF16030-,73-, 100-, and 160-kDa subunit of CPSF, respectivelyCstFcleavage-stimulatory factorCstF50, CstF64, and CstF7750-, 64-, and 77-kDa subunit of CstF, respectivelyhFiphuman FipMBPmaltose-binding proteinCBDcalmodulin binding domainCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseGSTglutathione S-transferaseRTreverse transcriptionADactivation domainBDbinding domainFUEfar upstream elementNUEnear upstream elementCScleavage/polyadenylation siteCaMVcauliflower mosaic virusMES2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid. cleavage-stimulatory factor (CstF), and cleavage factors I and II (CFIm and CFIIm, respectively) (1Proudfoot N. O'Sullivan J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R855-R857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Each of these factors in turn consists of several distinct subunits. With the exception of CFIm (the two subunits of which are not obviously apparent in the yeast proteome), yeast possesses a similar array of polyadenylation factor subunits that form a somewhat different set of chromatographically distinct factors, namely cleavage and polyadenylation factor and cleavage factor I (1Proudfoot N. O'Sullivan J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R855-R857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the enzyme that adds poly(A) (poly(A) polymerase, or PAP) is part of the cleavage and polyadenylation factor in yeast nuclear extracts but fractionates largely as a separate protein in mammalian extracts. Whereas there are differences in the chromatographic behaviors of the complexes in mammals and yeast, most of the functions of the individual subunits seem to be similar. Besides the PAPs, this includes RNA binding by CPSF160, CPSF30, and CstF64 and their yeast counterparts (Yhh1p, Yth1p, and Rna15p, respectively) (11Keller W. Bienroth S. Lang K.M. Christofori G.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4727-4737Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Of particular interest are the protein Fip1p and its human counterpart, hFip1. In yeast, Fip1p appears to be the principal means by which PAP is linked with the rest of the cleavage and polyadenylation factor. Fip1p is the only polyadenylation factor subunit that has been shown to interact with PAP (23Preker P.J. Lingner J. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Keller W. Cell. 1995; 81: 379-389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Fip1p also interacts with Yhh1p, Yth1p, Pfs2p, and RNA14, components of the two major polyadenylation complexes (cleavage and polyadenylation factor and cleavage factor I) in yeast (13Barabino S.M. Hubner W. Jenny A. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Keller W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1703-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 22Preker P.J. Ohnacker M. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Keller W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4727-4737Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The human homolog, hFip1, interacts with PAP and CPSF160 (the mammalian counterpart of Yhh1p) and has been recently recognized as an authentic subunit of CPSF (18Kaufmann I. Martin G. Friedlein A. Langen H. Keller W. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 616-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The yeast and human Fip (factor interacting with poly(A) polymerase) proteins have somewhat contrasting properties; the yeast protein lacks an RNA-binding domain and inhibits the nonspecific activity (24Zhelkovsky A. Helmling S. Moore C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5942-5951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (e.g. activity on RNA substrates that do not possess authentic polyadenylation signals) of PAP, whereas the human Fip1 can bind RNA and stimulates PAP activity (18Kaufmann I. Martin G. Friedlein A. Langen H. Keller W. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 616-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Kaufmann et al. (18Kaufmann I. Martin G. Friedlein A. Langen H. Keller W. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 616-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) have suggested that these contrasting properties may reflect the differing RNA-binding abilities of the two proteins and that the yeast protein, in concert with other components of cleavage and polyadenylation factor, may stimulate PAP much as does the human Fip1. In this light, the functioning of Fip in the two systems may be relatively conserved, serving to promote PAP activity via some sort of tethering to the RNA substrate.Plant polyadenylation signals have been well characterized and found to be distinct in many ways from their mammalian and fungal counterparts (25Hunt A. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 45: 47-60Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 26Rothnie H.M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 43-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, the properties of the plant polyadenylation apparatus are less well understood. Bioinformatic analysis of the Arabidopsis genome indicates that plants possess genes that encode most of the subunits of the mammalian polyadenylation complex. 3Q. Q. Li and A. G. Hunt, unpublished observations.3Q. Q. Li and A. G. Hunt, unpublished observations. Insertions in two of these (encoding homologs of CPSF100 and CPSF73, respectively) lead to embryo lethality (27Meinke D.W. Meinke L.K. Showalter T.C. Schissel A.M. Mueller L.A. Tzafrir I. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 28Xu R. Ye X. Quinn Li Q. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 324: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The Arabidopsis CPSF100 protein interacts with at least one of the four PAPs (29Elliott B.J. Dattaroy T. Meeks-Midkiff L.R. Forbes K.P. Hunt A.G. Plant Mol. Biol. 2003; 51: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), an interaction that seems to be unique to the plant polyadenylation machinery. There is a degree of novelty in the properties of the Arabidopsis homologs of the CstF subunits, in that one of the three proteins (AtCstF50) does not interact with AtCstF77 (30Yao Y. Song L. Katz Y. Galili G. J. Exp. Bot. 2002; 53: 2277-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), in contrast to what has been shown in the mammalian complex (31Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1515-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The CstF64-CstF77 interaction does seem to be evolutionarily conserved (30Yao Y. Song L. Katz Y. Galili G. J. Exp. Bot. 2002; 53: 2277-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis possesses four PAP-encoding genes (32Addepalli B. Meeks L.R. Forbes K.P. Hunt A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1679: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Three of the corresponding PAP isoforms are similar in size to each other, whereas the fourth is much smaller, lacking an obvious nuclear localization signal. An Arabidopsis homolog of the yeast polyadenylation factor subunit Pfs2p (the Arabidopsis protein has been termed FY) has been shown to act in concert with the flower-timing regulatory protein FCA to promote alternative polyadenylation of FCA-encoding RNAs and consequently to regulate flower timing (33Simpson G.G. Dijkwel P.P. Quesada V. Henderson I. Dean C. Cell. 2003; 113: 777-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar).As mentioned above, the yeast and mammalian Fip1 proteins are important bridging factors in the polyadenylation complex, providing links between PAP, RNA, and other multisubunit complexes. These links presumably recruit PAP or stabilize the association of PAP with the apparatus and may contribute to the differential recognition of various RNAs by the 3′-processing machinery. In this report, we present a characterization of an Arabidopsis Fip1 isoform (geneid At5g58040, termed AtFip1(V)). We find that this protein binds RNA; interacts with the Arabidopsis polyadenylation factor subunits AtPAP, AtCstF77, AtCPSF30, AtCFI-25m, and AtPabN1; and stimulates nonspecific PAP activity. The abilities to bind RNA; interact with AtPAP, AtCstF77, and AtCPSF30; and stimulate PAP activity are properties that the AtFip1(V) shares with its human counterpart. The interaction with AtCFIm-25 may also be analogous to a recently reported CFIm-hFip1 interaction (47Venkataraman K. Brown K.M. Gilmartin G.M. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). However, the interaction with AtPabN1 has not been reported in other systems and may reflect a unique aspect of the plant polyadenylation machinery. Taken together, these results indicate that AtFip1(V) coordinates a number of polyadenylation factor subunits with PAP and with RNA.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlant Materials—Arabidopsis thaliana seed was obtained from Lehle Seeds. Seeds were germinated and plants were cultivated in the greenhouse or growth room for 3–4 weeks. Plants were harvested before as well as after the flowering stage. Leaves, stems, and flowers were used for total RNA isolation (see below). Root material was gathered from seedlings that were grown in liquid culture under lights with shaking. 50 ml of germination medium (500 mg of sucrose, 215.5 mg of Murashige and Skoog Basal Medium (Sigma), and 25 mg of MES was inoculated with 30–40 sterilized seeds and grown for 2–3 weeks at room temperature under a 12-h light, 12-h dark cycle. For scoring T-DNA insertion plants, this medium was supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg/ml).PCR Genotyping of Salk T-DNA Lines—The T-DNA insertion line, SALK_087117, was generated by the Salk Institute (available on the World Wide Web at signal.salk.edu/cgi-bin/tdnaexpress), and seed was obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. Seeds from the stock center were germinated, and the plants were allowed to self-fertilize so as to generate a bulk stock of seed. Seeds from this bulked population were germinated, and plants were cultivated in the greenhouse or growth room. DNA from single leaves was extracted using a rapid homogenization plant leaf DNA amplification kit (Cartagen). Extracted DNA was used in a typical PCR (see supplemental materials) with AtFip1(V)-specific primers 5′ GFIP and 3′ INT (Table 1), yielding a 1-kb genomic DNA fragment, and with a combination of AtFip1(V)- and T-DNA-specific primers (AtFip1(V)-specific primer 5′ INT and a T-DNA-specific primer LBb1, yielding a ∼500-bp fragment) for verifying the presence and location of the T-DNA insertion.TABLE 1List of oligonucleotides used for PCR and sequencingGene or usePrimer designationSequence (5′-3′)AtFip1(V)5′FLCCGCATGGAAGAGGACGATGAGTTCGGA5′INTCCCGGATCCGAGTTAGCTGCAGCAACAGGGGCA5′INT1CCCAGATCTGGTTCCGAAGATCGATCATCAAGG3′INTGCGAATTCACCCGAGGGTTCATCCTCATG3′INT1CCCGAATTCTTGATGATCGATCTTCGGAACCTC3′INT2CTAGTTTTGAGGAAATGGATGATG3′FLTTATGCGTATTCCCTCCCTATTCTTACACA5′GWGGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCATGGAAGAGGACGATGAGTTC5′GW1GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCGAGTT AGCTGCAGCA3′GWGGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTATCAACCCGAGGGTTCATCCTC3′GW1GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTATTATGCGTATTCCCTCCCTATTCTTACACA5′GFIPGTCTACTCTGTGCTTAGGAAtCstF505′FLCGCGAATTCATGGGGAATAGTGGAGATTTG5′INTCCAGATCTTTCTTCGACTTCTCCAAAACCACGGCT3′INTGTTATGGTTAGAAGGCCACTTTGCCACTTT3′FLCCGGAATTCTTAAACGGATTCCTTCCAGAACCGAAT5′GWGGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTGGATGGGGAATAGTGGAGATT3′GWGGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCCTTAAACGGATTCCTTCCAGAAAtCstF645′FLGGAGATCTGCCATGGCCATGGCTTCATCATCATCC3′FLCCAGATCTATCGATTGAAGGCTGCATCATGTGG5′GWGGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCATGGCTTCATCATCATCCCA3′GWGGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTAGTGAAGGCTGCATCATGTGGTAtCstF775′FLATGGCTGATAAGTACATCGTCGAG3′INTTTCCAGAAAGTGCTTCTTTCATTC3′FLTTAGCCAGTGCTACCAGAAAGCTCGCCAGA5′GWGGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCATGGCTGATAAGTACATCGTC5′GW1GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCTTAAGCACGTTACCAGTTGA3′GWGGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCTTAGCCAGTGCTACCAGAAAGAtPfs2p5′FLATGTACGCCGGCGGCGATATGCACAGG5′INTAGTGTTTGGGATCTTGCATGGCATCCT3′INTAAGAACATCTCGGGGATTATCTGCAGG3′FLCTACTGATGTTGCTGATTGTTGTTTGG5′GWGGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCATGTACGCCGGCGGCGATATG3′GWGGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTACTACTGATGTTGCTGATTGTTAtPAP(IV)5′MRCCGAGATCTTTCATCATCTTGCATGATATATTGGCT3′MRCCGAGATCTACTGCCGAGGCCTTCGATATCCATTAG5′GWGGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTAATGGTGGGTACTCAAAATTTAGGTGGT3′GWGGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCCTAGCTCTGTCTTCCGACTTCTCCATCAtCFI-255′FLATGGGTGAAGAAGCTCGAGCGTTAGATATGGAG3′FLCATATCTCCATCATGTTGAAGGAGAATTTCGAAAG5′GWGGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCATGGGTGAAGAAGCTCGAGCGTT3′GWGGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTACATATCTCCATCATGTTGAAGGAGAtPABN15′FLCCAGATCTATGCCGGTGCACGATGAGC3′FLCCAGATCTTCAGTACGGTCTGTAGCGCT-DNALBb1GCGTGGACCGCTTGCAACTCaMV RNAs 1, 2, 3T7-STSTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAAACACGCTGAAATCACCAGTCTCTCT 4T7-NUETAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAAAATACTTCTATCAATAAAATTTCT 1, 4CaMV61/80RTCTCGTGTCTGGTTTATATT 3CaMV20/1RAGGAATTAGAAATTTTATTGAT 2CaMV 50/70RTATAAATACAAATACATACTAAGGrbcS-E9 RNAT7-E9TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGTATTATGGCATTGGGAAE9 61-80AAATGTTTGCATATCTCTTA Open table in a new tab RNA Isolation from Arabidopsis and Generation of First Strand cDNA—Total RNA was isolated from Arabidopsis leaves using either an SV Total RNA Isolation Kit (Promega), RNeasy® Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen), or Trizol (Invitrogen), following the manufacturers' instructions. Reverse transcription experiments were conducted using the total RNA, oligo(dT) and Superscript RT II (Invitrogen), oligo(dT) with the ProS-TAR™ Ultra HF RT-PCR system (Stratagene), or random primers using a RETROscript™ First Strand Synthesis kit (Ambion).Isolation and Characterization of Arabidopsis AtFip1(V) cDNAs—cDNAs derived from the Arabidopsis AtFip1(V) gene were isolated by PCR and RT-PCR. Potential Fip1-encoding genes were identified in the Arabidopsis genome (available on the World Wide Web at www.Arabidopsis.org/home.html) with TBLASTN and BLASTP (34Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59138) Google Scholar) using the human and yeast Fip1 amino acid sequences as search queries. Based on the results, primers were designed to amplify the cDNA coding region of the AtFip1(V) gene (Table 1). Various combinations of these primers were used in PCRs with first strand cDNA or with a 3–6-kb cDNA expression library for Arabidopsis (CD4-16; ABRC-DNA Stock Center (35Kieber J.J. Rothenberg M. Roman G. Feldmann K.A. Ecker J.R. Cell. 1993; 72: 427-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1475) Google Scholar)) as templates. PCR products were subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector and sequenced by automated sequencing (ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (ABI prism) and T7 and SP6 primers.Three pGEM clones that represent the 5′-end (bases 1–1478), middle region (bases 1220–2692), and 3′-end (bases 2672–3588) of the full-length coding region, respectively, were generated. Full-length clones were assembled in pGEM using common restriction enzyme sites; the C-terminal domain of AtFip1(V) was amplified and subcloned using full-length cDNAs. One clone containing the 5′-end of AtFip1(V) contained a premature stop codon after residue 137 of the protein, presumably due to a PCR error. This stop codon conveniently delimits the highly divergent part of the N terminus of AtFip1(V) (Fig. 1A); for this reason, it was selected to produce yeast two-hybrid and protein expression clones. Cloning details are provided in supplemental materials.For expression analysis of AtFip1 genes in different Arabidopsis tissues, PCR amplification was done with 1.5 μl of first strand cDNA (ProSTAR; Stratagene) added to 100 ng of each primer, 0.8 mm dNTPs, 5.0 μl of Ultra HF PCR buffer (Stratagene), and 2.5 units of Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) in a 50-μl reaction.Cloning of Arabidopsis cDNAs Encoding Arabidopsis Polyadenylation Factor Subunits—Data base searches of the Arabidopsis genome using TBLASTN and BLASTP with the yeast Pfs2 and human CstF50, -64, and -77 subunits as well as mammalian CFIm-25 and PabN1 as search queries identified potential homologs for each subunit. Based on the sequence information, primers were designed to amplify the cDNA coding regions of these genes (Table 1). Clones were generated by PCR or RT-PCR, subcloned in pGEM, and sequenced. In cases where partial clones were produced, full-length cDNAs were assembled using common restriction enzyme sites. Full-length clones were used to produce yeast two-hybrid and protein expression clones. Cloning details are provided in supplemental materials. Clones encoding the Arabidopsis chromosome IV-encoded PAP have been described elsewhere (32Addepalli B. Meeks L.R. Forbes K.P. Hunt A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1679: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—A Gal4-based two-hybrid system was used as described previously (36James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast strain used was PJ69-4, and the expression vectors were pGAD-C (1Proudfoot N. O'Sullivan J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R855-R857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and pGBD-C (1Proudfoot N. O'Sullivan J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R855-R857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) for activation domain (AD) and binding domain (BD), respectively.Clones encoding the relevant protein-coding regions were cloned into AD and BD expression vectors using Gateway™ cloning technology (Invitrogen). For this, the appropriate coding sequences were amplified by PCR using 5′GW/3′GW primers listed in Table 1 and the amplification products mobilized into pDONR 201 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The various protein-coding regions were then mobilized into Gateway-compatible versions of pGAD-C (1Proudfoot N. O'Sullivan J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R855-R857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and pGBD-C (1Proudfoot N. O'Sullivan J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R855-R857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) (generated as recommended by the manufacturer). The resulting expression clones were sequenced to ensure that the gene fusions were in the correct reading frame. The pGAD-C (1Proudfoot N. O'Sullivan J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R855-R857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and pGBD-C (1Proudfoot N. O'Sullivan J. Curr.

Ruqiang Xu and Quinn Li (Miami University, Oxford, OH).Yeast cells were transformed with plasmid DNA using the polyethylene glycol/lithium acetate method (37Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2877) Google Scholar). Two-hybrid analysis was carried out by plating yeast transformants on defined media containing glucose as a carbon source and lacking the nutritional supplements suited for selection of transformants (leucine and tryptophan) and for identification of interactions (adenine) (LW and ALW medium, respectively). Positive interactions were those in which the colony numbers on ALW medium were 50% or more than those seen on LW medium. Negative interactions were those that yielded less than 10% of the colonies on ALW plates compared with LW medium. With negative controls (e.g. experiments with “empty” two-hybrid vectors as well as those in which one test plasmid was co-transformed with the complementary “empty vector”), the numbers of colonies growing on ALW selective media were invariably less than 2% (and usually 0%) of the numbers seen on LW medium. Positive samples (such as the combination using clones for the Arabidopsis orthologues for CstF77 and CstF64, which have been reported elsewhere to interact (30Yao Y. Song L. Katz Y. Galili G. J. Exp. Bot. 2002; 53: 2277-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and which in our hands is a very strong two-hybrid interaction) yielded, on ALW medium, from 50 to 200% of the colonies seen on LW medium.Production of Recombinant Proteins—To produce recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli, the coding regions for respective AtFip1(V)-derived proteins were mobilized into pDEST15 and pDEST17 using LR Clonase and the respective entry clones (see above). This would enable the production of GST- or histidine-tagged proteins, respectively. In addition, AtCstF77, AtCPSF30, and AtPabN1 were subcloned into pMAL-C2x (New England Biolabs) so as to produce maltose-binding protein fusions. AtCFIm-25 was cloned into a Gateway-converted form of pCal-kc (Stratagene), using the corresponding Gateway-compatible entry clone and LR Clonase. The resulting recombinant plasmids were introduced into Rosetta(D3) cells (Novagen) for the production of protein.Extracts containing the appropriate fusion protein were prepared after induction of Rosetta(D3) cells (Novagen). Briefly, overnight 10-ml cultures of LB(+) (LB plus 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol) were used to inoculate 200 ml of LB(+) media, and cells were grown at 37 °C until an A600 of 1.0–1.2. Expression of the fusion protein genes was then induced by the addition of 200 μl of 1 m isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After additional growth for 2 h at 37 °C, cells were harvested and resuspended in 5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were disrupted by sonication (three bursts, 30 s each), and debris was removed by centrifugation. Extracts were stored as 1-ml aliquots at –80 °C.To produce the histidine-tagged FipN protein, extracts were prepared after induction of Rosetta(D3) cells (Novagen) containing recombinant pDEST-17 construct. Cells were grown, and expression was induced as described above. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 5 ml of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole). Cell"
https://openalex.org/W2118016512,"UvrB, the ultimate damage-binding protein in bacterial nucleotide excision repair is capable of binding a vast array of structurally unrelated lesions. A β-hairpin structure in the protein plays an important role in damage-specific binding. In this paper we have monitored DNA conformational alterations in the UvrB-DNA complex, using the fluorescent adenine analogue 2-aminopurine. We show that binding of UvrB to a DNA fragment with cholesterol damage moves the base adjacent to the lesion at the 3′ side into an extrahelical position. This extrahelical base is not accessible for acrylamide quenching, suggesting that it inserts into a pocket of the UvrB protein. Also the base opposite this flipped base is extruded from the DNA helix. The degree of solvent exposure of both residues varies with the type of cofactor (ADP/ATP) bound by UvrB. Fluorescence of the base adjacent to the damage is higher when UvrB is in the ADP-bound configuration, but concomitantly this UvrB-DNA complex is less stable. In the ATP-bound form the UvrB-DNA complex is very stable and in this configuration the base in the non-damaged strand is more exposed. Hairpin residue Tyr-95 is specifically involved in base flipping in the non-damaged strand. We present evidence that this conformational change in the non-damaged strand is important for 3′ incision by UvrC.

Also the base opposite this flipped base is extruded from the DNA helix. The degree of solvent exposure of both residues varies with the type of cofactor (ADP/ATP) bound by UvrB. Fluorescence of the base adjacent to the damage is higher when UvrB is in the ADP-bound configuration, but concomitantly this UvrB-DNA complex is less stable. In the ATP-bound form the UvrB-DNA complex is very stable and in this configuration the base in the non-damaged strand is more exposed. Hairpin residue Tyr-95 is specifically involved in base flipping in the non-damaged strand. We present evidence that this conformational change in the non-damaged strand is important for 3′ incision by UvrC. DNA is constantly being threatened by various damaging agents, which can be either exogenous (chemicals or irradiation) or endogenous (reactive metabolites). If left unrepaired the damage could lead to mutations or cell death and therefore several repair mechanisms have evolved to avoid these effects. One of these mechanisms, nucleotide excision repair (NER) 2The abbreviations used are: NER, nucleotide excision repair; 2-AP, 2-aminopurine; CK, creatine kinase; CP, creatine phosphate; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); wt, wild type; AU, arbitrary units. 2The abbreviations used are: NER, nucleotide excision repair; 2-AP, 2-aminopurine; CK, creatine kinase; CP, creatine phosphate; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); wt, wild type; AU, arbitrary units. is characterized by the unique feature that it is able to recognize and repair a large variety of structural different damages (1Friedberg E.C. Walker W. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. America Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). In bacteria, NER is initiated by three different proteins: UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC (reviewed in Refs. 2Goosen N. Moolenaar G.F. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar and 3Van Houten B. Croteau D.L. DellaVecchia M.J. Wang H. Kisker C. Mutat. Res. 2005; 577: 92-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). First UvrA and UvrB form a complex in solution, which is able to search the DNA for possible damage (4Orren D.K. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15796-15803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Once damage has been found, UvrA leaves the complex resulting in a UvrB-DNA preincision complex. Atomic force microscopy (5Verhoeven E.E.A. Wyman C. Moolenaar G.F. Goosen N. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4196-4205Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and bandshift analysis (23Moolenaar G.F. Schut M. Goosen N. DNA Repair. 2005; 4: 699-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) of this complex have shown that it contains two UvrB molecules, with one monomer bound to the damaged site and the second monomer more loosely associated. The role of this second UvrB subunit in the repair reaction, however, still needs to be determined. UvrC subsequently binds to the preincision complex, thereby releasing the loosely associated UvrB subunit (5Verhoeven E.E.A. Wyman C. Moolenaar G.F. Goosen N. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4196-4205Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 23Moolenaar G.F. Schut M. Goosen N. DNA Repair. 2005; 4: 699-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Next UvrC will make the incisions in the DNA. First an incision is made at the 4th or 5th phosphodiester bond 3′ to the damage (6Sancar A. Rupp D. Cell. 1983; 33: 249-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 7Verhoeven E.E.A. van Kesteren M. Moolenaar G.F. Visse R. Goosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5120-5123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), which is then followed by an incision at the 8th phosphodiester bond 5′ to the damage (8Lin J.J. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17688-17692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′ incision is often followed by an extra incision seven nucleotides 5′ to the original 5′ incision, which has been shown to be the result of recognition of the 5′ nick by UvrB (9Moolenaar G.F. Bazuine M. van Knippenberg I.C. Visse R. Goosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34896-34903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The resulting oligonucleotide is removed by UvrD after which PolI fills in the gap and ligase closes the nick in the DNA. In some bacterial species like Escherichia coli a second NER-specific nuclease is present (Cho) that can induce a 3′ incision at the 9th phosphodiester bond 3′ to the damage and is believed to serve as a back-up system for UvrC (10Moolenaar G.F. van Rossum-Fikkert S. van Kesteren M. Goosen N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1467-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). During the NER reaction ATP binding and hydrolysis by UvrA and UvrB play multiple roles. Each of the two UvrA monomers contains two ATPase sites. The precise role of these ATPase sites in damage detection is still unknown, but it has been shown that ATP hydrolysis by UvrA is essential for dissociation from non-damaged sites (11Thiagalingam S. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11395-11403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thereby playing an important role in the initial screening for potential damage. The UvrB protein contains one ATPase site and the ATP hydrolysis in this site becomes activated by UvrA and (damaged) DNA (12Seeley T.W. Grossman L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6577-6581Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). AFM studies revealed that ATP binding by UvrB promotes wrapping of the DNA around one of the UvrB monomers, both in UvrA2B2 complexes in search of a damage and in UvrB2 complexes bound to a damaged site (5Verhoeven E.E.A. Wyman C. Moolenaar G.F. Goosen N. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4196-4205Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 13Verhoeven E.E.A. Wyman C. Moolenaar G.F. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Goosen N. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 601-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity of UvrB has been shown to be associated with strand destabilization activity (14Gordienko I. Rupp W.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 15Moolenaar G.F. Visse R. Ortiz-Buysse M. Goosen N. van de Putte P. J. Mol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 51574-51580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), which is most likely used to distort the DNA at a lesion to facilitate damage-specific binding. After the ATPase mediated loading of UvrB on the damaged site a new ATP molecule needs to be bound to form a productive preincision complex that can subsequently be processed by UvrC (17Moolenaar G.F. Pena Herron F. Monaco V. van der Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Visse R. Goosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8044-8050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of UvrB from Baccillus caldotenax (18Theis K. Chen P.J. Skorvaga M. Van Houten B. Kisker C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6899-6907Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and Thermus thermophilus (19Machius M. Henry L. Palnitkar M. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11717-11722Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 20Nakagawa N. Sugahara M. Masui R. Kato R. Fukuyama K. Kuramitsu S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 986-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) reveal a prominent feature of UvrB: a flexible β-hairpin containing a number of highly conserved aromatic residues at its base and tip. Removing the tip of the hairpin produces a protein that is unable to form a stable preincision complex (21Skorvaga M. Theis K. Mandavilli B.S. Kisker C. Van Houten B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1553-1559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A “padlock model “ for DNA binding by UvrB was proposed, where the β-hairpin inserts itself between the two strands of the DNA, clamping one of the strands between the β-hairpin and domain 1b of the protein (18Theis K. Chen P.J. Skorvaga M. Van Houten B. Kisker C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6899-6907Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In addition to many different types of base alterations, UvrB has also been shown to efficiently recognize a one-nucleotide gap in the DNA (22Moolenaar G.F. Höglund L. Goosen N. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6140-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). From this observation a model for damage recognition was proposed where UvrB probes the DNA for the presence of damage by trying to flip bases out of the DNA helix. Lesion-induced alterations in base stacking would facilitate this base flipping and a one-nucleotide gap would mimic such a flipped configuration. Substitution of residues Tyr-92 and Tyr-93 at the base of the β-hairpin with alanine leads to UvrB proteins that are lethal to the cell because of stable binding to non-damaged sites (22Moolenaar G.F. Höglund L. Goosen N. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6140-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 23Moolenaar G.F. Schut M. Goosen N. DNA Repair. 2005; 4: 699-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This could also be explained by the base flipping model for damage recognition. In the absence of damage, flipping is prevented because the non-damaged base is held in place by stacking interactions with its neighbors. This subsequently results in a sterical clashing with Tyr-92 and Tyr-93 and dissociation of UvrB from the DNA. When damage is present the damaged base can be flipped out of the DNA helix and residues Tyr-92 and Tyr-93 occupy the vacated space (22Moolenaar G.F. Höglund L. Goosen N. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6140-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Base flipping is not uncommon in DNA repair, because co-crystal structures of uracil-DNA glycosylase (24Slupphaug G. Mol C.D. Kavli B. Arvai A.S. Krokan H.E. Tainer J.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), alkyladenine glycosylase (25Lau A.Y. Wyatt M.D. Glassner B.J. Samson L.D. Ellenberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13573-13578Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase (26Bruner S.D. Norman D.P. Verdine G.L. Nature. 2000; 403: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar), and photolyase (27Mees A. Klar T. Gnau P. Hennecke U. Eker A.P.M. Carell T. Essen L.O. Science. 2004; 306: 1789-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) have shown that the damaged base exists in an extrahelical position. Flipping, however, is not solely confined to the damaged nucleotide, because in the co-crystal structure of T4 endonuclease V it was shown that it is not the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer lesion itself, but a adenine opposing the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer that becomes extrahelical (28Vassylyev D.G. Kashiwagi T. Mikami Y. Ariyoshi M. Iwai S. Ohtsuka E. Morikawa K. Cell. 1995; 83: 773-782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In this study we have probed changes in the helical structure induced by the UvrB protein using the fluorescent adenine analogue 2-aminopurine (2-AP). 2-Aminopurine can be incorporated in the DNA using automated synthesis and gives only minimal distortion to the DNA if paired with a thymine with which it can form a Watson-Crick-type base pair (29Sowers L.C. Fazakerley G.V. Eritja R. Kaplan B.E. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5434-5438Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Excitation of 2-AP with light at a wavelength around 310 nm results in an emission of about 370 nm. In a double-stranded DNA fragment this fluorescence is significantly quenched by base stacking interactions and therefore 2-AP can be used as a spectroscopic probe for base flipping (30Allan B.W. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14757-14762Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Examples of studies where 2-AP has been used to demonstrate base flipping can be found for DNA photolyase (31Christine K.S. MacFarlane IV, A.W. Yang K. Stanley R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38339-38344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), methyltransferases (30Allan B.W. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14757-14762Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 32Holz B. Klimasaukas S. Serva S. Weinhold E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), T4 endonuclease V (33McCullough A.K. Dodson M.L. Schärer O.D. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27210-27217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and T7 RNA polymerase (34Bandwar R.P. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14075-14082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We show that binding of UvrB to a DNA fragment with a cholesterol lesion forces the base adjacent to the lesion at the 3′ side in an extrahelical position. Also the nucleotide opposite this flipped base is extruded from the DNA helix in the UvrB-DNA complex. UvrB mutants with substitutions in the β-hairpin revealed that residues Tyr-92 and Tyr-93 are not needed for the observed base flipping. Residue Tyr-95 appears to be specifically involved in flipping the base in the non-damaged strand and this base flipping seems to be required for the 3′ incision by UvrC. Proteins and DNA Fragments—The plasmid expressing the UvrB mutant (Y92A/Y93A) has been described (22Moolenaar G.F. Höglund L. Goosen N. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6140-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The plasmids expressing UvrB(K45A), UvrB(Y95A), and UvrB(Y96A) were constructed in a similar way using site-directed mutagenesis. All plasmid constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Mutant UvrB630 lacks the 43 C-terminal amino acids (37Moolenaar G.F. Franken C.L.M.C. Dijkstra D.M. Thomas-Oates J.E. Visse R. van de Putte P. Goosen N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 6736-6742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Cho (10Moolenaar G.F. van Rossum-Fikkert S. van Kesteren M. Goosen N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1467-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) proteins were purified as described. The 50-bp DNA substrates used in this study were obtained commercially (Eurogentec) and are shown in Fig. 1. Creatine kinase (CK) was obtained from Roche Diagnostics. Chemicals—Creatine Phosphate (CP), ADP (containing <1% ATP), ATP (containing <0.5% ADP), and ATPγS (containing <10% ADP) were obtained from Roche. Incision Assay—The DNA fragments were labeled at the 5′ side of the top strand using polynucleotide kinase as described (35Visse R. de Ruijter M. Moolenaar G.F. van de Putte P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6736-6742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA substrates (0.2 nm) were incubated with 2.5 nm UvrA, 100 nm UvrB, and 25 nm UvrC or Cho in 20 μl of Uvr-endo buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm ATP). After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min the reactions were terminated by using 3 μl of EDTA/SDS (0.33 m EDTA, 3.3% SDS) and 2.4 μl of glycogen (4 μg/μl) followed by ethanol precipitation. The incision products were visualized on a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Gel Retardation Assay—The 5′ terminally labeled DNA substrates (0.2 nm) were incubated with 1.25 nm UvrA and 100 nm UvrB in 10 μl of Uvr-endo buffer for 10 min at 37 °C. The mixtures were analyzed on a cooled 3.5% native polyacrylamide gel containing 1 mm ATP and 10 mm MgCl2 in 1× Tris borate/EDTA as described (35Visse R. de Ruijter M. Moolenaar G.F. van de Putte P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6736-6742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine UvrB binding under conditions used for the 2-aminopurine measurement the same amount of 5′ terminally labeled DNA substrate (tracer) was mixed with 0.5 μm unlabeled DNA substrate. The proteins (0.45 μm UvrA, 3.75 μm UvrB, and 0.17 μg/μl CK) were incubated with the DNA in 10 μl of Uvr-endo buffer (without bovine serum albumin) for 10 min at 37 °C in the presence of 10 or 20 mm CP, after which they were loaded on a 3.5% native gel as described above. To follow UvrB complex formation in time, the same incubation conditions were used and the reaction was terminated at different time points by putting the incubations on ice. 2-Aminopurine Fluorescence Measurements—60-μl samples containing 0.5 μm DNA, 0.45 μm UvrA, 3.75 μm UvrB, and 0.17 μg/μl CK were incubated in Uvr-endo buffer (without bovine serum albumin) for 10 min at 37 °C in the presence of 10 or 20 mm CP as indicated. Where indicated 300 mm acrylamide was added to the sample after the incubation. The sample was transferred to a 3 × 3-mm quartz cuvette and placed in the cuvette holder of the fluorimeter. Fluorescence emission spectra were obtained using a PerkinElmer LS 50B fluorimeter, which was connected to a temperature variable water bath to maintain a temperature inside the cuvette of 37 °C. The excitation wavelength was set at 310 nm, and spectra were obtained by scanning from 325 to 475-nm emission wavelengths. The excitation and emission slit widths were 5 and 10 nm, respectively. Spectra were corrected for background fluorescence by subtracting the spectrum obtained from the buffer. The free 2-aminopurine signal was obtained by measuring 0.5 μm 2-aminopurine riboside-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (BioLog) in 60 μl of Uvr-endo buffer at 37 °C. For the time-dependent fluorescence measurements, proteins and DNA were mixed and immediately put in the cuvette after which emission at 370 nm was recorded over a 1-h period. For testing the influence of the cofactor on fluorescence, 3 mm ADP, ATP, or ATPγS were added to the mixture (which initially contained 1 mm ATP) at different time points as indicated. 2-AP Does Not Influence UvrB Binding—For the fluorescence experiments, 2-AP was incorporated at specific positions in the top and bottom strands of a 50-bp substrate containing a cholesterol lesion. Because the 2-AP base pairs with dT, two different DNA sequences were used (I and VI, see Fig. 1). Four DNAs were prepared (substrates II-V) in which the individual four adenines flanking the cholesterol lesion in substrate I were substituted with 2-AP (Fig. 1A). The three other DNA substrates (VII-IX) have three individual adenines opposite the lesion in substrate VI replaced with 2-AP (Fig. 1B). As a control we also made a DNA fragment (substrate X) with a 2-AP without the cholesterol (Fig. 1C). First we tested whether the presence of the 2-AP base influences UvrABC incision of the DNA fragments. The 2-AP base itself is not recognized as damaged by the Uvr proteins, because substrate X with only the 2-AP does not show significant incision (Fig. 2A). The incisions of substrate I (without 2-AP) and the same DNA fragments with the 2-AP substitutions (II-V) are very similar (Fig. 2A). Likewise the incisions of substrate VI (without 2-AP) and the derivatives containing 2-AP (VII-IX) are also comparable (Fig. 2B). The overall incisions of the substrate VI derivatives, however, are significantly lower (50%) than those of the substrate I derivatives (>90%). Because of this lower incision the extra 5′ incision is hardly observed with the substrate VI derivatives. It has been shown before that the sequence context of the lesion can influence the efficiency by which UvrC incises the DNA (36Verhoeven E.E.A. van Kesteren M. Turner J.J. van der Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Moolenaar G.F. Goosen N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2492-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To confirm also that in this case the difference in incision is caused by UvrC and not by a difference in UvrB binding, we repeated the incisions of substrates I and VI using the Cho nuclease instead of UvrC (Fig. 2C). Indeed now both DNA sequences are very efficiently incised, indicating also that UvrB binding is very efficient. To test UvrB binding more directly we also performed a bandshift analysis on the different substrates with or without 2-AP. Fig. 3, A and B, shows that the amount of UvrB-DNA complex is similar for all substrates, indicating that 2-AP does not significantly alter formation or stability of these complexes. As expected no UvrB-DNA complexes are formed on substrate X with only the 2-AP and no damage (Fig. 3A). Setting Up the Conditions for 2-AP Fluorescence Measurement—To obtain a significant fluorescence signal of 2-AP, a DNA concentration of 0.5-1 μm is needed (30Allan B.W. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14757-14762Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 31Christine K.S. MacFarlane IV, A.W. Yang K. Stanley R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38339-38344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 32Holz B. Klimasaukas S. Serva S. Weinhold E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 33McCullough A.K. Dodson M.L. Schärer O.D. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27210-27217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 34Bandwar R.P. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14075-14082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This is significantly higher than the DNA concentrations used in the incision and DNA binding assays described above. Therefore we first needed to determine the optimal protein concentration for formation of the UvrB-DNA complex at these high DNA concentrations. The concentrations of UvrA (from 0.045 to 0.45 μm) and UvrB (0.95 to 7.5 μm) were varied, but for both substrates I and VI the amount of UvrB-DNA complexes obtained with 0.5 μm DNA remained significantly lower compared with the complexes formed with 0.2 nm DNA (not shown). Searching for and binding to DNA damage involves ATP hydrolysis by UvrA and UvrB. Therefore at high protein and DNA concentrations the amount of ATP might become limiting and the ADP formed might “poison “ the proteins. To prevent this we included an ATP-regenerating system in our incubation mixture consisting of CK and CP. With this ATP-regenerating system incubation of 0.5 μm DNA with 0.45 μm UvrA and 3.75 μm UvrB leads to a substantial amount of UvrB-DNA complexes (Fig. 3C). Note that these complexes migrate at the position of the UvrB dimer. It has been shown before (23Moolenaar G.F. Schut M. Goosen N. DNA Repair. 2005; 4: 699-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) that the second UvrB subunit, which is more loosely associated with the complex, dissociates during electrophoresis at low UvrB concentration (resulting in monomer complexes in Fig. 3, A and B) but is stabilized at high UvrB concentration (resulting in dimer complexes in Fig. 3C). All 2-AP containing substrates gave similar UvrB-DNA complexes with these same incubation conditions (not shown). Base Flipping at the 3′ Side of the Damage—The fluorescence spectrum of free 2-AP shows a very strong peak at 370 nm (Fig. 4A). When incorporated in double-stranded DNA without a lesion (substrate X) the fluorescence is almost completely quenched (Fig. 4B). Quenching is less when the 2-AP containing DNA is in the single-stranded form (Fig. 4B), but fluorescence is still much lower than the free 2-AP. For each of the 2-AP containing damaged substrates four different emission spectra were made: (a) the double-stranded DNA without proteins; (b) the DNA with UvrA alone; (c) the DNA with UvrA + UvrB; and (d) the corresponding 2-AP containing single-stranded DNA. All spectra were recorded at least twice and typically deviated from their mean peak value by no more than 5%. Measurements of the proteins in the absence of DNA did not result in any significant fluorescence signal (results not shown). First we will consider the effect of the lesion on the fluorescence of the individual 2-APs in the double-stranded DNA of substrate I derivatives (2-AP in the damaged strand). For substrates III and V, fluorescence is comparably low as for substrate X without damage (Fig. 4, compare D, F with B). Apparently the cholesterol lesion does not significantly alter the conformation of bases at positions -2 and +2 with respect to the damage. For the 2-APs at position -1 (substrate IV) and +1 (substrate II) the damage does influence the conformation. In particular, the 2-AP immediately 5′ to the damage shows a significant fluorescence (Fig. 4E), indicating a perturbation in base stacking. The effect on the 2-AP 3′ to the damage is also detectable, but less pronounced (Fig. 4C). Addition of UvrA alone to DNAs II-V does not result in significant change in fluorescence of any of these substrates (Fig. 4, C-F). In particular, for positions +1 and +2 it is clear that 2-AP fluorescence is higher in the free single-stranded DNA than in the UvrA-bound double-stranded fragment (Fig. 4, C and D). This might indicate that damage binding by UvrA does not cause significant base pair disruption at the 3′ side of the damage. On the other hand the amount of damage-specific UvrA-DNA complexes might be too low (see Fig. 3) to be able to detect any UvrA-induced conformational changes. When UvrA + UvrB are included in the incubation, allowing formation of the UvrB-DNA complex, a considerable change in 2-AP fluorescence at the 3′ side of the damage is observed. For the 2-AP at position +1 (substrate II) UvrB binding results in a fluorescence level that is a factor of three higher than the level of the corresponding single-stranded DNA (Fig. 4C). The signal of this 2-AP in the UvrB-DNA complex is about 50% of the signal of a comparable concentration of the free 2-AP base (Fig. 4A). This very high fluorescence can only be explained by UvrB-induced base flipping, thereby removing the stacking interactions between 2-AP and its neighbors. The 2-AP at position +2 (substrate III) also shows a significant increase in fluorescence upon binding of UvrB (Fig. 4D). In this case the signal is a factor of two higher than the signal of the corresponding single-stranded DNA again indicating that quenching is reduced by destacking of the 2-AP base. This can be caused by a direct effect of the UvrB protein on the base at the +2 position. Alternatively the enhanced fluorescence of substrate III might merely reflect the base flipping at position +1, because base flipping at +1 is expected to reduce quenching at position +2. At the 5′ side of the damage, no significant change in fluorescence upon UvrB binding is observed. Fluorescence of substrate V remains very low, showing that in the UvrB-DNA complex the 2-AP at position -2 is fully stacked (Fig. 4F). Also the fluorescence of 2-AP at position -1 does not change upon UvrB binding (substrate IV, Fig. 4E). Because fluorescence of this residue was already higher in the free DNA, as a result of destacking by the damage, this might indicate that the position of the damage does not change in the UvrB-DNA complex. Base Flipping in the Non-damaged Strand—Fluorescence of the three individual 2-APs opposite the damage is significantly increased compared with the non-damaged substrate, indicating a perturbation of all three residues by the damage itself (Fig. 4, G-I). The effect is most significant in substrates VIII and IX, because the fluorescence signals of these double-stranded fragments are higher than the corresponding single-stranded DNAs (Fig. 4, H and I). Apparently the bases directly opposite the lesion and at -1 are partly pushed out of the helix by the cholesterol moiety. Binding of UvrA again does not give a significant change in fluorescence of the different 2-APs. Upon binding of"

Key genes for all three pathways are regulated by negative feedback control. Uptake and biosynthesis are directly regulated by cholesterol through its inhibition of the proteolytic activation of the sterol regulatory element binding proteins. The conversion of cholesterol into bile acids in the liver is regulated through the bile acid-dependent induction of the negatively acting small heterodimer partner nuclear receptor. In this report, we have shown that the small heterodimer partner also directly regulates cholesterol biosynthesis through inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase but has no effect on low density lipoprotein receptor expression. This has significant metabolic significance, as it provides both a mechanism to independently regulate cholesterol synthesis from uptake (an essential regulatory feature known to occur in vivo) and a pathway for direct regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis by bile acids. This latter feature ensures that the early phase of bile acid synthesis (pre-cholesterol) is in metabolic communication with the later stages of the pathway to properly regulate whole pathway flux. This highlights an important regulatory feature that is shared with other key branched, multienzyme pathways, such as glycolysis, where pathway outflow through pyruvate kinase is regulated by the concentration of a key early intermediate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.

In the mammalian liver, cholesterol serves as a precursor in the synthesis of bile acids and as metabolite flow increases through the cholesterol pathway, bile acid production is increased. Bile acids act as feedback regulators of their biosynthesis by inhibiting the nuclear receptor-dependent activation of key bile acid biosynthetic target genes (1Russell D.W. Annu. Rev.

SHP lacks a DNA binding domain but interacts with the carboxyl-terminal activation domain of other DNA-bound nuclear receptors and inhibits their activity. The best documented target of SHP repression is the LRH-1/FTF nuclear receptor, which binds DNA as a monomer and activates expression of the bile acid biosynthetic genes CYP7A1 (2Lu T.T. Makishima M.

Cholesterol is an essential component of mammalian membranes, and its production is tightly controlled through the negative effects of cholesterol directly on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins SREBPs and HMG-CoA reductase (5Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3838) Google Scholar). As cholesterol accumulates, SREBP trafficking to and proteolytic activation in the Golgi are repressed, and the proteolytic release and subsequent degradation of HMG-CoA reductase from the endoplasmic reticular membrane is enhanced. The net effect is a decrease in both enzyme levels and metabolite flow through the pathway. This regulatory process is common to all mammalian cells. However, bile acid production from cholesterol is unique to the mammalian liver, and it has been known for decades that bile acid feeding results in a similar down-regulation of cholesterol production in this organ (6Shefer S. Hauser S. Lapar V. Mosbach E.H. J. Lipid Res. 1973; 13: 573-580Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Traditionally, this has been attributed to the indirect effect that bile acids have through inhibiting CYP7A1, which would result in an increase in cholesterol followed by the predictable decline in mature SREBPs and HMG-CoA reductase activity. Because the pathway leading to cholesterol in the liver corresponds to the “early” steps of bile acid synthesis, it would be more efficacious if a mechanism for the direct regulation of the early steps of the pathway directly through bile acids had evolved. In the current report, we present evidence supporting a direct mechanism for regulating cholesterol production by bile acids through the LRH-1/FTF and SHP nuclear receptors. We show that LRH-1/FTF activates and SHP represses HMG-CoA reductase transcription specifically, with no effect on LDL receptor expression. Overall, these studies define both a mechanism to independently regulate cholesterol synthesis from uptake, a key regulatory feature that has been documented in prior whole animal studies by Dietschy and co-workers (7Spady D.K. Turley S.D. Dietschy J.M. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 465-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, these results also reveal a pathway for direct regulation of an early step in cholesterol biosynthesis by bile acids. This latter feature ensures that the early phase of bile acid synthesis (pre-cholesterol) is in metabolic communication with the later stages of the pathway to properly regulate whole pathway flux. FLAG-tagged LRH-1/FTF and AF2 Domain Deletion (ΔAF-2)—PCR oligos containing EcoRI and XbaI restriction enzyme sites were used to amplify human FTF (1–500 amino acids) from pCI FTF (a gift from Dr. Gregorio Gil, Virginia Medical College). A PCR oligo including base pairs to amino acid 466 of FTF along with the wild-type amino-terminal oligo were used to construct the AF-2 domain mutant.

Chem. 2005; 280: 3338-3345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). 293T cells were plated in normal medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum plus penicillin/streptomycin and glutamine) on day 0 at 450,000 cells/60-mm dish. On day 1, the cells were transfected with the appropriate plasmid construct along with a constant amount of CMV-β-galactosidase expression plasmid. The cells were washed twice with 1× phosphate-buffered saline on day 2 and refed with normal medium. On day 4, the cells were harvested into nuclear and cytoplasmic extract as described previously (13Datta S. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3338-3345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of total protein normalized for transfection efficiency using co-transfected CMV-β-galactosidase expression were analyzed by an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. Expression of specific proteins was detected by an antibody to the indicated epitope tag present. Promoter Activation Studies—293T cells were plated on day 0 in normal medium at 350,000 cells/well of a 6-well plate. On day 1, the cells were transfected with luciferase reporter and protein expression plasmids by calcium phosphate co-precipitation. A CMV-β-galactosidase expression construct was included in every transfection as a normalization control. 5 h post-transfection, the cells were washed twice with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and new medium added. For transfections using exogenously expressed SREBPs, the cells were refed with normal medium as described above. For transfections using endogenously expressed SREBPs, cells were refed with either induced medium (defined serum-free medium from Invitrogen), or suppressed medium (induced medium containing 12 μg/ml cholesterol and 1 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol) to suppress SREBP activity. 12 h after refeeding, the cells were harvested using cell lysis buffer (13Datta S. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3338-3345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and cell extracts were used to measure activity for luciferase and β-galactosidase. Recombinant FTF Protein Purification—Escherichia coli cells expressing glutathione S-transferase-FTF (4del Castillo-Olivares A. Gil G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4035-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) were grown at 37 °C to an OD of 0.6 and then induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3 h. The cells were harvested by sonication in NETN buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40), and the soluble lysate was fractionated over a glutathione-agarose column and eluted with 10 mm glutathione. FTF protein fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining, pooled, and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 50 mm KCl. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Single-stranded DNA oligos containing the potential FTF site at –300 were annealed for 1 h at 65 °C and then end-labeled with 32P for 1 h at 37 °C. Purified FTF protein (25 ng) was incubated with 0.2 pmol of labeled HMG-CoA reductase probe on ice for 20 min and loaded onto a 5% acrylamide gel and run in 1× Tris borate-EDTA for 1–2 h. The gel was fixed for half an hour in 10% (v/v) acetic acid and 10% (v/v) methanol, dried, and then exposed to film. For competition experiments, purified FTF protein (25 ng) was incubated on ice for 15 min with cold probe containing the indicated DNA sequence in 50- or 200-fold molar excess of 32P-labeled HMG-CoA reductase probe. Labeled HMG-CoA reductase probe (0.2 pmol) was then added to the reactions, followed by a further incubation on ice for an additional 20 min. The reactions were loaded onto gels as described above. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Analysis—Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed essentially as previously described (14Bennett M. Toth J.I. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37360-37367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with the following minor modifications. 293T cells were transfected with an expression plasmid for Myc-tagged LRH-1 by Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). 5 h post-transfection, the cells were refed with defined serum-free medium as described above (minus sterols) to induce SREBP expression for 24 h. Formaldehyde cross-linking (1% (v/v)) was done for 9 min. After processing, the sonicated chromatin was obtained as described previously (14Bennett M. Toth J.I. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37360-37367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and samples were preincubated with protein A-agarose beads and purified mouse IgG (50 μg) for 1 h at 4°C on a rotator. Nonspecifically bound material was removed by pelleting the agarose beads, and supernatant fractions were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 50 μg of anti-LRH-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology catalog number SC-25389x) for the +Ab sample or 50 μg of purified mouse IgG for the –Ab sample, followed by incubation with blocked protein A beads for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotator. After washing and reversing the cross-linking (14Bennett M. Toth J.I. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37360-37367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the samples were analyzed by PCR. For the PCRs, 5 μl of DNA from the LRH-1 precipitation was used, and PCR oligonucleotides that amplify a 250-bp fragment from the human HMG-CoA reductase or a 120-bp fragment from the human LDL receptor promoter were used, respectively. Amplification reactions were performed in triplicate at 30 cycles and monitored for amplification to ensure that the signals were in the linear range of the PCR. To analyze specific immunoprecipitation of Myc-tagged LRH-1, an immunoblot using an anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology catalog number SC-40) was performed on the material recovered after each immunoprecipitation. Previous studies showed that bile acid-dependent inhibition of CYP7A1 is compromised in SHP–/– mice (12Wang L. Lee Y.-K. Bundman D. Han Y. Thevananther S. Kim C-S. Chur S.S. Wei P. Heyman R.A.

Moore D.D. Auwerx J. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 1408-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). Additionally, one of these studies also provided evidence that bile acid-dependent regulation of cholesterol metabolic genes, such as HMG-CoA reductase and the LDL receptor, might also be altered in SHP–/– mice (12Wang L. Lee Y.-K. Bundman D. Han Y. Thevananther S. Kim C-S. Chur S.S. Wei P. Heyman R.A. Karin M. Moore D.D. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 721-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). To more directly evaluate the effect of SHP on HMG-CoA reductase and LDL receptor gene expression, we compared their mRNA levels in wild-type and SHP–/– mice fed diets with and without cholic acid (CA) supplementation. The results in Fig. 1A demonstrate that treatment of wild-type mice with CA reduced the expression of mRNAs for both HMG-CoA reductase and the LDL receptor. Interestingly, in animals fed a normal chow diet, there was an increase in HMG-CoA reductase mRNA in SHP–/– compared with wild-type mice, and the suppression by CA feeding was blunted in the SHP–/– animals. In contrast, expression and CA suppression of LDL receptor mRNA were indistinguishable in wild-type and SHP–/– mice. These data suggest that SHP specifically inhibits expression of HMG-CoA reductase but not the LDL receptor. Bile acid feeding induces SHP through the bile acid-activated nuclear receptor FXR, but bile acids also have pleiotropic effects. Therefore, to more directly evaluate SHP and FXR in the regulation of HMG-CoA reductase, we analyzed the effects of a synthetic FXR agonist on HMG-CoA reductase and LDL receptor expression in wild-type and SHP–/– mice (Fig. 1B). In wild-type animals, the synthetic FXR agonist GW4064 decreased HMG-CoA reductase expression, but the effect was lost in the SHP–/– animals (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 1, 2 and 5, 6 with lanes 3, 4 and 7, 8). In contrast, the FXR agonist had no effect on the expression of LDL receptor mRNA in either wild-type or SHP–/– animals. As an additional control, similar administration of a synthetic agonist for retinoid X receptor LG00268 had no effect on mRNA levels for either HMG-CoA reductase or the LDL receptor (lanes 9–12). These results suggest that SHP specifically inhibits HMG-CoA reductase expression. For known SHP target genes, such as CYP7A1 and CYP8B1, inhibition occurs by interfering with the activation by the nuclear receptor LRH-1/FTF. To determine whether a similar mechanism was functioning for HMG-CoA reductase, we first evaluated whether LRH-1/FTF could bind to the endogenous HMG-CoA reductase promoter in cellular chromatin using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. An LRH-1 expression vector was transfected into 293 cells, and formaldehyde cross-linked chromatin was treated with control IgG or with an antibody to LRH-1. The LRH-1 antibody did precipitate the LRH-1 protein specifically (immunoblot in Fig. 2), and the DNA associated with the immunoprecipitation pellets was analyzed by PCR for the presence of the promoters for either HMG-CoA reductase or the LDL receptor as a control. The PCR results demonstrated that LRH-1 protein bound specifically to the endogenous HMG-CoA reductase promoter, and it was not associated with the LDL receptor promoter chromatin (Fig. 2). In transient transfection assays, the activation of HMG-CoA reductase by SREBPs was always significantly lower compared with other target genes analyzed in parallel, suggesting there was some additional protein required that was missing (17Millinder-Vallett S. Sanchez H.B. Rosenfeld J.M. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12247-12253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Based on the results presented above, we reasoned that this missing protein might be LRH-1/FTF. To test this idea, we performed a transient transfection assay in 293 cells using a culture protocol that activates the processing of endogenous SREBPs (14Bennett M. Toth J.I. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37360-37367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Here, companion dishes of transfected cells are cultured with medium containing or lacking regulatory sterols, and endogenous SREBPs are cleaved from their membrane location and accumulate in the nucleus in the sterol-depleted samples (18Rosenfeld J.R. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16112-16121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 19Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Consistent with our earlier studies, the HMG-CoA reductase promoter was activated ∼2-fold by this sterol depletion protocol (Fig. 3 compare lane 5 with 6). When an expression plasmid for LRH-1/FTF was co-transfected under sterol-depleted conditions, there was a significant increase in expression of the HMG-CoA reductase promoter (Fig. 3, lane 7), and this stimulation was specifically inhibited when an SHP expression plasmid was added on top of the LRH-1/FTF construct (lanes 8–9). However, transfection of the SHP expression plasmid alone had no effect on the modest activation by endogenous SREBPs (Fig. 3, compare lane 6 with 10 and 11). This result suggests that SHP does not inhibit SREBP-mediated activation but only affects the promoter stimulation mediated by LRH-1/FTF. For controls, we also analyzed the LDL receptor and CYP8B1 promoters (Fig. 3, lanes 1–4 and 12–17). Similar to our previous studies (17Millinder-Vallett S. Sanchez H.B. Rosenfeld J.M. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12247-12253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), the sterol depletion protocol resulted in a higher degree of activation of the LDL receptor promoter, and consistent with the studies in the SHP–/– mice, there was no effect of LRH-1/FTF or SHP on LDL receptor promoter activity. However, as a positive control, LRH-1/FTF addition stimulated the CYP8B1 promoter, and this was inhibited by the addition of SHP. In the above experiments using sterol depletion, all three SREBPs were released from the membrane and accumulated in the nucleus; therefore, it was unclear whether LRH-1/FTF functions to enhance the activation of all three SREBPs or whether there is a preference for one of the three SREBP isoforms. To address this, we performed transient promoter activation experiments in cells cultured in the presence of exogenous sterols to suppress the activation of endogenous SREBPs. Additionally, we transfected expression plasmids for each of the mature SREBP isoforms, alone or together with the LRH-1/FTF expression construct (Fig. 4A). Transfection of either SREBP-1a or -2 expression vectors resulted in an ∼2-fold activation of the HMG-CoA reductase promoter luciferase reporter, and in each case, the addition of the LRH-1/FTF construct further stimulated promoter activity significantly. The addition of the SREBP-1c expression plasmid alone had no effect on the promoter by itself, consistent with previous reports where SREBP-1c is a weak activator compared with SREBP-1a or -2 (8Toth J.I. Datta S. Athanikar J.N. Freedman L.P. Osborne T.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8288-8300Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, the addition of the LRH-1/FTF expression construct resulted in a 3-fold stimulation. This was consistently above the small stimulation that resulted by the addition of the LRH-1/FTF expression plasmid alone (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 8 and 9 with 11). Additionally, regardless of which SREBP was analyzed, the addition of the SHP expression construct inhibited only the LRH-1/FTF-mediated effect, because the magnitude of activity after repression by SHP was equal to that stimulation by each SREBP alone. These results indicate that LRH-1/FTF can function with all three SREBPs to activate the HMG-CoA reductase promoter and that SHP inhibition only affects the LRH-1/FTF stimulatory effect. Because SHP is known to inhibit activation by other nuclear receptors, such as HNF-4 (20Lee Y.K. Dell H. Dowhan D.H. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), and because overexpression of transcription factors in transient assays may exaggerate normal physiological effects, as a control, we analyzed whether HNF-4 could activate the HMG-CoA reductase promoter along with SREBPs (Fig. 4B). Transfection of an HNF-4 expression construct in place of LRH-1/FTF had no effect on SREBP-dependent activation of the HMG-CoA reductase promoter, whereas it efficiently activated the HNF-4 target gene CYP8B1 (Fig. 4B). LRH-1/FTF, similar to other nuclear receptors, requires its carboxyl-terminal AF-2 activation domain and a zinc finger DNA binding motif to activate target genes. To determine whether these critical functions are required for activation of HMG-CoA reductase, we deleted the AF-2 domain or introduced a point mutation at a critical cysteine residue of the DNA binding domain P-box (9Umesono K. Evans R.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 1139-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar) to alanine to inhibit DNA binding. Despite the fact that both of these mutant proteins were expressed efficiently in the transfected cells, neither one was able to activate the HMG-CoA reductase promoter like the wild-type protein (Fig. 5). Thus, both of the crucial nuclear receptor functional domains are required and suggest that LRH-1/FTF likely binds directly to the HMG-CoA reductase promoter. In scanning the DNA sequence of the HMG-CoA reductase promoter used in these studies, we noted two putative recognition sites that are conserved between the hamster, mouse, and human promoters (Fig. 6A). To test whether these sites are important for LRH-1/FTF-mediated activation, we deleted them from the luciferase reporter construct. The activation studies shown in Fig. 6B show that deletion of the two sites resulted in a severe blunting of LRH-1/FTF-mediated activation, but these truncations had little effect on overall promoter activity or on stimulation by SREBPs alone (Fig. 6B) (21Osborne T.F. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1985; 42: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Next, the DNA site at –300 was tested for DNA binding directly using recombinant LRH-1/FTF protein in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 6C). Recombinant LRH-1/FTF bound to this HMG-CoA reductase promoter site specifically, and a mutation that changed the sequence away from the predicted consensus recognition site failed to compete efficiently for binding. Additionally, oligonucleotides containing the LRH-1/FTF site from the CYP8B1 promoter or the cold wild-type HMG-CoA reductase DNA oligos used for the electrophoretic mobility shift assay competed efficiently for binding. Thus, DNA binding directly to the HMG-CoA reductase promoter is required for the LRH-1/FTF stimulatory effect. In our previous studies, we noted that the magnitude of stimulation by sterol depletion or the addition of exogenous SREBP expression constructs was very modest for the HMG-CoA reductase promoter compared with the activation achieved with other SREBP target genes analyzed in parallel (17Millinder-Vallett S. Sanchez H.B. Rosenfeld J.M. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12247-12253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In contrast, HMG-CoA reductase gene expression was activated very robustly when SREBPs were overexpressed in mice (22Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Although there might be additional differential post-initiation regulatory actions on the mRNAs that may partially account for these differences, the results are also consistent with a model where an additional protein was missing in our transient transfection assays for the HMG-CoA reductase promoter. The current studies were initiated when we noted that regulation of HMG-CoA reductase was aberrant in SHP–/– mice. Additional studies presented here further support this idea and suggest that LRH-1/FTF is the missing protein. Additionally, the SHP effect exhibits specificity for HMG-CoA reductase, because neither the FXR agonist nor SHP itself had any effect on LDL receptor expression in any of the assays we utilized. Thus, the direct regulation through bile acids and SHP (Fig. 7, left) is specific to the cholesterol synthetic pathway. Our studies have focused on HMG-CoA reductase, because it is considered the classic rate-controlling enzyme of the pathway and because our earlier studies suggest there was a missing component in our transient expression assays. Whether additional enzymes of the pathway are similarly regulated remains to be determined. When bile acid levels rise, CYP7A1 is inhibited and pathway flux is repressed. Without any alteration to earlier steps in the pathway, cholesterol levels would rise, which would inhibit SREBP maturation (Fig. 7, right). However, because the LRH-1/FTF activation of HMG-CoA reductase is inhibited by SHP, the studies presented here provide the first evidence that, in addition to the indirect effect of bile acids through cholesterol, they also have a direct inhibitory action on the expression of HMG-CoA reductase (Fig. 7, left). This indicates that the early and late sectors of the pathway are in metabolic communication with each other to more quickly adapt to changes in pathway influx and outflow. There is a similar regulatory mechanism in glycolysis, where the product of phosphofructokinase, fructose 1,6 bisphosphate, which measures early flux into the pathway, is a positive regulator of pyruvate kinase, which controls pathway outflow (23Pilkis S.J. Claus T.H. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1991; 11: 465-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Spady et al. (7Spady D.K. Turley S.D. Dietschy J.M. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 465-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) report that endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis and cholesterol uptake through the LDL receptor pathway are independently regulated in the livers of mice. In these studies, the addition of the bile acid sequestrant cholestyramine to the diet significantly increased hepatic sterol synthetic rates, whereas LDL clearance rates were not altered relative to control fed mice. Cholestyramine reduces bile acid reabsorption and would effectively deplete the endogenous hepatic FXR agonist pool, which would be predicted to decrease SHP levels. In fact, we have documented that SHP expression is repressed by feeding mice a similar bile acid sequestrant. 4D.-J. Shin and T. F. Osborne, unpublished data. In another study (24Sheng Z. Otani H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), Sheng et al. mentioned that feeding mice a bile acid sequestrant alone was ineffective at increasing nuclear levels of SREBPs in mice. Taken together, these two studies indicate that the mechanism by which bile acid sequestrants increase sterol biosynthesis cannot solely be explained by an increase in nuclear SREBP levels. The current studies demonstrating that expression of HMG-CoA reductase is activated by LRH-1/FTF and repressed by SHP, without any change in LDL receptor expression, provides a reasonable molecular explanation that connects both of these important earlier studies together. The LRH-1/FTF DNA sites are conserved in the human HMG-CoA reductase promoter. Therefore, our results also suggest that FXR agonists might be effective when combined with statins to treat hypercholesterolemia in humans. Statin therapy results in a compensatory up-regulation of HMG-CoA reductase gene expression as the liver attempts to compensate for the decreased sterol production. The addition of an FXR ligand may work synergistically with statins to prevent this response through inhibiting activation by LRH-1/FTF. We thank Drs. Gregorio Gil, David Mangelsdorf, and Frances Sladek for plasmid constructs.

It plays roles as a repressive alternative splicing regulator of multilple target genes, as well as being involved in pre-mRNA 3′ end processing, mRNA localization, stability, and internal ribosome entry site-mediated translation. Here we have used a tethered function assay, in which a fusion protein of PTB and the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein is recruited to a splicing regulatory site by binding to an artificially inserted MS2 binding site. Deletion mutations of PTB in this system allowed us to identify RRM2 and the following inter-RRM linker region as the minimal region of PTB that can act as splicing repressor domain when recruited to RNA. Splicing repression by the minimal repressor domain remained cell type-specific and dependent upon other defined regulatory elements in the α-tropomyosin test minigene. Our results highlight the fact that splicing repression by PTB can be uncoupled from the mode by which it binds to RNA.

Our results highlight the fact that splicing repression by PTB can be uncoupled from the mode by which it binds to RNA. Alternative pre-mRNA splicing is an important mechanism of gene regulation in multicellular eukaryotes. It allows the generation of a number of protein isoforms far in excess of the number of genes, as well as providing quantitative gene control by producing RNAs that are subject to non-sense-mediated decay (1Lareau L.F. Green R.E. Bhatnagar R.S. Brenner S.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Much experimental attention has therefore been aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms of regulated splicing decisions. cis-Acting regulatory elements in the pre-mRNA include not only the essential splice site sequences themselves but also variable auxiliary elements which can act as enhancers or silencers and are located in exons or introns. These elements are referred to as exon splicing enhancers, exon splicing silencers, intron splicing enhancers, and intron splicing silencers (reviewed in Refs. 2Cartegni L. Chew S.L. Krainer A.R. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar and 3Matlin A.J. Clark F. Smith C.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 386-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). These elements typically act as binding sites for splicing regulatory proteins that act as repressors or activators. Members of the SR protein family typically act as activators, although in some circumstances they can be repressors. In contrast, proteins of the hnRNP family are most commonly repressors, but some members can be activators under some circumstances (2Cartegni L. Chew S.L. Krainer A.R. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar, 3Matlin A.J. Clark F. Smith C.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 386-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). One of the best characterized mammalian splicing repressors is polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB), 3The abbreviations used are: PTBpolypyrimidine tract-binding proteinRRMRNA recognition motifTMα-tropomyosinRTreverse transcription. which is also known as hnRNP-I (4Wagner E.J. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3281-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). PTB consists of four RNA recognition motif (RRM) type domains, with additional linker regions between the RRMs and both nuclear localization and export sequences at the extreme N terminus (Fig. 1A). PTB is multifunctional, and as well as functioning as a splicing repressor it also has roles in 3′ end processing (5Castelo-Branco P. Furger A. Wollerton M. Smith C. Moreira A. Proudfoot N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4174-4183Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), mRNA localization (6Cote C.A. Gautreau D. Denegre J.M. Kress T.L. Terry N.A. Mowry K.L. Mol.

Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1556-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). PTB has been characterized as a splicing repressor in multiple model systems (reviewed in Ref. 4Wagner E.J. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3281-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The optimal binding site for PTB determined by SELEX is UCUU in a pyrimidine-rich context (10Perez I. Lin C.H. McAfee J.G. Patton J.G. RNA (N. Y.). 1997; 3: 764-778PubMed Google Scholar), and this and related sequences (e.g. CUCUCU) have been shown to act as splicing silencers. Curiously a (CCU)n sequence within a double-stranded context is a high affinity site for PTB and is common in cellular internal ribosome entry sites (9Mitchell S.A. Spriggs K.A. Bushell M. Evans J.R. Stoneley M. Le Quesne J.P. Spriggs R.V. Willis A.E. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1556-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). PTB binds to both intron splicing silencers and exon splicing silencers and most exons that are regulated by PTB have multiple binding sites. Repression of the c-src N1 exon requires cooperative binding of PTB to sites flanking the exon (11Chou M.Y. Underwood J.G. Nikolic J. Luu M.H. Black D.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Simple competition with binding of U2AF65 at the polypyrimidine tract is a possible mechanism for PTB action (12Lin C.H. Patton J.G. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 234-245PubMed Google Scholar, 13Singh R. Valcarcel J. Green M.R. Science. 1995; 268: 1173-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 14Ashiya M. Grabowski P.J. RNA (N. Y.). 1997; 3: 996-1015PubMed Google Scholar). However, the facts that multiple PTB binding sites are required and that in some cases none of these sites are within the U2AF65 binding polypyrimidine tract (15Amir-Ahmady B. Boutz P.L. Markovtsov V. Phillips M.L. Black D.L. RNA (N. Y.). 2005; 11: 699-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 16Shen H. Kan J.L. Ghigna C. Biamonti G. Green M.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2004; 10: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) together suggest that the mechanism of PTB-mediated splicing repression may be more complex. PTB-mediated multimerization to create “zones of silencing,” which would be inaccessible to the splicing machinery has been suggested as a mechanism, and is consistent with a requirement for multiple binding sites (4Wagner E.J. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3281-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Indeed, the solution structure of RRM domains 3 and 4 bound to RNA shows that a loop of at least 15 nucleotides is needed between the two RNA sites that bind to RRM 3 and 4 (17Oberstrass F.C. Auweter S.D. Erat M. Hargous Y. Henning A. Wenter P. Reymond L. Amir-Ahmady B. Pitsch S. Black D.L. Allain F.H. Science. 2005; 309: 2054-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). This suggests models for splicing repression involving looping of repressed exons or splice sites between RRMs 3 and 4. However, in some cases a single PTB binding exon splicing silencer appears to be sufficient (16Shen H. Kan J.L. Ghigna C. Biamonti G. Green M.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2004; 10: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 18Izquierdo J.M. Majos N. Bonnal S. Martinez C. Castelo R. Guigo R. Bilbao D. Valcarcel J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 475-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), and U1 snRNP binding to the c-src N1 5′ splice site is not prevented by cooperative binding of PTB to flanking sites (11Chou M.Y. Underwood J.G. Nikolic J. Luu M.H. Black D.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Indeed, recent evidence suggests that PTB may interfere indirectly with U2AF65 binding by preventing positive interactions between U2AF65 and splicing factors bound at a 5′ splice site (18Izquierdo J.M.

Early work suggested that RRMs 3 and 4 were primarily responsible for RNA binding, while RRM2 might be involved in PTB-PTB dimerization (20Oh Y.L. Hahm B. Kim Y.K. Lee H.K. Lee J.W. Song O.

Garcia-Blanco M.A. Smith C.W. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 91-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) and that pure PTB does not exist as a stable dimer (15Amir-Ahmady B. Boutz P.L. Markovtsov V. Phillips M.L. Black D.L. RNA (N. Y.). 2005; 11: 699-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 24Simpson P.J. Monie T.P. Szendroi A. Davydova N. Tyzack J.K. Conte M.R.

RRM4 was found to be critical for splicing repression in the GABAA γ2 system (22Liu H. Zhang W. Reed R.B. Liu W. Grabowski P.J. RNA (N. Y.). 2002; 8: 137-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), even though mutants in RRM4 were still able to bind to RNA. However, in this assay loss of splicing repression could be due to alterations in the mode of PTB binding to RNA or due to direct impairment of a repressor domain that does not itself bind to RNA. Here, we have used a “tethered function” assay to identify a minimal splicing repressor domain of PTB. We previously showed that replacement of an essential PTB binding site in the α-tropomyosin (TM) gene with tandem binding sites for bacteriophage MS2 coat protein resulted in loss of exon 3 skipping. Splicing repression could be restored by cotransfection of PTB-MS2 fusion protein but not by PTB or MS2 alone or a fusion of MS2 with another known splicing repressor, hnRNPA1 (26Gromak N. Rideau A. Southby J. Scadden A.D. Gooding C. Huttelmaier S. Singer R.H. Smith C.W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6356-6364Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Because specific RNA binding is provided by the MS2 coat protein, the tethered function assay provides an ideal opportunity to carry out deletion mutagenesis on PTB. We expect that deletion of domains whose only function is in RNA binding would be without effect upon splicing inhibition in this assay. A process of elimination would allow us to identify a minimal splicing repressor domain(s). Consistent with this expectation we find that PTB RRM2 and the following linker region are together sufficient when fused to MS2 to confer high levels of splicing repression. Tethered repressor activity remains dependent upon other cis-acting regulatory elements and is cell specific. Characterization of the splicing repressor domain should facilitate more detailed analyses of the molecular mechanisms of splicing repression by PTB. Constructs and Cloning—Constructs were prepared by standard cloning procedures. Constructs for MS2 fusion proteins were prepared from a parental vector supplied by Richard Breathnach (27Del Gatto-Konczak F. Olive M. Gesnel M.C. Breathnach R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), which contained in N- to C-terminal order: an N-terminal FLAG tag, a nuclear localization signal, and MS2 coat protein. Full-length PTB, or defined subregions (Fig. 1A), were cloned between the FLAG tag and nuclear localization signal as previously described (26Gromak N. Rideau A. Southby J. Scadden A.D. Gooding C. Huttelmaier S. Singer R.H. Smith C.W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6356-6364Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by sequencing. Transfections—PAC-1 smooth muscle cells, HeLa cells, and L cells were cultured under standard conditions in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections were carried out in 35 mm wells using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) (26Gromak N. Rideau A. Southby J. Scadden A.D. Gooding C. Huttelmaier S. Singer R.H. Smith C.W.

When lower levels of effector were used, including negative cotransfection controls, the total DNA concentration was maintained using pGem4Z. RNA Analysis—RNA was harvested and analyzed as described previously (26Gromak N. Rideau A. Southby J. Scadden A.D. Gooding C. Huttelmaier S. Singer R.H. Smith C.W.

Harvesting was with either TRIReagent (Sigma) as described previously or PURESCRIPT (Gentra) solutions, according to supplier's instructions. Reverse transcription was carried out using AMV reverse transcriptase and a specific RT primer: 5′ GCA AAC TCA GCC ACA GGT 3′. PCR was carried out with forward primer SV5′2 (5′ GGA GGC CTA GGC TTT TGC AAA AAG 3′) and 32P 5′-end labeled SV3′1 (5′ ACT CAC TGC GTT CCA GGC AAT GCT 3′), with an 80 °C hot-start and 30 PCR cycles with the following cycling parameters: 94 °C, 30 s, 62 °C, 30 s, 72 °C, 60 s. Products were fractionated on denaturing (8 m urea) polyacrylamide gels, and quantitation was carried out using a Amersham Biosciences Storm phosphorimager and ImageQuant software, by line analysis and area integration. This procedure produces reproducible output of the ratio of exon inclusion to exon skipping (28Wollerton M.C. Gooding C. Robinson F. Brown E.C. Jackson R.J. Smith C.W.

Results are reported as the percentage of exon skipping with respect to total spliced RNA (exon 3 inclusion + exon 3 skipping). Histograms show mean and standard deviations resulting from at least three repeats of the experiment. Protein Harvest and Analysis—Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, dissolved directly in 150 μl of SDS loading buffer, and then subjected to five cycles of 90 °C, 5 min, freezing on dry ice, and slowly thawing to room temperature. 10–20-μl samples were electrophoresed on 15% polyacrylamide SDS gels. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a semidry blotting apparatus at 0.5 mA for 75 min. Detection was by enhanced chemiluminescence using anti-FLAG (Sigma) monoclonal and donkey anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). We designed an initial series of six PTB domain deletions based upon structurally defined domain boundaries (23Conte M.R. Grune T. Ghuman J. Kelly G. Ladas A. Matthews S. Curry S.

These were all based upon PTB4, which is a more potent repressor in the TM system (28Wollerton M.C. Gooding C. Robinson F. Brown E.C. Jackson R.J. Smith C.W.

The mutants are named according to the RRMs remaining in the fusion protein, and an “L” indicates whether the adjacent linker region was also present in the fusion protein. For example, 12L-MS2 contains the region of PTB from the N terminus up to and including the linker following RRM2 (amino acids 1–360). All constructs contained an N-terminal FLAG epitope allowing us to demonstrate equivalent expression levels and a strong nuclear localization signal between the PTB and MS2 moieties. Therefore, any observed differences in repressor activity are not due to differential expression levels or localization (26Gromak N. Rideau A. Southby J. Scadden A.D. Gooding C. Huttelmaier S. Singer R.H. Smith C.W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6356-6364Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, all transfections were carried out in PAC-1 cells, a partially differentiated smooth muscle cell line that supports regulated skipping of TM exon 3 (29Gooding C. Roberts G.C. Moreau G. Nadal-Ginard B. Smith C.W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3861-3872Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 30Gooding C. Roberts G.C. Smith C.W. RNA (N.

The construct TM-2MS2 has the PTB binding sites downstream of TM exon 3 replaced by tandem MS2 sites (Fig. 1B) and when transfected alone into PAC-1 cells gives low basal levels of exon skipping (Fig. 2, A and B, left-hand lane). Cotransfection of PTB4-MS2 produced high levels of exon skipping. In contrast, cotransfection of MS2, PTB4, or hnRNPA1-MS2 had little or no effect (data not shown and Ref. 26Gromak N. Rideau A. Southby J. Scadden A.D. Gooding C. Huttelmaier S. Singer R.H. Smith C.W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6356-6364Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The six mutant constructs had widely different effects (Fig. 2, A and B) despite being expressed at equivalent levels (Fig. 2C). Three of the initial deletion mutants (12L-MS2, 123L-MS2, and L234-MS2) had repressor activity equivalent to full-length PTB4-MS2 (∼70–80% exon skipping). In contrast, 12-MS2, 34-MS2, and L34-MS2 had little or no activity. The region common to all the active fusion proteins is L2L. The inactive proteins all had deletions in one or more parts of this region. The next series of four deletions all contained RRM2 and RRM3 and the intervening linker but varied by the presence or absence of the flanking linker regions (L23L-MS2, L23-MS2, 23L-MS2, and 23-MS2). All four mutants had equivalent repressor activity to full-length PTB4-MS2 and 12L-MS2 (Fig. 3, A and B). The PTB region common to all of the active repressors is therefore 2L. We next tested three further mutants; L2L-MS2, 2L-MS2, and L23-MS2 (Fig. 4A and B, subscript 23 indicates that this is the linker between RRMs 2 and 3). While L2L-MS2 and 2L-MS2 had substantial repressor activity, L23-MS2 was inactive, despite being expressed to equivalent levels (Fig. 4C). Taken together with the preceding data (Figs. 2, 3, 4) this indicates that the minimal repressor domain of PTB comprises RRM2 and the following linker region. Comparison of data from multiple independent experiments (Fig. 4B) indicated that this minimal repressor region retained ∼60% of the full activity of PTB4-MS2 and is the smallest fragment of PTB4 to retain substantial activity. The minimal repressor region retains the 26-amino acid peptide insert by which PTB4 differs from PTB1. The two isoforms have differential activity in the TM system, with PTB4 being more repressive (28Wollerton M.C. Gooding C. Robinson F. Brown E.C. Jackson R.J. Smith C.W. RNA (N.Y.). 2001; 7: 819-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We therefore compared the activity of 2L-MS2 constructs derived from either PTB4 or PTB1. Strikingly, the PTB1 version of 2L-MS2 had a much lower level of activity than the PTB4 version (Fig. 4, D and E), despite being expressed to equivalent levels (Fig. 4F).FIGURE 4PTB4 RRM2-L is the minimal repressor domain.

We next proceeded to test whether this form of exon skipping is related to the normal mechanism of regulated splicing. We first compared a titration of PTB4-MS2 and 2L-MS2 in cotransfections either with the TM-2MS2 (Fig. 5A) reporter or with a second reporter, TM-Sxl (Fig. 5B), in which the original PTB binding site has been replaced with an unrelated pyrimidine tract that does not bind PTB or MS2 (Fig. 1B) (26Gromak N. Rideau A. Southby J. Scadden A.D. Gooding C. Huttelmaier S. Singer R.H. Smith C.W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6356-6364Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 30Gooding C. Roberts G.C. Smith C.W. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 85-100PubMed Google Scholar). Both PTB4-MS2 and 2L-MS2 showed specificity for conferring exon skipping dependent on the presence of the MS2 binding sites (Fig. 5C). Indeed 2L-MS2 showed a higher degree of substrate specificity compared with full-length PTB4-MS2 (compare 1 and 800 ng lanes). This could be because the smaller fusion protein lacking three of the RRMs is less likely to bind non-specifically away from the MS2 site. We next tested the effects of a series of the PTB4-MS2 deletion constructs in two additional cell lines, HeLa (human epithelial) and L (mouse fibroblast) cells. Both of these cell lines have been used as convenient “non-smooth muscle” lines that give lower levels of TM exon 3 skipping than PAC-1 (29Gooding C. Roberts G.C. Moreau G. Nadal-Ginard B. Smith C.W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3861-3872Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 30Gooding C. Roberts G.C. Smith C.W. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 85-100PubMed Google Scholar, 31Gromak N. Smith C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3548-3557Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). All of the fusion proteins were less active in L and HeLa cells than in PAC-1 (Fig. 6). Full-length PTB4-MS2 and the constructs containing three RRMs (123L-MS2 and L234-MS2) produced relatively high levels of exon skipping in L cells but much lower levels in HeLa cells. Significantly, the minimal active fusion constructs (L2L-MS2 and 2L-MS2) showed a higher degree of smooth muscle specificity, with substantial levels of exon skipping in PAC-1 cells but much lower levels in both L and HeLa cells. Therefore the artificial recruitment of the minimal repressor domains does not bypass the normal mechanisms of cell specific exon skipping. Finally, we tested the dependence of the artificially recruited repressor function upon other essential cis-acting regulatory elements. PTB4-MS2 and 2L-MS2 were cotransfected with three additional reporter constructs in which the two essential regulatory elements upstream of TM exon 3 have been mutated, in addition to the replacement of the DY element by MS2 sites (26Gromak N. Rideau A. Southby J. Scadden A.D. Gooding C. Huttelmaier S. Singer R.H. Smith C.W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6356-6364Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In TM-2MS2ΔP3, point mutations have been made in the three UCUU motifs within the polypyrimidine tract; TM-2MS2ΔURE has a 15-nucleotide deletion of the UGC motif containing URE; TM-2MS2ΔP3ΔURE contains both mutations. All three mutant constructs showed a reduced response to both PTB4-MS2 and 2L-MS2 compared with TM-2MS2 (Fig. 7). This confirms that splicing repression mediated by artificially recruited PTB repressor domains remains dependent upon the other essential cis-acting regulatory elements and does not bypass the normal mechanisms of control. The tethered function assay has allowed us to narrow down a minimal PTB repressor domain that restores skipping of exon 3 without bypassing the usual cell-specific (Fig. 6) and cis-acting (Fig. 7) regulatory requirements. Since recruitment to the RNA substrate is directed by the MS2 coat protein this assay allowed us to delete domains of PTB whose principal function is in RNA binding and to identify domains that have a direct effector role. Consistent with this approach, RRMs 3 and 4, which have been attributed the major role in RNA binding in many structure-function analyses (8Kaminski A. Hunt S.L. Patton J.G. Jackson R.J. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 924-938PubMed Google Scholar, 20Oh Y.L. Hahm B. Kim Y.K. Lee H.K. Lee J.W. Song O. Tsukiyama-Kohara K. Kohara M. Nomoto A. Jang S.K. Biochem.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11881-11890Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), were entirely dispensable for repressor activity (Fig. 2). In contrast, the minimal repressor domain requires RRM2, which has been suggested to mediate PTB-PTB dimerization (20Oh Y.L. Hahm B. Kim Y.K. Lee H.K. Lee J.W. Song O. Tsukiyama-Kohara K. Kohara M. Nomoto A. Jang S.K. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 21Perez I. McAfee J.G. Patton J.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11881-11890Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The effector domain of PTB might act, at least in part, by mediating PTB-PTB interactions. This could lead to cooperative binding of PTB to the upstream P3 sites, similar to the situation in the c-src N1 exon (11Chou M.Y. Underwood J.G. Nikolic J. Luu M.H. Black D.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). A similar model was proposed for hnRNPA1; MS2 recruitment of just the glycine-rich domain that mediates hnRNPA1-hnRNPA1 interactions was sufficient to induce exon splicing silencer-dependent exon skipping (27Del Gatto-Konczak F. Olive M. Gesnel M.C. Breathnach R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The preceding model may require some re-evaluation for PTB. Various biophysical analyses suggest that pure PTB is an extended monomer (15Amir-Ahmady B. Boutz P.L. Markovtsov V. Phillips M.L. Black D.L. RNA (N. Y.). 2005; 11: 699-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 24Simpson P.J. Monie T.P. Szendroi A. Davydova N. Tyzack J.K. Conte M.R. Read C.M. Cary P.D. Svergun D.I. Konarev P.V. Curry S. Matthews S. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 1631-1643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), rather than a dimer or higher order oligomer as suggested previously (20Oh Y.L. Hahm B. Kim Y.K. Lee H.K. Lee J.W. Song O. Tsukiyama-Kohara K. Kohara M. Nomoto A. Jang S.K. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 21Perez I. McAfee J.G. Patton J.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11881-11890Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This suggests that any PTB-PTB interactions mediated by RRM2 are not stable in the absence of additional protein-RNA interactions, but it does not preclude a role for such interactions in cooperative binding of two or more PTB monomers to RNA. Protein fragments containing RRM2 and the preceding linker had a tendency for nonspecific self-association in vitro (24Simpson P.J. Monie T.P. Szendroi A. Davydova N. Tyzack J.K. Conte M.R. Read C.M.

Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 1631-1643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), but this is unlikely to be connected with the minimal repressor function that we have defined, as this linker region is not part of the minimal 2L-MS2 construct. Another potentially important target for the PTB minimal repressor domain is raver1 (32Huttelmaier S. Illenberger S. Grosheva I. Rudiger M. Singer R.H. Jockusch B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 775-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), which can act as a corepressor with PTB in the TM system (26Gromak N. Rideau A. Southby J. Scadden A.D. Gooding C. Huttelmaier S. Singer R.H. Smith C.W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6356-6364Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We have characterized an interaction between PTB and a peptide motif repeated within raver1. The peptide ([S/G][I/L]L-GXXP) occurs four times in raver1 and is sufficient to interact with PTB. NMR analysis using isotopically labeled fragments of PTB (24Simpson P.J. Monie T.P. Szendroi A. Davydova N. Tyzack J.K. Conte M.R. Read C.M. Cary P.D. Svergun D.I. Konarev P.V. Curry S. Matthews S. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 1631-1643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) indicates that the raver1 peptide interacts specifically with RRM2. 4A. P. Rideau, C. Gooding, P. J. Simpson, T. P. Monie, M. Lorenz, S. Hüttelmaier, R. H. Singer, S. Curry, S. Matthews, and C. W. J. Smith, manuscript in preparation. The peptide does not interact with the linker following PTB RRM2, even though this is required for the splicing repressor activity, as shown here. This suggests that even if the conserved raver1 peptide is a molecular target of RRM2 there are also additional targets of the minimal PTB repressor domain. These targets could be other parts of the raver1 protein, other co-repressor proteins (e.g. the UGC motif binding factors), or components of the core splicing machinery. The identification of RRM2-L as the minimal repressor domain might be taken to call into question the recently proposed models for PTB-mediated repression in which looping of RNA between RRMs 3 and 4 plays a critical role (17Oberstrass F.C. Auweter S.D. Erat M. Hargous Y. Henning A. Wenter P. Reymond L. Amir-Ahmady B. Pitsch S. Black D.L. Allain F.H. Science. 2005; 309: 2054-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). However, we have only tested the PTB domain requirement at the downstream DY element. Exon skipping mediated by the RRM2L repressor domain remained dependent upon PTB binding sites in the P3 pyrimidine tract (Fig. 7). It is possible that RNA looping between PTB RRMs 34 may play a role at the P3 sites. It would be particularly useful to be able to carry out a similar analysis of PTB domain requirements at the P3 polypyrimidine tract. As one of the consensus elements for splicing of exon 3, it is likely that the P3 pyrimidine tract could be the site at which PTB has its important effects, while the DY site may play an auxiliary role. However, artificial recruitment at the polypyrimidine tract would be technically far more difficult as substitution with MS2 sites at this location would likely interfere with both U2AF65 binding to the polypyrimidine tract and with step 2 of splicing. In the future we will investigate whether it is possible to complement mutations in the P3 PTB binding sites by artificially tethering PTB downstream of P3 or upstream of the branch point. If we were able to use a second tethering system (e.g. Box B, λ N peptide (33De Gregorio E. Preiss T. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4865-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar)), this would allow us to dissect whether there are different minimal PTB domain requirements on each side of the exon. A question related to the direct molecular targets of the PTB repressor domain is “what is the mechanism by which PTB interferes with splicing complex assembly?” The earliest models for PTB-mediated repression involved simple binding competition with U2AF65 at the polypyrimidine tract (12Lin C.H. Patton J.G. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 234-245PubMed Google Scholar, 13Singh R. Valcarcel J. Green M.R. Science. 1995; 268: 1173-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The requirement for additional PTB binding sites remote from the polypyrimidine tract does not rule out this mechanism; cooperative binding of PTB might be required in order for effective competition with U2AF. However, some PTB-regulated exons do not require PTB binding at the polypyrimidine tract (15Amir-Ahmady B. Boutz P.L. Markovtsov V. Phillips M.L. Black D.L. RNA (N. Y.). 2005; 11: 699-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 16Shen H. Kan J.L. Ghigna C. Biamonti G. Green M.R. RNA (N.

Cell. 2005; 19: 475-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Indeed, two recent reports suggest that the mechanism of PTB-mediated repression involves interference with U2AF65 binding to the polypyrimidine tract not by direct steric competition but by preventing positive cross-exon or cross-intron interactions with U1 snRNP bound at a 5′ splice site (18Izquierdo J.M.

Black D.L. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 485-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This is an inherently more interesting mechanism for splicing regulation. As suggested by Valcarcel and colleagues (18Izquierdo J.M. Majos N. Bonnal S. Martinez C. Castelo R. Guigo R. Bilbao D. Valcarcel J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 475-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), this activity of PTB may allow insights into the poorly understood network of interactions involved in exon definition. In particular, identification of the molecular targets of the minimal repressor domain of PTB (and raver1) may reveal some of the crucial players in exon definition. Finally, artificial recruitment of PTB by MS2 has also been demonstrated to restore exon skipping in FGFR2 (34Wagner E.J. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 943-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and Fas (18Izquierdo J.M. Majos N. Bonnal S. Martinez C. Castelo R. Guigo R. Bilbao D. Valcarcel J. Mol.

It would be interesting to analyze the PTB-MS2 deletion mutants in these systems to determine whether the same minimal repressor domain operates in all three systems.

Comparative and mutagenesis studies of QacA and the closely related QacB protein, which differs from QacA by conferring little or no resistance to bivalent compounds, viz. diamidines and biguanidines, have revealed that the presence of an acidic residue at position 323 in TMS 10 of QacA is essential for the high levels of resistance seen to bivalent compounds (4Paulsen I.T.

Acta. 1999; 1461: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 10Tamura N. Konishi S. Iwaki S. Kimura-Someya T. Nada S. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20330-20339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 11Frillingos S. Sahin-Tóth M. Wu J. Kaback H.R. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1281-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Therefore, to understand the importance of TMS 10 in QacA-mediated efflux, Cys-scanning mutagenesis was carried out on TMS 10 and its flanking regions. The effect of Cys substitution on protein expression was studied by Western blot analysis. The extents of TMS 10 were examined by analyzing the relative reactivity of the QacA Cys-substituted mutant proteins to two differently labeled maleimido compounds, and functionally important residues were identified by phenotypic analysis and fluorimetric transport assays. Bacterial Strains—The Escherichia coli strain DH5α (12Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8138) Google Scholar) was used as the host strain for general cloning purposes, Western blotting, and solvent accessibility analyses. The E. coli strain BHB2600 (13Hohn B. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 68: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) was used for minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) analyses and fluorimetric transport assays. Both strains were cultured at 37 °C in Luria broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin where appropriate. Chemicals—Benzalkonium, chlorhexidine, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), dequalinium, ethidium (Et), pyronin Y, and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) were purchased from Sigma; [14C]NEM from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; and fluorescein-5-maleimide from Molecular Probes. Diamidinodiphenylamine (Dd) was provided by Rhône-Poulenc Rorer (Dagenham, UK). All other materials were of reagent grade and obtained from commercial sources. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutants were constructed per the QuikChange™ technique (Stratagene) using pairs of mutagenic primers and plasmid pSK4322 as a template. This plasmid was constructed by cloning a PCR-derived 1.6-kb qacA-coding fragment from plasmid pSK1 (14Rouch D.A. Cram D.S. DiBerardino D. Littlejohn T.G. Skurray R.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 2051-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the vector pBluescript II SK(+). A His6 tag was also incorporated into the C terminus of QacA during PCR. All mutated sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. Labeling of the QacA Cys Mutant Proteins with Fluorescein Maleimide or [14C]NEM—E. coli DH5α cells harboring plasmids encoding QacA Cys-substituted mutants were inoculated into Luria broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, grown to OD650 = 0.9 and collected by centrifugation. Bacterial cells were disrupted by passing three times through a French pressure cell (SLM Aminco, Spectronic Instruments) at 20,000 psi. After removal of cell debris by centrifugation, membrane vesicles were collected by ultracentrifugation at 125,000 × g for 1 h and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0) to a protein concentration of 20 mg/ml. Typically, 30 μl of membrane vesicles were used for each reaction. Fluorescein maleimide or [14C]NEM was added to a final concentration of 0.25 mm and then incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. The reactions were terminated by adding NEM to a final concentration of 20 mm. The membrane vesicles were solubilized with 1% SDS and QacA mutant proteins purified by affinity chromatography using Ni2+ nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose. Approximately 2 μg of the purified QacA protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE. For fluorescein maleimide labeling, fluorescein maleimide bound to QacA was visualized by scanning wet gels directly using a Molecular Imager® FX (Bio-Rad). The gels were then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and scanned with a GS-710 calibrated imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad). For [14C]NEM labeling, the gel was first stained and dried. The dried gel was exposed to a phosphor screen, and the [14C]NEM-bound QacA mutant proteins were visualized by scanning with a Molecular Imager® FX (Bio-Rad). To determine the effect of Et and DAPI binding on the labeling of the QacA Cys mutant proteins by fluorescein maleimide, membrane vesicles containing QacA mutant proteins were first incubated at 30 °C for 5 min in the absence or presence of 1 mm Et or DAPI; labeling of mutant proteins was performed as described above. Determination of Resistance Profiles and Fluorimetric Analysis of QacA-mediated Et and DAPI Efflux—MIC analyses and transport assays of QacA-mediated efflux of Et and DAPI were performed as described previously (8Mitchell B.A. Paulsen I.T. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3541-3548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, transport activities of bacterial cells incubated with 12 different concentrations of each substrate were measured fluorimetrically. Initial transport velocities were calculated by averaging the linear part of each fluorescence-decreasing curve and computationally fitted to estimated Vmax and Km values. Vmax values of each QacA mutant protein were normalized against the protein expression levels obtained by densitometric scanning of Western blots using a QacA-specific antiserum. Effect of NEM Treatment on the Efflux of Et and DAPI—Aliquots of bacterial cells prepared as previously described (8Mitchell B.A. Paulsen I.T. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3541-3548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) were incubated in the presence or absence of 5 mm NEM at 37 °C for 20 min. After removal of NEM by washing with 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.0), the cells were resuspended in the above buffer, loaded with 15 μm Et or 10 μm DAPI, and the QacA-mediated efflux analyzed as previously described (8Mitchell B.A. Paulsen I.T. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3541-3548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Second-site Suppressor Analysis of the QacA D323C Mutant—To isolate second-site suppressors, E. coli DH5α cells harboring the plasmid encoding the QacA D323C mutant were plated on Luria broth agar plates supplemented with a non-permissive concentration of the bivalent compound Dd (100 μg/ml) and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. The resulting colonies were purified, their plasmids extracted and transformed into fresh E. coli DH5α cells, and the resistance profiles of the resulting transformants determined by MIC analysis. The 1.6-kb qacA-coding regions of the plasmids able to confer resistance to Dd were then fully sequenced. Cys-scanning Mutagenesis of QacA TMS 10 and the Expression of Mutant Proteins—Previous studies revealed that a negatively charged Asp at position 323 of TMS 10 of QacA was essential for the recognition of bivalent cationic compounds, implying the direct involvement of this TMS in the substrate recognition process (4Paulsen I.T. Brown M.H. Littlejohn T.G. Mitchell B.A. Skurray R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3630-3635Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 8Mitchell B.A. Paulsen I.T. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3541-3548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To further understand the importance of this TMS in the function of QacA, 35 amino acid residues in putative TMS 10 and its flanking regions, from Ser-308 to Val-342 of QacA (Fig. 1), were replaced with Cys individually by site-directed mutagenesis and the resulting mutants functionally and biochemically characterized. Western blotting with a QacA-specific anti-serum revealed that most of the QacA mutant proteins were expressed at levels essentially comparable with that of the QacA wild-type protein (data not shown), indicating that Cys substitution generally did not have a significant effect on the expression of the mutant proteins. However, the QacA mutant proteins K311C, R336C, and K340C were expressed at levels below or equivalent to 50% of that of QacA wild-type protein, suggesting that these basic residues may be important for protein expression, insertion, and/or stability. Examination of the Extents of QacA TMS 10—Although the rough boundaries of TMS 10 had been predicted by hydropathy analysis and confirmed experimentally using limited gene fusions to both alkaline phosphatase and β-galactosidase (4Paulsen I.T. Brown M.H. Littlejohn T.G. Mitchell B.A. Skurray R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3630-3635Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), the exact limits were not clear. Such information can be obtained by determining the reactivity of Cys-substituted mutant proteins with maleimide derivatives (10Tamura N. Konishi S. Iwaki S. Kimura-Someya T. Nada S. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20330-20339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 15Kimura T. Suzuki M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15896-15899Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 16Poelarends G.J. Konings W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42891-42898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Maleimido compounds react with a thiolate more readily than with a thiol group; therefore, they selectively react with Cys residues that are exposed to an aqueous medium (15Kimura T. Suzuki M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15896-15899Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), whereas Cys residues in a hydrophobic environment are expected to have a much lower reactivity. In this study, the relative reactivities of the QacA Cys-substituted mutant proteins to maleimide derivatives were determined using both fluorescein maleimide and [14C]NEM. The results using these two differently labeled maleimido compounds were in good agreement; hence only experiments using fluorescein maleimide were performed in detail, the results of which are shown in Fig. 2. The QacA mutant proteins S308C and P309C were strongly reactive with fluorescein maleimide, whereas mutant proteins F310C and K311C were only weakly reactive. Cys residues at positions 312–329 were barely reactive with fluorescein maleimide, except for A327C, suggesting that the stretch of 20 amino acid residues from Phe-310 to Ile-329 forms the hydrophobic core of the transmembrane helix. The majority of the QacA mutant proteins from A330C to I341C were reactive with fluorescein maleimide but to significantly different extents, with only the A335C and G338C mutant proteins being strongly reactive (Fig. 2). It is likely that residues Ala-330–Ile-341 form some kind of structure or are partially embedded in the membrane bilayer and are therefore not completely exposed to the aqueous medium and hence cannot efficiently react with fluorescein maleimide. The QacA V342C mutant protein did not react with fluorescein maleimide, suggesting that position 342 is located in a hydrophobic environment and probably lies within TMS 11, a result in agreement with the originally predicted model (Fig. 1). Minimum Inhibitory Concentration Analysis of the QacA Mutants—To determine the functional importance of the studied residues, resistance profiles of the QacA mutants were determined by MIC analysis using substrates from different chemical classes, including the monovalent compounds Et, pyronin Y, and benzalkonium and the bivalent compounds dequalinium, DAPI, Dd, and chlorhexidine. The results showed that the majority of the mutants conferred resistance to most of the substrates tested at levels comparable with those of QacA wild type (Fig. 3). However, some QacA derivatives, such as L314C, Y315C, G322C, and A327C, were more susceptible to one or more substrates tested but not to an entire category of monovalent or bivalent substrates. The QacA G313C mutant conferred significantly reduced resistance to dequalinium and chlorhexidine and no resistance to all of the other compounds tested, and the QacA D323C mutant lost resistance to all of the bivalent compounds tested, indicating that Gly-313 is important for resistance to all QacA substrates, whereas Asp-323 is essential only for resistance to bivalent compounds, as previously reported (4Paulsen I.T. Brown M.H. Littlejohn T.G. Mitchell B.A. Skurray R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3630-3635Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 8Mitchell B.A. Paulsen I.T. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3541-3548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Et and DAPI Efflux by QacA Mutants—To verify the phenotypes conferred by these QacA mutants, fluorimetric analyses of the efflux of Et and DAPI, which were chosen as representatives of monovalent and bivalent substrates of QacA, respectively, were performed as previously described (8Mitchell B.A. Paulsen I.T. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3541-3548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and the kinetic parameters of transport, Vmax (Fig. 4) and Km (data not shown), determined. The results showed that only one of the 35 mutants, the QacA G313C mutant, completely lost Et export activity (Fig. 4A). The remaining QacA mutants mediated significant Et efflux, with activities ranging from ∼48 (M324C) to 231% (R336C) compared with that of the QacA wild type. For DAPI export, both the QacA G313C and D323C mutants completely lost DAPI transport activity. These results further confirmed the importance of residues Gly-313 and Asp-323 in efflux mediated by QacA. Additionally, replacement of Met-319 with Cys resulted in a significant reduction in DAPI transport activity (∼12% of that of QacA wild type; Fig. 4B), indicating that this residue was also important for DAPI transport. The other QacA mutants retained significant DAPI transport activities (Fig. 4B). Transport analyses of the QacA K311C, R336C, and K340C mutants revealed that these derivatives have high Et and DAPI transport activities when taking into account their low expression levels (Fig. 4). It is possible that the reduced amount of these mutant proteins is an adjustment made by the cell so that these highly active derivatives are not present at toxic levels. The Km values of Et and DAPI transport by the QacA mutants were all <20 μm (data not shown), consistent with previous results (8Mitchell B.A. Paulsen I.T. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3541-3548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), indicating that QacA interacts with Et and DAPI specifically and these amino acid substitutions do not greatly affect substrate binding. Effect of NEM on Et and DAPI Efflux by QacA Mutants—NEM has widely been used to probe the substrate-binding site/transport pathway of membrane transport proteins (11Frillingos S. Sahin-Tóth M. Wu J. Kaback H.R. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1281-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 17Kimura-Someya T. Iwaki S. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32806-32811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For example, residues in the E. coli lactose permease LacY, which have Cys-substituted mutants inactivated by NEM alkylation, are often found to be in close vicinity to the substrate-binding site (18Frillingos S. Kaback H.R. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 19Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar, 20Kaback H.R. Sahin-Tóth M. Weinglass A.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 610-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). To test whether any of the residues in TMS 10 of QacA were likely to form or be spatially juxtaposed to the substrate-binding site(s)/transport pathway, the effects of NEM treatment on Et and DAPI efflux mediated by the QacA mutants were examined. The QacA G313C and D323C derivatives lost both Et and DAPI or DAPI transport activities, respectively, and hence could not be tested. Results showed that there were no mutants with an Et efflux capability that was completely abolished by the addition of NEM (Fig. 5A). However, Et efflux mediated by the QacA P309C, A320C, and A327C derivatives was inhibited significantly (≥50%) by ∼65, 50, and 70%, respectively, whereas Et efflux by the QacA A334C mutant was enhanced to 250% (Fig. 5A). The magnitudes of NEM inhibition of the above mutants were similar over a range of NEM concentrations (1–10 mm) or different incubation time periods (10–40 min) in the presence of 5 mm NEM (data not shown), indicating that the incomplete inhibition observed was not due to an incomplete reaction of the Cys residues with NEM. Therefore, the inhibition of QacA-mediated Et efflux by NEM was probably because of the steric hindrance of substrate binding or translocation resulting from NEM alkylation, as suggested using similar studies that have been performed with other transport proteins (17Kimura-Someya T. Iwaki S. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32806-32811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 18Frillingos S. Kaback H.R. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 19Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). The effect of NEM treatment on the DAPI efflux of the QacA mutants was also examined (Fig. 5B). NEM treatment abolished DAPI efflux mediated by the QacA P309C mutant and significantly enhanced that by the QacA A334C mutant by ∼10-fold (Fig. 5B). No significant effect of NEM treatment on the DAPI efflux by the other QacA mutants was observed. Binding of Et and DAPI Induced a Different Conformational Change to QacA—To examine whether any amino acids within TMS 10 of QacA were so close to the substrate-binding site(s) that the introduced Cys residues could be allosterically protected from maleimide alkylation by the addition of substrates, or whether substrate binding induced a conformational change of the QacA protein, thereby making the Cys residues more or less accessible to solvent, the effects of pre-incubation with Et and DAPI on the labeling of a number of QacA mutant proteins by fluorescein maleimide, including P309C, L316C, A320C, D323C, M324C, A327C, P328C, A330C, P331C, G332C, A334C, and F337C, were analyzed. Most of the mutants tested possessed a Cys residue predicted to be on the same face of TMS 10 as Asp-323, which was likely to be close to the substrate-binding site, or with relatively high solvent accessibility (Fig. 2), could be tested for substrate protection against maleimide alkylation. The results indicated that, although pre-incubation with Et had no significant effect on the maleimide labeling of all of the mutant proteins tested (data not shown), pre-incubation with DAPI did significantly increase the labeling of mutant proteins A327C and P331C by ∼4.2- and 6.7-fold, respectively (Fig. 6). This suggested that the binding of DAPI may have caused a conformational change of the QacA protein, rendering residues P331C and A327C more exposed to the aqueous phase and hence allowing higher degrees of alkylation by fluorescein maleimide. Isolation and Characterization of a QacA D323C/A320E Double Mutant—To determine whether an additional mutation can compensate for the loss of the negative charge at position 323 of TMS 10, a second-site suppressor mutant of the QacA D323C mutant was isolated. After growth on a non-permissive concentration of the substrate Dd, only one resistant QacA mutant was isolated. DNA sequencing of the promoter and coding region of qacA confirmed that the initial Cys substitution was still present in addition to a second-site mutation, creating a QacA D323C/A320E double mutant. This double mutant regained high levels of resistance to bivalent compounds (Fig. 3) and displayed a much higher DAPI transport activity, ∼10-fold higher than that of the QacA wild type, whereas it retained similar Et transport activity as the QacA wild type (data not shown). This indicated that an acidic Glu residue at position 320 of TMS 10, which is one turn away from position 323 and on the same face of the helix (Fig. 7), can compensate for the mutation of D323C. When treated with NEM, DAPI efflux mediated by this mutant was completely abolished, suggesting that Asp-323 is directly involved in bivalent substrate binding. Phenotypic and fluorimetric analyses of the QacA Cys mutants showed that the majority of the residues were not crucial for the function of QacA (Figs. 3 and 4). However, some Cys substitutions exerted substrate-specific effects; for example, the QacA L314C and Y315C mutants lost resistance to benzalkonium but conferred substantial resistance to other compounds (Fig. 3). Such altered substrate specificity, because of the mutation of a single amino acid, has been well documented for multidrug resistance proteins (4Paulsen I.T. Brown M.H. Littlejohn T.G.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 822-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and reflects the poly-specific nature of the multidrug recognition mechanism. By contrast, the QacA D323C mutant lost resistance to all tested bivalent compounds and DAPI efflux capability but retained wild-type levels of resistance to monovalent compounds and mediated Et efflux to a level not significantly different from that of the QacA wild type (Figs. 3 and 4), substantiating the importance of this residue in the recognition of bivalent compounds (4Paulsen I.T.
