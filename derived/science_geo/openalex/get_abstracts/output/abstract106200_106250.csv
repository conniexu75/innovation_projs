https://openalex.org/W1514437369,"The CTR1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a protein required for high affinity copper uptake. The protein is expressed on the plasma membrane, is heavily glycosylated with O-linkages, and exists as an oligomer in vivo. The transcript abundance is strongly regulated by copper availability, being induced by copper deprivation and repressed by copper excess. Regulation occurs at very low, nontoxic levels of available copper and is independent of ACE1, the trans-inducer of yeast metallothionein. Expression of Ctr1p is limiting for copper uptake, since overexpression from a 2 mu high copy number plasmid increases copper uptake. Mutations in CTR1 result in altered cellular responses to extracellular copper, demonstrating a physiologic role for CTR1 in the delivery of copper to the cytosol. A copper-dependent reporter gene construct, CUP1-lacZ, is not expressed in CTR1 mutants to the same level as in wild-type strains, and Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase activity is deficient in these mutants. The growth arrest that occurs in CTR1 mutants grown aerobically in copper-deficient media is attributable to the defect in Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1488748351,"Metabolic control analyses of glucose utilization were performed for four groups of working rat hearts perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 10 mM glucose only, or with the addition of 4 mM D-beta-hydroxybutyrate/1 mM acetoacetate, 100 nM insulin (0.05 unit/ml), or both. Net glycogen breakdown occurred in the glucose group only and was converted to net glycogen synthesis in the presence of all additions. The flux of [2-3H]glucose through P-glucoisomerase (EC 5.3.1.9) was reduced with ketones, elevated with insulin, and unchanged with the combination. Net glycolytic flux was reduced in the presence of ketones and the combination. The flux control coefficients were determined for the portion of the pathway involving glucose transport to the branches of glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. Major control was divided between the glucose transporter and hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1) in the glucose group. The distribution of the control was slightly shifted to hexokinase with ketones, and control at the glucose transport step was abolished in the presence of insulin. Analysis of the pathway from 3-P-glycerate to pyruvate determined that the major control was shared by enolase (EC 4.2.1.1) and pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) in the glucose group. Addition of ketones, insulin, or the combination shifted the control to P-glycerate mutase (EC 5.4.2.1) and pyruvate kinase. These results illustrate that the control of the metabolic flux in glucose metabolism of rat heart is not exerted by a single enzyme but variably distributed among enzymes depending upon substrate availability, hormonal stimulation, or other changes of conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1562926557,"Neu differentiation factor (NDF or heregulin) elevates tyrosine phosphorylation of the ErbB-2 receptor tyrosine kinase, and it was, therefore, thought to function as a ligand of this receptor. However, several lines of evidence raised the possibility that the interaction between NDF and ErbB-2 involves another molecule, which belongs to the family of epidermal growth factor receptors. To address this question we constructed soluble chimeric proteins between alkaline phosphatase and the extracellular domains of ErbB-2 and either ErbB-3 or ErbB-4, two newly recognized members of the epidermal growth factor receptor family. Using the soluble proteins we found that beta isoforms of NDF specifically bind to the ErbB-3 and ErbB-4 receptors but not to the soluble ErbB-2 protein. When ectopically expressed in monkey fibroblasts, the full-length ErbB-3 and ErbB-4 receptors conferred specific binding to NDF. In these cells ErbB-3 displayed lower ligand binding affinity than ErbB-4, but like the latter receptor it preferred to bind the beta isoform over the alpha class of NDFs. These results indicate that both ErbB-3 and ErbB-4 function as physiological receptors of all NDF isoforms and suggest that a still unknown ligand of ErbB-2 exists."
https://openalex.org/W11746928,"The mechanisms by which apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) and apoB-48 assemble lipoproteins have been studied in the McA-RH7777 cell line. After incubation for 2 h with 360 microM oleic acid, the McA-RH7777 cells secreted apoB-100 mainly on very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles, as judged from sucrose gradient and sequential ultracentrifugation. ApoB-48 was secreted on both VLDL and on denser, high density lipoprotein (HDL)-like lipoproteins. Both apoB-48 and apoB-100 occurred on VLDL particles in the luminal content of the total microsomal fraction. In addition, both proteins were present on denser particles, in particular, those that banded in the HDL region. The denser particles containing apoB-48 were secreted from the cells, whereas those containing apoB-100 were retained in the cell and degraded. Pulse-chase experiments showed that apoB-100 on VLDL was present in the secretory pathway already after a labeling period as short as 3 min. Thus, this particle was the first apoB-100-containing lipoprotein that could be detected in the microsomal fraction of the cell. The assembly of labeled apoB-100 VLDL was acutely (within min) and completely blocked by cycloheximide, if the cycloheximide was added after the pulse labeling period. If, on the other hand, a 15-min chase was introduced after the labeling period, there was no effect of cycloheximide on the assembly of apoB-100 VLDL. A 15-min chase is enough to allow the pulse-labeled apoB nascent polypeptides to be completed to apoB-100. These results indicated that the assembly of apoB-100-containing VLDL is dependent upon ongoing protein biosynthesis during the time when the nascent polypeptide elongate. After this period, the assembly and secretion of the particles are independent of ongoing protein biosynthesis. The first apoB-48-containing particle seen in the luminal content of the microsomal fraction was the HDL-like particle. Pulse-chase experiments as well as experiments with different lengths of the radioactive pulse indicated that the formation of apoB-48-containing VLDL was delayed compared with the formation of the apoB-48-containing HDL-like particle and also in relation to the assembly of the different apoB-100-containing particles, including VLDL. After a 30-min pulse with [35S]methionine followed by a 120-min chase the secretory pathway of the cell was depleted of almost all lipoproteins except the HDL-like apoB-48-containing particle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1590251223,"A mutant of Escherichia coli, unable to produce manganese- or iron-containing superoxide dismutase (SOD), was found to contain modest levels of an SOD that was judged to be a copper- and zinc-containing SOD on the basis of inhibition by cyanide and inactivation by either H2O2 or diethyldithiocarbamate. Moreover, the diethyldithiocarbamate-inactivated enzyme could be reactivated with Cu(II), and this reconstituted enzyme, like the native enzyme, was unaffected by EDTA and was inhibited by cyanide. This enzyme was, furthermore, selectively released by osmotic shock, in keeping with a periplasmic localization, and it was strongly induced during aerobic growth. This enzyme was also present in the SOD-competent parental strain. Failure to detect it previously can be attributed to its periplasmic localization, thermal lability, sensitivity to pH, and to its relative paucity. It will now be interesting to explore the phenotypic consequences imposed by the absence of this SOD."
https://openalex.org/W1603616546,"The primate type C retrovirus gibbon ape leukemia virus (GaLV) has been shown to use a widely expressed, multiple membrane-spanning protein of unknown function as its cell surface receptor on human cells (GLVR1) (Johann, S. V., Gibbons, J. J., and O'Hara, B. (1992) J. Virol. 66, 1635-1640; O'Hara, B., Johann, S. V., Klinger, H. P., Blair, D. G., Rubinson, H., Dunni, K.J., Sass, P., Vitek, S. M., and Robins, T. (1990) Cell Growth Diff. 1, 119-127). Here we present evidence that the receptor for GaLV (GLVR1) functions as a sodium-dependent transporter of inorganic phosphate. GLVR1 is shown to have approximately 3-4-fold higher affinity for phosphate than other mammalian phosphate transporters described to date. Productive infection of GLVR1-expressing cells by GaLV, but not other retroviruses, results in the complete blockade of GLVR1-specific uptake of inorganic phosphate. Since productive infection of cells with GaLV is generally not cytotoxic, it is likely that more than one phosphate transporter exists on the cell surface. Our data suggest that GLVR1 represents a sodium-dependent phosphate transporter that differs from other mammalian phosphate transporters in structure, affinity for phosphate, and function."
https://openalex.org/W1563387341,"The first committed step of transsulfuration is catalyzed by cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), a known pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) enzyme. The inferred amino acid sequences of rat liver CBS and rat liver hemoprotein H-450 are identical. We now confirm the presence of heme b in rat and human liver CBS. Heme almost entirely accounts for the visible spectrum of CBS rather than PLP. Human CBS, expressed in Escherichia coli, acquires heme b from the host bacteria. delta-Aminolevulinate supplementation during bacterial growth increases both the heme saturation and the specific activity of the homogeneous enzyme more than 3-fold. 1 mol of the 63-kDa CBS subunit binds 1 mol of each (heme and PLP). The presence of heme is required for PLP binding, and the amount of PLP bound is limited by the heme content. Removal of PLP, but not heme, from CBS is reversible. These findings suggest that heme is functionally incorporated into CBS only during protein folding. This report describes the first instance of an enzyme that depends upon both heme and PLP for its function."
https://openalex.org/W204776755,"The type I adenylyl cyclase is directly stimulated by Ca2+ and calmodulin in vivo (Choi, E. J., Wong, S. T., Hinds, T. R. and Storm, D. R. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 12440-12442; Wu, Z., Wong, S. T., and Storm, D. R. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 23766-23768). In this study, we examined the sensitivity of the type I adenylyl cyclase expressed in HEK-293 cells to beta-adrenergic agonists or glucagon when intracellular Ca2+ was elevated by Ca2+ ionophore or carbachol. Although previous studies have shown that this enzyme can be directly stimulated by activated Gs in vitro, we demonstrate that it is not stimulated by Gs-coupled receptors in vivo. However, the enzyme was stimulated by Gs-coupled receptors in vivo when it was activated by intracellular Ca2+. For example, the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 stimulated the enzyme 3 +/- 0.5-fold (n = 9) and isoproterenol alone did not stimulate the enzyme, but the combination of the two stimulated type I adenylyl cyclase 13 +/- 2-fold (n = 9) in vivo. Similarly, 500 nM glucagon alone did not stimulate the enzyme but the combination of A23187 and glucagon activated the enzyme 90 +/- 8-fold (n = 4). Synergistic stimulation of type I adenylyl cyclase activity was also obtained with combinations of carbachol and isoproterenol or glucagon. This phenomenon was not observed with a mutant enzyme that is insensitive to Ca2+ and calmodulin, suggesting that conformational changes caused by binding of calmodulin to the type I adenylyl cyclase enhance binding or coupling to activated Gs. These data illustrate that this adenylyl cyclase can couple Ca2+ and neurotransmitter signals to generate optimal cAMP levels, a property of the enzyme that may be important for its role in learning and memory in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W1576265914,"A mechanism by which calcium-induced signals are transduced to the nucleus to activate transcription of the c-fos proto-oncogene has been characterized. The serum response element (SRE), a region of the c-fos gene which controls growth factor-induced transcription, is now shown to mediate c-fos transcription in response to activation of L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels. Calcium-dependent transcriptional activation through the SRE is mediated by the serum response factor (SRF). Membrane depolarization induces phosphorylation of SRF at Ser-103, an event shown to enhance the ability of SRF to bind the SRE. Ca(2+)-induced SRF phosphorylation occurs via a pathway that may involve Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1545024884,"Fatty acid oxidation rapidly increases in the rabbit heart following birth. By inhibiting carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), malonyl-CoA is a potent regulator of fatty acid oxidation in the heart. We therefore addressed the hypothesis that a decrease in acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) activity and/or malonyl-CoA inhibition of CPT1 could account for the increase in the ability of the heart to oxidize fatty acids following birth. ACC activity and expression, malonyl-CoA levels, and mitochondrial CPT1 activity were measured in hearts from 1-day, 7-day, and 6-week-old rabbits. CPT1 activity and sensitivity to malonyl-CoA inhibition did not differ between 1-day, 7-day, or 6-week hearts (the IC50 for malonyl-CoA was 32.0 +/- 1.5, 36.0 +/- 0.3, and 36.3 nM, respectively). Western blot analysis with streptavidin showed that all hearts expressed similar amounts of both a 265-kDa (ACC-265) and 280-kDa isoform (ACC-280) of ACC. A progressive and significant decrease in malonyl-CoA levels was seen in 1-day, 7-day, and 6-week hearts (47 +/- 2, 40 +/- 2, and 26 +/- 2 nmol/g dry weight, respectively), paralleling a decline in ACC activity. We hypothesized that these developmental changes could be due to changes in hormonal regulation of cardiac ACC in the postnatal period. In isolated hearts from 1-day-old rabbits, the fatty acid oxidation rate was 9.01 +/- 1.10 nmol.g dry weight-1.min-1. Glucagon (1 ng/ml) did not alter this rate (11.03 +/- 1.42 nmol.g dry weight-1.min-1), but insulin (100 microunits/ml) resulted in a significant decrease in rate (4.81 +/- 0.82 nmol.g dry weight-1.min-1). ACC activity was markedly elevated in 1-day-old hearts perfused with insulin compared to control hearts or glucagon perfused hearts (0.415 +/- 0.052, 0.095 +/- 0.018, and 0.133 +/- 0.013 nmol of malonyl-CoA produced.g dry weight-1.min-1, respectively). Malonyl-CoA levels were also markedly elevated in 1-day hearts perfused with insulin (123.0 +/- 8.3, 2.0 +/- 0.4, and 1.8 +/- 0.6 nmol/g dry weight in insulin, control, and glucagon hearts, respectively). In 7-day-old rabbit hearts, the basal fatty acid oxidation rate had increased to 24.5 +/- 4.8 nmol.mg-1.min-1. In contrast to the 1-day-old hearts, insulin had no significant effect on fatty acid oxidation, although glucagon resulted in a significant increase in rates (38.9 +/- 12.2 and 80.7 +/- 9.1 nmol.g dry weight-1.min-1, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1546092720,"The alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (alpha 2MR/LRP) binds several ligands, including complex between the two chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and type-1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), and the single chain zymogen pro-urokinase (pro-uPA). We have used truncated variants of uPA and PAI-1 as well as Fab fragments of monoclonal antibodies with known epitopes to identify regions in the uPA.PAI-1 complex and in pro-uPA involved in binding to alpha 2MR/LRP.uPA.PAI-1 complex bound with high affinity (EC50 about 0.4 nM) via contacts in the PAI-1 moiety as well as the uPA serine proteinase domain and the uPAA chain. Pro-uPA bound with lower affinity (EC50 about 10 nM), and efficient binding to alpha 2MR/LRP was dependent on contact with both the A chain and the serine proteinase domain. We analyzed the effect of complex formation with the urokinase receptor since this is the primary target for binding of uPA.PAI-1 and pro-uPA at the cell surface, and since it has been demonstrated that urokinase receptor-bound uPA.PAI-1 complex is internalized following interaction with alpha 2 MR/LRP (Nykjaer, A., Petersen, C. M., Moller, B., Jensen, P.H., Moestrup, S.K., Holtet, T.L., Etzerodt M., Thogersen, H.C., Munch, M., Andreasen, P.A., and Gliemann, J. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 14543-14546). Soluble recombinant urokinase receptor blocked the binding of pro-uPA to alpha 2MR/LRP but caused only a slight reduction in the affinity for binding of uPA.PAI-1. Moreover, pro-uPA bound to the urokinase receptor at the cell surface was not internalized and degraded unless activated to uPA and complexed with PAI-1. We conclude that pro-uPA is protected against degradation via alpha 2MR/LRP when bound to uPAR due to shielding of a binding contact in the A chain, whereas the affinity of uPAR-bound uPA.PAI-1 complex for binding to alpha 2MR/LRP remains sufficient to allow rapid internalization and degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1498441627,"Maturation of the insulin proreceptor in a late Golgi compartment requires cleavage at an Arg-Lys-Arg-Arg processing site, suggesting involvement of furin, a transmembrane serine protease of the Kex2 family of processing enzymes. A genetically engineered secreted, soluble form of human furin (ss-furin), expressed by infection of insect cells with a recombinant baculovirus, was purified to near homogeneity. ss-Furin exhibited rapid and efficient cleavage of both isoforms of the human insulin proreceptor in solubilized extracts of cultured mammalian cells expressing preproreceptor cDNA. Proreceptor cleavage occurred at the physiological processing site as judged by the effects of mutations in this site on cleavage by purified ss-furin. Moreover, purified ss-furin exhibited specificity for proreceptor cleavage identical to that of the endogenous insulin proreceptor-processing enzyme. Furin thus displays the properties expected of an insulin proreceptor-processing enzyme in that it (i) cleaves the proreceptor efficiently and at the correct site; (ii) exhibits the same specificity in processing variant proreceptors as the endogenous enzyme; (iii) appears to be localized in the correct secretory compartment; and (iv) has the same broad pattern of tissue distribution as the insulin proreceptor."
https://openalex.org/W1554056120,"A beta is a 39-43-amino acid peptide that accumulates as extracellular aggregates in Alzheimer's disease-afflicted brain tissue. Contact between these aggregates and neurons is potentially pathogenic, although little is known about the cellular transduction mechanisms. We have investigated the impact of A beta aggregates on the neuronal control of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, which underlies signal transduction for multiple families of growth factor and adhesion receptors. Added to cultures of rat and human nerve cell lines, A beta aggregates evoked a non-desensitizing increase (1.3-3.6-fold) in tyrosine phosphorylation in a band at 118 kDa. The 118-kDa protein was determined by immunoprecipitation to be pp125FAK, not previously documented in cells of neuronal lineage. Immunoblots with anti-focal adhesion kinase (FAK) showed that A beta aggregates had no effect on FAK protein levels. The increase in FAK tyrosine phosphorylation occurred at doses of A beta aggregates that evoked lactate dehydrogenase release; evoked tyrosine phosphorylation preceded the first detectable lactate dehydrogenase release by 4 h. Like degeneration, the FAK response was dependent on A beta aggregation and neuronal differentiation. Since tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK is essential to its activity as a transduction component of integrin-, peptide-, and lysophosphatidic acid-mediated signaling, the data establish a link between A beta aggregates and signal transduction pathways implicated in diverse cell functions including neurite outgrowth, control of the cell cycle, and apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W159888840,"A rat cDNA-encoding ribosomal protein S3 was used to clone the S3 homolog in Drosophila melanogaster. The Drosophila gene was in turn used to construct fusions between S3 and glutathione S-transferase that were overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified on affinity columns, and subsequently used for antibody production and biochemical analysis. Antibody specific for S3 was originally tested to determine the subcellular location of S3 by Western (immunoblot) analysis. As expected, the S3 antigen was found associated with purified preparations of ribosomes, but notably the protein was also observed in the nucleus where it was found to be tightly associated with the nuclear matrix. This result, combined with the fact that S3 contains a nuclear localization signal and that the protein shares some homology to a yeast nuclease gene, suggested that S3 might possibly have a role in DNA metabolism. Tests were initially performed to see if S3 contained DNase activity, where it was subsequently determined that the protein specifically cleaved DNA containing an apurinic/apyrimidinic site via a beta-elimination reaction. The DNase activity was inactivated by antibody to S3, indicating that the apurinic/apyrimidinic lyase activity was associated with the Drosophila S3 protein. Taken together, these results suggest that S3 is among a growing class of multifunctional proteins with roles in transcription/translation and DNA repair."
https://openalex.org/W1505354077,"Mammalian transcription factor IIF (TFIIF) is a heterodimer composed of approximately 30-kDa (RAP30) and approximately 70-kDa (RAP74) subunits. TFIIF has been shown to bind RNA polymerase II and control the activity of the enzyme in both the initiation and elongation stages of transcription. Although previous studies have established a role for RAP30 in assembly of the preinitiation complex and in transcription initiation, information on the function of RAP74 in these processes has been lacking. Using a highly purified transcription system and assays that permit sensitive measurement of the contributions of both RAP30 and RAP74 to TFIIF function, we have investigated the roles of these TFIIF subunits in transcription initiation and elongation. Results of template competition experiments indicate that both RAP30 and RAP74 contribute to the formation of stable preinitiation intermediates containing RNA polymerase II. Investigation of the role of TFIIF in transcription initiation indicates that both RAP30 and RAP74 function in synthesis of the first few phosphodiester bonds of nascent transcripts and in formation of Sarkosyl-resistant pre-initiation intermediates. Finally, kinetic experiments indicate that both RAP30 and RAP74 function in TFIIF-mediated stimulation of the rate of RNA chain elongation by RNA polymerase II."
https://openalex.org/W1614026591,"Androgens and androgen receptor (AR) play important roles in sexual differentiation and prostatic cancer cell proliferation. To investigate the regulation of AR expression, a 2-kilobase pair 5'-flanking region of human AR gene including a 0.6-kilobase pair 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) was ligated to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene and characterized by CAT assay after transfection into HeLa cells. The results revealed that AR 5'-UTR was absolutely needed for the induction of CAT activity, but could not function as an enhancer for the AR transcription. A further study using a 180 base pairs (+21 to +202 including a stem-loop secondary structure at +109 to +129) within the AR 5'-UTR demonstrated that this region was sufficient to induce more CAT activity without changing the CAT mRNA expression. Taken together, these results strongly suggested that 5'-UTR of AR mRNA plays an essential role in the induction of AR translation, which may represent the first reported translational induction mechanism in the steroid receptor superfamily."
https://openalex.org/W1557261357,"Expression of cloned genes in prokaryotes such as Escherichia coli is a widely used technique in both basic research and biotechnology. Despite the availability of several E. coli expression vector systems, adequate levels of expression may not be achieved. Expressing proteins as fusions to the highly conserved eukaryotic protein ubiquitin has been reported by several investigators to enhance protein yield in both bacterial and eukaryotic systems. We have modified this technique by the co-expression in E. coli of a ubiquitin-fusion protein and the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ubiquitin-specific protease Ubp2. This allows the co-translational cleavage of engineered ubiquitin-fusion proteins expressed in E. coli. This system was used to express a human Pi class glutathione S-transferase (GST) GSTP1 as well as two mutant GSTP1 derivatives, Trp39–>Cys and Gln52–>Glu. The yield of these enzymes was improved 40-fold by using the ubiquitin-fusion/co-translational cleavage technique, and no uncleaved product was detected. The Trp39–>Cys mutant was totally devoid of GST activity, while the activity of the Gln52–>Glu mutant was reduced to 6% of wild-type GSTP1-1. As both of the mutated residues map within the glutathione-binding site, the reduced GST activity is consistent with a marked reduction in glutathione binding ability."
https://openalex.org/W1498787374,"Previous analysis of the human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma promoter indicated that the region of DNA from -251 to -215 (designated here as BE (binding element)) possessed silencer activity, as deletion of this region caused an increase in promoter activity. Based on this finding, we have conducted a series of experiments to characterize BE function and analyze the binding proteins which interact with this region. Transient transfection assays in the Jurkat T cell line revealed that the BE region possesses silencer activity, which is orientation-dependent when reinserted 5' to the IFN-gamma core promoter. However, when the BE region was inserted in front of a heterologous promoter (thymidine kinase (TK)), a mild enhancer activity was observed. Utilizing the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we have identified two major DNA-protein complexes (designated as S and E complexes) which interact with this region. Mutational analysis indicated that the silencer activity observed with the IFN-gamma promoter correlated with the S complex and the enhancer activity correlated with the E complex. Preliminary characterization of these two DNA-protein complexes has demonstrated the presence of multiple proteins in each complex. We have found that the S protein complex has a recognition sequence similar to the nuclear factor AP2, and we have identified the nuclear factor Yin-Yang 1 (YY1) as one of the proteins in the E complex."
https://openalex.org/W1512420564,"The L-isoaspartyl protein methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.77) has been proposed to be involved in the repair of spontaneously damaged proteins by facilitating the conversion of abnormal L-isoaspartyl residues to normal L-aspartyl residues. Based on the abundance of this enzyme in the seeds of a variety of plants and its unique substrate specificity, it has been hypothesized that it functions to prevent the accumulation of abnormal aspartyl residues in the proteins of aging seeds that can limit the viability of the embryo or its chances for germination. In this work, we show that the expression of the L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase is under developmental regulation in the winter wheat, Triticum aestivum. Methyltransferase mRNA and active enzyme are first detected in seeds during the late stages (III-IV) of caryopsis development. As mature seeds germinate, methyltransferase mRNA levels decline and are nearly undetectable by 72 h post-imbibition. Enzyme activity remains constant for 24 h post-imbibition and then decreases rapidly following the reduction of its corresponding mRNA. Methyltransferase activity is very low or undetectable in wheat seedlings, including leaf and root tissues. We show, however, that the L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase can be induced in vegetative tissues in response to hormone treatment and environmental stress. Abscisic acid, a phytohormone involved in seed development and desiccation tolerance, induces both methyltransferase mRNA and enzyme activity in 4-day-old wheat seedlings. Dehydration and salt stress also induce its transcription and enzymatic activity in seedlings. The ability of a plant to regulate methyltransferase activity in its seeds and vegetative tissues in response to desiccation, aging, and environmental stress may allow the plant to efficiently repair protein damage associated with these physiological changes."
https://openalex.org/W1531525140,"Using the yeast two-hybrid system, complementary DNA clones were isolated from a HeLa cell library encoding proteins that interacted with p52shc. One of these clones encoded the non-catalytic, COOH-terminal half of the cytosolic protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP-PEST. Expression of truncated forms of p52shc in the two-hybrid system revealed that the amino-terminal half of p52shc was sufficient for interaction with PTP-PEST. The p52 and p66 forms of Shc, but not the p46 form, bound to a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the region of PTP-PEST isolated from the two-hybrid screen. Similarly, when HeLa cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with PTP-PEST antiserum, p52shc and p66shc proteins, but not p46shc, co-precipitated. Shc-PTP-PEST complex formation was stimulated 6-8-fold by the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, while epidermal growth factor and serum had no effect. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate also stimulated phosphorylation of p52shc and p66shc. The muscarinic agonist carbachol (also an activator of protein kinase C) stimulated complex formation 3-5-fold in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. These results suggest a role for PTP-PEST in G protein receptor signaling and in cross-talk between G protein receptor and tyrosine kinase receptor pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1600596454,"Pneumolysin is a member of the family of related bacterial thiol-activated toxins, which share structural similarities and a proposed common cytolytic mechanism. Currently the molecular mechanism of membrane damage caused by these toxins remains a matter of controversy. A prerequisite for defining this mechanism is a detailed knowledge of the monomeric and oligomeric pneumolysin structures. We present for the first time details of the monomeric structure of a thiol-activated toxin, pneumolysin. Electron microscope images of metal-shadowed pneumolysin monomers show an asymmetric molecule composed of four domains. We have studied the conformation of pneumolysin monomer by low resolution hydrodynamic bead modeling procedures. The bead model dimensions and shape are derived solely from the electron micrographs. The bead model has been evaluated in terms of the predicted solution properties, which in turn have been compared to the experimental values of the sedimentation coefficient, s(20,w)0, obtained by analytical ultracentrifugation and the intrinsic viscosity, [eta]. Pneumolysin oligomers, observed as ring- and arc-shaped structures, were also examined by electron microscopy. Metal shadowing and negative staining methods were used to establish the overall dimensions of the oligomer and were used to produce a morphological model for the oligomer, incorporating monomer subunits based on the hydrodynamic bead model."

One of these antibodies could be used for the immunopurification of GABAA receptors containing gamma 1-subunits. These receptors exhibited [3H]muscimol and [3H]flunitrazepam binding, and their benzodiazepine binding properties were dramatically different from those of receptors precipitated by anti-gamma 2- or anti-gamma 3-antibodies. Western blot analysis of the immunopurified GABAA receptors indicated that the gamma 1-subunit exhibits an apparent molecular mass of 45-51 kDa. Furthermore, in addition to gamma 1-subunits, beta 2/3-, alpha 1-, alpha 2-, alpha 3-, and alpha 5-subunits could be detected in immunoaffinity column eluates from total brain. In contrast, gamma 2- or gamma 3-subunits could not be identified in GABAA receptors immunopurified by anti-gamma 1-antibodies. Similarly, gamma 1- and gamma 3-subunits or gamma 1- and gamma 2-subunits could not be identified in GABAA receptors purified by anti-gamma 2- or anti-gamma 3-antibodies, respectively.

Extrusion is an active process mediated by an ATP-dependent pump composed of two types of subunits, the integral membrane ArsB protein and the catalytic ArsA subunit. An in vitro assay for transport in everted membrane vesicles of E. coli was developed. Uptake of 73AsO2- by everted vesicles was time- and temperature-dependent and required both pump subunits. Transport required ATP; no other nucleotide, including GTP, CTP, UTP, or the nonhydrolyzable analog adenosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate), could substitute for ATP. Protonophores, ionophores, or inhibitors of other types of ion-motive ATPases did not inhibit arsenite uptake. The sulfhydryl reagent N-ethylmaleimide was a potent inhibitor of ATP-dependent arsenite accumulation in vesicles. The apparent Km values for ATP and arsenite were approximately 2 and 0.1 mM, respectively. Antimonite, the most potent activator of the ArsA ATPase, inhibited arsenite uptake with an apparent Ki of 10 microM."
https://openalex.org/W148769332,"The 26 S proteasome complex catalyzing ATP-dependent breakdown of ubiquitin-ligated proteins was purified from spinach leaves to near homogeneity by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, gel filtration on Biogel A-1.5, and glycerol density gradient centrifugation. The purified enzyme was shown to degrade multi-ubiquitinated, but not unmodified, lysozymes in an ATP-dependent fashion coupled with ATPase activity supplying energy for proteolysis and isopeptidase activity to generate free ubiquitin. By nondenaturing electrophoresis, the purified enzyme was separated into two distinct forms of the 26 S complex, named 26 S alpha and 26 S beta proteasomes, with different electrophoretic mobilities. The 26 S proteasome was found to consist of multiple polypeptides with molecular masses of 23-35 and 39-115 kDa, which were thought to be those of a 20 S proteasome with multicatalytic proteinase activity and an associated regulatory part with ATPase and deubiquitinating activities, respectively. The subunit multiplicity of the spinach 26 S proteasome closely resembled that of rat liver with minor differences in certain components. No sulfhydryl bond was involved in the assembly of this multicomponent polypeptide complex. Electron microscopy showed that the 26 S proteasome complex had a caterpillar-like shape, consisting of four central protein layers, assumed to be the 20 S proteasome, with asymmetric V-shaped layers at each end. These structural and functional characteristics of the spinach 26 S proteasome showed marked similarity to those of the mammalian 26 S proteasomes reported recently, suggesting that the 26 S proteasome is widely distributed in eukaryotic cells and is of general importance for catalyzing the soluble energy- and ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1540959479,"We have shown previously that human neutrophil microsomes contain a highly specific dehydrogenase which, in the presence of NADP+, converts 5S-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (5S-HETE) to its 5-oxo metabolite, 5-oxo-ETE, a potent agonist of these cells. However, intact neutrophils convert 5S-HETE principally to its omega-oxidation product, 5,20-diHETE, and to only small amounts of 5-oxo-ETE. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) dramatically shifts the metabolism of 5S-HETE by intact cells so that 5-oxo-ETE is the major metabolite. The objective of this investigation was to determine the mechanism for the stimulatory effect of PMA on 5-oxo-ETE formation. The possibility that oxidants released in response to PMA nonenzymatically oxidized 5S-HETE was ruled out, since PMA did not appreciably stimulate the formation of 5-oxo-ETE from 5R-HETE. On the other hand, inhibition of NADPH oxidase either by diphenylene iodonium or by mild heating nearly completely prevented the stimulatory effect of PMA on the formation of 5-oxo-ETE. The possibility that this effect was mediated by superoxide seems unlikely, since it was still observed, although somewhat attenuated, in the presence of superoxide dismutase. Moreover, superoxide generated by another mechanism (xanthine/xanthine oxidase) did not appreciably affect the formation of 5-oxo-ETE by neutrophils. However, phenazine methosulfate, which can nonenzymatically convert NADPH to NADP+, mimicked the effect of PMA on 5-oxo-ETE formation by intact neutrophils. It is concluded that PMA acts by activating NADPH oxidase, resulting in conversion of NADPH to NADP+, which enhances the formation of 5-oxo-ETE and reduces the formation of 5,20-diHETE. Serum-treated zymosan has an effect on the metabolism of 5S-HETE similar to that of PMA in that it also stimulates the formation of 5-oxo-ETE and inhibits that of 5,20-diHETE."
https://openalex.org/W6176682,"The promoter/regulatory region of the porcine P-450 cholesterol side chain cleavage (P450scc) gene was cloned from a porcine genomic library. This gene contains a GC-rich region (-130-100) that mediates insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and cAMP stimulation of gene expression in porcine granulosa cells. Stimulation of gene expression by cAMP occurs in 6 h, while IGF-I stimulation occurs in 24-48 h. This region is also responsive to insulin but not fibroblast growth factor. The effects of IGF-I and cAMP on gene expression in porcine granulosa cells are additive. In Y1 adrenal cells, the same region is responsive to cAMP but not to IGF-I. Gel shift assays using an oligonucleotide of this region and nuclear extract protein from porcine granulosa and Y1 adrenal cells identified three DNA-protein complexes (C1-C3). The binding activity of the complexes did not change with IGF-I or forskolin treatment of granulosa cells. Mutational analysis results were consistent with IGF-I regulating gene expression through the C2 DNA protein complex. Moreover, this complex binds differently in gel shift assay to mutant oligonucleotides with porcine and Y1 and nuclear extract protein. We conclude that IGF-I stimulates porcine P450scc gene expression through a distinct, cell-specific protein complex binding to a GC-rich domain."
https://openalex.org/W1610859041,"Folding catalysts of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), such as protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), accelerate the slow chemical steps, such as disulfide bond formation, that accompany protein folding. Molecular chaperones of the ER, notably the heavy chain-binding protein, BiP (grp78), bind and release unfolded proteins in an ATP-dependent fashion. In vitro, the fate of reduced, denatured lysozyme is dependent on whether the substrate interacts first with BiP or PDI. Depending on the ratio of PDI to substrate and order in which the components of the reaction are mixed, PDI can exhibit a foldase/chaperone activity, which increases the rate and extent of lysozyme refolding, or it can function as an anti-chaperone that promotes the formation of inactive, disulfide-linked lysozyme aggregates (Puig, A., and Gilbert, H.F. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 7764-7771). Reduced, denatured lysozyme, but not the native protein, interacts with BiP and efficiently stimulates its peptide-dependent ATPase activity. When present at substoichiometric amounts, BiP, like PDI, facilitates the formation of large, inactive lysozyme aggregates that are non-covalently associated with BiP. BiP and PDI compete for a limited number of sites in these insoluble aggregates. If BiP is present at a high molar excess, the chaperone binds unfolded lysozyme and inhibits its aggregation by maintaining it in a soluble, yet inactive, conformation, both in the presence or absence of ATP. Increasing concentrations of BiP decrease the extent, but not the initial rate, of refolding, suggesting that BiP and PDI compete for unfolded lysozyme and that the BiP-lysozyme complex is not a very good substrate for PDI either in the presence or absence of ATP. Depending on the BiP and PDI concentrations, unfolded lysozyme may either be efficiently refolded into the native conformation in a PDI-catalyzed reaction, or it may form both soluble and insoluble BiP-lysozyme complexes. In vitro, PDI- and BiP-facilitated aggregation, as well as the competition of the two proteins for substrate, reproduces many of the features of the quality control system of the ER."
https://openalex.org/W1581545645,"Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF-5A, older nomenclature, eIF-4D) is a highly conserved protein that contains the unusual amino acid hypusine (N epsilon-(4-amino-2-hydroxybutyl)lysine). The biosynthesis of hypusine occurs posttranslationally in only this protein by modification of a single lysine residue (Lys50 in the human eIF-5A precursor). The basis for the specificity of this modification with respect to the substrate protein was investigated using fragments of eIF-5A precursor protein, each containing this lysine residue, as substrates for deoxyhypusine synthase, the first enzyme in hypusine synthesis. Proteolytic fragments (5-6 kDa) of ec-eIF-5A (the precursor form of eIF-5A produced in Escherichia coli by expression of the human eIF-5A cDNA) generated by specific cleavage by endoproteinases Arg-C, Asp-N, or Glu-C, did not act as substrates for deoxyhypusine synthesis. A series of truncated forms of the eIF-5A precursor protein generated by expression in E. coli of recombinant deletion constructs from the human eIF-5A cDNA were tested. Truncation of up to 9 amino acid residues (Met1-Thr9) from the NH2 terminus or 64 amino acid residues (Leu91-Lys154) from the COOH terminus did not significantly decrease the substrate reactivity, but removal of an additional 10 amino acids from either side did. Deletion of 34 amino acid residues (Met1-Lys34) from the NH2 terminus or of 84 amino acid residues (Asp71-Lys154) from the carboxyl terminus caused complete loss of substrate property. The results obtained thus far define the minimum domain of the eIF-5A precursor protein required for enzymatic deoxyhypusine synthesis as Phe30-Asp80, which corresponds to a region of high amino acid conservation in this protein throughout the eukaryotic kingdom."
https://openalex.org/W1622834903,"It was previously shown that when cells of renal epithelial origin are exposed to hyperosmotic urea in concentrations unique to the renal medulla, abundance of mRNA encoding the immediate-early gene product Egr-1 is up-regulated. This phenomenon appears restricted to cells of renal epithelial origin. In the present study, the newly isolated murine renal inner medullary cell line mIMCD3 was used to determine whether the urea-induced increase in Egr-1 mRNA abundance is associated with increased expression of functional protein product, and whether this increase is transcriptionally mediated. In Western analysis, urea (200 mM) increased Egr-1 immunoreactivity 3-fold relative to sham-treated cells. [35S]Methionine pulse-labeling followed by immunoprecipitation confirmed that this increased immunoreactivity was associated with increased de novo Egr-1 protein synthesis. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that urea treatment induced a commensurate increase in specific DNA binding activity for the Egr-1 consensus sequence. In addition, the increase in Egr-1 mRNA expression accompanying urea treatment was a consequence of enhanced transcription, as determined by nuclear run-off assay. Taken together, these data indicate that hyperosmotic urea increases both Egr-1 transcription and new protein synthesis in renal epithelial cells in culture, and that this newly synthesized Egr-1 is a functional DNA-binding protein. To our knowledge, this is the first example of urea-inducible gene transcription. In addition, Egr-1 represents the first eukaryotic transcription factor transcriptionally activated by a hyperosmotic stressor."
https://openalex.org/W2147075811,"Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a member of a family of heterodimeric glycoprotein hormones that contain a common alpha subunit but differ in their hormone-specific beta subunits. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to examine the role of the five disulfide bonds in the alpha subunit on the folding, assembly with the hCG beta subunit, and in cases where dimer formation occurred, receptor binding and signal transduction. Cysteine residues in the disulfide bonds formed by cysteines 7-31, 10-60, 28-82, 59-87, and 32-84 (Lapthorn, A., Harris, D. Littlejohn, A., Lustbader, J. Canfield, R., Machin, K., Morgan, F., and Isaacs, N. (1994) Nature 369, 455-461) were converted to alanine, and these mutants were transfected alone or together with the wild-type hCG beta gene into Chinese hamster ovary cells. The alpha Cys-10, 28, 60, 82, and 84 mutants were not secreted and in most cases were degraded at a faster rate than the native subunit. In addition, these mutants failed to assemble with the hCG beta subunit. Mutants with alterations at alpha Cys-7, 31, 32, 59, or 87 were secreted and combined with the beta subunit. Heterodimers containing a 7-31 double mutant bound to human lutropin-chorionic gonadotropin receptor expressed in transfected human fetal kidney cells, and stimulated cAMP comparable to wild-type hCG. Dimers containing the beta subunit with either single mutant alpha 59, alpha 87, alpha 32, or the alpha 59-87 double mutant showed much lower affinity for the receptor than wild-type hCG. These results suggest that disulfide bonds associated with alpha 7, alpha 31, alpha 59, alpha 87, and alpha 32 are not essential for the alpha subunit to fold into a form that will combine with the hCG beta subunit and to produce a biologically active dimer. This contrasts with observations of the hCG beta subunit where all the disulfide bonds are required for efficient combination and folding (Suganuma, N., Matzuk, M., and Boime, I. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 19302-19307). In addition, the lack of secretion of some mutants reflects previous observations that proteins which do not fold correctly are rapidly degraded. Thus, alpha subunit mutants which fold properly are secreted and can form heterodimers."

These are synthesized as inactive precursors, but following proteolytic processing, they are stored in granules as active enzymes. We describe the establishment of a transgenic cellular model for expression of the human myeloid serine protease cathepsin G. The cDNA for preprocathepsin G was stably expressed in the rat basophilic/mast cell line RBL-1 and the translation product was characterized by use of biosynthetic labeling followed by immunoprecipitation, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and fluorography. Conversion into complex form of an asparagine-linked carbohydrate unit of approximately 3.5 kDa was shown, as judged by the products obtained upon treatment with endoglycosidase H and N-glycanase. Proteolytic processing of 32.5-kDa procathepsin G into a 31-kDa form, within 1-2 h after synthesis, was demonstrated by pulse-chase experiments. Further processing into a 30-kDa form also occurred to a minor extent. The processed forms were enzymatically active, as judged by affinity for the serine protease inhibitors diisopropylfluorophosphate and aprotinin. Translocation of processed forms of cathepsin G to high density fractions, indicating targeting of the protease to granules, was demonstrated by subcellular fractionation. The weak base NH4Cl was shown to delay the processing and enzymatic activation of cathepsin G, whereas the monovalent ionophore monensin completely inhibited both events. Our data demonstrate that human cathepsin G transfected to rat RBL-1 cells, is proteolytically processed into enzymatically active forms and that subcellular transfer to granular organelles occurs. As the processing of transgenic human cathepsin G corresponds to that of endogenous protease of myeloid cells, the model should provide new unique possibilities to further characterize the activation and granular targeting of myeloid serine proteases."
https://openalex.org/W1516740788,"The Klebsiella pneumoniae nifH promoter is very strictly controlled by nitrogen availability and highly dependent on sigma 54 and integration host factor (IHF) for expression. This promoter region has been used to examine the role of IHF in the activation of transcription from sigma 54-dependent promoters and to analyze the positional restrictions which may exist for an activation mechanism from distant sites such as this one. By functionally replacing the binding site of IHF by sequence-directed curved DNA fragments, it has been shown that the role of IHF in stimulating transcription is structural; it brings the molecules directly involved in the process into close proximity. Unlike other promoter regions with an activation mechanism at a distance, this IHF-dependent promoter requires a precise geometry for efficient transcription. In this sense, it resembles an activation mechanism from near sites. However, alternative functional structures which are very different from the native one can be isolated."
https://openalex.org/W1572929810,"By cDNA sequence analyses the proteases found within the secretory granules of immune/inflammatory cells appear to be translated initially as zymogens, but by amino-terminal sequencing they are stored within the granules in an active form. We now show that murine mast cell carboxypeptidase A (MC-CPA) is produced in a zymogen form (MC-pro-CPA) that is present at approximately 0.5% of the level of MC-CPA. MC-pro-CPA is an inactive precursor of MC-CPA and is located within the secretory granules of the mast cells. We have identified one mast cell line, KiSV-MC9, that produces MC-pro-CPA yet cannot process it to the active form despite the fact that these cells can process prochymase and protryptase to their active forms, indicating that a separate mechanism exists for activation of the serine proteases. We show that dipeptidylpeptidase-I is involved in the processing of murine mast cell prochymase and procathepsin G, but does not process MC-pro-CPA or protryptase. Thus, mast cell carboxypeptidase, tryptase, and chymase zymogens are each processed to their active forms by different mechanisms."

In the alpha-helical coiled coil domain, 2 histidines (His168 and His260) disrupt leucine or isoleucine heptad repeats. Substitution of His168 or/and His260 to leucine had no effect on AcLDL binding activities. However, the His260-replaced receptors had their ligand degradation activities diminished. Cell surface ligand release experiments under acidic pH clarified that His260 mutants lost their ligand dissociation activities at 37 degrees C. Furthermore, immunoelectron microscopic experiments using anti-scavenger receptor antibody showed that the His260 replaced receptors were not able to release gold-labeled AcLDL in endosomes. Here we propose an allosterical ligand dissociation mechanism by His260 in macrophage scavenger receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1598364554,"Critical steps in polypeptide chain folding within the bacterial cytoplasm have been difficult to identify. Salmonella cells infected with temperature-sensitive folding mutants of the P22 tailspike protein at restrictive temperature accumulated a metastable folding intermediate with a half-life of 6 min at 39 degrees C. The native trimeric tailspike contains 24 buried cysteines (8/chain) but neither disulfide bonds nor active site cysteines. Eighteen of the 24 cysteines are involved in strong hydrogen bonds (Thomas, G. J., Jr., Becka, R., Sargent, D., Yu, M.-H., and King, J. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 4181-4187). Cyanide and iodoacetamide prevented the folding and association of the restrictive temperature folding intermediate to the native state after shift to permissive temperature. The cytoplasmic folding intermediate was covalently modified by iodoacetamide within infected cells. Chains which had reacted with iodoacetamide were unable to proceed through the folding pathway. Iodoacetamide also reacted with a folding intermediate during the refolding of purified tailspike chains in vitro, inhibiting further folding. No reaction occurred with native tailspike in vivo or in vitro. The target residues in the intermediates were in the carboxyl terminus of the chain and may be a unique set of cysteine residues that are activated during protein folding, but not in the native state."
https://openalex.org/W1545435326,"To investigate cell cycle-dependent expression of interferon (IFN)-induced genes and signaling pathways, we examined the modulation of IFN-inducible gene expression and p91 activation, and JAK-1 and Tyk-2 kinases' activation in human Burkitt's lymphoma Daudi cells which were synchronized at different points in the cell cycle progression. We observed that each one of 100-, 67-, and 46-kDa 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (2-5(A)-synthetase) proteins had a unique expression pattern in different phases of the cell cycle which was different from the expression of 2-5(A)-synthetase proteins in exponentially growing Daudi cells. The cell cycle-dependent changes in the overall levels of expression of 2-5(A)-synthetase proteins correlated well with the induction of expression of 2-5(A)-synthetase mRNA as well as the appearance of IFN stimulatory gene factor-3 and expression and activation of p91 in cells released from the G1/S block in the absence of exogenous IFN-alpha. In addition, cells from the G1/S phase exhibited increased tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK-1 and Tyk-2 kinases and p91 by IFN-alpha as compared with asynchronized cells. Enhanced stimulation of activation of JAK-1, Tyk-2, and p91 by IFN-alpha was progressively reduced from G1/S to G2/M to pass G2/M. These findings demonstrate that the levels of constitutive and inducible expression of IFN-alpha-inducible genes, activation of p91, and tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK-1 and Tyk-2 kinases are differentially influenced by the state of the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1559963735,"The vacuolar-type proton-translocating ATPase of clathrin-coated vesicles is composed of an integral membrane proton channel (VB) and a peripheral catalytic sector (VC). Native enzyme can catalyze the hydrolysis of both MgATP and CaATP and support proton pumping when reconstituted into liposomes. In contrast, isolated VC catalyzes only Ca(2+)-activated ATP hydrolysis and cannot support proton pumping when reconstituted into liposomes (Xie, X.-S., and Stone, D. K. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 9859-9867). We now report that solubilized isolated VC can be reassembled with purified VB to restore properties of native enzyme, including Mg(2+)-activated ATP hydrolysis and proton-pumping capability. Investigation of this reassembly revealed that a heterodimer, composed of polypeptides of 50 and 57 kDa, stimulates Ca(2+)-activated ATPase activity of isolated VC 2-fold and Mg(2+)-activated ATPase activity catalyzed by the reassembled pump 9-fold. Moreover, this heterodimer stimulated proton transport by the reassembled pump > 20-fold. When separated from the proton pump, the dimer has no detectable kinase activity. Maximal stimulation occurs at a molar ratio of heterodimer to reassembled pump of 3, implying a structural, nonenzymatic mechanism. These data indicate that the 50-kDa and/or the 57-kDa polypeptide likely plays an essential and potentially regulatory role in the function of the proton-translocating ATPase of clathrin-coated vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W1599600016,"Tracheal gland morphogenesis and gland hypertrophy in disease involve the penetration of epithelial cells into the submucosa, a process that requires digestion of the basal lamina and the surrounding extracellular matrix. We observed that bovine tracheal gland cells invaded collagen substrates and were inhibited from doing so in the presence of a metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001. The gland cells, but not bovine tracheal surface epithelial cells, secreted a 72-kDa metalloproteinase. The purified enzyme could be activated with 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate and converted to an active 65-kDa form that was far more effective in degrading denatured collagen (gelatin) than nondenatured type I and IV collagens and was ineffective in degrading intact interstitial collagen fibers. At 25 degrees C, the initial rate of degradation of acid-solubilized type I collagen was approximately 50 mg of type I collagen cleaved per min per mg of enzyme, whereas acid-solubilized type IV collagen was degraded at approximately 250 mg cleaved per min per mg of enzyme. In contrast, at the same temperature, heat-denatured type I collagen was degraded 1000-fold more rapidly, while heat-denatured type IV collagen was cleaved 50-fold more rapidly. The activity of the enzyme was maximal at pH 7-8 and was completely abolished by the metalloproteinase inhibitors EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline. In immunoblots, the enzyme was recognized by an antibody directed against human gelatinase A, the 72-kDa gelatinase. The purified enzyme disrupted the distribution pattern of type IV collagen in the gland basal lamina, as well as of interstitial collagen in the underlying stromal tissue, as shown in tissue sections by immunocytochemistry. Using an antibody directed against the purified enzyme, we also showed by immunocytochemistry that the gelatinase was present in tracheal tissue and was specifically located at the periphery of some tracheal gland acini. Northern blots showed higher concentrations of gelatinase A mRNA in glands than in epithelium microdissected from adult cow tracheas. These data indicate that gelatinase A is a specialized product of the tracheal gland epithelial cell, a cell type normally invasive as part of its developmental program; the enzyme may play an important role in normal gland development and disease-associated hypertrophy."
https://openalex.org/W1605579668,"Abstract Prothrombinase assembly takes place on the surface of unsaturated phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylserine (PS) membranes in the presence of Ca2+, through the rapid association of membrane-bound factor Va and factor Xa. The present study uses saturated PCPS (75:25, w/w) vesicles to study prothrombinase assembly and catalytic properties in order to differentiate the influences of the membrane upon catalyst assembly, substrate delivery, and peptide bond cleavage. In contrast to studies using unsaturated phospholipid, prothrombin activation studies using saturated PCPS (75:25, w/w) (C14:0, C16:0, and C18:0) revealed up to a 20-fold decrease in prothrombinase activity. C18:0 membranes support at least 50% of the prothrombinase binding capacity (KdVa-Xa = 1 nM and nVa-Xa = 1.1) of C18:1 PCPS (75:25, w/w). Thus, the 95% loss in activity cannot be explained by gross alterations in catalyst concentration or assembly. Stopped-flow studies with saturated lipids demonstrate that factor Va, factor Xa, and prothrombin have decreased kon values. Compensatory changes in koff leave the Kd values for these protein-lipid interactions almost unchanged relative to unsaturated PCPS. The profoundly decreased activation rate on saturated phospholipid membranes as compared to unsaturated phospholipids is in part due to slowed substrate/enzyme delivery caused by the saturated lipids. However, studies using prethrombin-1 and C18:0 PCPS (75:25, w/w) also revealed a 15-fold decrease in activity for preassembled prothrombinase. Although there was a slight change in Km (+2-fold), the major cause of the decrease is an 18-fold decrease in kcat. Similar differences for Km and kcat values were obtained for prothrombin. Substrate delivery is thus only partially responsible for the diminished prothrombinase activity observed with saturated phospholipids. Since the activity of prothrombinase is decreased for both prothrombin and prethrombin-1 principally by reducing kcat, it appears that catalyst formation on saturated phospholipids somehow compromises the proteolytic activity of the enzyme complex. This implies that the phospholipid bilayer serves not merely as a surface for condensing the proteins but also as a functional element of the prothrombinase enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1662634831,"To study further the regulation of the heme-regulated eIF-2 alpha kinase (HRI), we have produced functional wild type HRI using the baculovirus expression system. The amount of recombinant HRI protein expressed in insect cells is approximately 10 times higher than levels in reticulocytes. Baculovirus-expressed HRI (BV-HRI) is indistinguishable from HRI purified from rabbit reticulocytes. It is active both as an autokinase and an eIF-2 alpha kinase. BV-HRI is regulated by heme in vitro as well as in intact insect cells. Coexpression of the wild type HRI with the inactive K199R HRI, S51A eIF-2 alpha, or interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) results in diminished expression of these proteins. Expression of wild type HRI also results in severe inhibition of general protein synthesis in Sf9 cells when compared with cells expressing K199R HRI or IL-beta. In addition, the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of eIF-2B is suppressed in Sf9 cells expressing wild type HRI but not in cells expressing the K199R HRI or IL-1 beta. Furthermore, expression of wild type HRI is increased by coexpression with the nonphosphorylatable S51A eIF-2 alpha or by the addition of hemin, which inhibits HRI activity. These results provide evidence that translational regulation by phosphorylation of eIF-2 alpha and sequestration of eIF-2B can operate in insect cells."

More information about the topology of their constitutive protein, the S (small envelope) protein, is a prerequisite to any rational attempt to replace region of this protein with foreign epitopes without modifying the assembly of the particle. The topology of the S protein within the lipid membrane was investigated here by combining extensive proteolysis of the external protein domains with proteinase K and (FTIR-ATR). The proteolytic hydrolysis of the S protein and the identification of the digestion products allowed characterization of the membrane-protected regions of the protein. FTIR spectra of the digested hepatitis B particles revealed that the peptides associated with the particles are rich in alpha-helix structure. The kinetic of 2H/H exchange provided evidence that a large fraction of the native S protein is poorly accessible to the aqueous medium."

In addition, the crystal structure of ALBP with bound arachidonic acid has also been obtained. Crystallographic analysis of the arachidonic acid.ALBP complex along with the previously reported oleic acid-ALBP structure (Xu, Z., Bernlohr, D. A., and Banaszak, L. J. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 7874-7884) provides a framework for the molecular examination of protein-lipid association. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed high affinity association of both unsaturated fatty acids with the protein. The calorimetric data yielded the following thermodynamic parameters for arachidonic acid: Kd = 4.4 microM, n = 0.8, delta G = -7370 cal/mol, delta H = -6770 cal/mol, and T delta S = +600 cal/mol. For oleic acid, the thermodynamic parameters were Kd = 2.4 microM, n = 0.9, delta G = -7770 cal/mol, delta H = -6050 cal/mol, and T delta S = +1720 cal/mol. The identification of thermodynamically dominating enthalpic factors for both fatty acids are consistent with the crystallographic studies demonstrating the interaction of the fatty acid carboxylate with a combination of Arg106, Arg126, and Tyr128. The crystallographic refinement of the protein-arachidonate complex was carried out to 1.6 A with the resultant R factor of 0.19. Within the cavity of the crystalline binding protein, the arachidonate was found in a hairpin conformation. The conformation of the bound ligand is consistent with acceptable torsional angles and the four cis double bonds in arachidonate. These results demonstrate that arachidonate is a ligand for ALBP. They provide thermodynamic and structural data concerning the physical basis for protein-lipid interaction and suggest that intracellular lipid-binding proteins may mediate the biological effects of polyunsaturated fatty acids in vivo."

Mutation of this element also results in a > 100-fold decrease in basal prolactin gene expression. This is characteristic of cAMP response elements, but the importance of this element to basal prolactin gene transcription was previously unrecognized. The insulin response element, -97 to -67, is not homologous to previously reported insulin response elements and mediates the 10-fold increases in prolactin gene expression due to insulin observed in GH cells. These elements also function to mediate insulin and cAMP responses from the heterologous delta MTV-CAT reporter plasmid. Together, insulin and cAMP increase prolactin gene expression additively. The clustering of these elements may provide clues to the independent and possible coordinate regulation by these effectors."
https://openalex.org/W1568253909,"Previous studies identified a 115-base pair (bp) region of the farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) synthase promoter which is involved in the transcriptional regulation of this gene by sterols (Spear, D. H., Kutsunai, S. Y., Correll, C. C., and Edwards, P. A. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 14462-14469). In the current study we fused a 117-bp fragment, containing this region of interest, upstream of the heterologous minimal promoter of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were stably transfected with this fusion gene and incubated in the absence or presence of sterols. Analysis of CAT mRNA by primer extension indicated that transcription of the fusion gene was under sterol-mediated control. Thus, when cellular sterols were present, the CAT mRNA levels were reduced 2-4-fold. To further localize the FPP synthase sterol-responsive element(s), additional promoter-reporter gene constructs containing either deletions or mutations were constructed and transfected into CHO or CV-1 cells. These studies localized a 6-bp region (ATTGGC) that is required for both transcriptional induction in the absence of sterols and transcriptional repression in the presence of sterols. Gel shift and footprinting analyses demonstrated that nuclear proteins isolated from CHO cells bound to six distinct regions of the promoter between nucleotides -293 to -47. Taken together, these results further define both the cis-acting elements controlling normal transcription of the FPP synthase gene and identify a novel sequence involved in sterol regulation."
https://openalex.org/W53686793,"Actobindin purified from Acanthamoeba castellanii inhibits the nucleation, but not the elongation, phase of actin polymerization. Previously, we had speculated that actobindin, which can simultaneously bind two actin monomers (Bubb, M.R., Lewis, M.S., and Korn, E.D. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 3820-3826), might preferentially interact with small oligomers and inhibit their ability to elongate (Lambooy, P.K., and Korn, E.D. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 12836-12843). In the accompanying paper (Bubb, M.R., Lewis, M.S., and Korn, E.D. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 25587-25591), we show that under non-polymerizing conditions, actobindin binds to covalently cross-linked actin dimers with higher affinity than to two actin monomers. The sedimentation velocity and fluorescence anisotropy experiments described in this paper show that actobindin prevents the formation of actin oligomers larger than an actin dimer under conditions in which, in the absence of actobindin, actin rapidly polymerizes to F-actin with no detectable small oligomers. Moreover, the molar concentration of actin dimer formed in the presence of actobindin can exceed the total actobindin concentration. These results indicate that actobindin does not form a stable complex with native actin dimer but, rather, causes the accumulation of dimers that are unable to nucleate polymerization or self-associate."
https://openalex.org/W1486308083,"Phycoerythrin 545 is a biliprotein having a polypeptide structure of alpha 2 beta 2, and each alpha and beta polypeptide has chromophores. Circular dichroism (CD) and absorption spectroscopy in the visible region together with various biochemical protocols have been used to study these chromophores. The CD spectrum exhibits overlapping positive and negative bands. Exciton splitting between closely-spaced pairs of chromophores produces a CD spectrum that has positive and negative bands of equal rotational strengths, a conservative spectrum. Alternatively, any positive or negative band could arise from a single chromophore. The results of this study demonstrate that exciton splitting is the likely cause of the negative and corresponding positive bands. The CD spectra of the separated alpha and beta polypeptides, under conditions where the polypeptide structure is denatured, have no negative bands. When the polypeptides are allowed to refold individually, the chromophores on the beta polypeptide regain a combination of negative and positive CD bands. The spectrum of the alpha polypeptide shows no evidence of exciton splitting under these refolding conditions. In another approach, urea is added to the protein in low concentrations, which result in changes in the conformation and perhaps association of the protein. A difference CD spectrum of native protein minus protein in 0.8 M urea shows a spectrum characteristic of exciton splitting. Moreover, the remaining CD spectra in 0.8, 1.6, or 2.4 M urea still show the possibility of further exciton splitting, but a slightly different wavelengths from the spectrum that is deleted by 0.8 M urea. This finding may suggest that there are two types of exciton splitting."
https://openalex.org/W1493723286,"Actobindin, a 9.8-kDa protein purified from Acanthamoeba castellanii, contains two actin-binding sites that can simultaneously bind two actin monomers. However, actobindin inhibits actin polymerization to a greater extent than can be explained by its affinity for actin monomers (site-specific KD = 3.3 microM). This paradox would be resolved if actobindin could interfere with the nucleation phase of polymerization by using both binding sites to bind simultaneously to an actin oligomer because the interaction with oligomer would be thermodynamically favored over that with actin monomer. We now show that a covalently cross-linked actin dimer prepared from cross-linked F-actin binds to actobindin with high affinity (apparent KD = 11 nM) in accordance with theoretical predictions for simultaneous binding of two actin subunits per single actobindin and consistent with the hypothesis that actobindin might bind to native actin oligomers and prevent them from nucleating polymerization. Furthermore, the interaction with cross-linked dimer exhibits specificity in that an isomeric cross-linked actin dimer with more rapid electrophoretic mobility binds weakly to actobindin. However, only this isomeric dimer is produced when cross-linking reagents are added to actin undergoing polymerization in the presence of actobindin. Therefore, if actobindin inhibits polymerization by interacting with a native dimer whose conformation is similar to that of the cross-linked dimer with slower electrophoretic mobility, then actobindin must either block the cross-linking sites or convert the dimer to a different conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1541189754,"The HT-1080 human fibrosarcoma cell line exhibited a plasminogen-dependent ability to inactivate recombinant anaphylatoxin C5a or zymosan-activated serum. The inactivation was obtained at physiological levels of both plasminogen (2 microM) and C5a (1-5 nM). Inactivated C5a and zymosan-activated serum were no longer able to induce chemotaxis and degranulation of neutrophils. Inactivation of C5a paralleled the emergence of plasmin activity, assayed by cleavage of the synthetic substrate H-D-valyl-L-leucyl-L-lysine-p-nitroanilide (S-2251). Both C5a inactivation and S-2251 cleavage were inhibited by the plasmin inhibitor alpha 2-antiplasmin, the urokinase inhibitor amiloride, and by anti-urokinase antibodies. In a cell-free system, inactivation of C5a was shown to depend on the simultaneous presence of urokinase and plasminogen and was inhibited by alpha 2-antiplasmin and by anti-urokinase antibodies. SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis demonstrated the cleavage of C5a by the plasminogen activation system and inhibition of the cleavage by amiloride. Amino acid sequencing of the band corresponding to the C5a degradation product revealed that C5a was cleaved at positions Lys14-His15 and Arg40-Ile41; cleavage at position Arg40-Ile41 seemed to be responsible for the loss of activity. Since neoplastic cells extensively produce and exhibit plasminogen activator activity, the present observations suggest that plasminogen activation may, by inactivation of C5a, reduce the anti-tumor immune response and support the immunological escape phenomenon of tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1619626439,"Abstract Molecular modeling suggested that the large and small domain of mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase might be linked by an engineered disulfide bond that could be expected to interfere with ligand-induced and syncatalytic changes in conformation and thus to assist in the elucidation of their significance for the catalytic mechanism. His-352, which is situated in the small domain close to Cys-166 of the large domain, was replaced with a cysteine residue by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. Aspartate aminotransferase H352C, that had not been exposed to reducing conditions, in part contained a disulfide bond between Cys-166 and Cys-352. Exposure to a reducing agent cleaved the crosslink completely and produced an enzyme derivative with 8% of the activity of the wild type enzyme. Cu2+-mediated autoxidation resulted in complete formation of the disulfide bond and a decrease in enzymic activity to 2%. Independently of the redox state of the disulfide bond, the H352C substitution seems to shift the equilibrium from the open toward the closed conformation of the enzyme. This change in conformation was accompanied by an increase in the binding affinity for both the amino and oxo acid substrate by one order of magnitude. Apparently, 1-2 kcal/mol of the binding energy of the substrates are no longer diverted to shift the conformational equilibrium toward the closed conformation. The kcat/Km values were unchanged or even increased in the reduced form of the mutant enzyme and only slightly decreased in its oxidized form. Both the disulfide-independent decrease in enzymic activity, as observed in reduced aspartate aminotransferase H352C and also in two other mutant enzymes (C166H/H352C and H352Q), and the redox-dependent modulation of activity indicate that unhindered domain movements are essential for full catalytic competence of aspartate aminotransferase."
https://openalex.org/W2171448945,"The reduced abnormal subunits of two M-type hemoglobins, Boston (His alpha 58–>Tyr) and Saskatoon (His beta 63–>Tyr), have been determined in the presence of normal human hemoglobin A by measurement of C-O stretch bands in infrared spectra of carbon monoxide complexes. Use of an infrared microscope coupled to a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer of high sensitivity permitted measurements to be made on as small a hemoglobin mixture as is contained in a single erythrocyte. The abnormal subunits of both Hbs M exhibit bands near 1970 cm-1 compared with bands near 1951 cm-1 for the normal subunits. The increase in 1970 cm-1 band intensity upon erythrocyte reduction with dithionite provided a measure of the extent of abnormal subunit oxidation; in cell suspensions about 60% of the abnormal subunits of Hb M Boston and 80% for Hb M Saskatoon remained reduced. The amount of Hb present as abnormal Hb averaged about 25% for Hb M Boston cells and about 50% for Hb M Saskatoon cells. However, the ratio of Hb M to Hb A in individual cells varied markedly, with the ratio expected to decrease as the cell ages. These results demonstrate the unique utility of infrared microspectroscopy for the study of differences in abnormal Hb status among individual erythrocytes."
