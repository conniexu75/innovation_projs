https://openalex.org/W2091477850,The human and Drosophila heat shock transcription factors (HSFs) are multi-zipper proteins with high-affinity binding to DNA that is regulated by heat shock-induced trimerization. Formation of HSF trimers is dependent on hydrophobic heptad repeats located in the amino-terminal region of the protein. Two subregions at the carboxyl-terminal end of human HSF1 were identified that maintain the monomeric form of the protein under normal conditions. One of these contains a leucine zipper motif that is conserved between vertebrate and insect HSFs. These results suggest that the carboxyl-terminal zipper may suppress formation of trimers by the amino-terminal HSF zipper elements by means of intramolecular coiled-coil interactions that are sensitive to heat shock.

https://openalex.org/W1607258414,"Synthetic peptides corresponding to the pseudosubstrate domains of protein kinase C (PKC) have been used as specific inhibitors of PKC in in vitro assays and permeabilized cell systems. However, their use in vivo was hampered by the impermeability of the plasma membrane for such peptides. Here, we show that N-myristoylation of the PKC pseudosubstrate nonapeptide Phe-Ala-Arg-Lys-Gly-Ala-Leu-Arg-Gln permits its use as an inhibitor of PKC in intact cells. The myristoylated peptide, myr-psi PKC, inhibits phosphorylation of the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate protein, as induced by 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate, and the activation of phospholipase D by bradykinin, which strictly depends on PKC. Half-maximal inhibition is obtained at concentrations of 8 and 20 microM, respectively. An N-myristoylated peptide derived from an inhibitor protein of the cAMP-dependent protein kinases, Myr-Gly-Arg-Arg-Asn-Ala-Ile-His-Asp-Ile, was ineffective. These results show that myr-psi PKC is a selective and cell-permeable inhibitor of PKC."

https://openalex.org/W2018938581,"Nitrosoureas form O6-alkylguanine-DNA adducts that are converted to G to A transitions, the mutation found in the activated ras oncogenes of nitrosourea-induced mouse lymphomas and rat mammary tumors. These adducts are removed by the DNA repair protein O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase. Transgenic mice that express the human homolog of this protein in the thymus were found to be protected from developing thymic lymphomas after exposure to N-methyl-N-nitrosourea. Thus, transgenic expression of a single human DNA repair gene is sufficient to block chemical carcinogenesis. The transduction of DNA repair genes in vivo may unravel mechanisms of carcinogenesis and provide therapeutic protection from known carcinogens."
https://openalex.org/W1967071341,"The p34CDC28 protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a homolog of the p34cdc2 protein kinase, a fundamental regulator of cell division in all eukaryotic cells. Once activated it initiates the visible events of mitosis (chromosome condensation, nuclear envelope breakdown, and spindle formation). The p34CDC28 protein also has a critical role in the initiation of DNA synthesis. The protein kinase activity is regulated by cycles of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation and by periodic association with cyclins. An endogenous 40-kilodalton protein (p40) originally identified as a substrate of the p34CDC28 protein kinase was purified. The p40 protein bound tightly to p34CDC28 and inhibited the activity of the kinase. The p40 protein may provide another mechanism to regulate p34CDC28 protein kinase activity."

https://openalex.org/W1810029706,"We have investigated the role of the proto-oncogene HRas in cardiac cell growth and hypertrophy. By direct needle microinjection of activated Ras protein into primary neonatal rat ventricular cardiac myocytes, we find that, unlike many other cell types, Ras does not induce DNA synthesis in these cells. However, injection of activated Ras does induce expression of both the c-Fos and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) genes. Expression of both these genes is associated with the hypertrophic response in ventricular myocytes suggesting that Ras is involved in the hypertrophic signalling pathway. Ras injection also causes morphological changes in the cells so that they increase in profile and show changes in the organization of the contractile apparatus. Further support for a role for Ras in the hypertrophic response was obtained from studies showing that activated Ras stimulates ANF promoter activity in transient transfection assays. We also show that a dominant interfering Ras mutant inhibits the hypertrophic stimulation of the ANF promoter by phenylephrine, indicating a role for Ras in the hypertrophic effect of an alpha-adrenergic agonist."

https://openalex.org/W2082363563,"Although isolated neurons can generate rhythmic activity, they have not yet been shown to generate rhythms with a period in the circadian range (near 24 hours). The eye of the mollusk Bulla gouldiana expresses a circadian rhythm in optic nerve impulses that is generated by electrically coupled cells known as basal retinal neurons (BRNs). Daily fluctuations in the membrane potential of the BRNs appear to be driven by a rhythm in membrane conductance. Isolated BRNs exhibited spontaneous conductance changes similar to those observed in the intact retina. Membrane conductance was high in the late subjective night and decreased approximately twofold near projected dawn during at least two circadian cycles in culture. The persistence of daily conductance changes in isolated BRNs indicates that individual neurons can function as circadian pacemakers."
https://openalex.org/W1525365796,"The retroviral integrase (IN) protein is essential for integration of retroviral DNA into the host cell genome. To identify functional domains within the protein and to assess the importance of conserved residues, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of HIV-1 IN and analyzed the mutants in vitro for IN-mediated activities: 3' processing (att site-specific nuclease activity), strand transfer (the joining of att site oligonucleotides to target DNA), disintegration (the reverse of strand transfer), and integration site selection. Changing the conserved residue His-16 either to Cys or to Val in a proposed zinc-finger region had minimal effect on IN activities. Alteration of two highly conserved amino acid residues, Asp-116-->Ile and Glu-152-->Gly, each resulted in complete or nearly complete loss of 3' processing, strand transfer, and disintegration, whereas alteration of another conserved residue, Trp-235-->Glu, had no demonstrable effect on any of the activities in vitro. Two mutants, Asp-64-->Val and Arg-199-->Cys delta, each demonstrated differential effects on IN activities. Asp-64-->Val has no demonstrable strand transfer or disintegration activity yet maintains 3' processing activity at a diminished level. Arg-199-->Cys delta, which lacks part of the carboxyl terminus of IN, has impaired strand transfer activity without loss of disintegration activity. Use of a target site selection assay showed that all of our mutants with strand transfer activity maintain the same integration pattern as wild type IN. We conclude that not all highly conserved IN residues are essential for IN activities in vitro, zinc coordination by the proposed zinc-finger domain may not be required for the activities assayed, alteration of single residues can yield differential effects on IN activities, and target site selection into naked DNA is not necessarily altered by changes in strand transfer activity."

https://openalex.org/W1521169671,"We have investigated the mechanism by which LAMP-1, a principal protein of the lysosomal membrane, is targeted to lysosomes. Mutagenesis and transfection experiments indicate that the motif Tyr-X-X-hydrophobic residue at the carboxyl terminus of the 11-amino acid cytoplasmic tail of the protein constitutes the lysosomal targeting signal for LAMP-1. This motif directs CD44, a cell surface hyaluronate receptor, to the lysosomal membrane, but only when the signal is placed at the carboxyl-terminus of a truncated cytoplasmic tail. The signal did not confer lysosomal targeting when it was situated internally or at the carboxyl terminus of the normal CD44 cytoplasmic tail. An apparent paradox is that similar Tyr-containing sequences mediate internalization, but not lysosomal targeting, of several receptors. Of possible relevance is the additional finding that purified LAMP-1 protein lacks the two carboxyl-terminal residues predicted by cDNA, both of which are essential for proper trafficking. A model is proposed in which lysosomal targeting is distinguished from receptor internalization through proteolytic modification of the internalization signal."
https://openalex.org/W2033857573,"Oncogenes discovered in retroviruses such as Rous sarcoma virus were generated by transduction of cellular proto-oncogenes into the viral genome. Several different kinds of junctions between the viral and proto-oncogene sequences have been found in different viruses. A system of retrovirus vectors and a protocol that mimicked this transduction during a single cycle of retrovirus replication was developed. The transduction involved the formation of a chimeric viral-cellular RNA, strand switching of the reverse transcription growing point from an infectious retrovirus to the chimeric RNA, and often a subsequent deletion during the rest of viral DNA synthesis. A short region of sequence identity was frequently used for the strand switching. The rate of this process was about 0.1 to 1 percent of the rate of homologous retroviral recombination."
https://openalex.org/W1581834336,"The synthesis and posttranslational modification of lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase were studied in a cell-free translation system and in mammalian cells transfected with acid alpha-glucosidase cDNA constructs. The newly synthesized precursor, sequestered in the endoplasmic reticulum, was demonstrated to be membrane-bound by lack of signal peptide cleavage, and to be catalytically inactive. Sugar chain modification was shown to occur in the Golgi complex and to be dependent on the rate of transport. From the trans-Golgi network different routes were found to be followed by acid alpha-glucosidase. A fraction of precursor molecules, proteolytically released from the membrane anchor, appeared to enter the secretory pathway and was recovered from the cell culture medium in a catalytically active form. A second fraction was transported to the lysosomes and was trimmed in a stepwise process at both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends. The intramolecular cleavage sites were determined. Involvement of thiol proteinases was demonstrated. Specificity for the natural substrate glycogen was gained during the maturation process. The phosphomannosyl receptor is assumed to be instrumental in the lysosomal targeting of acid alpha-glucosidase, but a phosphomannosyl receptor-independent transport of membrane-bound precursor molecules to the lysosomes, either directly or via the plasma membrane, cannot be excluded."

https://openalex.org/W1554354855,"Abstract The 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp90) is a well conserved, abundant cytosolic protein believed to be a chaperone of most steroid receptors. We have recently demonstrated that hsp90 has an ATP-binding site and autophosphorylating activity (Csermely, P., and Kahn, C. R. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 4943-4950). Circular dichroism analysis of highly purified hsp90 from rat liver shows that ATP induces an increase of beta-pleated sheet content of hsp90. Vanadate, molybdate, and heat treatment at 56 degrees C induce a similar change in the circular dichroism spectrum. Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy reveals an ATP-induced increase in the interchain interactions of the 90-kDa heat shock protein due to an increase in its beta-pleated sheet content. In further studies we found that ATP: 1) decreases the tryptophan fluorescence of hsp90 by 11.6 +/- 1.9%; 2) increases the hydrophobic character of the protein as determined by its distribution between an aqueous phase and phenyl-Sepharose; and 3) renders hsp90 less susceptible to tryptic digestion. Our results suggest that hsp90 undergoes an open-->closed conformational change after the addition of ATP, analogous in many respects to the similar changes of the DnaK protein, the immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BiP/GRP78), and hsp70. The ATP-induced conformational change of hsp90 may be important in regulating its association with steroid receptors and other cellular proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2012018496,"Homeodomains are folded into a characteristic three-dimensional structure capable of recognizing DNA in a sequence-specific manner. We show that correct target site selection by the yeast alpha 2 protein requires, as well as its homeodomain, an adjacent short and apparently unstructured region of the protein. This flexible homeodomain extension is responsible for specifying an interaction with a second regulatory protein, MCM1, which permits the cooperative binding of the two proteins to an operator. Two additional experiments suggest that this extension-homeodomain arrangement is likely to have some generality. First, when the extension of alpha 2 is grafted onto the Drosophila engrailed homeodomain, it yields a protein with the DNA binding specificity of engrailed and the ability to bind cooperatively to DNA with MCM1. Second, the alpha 2 extension specifies interaction not only with the yeast MCM1 protein, but also with the related human protein SRF."
https://openalex.org/W1480117485,"Abstract The c-myb protooncogene is preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cells and is required for cell cycle progression at the G1/S boundary. Because c-myb encodes a transcriptional activator that functions via DNA binding, it is likely that c-myb exerts its biological activity by regulating the transcription of genes required for DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression. One such gene, cdc2, encodes a 34-kDa serine-threonine kinase that appears to be required for G1/S transition in normal human T-lymphocytes. To determine whether c-myb is a transcriptional regulator of cdc2 expression, we subcloned a segment of a cdc2 human genomic clone containing extensive 5'-flanking sequences and part of the first exon. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of two closely spaced Myb binding sites that interact with bacterially synthesized Myb protein within a region extending from nucleotides -410 to -392 upstream of the transcription initiation site. A 465-base pair segment of 5'-flanking sequence containing these sites was linked to the CAT gene and had promoter activity in rodent fibroblasts. Cotransfection of this construct with a full-length human c-myb cDNA driven by the early simian virus 40 promoter resulted in a 6-8-fold enhancement of CAT activity that was abrogated by mutations in the Myb binding sites. These data suggest that c-myb participates in the regulation of cell cycle progression by activating the expression of the cdc2 gene."
https://openalex.org/W1485062679,"Using a human cell-free extract, we have recently shown that thymine dimers are removed from DNA in oligonucleotides 27-29 nucleotides in length (Huang, J. C., Svoboda, D. L., Reardon, J. T., and Sancar, A. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 89, 3664-3668). In this study we find that the excision reaction is dependent on ATP, the excised fragments range in length from 27-32 nucleotides, and have 5'-P and 3'-OH termini. We also found that a thymine-psoralen furan side monoadduct is excised from the DNA with a similar incision pattern, indicating that in humans bulky adducts are removed from DNA by the same enzyme system which hydrolyzes mainly the 22-24th and the 5th phosphodiester bonds 5' and 3', respectively, to the lesion. This incision pattern might be common to eukaryotic excision nucleases as thymine dimers were removed from DNA by the same dual incision pattern by Xenopus laevis oocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1923199073,"Mouse mammary carcinoma mutant cell line FUA169, characterized by high GM3 ganglioside content, was established from parent cell line FM3A/F28-7, which has high lactosyl ceramide (LacCer) content but no GM3. FUA169 displays no changes in protein glycosylation, and is a typical glycolipid mutant differing from its parent in that it contains high quantities of GM3 and GlcCer, but no LacCer (see accompanying paper; Tsuruoka, T., Tsuji, T., Nojiri, H., Holmes, E. H., Hakomori, S. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 2211-2216). In contrast to parent F28-7 cells, FUA169 cells showed clear adhesion to fibronectin (FN). Several lines of evidence indicate that adhesion of FUA169 cells to FN requires the presence of GM3, which supports the function of integrin receptor. (i) Both FUA169 and F28-7 cells express the same quantity of FN integrin receptor, which consists of alpha 5 beta 1 (sensitive to RGDS peptide) and alpha 4 beta 1 (sensitive to CS1 peptide). However, adhesion to FN-coated plates, regardless of type of FN, was much higher for FUA169 than for F28-7 cells. (ii) F28-7 cells, which normally lack GM3 and adhere only weakly to FN, acquired GM3 during incubation in GM3-containing medium, and subsequently adhered strongly to FN. (iii) Cholesterol-lecithin liposomes (cholesterol was 14C-labeled) incorporating alpha 5 beta 1 receptor isolated from human placenta showed clear adhesion to FN-coated plates, and this adhesion was completely inhibited by RGDS peptide and by anti-beta 1 mAb ZH1. When liposomes included a moderate quantity of GM3 (0.22-0.44 micrograms (0.2-0.4 nmol)/55 micrograms of phosphatidylcholine, 33 micrograms of cholesterol, 5 micrograms of alpha 5 beta 1 in liposome), adhesion was enhanced significantly. In contrast, adhesion was greatly reduced below control level for alpha 5 beta 1 liposomes containing a higher quantity (2.2 micrograms; > 2 nM) of GM3. Adhesion to FN was also inhibited, but never enhanced, for alpha 5 beta 1 liposomes with similar composition but containing 0.4 nmol (or other quantities) of LacCer or GlcCer instead of GM3. These findings suggest that the greater adhesion to FN by FUA169 cells, relative to parent F28-7 cells, is due to functional support by GM3 of alpha 5 beta 1 integrin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1556189642,"Abnormal activation of the protease calpain in the lens may be a cause of cataracts. Cataracts were induced in 10-day-old rats by a single overdose of sodium selenite. The water-insoluble protein from the opaque lens nucleus was separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis, electroblotted onto membranes, and the NH2-terminal sequence of partially degraded beta-crystallin polypeptides determined. Selenite cataractous lenses contained four major structural proteins, beta B1, beta B3, beta A3/A1, and beta A4 crystallins, missing from 5 to 49 amino acids from their NH2 termini. Incubation of intact beta-crystallins with calpain II in vitro produced identical cleavage sites. This provided further evidence for the role of calpain in the production of light scattering insoluble protein in cataractous lenses and also suggested that a similar process may lead to lens protein insolubilization during aging."
https://openalex.org/W1512536736,"A group of recently isolated parsley (Petroselinum crispum) cDNAs representing genes that are transcriptionally activated upon fungal infection or elicitor treatment have been demonstrated to encode tyrosine decarboxylase (TyrDC). The deduced TyrDC protein sequence shares extensive similarity with two functionally related enzymes, tryptophan decarboxylase from periwinkle and dopa decarboxylase from Drosophila melanogaster. Expression of TyrDC cDNA in Escherichia coli yielded catalytically active protein with high substrate specificity for tyrosine. All four identified parsley TyrDC genes have been cloned and encode at least three TyrDC isozymes. Treatment of cultured parsley cells with fungal elicitor caused very rapid and transient increases in TyrDC mRNA and enzyme activity levels."
https://openalex.org/W1501455003,"A approximately 110-kDa glycoprotein purified from canalicular vesicles by bile acid affinity chromatography has been identified as the canalicular bile acid transport protein. Internal amino acid sequence and chemical and immunochemical characteristics of this protein were found to be identical to a rat liver canalicular ecto-ATPase. In order to definitively determine whether these were two activities of a single polypeptide, we examined the possibility that transfection of cDNA for the ecto-ATPase would confer bile acid transport characteristics, as well as ecto-ATPase activity, on heterologous cells. The results show that transfection of the ecto-ATPase cDNA conferred on COS cells de novo synthesis of a approximately 110-kDa polypeptide, as immunoprecipitated by antibody to the purified canalicular bile acid transport protein and conferred on COS cells the capacity to pump out [3H]taurocholate with efflux characteristics comparable with those previously determined in canalicular membrane vesicles (Km = 100 microM; Vmax = 200 pmol/mg of protein/20 s). A truncated ecto-ATPase cDNA, missing the cytoplasmic tail, was targeted correctly to the cell surface but did not confer bile acid transport activity on COS cells. The results of this study also show that the canalicular ecto-ATPase/bile acid transport protein is phosphorylated on its cytoplasmic tail and that its phosphorylation is stimulated by activation of protein kinase C and inhibited by inhibitors of protein kinase C activation. Moreover, inhibition of protein kinase C activation by staurosporine completely abrogates bile acid transport but does not affect ATPase activity. This study, therefore, demonstrates that the rat liver canalicular ecto-ATPase is also a bile acid transport protein, that the capacity to pump out bile acid can be conferred on a heterologous cell by DNA-mediated gene transfer, and that phosphorylation within the cytoplasmic tail of the transporter is essential for bile acid efflux activity but not for ATPase activity."

https://openalex.org/W1583805120,"Choline deficiency, via deprivation of labile methyl groups, is associated with a greatly increased incidence of hepatocarcinoma in experimental animals. This dietary deficiency also causes fatty liver, because choline is needed for hepatic secretion of lipoproteins. We hypothesized that fatty liver might be associated with the accumulation of 1,2-sn-diradylglycerol and subsequent activation of protein kinase C. Several lines of evidence indicate that cancers might develop secondary to abnormalities in protein kinase C-mediated signal transduction. We observed that rats fed a choline-deficient diet for 1, 6, or 27 weeks had increased hepatic concentrations of 1,2-diradylglycerol. At 1 and 6 weeks, hepatic plasma membrane from choline-deficient rats had increased concentrations of 1,2-sn-diacylglycerol and 1-alkyl, 2-acylglycerol, with the latter accounting for 20-26% of membrane 1,2-sn-diradylglycerol (as compared with only 2-5% in controls). Protein kinase C activity was increased in hepatic plasma membrane at 1 week of choline deficiency. By Western blotting there was an increase in the amount of protein kinase C zeta and a decrease in the amount of protein kinase C delta in liver at 1 week. By 6 weeks of choline deficiency, hepatic plasma membrane and cytosolic protein kinase C (PKC) activities were increased significantly, with increased amounts of hepatic plasma membrane protein kinase C alpha, and delta detected by Western blotting. Glycogen synthase activity in liver was diminished after 1 week of choline deficiency; this enzyme is inhibited by PKC-mediated phosphorylation. We suggest that choline deficiency perturbed PKC-mediated transmembrane signaling within liver and that this contributed to the development of hepatic cancer in these animals."
https://openalex.org/W1593947201,"The molecular basis for transactivation of the human vimentin gene by the Tax protein from the human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-1) is analyzed in this report. We first demonstrate that the factor NF-kappa B binds to the vimentin promoter. Using gel retardation assays, we found the putative NF-kappa B protein. Specific antibodies and competition experiments between the NF-kappa B-binding site in the interleukin-2R alpha and HIV-1 promoters and the vimentin promoter show that the three sites have identical affinity for the factor. We further show that the mechanisms of activation of NF-kappa B by the Tax protein involve a cellular inducer. Nuclear extract from lymphoid cells expressing Tax can induce in vitro a NF-kappa B binding activity in nonlymphoid cytosolic extract. This inducer, if preexisting in an inactivate state in T-cells which are not expressing Tax, cannot be switched to an active state by addition of partially purified Tax protein. While found in the nucleus of Tax-expressing cells in our experiments, this inducer might be cytoplasmic as well. In a first attempt to identify and characterize the inducer, we present the results of fractionation assays of nuclear extract."
https://openalex.org/W1552784036,"We have developed a cell-free system that reconstitutes the last step in transcytosis, i.e. the fusion of transcytotic transport vesicles with the apical plasma membrane (PM). Subcellular fractions containing transcytotic vesicles (the donor) or apical PM (the acceptor) were prepared from rat liver by sucrose density centrifugation. Fusion between the donor and acceptor fractions was measured by the conversion of the 120,000 transmembrane form of the polymeric IgA receptor (pIgA-R), an endogenous protein of transcytotic vesicles, to a processed fragment by a protease endogenous to the apical PM. Fusion occurred only at 37 degrees C and was critically dependent on the presence of ATP and cytosol. Fusion was inhibited by treating the in vitro fusion reaction with N-ethylmaleimide or by adding antibodies against N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF). We have previously identified a specific transcytotic vesicle-associated protein (TAP) and here show that TAP exists in both cytosolic and membrane-associated pools. Because of its exclusive interaction with transcytotic vesicles, we tested the involvement of TAP in distinct fusion processes. Removal of TAP inhibited fusion in an in vitro transcytotic fusion reaction but had no inhibitory effect in an in vitro endosome-endosome fusion system or in an in vitro intra-Golgi transport reaction. We propose that TAP represents part of the molecular machinery specifically involved in targeting and/or fusion of transcytotic vesicles with the apical PM."

https://openalex.org/W1541236768,"Tissue factor serves as the cellular receptor for circulating blood coagulation factor VII and is the principal physiological initiator of blood coagulation. Tissue factor is not normally expressed in cells that contact blood, such as endothelial cells and monocytes, but can be induced in these cells by tumor necrosis factor or tumor-promoting phorbol esters. Following induction, the human tissue factor mRNA is degraded with a half-life of approximately 0.75-1.5 h. The cellular mechanisms responsible for this rapid mRNA turnover were investigated with chimeric tissue factor.beta-globin constructs expressed in stably transfected mouse NIH/3T3 cells. These constructs were expressed with the transiently inducible c-fos promoter which eliminated the need to use transcriptional inhibitors to determine mRNA half-lives. Sequences capable of conferring rapid turnover to the normally stable beta-globin transcript were localized to the last 600 nucleotides of the tissue factor mRNA. The 3' end of this fragment is similar to previously described AU-rich mRNA destabilizing elements. Activity of the tissue factor element was dependent on its specific sequence and not simply a high AU nucleotide content. The degradation of unstable chimeric tissue factor.beta-globin mRNAs was prevented by inhibition of transcription with actinomycin D. Chimeric tissue factor.beta-globin mRNAs were superinduced by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, and this superinduction may be due in part to stabilization of the mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1558311664,"The VP55 subunit of the vaccinia virus-encoded poly(A) polymerase can add a maximum of 35 adenylates to the 3'-end of an RNA primer in a rapid and highly processive manner, whereas the VP55-VP39 heterodimer catalyzes the formation of poly(A) tails several hundred nucleotides in length. Here, we describe the overexpression of the VP39 subunit, its purification to near homogeneity, and its ability to associate physically with VP55 and to stimulate polyadenylation. Although VP39 possessed no independent poly(A) polymerase activity, RNA primers with oligo(A) tails greater than 30 adenylates in length could be extended nearly 40-fold more rapidly in the presence of VP39. VP39 enhanced the polyadenylation rate by converting the slow, nonprocessive polyadenylation occurring after the rapid burst in the presence of monomeric VP55, to a rapid, semiprocessive reaction. The effect of VP39 was dramatic when poly(A) primers were used as, 60 mM NaCl, VP39 enhanced the polyadenylation rate 500-fold, and at 90 mM NaCl VP39 was absolutely required. Nevertheless, the VP39-containing polymerase remained selective for polyadenylation of an mRNA 3'-end in the presence of excess poly(A). These data suggest that the role of VP39 in polyadenylation is to increase the affinity of the polymerase for the growing poly(A) tail."
https://openalex.org/W1498131153,"Four structural domains are characteristic of the members of the thyroid/steroid receptor superfamily. Of these, the A/B and D domains are the least conserved. We have investigated the role of two clusters of positively charged amino acids within the D domain of the thyroid hormone receptor alpha 1 (TR alpha 1). The sequences Lys134-Arg-Lys and Arg188-Arg-Lys, individually or together, were substituted to the neutral residues TIT in three mutants named alpha 1-1, alpha 1-2, and alpha 1-3, respectively. Subcellular localization of transiently transfected wild-type and mutated TRs was monitored by immunostaining, using a TR alpha 1-specific antibody. The wild-type and the alpha 1-2 TRs were detected exclusively in the nucleus, in the presence or absence of thyroid hormone. In contrast, the alpha 1-1 and alpha 1-3 mutants accumulated in both cytoplasm and nucleus, underscoring the importance of the Lys134-Arg-Lys residues for correct nuclear targeting. More importantly, although the mutants had unimpaired DNA- and hormone-binding activities, all three had lost positive and negative transcriptional regulatory functions. Thus, transactivation and repression functions can be entirely dissociated from the other properties of the receptor. In addition, substitution of either one of the positively charged amino acid clusters was sufficient to convert the native TR alpha 1 into a dominant, thyroid hormone-dependent receptor antagonist. These observations, which underline the functional relevance of the D domain for TR alpha 1 function, may also have implications for the autosomal dominant syndrome of generalized resistance to thyroid hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1502793952,"Elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of the complex of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its receptor is essential for understanding the molecular mechanisms of the EGF-receptor interaction and EGF-induced receptor-receptor interaction. NMR is useful to investigate interactions in solution between macromolecules at atomic resolution, but has a limitation in molecular masses of target proteins: less than 300 residues. We have prepared a fragment with apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa in SDS gels from the soluble extracellular domain of the EGF receptor (sEGFR, 619 residues) by sequential limited proteolysis with proteinase K and bromelain. This fragment is a monomeric structural domain consisting of 202 amino acid residues (Cys302-Arg503) and 18-kDa sugar chains, and binds EGF and transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF alpha). This 40-kDa domain has a dissociation constant of about 1 microM for human TGF alpha, which is similar to that of the parental sEGFR. sEGFR oligomerizes in response to EGF and TGF alpha, while the 40-kDa domain does not, suggesting that the sequences other than this domain is required for receptor oligomerization. The 40-kDa ligand-binding domain described in this report is suitable for analysis by various physico-chemical approaches such as NMR."
https://openalex.org/W2041883271,"The E. coli trpR gene encodes the 108 amino acid long trp repressor. We have previously shown that a +1 frameshifting event occurs during the expression of trpR. Here we show that the transition from the 0 to the +1 frame of trpR occurs by the bypassing of a 55 nt long segment of the trpR+1-lacZ mRNA. This bypassing event is not pretranslational, and it probably takes place during translation. Two adjacent elements are required: a specific sequence of trpR, which must be preceded by a nonspecific 5' end longer than 10 translatable codons. Unique to trpR-lacZ bypassing is that the 55 nt long region must be translated in frame 0 to enable bypassing into the +1 frame. Translational bypassing as a newly discovered mechanism of gene expression is discussed, and the possible existence of translational introns is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1891713131,"We have studied the reconstitution of chromatin-like structures in vitro, using purified RNA polymerase I transcription complexes and histone octamers. The plasmid construct used in these studies is a pUC8 derivative in which we have inserted an RNA polymerase I core promoter region of Acanthamoeba castellanii upstream of four repeats of the 5 S rDNA nucleosome positioning sequence (208 base pairs) from Lytechinus variegatus. When histone octamers were reconstituted onto the naked DNA template, the expected nucleosome positioning previously observed using tandem repeats of the same 208-base pair fragment was not obtained (as assayed by restriction enzyme digestion mapping of the inserted region of the plasmid). We show that the location of the RNA polymerase I core promoter region with regard to the tandemly repeated 208-base pair positioning sequence is a major determinant in the positioning of the histone octamers. Reconstituting first with the stalled transcription complex excluded octamers from the promoter region and recovered the expected nucleosome positioning downstream on the four repeats of the 5 S positioning sequence. The observed competition between histone octamers and the transcription complex for the promoter region suggests a great similarity with what has been reported from in vitro studies of RNA polymerase II and III transcription systems. We may be looking at a mechanism of regulation of transcription for the RNA polymerase I."
https://openalex.org/W1487290611,"Abstract The segment Asp1064-Lys1073 in the beta subunit of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase is evolutionarily conserved and is located near the 5' face of the nucleotide binding pocket as was shown by affinity labeling with priming substrates (Grachev, M. A., Lukhtamov, E. A., Mustaev, A. A., Zaychikov, E. F., Abdukayumov, M. N., Rabinov, I. V., Richter, V. I., Skoblov, Y. S., and Chistyakov, P. G. (1989) Eur. J. Biochem. 180, 577-585). We engineered single Xaa-->Ala or Ala-->Ser substitutions of eight evolutionarily conserved amino acids in this segment as well as a multiple alanine (KRNK) substitution of four of these residues. The KRNK mutation as well as four of the single substitutions were dominant lethal, two of the single mutations were recessive lethal, and two were viable. RNA polymerase bearing the dominant mutations was prepared for biochemical study by in vitro reconstitution from subunits. All of the mutant enzymes formed stable, specific promoter complexes, capable of initiating RNA synthesis. However, the KRNK polymerase was totally blocked in initiation-to-elongation transition, whereas the four point mutants displayed allele-specific changes in promoter clearance rate. Each of the four mutations changed, in a specific way, both the pattern of short oligomers generated in abortive initiation and the pattern of RNA polymerase pausing during elongation. Thus, the mutations appear to distort but not destroy the active center and to alter, in allele-specific manner, the coupling between the catalytic reaction and RNA polymerase propagation along the template."
https://openalex.org/W1566118750,"The predominant component of amyloid plaques of Alzheimer's disease is the amyloid beta protein (A beta), a 39-42-amino-acid peptide derived by proteolysis of a family of precursors known as amyloid precursor proteins (APP). In mammalian brain and in cultured mammalian cells, the release of APP amino-terminal fragments into the extracellular medium occurs by a proteolytic cleavage within the A beta domain, thereby precluding amyloidogenesis. Infection of Sf9 insect cells with baculovirus vectors containing APP cDNAs results in high levels of APP expression. The concomitant release of amino-terminal fragments of APP and the production of carboxyl-terminal, cell-associated cleavage products are observed. Here we demonstrate by direct protein microsequencing that the proteolytic processing of APP in the Sf9 cells generates a prominent carboxyl-terminal species that is identical to that produced in human cells, suggesting that the major pathway for proteolytic processing of APP is conserved among metazoans."
https://openalex.org/W1487086951,"We have recently reported the purification of the native sodium- and chloride-coupled glycine transporter from pig brain stem (Lopez-Corcuera, B. Vazquez, J., and Aragon, C. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 24809-24814). This preparation is essentially homogeneous and contains a unique 100-kDa polypeptide based on electrophoretic migration under denaturing conditions. In this paper we report the hydrodynamic characterization of the native transporter, solubilized in two different detergents, as well as the immunological identification of the protein. On the basis of results obtained from size-exclusion chromatography, we calculated the Stokes radii of transporter 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid (CHAPS) and transporter-cholate complexes to be 5.5 and 6.0 nm, respectively. In addition, from H2O/D2O sucrose density gradient sedimentation analysis, we calculated the molecular weight of protein-detergent complexes to be 115,000 and 160,000 in CHAPS and cholate, respectively, and the molecular weight of the protein moiety as 86,000. Finally, polyclonal antibodies raised against the 100-kDa polypeptide were found to immunoprecipitate specifically glycine transport activity. Taken together, the results reported herein corroborate the identity of the 100-kDa band as the sodium- and chloride-coupled glycine transporter and also suggest that in its native state the transporter is a monomeric protein."
https://openalex.org/W1509889508,"Trypanosoma brucei cDNA libraries constructed in the vector pCDM8 were screened selectively for insect (procyclic) stage surface antigen cDNAs by transient expression in mammalian COS-7 fibroblasts and panning with a rabbit polyclonal antiserum. This strategy yielded two surface antigen cDNAs termed PSSA-1 and PSSA-2. The PSSA-1 cDNA encoded an isotype of procyclin, the major phosphatidylinositol-linked stage-specific glycoprotein antigen of the tsetse fly infective forms of T. brucei. The PSSA-2 cDNA encoded a new and previously unidentified stage-specific surface antigen with the features of a typical transmembrane glycoprotein but with an unusual cytoplasmic tail composed of a proline-rich tandem repeat. Fluorescent antibody staining of PSSA-1 transfected COS cells with a panel of procyclin-specific monoclonal antibodies confirmed that the protein was located on the outer surface of the plasma membrane. Furthermore, the antigen on COS cells was insensitive to treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C suggesting that the inositol of the glycosylinositol phospholipid-lipid anchor contained the same fatty acyl modification reported recently for the procyclin molecule in cultured procyclic trypanosomes. In contrast the PSSA-2 antigen on COS cells was stained very weakly by whole parasite antisera. Northern blot hybridization revealed that the PSSA-2 antigen was encoded by a single 1.7-kilobase transcript which was present in parasites from the insect procyclic stage of the life cycle but not from the animal bloodstream stage. Southern blot hybridization analysis of DNA from procyclic stage trypanosomes indicated that the gene for PSSA-2 may be present in more than one copy in procyclic trypanosomes."

https://openalex.org/W1551979974,"Affinity cross-linking of membrane bound 125I-interleukin-6 (IL-6) on several cell lines revealed a three-band pattern of IL-6-containing cross-linked complexes with molecular masses of 100, 120, and 150 kDa. To identify the membrane components that were associated with IL-6 in the three complexes, we employed the Denny-Jaffe reagent, a heterobifunctional, cleavable cross-linker that allows the transfer of 125I from the ligand to its receptor. Samples cross-linked with Denny-Jaffe reagent were analyzed by two-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in which the cross-linker was cleaved prior to the second dimension. This analysis revealed that IL-6 directly associates with a 130-kDa membrane protein thus allowing the formation of the 150-kDa complex. In addition, both the 100- and 120-kDa cross-linked complexes were shown to include an 80-kDa membrane glycoprotein associated with one and two IL-6 molecules, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2111235968,"We expressed soluble forms of the human T-cell coreceptor CD8 alpha extracellular region, CD8 alpha 161, and the amino-terminal immunoglobulin-like domain, CD8 alpha 114, in Chinese hamster ovary cells and Escherichia coli, respectively. Both molecules were readily purified to homogeneity in milligram amounts and were recognized by a large panel of monoclonal antibodies. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis indicated that approximately 70% of CD8 alpha 161 was secreted as a disulfide-linked dimer, but CD8 alpha 114 was not disulfide-linked. To investigate the structural features of CD8 alpha 161 and CD8 alpha 114 under native conditions, we performed gel filtration and sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis. In spite of being partially or totally noncovalently bound, both recombinant molecules were stably associated homodimers, as no monomers could be detected at a fairly low protein concentration (approximately 1 microM). This suggests that the CD8 alpha amino-terminal domain alone strongly contributes to chain association. Determination of the Stokes radius (Rs) and sedimentation coefficient (s20,w) gave results consistent with CD8 alpha 114 having a globular shape and CD8 alpha 161 being an asymmetric molecule. Taking into account the contribution of hydration to the frictional coefficient, we obtained for CD8 alpha 161 an axial ratio of approximately 5, when modeled as a prolate ellipsoid. These results indicate that the elongated structure of CD8 alpha 161 is essentially contributed by the hinge region and help to explain how the CD8 alpha is able to bridge the distance between the T-cell surface and its binding site in the alpha 3 domain of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules on the target cell."
https://openalex.org/W1548014671,"The multicatalytic proteinase complex (proteasome) contains at least four distinct active sites catalyzing the degradation of selected chromogenic substrates (trypsin-like, chymotrypsin-like, and peptidylglutamyl peptide hydrolyzing activities) and proteins such as beta-casein. Oxidized insulin B chain was recently proposed as a model substrate for protein degradation by the multicatalytic proteinase complex (Dick, L. R., Moomaw, C. R., DeMartino, G. N., and Slaughter, C. A. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 2725-2734). We studied the dialysis-induced activation of the hydrolysis of oxidized insulin B chain by this enzyme. Removal of EDTA from purified preparations of bovine pituitary multicatalytic proteinase complex by dialysis against Tris-HCl buffers led to marked changes in the catalytic properties and structure of the enzyme. Dialysis produced a time-dependent activation of oxidized insulin B chain hydrolysis with predominant cleavage at the Glu13-Ala14 bond. A new chromogenic assay was developed for measurement of this activity. Activation was accompanied by a virtually total inactivation of the chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and peptidylglutamyl peptide hydrolyzing activities. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed a loss of the 24-kDa subunit and the appearance of a new band at 21 kDa. Amino-terminal amino acid analysis established that the 21-kDa band was autolytically derived from the 24-kDa subunit. Evidence for partial dissociation and/or aggregation indicated that autolysis destabilizes the complex. By altering the profile of catalytic activities of the multicatalytic proteinase complex, autolysis may serve as a mechanism for regulation of this macromolecule."
