https://openalex.org/W2066048575,"Neuregulins (i.e. neuregulin-1 (NRG1), also called neu differentiation factor, heregulin, glial growth factor, and acetylcholine receptor-inducing activity) are known to induce growth and differentiation of epithelial, glial, neuronal, and skeletal muscle cells. Unexpectedly, mice with loss of function mutations of NRG1 or of either of two of their cognate receptors, ErbB2 and ErbB4, die during midembryogenesis due to the aborted development of myocardial trabeculae in ventricular muscle. To examine the role of NRG and their receptors in developing and postnatal myocardium, we studied the ability of a soluble NRG1 (recombinant human glial growth factor 2) to promote proliferation, survival, and growth of isolated neonatal and adult rat cardiac myocytes. Both ErbB2 and ErbB4 receptors were found to be expressed by neonatal and adult ventricular myocytes and activated by rhGGF2. rhGGF2 (30 ng/ml) provoked an approximate 2-fold increase in embryonic cardiac myocyte proliferation. rhGGF2 also promoted survival and inhibited apoptosis of subconfluent, serum-deprived myocyte primary cultures and also induced hypertrophic growth in both neonatal and adult ventricular myocytes, which was accompanied by enhanced expression of prepro-atrial natriuretic factor and skeletal α-actin. Moreover, NRG1 mRNA could be detected in coronary microvascular endothelial cell primary cultures prepared from adult rat ventricular muscle. NRG1 expression in these cells was increased by endothelin-1, another locally acting cardiotropic peptide within the heart. The persistent expression of both a neuregulin and its cognate receptors in the postnatal and adult heart suggests a continuing role for neuregulins in the myocardial adaption to physiologic stress or injury.

The persistent expression of both a neuregulin and its cognate receptors in the postnatal and adult heart suggests a continuing role for neuregulins in the myocardial adaption to physiologic stress or injury. An increasing number of locally acting biologic mediators have now been implicated in regulating myocardial development as well as the subsequent adaptive growth response of postnatal cardiac muscle to physiologic stress. Aside from acetylcholine and the biogenic amines, most of these mediators are locally acting peptide growth factors that are synthesized by cardiac muscle cells themselves or by other parenchymal cells within the heart, such as endothelial cells of the microvasculature and endocardium (1Simpson P.

Endothelins and angiotensins, for example, both of which have been shown to induce a hypertrophic growth in cardiac myocytes, are synthesized and released by endothelial cells of the coronary microvasculature (7Nishida M.

Another growth factor signaling system that has recently been implicated in cardiac development is the “neuregulins,” a family of locally acting peptide autocoids known to be important in the development of the central and peripheral nervous system.

These reports indicated that neuregulins, released from the endocardial endothelium, are essential for the growth and phenotypic adaptation of subjacent cardiac myocytes during development. Neuregulins include the growth-regulatory proteins: glial growth factor (GGF), Neu differentiation factor, heregulin, and acetylcholine receptor-inducing activity. All of these proteins are encoded by a single gene but exist in at least 15 isoforms, including both integral membrane and soluble signaling proteins (16Carraway K.L. Burden S.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Recently, two additional genes coding for neuregulin-like signaling proteins have been identified that have been termed “neuregulin-2” (NRG2), and “neuregulin-3” (NRG3) (17Chang H. Riese D.J., II Gilbert W. Stern D.F. McMahan U.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 18Carraway III, K.L. Weber J.L. Unger M.J. Ledesma J. Yu N. Gassmann M. Lai C.

U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9562-9567Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Products of the originally identified neuregulin family, now termed neuregulin-1 (NRG1), share about 40 and 20% amino acid sequence identity with NRG2 and NRG3, respectively. Unlike NRG1-derived mRNAs, which within the developing heart are limited largely to the endocardial endothelium of ventricular muscle, NRG2 mRNAs are found primarily in the endothelium of developing atrial muscle, while no NRG3 mRNA has been detected by in situ hybridization in the heart at midembryogenesis (18Carraway III, K.L. Weber J.L. Unger M.J. Ledesma J. Yu N. Gassmann M. Lai C. Nature. 1997; 387: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 19Zhang D. Sliwkowski M.X. Mark M. Frantz G. Akita R. Sun Y. Hillan K. Crowley C. Brush J. Godowski P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9562-9567Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Neuregulins, which are produced by either neuronal or mesenchymal cells, mediate their effects by binding to and signaling via the ErbB family of receptors, including ErbB1/epidermal growth factor receptor, Neu/ErbB2/HER2, ErbB3/HER3, and ErbB4/HER4 (16Carraway K.L. Burden S.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 20Burden S. Yarden Y. Neuron. 1997; 18: 847-855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). All neuregulins (i.e. NRG1, NRG2, and NRG3) identified to date bind to either ErbB3 or ErbB4, subsequently recruiting another ErbB receptor (including ErbB1 or ErbB2) as co-receptors to initiate signaling. While all possible hetero- and homodimers of the ErbB receptor family can be formed, there is no known high affinity ligand for ErbB2, and ErbB3 homodimers have diminished intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, suggesting that there is a limited and hierarchical structure to neuregulin/ErbB signaling in target cells (20Burden S. Yarden Y. Neuron. 1997; 18: 847-855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). In the case of myocardial development, for example, animals lacking functional ErbB2 (ErbB2−/−) exhibited a cardiac phenotype similar to that of animals with a targeted disruption of the NRG1 gene, indicating that ErbB4 homodimers could not substitute for ErbB2 in fetal ventricular myocytes at this point in development (13Lee K.F. Simon H. Chen H. Bates B. Hung M.-C. Hauser C. Nature. 1995; 378: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). Peptide ligands other than products of the known neuregulin genes may also initiate ErbB signaling. Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor, which we have demonstrated can act as an autocrine growth stimulus in both neonatal and adult ventricular myocytes (21Perrella M.A. Mäki T. Prasad S. Pimental D. Singh K. Takahashi N. Yoshizumi M. Alali A. Higashiyama S. Kelly R.A. Lee M.-E. Smith T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27045-27050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has been shown also to act as a ligand for both the ErbB1 and ErbB4 receptors (22Elenius K. Paul S.G.A. Sun J. Klagsbrun M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1268-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Indeed, as noted by Burden and Yarden (20Burden S. Yarden Y. Neuron. 1997; 18: 847-855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), this abundance of potential ligands suggests that the spatial and temporal restriction of soluble and membrane-bound neuregulins and other ErbB-receptor ligands provides the necessary specificity for ErbB-dependent signaling. Neuregulins have been shown to regulate the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes (23Carroll P.D. Musacchio J.M. Hardy R. Reynolds R.

However, direct evidence for effects of neuregulins on cardiac myocytes has not been reported. Here, we examine the ErbB receptor expression in neonatal and adult rat ventricular myocytes. We demonstrate that a soluble recombinant form of a human NRG1, glial growth factor 2 (rhGGF2), promotes embryonic cardiac myocyte proliferation and the growth and survival of both neonatal and adult ventricular myocytes in vitro. We also examine the expression of NRG1 in primary cultures of coronary microvascular endothelial cells These data support the concept that the neuregulin-ErbB signaling system plays an important role in the onset of myocardial trabeculation and cardiac morphogenesis by promoting the proliferation, survival, and maturation of cardiomyocytes and suggest that this system may remain an important pathway for phenotypic adaptation in both neonatal and adult myocardium. Embryonic and neonatal rat ventricular myocyte (NRVM) primary cultures were prepared as described previously (31Springhorn J.P. Ellingsen O. Berger H.-J. Kelly R.A. Smith T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14360-14365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To selectively enrich for myocytes, dissociated cells were centrifuged twice at 500 rpm for 5 min, preplated twice for 75 min, and finally plated at low density (0.7–1 × 104 cells/cm2) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Life Technologies Inc.) supplemented with 7% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma). Cytosine arabinoside (10 μm; Sigma) was added during the first 24–48 h to prevent proliferation of non-myocytes, with the exception of cultures used for thymidine uptake measurements. Unless otherwise stated, all experiments were performed 36–48 h after changing to a serum-free medium, DMEM plus ITS (Sigma). Using this method, we routinely obtained primary cultures with >95% myocytes, as assessed by microscopic observation of spontaneous contraction and by immunofluorescence staining with a monoclonal anticardiac myosin heavy chain antibody (anti-MHC; Biogenesis, Sandown, NH). Primary cultures of cellular fractions isolated from neonatal hearts enriched in non-myocyte cells were prepared by passaging twice cells that adhered to the tissue culture dish during the preplating procedure. These non-myocyte cultures, which contained few anti-MHC positive cells, were allowed to grow to subconfluence in DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS before switching to DMEM plus ITS for a subsequent 36–48 h. Isolation and preparation of adult rat ventricular myocyte (ARVM) primary cultures was carried out using techniques previously described (32Berger H.-J. Prasad S.K. Davidoff A.J. Pimental D. Ellingsen R̆. Marsh J.D. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: H341-H349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rod-shaped cardiac myocytes were plated in culture medium on laminin- (10 μg/ml; Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA) precoated dishes for 60 min, followed by one change of medium to remove loosely attached cells. The contamination of ARVM primary cultures by non-myocytes was determined by counting with a hemocytometer and was typically less than 5%. All ARVM primary cultures were maintained in a defined medium termed “ACCITT” (32Berger H.-J. Prasad S.K. Davidoff A.J. Pimental D. Ellingsen R̆. Marsh J.D. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: H341-H349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) composed of DMEM, supplemented with 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mml-carnitine, 5 mm creatine, 5 mmtaurine, 0.1 μm insulin, and 10 nmtriiodothyronine with 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. In experimental protocols designed to examine myocyte survival and/or apoptosis, insulin was omitted from the defined medium, which is therefore termed “ACCTT.” Coronary microvascular endothelial cells (CMEC) from adult rat hearts were isolated as described by Nishida et al. (33Nishida M. Careley W.W. Gerritsen M.E. Ellingsen R̆. Kelly R.A. Smith T.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: H639-H652PubMed Google Scholar). The isolated cells were plated at a density of 2500 cells/cm2. After 1 h of plating, the cells were washed twice with DMEM to remove loosely adherent cells and then maintained in DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS. These primary isolates have been documented to contain >90% endothelian cells, with a phenotype at low passage number consistent with their microvascular origin, as described previously (33Nishida M. Careley W.W. Gerritsen M.E. Ellingsen R̆. Kelly R.A. Smith T.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: H639-H652PubMed Google Scholar). cDNA sequences encoding portions of the C termini of ErbB receptors were amplified by using the following synthetic oligonucleotide primers: ErbB2A (5′-TGTGCTAGTCAAGAGTCCCAACCAC-3′; sense) and ErbB2B (5′-CCTTCTCTCGGTACTAAGTATTCAG-3′; antisense) for amplification of ErbB2 codon positions 857–1207 (34Bargmann E.I. Hung M.C. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1986; 319: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar); ErbB3A (5′-GCTTAAAGTGCTTGGCTCGGGTGTC-3′; sense) and ErbB3B (5′-TCCTACACACTGACACTTTCTCTT-3′; antisense) for amplification of ErbB3 codon positions 712–1085 (35Kraus M.H.

A. 1989; 86: 9193-9197Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar); ErbB4A (5′-AATTCACCCATCAGAGTGACGTTTGG-3′; sense) and ErbB4B (5′-TCCTGCAGGTAGTCTGGGTGCTG; antisense) for amplification of ErbB4 codon positions 896–1262 (36Plowman G.D. Culoscou J.-M. Whitney G.S. Green J.M. Carlton G.W. Foy L. Neubauer M.G. Shoyab M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1746-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). RNA samples (1 μg) from rat hearts or freshly isolated neonatal and adult rat ventricular myocytes were reverse transcribed to generate first-strand cDNA. The PCR reactions were performed for 30 cycles. Each cycle included 30 s at 94 °C, 75 s at 63 °C, and 120 s at 72 °C. The PCR products were directly cloned into the TA cloning vector (Invitrogen Co., San Diego, CA) and verified by automatic DNA sequencing. To analyze which receptor subtypes were tyrosine-phosphorylated, neonatal and adult ventricular myocyte cells were maintained in serum-free medium for 24–48 h and then treated with rhGGF2 at 20 ng/ml for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells were quickly rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in cold lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mmTris-Cl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium molybdate, 8.8 g/liter sodium pyrophosphate, 4 g/liter NaFl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μm leupeptin. Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min, and aliquots of 1500 μg (ErbB4 detection) or 3000 μg (ErbB2 detection) of supernatant were incubated with antibody specific to ErbB4 or phosphotyrosine, respectively, overnight at 4 °C and precipitated with protein G plus agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; Santa Cruz, CA). Immunoprecipitates were collected and released by boiling in SDS sample buffer. Samples were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad), and probed with a PY99 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody or with an antibody specific to ErbB2. All of these antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. As an index of DNA synthesis, [3H]thymidine incorporation was measured as described previously (37Berk B.C. Vekshtein V. Gordon H.M. Tsuda T. Hypertension. 1989; 13: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). After incubation for 48–72 h in serum-free medium (DMEM plus ITS), the cells were stimulated with different concentrations of rhGGF2 (Cambridge NeuroScience Co., Cambridge, MA) for 20 h. [3H]Thymidine (0.7 Ci/mmol; DuPont) was then added to the medium at a concentration of 5 (NRVM) or 15 μCi/ml (embryonic myocytes), and the cells were cultured for another 8 h. Cells were washed with PBS twice and 10% trichloroacetic acid (Sigma) once, and 10% trichloroacetic acid was added to precipitate protein at 4 °C for 45 min. Parallel cultures of myocytes not exposed to rhGGF2 were harvested under the same conditions as controls. The precipitate was washed twice with 95% ethanol, resuspended in 0.15 nNaOH, and saturated with 1 m HCl, and then aliquots were counted in a scintillation counter. The results are expressed as relative cpm/dish normalized to the mean cpm of control cells in each experiment. For antibody-blocking experiments, the same procedure was applied except that the cells were preincubated with an antibody (0.5 μg/ml) specific for each neuregulin receptor (c-Neu Ab-2, Oncogene Research Products; and ErbB3 or ErbB4, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), for 2 h before the addition of either rhGGF2 or recombinant human fibroblast growth factor-2. The rate of [3H]leucine uptake was used as an index of protein synthesis. For these experiments, 10 μm cytosine arabinoside was added to the culture medium. Cells were grown in serum-free medium for 36–48 h and then stimulated with different doses of rhGGF2. After 40 h, [3H]leucine (5 μCi/ml) was added for 8 h, and cells were washed with PBS and harvested with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting as above. For examination of changes in myocyte phenotype with rhGGF2, cells were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, rinsed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min, and then incubated with 1% FBS for another 15 min, followed by incubation with anti-MHC (1:300) and visualized with TRITC-conjugated (NRVM) or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated (ARVM) second antibody. NRVM were examined using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, while ARVM were examined using a MRC 600 confocal microscope (Bio-Rad) with a krypton/argon laser. Cell viability was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, Sigma) cell respiration assay, which is dependent on mitochondrial activity in living cells (38Mosman T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46884) Google Scholar). Primary cultures of NRVM after 2 days in serum-free medium were stimulated with different concentrations of rhGGF2 for either 4 or 6 days. ARVM were maintained in ACCTT medium or ACCTT medium plus different concentrations of rhGGF2 for 6 days. MTT was then incubated with the cells for 3 h at 37 °C. Living cells transform the tetrazolium ring into dark blue formazan crystals that can be quantified by reading the optical density at 570 nm after cell lysis with dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma). Apoptosis was detected in neonatal and adult myocytes using the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay. 3′-End labeling of DNA with fluorescein-conjugated dUTP was done using an in situ cell death detection kit (Boehringer Mannheim) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were counterstained with an anti-MHC antibody as described above, and the nuclei were also stained with Hoescht 33258 (10 μm, Sigma) for 5 min. More than 500 myocytes were counted in each coverslip, and the percentage of TUNEL-positive myocytes was calculated. Flow cytometric analysis of neonatal myocytes fixed in 70% ethanol/PBS and stained with propidium iodide was also performed to quantify the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis. This method is based upon the observation that cells undergoing apoptosis have a hypodiploid quantity of DNA and localize in a broad area below the G0/G1 peak on a DNA histogram. Briefly, cells were collected by trypsinization, pooled with nonattached cells, and fixed in 70% ethanol. After being rinsed once with PBS, cells were incubated with a propidium iodide (20 μg/ml, Sigma) solution containing RNase A (5 Kunitz units/ml) at room temperature for 30 min. Data were collected using a FACScan (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA). For each sample, 10,000 events were collected. Aggregated cells and extremely small cellular debris were gated out. Total cellular RNA was isolated by a modification of the acid guanidinium/thiocyanate phenol/chloroform extraction method (39Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) using the TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies). The following cDNA probes labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming were used: rat prepro-atrial natriuretic factor (prepro-ANF) (0.6 kilobase pair of coding region) (40Seidman C.E. Duby A.D.

Rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA probe (240 base pairs of the coding region) (43Tso J.Y. Sun X.-H. Kao T.-H. Reece K.S. Wu R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2485-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar) was used as control for loading and transfer efficiency. Signal intensity was determined by densitometry (Ultrascan XL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To examine the expression profile of the NRG receptors (i.e. ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4) in rat myocardium, RNA from rat heart tissues at midembryogenesis (embryonic day 14) or postnatal day 1 and from freshly isolated neonatal and adult ventricular myocytes were reverse transcribed and analyzed by RT-PCR. Primers that flank the variable C termini of ErbB receptors were used to amplify the products shown in Fig. 1 A. In freshly isolated neonatal and adult rat ventricular myocyte primary cultures, both ErbB2 and ErbB4 mRNA were readily detectable by RT-PCR, although ErbB4 expression levels were consistently higher than those of ErbB2. Expression of ErbB3 mRNA was not detected in either whole heart at postnatal day 1 or freshly isolated cardiomyocytes, but ErbB3 mRNA was detected in the developing rat heart at embryonic day 14. Furthermore, when using receptor-specific cDNA probes for ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4, only transcripts for ErbB4 were readily detectable in freshly isolated neonatal and adult rat ventricular myocytes but not in myocyte-depleted, non-myocyte-enriched primary cultures by Northern blot (data not shown). To determine whether ErbB2 and ErbB4 were tyrosine-phosphorylated following neuregulin treatment, rhGGF2 (20 ng/ml) was briefly (5 min) added to cultures of either neonatal or adult rat ventricular myocytes. Lysates were immunoprecipitated and probed with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (for detection of ErbB4) or an anti-ErbB2 antibody. As shown in Fig. 1, B and C, phosphorylated forms of ErbB2 and ErbB4 were detected in both neonatal and adult cardiomyocytes, but phosphorylated ErbB4 was more easily detected than phosphorylated ErbB2 and quite prominent in neonatal myocytes, which is consistent with the expression profile we observed above. To investigate the ability of GGF2 to stimulate the proliferative response of embryonic cardiac myocytes, myocytes maintained in serum-free medium for 3 days were subsequently treated with rhGGF2 for 30 h. As displayed in Fig. 2 A, GGF2 provoked an approximately 2-fold increase in the DNA synthesis of rat embryonic cardiac myocytes (day 17), as assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation. The maximal effective concentration was ∼30 ng/ml (i.e. 0.54 nm). Exposure to recombinant human fibroblast growth factor-2 (25 ng/ml) had a similar effect. Since embryonic cardiac myocytes still possess active proliferative capacity, we next counted the cell number after a treatment with GGF2 (40 ng/ml) for the indicated time periods (Fig. 2 B). The GGF-treated cells proliferated day by day, and the cell number peaked by day 4 and was increased by about 3-fold. Howeve"

Stimulation by Fas ligand results in apoptosis, whereas TNF induces multiple effects including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 kinase pathways is common to Fas and TNF signaling; however, their role in apoptosis is controversial.

Fas/CD95/APO-1 receptor oligomerization induced by FasL or by agonist antibodies results in apoptosis in a variety of cells, including T, B, and NK cells, macrophages, and fibroblasts (2Nagata S. Goldstein P. Science. 1995; 267: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3979) Google Scholar). TNF binds to two ubiquitously expressed receptors, TNF receptor I (TNFRI/p55) and TNF receptor II (TNFRII/p75), that do not share any homology within their cytoplasmic domains (3Darnay B.G. Aggarwal B.B. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Unlike FasL, TNF elicits a wide range of cellular effects, including apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation, inflammation, and chemotaxis (4Vassalli P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 411-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1809) Google Scholar). FasL and TNF activate apoptotic signaling pathways through a similar mechanism. Fas and TNF interact either directly or indirectly with the adapter protein FADD/MORT1, which recruits caspase 8 to the receptor complex (reviewed in Ref. 3Darnay B.G. Aggarwal B.B. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The resulting cascade of caspase activation causes cleavage of cytosolic, cytoskeletal, and nuclear proteins and leads to apoptosis (5Patel T. Gores G.J. Kaufmann S.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). TNFRI and TNFRII also associate with molecules that do not interact with Fas. TRAF2 binds directly to TNFRII and is indirectly associated with TNFRI via TRADD (3Darnay B.G. Aggarwal B.B. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). TRAF2 mediates rapid activation of NF-κB, JNK, and p38 kinases in response to TNF (6Liu Z.-G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M.

Similarly, p38 kinases are activated by MKK3 and MKK6/SAPKK3; MKK6 is the predominant activator of p38α (18Han J. Lee J.-D. Jiang Y. Li Z. Feng L. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol.

Downstream effectors of the stress pathways include the transcription factors c-Jun, ATF-2, and Elk-1, which are phosphorylated and activated in response to the JNK cascade, whereas ATF-2, Elk-1, Max, and the kinases MAPKAP-2/3 and MNK1/2 (21Fukanaga R.

Conversely, stable cell lines expressing dominant negative mutants of MKK4 (29Zanke B.W. Boudreau K. Rubie E. Winnett E. Tibbles L.A. Zon L. Kyriakis J. Liu F.-F. Woodgett J.R. Curr.

In contrast, other reports suggest that stress kinases do not promote apoptosis. For example, transient expression of catalytically inactivated MEKK1, MKK4, or c-Jun mutants does not impair Fas- or TNF-induced apoptosis (6Liu Z.-G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar, 31Lenczowski J.M. Dominguez L. Eder A.M. King L.B. Zacharchuk C.M. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31929-31936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Furthermore, thymocytes from mice deficient in MKK4 are more susceptible to Fas- and CD3-induced apoptosis than wild type thymocytes, suggesting that the JNK pathway may protect cells from apoptosis (32Nishina H. Fischer K.D. Radvanyl L. Shahinian A. Hakem R. Rubie E.A. Bernstein A. Mak T.W. Woodgett J.R. Penninger J.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). These widely varying conclusions highlight the importance of understanding differences in stress kinase signaling in response to various apoptotic stimuli. This report defines an important new role for JNK and p38 kinases during TNF-induced apoptosis. Our results indicate that JNK and p38 kinases are activated through distinct mechanisms during Fas- and TNF-induced apoptosis. While Fas receptor cross-linking induces apoptosis in the absence of actinomycin D (Act. D) and activates JNK in a caspase-dependent manner, TNF requires Act. D for apoptosis and activates JNK and p38 kinase with biphasic kinetics. The first phase is transient, precedes apoptosis, and is caspase-independent, whereas the second phase is coincident with apoptosis and is caspase-dependent. Inhibition of early TNF-induced JNK and p38 kinase by expression of dominant negative mutants of MKK4, MKK6, or the p38 inhibitor SB203580 increased TNF-induced apoptosis, whereas expression of wild type MKK4 and MKK6 enhanced cell survival in the presence of TNF. In contrast, the Mek inhibitor PD098059 had no effect on survival. In addition, neither JNK nor p38 kinase is required during Fas- or TNF-induced apoptosis; rather, late phase activation is a response to caspases. These results demonstrate that early activation of JNK and p38 kinase (but not Mek) mediates cell survival signals during exposure to TNF. KYM-1 cells were obtained from the ATCC (Rockville, MD) and were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Summit Biotechnologies, Ft. Collins, CO), 8 mml-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin (50 μg/ml each; Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA). NIH-3T3 cells (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (high glucose), 10% calf serum (Summit Biotechnologies) supplemented as above. L929-cyt16 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Summit Biotechnologies), 8 mml-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and Geneticin (400 μg/ml, Life Technologies, Inc.). L929 cells were starved in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (0.1% bovine serum albumin, penicillin/streptomycin, 10% Opti-MEM) and KYM-1 cells in AIM-V medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) 20–24 h prior to induction of apoptosis. Fas-induced apoptosis in L929-cyt16 cells was initiated by cross-linking the chimeric receptors using 500 ng/ml rat anti-murine CD4 (Caltag, South San Francisco, CA) for 30 min at 37 °C followed by 5 μg/ml goat anti-rat IgG+IgM (The Jackson Laboratory, West Grove, PA). TNF-induced apoptosis was initiated with 20 ng/ml TNF (murine, Boehringer Mannheim; human, Chiron) ± 0.5 μg/ml Act. D (Sigma). The caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (Kamiya, Seattle, WA) was preincubated with cells for 1 h prior to antibody cross-linking or TNF addition. Cell extracts were prepared after the appropriate incubation periods by rinsing cells in cold phosphate-buffered saline followed by lysis in Triton lysis buffer ((20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 137 mm NaCl, 15% glycerol, 1% Triton), Complete inhibitor mixture (Boehringer Mannheim), 1 μm pepstatin (Boehringer Mannheim), 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate). Extracts were then cleared at 14,000 rpm for 10 min and quick frozen. Protein concentration was determined by Coomassie Plus Assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Caspase 3 activity was measured in vitro by incubating 10 μg of cell extract with 20 μm Z-DEVD-AFC fluorescent substrate (Kamiya) in 100 μl of Triton lysis buffer supplemented with 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol (33Nicholson D.W.

Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3796) Google Scholar). Substrate cleavage was allowed to occur for 20 min at room temperature, and released fluorescence was measured in a 96-well plate fluorometer (excitation, 400 nm; emission, 505 nm). The assay was found to be linear at maximum caspase activation under these conditions. Flag tagged MKK4, JNK1, and GST-jun(1–79) cDNAs were a generous gift from R. Davis. Flag-tagged MKK4, MKK4KR, and ΔNTRAF2 were inserted into the CMV promoter-driven expression vector pCG (8Reinhard C. Shamoon B. Shyamala V. Williams L.T.

Haskill) was PCR amplified and inserted in-frame into the pCGF vector (pCG modified to include an N-terminal Flag tag). IκBα phosphorylation sites Ser-32 and Ser-36 were mutated to Ala (IκBαSR) (35Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar) using the Quickchange PCR mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Full-length MKK6 was cloned from an expressed sequence tag (GenBank™ accession no. R42128, Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO) by PCR amplification and inserted in-frame into pCGF. MKK6 mutants to replace Lys-82 with Met (MKK6KM) (18Han J. Lee J.-D. Jiang Y. Li Z. Feng L. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol.

JNK1 and p38α cDNAs were PCR amplified and inserted in-frame into pCGN (pCG modified to include an N-terminal HA tag). The nucleotide sequence of all PCR-generated inserts was verified by sequence analysis. Expression of each construct was verified in cell lysates by Western blotting using an anti-Flag antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.). NIH-3T3 cells were co-transfected with a green fluorescent protein expression construct pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and either pCDNA3 (vector) or the various test constructs described above, using LipofectAMINE transfection reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Following a 12-h expression period, murine TNF (0.5 ng/ml) was added to the culture medium for 10 h (Boehringer Mannheim). Transfected cells were viewed by fluorescent microscopy, and sensitivity to TNF was measured by counting the number of surviving transfected cells in 10 representative microscopic fields with and without TNF treatment. TNF-induced apoptosis is expressed as the decrease in cell viability in relation to an untreated control sample for each test plasmid. To assess JNK and p38 kinase activity, NIH cells were co-transfected with HA-JNK1 or HA-p38 and various test constructs as described above. Following a 16-h expression period, cells were starved in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 0.3% calf serum for 24 h and then treated with 20 ng/ml murine TNF for 15 min. Cells were rinsed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in Triton lysis buffer, and kinase activity was measured as described below. The activity of endogenous JNKs was assessed by solid phase pull-down kinase assays as described previously (36Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μg of cell extract was incubated in the presence of 8 μg of recombinant GST-c-Jun (1–79) as substrate and GSH-Sepharose beads (Sigma) for 3 h at 4 °C. GST-Sepharose beads were then washed in JNK reaction buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 25 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm sodium vanadate). The in vitro kinase reaction was carried out in 30 μl of JNK reaction buffer supplemented with 20 μm [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 20 min at 32 °C. Transfected JNK1 and p38α kinases were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies (Babco, Richmond, CA) and protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were rinsed twice in Triton lysis buffer and once in JNK reaction buffer. The in vitro kinase reaction was carried out as above but with 40 μm ATP using GST-jun as a substrate for JNK and Phas-I (Stratagene) as a substrate for p38α. Phosphorylated substrates were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose, and relative phosphorylation was quantitated using the Bio-Rad Molecular Imager system. The expression levels of JNK and p38α were verified by Western blotting using the anti-HA antibody (Babco). Approximately 5 × 104L929-cyt16 cells per well were plated into 96-well plates, allowed to grow for 36 h, and then pretreated for 30–60 min with Me2SO, Act. D (0.5 μg/ml), or various concentrations of the inhibitors PD098059 (New England Biolabs, Beverley, MA) or SB203580 (Calbiochem) in starvation medium prior to TNF addition. Cells were incubated in TNF at 0, 1, 10, or 100 ng/ml in triplicate for 6 h, after which, 10 μl of WST-1 reagent (Boehringer Mannheim) was added for an additional 2 h. The optical density of each sample (in triplicate) was determined at 450 nm using a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). L929-cyt16 cells were starved for 20–24 h in starvation medium and then pretreated with the inhibitors PD098059 and SB203580 for 30 min prior to addition of TNF (10 ng/ml; Boehringer Mannheim). After 5 h of TNF treatment, cells were rinsed once in phosphate-buffered saline, stained with the ApoAlert Annexin V apoptosis kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and then analyzed on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (Epics, Coulter, Miami, FL). The kinetics of Fas-induced JNK activity correlate with caspase activation and apoptosis. The relationship between Fas-induced apoptosis, caspases, and JNK activation was investigated in a murine fibroblast cell line stably expressing a chimeric receptor consisting of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of murine CD4 fused to the cytoplasmic domain of murine Fas (L929-cyt16) (37Chu K. Niu X.-H. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11894-11898Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Within 30 min after receptor cross-linking, using anti-CD4 and secondary cross-linking antibodies (Fig. 1 A), the cells began to exhibit membrane blebbing and nuclear condensation. Nearly 90% of the cells were apoptotic within 90 min in either the presence or absence of Act. D (Fig. 1 A). Therefore, Fas-induced apoptosis is neither enhanced nor inhibited by signaling pathways leading to new gene expression. The kinetics of JNK and caspase activation were measured in cell extracts from L929-cyt16 cells made over a similar time course. Initiation of the Fas pathway activated DEVD-specific caspases with kinetics that preceded the appearance of membrane blebs (compare Fig. 1 A and 1 B). The kinetics of endogenous JNK activation closely resembled those of caspase activation but were slightly delayed compared with them, beginning at approximately 30 min after antibody cross-linking. Similar results were also obtained using the agonist CH-11 anti-Fas antibody in Jurkat cells expressing endogenous Fas (data not shown). Therefore, caspase activity precedes JNK activation during Fas-induced apoptosis. To investigate whether JNK activation induced by Fas was caspase-dependent, L929-cyt16 cells were pretreated with various concentrations of the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, followed by chimeric receptor cross-linking. Fas-induced JNK activation and apoptosis were inhibited in a dose-dependent manner up to 100 μm Z-VAD-FMK (Fig. 1 C). Although caspase activity was inhibited at lower concentrations of Z-VAD-FMK, our assay measured only DEVD-directed caspases, which may be more susceptible than other caspases to Z-VAD-FMK inhibition. These results demonstrate that caspase activity, in addition to that which cleaves DEVD-containing peptides, is required for Fas-induced JNK activation. The kinetics of stress kinase activation and their dependence on transcription and caspase activation were also examined in response to TNF. L929-cyt16 cells were treated over a 6-h time course with TNF in the presence or absence of Act. D, and apoptotic cells were counted. In the absence of Act. D, 15% of cells died, whereas in the presence of Act. D, apoptosis increased to greater than 95% (Fig. 2). This is in contrast to Fas-induced apoptosis in the same cell line where Act. D had no effect (Fig. 1 A). These results suggest that immediate early transcriptionally mediated events protect cells from TNF-induced cytotoxicity and are consistent with similar effects in other fibroblast cell lines (38Nophar Y. Holtman H. Ber R. Wallach D. J. Immunol. 1988; 140(10): 3456-3460Google Scholar, 39Wallach D. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 2464-2469PubMed Google Scholar, 40Beyaert R. Fiers W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In either the presence or absence of Act. D, TNF induced a rapid and transient JNK activation. JNK activity rose greater than 25-fold within the first 10 min and then rapidly fell to baseline within 1 h (Fig. 2), consistent with that reported in other cell types (10Sluss H. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8376-8384Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 11Westwick J.K. Weitzel C. Minden A. Karin M. Brenner D.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 13094-13102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). This first phase of kinase activation occurred in the absence of any DEVD-directed caspase activity (Fig. 2). However, in the presence of Act. D, JNK activation occurred in two phases: in addition to the early phase, a second, more prolonged phase started at approximately 90 min and continued in parallel with the kinetics of caspase activation and apoptosis (Fig. 2 B). A similar profile was seen with p38 kinase activation in the same extracts (data not shown). Cells treated with Act. D only for 60 or 360 min displayed no enhancement of JNK, p38, or caspase activity (data not shown). Furthermore, in human KYM-1 cells, which are sensitive to TNF in the absence of biosynthetic inhibitors, two peaks of JNK activation were also observed (data not shown). These results demonstrate that early TNF-stimulated JNK and p38 kinase activity is independent of caspases, whereas late phase activity coincides directly with caspase activation. Furthermore, early stress kinase activation occurs in cells regardless of whether they ultimately undergo apoptosis, whereas late phase activity occurs only in cells during apoptosis. To confirm the relationship between JNK and caspase activation during TNF-induced apoptosis, extracts were prepared from KYM-1 cells treated with TNF in the presence or absence of Z-VAD-FMK. Z-VAD-FMK did not affect the early phase of TNF-induced JNK activity at 15 min (Fig. 3), but it did inhibit late phase JNK at 4 h by almost 50%. Similar results were observed in L929-cyt16 cells. Early JNK was not affected by caspase inhibition; however, late phase JNK could not be assessed because of the obvious cytotoxicity of ZVAD-FMK after 3 h of TNF treatment (data not shown). Taken together, our data demonstrate that early phase JNK activation is caspase-independent, whereas late phase JNK is partially caspase-dependent. The results described above suggest that TNF induces an early peak of stress kinase activation that does not promote apoptosis. To investigate whether the early phase of JNK and p38 kinase protects cells from apoptosis, we inhibited each pathway by transiently expressing dominant negative mutants of MKK6 (MKK6KM) or MKK4 (MKK4KR) (15Dérijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar, 18Han J. Lee J.-D. Jiang Y. Li Z. Feng L. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2886-2891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). NIH-3T3 cells were used because L929-cyt16 cells were difficult to transfect to high efficiency. The expression levels from each construct were equalized as indicated by Western blotting using an anti-Flag antibody (Fig. 4 B). Treatment of cells with TNF alone (0.5 ng/ml) for 10 h induced cytotoxicity in approximately 30% of cells transfected with vector (Fig. 4 A). However, in cells expressing MKK6KM or MKK4KR, TNF-induced apoptosis increased to 60%, suggesting that JNK and p38 pathways are required for survival in response to TNF. Consistent with this view, expression of either MKK6-wt or MKK4-wt reduced apoptosis to 15 and 25%, respectively, indicating that JNK and p38 pathways enhance cell survival during TNF exposure. A similar increase in TNF-induced apoptosis (30% over vector control) was also observed using a super-repressor IκBα containing phosphorylation site mutations (IκBαSR) that prevent inducible NF-κB DNA binding activity (35Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 A). These data are consistent with those reported by others (41VanAntwerp D.J. Martin S. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2449) Google Scholar, 42Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2512) Google Scholar). In vitro kinase assays indicate that overexpression of either MKK6-wt or MKK4-wt stimulates both JNK and p38 kinases; similarly, expression of MKK6KM or MKK4KR inhibits both JNK and p38 kinase (Fig. 4, C and D). Therefore, in transient expression analysis, we cannot distinguish between the role of JNK and p38 kinase. Although it appears that IκBα-SR expression inhibits JNK and p38 kinase activity, it visibly impairs expression of the HA-JNK and HA-p38 reporter constructs and therefore may indirectly affect kinase activity. Overexpression of an N-terminally truncated TRAF2 (ΔNTRAF2) inhibits NF-κB, JNK, and p38 signaling pathways in response to TNF (Fig. 4,C and D) (6Liu Z.-G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M.

However, its utility as an inhibitor of Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria in vivo or in situ in intact cells is limited because of its inhibitory effects on sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release channel and other cellular processes. We have synthesized a ruthenium derivative and found it to be an oxygen-bridged dinuclear ruthenium amine complex. It has the same chemical structure as Ru360 reported previously (Emerson, J., Clarke, M. J., Ying, W-L., and Sanadi, D. R. (1993) J. Am. Chem. Soc.115, 11799–11805). Ru360 has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of Ca2+-stimulated respiration of liver mitochondria in vitro. However, the specificity of Ru360 on Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria in vitro or in intact cells has not been determined. The present study reports in detail the potency, the effectiveness, and the mechanism of inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake by Ru360 and its specificity in vitro in isolated mitochondria and in situ in isolated cardiac myocytes. Ru360 was more potent (IC50 = 0.184 nm) than ruthenium red (IC50 = 6.85 nm) in inhibiting Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria. 103Ru360 was found to bind to isolated mitochondria with high affinity (K d = 0.34 nm, B max = 80 fmol/mg of mitochondrial protein). The IC50 of 103Ru360 for the inhibition of Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria was also 0.2 nm, indicating that saturation of a specific binding site is responsible for the inhibition of Ca2+ uptake. Ru360, as high as 10 μm, produced no effect on sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ uptake or release, sarcolemmal Na+/Ca2+ exchange, actomyosin ATPase activity, L-type Ca2+ channel current, cytosolic Ca2+ transients, or cell shortening. 103Ru360 was taken up by isolated myocytes in a time-dependent biphasic manner. Ru360 (10 μm) applied outside intact voltage-clamped ventricular myocytes prevented Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria in situ where the cells were progressively loaded with Ca2+ via sarcolemmal Na+/Ca2+ exchange by depolarization to +110 mV.

We conclude that Ru360 specifically blocks Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria and can be used in intact cells. Since the discovery of Ca2+ transport into energized mitochondria about 30 years ago, numerous studies have been conducted on its kinetics and regulation in mitochondria isolated from various tissues (for review, see Gunter and Pfeiffer (1Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C755-C786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). It is now generally accepted that mitochondria act as a sink during cytosolic Ca2+ overload in diseased or damaged cells. However, the physiological role of Ca2+ transport into mitochondria in intact cells remains unresolved. In recent years, evidence has been accumulating that Ca2+ transport into mitochondria occurs in stimulated cells. For instance, it has been shown that mitochondria accumulate Ca2+ from an intracellular microdomain of high Ca2+ upon stimulation of cloned HeLa cells that express the Ca2+-sensitive photoprotein aequorin in mitochondria (2Rizzuto R. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Science. 1993; 262: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria in situ has also been observed in stimulated pancreatic cells (3Glennon C.M. Bird G. St J. Takemura H. Thastrup O. Leslie B.A. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol.

These studies indicate that mitochondria accumulate Ca2+ when the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+] c) increases in stimulated cells. In cardiac muscle cells, mitochondria appear to accumulate only about 1% of the [Ca2+] c during relaxation of a single twitch (12Bassani J.W.M. Bassani R.A. Bers D.M. J. Physiol. 1992; 453: 591-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). This fraction is not enough to significantly affect [Ca2+] c and cell contractility. However, increase in mitochondrial matrix free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+] m) has been observed when myocytes were stimulated to increase [Ca2+] c (13Miyata H. Silverman H.S. Sollott S.J. Lakata E.G.

An increase in mitochondrial total Ca content with increased workload has also been observed in isolated cardiac myocytes by x-ray electron probe microanalysis (19Isenberg G. Han S. Schiefer A. Wendt-Gallitelli M-F. Cardiovasc. Res. 1993; 27: 1800-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Increase in [Ca2+] m in vivo in isolated heart preparations with increased workload has also been observed (20Schreur J.H.M. Figueredo V.M. Miyamae M. Shames D.M. Baker A.J. Camacho S.A. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2571-2580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The significance of Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria and increase in [Ca2+] m in cardiac and other cell types, however, has not been elucidated. It has been suggested that the increase in [Ca2+] m may stimulate Ca2+-sensitive matrix dehydrogenases, and thus augment the rate of ATP synthesis to meet the heightened energy demand (21Denton R.M. McCormack J.G. FEBS Lett. 1980; 119: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 22Hansford R.G. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1985; 102: 1-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23McCormack J.G.

Verification of this hypothesis requires demonstration of Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria and the consequent increase in matrix NAD(P)H and ATP synthesis in stimulated cardiac myocytes. The conclusions of the studies referred to above are based on presumed localization of Ca2+-sensitive dyes in mitochondria and their localization, or use of nonspecific inhibitors to block Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria. Moreover, the electron probe microanalysis approach in isolated hearts failed to detect any significant increase in mitochondrial total calcium content with isoproterenol stimulation, and yet an increase in pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was observed (27Moravec C.M. Desnoyer R.W. Milovanovic M. Schluchter M.D. Bond M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1432-H1439PubMed Google Scholar). A specific inhibitor of Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria will be helpful to elucidate the role of Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria in cardiac muscle and to clarify certain controversies.Ruthenium red (RR) 1The abbreviations used are: RR, ruthenium red; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; SL, sarcolemmal; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; BES, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]ethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: RR, ruthenium red; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; SL, sarcolemmal; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; BES, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]ethanesulfonic acid. has been shown to inhibit Ca2+ uptake into isolated mitochondria (28Moore C.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 42: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 29Reed K.C. Bygrave F.L. Biochem. J. 1974; 140: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). However, it was also shown to inhibit Ca2+ release from SR (30Chamberlain B.K. Volpe P. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7547-7553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was found to produce both positive or negative inotropic effects in isolated rat hearts depending on its concentration in the perfusion solution (31Gupta M.P. Innes I.R. Dhalla N.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: H1413-H1420PubMed Google Scholar). These effects of RR were attributed to its ability to inhibit SR Ca2+ release or sarcolemmal Na+/Ca2+ exchange. The inhibition of Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria however was shown to be due to a contaminant in the commercial preparations of RR (32Reed K.C. Bygrave F.L. FEBS Lett. 1974; 46: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Recently, an oxygen-bridged dimeric ruthenium amine complex, which absorbs light at 360 nm (named Ru360), has been reported to inhibit Ca2+-stimulated respiration in isolated liver mitochondria (33Ying W-L. Emerson J. Clarke M.J. Sanadi D.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4949-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 34Emerson J. Clarke M.J. Ying W-L. Sanadi D.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 11799-11805Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This compound would be an extremely useful tool for elucidating the role or the contribution of Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria in vivo in isolated hearts or in situ in isolated cardiomyocytes if it penetrates the cell membrane but does not affect other cellular Ca2+ transport processes or cardiac cell contractility. To date, the specificity of Ru360 in inhibiting Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria in vitro or in intact cells has not been determined.The objectives of this study are to determine the: 1) potency, effectiveness, binding, and mechanism of action of Ru360 on Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria in vitro; 2) effects of Ru360 on processes involved in cardiac contraction, such as SR Ca2+ uptake and release, SL Na+/Ca2+ exchange, L-type Ca2+ current, and myofibrilar actomyosin ATPase; 3) effects of Ru360 on [Ca2+] c transient and cell shortening; and 4) uptake of Ru360 into intact cardiac myocytes and inhibition of Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria in situ. The results demonstrate that Ru360 binds to mitochondria with high affinity and specifically blocks Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria in vitro and in situ in intact myocytes without affecting other cellular processes involved in cardiac contraction.DISCUSSIONThe results presented here demonstrate that Ru360 is more potent and specific than RR in inhibiting Ca2+ uptake into heart mitochondria. The lack of effect of Ru360 on Na+-induced Ca2+ release process of mitochondria indicates that it selectively inhibits the Ca2+ uptake process. The concentrations at which Ru360 binds to mitochondria also inhibited Ca2+ uptake. The results suggest that binding of Ru360 to a high affinity site in the mitochondrial membrane causes inhibition of Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria. The number of binding sites in the mitochondrial membranes appear small (80 fmol/mg of protein). Assuming 40 mg of mitochondrial protein/ml cell volume, this corresponds to 3–4 nm Ru360 binding sites in the cell. Furthermore, the 120 nmol of Ca2+/mg/min uptake rate blocked by Ru360 would correspond to ∼25,000 calcium ions/s/Ru360 binding site. This rate of Ca2+ influx would be consistent with an ion channel rather than other transport mechanisms. However, whether the Ru360 binding site is located in the Ca2+ uptake uniporter protein or in a regulatory protein molecule associated with the uniporter cannot be determined until the uniporter protein or the Ru360 binding site is identified.Ruthenium red has been shown not only to inhibit Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria but also SR ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ release channel (30Chamberlain B.K. Volpe P. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7547-7553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), sarcolemmal voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel (48Vassilev P.M. Kanazirska M.P. Charamella L.J. Dimitrov N.V. Tien H.T. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 519-522PubMed Google Scholar), and the sarcolemmal Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (31Gupta M.P. Innes I.R. Dhalla N.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: H1413-H1420PubMed Google Scholar). These effects of RR preclude its usefulness as a specific inhibitor of Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria in intact cells or organs. Despite these effects, RR has been used and continues to be used in isolated cells and isolated hearts. Although the results obtained from these studies were often consistent with inhibition of Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria, the contributions of inhibition of Ca2+ release from SR, voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel, or sarcolemmal Na+/Ca2+ exchanger could not be completely excluded. Results presented here demonstrate that Ru360 does not produce any of these effects. These characteristics of Ru360 distinguish it from RR and establish it as a more potent and specific inhibitor of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake.Since Ru360 specifically inhibits Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria, it could be a very useful tool for estimating the contribution of mitochondrial Ca2+ transport in the regulation of [Ca2+] m and [Ca2+] c. Moreover, it will also be useful to 1) demonstrate cause-effect relationship of Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria, 2) estimate contribution of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake into cell function in normal or diseased states, 3) eliminate mitochondrial Ca2+ transport when experimental condition dictates, 4) identify hitherto unknown role of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, 5) elucidate the mechanism of Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria, and 6) identify molecular nature of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake uniporter.An ideal inhibitor should specifically bind to mitochondria with high affinity in the same concentration range as the inhibition of Ca2+ uptake, permeate the cell membrane, and specifically inhibit Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria in situ in intact cells. Results presented here demonstrate that103Ru360 is indeed taken up by myocardial cells and is accumulated in the cytosol in a biphasic manner. The very rapid phase of 103Ru360 uptake may be due to binding to the cell surface while the slow phase could be due to intracellular accumulation. The relatively slow uptake could be due to the positive charge and/or low lipid solubility of the compound. After 30 min, the slow uptake may amount to ∼100 nm (see “Results”). This is still 500 times the IC50 shown in Fig. 2 A and 25 times the number of mitochondrial Ru360 binding sites in the cell. Thus the quantity of cellular uptake of 1 μm Ru360 in 30 min is certainly more than sufficient to explain the functional blockade of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake observed with 10 μm Ru360 in patch-clamped myocytes (Fig. 9). The results also indicate that micromolar extracellular concentrations of Ru360 and prolonged incubation are required for accumulation in cytosol at concentrations sufficient for the inhibition of Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria in intact cardiac myocytes. Nevertheless, the results presented here also show that micromolar concentrations of Ru360 produce no effect on contractility of single cardiac myocytes. Therefore, Ru360 can be used at low micromolar concentrations to inhibit Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria without affecting cellular processes involved in cardiac contractility.Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria in a functioning single cardiac myocyte has been controversial. Some investigators have demonstrated Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria in stimulated cells (13Miyata H. Silverman H.S. Sollott S.J. Lakata E.G. Stern M.D. Hansford R.G. Am. J.

The disparity in the results could be due to differences in the state of the cells, the workload imposed, and on the experimental approach. Ru360 will be useful in the resolution of this controversy by verifying that Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria is indeed the consequence of the specific interventions. To demonstrate the utility of Ru360 in the inhibition of Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria in situ in single cardiomyocytes, we have employed a procedure of simultaneous measurements of cell shortening by edge-detection, [Ca2+] c from changes in cell length during systole, and [Ca2+] m from indo-1 fluorescence in whole cell patch-clamped single cardiac myocytes (46Zhou Z. Matlib M.A. Bers D.M. J. Physiol. 1998; 507: 379-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In this procedure, strong stimulation of the cell caused a sustained increase in intracellular indo-1 fluorescence the kinetics of which was dissociated from cell contraction and relaxation reflecting normal [Ca2+] c transients. We attributed the increase in indo-1 fluorescence and slowed kinetics to Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria and resultant increase in [Ca2+] m. This also matches our previous report of the same effect of Ru360 delivered intracellularly through the patch pipette (46Zhou Z. Matlib M.A. Bers D.M. J. Physiol. 1998; 507: 379-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The present experiments demonstrate that Ru360 enters intact functioning myocytes and inhibits Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria in situ without affecting cell contractility. However, it required up to 30 min incubation of the cells with 10 μm Ru360 to observe complete block of Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria. The outcome of this experiment further confirms our observation that incubation of intact cardiac myocytes for a period of time with Ru360 is required for sufficient intracellular accumulation for the inhibition of Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria in situ. Furthermore, this observation is in quantitative agreement with the slow phase of 103Ru360 uptake by isolated myocytes.In summary, we demonstrate in this study that Ru360 inhibits Ca2+ uptake without affecting Na+-induced Ca2+ release from mitochondria. We observed no effect of Ru360 on Ca2+ uptake or release from SR, Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity of SL, voltage-dependent l-type Ca2+ channel activity of cell membrane, or Ca2+-stimulated actomyosin-ATPase activity of myofibrils. Also, we observed no effect of Ru360 on [Ca2+] c and shortening transients in field-stimulated single cardiomyocytes. We conclude that Ru360 is a novel specific inhibitor of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. Furthermore, it is a valuable tool in studying Ca2+ regulation of mitochondria, both in isolation and in intact cells. Since the discovery of Ca2+ transport into energized mitochondria about 30 years ago, numerous studies have been conducted on its kinetics and regulation in mitochondria isolated from various tissues (for review, see Gunter and Pfeiffer (1Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C755-C786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). It is now generally accepted that mitochondria act as a sink during cytosolic Ca2+ overload in diseased or damaged cells. However, the physiological role of Ca2+ transport into mitochondria in intact cells remains unresolved. In recent years, evidence has been accumulating that Ca2+ transport into mitochondria occurs in stimulated cells. For instance, it has been shown that mitochondria accumulate Ca2+ from an intracellular microdomain of high Ca2+ upon stimulation of cloned HeLa cells that express the Ca2+-sensitive photoprotein aequorin in mitochondria (2Rizzuto R. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Science. 1993; 262: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria in situ has also been observed in stimulated pancreatic cells (3Glennon C.M. Bird G. St J. Takemura H. Thastrup O. Leslie B.A. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol.

These studies indicate that mitochondria accumulate Ca2+ when the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+] c) increases in stimulated cells. In cardiac muscle cells, mitochondria appear to accumulate only about 1% of the [Ca2+] c during relaxation of a single twitch (12Bassani J.W.M. Bassani R.A. Bers D.M. J. Physiol. 1992; 453: 591-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). This fraction is not enough to significantly affect [Ca2+] c and cell contractility. However, increase in mitochondrial matrix free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+] m) has been observed when myocytes were stimulated to increase [Ca2+] c (13Miyata H. Silverman H.S. Sollott S.J. Lakata E.G.

An increase in mitochondrial total Ca content with increased workload has also been observed in isolated cardiac myocytes by x-ray electron probe microanalysis (19Isenberg G. Han S. Schiefer A. Wendt-Gallitelli M-F. Cardiovasc. Res. 1993; 27: 1800-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Increase in [Ca2+] m in vivo in isolated heart preparations with increased workload has also been observed (20Schreur J.H.M. Figueredo V.M. Miyamae M. Shames D.M. Baker A.J. Camacho S.A. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2571-2580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The significance of Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria and increase in [Ca2+] m in cardiac and other cell types, however, has not been elucidated. It has been suggested that the increase in [Ca2+] m may stimulate Ca2+-sensitive matrix dehydrogenases, and thus augment the rate of ATP synthesis to meet the heightened energy demand (21Denton R.M. McCormack J.G. FEBS Lett. 1980; 119: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 22Hansford R.G. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1985; 102: 1-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23McCormack J.G.

Verification of this hypothesis requires demonstration of Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria and the consequent increase in matrix NAD(P)H and ATP synthesis in stimulated cardiac myocytes. The conclusions of the studies referred to above are based on presumed localization of Ca2+-sensitive dyes in mitochondria and their localization, or use of nonspecific inhibitors to block Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria. Moreover, the electron probe microanalysis approach in isolated hearts failed to detect any significant increase in mitochondrial total calcium content with isoproterenol stimulation, and yet an increase in pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was observed (27Moravec C.M. Desnoyer R.W. Milovanovic M. Schluchter M.D. Bond M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1432-H1439PubMed Google Scholar). A specific inhibitor of Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria will be helpful to elucidate the role of Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria in cardiac muscle and to clarify certain controversies. Ruthenium red (RR) 1The abbreviations used are: RR, ruthenium red; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; SL, sarcolemmal; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; BES, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]ethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: RR, ruthenium red; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; SL, sarcolemmal; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; BES, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]ethanesulfonic acid. has been shown to inhibit Ca2+ uptake into isolated mitochondria (28Moore C.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 42: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 29Reed K.C. Bygrave F.L. Biochem. J. 1974; 140: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). However, it was also shown to inhibit Ca2+ release from SR (30Chamberlain B.K. Volpe P. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7547-7553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was found to produce both positive or negative inotropic effects in isolated rat hearts depending on its concentration in the perfusion solution (31Gupta M.P. Innes I.R. Dhalla N.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: H1413-H1420PubMed Google Scholar). These effects of RR were attributed to its ability to inhibit SR Ca2+ release or sarcolemmal Na+/Ca2+ exchange. The inhibition of Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria however was shown to be due to a contaminant in the commercial preparations of RR (32Reed K.C. Bygrave F.L. FEBS Lett. 1974; 46: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Recently, an oxygen-bridged dimeric ruthenium amine complex, which absorbs light at 360 nm (named Ru360), has been reported to inhibit Ca2+-stimulated respiration in isolated liver mitochondria (33Ying W-L. Emerson J. Clarke M.J. Sanadi D.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4949-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 34Emerson J. Clarke M.J. Ying W-L. Sanadi D.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 11799-11805Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This compound would be an extremely useful tool for elucidating the role or the contribution of Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria in vivo in isolated hearts or in situ in isolated cardiomyocytes if it penetrates the cell membrane but does not affect other cellular Ca2+ transport processes or cardiac cell contractility. To date, the specificity of Ru360 in inhibiting Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria in vitro or in intact cells has not been determined. The objectives of this study are to determine the: 1) potency, effectiveness, binding, and mechanism of action of Ru360 on Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria in vitro; 2) effects of Ru360 on processes involved in cardiac contraction, such as SR Ca2+ uptake and release, SL Na+/Ca2+ exchange, L-type Ca2+ current, and myofibrilar actomyosin ATPase; 3) effects of Ru360 on [Ca2+] c transient and cell shortening; and 4) uptake of Ru360 into intact cardiac myocytes and inhibition of Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria in situ. The results demonstrate that Ru360 binds to mitochondria with high affinity and specifically blocks Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria in vitro and in situ in intact myocytes without affecting other cellular processes involved in cardiac contraction. DISCUSSIONThe results presented here demonstrate that Ru360 is more potent and specific than RR in inhibiting Ca2+ uptake into heart mitochondria. The lack of effect of Ru360 on Na+-induced Ca2+ release process of mitochondria indicates that it selectively inhibits the Ca2+ uptake process. The concentrations at which Ru360 binds to mitochondria also inhibited Ca2+ uptake. The results suggest that binding of Ru360 to a high affinity site in the mitochondrial membrane causes inhibition of Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria. The number of binding sites in the mitochondrial membranes appear small (80 fmol/mg of protein). Assuming 40 mg of mitochondrial protein/ml cell volume, this corresponds to 3–4 nm Ru360 binding sites in the cell. Furthermore, the 120 nmol of Ca2+/mg/min uptake rate blocked by Ru360 would correspond to ∼25,000 calcium ions/s/Ru360 binding site. This rate of Ca2+ influx would be consistent with an ion channel rather than other transport mechanisms. However, whether the Ru360 binding site is located in the Ca2+ uptake uniporter protein or in a regulatory protein molecule associated with the uniporter cannot be determined until the uniporter protein or the Ru360 binding site is identified.Ruthenium red has been shown not only to inhibit Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria but also SR ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ release channel (30Chamberlain B.K. Volpe P. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7547-7553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), sarcolemmal voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel (48Vassilev P.M. Kanazirska M.P. Charamella L.J. Dimitrov N.V. Tien H.T. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 519-522PubMed Google Scholar), and the sarcolemmal Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (31Gupta M.P. Innes I.R. Dhalla N.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: H1413-H1420PubMed Google Scholar). These effects of RR preclude its usefulness as a specific inhibitor of Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria in intact cells or organs. Despite these effects, RR has been used and continues to be used in isolated cells and isolated hearts. Although the results obtained from these studies were often consistent with inhibition of Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria, the contributions of inhibition of Ca2+ release from SR, voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel, or sarcolemmal Na+/Ca2+ exchanger could not be completely excluded. Results presented here demonstrate that Ru360 does not produce any of these effects. These characteristics of Ru360 distinguish it from RR and establish it as a more potent and specific inhibitor of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake.Since Ru360 specifically inhibits Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria, it could be a very useful tool for estimating the contribution of mitochondrial Ca2+ transport in the regulation of [Ca2+] m and [Ca2+] c. Moreover, it will also be useful to 1) demonstrate cause-effect relationship of Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria, 2) estimate contribution of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake into cell function in normal or diseased states, 3) eliminate mitochondrial Ca2+ transport when experimental condition dictates, 4) identify hitherto unknown role of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, 5) elucidate the mechanism of Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria, and 6) identify molecular nature of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake uniporter.An ideal inhibitor should specifically bind to mitochondria with high affinity in the same concentration range as the inhibition of Ca2+ uptake, permeate the cell membrane, and specifically inhibit Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria in situ in intact cells. Results presented here demonstrate that103Ru360 is indeed taken up by myocardial cells and is accumulated in the cytosol in a biphasic manner. The very rapid phase of 103Ru360 uptake may be due to binding to the cell surface while the slow phase could be due to intracellular accumulation. The relatively slow uptake could be due to the positive charge and/or low lipid solubility of the compound. After 30 min, the slow uptake may amount to ∼100 nm (see “Results”). This is still 500 times the IC50 shown in Fig. 2 A and 25 times the number of mitochondrial Ru360 binding sites in the cell. Thus the quantity of cellular uptake of 1 μm Ru360 in 30 min is certainly more than sufficient to explain the functional blockade of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake observed with 10 μm Ru360 in patch-clamped myocytes (Fig. 9). The results also indicate that micromolar extracellular concentrations of Ru360 and prolonged incubation are required for accumulation in cytosol at concentrations sufficient for the inhibition of Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria in intact cardiac myocytes. Nevertheless, the results presented here also show that micromolar concentrations of Ru360 produce no effect on contractility of single cardiac myocytes. Therefore, Ru360 can be used at low micromolar concentrations to inhibit Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria without affecting cellular processes involved in cardiac contractility.Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria in a functioning single cardiac myocyte has been controversial. Some investigators have demonstrated Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria in stimulated cells (13Miyata H. Silverman H.S. Sollott S.J. Lakata E.G. Stern M.D. Hansford R.G. Am. J.

To demonstrate the utility of Ru360 in the inhibition of Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria in situ in single cardiomyocytes, we have employed a procedure of simultaneous measurements of cell shortening by edge-detection, [Ca2+] c from changes in cell length during systole, and [Ca2+] m from indo-1 fluorescence in whole cell patch-clamped single cardiac myocytes (46Zhou Z. Matlib M.A. Bers D.M. J. Physiol. 1998; 507: 379-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In this procedure, strong stimulation of the cell caused a sustained increase in intracellular indo-1 fluorescence the kinetics of which was dissociated from cell contraction and relaxation reflecting normal [Ca2+] c transients. We attributed the increase in indo-1 fluorescence and slowed kinetics to Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria and resultant increase in [Ca2+] m. This also matches our previous report of the same effect of Ru360 delivered intracellularly through the patch pipette (46Zhou Z. Matlib M.A. Bers D.M. J. Physiol. 1998; 507: 379-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The present experiments demonstrate that Ru360 enters intact functioning myocytes and inhibits Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria in situ without affecting cell contractility. However, it required up to 30 min incubation of the cells with 10 μm Ru360 to observe complete block of Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria. The outcome of this experiment further confirms our observation that incubation of intact cardiac myocytes for a period of time with Ru360 is required for sufficient intracellular accumulation for the inhibition of Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria in situ. Furthermore, this observation is in quantitative agreement with the slow phase of 103Ru360 uptake by isolated myocytes. In summary, we demonstrate in this study that Ru360 inhibits Ca2+ uptake without affecting Na+-induced Ca2+ release from mitochondria. We observed no effect of Ru360 on Ca2+ uptake or release from SR, Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity of SL, voltage-dependent l-type Ca2+ channel activity of cell membrane, or Ca2+-stimulated actomyosin-ATPase activity of myofibrils. Also, we observed no effect of Ru360 on [Ca2+] c and shortening transients in field-stimulated single cardiomyocytes. We conclude that Ru360 is a novel specific inhibitor of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. Furthermore, it is a valuable tool in studying Ca2+ regulation of mitochondria, both in isolation and in intact cells.

Synthesis of Ru360, experiments on isolated mitochondria, uptake into isolated myocytes, Ca2+ uptake into isolated SR and SL vesicles, actomyosin ATPase, and measurements of contraction and [Ca2+] c transients in single cardiomyocytes were carried out in Dr. Matlib's laboratory. The chemical structure of Ru360 was determined by Dr. Krause-Bauer. L-type calcium channel activity was determined by Drs. Katsube and Sperelakis, and SR Ca2+ release channel activity in lysed cardiomyocytes was determined by Drs. Phillips and Altschuld. Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria in situ in patch-clamped single cardiomyocytes was determined by Drs. Zhou, Matlib, and Bers."
https://openalex.org/W1993582195,"Characterization of mammalian homologues of Drosophila TRP proteins, which induce light-activated Ca2+ conductance in photoreceptors, has been an important clue to understand molecular mechanisms underlying receptor-activated Ca2+ influx in vertebrate cells. We have here isolated cDNA that encodes a novel TRP homologue, TRP5, predominantly expressed in the brain. Recombinant expression of the TRP5 cDNA in human embryonic kidney cells dramatically potentiated extracellular Ca2+-dependent rises of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+] i) evoked by ATP. These [Ca2+] i transients were inhibited by SK&F96365, a blocker of receptor-activated Ca2+ entry, and by La3+. Expression of the TRP5 cDNA, however, did not significantly affect [Ca2+] i transients induced by thapsigargin, an inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases. ATP stimulation of TRP5-transfected cells pretreated with thapsigargin to deplete internal Ca2+ stores caused intact extracellular Ca2+-dependent [Ca2+] i transients, whereas ATP suppressed [Ca2+] i in thapsigargin-pretreated control cells. Furthermore, in ATP-stimulated, TRP5-expressing cells, there was no significant correlation between Ca2+ release from the internal Ca2+ store and influx of extracellular Ca2+. Whole-cell mode of patch-clamp recording from TRP5-expressing cells demonstrated that ATP application induced a large inward current in the presence of extracellular Ca2+. Omission of Ca2+ from intrapipette solution abolished the current in TRP5-expressing cells, whereas 10 nm intrapipette Ca2+ was sufficient to support TRP5 activity triggered by ATP receptor stimulation. Permeability ratios estimated from the zero-current potentials of this current were P Ca:P Na:P Cs= 14.3:1.5:1. Our findings suggest that TRP5 directs the formation of a Ca2+-selective ion channel activated by receptor stimulation through a pathway that involves Ca2+ but not depletion of Ca2+ store in mammalian cells.

Calcium (Ca2+) influx across the plasma membrane plays a vital role in the regulation of diverse cellular processes, ranging from ubiquitous activities like gene expression to tissue-specific functions such as neurotransmitter release and muscle contraction, by controlling the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+] i) (1Tsien R.W.

Among members of the group, recent attention was particularly directed to capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE; in other words, Ca2+ release-activated current (I CRAC), or store-operated channel), that is activated through Ca2+ release from the intracellular Ca2+ store, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), induced by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and consequent depletion of Ca2+ from the store (2Clapham D.E.

Sci. 1994; 15: 77-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). An important clue for understanding the molecular basis of receptor-activated Ca2+ influx was first attained through the finding of a Drosophila visual transduction mutation transient receptor potential (trp), whose photoreceptors fail to generate the Ca2+-dependent sustained phase of receptor potential and to induce subsequent Ca2+-dependent adaptation to light (17Fein A. Payne R. Corson D.W. Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1984; 311: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 18Ranganathan R. Malicki D.M. Zuker C.S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 283-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Inasmuch as the gene products of the trp and trp-like (trpl) gene (TRP and TRPL) comprise the light-activated, PI-dependent Ca2+ conductance in Drosophila photoreceptors (19Niemeyer B.A. Suzuki E. Scott K. Jalink K. Zuker C.S. Cell. 1996; 85: 651-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), the original hypothesis that the counterparts of TRP and TRPL are responsible for CCE in vertebrate cells was based upon analogy between the phototransduction mechanism in Drosophila and the PI-dependent signal transduction processes in vertebrates (18Ranganathan R. Malicki D.M. Zuker C.S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 283-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In fact, recent molecular characterization has unveiled the existence of multiple genes encoding TRP homologues in vertebrate cells (20Petersen C.C.H. Berridge M.J. Borgese M.F. Bennett D.L. Biochem.

Neuron. 1997; 13: 881-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (197) Google Scholar) demonstrated that photoreceptors from Drosophila with homozygous loss-of-function mutation of IP3 receptors were indistinguishable from wild-type controls in sensitivity, kinetics, and adaptation of response to light. Furthermore, most significantly, low IP3 concentrations can induce substantial Ca2+ release from the stores without activating Ca2+ entry at all in rat leukemia cells, suggesting that even the activation of CCE is not that tightly coupled to Ca2+ release from the IP3-sensitive stores (12Parekh A.B. Fleig A. Penner R. Cell. 1997; 89: 973-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Thus, criteria of activation trigger, other than depletion of Ca2+ store, should be considered in functionally establishing cloned TRP channels to be correlated with native Ca2+ channels responsible for receptor-activated Ca2+ influx, including CCE. We have here isolated cDNA that encodes a novel TRP homologue, TRP5, predominantly expressed in the brain. The recombinant expression of the TRP5 cDNA in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells potentiated an extracellular Ca2+-dependent increase of [Ca2+] i evoked by ATP, but not by an inhibitor of ER Ca2+-ATPases, thapsigargin. Whole-cell mode of patch-clamp recordings from TRP5-expressing cells demonstrated that ATP application induced a large inward current in the presence of extracellular Ca2+, which reversed at a positive potential. Our findings suggest that TRP5 directs the formation of a highly Ca2+-permeable ion channel that can be activated through receptor-operative pathways other than depletion of Ca2+ from Ca2+ stores in brain neurons. A mixture of oligo(dT)-primed cDNAs synthesized from the mouse (BALB/c or 129/SvJ) brain poly(A)+ RNA was subjected to PCR amplification using a Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH). Degenerate oligonucleotide primers used were 5′-TGGGGCC(T/C/A)(T/C)TGCAGAT(A/C)TC(T/A)CTGGGA-3′ and 5′-(G/T)G(A/T)TCG(A/G)GCAAA(C/T)TTCCA(C/T)TC-3′. Obtained PCR products were subsequently subcloned into the T/A cloning plasmid, pCRII (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), to yield pTRP15. Sequence comparison with a PCR product amplified using a pair of specific oligonucleotide primers T5–1 (5′-TATCTACTGCCTAGTACTACTGG-3′) and T5–2 (5′-GCAATGAGCTGGTAGGAGTTATTC-3′) according to the partial genomic nucleotide sequence given in Zhu et al. (24Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar) confirmed that the cDNA insert carried by pTRP15 encodes mouse TRP5. Further screening was performed to obtain entire coding cDNAs for mouse TRP5. Oligo(dT)-primed, size-selected (>1 kilobase pairs (kb)) cDNA libraries constructed in the λ Uni-ZAP XR vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using poly(A)+ RNA from the brain of adult BALB/c or postnatal 14-day-old (P14) C57BL/6J mice were screened to yield mouse TRP5 clones λm37 (1020–3166; nucleotide numbers from the first residue of the initiation ATG triplet) and λO4 (1134–3287 followed by a poly(dA) tract). Additional clones harboring cDNAs for the further upstream regions of mouse TRP5 were isolated by screening a specific oligonucleotide-primed cDNA transcripts of poly(A)+ RNA from the brain of P14 C57BL/6J mice constructed in the λ Uni-ZAP XR vector. The specific oligonucleotide primer (5′-GAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAACTAGTCTCGAGTCAAGCAGCATTCGTCCC-3′) was according to the sequence in the clone λm37 and was designed to contain an additional sequence of a XhoI site protected by GA repeats for subcloning into the λ Uni-ZAP XR vector. λO15 (−232 to 1547) and the other 13 hybridization-positive clones were isolated through hybridization with the 657-base pair EcoRI(on vector)/BamHI(1665) fragment from λm37. cDNA clones were sequenced on both strands using an automated sequencer (model 373S; Perkin Elmer). RNA blot hybridization analysis was carried out using 20 μg of total RNA from various tissues. The probe was the ∼0.9-kb EcoRI(on vector)/HindIII(2092) fragment from λm37. A random primer DNA labeling kit (version 2; Takara, Otsu, Japan) was used to prepare the 32P-labeled probe. Hybridization was performed at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 0.1% SDS, 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.1% Ficoll 400 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.2 mg/ml sonicated herring sperm DNA, as described previously (34Mori Y. Friedrich T. Kim M.-S. Mikami A. Nakai J. Ruth P. Bosse E. Hofmann F. Flockerzi V. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Numa S. Nature. 1991; 350: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription and PCR amplification from 1 μg of total RNA were performed using r Tth DNA polymerase (RT-PCR high Plus; Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). Pairs of primers used for amplification of TRP5 and cyclophilin were T5–1 and T5–2 (see above), and 5′-GCAGCCATGGTCAACCCCACCG-3′ and 5′-GAAATTAGAGCTGTCCACAGTCGG-3′ (GenBank™ accession no. X52803), respectively. The thermocycler was programmed to give an initial cycle consisting of 60 °C reverse transcription for 5 min and 94 °C denaturation for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C denaturation for 1 min and 52 °C annealing/extension for 1.5 min. The final cycle was followed by an additional extension at 52 °C for 7 min. To verify the identity of the PCR products, Southern blots were hybridized with 32P-5′-end-labeled synthetic oligonucleotide probes 5′-ATGAACCTAACAACTGCAAGG-3′ and 5′-CGACATCACGGCCGATGACGAGCCC-3′ for detection of TRP5 and cyclophilin mRNA, respectively. Hybridization was performed at 50 °C in 6× SSC, 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 0.2% SDS, 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.1% Ficoll 400, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 mg/ml sonicated herring sperm DNA. A PCR product amplified from the clone λO15 using a sense primer (5′-GGGTCGACGGGTTTTTATTTTTAATTTTCTTTCAAATACTTCCACCATGGCCCAGCTGTACTAC-3′), designed to contain the untranslated leader sequence from the alfalfa mosaic virus (35Jobling S.A. Gehrke L. Nature. 1987; 325: 622-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), a consensus sequence for translation initiation (36Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3555) Google Scholar), and nucleotide residues 1–18 of TRP5, and an antisense primer (5′-CCAAAGGATCCATGCAGTTGATGTTGAC-3′), was digested with SalI and BamHI. Another PCR product amplified from λO4 using a sense primer (5′-CCTCTGCAGATCTCTTTGGGACGAATGC-3′) and an antisense primer (5′-ATGGCGGCCGCAAAACATGAAGAATGTGGC-3′) was digested with PstI and NotI. The resulting fragments were ligated with the BamHI(199)/PstI(1521) fragment from λO15 and the 5.5-kb SalI/NotI fragment from pCI-neo (Promega, Madison, WI) to yield pCI-neo-mTRP5. HEK293 cells (RIKEN Cell Bank, Tsukuba, Japan) were transfected with the recombinant plasmids pCI-neo-mTRP5 plus πH3-CD8 containing the cDNA of the T-cell antigen CD8 (37Jurman M.E. Boland L.M. Liu Y. Yellen G. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 876-881PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection was carried out using SuperFect Transfection Reagent (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Cells were trypsinized, diluted with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 30 units/ml penicillin, and 30 μg/ml streptomycin, and plated onto glass coverslips 18 h after transfection. Then cells were subjected to measurements 36–66 h after plating on the coverslips. TRP5-expressing cells were selected through detection of CD8 coexpression using polystyrene microspheres precoated with antibody to CD8 (Dynabeads M-450 CD8; Dynal, Oslo, Norway). Cells on coverslips were loaded with fura-2 by incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5 μm fura-2/AM (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C for 30 min, and washed with HEPES-buffered saline (HBS) containing (in mm): 107 NaCl, 6 KCl, 1.2 MgSO4, 2 CaCl2, 1.2 KH2PO4, 11.5 glucose, 20 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. The coverslips were then placed in a perfusion chamber mounted on the stage of the microscope. Fluorescence images of the cells were recorded and analyzed with a video image analysis system (ARGUS-50/CA, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan) according to the method of Hazama and Okada (38Hazama A. Okada Y. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1990; 416: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The fura-2 fluorescence at an emission wavelength of 510 nm (bandwidth, 20 nm) was observed at room temperature by exciting fura-2 alternately at 340 and 380 nm (bandwidth, 11 nm). The 340/380 nm ratio images were obtained on a pixel by pixel basis, and were converted to Ca2+ concentrations by in vitro calibration. The calibration procedure was performed according to Ueda and Okada (39Ueda S. Okada Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1012: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). ATP (100 mm in water), SK&F96365 (10 mm in water), and thapsigargin (2 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide) were diluted to their final concentrations in HBS or Ca2+-free HBS containing (in mm): 107 NaCl, 6 KCl, 1.2 MgSO4, 1.2 KH2PO4, 0.5 EGTA, 11.5 glucose, 20 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH, and applied to the cells by perfusion. LaCl3 and GdCl3 (100 mm in water) were diluted in HBS or Ca2+-free HBS from which KH2PO4 was omitted. The number of CD8-positive cells ranged from 2 to 8 in the field of view during an experiment. Data were accumulated under each condition from two to four experiments using cells prepared through two to three transfections. For electrophysiological measurements, coverslips with cells were placed in dishes containing the solutions. Cells prepared in this manner had membrane capacitance of 21.3 ± 2.3 picofarads (n = 25). Currents from cells were recorded at room temperature using patch-clamp techniques of whole-cell mode (40Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15066) Google Scholar) with an EPC-7 patch-clamp amplifier (List-Medical, Darmstadt, Germany). Patch pipettes were made from borosilicate glass capillaries (1.5 mm, outer diameter; Hilgenberg, Malsfeld, Germany) using a model P-87 Flaming-Brown micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument, San Rafael, CA). Pipette resistance ranged from 2 to 4 megohms when filled with the pipette solution described below. Currents were sampled at 200 Hz after low-pass filtered at 1 kHz (−3 dB) using an 8-pole Bessle filter (900, Frequency Devices, Haverhill, MA) for Fig. 7 (A and B), sampled at 1 kHz for Fig. 7 C, and analyzed with pCLAMP 6.02 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The pipette solution for Fig. 7 contained (in mm): CsOH 105, aspartic acid 105, CsCl 40, MgCl2 2, CaCl2 3.2, EGTA 5, Na2ATP 2, HEPES 5, adjusted to pH 7.2 with CsOH. Calculated free Ca2+ concentration was 200 nm. CaCl2 was 1.33 and 0.34 mm in the pipette solution containing calculated free Ca2+ concentration of 50 and 10 nm, respectively. The “0Ca2+” external solution contained (in mm): NaCl 140, MgCl2 1.2, CaCl2 1.2, EGTA 10, glucose 10, HEPES 11.5, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH (8 nm calculated free Ca2+). The “10Ca2+” external solution contained (in mm): NaCl 122.4, MgCl2 1.2, CaCl2 10, glucose 30, HEPES 11.5, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. The osmolarity of the external solutions was adjusted to about 325 mosm. Rapid exchange of the external solutions was made by a modified “Y-tube” method (41Nakagawa T. Shirasaki T. Wakamori M. Fukuda A. Akaike N. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 8: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A shows the amino acid sequence of the mouse TRP5 deduced from the open reading frame of the corresponding cDNA sequence. The translation initiation codon is assigned to the first in-frame methionine codon downstream of a stop codon. TRP5 is composed of 975 amino acid residues with a hydropathy profile revealing eight hydrophobic segments and hydrophilic N and C termini (Fig. 1 B), similar to those of other TRP subtypes (21Wes P.D.

Sufficient length of hydrophobic regions to span the membrane, together with the lack of a hydrophobic N-terminal sequence indicative of the signal sequence, suggests that TRP5 is a membrane protein with a core of transmembrane segments and the flanking N- and C-terminal regions disposed on the cytoplasmic side, like other TRP subtypes (21Wes P.D.

Homology of TRP5 with TRP homologues is localized in the N-terminal region and the hydrophobic core (data not shown). RNA preparations from different mouse tissues were subjected to Northern blot analysis using TRP5 cDNA as a specific probe (Fig. 2 A). TRP5 mRNA was exclusively detected in the mouse central nervous system. An intense TRP5 signal with size of ∼8.5 kb was present in the forebrain region (olfactory bulb, cerebrum, and midbrain) and a relatively weak signal was detected in the hindbrain region (cerebellum and medulla-pons). This contrasts with the predominant localization of TRP3 and TRP4 in the forebrain region and hindbrain region, respectively (47Mori Y. Takada N. Okada T. Wakamori M. Imoto K. Wanifuchi H. Oka H.

Our studies support the hypothesis that evolutionary radiation of these two gene families gave rise to sets of proteins whose differential expression and combinatorial associations define and organize the membrane compartments of cells. The distribution and restriction of molecules to membrane compartments is an essential process of eukaryotic cells. Distinct organelles of the secretory pathway are synthesized and maintained by budding of transport vesicles from a donor compartment followed by fusion of these vesicles with an acceptor membrane (1Palade G. Science. 1975; 189: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2322) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms responsible for vesicle biogenesis, protein sorting, and membrane fusion are not yet fully understood. While yeast genetics,in vitro biochemistry, and studies of synaptic vesicles have identified many of the components essential for these processes (2Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar, 3Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 63-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 4Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 219-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), the full repertoire of important proteins and their mechanisms of action are yet to be determined. One particularly interesting issue is how a vesicle loaded with specific cargo recognizes the appropriate target. It is becoming clear that several independent mechanisms contribute to the specificity of vesicle trafficking, and it is the sum of these multiple layers of specificity that results in a process with high fidelity (5Scheller R.H.

This process has been extensively studied in the mammalian presynaptic nerve terminal, where formation of a heterotrimeric complex between the v-SNARE, VAMPs 1 or 2, and the t-SNAREs syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25 is thought to serve as a membrane recognition mechanism and may drive fusion of the lipid bilayers (8Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar, 9Lin R.C. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1087-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar).These proteins have subsequently been found to be prototypic members of gene families that span species as well as membrane compartments (6Bennett M.K.

For example, syntaxin homologs in yeast have been localized to the Golgi (Sed5p) (10Banfield D.K. Lewis M.U. Rabouille C. Warren G. Pelham H.R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), endosomes (Pep12p) (11Becherer K.A. Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. Jones E.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), lysosomes (Vam3p) (12Nichols B.J. Ungermann C. Pelham H.R. Wickner W.T. Haas A. Nature. 1997; 387: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), and the plasma membrane (Sso1p and Sso2p) (13Aalto M.K. Ronne H. Keranen S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4095-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). In particular, the SNAREs present on yeast vacuoles have been extensively characterized, and genetic manipulations support the idea that a v-SNARE and a t-SNARE are required on opposite membranes for efficient target recognition and membrane fusion (12Nichols B.J. Ungermann C. Pelham H.R. Wickner W.T. Haas A. Nature. 1997; 387: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Together these studies postulated that members of the syntaxin and VAMP families define membrane compartments and that specific pairing of these proteins represents a determinant of the specificity of vesicle trafficking.Thus studies to date have led to speculation that most, if not all, vesicle trafficking steps require a distinct v-t-SNARE complex. With the entire sequence of the yeast genome now known, all the syntaxin and VAMP family members that can be detected by sequence homology searches have been identified. However, the more complex intracellular architecture and multiple differentiated and specialized tissues of mammals relative to yeast would seemingly require the evolution of additional SNAREs. For example, while six syntaxins are present in the yeast genome, a recent search of the data base of mammalian expressed sequence tags (ESTs) proposed the presence of at least 16 mammalian syntaxins (14Bock J.B. Scheller R.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In order to fully understand the organization of membrane compartments in mammalian cells, it remains necessary to further characterize the spectrum of SNARE proteins. To this end, we have characterized seven new mammalian proteins that we propose to be SNAREs important in intracellular membrane trafficking. While some of the new SNAREs are widely expressed, others are enriched in specific tissues, suggesting an enhanced requirement for particular trafficking steps in those cells. The proteins are specifically localized to the Golgi region, endosomes, and lysosomes, suggesting a role in regulating membrane trafficking to and from these organelles.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIsolation of SNAREsAll ESTs were identified from the GenBankTM Data Bank. All clones were obtained from Genome Systems, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). DNA sequencing was performed using Sequenase 2.0 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).Mouse Vti1a and Vti1bThe GenBankTM Data Bank of ESTs was searched with the yeast Vti1 sequence (15Mollard G.F. Nothwehr S.F. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1511-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Two distinct sets of clones were found. The EST with accession number AA013839contains the full-length sequence termed mVTI1b. The EST with accession number AA016379 contains an open reading frame of 183 amino acids; however, it has an 11-base pair insert relative to accession numberW13616 at bp 560, which causes a frameshift. W13616 is identical toAA016379 from 220–651 bp, but lacks 1–219 bp. Thus mVti1a base pairs 1–219 are derived from AA016379 and 220–651 are derived from W13616. This yields an open reading frame of 217 amino acids.Syntaxin 13As per our earlier search of the GenBankTM EST data base (14Bock J.B. Scheller R.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we obtained a human brain cDNA clone (accession number AA167677). Two 19-bp oligonucleotides were designed and used to amplify a 460-bp sequence using the human brain cDNA clone as a template for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR product was then 32P-labeled by a random hexamer priming reaction and used to screen (60 °C) 5 × 105 plaques from a rat brain stem and spinal cord λZAPII cDNA library (Stratagene Inc.). Screening yielded ten positive, overlapping clones, which were excised into pBluescript KS vector (Stratagene Inc.). The largest clone (2.9 kb) contained an 804-bp open reading frame. This clone was designated syntaxin 13. Tissue distribution and membrane extraction of syntaxin 13 was performed as described previously (16Bock J.B. Lin R.C. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17961-17965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).Syntaxin 11As per our earlier search of the GenBankTM EST data base (14Bock J.B. Scheller R.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we obtained a human germinal B cell clone (accession number AA215741). Sequencing of this clone demonstrated that it contains an 861-bp open reading frame coding for the 287-amino acid protein syntaxin 11.VAMP 4As per our earlier search of the GenBankTM EST data base (14Bock J.B. Scheller R.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we obtained a human germinal center B cell clone (accession number AA490730). Sequencing of this clone demonstrated that it contains a 423-bp open reading frame coding for the 141 amino acid protein VAMP 4.VAMP 8As per our earlier search of the GenBankTM EST data base (14Bock J.B. Scheller R.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we obtained an embryonic clone (accession number AA049140). Sequencing of this clone demonstrated that it contains a 303-bp open reading frame coding for the 101-amino acid protein VAMP 8.VAMP 7As per our earlier search of the GenBankTM data base (14Bock J.B. Scheller R.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we designed oligonucleotides against msybl1/VAMP 7 (accession number X96737). These oligonucleotides were used in a PCR reaction with a rat pancreas λZAPII library (Stratagene Inc.). The PCR product was subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen).Expression ConstructsEpitope-tagged, full-length mVti1b, VAMPs 4 and 8, and syntaxins 11 and 13 were prepared by using PCR with custom designed oligonucleotide primers with appropriate restriction sites. The PCR product was subcloned into either the pcDNA3 (mVti1b, VAMP 4, and syntaxins 11 and 13) or pCMV4 (VAMP 8) mammalian expression vector containing the myc epitope. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.AntibodiesRabbit syntaxin 13 antiserum was generated against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 22–51 of syntaxin 13. Syntaxin 13-specific antibodies then were affinity purified and used for immunoblotting at 1:250 dilution. The specificity of the antibody was confirmed by the ability of synthetic peptide to block the signal in Western blotting (data not shown). For immunoflouresence, anti-mannosidase II monoclonal (Babco) was used at a 1:1000 dilution, anti-transferin receptor (PharMingen) at a dilution of 1:1000, anti-synapsin I at 1:1000 (Chemicon), and anti-myc at 1:1500 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).RNA BlottingHuman, rat, and mouse multiple tissue Northern blots were purchased from either Origene Technologies (blots with six lanes) orCLONTECH (blots with eight lanes). A human blot was used for syntaxin 11; mouse blots were used for mVti1a, mVti1b, VAMP 4, and VAMP 8; and a rat blot was used for VAMP 7. A random-primed32P probe was generated using full-length coding region for each gene. Blots were prehybridized in ExpressHyb Solution (CLONTECH) for 1 h at 60 °C and hybridized for 2 h at 60 °C in prehybridization solution containing32P-labeled probe (2 × 106 cpm/ml). Blots were washed at high stringency in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C.32P-labeled bands were visualized using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics).Immunofluorescence MicroscopyPrimary hippocampal CA3/CA1 cultures were obtained and maintained as described previously (17Banker G.A. Cowan M.W. Brain Res. 1977; 126: 397-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Normal rat kidney (NRK) cells were transiently transfected using the LipofectAMINE Plus system (Life Technologies, Inc.). They were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and immunostained as described previously (18Hay J.C. Hirling H. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5671-5679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).BioinformaticsMost sequence and protein analyses were performed using the GCG software, Version 9.1, package of tools (19Group, G. C. (1994).Google Scholar). Coiled-coil predictions were made using the program Coils (20Lupas A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 513-524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONCurrent hypotheses suggest that VAMPs 1 or 2 and syntaxin 1 associate with SNAP-25 to form a heterotrimeric structure that brings opposing membranes into very close or even direct apposition resulting in the fusion of membranes (9Lin R.C. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1087-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 24Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Analogous complexes of syntaxin and VAMP family members have been isolated for both ER to Golgi and TGN to endosome trafficking (23Hay J.C. Chao D.S. Kuo C.S. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1997; 89: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 25Bock J.B. Klumperman J. Davanger S. Scheller R.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The formation of complexes between members of these families is specific since different syntaxins coimmunoprecipitate unique, although sometimes overlapping, sets of proteins (23Hay J.C. Chao D.S. Kuo C.S. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1997; 89: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Thus while it is clear that other cellular mechanisms play a role in the vectoral transport of vesicles to target membranes, specific SNARE pairing is required for appropriate membrane fusion. These ideas give rise to the view that the localization of SNARE proteins of the VAMP and syntaxin families define sets of membranes that have the capacity to fuse with each other based on the capacity of the proteins to form stable complexes.If SNARE protein pairing is a critical event mediating membrane fusion events, defining the localization of particular VAMP and syntaxin family members to the correct vesicle or target membranes becomes essential. In this report, we define the subcellular localization of six novel mammalian SNARE proteins through the transfection of epitope-tagged constructs. We have previously used stable and transient transfection techniques as a means of localizing SNARE proteins (18Hay J.C. Hirling H. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5671-5679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Expression levels vary greatly in the transfected cells making it possible for us to base our conclusions on cells that express relatively low levels of the proteins, thus reducing the possibility of mislocalization due to overexpression. As markers, we have used mannosidase II to identify the intermediate stacks of the Golgi, syntaxin 6 to identify the trans Golgi network, transferrin receptor to identify endosomes, and lgp120 to identify lysosomes. While much of the immunoreactivity revealed by these markers is localized in the Golgi region concentrated to one side of the nucleus, each of the specific staining patterns has a unique fine structure. Based on our analysis, the proteins characterized in this report are localized in the Golgi region where a diversity of organelles are localized. More detailed electron microscopic studies will be needed to precisely define the membrane compartments occupied by each of the SNAREs.An additional complication arises when localizing SNAREs, especially v-SNAREs, in that they are trafficking proteins and thus cycle between donor and acceptor membranes. While our studies only evaluate the steady-state levels of the SNAREs, this information at least narrows the possible pathways these SNAREs are involved with. An interesting example is VAMP 7. Recall that this protein colocalizes almost precisely with the lysosomal protein lgp120. This observation likely narrows the possible trafficking pathways VAMP 7 is involved with from dozens down to three. VAMP 7 could be an anterograde v-SNARE present at low levels on transport vesicles targeted to the lysosome, with a high steady-state level on the lysosome. VAMP 7 could be a v-SNARE present at low levels on lysosome-derived vesicles targeted to other membrane compartments. It is even possible that VAMP 7 functions as a vesicle receptor for lysosome-targeted vesicles; there are examples of where the traditional roles of v- and t-SNAREs may be reversed (25Bock J.B. Klumperman J. Davanger S. Scheller R.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar).A blurring of the distinctions between v- and t-SNAREs also is becoming apparent on the sequence level. There are now at least 15 members of the mammalian syntaxin gene family (Fig. 13). This family falls into two groups which are only distantly related to each other. The first group contains the “classic” syntaxin proteins, including syntaxin 1 localized to the plasma membrane and syntaxin 5 localized to the Golgi. Syntaxins 11 and 13 belong to this group. The second group contains syntaxin 6 localized to the TGN, as well as SNAP-25 and SNAP-23 (25Bock J.B. Klumperman J. Davanger S. Scheller R.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the mammalian Vti1 clones also fit into this group, even though they are currently thought to be v-SNAREs. These data suggest that not only are the v-SNAREs part of one large family but that in the distant past both v- and t-SNARE proteins may have been one large gene family that served to mediate the events of membrane fusion. Early in evolution, these events were likely to have been homotypic fusion processes where the notion of “v” and “t” is irrelevant. Interestingly in recent homotypic fusion studies, while v-t-SNARE pairing was most efficient, a surprising amount of fusion occurred through presumed t-t-SNARE pairing (12Nichols B.J. Ungermann C. Pelham H.R. Wickner W.T. Haas A. Nature. 1997; 387: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar).The v-SNAREs as a group appear more divergent than the syntaxins or t-SNAREs. Thus only a subset of proposed v-SNAREs fits into a single evolutionary tree. The family of seven members has as its core the three original members VAMPs 1 and 2 and cellubrevin (26McMahon H.T. Ushkaryov Y.A. Edelmann L. Link E. Binz T. Niemann H. Jahn R. Sudhoff T.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) as well as the distantly related msec22b (23Hay J.C. Chao D.S. Kuo C.S. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1997; 89: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), a likely v-SNARE for ER to Golgi trafficking (Fig. 14).Figure 14VAMP evolutionary relationships. A multiple sequence alignment of the VAMP family members was created with the Pileup program. A, evolutionary distances were calculated with the Kimura algorithm using the Distances program. A phylogenetic tree was created using the UPGMA method in the Growtree program. The horizontal distance between two proteins is proportional to their evolutionary divergence. GenBankTM accession numbers for the sequences are in parentheses. Asterisks (*) denote proteins identified in this paper. B, the similarity of the VAMPs in the multiple sequence alignment was plotted versusposition in the alignment. Most similarity is in the C terminus (high position number).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)When both of these families of sequences are compared along the length of the proteins, the most highly conserved region is found to be the predicted coiled-coil region closest to the membrane (Figs. 13 and 14). This is consistent with this part of the protein being critical for complex formation and for driving membrane fusion. Differences between the sequences in this region are likely to be responsible for the specificity of pairing observed between SNAREs.Overall, we have shown that several novel VAMP and syntaxin homologs are found in mammalian cells, displaying an intricate network of expression and localization patterns. Further work is needed to understand the full extent of these families and the specificity of the pairing between family members. Since many more SNARE homologs are available in the data base, it should soon be possible to understand the full repertoire of these molecules in mammalian genomes. By further characterization of their localization and pairing specificities, it should be possible to understand the logic which underlies the organization of membrane compartments in mammalian cells. The distribution and restriction of molecules to membrane compartments is an essential process of eukaryotic cells. Distinct organelles of the secretory pathway are synthesized and maintained by budding of transport vesicles from a donor compartment followed by fusion of these vesicles with an acceptor membrane (1Palade G. Science. 1975; 189: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2322) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms responsible for vesicle biogenesis, protein sorting, and membrane fusion are not yet fully understood. While yeast genetics,in vitro biochemistry, and studies of synaptic vesicles have identified many of the components essential for these processes (2Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar, 3Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 63-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 4Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 219-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), the full repertoire of important proteins and their mechanisms of action are yet to be determined. One particularly interesting issue is how a vesicle loaded with specific cargo recognizes the appropriate target. It is becoming clear that several independent mechanisms contribute to the specificity of vesicle trafficking, and it is the sum of these multiple layers of specificity that results in a process with high fidelity (5Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 893-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar).

Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2603) Google Scholar). This process has been extensively studied in the mammalian presynaptic nerve terminal, where formation of a heterotrimeric complex between the v-SNARE, VAMPs 1 or 2, and the t-SNAREs syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25 is thought to serve as a membrane recognition mechanism and may drive fusion of the lipid bilayers (8Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar, 9Lin R.C. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1087-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). These proteins have subsequently been found to be prototypic members of gene families that span species as well as membrane compartments (6Bennett M.K. Garcia-Arraras J.E. Elferink L.A. Peterson K. Fleming A.M. Hazuka C.D. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 863-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). For example, syntaxin homologs in yeast have been localized to the Golgi (Sed5p) (10Banfield D.K. Lewis M.U. Rabouille C. Warren G. Pelham H.R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), endosomes (Pep12p) (11Becherer K.A. Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. Jones E.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), lysosomes (Vam3p) (12Nichols B.J. Ungermann C. Pelham H.R. Wickner W.T. Haas A. Nature. 1997; 387: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), and the plasma membrane (Sso1p and Sso2p) (13Aalto M.K. Ronne H. Keranen S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4095-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). In particular, the SNAREs present on yeast vacuoles have been extensively characterized, and genetic manipulations support the idea that a v-SNARE and a t-SNARE are required on opposite membranes for efficient target recognition and membrane fusion (12Nichols B.J. Ungermann C. Pelham H.R. Wickner W.T. Haas A. Nature. 1997; 387: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Together these studies postulated that members of the syntaxin and VAMP families define membrane compartments and that specific pairing of these proteins represents a determinant of the specificity of vesicle trafficking. Thus studies to date have led to speculation that most, if not all, vesicle trafficking steps require a distinct v-t-SNARE complex. With the entire sequence of the yeast genome now known, all the syntaxin and VAMP family members that can be detected by sequence homology searches have been identified. However, the more complex intracellular architecture and multiple differentiated and specialized tissues of mammals relative to yeast would seemingly require the evolution of additional SNAREs. For example, while six syntaxins are present in the yeast genome, a recent search of the data base of mammalian expressed sequence tags (ESTs) proposed the presence of at least 16 mammalian syntaxins (14Bock J.B. Scheller R.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In order to fully understand the organization of membrane compartments in mammalian cells, it remains necessary to further characterize the spectrum of SNARE proteins. To this end, we have characterized seven new mammalian proteins that we propose to be SNAREs important in intracellular membrane trafficking. While some of the new SNAREs are widely expressed, others are enriched in specific tissues, suggesting an enhanced requirement for particular trafficking steps in those cells. The proteins are specifically localized to the Golgi"
https://openalex.org/W2071119634,"von Willebrand Factor (vWF) is a multimeric protein that mediates platelet adhesion to exposed subendothelium at sites of vascular injury under conditions of high flow/shear. The A1 domain of vWF (vWF-A1) forms the principal binding site for platelet glycoprotein Ib (GpIb), an interaction that is tightly regulated. We report here the crystal structure of the vWF-A1 domain at 2.3-Å resolution. As expected, the overall fold is similar to that of the vWF-A3 and integrin I domains. However, the structure also contains N- and C-terminal arms that wrap across the lower surface of the domain. Unlike the integrin I domains, vWF-A1 does not contain a metal ion-dependent adhesion site motif. Analysis of the available mutagenesis data suggests that the activator botrocetin binds to the right-hand face of the domain containing helices α5 and α6. Possible binding sites for GpIb are the front and upper surfaces of the domain. Natural mutations that lead to constitutive GpIb binding (von Willebrand type IIb disease) cluster in a different site, at the interface between the lower surface and the terminal arms, suggesting that they disrupt a regulatory region rather than forming part of the primary GpIb binding site. A possible pathway for propagating structural changes from the regulatory region to the ligand-binding surface is discussed. von Willebrand Factor (vWF) is a multimeric protein that mediates platelet adhesion to exposed subendothelium at sites of vascular injury under conditions of high flow/shear.

Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 217-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The adhesive properties of vWF are tightly regulated so that plasma vWF does not normally interact with circulating platelets. vWF, however, will bind to platelets after it is “activated” by poorly understood conformational changes that occur after it binds to the vessel wall. A reduction in the plasma concentration of vWF or mutations that impair binding, activation, or assembly of vWF multimers cause von Willebrand disease (vWD), a common bleeding disorder characterized by decreased platelet adhesion and mucocutaneous bleeding (2Sadler J.E. Matsushita T. Dong Z. Tuley E.A. Westfield L.A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). vWF-mediated adhesion of platelets to the vessel wall, under the high flow/shear conditions present in circulating blood, is mediated by sequences within the first (A1 domain) and third (A3 domain) A type repeats of vWF. The A1 domain (residues 479–717) binds to platelet glycoprotein Ib·IX·V complex (GpIb), subendothelial heparans, cell surface sulfatides (reviewed in Ref. 3Ruggeri Z.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and the non-fibrillar collagen type VI (4Hoylaerts M.F. Yamamoto H. Nuyts K. Vreys I. Deckmyn H. Vermylen J. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The vWF-A3 domain contains the principal site for binding the fibrillar collagens types I and III (5Sixma J.J. Schiphorst M.E. Verweij C.L. Pannekoek H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 6Cruz M.A. Yuan H. Jee J.R. Wise R.J. Handin R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10822-10827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Although initially noted in the primary sequence of vWF, the A domain has been subsequently discovered in a large number of cell matrix-associated or adhesive proteins and receptors (7Colombatti A. Bonaldo P. Doliana R. Matrix. 1993; 13: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). For example, varying numbers of A domains are found in several of the atypical, short chain collagens. A single A domain is inserted into the sequence of several integrin receptors, where it is generally referred to as the I domain. A/I domains are frequently involved in either cell adhesion or cell ligand interactions. In 1995, we reported the crystal structure of the first family member, the I domain of the leukocyte integrin αMβ2 (8Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar), and the crystal structures of several A domains have now been solved (9Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This work has provided new insights into how A domains mediate cellular adhesion and facilitates detailed structure-function studies. All A domains have a very similar structure comprising a variant of the dinucleotide-binding fold. The integrin I domains contain a metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) on the upper face of the domain that is an important element of ligand binding (8Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 13Rieu P. Sugimori T. Griffith D.L. Arnaout M.A. J. Biol.

In contrast, the vWF-A3 domain does not bind metal and does not require metal for binding to collagen (10Bienkowska J. Cruz M. Atiemo A. Handin R. Liddington R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25162-25167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To advance studies of vWF binding to platelet GpIb and to gain more understanding of the molecular switches that activate vWF, we have solved the crystal structure of the vWF-A1 domain and in this paper correlate its structure with existing biochemical and mutational data. Recombinant vWF-A1 containing residues 475–709 of mature vWF and 12 residues at the N terminus from the expression vector (MRGSHHHHHHGS) was expressed in Escherichia coli, refolded, and purified as follows. Our previously published technique (16Cruz M.A. Handin R.I. Wise R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21238-21245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to transform cells, induce protein, and harvest inclusion bodies. Next, the washed pellet was solubilized by the addition of 6.5 m guanidine hydrochloride in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The solubilized protein was diluted 40-fold in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20, pH 7.8. It was passed over an Ni2+-chelated Sepharose (Pharmacia) column equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl (pH 7.8) buffer. vWF-A1 protein eluted from the column with 350 mmimidazole. The isolated protein was absorbed to and eluted from a Heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The highly purified protein was dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.8. This protein failed to produce crystals suitable for x-ray analysis. The protein (0.4 mg/ml) was next treated with immobilized α-chymotrypsin (Sigma) in 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, 0.15m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 for 24 h at 4 °C with constant agitation, loaded onto a Heparin-Sepharose column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, 0.15 mNaCl, and then eluted with 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, 0.6m NaCl. Finally, the protein was diluted 3-fold with water and concentrated to 4 mg/ml. The molecular mass estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reduced from 27 to 24 kDa after chymotrypsin digestion. In the crystal structure (see below), the C terminus is ordered to within 4 residues of the C terminus of the expressed domain, and at the N terminus the first residue visible in the electron density map is Asp498. Chymotrypsin cleaves specifically after aromatic residues, and Tyr495 at the N terminus is the only aromatic residue that is not visible in the final electron density map. Cleavage after Tyr495 and the loss of 33 residues from the N terminus gives a predicted size of 24.5 kDa, consistent with the size estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Other aromatic residues are presumably protected from cleavage by the folded conformation of the domain. Cleavage did not detectably perturb vWF-A1 binding to GpIb or its ability to inhibit ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation by full-length vWF (data not shown). Crystals of the chymotrypsin-cleaved protein were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion using 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.5, 8% polyethylene glycol 8000. Larger crystals grew to dimensions 0.1 mm × 0.1 mm × 1.0 mm in the presence of 5 mm CdCl2and belong to the space group P61 with cell dimensions a = b = 86.4 Å, c = 68.1 Å, α = β = 90°, γ = 120°. The asymmetric unit contains one vWF-A1 domain and 57% solvent. A single crystal was transferred into a cryoprotectant buffer consisting of 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.5, 5% polyethylene glycol 8000, 30% glycerol, and frozen by immersion in a stream of nitrogen at 100 K. Data were collected with a Rigaku RU-200 x-ray generator, focusing mirrors, and an R-AXIS IV imaging plate. Data were reduced with DENZO (17Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Bailey S. Data Collection and Processing. SERC, Daresbury, UK1993: 59-62Google Scholar) and scaled with SCALEPACK (17Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Bailey S. Data Collection and Processing. SERC, Daresbury, UK1993: 59-62Google Scholar) with an Rmerge of 8.3% and 91% completeness to 2.3 Å resolution. Subsequent calculations were performed using the CCP4 suite of programs (18Collaborative Computational Project, No. 4 Acta Crystallogr. 1994; D50: 760-763Google Scholar) unless otherwise noted. A mercury derivative was prepared by soaking crystals in the cryoprotectant buffer plus 5 mm HgCl2 for 48 h. A 2.8-Å data set was collected from this derivative with an Rmerge of 13.4%, a mean isomorphous difference with the native data set of 26.7%, and 99.8% completeness. Molecular replacement was performed using the crystal structure of the integrin α2-I domain (11Emsley J. King S. Bergelson J. Liddington R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28512-28517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), stripped of loops and side chains, as the search model. The highest peak in the cross-rotation function gave the correct orientation of the monomer. The translation function gave a stronger top peak in space group P61 than in P65, establishing the correct enantiomorph. Rigid body refinement using XPLOR (19Brünger A.T. X-Plor Manual version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) led to an R factor of 52% and a correlation coefficient of 0.45. Using the mercury derivative data and model-derived phases, a difference Fourier revealed the position of two mercury atoms. These sites were refined using HEAVY (20Terwilliger T. Eisenberg D. Acta Crystallogr. 1983; A39: 813-817Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and phases were calculated using MLPHARE (phasing power = 0.41), leading to an experimental map that was solvent flattened using DM. The heavy atom-derived and molecular replacement-derived maps were then averaged using the program RAVE (21Kleywegt G. Jones T.A. Bailey S. Hubbard R. Waller D. From First Map to Final Model. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Daresbury, UK1994: 59-66Google Scholar). This averaged map was of higher quality than either of the component maps and was readily interpretable. An initial round of model building using program O (22Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjelgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. 1991; A47: 110-119Crossref Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) allowed insertion of 173 residues including some side chains. This model was subjected to positional refinement using XPLOR, resulting in an R factor (RWORK) of 42.3% for the working set and an RFREE (calculated on 10% of reflections omitted from refinement) of 47.2% at 2.8 Å resolution. Further rounds of positional and B-factor refinement, model building, and extension of the data to 2.3 Å resolution led to an RWORK of 24.3% and RFREE of 31.2%. An anomalous difference Fourier calculated at this stage revealed the presence of an anomalous scatterer (peak height, 4.6 ς), presumed to be Cd2+, coordinating histidines His559 and His563 in the βB-βC loop. Water molecules were next added at the positions of F o − F c peaks greater than 3 ς, where reasonable hydrogen-bonding partners existed. After applying a bulk solvent correction, the final R-factor was 19.2% for all data between 10 and 2.3 Å (RFREE = 23.8%); the model includes residues 498–705, 93 water molecules, and one Cd2+ ion. All main chain torsion angles lie within the most favored (88.8% of residues) or additional allowed regions (11.3% of residues) of the Ramachandran plot as defined in PROCHECK. There are no cis-prolines. The RMS deviations from ideal bond lengths and angles are 0.011 Å and 1.43°, respectively. We crystallized a recombinant vWF-A1 domain and solved its structure at 2.3 Å resolution (TableI). The overall fold is, as expected, very similar to the von Willebrand Factor A3 domain and the integrin I-domain, with a central hydrophobic parallel β-sheet flanked on two sides by amphipathic helices (Figs. 2 and 3). Helices are labeled 1–7 and strands A–F by homology with the αMβ2 I domain (8Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). There is no equivalent of the second helix, α2, found in the αM and αL I domains. The disulfide bridge linking the N- and C-proximal sequences (Cys509-Cys695) is well ordered. In addition, ordered structure extends 11 residues N-terminal to, and 10 residues C-terminal to, the disulfide bridge.Table ISummary of crystallographic analysisData collectionResolutionNo. of observations (completeness/redundancy)Rsym1-aRsym = Σ‖I − 〈I〉‖/ΣI, where I = observed intensity, 〈I〉 = average intensity from multiple observations of symmetry related reflections.

The overall shape is cuboid, with six fairly flat faces; four of these are shown in Fig. 4. (a) The “front” face lies at one edge of the β-sheet and includes side chains from helices α3 and α4, strand βC, and their connecting loops. This face also includes part of the salt-bridge network (see below). (b) The “upper” face lies at the C-terminal end of the β-sheet and is composed of loops connecting the sheet to the flanking helices. This face contains two positively charged residues, Arg524 and His656, packed together at the center of an otherwise polar but uncharged surface ∼20 Å in diameter, with charged groups at the periphery. In integrin I domains, this upper face contains the MIDAS motif, consisting of three closely apposed loops that together coordinate a magnesium ion. However, the homologous loops of vWF-A1 are not suitable for metal coordination. (c) The “lower” face includes the N- and C-terminal arms and the loops connecting the α-helices to the N-terminal end of the β-sheet. (d) The “right-hand” face includes helices α4, α5, and α6 flanking one side of the β-sheet, and is highly basic. (e) The “left-hand” face (not shown) includes helices α1, α3, and α7 flanking the opposite side of the β-sheet and is highly acidic. (f) The “back” face (not shown) includes helices α6, α7, and strand βF. The vWF-A1 domain contains a large number of charged amino acids. Some of these form an elaborate salt-bridge network that wraps around the lower rim of the domain (Fig. 4 a). These stabilizing salt bridges may explain the sensitivity of this region to alanine mutagenesis (23Matsushita T. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13406-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). There are four buried acidic residues: (a) Glu557 from strand βB forms stabilizing salt bridges with two histidine side chains (His559 and His563) from the βB-βC hairpin; (b) Glu626 is buried but sits at the N-terminal end of helix α4, where it may be stabilized by the helix dipole; (c) Asp514 at the bottom of strand βA is buried and is stabilized by salt bridges to Arg552 and Arg611, which form part of the salt-bridge network. A buried salt bridge between an aspartic acid from the bottom of strand βA and an arginine from the α4-βD turn is seen in all of the A/I domain structures that have been studied, suggesting that this is an important element of folding; (d) Asp520 is buried below the upper face of the domain without a stabilizing salt-bridge partner. This residue is homologous in sequence to the aspartic acid of the DxSxS integrin MIDAS motif; it has been suggested that the side chain of Arg524 might form a salt bridge with the buried aspartic acid, substituting for the metal ion, but our crystal structure shows that instead Arg524 points outward into solution, packing against the side chain of His656 from the βE-α6 loop. Upstream from the N-terminal strand, βA, the chain makes a 90° turn, with Cys509 three residues from the turning point. Further upstream, the side chains of Phe507, Tyr508, and Ile499 pack against hydrophobic elements on the surface of the domain, and His505 and Glu501 make stabilizing salt bridges with helices α1 and α3. At the C terminus, the α7 helix extends a turn beyond the disulfide bridge, followed by an extended structure that packs against the hydrophobic side of the domain as far as Ala701; in addition, Glu700 makes a salt bridge with Arg511 near the N terminus. Beyond this, a sequence of three prolines in an extended conformation protrudes downward from the body of the domain. Ordered electron density exists for all residues that have been identified as natural mutation sites leading to the type IIb phenotype (“gain of function,” constitutive binding to GpIb). All of these sites lie on the lower surface of the domain at the interface between the body of the domain and the N- and C-terminal arms (see TableII and Fig. 3). Our crystal structure shows that in the wild-type protein, these residues are all involved in salt bridges or hydrophobic packing. The most likely effect of these mutations is that they disrupt the interface between the N- and C-terminal arms and the body of the domain. Scanning mutagenesis has led to the identification of further mutants with a similar phenotype (23Matsushita T. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13406-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). These lie in the same region and include a triple-alanine mutation in the middle of the C-terminal helix (RDE687–689), which breaks salt-bridge contacts with helix α1 and the salt-bridge network. Mutations of Cys509 to Gly or Arg, which break the disulfide bridge, also lead to constitutive GpIb binding (24Siguret V. Ribba A.S. Christophe O. Cheret G. Obert B. Rouault C. Nishikubo T. Meyer D.

Extending the overlap to the entire domain gives an RMS deviation of 1.4 Å for 165 residues in equivalent structural environments, as defined in MULTIFIT (25May A.C.W. Johnson M.S. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The resulting alignment has 21% amino acid identity and is shown in Figs. 1 and2. The A3 crystal structure lacks the N- and C-terminal extensions found in A1, but the disulfide bridge is similarly located. The α helices are generally similar in length and orientation, with the major differences restricted to the loops connecting strands and helices on the upper and lower surfaces of the domain. vWF-A1 and vWF-A3 both lack the α2 helix found in the integrin αMβ2 and αLβ2 I domains. In A1, helix α7 is preceded by a turn of 310 helix, whereas in A3, the 310helix is replaced by an α helix that is longer by 3 residues. The surface charge distribution is less asymmetric in A3 than in A1, lacking the basic patch on the right-hand face of A1. The shape of the upper surface of the domain is affected by three changes in the surface loops. (a) At the top of the βA strand, arginine Arg524 in A1 points out into solution, whereas the equivalent A3 residue, Ser938, points inward. The side chain of the next residue, Leu525, points into the interior of the protein; homologous residues in the integrin I domains are similarly oriented. This contrasts with A3, in which Phe939 points out into solution. These two differences give the βA-α1 turn a quite different conformation in A1 than in A3. (b) There is a 1-residue insertion in the α3-α4 loop of A1, which wraps over the top of the βB-βC hairpin, allowing space for the side chain of His559 that replaces a glycine in A3. (c) A1 has a 4-residue insertion in the βD-α5 loop, which includes a turn of 310 helix. The lower surface is affected by the following changes: (i) in the βC-α3 loop, Leu568 packs more closely into the hydrophobic core than the larger tryptophan in A3, causing a shift of the entire loop; (ii) the end of helix α4 has a different conformation, and the α4-βD loop is two residues shorter in A1; (iii) The α6-βF turn adopts a different conformation. Using our crystal structure of the vWF-A1 domain, coupled with the analysis of naturally occurring and experimentally introduced mutations, we can begin to map the binding sites for GpIb and activators like botrocetin and ristocetin. In addition, with an understanding of the type IIb vWD “gain-of-function” mutations in relation to the ligand-binding surfaces, we can begin to formulate models of the activation process. Two groups have performed scanning mutagenesis on the A1 domain (23Matsushita T. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13406-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 26Kroner P.A. Frey A.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13460-13468Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) which can be used to help localize the binding sites for these activators. Matsushita and Sadler (23Matsushita T. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13406-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) measured the direct binding of botrocetin to vWF. Ignoring those mutations that involve buried charges and probably cause misfolding of the A1 domain, the remaining mutation sites leading to reduced (<50% normal) binding are located in helices α5 and α6 and adjoining structures: Arg636 in helix α5, Arg629 and Arg632 in the 310 helix immediately preceding α5, and RLIEK663–667 in the neighboring α6 helix. These data strongly suggest that botrocetin binds to the right-hand face of the domain (Figs.3 and 4). Mutation of the lysine cluster KKKK642–645 also reduced botrocetin binding (23Matsushita T. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13406-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), but Kroner and Frey (26Kroner P.A. Frey A.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13460-13468Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) report normal botrocetin-induced function for this mutant. Matsushita and Sadler (23Matsushita T. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13406-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) reported four mutants with a selective loss-of-function: loss of ristocetin-induced GpIb binding but normal botrocetin-induced binding. These map near to the upper face of the domain (Fig. 3) and consist mainly of buried (Glu626, Asp520) or partly buried charges (Lys534 salt bridges to Glu531). These mutations, which lead to a loss of stabilizing salt bridges, may cause local instability in the upper surface of the domain that disrupts GpIb binding. The natural mutant (Gly561 → Ser) has the same phenotype (27Rabinowitz I. Tuley E.A. Mancuso D.J. Randi A.M. Firkin B.G. Howard M.A. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9846-9849Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Gly561 is part of the tight βB-βC turn at the upper front/edge of the domain. Its main chain torsion angles are not unusual, and modeling suggests that the mutant side chain can point out into solution without severe distortion of the main chain. The ability of botrocetin to overcome the binding deficiency in these mutants may arise from the stabilizing effect of its tight binding to an adjacent surface of the A1 domain. Kroner and Frey (26Kroner P.A. Frey A.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13460-13468Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) reported three further mutations with the same phenotype, in the region of the type IIb mutations and the lysine cluster KKKK642–645, adjacent to the N- and C-terminal arms. The arms contain proline-rich segments that have been implicated in ristocetin binding (28Scott J.P. Montgomery R.R. Retzinger G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8149-8155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that selective loss-of-function in these mutants arises from defective ristocetin binding. Data from various sources, when linked together, provide some clues to the location and extent of the GpIb interaction site within the A1 domain. First, previously reported studies from our laboratory on the functional properties of a vWF-A1/A3 chimera that contains the N-terminal half of vWF-A1 (as far as Leu598 in the middle of helix α4), but still binds GpIb normally (6Cruz M.A. Yuan H. Jee J.R. Wise R.J. Handin R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10822-10827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), strongly suggest a role for the front half of the domain. Second, the majority of mutations that lead to a selective loss-of-function (described above) cluster at or near the upper/front surface of the domain, in contrast to the gain-of-function mutants, which cluster on the lower surface (see below). Third, Matsushita and Sadler reported that the double alanine mutation at Glu596 and Lys599 on the front surface (helix α4) showed reduced GpIb binding (without affecting botrocetin binding) and suggested that it might form part of the GpIb binding site. Two further natural mutations (Type IIm) with impaired GpIb binding lie in helix α4 and the following loop, but both residues (Phe606 and Arg611) are buried in our crystal structure and the mutations probably lead to destabilization of the folded structure. Overall, the data point to a role for the upper/front surfaces of the domain in GpIb binding, but further work is clearly required to confirm this location. The vWD type IIb mutations, which lead to constitutive binding of vWF to GpIb, are all located at or near the interface between the lower surface of the domain and the N- and C-terminal arms (Fig. 3), and the mutations are expected to break salt bridges and hydrophobic contacts that stabilize this interface. Because these are so numerous, are “gain-of-function,” and map to both sides of the interface, it is very unlikely that this region forms a binding surface for GpIb; rather, it is more likely to be involved in the regulation of binding affinity. The separation between this region and the most likely GpIb binding surface begs the question of how structural changes are communicated between the two sites. A possible clue comes from studies on the homologous integrin I domain. Whereas ligand binding sites have been shown to lie on the upper surface of the domain, Zhang and Plow (29Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29953-29957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) have made αM/αL I domains chimeras, in which the swapping of sequences in the lower surface of the domain (at sites homologous to the type IIb mutations in vWF-A1) leads to constitutive high affinity ligand binding. A plausible pathway for communicating structural changes from one face of the I domain to the opposite face is provided by the two crystal structures of the integrin αM I domain observed by Lee et al. (30Lee J.-O. Bankston L.A. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Structure. 1995; 3: 1333-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In these structures, a change in the shape and charge distribution of the upper ligand-binding face that would influence its affinity for ligand is propagated via a large (10 Å) downward shift of the C-terminal helix, α7, to the lower face of the domain. The more extended conformation of the domain was identified with the high affinity state. Although we have no evidence for such a conformational change in the vWF-A1 domain, we note that several type IIb mutations map either to the C-terminal helix or to a residue that salt-bridges to the helix (Table II). We expect that these mutations disrupt salt bridges and hydrophobic interactions that lock the helix against the body of the domain. Although the N and C termini remain linked by a disulfide bridge in type IIb vWD, a substantial downward shift of the C-terminal helix is theoretically possible, requiring a concerted movement of the N-terminal arm. Thus, by destabilizing the folded conformation of the terminal arms, the type IIb mutations could shift the equilibrium toward the extended conformation. A conformational switch of this kind, in which the high affinity state is identified with a more extended conformation of the A1 domain, could be triggered when high flow/shear unfolds immobilized vWF (31Siedlecki C.A.

Mutation of this Arg in the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor to Gln, His, or Lys abolished or severely impaired agonist-stimulated inositol phosphate generation, consistent with Arg having a role in receptor activation. To investigate the contribution of the surrounding structural domain in the actions of the conserved Arg, an integrated microdomain modeling and mutagenesis approach has been utilized.

In the inactive wild-type receptor, the Arg side chain is proposed to form an ionic interaction with Asp3.49(138).

With activation, the Asp3.49(138)-Arg3.50(139) ionic bond would break, and the unrestrained Arg would be prevented from orienting itself toward the water phase by a steric clash with Ile3.54(143).

These heptahelical proteins include the visual opsins and various receptors for neurotransmitters, peptides, and glycoproteins. Activation of these receptors by their diverse agonists is associated with conformational changes in the receptor that facilitate a signal-propagating interaction with G-proteins (3Gudermann T. Schoneberg T. Schultz G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 399-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). These conformational changes can involve relative movement of helices, as reported for rhodopsin (4Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G.

Snyder L.A. Schuster D.I. Brosius J. Sealfon S.C. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Transitions among receptor conformations may reflect dynamic changes in side chain interactions within the receptor. Two of these conserved residues have been studied by reciprocal mutation in the GnRH and serotonin receptors, and the results suggest that the TMD 2 and 7 side chains have an interdependent role in receptor activation (8Sealfon S.C.

Most likely several other conserved side chains also interact to form the skeleton required for the conformational rearrangements that accompany the transition between inactive and active receptor states.The elucidation of the intramolecular interactions and conformational changes underlying receptor activation is hindered by the absence of high resolution structural data for any GPCR. The available low resolution projection maps of rhodopsin do not allow inferences about specific side chain interactions (10Schertler G.F. Villa C. Henderson R. Nature. 1993; 362: 770-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 11Schertler G.F. Hargrave P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11578-11582Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). A prevalent approach to investigate structure-function relations of GPCRs is to introduce structural perturbations via site-directed mutagenesis and to evaluate their effect on receptor phenotype in binding and signal transduction assays (12Baldwin J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). However, determining the phenotype of mutant receptors does not lead to an unequivocal interpretation concerning the structural basis of that phenotype (13Sealfon S.C. Zhou W. Almaula N. Rodic V. Methods Neurosci. 1996; 29: 143-196Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar).Molecular modeling has facilitated the integration of experimental observations and biophysical data into a mechanistic scheme for receptor structure and function (12Baldwin J.M.

Res. 1997; 17: 57-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) have been simulated in such models. The receptor models can thus provide a rationalization of current experimental data within a structural framework in which to explore the mechanisms underlying the functional perturbations induced by activation. However, caveats concerning the computational approaches arise from the complexity of these structures and the relative paucity of pertinent experimental data at atomic detail. Not surprisingly, given a limited number of experimentally determined constraints, the proposed models may exhibit inconsistent interaction patterns. In addition, GPCR models usually are not studied in the appropriate aqueous/membrane interface environment, making it less likely that the key side chain interactions are modeled accurately, especially those involving side chains near or separated by this interface.To overcome the limitations inherent in both site-directed mutagenesis and computational modeling, we have integrated mutational studies and the application of computational techniques to the study of structural motifs in the receptor that may constitute functional microdomains. The inferences from studies of these microdomains, whose proposed structure can be substantiated by experimental data, are then evaluated in the context of a whole receptor model. This approach facilitates the elucidation of a structural basis for the phenotypes induced by site-directed mutagenesis. The effect of mutations is tested first in the microdomain models and correlated with the functional effects of site-directed mutant receptors expressed in mammalian cells. Using this approach, we have recently mapped precise interactions in segments of the binding pocket of the serotonin 5HT2A receptor (19Almaula N. Ebersole B.J. Zhang D. Weinstein H. Sealfon S.C. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14672-14675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).In the present report, we have applied this approach to study the interaction pattern of the conserved Arg in TMD 3 in the GnRH receptor. The conserved arginine Arg3.50 (see “Experimental Procedures” for locus numbering scheme) has been implicated in the activation of various GPCRs by mutagenesis studies (20Min K.C. Zvyaga T.A.

An understanding of the molecular basis for the functional role of this Arg requires identification of those residues whose specific interactions determine its orientation within the structure of the receptor. Given the great conformational flexibility of the Arg side chain, it is likely that such orienting residues would form a three-dimensional motif to which we refer as the arginine cage.Specific partners for Arg3.50 have been proposed, such as the conserved Asp in TMD 2 (Asp2.50) (21Scheer A. Fanelli F. Costa T. De Benedetti P.G. Cotecchia S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3566-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 22Oliveira L. Paiva A.C.M. Sander C. Vriend G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 15: 170-172Scopus (127) Google Scholar), based on the rationale of a similar conservation pattern and the need to neutralize a positive charge in a low dielectric environment. However, a complete exploration of the conformational space of Arg3.50 in the context of a full molecular model of the receptor is not attainable with present computational techniques, and several other candidate interacting residues can be proposed. In particular, analysis of the conservation pattern centered on Arg3.50 identifies highly conserved residues that could influence the conformation of Arg3.50. These residues form the consensus sequence (I/L)XXDRYXX(I/V) (Fig. 1). Arg3.50, Asp/Glu3.49, and Ile/Val3.54 are present in all cloned GPCRs belonging to the rhodopsin family, with the exception of the platelet-activating factor receptor, which has an asparagine residue at position 3.49 (23Honda Z.

In an α-helical environment, the conservation pattern described above forms an envelope of conserved residues surrounding Arg3.50, consisting in the GnRH receptor of Ile3.46(135), Asp3.49(138), and Ile3.54(143) (Fig. 2).Figure 2Spatial proximity between the conserved Arg3.50(139)) and the conserved residues surrounding it in TMD 3.

Guarnieri F. Perlman J.H. Gershengorn M.C. Osman R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7651-7663Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The helical structure and the helix ends of TMD 3 have been experimentally substantiated by Cys scanning of the D2 receptor (24Javitch J.A. Fu D. Chen J. Karlin A. Neuron. 1995; 14: 825-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and by spin-labeling studies of rhodopsin, in which the membrane/aqueous interface has been located between residues 3.52 and 3.53 (25Farahbakhsh Z.T. Ridge K.D. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8812-8819Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). For the Monte Carlo simulations, a novel biphasic solvent model has been developed that reproduces the interface between the interior of a protein and a water environment. 2F. Guarnieri, manuscript in preparation. 2F. Guarnieri, manuscript in preparation. Using this Monte Carlo approach, the inferences about the possible caging interactions involving the conserved Arg have been tested by evaluating computationally the structural effects of mutations in this TMD 3 domain model and correlating these results with the functional effects of site-directed mutagenesis. These studies provide insight into the role of Arg3.50(139) in sustaining a pattern of interactions that may occur in the active and inactive forms of the receptor.RESULTSComputational Simulations of TMD 3 Segment Surrounding Arg3.50(139)The GPCRs demonstrate a pattern of conservation among several residues that are in spatial proximity to Arg3.50(139) when the cytoplasmic side of TMD 3 is modeled as a regular α-helix (see Fig. 2). These potential local sites of interaction for Arg3.50 include the large hydrophobic residue (Ile/Val/Leu) at position 3.46, the acidic residue at position 3.49, the Tyr (Ser in the GnRH receptor) at position 3.51, and the β-branched large hydrophobic residue (Ile/Val) at position 3.54.The interaction patterns and rotamer positioning of Arg3.50(139) with respect to these neighboring TMD 3 residues were explored with Monte Carlo simulations for the wild-type helix and for various mutant receptors. Many conformations of the flexible Arg side chain were not attainable due to steric clashes with the helix backbone. For example, all Arg rotamers whose χ1 = g− are unpopulated because of a clash between the Arg γ-methyl and the backbone carbonyl from the preceding turn of the helix (30McGregor M.J. Islam S.A. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 295-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar).The most striking observation to emerge from the simulations is the tendency for Arg3.50(159) to form an ionic bond with Asp3.49(138), as illustrated in Fig. 2 B. Nearly half of the Arg3.50(139) rotamers observed were bound to this aspartic acid (Table I). As shown in Fig. 3, a variety of Arg conformations were identified that form the Arg-Asp interaction. Most other side chains remained in their original orientations throughout the simulations, consistent with their preferred rotamer populations in known α-helical structures. Ser and Thr residues were overwhelmingly (92–99% of rotamers) in the χ1 = g+ conformation due to H-bonding to the backbone carbonyl of the preceding turn (30McGregor M.J. Islam S.A. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 295-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar,31Gray T.M. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 175: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). β-Branched residues (Val, Ile, Thr), except Ile3.54(143), were constrained to one single χ1 population (83–99% of rotamers) due to clashes with the helix backbone (30McGregor M.J. Islam S.A. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 295-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The structural effects of several mutations of the residues surrounding Arg3.50(139) were studied computationally:Table IPreferred conformations of the Arg3.50(139) side chain-based rotamer populations for the wild-type and Asp3.49(138) -modified receptor by mutation (Asp3.49(138) → Asn) or protonation (Asp3.49(138) → Asp-H)Orientation of Arg3.50 side chainMode of stabilizationDihedral angles of Arg3.50 side chainRotamer populationsχ1χ2χ3χ4Wild typeAsp3.49AsnAsp3.49Asn-HLocus 3.49salt bridgeg+g+g−t11.90.00.0Locus 3.49salt bridgeg+g−tt11.10.01.0Locus 3.49salt bridgetg−g+g−6.32.80.0Locus 3.49salt bridgetg−g−g+7.90.05.1Locus 3.49salt bridgetg−g−t8.30.16.5 Total rotamer populations with side chain of residue Arg3.50 oriented toward locus 3.4945.52.912.6Locus 3.51H-bondttg−g+0.57.05.9Locus 3.51H-bondtttg+0.03.211.6Locus 3.51H-bondttg−t0.012.910.3Locus 3.51H-bondttg−g−0.014.013.8 Total rotamer populations with side chain of residue Arg3.50 oriented toward locus 3.510.537.141.6Locus 3.54H2O solvationtg−tg+0.07.50.5Locus 3.54H2O solvationtg−tt3.221.06.6Locus 3.54H2O solvationtg−tg−0.90.95.8 Total rotamer populations with side chain of residue Arg3.50 oriented toward locus 3.544.129.412.9 Open table in a new tab Figure 3Wild-type R3.50(139) orientations.

Although Ile is most commonly found at this site, Leu or Met also occur in different receptors. For the simulations, we substituted Ile3.46(135) with Ala, Val, and Leu to test 1) the functional relevance of the wild-type side chain (by substituting Ala), 2) the role of the β-branched character of the residue (by substituting Val), and 3) the effect of the large hydrophobic side chain (by substituting Leu). Monte Carlo simulations of all three mutant constructs showed that the conformational preferences of the Arg side chain were similar to those found in the wild-type receptor. Therefore, according to our results, Ile3.46(135) does not modulate the orientation of Arg3.50(139).Asp3.49(138)Monte Carlo simulations were performed for a mutation of the conserved acidic residue to Asn. By neutralizing the charge at this locus, this Asp3.49(138)→ Asn mutant would weaken the ionic bond between Arg3.50(139) and Asp3.49(138) observed in simulations of the wild-type receptor. This mutation was found to significantly affect the conformational preferences of the Arg side chain (see Table I). In the Asp3.49(138) → Asn mutant, the Arg side chain rarely interacts with the 3.49 locus (3% of rotamers). Two new orientations appear populated, as shown in Fig. 4. 1) Arg3.50(139) is oriented toward positions 3.47–3.51 where it can H-bond to Ser3.47(136) and Ser3.51(140) (37% of rotamers). 2) Arg3.50(139) is oriented toward positions 3.53–3.54 where it can be solvated by water at the cytoplasmic boundaries. Because activation of rhodopsin has been shown to involve a proton uptake by Glu3.49 (32Arnis S. Fahmy K. Hofmann K.P. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23879-23881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Cohen G.B. Yang T. Robinson P.R. Oprian D.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6111-6115Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), simulations were also performed for the protonated form of the aspartic acid, termed Asp3.49(138) → Asp-H. The results yielded a pattern of preferred conformations very similar to that of Asp3.49(138) → Asn (TableII).Figure 4Arg3.50(139) orientations in the D3.49(138)N mutant.

Conserved residues are highlighted by thicker bonds. Note that all the populated rotamer conformations are oriented away from Asn3.49(138). Instead, Arg3.50(139) is oriented either toward Ser3.51(140)-Ser3.47(136) (37.1%), where it can H-bond to the Ser residues, or toward the cytoplasm at the level of Ile3.54(143)-Ala3.53(142) (29.4%), where it would be solvated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IIPreferred conformations of the Arg3.50(139) side chain based on rotamer populations for the wild-type and Ile3.54(143) mutants to Ala, Leu, and ValOrientation of Arg3.50 side chainMode of stabilizationDihedral angles of Arg3.50 side chainRotamer populationsχ1χ2χ3χ4Wild typeIle3.54AlaIle3.54LeuIle3.54ValLocus 3.49salt bridgeg+g+g+t2.96.84.16.3Locus 3.49salt bridgeg+g+tg+3.618.97.33.3Locus 3.49salt bridgeg+g+tt3.59.97.65.6Locus 3.49salt bridgeg+g+g−t11.92.84.73.2Locus 3.49salt bridgeg+g−g+t1.40.06.90.5Locus 3.49salt bridgeg+g−tt11.15.83.35.5Locus 3.49salt bridgeg+g−tg−0.20.55.21.2Locus 3.49salt bridgetg−g+g+3.82.34.26.7Locus 3.49salt bridgetg−g+t4.30.98.46.5Locus 3.49salt bridgetg−g+g−6.33.15.54.5Locus 3.49salt bridgetg−g−g+7.912.519.515.5Locus 3.49salt bridgetg−g−t8.33.03.716.4 Total rotamer populations with side chain of residue Arg3.50 oriented toward locus 3.4965.266.580.475.2Locus 3.54H2O solvationtg−tg+0.012.70.00.0Locus 3.54H2O solvationtg−tt3.21.63.15.3 Total rotamer populations with side chain of residue Arg3.50 oriented toward locus 3.543.214.33.15.3 Open table in a new tab Ser3.51(140)A Tyr residue most commonly occurs at this position in other GPCRs. We tested the functional role of this residue with the mutant construct Ser3.51(140) → Ala. Hydrogen-bonding between Arg3.50(139) and Ser3.51(140) was observed in the Asp3.49(138)→ Asn mutant receptor, but the mutation Ser3.51(140) → Ala did not change significantly the orientation of the Arg side chain relative to the wild-type construct (data not shown). Evidently, this H-bond is not energetically competitive with the ionic bond Arg3.50(139)-Asp3.49(138).Ile3.54(143)Only Ile or Val residues appear in GPCR sequences at this position. Therefore, this locus always contains a bulky β-branched, hydrophobic side chain. To test the structural implications of these properties, we substituted this residue by Val, Leu, and Ala. The Val side chain displays similar structural features as isoleucine, being hydrophobic, bulky, and β-branched. Leu is hydrophobic and bulky but has a γ-branched side chain. Ala is hydrophobic but neither bulky nor branched. Analysis of all rotamers populated over 5%, shown in Table II, indicates that the prevailing interaction for the wild-type receptor and the three mutants is still the ionic bond between Arg3.50(139) and Asp3.49(138) (65–80% of rotamers). Although maintaining the same interaction, the individual rotamer conformations preferred for this interaction vary among the mutants and with respect to the wild-type receptor (Table II). Of note, a novel orientation for the Arg side chain toward residues 3.53–3.54 appears significantly populated in the Ile3.54(143) → Ala mutant (14.3%) but not in the wild-type, Ile3.54(143) → Val, or Ile3.54(143) → Leu mutants. In the Ile3.54(143) → Ala mutant, the Arg side chain can be positioned toward the aqueous cytoplasm, as illustrated in Fig. 5.Figure 5R3.50(139) orientations in the I3.54(143)A construct.

Conserved residues are highlighted by thicker bonds. Most of the populated rotamer conformations are oriented toward Asp3.49(138), as observed for the wild-type (Fig. 4), driven by an ionic bond between Arg3.50(139) and Asp3.49(138).

The mutation of the Asp3.49(138), Arg3.50(139), and Ser3.51(140) loci were carried out on the mouse GnRH receptor, whereas the Ile3.46(135) and Ile3.54(143) mutants were generated in the human GnRH receptor. Both human and mouse GnRH receptors have identical sequences in the TMD 3 segment studied. The amino acid substitutions were designed to test the side chain property conserved at each locus and/or a specific functional hypothesis derived from the modeling studies.

Substitution by another β-branched residue Ile3.46(135) → Val also eliminated detectable ligand binding and signal transduction. In contrast, the Ile3.46(135) → Leu receptor manifested coupling comparable to that of the wild-type receptor. However, due to poor expression of the Ile3.46(135) → Leu receptor (13% of wild-type receptor B max), the calculated value for receptor efficiency for this mutant reveals a 5-fold increase above the value obtained for the wild-type receptor (Table III). The affinity of this mutant construct for GnRH is comparable to the wild-type receptor. The restricted pattern of amino acid substitutions that are functionally tolerated at the 3.46(135) position is most consistent with this site being involved in helix-helix packing (see “Discussion”).Asp3.49(138)The Asp3.49(138) → Ala mutant had no detectable agonist binding or activation and could not be evaluated.

https://openalex.org/W2022786966,"Protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are signal transduction enzymes that catalyze the dephosphorylation of phosphotyrosine residues via the formation of a transient cysteinyl-phosphate intermediate. The mechanism of hydrolysis of this intermediate has been examined by generating a Gln-262 → Ala mutant of PTP1B, which allows the accumulation and trapping of the intermediate within a PTP1B crystal. The structure of the intermediate at 2.5-Å resolution reveals that a conformationally flexible loop (the WPD loop) is closed over the entrance to the catalytic site, sequestering the phosphocysteine intermediate and catalytic site water molecules and preventing nonspecific phosphoryltransfer reactions to extraneous phosphoryl acceptors. One of the catalytic site water molecules, the likely nucleophile, forms a hydrogen bond to the putative catalytic base, Asp-181. In the wild-type enzyme, the nucleophilic water molecule would be coordinated by the side chain of Gln-262. In combination with our previous structural data, we can now visualize each of the reaction steps of the PTP catalytic pathway. The hydrolysis of the cysteinyl-phosphate intermediate of PTPs is reminiscent of GTP hydrolysis by the GTPases, in that both families of enzymes utilize an invariant Gln residue to coordinate the attacking nucleophilic water molecule.

The formation of phosphoryl-enzyme intermediates is an essential component of numerous enzymatic mechanisms that involve phosphoryl-transfer reactions, for example the dephosphorylation of Tyr(P) residues catalyzed by protein-tyrosine phosphatases (1Denu J.M. Stuckey J.A. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Cell. 1996; 87: 361-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). PTPs 1The abbreviations used are: PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; BisTris, bis(2-hydroxyethyl)iminotris(hydroxymethyl)methane; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; DSP, dual specificity phosphatase; p-NPP,para-nitrophenol phosphate; RPTP, receptor-like PTP. together with the protein-tyrosine kinases, which catalyze the opposing tyrosine phosphorylation reaction, control the overall levels of cellular tyrosine phosphorylation, and the molecular basis of the regulation and substrate specificity of these enzymes is subject to much investigation (2Hunter T.

Reversible tyrosine phosphorylation is essential to the signal transduction pathways triggered by hormones, mitogens, and oncogenes that regulate such processes as cell growth, differentiation, and proliferation. The PTPs are a diverse family of enzymes that comprise transmembrane receptor-like PTPs (RPTPs) and soluble cytosolic proteins. The catalytic domains of the PTPs are highly conserved, consisting of ∼250 amino acids and are characterized by an 11-residue PTP signature motif, (I/V)HCXAGXXR(S/T)G, containing the Cys and Arg residues that are essential for catalysis (4Barford D.

Sci. 1996; 21: 413-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Diversity within the family is generated by the nature of the non-catalytic segments attached to the N and C termini of the PTP domains, which provide regulatory and subcellular targeting functions. Additional diversity is generated within the RPTPs, which frequently possess tandem PTP domains, although for some RPTPs such as CD45, the C-terminal PTP domain lacks catalytic activity (3Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). The dual specificity phosphatases (DSPs) are related to the PTPs by their possession of the PTP signature motif and related tertiary structure and catalytic mechanism (1Denu J.M. Stuckey J.A.

Insights into the catalytic mechanism of PTPs and DSPs have been obtained from structural and kinetic studies of these enzymes (1Denu J.M. Stuckey J.A. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E.

A PTP1B-phosphotyrosine peptide complex revealed that the Tyr(P) residue of the peptide is buried within a deep catalytic site cleft present on the protein's molecular surface. The base of the catalytic site is formed by residues of the PTP signature motif with the phosphate group of Tyr(P) being coordinated by main-chain amide groups and the Arg side chain of this motif, such that the phosphorus atom is situated adjacent to the Sγ atom of the catalytic Cys residue (7Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Four other loops bearing invariant residues form the sides of the catalytic cleft and contribute to catalysis and substrate recognition. Engagement of phosphopeptides by PTP1B promotes a major conformational change of one of these loops (the WPD loop) consisting of residues 179–187 that shift by as much as 8 Å to close over the phenyl ring of Tyr(P) and allow the side chain of Asp-181 to act as a general acid in the catalytic reaction. The Arg-221 side chain reorients to optimize salt bridge interactions with the phosphate bound to the catalytic site. This shift is coupled to motion of the WPD loop via a hydrogen bond between NH2 of Arg-221 and the carbonyl oxygen of Pro-180 and hydrophobic interactions between the aliphatic moiety of Arg-221 and the side chain of Trp-179. These interactions and the hydrophobic packing between Phe-182 and the phenyl ring of Tyr(P) stabilize the closed, catalytically competent conformation of the loop. The phosphotyrosine dephosphorylation reaction commences with nucleophilic attack by the Sγ atom of the catalytic cysteine on the Tyr(P) phosphorus atom. Cleavage of the scissile P–O bond is facilitated by protonation of the phenolic oxygen by Asp-181 with the consequent formation of a phosphocysteine intermediate. The tyrosine residue diffuses out of the catalytic site and subsequently the transient phosphoryl-enzyme intermediate is hydrolyzed by an activated water molecule. The structure of a PTP1B·WO4 complex suggests that after hydrolysis of the phosphoryl-enzyme intermediate, the WPD loop opens, allowing product release (8Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K.

Cysteinyl-phosphate intermediates have been trapped by rapid denaturation of PTPs and a DSP (vaccinia H1-related) during catalytic turnover (9Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

Moreover, substitution of the catalytic Cys residue for a serine abolishes catalytic activity and the formation of an enzyme intermediate (9Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17026-17030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nucleophilicity of the Cys residue results from its close proximity to main-chain amide groups and a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Ser-222 of the PTP signature motif, resulting in an unusually low p K a of 4.6 (12Zhang Z.-Y. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9340-9345Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The catalytic Asp residue (Asp-181 of PTP1B) contributes to the basic limb of the pH activity profile, and its substitution to Ala causes a 105-fold reduction in k cat, suggestive of a role as an acid catalyst (13Flint A.J.

A. 1994; 91: 1624-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). These results imply that Asp-181 is necessary for the first step of the reaction, namely cleavage of the Tyr(P) P–O bond and intermediate formation, a notion consistent with the finding that Asp-181 mutants of PTP1B allow phosphorylated substrates to form stable complexes with the enzyme in vivo (14Zhang Z.-Y. Wang Y. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1624-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). An understanding of the chemical steps of the phosphocysteine dephosphorylation reaction has been more elusive, mainly because of the transient character of this intermediate as PTPs are efficient catalysts. For example, PTP1B hydrolyzes 40 molecules of substrate(s)/s at 25 °C (13Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 14Zhang Z.-Y. Wang Y. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1624-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Of particular interest are the structure of the cysteinyl-phosphate PTP intermediate, the mechanism of activation of the nucleophilic water molecule responsible for the hydrolysis of the intermediate, and mechanisms by which nonspecific phosphoryl-transfer reactions are prevented. The phosphoryl transfer reaction to a water molecule catalyzed by PTPs is highly specific, as PTPs are unable to phosphorylate a range of primary alcohols and other phosphate acceptors (15Zhao Wu, L. Noh S.J. Guan K.-L. Zhang Z.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5484-5492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Here, we describe an approach to obtain structural information on the cysteinyl-phosphate intermediate of PTP1B. The structure of a PTP1B-orthovanadate complex, which revealed that vanadate mimics the pentavalent phosphorus transition state intermediate, indicated that Gln-262 may play an important role in stabilizing and/or activating a nucleophilic water molecule for attack on the cysteinyl-phosphate intermediate. By replacing Gln-262 with Ala, we have prolonged the life-time of the cysteinyl-phosphate intermediate, allowing us to trap and visualize it using x-ray cryocrystallography. The structure (i) reveals that the WPD loop adopts a closed conformation that sequesters both the cysteinyl-phosphate residue and the nucleophilic water molecule, (ii) suggests roles for Asp-181 and Gln-262 in catalyzing the enzyme dephosphorylation reaction, and (iii) explains why phosphoryl transfer from the intermediate occurs to water molecules and not to other phosphoryl acceptors. The role of a Gln residue in catalyzing the hydrolysis of the cysteinyl-phosphate intermediate of PTPs is reminiscent of that performed by the Gln residue in GTP hydrolysis at the catalytic site of GTPases (16Coleman D.E.

The approach that we describe here to trap the phosphoryl-enzyme intermediate of PTP1B may have general applicability to other transient covalent-enzyme intermediates and enzyme-substrate complexes that will allow their isolation and structural characterization. Wild-type protein and the Q262A mutant PTP1B protein and crystals were prepared as described (20Barford D. Keller J.C. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The PTP1B-vanadate complex was prepared by incubating wild-type PTP1B crystals in 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 200 mmmagnesium acetate, 18% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, and 1 mm sodium orthovandate for 10 min prior to transfer to the same buffer with 25% (v/v) glycerol and freezing in a nitrogen gas stream at 100 K (22Brunger A.T. X-PLOR: Version 3.1; A System for Protein Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). To prepare crystals of the PTP1B-cysteinyl-phosphate complex, Q262A mutant crystals that had been grown at pH 7.5 were incubated for 5 min in a buffer of 100 mm BisTris (pH 7.0), 200 mm magnesium acetate, 18% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 and subsequently for another 5 min in the same buffer at pH 6.5. To prepare for cryofreezing and for trapping the intermediate, crystals were incubated in this buffer with 5% and then 10% (v/v) methyl-pentanediol each for 5 min before being transferred to 3 ml of 100 mm BisTris (pH 6.5), 200 mm magnesium acetate, 18% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 25 mm para-nitrophenol phosphate, 15% (v/v) methyl-pentanediol for 12 min. At this time, crystals were mounted directly into nylon loops and frozen. Data for the intermediate crystal were collected using a MAR 30-cm detector mounted on a Rigaku x-ray generator, and data for the orthovanadate crystal were also collected using a MAR 30-cm detector but on PX 9.6 at the Synchrotron Radiation Source, Daresbury Laboratory. Both data sets were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (21Otwinoski, Z., Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend, Wolf, W., Evans, P. R., Leslie, A. G.

Open table in a new tab Initial phases were derived from the 2.2-Å structure of PTP1B in an unliganded form to minimize model bias. In this structure, no ligands were bound at the catalytic site and the WPD loop adopts the open conformation. 2F o −F c and F o −F c OMIT maps (without orthovanadate in the model) were calculated after 75 cycles of rigid body refinement, and these maps demonstrated density for the vanadate ion at the catalytic site, a shift in the position of the WPD loop by 8 Å from the open to the closed conformation, and a rotation of the Arg-221 side chain from an all-trans to a cis conformation, indicative of ligand binding. The model was subjected to 100 cycles of positional refinement, after which the coordinates for the WPD loop and Arg-221 side chain were rebuilt into the difference electron density. This model was then subjected to simulated annealing with an initial temperature of 2500 K. A model for the orthovanadate ion was then constructed using perfect trigonal bipyramidal geometry and V–O bond lengths of 1.61 Å. The ion was built into the difference density and allowed to refine freely as a rigid body with interactions to the protein turned off. The ion refined to a position 2.4 Å away from the Cys-215 Sγ atom, consistent with the formation of a covalent bond between the vanadium and Cys-215 Sγ atoms, and a bond of this length was included in subsequent refinement. The model was then subjected to further rounds of positional refinement and 15 cycles of individual isotropic B-factor refinement. The bond length between the vanadium and Cys-215 Sγ atom refined to a value of 2.4 Å both in the presence (at 200 kcal·mol−1) and absence of bond length constraints. This value is similar to that reported by Denu et al. (25Denu J.M. Lohse D.L. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2493-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) in their crystal structure of the Yersinia PTP-vanadate complex. Water molecules were added manually with criteria for addition being F o − F c density at 3ς, 2F o − F c density at 1ς, a favorable hydrogen bonding environment, and a decrease in both the free and working R-factors after each cycle. The model was then subjected to 50 cycles of positional refinement and 15 cycles of B-factor refinement. Simulated annealing OMIT maps were calculated after performing a simulated annealing refinement run (at 2000 K) using the refined protein and water coordinates and in the absence of the vanadate coordinates. The final model satisfied or exceeded all the stereochemical quality indicators of PROCHECK (26Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19767) Google Scholar). Initial phases were also calculated from the 2.2-Å structure of unliganded PTP1B. The model was subjected to 75 cycles of rigid body and 100 cycles of positional refinement, and 2F o − F c and F o − F c OMIT maps (without intermediate) were calculated. The F o −F c difference map showed a 3ς peak adjacent to the Cys-215 Sγ atom and contiguous 2F o −F c density extending from the sulfur atom and enveloping the difference density (Fig. 3 A). The maps also showed movement of the WPD loop by 8 Å to the closed conformation and a rotation of the Arg-221 side chain. Negative difference density was also seen on the side chain of Gln-262 confirming the mutation. The model was then subjected to simulated annealing from 2500 K. A model for the phosphate intermediate was constructed with perfect tetrahedral geometry around the phosphorus atom, P–O bond lengths of 1.55 Å, and a P–S bond length of 1.85 Å. This model was built into the density, the WPD loop was rebuilt into difference density, adopting the closed conformation, and Gln-262 was mutated to Ala. The model was then subjected to another 100 cycles of positional refinement and 15 cycles of individual isotropic B-factor refinement. Water molecules were then added manually, subject to the same criteria applied to the PTP1B-vanadate complex, and the model was again subjected to positional and B-factor refinement. A 2F o −F c electron density map using phases from refined coordinates is shown in Fig. 3 B. The final model satisfied or exceeded all the stereochemical quality indicators of PROCHECK (26Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19767) Google Scholar). We investigated initially the structure of the PTP1B-orthovanadate complex, which provides information concerning the transition state structure of the enzyme catalyzed Tyr(P) dephosphorylation reaction. A similar structure of the distantly related Yersinia PTP has been reported (25Denu J.M. Lohse D.L. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2493-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A shows 2F o − F c and F o − F c electron density maps calculated using phases from a simulated annealing refinement run of PTP1B coordinates excluding those for vanadate. A covalent bond is formed between the Sγ atom of the nucleophilic Cys-215 residue and the vanadium atom, so that the vanadate ion forms a pentavalent trigonal bipyramidal structure that is an analogue of the pentavalent transition state intermediate. At 2.3-Å resolution, we do not observe distortion from perfect bipyramidal geometry. The three equatorial oxygen atoms of vanadate form some eight hydrogen bonds to main-chain NH groups of the PTP signature motif and guanidinium side chain of Arg-221, whereas the apical oxygen atom forms hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Gln-262 and Asp-181 (Fig. 1 B). The latter interaction suggests that the apical oxygen atom is protonated, forming a hydrogen bond with the carboxylate group of Asp-181 at pH 7.5. The apical oxygen atom most closely resembles the position of an attacking nucleophilic water molecule during the hydrolysis step of the cysteinyl-phosphate intermediate. Thus, the hydrogen bonds to Asp-181 and Gln-262 suggest that these residues may play a role in positioning and/or activating a water molecule during this step. The interaction between Asp-181 and the apical vanadate oxygen atom is possible as a result of the closed conformation of the WPD loop, similar to that observed in the PTP1B-phosphopeptide complex (7Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Closure of the loop is probably stabilized by a combination of interactions between Arg-221 and loop residues Trp-179 and Pro-180 and the hydrogen bond between Asp-181 and the vanadate apical oxygen atom. A buried water molecule (WAT1), analogous to that in the PTP1B·Tyr(P) complex, links the main-chain amide groups of Phe-182 and Arg-221 with a vanadate equatorial oxygen via a network of hydrogen bonds (Fig. 1 B). To understand the mechanism of cysteinyl-phosphate hydrolysis more fully, we have sought to determine the structure of this intermediate using x-ray crystallography. To achieve this, the rate of hydrolysis of the phosphoryl-enzyme intermediate should be substantially slower than the rate of intermediate formation to allow the intermediate to accumulate. Moreover, its life-time must be of sufficient length to be amenable to structural analysis, being in effect the rate-limiting step of the enzyme catalyzed reaction within the crystal. The nature of the rate-limiting step catalyzed by PTPs and DSPs is not entirely resolved. There are kinetic data to suggest that the rate-limiting step of PTP catalysis is the rate of phosphoryl-enzyme formation (25Denu J.M. Lohse D.L. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2493-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). This would imply that the cysteinyl-phosphate intermediate would not accumulate appreciably within the wild-type enzyme. However, other investigators, have reported that the presence of a pre-steady state burst phase observed during hydrolysis of para-nitrophenol phosphate (p-NPP) indicates that hydrolysis of the phosphoryl-enzyme intermediate is rate-limiting (27Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11199-11204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The latter result implies that during steady state catalysis, a phosphoryl-enzyme intermediate would accumulate, and this is consistent with the trapping, using rapid denaturation techniques, of phosphoryl-enzyme intermediates of PTPs during the catalytic reaction (9Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17026-17030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Pot D.A. Woodford T.A. Remboutsika E. Huan R.S. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

A. 1996; 93: 2493-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). However, since the incorporation of phosphate in the phosphoryl-enzyme intermediate was substoichiometric, the rates of phosphoryl enzyme formation and hydrolysis are probably quite similar. As discussed earlier, the structure of the PTP1B-vanadate complex suggests crucial roles for Asp-181 and Gln-262, two invariant residues, in positioning and/or activating the nucleophilic water molecule during hydrolysis of the cysteinyl-phosphate intermediate. Recent kinetic data have implicated Asp-92 of vaccinia H1-related (equivalent to Asp-181 of PTP1B) as a catalytic base during phosphoryl-enzyme hydrolysis in addition to its role as a catalytic acid to promote Tyr(P) cleavage (25Denu J.M. Lohse D.L. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2493-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). We have reported previously that mutation of Gln-262 of PTP1B to Ala reduces k cat by 100-fold and K m 10-fold (13Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). In the PTP1B-phosphotyrosine peptide complex, the position of Gln-262 differs from its position in the PTP1B-vanadate complex, as the side chain is swung out of the catalytic site to avoid a steric clash with the phenyl side chain of the Tyr(P) substrate (7Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). This implies that Gln-262 plays little or no catalytic function during cleavage of the scissile P–O bond, whereas a role in positioning and/or activating a water molecule during cysteinyl-phosphate hydrolysis is likely. From this analysis, we reasoned that the 100-fold reduction in k cat of the Q262A mutant may result from reducing the rate of hydrolysis of the cysteinyl-phosphate intermediate without affecting the rate of enzyme phosphorylation. This would render the rate-limiting step of the reaction as phosphoryl-enzyme hydrolysis and increase the life-time of the intermediate 100-fold. The wild-type enzyme k catis 40 s−1, whereas that of the Q262A mutant"

This family is regulated by extracellular growth factors that transmit largely unknown signals into the cells. Here we show that the activity of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), a kinase that is part of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, is low in myoblasts and is induced with the onset of terminal differentiation of C2 cells. ERK activity is also induced in fibroblasts that were modified to express MyoD, but not in the parental fibroblast cells. Thus, ERK induction is an intrinsic property of muscle cells. A specific MAPK kinase inhibitor (PD098059) that was added to C2 cells partially inhibited the fusion of myoblasts to multinucleated myotubes without affecting the expression of muscle-specific markers. This inhibitor blocked the induction of MyoD expression that normally takes place during terminal differentiation. Two lines of evidence suggest that the MAPK cascade induces the activity of MyoD: 1) the expression of constitutively activated forms of MEK1 or Raf1 enhanced the transcriptional activity of MyoD in 10T1/2 fibroblasts; and 2) the addition of PD098059 to fibroblast cells expressing a conditional MyoD-estrogen fusion protein significantly inhibited the expression of MyoD-responsive genes. Our results indicate that the MAPK pathway is activated in differentiating muscle cells and that it positively regulates the expression and activity of MyoD protein.

Our results indicate that the MAPK pathway is activated in differentiating muscle cells and that it positively regulates the expression and activity of MyoD protein. The development of skeletal muscle is a multistep process in which pluripotent mesodermal cells give rise to myoblasts that subsequently withdraw from the cell cycle and differentiate into myotubes. Each of these steps is subjected to positive and negative regulatory mechanisms. The first stage, commitment of mesodermal cells to the myogenic lineage, is induced by positive cues of extracellular molecules like Sonic Hedgehog and Wnt family members secreted from neighboring tissues (1Munsterberg A.E. Kitajewski J. Bumcrot D.A. McMahon A.P. Lassar A.B. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2911-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 2Lassar A.B. Munsterberg A.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These positive cues induce the expression of two members of the MyoD family, Myf5 and MyoD. Cells that express either MyoD or Myf5 are dividing myoblasts that are committed to the myogenic lineage. However, these proteins are not functional in myoblasts, and their activities are induced only upon withdrawal from the cell cycle and during terminal differentiation. Once activated, MyoD and Myf5 contribute to the arrest of the cell cycle, transcription of muscle-specific genes, and terminal differentiation (3Lassar A.B. Skapek S.X. Novitch B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 788-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Induction of the activity of MyoD and Myf5 proteins may be a result of the appearance of positive regulator(s) or, alternatively, the disappearance of negative regulator(s). Extracellular growth factors and intracellular proteins that inactivate MyoD proteins have been studied extensively (3Lassar A.B. Skapek S.X. Novitch B. Curr. Opin.

Less is known at present about the mechanisms that activate these proteins. Insulin and insulin-like growth factors are the only extracellular growth factors known to promote terminal differentiation of myoblasts (6Coleman M.E. DeMayo F. Yin K.C. Lee H.M. Geske R.

Insulin and insulin-like growth factors are involved in activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPKs, mitogen-activated protein kinases; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase; MBP, myelin basic protein; ER, estrogen receptor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MHC, myosin heavy chain; MLC, myosin light chain; MCK, muscle creatine kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; JNK, Jun N-terminal kinase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. 1The abbreviations used are: MAPKs, mitogen-activated protein kinases; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase; MBP, myelin basic protein; ER, estrogen receptor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MHC, myosin heavy chain; MLC, myosin light chain; MCK, muscle creatine kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; JNK, Jun N-terminal kinase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. via tyrosine kinase receptors within many cells. In muscle cells, insulin activates different MAPK pathways as well as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (8Moxham C.M. Tabrizchi A. Davis R.J. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30765-30773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 9Tsakiridis T. Taha C. Grinstein S. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19664-19667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, the involvement of these kinase cascades in muscle differentiation is largely unknown. A recent work has demonstrated that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors suppressed morphological and biochemical changes associated with L6E9 myoblast terminal differentiation (10Kaliman P. Vinals F. Testar X. Palacin M. Zorzano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19146-19151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that these kinase cascades participate in promoting terminal muscle differentiation. A potential signal transduction pathway that might be involved in myoblast differentiation is the MAPK pathway, which is known to play a complex pleiotropic role in cell growth and differentiation of many lineages. In fibroblasts, this pathway transmits mitogenic signals and interferes with normal differentiation of hepatocytes. However, in other lineages, such as neuronal cells, adipocytes, oocytes, T cells, and photoreceptor cells of the fruit fly Drosophila, activation of this pathway promotes cell differentiation (11Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). The simplest explanation for the different manifestations of the MAPK pathway is that it affects the regulation of diverse target genes in different cell lineages. However, other explanations are also possible; in the rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells that serve as a model for neuronal differentiation, temporal parameters of MAPK activation are critical for the definition of growth versus differentiation signals (12Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4225) Google Scholar). Sustained activation of ERK leads to differentiation, whereas short-lived activation leads to proliferation. The effect of MAPK on muscle cells is controversial; some suggest that it is mitogenic and prevents differentiation, others believe that it is not involved in differentiation, while still others consider that it may promote differentiation (see “Discussion”). In view of the involvement of MAPK in the differentiation of various cell lineages and its largely disputed role in myogenesis, we investigated the involvement of MAPK in muscle cell differentiation. In this study, we show that the MAPK pathway plays a positive role in myogenesis. We report that ERK activity is substantially induced during terminal muscle differentiation of C2 cells. The level of c-Fos mRNA, a target of the MAPK pathway, was found to be elevated during differentiation. The induction of ERK activity was specific to differentiating muscle cells and did not take place in fibroblast progenitors of these muscle cells. Activation of the MAPK pathway in transfected cells or its inhibition by the specific inhibitor PD098059 suggests that the MAPK pathway is involved in the induction of MyoD expression and activity. Therefore, we conclude that MAPK activity is induced during muscle differentiation and cooperates with MyoD to activate muscle-specific transcription. PD098059 was a product of New England Biolabs Inc. Rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the C-terminal epitope corresponding to amino acids 245–258 of rat ERK2 was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit polyclonal antibody against a synthetic phosphotyrosine (residue 204) peptide that corresponded to residues 196–209 of human p44 MAPK was purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. Protein A-Sepharose, estradiol, and myelin basic protein (MBP) were supplied by Sigma. pEMSV-MyoD has been described by Tapscott et al.(13Tapscott S.J. Davis R.L. Thayer M.J. Cheng P.-F. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Science. 1988; 242: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The 4R-tk-CAT reporter gene was described by Weintraub et al. (14Weintraub H. Davis R. Lockshon D. Lassar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5623-5627Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Plasmids pGEX-Jun, CMV-act.MEK1, and Raf1-CAAX were gifts from Drs. Ami Aronheim and Michael Karin. The activated allele of MEK1 was originally described by Mansour et al. (15Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar), and Raf-CAAX by Leevers et al. (16Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). The constitutively activated MEK1 used in this work was S218E/S222D. The dominant-negative form of MEK1 used was K97M (15Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). C2 cells were a gift of Dr. David Yaffe (17Yaffe D. Saxel O. Nature. 1977; 270: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar). 10T1/2 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. 10T1/2-MyoD cells were prepared by transfecting pEMSV-MyoD together with pBABE-puro into 10T1/2 cells. Cells were selected in the presence of 2 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma), and myogenic clones were isolated. The preparation of 10T1/2 cells that express MyoD-ER fusion protein was described previously (18Hollenberg S.M. Cheng P.-F. Weintraub H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8028-8032Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories), penicillin, and streptomycin (growth medium). To induce differentiation, we used Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml insulin and 10 μg/ml transferrin (differentiation medium). 10T1/2-MyoD-ER cells were induced in differentiation medium supplemented with 10−7m β-estradiol. PD098059 was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to a concentration of 20 mm and was added directly to differentiation medium to a final concentration of 20–100 μm. Control cells were incubated with the same volumes of dimethyl sulfoxide without PD098059. The medium was replaced every 12 h with medium containing fresh PD098059. Transfections were performed by calcium phosphate precipitation as described (19Davis R.L. Cheng P.-F. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 60: 733-746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Cells in 6-cm TC dishes (Corning) were transfected for 12 h with a total amount of 10 μg of the following plasmid DNAs: 1 μg of pCMV-LacZ, 3 μg of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene, 3 μg of myogenic expression plasmid, and 3 μg of expression vector of activated MEK1 or Raf-CAAX. Following transfection, the medium was replaced with either growth medium or differentiation medium for another 24–48 h. Transfection efficiency was tested in soluble 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside assays as described (20An G. Hikada K. Siminovitch L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1628-1632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the amount of extracts used for the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays was adjusted accordingly (21Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). Cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 7 min, washed three times in PBS, and permeabilized in 0.25% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Subsequently, the cells were incubated for 90 min with a primary antibody. The primary antibodies used were monoclonal anti-MyoD (5.8A), polyclonal anti-MHC (Sigma), and polyclonal anti-MCK. After three washings in PBS, the cells were incubated for 90 min with a secondary antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate or to rhodamine (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). The cells were washed three time in PBS, and the final wash contained 1 ng/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The immunochemically stained cells were viewed at a magnification × 200 in a fluorescence microscope (Olympus Model BX50). Using the bacterial expression vector pGEX2T-Jun-(1–223), the Jun protein was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 cells and purified from extracts on glutathione beads as described (22Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). To prepare cell extracts, cells were washed three times in PBS and then extracted in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.7), 0.3 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate). The suspension was rotated at 4 °C for 30 min, and the extract was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. Equal amounts of cell extracts were collected at different times after the initiation of cell differentiation and were mixed with 15 μl of GSH-agarose beads to which GST or GST-Jun proteins were bound. The mixtures were rotated at 4 °C for 3 h, pelleted at 10,000 × g for 10 s, and washed extensively four times in 1 ml of HEPES binding buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.7), 50 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100). The GSH-agarose beads were resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 20 mmMgCl2, 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) containing 20 μm ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 μCi/mmol). After 20 min at 30 °C, the kinase reaction was terminated by washing the beads with HEPES binding buffer, and phosphorylated proteins were eluted in 30 μl of Laemmli sample buffer and resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Cells were extracted in lysis buffer. Equal amounts of protein from each time point of differentiation were mixed with 10 μl of anti-ERK2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2.5 h at 4 °C with rotation. Protein A-Sepharose was added, and the mixtures were rotated for an additional hour. Following removal of the supernatant, protein A beads were washed in 3 × 1 ml of 0.5 m NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100 and in 1 × 1 ml of 10 mm HEPES and 10 mmMgCl2. Complexes were then resuspended in 10 μl of substrate (2 mg/ml MBP) and 10 μl of a solution containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 50 μm ATP, 10 mmMgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.6) and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The phosphorylation reaction was terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer. The mixture was heated to 90 °C for 5 min and then separated on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel to directly visualize MBP phosphorylation. Cells were harvested, and RNA was extracted with Tri Reagent solution (Molecular Research Center, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's directions. Total RNA (5 μg) was used for Northern blot analysis on 1.5% agarose gels containing 6.7% formaldehyde. Gels were transferred to Magna nylon membrane by Micron Separations Inc. and were UV-cross-linked. Blots were hybridized with probes for myoD (pEMSV-MyoD), myogenin (pEMSV-myogenin),mlc2 (pVZLC2), p21 (pcDNA-Waf1), and GAPDH (pMGAP) that were prepared with random hexamers and the Klenow reaction. Hybridization was conducted overnight at 65 °C in a buffer containing 0.2 m sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 7% SDS. Blots were washed at 60 °C in 0.5× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015m sodium citrate) and 0.1% SDS, three times for 15 min each time. Blots were stripped by boiling for 5 min in 0.1% SDS solution. Cells were lyzed as described for the kinase assays, and equal amounts of extracted proteins were loaded, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride filters. Immunoblotting was conducted with the anti-ERK2 (1:100 dilution) and anti-phospho-MAPK (1:100 dilution; New England Biolabs Inc.) antibodies. Proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA (200 and 500 ng treated with RQ DNase I (Promega)) was incubated with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase for 30 min at 55 °C as described (23Rupp R.A.W. Weintraub H. Cell. 1991; 65: 927-937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription reactions were used for PCR amplification of specific cDNAs. One-fifth of the reverse transcription sample was added to the PCR buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm each dNTP, 1 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP, 25 pmol of each primer, and 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Promega) in a total volume of 50 μl. DNA amplification was performed under the following conditions: denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, primer annealing at 62 °C for 30 s, and primer extension at 72 °C for 1 min. One-fifth of the PCR sample was electrophoresed on 6% polyacrylamide gel, and PCR fragments were viewed by autoradiography. To enable quantification, a cycle number was chosen for each primer pair that maintained approximately exponential amplification with the most enriched sample. Thus, for c-fos and the L7 ribosomal gene primers, 30 and 22 cycles were applied, respectively (18Hollenberg S.M. Cheng P.-F. Weintraub H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8028-8032Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The following pairs of primers were used: c-fos, 5′-ACG TGT AAG TAG TGC AGC CC-3′ and 5′-CAG AGT CTG AGG AGG CCT TC-3′ (313 nucleotides); and L7, 5′-GAA GCT CAT CTA TGA GAA GGC-3′ and 5′-AAG ACG AAG GAG CTG CAG AAC-3′ (202 nucleotides). To study the in vitro activity of the ERK pathway in differentiating C2 muscle cells, extracts were prepared from cells that were grown in growth medium (15% bovine calf serum) and from cells grown in differentiation medium, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and collected at different stages of differentiation. ERK proteins were immunoprecipitated from these extracts using polyclonal anti-ERK1/2 antibodies, and the kinase activity of the immunoprecipitates was measured by phosphorylation of MBP. The activity of ERKs was induced concomitantly with the onset of muscle differentiation (Fig. 1, compare the activity of ERK with the expression of MLC2). To test the specificity of the ERK pattern of induction, the activity of JNK, which belongs to a separate MAPK pathway, was determined in the same extracts. As shown in Fig. 1, in contrast to ERK, the activity of JNK was reduced during muscle differentiation. To further verify that ERK activity is induced during muscle differentiation, a phospho-specific ERK antibody was used to detect the active forms of ERK proteins. Two phosphorylated forms of ERK, p42 and p44, were detected, and their levels were found to increase during differentiation (Fig. 2 A). The increase in the phosphorylated form of ERK was not due to an increase in the total level of ERK proteins, as demonstrated by the similar amounts of ERK proteins at different stages of differentiation that were detected by antibodies to all forms of ERK (Fig. 2 B). Transcription of the c-fos gene is directly induced by the MAPK pathway (24Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar, 25Coffer P. De Jong M. Mettouchi A. Binetruy B. Ghysdael J. Kruijer W. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 911-921PubMed Google Scholar). ERK participates in c-fos induction via phosphorylation of p62tcf, which is part of the serum response complex activating the c-fos promoter (24Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). To test whether induction of ERK activity in muscle cells is followed by expression of the c-fos gene, c-Fos transcripts were detected at different stages of differentiation. Transcripts of c-Fos were barely detected by standard Northern analysis in C2 cells (data not shown); therefore, a quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis of c-Fos was performed (Fig. 3). Levels of c-Fos mRNA were low in myoblasts and increased during the process of differentiation (Fig. 3 A). Induction of c-Fos occurred concomitantly with induction of ERK activity in the same cells (Fig. 3 B). It therefore appears that the induction of ERK activity takes place simultaneously with the expression of the c-fos gene. The similar pattern of expression suggests that the transcription of c-fos may be induced in myotubes as a result of ERK activation. Subsequently, we asked whether the induction of ERK activity is an intrinsic property of differentiating muscle cells or is a result of the transfer of cells to insulin-containing differentiation medium. For this purpose, 10T1/2 fibroblasts were transfected with an expression vector of MyoD, and clones were isolated that stably expressed MyoD and became myogenic (10T1/2-MyoD). These cells, as well as progenitor 10T1/2 fibroblasts, were grown in high serum-containing medium (growth medium) and then transferred to medium that contained insulin (differentiation medium). Protein extracts were prepared from myogenic 10T1/2-MyoD cells and from 10T1/2 fibroblast cells that were grown in growth medium and in differentiation medium for 48 h, and ERK activity was assayed. As shown in Fig. 4 A, ERK activity was high in proliferating 10T1/2 fibroblasts and was reduced after their growth in differentiation medium for 48 h. By contrast, ERK activity in 10T1/2-MyoD myoblasts was low in proliferating cells and was markedly induced in myotubes that were grown in differentiation medium for 48 h. Levels of ERK activity in myoblasts of 10T1/2-MyoD clones and C2 cells were always lower than in 10T1/2 fibroblast cells grown in high serum-containing medium (Figs. 1 and 4). The possibility that ERK activity is suppressed in the presence of MyoD in proliferating myoblasts was tested. For this purpose, ERK activity was studied in another cell line that originated from 10T1/2 fibroblasts. This cell line expresses a MyoD-estrogen receptor chimeric protein whose activity is induced by the addition of estradiol to the medium (18Hollenberg S.M. Cheng P.-F. Weintraub H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8028-8032Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The conditional MyoD protein is inactive in the cytoplasm of cells that have not been treated with estradiol. Proliferating 10T1/2-MyoD-ER cells expressed high levels of ERK activity under high serum conditions (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1 and 4). Levels of ERK activity in this cell line were similar to levels of proliferating 10T1/2 fibroblasts and distinctly higher than levels of proliferating myoblasts (Fig. 4). However, when differentiation was induced by the addition of estradiol and differentiation medium, ERK activity remained high at the onset of differentiation (48 h in differentiation medium) (Fig. 4 B,lanes 4 and 5). In the absence of estradiol and in the presence of differentiation medium, ERK activity declined in differentiation medium as seen in fibroblasts (Fig. 4 B,lanes 1 and 2). Hence, we conclude that (a) ERK activity is significantly lower in dividing myoblasts than in dividing fibroblasts and (b) the induction of ERK is an inherent property of muscle cells, and not of the parental fibroblast cells. The pattern of ERK activity during myogenesis suggests a positive role for this pathway in myogenesis. To test this possibility, we investigated whether the inhibition of the MAPK pathway affects myogenesis. The specific noncompetitive inhibitor of MAPK kinase (PD098059) blocks its activation by Raf1 (26Alessi D.R. Chuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3249) Google Scholar, 27Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). This inhibitor was shown to prevent the in vivo activation of MAPK by growth factors and to reverse the transformed phenotype induced by Ras overexpression or by nerve growth factor-induced differentiation (27Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar, 28Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2586) Google Scholar). First, PD098059 levels that inhibit ERK activity in C2 cells were determined. Differentiation medium was added with PD098059 to C2 cells; 72 h later, the cells were lyzed, and the activity of MAPK in the extracts was determined (Fig. 5 A). Treatment of cells with 50 μm PD098059 inhibited >80% of ERK activity (Fig. 5 A). Under these conditions, PD098059 did not affect the activity of another MAPK, JNK (data not shown). Whereas untreated C2 cells differentiated and fused to form multinucleated myotubes, PD098059-treated cells differentiated to form less developed myotubes that contained fewer nuclei (Fig. 5 C). Immunohistochemical staining of MyoD (nuclear) and MCK (cytoplasmic) indicated that both muscle-specific markers were expressed in drug-treated and untreated cells. The reason why PD098059-treated cells did not fuse properly was not due to a reduced density of these cells, as can be seen by the nuclear staining of all cells in the microscopic field (Fig. 5 C, lower right panel). The inhibitory effect of PD098059 was reversible; removal of the drug allowed the cells to fuse and form multinucleated myoblasts (data not shown). Multinucleated myotube formation normally entails induction of the expression of muscle-specific marker proteins. The effect of the ERK pathway on the expression of several muscle-specific marker proteins was investigated. None of the examined muscle-specific markers was inhibited in PD098059-treated cells (Fig. 5, B, MLC2; and C, MCK). Also, induction of p21 (Waf1), causing the exit of myoblasts from the cell cycle, was not inhibited in PD098059-treated cells. The expression of myogenin, a member of the MyoD family, was induced to a similar extent in the drug-treated and untreated cells (Fig. 5 B). Myf5 expression was not detected in C2 cells using Northern analysis (data not shown). However, MyoD, whose expression was induced during differentiation, remained at low basal levels in cells that were treated with the drug (Fig. 5 B). Therefore, from the differentiation markers that were examined, only MyoD expression was affected. We conclude that treatment of C2 cells with PD098059 had a limited effect on differentiation; MyoD expression was not induced, and cells did not fuse as efficiently as untreated cells. We suspected that the decrease in cell fusion could be a result of the reduced expression of MyoD in these cells. To test this possibility, another myogenic cell line that does not express detectable levels of MyoD was treated with the drug. Like C2 cells, this cell line (L-8) differentiated to form multinucleated myotubes when grown in differentiati"

In this study, we investigated the roles of the last N-extein residue (−1 residue) and the intein penultimate residue in modulating splicing reactions. Most of the 20 amino acid substitutions at the −1 position had no effect on overall protein splicing but could lead to significant accumulation of thioester intermediates when splicing was blocked by mutation. A subset of −1 substitutions attenuated the initiation of protein splicing and enabled us to demonstrate in vitro splicing of a mesophilic intein containing all wild-type catalytic residues. Substitutions involving the intein penultimate residue allowed modulation of the branch resolution and C-terminal cleavage reaction. Our data suggest that the N-S acyl rearrangement, which initiates splicing, may also serve as the rate-limiting step. Through appropriate amino acid substitutions, we were able to modulate splicing reactions in vitro by change in pH or temperature or addition of thiol reagents. Both insertion and deletion were tolerated in the central region of the intein although splicing or structure of the intein may have been affected.

Protein splicing involves a precise excision of an internal segment, the intein, from a protein precursor and a concomitant ligation of the flanking regions, the exteins, resulting in the production of two proteins (1Perler F.B.

Since the initial discovery of protein splicing, more than 40 inteins have been identified (2Perler F.B. Olsen G.J. Adam E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1087-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis reveals that inteins are bounded by Cys, Ser at N termini and Asn at C termini and, with a few exceptions, have His as the penultimate residue (2Perler F.B. Olsen G.J. Adam E.

The chemical mechanism of protein splicing of the inteins from the thermostable DNA polymerase of Pyrococcus sp. GB-D (Psp pol-1 intein) and the 69-kDa vacuolar membrane ATPase subunit of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sce VMA intein) suggests that a common protein splicing pathway may have evolved in thermophilic archaea and mesophilic eukaryotes (3Xu M.-Q.

Protein splicing of the SceVMA intein consists of the following multi-step reactions: step 1, an N-S rearrangement at the intein N terminus (Cys1) to form a thioester bond between Cys1 and the last N-extein residue (−1 residue); step 2, a trans-esterification reaction by the first C-extein residue Cys455 to form a branched intermediate; step 3, succinimide formation at the intein C terminus (Asn454) to resolve the branched intermediate; step 4, a final S-N rearrangement to form a peptide bond linkage between the ligated exteins (Fig. 1 A) (5Chong S.

Gimble F.S. Quiocho F.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 555-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Since the crystal structure represents the excised intein, the structure of the extein-intein precursor that involves at least one extein residue (i.e. Cys455) at the splicing active site is still unknown. Although the crystal structure supports our proposed splicing pathway, many mechanistic details of the splicing reactions have not been elucidated.Previously, we examined the Sce VMA intein in an in vitro MYT splicing system (5Chong S.

Previous studies have shown that the Sce VMA intein penultimate residue, His453, although conserved in almost all inteins, was not essential for protein splicing (5Chong S. Yang S. Paulus H.

Although our data on the in vitro splicing reaction support our proposed splicing pathway (5Chong S. Yang S. Paulus H. Benner J. Perler F.B. Xu M.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22159-22168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), direct examination of in vitro splicing of the Sce VMA intein containing unaltered catalytic residues has been a challenge.The Sce VMA intein also functions as a site-specific homing endonuclease which mediates gene mobility (10Lambowitz A.M.

The crystal structure of the Sce VMA intein suggests that the splicing and endonuclease functions may reside in two separate domains (6Duan X. Gimble F.S. Quiocho F.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 555-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). We made large in-frame deletions which removed the domain containing the dodecapeptide motifs, demonstrating the remaining splicing domain was sufficient for efficient splicing (15Chong S. Xu M.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15587-15590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).This paper extends our previous in vitro studies to focus on residues that are in close proximity to the reaction center but not directly involved in the splicing reactions, i.e. the last N-extein residue (the −1 residue) and the intein penultimate residue. This approach enabled us to modulate each of the first three splicing reactions by change in pH, temperature, and/or addition of thiol reagents and allowed direct examination of in vitro splicing of the Sce VMA intein containing wild-type catalytic residues. In addition, we investigated the effect of deletion and insertion in the Sce VMA intein on splicing reactions. Our results provide strategies for modulating protein splicing and insights into the mechanism of protein splicing of a mesophilic intein.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of the first three reactions in the protein splicing pathway of the SceVMA intein: N-S acyl rearrangement, trans-esterification, and succinimide formation coupled to C-terminal cleavage (Fig. 1 A). By substituting the −1 residue and the intein penultimate residue, we were able to attenuate the splicing process and allow investigation of each splicing reactions in in vitrosystems. Appropriate substitution of the −1 residue enabled us to examine in vitro splicing of the Sce VMA intein containing all wild-type catalytic residues. Induction of branch resolution and C-terminal cleavage in vitro was made possible by substitution of the intein penultimate residue in conjunction with substitution of the first C-extein residue. In addition, the study of the effect of insertion and deletion provides the first evidence suggesting that intein can tolerate the insertion of a foreign protein domain and that the structure of the intein for protein splicing may be destabilized by the deletion or insertion mutation. Our data yield further insights into the mechanism of protein splicing and strategies for modulating protein splicing reactions.Roles of the Last N-extein Residue and Modulation of Protein Splicing with −1 SubstitutionsEfficient splicing occurs when inteins are transferred into heterologous proteins, suggesting that the inteins plus the first C-extein residue contain sufficient information for catalyzing splicing reactions (3Xu M.-Q.

Cell. 1992; 71: 201-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it is conceivable that splicing in a foreign context can be affected by the proximal extein sequences since the catalytic residues of protein splicing are located at the intein termini (4Xu M.-Q. Perler F.B. EMBO. J. 1996; 15: 5146-5153Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 5Chong S. Yang S. Paulus H. Benner J. Perler F.B. Xu M.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22159-22168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). It has been recently proposed that splicing of the Sce VMA intein involves interactions between the intein residues upstream of the C-terminal splice junction and the proximal extein residues upstream of the N-terminal splice junction (25Nogami S. Satow Y. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. Genetics. 1997; 147: 73-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N-S acyl rearrangement initiates protein splicing, forming a thioester bond between Cys1 and the −1 residue (5Chong S. Yang S. Paulus H. Benner J. Perler F.B. Xu M.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22159-22168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Glycine is the −1 residue in the 69-kDa vacuolar ATPase subunit of S. cerevisiae in which the SceVMA intein is embedded prior to protein splicing (26Kane P.M. Yamashiro C.T. Wolczyk D.F. Neff N. Goebl M. Stevens T.H. Science. 1990; 250: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The question of how substitution of the −1 residue may affect protein splicing has not been examined by previous studies. In this study, we addressed this question by substituting the −1 residue with each of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids.Based on their effects on N-terminal cleavage and/or the N-S acyl rearrangement, the 20 −1 substitutions in the MYB fusion system can be divided into four groups. The first group of substitutions, including the Gly−1, Ala−1, Ile−1, Ser−1, Gln−1, and His−1 substitutions, resulted in efficient (30–95%) DTT-induced N-terminal cleavage of the native precursors but almost no (<5%) cleavage of the urea-denatured precursors (Table III). These substitutions allowed the N-S acyl rearrangement to favor peptide bond formation prior to DTT treatment. Incubation with DTT shifted the N-S equilibrium by cleaving the thioester intermediate and inducing the formation of a thioester bond. The second group of substitutions, including the Cys−1, Asn−1, and Pro−1 substitutions, blocked DTT-induced N-terminal cleavage of both native and urea-denatured precursors (Table III). One possible explanation is that these substitutions blocked the formation of thioester bond in the N-S equilibrium. Alternatively, these substitutions may cause a structural change in the active site that prevents the access of DTT to the thioester bond. The third group of substitutions includes the Val−1, Leu−1, Thr−1, Glu−1, Lys−1, Phe−1, Tyr−1, Trp−1, and Met−1 substitutions (Table III). Significant amounts of the DTT-induced N-terminal cleavage occurred in both native and urea-denatured precursors. N-terminal cleavage was also observed when the precursors were denatured in urea at high pH without DTT treatment (Fig. 2) or denatured in 6 m guanidinium HCl followed by DTT treatment (data not shown). The data suggest that these substitutions caused a significant shift in the N-S equilibrium, resulting in accumulation of thioester intermediates prior to DTT treatment. These thioester intermediates could include both linear precursors and branched intermediates, as cleavage of both results in the identical products (i.e. M and YB) (Fig. 1 A). The MYB fusion proteins contained the wild-type first C-extein residue Cys455 and, therefore, were capable of forming the branched intermediate (Fig. 1 A). As shown in Fig. 2, there was a component in the untreated samples migrating slower than the expected linear precursor. Whether this slow-migrating component was the branched intermediate or the result of protein aggregation requires further investigation. Assuming that urea denaturation immediately disrupted the N-S equilibrium and no further thioester or peptide bond formation occurred during denaturation, the percentage of N-terminal cleavage of the urea-denatured precursors (Table III) may represent the percentage of thioester intermediates in the native fusion precursors. Nevertheless, without detailed kinetic studies, we cannot rule out the possibility that these substitutions might cause accumulation of thioester intermediates during denaturation. The fourth group of the −1 substitutions, including the Asp−1 and Arg−1 substitutions, caused substantial N-terminal cleavage in vivo or in the course of purification (TableIII). It is possible that these substitutions may disrupt the structure of the splice junctions, resulting in proteolytic cleavage or hydrolysis.The majority of the −1 substitutions in the MYK fusion system had no significant effect on protein splicing even though many substitutions had been shown to shift the N-S equilibrium in the MYB fusion (Fig. 3 A and Table III). Nevertheless, certain −1 substitutions clearly disrupted the course of normal protein splicing, and their effects on proteins splicing paralleled their effects on the N-S equilibrium (Table III). For instance, the Pro−1 substitution, which blocked DTT-induced N-terminal cleavage in the MYB fusion, also inhibited protein splicing in the MYK fusion. The Val−1, Leu−1, and Ile−1 substitutions, which retarded the thiol-induced N-terminal cleavage in the MYB fusion, resulted in mostly unspliced precursors and/or C-terminal cleavage products in the MYK fusion (Table III). The effects of the Asn−1 and Cys−1 substitutions were somewhat different. Although DTT-induced N-terminal cleavage was almost completely blocked by the Asn−1 and Cys−1 substitutions in the MYB fusion, efficient splicing in the MYK fusion occurred in vitro (Table III and Fig. 3 B). A combination of the N454A mutation and the Asn−1 or Cys−1 substitution in the MYB fusion resulted in inhibition of the N-terminal cleavage, whereas restoration of the intein residue 454 to the wild-type residue Asn in the MYK fusion in conjunction with the Asn−1 or Cys−1 substitution allowed completion of protein splicing reactions. In conclusion, our results indicate that glycine at the −1 position of the Sce VMA intein is not essential for efficient protein splicing and can be substituted by other amino acid residues. A subset of amino acids at the −1 position shifts the equilibrium position of the N-S acyl rearrangement thereby affecting protein splicing. Appropriate substitutions of the −1 residue enabled us to modulate the rate of protein splicing and convert splicing into C-terminal cleavage.Effect of Substituting the Intein Penultimate HistidineSubstitution of the penultimate histidine of the Psp pol-1 intein (His536) has been shown to block both splicing and C-terminal cleavage and lead to accumulation of branched intermediate (4Xu M.-Q. Perler F.B. EMBO. J. 1996; 15: 5146-5153Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Substitution of the penultimate histidine of the Sce VMA intein (His453), on the other hand, produced different results. Neither splicing nor cleavage was completely inhibited by the H453L substitution (Table IV). Double substitutions, such as H453L/C455S, are required in order for efficient splicing to occur without in vivo cleavage. The observations of the accumulation of a branched intermediate and in vitrosplicing of the precursors in the double substitutions, H453L/C455S (Fig. 4) and H453Q/C455S (data not shown), suggest that the His453 substitution attenuates but does not block succinimide formation or C-terminal cleavage, whereas the C455S substitution may help to allow normal splicing to proceed without side reactions. In vitro protein splicing was less efficient when His453 was substituted with Ala or Phe (i.e. in H453A/C455S and H453F/C455S) (Table IV). Splicing was completely blocked, and efficient DTT-induced cleavage was observed when Cys455 was substituted with Ala to block the trans-esterification in the double substitution, H453Q/C455A (discussed below). It is apparent that substituting the intein penultimate histidine residues in conjunction with the first C-extein residue provides an alternative for modulating protein splicing and converting splicing to cleavage. These results illustrate the intricate coordination of the active site residues of the Sce VMA intein in catalyzing protein splicing and the possible role of His453 in assisting succinimide formation and branch resolution.Induction of C-terminal Cleavage and Simulation of Protein Splicing Reactions in VitroThe double substitution, H453Q/C455S, resulted in accumulation of a branched intermediate and in vitrosplicing (Table IV) suggesting that, albeit at an attenuated rate, the H453Q substitution could still allow C-terminal succinimide formation and cleavage. However, C-terminal cleavage in the H453Q/C455A double mutant was completely blocked resulting in isolation of linear unspliced precursors (Fig. 5). As the C455A substitution rendered the mutant incapable of undergoing trans-esterification, the results suggested that by inducing N-terminal cleavage to mimic trans-esterification, we were be able to induce C-terminal cleavage. This was indeed the case when the linear precursors carrying the H453Q/C455A double substitution were treated with DTT or cysteine to generate both N-terminal and C-terminal cleavage products (Fig. 5). Unlike thiol-induced N-terminal cleavage (9Chong S. Mersha F.B. Comb D.G. Scott M.E. Landry D. Vence L.M. Perler F.B. Benner J. Kucera R.B. Hirvonen C.A. Pelletier J.J. Paulus H. Xu M.-Q. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 192: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), C-terminal cleavage was independent of thiols as it could occur after the removal of thiols and was inhibited at pH 6.0 but not at pH 8.0 (Fig. 5 B). In addition, no C-terminal cleavage was observed before thiol treatment (Fig. 5 A, lanes 1 and 2), suggesting that C-terminal cleavage occurred after the induction of N-terminal cleavage. We speculate that thiol-induced N-terminal cleavage in the H453Q/C455A double mutant triggers a conformational change in the intein structure thereby allowing succinimide formation and C-terminal cleavage to proceed at basic pH. Whether or not this reflects the actual protein splicing of the wild-type Sce VMA intein remains unanswered. Nevertheless, the induction of cleavage at both splice junctions by exogenous cysteine simulated each step of the splicing reactions as follows: the exogenous cysteine functioned as Cys455 to attack the thioester bond formed by the N-S acyl rearrangement; C-terminal cleavage occurred after the N-terminal cleavage; and the exogenous cysteine formed a covalent bond with the N-extein through an S-N acyl rearrangement (Fig. 1 A) (5Chong S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22159-22168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar).Further Examination of the Mechanism of Protein Splicing of the Sce VMA InteinStudies of protein splicing of a thermophilic archeal intein, i.e. Psp pol-1 intein, have been facilitated by the fact that in vivo splicing of the wild-type intein in a foreign protein context could be attenuated by low growth temperatures (12–15 °C) (3Xu M.-Q. Southworth M.W. Mersha F.B. Hornstra L.J. Perler F.B. Cell. 1993; 75: 1371-1377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 27Xu M.-Q. Comb D.G. Paulus H. Noren C.J. Shao Y. Perler F.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5517-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Consequently, sufficient precursors could be isolated to demonstrate in vitro splicing (3Xu M.-Q. Southworth M.W. Mersha F.B. Hornstra L.J. Perler F.B. Cell. 1993; 75: 1371-1377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The Sce VMA intein, on the other hand, underwent rapid splicing in vivo even at low growth temperatures (5Chong S. Yang S. Paulus H. Benner J. Perler F.B. Xu M.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22159-22168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 7Cooper A.A. Chen Y. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2575-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We utilized amino acid substitutions of catalytic residues of the SceVMA intein to block or attenuate the splicing process to isolate sufficient precursors and intermediates (5Chong S. Yang S. Paulus H. Benner J. Perler F.B. Xu M.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22159-22168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Since the mechanism of protein splicing was deduced from analyses of mutants containing altered catalytic residues (5Chong S. Yang S. Paulus H. Benner J. Perler F.B. Xu M.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22159-22168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 7Cooper A.A. Chen Y. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2575-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), little is known about the close coupling and intricate balancing of the wild-type splicing reactions of the Sce VMA intein. In this study, we modulated protein splicing through appropriate substitutions of the −1 residue and the intein penultimate residue. As a result, we were able to examine protein splicing of the Sce VMA intein without altering its essential catalytic residues. In particular, we focused on the effect of pH on splicing reactions. Thiol-induced cleavage at the N terminus proceeded efficiently at pH values ranging from 5.5 to 9.0, but the rate of cleavage was significantly higher at pH 8.0 than pH 6.0 (TableII) (9Chong S. Mersha F.B. Comb D.G. Scott M.E. Landry D. Vence L.M. Perler F.B. Benner J. Kucera R.B. Hirvonen C.A. Pelletier J.J. Paulus H. Xu M.-Q. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 192: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Similarly, our results suggest that branch resolution (Fig. 4) and C-terminal cleavage (Fig. 5 B) were inhibited at pH 6.0 but proceeded efficiently at pH 8.0–8.5. It is possible that the nucleophilic displacements at the intein upstream and downstream splice junctions are assisted by similar groups of residues that act as acid or base catalysts. Completely different pH effects were observed when in vitro splicing of the fusion precursors from pMYK(Asn−1) was examined. The rate of splicing was higher at pH 6.0 than pH 8.0 (Fig. 3 B). As no catalytic residues of the intein in pMYK(Asn−1) were altered, it is possible that a similar pH profile may also apply to protein splicing of the wild-type intein in vivo. Since it has been shown that the N-S (or N-O) rearrangement favors ester bond formation at low pH and amide bond formation at high pH (28Bruice T.C. Benkovic S.J. Breslow R. Karplus M. Bioorganic Mechanisms. 1. W. A. Benjamin, Inc., New York1966: 266-297Google Scholar, 29Iwai K. Ando T. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 263-283Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the results suggest that the rate of overall splicing is primarily determined by the N-S acyl rearrangement. Consistent with this explanation, we have shown that thiol-induced N-terminal cleavage (Table II), branch resolution (Fig. 4), and C-terminal cleavage (Fig. 5 B) proceed more efficiently at high pH than low pH. Therefore, both trans-esterification and branch resolution are unlikely to be the rate-limiting step in the protein splicing pathway. In addition,"

Although Acr −/− mouse sperm lacking the acrosin protease activity still penetrated the zona pellucida and fertilized the egg, the mutant sperm exhibited a delay in penetration of the zona pellucida solely at the early stages after insemination. To further elucidate the role of acrosin in fertilization, we have examined the involvement of acrosin in the acrosome reaction of sperm using the Acr −/− mutant mice. When the ability of sperm to adhere (attach) and bind to the zona pellucida of cumulus-free eggs was assessed in vitro, no significant difference was observed among Acr +/+,Acr +/−, and Acr −/− mouse sperm. Immunocytochemical analysis demonstrated that the release of several acrosomal proteins from the acrosome of Acr −/− mouse sperm was significantly delayed during the calcium ionophore- and solubilized zona pellucida-induced acrosome reaction, despite normal membrane vesiculation. These data indicate that the delayed sperm penetration of the zona pellucida in the Acr −/− mouse results from the altered rate of protein dispersal from the acrosome and provide the first evidence that the major role of acrosin is to accelerate the dispersal of acrosomal components during acrosome reaction.

When the ability of sperm to adhere (attach) and bind to the zona pellucida of cumulus-free eggs was assessed in vitro, no significant difference was observed among Acr +/+,Acr +/−, and Acr −/− mouse sperm. Immunocytochemical analysis demonstrated that the release of several acrosomal proteins from the acrosome of Acr −/− mouse sperm was significantly delayed during the calcium ionophore- and solubilized zona pellucida-induced acrosome reaction, despite normal membrane vesiculation. These data indicate that the delayed sperm penetration of the zona pellucida in the Acr −/− mouse results from the altered rate of protein dispersal from the acrosome and provide the first evidence that the major role of acrosin is to accelerate the dispersal of acrosomal components during acrosome reaction. The acrosome reaction of sperm, a fusion (vesiculation) event between the overlying plasma and outer acrosomal membranes, occurs following the binding of sperm to the zona pellucida (ZP), 1The abbreviations used are: ZP, zona pellucida; ABC, avidin-biotin peroxidase complex; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; mAb, monoclonal antibody. an extracellular glycoprotein matrix surrounding the egg. This exocytotic reaction is required for fertilization, because only acrosome-reacted sperm are capable of penetrating ZP and of fusing with the egg plasma membrane (for review see Ref. 1Yanagimachi R. Knobil E. Neill J. The Physiology of Reproduction. Raven Press, New York1994: 189-317Google Scholar). The acrosomal components, including hydrolytic enzymes, are released by the acrosome reaction and then interact initially with ZP to facilitate the sperm penetration of the glycoprotein matrix. Acrosin, an endoprotease with a trypsin-like substrate specificity, is localized in the acrosomal matrix as an enzymatically inactive zymogen, proacrosin, that is then converted into the active form as a consequence of the acrosome reaction (2Hedrick J.L. Urch U.A. Hardy D.M. Whitaker J.R. Sonnet P.E. Biocatalysis in Agricultural Biotechnology. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1989: 215-229Google Scholar, 3Baba T. Kashiwabara S. Watanabe K.

Genet. 1991; 87: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The physiological role of acrosin in fertilization has long been believed to be the limited proteolysis of the ZP, thus enabling the sperm to penetrate the ZP. Using homologous recombination, we have successfully produced male mice carrying a disruptive mutation in the acrosin gene (Acr) and found that the mouse sperm lacking the acrosin protease activity (Acr −/−) still penetrate ZP and normally fertilize the egg (5Baba T. Azuma S. Kashiwabara S. Toyoda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31845-31849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data provide evidence that acrosin is not essential for sperm penetration of the ZP. However, as compared with Acr +/+ and Acr +/− mice,Acr −/− mouse sperm showed a delay in sperm penetration of the ZP solely at the early stages after insemination (5Baba T. Azuma S. Kashiwabara S. Toyoda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31845-31849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recent report using separate lines of Acr −/− mice (6Adham I.M. Nayernia K. Engel W. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1997; 46: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) has confirmed that sperm lacking acrosin exhibit the delayed fertilization. Thus, these results imply that acrosin plays an important role prior to the sperm penetration of ZP, possibly at the time of the acrosome reaction, although the participation of acrosin in the ZP hydrolysis cannot be ruled out completely. To elucidate the role of acrosin in fertilization, we have examined the involvement of acrosin in the acrosome reaction of sperm, using Acr +/+, Acr +/−, and Acr −/− male mice. Immunocytochemical analysis indicated that the release of several acrosomal proteins from the acrosome of Acr −/− mouse sperm during the acrosome reaction was significantly delayed. Thus, acrosin likely accelerates the dispersal of proteins from the sperm acrosome. Monoclonal antibodies against a mouse sperm protein (termed mAb OBF13) and an intra-acrosomal 155-kDa mouse protein (mAb MC101) were prepared as described previously (7Okabe M. Takada K. Adachi T. Kohama Y. Mimura T. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1986; 9: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 8Toshimori K. Tanii I. Araki S. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Anti-mouse sp56 monoclonal antibody 7C5 (mAb sp56) was originally purchased from QED Biologicals (La Jolla, CA) by Dr. George L. Gerton and was kindly provided by him. Rabbit anti-recombinant mouse PH2O antiserum was a gift of Dr. Paul Primakoff. p-Aminobenzamidine and calcium ionophore A23187 were purchased from Sigma and Dojindo Laboratories (Kumamoto, Japan), respectively. Acr +/+,Acr +/−, and Acr −/− male mice were obtained by mating between Acr +/− males and females, as described previously (5Baba T. Azuma S. Kashiwabara S. Toyoda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31845-31849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fresh cauda epididymal sperm from male mice (2–3 months old) were dispersed in a 0.2-ml drop of modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution (TYH medium) containing glucose, sodium pyruvate, bovine albumin, and antibiotics (9Toyoda Y. Yokoyama M. Hoshi T. Jpn. J. Anim. Reprod. 1971; 16: 147-151Crossref Google Scholar) at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air until the medium became turbid (usually 15 min). The sperm were then capacitated by incubation at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air for 90 min. Female B6C3F1 mice (2–3 months old, Japan SLC, Inc., Shizuoka, Japan) were superovulated following intraperitoneal injections of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin and human chorionic gonadotropin at a 48-h interval. Eggs associated with cumulus cells were recovered approximately 15 h after human chorionic gonadotropin injection and placed under warm mineral oil in a plastic Petri dish containing TYH medium (0.2 ml), treated at room temperature for 5 min with hyaluronidase (Sigma Type I-S, 150 units/ml) to remove the cumulus cells, and washed with TYH medium. The eight cumulus-free eggs and two 2-cell embryos in TYH medium (5 μl) were incubated with 5 μl of the capacitated sperm suspension (2,000 sperm) at 37 °C for 30 min, transferred to a 100-μl drop of fresh TYH medium, and washed by pipetting (10–15 times). After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, the number of sperm bound to the egg ZP was counted using a Leica DMIRBE phytomicroscope. The 2-cell embryos were used as an internal negative control for nonspecific binding (10Endo Y. Lee M.A. Kopf G.S. Dev. Biol. 1988; 129: 12-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and the number of the bound sperm per 2-cell embryo was less than 4 under the above conditions. Capacitated cauda epididymal sperm (4 × 106 sperm/ml) in 0.2 ml of TYH medium were induced to undergo acrosome reaction by addition of calcium ionophore A23187 at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml followed by incubation at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air. An aliquot (50 μl each) was taken 3, 15, or 30 min after the incubation, transferred into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube, and then centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 min. The sperm pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Solubilized ZP was prepared from the superovulated eggs of 2-month-old female ICR mice by the already described method (10Endo Y. Lee M.A. Kopf G.S. Dev. Biol. 1988; 129: 12-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) with a minor modification. Briefly, the cumulus-free, ZP-intact eggs (400–500) were incubated for 20 min in a bovine serum albumin-free acidified TYH medium (pH 2.2) at a concentration of 10 eggs/μl. After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant containing the solubilized ZP (20 μl each) was neutralized with 16 μl of 62.5 mm Hepes/TYH medium (pH 7.7) containing 8 mg/ml bovine serum albumin to give a final pH of approximately 7.4. To the 36-μl solution, 4 μl of capacitated sperm suspension (1.5 × 107 sperm/ml) were added, and the mixture was then incubated for 60 min at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air. Sperm suspensions were placed onto glass slides that had been coated with VECTABOND (Vector laboratories, Burlingame, CA), treated with PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde or with PBS alone on ice for 30 min, and washed three times with PBS. For indirect immunofluorescent staining, the slides were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 5% fetal bovine serum overnight, washed with PBS, and treated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgA + IgG + IgM (Cappel, Durham, NC) for 4 h. After washing with PBS, the slides were observed using a Leitz DMRXE fluoromicroscope. Immunoperoxidase staining was also carried out by the avidin-biotin peroxidase complex (ABC) method (11Hsu S.-M. Soban E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1982; 30: 1079-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) using a Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories). The sperm samples on slides with or without fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde were treated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 30 min, washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, and blocked with 1.5% normal goat serum in PBS for 30 min and with an avidin/biotin blocking kit (Vector laboratories) for 30 min at room temperature. The slides were incubated in a primary antibody solution at room temperature for 3 h, washed three times with the above blocking solution, and then treated with biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG + IgM (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) or anti-rabbit IgG (Vector laboratories) for 30 min followed by an ABC solution containing horseradish peroxidase-conjugated avidin (Vector laboratories) for 30 min. After washing with PBS, the sperm samples were stained using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as a chromogen, mounted, and viewed under an Olympus BX50 microscope. As described previously (5Baba T. Azuma S. Kashiwabara S. Toyoda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31845-31849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a remarkable delay in the sperm penetration of ZP was observed in Acr −/− mouse on in vitro fertilization within 60 min after insemination. To examine whether the delay is caused by a reduced ability of Acr −/− mouse sperm for adhesion (attachment) or binding to ZP, the cumulus-free, ZP-intact eggs were incubated with capacitated sperm. No significant difference of the ability to adhere to ZP was apparently observed among Acr +/+,Acr +/−, and Acr −/− mouse sperm at 15 and 30 min after insemination. Moreover, the sperm binding to ZP at 30 min after the incubation were found to be 28.5 ± 9.7, 38.2 ± 9.2, and 26.7 ± 7.7 (means of sperm numbers/egg ± S.D.) in Acr +/+,Acr +/−, and Acr −/− mice, respectively. These data indicate that Acr −/− mouse sperm still possess a normal capacity for adhesion and binding to ZP and imply that the delay in the sperm penetration of ZP in Acr −/− mouse is implicated in a physiological event occurring after the sperm bind ZP. Capacitated Acr +/+ and Acr −/− mouse sperm were treated with calcium ionophore A23187, and the time course of protein release from the acrosome was monitored by indirect immunofluorescent staining using two monoclonal antibodies against mouse acrosomal proteins (mAb sp56 (12Cheng A.

Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); Fig. 1). mAb OBF13 (7Okabe M. Takada K. Adachi T. Kohama Y. Mimura T. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1986; 9: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), which immunoreacts both with a protein located at the acrosome cap region of capacitated sperm and with the same protein redistributed over the entire sperm head after acrosome reaction (14Kawai Y. Hama T. Mayumi T. Okabe M. Matzno S. Kohama Y. Mimura T. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1989; 16: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), was also used as a control. The immunofluorescent staining patterns of mAb sp56 and mAb MC101 disappeared from the Acr +/+ sperm acrosome as the incubation time elapsed, whereas the signals still remained in noticeable numbers of the acrosome of Acr −/− mouse sperm even at 30 min after addition of the ionophore. As expected, mAb OBF13 initially immunostained the acrosomal cap region, and the signals quickly spread over the sperm head. There was no difference of the immunostaining pattern in mAb OBF13 between Acr +/+ and Acr −/− mouse sperm. Thus, these observations clearly demonstrate that the dispersal of the antigenic proteins recognized by mAb sp56 and mAb MC101 is delayed only in Acr −/− mouse sperm, despite apparently normal membrane vesiculation during the acrosome reaction. To assess the acrosomal status more clearly, capacitated sperm with or without ionophore treatment were stained by the ABC method (11Hsu S.-M. Soban E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1982; 30: 1079-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) using four different antibodies, including polyclonal anti-PH2O antibody (Fig. 2). As found in indirect immunostaining, some of the stained signals in Acr +/+ and Acr −/− mouse sperm were lost from the acrosome by the ionophore treatment (data not shown for Acr +/− mouse sperm). The sperm were divided into two groups by the following criteria: (i) sperm that still contained the antigens recognized by the antibodies in the acrosome, in spite of the fact that they were acrosome-intact, and initiated the acrosome reaction or had already acrosome-reacted and (ii) sperm that contained no signal of the antigens in the acrosome. When anti-PH2O antibody was used, several regions of sperm were stained; the acrosome and sperm head were strongly and weakly stained, respectively. This result may be due to the fact that PH2O is present in the sperm as two forms: a soluble form locating in the acrosome, and a membrane-anchored form on the plasma and inner acrosomal membranes (15Hunnicutt G.R. Mahan K. Lathrop W.F. Romarao C.S. Myles D.G. Primakoff P. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 1343-1349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hunnicutt G.R. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 55: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Although the sperm tail was also stained by anti-PH2O antibody, the signal may be nonspecific. As shown in Fig. 3, the sperm acrosome immunostained by four antibodies following ionophore treatment was quantified according to the above criteria. The number of the acrosome immunostained rapidly decreased in Acr +/+ and Acr +/− mouse sperm with the passage of time, and approximately 90% of the sperm did not show any signal in the acrosome after the 30-min ionophore treatment. However, the disappearance of the signals in Acr −/− sperm acrosome was obviously delayed when mAb sp56, mAb MC101, and anti-PH2O antibody were used. In the case of mAb OBF13, no significant difference in the pattern of the signal disappearance was found among Acr +/+, Acr +/−, and Acr −/− mouse sperm. These results confirm the delay of the dispersal of the acrosomal proteins in Acr −/− mouse sperm during the ionophore-induced acrosome reaction. The number of the acrosome stained by the four antibodies was estimated to be 79–86% of total Acr +/+, Acr +/−, or Acr −/− mouse sperm without the ionophore treatment. The reduced numbers may result from the possibility that 14–21% of the sperm have undergone the spontaneous acrosome reaction during capacitation. Moreover, almost 40% of Acr +/+ and Acr +/− mouse sperm without the ionophore treatment exhibited no signal in the acrosome stained by anti-PH2O antibody. The reason for the unusual observation is not clear at the present time. p-Aminobenzamidine, a competitive inhibitor for trypsin and acrosin, has been reported to inhibit not the acrosome reaction itself, but the dispersal of the acrosomal matrix and sperm penetration of ZP (17Green D.P.L. J. Cell Sci. 1978; 32: 153-164PubMed Google Scholar, 18Meizel S. Lui C.W. J. Exp. Zool. 1976; 195: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 19Fraser L.R. J. Reprod.

Reprod. 1985; 32: 451-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). When the release of proteins, which were recognized by four antibodies, from the acrosome of Acr +/+ mouse sperm treated with ionophore was examined in the presence of 1 mm p-aminobenzamidine, the patterns of the signal disappearance were similar to those in Acr −/− mouse sperm in the absence of the acrosin inhibitor (Figs. 3 and 4). These data verify the delayed release of several proteins from the Acr −/− sperm acrosome during ionophore-induced acrosome reaction (Fig. 3). Because calcium ionophore A23187 is not a physiological inducer of acrosome reaction, we examined protein release from sperm acrosome following solubilized ZP treatment (TableI). Approximately 19–25% of Acr +/+ mouse sperm lost the signals stained by mAb sp56, mAb MC101, and mAb OBF13 from the acrosome at 60 min after addition of the solubilized ZP. However, the number of the unstained sperm was still 7–8% in Acr −/− mouse when mAb sp56 and mAb MC101 were used. Thus, the Acr −/− mouse sperm possess the reduced ability for the protein dispersal from the acrosome during the ZP-induced acrosome reaction.Table IDispersal of acrosomal proteins from acrosome following treatment of sperm with solubilized zona pellucidaMale mouseSperm acrosome unstained by monoclonal antibody1-aZP from superovulated eggs was solubilized in 20 μl of a bovine serum albumin-free acidified TYH medium (pH 2.2) and neutralized with 16 μl of 62.5 mm Hepes/TYH medium (pH 7.7) containing 8 mg/ml bovine serum albumin.

Open table in a new tab This paper demonstrates that the dispersal of acrosomal proteins from the acrosome is delayed in Acr −/− mouse sperm during either calcium ionophore-induced or solubilized ZP-induced acrosome reaction (Fig. 3 and Table I). These data are consistent with the fact that only Acr −/− mouse sperm show a delayed sperm penetration of ZP at the early stages of in vitro fertilization (5Baba T. Azuma S. Kashiwabara S. Toyoda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31845-31849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it may be concluded that acrosin plays a major role in acceleration of the dispersal of acrosomal proteins in vivo and that the decreased ability of Acr −/− mouse sperm to disperse acrosomal proteins is responsible for the delayed sperm penetration of ZP. However, the patterns of the signal disappearance from the acrosome in Acr −/− mouse sperm were distinguished from one another by the antibody used (Fig. 3). In particular, approximately 50% of Acr −/− mouse sperm still had the mAb sp56-positive signal in the acrosome even at 30 min after the ionophore treatment. This differential dispersal of the acrosomal proteins from the acrosome may be correlated with the localization and associated state of each of the proteins within the acrosomal matrix, as reported previously (13Foster J.A. Friday B.B. Maulit M.T. Blobel C. Winfrey V.P. Olson G.E. Kim K.-S. Gerton G.L. J. Biol.

In guinea pig, the sperm acrosome can be ultrastructurally separated into three domains (M1, M2, and M3) by electron density (23Olson G.E. Winfrey V.P. Winer M.A. Davenport G.R. Gamete Res. 1987; 17: 77-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Proacrosin is preferentially localized in the most electron-dense domains (M2 and M3) presumably in a state firmly associated with other matrix proteins (17Green D.P.L. J.

Oda M.N. Friend D.S. Huang Jr., T.T.F. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 759-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 26de Vries J.W.A. Willemson R. Geuze H.J. Eur. J.

Thus, acrosin, which is converted from proacrosin by autoactivation during the acrosome reaction, probably prefers to hydrolyze a core protein(s) of a stable acrosomal matrix, such as AM50 (25Westbrook-Case V.A. Winfrey V.P. Olson G.E. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 51: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 29Noland T.D. Friday B.B. Maulit M.T. Gerton G.L. J. Biol.

Moreover, it is still reasonable to consider the possibility that acrosin possesses a selectivity for each of the acrosomal proteins in the matrix dispersal. If so, we can speculate that acrosin may act to destroy the physiological function of other acrosomal proteins and/or to give a function to latent forms of the proteins by proteolysis as well as to hydrolyze the core proteins forming the acrosomal matrix during acrosome reaction. Our data provide the first evidence that the role of acrosin is to accelerate the dispersal of acrosomal components during acrosome reaction. However, we should not consider that the protein dispersal is modulated solely by acrosin, because the acrosomal proteins are released with a time delay, and their dispersal is not completely blocked in the absence of acrosin (Fig. 3 and Table I) or in the presence of p-aminobenzamidine (Fig. 4). Moreover, we have found that Acr −/− mouse sperm are incapable of fertilizing the egg in the presence of p-aminobenzamidine. 2K. Yamagata, K. Murayama, N. Kohno, S. Kashiwabara, and T. Baba, submitted for publication. Therefore, a protease(s) sensitive to the inhibitor must be present in the sperm to enable it to penetrate the ZP. This protease may compensate for the insufficient function(s) of the Acr −/− mouse sperm due to the lack of acrosin. Thus, to elucidate the sperm function in fertilization, the identification and characterization of the novel sperm protease(s) remains to be accomplished. We thank Drs. P. Primakoff and G. L. Gerton for kind gifts of antibodies and critical reading of this manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2119465831,"The ErbB signaling network consists of four transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases and more than a dozen ligands sharing an epidermal growth factor (EGF) motif. The multiplicity of ErbB-specific ligands is incompletely understood in terms of signal specificity because all ErbB molecules signal through partially overlapping pathways. Here we addressed the action of epiregulin, a recently isolated ligand of ErbB-1. By employing a set of factor-dependent cell lines engineered to express individual ErbBs or their combinations, we found that epiregulin is the broadest specificity EGF-like ligand so far characterized: not only does it stimulate homodimers of both ErbB-1 and ErbB-4, it also activates all possible heterodimeric ErbB complexes. Consistent with its relaxed selectivity, epiregulin binds the various receptor combinations with an affinity that is approximately 100-fold lower than the affinity of ligands with more stringent selectivity, including EGF. Nevertheless, epiregulin's action upon most receptor combinations transmits a more potent mitogenic signal than does EGF. This remarkable discrepancy between binding affinity and bioactivity is permitted by a mechanism that prevents receptor down-regulation, and results in a weak, but prolonged, state of receptor activation. The ErbB signaling network consists of four transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases and more than a dozen ligands sharing an epidermal growth factor (EGF) motif. The multiplicity of ErbB-specific ligands is incompletely understood in terms of signal specificity because all ErbB molecules signal through partially overlapping pathways. Here we addressed the action of epiregulin, a recently isolated ligand of ErbB-1. By employing a set of factor-dependent cell lines engineered to express individual ErbBs or their combinations, we found that epiregulin is the broadest specificity EGF-like ligand so far characterized: not only does it stimulate homodimers of both ErbB-1 and ErbB-4, it also activates all possible heterodimeric ErbB complexes. Consistent with its relaxed selectivity, epiregulin binds the various receptor combinations with an affinity that is approximately 100-fold lower than the affinity of ligands with more stringent selectivity, including EGF. Nevertheless, epiregulin's action upon most receptor combinations transmits a more potent mitogenic signal than does EGF. This remarkable discrepancy between binding affinity and bioactivity is permitted by a mechanism that prevents receptor down-regulation, and results in a weak, but prolonged, state of receptor activation. Various biological processes are controlled by intercellular interactions that are mediated by polypeptide growth factors. Examples include embryonic development, neuronal functions, hematopoiesis, and pathological situations, like wound healing and malignant transformation. The mechanism transmitting extracellular signals ultimately starts with binding of the growth factor to a cell surface receptor, that in many cases carries an intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (1Van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). These receptors fall into several subgroups sharing structural and functional characteristics. Each subgroup of receptors specifically recognizes a family of structurally homologous growth factors. Perhaps the most striking multiplicity of related growth factors is exemplified by the epidermal growth factor (EGF) 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; IL-3, interleukin 3; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide; NDF, Neu differentiation factor; TGF-α, transforming growth factor α. 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; IL-3, interleukin 3; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide; NDF, Neu differentiation factor; TGF-α, transforming growth factor α. family of molecules (2Salomon D.S. Brandt R. Ciardiello F. Normanno N. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1995; 19: 183-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar). This six cysteine-containing motif of 45–60 amino acids is shared by all members of the family, and it functions as the receptor binding portion of the molecule. Currently there are four known receptors for EGF-like ligands, constituting the ErbB subgroup of receptor tyrosine kinases (also known as HER, or type I receptor tyrosine kinases (3Alroy I. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar)). Whereas ErbB-1 binds many ligands, including EGF, transforming growth factor α (TGFα), and amphiregulin, both ErbB-3 and ErbB-4 bind to a family of isoforms, collectively known as neuregulins (also called Neu differentiation factors, heregulins, glial growth factors, and acetylcholine receptor inducing activity) (4Tzahar E. Levkowitz G. Karunagaran D. Yi L. Peles E. Lavi S. Chang D. Liu N. Yayon A. Wen D. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25226-25233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A related group of molecules, termed NRG2, binds to the same two receptors (5Chang H. Riese D. Gilbert W. Stern D.F. McMahan U.J.

Two other ligands, betacellulin (9Riese D.J. Bermingham Y. van Raaij T.M. Buckley S. Plowman G.D. Stern D.F. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 345-353PubMed Google Scholar), and the heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (10Elenius K. Paul S. Allison G. Sun G.K. Klagsbrun M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6071-6076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) bind to both ErbB-1 and ErbB-4. Interestingly, the most oncogenic member of the ErbB family, ErbB-2, binds none of the EGF-like ligands with high affinity. However, recent studies indicate that ErbB-2 functions as a shared low affinity receptor that binds the apparently bivalent EGF-like ligands with low affinity, once they are presented by either one of the high affinity receptors (12Tzahar E. Pinkas-Kramarski R. Moyer J. Klapper L.N. Alroy I. Levkowitz G. Shelly M. Henis S. Eisenstein M. Ratzkin B.J. Sela M. Andrews G.C. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4938-4950Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar).Despite shared receptor specificity, it is clear that the multiple EGF-like ligands play distinct physiological roles: gene targeting experiments showed that loss of function of ErbB-1 (13Threadgill D.W.

Nature. 1995; 376: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar) more severely impairs embryonic development than inactivation of one of its ligands, TGFα (16Luetteke N.C. Qiu T.H. Peiffer R.L. Oliver P. Smithies O. Lee D.C. Cell. 1993; 73: 263-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). On the other hand, targeting of either neuregulin (17Meyer D. Birchmeier C. Nature. 1995; 378: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar), ErbB-2 (18Lee K.F. Simon H. Chen H. Bates B. Hung M.C. Hauser C. Nature. 1995; 378: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar), or ErbB-4 (19Gassmann M. Casagranda F. Orioli D. Simon H. Lai C. Klein R. Lemke G. Nature. 1995; 378: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar), resulted in the same embryonic cardiac defect, indicating that activation of an ErbB-2/ErbB-4 receptor combination is exclusively mediated by neuregulin in the developing heart. That ligand multiplicity related to tissue-specific expression is suggested by distinct spatial and temporal patterns of expression of the various ligands (reviewed in Ref. 2Salomon D.S. Brandt R. Ciardiello F. Normanno N. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1995; 19: 183-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar), and also by experiments with transgenic mice demonstrating tissue selectivity of specific ErbB-1 ligands (20Jhappan C. Stahle C. Harkins R.N. Fausto N. Smith G.H. Merlino G.T. Cell. 1991; 61: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Part of the physiological selectivity of ligands with shared receptors may be attributed to their domains that flank the EGF-like motif, including the presence of heparin-binding sites, sugars, and specific protein motifs.In this study we addressed the functional identity of epiregulin, a recently identified ligand of ErbB-1 (21Toyoda H. Komurasaki T. Uchida D. Takayama Y. Isobe T. Okuyama T. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7495-7500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 22Toyoda H. Komurasaki T. Ikeda Y. Yoshimoto M. Morimoto S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Like TGFα, this ligand was originally isolated from the medium of transformed fibroblasts, and its transmembrane precursor carries only short sequences that flank the EGF-like motif. Epiregulin expression is relatively restricted; except for macrophages and placenta, other human tissues contain very low or no epiregulin transcripts, but most types of epithelial tumors are characterized by high expression of the growth factor (23Toyoda H. Komurasaki T. Uchida D. Morimoto S. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Although epiregulin competed with EGF on the binding to ErbB-1, it displayed relatively low affinity to ErbB-1-overexpressing cells (21Toyoda H. Komurasaki T. Uchida D. Takayama Y. Isobe T. Okuyama T. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7495-7500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the factor displayed dual biological function in vitro: it stimulated proliferation of fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and hepatocytes, but inhibited growth of several tumor-derived epithelial cell lines (21Toyoda H. Komurasaki T. Uchida D. Takayama Y. Isobe T. Okuyama T. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7495-7500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). These observations, and the emerging broader than expected specificity of EGF-like ligands to ErbB proteins (reviewed in Ref. 24Pinkas-Kramarski R. Alroy I. Yarden Y. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neopl. 1997; 2: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), prompted us to analyze the selectivity of epiregulin to ErbB proteins. Here we report that epiregulin is a pan-ErbB ligand that activates all ligand-stimulatable combinations of ErbB proteins with variable efficiency. Strikingly, in a model cellular system, epiregulin more potently activates mitogenesis than does EGF, although the affinity of EGF to ErbB-1 is approximately 100-fold higher. This superiority of epiregulin is independent on the presence of other ErbB proteins, and appears to result from a relatively inefficient mechanism of receptor inactivation.DISCUSSIONThe evolutionary pathway of the ErbB signaling module, from worms (48Kornfeld K. Trends Genetics. 1997; 13: 55-61Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and flies (49Perrimon N. Perkins L.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) to mammals, indicates that duplication of genes encoding EGF-like ligands preceded multiplication of receptor-encoding genes. Despite multiplicity of ligands and receptors, it is clear that the downstream signaling mechanisms, namely a linear cascade leading to MAPK activation, has been conserved. Thus, to gain functional diversity, variations on the common theme of ligand-ErbB-MAPK evolved throughout evolution. Examination of the interactions between one of the mammalian ErbB ligands, epiregulin, and various combinations of the four ErbB proteins uncovered two novel features of the evolved module, that are schematically presented in Fig. 8. First, epiregulin is a broad-specificity ligand that activates all eight ligand-stimulatable combinations of ErbBs. Second, despite its extremely low affinity, signaling by epiregulin is more potent than the bioactivity of a high affinity ligand, namely, EGF. The mechanisms underlying these two features, and their functional implications, are discussed below.Pan-ErbB Specificity of EpiregulinThe four mammalian ErbB proteins can form 10 homo- and heterodimeric complexes, including an ErbB-3 homodimer, which is biologically inactive (29Pinkas-Kramarski R. Soussan L. Waterman H. Levkowitz G. Alroy I. Klapper L. Lavi S. Seger R. Ratzkin B. Sela M. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2452-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar), and an ErbB-2 homodimer whose formation may be driven by receptor overexpression (50Brandt-Rauf P.W. Pincus M.R. Chen J.M. J. Protein Chem. 1989; 8: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), or by a transmembrane oncogenic mutation (51Weiner D.B. Liu J. Cohen J.A. Williams W.V. Greene M.I. Nature. 1989; 339: 230-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Epiregulin can signal through all but these two homodimeric combinations of ErbBs (Fig. 8). This broad specificity is unique; no other EGF-like ligand has such a wide selection of receptors. However, due to its broad selectivity, none of the receptors of epiregulin binds it with high affinity (Figs. 5 and 6).One of the most surprising observations made in the course of the present study is the ability of both epiregulin and EGF to activate ErbB-4 when this receptor is singly expressed. This observation is reminiscent of several recent reports that identified betacellulin (9Riese D.J. Bermingham Y. van Raaij T.M. Buckley S. Plowman G.D. Stern D.F. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 345-353PubMed Google Scholar) and heparin-binding EGF (10Elenius K. Paul S. Allison G. Sun G.K. Klagsbrun M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1268-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 11Beerli R.R. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6071-6076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) as ligands of ErbB-4. Conceivably, ErbB-1 and ErbB-4 share some structural features at their ligand-binding sites, thus defining a subgroup of direct ErbB-1 ligands, including EGF, betacellulin, and heparin-binding EGF, but excluding TGFα and amphiregulin, as ligands with dual receptor specificity. Nevertheless, like all other interactions of epiregulin, binding to ErbB-4 is characterized by very low affinity; the corresponding dissociation constant is estimated to be in the micromolar range (D4 and CB4 panels in Fig. 6). The affinity of the other direct receptor of epiregulin, ErbB-1, is only 10-fold better, much higher than the nanomolar or lower apparent K d of EGF or NDF binding to their direct receptors (Fig. 6 A). However, receptor combinations containing ErbB-1 and ErbB-4 are not the only receptors for epiregulin; although this ligand does not interact with isolated components of the ErbB-2/ErbB-3 heterodimer, it can efficiently stimulate the respective receptor combination (D23 panels in Figs. 2 A and 3). This is probably mediated by an extremely low affinity of epiregulin to ErbB-3 (D3 panel in Fig. 6), and by a cooperative effect of the coexpressed ErbB-2. This effect of the ligand-less ErbB-2 is extended to heterodimers containing the direct epiregulin receptors, namely ErbB-1 and ErbB-4; cooperativity is exemplified by the relatively strong binding of epiregulin to cells coexpressing ErbB-1 and ErbB-2 (but not to cells co-expressing ErbB-1 and ErbB-3, Fig. 5), and by the ability of ErbB-2 to augment epiregulin binding to ErbB-4 (compare D4 and D24 panels in Fig. 6). This binding effect is translated to enhanced signaling by the ErbB-2/ErbB-4 heterodimer relative to the ErbB-4 homodimer, and is apparently more relevant to epiregulin than to EGF (compare E4 and D24 panels in Fig. 2 A). The mechanism underlying signal amplification by ErbB-2, a process that is significant to tumors overexpressing this receptor, has been previously attributed to its ability to decelerate dissociation of NDF and EGF from ErbB-2-containing heterodimers (25Klapper L.N. Vaisman N. Hurwitz E. Pinkas-Kramarski R. Yarden Y. Sela M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2099-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 52Karunagaran D. Tzahar E. Beerli R.R. Chen X. Graus-Porta D. Ratzkin B.J. Seger R. Hynes N.E. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). The present study apparently extends this mechanism to epiregulin.How does epiregulin recognize all six heterodimeric complexes of ErbBs? According to a ligand bivalence model (12Tzahar E. Pinkas-Kramarski R. Moyer J. Klapper L.N. Alroy I. Levkowitz G. Shelly M. Henis S. Eisenstein M. Ratzkin B.J. Sela M. Andrews G.C. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4938-4950Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), a notion supported by recent affinity labeling studies (53Summerfield A.E. Hudnall A.K. Lukas T.J. Guyer C.A. Staros J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19656-19659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and by measurements of the stoichiometry of ligand-receptor interactions in solution (54Lemmon M.A. Bu Z. Ladbury J.E. Zhou M. Pinchasi D. Lax I. Engelman D.E. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), epiregulin carries a high affinity binding site whose specificity is limited to ErbB-1 and ErbB-4. Another site that is structurally distinct and may localize to the C-terminal half of the ligand, binds with broad specificity but low affinity to other ErbB proteins, including ErbB-1 and ErbB-4 (thus allowing homodimer formation), as well as to ErbB-2 and ErbB-3, to confer heterodimer formation. Nevertheless, as is the case with EGF and NDF, the putative “low-affinity/broad-specificity” site of epiregulin apparently prefers ErbB-2 over other receptors. This model explains how ErbB-2 augments epiregulin signaling through the ErbB-2/ErbB-3 and ErbB-2/ErbB-4 heterodimers.Mechanism of Signaling Superiority of Low Affinity Ligand-ErbB InteractionsIn their original analysis of epiregulin interactions with various cell types, Toyoda and collaborators (21Toyoda H. Komurasaki T. Uchida D. Takayama Y. Isobe T. Okuyama T. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7495-7500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) found that this ligand was more mitogenic than EGF for several types of normal cells, although epiregulin binding to cells of another type (the A-431 epidermoid carcinoma line) displayed a 10-fold lower affinity. Potentially, this discrepancy could be due to the different repertoires of ErbB proteins expressed on the surface of the different lines of cultured cells that these authors examined. However, our studies with engineered myeloid cells excluded this possibility, because epiregulin's superiority was retained also by cells singly expressing ErbB-1. In fact, our results extend the discrepancy between binding affinity and bioactivity to signaling through ErbB-4. Thus, epiregulin is a relatively potent stimulator of mitogenesis through both ErbB-1 and ErbB-4, despite being a very low affinity ligand of these two receptors (D1 and E4 panels in Figs.2 A and 6 A). The observation that ErbB-1 phosphorylation by epiregulin is weaker than the effect of EGF (Fig. 4 A), implies that receptor activation is not the sole determinant of signaling potency. Instead, differences in the inactivation process may be critical: apart from differential recruitment of both tyrosine-specific phosphatases (55Faure R. Baquiran G. Bergeron J.J.M. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11215-11221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the negative regulator c-Cbl (56Levkowitz G. Klapper L.N. Tzahar E. Freywald A. Sela M. Yarden Y. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1117-1125PubMed Google Scholar), endocytosis of ligand-receptor complexes is a major process that leads to inactivation of growth factor signaling (reviewed in Ref. 57Sorkin A. Waters C.M. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Our initial studies of this aspect of epiregulin's action indicated that this ligand, unlike EGF, mediates limited, if any, down-regulation of ErbB-1 (Fig. 7). Additional analyses raised the possibility that epiregulin undergoes internalization, but its receptor rapidly recycles to the cell surface (Fig. 7). Presumably, the very low affinity of epiregulin to ErbB-1 is insufficient to direct this receptor to lysosomal degradation, either because phosphorylation on tyrosine residues, which is essential for rapid internalization (58Sorkin A. Helin K. Waters C.M. Carpenter G. Beguinot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8672-8678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is relatively inefficient, or because the ligand dissociates very rapidly. It is relevant that mutations of another receptor, that stabilize ligand-receptor interactions at the moderately acidic conditions of early endosomes, accelerate receptor degradation and prevent recycling (59Davis C.G. Goldstein J.L. Sudhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Nature. 1987; 326: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 60Kadowaki H. Kadowaki T. Cama A. Marcus-Samuels B. Rovira A. Bevins C.L. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21285-21296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the strength of ligand binding is critical for receptor routing. This mechanism of epiregulin/ErbB-1 interactions is expected to promote a relatively weak level of receptor activation, but due to receptor recycling, repeated association-dissociation cycles may result in prolongation of signaling. In support of this model, we observed an overall lower activation of MAPK by epiregulin, but this was more prolonged than in the case of EGF (D1 panel in Fig. 4 A). Variations of the proposed mechanism have previously been reported: in the case of TGFα, whose binding affinity is comparable to that of EGF, the more rapid dissociation of the ligand-receptor complex in an acidic endosomal compartment drives ErbB-1 to recycling (45Ebner R. Derynck R. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 599-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This is contrasted with the lysosomal destination taken by an EGF-bound ErbB-1. As a result, signaling by TGFα is often more potent than that of EGF. An even closer example is provided by a mutant of EGF that was engineered to enhance the mitogenic potency of the growth factor for biotechnological applications (61Reddy C.C. Niyogi S.K. Wells A. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. Nature Biotech. 1996; 14: 1696-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This mutant achieved mitogenic superiority through a combination of a 50-fold lower affinity, longer retention in culture supernatants, and a very limited receptor down-regulation.In addition to the question how wide is the relevance of our findings to other growth factors whose binding affinities are very low, several other interesting questions are left open. The exceptionally broad specificity of epiregulin joins other observations that collectively imply non-redundancy of the multiple EGF-like ligands (reviewed in Ref.62Tzahar E. Yarden Y. BBA Rev. Cancer. 1998; 1377 (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Evidently, each ligand differs from other members of its family by a unique preference for certain ErbB proteins. This, however, does not explain how different ligands mediate mitogenesis on some cells, but differentiation (37Bacus S.S. Gudkov A.V. Zelnick C.R. Chin D. Stern R. Stancovski I. Peles E. Ben-Baruch N. Farbstein H. Lupu R. Wen D. Sela M. Yarden Y. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5251-5261PubMed Google Scholar), survival (63Marikovsky M. Lavi S. Pinkas-Kramarski R. Karunagaran D. Liu N. Wen D. Yarden Y. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1403-1411PubMed Google Scholar), or cell motility (10Elenius K. Paul S. Allison G. Sun G.K. Klagsbrun M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1268-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) on other types of cells, although in all cases the MAPK pathway is recruited. Even more difficult to reason is the inhibitory activity of epiregulin on certain epithelial cell lines (21Toyoda H. Komurasaki T. Uchida D. Takayama Y. Isobe T. Okuyama T. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7495-7500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), because all of its receptors turned out to be stimulatory for myeloid cells (Figs. 2 A and3). Perhaps a cell type-specific component lying downstream of ErbBs determines the nature of cellular response. Another puzzling issue is the contrast between the broad selectivity of epiregulin for ErbBs, and its very limited pattern of expression (23Toyoda H. Komurasaki T. Uchida D. Morimoto S. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This and other questions will require in vivo studies of epiregulin's physiological role. Various biological processes are controlled by intercellular interactions that are mediated by polypeptide growth factors. Examples include embryonic development, neuronal functions, hematopoiesis, and pathological situations, like wound healing and malignant transformation. The mechanism transmitting extracellular signals ultimately starts with binding of the growth factor to a cell surface receptor, that in many cases carries an intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (1Van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). These receptors fall into several subgroups sharing structural and functional characteristics. Each subgroup of receptors specifically recognizes a family of structurally homologous growth factors. Perhaps the most striking multiplicity of related growth factors is exemplified by the epidermal growth factor (EGF) 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; IL-3, interleukin 3; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide; NDF, Neu differentiation factor; TGF-α, transforming growth factor α. 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; IL-3, interleukin 3; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide; NDF, Neu differentiation factor; TGF-α, transforming growth factor α. family of molecules (2Salomon D.S. Brandt R. Ciardiello F. Normanno N. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1995; 19: 183-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar). This six cysteine-containing motif of 45–60 amino acids is shared by all members of the family, and it functions as the receptor binding portion of the molecule. Currently there are four known receptors for EGF-like ligands, constituting the ErbB subgroup of receptor tyrosine kinases (also known as HER, or type I receptor tyrosine kinases (3Alroy I. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar)). Whereas ErbB-1 binds many ligands, including EGF, transforming growth factor α (TGFα), and amphiregulin, both ErbB-3 and ErbB-4 bind to a family of isoforms, collectively known as neuregulins (also called Neu differentiation factors, heregulins, glial growth factors, and acetylcholine receptor inducing activity) (4Tzahar E. Levkowitz G. Karunagaran D. Yi L. Peles E. Lavi S. Chang D. Liu N. Yayon A. Wen D. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25226-25233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

In this report, both biochemical and histochemical analyses demonstrate that the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a source of Aβ amyloid peptide, is enriched within caveolae. Caveolin-1, a principal component of caveolae, is physically associated with APP, and the cytoplasmic domain of APP directly participates in this binding. The characteristic C-terminal fragment that results from APP processing by α-secretase, an as yet unidentified enzyme that cleaves APP within the Aβ amyloid sequence, was also localized within these caveolae-enriched fractions. Further analysis by cell surface biotinylation revealed that this cleavage event occurs at the cell surface. Importantly, α-secretase processing was significantly promoted by recombinant overexpression of caveolin in intact cells, resulting in increased secretion of the soluble extracellular domain of APP. Conversely, caveolin depletion using antisense oligonucletotides prevented this cleavage event. Our current results indicate that caveolae and caveolins may play a pivotal role in the α-secretase-mediated proteolysis of APP in vivo.

The principal component of the senile plaque is the Aβ amyloid peptide, which is composed of 39–43 amino acid residues. The Aβ amyloid peptide is derived from a full-length precursor protein, termed APP 1The abbreviations used are: APP, amyloid precursor protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; RT, room temperature; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HA, hemagglutinin; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MBS, Mes-buffered saline; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: APP, amyloid precursor protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; RT, room temperature; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HA, hemagglutinin; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MBS, Mes-buffered saline; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.

Nature. 1987; 325: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (3930) Google Scholar). Alternate splicing of the APP gene generates at least 10 distinct isoforms; APP695 is the brain-specific isoform. The Aβ amyloid peptide is generated by the processing of APP with β- and γ-secretases (3Selkoe D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 373-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Alternatively, APP is processed by α-secretase, which cleaves APP within the Aβ sequence, thereby precluding the formation of Aβ (4Sisodia S.S. Koo E.H. Beyreuther K. Unterbeck A. Price D.L. Science. 1990; 248: 492-495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The identities of these secretases remain unknown. In some inherited forms of Alzheimer's disease, point mutations have been identified within the coding sequence of the APP gene (5van Duijn C.M. Hendriks L. Cruts M. Hardy J.A. Hofman A. Van Broeckhoven C. Lancet. 1991; 337: 978Abstract PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These mutations co-segregate with the disease phenotype and cause Alzheimer's disease. Understanding the molecular function and processing of APP is therefore critical to unraveling the molecular basis of Alzheimer's disease. One approach to elucidate the function of APP is to identify APP-interacting proteins. At least five distinct classes of molecules have been identified as APP binding partners as follows: Go(6Nishimoto I. Okamoto T. Matsuura Y. Okamoto T. Murayama Y. Ogata E.

The APP domain that interacts with Go has been localized to residues His657-Lys676 within the cytoplasmic domain of APP695. Go is a brain-specific member of heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein (G-protein) family. The in vivo interaction between APP695 and Goresults in apoptotic cell death (11Yamatsuji T. Matsui T. Okamoto T. Komatsuzaki K. Takeda S. Fukumoto H. Iwatsubo T. Suzuki N. Asami-Odaka A. Ireland S. Kinane T.B. Giambarella U. Nishimoto I.

Nishimoto I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2468-2475Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In contrast, functional consequences of interactions between APP and other binding partners have not yet been described. However, it is likely that these APP-interacting protein molecules directly participate in APP-mediated cell signaling events. A recent report described APP enrichment within caveolae-like domains in neurons (13Bouillot C. Prochiantz A. Rougon G. Allinquant B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7640-7644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Caveolae are plasmalemmal microdomains where multiple signaling molecules are concentrated. Growth factor-mediated and G-protein-mediated signaling cascades have been shown to be initiated within these microdomains (14Mineo C. James G.L. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11930-11935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 15Liu P. Ying Y. Ko Y.-G. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol.

Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 231-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). A major protein component of caveolae is caveolin. Molecular cloning has recently identified a caveolin gene family. Three distinct caveolin genes have been identified, cav-1, -2, and -3(17Glenney J.R. Soppet D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10517-10521Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 18Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2255-2261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). In addition, two isoforms of caveolin-1 (Cav-1α and Cav-1β) are derived from a single transcript from alternate translation initiation sites. Caveolins-1 and -2 are most abundantly expressed in adipocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblastic cell types, whereas the expression of caveolin-3 is muscle-specific. Caveolin proteins form homo-oligomers that bind cholesterol and glycosphingolipids. These protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions are thought to be essential for caveolae formation (20Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9407-9411Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Evidence is accumulating that caveolins can sequester molecules involved in G-protein-coupled signaling within caveolae. Heterotrimeric G-proteins are concentrated within caveolae and interact directly with caveolin via the Gα subunit (21Li S. Okamoto T. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Casanova J.E. Hansen S.H. Nishimoto I. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15693-15701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). In addition, several G-protein-coupled receptors are sequestered within caveolae in a ligand-independent (endothelin receptor) (22Chun M. Liyanage U.K. Lisanti M.P. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11728-11732Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and ligand-dependent fashion (muscarinic acetylcholine, β-adrenergic, and bradykinin receptor) (23Feron O. Smith T.W.

Cell Biol. 1989; 50: 340-352PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism that underlies the recognition of signaling molecules by caveolin has recently been elucidated (27Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar). Like other scaffolding proteins involved in signal transduction, caveolin contains a modular protein domain, termed the caveolin scaffolding domain. The caveolin scaffolding domain, in turn, recognizes a specific consensus motif within its interacting partners (28Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). As APP can function as a Go-coupled “receptor” (29Okamoto T. Takeda S. Murayama Y. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4205-4208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and contains a caveolin binding motif within its cytoplasmic domain, caveolin could provide a means for sequestering APP with caveolae membrane domains. As APP is expressed in many non-neuronal cell types where caveolin-1 is abundantly expressed, we initiated this study to determine whether APP localizes within caveolae and if caveolin plays a role in this sequestration event. Here, we show that (i) endogenous APP co-fractionates with caveolin-1 in three distinct cell lines (COS-7, HEK293, and MDCK); (ii) recombinantly expressed APP co-immunoprecipitates with caveolin-1 when expressed in COS-7 cells; (iii) a GST fusion protein encoding the cytoplasmic domain of APP interacts directly with purified recombinant caveolin-1 protein. These three independent lines of evidence support the hypothesis that APP physically associates with caveolin. Functionally, we show that the α-secretase cleavage product of APP is enriched within caveolae and that this cleavage event occurs at the cell surface. Specifically, we find that recombinant overexpression of caveolin-1 promoted α-secretase-mediated proteolysis of APP. The production of the α-secretase cleavage product of APP was abrogated by caveolin-1-based antisense oligonucleotides that effectively block caveolin-1 expression. These in vivo functional data clearly indicate that caveolae and caveolin proteins play a pivotal role in α-secretase-mediated processing of APP on the plasma membrane. The cDNAs for canine caveolin-1 were as we described previously (30Song K.S. Tang Z. Li S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4398-4403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Ni-NTA-agarose for purification of polyhistidine-tagged proteins was from Qiagen. Antibodies and their sources were as follows: anti-caveolin IgG polyclonal and monoclonal (2234) (gifts of Dr. John R. Glenney, Transduction Labs), anti-myc epitope IgG (monoclonal, 9E10; Santa Cruz Biotech), anti-HA epitope IgG (rat and mouse (12CA5) monoclonal, Boehringer Mannheim). A variety of other reagents were purchased commercially as follows: fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences), purified myelin basic protein (Sigma), and pre-stained protein markers (Bio-Rad and NOVEX). The anti-GST antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and anti-myelin basic protein antibody was from Dako. Antibodies against APP are well characterized and include the following: (i) monoclonal antibody: 22C11 specific for the extracellular domain of APP (Boehringer Mannheim), 4G8 specific for Aβ residues 18–24, and 6E10 specific for Aβ residues 1–17 (Senetek) (31Kim K.S.

Sisodia) (35Sisodia S.S. Koo E.H. Hoffman P.N. Perry G. Price D.L. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3136-3142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). COS-7, HEK293, and MDCK cells (all from ATCC) were grown in DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin (complete DMEM). cDNA transfections were conducted as described previously (36Ikezu T. Okamoto T. Murayama Y. Okamoto T. Homma Y. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31955-31961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-7 cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells per 100-mm dish. Twenty-four hours later, DNA (6 μg) of interest was transfected with 30 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 5 ml of DMEM. 24 h post-transfection, the media were changed to complete DMEM. 48 h post-transfection, media or cells were harvested and subjected to further analyses. For construction of the cDNA encoding HA-inserted APP, the APP695 cDNA in pCDNA-1 (37Yamatsuji T. Okamoto T. Takeda S. Murayama Y. Tanaka N. Nishimoto I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 498-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) was digested with XmaI and dephosphorylated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs). The oligonucleotides that encode HA sequence possessing XmaI restriction sites at both ends were phosphorylated, annealed, and ligated with the dephosphorylated APP cDNA. The orientation and sequence of the inserted fragment was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The HA peptide sequence was inserted between residues Pro307 and Gly308 of APP695. For construction of the GST fusion protein cDNA encoding the cytoplasmic domain of APP (Lys649-Asn695), this domain was amplified as a fragment with additional restriction cleavage sites at both ends (EcoRI and BamHI sites). After PCR, the amplified fragment was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and subcloned in frame into the vector pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cultured cells were grown to confluence in 150-mm dishes and used to prepare caveolin-enriched membrane fractions, as described previously (38Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). After two washes with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, cultured cells (two confluent 150-mm dishes) were scraped into 2 ml of 500 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11.0, and homogenized sequentially with a loose-fitting Dounce homogenizer (10 strokes), a Polytron tissue grinder (three 10-s bursts; Kinematica GmbH, Brinkmann Instruments), and a sonicator (three 20-s bursts; Branson Sonifier 250, Branson Ultrasonic Corp.). The homogenate was then adjusted to 45% sucrose by the addition of 2 ml of 90% sucrose in MBS (25 mm Mes, pH 6.5, 0.15 m NaCl) and placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. A 5–35% discontinuous sucrose gradient was formed above (4 ml of 5% sucrose, 4 ml of 35% sucrose; both in MBS containing 250 mm sodium carbonate) and centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 16–20 h in an SW41 rotor (Beckman Instruments). A light-scattering band confined to the 5–35% sucrose interface contained caveolin but excluded most other cellular proteins. The caveolae-rich fractions were diluted 3-fold with MBS and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellets were used as “purified caveolae-enriched membranes.” This protocol separated caveolin from the bulk of cellular membranes and cytosolic proteins. This fractionation scheme is based on the specific buoyant density of caveolin-rich membrane domains and their resistance to solubilization by sodium carbonate. By using this scheme, endogenous MDCK (38Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar) and COS-7 caveolin (39Tang Z. Okamoto T. Boontrakulpoontawee P. Katada T. Otsuka A.J. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2437-2445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) are purified 2,000-fold relative to total cell lysates; approximately 90–95% of caveolin is recovered in fractions 4 and 5 of these sucrose density gradients while excluding greater than 99.95% of total cellular proteins. By using this same fractionation scheme, cav-myc and cav-myc-H7co-fractionated with endogenous caveolin, an indication that the myc and polyhistidine tags do not interfere with the correct targeting of caveolin (38Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Sodium carbonate extraction is routinely used to determine if proteins are firmly attached to membranes, and caveolin is not solubilized by sodium carbonate. By using this scheme, endogenous caveolin and cav-myc-H7 were not only recovered almost quantitatively in fractions 4 and 5, while excluding most cellular proteins, but also were separated from the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked plasma membrane marker, carbonic anhydrase IV (38Song K.S.

This is consistent with recent observations that glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked proteins are not concentrated directly within caveolae but may reside in close proximity to the “neck regions” of caveolae within intact cells (40Schnitzer J. McIntosh D. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). As an alternative approach to purify caveolae, a protocol developed by Smart et al. (41Smart E.J., Y. Ying C. Mineo Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar) was employed. A plasma membrane fraction was prepared from 10 100-mm dishes of confluent tissue culture cells. Each dish was washed twice with 5 ml of buffer A (0.25 msucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tricine, pH 7.8). Cells were collected by centrifugation at 1,400 × gfor 5 min (Sorval RT6000: 3000 rpm) and resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A and homogenized 15 times with Teflon glass homogenizer. Homogenized cells were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min (Sorval RT6000: 2500 rpm), and the supernatant was subjected to Percoll gradient centrifugation. The sample was overlaid on top of 23 ml of 30% Percoll solution in buffer A and centrifuged at 83,000 ×g (30,000 rpm) for 30 min in a Beckman Ti-60 rotor. A plasma membrane fraction was collected, and the volume was adjusted to 2 ml in buffer A. 1.84 ml of 50% Optiprep in buffer B (0.25 msucrose, 6 mm EDTA, 120 mm Tricine, pH 7.8) was added to 0.16 ml of buffer A (23% Optiprep solution), which was mixed with the sonicated plasma membrane fraction. The entire solution was placed at the bottom of a Beckman SW41 rotor tube and overlaid onto a linear 10–20% Optiprep gradient (prepared by diluting 50% Optiprep in buffer A and B) and centrifuged at 52,000 × g(18000 rpm) for 90 min using SW41 rotor (Beckman). The bottom fraction was collected (non-caveolae membrane). The top 5 ml of the gradient (fractions 1–6) was collected and mixed with 50% Optiprep in buffer B, which was then placed on the bottom of SW41 rotor tube and overlaid by 2 ml of 5% Optiprep in buffer A. The membrane fractions were centrifuged at 52,000 × g for 90 min. An opaque band located just above the 5% interface was designated the caveolae fraction (41Smart E.J., Y. Ying C. Mineo Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). From the top of each gradient, 1-ml gradient fractions were collected to yield a total of 12 fractions. Caveolin migrates mainly in fractions 4 and 5 of these sucrose density gradients (38Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Gradient fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-PSQ sheets (Millipore). After transfer, sheets were stained with Ponceau S to visualize protein bands and subjected to immunoblotting. For immunoblotting using ECL, incubation conditions were as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), except we supplemented our blocking solution with both 1% bovine serum albumin, 3% nonfat dry milk, and 0.02% sodium azide. After transfection of cDNAs, cells were incubated with DMEM plus 10% Me2SO containing 48 μg/ml bis-[β-(4-azidosalicylamindo)ethyl] disulfide (Pierce) for 10 min at RT. Media were discarded, and cells were exposed to ultraviolet light (wavelength 365 nm) (model LM20E, VWR Scientific) for 15 min at 4 °C. Cells were solubilized in a lysis buffer A (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 60 mm octylglycoside, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with sonication (three 20-s bursts, Branson Sonifier 250, Branson Ultrasonic Corp). After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, supernatants were collected and subjected to immunoprecipitation/immunoblot analysis. Cross-linking reagents were cleaved by boiling samples at 95 °C for 5 min in the presence of 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Caveolae-enriched fractions were diluted with Mes-buffered saline (MBS) and solubilized in buffer A without Triton X-100. After dialysis against buffer A without detergent, immunoprecipitation was conducted with anti-HA (Boehringer Mannheim) or anti-myc antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. Fifty μl of a ∼50% slurry protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added and further incubated for 2 h. The beads were washed 3 times with Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl), once with TE buffer (0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA), and subjected to SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting. The Sf21 cells overproducing His-tagged caveolin-1 (76Li S. Song K.S. Koh S.S. Kikuchi A. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28647-28654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) were collected and solubilized in buffer A. Ni-NTA-agarose (200 μl) was then pre-equilibrated with TBS. Solubilized caveolin-containing cell extracts were then added to the resin and incubated for 6 h at 4 °C on a rotating platform. After binding, the beads were allowed to gently settle by gravity (5 min on ice) and washed extensively (four times, 5 min each; twice with TBS and twice with TBS plus 30 mm imidazole). After washing, bound proteins were eluted with TBS containing 200 mm imidazole, as per the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). An overnight culture of Escherichia coli harboring plasmids encoding either GST-APP or GST alone was purified as described previously (42Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). The interaction of GST-APP fusion proteins with caveolin-1-myc-H7 was evaluated as described for the interaction of caveolin with baculovirus-expressed heterotrimeric G-protein subunits (21Li S. Okamoto T. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Casanova J.E. Hansen S.H. Nishimoto I. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15693-15701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Briefly, GST or purified GST-APP cytoplasmic fusion proteins bound to glutathione-agarose beads were extensively prewashed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. These beads contained ∼100 pmol of a given fusion protein per 100 μl of packed volume. Approximately 100 μl of this material was incubated with 1 μg of caveolin-1-myc-H7 on a rotating platform overnight at 4 °C. After binding, the beads were washed extensively (6–8 times) with buffer B (50 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% CHAPS, and protease inhibitors). Finally, bound proteins were eluted with 100 μl of elution buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm reduced glutathione, and protease inhibitors. The eluate was mixed 1:1 with 2× sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) and Western blot analysis with anti-caveolin polyclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution, Transduction Laboratories). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:10000 dilution, Bio-Rad) were used to visualize bound primary antibodies by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In place of caveolin-myc-H7, purified myelin basic protein (a negative control) and FE65 (a positive control) were also used for binding experiments. For detection of myelin basic protein, anti-myelin basic protein antibody was used. For the binding study of FE65 and APP, the gene of human FE65 PTB2 domain (484–612 amino acids) was first cloned (43Ermekova K.S. Zambrano N. Linn H. Minopoli G. Gertler F. Russo T. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32869-32877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) by PCR with a set of 5′ and 3′ primers (5′ primer, ACGCGTCGACTCACAGGAAGGAGAGGAAACGCAC; 3′ primer, GCGGATCCTGTGAGGCACCTGCCAAGAAC) using human hippocampus cDNA library (CLONTECH) as a template. PCR product was digested with BamHI-SalI and ligated into pCAL-n-EK vector (Stratagene) for generating a fusion protein cDNA which contains calmodulin binding peptide and FE65-PTB2 fusion domains. Expression of calmodulin binding peptide-FE65-PTB2 protein was induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and was purified using calmodulin affinity resin (Stratagene) as described previously (44Sharma R.K. Taylor W.A. Wang J.H. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 102: 210-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The purified fusion protein (1 μg) was used for binding analysis as described above. After transfer of eluted samples separated in SDS-PAGE, the membrane was blocked with 2% skim milk and 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS, 0.02% sodium azide overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was incubated with 5 μg/ml biotinylated calmodulin (Calbiochem) in washing buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2) for 30 min at RT, washed 3 times with the same washing buffer (10 min each), incubated with 1/20,000 diluted streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (Pierce) for 30 min at RT, and washed 3 times with the same washing buffer. Finally bands were visualized by diaminobenzidine staining (Vector). Transfected cells (50,000 cells) were split onto 4-well chamber slides (Becton Dickinson). Twenty-four hours later, the cells were incubated for 15 min at 8 °C with anti-HA rat monoclonal antibody (5 μg/ml, Boehringer Mannheim) and cholera toxin B subunit conjugated with peroxidase (1 μg/ml, Sigma) in complete DMEM (45Parton R.G. Joggerst B. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1199-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with PBS (4 × 5 min) and fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde. After washing with PBS (5 × 5 min), nonspecific binding of antibodies was blocked with 3% normal goat serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) in PBS for 30 min at RT. Cells were then incubated with anti-cholera toxin rabbit antibody (Calbiochem) in PBS containing 3% normal goat serum for 1 h at RT. The chamber slides were washed with PBS (4 × 5 min) and incubated for 60 min at RT with secondary antibodies (Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (preabsorbed with rat and mouse IgG), 1:300 dilution, Jackson ImmunoResearch, and biotin-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG, 1:300 dilution, Boehringer Mannheim) and washed in PBS and in 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 8.2 (4 × for 5 min). Cells were incubated with avidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (1/300 dilution, Vector) in NaHCO3 buffer for 1 h at RT. Slides were mounted with Vectashield (Vector) and analyzed with a Leica TCS NT confocal microscope. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, 1 ml of media was mixed with 1 ml of 2× RIPA (150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0) and incubated with 2 μg each of antibodies (anti-Aβ-(1–28), 1153, CT-15, 6E10, 4G8, normal rabbit serum (NRG) or normal mouse serum (NMG)) overnight at 4 °C. 50 μl of ∼50% slurry protein G-Sepharose was added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed 3 times with RIPA buffer and once with TE buffer. Final samples were incubated with 60 μl of 2 × sampling buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol and boiled at 95 °C for 3 min. Fifteen μl of each sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE. As a critical control, 2 μg of anti-Aβ-(1–28) polyclonal antibody was preincubated with 20 μg of the Aβ-(1–16) synthetic peptide (Bachem) overnight at 4 °C and used for immunoprecipitation. For immunoblotting, immunostained bands were visualized with ECL. In Fig. 6 C, we used ECL-Plus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and incubated with PBS containing 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) for 30 min at 4 °C (46Lisanti M.P. Sargiacomo M. Graeve L. Saltiel A.R. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9557-9561Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and placed in complete DMEM. Four hours after incubation at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator, media were harvested and mixed with the same volume of 2× RIPA buffer, followed by incubation with Neutravidin beads (Pierce). After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the Neutravidin beads were washed three times with RIPA buffer and once with TE buffer. Final samples were mixed with sampling buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 3 min, and subjected to immunoblot analysis with 22C11."
https://openalex.org/W2052954853,"Circulating polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) are quiescent, nonadherent cells that rapidly activate at sites of inflammation, where they develop the capacity to perform a repertoire of functions that are essential for host defense. Induction of integrin-mediated adhesion, which requires an increase in integrin avidity, is critical for the development of these effector functions. Although a variety of stimuli can activate integrins in PMN, the signaling cascades involved are unclear. Phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase has been implicated in integrin activation in a variety of cells, including PMN. In this work, we have examined activation of the PMN integrin αMβ2, assessing both adhesion and generation of the epitope recognized by the activation-specific antibody CBRM1/5. We have found that PI 3-kinase has a role in activation of αMβ2 by immune complexes, but we have found no role for it in αMβ2 activation by ligands for trimeric G protein-coupled receptors, including formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (fMLP), interleukin-8, and C5a. Cytochalasin D inhibition suggests a role for the actin cytoskeleton in immune complex activation of αMβ2, but cytochalasin has no effect on fMLP-induced activation. Similarly, immune complex activation of the Rac/Cdc42-dependent serine/threonine kinase Pak1 is blocked by PI 3-kinase inhibitors, but fMLP-induced activation is not. These results demonstrate that two signaling pathways exist in PMN for activation of αMβ2. One, induced by FcγR ligation, is PI 3-kinase-dependent and requires the actin cytoskeleton. The second, initiated by G protein-linked receptors, is PI 3-kinase-independent and cytochalasin-insensitive. Pak1 may be in a final common pathway leading to activation of αMβ2.

Phagocytes are essential cells in host defense of metazoan organisms because they prevent the systemic spread of invading pathogens.

At sites of inflammation and infection, these cells perform many functions, including ingestion and killing of invading organisms, generation of inflammatory mediators, and initiation of an immune response. The acquisition of these effector functions required for successful host defense is called phagocyte activation. Adhesion is required to develop the full effector phenotype in phagocytes and, indeed, in other leukocytes as well (reviewed in Refs. 1Larson R.S. Springer T.A. Immunol. Rev. 1990; 114: 181-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar and 2Berton G. Yan S. Fumagalli L. Lowell C. Int. J. Clin. Lab. Res. 1996; 26: 160-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We have used human PMN as a model cell to study how adhesion regulates this phenotypic change and the critical role of leukocyte integrins in this process. PMN express β1, β2, and β3 integrins, but integrins other than the β2 family (also known as LeuCAM or CD18 integrins) are present in low number. In particular, the CD18 integrin αMβ2 plays a central role in PMN activation at sites of inflammation (3Anderson D. Schmalstieg F. Arnaout M. Kohl S. Dickey W. Abramson J. Springer T. Boxer L.

These stimuli cause an increase in integrin avidity through a process called “inside-out” signaling. The molecular pathways of inside-out signaling are uncertain, but increases in receptor affinity (16Dransfield I. Cabanas C. Craig A. Hogg N. J.

Phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI 3-kinase) has been implicated in the inside-out signaling for integrin activation (24Shimizu Y. Hunt S. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 566-573Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (106) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase phosphorylates phosphatidylinositols (PI) at the D3 position, producing PI 3-phosphate, PI (3,4)-bisphosphate, and PI (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) (25Carpenter C. Cantley L. Curr. Opin.

A second agent called LY294002 inhibits PI 3-kinase activity of the p85/p110 isoforms by binding the ATP-binding site of p110, but it has no effect on PI 4-kinase activity at doses up to 100 μm (36Vlahos C.

These pharmacologic agents have been extremely useful in delineating cellular activities in which PI 3-kinase has a role, including regulation of adhesion. Wortmannin has been shown to inhibit β1integrin-mediated adhesion to fibronectin of stem cell factor-treated mast cells (37Serve H. Yee N. Stella G. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Tan J. Besmer P.

Skov S. Dobson P. Bendtzen K. Geisler C. Odum N. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5350-5358PubMed Google Scholar). Use of PDGF and CD28 receptor mutants that no longer bind PI 3-kinase has provided strong evidence that PI 3-kinase is important for regulating PDGF- and CD28-induced adhesion in mast cells and HL-60 cells, respectively (43Zell T. Hunt S. Mobley J. Finkelstein L. Shimizu Y. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 883-886PubMed Google Scholar,44Kinashi T. Escobedo J.A. Williams L.T. Takatsu K. Springer T.A. Blood. 1995; 86: 2086-2090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of dominant negative mutants of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase blocks CD7-induced activation of β1 integrins in human T cells (45Chan A.S.H. Mobley J.L. Fields G.B. Shimizu Y. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 934-942PubMed Google Scholar). Although these data strongly suggest that PI 3-kinase activity is an important early event in inside-out signaling regulating integrin-mediated adhesion, the mechanism by which PI 3-kinase regulates adhesion is not clear nor is the generality of the requirement for PI 3-kinase in integrin activation. PDGF receptors, for example, can activate β1integrins by PI 3-kinase-dependent and -independent mechanisms (44Kinashi T. Escobedo J.A. Williams L.T. Takatsu K. Springer T.A.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 1255-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) in PMN are inhibited by wortmannin. Since each of these events depends on activated integrins, these data suggest the hypothesis that PI 3-kinase is a component of the inside-out signaling pathway regulating integrin activation in PMN. However, PMN contain an intracellular pool of αMβ2 which is rapidly expressed at the plasma membrane upon activation (15Arnaout M. Wang E. Clark S. Sieff C. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 49Todd R. Arnaout M. Rosin R. Crowley C. Peters W. Babior B. J. Clin.

Invest. 1992; 90: 1687-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The role of PI 3-kinase in regulating the expression of this intracellular pool at the plasma membrane is unknown. We tested the importance of PI 3-kinase in regulating integrin activation in PMN in two well characterized experimental systems for activating β2 integrin-dependent adhesion. FcγR ligation activates αMβ2 through initiation of a tyrosine kinase cascade, whereas fMLP requires a heterotrimeric G-protein to initiate signaling in PMN. Our results suggest that two pathways exist for activating β2integrin-dependent adhesion in PMN. The FcγR-initiated pathway is dependent on PI 3-kinase activity and is inhibited by cytochalasin D, whereas the fMLP-induced increase in αMβ2 avidity is independent of PI 3-kinase and unaffected by cytochalasin D. FcγR-mediated enhancement of αMβ2 expression is inhibited by wortmannin, but increased expression is not required for adhesion. Importantly, both pathways activate Pak1, a recently described serine/threonine kinase implicated in membrane ruffling and focal adhesion formation (54Sells M. Knaus U. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D. Bokoch G. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). FcγR-induced activation of Pak1 is PI 3-kinase-dependent, whereas fMLP-induced activation of Pak1 is independent of PI 3-kinase, potentially placing Pak1 in a common pathway leading to activation of αMβ2avidity. These data demonstrate that there is more than one molecular pathway for inside-out signaling and suggest that the effects of tyrosine kinase cascades, and G protein-dependent signaling on integrin function may be mediated by distinct mechanisms that converge on a common pathway involving Pak1.

PMN were greater than 98% viable as indicated by the exclusion of trypan blue dye. Cells were suspended in HBSS (Hanks' buffered salts solution with 20 mm Hepes and 8.9 mm sodium bicarbonate) with 1.0 mmMg2+ and 1 mm Ca2+(HBSS2+) or HBSS with 0.5 mm Mn2+ for adhesion assays and flow cytometry. Purified human PMN (1 × 107/ml) were incubated with 2 μg/ml calcein in HBSS for 30 min at RT. The cells were washed once and resuspended in HBSS2+ at 2 × 106/ml. For adhesion experiments in the presence of Mn2+, the cells were washed in HBSS with 2 mm EGTA once, HBSS2+ or HBSS + 0.5 mm Mn2+ once, and resuspended in HBSS2+ or HBSS + 0.5 mm Mn2+. Cells were treated with wortmannin or LY294002 at the indicated concentration or Me2SO as a control for 15 min at 37 °C or with pertussis toxin (2 μg/ml) or control buffer in HBSS + 1% human serum albumin for 2 h at 37 °C. For antibody inhibition experiments, cells were incubated with 10 or 25 μg/ml of the appropriate antibody for 15 min at RT. 1 × 105 cells were added per well to Immulon 2 plates coated with BSA and a 1:25 dilution of rabbit anti-BSA to form IC or 5% FCS as described (64Graham I.L. Anderson D.C. Holers V.M. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For PMA or fMLP-stimulated adhesion, PMA (50 μg/ml final), fMLP (100 nm final), or Me2SO control was added to the cells after allowing them to settle onto FCS-coated wells for 6 min at RT. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated time. The fluorescence (485 nm excitation and 530 nm emission wavelengths) was measured using a fMax fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) before and after washing twice with 150 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. Percent adhesion was calculated by dividing the fluorescence after washing by the fluorescence before washing. In preliminary experiments, fluorescence was shown to be linearly related to cell number (data not shown). Purified PMN (4 × 106/ml in HBSS2+) were treated with wortmannin (100 nm) or Me2SO for 15 min at 37 °C. For experiments with pertussis toxin, 1 × 107 cells/ml were incubated with pertussis toxin (2 μg/ml) or control buffer for 2 h at 37 °C and then washed. 2 × 106 cells were then treated with 30 μl insoluble IC (IIC) prepared exactly as described (65Rosales C. Brown E.J. J. Biol.

Cells were incubated with primary antibody for 40 min on ice and then washed twice. After incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated F(ab′)2 sheep anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody at a 1:50 dilution in 200 μl of wash buffer for 20 min on ice, cells were washed twice, and the relative fluorescence of gated PMN was measured using a EPICS XL (Coulter, Miami, FL) flow cytometer. For Mn2+ experiments, cells were treated with wortmannin, washed, resuspended in HBSS2+ or HBSS + 0.5 mm Mn2+, and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C and then placed on ice. Primary antibody was added directly to the cells (25 μg/ml) for 40 min on ice, washed twice, and incubated with secondary antibody as above. All washes were done with HBSS containing appropriate divalent cations. Purified PMN were suspended at 1 × 107 cells/ml in HBSS2+. After pretreatment with wortmannin, LY294002, pertussis toxin, or control buffer as described above, 7.5 × 106 cells were added to 6-well plates coated with IC or FCS as described (66Jones S. Brown E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14623-14630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) or stimulated in suspension with fMLP (100 nm). After incubating at 37 °C, the cells were lysed by adding cold 2× lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmNaVO4, 5 mg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin, and 1 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, final concentration) for 30 min on ice. Pak1 was immunoprecipitated from the lysates with 5 μl of rabbit anti-Pak1 antiserum and 40 μl of a 1:1 slurry of Protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with lysis buffer and two times with reaction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2). Kinase reactions were performed with the Pak1 immunoprecipitates by adding 30 μl of reaction buffer with 2.5 μg of MBP to the beads, incubating for 10 min at RT, followed by 10 μl of reaction buffer containing 100 μm cold ATP and 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (4500 Ci/mmol) for a final ATP concentration of 25 μm. The reactions were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C, after which the reaction was stopped with 50 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer containing 10% SDS. Phosphorylation of MBP was detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and autoradiography. For each experiment, Pak1 protein was immunoblotted using anti-Pak1 antiserum (1:1000) primary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antiserum (20 μg/ml) secondary antibody, and enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (ECL, Pierce) to ensure that equivalent amounts of kinase protein were added to each in vitro kinase reaction.

Chem. 1994; 269: 22732-22737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that PI 3-kinase activity may be required for FcγR-induced signal transduction and effector functions in PMN. We used two pharmacologic inhibitors of PI 3-kinase, wortmannin and LY294002, to test the hypothesis that PI 3-kinase activity is required for FcγR-induced, β2 integrin-dependent adhesion to IC in PMN. Adhesion of control PMN to IC was maximal by 15 min and sustained for up to 40 min (Ref. 8Graham I.L. Lefkowith J.B. Anderson D.C. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1509-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar and Fig. 1 A). PMN pretreated with wortmannin or LY294002 initially adhered to IC-coated surfaces identically to control cells, even at inhibitor concentrations up to 1 and 200 μm, respectively (Fig. 1, A and C, and data not shown). However, after 10 min, adhesion of both wortmannin- and LY294002-treated PMN to IC decreased until there was no specific, IC-dependent adhesion by 40 min (Fig. 1,A and C). Similar kinetics of adhesion were obtained with PMN pretreated with wortmannin for 30 min. Non-adherent, wortmannin-treated PMN excluded trypan blue dye, demonstrating that they were viable. Although the wortmannin and LY294002-treated PMN cells initially (<10 min) spread as well as control cells on IC, after 10 min spreading decreased until by 40 min the cells were completely round (data not shown). In contrast, PMA-induced adhesion to, and spreading on, FCS were not affected at"
https://openalex.org/W2064731387,"In the present study we investigated the lipid binding characteristics of the C2 domains of Rabphilin3a. We found that the tandem C2 domain of Rabphilin3a specifically bound lipid vesicles containing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) in a Ca2+-dependent manner. There was little binding to vesicles containing PtdIns(3,4)P2 in the presence or absence of Ca2+. Binding to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate-containing vesicles was similar to binding to PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing vesicles. The presence of physiological amounts of phosphatidylserine (PS) greatly potentiated the ability of PtdIns(4,5)P2 to cause vesicle binding. As with the C2 domains together, the binding of individual C2 domain of Rabphilin3a was much greater to PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing vesicles than PtdIns(3,4)P2-containing vesicles. Both C2 domains also bound 29 mol % PS-containing vesicles in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Because of the importance of the C2B domain in the enhancement of secretion from chromaffin cells by Rabphilin3a, its biochemistry was further investigated. The mutation of aspartates 657 and 659 to asparagines in C2B decreased Ca2+-dependent and increased Ca2+-independent vesicle binding, indicating the Ca2+ dependence of the domain is provided by aspartic acid residues in the putative Ca2+-binding pocket. A peptide from the COOH-terminal region of the C2B domain specifically inhibited ATP-dependent secretion from permeabilized chromaffin cells and the binding of Rabphilin3a to phosphatidylcholine/PS/PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing lipid vesicles, suggesting a role of this sequence in secretion through its ability to interact with acidic lipid vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W2156432834,"Peroxisomes play an indispensible role in ether lipid biosynthesis as evidenced by the deficiency of ether phospholipids in fibroblasts and tissues from patients suffering from a number of peroxisomal disorders. Alkyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate synthase, a peroxisomal enzyme playing a key role in the biosynthesis of ether phospholipids, contains the peroxisomal targeting signal type 2 in a N-terminal cleavable presequence. Using a polyclonal antiserum raised against alkyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate synthase, levels of this enzyme were examined in fibroblast cell lines from patients affected by peroxisomal disorders. Strongly reduced levels were found in fibroblasts of Zellweger syndrome and rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata patients, indicating that the enzyme is not stable in the cytoplasm as a result of defective import into peroxisomes. In a neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy patient with an isolated import deficiency of proteins carrying the peroxisomal targeting signal type 1, the precursor form of alkyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate synthase was detected at a level comparable to that of the mature form in control fibroblasts, in line with an intraperoxisomal localization. A patient with an isolated deficiency in alkyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate (DHAP) synthase activity had normal levels of this protein. Analysis at the cDNA level revealed a missense mutation leading to a R419H substitution in the enzyme of this patient. Expression of a recombinant protein carrying this mutation in <i>Escherichia coli</i> yielded an inactive enzyme, whereas a comparable control recombinant enzyme was active, providing further proof that this substitution is responsible for the inactivity of the enzyme and the phenotype. In line with this result is the observation that wild-type alkyl-DHAP synthase activity can be inactivated by the arginine-modifying agent phenylglyoxal. The enzyme is efficiently protected against this inactivation when the substrate palmitoyl-DHAP is present at a saturating concentration. The gene encoding human alkyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate synthase was mapped on chromosome 2q31."
https://openalex.org/W1525929664,"HMG1 is an evolutionarily highly conserved chromosomal protein consisting of two folded DNA-binding domains, A and B (“high mobility group (HMG) boxes”), and an acidic C-terminal domain. Several lines of evidence suggest that previously reported sequence-independent DNA bending and looping by HMG1 and its HMG box domains might be important for the proposed role of the protein in transcription and recombination. We have used ligase-mediated circularization assays to investigate the contribution of the individual A and B HMG1 box domains and of the linker region between A/B- and B/C-domains, which flank the “minimal” B-domain (residues 92–162), to the ability of the HMG1 protein (residues 1–215) to bend DNA. Neither the minimal B-domain nor the minimal B-domain with a 7-residue N-terminal extension (85TKKKFKD91) bent the DNA. The attachment of an extra 18-residue C-terminal additional extension (residues 163–180) to the minimal B-domain had only a small effect on the ability of the HMG box to bend DNA. On the other hand, circularization assay with a B-domain having both 7-residue N-terminal and 18-residue C-terminal flanking sequences (residues 85–180) revealed a strong bending of the DNA, suggesting that both extensions are a prerequisite for efficient DNA bending by the B-domain. We have also shown that a single lysine residue (Lys90) in a short N-terminal sequence 90KD91 attached to the B-domain is sufficient for strong distortion of DNA by bending, provided that the B-domain is flanked by the 18-residue C-terminal flanking sequence. Although the DNA bending potential of HMG1 seems to be predominantly due to the B-domain flanked by basic sequences, covalent attachment of the A- and B-domains is necessary for efficient DNA flexure and the ability of the (A+B)-bidomain to bend DNA is further modulated in the native HMG1 protein by its acidic C-domain.

In addition to the ability of HMG1 to act as a general, non-sequence-specific DNA bending/looping/wrapping protein, HMG1 and its HMG box domains are also able to recognize and bind altered (prebent and unwound) DNA conformations, as has been demonstrated with synthetic four-way junctions and adducts of the anticancer drug cisplatin on DNA (15Bianchi M.E.

Reports from several laboratories indicate that the precise length of the expressed HMG box polypeptides may be important for their DNA binding and bending activities. Extensions beyond the minimal HMG box in its natural sequence context increase DNA bend angle and binding affinity of the sequence-specific HMG box, hLEF-1 (18Carlsson P. Weterman M.L. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2418-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 19Lnenicek-Allen M. Read Ch. M. Crane-Robinson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 24: 1047-1051Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The addition of 19 extra amino acids to the C terminus of the Chironomus HMG1-like protein (cHMG1) results in an increased affinity for linear or four-way junction DNA (20Wisniewski J.R. Schulze E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10713-10719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of HMG1 B-domain polypeptides of two different lengths indicates that the polypeptide with longer flanking sequences exhibits enhanced DNA binding and supercoiling, and promotes DNA bending and the self-association (oligomerization) of the DNA-bound HMG box (21Teo S.-H. Grasser K.D. Thomas J.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, the exact contribution of the basic linker regions between the A/B- and B/C-domains of HMG1 for DNA bending activities of its HMG box domains has not been clear. In addition, conflicting results have been reported regarding the ability of the HMG1 A-domain to bend DNA (10Paull T.T. Haykinson M.J. Johnson R.C.

In the present work, we have used ligase-mediated circularization assays to investigate the effect of the acidic C-domain of HMG1 and the contribution of the HMG1 box A- and B-domains and their flanking sequences to the ability of the protein to bend DNA. The oligodeoxyribonucleotides were synthesized by the Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) protocol and used directly for PCR. Promega and BioLabs restriction enzymes, T4 DNA kinase, T4 DNA ligase, T4 DNA polymerase, and Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I were used. Isolation of plasmids and DNA fragments from 1% agarose gels was carried out using QiaPrep Spin Miniprep and gel purification kits (Qiagen), respectively. The radioactive labels were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All HMG sequences were derived from rat HMG1 cDNA. Plasmid encoding the rat HMG1 protein was kindly provided by M. E. Bianchi (plasmid pT7-RNHMG1). The HMG1 (A+B)-bidomain (residues 1–180), HMG box A (residues 1–84), and HMG box A′ (residues 1–78) were prepared by PCR of the plasmid pT7-RNHMG1 using a sense primer 5′-GGATCCGGCAAAGGAGATCCTAAGAAG-3′ (BamHI site is in italics) and antisense primers Brev(5′-GCAGGTCGAC CTACTTCTCAGCCTTGACCAC-3′) for the HMG1 (A+B)-bidomain, A (5′-GTCGAC CTACTCCCCTTTGGGGGGGATG-3′) for HMG box A and A′ (5′-GTCGAC CTAGTAGGTTTTCATTTC-3′) for HMG box A′ (SalI site is in italics, and the termination codon is underlined). The B-domains of different lengths were prepared by PCR of the plasmid pT7-RNHMG1 using an antisense primer, Brev, and the sense primers B (5′-GGATCCCCCAATGCCCCCAAG-3′) for HMG box B (residues 92–180), B1 (5′-GGATCCGACCCCAATCCCCC-3′) for HMG box B1 (residues 91–180), B2 (5′-GGATCCAAGGACCCCAATGCC-3′) for HMG box B2 (residues 90–180), B3 (5′-GGATCCTTCAAGGACCCCAAT-3′) for HMG box B3 (residues 89–180), B6 (5′-GGATCCAAAAAGAAGTTCAAG-3′) for HMG box B6 (residues 86–180), and B7 (5′-GGATCCACCAAAAAGAAGTTC-3′) for HMG box B7 (residues 85–180) (BamHI site is in italics). The antisense primer Brev(min)(5′-GTCGAC CTAGTAGGCAGCAATATC-3′) and either sense primer B or B7 were used for the PCR amplification of the “minimal” HMG box B (HMG box Bmin; residues 92–162) and the HMG box B′ (residues 85–162), respectively (SalI site is in italics, and the termination codon is underlined). The gel-purified PCR products were cloned into a pGEM-T vector (Promega), and the positive clones were double-digested with BamHI and SalI restriction endonucleases to excise cDNAs encoding HMG polypeptides. The BamHI/SalI fragments were then cloned between the BamHI/SalI sites of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion expression vector pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to construct plasmids pGXRHMG1-(A+B), pGXRHMG1-A, pGXRHMG1-A′, pGXRHMG1-Bmin, pGXRHMG1-B′, pGXRHMG1-B, and pGXRHMG1-(B1-B7). The identity of the cloned HMG box sequences in the latter plasmids was verified by sequencing both strands using the dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method (T7 sequencing kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HMG1 (A+B) and isolated HMG boxes, encoded by plasmids pGXRHMG1-(A+B), pGXRHMG1-A, pGXRHMG1-A′, pGXRHMG1-Bmin, pGXRHMG1-B′, pGXRHMG1-B, and pGXRHMG1-(B1-B7) were expressed in BL 21 cells (Novagene) as fusion proteins with GST to allow efficient synthesis and stability in E. coli. The expressed HMG box-GST fused proteins were selectively retained on glutathionine-Sepharose 4B columns. The columns were washed thoroughly in 1× phosphate-buffered saline buffer, and the HMG box polypeptides were then released from the column by cleavage with thrombin, resulting in the HMG box polypeptides containing extra N-terminal Gly-Ser dipeptides originating from the BamHI site. This was followed by FPLC purification on a MonoS column (7S̆tros M. Reich J. Kolı́balová A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For control experiments, two HMG1 B-domain polypeptides (residues 89–176 and 92–176) were expressed directly (unfused) under the control of the T7 promoter/T7 RNA polymerase system as described previously (23Bianchi M.E. Falciola L. Ferrari S. Lilley D.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1055-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). HMG1 protein was isolated either from BL 21 (DE3) cells harboring plasmid pT7-RNHMG1 or from calf thymus and purified under nondenaturing conditions as described previously (4S̆tros M. Vorlı́c̆ková M. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1990; 12: 891-899Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 7S̆tros M. Reich J. Kolı́balová A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Finally, purified HMG proteins were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol. The concentrations of the HMG1 and HMG1 (A+B)-bidomain were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm (4S̆tros M. Vorlı́c̆ková M. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1990; 12: 891-899Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 6S̆tros M. S̆tokrová J. Thomas J.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The concentrations of HMG boxes were determined by a Bio-Rad protein Coomassie G-250 dye assay and from the absorbance at 280 nm using ε = 12,500 m−1 cm−1 (24Chow C.S. Barnes C.M. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2956-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The purity and amounts of the HMG proteins were also checked by resolution of the samples on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide slab gels in Tris-Tricine buffer at 50 V for 16 h, followed by Coomassie Blue G-250 staining (25Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10470) Google Scholar). The 123-bp DNA fragment was prepared by AvaI digestion of the commercially available 123-bp ladder (Life Technologies, Inc.). The 123-bp DNA fragment was labeled at its 5′-termini with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase and unincorporated label was removed on Sephadex G-50 minicolumns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The circularization assay used in this paper was based on existing protocols (10Paull T.T. Haykinson M.J. Johnson R.C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1521-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 26Pil P.M. Chow C.S. Lippard S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9465-9469Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) with some modifications. In the standard protocol, 32P-labeled 123-bp DNA fragment (∼1 nm) with cohesive (AvaI) ends was preincubated on ice for 20 min with HMG1, HMG1 (A+B)-bidomain, or isolated HMG box polypeptides (0.05–1.5 μm) in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm ATP (1× T4 DNA ligase buffer) in a final volume of 10 μl. The DNA was then ligated with T4 DNA ligase (0.05 unit/reaction; Promega) at 30 °C for 5–40 min, followed by termination at 65 °C for 15 min. Some of the reaction mixtures were treated after termination of the ligation with 32 units of exonuclease III (Promega) at 37 °C for 30 min. Before electrophoresis, all samples were digested with proteinase K (1 μg/reaction) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% SDS, 4% sucrose, 0.025% each xylene cyanol and bromphenol blue (electrophoretic loading buffer) at 37 °C for 60 min. They were loaded on prerun 5% polyacrylamide slab gels (29:1 acrylamide/N,N′-methylene bisacrylamide) in 45 mm Tris base, 45 mm boric acid, 1.25 mm EDTA, pH 8.3–8.4 (0.5× TBE buffer). The gels were run at 250 V for ∼1.5 h (room temperature). On completion of electrophoresis, the gels were vacuum-dried and either autoradiographed at −70 °C (Agfa CP-B x-ray film) or visualized by phosphorimaging. The amounts of monomer DNA circles were determined from quantitative analyses of dried gels on a Molecular Dynamics Storm PhosphorImager using the ImageQuant software. The K d (app) was estimated from the gel mobility shift assay as the HMG protein concentration at the point in the titration where half of the input DNA had been complexed with protein, i.e. protein concentration at which 50% of the DNA was shifted (27Fried M.G. Electrophoresis. 1989; 10: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 28Wagner J.P. Quill D.M. Pettijohn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7394-7398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). DNA and proteins were mixed in 1× T4 DNA ligase buffer containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 6% glycerol as a DNA binding buffer (16Pil P.M. Lippard S.J. Science. 1992; 256: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Briefly,32P-labeled 123-bp DNA fragment (∼0.1 nm) was incubated on ice with different amounts of HMG proteins (in a molar excess of DNA), and the complexes were resolved on prerun 5% polyacrylamide gels as indicated for the cyclization assay, but at 4 °C. Quantification was performed on a Molecular Dynamics Storm PhosphorImager. One of the most direct methods in analyzing the DNA bending of non-sequence-specific proteins is the ligase-mediated circularization assay (DNA ring closure assay). This assay measures the efficiency with which T4-DNA ligase forms circles from fragments of DNA that are shorter than ∼150 bp. In the absence of internal curvature, the stiffness of a short DNA fragment (<150 bp) prevents intramolecular alignment of its ends so that circles are detected only in the presence of a protein that bends DNA. In the present work, we have used the circularization assay to investigate the contribution of the HMG1 box A- and B-domains to, as well as the influence of the basic linker regions between A/B- and B/C-domains on, the previously reported ability of the HMG1 protein to bend DNA (10Paull T.T. Haykinson M.J. Johnson R.C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1521-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 26Pil P.M. Chow C.S. Lippard S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9465-9469Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We also investigated whether the acidic C-terminal domain of HMG1 could modulate the DNA bending potential of the protein. The DNA bending analysis presented in this paper should be regarded as a qualitative approach rather than an attempt to determine explicitly the extent of DNA bending, which is to be estimated only by measuring true cyclization probabilities from cyclization kinetics or by mixed ligation (as defined in Refs. 30Koo H.-S.

Protein sequences of rat HMG1, HMG1 lacking the acidic C terminus (referred to as HMG1 (A+B)-bidomain), and isolated HMG1 box A- and B-domains with flanking sequences of different lengths are shown in Fig. 1. HMG1 was expressed in E. coli as an unfused protein (encoded by plasmid pT7-RNHMG1), while the HMG polypeptides were synthetized in E. coli as GST fusion proteins to increase their stability in the bacterial cell. The GST-protein tag was subsequently removed and the released HMG polypeptides, having extra glycine and serine amino acids at their N termini contributed by the parental GST vector, were purified to homogeneity by FPLC chromatography (Fig. 2; some B-domain polypeptides were also expressed without the N-terminal Gly-Ser dipeptide and used as controls in DNA bending experiments; see “Discussion”). The ability of the expressed HMG polypeptides to bind DNA was verified in a gel retardation assay using labeled synthetic four-stranded Holliday junctions (four-way junction DNA) or linear 123-bp double-stranded DNA. The results obtained indicated that all of the HMG constructs could bind four-way junctions 2M. S̆tros, unpublished results. or the linear DNA used in the cyclization assay.

The ligase-mediated cyclization assay was performed at low DNA concentration (∼1 nm) to reduce the formation of linear multimers of the 123-bp DNA probe in the control experiments, which used T4 DNA ligase alone. Production of DNA circles due to HMG-induced DNA bending was verified by their resistance to exonuclease III, which digests only linear DNA molecules. Extensive treatment of the ligated products with exonuclease III was necessary in order to completely digest linear DNA multimers, which in some cases resulted in a higher background. Using this approach, we have studied the effect of removal of the acidic C terminus of HMG1 on the ability of the protein to bend DNA in the ligase-mediated cyclization assay. As shown in Fig. 3, both HMG1 and its truncated form without the acidic C terminus (HMG1 (A+B)-bidomain) could bend DNA, indicating that the HMG box domains of the HMG1 protein are responsible for distortion of the DNA helix by bending as reported earlier (10Paull T.T. Haykinson M.J. Johnson R.C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1521-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 11Onate S.A. Prendergast P. Wagner J.P. Nissen M. Reeves R. Pettijohn D.E. Edwards D.P. Mol.

Lippard S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9465-9469Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The formation of DNA circles by HMG1 was relatively independent of the amount of the protein within the concentration range studied (0.05–1.5 μm; Fig. 3). On the other hand, removal of the acidic C terminus from HMG1 had a significant impact on the bending ability of HMG1. Whereas at lower HMG-to-DNA molar ratios HMG1 (A+B)-bidomain seemed to be more efficient than HMG1 in formation of DNA circles, at higher HMG1 (A+B)-to-DNA ratios, formation was markedly reduced relative to the full-length HMG1 protein (Fig. 3). These results might suggest that the acidic C terminus of HMG1 could modulate the ability of the native protein to bend DNA. We estimated K d (app), the apparent K d for the equimolar HMG-to-DNA interaction, for both HMG1 and HMG1 (A+B)-bidomain to be in the range of ∼10–15 nm. Our K d (app) value for HMG1 was in good agreement with the K d (app) ∼2–20 nm reported in Ref. 28Wagner J.P. Quill D.M. Pettijohn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7394-7398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar for HMG1 binding to 207-bp linear DNA in a similar DNA binding buffer. These results indicate that, at least under the conditions of the cyclization assay, removal of the acidic C-domain from HMG1 does not significantly change the DNA binding affinity of the protein. An interesting finding was a marked increase in the production of linear multimers of the 123-bp DNA fragment in the presence of HMG1. To our knowledge, the stimulatory effect of HMG1 (Fig. 3) and its isolated HMG box A-and B-domains (see below and Figs.Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6) on the ligase-mediated formation of linear multimers of DNA has not been reported before. Reports from several laboratories indicate that the precise length of the expressed sequence- or non-sequence-specific HMG box polypeptides may be important for their DNA binding and bending activities (18Carlsson P.

However, the exact contribution of each of the two HMG1 boxes, A and B, to DNA bending is not clear. It is also not clear whether one or both of the N- and C-terminal flanking sequences of the B-domain are necessary for DNA bending activities of the HMG box. Initial experiments in this paper were aimed therefore at investigation of the effect of the B-domain's N- and/or C-terminal flanking sequences, in their natural sequence context within the native HMG1 protein, on its ability to bend DNA.

In these experiments, we used the DnaB protein variant, R14C, which has arginine 14 replaced by cysteine in the small 12-kDa domain of the protein using site-directed mutagenesis. The cysteine residues have been modified with a fluorescent marker which serves as a donor or an acceptor to another fluorescence label placed in different locations on the DNA substrates.

This is the first evidence of the existence of such a structure of a hexameric helicase-ssDNA complex in solution. In the stationary complex with the 5′ arm of the replication fork, without ATP hydrolysis, the distance between the 5′ end of the arm and the 12-kDa domains of the hexamer (R = 47 Å) is the same as in the complex with the isolated ssDNA oligomer (R = 47 Å) having the same length as the arm of the fork. These data indicate that both ssDNA and the 5′ arm of the fork bind in the same manner to the DNA binding site. Moreover, in the complex with the helicase, the length of the ssDNA is similar to the length of the ssDNA strand in the double-stranded DNA conformation. In the stationary complex, the helicase does not invade the duplex part of the fork beyond the first 2–3 base pairs. This result corroborates the quantitative thermodynamic data which showed that the duplex part of the fork does not contribute to the free energy of binding of the enzyme to the fork.

The enzyme is an essential replication protein in E. coli (4Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. Freeman, San Francisco1992Google Scholar) which is involved in both the initiation and elongation stages of DNA replication (3West S.C.

The DnaB helicase is the only helicase required to reconstitute DNA replication in vitro from the chromosomal origin of replication. In the complex with ssDNA, 1The abbreviations used are: ss, single-stranded; ds, double-stranded; AMP-PNP, β,γ-imidoadenosine-5′-triphosphate; EM, electron microscopy; CPM, 7-diethylamino-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin; Fl, fluorescein; Rh, rhodamine. the DnaB protein forms a “mobile replication promoter.” This nucleoprotein complex plays an activating role for the primase in the initial stages of the priming reaction (4Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. Freeman, San Francisco1992Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium, sedimentation velocity, and nucleotide cofactor binding studies show that the DnaB helicase exists as a stable hexamer in a large protein concentration range stabilized specifically by magnesium cations (7Bujalowski W. Klonowska M.M. Jezewska M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31350-31358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2129-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Hydrodynamic and EM data indicate that six protomers aggregate with cyclic symmetry in which the protomer-protomer contacts are limited to only two neighboring subunits (7Bujalowski W. Klonowska M.M. Jezewska M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31350-31358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10San Martin M.C. Valpuesta J.M. Stamford N.P.J. Dixon N.E. Carazo J.M. J. Struct.

Hydrodynamic and EM studies also provide direct evidence of the presence of long range allosteric interactions in the hexamer, encompassing all six subunits of the enzyme (7Bujalowski W. Klonowska M.M. Jezewska M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31350-31358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Yu X. Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. Egelman E.H. J. Mol.

Recently, we obtained the first estimate of the stoichiometry of the DnaB helicase-ssDNA complex and the mechanism of the binding (12Bujalowski W. Jezewska M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8513-8519Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 13Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2117-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In the complex with ssDNA, the DnaB helicase binds the nucleic acid with a stoichiometry of 20 ± 3 nucleotides per DnaB hexamer, and this stoichiometry is independent of the type of nucleic acid base (9Jezewska M.J. Kim U.-S. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2129-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar,13Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2117-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Our thermodynamic studies of binding of the DnaB hexamer to different ssDNA oligomers show that the enzyme has a single, strong binding site for ssDNA. Moreover, the same binding site is used in the binding to oligomers, polymer DNA, and replication fork substrates (9Jezewska M.J. Kim U.-S. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2129-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar,12Bujalowski W. Jezewska M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8513-8519Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 13Jezewska M.J.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10320-10326Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Photo-cross-linking experiments indicate that the ssDNA binding site is located predominately, if not completely, on a single subunit of the hexamer (9Jezewska M.J. Kim U.-S. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2129-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 12Bujalowski W. Jezewska M.J.

Our data show that, in the complex with the replication fork DNA substrates, the DnaB helicase preferentially binds to the 5′ arm of the fork (14Jezewska M.J. Rajendran S. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10320-10326Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The 3′ arm does not form a stable complex with the DnaB hexamer associated with the 5′ arm, and the 3′ arm is in a conformation in which it is accessible for the binding of another DnaB hexamer. Moreover, the duplex part of the fork substrate does not significantly contribute to the free energy of binding which predominantly comes from interactions with the 5′ arm (14Jezewska M.J. Rajendran S. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10320-10326Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Formulating a physical model of a hexameric helicase mechanism requires the knowledge of the structure of the helicase-ssDNA complex. In phage T7 helicase/primase and E. coli RuvB protein systems, EM data indicated that, in the complex with the enzymes, the ssDNA passes through the inner channel of the protein hexamer (15Stasiak A. Tsaneva I.R. West S.C. Benson C.J.B. Yu X. Egelman E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7618-7622Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 16Egelman E.H. Yu X. Wild R. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). On the other hand, an outside mode of ss nucleic acid binding has been proposed for the hexamer of the SV40 T large antigen helicase (17SenGupta D.J. Borowiec J.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1656-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this communication, the structure of the DnaB helicase-ssDNA complex has been studied using the fluorescence energy transfer method. We present evidence that, in the complex with the DnaB hexamer, the ssDNA oligomer, which occupies the entire total DNA binding site of the DnaB helicase, passes through the inner channel of the hexamer. The results indicate that in the stationary complex with the replication fork substrate, the helicase does not invade the duplex part of the fork beyond the first 2–3 base pairs. All solutions were made with distilled and deionized >18 megohms (Milli-Q Plus) water. All chemicals were reagent grade. Buffer T2 is 50 mm Tris adjusted to pH 8.1 with HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol. The temperatures and concentrations of NaCl and AMP-PNP in the buffer are indicated in the text. The E. coli DnaB protein was purified, as we described previously (18Bujalowski W. Klonowska M.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5888-5900Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 19Bujalowski W. Klonowska M.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4682-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The concentration of the protein was spectrophotometrically determined using the extinction coefficient, ε280 = 1.85 × 105 cm−1m−1 (hexamer) (7Bujalowski W. Klonowska M.M. Jezewska M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31350-31358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All nucleic acids were purchased from Midland Certified Reagents (Midland, TX). The 20 mer dT(pT)19, labeled with fluorescein at the 5′ end, or at a different location of the nucleic acid, were synthesized using fluorescein phosphoramidate (Glen Research). Labeling of 20 mers at the 3′ end with fluorescein, or labeling with rhodamine (Rh), was performed by synthesizing dT(pT)19 with a nucleotide residue in a given location of the nucleic acid with the amino group on a six-carbon linker and, subsequently, modifying the amino group with fluorescein 5′-isothiocyanate or tetramethylrhodamine 6-isothiocyanate (Midland Certified Reagents). The degree of labeling was determined by absorbance at 494 nm for fluorescein (pH 9) using the extinction coefficient, ε494 = 7.6 × 104m−1 cm−1, and at 555 nm for rhodamine using the extinction coefficient, ε555 = 8.0 × 104m−1 cm−1 (9Jezewska M.J. Kim U.-S. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2129-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Concentrations of all ssDNA oligomers have been spectrophotometrically determined, using the nearest-neighbor analysis (9Jezewska M.J. Kim U.-S. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2129-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 20Cantor C.R. Warshaw M.M. Shapiro H. Biopolymers. 1970; 9: 1059-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). The single-arm fork substrates were obtained by mixing the proper oligomers at given concentrations, warming up the mixture for 5 min at 95 °C, and slowly cooling for a period of ∼2 h (14Jezewska M.J. Rajendran S. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10320-10326Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Replacement of the arginine residues at position 14 from the N terminus of the DnaB protein and obtaining the DnaB protein variant, R14C, were performed using the plasmid RLM1038, harboring the gene of the wild type DnaB helicase. 2Jezewska, M. J., Rajendran, S., and Bujalowski, W. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 9058–9069 The site-directed mutagenesis was accomplished in the NIEHS Center facility directed by Dr. T. Wood. Labeling of the six cysteine residues of the DnaB variant, R14C hexamer, with CPM or fluorescein 5-maleimide was performed in H buffer (50 mm Hepes/HCl, pH 8.1, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol) at 4 °C. The fluorescent label was added from the stock solution to the molar ratio of the dye/R14C ≈ 25. The mixture was incubated for 4 h, with gentle mixing. After incubation, the protein was precipitated with ammonium sulfate and dialyzed overnight against buffer T2. Any remaining free dye was removed from the modified R14C-CPM or R14C-Fl by applying the sample on a DEAE-cellulose column and eluting with buffer T2 containing 500 mm NaCl. The degree of labeling, γ, was determined by the absorbance of a marker using the extinction coefficient, ε394 = 27 × 103 cm−1m−1 for CPM and ε494 = 78 × 103 cm−1m−1 for fluorescein, respectively. The obtained values of γ were 5.8 ± 0.1 for CPM and 5.7 ± 0.1 for fluorescein, indicating that all cysteine residues in R14C are readily available for modification. 3S. Rajendran, M. J. Jezewska, and W. Bujalowski, manuscript in preparation. All steady-state fluorescence titrations were performed using the SLM-AMINCO 48000S and 8100 spectrofluorometers (12Bujalowski W. Jezewska M.J.

The emission spectra have been corrected for instrument characteristics using the software provided by the manufacturer. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements were performed in the L format, using Glan-Thompson polarizers placed in the excitation and emission channels. The fluorescence anisotropy of the sample was calculated using (23Lakowicz J.R. Principle of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar) r=(IVV−GIVH)(IVV+2GIVH)Equation 1 were I is the fluorescence intensity and the first and the second subscripts refer to vertical (V) polarization of the excitation and vertical (V) or horizontal (H) polarization of the emitted light (19Bujalowski W. Klonowska M.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4682-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The factor G = I HV/I HH corrects for the different sensitivity of the emission monochromator for vertically and horizontally polarized light (24Azumi T. McGlynn S.P. J. Chem. Phys. 1962; 37: 2413-3240Crossref Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The limiting fluorescence anisotropies of fluorophores, r lim, were determined by measuring the anisotropy of a given sample at a different solution viscosity, adjusted by sucrose or glycerol, and extrapolating to viscosity = ∞, using the Perrin equation (19Bujalowski W. Klonowska M.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4682-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar,23Lakowicz J.R. Principle of Fluorescence Spectroscopy.

The efficiency of the fluorescence radiationless energy transfer, E, from donors located on the small 12-kDa domains of the DnaB protein variant R14C, to an acceptor located on a DNA substrate bound in the DNA binding site of the DnaB helicase, has been determined using two independent methods. The fluorescence of the donor in the presence of the acceptor, F DA, is related to the fluorescence of the same donor, F D, in the absence of the acceptor by FDA=(1−νD)FD+FDνD(1−ED)Equation 2a where ν D is the fraction of donors in the complex with the acceptor, and E D is the average fluorescence energy transfer from a donor to an acceptor, determined from the quenching of the donor fluorescence. Thus, the average transfer efficiency, E D, obtained from the quenching of the donor fluorescence is obtained by rearranging Equation 2a ED=1νDFD−FDAFDEquation 2b The values of ν D have been determined using the binding constants of a given DNA substrate for the DnaB helicase measured in the same solution conditions (9Jezewska M.J. Kim U.-S. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2129-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 14Jezewska M.J. Rajendran S. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10320-10326Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the second independent method, the average fluorescence transfer efficiency, E A, has been determined, using a sensitized acceptor fluorescence, by measuring the fluorescence intensity of the acceptor (fluorescein or rhodamine), excited at a wavelength where a donor predominantly absorbs, in the absence and presence of the donor. The fluorescence intensities of the acceptor in the absence, F A, and presence,F AD, of the donor are defined as FA=IoεACATφFAEquation 3a and FAD=(1−νA)FA+IoεAνACATφBA+IoεDCDTνDφBAEAEquation 3b where I o is the intensity of incident light,C AT and C DT are the total concentrations of acceptor and donor, ν A is the fraction of acceptors in the complex with donors, ε A and ε D are the molar absorption coefficients of acceptor and donor at the excitation wavelength, respectively, φFA and φBA are the quantum yields of the free and bound acceptor, and E A is the average transfer efficiency determined by the acceptor sensitized emission. All quantities in Equations 3a and 3b can be experimentally determined. For the case considered in this work, the acceptor is practically, completely saturated with the donor, i.e. ν A = 1. Thus, for ν A = 1, dividing Equation 3b by 3a and rearranging provides the average transfer efficiency as described by EA=1νDεACATεDCDTφFAφBAFADFA−1Equation 3c It should be pointed out that the energy transfer efficiencies,E D and E A, are apparent quantities. E D is a fraction of the photons absent in the donor emission as a result of the presence of an acceptor, including transfer to the acceptor and possible nondipolar quenching processes induced by the presence of the acceptor, and E A is a fraction of all photons absorbed by the donor which were transferred to the acceptor. The true Förster energy transfer efficiency, E, is a fraction of the photons absorbed by the donor and transferred to the acceptor, in the absence of any additional nondipolar quenching resulting from the presence of the acceptor (23Lakowicz J.R. Principle of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar). The value of E is related to the apparent quantities of E D and E A by (26Berman H.A Yguerabide J. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2226-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) E=EA(1−ED+EA)Equation 4 Thus, measurements of the transfer efficiency, using both methods, are not alternatives but parts of the entire analysis used to obtain the true efficiency of the fluorescence energy transfer process,E. The fluorescence energy transfer efficiency between the donor and acceptor dipoles is related to the distance, R, separating the dipoles by Equations 5a and 5b (23Lakowicz J.R. Principle of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar) R=Ro(1−E)E1/6Equation 5a and Ro=9790(κ2n−4φdJ)1/6Equation 5b where R o is the so-called Förster critical distance (in angstroms), the distance at which the transfer efficiency is 50%, κ2 is the orientation factor, φ d is the donor quantum yield in the absence of the acceptor, and n is the refractive index of the medium (n = 1.4) (23Lakowicz J.R. Principle of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar). The overlap integral, J, characterizes the resonance between the donor and acceptor dipoles and has been evaluated by integration of the mutual area of overlap between the donor emission spectrum, F(λ), and the acceptor absorption spectrum, ε A(λ), as defined by (23Lakowicz J.R. Principle of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar) J=∫F(λ)εA(λ)λ4∂λ∫F(λ)∂λEquation 5c The fluorescence transfer efficiency determined for chemically identical donor-acceptor pairs, characterized by the same donor quantum yields, depends on the distance between the donor and the acceptor,R, and factor κ2, describing the mutual orientation of the donor and acceptor dipoles (23Lakowicz J.R. Principle of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar). The factor κ2 cannot be experimentally determined, however, the upper, κmax2, and the lower, κmin2, limit of κ2 can be estimated from the measured limiting anisotropies of the donor and acceptor and the calculated axial depolarization factors, using the procedure described by Dale et al. (27Dale R.E. Esinger J. Blumberg W.E. Biophys. J. 1979; 26: 161-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). When both axial depolarization factors are positive, κmax2 and κmin2 can be calculated from κmax2=23(1+〈dDX〉+〈dAX〉+3〈dDX〉〈dAX〉)Equation 6a and κmin2=231−12(〈dDX〉+〈dAX〉)Equation 6b where <dDx> and <dAx> are the axial depolarization factors for the donor and acceptor, respectively (27Dale R.E. Esinger J. Blumberg W.E. Biophys. J. 1979; 26: 161-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). The axial depolarization factors have been calculated as square roots of the ratios of the limiting anisotropies of the donors and acceptors and their corresponding fundamental anisotropies, r o(r o = 0.4 for CPM and fluorescein) (19Bujalowski W. Klonowska M.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4682-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 25Bujalowski W. Klonowska M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31359-31371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Dale R.E. Esinger J. Blumberg W.E. Biophys. J. 1979; 26: 161-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). The parameter κ2 can assume a value from 0 to 4. For complete random orientation of the acceptor and donor, κ2= 0.67 (23Lakowicz J.R. Principle of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar). However, because the distance between a donor and an acceptor depends upon the 1/6th power of κ2, only the two extreme values (0 or 4) would significantly affect the determined distance. It should be pointed out that the analysis of the possible range of distances between the donor and the acceptor, using κmin2 and κmax2, describes the situation where only a single donor-acceptor pair is used. Another equally rigorous procedure to evaluate the error in the distance determination, although more time consuming and much more expensive, is to use multiple donor-acceptor pairs (28Cantor C.R. Pechukas P. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 2099-2101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The different molecular structures of the different donor and acceptors introduce intrinsic randomization of the orientation of the absorption and emission dipoles. The measurement of a very similar distance using a different donor-acceptor pair, indicates that the orientation of the donor and absorption dipoles is far from the extreme values of 0 or 4, and that the true distance between a donor and an acceptor is very close to the distance obtained using κ2 = 0.67. In the system studied in this work, six fluorescent labels, arranged in a ring, are located at one end of the DnaB hexamer (see below). A fluorescence energy homo-transfer between the same fluorophore molecules may occur in such a system which would complicate the molecular distance estimates. The extent of the homo-transfer was examined by determining the fluorescence anisotropy of the DnaB hexamer as a function of the degree of labeling and by excitation fluorescence anisotropy spectra of the fully labeled DnaB hexamer. None of these approaches showed a measurable homo-transfer, even in the case of the R14C-Fl labeled fluorescein which has a large overlap of its absorption and fluorescence spectra (36Weber G. Trans. Faraday Soc. 1954; 50: 552-555Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). If a set of m identical donors transfers the energy to a single acceptor, as in the cases studied in this work, the average transfer efficiency is weighted by the contributions,E i, from all donors and is defined in general as E=1m∑EiEquation 7 where E i is the transfer efficiency from the individual donor, i, to the acceptor. It should be noted that, if all individual transfer efficiencies, E i, are equal, e.g. in the case where the donors are located at the same distance from the acceptor, the experimentally determined average fluorescence transfer efficiency is then E ≈ (1/m)mE i = E i. The quantum yields of different chromophores used in this work, φ, were determined by the comparative method (29Parker C.A. Reese W.T. Analyst. 1960; 85: 587-592Crossref Google Scholar) we previously described (19Bujalowski W. Klonowska M.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4682-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Quinine bisulfate in 0.1 NH2SO4 and fluorescein in 0.1 NaOH were used as a standard (absolute quantum yield φ = 0.7 and 0.92, respectively) (30Scott T.G. Spencer R.D. Leonard N.J. Weber G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1970; 92: 687-695Crossref Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 31Weber G. Biochem. J. 1960; 75: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The DnaB monomer, which has an elongated shape, is built of two structural domains (7Bujalowski W. Klonowska M.M. Jezewska M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31350-31358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10San Martin M.C. Valpuesta J.M. Stamford N.P.J. Dixon N.E. Carazo J.M. J. Struct.

A small 12-kDa domain at the N terminus of the protein and a large 33-kDa domain at the C terminus are both connected at the hinge region. This structure of a monomer has been visualized in EM studies which also showed that, in the cyclic DnaB hexamer, all protomers are oriented with the small 12-kDa domain in the same direction (10San Martin M.C. Valpuesta J.M. Stamford N.P.J. Dixon N.E. Carazo J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1995; 114: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In R14C-CPM or R14C-Fl, each of the six small 12-kDa domains of the hexamer is labeled with a fluorescent marker, coumarin (CPM) or fluorescein at a specific site (see “Experimental Procedures”). Thus, all six fluorophores in the labeled R14C variant are at the same end of the DnaB hexamer and arranged in a ring. The schematic representation of the DnaB hexamer based on hydrodynamic and EM data is shown in Fig. 1 a. Fluorescence energy transfer from a donor to an acceptor is one of the most intensively used methods in studying macromolecular distances in solution (23Lakowicz J.R. Principle of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar). The overlap of an absorption spectrum of an acceptor with the emission spectrum of a donor is a condition for the fluorescence resonance energy transfer to occur. The fluorescence emission spectrum of R14C-CPM (λex = 425 nm) together with the absorption spectrum of 5′-Fl-dT(pT)19 and 5′-Rh-dT(pT)19, as well as the fluorescence emission spectrum of R14C-Fl (λex = 485 nm), with the absorption spectrum of 5′-Rh-dT(pT)19 in buffer T2 (pH 8.1, 20 °C), containing 100 mm NaCl and 1 mm AMP-PNP, are shown in Fig. 2, a–c. In the case of all three donor-acceptor pairs, there is a very significant spectral overlap of the donor emission with the acceptor absorption spectrum, indicating that efficient fluorescence energy transfer can occur, if the donor and acceptor are in close proximity.

Steroid hormones and vitamin A and D3 metabolites act to repress the expression of cytokines. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) down-modulates activated IL-2 expression at the level transcription, through direct antagonism of the transactivating complex NFAT-1/AP-1 by the vitamin D3 receptor (VDR). We report here that GMCSF transcription in Jurkat T cells is also directly repressed by 1,25-(OH)2D3 and VDR. Among four NFAT/AP-1 elements in the GMCSF enhancer, we have focused on one such element that when multimerized, is sufficient in mediating both activation by NFAT-1 and AP-1 and repression in response to 1,25-(OH)2D3. Although this element does not contain any recognizable vitamin D response elements (VDREs), high affinity DNA binding by recombinant VDR is observed. In contrast to VDR interactions with positive VDREs, this binding is independent of VDR's heterodimeric partner, the retinoid X receptor. Moreover, VDR appears to bind the GMCSF element as an apparent monomer in vitro. Protease digestion patterns of bound VDR, and receptor mutations affecting DNA binding and dimerization, demonstrate that the receptor binds to the negative site in a distinct conformation relative to a positive VDRE, suggesting that the DNA element itself acts as an allosteric effector of VDR function.

More recently, the scope of vitamin D action has broadened with the detection of the nuclear receptor for this ligand, vitamin D3 receptor (VDR), in tissues such as skin, testis, pancreas, colon, muscle, breast, prostate, thymus, and bone marrow. Generally, 1,25-(OH)2D3 acts as a growth inhibitor in many of these cell types. For example, the ligand is a potent inducer of differentiation of promyelocytic leukemia cells (4Abe E. Miyaura C.

The identification of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor gene product, p21Waf1,Cip1, as a direct target of 1,25-(OH)2D3 action in myeloid cells (7Liu M. Lee M.H. Cohen M. Bommakanti M. Freedman L.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 142-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar) provides a direct link between the general actions of this ligand and growth control/differentiation in these cells. Transcription of the p21 gene is directly enhanced in response to 1,25-(OH)2D3 through the binding of VDR to specific regulatory sites in the p21 promoter. VDR, as is typical of many members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, binds to DNA and activates transcription as a heterodimeric complex with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) (8Kliewer S.A.

The architecture of this consensus positive VDRE is two directly repeating hexameric half-sites consisting of the sequence PuGG/TTCA spaced by three nucleotides (DR3) (13Towers T.L. Luisi B.L.

Genes that are down-regulated in response to 1,25-(OH)2D3 include those encoding human and chick parathyroid hormone (PTH) (23Liu S.M. Koszewski N. Lapuz M. Malluche H.H. Olivera A. Russel J. Mol.

Chem. 1989; 264: 3072-3077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), human atrial natriuretic (26Li Q. Gardner D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4934-4939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), interleukin-2 (IL-2) (27Alroy I. Towers T.L. Freedman L.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5789-5799Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), and the rat bone sialoprotein (28Kim R.H. Li J.J. Ogata Y. Yamauchi M. Freedman L.P. Sodek J. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For the chick PTH and rat bone sialoprotein genes, imperfect DR3 elements have been identified at promoter proximal sites through which 1,25-(OH)2D3-mediated repression occurs. However, the promoters for the human PTH, human atrial natriuretic, and human IL-2 genes do not appear to contain canonical DR3-type VDREs that are functionally conferring transrepression. Nevertheless, direct VDR binding has been demonstrated within these promoters. The repressive site identified in the human PTH gene consists of an extended imperfect VDRE half-site as well as some flanking sequence. In the IL-2 promoter, Alroy et al. (27Alroy I. Towers T.L. Freedman L.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5789-5799Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) found that the minimal sequence required to confer repression consists of a sequence known to bind the T cell transcription factor NFAT-1 as well as a weak AP-1 binding site. Included in this sequence is an extended imperfect VDRE half-site. VDR DNA binding was shown to be necessary but not sufficient to confer repression.Our previous study on the mechanism of repression of activated IL-2 transcription by 1,25-(OH)2D3 in T cells provided a molecular explanation of how this ligand acts as a modest immunosuppressing agent. 1,25-(OH)2D3-mediated effects in T lymphocytes were first reported as a decrease in the proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes (29Bhalla A.K. Amento E.P. Krane S.M. Cell. Immunol. 1986; 98: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). This effect was dependent on the expression of the VDR and was accompanied by a decrease in the mRNA levels of IL-2, interferon-γ, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF) (30Rigby W.F.C. Denome S. Fanger M.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 1659-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 31Reichel H. Koeffler H.P. Tobler A. Norman A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Invest. 1987; 79: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Interestingly, VDR is only expressed following activation in T cells (33Yu X.P. Mocharla H. Hustmyer F.G. Manolagas S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7588-7595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore the direct transcriptional repression of a primary response cytokine such as IL-2 and secondary response factors such as GMCSF could lead to a progressive deactivation of the immune response.GMCSF is a glycoprotein that signals through a cell surface receptor of the hematopoietin receptor family. This signaling molecule is synthesized in activated T cells, activated macrophages, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts (34Gasson J.C. Blood. 1991; 77: 1131-1145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GMCSF stimulates the proliferation and subsequent differentiation of leukocyte precursors, but its primary physiological function is to respond to immune activation and to promote the activation of the inflammatory response. An additional role for GMCSF activity was observed in lung tissue of GMCSF knockout mice (35Stanley E. Lieschke G.J. Grail D. Metcalf D. Hodgson G. Gall J.A.M. Maher D.W. Cebon J. Sinickas V. Dunn A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5592-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). These mice displayed defects in the level of lung surfactant produced, and consequently developed respiratory pathologies. Just as the lack of GMCSF expression can promote disease, aberrant expression of GMCSF also has severe implications in human disease. Various leukemias, such as acute myeloid leukemia (36Russell N.H. Blood Rev. 1992; 6: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and juvenile chronic myeloid leukemia (37Freedman M.H. Cohen A. Grunberger T. Bunin N. Luddy R.E. Saunders R.F. Shahidi N. Lau A. Estrov Z. Br. J. Haematol. 1992; 80: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), display a dysregulation of GMCSF. Constitutive expression of GMCSF is also evident in chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and asthma. Down-regulation of GMCSF gene expression may facilitate the gradual diminution of the inflammatory response necessary for a return to the homeostatic state in damaged tissue.We demonstrate here that the down-regulation of GMCSF mRNA observed in response to 1,25-(OH)2D3 in peripheral blood lymphocytes is occurring at the level of transcription. Moreover, this repression is both VDR-dependent and 1,25-(OH)2D3 dose-dependent. We have delineated a 35-bp region within the GMCSF enhancer that confers the 1,25-(OH)2D3-mediated repression. This region does not contain a consensus VDRE, but analogous to the IL-2 locus, it does include an AP-1 site as well as a NFAT-1 element. Using a series of mutant oligonucleotides, we have narrowed down the receptor binding site to seven bases that have some homology to an extended nuclear receptor half-site. In contrast to paradigmatic heterodimer binding, VDR binds the GMCSF element selectively and with high affinity as an apparent monomer, with no detectable contribution by RXR. Moreover, VDR appears to be poised on the DNA in an altered conformation when bound to the negative element as compared with a positive DR3 VDRE, suggesting that the DNA sequence itself is acting as an allosteric effector of VDR function.DISCUSSIONThe paradigm for vitamin D3 receptor binding to DNA elements that confer transcriptional activation in response to 1,25-(OH)2D3 is a dimeric receptor species comprising one molecule of VDR and one molecule of RXR bound to two directly repeating hexameric half-sites (consensus: PuGG/TTCA), which are spaced by three nucleotides, and termed DR3 (reviewed in Ref. 47Freedman L.P. Lemon B.D. Feldman D. Glorieux F.H. Pike J.W. Vitamin D. Academic Press, San Diego1997: 127-148Google Scholar). Each monomeric subunit makes a series of asymmetric interactions at the two DNA-binding domains, and symmetrical contacts within each ligand-binding domain. The heterodimeric complex can then presumably interact directly with the preinitiation complex or indirectly through a number of coactivators (15Lemon B.D. Fondell J.D. Freedman L.P. Mol. Cell.

This of course is all contingent on ligand binding, and the role of ligand in all of this appears to be manifold. Ligand binding increases the affinity of VDR for RXR (9Cheskis B. Freedman L.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3329-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 10Cheskis B. Freedman L.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3309-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 54MacDonald P.N.

Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar, 56Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D.

Nature. 1995; 378: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar), and it enhances interactions with components of the transcriptional machinery, presumably resulting in the stabilization of the preinitiation complex so that productive initiation can occur.Since transcriptional repression is essentially the antagonism of all of these events, it is not surprising that the mechanism of transrepression by a nuclear receptor as we currently understand it is fundamentally different from activation. A number of genes have been described that are targets of repression by steroid and nuclear receptors, and a variety of mechanisms ranging from DNA-independent inhibition of positive factor (22Schule R.

However, what has not been adequately accounted for is how the same trans-factor, i.e. a steroid/nuclear receptor, can activate some target genes and repress others. An attractive hypothesis proposed by Yamamoto and others (62Leftsin J.A. Thomas J.R. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2842-2856Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) is that in scenarios involving direct DNA binding, it is the DNA element itself that acts as an allosteric effector of receptor structure/function. This is feasible since in those cases where negative elements have been delineated, they rarely resemble positive elements (24Demay M.B., K., M.S. DeLuca H.F. Kronenberg H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8097-8101Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 26Li Q. Gardner D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4934-4939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kim R.H. Li J.J.

Chem. 1988; 263: 2203-2208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the interaction of the receptor with a noncanonical recognition sequence might induce an alternative structure that would then be incapable of activating transcription, but has also gained a repressive function, possibly by precluding the binding of another, unrelated positive factor, such as Fos and Jun.Four key pieces of data presented in this work are consistent with DNA acting as an allosteric effector as an explanation for how VDR represses the activated transcription of the GMCSF gene. First, we clearly observe specific receptor binding to an element we have defined to 7 bp at −2758 to −2765 consisting of the sequence GCTTTCC in the GMCSF enhancer. Second, VDR binding to this element induces a conformation in the receptor that is distinct from its apparent conformation when it binds a positive DR3 VDRE, as deduced from both limited protease digestion and from DNA binding and dimerization mutants that are unable to bind and activate from the DR3 but can bind and repress from the GMCSF negative element with near or equal affinity and potency as wild-type receptor. Third, whereas VDR binds to and activates transcription from the DR3 as a VDR·RXR heterodimer, RXR is completely excluded from the VDR binding species at the negative element. Fourth, VDR appears to bind the negative element as a monomer. The last two observations are consistent with what we have previously demonstrated concerning how 1,25-(OH)2D3affects the dimerization state of VDR (9Cheskis B. Freedman L.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3329-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In the presence of RXR, 1,25-(OH)2D3 promotes heterodimerization with VDR, but in the absence of RXR, the ligand actually inhibits homodimerization and can in fact dissociate a preformed VDR homodimer to monomers. Thus, as depicted in Fig. 8, we propose that the GM550 element allosterically induces VDR into a conformation that precludes dimerization with RXR. Preformed VDR-RXR heterodimers would not be able to bind this element, as we have shown in vitro, or the element itself would actually induce the dimeric complex to dissociate to monomers. 1,25-(OH)2D3 would enhance DNA binding by preventing homodimerization and stabilizing monomers, since it is the monomeric species that is the high affinity binding form on the GM550 negative element.As stated earlier, the GM550 negative element does not contain a canonical VDRE. It does, however, include binding sites for the activating factors NFAT-1 and AP-1 family members. Cockerill et al. (42Cockerill P.N. Shannon M.F. Bert A.G. Ryan G.R. Vadas M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) showed previously that occupancy at both of these sites is absolutely required for maximal activation of the GMCSF gene, in addition to occupancy at three other NFAT/AP-1 sites within the defined enhancer region. Since the negative element we have described here at position 550 overlaps an NFAT binding site, one possible mechanism for VDR-mediated transrepression is simple steric hindrance, in which a transcriptionally inert VDR monomer blocks the association of NFAT-1 protein to one half of the NFAT-1/AP-1 site. We are also interested in addressing the possibility that a similar antagonistic effect on NFAT binding to the additional NFAT/AP-1 sites within this enhancer may also contribute to the 1,25-(OH)2D3 effect on this gene. The overall inability of NFAT-1 to bind one or more of these sites would effectively block transcriptional activation of GMCSF (42Cockerill P.N. Shannon M.F. Bert A.G. Ryan G.R. Vadas M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Targeting NFAT is also a strategy important immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin A utilize, but at the level of NFAT dephosphorylation and nuclear localization (63Beals C.R. Clipstone N.A. Ho S.N. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 824-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 64Flanagan W.M. Corthesy B. Bram R.J. Crabtree G.R.

Moreover, the apparent allosteric changes the negative element is impinging on VDR may be translated into the creation of new protein surfaces. New surfaces normally inaccessible could then recruit a distinct set of interacting factors. Such factors might also be necessary for antagonizing the positive effects of AP-1 proteins and/or NFAT-1. Co-occupancy of VDR and the positive transactivating factors on the GM550 site is also a possible mechanism we cannot rule out. However, in this model, VDR would somehow have to lock NFAT-1 or AP-1 into an “off” state such that they could no longer transactivate, perhaps by directly interacting with one or both and precluding a productive interaction with a coactivator or basal factor. In this case, the simultaneous binding of VDR and NFAT proteins at the GM500 site is unlikely since their binding sites appear to overlap. Nonetheless, this model must be considered along with others; we are currently addressing the nature of VDR's interaction with AP-1 and NFAT proteins at the GM550 site to determine the molecular mechanism of this repression. Preliminary data from nuclear extracts prepared from Jurkat cells treated with activating agents and 1,25-(OH)2D3show a disruption of a PMA/PHA-inducible DNA binding complex. However, we have yet to show occupancy of this element by VDR from these extracts and are currently working to address this.Previous work from our laboratory identified the IL-2 gene as a direct target of 1,25-(OH)2D3-mediated repression. We believe this begins to explain the molecular basis of the immunosuppressive effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3at the level of the activated T cell, but not completely. The present study extends this work by identifying the GMCSF locus as an additional direct target of 1,25-(OH)2D3, and suggests a more diverse role of vitamin D action in the immune system. The primary role of GMCSF is to activate mature granulocytes and macrophages, thereby eliciting the body's response to infection and initiating inflammatory responses (67Kato M. Liu M.C.

This response clearly must be tightly regulated such that activation occurs only at appropriate times, and that a gradual down-modulation of the response is initiated. We b"

Glucose initiates changes in membrane potential via an increase in cytosolic ATP, derived from the glycolytic reduction of NAD+, that results in block of ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP) (8Cook D.L.

Consequently, the membrane potential slowly depolarizes from approximately −65 mV, whereupon trains of action potentials occur (the active phase), interrupted by quiescent periods of hyperpolarization (the silent phase), both forming the so-called electrical bursting behavior characteristic of glucose-stimulated islets (10Henquin J.C.

Closely coupled with this bursting activity are oscillations in [Ca2+] i that ultimately determine the oscillatory nature of insulin secretion (5Roe M.W. Lancaster M.E. Mertz R.J. Worley III, J.F.

The mechanism underlying these oscillations in membrane potential, [Ca2+] i, and insulin secretion remains uncertain, but most likely stems from a cyclical activation of an ion conductance governed indirectly by metabolism, changes in [Ca2+] i, or some hitherto uncharacterized intracellular mediator (15Satin L.S.

Confounding an early resolution of this puzzle is the profusion of membrane currents present in β-cells. Thus, in addition to ATP-sensitive K+ current (I KATP) and voltage-dependent Ca2+(I Ca) and Na+ currents, delayed rectifier K+ (I KDR), Ca2+-activated K+(I KCa), and G-protein-coupled inward rectifier K+ currents have been described, all of which could contribute to the regulation of the β-cell membrane potential by glucose (17Ashcroft F.M.

McIntyre M.S. Spencer B. Dukes I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32055-32058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

We have thus utilized this cell line to characterize and identify the membrane conductance that underlies glucose-stimulated oscillatory activity.

Products were run on 1.5% agarose gels, visualized by staining with ethidium bromide, and transferred to Hybond-N+ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for subsequent analysis by Southern blot. Oligonucleotides corresponding to sequences within the amplified mtrp-1–3, -5, and -6 cDNAs were end-labeled with 32P and hybridized overnight at 42 °C in 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's, 0.5% SDS, 125 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA: trp-1 5′-TGTGTGGGCATCTTCTGCGAACAGC-3′; trp-25′-AGGAA-TCCGAGAAGCTAGGCAATT-3′; trp35′-GGCCAAAGTAAATCCTGCTTTTA-3′; trp-55′-GACCAGAGCTATTGATGAACCTAAC-3′; trp-65′-AGTCAGTGGTCATTAA-CTACA-3′. After hybridization, blots were washed in 2× SSC at room temperature for 30 min and at 50 °C in 1× SSC. After washing, blots were exposed to X-Omat film for 5 to 20 min at room temperature. The mtrp-4 fragment was probed with the 400-base pair cDNA itself, after labeling with 32P using a random primer kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The blot was hybridized overnight at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, 125 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. After hybridization, the blot was washed in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min at room temperature, and in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C for 30 min. The blot was exposed to X-Omat film for 1 h at −70 °C. Sequenced probes were then subcloned for use in Northern blot analysis. For RNA isolation, βTC3 cells were grown to near confluence, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in solution containing 4 m guanidine thiocyanate, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5% lauryl sarcosinate. Total RNA was purified by centrifugation through a 0.9-ml cushion of 5.7m CsCl in a TLS-55 rotor at 53000 rpm for 4 h in the Optima TL ultracentrifuge (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA). Mouse brain RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol and purified by centrifugation through CsCl as described above. RNA was size-fractionated in the presence of ethidium bromide (50 μg/ml) in a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel at 100 V and transferred to Hybond N nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The probes used were the subcloned PCR products described in the previous section, except in the case of mtrp-4, for which a full-length mtrp-4 clone derived from a βTC3 cDNA library was employed. 2F. Qian and L. H. Philipson, manuscript in preparation. Probes were gel-purified and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Prime-It random primer labeling kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After overnight hybridization at 68 °C in ExpressHybe solution (CLONTECH) blots were washed to a final stringency of 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C and exposed to BioMax MS-1 film with BioMax intensifying screen (Eastman Kodak Corp.) for 18 h to 1 week at −80 °C. In contrast to normal mouse islets, the murine insulinoma cell line, βTC3-neo, does not usually respond to a step increase in glucose concentration with regular oscillatory increases in [Ca2+] i. Instead, a slow rise in [Ca2+] i occurs with occasional intermittent spikes (Fig. 1 A). Exposure of βTC3-neo cells to 20 mm TEA, a blocker of delayed rectifier K+ channels, however, permitted the generation by glucose of large regular oscillations in [Ca2+] i of a type normally seen in mouse islets exposed to nutrients (5Roe M.W.

In the absence of glucose, TEA was without effect (n = 5). This glucose dependence suggests that the governing ionic conductance is carried by I KATP as in the case of primary β-cells,i.e. I KATP sets the resting membrane potential (17Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1989; 54: 87-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 18Dukes I.D. Philipson L.H. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 845-853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, activation of I KATP with 250 μm diazoxide fully suppressed the TEA-activated [Ca2+] i oscillations (Fig. 1 B). The [Ca2+] i oscillations were also immediately abolished by exposure to either low Ca2+-containing external solutions (50 μm EGTA, no added Ca2+) or 1 μm nitrendipine, indicating their dependence on depolarization-triggered Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCC) (Fig. 1 C). It has been previously suggested that glucose-induced electrical and [Ca2+] i oscillations result from oscillations in metabolism (15Satin L.S. Smolen P.D. Endocrine. 1994; 2: 677-687Google Scholar, 31Longo E.A. Tornheim K. Deeney J.T. Varnum B.A. Tillotson D. Prentki M. Corkey B.E. J. Biol.

However, the experiments shown in Fig. 2 (A and B) would indicate that direct modulation of plasma membrane conductances alone is insufficient to induce Ca2+ oscillations. In the absence of glucose, exposure of βTC3-neo cells to 100 μmtolbutamide to block I KATP induced [Ca2+] i oscillations only in the presence of TEA that were indistinguishable from those generated by glucose (Fig. 2 A). Furthermore, membrane depolarization induced by 20 mm KCl was able to similarly substitute for glucose in permitting TEA to induce [Ca2+] i oscillations (Fig. 2 B). Thus, a necessity for the conductance regulating the [Ca2+] i oscillations to be coupled to oscillations in KATP activity or glucose metabolism seems excluded. We were, however, able to measure marked alterations in the [Ca2+] i oscillations stimulated by glucose following exposure to thapsigargin, a selective inhibitor of the ER Ca2+ ATPases (33Jackson T.R. Patterson S.I. Thastrup O. Hanley M.R. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 34Roe M.W. Lancaster M.E. Mertz R.J. Worley III, J.F. Dukes I.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: E852-E862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although thapsigargin caused no detectable alteration in [Ca2+] i in the absence of glucose, addition of thapsigargin following exposure to glucose and TEA converted the resulting [Ca2+] i oscillations into a sustained rise in [Ca2+] i (Fig. 3 A). Previous studies in mouse pancreatic islets and β-cells have indicated that the effect of maneuvers to deplete intracellular Ca2+ stores, as exemplified by the action of thapsigargin, result from the activation of I CRAN (12Worley III, J.F.

Physiol. 1994; 266: E852-E862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The principal permeating ion carrying the depolarizing current through I CRAN in mouse β-cells is Na+(21Worley III, J.F. McIntyre M.S. Spencer B. Dukes I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32055-32058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether I CRAN was involved in regulating the glucose-dependent oscillations in βTC3-neo cells, we therefore examined the effects of Na+ substitution. Reduction of external Na+ by substitution with the non-permeant cation N-methyl-d-glucamine largely suppressed the [Ca2+] i oscillations induced in βTC3-neo cells by glucose and TEA (Fig. 3 B). Similarly, application of SKF 96365, a putative blocker of intracellular Ca2+ store release-activated channels (35Rink T.J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 268: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) reversibly abolished the glucose-stimulated oscillations in [Ca2+] i (Fig. 3 C). Nonspecific suppressive effects of SKF 96365 on [Ca2+] i were ruled out by the observation that KCl-induced elevations in [Ca2+] i were unimpaired (Fig. 3 D). Application of 100 pm MTX, an agent that directly activates nonselective cation channels in HL60 cells (36Musgrave I.F. Seifert R. Schultz G. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and I CRAN in mouse β-cells (21Worley III, J.F. McIntyre M.S. Spencer B. Dukes I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32055-32058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), caused an immediate sustained rise in [Ca2+] i, further indicating the prominent role of this channel in regulating [Ca2+] i in βTC3 cells (Fig. 4 A). Similar to its effect on glucose-stimulated [Ca2+] i oscillations, application of SKF 96365 also suppressed the MTX-dependent elevation in [Ca2+] i in βTC3-neo cells (Fig. 4 B). Finally, diazoxide application was able to completely reverse the MTX-induced [Ca2+] i rise (Fig. 4 C), indicating that I CRAN was a relatively small current that could be overridden by concomitant activation of I KATP. To confirm the actual presence of a nonselective cation channel in βTC3-neo cells, we carried out perforated patch recordings. Application of 1–100 pm MTX caused the activation of a non-inactivating current with a reversal potential of −10 mV (Fig. 5 A), properties identical to I CRAN observed in mouse β-cells (21Worley III, J.F. McIntyre M.S. Spencer B. Dukes I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32055-32058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); furthermore, both SKF 96365 and external Na+ removal were able to reversibly attenuate the MTX-activated current (Fig. 5,A and B). These findings suggest that the increase in [Ca2+] i induced by MTX, and the ablation of the glucose-stimulated [Ca2+] i oscillations by SKF 96365 or external Na+ removal, were secondary to activation and block of a Ca2+ s"

Their interaction with a variety of activated tyrosine kinase receptors is well documented, but their actual function remains a mystery. The Grb10 SH2 domain was isolated from a two-hybrid screen using the MEK1 kinase as a bait. We show that this unusual SH2 domain interacts, in a phosphotyrosine-independent manner, with both the Raf1 and MEK1 kinases. Mutation of the MEK1 Thr-386 residue, which is phosphorylated by mitogen-activated protein kinase in vitro, reduces binding to Grb10 in a two-hybrid assay. Interaction of Grb10 with Raf1 is constitutive, while interaction between Grb10 and MEK1 needs insulin treatment of the cells and follows mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Random mutagenesis of the SH2 domain demonstrated that the Arg-βB5 and Asp-EF2 residues are necessary for binding to the epidermal growth factor and insulin receptors as well as to the two kinases. In addition, we show that a mutation in Ser-βB7 affects binding only to the receptors, while a mutation in Thr-βC5 abrogates binding only to MEK1. Finally, transfection of Grb10 genes with specific mutations in their SH2 domains induces apoptosis in HTC-IR and COS-7 cells. These effects can be competed by co-expression of the wild type protein, suggesting that these mutants act by sequestering necessary signaling components.

The function of the Grb7/10/14 proteins remains obscure. They are currently classified as adapter proteins, since they have no obvious enzymatic function and contain several conserved polypeptide-binding regions in addition to their carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain (see Fig. 1). A small proline-rich region in the NH2 terminus fits the consensus sequence for SH3-binding domains. In fact, in vitro binding by the Grb10 proline-rich domain to the c Abl SH3 domain has been demonstrated (10Frantz J.D. Giorgetti-Peraldi S. Ottinger E.A. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2659-2667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Furthermore, all three of these proteins contain a central Pleckstrin homology domain. Similar elements have been shown to mediate protein-protein and/or protein-lipid interactions (for a review, see Ref. 13Shaw G. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The Grb7/10/14 genes are expressed in a tissue-specific pattern, and there is ample evidence of alternative splicing of the transcripts (1Margolis B. Silvennoinen O. Comoglio F. Roonprapunt C.

Some of these splicing events result in the expression of proteins with altered properties; hGrb10β 2We use the nomenclature for Grb10 splice variants that was agreed upon by several researchers and is maintained on the World Wide Web at www.bri.nrc.ca/thomasweb/grb7.htm. contains a deletion in the amino-terminal half of its Pleckstrin homology domain (6Liu F.

Finally, the Grb7/10/14 proteins can be phosphorylated in vivo, and their levels of phosphorylation are regulated by hormone treatment (2Stein D. Wu J. Fuqua S.A.W. Roonprapunt C. Yajnik V.

Overexpression of hGrb10β in Chinese hamster ovary-IR cells reduces insulin-dependent pp60 and insulin receptor substrate-1 phosphorylation and diminishes PI-3 kinase activation (6Liu F. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10287-10291Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Others have observed that microinjection of the Grb10 SH2 domain partially inhibits mitogenesis in insulin- or insulin-like growth factor-I-treated Rat1 fibroblasts but not in cells treated with EGF or serum (14O'Neill T.J.

These results appear to be in contradiction with the work of Morrione et al. (15Morrione A. Valentinis B. Resnicoff M. Xu S.-Q. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26382-26387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), whose cell lines overexpressing mGrb10α show growth reduction in the presence of insulin growth factor-I but not insulin. Unlike the microinjection experiments, these cells do not show an inhibition in S phase entry but rather an accumulation in the S and G2 phases. These contradictions might be explained by the use of different cell lines, experimental procedures, or Grb10 splicing variants. As for Grb7 and Grb14, both have been shown to be overexpressed in breast and prostate cancer tumors and cell lines (2Stein D. Wu J. Fuqua S.A.W. Roonprapunt C. Yajnik V. D'Eustachio P. Moskow J.J.

The receptors that are recognized by the Grb7/10/14 family share the ability to activate the mitogenic MAP kinase signal transduction pathway (reviewed in Ref. 17Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar). In this report, we present evidence that at least two members this pathway, Raf1 and MEK1, can interact with the SH2 domain of the Grb10 adapter protein. In some cultured cells, binding to Raf1 is constitutive, while the interaction of Grb10 with MEK1 is insulin-dependent. Interestingly, these interactions are phosphotyrosine-independent, and binding of MEK1 to Grb10 appears to be regulated through the retrophosphorylation of MEK1 by the MAP kinases. Finally, we have identified point mutations that affect the specificity of the Grb10 SH2 domain. Overexpression of these mutants was found to induce apoptosis in cultured cells. Most of our chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Restriction and modification enzymes as well as the plasmids and resins used for the expression and purification of GST and MBP fusions proteins were obtained from New England Biolabs or from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Sequencing reactions were performed with a DNA sequencing kit from Perkin-Elmer and separated on an Applied Biosystems DNA Sequencer model 370A. PCRs used the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Boehringer Mannheim). Western blots were performed on Immobilon membranes (Millipore Corp.). The Grb10 (K-20), and Raf1 (C-12) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, the MEK1-NT antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology, and antibodies against the maltose-binding protein and activated ERK came from New England Biolabs. The anti-Flag (M2) monoclonal antibody was from Eastman Kodak Co. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Bio-Rad, and the ECL Western blotting detection reagents were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.

Following PCR amplification with the ANO-35 (GGGGGATCCAAATGCCCAAGAAGCCG) and ANO-36 (GCGCTCGAGGCTCTTTTGTTGCTTCCC) primers, the coding sequences of the full-length human MEK1 gene (a gift from S. Pelech) were introduced between the BamHI and XhoI sites of the pEG202 LexA fusion plasmid, resulting in the pAN104 construct. Two-hybrid screening of 2 × 106 primary transformants, from a human fetal brain cDNA library, was then performed exactly as described (18Golemis E.A. Gyuris J. Brent R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 20.1.1-20.1.3Google Scholar, 19Gyuris J. Golemis E.A. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). EcoRI and XhoI sites were introduced around the coding sequence of the human Raf1 gene (a gift from S. Meloche) by PCR amplification. The fragment was then subcloned in the same sites of the pEG202 vector, yielding pAN130. A similar PCR amplification was also used to insert the regulatory (aa 1–330) or catalytic (aa 331–649) domains of Raf1, as well as the cytoplasmic domain of the insulin (aa 974–1370) and EGF (aa 672–1210) receptors, between the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pEG202. Subcloning of the partial MEK1 fusions in the pEG202 vector were performed as follows; N308, PCR amplification of the partial MEK1 gene with the ANO-35 andCTCGAGCCATGGGAGGTCGGCTGTCCTTCC primers; N293, subcloned 5′SmaI fragment of pAN104 plasmid; N220, removed 3′NcoI/XhoI fragments from pAN104; C304, subcloned the EcoRI/XhoI insert of the pMB6 cDNA (which encodes aa 304–392 of MEK1). Quantitative β-galactosidase assays were performed using a modification of the permeabilized cell assay of Guarente (20Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in 1.5 ml of media to an approximate A 600 of 0.5–1.0. They were then spun down for 2 min at 5000 rpm in a microcentrifuge and resuspended in 1.25 ml of Z-buffer (60 mmNa2HPO4·7H2O, 40 mmNaH2PO4·H2O, 10 mmKCl, 1 mm MgSO4·7H2O, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0). We used 750 μl of the suspension to determine cell density by measuring the A 600 (measuring cell density at this step reduced the introduction of errors due to loss of pelleted cells). We then added 25 μl of CHCl3 and 10 μl of 0.1% SDS to the rest of the cell suspension and vortexed at top speed for 10 s. The enzymatic reaction was started by the addition of 100 μl of ONPG solution (4 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside in Z-buffer) followed by incubation at 28 °C. Upon development of a pale yellow color, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 250 μl of 1m Na2CO3. The samples were centrifuged at top speed for 2 min, and the amount of product was measured at A 420. The activity, expressed as β-galactosidase units, is calculated with the formula, (1000 ×A 420)/(A 600 × reaction time (min)). Two μg of DNA from a HeLa Cell cDNA library was used as a template in a PCR reaction with the GACGAATTCGAACCCATGGCTTTAGCCGGCTGCCCAG and GACCTCGAGCACAGACCGCTTCTTCACTCCAG primers. The resulting 2.2-kilobase pair fragment was fully sequenced on both strands and contains the coding sequences of the hGrb10ζ gene flanked by EcoRI and XhoI sites. EcoRI/XhoI fragments containing the hGrb10ζ gene or the SH2 domain encoded by the pMB58 cDNA were subcloned in the pMAL-c2 plasmid. The MBP-hGrb10ζ and MBP-SH2 fusion proteins were then purified from Escherichia coli UT5600 cells by affinity chromatography on amylose resin columns as described by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). Plasmids containing the GST-MEK1 and GST-ERK1 constructs were obtained from S. Pelech, while the SEK1 gene was obtained from Jim Woodgett. Expression and purification of GST-MEK1, GST-SEK1, and GST-ERK1 were performed as described (21Zheng C.-F. Guan K.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23933-23939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GST-Raf1 was constructed by inserting the EcoRI/XhoI insert of pAN130 in pGEX-5X-1 and purified as described by Zhang et al. (22Zhang X.F. Marshall M.S. Avruch J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). For the resin-binding assays, one μg of the MBP fusion protein was incubated with 10–50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose resin, loaded with the GST-kinase fusions, in 1 ml of NETN buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 30 min at 4 °C. The resins were then spun down and washed three times with 1 ml of cold PBS containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis buffer and detected by immunoblotting with an anti-MBP antibody. For the phosphatase assays, the GST-Raf1 and GST-MEK1 resins were first incubated with 0–4 units of potato acid phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim) for 20 min at 30 °C in 40 mmPipes, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The resins were then washed three times with 1 ml of NETN before being used in the resin-binding assays. Site-directed mutagenesis of the Arg-βB5 residue was done by overlap extension PCR (23Pogulis R.J. Vallejo A.N. Pease L.R. Trower M.K. Methods in Molecular Biology: In Vitro Mutagenesis Protocols. 57. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1996: 167-176Google Scholar). Random PCR mutagenesis of the pMB58 insert was performed according to Fromant et al. (24Fromant M. Blanquet S. Plateau P. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The amplified fragment was then cleaved with EcoRI and XhoI and ligated back into pJG4–5. Following transformation in E. coli, colonies from >104 transformants were inoculated in 100 ml of 2YT plus 100 μg/ml ampicillin and grown for 4 h at 37 °C. Plasmids from this mutagenized library were then purified and used to transform Saccharomyces cerevisiae RFY206. One thousand yeast colonies were patched on glucose Trp− plates, which were subsequently replica-plated to generate four copies. One plate was kept as a master, while the other three were mated to lawns of S. cerevisiae EGY48 cells previously transformed with the pSH18–34 β-galactosidase reporter plasmid as well as one of either the pAN129 (LexA-EGF receptor COOH terminus), pAN138 (LexA-IR COOH terminus), pAN168 (LexA-RAF NH2 terminus), or pAN104 (LexA-MEK1) bait plasmids. Following selection of the diploids on glucose His− Trp− Ura− plates, the cells were replica-plated to galactose/raffinose His−Leu− Trp− Ura− plates and scored for interaction. Plasmids from potentially interesting mutants were reisolated from the RFY206 master plates, sequenced, and retransformed in haploid EGY48 cells along with the pSH18–34 reporter and LexA fusion plasmids. Binding specificity was confirmed by quantitative β-galactosidase assays on at least four independent transformants. 293 HEK, COS-7, and HTC-IR (25Sbraccia P. Wong K.Y. Brunetti A. Rafaeloff R. Trischitta V. Hawley D.M. Goldfine I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4902-4907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) cell lines were maintained in DMEM, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (along with 400 μg/ml G418 for the HTC-IR), at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The 8-aa Flag immunological tag was added at the carboxyl-terminal end of the hGrb10ζ polypeptide by PCR amplification followed by subcloning in the EcoRI/XhoI sites of the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen), yielding pAN185. Transient transfections with lipofectamine were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Incubation with the DNA-lipid complexes was carried on for 5 h followed by the addition of one volume of DMEM plus 20% fetal bovine serum. Twenty-four to forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were starved overnight in DMEM plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin and then induced for 2–30 min with 100 nm insulin. Following hormone treatment, cells were washed with cold PBS, lysed for 10 min in lysis buffer (50 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1.5% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm sodium vanadate) and spun down at maximum speed in a cold microcentrifuge for 10 min. Protein concentration was estimated with the Bio-Rad protein assay. The adenovirus (AV) vector used in this report is a modification of the human strain 5 in which the E1a, E1b, and E3 regions are deleted (26Lamarche N. Massie B. Richer M. Paradis H. Langelier Y. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The insulin receptor cDNA was isolated from the CMVneo plasmid (a gift of A. Ullrich). The resulting 4.2-kilobase pair ClaI–SpeII fragment was blunted with Klenow and cloned in the EcoRV site of the pAdcmvpoly(A) transfer vector (a gift of B. Massie). The 1.6-kilobase pair EcoRI–XhoI fragment encoding the full-length hGrb10ζ was also blunted with Klenow and cloned in the EcoRV site of the transfer vector. The homologous recombination of the replication-defective human type 5 AV, large scale production, purification, and titration of the recombinant AV have been described in detail (27Acsadi G. Jani A. Massie B. Simoneau M. Holland P. Blaschuk K. Karpati G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 579-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). All recombinant AV were stored at a concentration of 1–4 × 108 plaque-forming units/ml in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For the infections, 293 cells were transduced at a multiplicity of infection of 1 (1 plaque-forming unit/cell) for 2 h with stocks of either a control recombinant AV (Ad DE1/DE3) or recombinant AV (Ad-IR/Ad-Grb). Transduced cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and then starved for 24 h in DMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were stimulated for 5 min with 100 nm insulin. The medium was then aspirated, and the cells were washed twice with PBS and solubilized in lysis buffer. Protein samples were diluted to equal concentration with lysis buffer and then incubated with the antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein A- or Protein G-Sepharose beads were then added, and the samples were incubated for another 1 h. The beads were then washed three times with PBS, and the bound proteins were released by boiling in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. The RL (GCTTTTTCTCCTCCTTGACAGCCAGAG), TS (GCATTTGTACTCTCACTGTGTCATCACC) and SC (CTCCTCCGTGACTGCCAGAGTAATCC) primers were used to introduce SH2 domain mutations in the pAN185 plasmid using the Chameleon kit from Stratagene. The resulting pAN200, pAN208, and pAN209 plasmids express Grb10-R520L, Grb10-T531S, and Grb10-S522C, respectively. One million HTC-IR cells or 1–2 × 105 COS-7 cells were inoculated in 35-mm wells and co-transfected with 0.5 μg of pAdcMV5GFPQ (a gift from B. Massie) along with 1 μg of either the pcDNA3 vector alone or one of the Grb10 expression plasmids. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were observed in a fluorescence microscope. Cells that were small, round, and showed nuclear fragmentation or condensation following Hoecht staining were counted as apoptotic. HTC-IR cells were also washed in PBS, trypsinized, and analyzed by flow cytometry. For the detection of apoptotic cells by the TUNEL assay, we omitted the GFP plasmid and used the ApoBrdU kit and MPlus software (Phoenix Flow Systems). The SH2 domain of Grb10 was isolated from the two-hybrid screen of a human fetal brain cDNA library using the full-length MAP kinase kinase MEK1. Our screen of 2 × 106 primary transformants resulted in the isolation of five independent genes. The pMB58 cDNA 3GenBank™ accession number AF000018. is almost identical to the 3′-end of the Grb10 gene (6Liu F. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10287-10291Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 10Frantz J.D. Giorgetti-Peraldi S. Ottinger E.A. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol.

A sequence comparison (Fig. 1 B) between pMB58 and published Grb10 sequences suggests that this cDNA represents a novel splice variant with modifications in the extreme amino-terminal end of the SH2 domain. The borders between the regions of high and low sequence homology all contain sequences that are consistent with intron-exon borders. The variable region encoded by pMB58 still contains all the residues that have been shown to be important for SH2 domain function, namely a Trp-Phe-His motif in the first β-sheet as well as a conserved arginine residue 2 amino acids into the first α-helix (Fig. 1 C). Unfortunately, we were unable to isolate longer Grb10 cDNAs from the fetal brain library. Using primers based on published sequence data (6Liu F. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10287-10291Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), we isolated by PCR the coding sequence of a full-length human Grb10 gene from a HeLa cell cDNA library. Sequencing of the 2.2-kilobase pair fragment revealed that this clone is a hybrid between hGrb10β (6Liu F. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10287-10291Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and hGrb10γ (10Frantz J.D. Giorgetti-Peraldi S. Ottinger E.A. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol.

(28Dong L.Q. Du H. Porter S.G. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Lee A.V. Mandarino J. Fan J. Yee D. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29104-29112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), hGrb10ζ. 2We use the nomenclature for Grb10 splice variants that was agreed upon by several researchers and is maintained on the World Wide Web at www.bri.nrc.ca/thomasweb/grb7.htm., 4GenBankTM accession numberAF000017. It contains the longer amino-terminal sequences found in hGrb10β as well as the complete Pleckstrin homology domain seen in the other human and mouse variants. Inclusion of the pMB58 SH2 domain variant into this nomenclature will have to await the isolation of a full-length cDNA. Two forms of Grb10 were thus used in our experiments. The full-length Grb10 protein encoded by the hGRB10ζ variant was used in most experiments, while for simplicity, experiments using the SH2 domain used the sequences of the pMB58 clone. Both the full-length hGrb10ζ protein and the SH2 domain initially isolated in the pMB58 cDNA were purified from bacterial extracts as fusions with the E. coli MBP. To confirm that the full-length hGrb10ζ could also bind to MEK1, we incubated the MBP-SH2 and the MBP-hGrb10ζ fusion proteins with glutathione-Sepharose resins loaded either with GST control protein or with GST fusions of various kinases. Interestingly, we found that MBP-SH2 was not only retained by the GST-MEK1 resin but also by GST-Raf1. We also observed binding by the full-length MBP-hGrb10ζ protein to the GST-MEK1 (Fig. 2 C) and GST-Raf1 resins (Fig. 3), indicating that the modifications in the pMB58 SH2 domain are not solely responsible for this binding specificity.Figure 3Grb10 binds to phosphorylated Raf1 and MEK1. Glutathione-Sepharose resins, loaded with GST-Raf1 or GST-MEK1, were incubated with 0–4 units of potato acid phosphatase and then extensively washed. They were then used in a resin-binding assay on MBP-hGrb10ζ. The amount of precipitated MBP fusion was determined by an anti-MBP immunoblot (top panels), while the integrity of the resin-bound kinases was confirmed by Coomassie staining (bottom panels).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-"

This regulatory cascade shows striking similarities with the cytokine-induced activation cascade of NF-κB during the inflammatory response in mammals. Here, we have studied the regulation of the IκB homologue Cactus in the fat body during the immune response. We observe that the cactusgene is up-regulated in response to immune challenge. Interestingly, the expression of the cactus gene is controlled by the spätzle/Toll/cactus gene pathway, indicating that the cactus gene is autoregulated. We also show that two Cactus isoforms are expressed in the cytoplasm of fat body cells and that they are rapidly degraded and resynthesized after immune challenge. This degradation is also dependent on the Toll signaling pathway. Altogether, our results underline the striking similarities between the regulation of IκB and cactusduring the immune response.

This degradation is also dependent on the Toll signaling pathway. Altogether, our results underline the striking similarities between the regulation of IκB and cactusduring the immune response. Transcription factors containing the Rel homology domain have been implicated in a number of developmental and physiological processes, including dorsoventral patterning and immune response in Drosophila, mammalian acute phase response, and lymphocyte differentiation (reviewed in Refs. 1Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4602) Google Scholar, 2Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev.

In mammals, NF-κB is a generic name for a number of Rel proteins (p50, p52, RelA, and RelB), which associate as homo- or heterodimers (reviewed in Refs. 1Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4602) Google Scholar and 2Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). This transactivator plays a pivotal role in the regulation of immune and inflammatory response genes. NF-κB is retained in unstimulated cells in the cytoplasm by its inhibitor IκB and migrates into the nucleus after rapid degradation of IκB in response to activation by cytokines such as interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor α (reviewed in Refs. 1Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4602) Google Scholar and 2Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, the embryonic dorsoventral regulatory pathway comprises 12 known maternal effect genes (reviewed in Ref. 5Morisato D. Anderson K. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 371-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The end result of the activation of this pathway is the nuclear translocation of the Rel transcription factor Dorsal. Four components of this pathway, Toll (TL), Pelle (PLL), Cactus (CACT), and DORSAL (DL) are homologous to members of the interleukin-1 receptor/NF-κB pathway. The cytoplasmic domain of TL, a transmembrane receptor protein (6Hashimoto C. Hudson K.L. Anderson K.V. Cell. 1988; 52: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar), is homologous to the cytoplasmic domain of the interleukin-1 receptor (7Gay N.J. Keith F.J.

Localized activation of the TL receptor in the ventral region of the embryo by its ligand, the spätzle (SPZ) protein, causes disruption of the DL-CACT complex and the subsequent nuclear translocation of DL (14Morisato D.

The striking structural and functional similarities between NF-κB and DL signaling pathways have led to the proposal that they share a common ancestry (reviewed in Refs. 3Belvin M.P. Anderson K.V. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 393-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar and 19Wasserman S.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 767-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Rel proteins have recently been shown to be involved in the immune response of Drosophila (reviewed in Ref. 4Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 309-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In particular, it has been suggested that they control the induction of genes encoding antibacterial and antifungal peptides in the fat body and in blood cells. The upstream regions of these genes contain sequence motifs similar to NF-κB binding motifs of mammalian immune responsive genes (reviewed in Ref. 20Hultmark D. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 178-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Experiments with transgenic flies have shown that these motifs are mandatory for immune inducibility of the insect antibacterial peptide genes (21Engström Y. Kadalayil L. Sun S.C. Samakovlis C.

Kappler C. Hoffmann J.A. C. R. Acad. Sci. Ser. III Sci. Vie. 1993; 316: 1218-1224PubMed Google Scholar), initially identified as the dorsoventral morphogen, DIF (for dorsal-related immunity factor; Ref. 24Ip Y.T. Reach M. Engström Y. Kadalayil L. Cai H. Gonzalez-Crespo S. Tatei K. Levine M. Cell. 1993; 75: 753-763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), and Relish, a NF-κB1 (p105)-like protein containing both Rel and ankyrin domains (25Dushay M.S. Asling B. Hultmark D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10343-10347Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The precise roles of these Rel proteins in the control of these immune genes has not yet been clarified in vivo (26Lemaitre B. Meister M. Govind S. Georgel P. Steward R. Reichhart J.-M. Hoffmann J.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 536-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 27Lemaitre B. Nicolas E. Michaut L. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J. Cell. 1996; 86: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3020) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown by genetic analysis that the intracellular components of the dorsoventral pathway (except for DL) and the extracellular TL ligand SPZ, collectively referred to as the TL pathway, control the expression of the antifungal peptide gene drosomycin in Drosophila adults (27Lemaitre B. Nicolas E. Michaut L. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J. Cell. 1996; 86: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3020) Google Scholar). In flies carrying loss-of-function mutations in the pll, tub, Tl, and spzgenes, the immune inducibility of the drosomycin gene is dramatically decreased. In contrast, in Tl gain-of-function mutants, in which the TL pathway is signal-independently activated, and in cact-deficient mutants, the gene encoding drosomycin is constitutively expressed. Altogether, these data demonstrated that the TL/interleukin-1 receptor pathway is indeed an ancient regulatory cascade involved in the host defense of both mammals and insects (27Lemaitre B. Nicolas E. Michaut L. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J. Cell. 1996; 86: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3020) Google Scholar). The fat body of Drosophila provides a unique experimental system to dissect in vivo the TL/interleukin-1 receptor signaling pathway in the context of the immune response. In this study, we have focused our interest on the regulation of cact, the last element of the genetically characterized cascade. We have first observed that the cact gene is up-regulated in response to immune challenge and that the expression of cact is controlled by the spz/Tl/cact gene regulatory cascade. We have also noted that two CACT isoforms are expressed in the cytoplasm of fat body cells and that they are rapidly degraded and resynthesized after immune challenge. This degradation is dependent on the TL signaling pathway. The cact 255 strain contains an FZ enhancer trap (28Mlodzik M. Hiromi Y. Methods Neurosci. 1992; 9: 397-414Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar) in the first intron of the cact gene. The cact 255 FZline exhibits an embryonic pattern of lacZ expression similar to that of the resident cact gene as detected by in situ hybridization of its transcripts (12Kidd S. Cell. 1992; 71: 623-635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This insertion causes a strong CACT phenotype (13Geisler R. Bergmann A. Hiromi Y. Nüsslein-Volhard C.

All experiments were performed at 25 °C except when otherwise stated. Bacterial challenges were performed by pricking third instar larvae or adults with a needle dipped into a concentrated culture pellet of Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus (OD of the pellet ≈ 100). Natural infection with entomopathogenic fungi was performed by shaking anesthetized flies for a few minutes in a Petri dish containing a sporulating culture of Beauveria bassiana (strain 80.2). Flies covered with spores were then placed onto fresh Drosophila medium and incubated at 29 °C. Natural infection with entomopathogenic fungi induces a strong and sustained expression of the antifungal peptide gene drosomycin, through the selective activation of the TL signaling pathway (32Lemaitre B.

The second antibody was an alkaline phosphatase-linked sheep anti-mouse-IgG (Boehringer Mannheim) diluted 1:500. Crosses were performed at 25 °C, and third instar larvae or 2–4-day-old adult flies were collected. Total RNA was extracted from dissected larval or adult fat body with the RNA Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.) method. Total RNA extraction and Northern blotting experiments were performed as in Ref.35Lemaitre B. Kromer-Metzger E. Michaut L. Nicolas E. Meister M. Georgel P. Reichhart J.-M. Hoffmann J.A. Proc. Natl.

The monoclonal anti-CACT antibody 2C2–50 was described by Whalen and Steward (34Whalen A.M. Steward R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 523-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). A monoclonal anti-β-tubulin antibody (Boehringer Mannheim) was used as a loading control. Larval or adult fat bodies from 30–40 insects were collected and frozen at −80 °C. Fat bodies were lysed in 2× Laemmli solution. 15 μg of fat body extract were loaded on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proteins were blotted to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Life Science). The blots were developed using the ECL system (Amersham) and x-ray film to detect the signal. Cycloheximide treatment was performed by injecting ∼20 μl of a mixture of cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) and bacterial suspension into the thorax of Drosophila adults using a Nanoject apparatus (DrumondTM). The results reported in this study were obtained with fat body extracted from either larvae or adults. The fat body, a functional analog of the mammalian liver, is the major site of antimicrobial peptide production in Drosophila. In larvae, it consists of a mass of large polyploid cells that can easily be dissected out. In contrast, adult fat body is a thin and loose tissue difficult to excise. Our analysis was performed with extracts of fat body cells and occasionally, when indicated, of adult abdominal carcass, which allows the extraction predominantly of fat body with minor contaminations from epidermal and muscle cells. In a previous study, we had observed that 3 h after a bacterial challenge, cact gene expression was markedly up-regulated in adults (27Lemaitre B. Nicolas E. Michaut L. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J. Cell. 1996; 86: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3020) Google Scholar). We have now extended this study by analyzing the time course of cact gene expression both in excised larval fat body and in male adult carcass tissues. The Northern blot analysis, presented in Fig. 1(A and B) shows a faint signal for cact transcripts in unchallenged fat body and adult carcass and a remarkably rapid and strong up-regulation following bacterial challenge. In both larvae and adults, peak values were observed after 2 or 3 h, after which the signals of cact transcripts leveled off. These kinetics of induction/up-regulation, frequently referred to as acute phase kinetics, were similar to those of the cecropin A gene in these experiments. In contrast, the drosomycin and the diptericin genes reached their highest level of expression only 6–16 h postchallenge (Fig. 1,A and B). Two cact transcripts are observed during development; they are of approximately 2.2 kb (referred to as maternal/zygotic) and 2.6 kb (zygotic) and encode proteins of 71 and 69 kDa, respectively, which differ in their C-terminal part flanking the PEST sequence (12Kidd S. Cell. 1992; 71: 623-635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 13Geisler R. Bergmann A. Hiromi Y. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Cell. 1992; 71: 613-621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The above Northern blot analyses were performed with total RNA, a method that does not accurately discriminate between these two transcripts. We have therefore repeated the analysis with Northern blots prepared with poly(A) RNA from total adults; as shown in Fig. 1 C, both transcripts were detectable in unchallenged tissues and were clearly up-regulated after bacterial challenge, the 2.2-kb transcript being predominant. We have further investigated cact expression by using an enhancer trap line, cact 255 FZ, in which an FZ element is inserted in the first intron of the cact gene (12Kidd S. Cell. 1992; 71: 623-635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 13Geisler R. Bergmann A. Hiromi Y. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Cell. 1992; 71: 613-621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The FZ element is a P transposon containing the minimum fushi tarazu(ftz) promoter fused to lacZ and behaves like a PZ enhancer trap except that β-galactosidase expression is predominantly cytoplasmic (28Mlodzik M. Hiromi Y. Methods Neurosci. 1992; 9: 397-414Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The cact 255 FZ insertion causes a strong cact phenotype, and homozygous cact 255 mutants die before the end of the third larval instar (29Roth S. Hiromi Y. Godt D. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Development. 1991; 112: 371-388PubMed Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 2 (A and B), unchallenged cact 255 larvae do not express β-galactosidase, in contrast to 6-h challenged larvae, which exhibit mosaic blue activity in their fat body. Expression of cact 255 FZ is also inducible in the fat body of heterozygous adults (data not shown). In addition to its immune induced expression in the fat body, this enhancer trap insertion is also constitutively expressed in the salivary glands of third instar larvae and in the uterus of female adults but not in their ovaries, despite the fact that they express the resident cact gene (data not shown; see Fig. 2 B for salivary gland). This indicates that the pattern of expression of the cact 255 FZ insertion only partially reflects the expression of the cact gene. Importantly, however, in the context of the present study,cact 255 FZ exhibits an immune inducibility similar to that of the resident cact gene. The genomic regions encompassing the cact gene have recently been sequenced through the Drosophila genome project. 2Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project, unpublished results. . We have analyzed the sequences flanking the cact 255 FZinsertion, assuming that this inducible transgene is inserted in the vicinity of immune responsive enhancers. We have observed the presence of several sequence motifs homologous to insect and/or mammalian binding sites for Rel proteins (Rel-binding sites; reviewed in Ref.20Hultmark D. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 178-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar); three sites are present upstream of the FZ insertion site, two of which are located in intron 1 and are overlapping. Intron 2 contains four sites, and intron 3 contains one site (Fig. 3). These sites all contain the canonical three G residues in the 5′ sequence, but differ in their 3′ sequence; taken individually, some of these motifs are similar to counterparts in the various promoters of immune inducible genes encoding antimicrobial peptides (see the legend of Fig. 3).Figure 3Putative binding sites for Rel proteins in the 5′ region of the cact gene. The schematic representation of the 5′ region of the cact gene is derived from Geisler et al. (13Geisler R. Bergmann A. Hiromi Y. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Cell. 1992; 71: 613-621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and Kidd (12Kidd S. Cell. 1992; 71: 623-635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The 1.2-kb transcript is unrelated to cact and may define the 5′ limit of the cact locus (13Geisler R. Bergmann A. Hiromi Y. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Cell. 1992; 71: 613-621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The complete sequence of the cact genomic region was obtained from the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (accession number 49408).2 Coding regions are indicated as empty boxes. Sequences related to mammalian NF-κB response elements are indicated (•). The sequences of these motifs, given with their positions relative to the start site are as follows: motif 1,−652GGGATTTTTT−661; motif 2,+156GGGTTTAAC+165; motif 3,+167GGGTTTAAAC+158; motif 4,+1400GGGAAATTCC+1409; motif 5,+1410GGGAATTTCC+1401; motif 6,+1881GGGGTTTTCC+1890; motif 7,+1973GGGTTTTTAC+1982; motif 8,+2431GGGAATCTTT+2422.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have also used this cact 255 FZline as a reporter of cact gene expression during natural infections by the entomopathogenic fungus B. bassiana. For this, we have covered cact 255 FZadults with B. bassiana spores and measured lacZexpression over a 6-day period. Fig. 4shows that under these conditions, which mimic a natural infection, the cact 255 FZ reporter gene was strongly and persistently induced. As previously reported for the drosomycin gene (32Lemaitre B. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14614-14619Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar), we also observed that Gram-positive bacteria were more potent inducers of the cact 255 FZ reporter gene than Gram-negative bacteria (data not shown). We have further analyzed the expression of the cact gene in Drosophilacarrying mutations that affect the dorsoventral signaling pathway. We have first examined the expression of the cact 255 FZ reporter gene in dominant gain-of-function Tl (Tl D) and cact-deficient mutant larvae in which the TL pathway is signal-independently activated and the drosomycin gene is constitutively turned on (27Lemaitre B. Nicolas E. Michaut L. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J. Cell. 1996; 86: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3020) Google Scholar). A first striking result, shown in Fig. 2, C and D, was that in both mutant contexts, the reporter gene was expressed in the absence of immune challenge in larvae. The level of β-galactosidase activity was higher than that induced by bacterial challenge in wild-type insects. Similar results were obtained in adult fat body (data not shown). We have corroborated these results by Northern blot experiments. For this, total RNA was extracted from larval fat body and adult carcass of wild-type insects and of Tl D and cact-deficient Drosophila. The RNA was probed on Northern blots with cact and rp49 cDNAs. The cact mutation that we selected for these experiments was cact A2, the strongest viable cact-deficient mutation (29Roth S. Hiromi Y. Godt D. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Development. 1991; 112: 371-388PubMed Google Scholar). This mutation, which had been induced by ethyl methyl sulfonate treatment, does not alter the expression of the cact gene but rather seems to affect the biosynthesis of the CACT protein and leads to a weakly functional CACT (29Roth S. Hiromi Y. Godt D. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Development. 1991; 112: 371-388PubMed Google Scholar, 34Whalen A.M. Steward R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 523-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The data presented in Fig. 5confirm the results obtained with the cact 255 FZ reporter gene approach; the level of cact transcripts was indeed significantly higher in Tl D and cact-deficient adults than in unchallenged controls. Altogether, our results demonstrate that the activation of the TL pathway is sufficient to trigger the expression of the cact gene. The constitutive expression of cact observed in cact-deficient mutants demonstrates that the cact gene is autoregulated. We have next studied the inducibility of the cact gene in strains carrying strong loss-of-function mutations that are known to block the dorsoventral signaling pathway. In spz −, Tl −,tub −, and pll − mutant adults, the level of CACT inducibility after bacterial challenge was significantly lower than in wild-type insects (Fig. 5). However, mutants in the easter gene, which lies upstream in the dorsoventral patterning cascade, exhibited a wild-type response to bacterial challenge (Fig. 5). Interestingly, in dl − mutant adults, cact gene induction was not affected. We have repeated this analysis with dorsoventral mutant larvae and obtained results that paralleled those in adults, except that the inducibility of the cact gene was less dramatically reduced in larvae than in adults carrying strong loss-of-function alleles of spz, Tl,tub, and pll (data not shown). imd is a recessive mutation that alters the immune induction of all the genes encoding antibacterial peptides but not that of the antifungal peptide gene drosomycin (35Lemaitre B. Kromer-Metzger E. Michaut L. Nicolas E. Meister M. Georgel P. Reichhart J.-M. Hoffmann J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9465-9469Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). We observed that the cact gene remains fully inducible by bacterial challenge in both imd mutant larvae (data not shown) and adults (Fig. 5). Altogether, these results indicate that the intracellular part of the dorsoventral pathway (with the exception of DL) plus the extracellular component SPZ, control the expression of the cact gene in the fat body of Drosophila larvae and adults. With appropriate antibodies, we examined the subcellular localization of the CACT protein in excised fat body. We restricted our analysis to the large polyploid cells of larval fat body from control and bacteria-challenged Drosophila. Staining with an anti-CACT monoclonal antibody revealed only a faint cytoplasmic reaction in control larval fat body. The staining was however more conspicuous with fat body from challenged insects (data not shown). These data indicating that CACT proteins have similar subcellular localizations in the fat body and in embryos are consistent with their putative function as a cytoplasmic inhibitor. Earlier Western blot analyses of CACT protein expression had revealed three polypeptides, which are differentially expressed during development (Refs. 12Kidd S. Cell. 1992; 71: 623-635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar and 34Whalen A.M. Steward R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 523-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar; see also Fig. 6). In male extracts, two major proteins of 69 and 71 kDa cross-react with an anti-CACT monoclonal antibody (Refs. 12Kidd S. Cell. 1992; 71: 623-635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar and 34Whalen A.M. Steward R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 523-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar; Fig. 6). These proteins are also detected in female ovaries, where a third form of 72 kDa is present. The latter species is the major form of CACT in late stage oocytes and early embryos. Phosphatase treatment revealed that the 72-kDa protein is a phosphorylated form of the 71-kDa protein and that both are encoded by the 2.2-kb maternal/zygotic mRNA (12Kidd S.

More recently, we evidence a growing interest in PTH and PTH-derived agonists as anabolic agents in bone remodeling and their promise as new drugs for the treatment of osteoporosis. It has been established that the 34 residues at the N terminus of the 84-amino acid protein, hPTH-(1–34), are sufficient for high affinity binding to the PTH receptor (a G-protein-coupled receptor) and retain PTH-like bone-related activities (2Potts Jr., J.T.

On the basis of theoretical methods for secondary structure prediction, both the N and C termini of PTH-(1–34) are expected to be helical. Furthermore, the amphipathic character of the two putative helices has suggested helix-helix interactions resulting in a “U-shaped” tertiary structure with a hydrophobic core and outwardly facing hydrophilic residues (5Cohen F.E. Strewler G.J. Bradley M.S. Carlquist M. Nilsson M. Ericsson M. Ciardelli T.L. Nissenson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1997-2004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, only a low α-helical content could be identified for hPTH-(1–34) in aqueous solution ([θ] r 222 = −6800; average of literature values as reported by Willis (see Ref. 6Willis K.J. Int. J.

Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 473-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)). Only upon addition of the structure inducing solvent trifluoroethanol (TFE), a helix content consistent with the two predicted helical segments was observed. Unfortunately, the majority of the NMR-derived structures of hPTH-(1–34) in TFE (8Klaus W. Dieckmann T. Wray V. Schomburg D. Wingender E. Mayer H.

This has been attributed to the low dielectric constant (ε = 26.7) of TFE, which could weaken hydrophobic interactions and therefore destabilize the alleged tertiary structure (11Marx U.C.

Recently, new evidence emerging from the NMR study of hPTH-(1–37) in aqueous solution in the presence of salts was interpreted in favor of the U-shape hypothesis (11Marx U.C. Austermann S. Bayer P. Adermann K. Ejchart A. Sticht H. Walter S. Schmid F.X. Jaenicke R. Forssmann W.G. Rösch P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15194-15202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, the reported long range NOEs are limited only to the turn portion of the U-shape and do not include residues further toward the termini. Therefore, the experimental data do not define the relative topological arrangement of the helices; any helix-loop-helix conformation is consistent with the data. In addition, the conformational consequences of the experimental conditions employed, namely the pH and the high salt concentration, were not investigated. Highly questionable U-shape conformations have been reported for PTHrP analogs in the presence of TFE (12Barden J.A. Kemp B.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 379-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 13Barden J.A. Kemp B.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1208: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 14Barden J.A.

Here, we report high resolution structures of hPTH-(1–34) in aqueous solution, investigating the effect of pH and salt concentration on secondary and tertiary structure (hPTH-(1–34) is equipotent to hPTH-(1–37) and displays identical affinity to the PTH/PTHrP receptor). In addition, we examined the peptide in the presence of dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles. Micellar systems have often been used as an NMR-compatible model system for mimicking biological membranes (15Bösch C. Brown L.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

A membrane-ligand interaction and membrane-induced conformation have been proposed as an operational pathway for the interaction between peptide hormones and their receptors (25Moroder L. Romano R.

Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 785-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The structural study utilizes experimental data both from circular dichroism (CD) and NMR spectroscopies, providing, respectively, an estimate of the helix content and the location of the α-helix, possibly including long range interactions determining a tertiary fold. The NMR study was coupled with a protocol of structure calculation that could assure adequate sampling of conformational space (metric matrix distance geometry, DG), followed by further refinement with extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations incorporating explicit solvent. The high resolution conformational preferences of hPTH-(1–34) in aqueous and saline solutions and in the presence of a membrane mimetic is required to advance the structure-activity relationship of the hormone and provide a reliable template for rational design of non-peptidic PTH-mimetic agonists. The synthesis and purification of the peptide followed published procedures (29Bisello A. Nakamoto C. Rosenblatt M. Chorev M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3293-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Spectra were recorded using an Aviv CD spectrometer (model 62 DS), interfaced with a personal computer. Spectra were acquired on 30 μm solutions of the peptide in H2O, at different pH, buffer composition, and temperature and in the presence of DPC micelles. Each spectrum is the average of four scans from 255 to 195 nm. The ellipticity is reported as mean residue molar ellipticity ([θ] r), in degrees cm2 dmol−1. Estimates of the helical fraction of the peptide were calculated using the value of [θ]obs at 222 nm and the formula for percent helix = {([θ]obs222 − [θ]coil222)} − {([θ]helix222 − [θ]coil222)} × 100 (7Taylor J.W. Kaiser E.T. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 473-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Estimations of the error associated with this formula has been discussed extensively in the literature (30Greenfield N. Fasman G. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3310) Google Scholar, 31Lee M.S. Cao B. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Data manipulation and graphic representation were achieved with the program Kaleidograph. hPTH-(1–34) was examined in benign water solution (1.4 mm, 9:1 H2O/2H2O, pH = 4.3, not corrected for deuterium), in the presence of buffer and salts (2 mm, 270 mm NaCl, 50 mm phosphate buffer, in 9:1 H2O/2H2O, pH = 6.0) and in the presence of micelles (1.4 mm, 9:1 H2O/2H2O, pH = 4.3, 200 mm DPC-d 38 from CIL). All the experiments were recorded on a Varian Unity500 spectrometer (500 MHz) at temperatures varying between 285 and 318 K. Data processing utilized Varian (VNMR) or Felix (Biosym Technologies Inc., San Diego) software. Chemical shifts were referenced to the signal of tetramethyl silane (0.0 ppm). The complete amino acid spin systems were identified from double quantum filtered correlation spectroscopy (32Rance M. Sørensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 458-479Crossref Scopus (2596) Google Scholar) and TOCSY (33Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 53: 521-528Crossref Scopus (3104) Google Scholar, 34Bax A.

Lee J. Warren C.D. Jeanloz R.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 811-813Crossref Scopus (1964) Google Scholar) experiments with mixing times of 125–350 ms were employed for the sequential assignment. All the experiments were recorded in the phase-sensitive mode according to the method detailed by States et al. (38States D.J. Haberkorn R.A. Ruben D.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 286-292Google Scholar). The TOCSY utilized a MLEV-17 sequence to realize mixing times of 40–70 ms with a spin-lock field of 10,000 Hz. In the ROESY experiment, a spin-lock field of 2500 Hz was realized by a continuous wave pulse. Suppression of the solvent signal was achieved by continuous wave presaturation at low power level during the relaxation delay (1.5–2 s), and for NOESY experiments also during the mixing time. The typical spectral width was 6500 Hz in both dimensions, with 4096 data points in t 2 and 512–640 data points in t 1 and with 32–128 scans at each increment. Forward linear prediction to 1024 points was applied to the incremented dimension; both dimensions were multiplied by Gaussian or shifted squared sine bell apodization functions, prior to Fourier transformation. Back-calculation of NOESY spectra utilized the matrix doubling method within the Felix program. The cutoff distance was set at 8 Å, the correlation time to 1 ns, and the smallest back-calculated intensity to be saved was set to 0.001, representing a 0.1% NOE enhancement. NOESY spectra acquired at 285 K with a mixing time of 200 ms were utilized to measure cross-peak volumes for the two water samples, while a mixing time of 150 ms at 308 K was employed for the DPC sample. The volumes were converted to distances using the two-spin approximation and the cross-peaks between couples of aromatic protons of Trp23 and between the two β protons of Trp23 (Ser1 for the DPC sample) as a reference (respectively: Trp23 4H/5H = 2.4 Å; Trp23 7H/6H = 2.4 Å; β1/β2 = 1.78 Å). Addition and subtraction of 10% to the calculated distances yielded upper and lower bounds utilized in the distance geometry calculations. A home-written program, based on the random metrization algorithm of Havel (39Havel T.F. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1991; 56: 43-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), was utilized to calculate an ensemble of structures fulfilling holonomic (constitutional) and experimental (proton-proton distances) restraints. The 100 starting structures were obtained by random sampling of the distances between the upper and lower bounds. They were first embedded in four dimensions and optimized versus the initial distance restraints (conjugate gradients) (40Kaptein R. Boelens R. Scheek R.M. van Gunsteren W.F. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5389-5395Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). This step was followed by distance-driven dynamics (DDD) (41Mierke D.F. Geyer A. Kessler H. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1994; 44: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 42Jahnke W. Mierke D.F. Beress L. Kessler H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 445-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), carried out at 500 K for 100 ps, and by slow cooling to 1 K. A new metrization reduced the resulting structures to three dimensions for the next optimization and DDD. The DDD procedure applies a simple square well potential on holonomic and experimental distances and an additional penalty term to maintain chirality and planarity, to generate the violation “energy” and calculate the forces. The ensemble calculations consist of the DDD method in which the penalty expression for the experimental restraints (distances) and the subsequent force applied are generated from an ensemble average, following published procedures (43Mierke D.F. Scheek R.M. Kessler H. Biopolymers. 1994; 34: 559-563Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 44Mierke D.F. Kurz M. Kessler H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 1042-1049Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The ensemble calculations utilized 10,000 steps of 20 fs at 500 K, followed by a slow reduction of the temperature to 1 K in 2500 steps. MD simulations were performed with GROMACS (45van der Spoel D. van Buuren A.R. Apol E. Meulenhoff P.J. Tieleman D.p. Sijbers A.L.T.M. van Drunen R. Berendsen H.J.C. Gromacs User Manual. University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands1996Google Scholar), and interactive modeling was performed using Insight II (Biosym Technologies Inc., San Diego). Only the structures resulting from the study in water and in the presence of salts were examined. The starting structures for the simulations were chosen from the low energy structures obtained from DG as described under “Results.” All atoms and the solvent were simulated explicitly. The peptide structure was placed in a rectangular box of H2O (46Berendsen H.J.C. Postma J.P.M. van Gunsteren W.F. Hermans J. Intermolecular Forces. D. Reidel Publishing Company, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1981: 331-342Google Scholar, 47Miyamoto S. Kollman P.A. J. Comput. Chem. 1992; 13: 952-962Crossref Scopus (5125) Google Scholar), allowing at least 10 Å between the walls and the peptide and using three-dimensional periodic boundary condition. The charges of ionizable groups correspond to the pH of the NMR solution; no counter ions were included. A time step of 2.0 fs was employed. Neighbor lists for calculation of nonbonded interactions were updated every 20 steps within a radius of 10 Å. No switching function was utilized. The system was energy-minimized for 100 steps using steepest descent. Following this, 10 ps of MD at 300 K (48Berendsen H.J.C. Postma J.P.M. DiNola A. Haak J.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1984; 81: 3684-3690Crossref Scopus (23138) Google Scholar) with the peptide restrained to its original position with a force constant of 1000 kJ mol−1 nm−1 were carried out. Experimental distance restraints were then introduced with a force constant of 6000 kJ mol−1 nm−1 for 20 ps, and subsequently raised to 10,000 kJ mol−1 nm−1 for the rest of the simulation (200–400 ps). Structures were sampled every 0.5 ps. One iteration took approximately 2.7 s on one processor of a SGI Challenger (R8000, 150 MHz). The resulting trajectories were examined with analysis programs in the GROMACS package and home-written Fortran programs. The helix content of hPTH-(1–34) based on CD spectra (given in Fig. 1) increases in the presence of phosphate buffer at pH ≥ 6 (from 24% in benign water to 28% in buffer) and reaches a maximum of 54% in the presence of DPC micelles. Spectra acquired in the presence of phosphate or acetate buffer but at acidic pH are almost identical to the spectrum in benign H2O (data not shown). The solution containing phosphate buffer at pH = 6 displays a small temperature dependence. A small decrease of helix content (indicated by the ellipticity at 222 nm) occurs upon changing the temperature from 5 to 45 °C. The NMR study confirmed the presence of helical structure and localized the secondary structure elements to segments in the N- and C-terminal part of the peptide sequence. The analysis of the chemical shift values of the Hα protons, compared with values for amino acids in a random-coil peptide (49Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar), chemical shift index (CSI), provides a first estimate of secondary structure (50Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2009) Google Scholar, 51Pastore A. Saudek V. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 90: 165-176Google Scholar). The results, shown in Fig. 2 A, indicate a helical region (CSI ≤ −0.1) extending from residue 17 to 30, separated by a zero point from a second “helical” domain with a small deviation from random coil values, centered at Leu7. The NOESY spectra are characteristic of a mostly disordered structure. A classical α-helix structure typically generates Hα(i)-HN(i+3), Hα(i)-HN(i+4), Hα(i)-Hβ(i+3), HN(i)-HN(i+2) and long stretches of continuous HN(i)-HN(i+1) NOEs. A certain degree of order is indicated by a series of HN(i)-HN(i+1) NOEs visible throughout all the sequence (4–5, 5–6, 8–9, 10–11, 12–13, 13–14, 14–15, 16–17, 17–18, 20–21, 21–22, 23–24, 24–25, 28–29, 29–30, 30–31, 31–32, and 33–34), and many of the missing NOEs are due to resonance overlapping. Typical α-helix NOEs of type Hα(i)-HN(i+3) but of weak intensity are present for i = 6,7 consistent with one loop of helix in the N terminus and for i = 24,26, which together with a Trp23HN-Arg25HN NOE identify a probable C-terminal helix. A total of 95 structures were obtained from the DG calculations, all with comparable low penalty functions. Low order parameters for the φ and ψ dihedral angles indicating disorder are observed, even for the 6–10 and 21–29 regions, consistent with the scarcity of NOEs and the low intensity of the cross-peaks indicative of α-helix (Fig. 3). The pairwise r.m.s. deviation values calculated as an average of the 95 structures are 1.9 Å for residues 6–10, 2.6 Å for residues 20–27, and 8.7 Å (using only the backbone atoms) for the entire peptide, indicating the predominance of flexible over ordered structures in benign aqueous solution. The structural features consist of an irregular helix between residues 21 and 26 and a loop centered on residues 7–8. Extensive MD simulations (200 ps with explicit solvent) confirm that the irregular α-helical structure in the identified regions is energetically stable and consistent with the experimental NOEs. The average φ,ψ dihedral angles from the simulation are reported in Table I.Table IValues of the dihedral angles φ,ψ (± standard deviation) for hPTH-(1–34) in H 2 O and in H 2 O in the presence of salts (U-shaped conformation)ResiduehPTH in H2OhPTH in H2O/saltsφψφψVal2121 ± 12125 ± 13−78 ± 21−50 ± 12Ser363 ± 8135 ± 10−59 ± 9136 ± 9Glu462 ± 971 ± 1277 ± 9−19 ± 17Ile5−99 ± 13163 ± 12−89 ± 17−41 ± 7Gln6−95 ± 863 ± 14−43 ± 8128 ± 9Leu7−79 ± 14−74 ± 1470 ± 7−49 ± 9Met8−69 ± 12−28 ± 10−63 ± 7−35 ± 10His9−64 ± 8−27 ± 10−92 ± 11−8 ± 12Asn10−134 ± 1251 ± 13−82 ± 12−53 ± 6Lys11−72 ± 14−46 ± 11−64 ± 6−23 ± 7Gly12−131 ± 1556 ± 12−61 ± 9−32 ± 10Lys1361 ± 986 ± 9−98 ± 931 ± 8His1458 ± 8169 ± 18−143 ± 843 ± 11Leu15−90 ± 1795 ± 17−150 ± 942 ± 7Asn16−99 ± 21117 ± 1049 ± 722 ± 7Ser17−84 ± 939 ± 960 ± 70 ± 13Met18−59 ± 8137 ± 9−93 ± 12−42 ± 7Glu1967 ± 6−35 ± 10−65 ± 9−25 ± 8Arg20−58 ± 9−48 ± 7−68 ± 8−51 ± 6Val21−79 ± 1215 ± 25−67 ± 6−37 ± 7Glu22−108 ± 26−39 ± 9−79 ± 10−11 ± 19Trp23−82 ± 7−36 ± 6−88 ± 15−51 ± 6Leu24−67 ± 8−13 ± 10−50 ± 7−40 ± 7Arg25−106 ± 10−66 ± 12−47 ± 8−47 ± 8Lys26−74 ± 14103 ± 12−69 ± 10−44 ± 10Lys27−138 ± 16−66 ± 12−56 ± 9−59 ± 8Leu28−87 ± 15−20 ± 14−71 ± 10−30 ± 8Gln2973 ± 797 ± 8−61 ± 8−25 ± 10Asp3070 ± 8122 ± 13−113 ± 1026 ± 13Val31−105 ± 1366 ± 9−141 ± 767 ± 8His32−66 ± 12−34 ± 13−110 ± 15−60 ± 12Asn3372 ± 12110 ± 1151 ± 1173 ± 13 Open table in a new tab The CSI values for α protons in the presence of phosphate buffer and salts are similar to that observed in benign water solution (Fig. 2 B). The extent of the negative deviations in this case is significantly larger for both the C- and N-terminal helix. This qualitatively indicates a larger content/population of α-helix, as do the greater dispersion of chemical shifts and the larger number of medium range NOEs (Fig. 4). The HN(i)-HN(i+1) NOEs are present along the entire peptide sequence. An N-terminal α-helix from residue 5 to 12 is indicated by 4 Hα(i)-HN(i+3) (i= 5, 7, 9, 10) and 3 HN(i)-HN(i+2) (i = 3, 8, 12) cross-peaks. NOEs between Gly12HN and Ser14HN and Gly12Hα-Leu15HN are of weak intensity and may result from a small population in which the helix extends to residue 15. In addition, Hα(i)-Hβ, δ(i+3) (i = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7) and Hα(i)-Hβ, δ(i+4) (i = 3, 6) NOEs are observed. The C-terminal helix is defined by a larger number of NOEs, including Hα(i)-HN(i+3) (i = 18, 21, 22, 23, 24, 27, 28), HN(i)-HN(i+2) (i= 16, 19, 21), Hα(i)-HN(i+2) (i= 23, 24), and Hα(i)-HN(i+4) (i= 18, 21, 24), as well as a large number involving side chain protons. Medium range NOEs between the aromatic protons of Trp23 and Leu15 were also observed. Owing to overlapping of the β and γ protons of Leu15 with those protons of Leu24 and Leu28, residues closer in sequence to Trp23, only the cross-peaks involving the δ-CH3 protons of Leu15, characterized by a definite upfield shift, were considered non-ambiguous and utilized as experimental restraints in the following calculations. The NOE pattern observed, including the 15–23 connectivities, is similar to that reported by Marx et al. (11Marx U.C. Austermann S. Bayer P. Adermann K. Ejchart A. Sticht H. Walter S. Schmid F.X. Jaenicke R. Forssmann W.G. Rösch P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15194-15202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) for hPTH-(1–37) under analogous experimental conditions. Noteworthy is the presence of Hα(i)-HN(i+1) cross-peaks of strong intensity, typical of an extended conformation and atypical for α-helix, indicating additional conformations present under these conditions. A total of 229 informative distance restraints were used in the DG calculations, of which 149 from inter-residue NOEs. The φ,ψ values of the resulting 95 DG structures approach those of an ideal α-helix for residues 5–7 in the N terminus and 21–26 in the C terminus. The dihedral angle order parameters for φ,ψ show convergence of the structures (values > 0.8) about residues 4, 5, 6, 10, and 22–26 (Fig. 4). Pairwise r.m.s. deviation values are 0.92, 1.97, 0.76, and 6.4 Å for the heavy backbone atoms of residues 4–7, 17–27, 22–26, and 1–34, respectively. The average of the DG structures results in no NOE violation greater than 0.15 Å. However, single structures displayed violations of 0.35 Å to Hα(i)-HN(i+1) sequential NOEs in different locations of the sequence. This is a clear indication that single structures cannot fulfill the experimental restraints produced by the coexistence of structured and unstructured peptide molecules equilibrating in solution. To address conformational averaging, ensemble calculations (44Mierke D.F. Kurz M. Kessler H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 1042-1049Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar) were carried out. A “minimum” ensemble of two structures, randomly chosen from the 95 DG structures, was utilized. In the ensemble approach (44Mierke D.F. Kurz M. Kessler H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 1042-1049Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar), each structure must fulfill the constraints from the constitution (molecular connectivity), but only the ensemble average (average over the two structures) is required to fulfill the experim"

A novel Arabidopsis thalianaprotein has been identified that has sequence similarity to cap-binding proteins but is clearly a different form of the protein. The most obvious primary sequence difference is the substitution of two of the eight conserved tryptophan residues with other aromatic amino acids in the novel protein. Analogous forms of this novel protein appear to be present in other higher eukaryotes but not in yeast. Analysis of the native and recombinant forms of the novel protein by retention on m7GTP-Sepharose indicate that it is a functional cap-binding protein. Measurements of the dissociation constant for this protein indicate that it binds m7GTP 5–20-fold tighter than eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)(iso)4E. The novel protein also supports the initiation of translation of capped mRNA in vitro. Biochemical analysis and yeast two-hybrid data indicate that it interacts with eIF(iso)4G to form a complex. Based on these observations, this protein appears to be able to function as a cap-binding protein and is given the designation of novel cap-binding protein (nCBP).

The novel protein also supports the initiation of translation of capped mRNA in vitro. Biochemical analysis and yeast two-hybrid data indicate that it interacts with eIF(iso)4G to form a complex. Based on these observations, this protein appears to be able to function as a cap-binding protein and is given the designation of novel cap-binding protein (nCBP).

The binding of eIF4E is thought to be the first step in the assembly of several initiation factors on the mRNA prior to the binding of the 40 S ribosome (1Pain V.M. Eur. J.

One of the structural features of all eIF4E proteins is the presence of eight tryptophan residues in the same relative positions. Recently, the cocrystal structures of the mouse eIF4E (4Marcotrigiano J. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Burley S.K. Cell. 1997; 89: 951-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) and yeast eIF4E (5Matsuo H. Li H.J. McGuire A.M. Fletcher C.M. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Wagner G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) with m7GDP were solved. Tryptophan residues 3, 5, and 8 were found to be involved in binding the m7G functional group (4Marcotrigiano J. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Burley S.K.

Biol. 1997; 4: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). eIF4E is usually associated with a larger subunit (eIF4G) in a complex named eIF4F (1Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar,6Morley S.J. Cusack S. Pain V.M. RNA. 1997; 3: 1085-1104PubMed Google Scholar). eIF4A may also be present in the eIF4E·eIF4G complex depending upon the method of purification (7Etchison D. Milburn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 76: 15-25Google Scholar, 8Webster C. Gaut R.L. Browning K.S. Ravel J.M. Roberts J.K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23341-23346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Higher plants possess a unique second form of eIF4F designated eIF(iso)4F (9Browning K.S. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). eIF(iso)4F contains distinct forms of the cap-binding protein (eIF(iso)4E) and the larger subunit (eIF(iso)4G) (10Browning K.S. Webster C. Roberts J.K.M. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10096-10100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two isoenzyme forms of plant eIF4F have the same activities in vitro (9Browning K.S. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar); however, the eIF(iso)4E prefers hypermethylated caps and mRNAs with less secondary structure (11Carberry S.E. Darzynkiewicz E. Goss D.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1624-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 12Carberry S.E. Goss D.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4542-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Recently, a second form of mammalian eIF4G was reported (13Gradi A. Imataka H. Svitkin Y.V. Rom E. Raught B. Morino S. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). However, this form of eIF4G was not reported to have a distinct form of eIF4E associated with it and does not appear to be the functional equivalent of eIF(iso)4G. The mammalian eIF4E is known to be phosphorylated at Ser-209, and the phosphorylation state appears to correlate with activity of the protein (reviewed in Refs. 14Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1996: 245-270Google Scholar and 15Rhoads R.E. Joshi-Barve S. Rinker-Schaeffer C. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. 1993; 46: 183-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Certain stimuli, including insulin and several growth factors, induce phosphorylation of eIF4E (14Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1996: 245-270Google Scholar). Overexpression of the mammalian eIF4E results in cell transformation, suggesting that eIF4E levels play a critical role in normal growth and/or development (16De Benedetti A. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8212-8216Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 17Lazaris-Karatzas A. Montine K.S. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1990; 345: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). The recent discovery of proteins that specifically bind mammalian eIF4E and sequester it from interacting with eIF4G have linked the insulin signaling pathway directly to translation (reviewed in Refs. 14Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1996: 245-270Google Scholar and 18Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 345-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). These eIF4E binding proteins (4E-BP) are a major target for phosphorylation following insulin or growth factor treatment, and the phosphorylated form of 4E-BP no longer binds eIF4E (18Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 345-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Thus the availability and phosphorylation state of eIF4E are crucial regulatory mechanisms for translational control in mammals. It is not known if similar types of regulation by phosphorylation or sequestration occur in plants. In this report, we have identified a novel cap-binding protein (nCBP) from Arabidopsis thaliana that is distinct in both amino acid sequence and m7GTP binding properties from eIF4E or eIF(iso)4E and appears to be present only in higher eukaryotes. The cDNA (19Newman T. De Bruijn F.J. Green P. Keegstra K. Kende H. McIntosh L. Ohlrogge J. Raikhel N. Somerville S. Thomashow M. Retzel E. Somerville C. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 1241-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) encoding the expressed sequence tag (EST) for the nCBP (77G6T7) was obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC, Ohio State University). DNA sequencing of the cDNA (both strands) was performed at the DNA sequencing facility of the Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology (University of Texas at Austin). Expression vector pET15b and Escherichia coli DE3(HMS174) were obtained from Novagen (Madison, WI). Restriction enzymes and DNA modifying enzymes were obtained from Life Technologies Inc. IPTG and X-gal were from Ambion (Austin, TX) or Research Products International (Mt. Prospect, IL). The A. thaliana suspension culture was generously provided by A. N. S. Reddy (Colorado State University). Preparation of the Arabidopsis extracts and chromatography on m7GTP-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) will be described elsewhere but were similar to the preparation and fractionation of wheat germ extracts (20Lax S.R. Lauer S.J. Browning K.S. Ravel J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 118: 109-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Wheat eIF(iso)4E and eIF(iso)4G were prepared as described previously (21Van Heerden A. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17454-17457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein determinations were by the method of Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE (12.5 or 20% acrylamide) and Western blots were carried out as described previously (23Browning K.S. Humphreys J. Hobbs W. Smith G.B. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17967-17973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The silver stain kit was from Novex (San Diego, CA). Antibodies to recombinant nCBP were raised in rabbits at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Veterinary Services (Bastrop, TX). The Matchmaker Two-hybrid kit was obtained fromCLONTECH. The coding region for Arabidopsis nCBP was amplified with the appropriate primers containing XhoI and BamHI sites. The amplified DNA was cloned into pET15b restricted with XhoI and BamHI and in frame with the 6-histidine tag. The plasmid construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmid containing the nCBP coding region was transformed into E. coli DE3(HMS174). Expression of the recombinant protein was carried out as described for eIF(iso)4E, except the incubation temperature of the culture after induction was at 25 °C (21Van Heerden A. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17454-17457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cell pellet from a 1.5-liter culture was resuspended in 15 ml of buffer C (20 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol) containing 0.4 m KCl. The cells were sonicated and centrifuged for 30 min at 30,000 rpm in a Ti-60 rotor, and the supernatant was applied to a Ni-NTA column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with buffer C containing 0.1 m KCl and 40 mm imidazole and then eluted with buffer C containing 0.1 mm KCl and 400 mm imidazole. The fractions containing the highest amount of protein were pooled and dialyzed against buffer B (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA) containing 0.1m KCl. nCBP prepared by Ni-NTA chromatography was used to raise rabbit antibodies. Alternatively for purification on m7GTP-Sepharose, the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA containing 0.4 m KCl. The cells were sonicated and treated as described above, and the supernatant was applied to a 2-ml m7GTP-Sepharose column (capacity ∼1.5 mg). The column was washed with 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 m KCl. The nCBP was eluted with the same buffer solution containing 400 μm m7GTP. The fractions containing the highest amount of protein were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 m KCl. The activity of nCBP was measured in a wheat germ translation system (100 μl) dependent upon the addition of eIF(iso)4G and eIF(iso)4E (21Van Heerden A. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17454-17457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The indicated amounts of either nCBP or eIF(iso)4E were added to the reaction mixture containing 20 pmol of eIF(iso)4G. The amount of [14C]leucine incorporated was determined as described previously (20Lax S.R. Lauer S.J. Browning K.S. Ravel J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 118: 109-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Capped β-globin mRNA was prepared as described (24Fletcher L. Corbin S.D. Browning K.S. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19582-19587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were carried out at 23 °C in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm MgCl2. The concentration of protein was 0.25 μm for both nCBP and eIF(iso)4F. The data were collected and analyzed as described previously (25Sha M. Wang Y. Xiang T. van Heerden A. Browning K.S. Goss D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29904-29909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Excitation was at 280 nm and emission monitored at 330 nm. Background fluorescence was subtracted. A mixture containing 130 μg of recombinant nCBP and 130 μg of recombinant wheat eIF(iso)4G was applied to a 0.5 ml column of m7GTP-Sepharose equilibrated in buffer B containing 0.1 m KCl, and the flow-through fractions (400 μl) were collected. The matrix was washed with an additional 5 ml of buffer. The retained protein was eluted with buffer B containing 0.3 m KCl and 400 μmm7GTP, and fractions (400 μl) were collected. The flow-through and eluate fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The coding regions of nCBP and Arabidopsis eIF(iso)4E were placed into the binding domain plasmid, pGBT9 (26Metz A.M. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31033-31036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), after amplification of the coding region with the appropriate primers. The constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The wheat eIF(iso)4E in pGBT9/N and wheat eIF(iso)4G in pGAD424 were prepared as described previously (26Metz A.M. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31033-31036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The β-galactosidase color assay with X-gal was performed according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Analysis of the EST data base for A. thalianacap-binding proteins, eIF4E and eIF(iso)4E, revealed a sequence that appeared to be a novel form of eIF4E. This novel cap-binding protein, termed nCBP, differed significantly in sequence from other known eIF4E or eIF(iso)4E sequences. One of the obvious differences was the substitution of two of the conserved tryptophan residues (Trp-1 and -3) with other aromatic residues (Fig. 1 A). Further inspection of the EST data base revealed many mouse and human ESTs that were more similar to the Arabidopsis nCBP than to mammalian eIF4E. The number of independent mouse and human nCBP ESTs that appear in the EST data base suggest that the mammalian nCBP mRNAs are highly expressed. This prediction was confirmed by Northern blot analysis of RNA from various mouse tissues that showed high levels of nCBP mRNA expression in all tissues. 2J. Schaunessy, University of Arkansas Medical Center, personal communication. Temeles et al. (27Temeles G.L. Ram P.T. Rothstein J.L. Schutz R.M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1994; 37: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) reported several mouse cDNA sequences for transcripts that were highly expressed in preimplantation embryonic mouse tissue, but the protein products were not all identified. One of these unidentified cDNAs (GenBank™ DataBank accession number U01137) appears to encode the mouse nCBP protein (Fig. 1 B). Sequence comparison of the nCBP from Arabidopsis and mouse shows that these two proteins are more similar to each other (note Trp-1 and -3 are altered also in mouse nCBP) than to their cognate normal cap-binding proteins (compare Fig. 1, panels A and B). Two of the non-conservative amino acid changes in the Arabidopsis nCBP are also present in the mouse nCBP, e.g. L136→E and T171→N (numbering for Arabidopsis nCBP). These two amino acids are absolutely conserved among eIF4E from plants, yeast, Drosophila, Xenopus, and mammals, suggesting that the mouse and Arabidopsis nCBP are more related to each other than to their cognate eIF4E. Three of the conserved tryptophans (Trp-3, -5, and -8 in Fig. 1 A) were recently shown to be involved in the binding of m7GDP by solving the structures of mouse eIF4E and yeast eIF4E with bound m7GDP (4Marcotrigiano J. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Burley S.K. Cell. 1997; 89: 951-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 5Matsuo H. Li H.J. McGuire A.M. Fletcher C.M. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Wagner G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies with yeast (28Altmann M. Edery I. Trachsel H. Sonenberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17229-17232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and human (29Morino S. Hazama H. Ozaki M. Teraoka Y. Shibata S. Doi M. Ueda H. Ishida T. Uesugi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) eIF4E indicated that mutation of the conserved Trp residues (with the exception of Trp 4 in yeast) either eliminated or reduced the ability of eIF4E to bind m7G affinity columns. It was, therefore, of great interest to determine if the nCBP, which is lacking Trp-1 and -3, is able to bind m7G functional groups. An E. coli extract containing the expressed recombinant nCBP was applied to a m7GTP-Sepharose column to test its ability to interact with m7G functional groups. The m7GTP-Sepharose column (2.0 ml) has an estimated capacity of 1.5 mg. We find that fewer nonspecific proteins are retained on the column when the capacity of the column is slightly exceeded. Consequently, only 70% of the soluble recombinant nCBP remaining after ultracentrifugation was retained on the column as judged by densitometry (Fig. 2, lanes 1and 2). The nCBP was eluted with m7GTP (Fig. 2,lanes 3–8) and approximately 1.2 mg of protein was recovered. It was observed that the nCBP appeared to elute less well from the m7GTP-Sepharose column than either eIF(iso)4E or eIF4E. Increasing the concentration of m7GTP from 100 μm to 400 μm appeared to enhance the elution and the recovery. This observation suggested that the nCBP may have a more avid interaction with m7G functional groups. Initial measurements using fluorescence spectroscopy indicate at least a 5–20-fold difference in the binding affinity of nCBP and eIF(iso)4E for m7GTP (Fig. 3). The high affinity of m7GTP for nCBP precludes accurate determination of the binding constant by fluorescence due to limiting signal at low protein concentrations. Nonetheless, the evident difference in binding affinities provides an explanation for the difficulty in elution of nCBP from m7GTP-Sepharose. Further analysis with other cap analogs and capped oligonucleotides will be essential to elucidate the basis for the differences in observed binding constants. To obtain an estimate of the relative amount of nCBP present in Arabidopsis, an extract was prepared from Arabidopsis suspension cultures and applied to a m7GTP-Sepharose column. Fig. 4 A shows a silver-stained gel of the m7GTP eluate (lane 1) and purified recombinant nCBP (lanes 2 and 3). The Arabidopsis eIF4E and eIF(iso)4E in the eluate were identified by Western blot analysis using mouse antiserum raised to recombinant wheat eIF(iso)4E (Fig. 4 B, lane 1) and by mass spectrometry identification of peptides (data not shown). The amount of nCBP present in the m7GTP eluate (Fig. 4 A, lane 1) appears to be at least 10-fold lower than that of either eIF4E or eIF(iso)4E, suggesting that this protein is present in very low amounts in Arabidopsis. nCBP in the Arabidopsis m7GTP eluate was identified with antiserum to recombinant nCBP (Fig. 4 B, lane 2). Antibody raised to recombinant wheat eIF(iso)4E cross-reacts with both Arabidopsis eIF4E and eIF(iso)4E (Fig. 4 B,lane 1), indicating that these proteins are closely related. However, note that there is no cross-reaction between the nCBP and other Arabidopsis cap-binding proteins with either the antiserum to nCBP or the antiserum to wheat eIF(iso)4F (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1 and 2). The lack of cross-reaction between nCBP and eIF4E or eIF(iso)4E, and the amino acid sequence data suggest that nCBP is a more distantly related form of a cap-binding protein. To further test the interaction of the nCBP with m7G functional groups, the ability of nCBP to translate a capped mRNA was determined. As shown in Fig. 5 A, the nCBP is able to substitute for wheat eIF(iso)4E, in the presence of wheat eIF(iso)4G. The nCBP is able to support initiation of translation at about 30% of the level of eIF(iso)4E. This result implies that nCBP interacts with a capped mRNA but also forms a functional complex with eIF(iso)4G. We have also obtained data that show nCBP is also able to interact with eIF4G (data not shown). It is not clear at this time whether the lower protein synthesis activity is an innate characteristic of nCBP itself or is due to some other unknown reason (e.g. not having the correct binding partner). The inhibition of translation initiation by m7GTP in the presence of eIF(iso)4E or nCBP was also determined. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the nCBP appears to be much less sensitive to the presence of m7GTP in the translation assay than eIF(iso)4E. At least 5–6-fold more m7GTP was required to obtain 50% inhibition. The order of addition of the m7GTP did not appear to have any affect on the level of inhibition. 3K. A. Ruud, S. R. Lax, and K. S. Browning, unpublished data. This result implies that the interaction of capped β-globin mRNA is much stronger with the nCBP than with eIF(iso)4E and therefore requires higher amounts of m7GTP to dissociate the complex. Additional fluorescence binding experiments with capped RNAs will be necessary to determine the dissociation constants relative to that of m7GTP. The ability of nCBP to support polypeptide synthesis in the presence of eIF(iso)4G implies the ability to form a complex. If the two proteins form a stable complex, the complex will be retained on m7GTP-Sepharose. We have shown previously (21Van Heerden A. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17454-17457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that eIF(iso)4G is not retained on m7GTP-Sepharose except in the presence of eIF(iso)4E. Recombinant wheat eIF(iso)4G and recombinant nCBP were incubated together and applied to a m7GTP-Sepharose column. Elution of the column with m7GTP shows that both the nCBP and eIF(iso)4G were bound (Fig. 6). These results confirm that the recombinant nCBP interacts with eIF(iso)4G to form a functional complex. Further evidence of the interaction of the nCBP with eIF(iso)4G was obtained in the yeast two-hybrid system. We have previously shown that wheat eIF(iso)4G and eIF(iso)4E interact strongly in the yeast two-hybrid system (26Metz A.M. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31033-31036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The nCBP and Arabidopsis eIF(iso)4E were placed into a binding domain vector (pGBT9/N) and co-transformed into yeast with wheat eIF(iso)4G in an activation domain vector (pGAD424). Specific interaction with the nCBP and wheat eIF(iso)4G was observed (TableI) as well as interaction of the control wheat or Arabidopsis eIF(iso)4E with wheat eIF(iso)4G. No interaction of nCBP with eIF4A or eIF4B was observed in this system (data not shown). These results further confirm the potential for nCBP to specifically interact with eIF(iso)4G or a similar protein.Table ISummary of yeast two-hybrid protein interaction assayActivation domain, pGADBinding domain, pGBTInteraction1-aScored by the intensity of blue color formation.Wheat eIF(iso)4GpGBT (no insert)−Wheat eIF(iso)4GArabidopsis nCBP++++Wheat eIF(iso)4GArabidopsis eIF(iso)4E++++Wheat eIF(iso)4GWheat eIF(iso)4E++++pGAD (no insert)Arabidopsis nCBP−pGAD (no insert)Arabidopsis eIF(iso)4E−pGAD (no insert)Wheat eIF(iso)4E−1-a Scored by the intensity of blue color formation. Open table in a new tab We have identified a new and novel protein that functions as a cap-binding protein and can interact with eIF(iso)4G to form a complex that supports the protein synthesis initiation of a capped mRNA. This protein appears to be ubiquitous in higher eukaryotes. ESTs for the nCBP are present for maize, Brassica napus, mouse, and human; also, a Caenorhabditis elegans predicted gene product appears to be very similar to the nCBP. Interestingly, there does not appear to be a homolog of this protein in yeast. Careful inspection of the yeast genome did not reveal a hidden gene that is similar to the nCBP. Therefore nCBP may be necessary for a function specific to multicellular organisms (i.e. differentiation). The mouse nCBP cDNA was among a group of cDNAs found in a screen for mRNAs that were highly expressed in preimplantation embryos (27Temeles G.L. Ram P.T. Rothstein J.L. Schutz R.M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1994; 37: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), a tissue undergoing rapid differentiation. The precise biological role of the nCBP is not obvious. The higher binding affinity of nCBP for m7GTP would imply a discriminatory role for the nCBP protein during initiation of translation. However, the lower activity of nCBP in translation suggests that a possible function may be to sequester mRNAs and either slow down or prevent their translation. We have been unable to demonstrate any competition in vitro of the nCBP with eIF4E or eIF(iso)4E (data not shown). However, we have preliminary evidence that the translation of some mRNAs is not supported by the nCBP (data not shown), suggesting that discrimination and/or sequestering may be the functional role of nCBP. We are currently determining the expression levels of nCBP mRNA and protein in various Arabidopsis tissues as well as identifying additional proteins that interact with nCBP. This additional data may provide more information about the function of this novel protein in the initiation of translation or regulation of gene expression in higher eukaryotes.

https://openalex.org/W2037679498,"Disulfide bonds are important for the structure and stability of many proteins. In prokaryotes their formation is catalyzed by the Dsb proteins. The DsbA protein acts as a direct donor of disulfides to newly synthesized periplasmic proteins. Genetic evidence suggests that a second protein called DsbB acts to specifically reoxidize DsbA. Here we demonstrate the direct reoxidation of DsbA by DsbB. We have developed a fluorescence assay that allows us to directly follow the reoxidation of DsbA. We show that membranes containing catalytic amounts of DsbB can rapidly reoxidize DsbA to completion. The reaction strongly depends on the presence of oxygen, implying that oxygen serves as the final electron acceptor for this disulfide bond formation reaction. Membranes from a dsbBnull mutant display no DsbA reoxidation activity. The ability of DsbB to reoxidize DsbA fits Michaelis-Menten behavior with DsbA acting as a high affinity substrate for DsbB with a K m = 10 μm. The in vitro reconstitution described here is the first biochemical analysis of DsbB and allows us to study the major pathway of disulfide bond formation in Escherichia coli. Disulfide bonds are important for the structure and stability of many proteins. In prokaryotes their formation is catalyzed by the Dsb proteins. The DsbA protein acts as a direct donor of disulfides to newly synthesized periplasmic proteins. Genetic evidence suggests that a second protein called DsbB acts to specifically reoxidize DsbA. Here we demonstrate the direct reoxidation of DsbA by DsbB. We have developed a fluorescence assay that allows us to directly follow the reoxidation of DsbA.

Proteins start life as linear amino acid chains and rapidly fold into compact active structures. Rapid folding is a prerequisite for the survival of a protein in the cell. It is not surprising then that critical steps in the folding process are assisted in the cell. One of the rate-limiting steps in protein folding is the formation of native disulfide bonds. In the cell, they form much more rapidly than in the test tube, implying that a catalyst is present in vivo(1Freedman R.B. Creighton T.E. Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992: 455-539Google Scholar, 2Freedman R.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 3Bardwell J.C.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We and others have shown that there is a 21-kDa enzyme called DsbA that is essential for disulfide bond formation in vivo (4Bardwell J.C.A. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 5Akiyama Y. Kamitani S. Kusukawa N. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22440-22445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DsbA is a protein-folding catalyst that acts to form disulfides in newly synthesized periplasmic proteins. DsbA acts as the direct donor of disulfides to secreted proteins. The active site of DsbA consists of a pair of cysteines present in a CXXC motif that can oxidize to form a very reactive disulfide (6Zapun A. Bardwell J.C.A. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5083-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This disulfide is rapidly transferred to proteins that are in the process of folding (7Zapun A. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5202-5211Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 8Frech C. Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Schmid F.X. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The ease at which DsbA can be purified and manipulated biochemically and the availability of a 1.7-Å resolution crystal structure for DsbA have led to an abundance of information concerning the mechanism of DsbA action (9Martin J.L. Bardwell J.C.A. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1993; 365: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 10Guddat L.W. Bardwell J.C.A. Zander T. Martin J.L.

Cell. 1995; 83: 947-955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). One of the features that is thought to contribute to the extreme oxidizing power of DsbA is the very low p K a of its Cys-30 residue, which makes it a superb leaving group in disulfide exchange reactions (13Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 14Zapun A. Cooper L. Creighton T.E.

Cell. 1995; 83: 947-955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In order for DsbA to act as a catalyst of disulfide bond formation, it needs to be reoxidized. Genetic studies strongly implicate an inner membrane protein called DsbB in the reoxidation of DsbA (17Missiakas D. Georgopoulos C. Raina S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7084-7088Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 18Bardwell J.C. Lee J.O. Jander G. Martin N. Belin D. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Evidence that DsbB is required for the reoxidation of DsbA includes the observation that DsbA accumulates in a reduced form in DsbB mutants (18Bardwell J.C. Lee J.O. Jander G. Martin N. Belin D. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The isolation from cells of a DsbA-DsbB dimer covalently linked by a disulfide bond implies a direct interaction between the two proteins (19Guilhot C. Jander G. Martin N.L. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9895-9899Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 20Kishigami S. Kanaya E. Kikuchi M. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17072-17074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We have proposed a pathway for disulfide bond formation that involves the transfer of disulfides between DsbB and DsbA (Ref. 18Bardwell J.C. Lee J.O. Jander G. Martin N. Belin D. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, Fig. 1). DsbB contains two periplasmic domains, each of which possesses two essential cysteines (21Jander G. Martin N.L. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5121-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 22Kishigami S. Ito K. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Compared with DsbA, surprisingly little is known about DsbB, nothing is known about its redox properties, it is not known how it reoxidizes DsbA, and it is not known how DsbB in turn is reoxidized. Our ultimate aims are 1) to understand this disulfide catalytic machine in enough detail to be able to reconstitute it in vitro, 2) to understand how disulfide bond formation is linked to the metabolism of the cell, and 3) to understand how the catalytic properties of DsbB allow it to specifically oxidize DsbA. To accomplish these aims, biochemical investigation of the properties of DsbB is clearly warranted. We report here the reconstitution of the DsbA-DsbB catalytic system in vitro and the demonstration that this system is oxygen-dependent. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—We constructed an Escherichia coli strain that overproduces DsbB by cloning the protein coding region of the dsbB gene under the isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-inducible T5 promoter of pQE70 (Qiagen®) to generate pBJ5-3. This clone was constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the dsbB coding region from plasmid p24-1 (18Bardwell J.C. Lee J.O. Jander G. Martin N. Belin D. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Primers CB8 5′-CCCCCGCATGCTGCGATTTTTGAACC-3′ and CB9 5′-GGAAGATCTGCGACCGAACAGATCACG-3′ were used to amplify DNA encoding DsbB. Primer CB8 introduces a SphI site at the initiation codon and introduces a silent mutation in the second codon. Primer CB9 generates a BglII site that replaces the termination codon. Ligating this polymerase chain reaction product cleaved with the enzymes SphI and BglII to the plasmid pQE70, which had been cleaved by SphI and BglII, fuses a six-residue histidine tag onto the C terminus of DsbB. The sequence of DsbB was confirmed to be correct after polymerase chain reaction and cloning. The DsbB-overproducing plasmid was transformed into DHB5844 to generate JCB851. DHB5844 is MC1000 malFΔ3 phoR phoAΔPvuII pOXgen, pIq tet. It was a gift of D. Boyd (Harvard Medical School). JCB851 was grown to an A 600 of 0.7, and DsbB expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 15 μm followed by continued shaking for 4 h. Induction with higher concentrations of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was found to lead to rapid growth cessation and cell lysis before detectable quantities of DsbB accumulated. Two liters of cell culture were centrifuged at 5000 × g for 15 min and resuspended in 20 ml of cold buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). All further steps were carried out at 4 °C. Cells were broken by ultrasonication. Aggregates and cell debris were removed by two low speed centrifugations at 5000 × g and 15,000 ×g for 30 min in a Sorvall SS34 rotor. Membranes were prepared from the supernatant of the second low speed spin by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min in a Beckman type 50.2Ti rotor. The membrane pellet was washed with buffer B (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and resuspended in 10 ml of buffer B, and glycerol was added to a final concentration of 10%. Membranes containing DsbB were used directly in the DsbA reoxidation assay described below or frozen at −70 °C. Stored under these conditions, the membranes retained their DsbA oxidizing activity for at least four months. As a negative control, we also prepared membranes from the dsbB null mutant JCB819. JCB819 is MC1000dsbB::kan5 phoR malF-lacZ102 zih12::Tn 10. The DsbB protein was identified as an overproduced band that migrates on 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Novex) with an apparent molecular weight of 20,000, consistent with the predicted M r of 20,965. This band was detectable after Coomassie Blue staining of DsbB-overproducing membrane preparations but was absent from membranes prepared from WM70. WM70 carries the expression plasmid pQE70 without the dsbB gene and is isogenic to JCB851. In order to quantify the amount of DsbB present in the membranes, we scanned Coomassie-stained gels using an LKB Ultroscan scanner with purified DsbB serving as a quantification standard. Membranes prepared from JCB851 were resuspended in a solubilization buffer composed of 50 mm phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 1%n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, pH 8.0. The sample was freed of insoluble material by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 60 min in a 50.2Ti rotor. The supernatant was then loaded on a Ni-nitrilotriacetic-agarose column (Qiagen) equilibrated with 50 mm phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, pH 8.0. After washing with the same buffer adjusted to pH 6.0, DsbB was eluted from the column by a imidazole gradient ranging from 0 to 0.5 m at pH 6.0. Peak fractions were pooled, and the concentration of DsbB was determined by UV absorption using a calculated extinction coefficient of 47,870m−1 cm−1 (23Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5048) Google Scholar). The purity of DsbB was >90% as judged by Coomassie-stained gels. A standard curve was obtained by scanning Coomassie stained gels using defined concentrations of purified DsbB and defined amounts of membrane. Fortunately, DsbB runs in a very isolated region of the gel, minimizing background problems when scanning the gel (Fig. 4). We used membranes from the strain WM70 as a negative control in this quantification. Our assay is based on the observation that reduced DsbA has about a 3-fold higher tryptophan fluorescence than the oxidized form of the protein (6Zapun A. Bardwell J.C.A. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5083-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This change in fluorescence is frequently used to monitor the relative amounts of DsbA that are present in the oxidized and reduced forms (13Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 16Grauschopf U. Winther J.R. Korber P. Zander T. Dallinger P. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 947-955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 29Wunderlich M. Otto A. Seckler R. Glockshuber R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12251-12256Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). DsbA was purified from periplasmic extracts of the DsbA-overproducing strain JCB607 using Resource Q anion exchange chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), essentially as described previously (9Martin J.L. Bardwell J.C.A. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1993; 365: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The purity of DsbA was >98% as judged by Coomassie-stained gels. Purified DsbA was reduced by incubation in 20 mmDTT 1The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; kan, kanamycin; GSSG, glutathione oxidized form; GSH, glutathione reduced form; AMS, 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonate; DsbAred, DsbA reduced form; DsbAox, DsbA oxidized form. for 10 min at 4 °C. DTT was then removed by gel filtration on PD-10 Sephadex columns (Amersham) and concentrated to 5 mg/ml using an Amicon® 50-ml ultrafiltration unit. Reduced DsbA was stored at −70 °C in the presence of 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8. Samples of DsbA stored in this manner were tested just before use to determine the percent air oxidation that had occurred upon storage. This was done by determining the change in tryptophan fluorescence after the addition of 2 mm DTT. Typically <5% air oxidation was detected for storage times of up to 2 months. Fluorescence measurements were performed in a Hitachi F-4800 spectrofluorimeter equipped with a magnetic stir bar. The wavelength used for tryptophan excitation was 295 nm, and the emission wavelength monitored was 330 nm. Measurements were made in a buffer C (10 mm citrate, 10 mmphosphate, 10 mm borate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 6.0). This buffer was used because the wide pH range over which it could exert buffering capacity made it also suitable for determining the optimal pH of this reaction. Oxidation of DsbA was detected by a time-dependent decrease in tryptophan fluorescence. Initial velocities were derived from initial slopes. These values were corrected for inner filter effect according to Equation 1 (24Copeland R.A. Enzymes: A Practical Introduction to Structure, Mechanism, and Data Analysis. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1996Google Scholar), Fcorr=Fobs·10Aem+Aex2,Equation 1 where F corr and F obs are corrected and observed fluorescence units, respectively. A ex and A em correspond to the absorption at the excitation or emission wavelength. The extinction coefficients used for DsbA were 6045 m−1 cm−1 at the 295-nm excitation wavelength and 491 m−1 cm−1 at the 330-nm emission wavelength. We demonstrated that after correction for the inner filter effect, the fluorescence increase upon addition of reduced DsbA was linear with the increase of fluorescence over a wide range of DsbA concentrations from 0 to at least 50 μm. These corrected changes in fluorescence could be directly related to changes in the concentration of reduced DsbA. The intrinsic fluorescence of the membranes showed no change upon the addition of 2 mm reduced DTT or 2 mmoxidized GSSG. Since the membranes showed no redox-dependent changes in fluorescence, they were assumed to stay constant during the course of the reaction. The reaction between DsbA and DsbB was performed as described above except the amount of membranes used was decreased 10-fold, and 0.2 mm EDTA was added to avoid spontaneous air oxidation of DsbA. At different times, samples were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet was washed with acetone and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm AMS, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA. AMS is a reagent that covalently reacts with free thiols, adding a 490-Da group (12Joly J.C. Swartz J.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10067-10072Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The sample was then run on a 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Novex gel under nonreducing conditions. The mobility shift corresponding to the reaction of this reagent with reduced DsbA was detected by Coomassie staining. Rapid kinetic measurements were performed with a Hi-Tech Scientific Model SF-61 stopped flow fluorospectrophotometer that was controlled by a Macintosh IIcx using KISS software (Kinetic Instruments, Inc.). The optical path length of the observation cell was 1 cm. The stopped flow apparatus was rendered anaerobic by scrubbing the flow system with anaerobic buffer solution containing 0.1 unit/ml protocatechuic acid dioxygenase (31Bull C. Ballou D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12673-12680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 400 mm protocatechuic acid. This solution was allowed to stand in the flow system overnight and then was thoroughly rinsed out with anaerobic buffer before experiments. Reduced DsbA solution and membrane fractions containing DsbB were rendered anaerobic by 10 × gas exchange with pure argon in glass tanometers. The excitation wavelength was set to 295 nm with a 320-nm cut-off filter. Emission was monitored over a range from 325–335 nm. DsbA can be treated as a substrate for DsbB. To obtain the K m value of DsbB with DsbA as a substrate, we determined initial velocities of DsbA oxidation for a wide range of DsbA concentrations. The plot of substrate concentration versus initial velocity was fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Sigma Plot (Jandel Scientific). To measure the pH dependence of the reaction, we first adjusted the pH of polybuffer C by the addition of HCl or NaOH over the pH range 5.0–9.0. Buffer C contained 300 mm NaCl, and there was no significant change in salt concentration as measured by conductivity after pH titration. We then measured the initial rate of DsbA oxidation by DsbB-containing membranes. The concentration of DsbA used in these experiments was 20 μm, which corresponds to about 2-fold over the K m value. The fluorescence of DsbA is slightly pH-dependent (13Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). To correct for this, we measured the fluorescence of DsbA in its oxidized form and after reduction using 2 mm DTT. Using the obtained correction factors, we were able to directly transform the initial velocities of fluorescence decrease to velocities of DsbA oxidation. To verify that DsbA and the membranes are stable over this pH range, we checked for the presence of aggregation by obtaining UV absorption spectra from the DsbA and membrane reaction mixtures before and after a 15-min incubation in Buffer C at the various pH values. Aggregation can be detected by an increase in UV absorption in the range of 330–300 nm. No significant differences in UV spectra could be detected during the time range of the experiment over the entire pH range varying from pH 5.0 to 9.0 indicating that no significant aggregation had occurred. The DsbA protein acts as a disulfide catalyst by directly donating its disulfide to folding periplasmic proteins (3Bardwell J.C.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Genetic evidence suggests that a second protein called DsbB acts to reoxidize DsbA (18Bardwell J.C. Lee J.O. Jander G. Martin N. Belin D. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Since it appears that the interaction between the DsbA and DsbB proteins is specific, we have started investigating this important disulfide exchange reaction in vitro. For this purpose it was necessary to develop a specific biochemical assay for DsbB activity. We have succeeded in developing a fluorescence assay for DsbB activity that allows us to directly follow the oxidation of DsbA by DsbB. Our assay is based on the observation that reduced DsbA has an about 3-fold higher tryptophan fluorescence than the oxidized form of the protein (6Zapun A. Bardwell J.C.A. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5083-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This provides a very convenient way of following the oxidation or reduction of DsbA in solution (13Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 16Grauschopf U. Winther J.R. Korber P. Zander T. Dallinger P. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 947-955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 29Wunderlich M. Otto A. Seckler R. Glockshuber R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12251-12256Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). When reduced DsbA is incubated in buffer C at 30 °C, only a very slow decline in fluorescence is observed (See Fig. 2). This effect is probably due to gradual air oxidation of DsbA. Air oxidation of thiols can be catalyzed by metal ions. It is, however, very slow for DsbA and can be eliminated by the addition of 0.2 mm EDTA (see Fig. 3). The addition of membrane fractions prepared from a dsbB null mutant strain had no effect on this gradual oxidation. The upper line in Fig. 2 shows the time course for 10 μm reduced DsbA in the presence of membranes prepared from the dsbB null mutant, JCB819.Figure 3AMS treatment of DsbA confirms its oxidation by DsbB present in membranes. DsbA was incubated with and without added DsbB-containing membranes and trapped with AMS after various times (see “Experimental Procedures”). The concentration of reduced (red) DsbA was 20 μm. After incubation with DsbB+ membrane, DsbA shifts to a low molecular weight band. This occurs because the two cysteines of DsbA get oxidized and become resistant to reaction with AMS. The reaction was also followed by fluorescence. The following percentages of oxidized DsbA were calculated from the fluorescence measurements 14% (0.5 h), 32% (1 h), 55% (2 h), and 93% (5 h). They agree well with the observed gel shifts. The experiment was also carried out in the presence of membranes prepared from a dsbB null mutant (last lane). DsbA shows no shift to the low molecular weight band in this case.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In contrast, when a membrane fraction prepared from a DsbB-overproducing strain is added, the fluorescence decreases rapidly, indicating the rapid oxidation of DsbA. The fluorescence reaches a constant minimal value in about 30 min. suggesting that DsbA was completely oxidized (see Fig. 2). To verify that DsbA was oxidized to completion, we showed that no further decline in fluorescence accompanied the addition of oxidized glutathione to a final concentration of 2 mm, redox conditions known to completely oxidize DsbA (7Zapun A. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5202-5211Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To verify that the decline in fluorescence was due to cysteine oxidation, two experiments were performed, DTT reduction and AMS trapping. We added DTT to a final concentration of 2 mm and observed that the original fluorescence level was regained, showing that the decrease in fluorescence was due to sulfhydryl oxidation only. Evidence that DsbA is reoxidized during the assay also comes from AMS trapping experiments (Fig. 3). AMS reacts specifically and irreversibly with sulfhydryl groups, conjugating a large, 490-Dalton moiety to the free cysteines. This major change in molecular weight can be used to clearly separate oxidized from reduced DsbA on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels (12Joly J.C. Swartz J.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10067-10072Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In order to minimize the amount of membrane proteins on the gel and distinguish DsbA from membrane proteins, we used 10-fold less membranes than in the fluorescence assay shown in Fig. 2. The addition of DsbB-containing membranes resulted in a time-dependent change in reactivity of DsbA to AMS. The oxidation of DsbA was also followed by fluorescence. The amount of oxidized DsbA increased in a parallel fashion by both measures (see legend to Fig. 3). DsbA exposed for several hours to membranes prepared from a dsbB − strain did not show any measurable oxidation as measured by AMS reactivity (Fig. 3). To show that DsbB was active in catalytic amounts, we scanned Coomassie Blue-stained gels of membrane preparations to determine the quantity of DsbB present in the membranes used in the assay. A standard curve was constructed by loading various concentrations of DsbB purified by nickel affinity chromatography as a standard (Fig. 4). The concentration of DsbB in membranes used for the measurement shown in Fig. 2 was determined to be 60 nm. Since this quantity of DsbB could oxidize to completion 10 μm DsbA, a 166-fold excess, it is clear that DsbB is acting enzymatically rather than in a stochiometric manner. In the AMS trapping experiments shown in Fig. 3, 10-fold-less DsbB-containing membranes were used, putting DsbA (20 μm) into a 3300-fold excess. The finding that DsbB acts catalytically implies that it is getting reoxidized itself during the assay. In order to determine if oxygen was involved as a electron acceptor for DsbB, we ran the assay under strictly anaerobic conditions. Fig. 5 shows that DsbB is not able to oxidize DsbA in the absence of oxygen. Extensive degassing of the buffer solutions and scrubbing of the flow system with the enzymatic deoxygenation system protocatechuic acid dioxygenase was necessary to remove enough oxygen to inhibit the reaction. This implies that the DsbB-containing membranes are able to utilize even small amounts of oxygen in order to allow catalysis of disulfide bond formation. When 20% oxygen is allowed to diffuse into the anaerobic buffer, the reaction rapidly initiates, and DsbA is oxidized by DsbB. Thus, the ability of DsbB to oxidize depends strongly on the presence of oxygen. It is important to note that oxygen only very slowly oxidizes DsbA in the absence of DsbB and that this slow reaction is inhibited by EDTA, implying that it is due to metal catalyzed oxidation. The DsbB-dependent reaction, on the other hand, proceeds at the same rate in the presence of 0.2–2.5 mmEDTA (Fig. 3 and data not shown). To further investigate the catalytic role of DsbB, we measured the dependence of the reaction on DsbA concentration. The concentration of DsbA was varied, whereas the concentration of DsbB was held constant, and the initial velocities of fluorescence decrease were measured. The fluorescence decrease was linear with time for greater than 10 min. Spontaneous oxidation of DsbA by air was negligible over this time period. Fig. 6 shows the relationship between DsbA concentration and the initial velocity of DsbA oxidation. This velocity was derived from the original fluorescence data by correction for the “inner filter effect” (see “Experimental Procedures”). This effect is due to the absorption of the DsbA fluorescent signal by DsbA itself. The corrected data could be fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation, yielding a hyperbolic curve. DsbB thus shows classical Michaelis-Menten behavior. We calculate a K m value for DsbB of 9.6 ± 0.7 μm and a turnover number of 24 ± 0.7 min−1 at pH 6.0, with DsbA serving as a substrate. To show that our assay for DsbB is linear with respect to enzyme concentration, we measured initial velocities of DsbA reoxidation varying the amount of membrane and thus, the amount of DsbB added. As predicted by the Michaelis-Menten equation, the initial velocity was a linear function of the DsbB concentration over at least the range of 10–50 nm DsbB (data not shown). Thiol disulfide interchange reactions are generally rather pH-sensitive. To determine if this is the case for the enzymatic activity of DsbB, we tested the pH dependence of its ability to reoxidize DsbA. The relationship between pH and initial velocity of DsbA oxidation is shown in Fig. 7. In sharp contrast to many disulfide exchange reactions, the reoxidation of DsbA by DsbB occurs at a similar rate over a rather broad pH range. Also, in contrast to many disulfide exchange reactions that have a pH optimum of around 9, the pH optima of DsbB is about 6. We report here the first biochemical characterization of the reaction between DsbA and DsbB, two proteins that are essential for disulfide bond formation in prokaryotes. DsbA serves as the direct donor of disulfides to folding proteins. That the DsbB protein is required for the reoxidation of DsbA was suggested by the observation that DsbA accumulates in a reduced form in DsbB mutants (18Bardwell J.C. Lee J.O. Jander G. Martin N. Belin D. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Compared with the extensive knowledge we have about the DsbA mode of action, relatively little is known about DsbB. To understand the mechanism of DsbB action, we have developed a sensitive fluorescence-based assay to follow the DsbA-DsbB disulfide exchange reaction. Using this assay, we have succeeded in demonstrating that membranes containing DsbB rapidly reoxidize DsbA to completion in a reaction that is oxygen-dependent. The protein or small molecule that serves as the reoxidant for DsbB has been a mystery since DsbB was discovered 6 years ago. The ability to reproduce the oxidation of DsbA by DsbB in vitro allows us to take a biochemical approach to investigate which electron acceptors are capable of reoxidizing DsbB. For DsbB to work as a catalyst, it must be continuously reoxidized during the progress of the reaction. We are able to demonstrate that the final electron acceptor for the electrons of DsbB is oxygen. Extensive degassing and scrubbing of solutions was necessary to inhibit the reaction, implying that even low levels of oxygen are sufficient to catalyze DsbB-dependent disulfide catalysis. It was originally proposed that components of the electron transport chain serve to capture the excess electrons that are generated when DsbB is reoxidized. Attempts to demonstrate a defect in disulfide bond formation in mutants that lack one or more of these components have met with mixed results. There is one report of significant defects associated with mutations in the genes for ubiquinone and menaquinone, but another was unable to detect any defects (30Kobayashi T. Kishigami S. Sone M. Inokuchi H. Mogi T. Ito K Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11857-11862Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 25Jander, G. (1996) Genetic Studies on Protein Folding and Protein Secretion in Escherichia coli. Ph.D. Thesis, Harvard University.Google Scholar). This difficulty in detection is not remarkable; simple calculations show that the flow of electrons through the disulfide catalytic machinery is minor compared with the needs of oxidative phosphorylation. Two electrons are generated when a disulfide bond is formed in a protein, but the synthesis of the protein itself produces a flow of ∼1000 electrons through the electron transport system for a protein of 40,000M r (26Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996Google Scholar). The availability of an isolated membrane system that shows DsbB and oxygen-dependent reoxidation of DsbA will allow us to test the influence of these components on the electron transport system independent of the need for oxidative phosphorylation. It remains possible that DsbB transfers its electrons directly to oxygen and does not require a functional electron transport chain in order to get reoxidized. One of our long term goals is the complete reconstitution of the disulfide catalytic system from prokaryotes using only purified components. The availability of an assay for DsbB function opens up for the first time the possibility of this reconstitution. The concentration of DsbA in our assay is up to 3300-fold in excess over DsbB, showing that DsbB is acting as a catalyst. DsbB acts on DsbA as an enzyme with DsbA being the substrate. DsbB displays typical Michaelis-Menten behavior. The K m observed of DsbB for DsbA is 10 μm, suggesting a rather specific interaction. This specificity is strongly supported by genetic data. If DsbB was capable of directly oxidizing a wide range of substrate proteins like DsbA can, there would be no need for the DsbA protein, and mutations in dsbA would not eliminate disulfide bond formation. The K m value is remarkably close to the calculated value of the concentration of DsbA in the periplasm of about 8 μm. This value was calculated based on the number of DsbA molecules present per cell, determined to be 850, and the periplasmic volume, assumed to be 20% of the total cell volume (5Akiyama Y. Kamitani S. Kusukawa N. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22440-22445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,26Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996Google Scholar). One of the unusual properties of DsbB is its ability to maintain activity over a rather wide pH range, with a pH optimum in the acidic range. Thiol groups can only serve as attacking species when they are present as the thiolate anion. This makes thiol disulfide exchange reactions very pH-sensitive. The rate of reaction generally declines 10-fold for each pH unit below the p K a of the attacking group. Disulfide exchange between small molecules containing thiol groups such as glutathione show a pH optimum of 9 and are 1000-fold slower at pH 6 (27Gilbert H.F. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1990; 63: 69-172PubMed Google Scholar). DsbB is able to function well over a broad pH range including mildly acidic conditions. This makes very good physiological sense. The pH of the periplasm is expected to vary widely, depending on the pH of the media. Disulfide bond formation is required to be catalyzed over this wide range of pH values, but catalysis is especially needed under acidic conditions near the minimal growth pH of E. coli, pH 4.4, where disulfide exchange with small molecules would be vanishingly slow (27Gilbert H.F. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1990; 63: 69-172PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lin J. Lee I.S. Frey J. Slonczewski J.L. Foster J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4097-4104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DsbA shows a similarly buffered ability to oxidize substrates over a wide pH range including acidic pH (29Wunderlich M. Otto A. Seckler R. Glockshuber R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12251-12256Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This is in part due to the very low p K a of the first cysteine in the active site of DsbA (16Grauschopf U. Winther J.R. Korber P. Zander T. Dallinger P. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 947-955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to see what properties of DsbB are responsible for it still being active below pH 6.0. Our assay opens up the door to investigate the biochemical properties of DsbB and the biochemistry of the DsbA-DsbB interaction. Our ability to test for active DsbB should allow the purification of DsbB based on activity. This should allow direct determination of which factors in addition to DsbB are required for oxidation of DsbA. We thank Ursula Jakob, Eric Olson, Laurent DeBarbieux, David Geigel, Dave Bellou, and Charlie Yocum for useful suggestions. We also thank Dave Ballou for the use of his stopped flow fluorospectrophotometer and tireless instruction as to its proper use."

We have tested the interaction between these cytosolic proteins in an assay that measures the formation of constitutive transport vesicles from the TGN in a hepatocyte cell-free system. This reaction is dependent on a novel PI 3-kinase, and we now report that, under conditions of limiting cytosol, purified PI 3-kinase and PITP functionally cooperate to drive exocytic vesicle formation. This synergy was observed with both yeast and mammalian PITPs, and it also extended to the formation of PI 3-phosphate. These collective findings indicate that the PI 3-kinase and PITP synergize to form a pool of PI 3-phosphate that is essential for formation of exocytic vesicles from the hepatocyte TGN.

Much effort has recently been focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie the various vesicular trafficking reactions that operate throughout the eukaryotic secretory pathway. The p62cplx is a cytosolic complex required for the formation of polymeric IgA receptor (pIgA-R) 1The abbreviations used are: pIgA-R, polymeric IgA receptor; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PITP, phosphatidylinositol transfer protein; SGF, stacked Golgi fraction; TGN, trans-Golgi network; PI(3)P, PI 3-phosphate; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; PC, phosphatidylcholine; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. containing exocytic transport vesicle from the TGN of hepatocytes. The p62cplx consists of a 62-kDa phosphoprotein and a 25-kDa GTPase and regulates the activity of a novel PI-specific PI 3-kinase (1Jones S.M. Crosby J.R. Salamero J. Howell K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 775-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 2Jones S.M. Howell K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In cytosol, the p62 molecule is phosphorylated and is not associated with the PI 3-kinase catalytic subunit. Upon receipt of some unknown signal, p62 is dephosphorylated, the PI 3-kinase regulatory p62cplx and catalytic subunits assemble with the cytoplasmic domain of TGN38 (an integral membrane protein of the TGN), and exocytic vesicle formation ensues. The PI 3-kinase activity is wortmannin-sensitive at micromolar concentrations and is stimulated by the activation of the p62cplx -associated 25-kDa GTPase. Present evidence suggests that the essential function of the PI 3-kinase in exocytic vesicle formation from the TGN is the generation of a specific PI(3)P pool. Supporting evidence comes from the demonstration that both catalytic activity and vesicle formation are equally inhibited by wortmannin. PITPs also have been demonstrated to function in vesicle formation from the TGN in yeast and mammalian systems (3Bankaitis V.A. Malehorn D.E. Emr S.D. Greene R. J.

Nature. 1990; 347: 561-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), and this essential Sec14p requirement can be bypassed by modulation of metabolic flux through specific phospholipid biosynthetic pathways (6Cleves A.E.

Bankaitis V.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In mammalian membrane trafficking reactions both the formation of TGN-derived transport vesicles of constitutive and regulated secretory pathways and the regulated fusion of secretory granules with the plasma membrane are stimulated by PITP (5Ohashi, M., Jan de Vries, K., Frank, R., Snoek, G., Bankaitis, V. A., Wirtz, K., and Huttner, W. B. Nature, 377,544–547.Google Scholar, 9Hay J.C. Martin T.F.J. Nature. 1993; 366: 572-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Whereas PITP cooperates with at least one other unidentified cytosolic factor to stimulate TGN-derived vesicle production, the mechanism of PITP function in that reaction remains unresolved (5Ohashi, M., Jan de Vries, K., Frank, R., Snoek, G., Bankaitis, V. A., Wirtz, K., and Huttner, W. B. Nature, 377,544–547.Google Scholar). In the secretory granule fusion reaction, PITP synergizes with phospholipid kinases to generate PI 4,5-bisphosphate (10Hay J.C. Fisette P.L. Jenkins G.H. Fukami K. Takenawa T. Anderson R.A. Martin T.F.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). One of the mechanisms by which PITP may stimulate phosphoinositide synthesis is by presenting PI to PI kinases (11Cunningham E. Thomas G.M. Ball A. Hiles I. Cockcroft S. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 775-783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 12Cunningham E. Tan S.K. Swigart P., J. Hsuan J. Bankaitis V.A. Cockcroft S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This concept remains controversial (14Currie R.A. MacLeod B.M.G. Downes C.P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 184-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this paper, PITP is shown to be an essential component required for the efficient, cell-free formation of pIgA-R containing exocytic vesicles from the hepatocyte TGN. PITP synergizes with the p62cplx -associated PI 3-kinase in the formation of PI(3)P, and this synergy extends to formation of exocytic transport vesicles from the TGN. Unless otherwise indicated, all chemicals were obtained from Sigma or Boehringer Mannheim. Phosphatidylinositol was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, (Alabaster, AL). Production of specific antibodies against the pIgA-R and PITP has been described (15Sztul E.S. Howell K.E. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1248-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 16Skinner H.B. Alb Jr., J.G. Whitters E.A. Helmkamp Jr., G.M. Bankaitis V.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4775-4784Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Stacked Golgi fractions (SGF) were isolated from rat liver according to Taylor et al. (17Taylor R.S. Jones S.M. Dahl R.H. Nordeen M. Howell K.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1911-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Briefly, livers were removed, finely minced, and resuspended at 6 g/10 ml 0.5 m sucrose in 100 mm KPO4, pH 6.8, 5 mmMgCl2, and 1 μg/ml each of a mixture of proteolytic inhibitors: chymstatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin. All sucrose solutions contained the same buffer and proteolytic inhibitors. The homogenate was centrifuged (1500 × g for 10 min) to pellet unbroken cells, cell debris, and nuclei. This pellet contained at least 50% of the cell protein. The resulting supernatant (PNS) was loaded in the middle of a sucrose step gradient in an SW28 tube; steps of 1.3 and 0.86 m sucrose were overlaid with the PNS supernatant (0.5 m) followed by a 0.25 m layer and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). The 0.5 m sucrose soluble fraction was collected and used for the preparation of cytosol. The SII fraction (0.5/0.86 m interface) was adjusted to 1.15m sucrose with 2 m sucrose using a refractometer (Bausch & Lomb, Boston, MA). The adjusted SII was loaded into the bottom of an SW28 tube and overlaid with equal volumes of 1.0, 0.86, and 0.25 m sucrose and centrifuged for 3 h at 76,000 × g. The resulting SGF floated to the 0.25/0.86m sucrose interface. The two-dimensional gel mapping of the protein composition of the fraction is presented in Taylor et al. (18Taylor R.S. Fialka I. Jones S.M. Huber L.A. Howell K.E. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2601-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To prepare cytosol the soluble 0.5 m sucrose fraction of the first gradient was adjusted to 0.25 msucrose with 100 mm KPO4, pH 6.8, 5 mm MgCl2 and centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g to remove any pelletable material. The remaining supernatant was concentrated using an Amicon fitted with a PM10 membrane to ∼40 mg/ml (Amicon, Beverly MA). Protein assays (DC Protein Assay, Bio-Rad) were carried out on all fractions. Aliquots of these fractions were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out using a 5–15% acrylamide gradient and the buffer system of Maizel (19Maizel J.V. Methods Virol. 1971; 5: 179-246Crossref Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis molecular weight standards were from Bio-Rad. For immunoblots, nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell) were blocked for 1 h in 5% defatted milk/phosphate-buffered saline/0.02% sodium azide. The filters were incubated overnight in primary antibody and washed. When using a mouse primary antibody, the filters were incubated with rabbit antibodies against mouse IgG for 2 h before the blots were visualized using 125I-protein A (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) by autoradiography and quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Immunopurification and analysis of PI 3-kinase activity were as described (2Jones S.M. Howell K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). SGF (1 mg) was solubilized in 1 ml of CHAPS buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm CHAPS and proteolytic inhibitors) for 1 h on ice with vortexing. Samples were centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 ×g in a microfuge, and the soluble material was incubated overnight with an immunoaffinity column to which antibodies against p62 were covalently bound. The column was washed with three bed volumes of CHAPS buffer and seven bed volumes of phosphate-buffered saline, and the column was eluted with two bed volumes 0.2 m glycine, pH 2.8. The eluted fraction was neutralized and concentrated and dialyzed into PAN (20 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 100 mmNaCl) for assay of enzymatic activity. The p62cplx -associated PI 3-kinase immunopurified from SGF contains dimeric TGN38 (the transmembrane receptor for the PI 3-kinase), the p62cplx (62-kDa regulatory subunit bound to a 25-kDa GTPase), and an ∼100-kDa catalytic subunit. All experiments are carried out with p62cplx -associated PI 3-kinase isolated from SGF. The p62cplx in the cytoplasm is not associated with the PI 3-kinase catalytic subunit and has no PI 3-kinase activity. Hexahistidine-tagged Sec14p was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified essentially as described previously (20Skinner H.B. McGee T.P. McMaster C.R. Fry M.R. Bell R.M. Bankaitis V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested, resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.1, 300 mm sodium chloride, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm NaN3, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and disrupted in a bead beater (Biospec Products). The homogenate was serially clarified by centrifugation at 5,000 × g, 12,000 ×g, and 100,000 × g. Sec14p was precipitated at 50% saturation with ammonium sulfate, and precipitates were dissolved in lysis buffer, dialyzed exhaustively against the same, loaded onto a column of Ni+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen), and eluted with a linear gradient of imidazole (0–200 mm) in lysis buffer. Peak fractions were collected and dialyzed against lysis buffer. The purified Sec14p does not contain either PI or phosphatidylcholine (PC) because these two lipids are not synthesized in E. coli. Sec14p was subsequently bound either with egg PC or PI (Avanti Polar Lipids) by incubation at room temperature for 3–4 h in the presence of at least a 100:1 molar ratio of phospholipid:Sec14p with phospholipid presented in the form of unilamellar vesicles. Protein was rebound to a Ni+-nitrilotriacetic acid column and re-eluted as before. The preparation was dialyzed exhaustively against 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm NaN3, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Purified Sec14p (25 μg) contained one unit of PI transter activity. Hexahistidine-tagged rat PITPα was generated by cloning the rat PITPα structural gene into the pQE31 vector (Qiagen).E. coli expressing the His6-tagged PITPα were harvested, resuspended in ice cold lysis buffer, and disrupted as above. The homogenate was serially clarified at 5,000 ×g, 12,000 × g, and 100,000 ×g, and the 100,000 × g supernatant was used in the PI 3-kinase and transfer assays. The bacterial high speed supernatant (1 mg) contained one unit of PI transfer activity. PI transfer assays have been described previously (20Skinner H.B. McGee T.P. McMaster C.R. Fry M.R. Bell R.M. Bankaitis V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Briefly, rat liver microsomes were employed as [3H]PI donors in the transfer reaction, and unlabeled PC liposomes served as acceptor vesicles. Reaction mixtures (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) were incubated with either purified Sec14p or lysates containing rat PITPα lysates at 37 °C. After 30 min the reactions were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to pellet the donor microsomes, and 1 ml of the supernatant was collected for scintillation counting. Under these conditions, the PI transfer reaction is linear as long as the input concentrations of yeast or mammalian PITP sustain 20% transfer or less. One unit of activity is defined as the amount of transfer protein that catalyzes the transfer of 1% radiolabeled phospholipid in 1 min (21Aitken J.F. van Heusden P.H. Temkin M. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4711-4717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cell-free assay of budding from an immobilized SGF was carried out as described (22Salamero J. Sztul E.S. Howell K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7717-7721Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Each assay contains 2.5 mg of magnetic core and shell beads with approximately 50 μg of SGF immobilized. The immobilized fraction is characterized in Ref. 23Jones S.M. Dahl R.H. Ugelstad J. Howell K.E. Celis J. 2nd Ed. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. II. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1997: 12-25Google Scholar. For the budding reaction the immobilized fraction was incubated in 2.5 ml containing 0.70 mg/ml cytosol, 25 mm HEPES, pH 6.7, 25 mm KCl, 1.5 mm magnesium acetate, 1.0 mm ATP, an ATP regenerating system (8.0 mmcreatine phosphate, 0.043 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase), and 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (final concentrations). After 10 min at 37 °C the Golgi fraction remaining on the beads was retrieved with a magnet, and the budded vesicles remained in the supernatant. The high concentration of soluble protein made it impractical to carry out gel analysis on the total budded fraction. Therefore, the budded fraction was pelleted through a 0.25 m sucrose cushion (for 1 h at 100,000 × g) to reduce the large amounts of cytosolic protein and 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin present in the budding reaction. The pellet was resuspended in gel sample buffer and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The amount of exocytic vesicle budding was determined by quantitative immunoblotting using the mature, sialylated pIgA-R (116 kDa) as the marker, and budding efficiency is calculated by determining the percentage of the 116-kDa form of the pIgA-R that is present in the budded fraction with reference to the total amount in the starting immoblized SGF. The pIgA-R is a PM receptor synthesized in relatively high amounts in rat liver (15Sztul E.S. Howell K.E. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1248-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and is used to define a specific population of exocytic vesicles (22Salamero J. Sztul E.S. Howell K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7717-7721Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Budding of this marker in the presence of the complete cell-free system is ∼70% efficient. When the ATP regenerating system and cytosol are omitted, the background budding is ∼5%. There is no detectable PITP on the SGF, therefore, in antibody inhibition studies the antibodies against PITP were added only to cytosol for 30 min on ice before addition of cytosol to the assay. PI 3-kinase assays were as described in Refs. 2Jones S.M. Howell K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar and 24Kazlauskas A. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3279-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar. Isolated complexes (5 μl) in PAN were resuspended in a reaction mixture containing 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.45 mmEGTA, 10 μm ATP (∼5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP), and 200 μg/ml PI in a final reaction volume of 20 μl and incubated for 0–20 min at 30 °C. After incubation the reaction was stopped with 100 μl of 1 mHCl, and the lipids were extracted with 200 μl of CHCl3:MeOH (1:1) followed by 80 μl of 1 mHCl:MeOH (1:1) and dried in a speed vac (Savant, Farmingdale, NY). The samples were resuspended in 10 μl of CHCl3:MeOH (1:1) and spotted onto Silica Gel 60 TLC plates (JT Baker Chromatography; Union City, CA). The TLC plates had been pretreated with 60 mmEDTA, 2% sodium tartrate, and 50% EtOH and dried in a 100 °C oven overnight. Development of the TLC plates was in CHCl3:MeOH:4 n NH4OH (9:7:2) for approximately 2 h, and then the plates were dried for PhosphorImager analysis and subsequently exposed to film for autoradiography. PITP is a cytosolic factor that plays an essential role in secretory vesicle formation from the yeast Golgi complex and constitutive and regulated secretory granules in neuroendocrine cells (4Bankaitis V.A.

Cell. 1991; 64: 789-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). We have used two independent approaches to examine whether PITP is required for cell-free formation of pIgA-R containing vesicles from the rat hepatocyte TGN. First, the cell-free assay was challenged with a polyclonal antibody that recognizes both rat PITPα and PITPβ isoforms (16Skinner H.B. Alb Jr., J.G. Whitters E.A. Helmkamp Jr., G.M. Bankaitis V.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4775-4784Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). A concentration-dependent inhibition of vesicle formation was observed (Fig. 1). The ∼65% budding efficiency of the control assay was reduced to ∼40, 25, and 10% by 5, 10, and 15 μg of antiserum, respectively. This inhibition was specific as in the presence of an equivalent amount of preimmune serum the budding efficiency remained at ∼65%. As a second approach to test for a role for PITP in formation of exocytic vesicles from the TGN, we examined whether PITP was capable of stimulating vesicle formation when the assay was carried out in the presence of limiting concentrations of cytosol. Cytosol titration experiments demonstrated that formation of pIgA-R containing vesicles was linear at cytosol concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 1.25 mg/ml (Fig. 2 A). At higher cytosol concentrations, pIgA-R vesicle formation plateaued at an efficiency of approximately 70%. For subsequent experiments, cytosol was limited to 0.25 mg/ml, a concentration that provides an ∼12% efficiency of pIgA-R vesicle formation, and increasing concentrations of PITP were added. Yeast PITP (Sec14p) was employed because the recombinant protein was quite stable and could be readily purified to homogeneity. Previous studies had demonstrated the interchangability of Sec14p and mammalian PITP in phosphoinositide-dependent systems reconstituted from mammalian cells (5Ohashi, M., Jan de Vries, K., Frank, R., Snoek, G., Bankaitis, V. A., Wirtz, K., and Huttner, W. B. Nature, 377,544–547.Google Scholar, 10Hay J.C. Fisette P.L. Jenkins G.H. Fukami K. Takenawa T. Anderson R.A. Martin T.F.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 12Cunningham E. Tan S.K. Swigart P., J. Hsuan J. Bankaitis V.A. Cockcroft S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6589-6593Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). At the highest concentration of PITP, vesicle formation was restored to an efficiency of approximately 40% (Fig. 2 B). Similarly, supplementation of the budding assay with p62cplx restored vesicle budding to an efficiency of ∼40%. Neither component alone was sufficient to restore the assay to the full budding efficiency of ∼70%. Strikingly, co-addition of PITP and p62cplx elicited a dramatic stimulation in vesicle formation relative to that achieved by addition of either component alone. The co-addition of both components at concentrations that individually restored vesicle budding activity to efficiencies of ∼25% effected a cooperative restoration of vesicle formation to maximal efficiency (∼70%). In summary, antibodies against PITPα specifically inactivated the vesicle formation reaction (Fig. 1). When the cell-free assay is carried out in limiting amounts of cytosol, introduction of either yeast Sec14p or p62cplx -associated PI 3-kinase to the assay stimulated vesicle formation (Fig. 2 B). Importantly, PITP and p62cplx -associated PI 3-kinase synergized to drive pIgA-R vesicle formation to the full efficiency achieved with an optimal amount of cytosol (Fig. 2 B). These data indicate that PITP and p62cplx -associated PI 3-kinase functionally cooperate in the formation of exocytic vesicles from the TGN. The similar wortmannin sensitivities of p62cplx -associated PI 3-kinase activity and vesicle formation from the TGN suggested that PI(3)P formation underlies the p62cplx -associated PI 3-kinase requirement for vesicle formation. If PI 3-kinase activity and PI(3)P production are prerequisites for exocytic vesicle formation, the functional synergy between the p62cplx -associated PI 3-kinase and PITP should extend to PI(3)P production. Moreover, the production of PI(3)P should be stimulated by GTP because activation of the p62-associated small GTPase results in activation of PI 3-kinase activity (2Jones S.M. Howell K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To establish that the mammalian PITPα exhibits the capability to stimulate p62cplx -associated PI 3-kinase activity, recombinant PITPα (in the form of a bacterial high speed supernatant) was added to the immunopurified p62cplx -associated PI 3-kinase. As shown in Fig. 3 A, a bacterial high speed supernatant from E. coli not expressing PITPα sustained only a low level of PI 3-kinase activity. By contrast, addition of bacterial high speed supernatant that contained PITPα supported a 3–5-fold concentration-dependent stimulation of the p62cplx -associated PI 3-kinase activity (Fig. 3 A). This stimulation was amplified further by activation of the 25-kDa GTPase bound to p62 (Fig. 3 B). Whereas p62cplx -associated PI 3-kinase was individually stimulated 3- and 5-fold by a fixed concentration of GTPγS (100 nm) and PITPα, respectively, the simultaneous addition of both reagents resulted in ∼30-fold stimulation (Fig. 3 B). These data revealed a powerful synergy between the GTPase bound to p62 and PITPα in stimulation of the p62cplx -associated PI 3-kinase activity. There are presently two general views for how PITP might stimulate p62cplx -associated PI 3-kinase activity. The “substrate presentation” model posits that PITP acts as a co-factor that presents PI to PI kinases and thereby stimulates the initial rate of the headgroup phosphorylation reaction (11Cunningham E. Thomas G.M. Ball A. Hiles I. Cockcroft S. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 775-783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 12Cunningham E. Tan S.K. Swigart P., J. Hsuan J. Bankaitis V.A. Cockcroft S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6589-6593Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 13Liscovitch M. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 329-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The “lipid transfer” model proposes that PITP merely sustains PI kinase activity by effecting transfer of PI down a chemical gradient that is itself created by depletion of PI by metabolic enzymes such as PI kinases and PI phospholipases (14Currie R.A. MacLeod B.M.G. Downes C.P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 184-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To examine the possibility that PITP presents substrate to the p62cplx -associated PI 3-kinase, PI 3-kinase assays were performed in a membrane-free system using purified Sec14p loaded with either PC (Sec14p-PC) or PI (Sec14p-PI). These experiments allowed the interaction between a lipid kinase and PITP to be examined in a purified system. The source of PI in the kinase assays was limited to that which was stoichiometrically bound to Sec14p (20 μg/ml, and this concentration of PI was an order of magnitude lower than that present in the standard assay (i.e. 200 μg/ml) (Fig. 4 A). Under these assay conditions, the p62cplx -associated PI 3-kinase alone had minimal PI 3-kinase activity. Introduction of Sec14p-PC in the assay reduced that activity to base-line levels. By contrast, Sec14p-PI stimulated the p62cplx -associated activity 5-fold. These data suggest that the p62cplx -associated PI 3-kinase is capable of directly phosphorylating PI directly bound to PITP and that this presentation of PI enhances kinase activity. To further characterize these interactions, additional PI was added to a parallel set of kinase assays to bring the total PI concentration (Sec14p-bound and free) to the levels present in the standard assay (200 μg/ml). A stimulation of PI(3)P formation was observed under all assay conditions (Fig. 4 B). Addition of either Sec14p-PC or Sec14p-PI to the assay increased PI 3-kinase activity 6–7-fold. This stimulatory effect of Sec14p-PC is attributed to its ability to rapidly exchange bound ligand for the excess PI present in the reaction mixture, effectively converting Sec14p-PC to Sec14p-PI during the course of the reaction. Activation of the GTPase bound to p62 provided an additional enhancement of PI 3-kinase activity as measured by PI(3)P production (Fig. 4 C). Sec14p-PI and GTPγS individually stimulated this activity some 4-fold, and co-addition of both Sec14p-PI and GTPγS effected a synergistic 10–12-fold stimulation of the PI 3-kinase activity. The collective data reported herein demonstrate that the p62cplx -associated PI 3-kinase is stimulated both by Sec14p and mammalian PITPα. More dramatically, activation of the small GTPase bound to p62 in the presence of PITPα supported a synergistic activation of the p62cplx -associated PI 3-kinase of up to 30-fold. In addition to activating the generation of PI(3)P, the cooperation of PITPα and the p62cplx -associated PI 3-kinase are essential for pIgA-R vesicle formation from the TGN. We propose that a specific pool of PI93)P is generated “on demand” at the site at which it will be utilized. In this regard, we emphasize that the p62cplx -associated PI 3-kinase assembles with the cytosolic domain of an integral membrane protein of the TGN (TGN38) (2Jones S.M. Howell K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This organization suggests that trans-Golgi proteins (perhaps even cargo proteins) provide positional cues for assembly of this specific PI 3-kinase. There are multiple steps in formation of vesicles from the TGN, and the cell-free assay more than likely measures all of these steps. These include sorting of molecules, tubule formation, and vesicle budding (22Salamero J. Sztul E.S. Howell K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7717-7721Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 25Griffiths G. Simons K. Science. 1986; 234: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 26Ladinsky M.S. Kremer J.R. Furcinitti P.S. McIntosh J.R. Howell K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). We propose that PI(3)P is a key regulatory molecule in the vesicle formation and that its generation may provide signaling molecule required for activation/integration of any one of these steps. Recently others have shown a similar PI 3-kinase activity associated with TGN46, the human orthologue of TGN38 (27Hickinson D.M. Lucocq J.M. Towler M.C. Clough S. James J. James S.R. Downes C.P. Ponnambalam S. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 987-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Those studies failed to reveal either a GTPase or a PITPα-mediated activation of the associated PI 3-kinase activity. Unfortunately, the relevant experiments performed in that study are difficult to evaluate because the specific activities for PI transfer of the PITPα, and the concentrations of GTPγS employed are not provided, so it is difficult to relate these two bodies of work in a meaningful manner. Finally, our data speak to how PITPs might cooperate with PI 3-kinase in exocytic vesicle formation from the TGN. The demonstration that p62cplx -associated PI 3-kinase activity is stimulated when the sole source of PI in the kinase assay was PITP-bound lipid strongly suggests that p62cplx -associated PI 3-kinase is at least capable of utilizing the PI presented by PITP as an effective (and perhaps even optimal) substrate for phosphorylation (Fig. 4 A). These findings are consistent with the notion that the PITP-bound PI pool represents the physiologically relevant substrate for the p62cplx -associated PI 3-kinase. Moreover, the finding that PC-bound PITP was inactive in the stimulation of PI 3-kinase argues against a role for the PC-bound PITP effecting some allosteric stimulation of the kinase. An important caveat to these membrane-free PI 3-kinase experiments is that Sec14p was the source of PITP. Our choice of Sec14p for these studies was driven by its stability and our ability to rapidly purify it to homogeneity. The mammalian PITPα was unstable after purification, which made these experiments impossible. It is important to note that present evidence indicates that the in vivo function of Sec14p is directed at maintaining a pool of Golgi membrane diacylglycerol in a manner that employs converging functions for the PC- and PI-bound forms of Sec14p (8Kearns B.G. McGee T.P. Mayinger P. Gedvilaite A. Phillips S.E. Kagiwada S. Bankaitis V.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). There is no evidence that Sec14p synergizes with a yeast PI 3-kinase in a physiologically relevant way. Nonetheless, both mammalian PITPα and Sec14p behaved similarly in the cell-free assay of pIgA-R vesicle formation from the TGN with regard to synergy with p62cplx -associated PI 3-kinase activity. The synergy observed between the p62cplx -associated PI 3-kinase activity and both mammalian PITPα and Sec14p indicates that a functional interaction between these factors is critical for PI(3)P generation. Further, a spatially and temporally regulated burst of PI(3)P synthesis is a prerequisite for exocytic vesicle formation from the TGN. S. M.

https://openalex.org/W2052624858,"The rate-limiting step for cap-dependent translation initiation in eukaryotes is recruitment of mRNA to the ribosome. An early event in this process is recognition of the m7GTP-containing cap structure at the 5′-end of the mRNA by initiation factor eIF4E. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, mRNAs from 70% of the genes contain a different cap structure, m32,2,7GTP. This cap structure is poorly recognized by mammalian elF4E, suggesting that C. elegansmay possess a specialized form of elF4E that can recognize m32,2,7GTP. Analysis of the C. elegans genomic sequence data base revealed the presence of three elF4E-like genes, here named ife-1, ife-2, and ife-3. cDNAs for these three eIF4E isoforms were cloned and sequenced. Isoform-specific antibodies were prepared from synthetic peptides based on nonhomologous regions of the three proteins. All three eIF4E isoforms were detected in extracts of C. elegans and were retained on m7GTP-Sepharose. One eIF4E isoform, IFE-1, was also retained on m32,2,7GTP-Sepharose. Furthermore, binding of IFE-1 and IFE-2 to m7GTP-Sepharose was inhibited by m32,2,7GTP. These results suggest that IFE-1 and IFE-2 bind both m7GTP- and m32,2,7GTP-containing mRNA cap structures, although with different affinities.

In conjunction with IFE-3, these eIF4E isoforms would permit cap-dependent recruitment of all C. elegans mRNAs to the ribosome. All eukaryotic cytosolic mRNAs and many eukaryotic viral mRNAs contain a 5′-terminal capping group (1Shatkin A.J. Cell. 1976; 9: 645-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). The most commonly occurring cap structures contain 7-methylguanosine in a 5′-to-5′ triphosphate linkage to the first transcribed nucleotide residue, which is often 2′-O-methylated as well. The presence of a cap on mRNA stimulates translation as well as stabilizes the mRNA against degradation. The former of these effects is thought to be mediated by the binding of a 25-kDa initiation factor, eIF4E (eukaryotic initiation factor 4E), to the cap (2Rhoads R.E. Joshi-Barve S. Rinker-Schaeffer C. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 46: 183-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). eIF4E is a member of the eIF4 class of initiation factors, which also includes eIF4A, eIF4B, and eIF4G; collectively these factors recruit mRNA to the 43 S initiation complex and melt mRNA secondary structure (3Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 31-69Google Scholar).

Cell. 1997; 89: 951-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) and yeast (11Matsuo H. Li H. McGuire A.M. Fletcher C.M. Gingras A.-C. Sonenberg N. Wagner G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). In plants, there are at least two eIF4E isoforms, termed eIF4E and eIF(iso)4E (12Allen M.L. Metz A.M. Timmer R.T. Rhoads R.E. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23232-23236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Metz A.M. Timmer R.T. Browning K.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4096Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); the former is expressed in most tissues, whereas the latter is expressed only in floral organs and developing tissues (9Rodriguez C.M. Freire M.A. Camilleri C. Robaglia C. Plant J. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). eIF4E is regulated by at least three processes. First, the phosphorylation of eIF4E correlates positively with the rate of translation in a large number of systems (4Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3017-3020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and increases the affinity of the protein for cap analogues 3–4-fold (14Minich W.B. Balasta M.L. Goss D.J. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7668-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Second, eIF4E availability is regulated by eIF4E-binding proteins, the phosphorylation of which, in response to insulin and other mitogens, releases them from eIF4E and permits eIF4E binding to eIF4G (15Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translation Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 245-269Google Scholar). Third, eIF4E levels are regulated at the transcriptional level (16Rosenwald I.B. Rhoads D.B. Callanan L.D. Isselbacher K.J. Schmidt E.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6175-6178Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Changes in the intracellular levels of eIF4E have a profound effect on cellular growth control. Ectopic overexpression of eIF4E leads to accelerated cell growth, transformation in culture and tumorigenesis in nude mice, prevention of apoptosis in growth factor-restricted fibroblasts, and elevated intracellular levels of growth-regulated proteins such as cyclin D1, c-Myc, ornithine decarboxylase, ornithine aminotransferase, P23, vascular endothelial growth factor, and fibroblast growth factor-2 (reviewed in Ref. 17Kevil C. Carter P. Hu B. De Benedetti A. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2339-2348PubMed Google Scholar). Reduction in intracellular eIF4E levels by expression of antisense RNA results in phenotypic reversal of ras-transformed fibroblasts (18Rinker-Schaeffer C.W. Graff J.R. De Benedetti A. Zimmer S.G. Rhoads R.E. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 55: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). eIF4E mRNA levels are also elevated in a variety of cells that have been oncogenically transformed by in vivo transfection, viral infection, or chemical mutagenesis (19Miyagi Y. Sugiyama A. Asai A. Okazaki T. Kuchino Y. Kerr J. Cancer Lett. 1995; 91: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and naturally occurring breast and head-and-neck tumors express elevated levels of eIF4E (Ref.20Nathan C.A. Liu L. Li B. Abreo F. De Benedetti A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar and references therein). The structural requirements for recognition of the cap by mammalian and plant eIF4E have been determined by inhibition of in vitrotranslation by cap analogs, quenching of tryptophan fluorescence in eIF4E by cap analogs, and translation of mRNAs synthesized with modified cap structures (reviewed in Ref. 2Rhoads R.E. Joshi-Barve S. Rinker-Schaeffer C. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 46: 183-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Binding requires the presence of the 7-methyl group, but changing the substituent at N7 to an aromatic group increases binding affinity. Addition of one methyl group at the N2 position of guanine has little effect on binding, but addition of a second methyl group (m32,2,7GTP; Scheme FS1) drastically decreases it (21Darzynkiewicz E.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1624-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), presumably due to the loss of the H-bond between the N2 of m7G and Glu-103 of eIF4E (10Marcotrigiano J. Gingras A.-C. Sonenberg N. Burley S.K. Cell. 1997; 89: 951-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Most nematode mRNAs have a 22-nucleotide trans-spliced leader sequence at their 5′-ends (24Blaxter M. Liu L. Int. J. Parasit. 1996; 26: 1025-1033PubMed Google Scholar, 25Maroney P.A. Denker J.A. Darzynkiewicz E. Laneve R. Nilsen T.W. RNA. 1995; 1: 714-723PubMed Google Scholar). In Caenorhabditis elegans, a number of different spliced leaders have been described (26Ross L.H. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22066-22075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and mRNAs from ∼70% of the genes contain a spliced leader (27Zorio D.A.R. Cheng N.S.N. Blumenthal T. Spieth J. Nature. 1994; 372: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Trans-splicing results in an mRNA with an m32,2,7GTP-containing cap structure (28Liou R.F. Blumenthal T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1764-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 29van Doren K. Hirsh D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1769-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although the effect of the trimethyl cap on translational efficiency in C. elegans has not been studied, trans-splicing enhances the translational efficiency of mRNAs in the parasitic nematode Ascaris (25Maroney P.A. Denker J.A. Darzynkiewicz E. Laneve R. Nilsen T.W. RNA. 1995; 1: 714-723PubMed Google Scholar). This increase reflects synergistic effects of both the spliced leader and the m32,2,7GTP-containing cap. The inability of eIF4E from the species studied to date to bind m32,2,7GTP-containing caps contrasts with the fact that most mRNAs of C. elegans contain such caps, suggesting that eIF4E from C. elegans may differ qualitatively from that of other species. We therefore set out to isolate eIF4E from C. elegans to determine its properties. Surprisingly, we found multiple eIF4E isoforms. Moreover, the different types varied in their abilities to recognize m7GTP and m32,2,7GTP.

The following peptides (derived from C. elegans eIF4E sequences but with an additional N-terminal Cys residue) were synthesized by Biosynthesis (Dallas, TX) and used to generate isoform-specific antibodies for IFE-1, -2, and -3, respectively: CLSLHSSDAPVAEKS, CKHAIYAVEPREEK, and CPRICLPAKDPAPVK. The following oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. and termed Primers 1–8, respectively: CGAACCGGATCCATGACTGAAACGGA, GAGGGACGCAAGCTTAGACGGCGGATTTCTCG, TCCGAGGATCCAGTCGCAGCTCC, AAGAAAGCTTAGTGGCTGGTGTGGCAGG, GAAACCATGGGCACATCCGTAGCGGAA, TGGTGAGATCTCGAGAATATGCTTAAGGAG, CTGCCAGAAGAAGAAGACCAGCTC, and CCATCTCGAGAGCTGGCAACCAC. The plasmid pET32A and the S-Protein:bacterial alkaline phosphatase conjugate were purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI). DNA sequencing was performed at the Iowa State University Sequencing Facility. m7GTP was synthesized by methylation of GTP (30Darzynkiewicz E. Ekiel I. Tahara S.M. Seliger L.S. Shatkin A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1701-1707Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). m32,2,7GTP was obtained in a multi-step synthesis from 5-amino-1-β-Dribofuranosyl-4-imidazolecarboxamide (31Jankowska M. Temeriusz A. Stolarski R. Darzynkiewicz E. Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun. 1993; 58: 132-135Crossref Google Scholar). The affinity chromatography resins m7GTP-Sepharose and m32,2,7GTP-Sepharose were synthesized as described previously (32Webb N.R. Chari R.V.J. DePillis G. Kozarich J.W. Rhoads R.E. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) with modifications (31Jankowska M. Temeriusz A. Stolarski R. Darzynkiewicz E. Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun. 1993; 58: 132-135Crossref Google Scholar). C. eleganswild type strain N2 var. Bristol was cultured (33Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and maintained on Petri plates containing nematode growth medium agar and Escherichia coli strain OP50 (34Sulston J. Hodgkin J. Wood W.B. the Community of C. elegans Researchers The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 587-606Google Scholar). Large quantities of C. elegans were grown on plates supplemented with chicken egg yolk (35McDermott J.B. Aamodt S. Aamodt E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9415-9423Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Animals were harvested, cleaned by one or more rounds of sucrose flotation (34Sulston J. Hodgkin J. Wood W.B. the Community of C. elegans Researchers The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 587-606Google Scholar), pelleted, resuspended in an equal volume of water, and drop-frozen in liquid N2. Frozen tissue was crushed with a mortar and pestle under liquid N2 and thawed in the presence of buffer components and inhibitors to achieve the following final concentrations: 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 80 μg/ml each leupeptin and pepstatin, 10 μg/ml E-64, 1 mg/ml TAME, 50 mm NaF, and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate. Homogenates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant solutions were immediately applied to affinity chromatography columns. C. elegans extracts (10–20 ml) were applied to 0.2-ml columns of m7GTP-Sepharose or m32,2,7GTP-Sepharose equilibrated in buffer A (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol), and the flow-through fraction was collected. Columns were washed with 10 ml of buffer A followed by 10 ml of buffer A containing 100 μm GTP. Proteins were eluted with 2 ml of buffer A containing either 100 μm m7GTP or m32,2,7GTP (depending on the column matrix), and 0.2-ml fractions were collected. All of the predicted protein sequences were first identified in the genomic sequences generated by the C. elegans Genome Sequencing Consortium (36Wilson R. Ainscough R. Anderson K. Baynes C. Berks C. Burton J. Connell M. Bonfield J. Copsey T. Cooper J. Nature. 1994; 368: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). The TBLASTN algorithm (37Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71363) Google Scholar) run on the Washington University Genome Sequencing Center server 2The website is www.genome.wustl.edu/gsc/blast/blast_servers.html. was used to identify sequences that encode proteins with homology to human eIF4E. Expressed sequence tags from each of the C. elegans eIF4Es were identified with the C. elegans EST data base BLAST server at the DNA Data Bank of Japan. 3The website is www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/c-elegans/html/CE_BLAST.html. The coding sequences of IFE-1, IFE-2, and IFE-3 were amplified from total C. elegans cDNA (35McDermott J.B. Aamodt S. Aamodt E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9415-9423Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) by PCR using Primers 1 and 2, 3 and 4, or 5 and 6, respectively. The products were subcloned into the BamHI/HindIII,BglII/HindIII, or NcoI/XhoI sites of pET32A to generate the vectors pTSIFE-1, pTSIFE-2, and pTSIFE-3, respectively. The last 48 bp of the IFE-1 coding region were lost during subcloning due to the presence of a HindIII site located upstream of the 3′ PCR primer site. Because this region of the gene does not contain intron sequences, genomic DNA was used as template for amplification of this portion of the coding sequence using Primers 7 and 8. The resulting product, containing the missing 48 bp plus an additional 752 bp, was subcloned into the HindIII/XhoI sites of pTSIFE-1 to create pTSIFE-1+. The constructs expressed eIF4E isoforms containing an N-terminal addition consisting of thioredoxin, an S-peptide sequence, and a His6-tag. C. elegans eIF4E cDNAs were also kindly provided by the Yuji Kuhara laboratory (Japan) as λ Zap clones corresponding to expressed sequence tags for IFE-1 (yk364a1), IFE-2 (yk452e8), and IFE-3 (yk81f11). All cDNA constructs were sequenced and compared with genomic sequences to determine intron/exon boundaries. Two discrepancies were observed. First, a 9-nucleotide insertion was present in the IFE-3 coding region of yk81f11 but not pTSIFE-3, resulting in the addition of Lys-Leu-Gln between Gln-115 and Arg-116; this may represent an alternatively spliced form of IFE-3 mRNA. Second, a single nucleotide change was observed in pTSIFE-2 compared with yk452e8 and genomic DNA, resulting in Pro-114 instead of Leu-114. This likely represents a PCR-induced mutation. Expression of recombinant C. elegans eIF4E isoforms was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h in 1-liter cultures of E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (38Lamphear B.J. Rhoads R.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15726-15733Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) bearing plasmids pTSIFE-1+, pTSIFE-2, or pTSIFE-3. Cells were cooled in an ice water bath, pelleted by centrifugation, and stored at −70 °C. Cells were thawed in the presence of buffer B (25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and one Complete™ Protease Inhibitor tablet/25 ml) and lysed by sonication (3–6 bursts of 10 s each). The 28,000 × g supernatant was incubated with 300 μl of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose with slow rotation for 2 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed with buffer B until the A 280 nm of the supernatant was below 0.01. The resin was then washed with 10 ml of buffer B containing 40 mm imidazole, and fusion proteins were eluted with five column volumes of buffer B containing 100 mm imidazole. Preparation of anti-peptide antibodies and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (39Lamphear B.J. Kirchweger R. Skern T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21975-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Antibodies were purified on columns of Affi-Gel 501 to which each synthetic peptide was linked via the Cys residue (40Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). m7GTP- and m32,2,7GTP-Sepharose affinity chromatography resins were synthesized to determine whether eIF4E from C. elegans recognizes mono- or trimethylated cap structures. Extracts from C. elegans were prepared under conditions that in other systems preserve cap binding activity and minimize proteolysis and dephosphorylation of proteins. The eluate from the m7GTP-Sepharose column consisted of a complicated pattern of proteins ranging from ∼20 to 200 kDa, the most intensely staining of which migrated between 26 and 40 kDa (Fig. 1 A, lanes 5–7). These bands represent proteins that were specifically retained on m7GTP-Sepharose, because they were not eluted by the GTP wash (Fig. 1 A, lane 4). This complex pattern of proteins is similar to that observed with extracts from higher eukaryotes (Ref. 41Lamphear B.J. Panniers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5333-5336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and references therein), for which it has been shown that the major band represents eIF4E, whereas the others represent initiation factors that specifically associate with eIF4E (i.e. eIF4G, eIF4A, eIF3, eIF4B, and eIF4E-binding proteins). Chromatography on m32,2,7GTP-Sepharose produced a simpler collection of retained proteins, with bands at 26 and 37 kDa predominating (Fig. 1 B, lanes 5–7). Inclusion of GTP in the extract reduced the amount of the 37-kDa band relative to the 26-kDa band (Fig. 1 C), suggesting that the former protein is nonspecifically retained. The 26-kDa band from m7GTP-Sepharose co-migrated with the major protein retained on m32,2,7GTP-Sepharose (data not shown). The slower migrating proteins (Fig. 1, B and C) appear to correspond in molecular mass to a subset of the proteins retained on m7GTP-Sepharose (Fig. 1 A) and are presumed to be eIF4E-associated initiation factors. These results indicate, based on molecular mass and retention on affinity columns, that there are several candidates for C. elegans eIF4E. Three genes (hereby named ife-1,ife-2, and ife-3) that encode proteins with strong homology to human eIF4E were identified in sequences generated by the C. elegans Genome Sequencing Consortium (36Wilson R. Ainscough R. Anderson K. Baynes C. Berks C. Burton J. Connell M. Bonfield J. Copsey T. Cooper J. Nature. 1994; 368: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). cDNAs corresponding to each of the C. elegans ife genes were cloned and sequenced. The calculated molecular masses of the predicted eIF4E proteins, IFE-1, IFE-2, and IFE-3 (Fig. 2 A), were 24.3, 25.7, and 27.8 kDa, respectively. Each of the IFE proteins showed strong homology to human eIF4E and to each other (Fig. 2 B). Specific antisera were generated to distinguish between the various eIF4E isoforms. Peptides corresponding to sequences located in the nonhomologous C-terminal portion of the proteins (Fig. 2 A, boldface) were synthesized and used for generation and purification of antibodies. To test the specificity of the antibodies, the cDNAs for IFE-1, IFE-2, and IFE-3 were cloned into a bacterial vector and expressed as fusion proteins (rIFE-1, -2, and -3). When the mass of the N-terminal extension is taken into account, these recombinant proteins migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as expected (Fig. 3 A). Each anti-peptide antibody recognized only the corresponding isoform of eIF4E when tested against the purified recombinant proteins (Fig. 3, B–D). The protein band migrating below rIFE-2 (arrow) likely represents a truncated form of rIFE-2 because it contains the N-terminal S-peptide (data not shown) but lacks the C-terminal IFE-2 epitope. To determine if any of the proteins that were retained on m7GTP- or m32,2,7GTP-Sepharose (Fig. 1) included IFE-1, -2, or -3, eluates of affinity columns were subjected to immunoblotting with isoform-specific antibodies. All three isoforms were detected in the eluate from m7GTP-Sepharose (Figs. 3, E–H, lanes 1). The major bands at 26 and 31 kDa correspond to IFE-1 and IFE-3, respectively. IFE-2, on the other hand, corresponds to a minor band migrating at 28 kDa; it is often undetectable by silver or Coomassie staining but is readily detectable by immunoblotting. The 26-kDa protein retained on m32,2,7GTP-Sepharose (Fig. 3 E,lane 2) was recognized by the anti-IFE-1 antibody (Fig. 3 F, lane 2), indicating that IFE-1 can bind both m7GTP- and m32,2,7GTP-Sepharose. However, neither IFE-2 nor IFE-3 was retained on m32,2,7GTP-Sepharose (Fig. 3, G and H, lanes 2). Anti-IFE-1 antibody appeared to recognize a single protein species (Fig. 3 F), but anti-IFE-2 and anti-IFE-3 antibodies appeared to recognize closely spaced doublets (Fig. 3, G and H). This may reflect post-translational modification or alternatively spliced forms of IFE-2 and -3. The cap-binding specificities of the eIF4E isoforms were further characterized with cap analogs to compete for binding to affinity columns (Fig. 4). Extracts were applied to m7GTP- or m32,2,7GTP-Sepharose in the presence of m7GTP or m32,2,7GTP as competitors. No proteins were retained on m7GTP-Sepharose when m7GTP was used as competitor (Fig. 4, A and C, lanes 2 versus lanes 1), nor were any proteins retained on m32,2,7GTP-Sepharose when m32,2,7GTP was used as competitor (Fig. 4,B and D, lanes 3 versus lanes 1). Surprisingly, when m32,2,7GTP was used as a competitor during m7GTP-Sepharose chromatography, retention of both IFE-1 and IFE-2 was prevented, whereas binding of IFE-3 was unaffected (Fig. 4 C, lane 3 versus 1). Similarly, when m7GTP was used as competitor with a m32,2,7GTP-Sepharose column, IFE-1 was not retained (Fig. 4, B and D, lanes 2 versus 1). The fact that binding of IFE-1 to either resin was competed by either cap analog indicates that IFE-1 recognizes both cap structures through the same binding site. The unexpected finding that IFE-2 apparently recognizes m32,2,7GTP (Fig. 4 C, lane 3 versus 1) but is not retained on m32,2,7GTP-Sepharose (Fig. 3 G,lane 2) suggests that it has an intermediate binding affinity: strong enough to allow m32,2,7GTP to serve as competitor but too weak to allow retention on an affinity resin. Alternatively, IFE-2 may be hindered in its interaction with immobilized m32,2,7GTP but not with the free nucleotide. However, the most likely interpretation at present is that C. elegans eIF4E isoforms have differential affinities for the trimethyl cap structure, the relative order being IFE-1 > IFE-2 ≫ IFE-3. This order of affinity is inversely correlated with the relative homologies to human eIF4E, which recognizes only m7GTP (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, the two C. elegans isoforms that recognize m32,2,7GTP are more similar to each other than to IFE-3 (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, the m32,2,7GTP-binding isoforms contain an extra amino acid stretch (amino acid 164–170 in IFE-1; see Fig. 2 A) as well as an additional Trp residue (amino acids 20 in IFE-1); these may account for the difference in nucleotide-binding specificity. It is not clear why multiple IFE isoforms are present in C. elegans. It is interesting that in this organism roughly 70% of mature mRNAs contain trimethylated, trans-spliced leaders. This presents a unique situation with respect to recruitment of mRNA for translation. There is the potential for differential selection of mRNAs depending on the nature of the cap: mono- versustrimethylated. Furthermore, because the sequence of an mRNA adjacent to the cap can have a profound effect on its association with eIF4E and recruitment to the translational apparatus (42Carberry S.E. Friedland D.E. Rhoads R.E. Goss D.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1427-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), there is also the potential for recruitment of classes of mRNAs based on a common splice leader sequence (SL1 versus SL2) by altering levels and/or activities of specific eIF4E isoforms. Determination of the temporal and cell-specific expression of IFE isoforms may provide useful information on the role of cap binding proteins in translation and in the development of the organism. We are grateful to Yuji Kuhara for providing C. elegans cDNAs, Kim Depper for growing and harvesting C. elegans, and the C. elegans Genome Sequencing Consortium for making genomic sequences available."
https://openalex.org/W2074328584,"Previously we showed that rat mesangial cells are normally resistant to tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced apoptosis. They are made susceptible to the apoptotic effect of TNF-α when pretreated with actinomycin D, cycloheximide or vanadate. A sustained c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) activation was closely correlated with the initiation of apoptosis under these conditions. We proposed that a TNF-α-inducible phosphatase was responsible for preventing a sustained activation of JNK and consequent apoptosis in these cells (Guo, Y.-L., Baysal, K., Kang, B., Yang, L.-J., and Williamson, J. R. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 4027–4034). In the present study we provide further evidence to support this hypothesis. Ro318220, although originally identified as a specific inhibitor of protein kinase C, was subsequently found to be a strong inhibitor of MKP-1 expression. In rat mesangial cells, pretreatment of the cells with Ro318220 blocked expression of MKP-1 induced by TNF-α. This treatment also prolonged JNK activation and caused apoptosis. Taken together, our results support the currently controversial hypothesis that the JNK pathway is involved in TNF-α-induced apoptosis. In addition, we provide a mechanistic explanation for how mesangial cells in primary culture achieve resistance to TNF-α cytotoxicity. Specifically, induction of MKP-1 by TNF-α appears to be responsible for protection of the cells from apoptosis by preventing a prolonged activation of JNK.

Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) 1The abbreviations used are: TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase; MKP, mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase(s); PKC, protein kinase C; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; GST, glutathione S-transferase. is a polypeptide cytokine that can elicit a wide range of biological responses depending on the cell type and their state of differentiation (1Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar, 2Beyaert R. Fiers W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). One of these responses is the induction of apoptosis or programmed cell death in some cell types (3Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4561) Google Scholar). Although certain tumor cells infected with virus or damaged cells are sensitive to TNF-α-induced apoptosis, many normal cells are usually resistant (3Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4561) Google Scholar, 4Leist M. Gantner F. Bohlinger I. Germann P.G. Tiegs G. Wendel A. J.

Science. 1985; 230: 943-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). Thus apoptosis has been considered to be an important mechanism for the elimination of abnormal cells and for cellular organization during tissue development. Most resistant cells can be rendered susceptible to TNF-α-induced apoptosis by agents that block the synthesis of mRNA or protein. Thus, it is proposed that normal cells can achieve resistance to TNF-α cytotoxicity by eliciting the synthesis of a protective factor (6Baichwal V.R. Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 94-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar). However, the identities of such protective factors and the mechanisms by which they exert their anti-apoptotic effects are poorly understood. Recent advances in this area have led to some hypotheses. It is proposed that TNF-α activates an anti-apoptotic signaling pathway, such as the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) pathway, which counteracts the cytotoxicity of the apoptotic pathway (8Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5043) Google Scholar). For example, in L929 cells, fibroblast growth factor-2 suppressed TNF-α-induced apoptosis by activation of ERK, and this effect could be reversed by inhibition of the ERK pathway (9Gardner A.M. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14560-14566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Another hypothesis favored by recent evidence is that activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) may be required to protect cells from TNF-α-induced apoptosis in certain cells (6Baichwal V.R. Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 94-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M.

Increasing evidence indicates that some members of BCL2 family of proteins have inhibitory actions against apoptosis induced by a number of stress signals including TNF-α, probably by blocking caspase activities (3Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4561) Google Scholar). Given the complexity of TNF-α signaling pathways, it is apparent that different protective factors may exert their anti-apoptotic effects through different mechanisms and act at the different stages of the apoptotic process. The identities and mechanisms of action of the regulatory factors in TNF-α signaling pathways clearly require further investigation under specific cellular conditions. The role of the JNK pathway has been well documented in various stress-induced models of apoptosis (11Chen Y.-R. Wang X. Templeton D. Davis R.J. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31929-31936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 12Butterfield L. Storey B. Maas L. Heasley L.E. J. Biol.

Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 606-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). However, its involvement in TNF-α-induced apoptosis has been controversial. In a previous report (14Guo Y.-L. Baysal K. Kang B. Yang L.-J. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4027-4034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), we established a close correlation between the duration of JNK activation and TNF-α-induced apoptosis in rat mesangial cells. We proposed that the JNK pathway is involved in TNF-α-induced apoptosis under conditions that JNK is activated in a sustained manner and that a TNF-α-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) may be responsible for an attenuated JNK activation, thereby protecting the cells from apoptosis under normal conditions. MKP are responsible for inactivation of mitogen-activated protein kinases in different cells (15Keyse S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1265: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and some MKP are inducible by various stresses that activate JNK (16Liu Y. Gorospe M. Yang C. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8377-8380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 17Bokemeyer D. Sorokin A. Yan M. Ahn N.G. Templeton D.J. Dunn M.J. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27205-27208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The duration of JNK activation could thus be regulated by MKP through a feedback mechanism. Therefore, induction of MKP to inactivate JNK was thought to protect the cells against stress-caused damage in these cells (15Keyse S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1265: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 16Liu Y. Gorospe M. Yang C. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 639-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Recently, we proposed that the TNF-α-inducible MKP-1 may play a similar role in protecting mesangial cells from TNF-α cytotoxicity (14Guo Y.-L. Baysal K. Kang B. Yang L.-J. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4027-4034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The current study presents additional evidence to support our hypothesis. In rat mesangial cells, when the expression of MKP-1 induced by TNF-α was selectively blocked by pretreatment of the cells with Ro318220, it produced results that resembled the effects of the protein phosphatase inhibitor vanadate in prolonging JNK activation and inducing apoptosis by TNF-α. Ro318220 selectively blocked expression of MKP-1 without inhibiting the TNF-α stimulated activation of ERK and NF-κB. These results further strengthen our previous conclusion that although TNF-α caused a stimulation of ERK and NF-κB activation, they probably did not contribute to the protective effect against TNF-α-induced apoptosis in mesangial cells. Our studies strongly support the currently controversial hypothesis that the JNK pathway is involved in TNF-α-induced apoptosis. We also provide a novel hypothesis to explain the resistance to TNF-α cytotoxicity in mesangial cells. Recombinant TNF-α was obtained from Chemicon International Inc. (Temecula, CA). Anti-c-Fos antibodies and anti-MKP-1 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phospho-c-Jun (Ser 63), anti-c-Jun antibodies were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Anti-phospho-ERK was from Promega (Madison, WI). Ro318220 was from LC Laboratories (San Diego, CA). The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay kit was from Boehringer Mannheim. Rat mesangial cells were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats under sterile conditions using the sieving technique as described previously (19Kreisberg J.I. Hoover R.L. Karnovsky M.J. Kidney Int. 1978; 14: 21-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 20% fetal calf serum, 0.6 unit/ml of insulin at 37 °C in a humidified incubator (5% CO2, 95% air). Cells from 5–20 passages were used. After the cells were grown to 80–90% confluence, they were made quiescent by incubation for 16–18 h in insulin-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 2% fetal calf serum. For cell viability assays, mesangial cells were grown in 12-well plates. The quiescent cells were treated with reagents for the indicated times. Uptake of neutral red dye was used as a measurement of cell viability (20Skehan P. Cell Growth and Apoptosis: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1995: 179-180Google Scholar). At the end of the incubations, the medium was removed, and the cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% fetal calf serum and 0.001% neutral red for 90 min at 37 °C. The uptake of the dye by viable cells was terminated by removal of the medium, washing the cells briefly with 1 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and solubilizing the internalized dye with 1 ml of a solution containing 50% ethanol and 1% glacial acetic acid. The absorbencies, which correlate with the amount of live cells, were determined at 540 nm. Cells grown on 25-mm glass coverslips in 6-well plates were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, after treatment with various reagents as indicated. DNA strand breaks were identified using a TUNEL assay kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Briefly, the fixed cells were treated with terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase, which incorporates fluorescein tagged nucleotides onto 3′-OH termini of fragmented DNA. Apoptotic nuclei were identified under a fluorescence microscope. Phosphorylation of c-Jun was detected with anti-phospho-c-Jun (Ser 63) antibodies following the immunocytochemistry protocol provided by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). Positive stained nuclei were visualized with Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies using fluorescence microscopy. The quiescent cells were treated with reagents for the indicated times, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and scraped into cell lysis buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mmpyrophosphate, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were incubated in lysis buffer for 30 min on ice with periodic vortexing and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was designated as the cell lysate. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as standard (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217370) Google Scholar). JNK activity was measured using a solid phase kinase assay method. GST-c-Jun (1–79) (GST-Jun) fusion protein was isolated from bacterial cells expressing pGEX-c-Jun plasmid. JNK activity was determined using GST-Jun as substrate as described previously (14Guo Y.-L. Baysal K. Kang B. Yang L.-J. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4027-4034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μg of cell lysate was incubated with 2 μg of GST-Jun agarose beads at 4 °C for 2 h with rotation and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 1 min. The beads were washed three times with washing buffer (25 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm β-glycerolphosphate, and 10 mm NaF). The beads were then resuspended in 10 μl of kinase buffer containing (final concentrations) 20 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmNa3VO4, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 40 μm ATP, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After incubation at room temperature for 20 min, the reaction was terminated by adding SDS sample buffer followed by heating at 100 °C for 3 min. The proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the phosphorylated proteins were detected by autoradiography. ERK activation was determined by Western blot analysis using anti-ERK antibodies that only recognize phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 (14Guo Y.-L. Baysal K. Kang B. Yang L.-J. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4027-4034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The protein samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered-saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with primary antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies according to the manufacturer's instructions. The immunoblots were visualized by an ECL kit obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Total RNA was isolated from mesangial cells using TRI-reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc.) as recommended by the manufacturer. Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (22Peng M. Huang L. Xie Z. Huang W.-H. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10372-10378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The HindIII/BamHI fragment of pCEP4-MKP-1 plasmid was used as a probe. MKP-1 is a well characterized member of MKP family that has been shown to be able to inactivate JNK in vitro and in vivo(16Liu Y. Gorospe M. Yang C. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8377-8380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 17Bokemeyer D. Sorokin A. Yan M. Ahn N.G. Templeton D.J. Dunn M.J. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27205-27208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Our previous results showed that MKP-1 mRNA was strongly induced by TNF-α at the same time as JNK inactivation in mesangial cells (14Guo Y.-L. Baysal K. Kang B. Yang L.-J. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4027-4034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Beltman et al. (23Beltman J. McCormick F. Cook S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27018-27024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) reported that Ro318220, which was originally identified as a specific inhibitor of protein kinase C (24Wilkinson S.E. Parker P.J. Nixon J.S. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 335-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), was a strong inhibitor of MKP-1 expression in Rat-1 fibroblasts. To test if it has the same effect on rat mesangial cells, the cells were pretreated with Ro318220 prior to stimulation with TNF-α. As shown in Fig. 1, the expression of MKP-1 induced by TNF-α was totally abolished by pretreatment of the cells with Ro318220, as demonstrated by the Northern blot (Fig. 1 A) and the Western blot (Fig. 1 B). These results confirm that TNF-α is able to induce de novo synthesis of MKP-1 in rat mesangial cells. The effect of Ro318220 in inhibiting the expression of MKP-1 in mesangial cells is consistent with that observed in Rat-1 cells (23Beltman J. McCormick F. Cook S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27018-27024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). If MKP-1 is responsible for inactivation of JNK as we propose, one would expect that JNK activation induced by TNF-α would be prolonged by blocking the induction of MKP-1. As shown in Fig. 2 A, pretreatment of mesangial cells with Ro318220 followed by TNF-α stimulation caused a sustained JNK activation. The effect of Ro318220 on JNK activation is similar to that of the phosphatase inhibitor vanadate as reported previously (14Guo Y.-L. Baysal K. Kang B. Yang L.-J. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4027-4034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This result is consistent with the ability of Ro318220 to inhibit the induction of MKP-1 expression induced by TNF-α (Fig. 1) and confirms our prediction that MKP-1 can inactivate JNK in vivo. It is also noted that unlike the situation in Rat-1 cells, where Ro318220 itself is a strong activator of JNK (23Beltman J. McCormick F. Cook S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27018-27024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), Ro318220 by itself only slightly activated JNK in mesangial cells (Fig. 2 A). This response is unlike vanadate, which indiscriminately inhibited all tyrosine phosphatases and caused similar sustained activation patterns for both JNK and ERK in cells pretreated with vanadate followed by TNF-α stimulation (14Guo Y.-L. Baysal K. Kang B. Yang L.-J. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4027-4034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of mesangial cells with Ro318220 also potentiated ERK activity, but the major effect was to cause a second activity peak after 2–3 h (Fig. 2 B). The reason for the different effects of Ro318220 on JNK and ERK is currently unknown, but it is possible that Ro318220 selectively inhibits the expression of different members of MKP family that may differentially regulate JNK and ERK dephosphorylation and thus their activity. It is possible, therefore, that other members of MKP family may also be involved in the regulation of ERK, in addition to MKP-1 in TNF-α signaling pathways in mesangial cells. It is generally recognized that the JNK and ERK pathways are involved in regulation of the activity and expression of c-Fos and c-Jun (25Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar). To test for a possible downstream effect of Ro318220, the expression of c-Jun and c-Fos was examined (Fig. 3). TNF-α stimulated the expression of both c-Jun (Fig. 3 A) and c-Fos (Fig. 3 B) with a stronger effect being observed on c-Fos as judged by Western blot analysis. Pretreatment of the cells with Ro318220 had little effect on TNF-α-induced expression of c-Jun (Fig. 3 A), but surprisingly, the TNF-α-induced expression of c-Fos was totally abrogated (Fig. 3 B). Ro318220 alone had no apparent stimulatory effect on either c-Jun or c-Fos expression. The most significant effect of Ro318220 on c-Jun was to potentiate its phosphorylation induced by TNF-α (Fig. 3 C). This observation is consistent with its ability to sustain JNK activation (Fig. 2 A). Although phospho-c-Jun was detectable only at 15 min when cells were stimulated with TNF-α alone, the phosphorylation state of c-Jun lasted for at least 3 h when the cells were treated with a combination of Ro318220 and TNF-α (Fig. 3 C). This sustained c-Jun phosphorylation was nearly identical to the pattern caused by pretreatment with vanadate (14Guo Y.-L. Baysal K. Kang B. Yang L.-J. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4027-4034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of c-Jun was further examined using immunocytochemical analysis in situ. Mesangial cells were pretreated with Ro318220 followed by stimulation with TNF-α. At the end of 3 h of incubation, about 50% of the cells were positively stained with anti-phospho-c-Jun antibodies (Fig. 4 D), whereas cells treated with TNF-α alone (Fig. 4 B) or Ro318220 alone (Fig. 4 C) did not result in detectable phospho-c-Jun stained nuclei compared with control cells, which were not treated with any agent (Fig. 4 A). Results obtained thus far from experiments with Ro318220 on JNK activity and c-Jun phosphorylation stimulated by TNF-α are very similar to those obtained from vanadate experiments as described previously (14Guo Y.-L. Baysal K. Kang B. Yang L.-J. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4027-4034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). To test if Ro318220 could produce a similar effect on cell viability as that caused by vanadate, the effect of Ro318220 on the viability of mesangial cells in the presence of TNF-α was examined. As shown in Fig. 5, mesangial cells were essentially insensitive to TNF-α cytotoxicity when treated with TNF-α alone. However, when the cells were pretreated with Ro318220, the effect of TNF-α on cell viability was dramatic. Within 4 h of incubation after addition of TNF-α, about 80% of cells were dead, whereas with Ro318220 alone only a slight cellular toxic effect was observed after the same incubation time (Fig. 5). This result is similar to that observed for vanadate potentiation of TNF-α-induced cell death under the same experimental conditions (14Guo Y.-L. Baysal K. Kang B. Yang L.-J. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4027-4034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). However, unlike vanadate, Ro318220 showed a much less severe cytotoxicity by itself. The effect of Ro318220 to potentiate TNF-α cytotoxicity was dose-dependent; it was evident at a concentration of 2.5 μm and reached a maximum at 15 μm for a 4-h incubation period (data not shown). Cell death resulting from incubation with Ro318220 and TNF-α showed typical morphological characteristics of apoptosis as examined by light microscopy and further determined by the TUNEL analysis. At the end of 3 h of incubation, about 40% of the cells still attached to the coverslip were TUNEL-stained positive when the cells were treated with a combination of Ro318220 and TNF-α (Fig. 6 D), whereas less than 5% of the cells were TUNEL-staining positive after treatment with TNF-α or Ro318220 alone (Fig. 6, B and C). This value is close to that in the control experiment (Fig. 6 A). Under the same experimental conditions, the number of the nuclei that were shown to be undergoing apoptosis (Fig. 6 D) was similar to the number of nuclei stained by phospho-c-Jun antibodies (Fig. 4 D). Many TUNEL-stained nuclei and phospho-c-Jun antibody-stained nuclei showed similar characteristics of condensed and irregular apoptotic nuclei, whereas normal nuclei were larger and uniform under phase contrast microscopy (data not shown). These results indicate that TUNEL-stained and phospho-c-Jun antibody-stained cells were the ones undergoing apoptosis. These changes are similar to those produced when the cells were treated with a combination of TNF-α and vanadate (14Guo Y.-L. Baysal K. Kang B. Yang L.-J. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4027-4034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). It has been known for many years that most normal cells are resistant to TNF-α cytotoxicity and that this resistance can be abolished if the cells are preincubated with protein synthesis inhibitors such as actinomycin D and cycloheximide prior to exposure to TNF-α. Conversely, preincubation of the sensitive cells with TNF-α increases their resistance to a subsequent challenge with TNF-α (2Beyaert R. Fiers W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar,26Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). It is concluded that protective factor(s) can be elicited by TNF-α to counteract subsequent TNF-α cytotoxicity. However, actinomycin D and cycloheximide essentially block all de novo synthesis of proteins. Therefore, without other approaches, it is not possible to identify specific protective factors among various proteins induced by TNF-α treatment. Molecular genetic techniques have led to identification of some putative protective factors such as NF-κB (6Baichwal V.R. Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 94-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2939) Google Scholar, 27Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar) and BCL2 (28Grimm S. Bauer M.K.A. Baeuerle P.A. Schulze-Osthoff K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 29Karsan A. Yee E. Harlan J.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 29347-29355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). An alternative approach using specific inhibitors to block certain signaling pathways has proved to be useful. For example, PD098059 and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate have been used to selectively inhibit the ERK pathway and NF-κB activation, respectively (9Gardner A.M. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14560-14566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 31Lin K.-I. Lee S.-H. Narayanan R. Baraban J.M. Hardwick J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1149-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The results derived from these experiments provided important information for the elucidation of the roles of ERK and NF-κB in the regulation of apoptosis in some cells. In our previous report, results from experiments with the phosphatase inhibitor vanadate provided us with an important clue that suggested that a JNK phosphatase may act as a protective factor against TNF-α toxicity in mesangial cells (14Guo Y.-L. Baysal K. Kang B. Yang L.-J. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4027-4034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). However, vanadate's nonspecific inhibition of all protein tyrosine phosphatases, including pre-existing and induced phosphatases, made it difficult to evaluate which enzyme(s) was involved. The fact that MKP-1 mRNA is strongly induced by TNF-α indicates that MKP-1 could be one such phosphatase. If this is the case, one would expect that selectively blocking the expression of MKP-1 would sustain JNK activation and subsequently render the cells susceptible to TNF-α-induced apoptosis. In search of such an approach, it was brought to our attention that Beltman et al. (23Beltman J. McCormick F. Cook S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27018-27024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) reported recently that Ro318220, originally identified as a PKC inhibitor, selectively inhibited MKP-1 expression induced by epidermal growth factor and PMA in Rat-1 fibroblasts. This observation prompted us to test the effects of Ro318220 on mesangial cells. It showed a similar effect of preventing the expression of MKP-1 induced by TNF-α. More importantly, pretreatment of cells with Ro318220 produced essentially the same effects as those caused by vanadate in sustaining JNK activation, c-Jun phosphorylation, and inducing apoptosis by TNF-α (14Guo Y.-L. Baysal K. Kang B. Yang L.-J. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4027-4034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). These new results provide substantial evidence to support the notion that MKP-1 can inhibit stimulation of JNK by TNF-α in vivo. To our knowledge, this is the first documentation of MKP-1 induction by TNF-α. MKP are encoded by a multiple gene family. At least eight members have been identified, and virtually all of them are inducible immediate early gene products (15Keyse S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1265: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Whether other members of MKP are inducible by TNF-α and whether they contribute to the resistance of TNF-α apoptotic effect in mesangial cells remains to be investigated. Ro318220 selectively blocked expression of MKP-1 and subsequently prolonged JNK activation without inhibiting the activation of ERK (Fig. 2 B) and NF-κB (data not shown) by TNF-α. These results further strengthen our previous conclusion that TNF-α-stimulated ERK and NF-κB activation may not contribute to the protective effect on TNF-α-induced apoptosis (14Guo Y.-L. Baysal K. Kang B. Yang L.-J. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4027-4034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In Rat-1 cells, Ro318220 inhibited PMA- and epidermal growth factor-induced expression of MKP-1 as judged by Western blot analysis. Although it was shown that inhibition of expression of MKP-1 by Ro318220 was not through inhibition of protein synthesis, it was not clear how MKP-1 was inhibited. Here we have demonstrated that Ro318220 blocked MKP-1 expression most likely by inhibiting its transcription in mesangial cells. Ro318220 is a derivative of bisindolylmaleimide and was discovered as a PKC-specific inhibitor (24Wilkinson S.E. Parker P.J. Nixon J.S. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 335-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar); however, its effect in blocking the expression of MKP-1 is apparently PKC-independent in Rat-1 cells, suggesting that Ro318220 has some unique properties in addition to being a PKC inhibitor. Our results indicate that the effect of Ro318220 on expression of MKP-1 induced by TNF-α in mesangial cells also seems to be PKC-independent. This is indicated by the fact that blocking the PKC pathway by acute inhibition with another PKC inhibitor, GF109203X, or by down-regulation PKC with PMA only slightly inhibited TNF-α-induced expression of MKP-1. However, both acute inhibition and down-regulation of PKC completely blocked PMA-induced effects under the same conditions. 2Y.-L. Guo, B. Kang, and J. R. Williamson, manuscript in preparation. Another interesting observation is that Ro318220 also blocked expression of c-Fos induced by TNF-α in mesangial cells. A similar effect was observed in Rat-1 cells where c-Fos expression induced by lysophosphatidic acid and PMA was strongly inhibited (23Beltman J. McCormick F. Cook S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27018-27024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Further important questions are whether c-Fos induced by TNF-α also plays a role in protecting the cells from apoptosis, and if so, is there any interaction between c-Fos regulated gene products and MKP-1 in the TNF-α signaling pathways. These questions could best be addressed if the expression of c-Fos and MKP-1 induced by TNF-α can be separately manipulated. Experiments attempting to answer these questions are currently under way. We thank Dr. J. K. Westwick for providing GST-c-Jun plasmid, Drs. N. Tonks and H. Sun for providing pCEP4-MKP-1 plasmid, and Dr. M. Peng for assistance in Northern blot analysis."

We have shown previously that the alternative splicing is developmentally and hormonally regulated. Consequently, these studies were instigated to identify sequences within the primary RNA transcript that regulate the alternative splicing. Minigenes containing exons 10, 11, and 12 and the intervening introns were constructed and transfected into HepG2 cells, which contain both isoforms of the insulin receptor. The cells were able to splice the minigene transcript to give both A (− exon 11) and B-like (+ exon 11) RNAs. A series of internal deletions within intron 10 were tested for their ability to give A and B RNAs. Intron 10 contained two sequences that modulated exon 11 inclusion; a 48-nucleotide purine-rich sequence at the 5′ end of intron 10 that functions as a splicing enhancer and causes an increase in exon 11 inclusion, and a 43-nucleotide sequence at the 3′ end of intron 10 upstream of the branch point sequence that favors skipping of exon 11. Increasing the length of the polypyrimidine tract at the 3′ end of intron 10 caused exon 11 to be spliced constitutively, indicating that a weak splice site is required for alternative splicing.

The A isoform lacks exon 11, is expressed ubiquitously, and is the only isoform in lymphocytes, brain, and spleen; the B isoform contains exon 11 and is expressed predominantly in liver, muscle, adipocytes, and kidney (4Mosthaf L.

Exon 11 is composed of 36 nucleotides that encode a 12-amino acid segment (residues 717–728) of the carboxyl terminus of the α-subunit of IR. A number of investigators have suggested that the isoform ratio could be altered in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (7Kellerer M. Sesti G. Seffer E. Obermaier-Kusser B. Pongratz D.E.

Bodkin N.L. Ortmeyer H.K. Zenilman M.E. Webster N.J.G. Hansen B.C. Shuldiner A.R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 1552-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Similar results have been found in the rhesus monkey (16Huang Z. Bodkin N.L. Ortmeyer H.K. Hansen B.C. Shuldiner A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1289-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Along these lines, Sell and co-workers (17Sell S.M. Reese D. Ossowski V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30769-30772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that alternative splicing of the IR gene is regulated by insulin in the Fao hepatoma cell line. Furthermore, we have shown that the alternative splicing is hormonally and developmentally regulated in both the HepG2 hepatoma and 3T3-L1 adipocyte cell lines (18Kosaki A. Webster N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21990-21996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The changes in splicing were accompanied by increases in insulin sensitivity, as measured by a number of parameters (19Kosaki A. Pillay T.S. Xu L. Webster N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20816-20823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These data indicate that regulation of the alternative splicing of the IR is important for insulin sensitivity and responsiveness. Splicing of pre-mRNA depends on the presence of relatively short RNA sequence elements, the 3′ splice site, the 5′ splice site, the branch point sequence, and the polypyrimidine tract. In alternative splicing, a given splice site may be selected or ignored depending on the cell type or physiological state. This apparent flexibility of the splicing machinery raises the question of molecular mechanisms involved in selection of certain splice sites over others. A number of factors have been implicated in the choice of alternative splice sites, including RNA secondary structure (20Eperon L.P. Graham I.R. Griffiths A.D. Eperon I.C. Cell. 1988; 54: 393-401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 21Solnick D. Lee S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3194-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22Solnick D.

Biol. 1988; 8: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and relative strengths of the competing splice sites (26Nelson K.K. Green M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6253-6257Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Alterations in the splicing pattern of a number of genes have been demonstrated during cellular differentiation (27McKeown M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 133-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar); however, the hormonal regulation of alternative splicing is not as common. We have shown that the alternative splicing of exon 11 of the IR gene is modulated by glucocorticoids in HepG2 cells, and, as mentioned above, insulin modulates splicing in Fao cells (17Sell S.M. Reese D. Ossowski V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30769-30772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kosaki A. Webster N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21990-21996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin has also been shown to alter the splicing pattern of the COOH terminus of protein kinase C-β in L6 myotubes, and growth factors including epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and basic fibroblast growth factor alter the splicing of the COOH terminus of protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B in human fibroblasts (28Chalfant C.E.

Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1939-1944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that splicing of the insulin-like growth factor-I mRNA is regulated by growth hormone in HepG2 cells. The molecular mechanisms involved in the hormonal regulation of this process are not understood. A prerequisite for mechanistic studies of hormonal regulation is a knowledge of the RNA sequences involved in the alternative splicing event. To that end, we have identified the regions of intron 10 and exon 11 involved in the alternative splicing of the IR gene. Cell culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., and fetal calf serum was from Gemini Bioproducts (Calabasas, CA). [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). Taq DNA polymerase (Ampli-Taq) was purchased from Perkin-Elmer. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma or Fisher. All recombinant DNA manipulations were carried out according to standard protocols. The minigenes were constructed by amplifying regions of the IR gene from HepG2 genomic DNA by PCR using primers containing unique EcoRI, BamHI, HindIII, and BglII restriction sites to allow replacement of segments of the minigene as cassettes. We were not able to obtain the complete intron 11, as it is >8 kb. Consequently, we used the known intronic sequence to amplify the two ends of the intron. Thus, all minigenes contain approximately 180 nucleotides at each end of intron 11. In all plasmids, the minigenes were inserted between EcoRI and BglII sites of pSG5 vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), which contains the SV40 early promoter/enhancer, a rabbit β-globin intron 2, and an SV40 poly(A) signal after the multiple cloning site. All mutants were generated from the complete minigene B, which was composed of five elements (part of exon 10, entire intron 10, exon 11, a deleted intron 11, and part of exon 12). Fig. 1shows schematic diagram of the minigene and the sequence of the introns and exons. Deletions and mutations were verified by dideoxy sequencing. HepG2 cells were maintained routinely in minimum essential medium plus Earle's salts with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The cells were plated at a density of ∼2 × 106 cells/well in six-well plates. Medium was changed every 2 days. Minigene plasmids were transfected into HepG2 cells by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation technique. Cells were harvested 48 h later, and total cellular RNA was prepared using RNAzol B (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol. First-strand cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription using 1.0 μg of total RNA in a volume of 20 μl (250 pmol of random hexamer primers, 1 unit of Inhibit-ACE RNase inhibitor (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO), 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.), 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm dNTPs) at 42 °C for 1 h. DNA/RNA hybrids were denatured at 95 °C for 2 min. To measure exogenous minigene IR transcripts, the primer pair consisted of oligonucleotides spanning nucleotides 1022–1042 (sense primer, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′) and 1068–1088 (antisense primer, 5′-GCTGCAATAAACAAGTTCTGC-3′), which are unique sequences in the pSG5 vector just upstream and downstream of the cloning sites. To measure endogenous IR transcripts, the primer pair consisted of oligonucleotides spanning nucleotides 2140–2163 (sense primer, 5′-AACCAGAGTGAGTATGAGGATTCG-3′) and 2424–2447 (antisense primer, 5′-TTCTCAAAAGGCCTGTGCTCCTCC-3′) of the IR cDNA (numbering as in Ref. 1Ebina Y. Ellis L. Jarnagin K. Edery M. Graf L. Clauser E. Ou J.H. Masiarz F. Kan Y.W. Goldfine I.D. Cell. 1985; 40: 747-758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar), which lie outside the minigene and, thus, are specific for the endogenous gene. Five μl of the cDNA synthesis reaction was used for PCR amplification in a 50-μl final reaction volume (0.5 μmeach oligonucleotide primer, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dNTPs, 2 units of Taq DNA polymerase, and 1 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP). Twenty-five cycles of amplification were performed using a Perkin-Elmer DNA thermal cycler (System 9600). Each cycle consisted of a 30-s denaturation at 94 °C, a 30-s annealing at 55 °C, and a 60-s extension at 72 °C. The number of cycles was optimized to ensure that the amplification lay within the exponential phase. The products of the PCR amplification were resolved by electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried and exposed to film at room temperature. The band densities were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). We have shown previously that the endogenous IR gene in HepG2 cells generates mRNA for both the A and B isoform IR. We used this cell line to investigate which sequences surrounding the alternatively spliced exon 11 are involved in the alternative splicing. A minigene was created from by amplifying each exon and the adjacent intron from the known exon/intron sequences (2Seino S. Seino M. Nishi S. Bell G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). This minigene contained 110 nucleotides of exon 10, 2.3 kb of intron 10, 36 nucleotides of exon 11, 184 nucleotides of the 5′ end of intron 11, 188 nucleotides of the 3′ end of intron 11, and finally 103 nucleotides of exon 12 (Fig. 2, minigene B). Transfection of minigene B into HepG2 cells gave RNA corresponding to both the A (− exon 11) and B (+ exon 11) isoform splicing patterns in a 40:60 ratio (Fig. 2, panels B and C). The endogenous gene in these cells expressed both isoform RNAs in a 50:50 ratio using the endogenous gene primer pair (data not shown), suggesting that the minigene contained most of the information for correct splicing. A second minigene (minigene A), containing a large internal deletion of 2.0 kb in intron 10 (between positions 3 and 5 in the minigene), caused an increase in the percent of B splicing isoform (Fig. 2, compare minigenes A and B). A further deletion (to position 7) in minigene C caused a complete loss of B isoform splicing suggesting that sequences in this region (between positions 5 and 7) may be important for skipping of exon 11. Two potential branch point sequences (BPS) were identified in the intron upstream of exon 11 (indicated by A in Fig. 2 A). Removal of the upstream potential BPS by deletion to position 9 (minigene D) caused a large (80%) decrease in the amount of B isoform splicing, suggesting that this BPS may be involved in splice site selection. These deletions suggested that the regulatory sequences might lie in the region upstream of exon 11. Therefore, intron 10 was sequenced from the 3′ end, and an Alu repetitive sequence was found approximately 300 nucleotides upstream of exon 11. A further minigene was created (minigene E) deleting the central portion of the intron up to, but no further than, the Alu repeat. Transfection of minigene E into HepG2 cells gave a splicing ratio that was identical to minigene A; therefore, the extra sequence up to the Alu repeat did not affect splicing. The PCR amplification was performed for 40 cycles in an attempt to identify low abundance intermediate splice products for these five minigenes (Fig. 2 D). The mature, fully spliced products (mature mRNA) were observed as well as the unspliced precursor RNAs (pre-mRNA) that differed in size due to the internal deletions in the minigenes. No precursor RNA was observed for minigene B as it is predicted to be >3 kb and is not amplified under standard conditions. A product of ∼700 base pairs was observed for all minigenes regardless of the size of the internal deletion in intron 10. This PCR product was subcloned, sequenced, and found to be a splicing intermediate lacking intron 10 but still containing intron 11. No intermediates containing intron 10 but lacking intron 11 were isolated. Thus, removal of intron 10 precedes removal of intron 11 in agreement with the processive model of RNA splicing and suggests that the 3′ splice site of exon 11 is subject to selection. The increase in B isoform splicing by the internal deletions in minigenes A, C, and E in Fig. 2could be explained by alterations in the spacing of the splice sites. If this were the case, then larger deletions should have an even greater effect. Consequently, minigenes K, L, and M were constructed with larger deletions starting 26 nucleotides downstream of the 5′ splice site of exon 10 (Fig. 3, position 1) and extending to the end points of minigenes A, C and D (Fig. 3, minigenes K, L, and M, respectively). Surprisingly, transfection of minigene K into HepG2 cells gave <10% B isoform splicing in contrast to minigene A which gave >85%. It is very striking that elimination of intronic sequences in the 5′ end of intron 10 (between positions 1 and 3) caused a dramatic (75%) decrease in exon 11 inclusion. This suggests that this region contains a sequence that enhances inclusion of exon 11. Deletion of the sequences between positions 5 and 7 (minigene L) caused a large increase in the amount of B isoform splicing consistent with the results from minigenes A and C (Fig. 3). The change in splice site usage is even more dramatic for minigenes K and L than for minigenes A and C, as a result of the absence of the upstream enhancer that favors exon 11 inclusion. These results confirm that sequences between positions 5 and 7 cause exon skipping. Elimination of an additional 26 nucleotides to position 9 (minigene M) caused complete loss of B isoform splicing. A similar loss in B isoform splicing was associated with deletion of this region in minigenes C and D. However, minigene D still showed approximately 20% B isoform splicing, suggesting that this deletion severely weakens the 3′ splice site but partial recognition is possible in the presence of the upstream enhancer. This upstream splicing enhancer was identified by comparing minigenes A and K. Both of these minigenes contain large internal deletions within intron 10, which brings the enhancer closer to the 3′ splice site. What is the function of this region in the context of the full intron? This region was deleted in the full intron (Fig. 3, minigene W). Deletion of this region caused a 20% decrease in B isoform splicing. Consequently, this region does function as a splicing enhancer but its effect is less pronounced when it is >2 kb upstream of the splice site (compare minigenes W, A, and K). The enhancer region contains a purine-rich sequence, so two additional deletions were created to assess the contribution of this purine-rich region. Minigene Y lacks the purine-rich sequence, whereas minigene X lacks the remaining sequence in this region. Only minigene Y showed a statistically significant decrease in B isoform splicing. The purine-rich region is 75% GA over a stretch of 60 nucleotides. Repeats of the motif GARGARGAR have been shown to function as splicing enhancers in other genes (31Ramchatesingh J. Zahler A.M. Neugebauer K.M. Roth M.B. Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4898-4907Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The sequence in intron 10 does not contain such repeats, but is very GA-rich and may function in a similar manner. The region between positions 5 and 7 that causes exon skipping was identified, as was the enhancer sequence, using minigenes with large internal deletions in intron 10. What is the role of this inhibitory region in the context of the full intron? A minigene was constructed which lacked only the inhibitory region between positions 5 and 7 (Fig. 3, minigene F). Transfection of minigene F into HepG2 cells gave >95% B isoform RNA compared with 65% for minigene B with the full intron. Thus, removal of 70 nucleotides from the 2.3-kb intron causes an increase in B isoform splicing. The inhibitory region was further localized to a 43-nucleotide sequence between positions 6 and 7 (minigene N). Deletion of the 27 nucleotides between positions 5 and 6 had no effect on splicing (minigene S). Removal of another 26 nucleotides (minigene G) or 52 nucleotides to the 3′ splice site of exon 11 (minigene H) dramatically weakens the splice site as would be expected. Similarly, small deletions of 26 or 13 nucleotides (minigenes O and T) caused a dramatic drop in exon 11 inclusion, suggesting that this 13-nucleotide sequence is necessary for the efficient use of the 3′ splice site. Previous internal deletions in intron 10 had suggested that elimination of the upstream series of adenines between positions 7 and 9 in the minigene impaired the use of the downstream splice site and caused skipping of exon 11 (Fig. 4, minigene O). However, all deletions eliminated other regulatory regions as well. Adenine residues have been identified as the branch point nucleotides in many but not all introns, so elimination of these adenines might explain the alteration in splicing. Mutation of the four adenine residues in this region had no effect on splicing (Fig. 4, minigene I), indicating that this sequence cannot be the functional BPS. However, deletion of the three adenine residues proximal to the splice site (minigene V) gave <5% exon 11 inclusion. Although this result does not specifically identify the branch point residue, it is likely that one of these adenines is the functional BPS. Alignment of the most distal of the three adenines UCCUCAA with the consensus branch point sequence UNCURAC indicates that this residue could be the branch point, however, accurate identification of the branch point residue will require in vitro branch point mapping. So why does B isoform splicing decrease when the region containing the four upstream adenines is deleted (minigene O)? One possible explanation is that the deletions may have impaired the function of the putative downstream BPS. A deletion from position 8 to 9 between the two stretches of adenines gave a similar reduction in exon inclusion (minigene T). The 3′ end of this deletion was 2 nucleotides 5′ to the BPS. All of the previous deletions were constructed by engineering BamHI restriction sites. Therefore, a minigene was constructed with four nucleotide substitutions to create a BamHI site at a position analogous to the deletion mutants (minigene U). This minigene gave <5% exon inclusion, indicating that mutation of four residues GUCCUCAAAGG to GGAUCCAAAGG could result in exon skipping, presumably by impairing the function of the BPS described above. Conversely, mutation of four nucleotides downstream of the triple adenines had little effect on splicing (minigene AE). The 3′ splice site in this intron contains a single G residue in the middle of a stretch of nine pyrimidines. Purine residues in the center of the polypyrimidine tract have been shown to have a detrimental effect on RNA splicing (32Roscigno R.F. Weiner M. Garcia-Blanco M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11222-11229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of the guanine residue to thymidine had little effect on exon inclusion (minigene AA). However, increasing the length of the pY tract to 14 pyrimidines caused the exon to be spliced constitutively (minigene AF). Thus, the alternative splicing of exon 11 requires a weak 3′ splice site and strengthening the site renders the exon constitutive similar to results for other genes (33Dirksen W.P. Sun Q. Rottman F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5346-5352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the alternatively spliced exon itself might be involved in splice site recognition, we introduced mutations into exon 11 in the parental minigene B. Introduction of four point mutations in the middle of the exon caused the exon to be spliced constitutively (Fig. 5, minigene J). An overlapping four point mutations, however, had no effect (minigene AC). A deletion of eight nucleotides or insertion of three thymidine residues caused an almost complete loss of exon inclusion (Fig. 5, minigenes Z and AB). The point mutations that rendered the exon constitutive were tested in combination with deletions of the inhibitory region identified earlier (Fig. 3). There was no additional effect when combined with minigenes F and N that are deleted for the 3′ inhibitory region (Fig. 5, minigenes P and Q). Interestingly, when these exon mutations were introduced into minigene O, which contained a deletion that impaired function of the putative BPS, there was an increase in the amount of B isoform splicing. Thus, the weakened BPS is able to function, albeit weakly, in the presence of mutations in the exon. These results indicate that the exon 11 sequences play an active role in determining the degree of exon inclusion in both a positive and negative manner. The alternative splicing of exon 11 of the IR gene is consistent with the models depicted in Fig. 6. The GA-rich splicing enhancer at the 5′ end of intron 10 favors inclusion of exon 11. This could be due to a direct effect on the 3′ splice site. Alternatively, as the enhancer is >2 kb upstream of the BPS, the effect of the enhancer could be on the adjacent 5′ splice site. The proximal site (TAG:GUCAGGAC) differs significantly from the consensus (CAG:GUAAGUAU) so the effect of the enhancer may be to strengthen the interaction of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle with the 5′ splice site (34Kuo H.-C. Nasim F.H. Grabowski P.J. Science. 1991; 251: 1045-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). How this might affect alternative splicing of the downstream exon is not clear, as this site is used whether or not the exon is included, but it may allow the use of a suboptimal splice acceptor site. SR proteins that recognize purine-rich enhancer sequences are known to favor use of proximal splice sites (35Fu X.D. RNA. 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar, 36Wang J. Manley J.L.

SF2/ASF is a member of the SR protein family and can bind to GA-rich splicing enhancer sequences similar to that identified in the 5′ end of intron 10. Overexpression of SF2/ASF has been shown to promote inclusion of alternatively spliced exons in the rat clathrin light chain B and rat β-tropomyosin genes (41Caceres J.F. Stamm S. Helfman D.M. Krainer A.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1706-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 42Mayeda A. Helfman D.M. Krainer A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2993-3001Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). This is due to the ability of SF2/ASF to promote the use of a proximal splice site, either 5′ or 3′, over a distal site. Interestingly, this activity is antagonized by the hnRNP-A1 splicing factor, which favors the use of distal splice sites over proximal. The observed choice of splice sites reflects a balance between SF2/ASF and hnRNP-A1 activities. Both SF2/ASF and hnRNP-A1 are RNA-binding proteins. In contrast to the SR proteins, hnRNP-A1 binds to sequences containing the motif UAGGGA or UAGGGU (43Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The 5′ end of intron 10 also contains the sequence CTTAGGGACC, which includes an hnRNP-A1 binding site (underlined). Whether hnRNP-A1 could regulate the alternative splicing is unknown; however, deletion of the 5′ end of intron 10 in minigene X eliminates the potential hnRNP-A1 binding site but has no effect on the splicing. Further studies will be required to determine if SR proteins or hnRNP-A1 can recognize the regulatory regions that we have identified in the IR gene and modulate splice site selection. At the 3′ end of the intron, there are two regions that influence exon skipping. One is inhibitory and located in the intron upstream of the BPS. Interestingly, secondary structure prediction programs based on the Zuker algorithm indicate that this region has the potential to form a stable stem-loop structure. Whether such a structure is formed in vivo is not known. The role of secondary structure in alternative splicing has been reviewed recently (23Balvay L. Libri D. Fiszman M.Y. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The polypyrimidine tract at the 3′ splice site is only 9 nucleotides with a central guanine residue. Mutation of the guanine to give a stretch of 10 contiguous pyrimidines did not have an effect on exon recognition; however, increasing the length of the polypyrimidine tract to 14 nucleotides rendered the exon constitutive. Thus, exclusion of the exon requires a suboptimal splice acceptor site. Similar effects have been seen with the growth hormone and other genes (33Dirksen W.P. Sun Q. Rottman F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5346-5352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The second regulatory region is contained within the alternatively spliced exon itself and appears to have both positive and negative effects. On the one hand, introduction of four point mutations caused the exon to be constitutive, suggesting a negative role for the exon. On the other hand, insertion of three thymidines or deletion of a stretch of eight pyrimidines caused the exon to be skipped indicating a positive role. Interestingly, the constitutive point mutations had little effect when combined with deletions of the inhibitory region upstream. Thus these regulatory regions could function independently to modulate recognition of the 3′ splice site (Fig. 6) or, alternatively, both sequences could be involved in a larger regulatory region involving secondary structure around the 3′ splice site. Further studies are planned to test these models."

In cultured cell preparations, individual cells present asynchronous activity with different firing patterns (pace-making or bursting mode). When electrical recordings are combined with fluorescent monitoring of cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+] i), single spontaneous spikes trigger transient rises in [Ca2+] i with characteristic features; a time to peak of less than 1 s and a return within a couple of seconds (1Schlegel W.

The lag between the onset of the [Ca2+] i rise and exocytosis is also within a subsecond range (2Fomina A.F. Levitan E.S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4982-4991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Lee A.K. Tse A. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1997; 23: 95Google Scholar), sharing common features of stimulus-secretion coupling with neuroendocrine cells (e.g. chromaffin cells) and neurons, which release peptides from LDCV (4Lim N.F.

Although electrical activity has already been detected in the anterior pituitary gland, both in vivo and in tissue preparations (7York D.H. Baker F.L. Kraicer J. Neuroendocrinology. 1971; 8: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 8Ozawa S. Sand O. Experientia. 1977; 34: 542-544Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 9Guérineau N.C. McKinney R.A.

Methods. 1997; 73: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the dynamics and organization of [Ca2+] i rises associated with spontaneous action potentials have not yet been investigated at the tissue level. Based on the heterogeneous distribution of the five secretory cell types throughout the tissue (10Baker B.L. Handb. Physiol. Sect. Endocrinol. 1974; 4: 45-80Google Scholar), endocrine cells would display asynchronous firing so that the overall activity of each secretory type would simply reflect the average of single cell events. Cell regulation should mainly depend on the input of hypothalamic clocks, such as sequential release of growth hormone-releasing factor and somatostatin, which have been shown to pace growth hormone (GH) release (11Plotsky P.M. Vale W. Science. 1985; 230: 461-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). However, the gland disconnected from the hypothalamic inputs still shows pulsatile GH release (12Perez F.M. Hymer W.C. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 1877-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), suggesting a synchronization of cellular signals within the tissue. With regard to the mechanisms accounting for synchronization in other tissues (13Saez J.C. Connor J.A. Spray D.C. Bennett M.V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

First, both endocrine and non-endocrine (folliculostellate) pituitary cells release various products (ATP, dopamine, and so forth), which locally act on neighboring cells (19Rosenzweig L.J. Kramer Y.S. Endocrinology. 1982; 111: 1817-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20Allaerts W. Carmeliet P. Denef C. Mol. Cell.

Neurosci. Methods. 1997; 73: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 22Meda P. Pepper S.M. Traub O. Willecke K. Gros D. Beyer E. Nicholson B. Paul D. Orci L.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3356-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) may allow both metabolic and electrical coupling between connected cells. To study the behavior of spontaneously active cells within the adenohypophysis, we measured the multicellular patterns of spontaneous [Ca2+] i rises in acute slices of guinea pig pituitary, which preserved tissue structure (25Edwards F. Konnerth A. Sakmann B. Takahashi T. Pflügers Arch. 1989; 414: 600-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). Real time confocal laser microscopy with the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye fluo-3 offers a sensitive method for optical recording of the fast peaking [Ca2+] i transients due to spontaneous action potentials. By visualizing the multicellular profiles of [Ca2+] i activity in these slices, we detected clusters of spontaneously coactive endocrine cells, which were scattered throughout the anterior pituitary. An abstract of a preliminary account of these results has already been presented (51Guérineau N.C. Stoeckel L. Mercier F. Mollard P. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1996; 22: 1347Google Scholar). Acute pituitary slices were prepared according to previously reported methods (26Schneggenburger R. Konnerth A. Pflügers Arch. 1992; 421: 364-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pituitary gland was removed from 4–8-week-old female guinea pigs (OCF-DH albinos) that had been killed by decapitation after pentobarbital anesthesia. After keeping the gland in ice-cold saline for 2 min, it was glued onto an agarose cube and transferred to the stage of a vibratome (Microslicer®, DTK-1000, D.S.K, Dosaka EM Co. Ltd., Kyoto, Japan). Coronal slices of 150-μm thickness were then cut with a razor blade and transferred to a storage chamber thermostated at 32 °C, containing Ringer's saline (in mm): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 12 glucose, and buffered to pH 7.4. The saline was continuously bubbled with carbogen (95% O2, 5% C02). As reported for the slices of the intermediate lobe (26Schneggenburger R. Konnerth A. Pflügers Arch. 1992; 421: 364-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), slices of the anterior lobe were suitable for patch-clamp recordings and Ca2+ signal measurements immediately after cutting. Slices were viable up to 8 h, as seen by the presence of spontaneous [Ca2+] i elevations. To achieve optical and/or electrophysiological recordings, pituitary slices were transferred to a recording chamber attached to the stage of an upright microscope fitted with differential interference contrast optics (Axioskop FS, Zeiss, Le Pecq, France) and continuously superfused with Ringer's saline at 30 °C. Fast spontaneous [Ca2+] i transients were routinely measured by a real time (30–480 frames/s) confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with an Ar/Kr laser (Odyssey XL with InterVision 1.4.1 software, Noran Instruments Inc., Middleton, WI). Cells were viewed with a 63 × 0.9 numerical aperture achroplan water immersion objective lens (Zeiss). Various thicknesses of confocal images was obtained by selecting different detection slits. The larger slit (100 μm) was used for [Ca2+] i signals, giving bright images with a 3.1-μm axial resolution. When cells were subsequently loaded with Lucifer yellow (see below), confocal images were acquired with a 25-μm slit, which provided an axial resolution of ∼1.3 μm. Slices were loaded with the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent probe fluo-3 by exposure to 10 μm fluo-3 acetoxymethyl ester (fluo-3/AM, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 20–30 min at 32 °C (27Mollard P. Seward E.P. Nowycky M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3065-3069Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Fluo-3 was excited through a 488-nm band pass filter, and the emitted fluorescence was collected through a 515-nm barrier filter. Transmitted images were acquired using the longer wavelength of the laser beam (647 nm), which penetrated deeply into pituitary slices. To follow the time course of fluo-3 emission changes, the bright over time tool of the InterVision 1.4.1 software package was applied to areas that surrounded cells either on live images or following capture of sequential images into memory of an Indy R4600SC/133 MHz Silicon Graphics station equipped with a Cosmo compress JPEG board. To ensure that the image rate acquisition was adequate to resolve the time delay between [Ca2+] i changes measured in cells of the same field, the fluorescence changes were also acquired in the line scanning mode at a rate of 4.4 ms/line (6400 ns sample time, 480 lines). In some experiments, the line trigger (TTL signal) from the Odyssey XL was used to trigger a voltage pulse that helped synchronize its timing with the line 100. A voltage stimulator delivered these depolarizing pulses (2 ms, 6 V) to a patch pipette filled with Ringer's saline and positioned on the cell (28Lipscombe D. Madison D.V. Poenie M. Reuter H. Tsien R.W. Tsien R.Y. Neuron. 1988; 1: 355-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Because fluo-3 is a single-wavelength dye, its emission is a function of both intracellular Ca2+ and dye concentrations. [Ca2+] i changes were therefore expressed as the F/F minratio where F min was the minimum fluorescence intensity measured during the recording (27Mollard P. Seward E.P. Nowycky M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3065-3069Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). No detectable difference was noted between slices used just after cutting or after spending several hours in the storage chamber. Acquired data were then processed for analysis using either the Indy station (InterVision 1.4.1, two-dimensional analysis module) or a PowerPC 8100/100 MHz (NIH Image 1.6.0, Adobe Photoshop 3.0.5 or Igor Pro 2.03). Membrane potential was recorded in the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique (29Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15064) Google Scholar). Patch pipettes were pulled to a resistance of 4–8 megohms from borosilicate glass (1.5-mm outer diameter, 1.17-mm inner diameter) and filled with the following internal solution (in mm): 140 potassium gluconate, 10 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 1.1 EGTA, 5 HEPES, that was titrated to pH 7.2 with KOH. For simultaneous recordings of membrane potential and [Ca2+] i, the perforated whole-cell patch-clamp technique was preferred to the conventional patch-clamp technique. In this case, the internal pipette solution was composed of (in mm): 10 KCl, 10 NaCl, 70 K2SO4, 7 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, and 100 μg/ml nystatin (Sigma). Nystatin was added to the electrode solution before filling the patch pipettes. Perforation was usually achieved within 10 min after seal formation. Cells with an access resistance >30 megohms were discarded. Membrane potential was recorded under current-clamp conditions using a List EPC-9 patch-clamp amplifier (HEKA Electronik, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany) and filtered at 3 kHz. Patch-clamp signals were acquired and analyzed using Pulse + PulseFit softwares (version 7.86, HEKA Electronik) on a PowerPC 8100/100. The fluorescent dye Lucifer yellow (LY, 4% in 150 mm LiCl) was introduced into cells through a sharp microelectrode. The cells were impaled and filled for a few minutes, before image acquisition with the confocal microscope. When LY was injected into cells not subjected to [Ca2+] i imaging, the cells were selected on the basis of their round or oval shape and the presence of dense vesicles, which resembled hormone-containing vesicles. In addition, the hormonal content of impaled cells was routinely characterized by immunofluorescence after formaldehyde fixation of slices. Cells were also loaded with the NeurobiotinTM(N-(2-aminoethyl)-biotinamide hydrochloride) tracer (1% in the internal solution) by diffusion through the patch pipette for 10–30 min. To increase the rate of Neurobiotin dialysis, depolarizing pulses (500-ms duration, 0.5 Hz) were periodically applied. In some cells, the presence of gap junctional communication was assessed by using the size exclusion properties of dextran conjugates (9Guérineau N.C. McKinney R.A. Debanne D. Mollard P. Gähwiler B.H. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1997; 73: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cells were dialyzed with a patch pipette containing 1% Neurobiotin plus 2 mg/ml dextran Texas Red (lysine fixable, M r3,000) for at least 10 min. After fixation (see below), slices were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and then incubated in PBS + BSA + 0.8% saponin for 1 h at room temperature. After several rinses in PBS + BSA, Neurobiotin staining was revealed using fluorescein- or Texas Red-labeled avidin D (1:200 dilution, room temperature, 5 or 1 h, respectively). After optical/electrophysiological recordings, pituitary slices were fixed prior to immunohistofluorescence as follows. The tissue was uniformly fixed by two successive formaldehyde solutions as described previously (30Berod A. Hartman B.K. Pujol J.F. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1981; 29: 844-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Slices were incubated firstly in formaldehyde 3% pH 6.5 (8 mm PIPES, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.2 mmMgCl2) for 10 min and secondly in formaldehyde 3%, pH 11, (100 mm sodium borate) for 1 h at room temperature. They were then rinsed in 0.1% sodium borohydride (PBS, pH 8), permeabilized in 0.8% saponin (PBS, pH 7.4) for 45 min and washed with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (10 mm TRIZMA® base, 150 mm NaCl) plus 1% BSA (pH 7.6). Slices were incubated overnight at 4 °C in the presence of antibodies raised against human GH (developed in rabbit, used at 1:2500 dilution) with 0.05% BSA in TBS. The antiserum was kindly donated by Dr. Tillet (INRA, Nouzilly, France) and the NIDDK-human GH-B-1 was used as an antigen. Incubation was followed by several washes with TBS plus 0.05% BSA. The primary antibodies were localized by a 1-hr incubation with a Cy5- or fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG developed in donkey (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA), used at 1:250 dilution in TBS plus 0.05% BSA. After washes, slices were postfixed in formaldehyde 3% (PBS, pH 7.4) and rinsed in 50 mm NH4Cl before mounting in SlowfadeTM Light (Molecular Probes). Images were acquired with the confocal microscope as described above. Cells were viewed with a 63 × 1.4 numerical aperture plan-apochromat with a 15-μm detection slit (∼0.65-μm axial resolution). Drugs were pressure-ejected from an extracellular micropipette (tip diameter 2–5 μm), the tip of which was positioned in the vicinity of the recorded cells. The concentration reported are those in the pressure pipette. Lucifer yellow, somatostatin-14, and the calcium channel blocker CdCl2, were purchased from Sigma. The gap junction blocker halothane (2-bromo-2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane) was from Fluka. To obtain Ca2+-free solution, CaCl2 was omitted from, and 5 mm EGTA was added to modified Ringer's saline. The Neurobiotin tracer was purchased from Vector Laboratories (Biosys S.A., Compiègne, France). Numerical data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Student's t test was used to compare means when appropriate. Differences between groups were assessed by using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. Differences with p < 0.05 were considered significant. Experiments were performed in coronal slices (150-μm thickness) from pituitary of 4–8-week-old female guinea pigs. Slices were loaded with fluo-3/AM by bath application of the Ca2+ indicator, which produced widespread staining of the first and second layers of cells on the slice surface. When visualized with epifluorescence under the upright microscope, numerous cells within each field exhibited spontaneous changes in fluo-3 emission, reflecting rises in [Ca2+] i (31Minta A. Kao J.P.Y. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8171-8178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Time-lapse optical sequences of the cells showing spontaneous [Ca2+] i rises were then recorded with fast scanning confocal imaging (120 images/s with averaging 4 frames) during different experimental protocols. In most slices, one to several groups of adjacent active cells which fired synchronously were observed, as visualized at first using the epifluorescent port of the microscope. Real time optical imaging revealed then that these clusters of synchronous cells coexisted with asynchronous neighboring cells as illustrated in Fig. 1 A. The top leftimage shows a field in which four fluo-3-loaded cells could be observed in the same optical section. The montage of consecutive optical slices depicts a time series of fluo-3 emission frames encoded in pseudocolors (from blue to red with [Ca2+] i increasing). The three bottom cells fired spontaneous fast-peaking [Ca2+] i transients. The plots of relative fluo-3 emission changes show that two cells paced their [Ca2+] i in synchrony, whereas the third one had its own rhythm. With only the first pair of synchronized [Ca2+] i transients, it seems likely that the red-circled cell became active before the green-circled one while the lag between the following pairs of [Ca2+] i transients was indistinguishable under the time resolution used in these experiments. Both synchronous and asynchronous cells presented spontaneous [Ca2+] i transients with roughly similar kinetics (time to peak = 150.6 ± 6.8 ms, n = 141), patterns (pace-maker or bursts) and firing frequency (0.54 ± 0.07 Hz, range from 0.1 to 2.4 Hz, n = 43). No difference was noted with regard to the location of synchronized cell clusters within coronal slices. In addition, spontaneously coactive cells were also detected in sagittal slices (n = 4) suggesting a lack of preferential orientation for the spread of coactivation among spontaneously active cells. Confocal imaging routinely enabled us to observe doublets of coactive cells in single optical sections. However, multiplets with three to four coactive cells were occasionally encountered (Fig. 1 B). The kinetic features of spontaneous [Ca2+] i transients observed in acute pituitary slices along with previous [Ca2+] i data obtained in cultured pituitary cells (1Schlegel W. Winiger B.P. Mollard P. Vacher P. Wuarin F. Zahnd G. Wollheim C.B. Dufy B. Nature. 1987; 329: 719-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 32Guérineau N. Corcuff J-B. Tabarin A. Mollard P. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) suggest that these [Ca2+] i fluctuations resulted from voltage-gated Ca2+ entry. We therefore investigated their extracellular Ca2+ dependence. Local application of a Ca2+-deprived solution reversibly blocked synchronous [Ca2+] i transients (Fig. 1 C, n = 5) as well as asynchronous [Ca2+] i fluctuations (n = 24). A Cd2+-containing Ringer's saline (0.5 mmCdCl2) ejected in the vicinity of cells had a similar effect on both synchronous (n = 3) and asynchronous [Ca2+] i transients (n = 8, data not illustrated). Interestingly, the first [Ca2+] i transients still occurred synchronously after washout (Fig. 1 C, inset), suggesting that blockade of Ca2+ entry did not alter the coactivation spread. When [Ca2+] i monitoring was combined simultaneously with recordings of membrane potential using the perforated patch-clamp technique, the triggering of a single action potential was sufficient to elicit a rapid increase in [Ca2+] i with kinetics (time to peak = 182.4 ± 25.1 ms, n = 18) similar to those of spontaneous [Ca2+] i transients recorded in cells not subjected to patch-clamping (p > 0.05, data not shown). Different communication mechanisms, either electrical or biochemical, could explain the synchronization of spontaneously active cells. Since coactivation always occurred between apposing cells of finite clusters, the synchronization signal should be restricted to coactive cell-cell boundaries, but not extensively diffused to neighboring asynchronous cells. Since gap junctions were described in the anterior pituitary (22Meda P. Pepper S.M. Traub O. Willecke K. Gros D. Beyer E. Nicholson B. Paul D. Orci L. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2371-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), we carried out dye coupling experiments with a low molecular weight fluorescent dye LY (457 Da). The tracer was injected through a sharp microelectrode into single cells belonging to synchronized clusters. Fig. 2 A illustrates an example of two neighboring cells exhibiting synchronized spontaneous [Ca2+] i transients. After fluo-3 emission measurements, cell labeled 2 was impaled with LY (4% in 150 mm LiCl). A few seconds later, cell labeled 1was also stained with LY, indicating the LY diffusion from the impaled cell to the coupled partner. No diffusion was observed in other adjacent cells (n = 21). Moreover, LY diffusion was restricted to single impaled cells, which spontaneously fired with their own rhythm (Fig. 2 B, n = 14). These data strongly suggest that gap junctions could ensure the spread of coactivation between excitable pituitary cells. Since large molecules (≥1,000 Da) usually do not permeate through gap junctions, further experiments were conducted with large molecular weight dextran conjugates. Cells were randomly loaded with Neurobiotin, a low molecular mass dye (323 Da, 1% in internal patch pipette solution) and dextran Texas Red (3,000 Da, 2 mg/ml), by diffusion for 10–30 min. In two out of seven clusters, patched cells contained both markers, whereas coupled cells were labeled with Neurobiotin only (data not shown). In the others, no dye diffusion was observed. When LY or Neurobiotin were injected into cells not subjected to [Ca2+] i imaging, the tracers diffused from the impaled cell to neighboring cells in 47% of the clusters tested (n = 57/121). The extent of dye coupling, however, did not usually exceed five to six cells, as seen by three-dimensional reconstruction of optical slices (data not shown). Similar experiments were further conducted in presence of the gap junction blocker halothane (33Johnston M.F. Simon S.A. Ramon F. Nature. 1980; 286: 498-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 34Burt J.M. Spray D.C. Circ. Res. 1989; 65: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In pituitary slices bathed for 15–60 min in Ringer's saline saturated with 3 mm halothane, the appearance of dye-coupled cells was reduced to 17.8% (Fig. 2 C, p < 0.05). It was unlikely that the lowering of dye-coupling was linked to a decrease in [Ca2+] i spiking activity since fast spontaneous [Ca2+] i transients still occurred in the presence of the blocker. In most cells, halothane did not alter the shape (time to peak 157.5 ± 7.8 ms, n = 74 transients recorded in 14 different cells, p > 0.05) and frequency (0.51 ± 0.09 Hz, n = 14,p > 0.05) of spontaneous [Ca2+] i transients. In the other cells, halothane, however, reduced [Ca2+] i spiking. The reversibility of halothane effects was checked by placing treated slices in a halothane-free saline for 1–3 h. Under these conditions, the percentage of dye-coupled cells recovered to control level (Fig. 2 C,p > 0.05). Fig. 2 D shows the uncoupling effect of halothane (3 mm, 3–5 min bath application) on previously coactive cells (n = 5). In addition, LY injection in one of these cells failed to label its neighboring cells. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the spread of synchronization could be mediated by gap junctions. Spread of coactivation through gap junctions can be due to either simple diffusion of Ca2+ from a trigger cell to coupled cells or electrical coupling between these cells. Since these two mechanisms are associated with distinct speeds of propagation, x-t-series line scans were performed to estimate the speed of the wave of coactivation. A single horizontal line crossing synchronized cells was continuously scanned over 2,133 ms (4.4 ms/line, 480 lines). Fig. 3 A shows each line displayed in time along the y axis. The time course of the fluorescence changes in synchronized cells revealed a 5.6-ms delay between the onset of spontaneous [Ca2+] i transients. Taking into account the distance between cell centers, the average speed of the coactivation wave from the trigger cell to the other was 1,056 ± 112 μm/s (n = 40, 5 different coactive clusters). Interestingly, the calculation of the delay between [Ca2+] i transients within coactive cell assembly revealed that the trigger cell could become the responding cell and vice versa during recordings (four out of five clusters, Fig. 3 B). In parallel experiments, an external voltage stimulation (6 V, 2 ms) was delivered from a micropipette touching one cell at the slice surface. Such a stimulation induced a fast [Ca2+] i rise which could propagate to one or two adjacent cells in the same focal plane (n = 9, data not shown). The speed of propagation calculated from x-t-series data (1,639 ± 613 μm/s, n = 4 clusters) did not differ from that found between spontaneous synchronized cells (p > 0.05). Earlier studies carried out in pituitary cells isolated from the tissue have revealed that spontaneous electrical activity and ensuing [Ca2+] i transients were mainly observed in cells containing either GH or prolactin (35Corrette B.J. Bauer C.K. Schwarz J.R. Scherübl H. Hescheler J. The Electrophysiology of Neuroendocrine Cells. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 101-143Google Scholar). Since somatotrophs are the dominant secretory cell type in the anterior pituitary, we therefore investigated whether coactive cells could contain GH. To conduct this experiment, the hormonal content of cells was identified by immunohistofluorescence following formaldehyde fixation of slices. In 50% of cell clusters (14 out of 28), spontaneously coactive cells were GH-containing cells as illustrated in Fig. 4 (mid top frame). As expected from previously described results, the two synchronized cells were stained following LY injection (cells that turned green, second top frame). Interestingly, other apposing cells were also immunoreactive to GH but not dye-coupled to coactive cells. This suggests that homologous coupling could at least involve subsets of spontaneously active somatotrophs. Somatostatin, a native inhibitor of GH release, reversibly blocked spontaneous [Ca2+] i"

After photoactivation, fluorescein-labeled membranes from Chinese hamster ovary cells were solubilized in octylglucoside and separated by tandem anion exchange and gel filtration chromatography. A single peak of fluorescence was observed in extracts of FPR-expressing cells that was absent in extracts from wild type controls. Photolabeled Chinese hamster ovary membranes were cleaved with CNBr, and the fluorescent fragments were isolated on an antifluorescein immunoaffinity matrix. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry identified a major species with mass = 1754, consistent with the CNBr fragment of fMBpaFYK-fl cross-linked to Val-Arg-Lys-Ala-Hse (an expected CNBr fragment of FPR, residues 83–87). This peptide was further cleaved with trypsin, repurified by antifluorescein immunoaffinity, and subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. A tryptic fragment with mass = 1582 was observed, which is the mass of fMBpaFYK-fl cross-linked to Val-Arg-Lys (FPR residues 83–85), an expected trypsin cleavage product of Val-Arg-Lys-Ala-Hse. Residues 83–85 lie within the putative second transmembrane-spanning region of FPR near the extracellular surface. A 3D model of FPR is presented, which accounts for intramembrane, site-directed mutagenesis results (Miettinen, H. M., Mills, J., Gripentrog, J., Dratz, E. A., Granger, B. L., and Jesaitis, A. J.

(1997) J. Immunol.159, 4045–4054) and the photochemical cross-linking data. The phagocyte chemotactic receptors, including the formyl peptide receptor (FPR), 1The abbreviations used are: FPR, formyl peptide receptor; fMBpaFYK-fl, formyl-Met-p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine-Phe-Tyr-Lys-ε-N-fluorescein; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; fMLF, formyl-Met-Leu-Phe; Bpa, benzoylphenylalanine; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MALDI-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; WT, wild type; FACScan, fluorescence-activated cell scanner. the lipoxin A4 receptor, the C5a receptor, the platelet-activating factor receptor, and the interleukin-8 receptor are involved in inflammation and are all members of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. Among the most studied in this inflammatory receptor family is neutrophil FPR (1Prossnitz E.R. Ye R.D. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 74: 73-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). FPR binds N-formyl peptides, such as formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLF), with nanomolar affinity (2Schiffmann E. Corcoran B. Wahl S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1059-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Such N-formyl peptides are indicators of the presence of bacteria (3Marasco W.A. Phan S.H. Krutzsch H. Showell H.J. Feltner D.E. Nairn R. Becker E.L. Ward P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5430-5436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or damage to host cell mitochondria (4Carp H. J. Exp.

Binding of N-formyl peptides to FPR thus provides phagocytes with signals for infection or injury and results in activation of chemotaxis and other host defensive processes including lysosomal enzyme secretion, stimulation of production of inflammatory mediators, and generation of superoxide. The effects of amino acid substitutions and modifications of fMLF peptides on binding to FPR and activation have been studied extensively (6Freer R.J. Day A.L. Muthukumaraswamy N. Pinon D. Wu A.

The formyl group, the methionine at position 1, and phenylalanine at position 3 have been shown to be necessary for high affinity binding. Decarboxylation of the C-terminal phenylalanine markedly reduces activity, but esters or amides of this residue or peptides with C-terminal amino acid additions exhibit similar activity to the tripeptide with the free acid. None of the fMLF functional groups have been shown to be absolutely essential for activity but rather they appear to individually contribute to the overall free energy of binding. Chemical and photoaffinity cross-linking of fMLF analogs to FPR has been achieved by a number of groups (9Niedel J. Davis J. Cuatrecasas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7063-7066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Böhm M. Gierschik P. Knorr A. Schmidt U. Weismann K. Erdmann E.

However, none of these studies have identified the site of labeling. The residue in the second position of N-formylated peptides appears to be the most tolerant of modification (6Freer R.J. Day A.L.

Showell H.J. Becker E.L. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 257-263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and both of the flanking residues are critical for high affinity binding (14Showell H.J. Freer R.J.

Med. 1976; 143: 1154-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar); so the second residue was chosen to accommodate the photoreactive amino acid benzoylphenylalanine (Bpa). Bpa is chemically stable in the absence of photoexcitation, can be directly introduced into peptide ligands by solid phase peptide synthesis, and has been photocross-linked into several peptide receptors (15Dormán G. Prestwich G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5661-5673Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Here we report that a fluorescent photoaffinity analog of fMLF, formyl-Met-p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine-Phe-Tyr-Lys-ε-N-fluorescein (fMBpaFYK-fl), efficiently photocross-links to FPR residues 83–85. Derivatization of these residues in FPR by Bpa supports recent site-directed mutagenesis studies predicting that the formyl peptide binding site of FPR lies within the transmembrane spanning region, near the transmembrane-extracellular interface of the receptor (17Miettinen H.M. Mills J. Gripentrog J. Dratz E.A. Granger B.L. Jesaitis A.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4045-4054PubMed Google Scholar). fMet-p-Benzoyl-l-phenylalanine-Phe-Tyr-Lys was synthesized from Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) amino acids using a Milligen 9050 peptide synthesizer and purified by reverse phase HPLC. Peptide (4 μmol) was suspended in dimethylformamide, 5% triethylamine, and 4 μmol of hexanoylfluorescein-N-hydroxysuccinimide (Molecular Probes) was added. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 5 min at 4 °C. The products were separated by C18 reverse phase HPLC. The desired peptide, fMBpaFYK-fl was identified by its absorbance and fluorescence spectra (in 10 mm NaCO3, pH 10.5), and its mass (m/z = 1340) measured by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) in a α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix. Samples were stored in amber vials at −20 °C. The syntheses and all manipulations were carried out under dim light. Antibodies to fluorescein isothiocyanate were prepared by injecting rabbits with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled keyhole limpet hemocyanin, as described previously (16Gollogly J.R. Cathou R.E. J. Immunol. 1974; 113: 1457-1467PubMed Google Scholar). Serum was precipitated with 50% ammonium sulfate and antibodies were purified on fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled aminohexyl-Sepharose. Purified antibodies bound ∼2 mol of fluorescein isothiocyanate-ethanolamine/mol of antibody, as assessed by its ability to quench fluorescein fluorescence. The antibodies were reacted with CNBr-activated Sepharose and cross-linked with 50 mm dimethyl pimelimidate (Pierce) in 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 10.5, for 16 h. The antifluorescein-Sepharose was washed extensively (>72 h) with phosphate-buffered saline, 1.5 m NaCl, and 50% ethylene glycol. It was washed quickly (<5 min) with 1% triethylamine, 1.5 m NaCl, 50% ethylene glycol, and equilibrated in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and 1% octyl glucoside just prior to use. The antifluorescein-Sepharose bound ∼16 pmol of fMBpaFYK-fl per μl of Sepharose. FACScan analysis was carried out as described previously by (17Miettinen H.M. Mills J. Gripentrog J. Dratz E.A. Granger B.L. Jesaitis A.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4045-4054PubMed Google Scholar). The analysis was carried out in dim light to prevent photolysis of fMBpaFYK-fl. CHO cells expressing FPR (17Miettinen H.M. Mills J. Gripentrog J. Dratz E.A. Granger B.L. Jesaitis A.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4045-4054PubMed Google Scholar) or WT CHO cells were grown in 15-cm tissue culture dishes and treated with 6 mmsodium butyrate 16 h prior to labeling. The cells were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 100 nm fMBpaFYKf for 5 min at 4 °C. The tissue culture dishes were loaded directly into a Rayonet RPR-100 UV photoreactor and exposed to UV irradiation for 15 min at 4 °C. EDTA, leupeptin, and fMLF were added to give final concentrations of 1 mm, 1 μg/ml, and 10 μm, respectively. The cells were harvested by scraping and centrifuged at 150,000 × gfor 30 min. The cell pellets were sonicated in phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μmfMLF, and 200 μm dithiothreitol (Buffer A), washed twice with 10 mm Na2CO3, pH 10.5, 0.8m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μm fMLF, and 200 μm dithiothreitol. Membranes from CHO cells expressing FPR and wild type control CHO cell membranes were prepared as described above, resuspended in 0.7 ml of Buffer A containing 3% octyl glucoside, sonicated, and centrifuged at 150,000 ×g for 30 min. The supernatant was injected onto anion exchange (Vydac 300VHP) and gel filtration (TSK GW3000) HPLC columns connected in series, and the columns were monitored for fluorescence with excitation at 490 nm and emission at 520 nm. 1 ml of 1m NaCl was injected after 60 min elution to remove material that bound to the anion exchange column. The HPLC analysis was carried out using a Hitachi 6200 HPLC system with a F-1050 fluorescence detector. Photolabeled membranes from FPR-expressing and WT CHO cells were washed with H2O, the membranes were resuspended in 200 μl of H2O, sonicated, and dissolved by addition of 800 μl of trifluoroacetic acid. 50 μmol of CNBr was added, and the reaction mixtures were incubated for 16 h at 20 °C. An additional 10 μmol of CNBr was added, and the incubation continued for an additional 8 h. The samples were frozen at −80 °C and lyophilized. The samples were resuspended in 10 mm HEPES and 1% octyl glucoside, adjusted to pH 7–8 and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was added to 30 μl of rabbit antifluorescein antibodies bound to Sepharose and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C. The Sepharose beads were washed 5 times with H2O, eluted with 1% triethylamine, 40% acetonitrile in water and lyophilized. For trypsinization, the sample was resuspended in 1% octyl glucoside, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and incubated with 1 μg of trypsin (sequencing grade, Boehringer Mannheim) for 16 h at 25 °C. 4 μg of soybean trypsin inhibitor was added, followed by the addition of 30 μl of antifluorescein immunoaffinity matrix, and the isolation procedure described above was repeated. Membranes from FPR-expressing CHO cells were harvested, sonicated, washed in Buffer A and resuspended in GTPγS binding buffer. Binding assays were performed in 1 ml of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm Mg2+, 1 μm GDP. Samples containing 30 μg of protein were preincubated with formyl peptide or analog at 30 °C for 10 min, 0.05 μCi of [35S]GTPγS (1000 Ci/mmol) was added, and the reaction continued for 6 min. The samples were filtered through BA 85 0.45-μm filters (Schleicher & Schuell), the filters were washed with 5 ml of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm Mg2+ buffer, and the bound [35S]GTPγS was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The novel synthetic fluorescent photoaffinity analog fMBpaFYK-fl activates the formyl peptide receptor more efficiently than does fMLF. Fig. 1 A shows that fMBpaFYK-fl enhanced [35S]GTPγS binding to CHO cell membranes expressing FPR with an EC50 of 3 nm. This EC50 was about 2-fold lower than that observed with fMLF (EC50 ∼ 6 nm). At saturation, both ligands increased GTPγS binding to a similar extent (∼100% increase in binding). Fig. 1 B shows FACScan measurement of the binding of fMBpaFYK-fl to FPR expressed in CHO cells. Analysis of the FACScan binding data by nonlinear least squares fit of the data to a sigmoidal curve, using Prism 2 (Graph Pad Software, Inc.), indicated that fMBpaFYK-fl bound to FPR in intact cells with a K d of 37 nm. This photoaffinity analog had a binding affinity similar to that observed with the hexapeptide, formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Tyr-Nle-Lys-fluorescein, a similar fluorescent analog of fMLF that had been previously studied (17Miettinen H.M.

Chem. 1984; 259: 5661-5669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). UV irradiation of FPR occupied with fMBpaFYK-fl, produced extensive nonreversible binding of the photoactivatable ligand, as shown in Fig. 2. After 10 min of irradiation, greater than 40% (n = 2) of the fMBpaFYK-fl was no longer displaced from FPR by fMLF under conditions that completely displaced fMBpaFYK-fl, which had not been exposed to UV light. To determine if fMBpaFYK-fl specifically photolabeled FPR, octyl glucoside-solubilized membranes from CHO cells expressing FPR or WT control CHO cells, which had both been exposed to fMBpaFYK-fl and UV irradiated, were injected onto anion exchange and gel filtration HPLC columns connected in series. The columns were monitored for fluorescein fluorescence (excitation 490 nm/emission 520 nm). 1 ml of 1m NaCl was injected at time = 60 min to remove material that bound to the anion exchange column and subject that material to size separation by gel filtration. Fig. 3 shows a large peak of fluorescein labeled protein from FPR-expressing CHO cells that was not retained by the anion exchange column (consistent with an isoelectric point of 9.4 for FPR calculated from its amino acid sequence). This peak was found to FPR by Western blot (not shown) and was completely absent in the WT controls, indicating that the fMBpaFYK-fl was specifically labeling FPR. The area under the FPR peak in Fig. 3 represented 60–70% of the eluted fluorescein fluorescence and indicated that most of the photolabeled material was in FPR. To determine the site of photocross-linking between fMBpaFYK-fl and FPR, photolabeled FPR was cleaved with CNBr and the fMBpaFYK-fl-containing adducts were identified by MALDI mass spectrometry. Fig. 4 shows a model of the transmembrane topology of FPR (17Miettinen H.M. Mills J. Gripentrog J. Dratz E.A. Granger B.L. Jesaitis A.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4045-4054PubMed Google Scholar) where the positions of the methionine CNBr cleavage sites are indicated by gray shading. The table inset shows the expected masses of the 11 possible cross-linked adducts between CNBr-digested FPR and benzoylphenylalanine-FYK-fl (BpaFYK-fl), the CNBr cleavage product of fMBpaFYK-fl. All of the expected masses of the CNBr cleavage products are sufficiently different that they can be resolved by MALDI-MS, which has a mass accuracy of about 0.1%. Since the HPLC analysis indicated that most of the photoaffinity label was incorporated into FPR, CNBr digestions were performed directly on CHO cell membranes to maximize the yield of photocross-linked peptides. To obtain sufficient photolabeled FPR for identification of CNBr fragment adduct(s) by MALDI-MS and to show that these adduct(s) were derived from FPR, 20 15- × 1-cm tissue culture plates from WT CHO cells and CHO cells expressing FPR were photolabeled with 100 nm fMBpaFYK-fl. Membranes from an equal number of cells of each type were solubilized in 1 ml of 80% trifluoroacetic acid and cleaved with CNBr. Fluoresceinated adducts from both wild type and FPR-expressing CHO cell membranes were isolated with antifluorescein immunoaffinity chromatography, as described under “Materials and Methods.” 20 and 8 pmol of cross-linked fluoresceinated peptides were isolated from FPR-expressing and WT CHO cell membranes, respectively, indicating that ∼60% (i.e. 12 of 20 pmol total) was specifically photocross-linked to FPR, in agreement with the HPLC analysis shown in Fig. 2. The material eluted from the antifluorescein antibodies was analyzed by MALDI-MS (Fig. 5, inset). Mass spectra obtained from WT cells was subtracted from that observed for FPR-expressing cells, and a typical difference spectrum is shown in Fig. 5. Three major mass peaks were observed at 1182, 1754, and 1913 Da (see Fig. 6 B for an expanded view of the difference spectrum). These values corresponded to the expected masses of BpaFYK-fluorescein (1182), BpaFYK-fl cross-linked to the FPR CNBr peptide Val-Arg-Lys-Ala-Hse (1755), and fMBpaFYK-fl (i.e. the uncleaved peptide) cross-linked to the FPR peptide Val-Arg-Lys-Ala-Hse (1913). The mean mass difference between cleaved, uncross-linked agonist peptide and the cross-linked and cleaved peptide was 573 ± 1, which is the mass of the FPR CNBr peptide Val-Arg-Lys-Ala-Hse (FPR residues 83–87). The average mass difference, representing the FPR cross-linking site, was determined from four separate CNBr cleavage reactions of cross-linked FPR, and the same mass peaks at m/z at ∼1182, 1755, and 1913 were observed in all four CNBr cleavage reactions. To confirm that the FPR sequence Val-Arg-Lys-Ala-Hse was the fMBpaFYK-fl photocross-linking site, peptides from the antifluorescein eluate were further cleaved with trypsin, purified using antifluorescein antibodies, and subjected to MALDI mass spectrometry. After trypsinization, a major mass peak of 1582 was observed (Fig. 6 C) indicating a cross-linked FPR fragment of 400 Da, very similar to the expected mass of Val-Arg-Lys (expected mass 401, FPR residues 83–85). Fig. 6 shows a comparison of the mass spectra of fMBpaFYK-fl cleaved with 10 mm CNBr (Fig. 6 A) to the CNBr cleavage product of fMBpaFYK-fl cross-linked to FPR (Fig. 6 B) and fMBpaFYK-fl cross-linked to FPR cleaved with both CNBr and trypsin (Fig. 6 C). The mass axes of Fig. 6,B and C have been shifted by 573 and 401 Da, which are the masses of Val-Arg-Lys-Ala-Hse and Val-Arg-Lys, respectively, to align them with the masses of the CNBr cleavage products of fMBpaFYK-fl. The cross-linked products in Fig. 6,B and C both show the intermediates of incomplete cleavage of fMBpaFYK-fl by CNBr as also seen in Fig. 6 A. These additional cross-linked fragments serve as fingerprints of fMBpaFYK-fl cross-linking and provide additional mass spectral peaks, which are characteristic of the agonist peptide and can thus be used to support the identification of cross-linked peptides. The ability to photoaffinity cross-link FPR with a high affinity analog of fMLF provides an opportunity to experimentally test the intramembrane ligand binding hypothesis for G protein-coupled peptide receptors (17Miettinen H.M. Mills J. Gripentrog J. Dratz E.A. Granger B.L. Jesaitis A.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4045-4054PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sklar L.A. Fay S.P. Seligman B.E. Freer R.J. Muthukumaraswamy N. Mueller H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A three-dimensional model of FPR was generated from a rhodopsin template designed by Herzyk and Hubbard (20Herzyk P. Hubbard R.E. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 2419-2442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and a space filling model of fMet-Bpa-Phe (fMBpaF) was placed between the seven transmembrane helices (Fig. 7). Two stereo views are shown in Fig. 7, a view from the extracellular space and a transmembrane view. fMBpaF was positioned between the helices to allow maximum contact with residues previously shown to be important in ligand binding (17Miettinen H.M. Mills J. Gripentrog J. Dratz E.A. Granger B.L. Jesaitis A.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4045-4054PubMed Google Scholar). By modeling fMBpaF in an extended conformation, the Bpa moiety could be placed near the site of cross-linking while maintaining interactions between fMBpaF and residues that affect binding. The methionine and phenylalanine side chains of fMBpaF, which are essential for high affinity binding, were positioned deep within the binding pocket (relative to the extracellular side), whereas the Bpa side chain was positioned nearer the extracellular space, so as to be consistent with the cross-linking data. Since studies with model compounds suggest the carbonyl carbon of the benzophenone moiety of Bpa generally reacts with another carbon within a distance of approximately 3 Å and the carbon adjacent to the ξ amino group of lysine is reported to be one of more reactive side chains toward photocross-linking with benzophenone (15Dormán G. Prestwich G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5661-5673Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar), the ξ carbon of Lys-85 was placed within 3 Å of the carbonyl oxygen of the benzophenone moiety of fMBpaF. In this position, the amine nitrogen of Lys-85 (II-24) is within 2–3 Å of the methionine carbonyl oxygen on fMBpaF, sufficiently close to form a hydrogen bond. Alternatively, Lys-85 could ion pair with Asp-284 and still be close enough to the carbonyl oxygen of the benzophenone moiety of fMBpaF to photocross-link effectively. In the present model, neither of the sidechains of Val-83 or Arg-84 appear to be sufficiently close to the benzophenone carbonyl of fMBpaF to be likely sites of cross-linking, but their backbone moieties might be close enough to cross-link efficiently. The present data does not distinguish between cross-linking to the three residues (83–85), and additional studies will be needed to delineate the exact site(s) of interaction. We have previously shown that mutation of FPR Leu-78 (II-17; helix II, residue 17 from the N terminus of the helix) or Phe-291 (VII-11) to Ala markedly reduced ligand binding (17Miettinen H.M. Mills J. Gripentrog J. Dratz E.A. Granger B.L. Jesaitis A.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4045-4054PubMed Google Scholar). These residues are 2 helical turns toward the cytoplasmic side of the membrane from Lys-85 (II-24) and Asp-284 (VII-4), respectively. TableI shows the sequences of the residues of human FPR surrounding Lys-85 (II-24) and Asp-284 (VII-4) aligned with the analogous residues of rabbit, mouse, gorilla, and macaque FPRs. Also shown are the homologous sequences of other closely related chemotactic GPCR's; lipoxin A4 receptor (LPXA4R), C5a receptor, interleukin 8 and 8A receptors (ILA8R and ILA8AR) and a human coreceptor for HIV (CCR5). These receptors either have Lys at position II-24 and Asp at position VII-4 (underlined in Table I) or they lack both Lys and Asp at these positions. The correlation in occurrence of these two residues suggests that they might interact in the structure, possibly by forming an ion pair. This ion pair might be similar to the putative ion pair between Glu-113 (III-3) and Lys-296 (VII-11) in opsin (21Robinson P.R. Cohen G.B. Zhukovsky E.A. Oprian D.D. Neuron. 1992; 9: 719-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) or Asp-103 (III-7) and Lys-331 (VII-4) in the α1B adrenergic receptor (22Porter J.E. Hwa J. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 271: 28318-28323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Both of these putative ion pairs are thought to be important in maintaining these receptors in their inactive conformation, since mutation of either of the residues involved in the ion pairs results in constitutively active receptors (21Robinson P.R. Cohen G.B. Zhukovsky E.A. Oprian D.D. Neuron. 1992; 9: 719-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 22Porter J.E. Hwa J. Perez D.M. J. Biol.

Both human and rabbit FPRs bind fMLF with high affinity and both contain Lys at position II-24 and Asp at position VII-4, whereas mouse FPR, human LXA4R, and human FPRL2 bind fMLF with much lower affinity, and these three receptors all lack both Lys at position II-24 and Asp at position VII-4 (23Ye R.D.

If, in fact, Lys-85 and Asp-284 do form an ion pair in FPR and ligand binding serves to disrupt such pairing, then Lys-85 might be positioned well to interact with the benzophenone carbonyl as is shown in Fig. 7.Table IAlignment of sequences of representative chemotactic receptors near the extracellular interfaces of helix II and helix VIIHelix IIHelix VIIReference⇓⇓Human FPR17LPFFMVRKAM261IAVDVTS745Boulay F.

Site-directed mutagenesis of the neurokinin-1 and neurokinin-2 receptors identified four residues in the putative second transmembrane helix as important in the binding of substance P and neurokinin A, respectively, to these receptors (26Huang R.R. Yu H. Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3007-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 27Huang R.R.C. Vicario P.P. Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10048-10055Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). One of the residues identified as important in ligand binding in the two receptors, Tyr-92 (Tyr-93), is analogous to Lys-85 in FPR, is the most likely ligand cross-linking site in FPR in our experiments. Another residue important for ligand binding in the two receptors, Asn-85 (Asn-86), is analogous to Leu-78 in FPR. The neuropeptide Y receptor also contains a Tyr in an analogous position to Lys-85 in FPR. Mutation of this residue to Phe substantially reduced the binding of neuropeptide Y to the neuropeptide Y receptor suggesting that the OH group of Tyr makes an important hydrogen bond with ligand (28Sautel M. Rudolf K. Wittneben H. Herzog H. Martinez R. Munoz M. Eberlein W. Engel W. Walker P. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 285-292PubMed Google Scholar). The lutropin/chorionic gonadotropin receptor has also been analyzed at the analogous position in helix II (29Ji I. Zeng H. Ji T.H. J Biol Chem. 1993; 268: 22971-22974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the lutropin/chorionic gonadotropin receptor case, mutation of Asp in this position to Lys did not alter ligand affinity, but completely blocked ligand activation of adenylate cyclase. A complimentary mutation of a Lys residue in the normal peptide ligand (Lys → Asp) resulted in a ligand which would activate the Asp → Lys receptor mutant but not the WT or the Asp → Ala receptor mutant. This was strong evidence that a complementary interaction between ligand and the receptor residue in the position analogous to Lys-85 in FPR was essential for receptor activation. Evidence for the location of the ligand binding sites of many GPCR has been provided using site-directed mutagenesis. However, very few of these sites have been analyzed directly by ligand cross-linking. An important residue in the binding site of the β adrenergic receptor was identified as Trp-330 (VII-8) by photoaffinity labeling with iodocyanopindolol-diazirine (30Kurtenbach E. Curtis C.A. Pedder E.K. Aitken A. Harris A.C.M. Hulme E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13702-13708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Both of these sites, as is the case for the ligand binding site of FPR, map to transmembrane regions near the extracellular face of these receptors. The ligand binding sites on FPR, the β adrenergic receptor, and the muscarinic receptor, all map to a region very similar to that found for the retinal binding site of rhodopsin (32Wang J.K.

A 1260-base DNA segment encoding Lys354–Lys774 of the rat α1-subunit was constructed via polymerase chain reaction. The polymerase chain reaction product was successfully subcloned into the expression vector pET-28 (Novagen), which produces an N-terminal 6-histidine-tagged fusion protein. The pET-28 vector containing rat α-loop, i.e. pAN, was used to transform calcium-competent E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, and positive clones were selected by kanamycin resistance. Bacterial cultures were grown, and protein synthesis was induced with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside. Cells were harvested and lysed, revealing production of the His-tagged fusion protein (∼46 kDa). The fusion protein was affinity-purified from other soluble cellular proteins via a Ni-NTA column, which routinely yielded ∼20 mg of soluble His6-α-loop/L cell culture. The His6-α-loop retained significant native structure, as evidenced by the ability of ATP and ADP (but not AMP, CTP, GTP, or UTP) to protect against chemical modification by either fluorescein isothiocyanate or maleimidylanilinonapthalene sulfonic acid. More specifically, circular dichroism spectroscopy was used to estimate the secondary structure of the His6 loop, revealing an ordered folding composed of 23% α-helix, 23% antiparallel β-sheet, 4% parallel β-sheet, 19% β-turn, and 32% random coil. The 6-histidine loop bound the fluorescent ATP analog trinitrophenyl-ATP with high affinity, as determined by measuring the fluorescence changes associated with binding. Affinities for ATP (∼350 μm) and ADP (∼550 μm) were determined by their ability to compete with and displace 2′,3′-O-[2,4,6,-trinitrophenyl]-ATP. These nucleotide affinities are similar to those observed for the E2conformation of the intact Na,K-ATPase. Escherichia coli was used to overexpress the large cytoplasmic loop of the rat Na,K-ATPase.

These nucleotide affinities are similar to those observed for the E2conformation of the intact Na,K-ATPase. The Na,K-ATPase (3.6.1.37) is an integral membrane protein that is responsible for maintaining ionic homeostasis in animal cells by mediating the active translocation of sodium and potassium ions against their electrochemical gradients across the plasma membrane. The ion gradients produced by the sodium pump are important for cell excitability and contractility, as well as for regulation of other intracellular ion and solute concentrations. The current model for the sodium pump cycle is conserved for other ion pumps, e.g. the plasma membrane and sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pumps, the gastric hydrogen/potassium pump, and the Neurospora proton pump. These ion pumps make up the enzyme class known as the P-type ATPases. Although much information has been gathered about the kinetic mechanism of the sodium pump, there is still rather little detail known about the structure of the protein. The sodium pump exists as a functional heterodimeric protein consisting of a catalytic α-subunit (∼110 kDa) and a smaller, glycosylated β-subunit (∼55 kDa). Both subunits have been cloned, and the primary structure has been determined in several isoforms from a variety of species (1Lingrel J.B Kuntzweiler T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19659-19662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, even after extensive study for several decades, information about the specific amino acids involved in formation of the binding sites for physiological ligands is rudimentary. Although the detailed topology of the α-subunit of the sodium pump is still the subject of investigation, an overall consensus on structure is emerging; it shows 10 transmembrane segments (3Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). All the residues implicated with ATP binding thus far have been localized to the major cytoplasmic loop, which is composed of about 430 amino acid residues between transmembrane segments M4 and M5 (2Kaplan J.H. Kaplan J.H. De Weer P. The Sodium Pump: Structure, Mechanism, and Regulation. The Rockefeller University Press, New York1991: 117-128Google Scholar). Moreover, this loop contains four of the most highly conserved P-type ATPase sequences (3Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Much of the information suggesting the involvement of various amino acid residues with pump function comes from chemical modification experiments. Such studies have identified a number of residues in the M4M5 loop thought to be involved in ATP binding. For example, Lys480, Lys501, Gly502, Asp710, Asp714 and Lys719 are all modified by a variety of chemical agents in the absence of ATP but not in its presence, suggesting a role in ATP binding (4Pedemonte C.H. Kaplan J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C1-C23Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In subsequent studies, some of these residues were changed via mutagenesis with little or no effect on enzyme activity (1Lingrel J.B Kuntzweiler T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19659-19662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, measurements of overall enzyme activity only provide information on whether the mutated residue is absolutely essential for function, but they do not necessarily address whether the residue is involved directly in ATP binding. For example, mutation of Asp369 (i.e.the site of phosphorylation), not surprisingly, abolishes enzyme activity (5Johnson C.L. Kuntzweiler T.A. Lingrel J.B Johnson C.G. Wallick E.T. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), but interestingly, mutation of this residue increases the ATP binding affinity (6Pedersen P.A. Rasmussen J.H. Jorgensen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2514-2522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Consequently, to determine whether a residue is important for ATP binding one must directly measure ATP binding and characterize its affinity. The only approach that will identify ATP contact residues is to crystallize the protein in the presence of substrate. Unfortunately, crystallographic analysis of integral membrane proteins still remains difficult because generally applicable strategies for obtaining x-ray quality crystals of these molecules do not yet exist. As an approach to achieving this aim, we describe the bacterial production and purification of a soluble polypeptide corresponding to the large cytoplasmic loop of the Na,K-ATPase. This soluble protein is able to bind ATP, as evidenced by the ability of ATP to prevent modification by both fluorescein 5′-isothiocyanate (FITC) 1The abbreviations used are: FITC, fluorescein 5′-isothiocyanate; TNP-ATP, 2′,3′-O-[2,4,6,-trinitrophenyl]adenosine 5′-triphosphate; MIANS, 2-[4′maleimidylanilino]napthalene-6-sulfonic acid; IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside; MOPS, morpholinepropanesulfuric acid; LB, Luria broth; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; SDS, sodium dodecyl sulfate; His6 loop, 6-histidine-tagged M4M5 cytoplasmic loop from the rat Na,K-ATPase α1-subunit; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; SITS, 4-acetamido-4′-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid. and 2-[4′maleimidylanilino]napthalene-6-sulfonic acid (MIANS), two fluorescent probes previously demonstrated to label the M4M5 loop of the full-length Na,K-ATPase in an ATP-protectable fashion. In addition, we used 2′,3′-O-[2,4,6,-trinitrophenyl]adenosine 5′-triphosphate (TNP-ATP) fluorescence to estimate, by competition with ATP, the ATP binding affinity to this segment of the sodium pump. A preliminary report of some of this work was presented at the Eighth International Meeting on the sodium pump (7Kaplan J.H. Lutsenko S. Gatto C. Daoud S. Kenney L.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

(pCR-Script confers ampicillin resistance and contains a portion of the lacZ gene encoding the β-galactosidase gene product providing blue-white color selection of recombinant plasmids.) Calcium competent (8Maniatis T. Fritsch E. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 1.82-1.84Google Scholar) E. coli DH5α cells were transformed with the ligation mixture, and positive colonies were selected on LBamp agar plates containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside and IPTG. White colonies were selected and grown overnight in LBamp, and the DNA was isolated via minipreparation techniques (Bio-Rad and Qiagen DNA miniprep kits). Restriction endonuclease mapping revealed positive clones, which were subsequently sequenced to verify that no random mutations occurred during the PCR. The cloned M4M5 loop was released from pCR-Script by digesting with NdeI and EcoRI; these unique restriction sites were engineered into the oligonucleotide primers (see above). The 6-histidine fusion protein vector, pET-28 (Novagen), was also digested with EcoRI and NdeI. A ligation reaction was performed after gel purifying both DNA fragments at a ratio of 10:1 (insert to vector) using T4 DNA ligase (1 unit/10 ng of DNA) at 25 °C for 1 h. The cloned product, called pAN, was subsequently transformed into competent DH5α cells and selected by the kanamycin resistance conferred by pET-28. DH5α cells have a higher efficiency for transformation with ligation reactions than do BL21 cells. Therefore, we used DH5α cells for initial transformations and long term storage of vectors as glycerol stocks, whereas we preferred BL21(DE3) cells for protein expression. The constructed pAN expression vector was used to transform calcium competent BL21 (DE3) cells. The E. coli transformants were selected on LBkan (30 μg/ml) agar plates. A single colony was picked to grow overnight in 5 ml of LBkan, and this culture was subsequently used to inoculate 1 liter of LBkancontaining a final concentration of 2% ethanol. After the culture grew to an A 600 of 0.8–1.0, 1 mm IPTG was added to induce the synthesis of protein from the lac promoter and grown further at 25 °C to an A of ∼2.0. Cells were then collected and suspended in 30 ml of a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, with a hand-held homogenizer. A 10-mg quantity of lysozyme was added in the presence of 150 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (serine protease inhibitor), and the mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min, with occasional plunging of the homogenizer. After addition of 40 mg of deoxycholic acid, the suspension was heated to 37 °C with constant stirring. Once the suspension became viscous and difficult to stir, 200 μl of deoxyribonuclease (1 mg/ml) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 25 °C until the suspension was no longer viscous (∼30 min). A final concentration of 1% Triton X-100 was added, and the cell lysate was incubated for an additional 30 min at 25 °C. The soluble fraction was separated from the membranous fractions by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. Expression of the His6 loop was verified by running a sample of the soluble cell lysate on a 10% Laemmli gel and electroblotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (10 mm CAPS, pH 11.0, 45 min). The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was screened with a 1:1000 dilution of a 6-histidine antibody (Qiagen) revealing a protein (∼46 kDa) from the lysate of IPTG-induced cells only. A 4-ml slurry of His-Bind resin (nitriloacetic acid-agarose, Novagen) was placed into a 5-ml column; after the resin settled, a bed volume of 2 ml remained. The column was washed with 10 bed volumes of sterile deionized H2O and then charged with nickel by adding 5 bed volumes of 50 mm NiSO4. Unbound Ni2+ was washed away with 5 bed volumes of binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9). One-third of the soluble cell lysate (∼10 ml) was applied to the Ni2+-column. The column was subsequently washed with 5 bed volumes of binding buffer to remove nonspecifically bound E. coli proteins. The desired His6 loop protein was eluted from the Ni2+-column with a linear imidazole gradient from 50 to 400 mm in a buffer containing 500 mm NaCl and 20 mm Tris (pH 7.9). Twenty-five 1.5-ml fractions were collected (0.5–0.75 ml/min flow rate, gravity flow) over 45–60 min and analyzed for protein content by the method of Bradford (9Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Protein-containing fractions were further analyzed via SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (i.e. 10% Laemmli gel). The desired product was routinely recovered over 5–6 fractions ranging from ∼125 to 250 mm imidazole. The purity varied slightly between preparations; only preparations that were ≥95% pure (based upon densitometry of the Coomassie-stained peptide bands) were used for experimental measurements. An aliquot (10–20 μg) of the purified dog kidney Na,K-ATPase or the bacterially produced His6 loop was incubated with either 5 μm FITC or 50 μm MIANS for 10 min at 25 °C in 20 μl of a buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, and 5 mm of either ATP, ADP, AMP, CTP, GTP, or UTP as indicated in the corresponding figure (Fig. 3,A and B). For experiments testing whether FITC or MIANS could label denatured protein, the protein was incubated in the presence of 1% SDS prior to the chemical treatment. The chemical modification reactions were stopped by the addition of 40 μl of Laemmli sample buffer containing (at a 1:1:1 ratio) 10% SDS, 8m urea, and 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.8) and a 5% final concentration of β-mercaptoethanol. The entire 60-μl sample volume was loaded and run on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel according to the method of Laemmli (10Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). FITC-labeled bands were visualized under UV illumination (366 nm), and then proteins were fixed and stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in 10% acetic acid. TNP-ATP binding to the His6loop was performed essentially as described by Moczydlowski and Fortes (18Moczydlowski E.G. Fortes P.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2357-2366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for TNP-ATP binding to Na,K-ATPase with minor changes. Briefly, fluorescence changes were measured in quartz cuvettes on a model PTI-QM1 (Photon Technology International, Monmouth Junction, NJ) steady state fluorometer. The excitation wavelength was 410 nm (5 nm width), and the emission wavelength was 545 nm (2 nm width). Aliquots of a 1 mm TNP-ATP stock solution were titrated into a 1-ml solution of 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.5) containing 100 μg of His6 loop maintained at 25 °C. The same TNP-ATP additions were made into buffer only. The difference between the protein-containing and protein-free solution revealed the fluorescence increases due to interactions between TNP-ATP and the His6loop. Competition with nucleotides was measured by titrating aliquots from a 25 mm stock of ATP, ADP, or AMP into a 1-ml solution of 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.5) containing 1 μm TNP-ATP and 10 μm His6 loop. The high protein to TNP-ATP ratio was to ensure that essentially all of the TNP-ATP was bound prior to the nucleotide additions. If there is a significant portion of TNP-ATP in solution, it is difficult to detect the TNP-ATP that is displaced from the His6 loop by the competing nucleotides. Titrations of the TNP-ATP/His6 loop solution with buffer were made to determine the fluorescence changes caused by dilution. Subtraction of the dilution effect from the nucleotide titration experiments revealed the fluorescence changes associated with the nucleotide-induced TNP-ATP displacement from the His6loop. CD spectra were taken on a JASCO J-500 A spectrophotometer. Measurements were made using a 0.1-mm path length cell (Helma) at a constant temperature of 20 °C. Data were collected on an IBM/PC-XT using the IF-2 interface; software was provided by Jasco. Spectra and buffer baselines were the average of 10 scans, each recorded at 0.1-nm intervals, using a scanning rate of 5 nm/min and a 2-s time constant. The protein concentration was determined by amino acid analysis and was approximately 2.0 mg/ml. Before spectral deconvolution for secondary structure analysis, the buffer baseline was subtracted and the resulting spectrum was smoothed using the program provided by Jasco. The secondary structure of the His6 loop was computed using the singular-value and variable-selection methods of Compton et al. (11Compton L.A. Mathews C.K. Johnson Jr., W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13039-13043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our goal was to characterize the isolated ATP binding domain of the Na,K-ATPase. As a means to this end, we developed a method to produce large quantities of a soluble peptide corresponding to the cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane segments M4 and M5 (i.e. from Lys354 to Lys774, rat α1 subunit). The plasmid pAN was constructed by inserting the cDNA encoding the rat α1 M4M5 cytoplasmic loop into pET-28 multiple cloning site at the ndeI (5′) and the EcoRI (3′) restriction site locations downstream from the histidine coding sequence (Fig. 1). pAN was used to transform a BL21(DE3) E. coli strain. For induction of gene expression, cells were grown in 1 liter of LBkan medium containing a final ethanol concentration of 2%, and fusion protein production was induced with IPTG. (The presence of ethanol significantly increased the amount of fusion protein in the soluble fraction.) This process routinely yielded significant production of the His6 loop fusion protein (molecular mass, ∼46 kDa) with approximately 40% associated with the soluble fraction (Fig. 2). The His6 loop was purified via a Ni-NTA affinity column (∼20–25 mg/liter; Fig. 2). FITC is a fluorescent amine-reactive molecule that labels Lys501 in the purified Na,K-ATPase; this reaction is prevented by the simultaneous presence of ATP (12Farley R.A. Tran M.C. Carilli C.T. Hawke D. Shively J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9532-9535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kirley T.L. Wallick E.T. Lane L.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 125: 767-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this study, we used ATP protection against FITC labeling as a tool to demonstrate that ATP binds to His6 loop (Fig. 3 A). It is clear that after incubation with 5 μm FITC, both the purified Na,K-ATPase and the His6 loop were labeled by FITC. Moreover, when the FITC incubation was performed in the presence of either 5 mm ATP or 5 mm AMP, only ATP (not AMP) prevented FITC modification of both the intact purified sodium pump and the His6 loop (Fig. 3 A). To further investigate the nucleotide specificity of the His6 loop, we tested the ability of several nucleotides to protect against FITC modification (Fig. 3 B). Purified His6 loop was incubated with 5 μm FITC in the presence of 5 mm ATP, ADP, AMP, GTP, and UTP. It is clear that both ATP and ADP protected against FITC, whereas AMP, CTP, GTP, and UTP were unable to prevent FITC modification. These data are in agreement with the nucleotide specificity demonstrated for the purified Na,K-ATPase, which has been shown to bind ATP and ADP with high affinity, (14Jensen J. Norby J.G. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 233: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that the His6 loop retains the structural parameters that confer nucleotide specificity in the intact enzyme. The structural integrity of the His6 loop was directly reflected by the structural requirement for FITC modification,i.e. after we denatured the His6 loop with 1% SDS, incubation with FITC failed to modify the peptide (Fig. 4). Similar results were observed when we denatured purified dog Na,K-ATPase with 1% SDS (Fig. 4). These results are not due to an anomalous effect of SDS on the FITC reaction; FITC was also unable to modify the His6 loop after denaturation with 6 m guanidine-HCl or by repeated freezing and thawing (data not shown). More directly, the overall secondary structure of the His6loop fusion protein was estimated by CD spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 5, the resultant spectrum, which summarizes the mean residue molar ellipticity as a function of wavelength, exhibits a maximum at 188 nm and two minima, one at 206 nm and the other at 221 nm. The spectrum is the average of 10 scans, the general shape of which did not change. Analysis of the CD spectrum of the His6 loop, calculated using the singular-value decomposition method (11Compton L.A. Mathews C.K. Johnson Jr., W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13039-13043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), predicts secondary structural elements distributed approximately as 23% α-helix, 23% antiparallel β-sheet, 4% parallel β-sheet, 19% β-turn, and 32% random coil. The total of the fractions in this method is not constrained to be 100%, but rather should lie between 95 and 105%. The observation that the components sum to close to 100% indicates that the fusion protein is highly structured as assessed by this technique. Recently, the fluorescent sulfhydryl reagent MIANS was shown to inactivate the dog kidney Na,K-ATPase by specifically labeling a cysteine residue in the M4M5 loop of the Na,K-ATPase (15Kaplan J.H. Gatto C. Holden J.P. Thornewell S.J. Acta. Scand. Physiol. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). Both MIANS labeling and enzyme inactivation were prevented by the simultaneous presence of ATP. 2S. J. Thornewell, J. P. Holden, and J. H. Kaplan, manuscript in preparation. In this study, we tested whether ATP was able to protect against MIANS modification of the His6 loop. Indeed, ATP, but not AMP prevented MIANS labeling of the bacterially produced His6 loop (Fig. 6). However, unlike FITC, MIANS does label the denatured peptide, but ATP no longer protects against its modification (Fig. 6). The simplest explanation for a lack of ATP protection is that there is no longer significant structure to bind ATP. The interactions of the His6 loop and TNP-ATP were studied. This fluorescent ATP analog has been shown to bind with high affinity to the native Na,K-ATPase, as well as to other members of the P-type ATPase family (17Moczydlowski E.G. Fortes P.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2346-2356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Moczydlowski E.G. Fortes P.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2357-2366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Dupont Y. Chapron Y. Pougeuis R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 106: 1272-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). TNP-ATP is a useful fluorescent probe for studying the nucleotide binding site because its fluorescence changes significantly on binding. When an aliquot of His6 loop was added to a solution containing 5 μm TNP-ATP, it resulted in an enhancement of the TNP-ATP fluorescence consistent with TNP-ATP binding to the engineered protein (Fig. 7). The addition of ATP to a solution containing His6 loop and TNP-ATP resulted in a decrease in the fluorescent signal, as would be expected if ATP displaced TNP-ATP from the His6 loop (Fig. 7). The apparent binding affinity of the His6 loop for TNP-ATP was determined by titrating small aliquots of TNP-ATP into a solution containing His6 loop. Plotting the fluorescence change against [TNP-ATP] showed that the binding of TNP-ATP to the His-tagged construct was composed of two parts: a saturable component and a nonsaturable component (Fig. 8 A). Subtraction of the nonsaturable component from all the data revealed the fluorescence changes due to specific TNP-ATP binding (Fig. 8 B). The apparent affinity of the His6 loop for TNP-ATP was ∼3 μm (Table I).Table IApparent affinities of nucleotides for the purified His 6 loopNucleotideApparent K d for His6 loopμmTNP-ATP3.21 ± 0.92ATP368 ± 123ADP564 ± 139AMPNone1-aNo evidence of saturable binding to 3 mm.1-a No evidence of saturable binding to 3 mm. Open table in a new tab The apparent affinities for ATP, ADP, and AMP were determined from their ability to displace bound TNP-ATP from the His6 loop. For these experiments, a 10-fold molar excess of the His6loop protein compared with TNP-ATP was used to ensure that all (i.e. >99%) of the TNP-ATP was bound and that the contribution from the nonsaturable TNP-ATP binding component was zero (20Hellen E.H. Pratap P.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 834: 439-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The competition of TNP-ATP binding by nucleotides is evidenced by a decrease in fluorescence intensity upon the release of TNP-ATP from the His6 loop. A plot of [nucleotide] versuspercentage of change in fluorescence from a typical experiment is shown in Fig. 9. The apparent K d values for ATP and ADP were ∼350 μm and ∼550 μm, respectively (Table I). AMP showed no saturable binding in the concentration range examined. For each nucleotide, the binding experiments were performed on three separate preparations of His6 loop with comparable results. We have produced a soluble polypeptide by bacterial overexpression that is identical in sequence with the central loop of the rat α1-subunit. We have shown that the peptide binds ATP and ADP, but not other nucleoside triphosphates, with the same specificity as native Na,K-ATPase. This highly ordered peptide also shows labeling and protection reactions characteristic of the intact Na,K-ATPase. Chemical modification experiments (4Pedemonte C.H. Kaplan J.H. Am. J.

Common tubulin inhibitors, such as colchicine, colcemid, benomyl, and vinblastine, had no effect on Ca2+-promoted GTP-dependent assembly of FtsZ into polymers. However, the hydrophobic probe 5,5′-bis-(8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate) (bis-ANS) inhibited FtsZ assembly. The potential mechanisms for inhibition are discussed. Titrations of FtsZ with bis-ANS indicated that FtsZ has one high affinity binding site and multiple low affinity binding sites. ANS (8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate), a hydrophobic probe similar to bis-ANS, had no inhibitory effect on FtsZ assembly. Because tubulin assembly has also been shown to be inhibited by bis-ANS but not by ANS, it supports the idea that FtsZ and tubulin share similar conformational properties. Ca2+, which promotes GTP-dependent FtsZ assembly, stimulated binding of bis-ANS or ANS to FtsZ, suggesting that Ca2+ binding induces changes in the hydrophobic conformation of the protein. Interestingly, depletion of bound Ca2+ with EGTA further enhanced bis-ANS fluorescence. These findings suggest that both binding and dissociation of Ca2+ are capable of inducing FtsZ conformational changes, and these changes could promote the GTP-dependent assembly of FtsZ.

The key bacterial cell division protein FtsZ is widespread among all prokaryotes. It is essential for cell division and assembles into a ring-like structure at the site of cytokinesis (1Bi E.

Despite its actin-like behavior in the cell, FtsZ is biochemically quite similar to tubulin. FtsZ proteins share limited primary sequence homology with tubulin, but more importantly, they can bind and hydrolyze GTP and assemble into polymers, such as sheets of tubulin-like protofilaments and minirings as determined by electron microscopic analysis (9de Boer P. Crossley R. Rothfield L. Nature. 1992; 359: 254-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 10Erickson H.P.

Park J.T. Nature. 1992; 359: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). FtsZ polymers have not yet been visualized in vivo, making it impossible to verify the physiological relevance of such structures. Secondary structural prediction suggests that FtsZ and tubulin share 70–80% similarity, with the exception of their short carboxyl termini (14de Pereda J.M. Leynadier D. Evangelio J.A. Chacon P. Andreu J.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14203-14215Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Therefore, the overall three-dimensional structures of FtsZ monomers and tubulin are likely to be very similar. Because many inhibitors of tubulin assembly exist, investigating the effects of tubulin inhibitors on FtsZ assembly should provide important information for FtsZ structure and function. Tubulin inhibitors have been classified into four categories: (i) colchicine and its structural analogues, such as colcemid and podophyllotoxin; (ii) vinblastine and its analogues vincristine and maytansine; (iii) the metal ions Ca2+, Cu2+, and Hg2+ (15Wilson L. Bryan J. DuPraw E.J. Advances in Cell and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, New York1974: 21-72Google Scholar, 16Dustin P. Microtubules. Springer-Verlag, New York1984: 171-233Crossref Google Scholar); and (iv) aminonaphthalenes, such as bis-ANS 1The abbreviations used are: ANS, 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate; GFP, green fluorescent protein. (17Mazumdar M. Parrack P.K. Mukhopadhyay K. Bhattacharyya B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6470-6474Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Different inhibitors bind to tubulin at different sites and presumably arrest tubulin assembly by different mechanisms (17Mazumdar M. Parrack P.K. Mukhopadhyay K. Bhattacharyya B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6470-6474Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We previously developed a simple in vitro assay for FtsZ assembly using a FtsZ-green fluorescent protein fusion (FtsZ-GFP) (18Yu X.-C. Margolin W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5455-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). By using this assay, we demonstrated that FtsZ is capable of microtubule-like dynamic assembly and can self-assemble into structures that are similar to microtubule asters. This assembly is strictly dependent on GTP. In addition, there is a striking difference in the effects of Ca2+ on FtsZ and tubulin assembly. Whereas tubulin assembly into microtubules is strongly inhibited by Ca2+, millimolar concentrations of Ca2+ specifically promote assembly of FtsZ into polymer networks. The polymers are composed of bundles of protofilaments that are structurally similar to those observed by electron microscopic analysis, and their ability to grow and interconnect in a GTP-dependent manner suggests that they are physiologically relevant structures. The stimulatory effect of Ca2+ suggests that Ca2+ interacts with FtsZ, but with different effects on protein conformation than with tubulin. The mechanism of Ca2+ stimulation of FtsZ assembly is unknown, as is any possible role of Ca2+ for FtsZ assembly in the cell. Here, we use the fluorescent assembly assay and other analytical techniques to test the effects of some tubulin inhibitors on FtsZ assembly. We show that colchicine, colcemid, benomyl, and vinblastine have no effect on Ca2+-induced FtsZ polymerization, suggesting that FtsZ interacts with these drugs in a manner distinct from that of tubulin. However, we show that another tubulin inhibitor, bis-ANS, effectively inhibits FtsZ polymerization, and its possible mechanism of action is investigated and discussed. Because bis-ANS is a fluorescent probe that measures protein hydrophobic surface properties, we used bis-ANS and a related compound, ANS, to probe directly for FtsZ conformational changes induced by Ca2+ binding and dissociation. Bis-ANS was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. ANS, colchicine, colcemid, vinblastine, and GTP were purchased from Sigma, and radiolabeled GTP was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Benomyl was obtained from DuPont. Other chemicals were of analytical grade or better. Molecular mass markers were from Life Technologies, Inc. The concentrations of ANS and bis-ANS in stock solution (dissolved in H2O) were determined using ε350 = 4900 and ε385 = 16,790m−1 cm−1, respectively. FtsZ and FtsZ-GFP proteins were overexpressed and purified from strains WM688 and WM617, respectively, as described previously (18Yu X.-C. Margolin W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5455-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The glycerol and EDTA in the protein preparation were removed by loading the protein onto a small DEAE-Sephacel column; washing with 20 volumes of 50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 0.1 m KCl; and eluting with the same buffer containing 1 m NaCl. The protein peak was then pooled and dialyzed against the above buffer. Protein concentration was determined with the bicinchoninic acid method (19Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The protein concentration of the same FtsZ sample was also determined by quantitative amino acid analysis on an Applied Biosystems 420A analyzer. The measured amino acid composition is consistent with the composition predicted from the DNA sequence. When two protein dilutions were measured in duplicate assays, the bicinchoninic acid method gave a concentration of 0.997 ± 0.002 mg/ml, whereas the quantitative amino acid analysis gave a concentration of 1.14 ± 0.03 mg/ml. Therefore, a factor of 1.14 was used to calibrate the bicinchoninic acid assay. The fluorescent microscopic assay for FtsZ polymerization was described previously (18Yu X.-C. Margolin W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5455-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Briefly, FtsZ-GFP or a mix of FtsZ and FtsZ-GFP at 5.7 μm was incubated in assembly buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm GTP, 10 mmCaCl2) at 37 °C for 5–10 min. In some cases, the GTP concentrations were varied. Four μl of sample were then loaded onto a glass slide and visualized with an Olympus BX60 fluorescence microscope equipped with a × 100 oil immersion plan fluorite objective (numerical aperture = 1.3), a 100-W mercury lamp, a standard fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set, and an Optronics DEI-750 cooled video camera. Images were digitized with a Scion LG3 video card, manipulated with Adobe Photoshop, and printed on a Tektronix Phaser 400 dye sublimation printer. For light scattering assays, 5.7 μm FtsZ in 1 ml of the same buffer without CaCl2 was incubated at room temperature for 3 min, and then CaCl2 was added to initiate the polymerization. Light scattering at 600 nm was recorded continuously for 10 min. To test the effect of tubulin inhibitors on FtsZ polymerization, the compounds at different concentrations were added to the polymerization buffer. The binding of bis-ANS or ANS to FtsZ protein was monitored by bis-ANS or ANS fluorescence intensity and the shift of λmax. Unless otherwise specified, protein at 1.14–22.8 μm was incubated with different amount of bis-ANS or ANS (up to 100 μm) in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 m KCl for 30 min. The bis-ANS or ANS fluorescence emission spectra were recorded on a Photon Technology International spectrophotometer. Both excitation and emission bandwidths were 2 nm. The excitation wavelengths for bis-ANS and ANS were 390 and 381 nm, respectively. The stoichiometry and affinity of bis-ANS binding to FtsZ were determined using a double titration method (20Prasad A.R. Luduena R.F. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 739-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 21Horowitz P.M. Criscimagna N.L. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2587-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and Scatchard Plot analysis (22Ploug M. Ellis V. Dano K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8991-8997Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, bis-ANS at several fixed concentrations was titrated with different concentrations of FtsZ and vice versa. The common intersection points on the double reciprocal plots of the fluorescence intensities versus the concentration of the varied components gave the values of K d/n or K d, where n is the number of bis-ANS binding sites and K d is the dissociation constant. The fluorescence emission was recorded at a fixed wavelength of 480 nm. The observed fluorescence intensities were corrected for the low background fluorescence of bis-ANS in buffer and for the inner filter effect of varying concentrations of bis-ANS (22Ploug M. Ellis V. Dano K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8991-8997Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). For Scatchard plot analysis, the concentration of bound bis-ANS was determined from the relationship [bis-ANS] B = F/F max, where F max is the theoretical fluorescence of a molar solution if all of the ligand were bound to FtsZ.F max was calculated by titration of 1 μm bis-ANS with different concentrations of FtsZ. The intercept of the double reciprocal plot of fluorescence intensity versus FtsZ concentration gave the reciprocal of F max. The data thus generated were analyzed by the Scatchard method. Photoincorporation of bis-ANS to FtsZ was performed as described previously (23Seale J.W. Martinez J.L. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7443-7449Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, FtsZ at 1.14–5.7 μm was incubated with 10–50 μmbis-ANS in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 0.1 m KCl for 30 min on ice, 2 cm from a UV light source. Protein samples were then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fluorescent bands representing bis-ANS bound to FtsZ were photographed by an IS1000 digital imaging system (Alpha Innotech Corp.) with a UV light box. The UV cross-linking of GTP to FtsZ was performed as described previously (18Yu X.-C. Margolin W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5455-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). To study the structural and functional similarity between FtsZ and tubulin, we assessed the effect of tubulin inhibitors on FtsZ polymerization. Initially, the most common tubulin inhibitors, colchicine, colcemid, benomyl, and vinblastine, were tested for their effects on Ca2+-promoted FtsZ assembly into protofilament bundle networks. These drugs, even at concentrations up to 500 μm or higher, had no significant effect on assembly under our conditions (data not shown). This suggests that the interaction of these drugs with FtsZ is distinct from their interaction with tubulin. The effects on FtsZ assembly of another group of tubulin inhibitors, such as ANS and bis-ANS, was also examined. Whereas FtsZ formed polymer networks in the absence of bis-ANS (Fig. 1 A), 50 μmbis-ANS was sufficient to prevent polymer formation (Fig. 1 B). It should be noted that polymer networks shown in Fig. 1 A were also typical of those observed after addition of the tubulin inhibitors tested above. Because of the complex topology of FtsZ polymers formed in this assay, the distribution of polymers in the glass slide is typically nonuniform. As a result, it is very difficult to use this technique quantitatively to evaluate inhibition of assembly. To circumvent this problem, we used the concentration of inhibitor required to block the formation of visible polymers under the fluorescence microscope as a standard to evaluate the inhibition. For bis-ANS, this concentration was determined to be 36 μm in the standard polymerization buffer. To rule out the possibility that the inhibition by bis-ANS was due to the GFP tag on the FtsZ protein used for fluorescence detection, the effect of bis-ANS on FtsZ polymerization was also examined by light scattering. Fig. 2 A shows the time course of FtsZ polymerization in the absence (trace 1) and presence (trace 2) of 50 μm bis-ANS as detected by light scattering at room temperature. The apparent velocity of the increase of light scattering in the presence of different concentrations of bis-ANS is shown in Fig. 2 B. The IC50 was around 14 μm under these conditions. The results suggest that bis-ANS is a specific inhibitor of FtsZ polymerization. The inhibition of FtsZ polymer formation by bis-ANS prompted us to determine whether it could promote FtsZ depolymerization. Because assembly of FtsZ in our assay occurs dynamically in solution, it was possible to analyze the polymerization state in solution over time in order to address this question. FtsZ-GFP at 5 μm was incubated in assembly buffer at 37 °C for 10 min, and aliquots of the sample were checked by fluorescence microscopy to verify the formation of fluorescent polymers. Then, bis-ANS was added to the sample to make a final concentration of 50 μm. After a 20-min incubation, no polymers could be detected by fluorescence microscopy (data not shown). This result suggests that bis-ANS, in addition to inhibiting FtsZ polymerization, is also able to depolymerize FtsZ polymers. The possibility that bis-ANS can depolymerize microtubules has not been reported. The bis-ANS analog ANS (8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate) has been reported to be much less effective at inhibiting tubulin assembly than bis-ANS (17Mazumdar M. Parrack P.K. Mukhopadhyay K. Bhattacharyya B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6470-6474Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 24Horowitz P. Prasad V. Luduena R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14647-14650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using the fluorescence assay, we found that ANS had no detectable effect on FtsZ polymerization, even when the ANS concentration was as high as 1.5 mm (data not shown). We can conclude that the effects of bis-ANS and ANS on FtsZ assembly are very similar to their respective effects on tubulin assembly, suggesting that FtsZ and tubulin may interact similarly with these two compounds. Because bis-ANS specifically inhibits polymerization of both tubulin and FtsZ, it was reasonable to propose that FtsZ may have a hydrophobic surface arrangement similar to that of tubulin. It has been reported that tubulin has one high affinity bis-ANS binding site and 6 (20Prasad A.R. Luduena R.F. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 739-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) to 40 (25Sarkar N. Mukhopadhyay K. Parrack P.K. Bhattacharyya B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13367-13373Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 26Ward L.D. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11891-11899Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) low affinity binding sites. The high affinity binding site has been proposed to be responsible for the inhibition of tubulin assembly (24Horowitz P. Prasad V. Luduena R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14647-14650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To characterize the interaction between bis-ANS and FtsZ in more detail, we analyzed bis-ANS-FtsZ binding. Evaluation of multiple binding sites is extremely difficult using spectroscopic techniques, because the binding of bis-ANS at different sites may not have the same quantum yield (26Ward L.D. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11891-11899Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we took advantage of the extensive studies of the binding of bis-ANS to tubulin (20Prasad A.R. Luduena R.F. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 739-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 24Horowitz P. Prasad V. Luduena R.F. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11891-11899Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) to apply spectroscopic techniques to bis-ANS-FtsZ binding. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the presence of FtsZ greatly enhances bis-ANS fluorescence (trace 2) over the baseline (trace 1) with a blue shift of λmaxfrom 530 nm (data not shown) to 480 nm, suggesting strong binding of bis-ANS to FtsZ. Fig. 3 B shows an example of a Scatchard plot for an FtsZ concentration of 2.28 μm. These data indicate that FtsZ has a high affinity binding site for bis-ANS with a K d of 1.33 μm and 3.59 low affinity binding sites, each with a K d of 22.92 μm. Interestingly, these K d values for both high and low affinity binding sites are similar to those previously reported for tubulin (20Prasad A.R. Luduena R.F. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 739-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 24Horowitz P. Prasad V. Luduena R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14647-14650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sarkar N. Mukhopadhyay K. Parrack P.K. Bhattacharyya B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13367-13373Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 26Ward L.D. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11891-11899Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The number of low affinity binding sites for FtsZ is smaller than six, the smallest number reported for tubulin. To rule out the possibility that this difference was a result of the analytical method employed, the same double titration method as described by Prasad et al. (20Prasad A.R. Luduena R.F. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 739-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) was applied to FtsZ. The data confirmed that the number of low affinity binding sites is 3.66 and the K d is 19.2 μm (Fig. 4). The data derived from the same method strongly suggest that the bis-ANS binding sites of FtsZ are very similar to those of tubulin, except that tubulin may have additional sites. It is reasonable to propose from this result that FtsZ and tubulin may have a similar pattern of hydrophobic patches on their surfaces.Figure 4Double-reciprocal plots for the binding of bis-ANS to FtsZ.

Because binding of Ca2+ is likely to have an important role in conformational changes in FtsZ leading to its assembly, and because bis-ANS is a probe for hydrophobic surface arrangement, it was logical to include Ca2+ in the study of bis-ANS-FtsZ interactions and to determine the effect of Ca2+ on the binding of bis-ANS to FtsZ. The data in Fig. 5 A show a 30% increase in bis-ANS fluorescence upon addition of Ca2+ to FtsZ, suggesting that Ca2+ moderately increases bis-ANS binding. Either a change in bis-ANS binding or a change in quantum yield of the bis-ANS-FtsZ complex could explain the changes in fluorescence. To rule out the second possibility, the binding of bis-ANS to FtsZ was also examined by photoincorporation of bis-ANS to FtsZ. In this assay, the bis-ANS was first cross-linked to FtsZ protein, followed by detection of photolabeled protein after denaturation and separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As detected by UV cross-linking, Ca2+ appeared to increase the binding of bis-ANS (Fig. 6 B). Although FtsZ protein was stable in the presence of bis-ANS (data not shown), UV-specific protein degradation was often observed in our experiments in the presence of bis-ANS, especially with longer UV light exposure and high bis-ANS concentrations. To address this problem, the Coomassie-stained protein bands and bis-ANS fluorescent bands from the same gel were quantified, and bis-ANS fluorescence was normalized to the amount of protein in the bands. The effect of different concentrations of Ca2+ on bis-ANS binding is summarized in Fig. 7 A. Ca2+ concentrations between 5 and 10 mm enhanced bis-ANS binding by approximately 2-fold, as detected by UV cross-linking. This effect was greater than that detected by bis-ANS fluorescence spectra (Fig. 5 A) and could be attributed to a lower quantum yield of the additional exposed binding site(s) induced by Ca2+. Another explanation for this apparent increase is the predicted block of bis-ANS dissociation from FtsZ due to covalent cross-linking. Therefore, the photoincorporation method may give higher numbers for binding and as a result amplify the difference in binding affinities.Figure 7Effect of Ca2+ (A) and GTP (B) concentration on the photoincorporation of bis-ANS into FtsZ. Experimental conditions were the same as described in the legend to Fig. 6 and are described in detail under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because bis-ANS inhibits FtsZ assembly, bis-ANS itself is likely to induce FtsZ conformational changes. As a result, changes in bis-ANS fluorescence in the presence of Ca2+ may be due to a combination of both Ca2+ and bis-ANS effects on FtsZ conformation. To test whether Ca2+ alone induces changes of FtsZ hydrophobic surface properties in the absence of bis-ANS, we examined the effect of Ca2+ on the enhancement of ANS fluorescence by FtsZ. This was feasible because, as described earlier, ANS has no detectable effect on FtsZ polymerization. The data in Fig. 5 B demonstrate that Ca2+ increases ANS fluorescence up to 2.5-fold, suggesting that Ca2+ is sufficient to induce conformational changes in the FtsZ protein. To test whether the effect of Ca2+ on bis-ANS binding to FtsZ was reversible, EGTA was added to the assembly reaction to chelate Ca2+. When the Ca2+ concentration was below 5 mm, the bis-ANS fluorescence decreased back to the level observed in the absence of Ca2+ if sufficient EGTA was added (data not shown). When the Ca2+ concentration was 7.5 mm or greater, addition of 4 mm EGTA slightly decreased the bis-ANS fluorescence, consistent with a decrease in available Ca2+ (Fig. 5 A, trace 5). However, when EGTA concentration was increased to deplete Ca2+ from the solution, bis-ANS fluorescence did not decrease but instead increased to a level greater than reached during stimulation by Ca2+(Fig. 5 A, trace 6, and data not shown). This result is surprising, but it is consistent with the previous finding that a critical concentration of Ca2+ at 7 mm is required to trigger FtsZ assembly into visible fluorescent polymers (18Yu X.-C. Margolin W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5455-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). One possible explanation is that when Ca2+ in the solution reaches the critical concentration, the dissociation of Ca2+ from certain binding sites leads to a further exposure of hydrophobic surfaces, which may be essential for FtsZ to assemble in the presence of GTP. In a control experiment, EGTA itself had no effect on the fluorescence of the bis-ANS-FtsZ complex (data not shown) in the absence of Ca2+. In another control, Ca2+ and EGTA had no effect on the enhancement of bis-ANS fluorescence by bovine serum albumin. This suggests that the observed effects of depleting Ca2+ on bis-ANS fluorescence are specific under our conditions. Moreover, ANS fluorescence was also enhanced by EGTA-mediated depletion of Ca2+ (data not shown). This result supports the idea that additional EGTA-mediated FtsZ conformational changes were in fact due to Ca2+ dissociation and were not merely due to a specific effect of bis-ANS. Although it is well established that bis-ANS inhibits tubulin polymerization (24Horowitz P. Prasad V. Luduena R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14647-14650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the mechanism of inhibition is not understood. However, the similar binding behavior of bis-ANS to FtsZ and tubulin observed here suggested that its mechanism of inhibition of FtsZ and tubulin assembly might be similar. FtsZ polymerization under our conditions specifically requires GTP, although GDP is capable of supporting FtsZ polymerization mediated by DEAE-dextran and cationic lipid monolayers (11Erickson H.P. Taylor D.W. Taylor K.A. Bramhill D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 12Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Because GTP is essential for both FtsZ and tubulin assembly, it was important to determine whether GTP binding could be affected by bis-ANS binding and vice versa. Fig. 8 A shows that preincubation of FtsZ with 1 mm GTP greatly decreased the binding of bis-ANS to FtsZ. The maximum decrease of fluorescence by increasing GTP concentration is about 50% of that in the absence of GTP, suggesting that GTP may inhibit bis-ANS binding to certain binding sites but not to other sites. This result was also consistent with the titration data described earlier, which demonstrated that FtsZ has multiple bis-ANS binding sites. When bis-ANS was preincubated with FtsZ for 1 min, the addition of GTP caused a slow decrease of bis-ANS fluorescence, with the apparent rate of fluorescence decrease dependent on GTP concentration (Figs. 8 B). This suggests that the dissociation of bis-ANS from FtsZ is slower than the binding of bis-ANS to FtsZ. The tubulin signature sequence GGGTGTG, which is likely involved in the interaction of FtsZ with GTP, has been proposed to form a hydrophobic pocket (27Voskuil J.L.A. Westerbeek C.A.M. Wu C. Kolk A.H.J. Nanninga N. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1886-1893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rapid binding of bis-ANS to the GTP binding site and its slow dissociation is consistent with this model. To investigate further the inhibition of bis-ANS binding by GTP, a photoincorporation experiment was performed. As in the Ca2+ experiment, GTP was also shown to inhibit photoincorporation of bis-ANS to FtsZ (Fig. 7 B). The effect of GTP on bis-ANS binding seems to be slightly greater than that detected by fluorescent spectra. As suggested earlier, this phenomenon may be due to amplification of the difference in binding by UV cross-linking. The inhibition of bis-ANS binding by GTP binding suggested that the GTP binding site might also overlap with at least one bis-ANS binding site. The effect of bis-ANS on GTP binding is shown in Fig. 9 A. At a low GTP concentration (1 μm), the IC50 of bis-ANS is approximately 4 μm, but when GTP concentration increases to 10 μm, the IC50 increases to approximately 17 μm. The inhibition of GTP binding by bis-ANS and inhibition of bis-ANS binding by GTP suggest that GTP and bis-ANS compete for the same site on FtsZ. To determine whether the inhibition of FtsZ polymerization might be due to competitive binding of bis-ANS to the GTP binding site, we determined the effect of 50 μm bis-ANS on GTP binding to FtsZ at different GTP concentrations. Because a bis-ANS concentration of 50 μm was sufficient to block the formation of visible fluorescent polymers (Fig. 1), this low inhibitor concentration was a good starting point to investigate its effect on GTP binding as a function of GTP concentration. When the GTP concentration was greater than 200 μm, 50 μm bis-ANS had little effect on GTP binding (Fig. 9 B). However, 50 μm bis-ANS inhibited FtsZ assembly even when the GTP concentration was as high as 2 mm (data not shown), suggesting that the bis-ANS-mediated inhibition of FtsZ assembly is caused by noncompetitive or uncompetitive inhibition of GTP binding. Any competitive binding of GTP and bis-ANS to FtsZ would be predicted to be most apparent at low GTP concentrations. The bis-ANS concentration required to completely block the formation of visible fluorescent FtsZ polymers decreased slightly, from 36 to 30 μm, when the GTP concentration was reduced from 1 mm to 50 μm (data not shown). Therefore, it is possible that at low GTP concentrations, competitive binding of bis-ANS to the GTP binding site may have some role in the inhibition of FtsZ assembly. Recent direct and indirect evidence strongly suggests that the FtsZ ring marks the plane of cytokinesis in all prokaryotic cells, even chloroplasts (8Wang X. Lutkenhaus J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 28Osteryoung K.W. Vierling E. Nature. 1995; 376: 473-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Despite this apparently actin-like role, FtsZ clearly has structural and biochemical similarity to tubulin, including the ability to bind and hydrolyze GTP (9de Boer P. Crossley R. Rothfield L. Nature. 1992; 359: 254-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 13Raychaudhuri D. Park J.T. Nature. 1992; 359: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 29Mukherjee A. Dai K. Lutkenhaus J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1053-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and to self-assemble in vitro into protofilament bundles that have dimensions similar to that of tubulin (11Erickson H.P. Taylor D.W. Taylor K.A. Bramhill D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 30Erickson H.P. Stoffler D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and that have microtubule-like dynamic and morphological properties (18Yu X.-C. Margolin W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5455-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Our aim is to establish a biochemical foundation for FtsZ in order to clarify the differences and similarities between FtsZ and tubulin. A deeper understanding of these key proteins should help elucidate more about their evolutionary relationship and the precise function of FtsZ in prokaryotic cell division. In addition, because tubulin is the target of such a wide variety of inhibitors, FtsZ may also be a potentially good target for antimicrobial compounds. Hence, understanding structural differences between FtsZ and tubulin may eventually facilitate design of FtsZ-based antimicrobials that are modeled on anti-tubulin drugs. In this paper, we report that common tubulin inhibitory compounds did not inhibit FtsZ assembly but that the widely used hydrophobic probe bis-ANS can both inhibit FtsZ assembly and also serve as a useful probe to measure FtsZ conformational changes. These findings are a first step in defining structural and functional differences between FtsZ and tubulin. One obvious difference between the two proteins is the C-terminal domain, both in primary sequence and in predicted secondary structure (14de Pereda J.M. Leynadier D. Evangelio J.A. Chacon P. Andreu J.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14203-14215Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This difference may be responsible for the different Ca2+ effects, because a C-terminal truncation of tubulin is Ca2+-resistant (31Solomon F. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 358-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 32Serrano L. Valencia A. Caballero R. Avila J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7076-7081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, when FtsZ and tubulins are aligned, it can be seen that FtsZ is missing the region in Neurospora crassa tubulin that contains the mutation for benomyl resistance (33Orbach M.J. Porro E.B. Yanofsky C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1986; 6: 2452-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). This could explain why colchicine, colcemid, and benomyl have no effect on FtsZ polymerization. The similar inhibition of FtsZ and tubulin assembly by bis-ANS suggests that bis-ANS interacts similarly with both proteins. The titrations of FtsZ with bis-ANS and vice versa, using the same methods that were previously applied to tubulin, suggest that FtsZ has a high affinity bis-ANS binding site and multiple low affinity binding sites, with K d values similar to those of tubulin. This analysis implies that the hydrophobic surface properties of FtsZ and tubulin are similar. The inhibition of bis-ANS binding by GTP binding, and vice versa, suggests that GTP binding sites and bis-ANS binding sites overlap. Because bis-ANS binds selectively to protein hydrophobic surfaces, this result provides evidence that the GTP binding site is hydrophobic, in support of a previous proposal based on epitope mapping (27Voskuil J.L.A. Westerbeek C.A.M. Wu C. Kolk A.H.J. Nanninga N. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1886-1893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At low GTP concentrations, competition for GTP binding by bis-ANS could play a role in its inhibition of FtsZ assembly. Because the inhibition of GTP binding by bis-ANS can be overcome by increasing GTP concentration, whereas the inhibition of FtsZ assembly cannot, it is likely that noncompetitive or uncompetitive binding by bis-ANS is also responsible for its inhibitory effect. Hydrophobic interactions have been implicated in tubulin assembly, and our evidence is consistent with an analogous role for such interactions in FtsZ assembly. The fact that Ca2+ increases bis-ANS and ANS binding to FtsZ strongly suggests that Ca2+ induces FtsZ conformational changes. Based on our results, we propose that bis-ANS binding inhibits FtsZ assembly by blocking FtsZ intermolecular hydrophobic interactions. We further propose that Ca2+ binding may induce stronger intermolecular hydrophobic interactions that result in the stimulation of FtsZ assembly. This idea is in accord with the GTP-dependent stimulation of FtsZ assembly by 7–20 mm Ca2+ and the GTP-independent aggregation of FtsZ at higher concentrations of Ca2+ (18Yu X.-C. Margolin W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5455-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Such changes in hydrophobic properties, therefore, could be independent of GTP or could influence or be influenced by GTP binding. For example, GTP binding has been shown to influence the ability of tubulin to interact with hydrophobic substrates (34Hanssens I. Baert J. van Cauwelaert F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5160-5165Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). It is likely that changes in hydrophobic surface properties of FtsZ are involved in the interaction between FtsZ and its natural protein inhibitors MinC and SulA. There is good evidence that SulA interacts directly with FtsZ, and it was proposed that this interaction prevents a GTP-induced conformational change that normally leads to polymerization (35Huang J. Cao C. Lutkenhaus J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5080-5085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is consistent with the dispersal throughout the ftsZ gene of mutations that result in SulA resistance and the variable effects of these mutations on GTP binding and hydrolysis (36Dai K. Mukherjee A. Xu Y. Lutkenhaus J. J Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 130-136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings are completely consistent with the idea proposed here that hydrophobic interactions drive FtsZ polymerization. In fact, it is tempting to speculate that the inhibition mechanisms of bis-ANS and SulA may be similar. Future in-depth comparisons of bis-ANS and SulA inhibition of FtsZ assembly, as well as investigation of the effects of bis-ANS on SulA-resistant FtsZ proteins, should prove fruitful in understanding the molecular details underlying FtsZ assembly.

https://openalex.org/W2021073687,"The functions of the C5a anaphylatoxin are expressed through its interaction with a cell-surface receptor with seven transmembrane helices. The interaction of C5a with the receptor has been explained by a two-site model whereby recognition and effector sites on C5a bind, respectively, to recognition and effector domains on the receptor, leading to receptor activation (Chenoweth, D. E., and Hugli, T. E. (1980) Mol. Immunol. 17, 151–161. In addition, the extracellular N-terminal region of the C5a receptor has been implicated as the recognition domain for C5a, responsible for ∼50% of the binding energy of the C5a-receptor complex (Mery, L., and Boulay, F. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 3457–3463; DeMartino, J. A., Van Riper, G., Siciliano, S. J., Molineaux, C. J., Konteatis, Z. D., Rosen, H., and Springer, M. S. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 14446–14450). In this work, the interactions of C5a with the N-terminal domain of the C5a receptor were examined by use of recombinant human C5a molecules and peptide fragments M1NSFN5YTTPD10YGHYD15DKDTL20DLNTP25VDKTS30NTLR(hC5aRF-1–34), acetyl-HYD15DKDTL20DLNTP25VDKTS30NTLR (hC5aRF-13–34), and acetyl-TL20DLNTP25VDKTS30N-amide (hC5aRF-19–31) derived from human C5a receptor. Binding induced resonance perturbations in the NMR spectra of the receptor fragments and the C5a molecules indicated that the isolated Nterminal domain or residues 1–34 of the C5a receptor retain specific binding to C5a and to a C5a analog devoid of the agonistic C-terminal tail in the intact C5a. Residues of C5a perturbed by the binding of the receptor peptides are localized within the helical core of the C5a structure, in agreement with the results from functional studies employing mutated C5a and intact receptor molecules. All three receptor peptides, hC5aRF-1–34, hC5aRF-13–34, and hC5aRF-19–31, responded to the binding of C5a through the 21–30 region containing either hydrophobic, polar, or positively charged residues such as Thr24, Pro25, Val26, Lys28, Thr29, and Ser30. The 21–30 segment of all three receptor fragments was found to have a partially folded conformation in solution, independent of residues 1–18. These results indicate that a short peptide sequence, or residues 21–30, of the C5a receptor N terminus may constitute the binding domain for the recognition site on C5a. The functions of the C5a anaphylatoxin are expressed through its interaction with a cell-surface receptor with seven transmembrane helices. The interaction of C5a with the receptor has been explained by a two-site model whereby recognition and effector sites on C5a bind, respectively, to recognition and effector domains on the receptor, leading to receptor activation (Chenoweth, D. E., and Hugli, T. E. (1980) Mol. Immunol. 17, 151–161. In addition, the extracellular N-terminal region of the C5a receptor has been implicated as the recognition domain for C5a, responsible for ∼50% of the binding energy of the C5a-receptor complex (Mery, L., and Boulay, F. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 3457–3463; DeMartino, J. A., Van Riper, G., Siciliano, S. J., Molineaux, C. J., Konteatis, Z. D., Rosen, H., and Springer, M. S. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 14446–14450). In this work, the interactions of C5a with the N-terminal domain of the C5a receptor were examined by use of recombinant human C5a molecules and peptide fragments M1NSFN5YTTPD10YGHYD15DKDTL20DLNTP25VDKTS30NTLR(hC5aRF-1–34), acetyl-HYD15DKDTL20DLNTP25VDKTS30NTLR (hC5aRF-13–34), and acetyl-TL20DLNTP25VDKTS30N-amide (hC5aRF-19–31) derived from human C5a receptor. Binding induced resonance perturbations in the NMR spectra of the receptor fragments and the C5a molecules indicated that the isolated Nterminal domain or residues 1–34 of the C5a receptor retain specific binding to C5a and to a C5a analog devoid of the agonistic C-terminal tail in the intact C5a. Residues of C5a perturbed by the binding of the receptor peptides are localized within the helical core of the C5a structure, in agreement with the results from functional studies employing mutated C5a and intact receptor molecules. All three receptor peptides, hC5aRF-1–34, hC5aRF-13–34, and hC5aRF-19–31, responded to the binding of C5a through the 21–30 region containing either hydrophobic, polar, or positively charged residues such as Thr24, Pro25, Val26, Lys28, Thr29, and Ser30. The 21–30 segment of all three receptor fragments was found to have a partially folded conformation in solution, independent of residues 1–18. These results indicate that a short peptide sequence, or residues 21–30, of the C5a receptor N terminus may constitute the binding domain for the recognition site on C5a. The C5a anaphylatoxin is a 74-residue glycoprotein derived from the fifth component (C5) of the complement system upon proteolytic activation (1Hugli T.E. Crit. Rev.

Inappropriately accumulated C5a, on the other hand, stimulates smooth muscle contraction, causes vasodilation, increases vascular permeability, and can even recruit and stimulate granulocytes leading to the release of inflammatory molecules (2Goldstein I.M.

In particular, NMR analysis defined C5a as being composed of a 4-helix core structure (residues 1–64) followed by a 10-residue C terminus with conformational variability (7Zarbock J. Gennaro R.

Gerard N.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 775-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The 4-helix region of C5a or residues 1–64 encodes a recognition site for receptor binding (5Chenoweth D.E. Hugli T.E. Mol.

The flexible C-terminal residues, on the other hand, comprise the predominant effector site for receptor activation (5Chenoweth D.E. Hugli T.E. Mol.

Chem. 1991; 34: 2068-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Accordingly, peptides derived from the C terminus of C5a were found to be specific agonists of the C5a receptor. These C5a peptides have been useful for mapping the effector sites and led to the development of moderately potent receptor agonists (17Morgan E.L. Sanderson S. Scholz W. Noonan D.J. Weigle W.O. Hugli T.E. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3937-3942PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kawai, M., Or, Y. S., Wiedman, P. E., Luly, J., and Moyer, M.

However, the recognition site has not been defined conclusively because the important residues identified by these studies were distributed almost throughout C5a. Recently, a new C5a antagonist was synthesized, and its solution structure was determined (20Zhang X. Boyar W. Galakatos N. Gonnella N.C. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The structural difference between the C5a semi-synthetic antagonist and intact C5a (7Zarbock J. Gennaro R. Romeo D. Clore G.M.

The cell-surface receptor for C5a is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily, with an extracellular N-terminal region, an integral membrane helical domain, and a C-terminal tail extending into the cytoplasmic space (32Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). The extracellular and intracellular faces of the C5a receptor have three peptide loops, respectively, each connecting the C and the N termini of the seven individual transmembrane helices. The agonist functions of C5a are thought to be expressed by the binding of its C-terminal tail M70QLGR74 (or the effector site) to an activation domain on the receptor formed by the transmembrane helices (21Gerard N.P.

The 4-helix core region or recognition site of C5a may serve to assist receptor activation through interactions with a recognition domain on the extracellular face of the receptor molecule (4Gerard C. Gerard N.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 775-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 6Chenoweth D.E. Hugli T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sills M.A. Wasvary J. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 2783-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, there is a lack of detailed structural information about the C5a/C5a-receptor complex (4Gerard C. Gerard N.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 775-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), or any ligand-receptor complex involving G-protein-coupled receptors (32Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar), for an adequate understanding of the molecular mechanism of receptor activation.Unfortunately, it is not yet feasible to define in atomic resolution the structural details of the entire C5a/C5a-receptor complex. On the other hand, structural information may be derived through a study of the binding interactions of C5a with soluble fragments of the receptor. Several lines of investigation suggest that the recognition domain for the C5a-receptor interaction is localized in the extracellular N-terminal region of the C5a receptor (4Gerard C. Gerard N.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 775-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). First, antibodies recognizing the receptor N-terminal fragments interfere with C5a binding (23Oppermann M. Raedt U. Hebell T. Schmidt B. Zimmermann B. Gotze O. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3785-3794PubMed Google Scholar, 24Morgan E.L. Ember J.A. Sanderson S.D. Scholz W. Buchner R. Ye R.D. Hugli T.E. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 377-388PubMed Google Scholar). Second, truncation of the N terminus of the C5a receptor results in reduced binding of the receptor to intact C5a, but not to the agonist C5a tail peptides (27DeMartino J.A. Van Riper G.

Third, partial or complete replacement of the receptor N terminus diminished cell responses to C5a binding (26Mery L. Boulay F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3457-3463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fourth, replacement of some of the N-terminal Asp residues of the receptor with either Ala or Asn results in dramatically decreased affinity for C5a (26Mery L. Boulay F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3457-3463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27DeMartino J.A. Van Riper G. Siciliano S.J. Molineaux C.J. Konteatis Z.D. Rosen H. Springer M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14446-14450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is therefore a possibility that the receptor N terminus may represent an autonomous binding domain showing specific interactions with C5a. In this paper, we report an NMR characterization of the interactions of the N-terminal fragments of the C5a receptor with C5a and with an antagonist analog, CGS-28805, of C5a. NMR work was facilitated by the finding that the isolated receptor N terminus, residues 1–34 of the human C5a receptor, retained binding to C5a. The NMR results provide additional evidence for specific contacts between C5a and the N-terminal region of the C5a receptor. Receptor residues responsible for these contacts are further localized to residues Asp21 to Ser30 containing only two out of the five aspartic acids identified by mutagenesis as important for binding to C5a. The C5a anaphylatoxin is a 74-residue glycoprotein derived from the fifth component (C5) of the complement system upon proteolytic activation (1Hugli T.E. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1981; 1: 321-366PubMed Google Scholar). The C5a molecule plays an important role in host defense against invading microorganisms or tumor cells. Inappropriately accumulated C5a, on the other hand, stimulates smooth muscle contraction, causes vasodilation, increases vascular permeability, and can even recruit and stimulate granulocytes leading to the release of inflammatory molecules (2Goldstein I.M.

In particular, NMR analysis defined C5a as being composed of a 4-helix core structure (residues 1–64) followed by a 10-residue C terminus with conformational variability (7Zarbock J. Gennaro R.

There appear to be two major structural elements within C5a required for an effective activation of the C5a receptor (4Gerard C. Gerard N.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 775-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The 4-helix region of C5a or residues 1–64 encodes a recognition site for receptor binding (5Chenoweth D.E. Hugli T.E. Mol.

The flexible C-terminal residues, on the other hand, comprise the predominant effector site for receptor activation (5Chenoweth D.E. Hugli T.E. Mol.

These C5a peptides have been useful for mapping the effector sites and led to the development of moderately potent receptor agonists (17Morgan E.L. Sanderson S. Scholz W. Noonan D.J. Weigle W.O.

However, the recognition site has not been defined conclusively because the important residues identified by these studies were distributed almost throughout C5a. Recently, a new C5a antagonist was synthesized, and its solution structure was determined (20Zhang X. Boyar W. Galakatos N. Gonnella N.C. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The structural difference between the C5a semi-synthetic antagonist and intact C5a (7Zarbock J. Gennaro R. Romeo D. Clore G.M.

The cell-surface receptor for C5a is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily, with an extracellular N-terminal region, an integral membrane helical domain, and a C-terminal tail extending into the cytoplasmic space (32Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). The extracellular and intracellular faces of the C5a receptor have three peptide loops, respectively, each connecting the C and the N termini of the seven individual transmembrane helices. The agonist functions of C5a are thought to be expressed by the binding of its C-terminal tail M70QLGR74 (or the effector site) to an activation domain on the receptor formed by the transmembrane helices (21Gerard N.P.

The 4-helix core region or recognition site of C5a may serve to assist receptor activation through interactions with a recognition domain on the extracellular face of the receptor molecule (4Gerard C. Gerard N.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 775-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 6Chenoweth D.E. Hugli T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sills M.A. Wasvary J. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 2783-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, there is a lack of detailed structural information about the C5a/C5a-receptor complex (4Gerard C. Gerard N.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 775-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), or any ligand-receptor complex involving G-protein-coupled receptors (32Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar), for an adequate understanding of the molecular mechanism of receptor activation. Unfortunately, it is not yet feasible to define in atomic resolution the structural details of the entire C5a/C5a-receptor complex. On the other hand, structural information may be derived through a study of the binding interactions of C5a with soluble fragments of the receptor. Several lines of investigation suggest that the recognition domain for the C5a-receptor interaction is localized in the extracellular N-terminal region of the C5a receptor (4Gerard C. Gerard N.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 775-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). First, antibodies recognizing the receptor N-terminal fragments interfere with C5a binding (23Oppermann M. Raedt U. Hebell T. Schmidt B. Zimmermann B. Gotze O. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3785-3794PubMed Google Scholar, 24Morgan E.L. Ember J.A. Sanderson S.D. Scholz W. Buchner R. Ye R.D. Hugli T.E. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 377-388PubMed Google Scholar). Second, truncation of the N terminus of the C5a receptor results in reduced binding of the receptor to intact C5a, but not to the agonist C5a tail peptides (27DeMartino J.A. Van Riper G.

Third, partial or complete replacement of the receptor N terminus diminished cell responses to C5a binding (26Mery L. Boulay F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3457-3463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fourth, replacement of some of the N-terminal Asp residues of the receptor with either Ala or Asn results in dramatically decreased affinity for C5a (26Mery L. Boulay F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3457-3463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27DeMartino J.A. Van Riper G. Siciliano S.J. Molineaux C.J. Konteatis Z.D. Rosen H. Springer M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14446-14450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is therefore a possibility that the receptor N terminus may represent an autonomous binding domain showing specific interactions with C5a. In this paper, we report an NMR characterization of the interactions of the N-terminal fragments of the C5a receptor with C5a and with an antagonist analog, CGS-28805, of C5a. NMR work was facilitated by the finding that the isolated receptor N terminus, residues 1–34 of the human C5a receptor, retained binding to C5a. The NMR results provide additional evidence for specific contacts between C5a and the N-terminal region of the C5a receptor. Receptor residues responsible for these contacts are further localized to residues Asp21 to Ser30 containing only two out of the five aspartic acids identified by mutagenesis as important for binding to C5a.

The SRE-binding protein, serum response factor (SRF), plays a pivotal role in this process. Several transcription factors have been shown to interact with SRF and thereby create distinct complexes with different regulatory potentials. The ETS domain transcription factor Elk-1 is one such protein and serves to integrate distinct mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades at SREs. Elk-1 uses a short hydrophobic surface presented on the surface of an α-helix to interact with SRF. In this study we have used site-directed mutagenesis to identify residues in SRF that comprise the Elk-1 binding surface. The Elk-1 binding surface is composed of residues that lie on a hydrophobic surface-exposed groove located at the junction of the MADS box and C-terminal SAM motif. Different residues are implicated in interactions between SRF and the transcription factor Fli-1, indicating that although some overlap with the Elk-1 binding surface occurs, their interaction surfaces on SRF are distinct. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that the SRF DNA-binding domain acts as docking site for multiple transcription factors that can bind to small surface-exposed patches within this domain.

The SRE is bound by the serum response factor (SRF) both in vitro and in vivo (reviewed in Refs. 1Treisman R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 423-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 2Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 3Cahill M.A. Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 16-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and thus plays a pivotal role in regulating transcriptional activation of the c-fos promoter via this element. Multiple diverse extracellular signals are transduced through the SRE including both mitogenic stimuli (e.g. epidermal growth factor) and stress stimuli (e.g. UV light) (reviewed in Ref. 3Cahill M.A. Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 16-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). At least two alternative pathways exist to transduce these signals via SRF (4Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5421-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 5Johansen F.-E. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5920-5928Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). One pathway goes through a ternary complex composed of the SRE, SRF, and a member of the ternary complex factor (TCF) subfamily of ETS domain transcription factors (reviewed in Refs. 2Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar and 3Cahill M.A. Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 16-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This pathway is responsive to the majority of mitogenic and stress stimuli. The second pathway acts via a TCF-independent mechanism and is responsive to alternative serum constituents such as lysophosphatidic acid and upstream activators such as the Rho family of GTPases (6Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar, 7Hill C.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5037-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The TCF-dependent pathways have been extensively studied. In this complex, the TCF component is the recipient of signals transduced through the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades (Refs.8Price M.A. Cruzalegui F.H. Treisman R.

The TCFs use both protein-DNA (by their ETS domain) and protein-protein interactions to bind to the binary SRF·SRE complex (reviewed in Ref. 2Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) as predicted by the “grappling hook” model (1Treisman R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 423-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). A short region of the TCF Elk-1 (the B box) has been demonstrated to be sufficient for interaction with SRF (16Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3283-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Upon binding to SRF, this region is thought to adopt an inducible α-helical structure in which hydrophobic amino acids play a major role (17Ling Y. Lakey J.H. Roberts E.C. Sharrocks A.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2431-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The minimum region of SRF required for this interaction with the TCFs in vitro maps to its minimal core DNA-binding domain (coreSRF) (18Mueller C.G.F. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4219-4229Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Experiments using chimeric transcription factors have localized the TCF binding surface to the C-terminal half of this domain (18Mueller C.G.F. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4219-4229Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 19Shaw P.E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3011-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Moreover, the core domain is sufficient for correct dimerization, sequence-specific DNA binding, and protein-induced DNA bending by SRF (reviewed in Refs. 2Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar and 20Sharrocks A.D. Shore P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2442-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recently the structure of this domain has been solved (21Pellegrini L. Tan S. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 490-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and shown to adopt a novel fold in which the N-terminal portion (MADS box) makes all the DNA contacts. Dimerization is mediated by elements within the MADS box and additional contributions from the C-terminal extension (the SAM motif). In addition to binding TCFs, the core DNA-binding domain of SRF is sufficient to form DNA complexes with or bind directly to other transcription factors including myogenic basic helix-loop-helix proteins (22Groisman R.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3403-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Moreover, a higher order complex involving SRF, Phox, and TFII-I/SPIN and the c-fos SRE has also been identified (26Grueneberg D.A. Henry R.W. Braver A. Novina C.D. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Gilman M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2482-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These diverse transcription factors show little homology with the Elk-1 B box, implying that they use alternative interaction motifs and different surfaces on SRF. The aim of this study was to identify the TCF interaction surface on SRF. The recent elucidation of the structure of the minimal DNA-binding domain of SRF (21Pellegrini L. Tan S. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 490-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) permits both improved experimental design and interpretation of the biochemical data. By using an extensive mutagenic approach, we have identified a surface-exposed patch on SRF which is involved in interactions with Elk-1. The transcription factor Fli-1 interacts with a different surface on SRF which overlaps the Elk-1 binding region. Taken together our data are consistent with a model in which the SRF DNA-binding domain acts as a docking site with interaction surfaces for multiple transcription factors involved in diverse cellular processes. The following plasmids were constructed for making proteins by in vitro transcription/translation. pAS197 encodes the ETS DNA-binding domain and B box of Elk-1 (Elk1–168; amino acids 1–168) (17Ling Y.

Mutations were introduced by a two-step PCR protocol using a mutagenic primer and two flanking primers as described previously (30Shore P. Whitmarsh A.J. Bhaskaran R. Davis R.J. Waltho J.P.

Details of mutagenic primers can be supplied upon request. The following plasmids were used for protein expression in Escherichia coli. pAS77 encodes the GST-B box fusion (Elk-1 amino acids 139–168) (16Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell.

Plasmids encoding the mutant GSTcoreSRF proteins E190A (pAS647), H193A (pAS656), T196A (pAS660), V194E (pAS650), Y195D (pAS651), T196K (pAS652), and Q203E (pAS653) were constructed by replacement of the EcoRI fragment in pAS58 with a PCR product (COR3 C-terminal primer; Ref. 16Shore P.

Shore P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2442-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription and translation of SRF, Elk-1, and Fli-1 derivatives were carried out with TNTTM-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.35S-Labeled proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis through 0.1% SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis before visualization and quantification of bands representing intact proteins by phosphorimaging (Fuji BAS-1500 phosphorimager and TINA 2.08e software). GST fusion proteins were purified from E. coli as described previously (16Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3283-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The purity and concentration of protein samples were estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Pull-down assays for protein-protein interactions with GST-B box and GSTcoreSRF derivatives were carried out essentially as described previously (16Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3283-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Gel retardation assays were performed in 12-μl reaction volumes as described previously (28Sharrocks A.D. Gille H. Shaw P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Assays were carried out on the c-fos SRE (oligonucleotides ADS134 and ADS135; top strand, 5′-CTAGCTTACACAGGATGTCCATATTAGGACATCTGCGTCAGCAGG-3′) or the CECI site (oligonucleotides ADS341 and ADS342; top strand, 5′-CGCGTGAGCCGGAAATGTGATCAACTATTTATAGATA-3′). The CArG box SRF-binding sites are underlined, and the Elk-1-binding sites (ets motifs) are shown in bold. The CECI site (combined ets and CArG) consists of the S30 ets motif identified by site selection (31Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4698-4706Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and the N10 site (29Sharrocks A.D. Von Hesler F. Shaw P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Elk-1 binds to the ets motif in this site with higher affinity than to the c-fos SRE (31Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4698-4706Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis through nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide (30% acrylamide, 0.8% bisacrylamide) gels cast in either 0.5× Tris/borate/EDTA (TBE) or 1× TBE for circular permutation assays. Relative DNA binding affinities were calculated by phosphorimager analysis of protein-DNA complexes (Fuji BAS1500; TINA 2.08e software). Experiments were carried out to achieve ≤50% of total DNA binding in protein-DNA complexes. Under these conditions, relative binding affinities within an experiment can be calculated by direct quantification of DNA-protein complexes. The scoring of these relative binding affinities is indicated in the legend to Table I.Table ISummary of the effect of amino acid substitutions in SRF on its interactions with Elk-1 and Fli-11-a Note range of the assay is from 20 to 100% only. ++ is taken as a significant decrease.1-b These values represent 5–10-fold increases over wild-type SRF.1-c Mutations were introduced into the N-terminally truncated METcorcSRF derivative.

For circular permutation analysis, DNA fragments were produced by appropriate restriction enzyme digestion of PCR products derived from pAS76 (containing the SRE) and purified as described previously (20Sharrocks A.D. Shore P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2442-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 32West A.G. Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2876-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Curve fitting and apparent DNA bend angles were calculated as described previously (32West A.G. Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2876-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Bend angles are quoted as the average of three independent experiments. Standard deviations (n − 1) of bend angles are in the range 0.5–1.6°. To show direct visual comparisons of data obtained from proteins that give rise to complexes of differing mobilities, the data were normalized for the fastest mobility complex (μm) (32West A.G. Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2876-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). All figures were generated electronically from scanned images of autoradiographic images using Picture Publisher (Micrografx) and Powerpoint (Microsoft) software. Final images are representative of the original autoradiographic images. A mutagenic approach was used to identify residues in SRF that are involved in binding Elk-1. Amino acids were either changed to alanines (removing potential interacting side chains) or to charged residues. The latter approach relies on introducing amino acids that will disrupt protein-protein contacts and therefore the residues need not be in direct contact with Elk-1 but might instead be in very close proximity to residues comprising the binding surface. Both these approaches have been used successfully in independent studies with virtually identical results to map surface residues on TATA binding protein which bind to components of the transcription preinitiation complex (33Bryant G.O. Martel L.S. Burley S.K. Berk A.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2491-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 34Tang H. Sun X. Reinberg D. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The majority of the mutations introduced were at single amino acid residues. Individual residues in the core DNA-binding domain of SRF could have multiple roles in addition to protein-protein interactions including DNA binding, dimerization, or protein-induced DNA bending. A combination of assays were therefore used to assess the function of mutant proteins in both the presence and absence of DNA. Mutations were introduced into the minimal DNA-binding domain of SRF (coreSRF) and tested for binding to the truncated Elk-1 protein (Elk-1–168) which contains the ETS DNA-binding domain and the B box SRF-binding motif. These truncated proteins are sufficient for complex formation in both the presence and absence of DNA (16Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3283-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 17Ling Y. Lakey J.H. Roberts E.C. Sharrocks A.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2431-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The results of these assays are presented below and summarized in TableI. Initially the mutant SRF proteins were tested for their ability to bind to the CArG (CC{A + Trich}6GG) box in the c-fos SRE. The majority of the mutant proteins bound the SRE with similar efficiency to the wild-type protein (Fig. 1; Table I). However, the mutants V194A/T196A, T199A, L202A, and T199D exhibited a reduced affinity for the SRE (Fig. 1, lanes 8, 9, 14, and 27). Binding of the mutants P204A, F197D, A198D, and I206D was severely reduced and not detectable by this assay (Fig. 1, lanes 16, 25, 26, and 29). The ability of the mutant SRF proteins to form ternary DNA-bound complexes with Elk-1 and the c-fos SRE was tested by gel retardation analysis. Protein-protein interactions with SRF are essential for efficient recruitment of Elk-1 into ternary complexes on this site (16Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3283-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Assays were carried out using concentrations of SRF that give equal amounts of binary SRF·SRE complex. The efficiency of ternary complex formation was virtually identical for all the mutant SRF proteins tested (Fig. 2 B) with the exception of the mutants V194E, T196E, and T196K which exhibited a reduced efficiency of complex formation (Fig. 2 B, lanes 19, 21 and 22). In the case of V194E no ternary complex was detectable. To detect further mutations that affect ternary complex formation, we used a second assay system in which a high affinity ets motif is juxtaposed next to a weak CArG box in the CECI (combinedets and CArG) site (Fig. 3 A). This arrangement of sites is the opposite that found in the c-fos SRE and allows recruitment of SRF by Elk-1. 3E. C. Roberts, unpublished data. Under these conditions, protein-protein interactions are essential for the recruitment of SRF by Elk-1 into a ternary complex. In contrast to the results on the c-fos SRE, many of the mutant proteins exhibited a reduced efficiency of ternary complex formation on the CECI site (Fig. 3 B; Table I). The mutant proteins E190A, T191A/H193A, V194A/T196A, T199A, Y195D, Q203E, T207D, and Q216E showed significant reductions in complex forming efficiency (<50% WT binding) (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3–5, 8, 9, 22, 28, 30, and 32; Table I), whereas binding by the mutant proteins V194A/K201A, V194E, T196E, and T196K (Fig. 3 B, lanes 13, 21, 23, and 24 and Table I) was barely detectable (<5% WT binding, not visible in Fig. 3 B). No complex formation was observed by the mutants L202A, P204A, F197D, A198D, T199D, and I206D (Fig. 3 B, lanes 14, 16, 25–27, and 29 and TableI). Moderate reductions (≈60% WT binding) were also observed for the mutant proteins H193A, V194A, and I206A (Fig. 3 B, lanes 4, 6and 17 and Table I). The lack of complex formation by the mutants P204A, F197D, A198D, and I206D is probably attributable to disruptions in their DNA binding capabilities (see Fig. 1; Table I). Similarly, the mutant proteins V194A/K201A, L202A, and T199D exhibit significantly reduced DNA binding activity (Fig. 1; Table I). In contrast, DNA binding by the mutant proteins V194E, T196E, and T196K is unimpaired, suggesting that the effect of these mutations is specifically to disrupt SRF-Elk-1 interactions. Likewise, the reductions in complex formation by the mutants E190A, H193A, T191A/H193A, V194A, V194A/T196A, T199A, I206A, Y195D, Q203E, and T207D are also likely to be attributable to losses in protein-protein interactions with Elk-1. Taken together these assays suggest key roles for amino acids Val-194 and Thr-196 in complex formation with Elk-1. Furthermore, several additional residues, Glu-190, His-193, Thr-199, Tyr-195, Gln-203, Ile-206, and Thr-207, are identified as part of or close to the Elk-1 binding surface of SRF. Direct protein-protein interactions between SRF and Elk-1 were investigated using the GST pull-down assay. Although Elk-1 and SRF are usually found as DNA-bound complexes, complexes can be detected in vitro in the absence of DNA using this assay (16Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3283-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). First, SRF mutants were translated in vitro as35S-labeled proteins and tested for binding to an immobilized protein consisting of GST fused to the Elk-1 B box (GST-B box) (16Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3283-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Initially, a series of SRF derivatives with mutations in the N terminus of the MADS box were tested. However, none of the tested mutations reduces the binding of SRF to the B box (Table I; data not shown). Further SRF derivatives were tested that harbor mutations in the C-terminal end of the MADS box or within the SAM domain. Of the alanine substitution mutants, the single mutants E190A, T199A, and P204A (Fig. 4 A lanes 3, 9, and 16; Fig. 4 B) and the double mutants V194A/T196A, T196A/T207A, and Q203A/T207A (Fig. 4 A lanes 8, 19, and 21; Fig. 4 B) display large decreases in binding to GST-B box (<50% wild-type binding). The residues Val-194, Thr-196, and Gln-203 probably play the major roles in the reductions observed in the double alanine mutants as single mutations in these residues also cause reductions in SRF binding to GST-B box (Fig. 4 A; lanes 6, 7, and 15; Fig. 4 B). Furthermore, the mutant protein I206A shows a moderate reduction in binding the Elk-1 B box (Fig. 4 B, lane 7; 51% WT). The lack of binding by the P204A mutant is probably due to a structural change in SRF (see “Discussion”). However, the residues Glu-190, Val-194, Thr-196, Thr-199, and Ile-206 are directly implicated in binding to Elk-1 which correlates well with their proposed role in ternary complex formation on the CECI site (Fig. 3). Further residues are implicated in binding the Elk-1 B box from analysis of the mutants with charged residues substitutions. The mutants V194E, Y195D, T196E, T196K, F197D, A198D, and I206D exhibited large decreases in binding to GST-B box (Fig. 4 A lanes 21–26 and 29; Fig. 4 B). Of these mutants, the structures of F197D, A198D, and I206D are probably severely perturbed (see “Discussion”). However, clear correlations are apparent with the effect of the mutations V194E, T196E, and T196K on complex formation by SRF on the CECI site (Fig. 3; Table I). Moderate reductions in binding to GST-B box could also be observed for Q203E and T207D (Fig. 4 A lanes 28 and 30; Fig. 4 B) which also correlates with reductions in their ability to recruit SRF to the CECI site (Fig. 3; Table I). In summary, direct protein-protein interaction assays and DNA-bound ternary complex formation assays both suggest important roles for Glu-190, Val-194, Thr-196, Thr-199, and Ile-206 in forming the interaction surface with Elk-1. To confirm that the differential interactions observed with the mutant SRF proteins and the isolated Elk-1 B box could be reproduced in its natural context, the interaction assay was repeated with reciprocal constructs in which a selection of the SRF mutants were fused to GST and the truncated Elk-1–168 protein was translated and labeled in vitro. As a control to assess levels of nonspecific binding, the mutant Elk-1 derivative Elk-1–168 (L158P) which is unable to bind to SRF (13Cavigelli M. Dolfi F. Claret F.X. Karin M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5957-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) was used. Under these conditions, stronger interactions between SRF and Elk-1 are seen than to the isolated B box (Ref. 16Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3283-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar and data not shown). 4Y. Ling and A. D. Sharrocks, unpublished data. In comparison to the wild-type protein, the SRF mutants tested exhibited different levels of binding to Elk-1 (Fig. 5, A and B; TableI). Moreover, consistent with the reciprocal experiment (Fig. 4), the SRF mutant V194E showed the greatest decrease in binding (Fig. 5 A, lanes 11 and 12). The mutant T196K also exhibited a significant decrease (Fig. 5 A, lanes 15 and 16), and binding by the mutant E190A was also reduced to less than 50% (Fig. 5 A, lanes 5 and 6). The other tested SRF mutants all bound to at least 50% of the level exhibited by the wild-type protein. Taken together, our results demonstrate that in the absence of DNA, the mutations V194E, T196K, and T196E in SRF cause the greatest decrease in protein-protein interactions with Elk-1. These residues are therefore directly implicated in Elk-1 binding. The mutation of additional residues also causes reductions in direct SRF-Elk-1 interactions, implicating multiple amino acids in forming the SRF-Elk-1 interface. SRF-mediated DNA bending is observed in the ternary SRF·Elk-1·SRE complex (20Sharrocks A.D. Shore P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2442-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The magnitude of protein-induced DNA bending may affect the ability of SRF to recruit Elk-1 into ternary complexes. Several residues in SRF have been implicated in protein-induced DNA bending (32West A.G. Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2876-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), including His-193 which is located in the vicinity of several residues investigated in this study (Fig. 8; see Ref. 21Pellegrini L. Tan S. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 490-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). To rule out an effect of the important residues identified in this study on protein-induced bending and hence ternary complex formation, the DNA-bending properties of several mut"

The amount of topoIIα mRNA was increased 1.5–3-fold 6–24 h after exposure of T24 human urinary bladder cancer cells to heat shock stress at 43 °C for 1 h. The effect of heat shock on the transcriptional activity of the human topoIIα gene promoter was investigated by transient transfection of T24 cells with luciferase reporter plasmids containing various lengths of the promoter sequence. The transcriptional activity of the full-length promoter (nucleotides (nt) −295 to +85) and of three deletion constructs (nt −197 to +85, −154 to +85, and −74 to +85) was increased ∼3-fold 24 h after heat shock stress. In contrast, the transcriptional activity of the minimal promoter (nt −20 to +85), which lacks the first inverted CCAAT element (ICE1), the GC box, and the heat shock element located between nt −74 and −21, was not increased by heat shock. Furthermore, the transcriptional activity of promoter constructs containing mutations in the GC box or heat shock element, but not that of a construct containing mutations in ICE1, was significantly increased by heat shock. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed reduced binding of a nuclear factor to an oligonucleotide containing ICE1 when nuclear extracts were derived from cells cultured for 3–24 h after heat shock. No such change in factor binding was apparent with an oligonucleotide containing the heat shock element of the topoIIα gene promoter. Finally, in vivo footprint analysis of the topoIIα gene promoter revealed that two G residues of ICE1 that were protected in control cells became sensitive to dimethyl sulfate modification after heat shock. These results suggest that transcriptional activation of the topoIIα gene by heat shock requires the release of a negative regulatory factor from ICE1.

Human topoisomerase II (topoII) 1The abbreviations used are: topoII, topoisomerase II; ICE, inverted CCAAT element; HSE, heat shock element; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; nt, nucleotide(s); EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; HSF, heat shock factor. functions as a homodimer by cleaving and opening one DNA duplex, passing a second duplex through the opening, and then resealing the break (4Brown P.O.

Two topoII isoforms have been identified in mammals: 170-kDa topoIIα and 180-kDa topoIIβ (7Jenkins J.R. Ayton P. Jones T. Davies S.L. Simmons D.L. Harris A.L. Sheer D. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5587-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Although both enzymes are closely related in structure, they differ in important biochemical and pharmacological properties, including sensitivity to topoII-targeting drugs, cellular localization, and regulation by the cell cycle (8Drake F.H. Hofmann G.A. Bartus H.F. Mattern M.R. Crooke S.T. Mirabelli C.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8154-8160Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Whereas the amount of topoIIβ remains relatively constant throughout the cell cycle, topoIIα expression is coupled to the cell cycle (9Woessner R.D. Mattern M.R. Mirabelli C.K. Johnson R.K. Drake F.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 209-214PubMed Google Scholar, 10Goswami P.C. Roti Roti J.L. Hunt C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1500-1508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). topoIIα is of particular importance because of its association with DNA replication, mitosis, and cell proliferation. Expression of topoIIα is highly susceptible to environmental stimuli, and such regulation is thought to be mediated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. The promoter region of the topoIIα gene contains various regulatory elements, including five inverted CCAAT elements (ICEs), one GC box, and one heat shock element (HSE) (11Hochhauser D. Stanway C.A. Harris A.L. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18961-18965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Exposure of human colon cancer cells to glucosamine induces down-regulation of topoIIα, resulting in the development of resistance to the topoIIα-targeting epipodophyllotoxin, etoposide (12Yun J. Tomida A. Nagata K. Tsuruo T. Oncol. Res. 1995; 7: 583-590PubMed Google Scholar). Development of resistance to such topoIIα-targeting agents is often associated with down-regulation of topoIIα in various mammalian cell lines (13Takano H. Kohno K. Matsuo K. Matsuda T. Kuwano M. Anti-Cancer Drugs. 1992; 3: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 14Beck J. Niethammer D. Gekeler V. Cancer Lett. 1994; 86: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In one etoposide-resistant cell line derived from human head and neck cancer KB cells (15Takano H. Kohno K. Ono M. Uchida Y. Kuwano M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3951-3957PubMed Google Scholar, 16Matsuo K. Kohno K. Takano H. Sato S. Kiue A. Kuwano M. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5819-5824PubMed Google Scholar), the transcription factor Sp3 was implicated in the down-regulation of topoIIα (17Kubo T. Kohno K. Ohga T. Taniguchi K. Kawanami K. Wada M. Kuwano M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3860-3864PubMed Google Scholar). Introduction of the wild-type p53 tumor suppressor gene into murine cells results in reduced expression of the topoIIα gene, and this effect appears to be mediated by one of the ICEs in the topoIIα gene promoter (18Wang Q. Zambetti G.P. Suttle D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 389-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Apoptosis induced by adenovirus E1A protein in human KB cells is associated with a marked decrease in the amount of topoIIα that is due to accelerated degradation of topoIIα by the ubiquitin proteolysis pathway (19Nakajima T. Ohi N. Arai T. Nozaki N. Kikuchi A. Oda K. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 651-662PubMed Google Scholar, 20Nakajima T. Morita K. Ohi N. Arai T. Nozaki N. Kikuchi A. Osaka F. Yamao F. Oda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24842-24849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The amount of topoIIα mRNA in late S phase is ∼15 times that during the G1 phase of the cell cycle in human HeLa cells, apparently because of increased mRNA stability in S phase (10Goswami P.C. Roti Roti J.L. Hunt C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1500-1508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations indicate that topoIIα expression is regulated by multiple mechanisms that operate at the levels of transcription, mRNA stability, and protein degradation. Heat shock stress also affects the abundance of topoIIα mRNA in mammalian cells. Exposure of human head and neck or colon cancer cells to high nonpermissive temperatures results in an increase in expression of the topoIIα gene, apparent 6–12 h later, and consequent sensitization to the cytotoxic effect of etoposide (21Brandt T.L. Fraser D.J. Leal S. Halandras P.M. Kroll A.R. Kroll D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6278-6284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 22Matsuo K. Kohno K. Sato S. Uchiumi T. Tanimura H. Yamada Y. Kuwano M. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1085-1090PubMed Google Scholar). The same heat shock stress markedly increases the abundance of the heat shock protein HSP70 and induces a transient decrease in the amount of topoIIα mRNA and protein immediately after exposure to hyperthermia (10Goswami P.C. Roti Roti J.L. Hunt C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1500-1508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Matsuo K. Kohno K. Sato S. Uchiumi T. Tanimura H. Yamada Y. Kuwano M. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1085-1090PubMed Google Scholar, 23Hirohashi Y. Hidaka K. Sato S. Kuwano M. Kohno K. Hisatsugu T. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1995; 86: 1097-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Whereas this early effect of heat shock stress on topoIIα expression appears to be mediated by increased degradation of topoIIα mRNA (10Goswami P.C. Roti Roti J.L. Hunt C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1500-1508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the later up-regulation of topoIIα gene expression appears to be due to transcriptional activation (22Matsuo K. Kohno K. Sato S. Uchiumi T. Tanimura H. Yamada Y. Kuwano M. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1085-1090PubMed Google Scholar). We have now investigated which elements in the 5′-flanking region of the human topoIIα gene are responsible for the heat shock-induced activation of transcription. Restriction enzymes and other nucleic acid-modifying enzymes and reagents were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI), Life Technologies, Inc., or Takara Shuzo (Kyoto, Japan), unless indicated otherwise. Both [α-32P]dCTP and [γ-32P]ATP were from NEN Life Science Products. Human topoI cDNA was kindly provided by T. Andoh (Sohka University, Tokyo, Japan), and human topoIIα cDNA (pBS-hTOP2) was provided by J. C. Wang (Harvard University, Boston, MA). Human HSP70 cDNA was kindly given by R. T. N. Tjian (University of California, Berkeley, CA). All cDNA fragments were separated from vector DNA by agarose gel electrophoresis and labeled by random primer DNA synthesis. The T24 cell line, established from human transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder (24Bubenik J. Baresova M. Viklicky V. Jakoubkova J. Sainerova H. Donner J. Int. J. Cancer. 1973; 11: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), was cultured at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Nissui Seiyaku, Tokyo) supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum (Sera-Lab, Sussex, United Kingdom), 1 mg/ml Bacto-peptone (Difco), 0.292 mg/mll-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml kanamycin. For heat shock, culture plates were sealed with paraffin film and immersed in a water bath at 43 °C for 1 h. Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (17Kubo T. Kohno K. Ohga T. Taniguchi K. Kawanami K. Wada M. Kuwano M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3860-3864PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was extracted from T24 cells with the use of guanidine isothiocyanate (25Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar), subjected (15 μg/lane) to electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde, and transferred to a Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham International, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). The membranes were exposed to 32P-labeled cDNA probes for 18 h and washed twice at 42 °C in 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS and twice at 42 °C in 0.2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS. Radioactivity was detected with a Fujix BAS 2000 image analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo). We used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to clone the human topoIIα gene promoter (nt −295 to +85, relative to the major transcription start site) as described previously (17Kubo T. Kohno K. Ohga T. Taniguchi K. Kawanami K. Wada M. Kuwano M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3860-3864PubMed Google Scholar). The 3′-end of all inserts was nt +85, 10 base pairs upstream of the translation initiation site. For the construction of other deletion constructs, HindIII fragments (nt −295 to +85) of the pTIIα−295 plasmid were digested with BfaI (pTIIα−197), ScrFI (pTIIα−154),HphI (pTIIα−74), and SacI (pTIIα−20). The digestion products were blunt-ended with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, ligated to HindIII linkers, and cloned into the HindIII site of the pGL2-Basic vector (Promega). Site-directed mutagenesis of ICE1, the GC box, and the HSE in pTIIα−295 was performed by a PCR-based method. The promoter sequences were amplified first with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), the 3′-primer +85 (5′-CGGTCGTGAAGGGGCTCAAG-3′), and 5′-primers that introduce specific mutations into the target elements: m5 (5′-CAGGGAAAAACTGGTCTGCTTCGGGCGGGCTAAAGGAAGGTTCAAGTGGAGCT-3′) for mutation of ICE1, m6 (5′-CAGGGATTGGCTGGTCTGCTTCAAAAAAGCTAAAGGAAGGTTCAAGTGGAGCT-3′) for mutation of the GC box, and m7 (5′-CAGGGATTGGCTGGTCTGCTTCGGGCGGGCTAAAGAAAGGAAAAAATGGAGCT-3′) for mutation of the HSE (mutated nucleotides are underlined). A second PCR was then performed with Taq polymerase, the first PCR products, and the 5′-primer −295 (corresponding to the normal promoter sequence with a 5′-end at nt −295). The second PCR products were digested with HindIII and ligated into pGL2-Basic. The mutations introduced into these clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing. T24 cells (1 × 105) were transferred to 60-mm dishes, incubated at 37 °C for 48 h, and transfected with luciferase plasmid DNA (2.5 μg) by calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (26Okimoto T. Kohno K. Kuwano M. Gopas J. Kung H.F. Ono M. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1625-1633PubMed Google Scholar). Four hours after transfection, the cells were washed, incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in fresh medium, and exposed to 43 °C for 1 h. The treated cells were then harvested immediately (0 h) or after further incubation at 37 °C for 1, 6, 12, or 24 h for determination of luciferase activity. Cells were lysed in 200 μl of 25 mm Tris phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1% Triton X-100 and subjected to centrifugation at 14,000 × gfor 15 s. The resulting supernatants were assayed for luciferase activity with the use of a Picagene kit (Toyoinki, Tokyo); light intensity was measured for 15 s with a luminometer (Model TD-20/20, Promega). Cells were cotransfected with pSV2-β-GAL as a control for transfection efficiency, and β-galactosidase activity was measured with an Aurora GAL-XE kit (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA). Heat-treated or control T24 cells were exposed to dimethyl sulfate, and genomic DNA was then extracted and cleaved as described (27Konishi T. Nomoto M. Shimizu K. Abe T. Itoh H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 1021-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 28Abravaya K. Phillips B. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 586-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Ligation-mediated PCR was performed as described (27Konishi T. Nomoto M. Shimizu K. Abe T. Itoh H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 1021-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Primer 1 (5′-CAGGCAGGACCCCACG-3′, nt +46 to +31) was used for first-strand synthesis; primer 2 (5′-CCCGACCAAGCCGCTTCTCCAC-3′, nt +22 to +1) was used for PCR amplification; and primer 3 (5′-CCGACCAAGCCGCTTCTCCACAGACGCG-3′, nt +21 to −7), which was labeled at the 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, was used for final detection of the DNA ladder. Samples were analyzed on a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. T24 cells (5 × 105) were transfected with a luciferase reporter vector containing the topoIIα gene promoter (pTIIα−295; 10 μg) and pRSV-neo (0.5 μg) with the use of Trans-it reagent (PanVera, Madison, WI). After 8 h, the medium was replaced, and the cells were incubated for 24 h. The cells were then incubated in selection medium containing G418 (0.8 mg/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.), and growing colonies (20–30/106 cells) were cloned, expanded, and tested for luciferase activity. Unless indicated otherwise, PCR was performed in a final volume of 100 μl containing 1 ng of template DNA, a 100 pm concentration of each oligonucleotide primer, a 200 μm concentration of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.01% (w/v) gelatin. Amplification was carried out in a DNA thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer) for 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and polymerization at 72 °C for 2 min. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (17Kubo T. Kohno K. Ohga T. Taniguchi K. Kawanami K. Wada M. Kuwano M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3860-3864PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, T24 cells (4 × 107), subjected or not to heat shock at 43 °C for 1 h, were collected by exposure to trypsin; resuspended in 200 μl of an ice-cold solution containing 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 0.75 mm spermidine, 0.15 mmspermine, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; and incubated on ice for 15 min. The cells were then lysed by passing 10 times through a 25-gauge needle attached to a 1-ml syringe, and the lysate was centrifuged for 40 s in a microcentrifuge. The resulting nuclear pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of an ice-cold solution containing 20 mmHepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 0.4 m NaCl, 0.75 mmspermidine, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 25% (v/v) glycerol; incubated for 30 min on ice with frequent gentle mixing; and then centrifuged for 20 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge to remove insoluble material. The resulting supernatant (nuclear extract) was stored at −70 °C, and its protein concentration was determined with a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). EMSAs were performed as described previously (29Miyazaki M. Kohno K. Uchiumi T. Tanimura H. Matsuo K. Nasu M. Kuwano M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, 6 μg of nuclear extract protein were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in a final volume of 20 μl containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 8% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 1 × 104 cpm of32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe (1 ng) in the absence or presence of various competitors. The reaction mixtures were then applied to a nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel and separated by electrophoresis at 100 V for 3 h in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 380 mm glycine, and 2 mmEDTA. The gel was exposed to x-ray film with intensifying screens. The following oligonucleotides were used for EMSAs: topo-ICE1 (5′-GAGTCAGGGATTGG CTGGTCTGCTTCGGGC-3′, nt −77 to −48 of the topoIIα gene), topo-HSE (5′-GGGCTAAAGG AAGGTTCAAGTGGAGCTCTC-3′, nt −47 to −18 of the topoIIα gene), and HSP70-HSE (5′-GA AACCCCTGGAATATTCCCGACC-3′, nt −114 to −91 of the human HSP70 gene). For supershift assays, 2 μg of antibodies to heat shock factor HSF1 or HSF2 (30Nakai A. Kawazoe Y. Tanabe M. Nagata K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5268-5278Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) were incubated with nuclear extract for 30 min at room temperature before addition of32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe. Consistent with our previous observations with human head and neck or colorectal cancer cells (22Matsuo K. Kohno K. Sato S. Uchiumi T. Tanimura H. Yamada Y. Kuwano M. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1085-1090PubMed Google Scholar, 23Hirohashi Y. Hidaka K. Sato S. Kuwano M. Kohno K. Hisatsugu T. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1995; 86: 1097-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), Northern blot analysis revealed that exposure of T24 cells to 43 °C for 1 h resulted in an initial small decrease in the amount of topoIIα mRNA, which was followed by an increase in transcript abundance that was maximal (∼3-fold) at 24 h (Fig. 1). The amount of HSP70mRNA was increased immediately after heat treatment, reaching a maximum (∼18-fold induction) at 1 h. In contrast, the amount of topoI mRNA was not affected by heat stress. The HSP70and topoIIα genes thus showed characteristics of immediate-early and late genes, respectively, in response to heat shock. We measured the basal transcriptional activity of the topoIIα gene promoter in T24 cells transiently transfected with various luciferase reporter plasmids (Fig. 2). Maximal luciferase activity was obtained with the reporter construct with the pTIIα−295 insert, which contains four ICEs, the GC box, and the HSE between nt −295 and +85 of the topoIIα gene. Stepwise deletion of ICE3, ICE2, and the combination of ICE1, GC box, and HSE from the 5′-end of the promoter resulted in marked -fold decreases in luciferase activity, in general agreement with previous results (11Hochhauser D. Stanway C.A. Harris A.L. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18961-18965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Exposure at 43 °C for 1 h of T24 cells transiently transfected with the reporter construct containing pTIIα−295 resulted in an initial ∼80% decrease in luciferase activity, followed by an increase that was maximal (3-fold) 24 h after heat treatment (Fig. 3). This experiment was repeated with two T24 cell lines stably transfected with the pTIIα−295 luciferase construct. Again, luciferase activity was decreased immediately after heat treatment, but then showed a time-dependent increase that was maximal (3–4-fold) after 24 h (data not shown). To identify the promoter sequences responsible for conferring sensitivity to heat shock, we measured luciferase activity 24 h after exposure to 43 °C for 1 h of T24 cells transiently transfected with various topoIIα gene promoter constructs (Fig. 4). Heat shock increased luciferase activity ∼3-fold in cells transfected with pTIIα−295, pTIIα−197, pTIIα−154, or pTIIα−74, but did not increase luciferase activity in cells transfected with pTIIα−20. The promoter sequence between nt −74 and −20, which contains ICE1, the GC box, and the HSE, thus appears to mediate transcriptional activation by heat shock. The roles of ICE1, the GC box, and the HSE in heat induction of topoIIα gene promoter activity were investigated in T24 cells transiently transfected with luciferase reporter plasmids containing promoter sequences with specific mutations in these elements: GGATTGGCT in ICE1 was converted to GGAAAAACT (pTIIα−295m5), GGGCGGG in the GC box to AAAAAAG (pTIIα−295m6), and GGAAGGTTCAAGTG in the HSE to GAAAGGAAAAAATG (pTIIα−295m7) (Fig. 5 A). The pTIIα−295m5 construct showed increased basal transcriptional activity, but luciferase activity was not increased further by heat shock (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, heat shock increased the transcriptional activities of pTIIα−295m6 and pTIIα−295m7 ∼3-fold; the transcriptional activities of these two plasmids were ∼30 and 10%, respectively, of that of the wild-type plasmid. Thus, a factor that binds to ICE1 might negatively regulate basal promoter activity, and ICE1 appears to play a key role in heat-induced activation of the topoIIα gene promoter. Whereas the GC box and HSE appear to contribute to basal promoter activity, they do not appear to be directly responsible for heat-induced promoter activation. We next investigated the effects of heat shock on the ICE (Y-box) binding proteins and HSFs with the use of EMSAs. A marked decrease in Y-box binding activity was apparent 3, 6, 12, and 24 h after heat shock (Fig. 6 A). Formation of the complex was inhibited in the presence of either excess unlabeled oligonucleotide. EMSAs performed with a typical HSE derived from the human HSP70.1 gene revealed the absence of a retarded signal in untreated cells (Fig. 6 B). A retarded complex was detected with nuclear extracts of cells prepared immediately (0 h) after heat treatment; formation of this complex was inhibited in the presence of excess unlabeled oligonucleotide, and the complex was “supershifted” in the presence of antibodies to HSF1, but not in the presence of antibodies to HSF2. With the HSE of the topoIIα gene as probe, a retarded complex was observed with nuclear extracts prepared from untreated cells and from cells after heat shock (Fig. 6 C). However, the amount of this retarded complex was not affected by heat stress. Formation of this complex was inhibited by excess unlabeled oligonucleotide, but was not affected by antibodies to HSF1 or HSF2. We examined the effects of heat shock on the dimethyl sulfate methylation patterns in the promoter region of the topoIIα gene by in vivo genomic footprint analysis. Both G−64 and G−65 in ICE1 were protected in untreated cells, but protection was markedly reduced 3, 6, and 24 h after heat shock (Fig. 7). Methylation patterns of the GC box, HSE, and other elements in the topoIIα promoter region (nt −295 to +85) were not substantially affected by heat shock stress (data not shown). We have previously shown that expression of the topoIIα gene is increased 6–24 h after exposure of human head and neck or colorectal cancer cells to heat shock stress (22Matsuo K. Kohno K. Sato S. Uchiumi T. Tanimura H. Yamada Y. Kuwano M. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1085-1090PubMed Google Scholar, 23Hirohashi Y. Hidaka K. Sato S. Kuwano M. Kohno K. Hisatsugu T. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1995; 86: 1097-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have shown that heat stress also induced activation of topoIIα gene expression in human urinary bladder cancer cells. This heat-induced up-regulation of topoIIα gene expression appeared to be mediated through an ICE or Y-box located between nt −74 and −21 on the basis of the following results. (i) The luciferase activity of T24 cells transfected with reporter constructs containing pTIIα−295, pTIIα−197, pTIIα−154, or pTIIα−74 was increased ∼3-fold by heat shock stress, whereas that of cells transfected with a construct containing pTIIα−20 was not increased by heat treatment. (ii) Introduction of mutations into ICE1 of the topoIIα gene promoter virtually eliminated the heat shock-induced increase in transcriptional activity, whereas mutation of the GC box or HSE had no such effect. (iii) EMSA analysis with nuclear extracts revealed a marked decrease in ICE1-binding activity 3–24 h after heat shock, consistent with the time course of the heat shock-induced increase in promoter activity, whereas HSE-binding activity was not affected by heat stress. (iv)In vivo genomic footprint analysis revealed a specific change in the methylation pattern of ICE1 induced by heat shock stress. Members of the ICE-binding (YB-1) family of proteins are expressed in a wide range of cell types and function as important regulators of growth-associated and other genes (31Ladomery M. Sommerville J. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 32Ohga T. Koike K. Ono M. Makino Y. Itagaki Y. Tanimoto M. Kuwano M. Kohno K.

In contrast, such elements mediate down-regulation of the expression of genes encoding serum albumin, estrogen-dependent very low density lipoprotein apolipoprotein II, aldolase B, and class II major histocompatibility complex (39Grant C.E.

In the present study, deletion of nt −197 to −155, with contain ICE3, reduced basal promoter activity to about half of that apparent with the topoIIα gene promoter constructs pTIIα−295 and pTIIα−197. Further deletion of nt −154 to −75, containing ICE2, and of nt −74 to −21, containing ICE1, reduced basal promoter activity to ∼10 and 2%, respectively, of that apparent with pTIIα−295. Consecutive deletion of the five ICEs from the topoIIα gene promoter was also previously shown to reduce basal promoter activity in a stepwise manner (11Hochhauser D. Stanway C.A. Harris A.L. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18961-18965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Wang Q. Zambetti G.P. Suttle D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 389-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the ICEs in the promoter of the human topoIIα gene appear to play an important role in basal transcriptional activity. Introduction of point mutations into ICE1 of the topoIIα gene promoter alleviated the inhibition of topoIIα gene expression by wild-type p53 (18Wang Q. Zambetti G.P. Suttle D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 389-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fraser et al. (42Fraser D.J. Brandt T.L. Kroll D.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 696-706PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the topoIIα gene promoter is activated at an early stage during monocytic differentiation of human leukemia cells induced by phorbol ester or sodium butyrate and that this sodium butyrate-dependent up-regulation of topoIIα gene expression is mediated by the promoter region between nt −90 and +90, which contains ICE1. In contrast, inhibition of topoIIα gene promoter activity in confluence-arrested cells appears to be mediated through interaction of the CCAAT-binding factor CBF/NF-Y with ICE2 (43Isaacs R.J. Harris A.L. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16741-16747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In the present study, deletion or mutation of ICE1 in the topoIIα gene promoter prevented the heat shock-induced increase in transcriptional activity. Moreover, both EMSA and in vivogenomic footprint analysis indicated that nuclear ICE1-binding activity was decreased after heat shock stress. These observations indicate that ICE1 negatively regulates the human topoIIα gene and that heat shock stress reverses this effect, possibly by inducing the dissociation of negative regulatory factors from ICE1. The Y-box binding protein YB-1 has been shown to inhibit interferon γ-induced activation of class II major histocompatibility complex genes (41Ting J.P. Painter A. Zeleznik-Le N.J. MacDonald G. Moore T.M. Brown A. Schwartz B.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1605-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In contrast, activation of the human MDR1 gene in response to heat shock, DNA-damaging anticancer agents, or ultraviolet light is mediated by interaction of a Y-box binding protein with an ICE in the promoter of this gene (29Miyazaki M.

Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 147-157PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of YB-1 is also increased in response to genotoxic stress, suggesting that the promoter of the YB-1 gene itself is also sensitive to cytotoxic environmental stimuli (32Ohga T. Koike K.

ICEs thus appear to mediate either negative or positive regulation of specific genes in response to exogenous stimuli. Brandt et al. (21Brandt T.L. Fraser D.J. Leal S. Halandras P.M. Kroll A.R.

In the present study, the basal promoter activity of pTIIα−20 was only 1.6% of that of pTIIα−295, and heat shock did not increase the transcriptional activity of this construct. It is thus unlikely that the Myb-binding site at −16 to −11 plays an important role in the heat activation of promoter activity of the topoIIα gene. Heat shock induces the expression of heat shock-related genes in mammalian cells, and this activation is mediated by HSFs (49Lindquist S. Annu. Rev.

HSFs bind to HSEs, which consist of contiguous arrays of the pentanucleotide motif 5′-NGAAN-3′ present in alternating orientations in the promoter regions of heat shock genes. Most heat-inducible genes, including HSP genes, contain an HSE consisting of four or more pentanucleotide motifs and respond to heat treatment within 1 h concomitant with marked fluctuations in nuclear HSF content (27Konishi T. Nomoto M. Shimizu K. Abe T. Itoh H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 1021-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 30Nakai A. Kawazoe Y. Tanabe M. Nagata K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell.

Our data confirm that HSF1, but not HSF2, binds to the HSE of the human HSP70 gene immediately after heat shock. However, the HSE of the topoIIα gene consists of only two pentanucleotide motifs, and heat shock-induced transcriptional activation of the topoIIα gene was not apparent until 6–24 h after heat treatment. Furthermore, no increase in the binding of nuclear factors to the HSE of the topoIIα gene after heat treatment was apparent by EMSA or in vivo footprint analysis. It is thus unlikely that the HSE in the topoIIα gene promoter is responsible for the heat-induced activation of this gene.

Thus iron supplementation increased the aerobic growth rate, decreased the leakage of sulfite, and diminished sensitivity toward paraquat. Iron supplementation increased the activities of several [4Fe-4S]-containing dehydratases, and this was seen even in the presence of 50 μg/ml of rifampicin, an amount which completely inhibited growth. Assessing the O·̄2 scavenging activity by means of lucigenin luminescence indicated that the iron-enriched sodAsodB cells had gained some means of eliminating O·̄2, which was not detectable as superoxide dismutase activity in cell extracts.

Univalent oxidation of the [4Fe-4S] clusters by O·̄2 leads to loss of iron, leaving [3Fe-4S] clusters and an inactive form of the enzymes. The enzymes can subsequently be reactivated by reductive reconstitution (10Faridoon K.Y. Zhuang H.-Y. Sykes A.G. J. Chem. Soc. 1991; 17: 1141-1142Google Scholar, 11Beinert H. Kennedy M.C. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1442-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Both inactivation and reactivation are ongoing processes in aerobic cells and their balance determines the fractional level of activity of these enzymes (12Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8757-8763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Gardner P.R. Raineri I. Epstein L.B. White C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13399-13405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). One of the functions of superoxide dismutases is to protect these dehydratases against this inactivation by O·̄2. However, there are other means by which O·̄2 can cause damage, both directly and indirectly (14Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1983; 23: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 15Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18515-18517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). This leads to the possibility that consumption of O·̄2 by the reversible inactivation of the dehydratases may serve to prevent these other kinds of damage. In that case, increasing the rates of reactivation of the dehydratases by growing the cells in iron-enriched medium may partially reverse the phenotypic deficits of sodA sodB Escherichia coli. The results reported herein are consistent with that outcome. Bound sulfite was liberated with alkaline cyanide as described by Kunert (16Kunert J. Z. Microbiol. 1973; 13: 489-498Google Scholar) and used recently (17Benov L. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 347: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The liberated sulfite was assayed colorimetrically (17Benov L. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 347: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 18Grant W.M. Anal. Biochem. 1947; 19: 345-347Google Scholar). The strains of E. coliused in these experiments were: AB1157, parental; JI132, sodA sodB (19Imlay J. Linn S. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2967-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar); and pLK1646p GS57, fumA fumC, and overproducing fumarase A by virtue of a multicopy plasmid bearing the fumA gene (20Woods S.A. Schwartzbach S.D. Guest J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 954: 14-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated starter cultures were grown overnight in LB 1LB, Luria Bertani medium; M9CA, M9 medium + casamino acids. and were then used to inoculate M9CA medium at a dilution of 1:200. LB and M9CA were prepared as described by Maniatis et al. (21Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 68-69Google Scholar). Growth in defined medium was achieved by washing cells taken from the overnight cultures 3 times in M9 followed by 200-fold dilution into M9 supplemented with 100 mg/liter of the 20 amino acids, except methionine and cysteine, commonly found in proteins (referred to as 18AA medium). In each case the defined medium also contained 0.2% glucose plus 3 mg/liter each of pantothenic acid and thiamin. Minimal medium contained the vitamins mentioned above plus 100 mg/liter of Thr, Leu, His, Pro, and Arg, and 0.2% glucose. The inocula for growth in minimal medium were taken from overnight anaerobic cultures in this medium. Iron was added as water solutions of FeSO4 or FeCl2sterilized by filtration. Anaerobiosis was achieved in a Coy chamber. Aerobic growth was at 200 rpm. All growth was at 37 °C and was followed turbidimetrically at 600 nm. Iron was determined colorimetrically with α,α′-dipyridyl applied to cell extracts (22Bralet J. Schrieber L. Bouvier C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 979-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Fumarase activity was assayed according to Hill and Bradshaw (23Hill R.L. Bradshaw R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 18: 91-99Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and catalase activity, as described by Beers and Sizer (24Beers R.F. Sizer I.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 195: 133-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aconitase (4Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 2891-2896Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) were assayed as described previously. Adding Fe(II) to the M9CA medium hastened the aerobic growth of the sodA sodB strain. Fe(II), 0.05–0.50 mm, caused a dose-dependent increase in growth. Thus the generation time, which was 84 min in the absence of added Fe(II), was shortened to 72 min by 0.1 mm Fe(II) and to 56 min by 0.5 mmFe(II). The doubling time of the parental strain was 44 min without iron supplementation. The sodA sodB strain grew very slowly in medium lacking the aromatic, branched chain, and sulfurcontaining amino acids, and 0.5 mm Fe(II) exerted a very substantial stimulatory effect. Thus the doubling time, which was ∼630 min without iron, was shortened to 112 min by 0.5 mm Fe(II). Supplementation with 0.5 mm Co(II) or Cu(II) was without effect, whereas 0.5 mm Mn(II) was beneficial but not as much as 0.5 mm Fe(II) (data not shown). Mn(II) has been reported to act as a functional replacement for superoxide dismutase in Lactobacillus plantarum (27Archibald F.S. Fridovich I. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 442-451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in yeast (28Chang E.C. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12172-12178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and mutations in yeast causing accumulation of Mn(II) complemented a lack of the CuZn-superoxide dismutase (29Lapinskas P.J. Cunningham K.W. Liu X.F. Fink G.R. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1382-1388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This effect of Mn(II) can be attributed to the ability of Mn(II) and complexes thereof to catalyze the dismutation and/or the reduction of O·̄2(30Kono Y. Takahashi M. Asada K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 174: 454-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 31Archibald F.S. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 214: 452-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Mn(II) does not participate in Fenton chemistry (32Gutteridge J.M.C. Bannister J.V. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 33Cheton P.L.B. Archibald F.S. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1988; 5: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), whereas Fe(II) does. Hence a protective effect of Mn(II) is not surprising, but a protective effect by Fe(II) demands explanation. The sodA sodB E. coli exhibits an oxygen-dependent requirement for sulfurcontaining amino acids (34Carlioz A. Touati D. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar) and this has been attributed to the leakage of sulfite from the cells (17Benov L. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 347: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 35Benov L. Kredich N.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21037-21040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows that 0.5 mm Fe(II) in the 18AA medium diminished the accumulation of sulfite by the sodA sodB strain (compare bars 1 and 2). Incubation of the medium conditioned by the growth of the sodA sodB cells with 0.5 mm Fe(II) for 24 h did not significantly diminish recovery of sulfite, probably because the sulfite was present as a carbonyl-bisulfite adduct (17Benov L. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 347: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and thus was not subject to rapid metal-catalyzed autoxidation. In any case the data in Fig. 1 have been corrected for the effect of Fe(II) on the recovery of sulfite. Hence the effect of Fe(II) was to decrease leakage of sulfite and not to diminish recovery of sulfite from the medium. As expected there was little leakage of sulfite from the parental strain growing aerobically (bar 4) or from the sodA sodBgrowing anaerobically (bar 3). The sodA sodB strain is ∼100 times more sensitive to paraquat than the superoxide dismutase-replete parental strain (34Carlioz A. Touati D. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the strong growth inhibition imposed by 2 and 4 μm paraquat on the sodA sodB strain (compare lines 4 and 5 with 3). Supplementation with Fe(II) eliminated the effect of paraquat and even allowed faster growth than that seen without paraquat (compare lines 1 and 2 with 3). These low micromolar levels of paraquat were without effect on the growth of the parental strain (data not shown). Growth in iron-supplemented medium did result in greater cell content of iron and the sodA sodB strain accumulated more iron than did the parental strain. Thus both strains contained 2 μmol of iron/mg of protein when grown without added iron, but when grown in the presence of 0.5 mm Fe(II) the sodA sodBcontained 16 and the parental strain 5.5 μmol of iron/mg of protein. The sodA sodB strain was more susceptible to the lethality of H2O2 than the parental strain as has been reported (34Carlioz A. Touati D. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). However, growth in the presence of 0.5 mmFe(II) did not increase the sensitivity of the sodA sodBstrain to H2O2. Thus 30 min of exposure to 2.0 mm H2O2 at 37 °C caused ∼75% loss of viability of washed cells suspended in M9 salts at A 600 nm = 0.5 whether or not they had been grown in Fe(II)-supplemented medium. Although the luminescence elicited from lucigenin is not a reliable measure of the concentration of O·̄2because it can mediate production of O·̄2, it can be used to detect the scavenging of O·̄2 by superoxide dismutase or by other means (36Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 37Vasquez-Vivar J. Hogg N. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Matasek P. Kalyanaraman B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 demonstrates that the sodA sodB cells grown in iron-supplemented medium luminesce less than when grown without such supplementation. The parental strain luminesced much less than the sodA sodBstrain as previously noted (26Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2891-2896Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It thus appears that the sodA sodB cells gained some mechanism of scavenging O·̄2 when grown in iron-enriched medium. Washing the cells prior to addition of lucigenin increased luminescence, but the difference between the iron-rich and normal sodA sodB cells persisted, as did the striking difference between the sodA sodB and parental cells. Growth of the sodA sodB strain in iron-supplemented medium increased cell content of several [4Fe-4S]- containing dehydratase activities. Thus Fig. 4 demonstrates this for aconitase and for dihydroxy acid dehydratase, whereas Fig. 5 makes this point for fumarases A + B in the sodA sodB strain and for fumarase A in a FumA overproducing strain. The data in Figs. 4 and 5 were obtained with cells grown in M9CA medium with and without iron supplementation because that is the medium in which iron supplementation speeded the growth of the sodA sodB strain. It should be noted that the sodA sodB strain grew better in LB than in M9CA, contained ∼10 times more aconitase, and did not show a further growth enhancement with iron supplementation.Figure 5Fumarases. The sodA sodB and fumarase-overproducing strain were grown to A 600 nm = 1.0 in M9CA ± 0.5 mm Fe(II). The washed cells were extracted and assayed for fumarases A + B as described under “Materials and Methods.”Bars 1 = without Fe(II), and bars 2 = with Fe(II).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Whether iron supplementation increased the activities of the [4Fe-4S]-containing dehydratases because of increased reactivation of the oxidatively inactivated enzymes or because it led to more de novo synthesis was explored with an inhibitor of transcription i.e. rifampicin. Iron, at 0.5 mm, increased the activity of aconitase in the sodA sodB strain by 3-fold. Rifampicin at 50 μg/ml, which completely inhibited growth, did not diminish the stimulatory effect of iron (Fig. 4). It follows that the effect of iron was due to reactivation rather than to de novo synthesis. These experiments were performed by adding rifampicin to mid-log cultures in M9CA and then, after 15 min, adding Fe(II) to 0.5 mm to half of the cultures. After further incubation for 90 min, during which A 600 nm did not increase, cells were washed three times with 50 mm Tris at pH 7.6 and extracted and assayed for aconitase as described under “Materials and Methods.” Because of its role in Fenton chemistry, one might anticipate that growing sodA sodB E. coli in iron-supplemented medium would make them more susceptible to oxidative stress. The data presented above show the opposite effect. Thus ironsupplemented cells grew faster in aerobic M9CA medium, leaked less sulfite, and were less susceptible to the growth inhibiting effect of paraquat than unsupplemented cells. The observation that less lucigenin luminescence was seen with the iron-supplemented cells indicates that they had an enhanced O·̄2-scavenging activity. However, no superoxide dismutase activity could be detected in extracts of the iron-supplemented cells. One possibility for the seat of this activity within the cells would be an increased rate of reductive reconstitution of oxidatively inactivated [4Fe-4S]-containing dehydratases. The cycle of oxidative inactivation by O·̄2, followed by reductive reactivation of such clusters, could act as a sink for O·̄2. In keeping with this view, the iron-grown sodA sodB cells contained more aconitase, dihydroxy acid dehydratase, and fumarases A and B activities than cells grown without iron enrichment. Rifampicin, an inhibitor of transcription, did not eliminate this effect of iron on aconitase activity. It follows that the increase in aconitase, caused by iron supplementation, was mainly due to increased reactivation rather than de novo synthesis. Increased reactivation would provide two benefits. One is to provide a sink for O·̄2 that could spare other, nonreactivatable targets of O·̄2 attack. A second benefit would be to maintain the activities of these essential dehydratases high enough to meet the metabolic needs of the cells. Of course such reductive scavenging of O·̄2 is inferior to that achieved by superoxide dismutase in that it produces one H2O2 per O·̄2consumed and also consumes cellular reductants such NADPH. In contrast, superoxide dismutase produces only 0.5 H2O2 per O·̄2 consumed and without consumption of reductants. The failure of iron supplementation to increase the H2O2 sensitivity of E. coli is surprising in view of the demonstrated role of iron released from O·̄2-oxidized [4Fe-4S] clusters in exacerbating the lethality of H2O2 (38Keyer K. Imlay J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13635-13640Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). It appears that iron taken into the cells from the medium is not available to participate in Fenton chemistry, although competent to reconstitute [4Fe-4S] clusters. The relatively trivial explanation that iron supplementation increased catalase activity to a degree that offset increased toxicity was examined and eliminated. Thus the catalase activity of the sodA sodB cells grown with 0.5 mm Fe(II) was equal to that of the control cells (data not shown). We are indebted to Dr. J. R. Guest for the FumA-overproducing strain of E. coli."

The present study directly examines the effects of F-actin on the biochemical properties of eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A, formerly EF1α), a major actin-binding protein. The basal mechanism of eEF1A alone is determined under physiological conditions with the critical finding that glycerol and guanine nucleotide are required to prevent protein aggregation and loss of enzymatic activity. The dissociation constants (K d) for GDP and GTP are 2.5 μm and 0.6 μm, respectively, and the k cat of GTP hydrolysis is 1.0 × 10−3 s−1. When eEF1A binds to F-actin, there is a 7-fold decrease in the affinity for guanine nucleotide and an increase of 35% in the rate of GTP hydrolysis. Based upon our results and the relevant cellular concentrations, the predominant form of cellular eEF1A is calculated to be GTP·eEF1A·F-actin. We conclude that F-actin does not significantly modulate the basal enzymatic properties of eEF1A; however, actin may still influence protein synthesis by sequestering GTP·eEF1A away from interactions with its known translational ligands, e.g. aminoacyl-tRNA and ribosomes.

Actin has been implicated as a co-factor in eukaryotic protein synthesis (reviewed in Refs. 1Nielsen P. Goelz S. Trachsel H. Cell Biol. Int.

Dreyfuss G. Penman S. Cell. 1981; 23: 113-120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it has been shown that virtually all of the protein components of translation associate with the cytoskeleton in situ (7Lawrence J.B. Singer R.H.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); however, no direct effect of the cytoskeleton on the specific activity of any of these co-factors has been demonstrated. Eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A, 1The abbreviations used are: eEF1A, eukaryotic elongation factor 1A; mant-GDP, N-methylanthraniloyl derivative of 2′-deoxy-GDP; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. formerly EF1α) 2An effort has been made to adopt a standardized nomenclature for the co-factors of protein synthesis (13Merrick W.C.

Wyckoff J. Yeung Y-G. Wang Y. Stanley R. Jones J. Segall J. Condeelis J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2705-2714PubMed Google Scholar). The principal role of eEF1A during protein synthesis is to bind aminoacyl-tRNA to the A-site of the ribosome by a GTP-dependent mechanism (17Riis B. Rattan S.I.S. Clark B.F.C. Merrick W.C. Trends Biol. Sci. 1990; 15: 420-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Following the hydrolysis of GTP, aminoacyl-tRNA is incorporated into the growing polypeptide, and GDP·eEF1A is released from the ribosome. The exchange of bound GDP for free GTP regenerates the capacity of eEF1A to bind another aminoacyl-tRNA and to participate in further cycles of elongation. Therefore, the affinity of eEF1A for GDP and GTP and the kinetics of GTP hydrolysis are potential targets for ligands operating through eEF1A to regulate protein synthesis. For example, the rate of GDP/GTP exchange by eEF1A in vitro is too slow to support the measured rate of polypeptide elongation in vivo; therefore, the need for a nucleotide exchange factor has been postulated (18Palmiter R. Cell. 1975; 4: 189-193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 19Janssen G.M.C. Moller W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1773-1778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). eEF1A was identified in a screen for actin binding proteins in Dictyostelium and was shown to bind both monomeric and filamentous actin (F-actin) in vitro and in situ(20Demma M. Warren V. Hock R. Dharmawardhane S. Condeelis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2286-2291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Dharmawardhane S. Demma M. Yang F. Condeelis J. Cell Motil.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1309-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Due to the striking similarity of eEF1A primary sequences among species, it is not surprising that eEF1As purified from many sources display similar actin binding activities in vitro(24Liu G. Tang J. Edmonds B.T. Murray J. Levin S. Condeelis J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 953-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been concluded that actin binding is a well conserved property of all eEF1As. Since actin and eEF1A are very abundant proteins in cells and interact with good affinity (21Dharmawardhane S. Demma M. Yang F. Condeelis J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1991; 20: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 23Murray J.W. Edmonds B.T. Liu G. Condeelis J. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 15222-15230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), the physiological relevance of their interaction deserves investigation. An unusual characteristic of eEF1A is the ability following cell stimulation to cross-link actin filaments into bundles whose properties are unique compared with other actin-containing structures (16Edmonds B.T. Wyckoff J. Yeung Y-G. Wang Y. Stanley R. Jones J. Segall J. Condeelis J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2705-2714PubMed Google Scholar, 21Dharmawardhane S. Demma M. Yang F. Condeelis J. Cell Motil.

Observations that stimulation of many cell types induces an increase in the rate of protein synthesis and a redistribution of specific mRNAs and eEF1A to the F-actin-rich leading edge of lamellipods suggest a link between the protein synthetic activity of eEF1A and its novel bundling of actin filaments at the leading edge (16Edmonds B.T.

Do the eEF1A:actin bundles merely serve as a supporting scaffold upon which translation of these targeted mRNAs occurs, or do actin filaments modulate the enzymatic activity of the cofactors involved in protein synthesis? The present study directly examines the effect of F-actin on the biochemical properties of eEF1A that are relevant to protein synthesis (guanine nucleotide binding and GTP hydrolysis), and a model for how localized protein synthesis may be influenced by the interaction of eEF1A with actin is proposed. All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted. eEF1A was isolated from Dictyostelium discoideum strain AX3L as described previously (26Edmonds B.T. Murray J. Condeelis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15222-15230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), except GDP (50 μm; [eEF1A] + 20 × K d) was included in all buffers. The addition of guanine nucleotide was critical to stabilize the enzymatic activity of the purified eEF1A (see “Results”). When necessary, nucleotide-free eEF1A was prepared by extensive dialysis against a buffer containing 30% glycerol. Under these glycerol-containing, nucleotide-free conditions, the protein was stable for 1 or 2 days at 4 °C. The protein concentration of purified eEF1A was determined spectrophometrically at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient (43,400m−1 cm−1) calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence of the Dictyostelium eEF1A cDNA (10Yang F. Demma M. Warren V. Dharmawardhane S. Condeelis J. Nature. 1990; 347: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The relative accuracy (±10%) of this extinction coefficient was confirmed independently by a total amino acid composition analysis of purified eEF1A (data not shown). In addition, Bradford protein quantitation assays using bovine serum albumin as a standard were within 10% of the value obtained spectrophometrically on the same samples (data not shown). Dictyostelium actin was purified and stored as described elsewhere (30Bresnick A. Condeelis J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 70-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The N-methylanthraniloyl derivative of 2′-deoxy-GDP (mant-GDP) was prepared according to the method of Yang and Leyh (31Yang M. Leyh T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3270-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).N-Methylisatoic anhydride was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene OR). We chose to synthesize the 2′-deoxy compound to obviate complications in experimental interpretation of changes in quantum yield caused by the spontaneous isomerization of the mant moiety between the 2′- and 3′-positions of the ribose ring (32John J. Shohmen R. Feuerstein J. Linke R. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6058-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The authenticity of the mant-GDP compound was assessed spectroscopically, and its purity was determined to be greater than 95% by high pressure liquid chromatography ion exchange chromatography. The binding of mant-GDP to eEF1A was monitored at 22 ± 1 °C using a temperature-controlled Hitachi F2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The mant compound was excited using 350-nm light, and the emitted light was detected at 450 nm. The binding buffer contained 20 mm Pipes, pH 6.5, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 30% glycerol. These conditions were chosen to maximize the binding of actin by eEF1A (see Ref. 26Edmonds B.T. Murray J. Condeelis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15222-15230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). During all experiments, it was critical that the concentration of glycerol be controlled, since variations in glycerol concentration caused changes in the quantum yield of the mant-GDP. Binding experiments were performed by monitoring the change in fluorescent intensity that occurred upon dilution of either a solution containing eEF1A and mant-GDP with an identical solution lacking eEF1A (31Yang M. Leyh T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3270-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) or a solution of eEF1A and mant-GDP with a solution lacking both species (33Winzor D.J. Sawyer W.H. Quantitative Characterization of Ligand Binding. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1995: 37-38Google Scholar). The affinity, binding stoichiometry, and change in quantum yield for mant-GDP were obtained by fitting the experimental data with Origin 4.1 software (Microcal Software) using the Marquardt-Levenberg nonlinear least squares fitting algorithm. The dissociation constant (K d) of native GDP for eEF1A was obtained by monitoring the displacement of mant-GDP bound to eEF1A by increasing concentrations of native GDP. The competitive binding model is described by a third-order polynomial (31Yang M. Leyh T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3270-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar); the appropriate root of the equation was used to fit the data and obtain the binding constant using the Sigma Plot software program (Jandel Scientific). The hydrolysis of GTP by eEF1A was performed at 22 ± 1 °C in the same buffer used for nucleotide binding. For those experiments employing actin, monomeric actin was simultaneously dialyzed and polymerized for 18 h at 4 °C against the same reaction buffer. The resulting F-actin was sheared and then incubated with nucleotide-free eEF1A for 30 min at 22 °C. At pH 6.5, this amount of time is sufficient for the bundling of F-actin by eEF1A to reach equilibrium (23Murray J.W. Edmonds B.T. Liu G. Condeelis J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1309-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 26Edmonds B.T. Murray J. Condeelis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15222-15230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The hydrolysis reaction was initiated by the addition of a mixture of [γ-32P]GTP (NEN Life Science Products) and unlabeled GTP. At various times following the addition of nucleotide, aliquots of the reactions were quenched by mixing with an equal volume of 50 mm EDTA, 500 μm GTP and GDP, and 2 mm KPO4. The quenched solutions were then boiled for 1 min. The radiolabeled reactants were separated by thin layer chromatography using polyethylenimine cellulose-coated plates developed in 0.9 m guanidine hydrochloride and quantitated using an AMBIS model two-dimensional radioactivity detector (34Nye L. Colclough J.M. Johnson B.J. Harrison R.M. Am. Biotechnol. Lab. 1988; 6: 18-26Google Scholar). The kinetic parameters were evaluated by fitting the data using the weighted least squares program hypero developed by Cleland (35Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar). The binding of eEF1A to F-actin was performed by a co-sedimentation assay as described previously (26Edmonds B.T. Murray J. Condeelis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15222-15230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).Dictyostelium actin (2.0 μm) was co-polymerized with varying concentrations of eEF1A for 18 h at 22 °C in the above nucleotide-binding buffer also containing 1 mm GDP or GTP. For experiments using nucleotide-free eEF1A, the total ATP concentration was increased to 2 mm to control for possible nonspecific charge effects of nucleotides on the binding of eEF1A to F-actin (36Tang J.X. Janmey P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8556-8563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Actin filaments and bound eEF1A were pelleted by centrifugation at 125,000 × g for 45 min in a Beckman Airfuge. Samples from the total mixtures, supernatants, and pellets were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the amounts of eEF1A and actin were quantitated in each sample by laser scanning densitometry of the Coomassie Blue-stained gels (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). The binding and hydrolysis of guanine nucleotides are cardinal aspects of eEF1A function and are central to its physiological roles. A limitation of previous determinations of nucleotide binding constants for eEF1A is the reliance on membrane filtration assays to separate enzyme-nucleotide complexes from free nucleotides (see TableI). Due to the extensive washing required, the use of membrane filtration to detect binding interactions is an inherently inaccurate approach for proteins with dissociation constants above 20 nm and therefore may be unsuitable for eEF1A (37Wang J. Yamamura H.I. Wang W. Roeske W.R. Hulme E.C. Receptor-Ligand Interactions. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, New York1992: 213-234Google Scholar). To assess the nucleotide binding activity of Dictyostelium eEF1A, we synthesized mant-GDP, a fluorescent analog of GDP whose quantum yield changes during interaction with guanine nucleotide-specific enzymes (38Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). This and related compounds have proven to be excellent mimics of native nucleotides in mechanistic studies of other GTPases (32John J. Shohmen R. Feuerstein J. Linke R. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6058-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 39Wagner A. Simon I. Sprinzl M. Goody R.S.

In agreement with others, we find that purification and storage of eEF1A in glycerol is necessary to stabilize its nucleotide binding activity (41Nagata S. Iwasaki K. Kaziro Y. J. Biochem.

The experimental data are well fit by a single binding site model in which each molecule of eEF1A binds a single molecule of mant-GDP (33Winzor D.J. Sawyer W.H. Quantitative Characterization of Ligand Binding. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1995: 37-38Google Scholar). Analysis of the data using a hyperbolic nonlinear least squares fitting algorithm indicates a K d of 2.64 ± 0.16 μm with a binding stoichiometry of 1.0 ± 0.05. Recasting the binding data in the form of a Scatchard plot results in the linear profile expected for one independent binding site (Fig. 1 B). Surprisingly, the mant-GDP binding properties of eEF1A purified without GDP in the running buffers are very different: the stoichiometry of binding is 0.6, and Scatchard plots display the convex profile indicative of positive cooperativity (45Koshland Jr., D.E. Nemethy G. Filmer D. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 365-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (2200) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Since eEF1A possesses only one nucleotide binding site, cooperative nucleotide binding indicates protein-protein interaction. Moreover, the nucleotide binding properties of eEF1A isolated in the presence of GDP irreversibly convert to lower stoichiometries and positive cooperativity after dialysis against nucleotide-free, glycerol-containing buffers (data not shown). Thus, it would appear that glycerol and guanine nucleotides not only are required to stabilize eEF1A in a form that binds nucleotide correctly, but furthermore, the presence of guanine nucleotides is critical to prevent protein aggregation in vitro. A competitive binding experiment using mant-GDP was designed to determine the affinity of eEF1A for native GDP. Increasing concentrations of GDP were titrated into a mixture containing eEF1A (3.0 μm) and mant-GDP (2.0 μm), and changes in the fluorescence intensity were monitored (Fig. 1 C). The K d for GDP was determined by fitting the resulting intensity profile using the appropriate root of a third-order polynomial (31Yang M. Leyh T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3270-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The best fit of the experimental data was obtained with a K d for GDP of 2.5 μm, indicating similar affinities of eEF1A for mant-GDP and GDP. Similarities in the binding of mant-derivative and native nucleotides were also demonstrated for ras (32John J. Shohmen R. Feuerstein J. Linke R. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6058-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) and EF1A (EF-Tu) (39Wagner A. Simon I. Sprinzl M. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12535-12542Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar); thus, our data further confirm mant-GDP as a good mimic for native GDP in nucleotide binding studies. The kinetics of GTP hydrolysis and product release are proposed to regulate elongation; the rate of hydrolysis may influence the fidelity of aminoacyl-tRNA:mRNA codon-anticodon pairing (46Sandbaken M.G. Culbertson M.R. Genetics. 1988; 120: 923-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the rate of GDP/GTP exchange may limit the availability of active GTP·eEF1A for subsequent ternary complex formation (19Janssen G.M.C. Moller W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1773-1778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since product release has been shown to be rate-limiting for other GTPases, an experiment was designed to detect the formation of a single enzyme equivalent of product. Under these conditions, if product release is rate-limiting, a burst of GDP formation will be observed. Fig. 2 A shows a typical progress curve with eEF1A (1.0 μm) under saturating concentrations of GTP (20 μm; 20 ×K m). The hydrolysis products32Pi and GDP were separated from [γ-32P]GTP by thin layer chromatography and quantitated by a two-dimensional scanning radioactivity detector. Two important observations can be made from this experiment. First, there is no evident burst of GDP formation (although under these assay conditions a tiny burst will not be detected). This result indicates that product release is not rate-limiting for eEF1A, a conclusion further borne out by the linearity of the hydrolysis reaction over multiple enzyme turnovers. These results are in contrast to prokaryotic EF1A (EF-Tu), where GTP hydrolysis slows dramatically after one enzyme equivalent of product has formed (47Fasano O. De Vendittis E. Parmeggiani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3145-3150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the measured rate constant for GTP hydrolysis (k cat), 1 × 10−3 s−1, is 3–6-fold faster than those reported for other eEF1As (see Table I). The source of this latter difference is probably related to glycerol and enzyme stability; when we omit glycerol,k cat falls to levels comparable with the other eEF1As (∼0.2 × 10−3 s−1). Initial rate studies were performed to determine the kinetic constants for the hydrolysis of GTP by eEF1A. The rates were determined under initial velocity conditions; the reactions were allowed to proceed to less than 10% of their end points. The concentration of GTP substrate was varied in even increments in reciprocal space from 0.1 to 25 μm. A double reciprocal plot of the data is shown in Fig. 2 B. The data were fit using the weighted least squares program hypero developed by Cleland (35Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar). The kinetic constants are as follows: K m = 0.60 ± 0.12 μm;k cat = 1.07 ± 0.07 × 10−3 s−1. If nucleotide association and dissociation are fast compared with cleavage, the binding reaction is near equilibrium, and the Michaelis constant (K m) provides a measure of thermodynamic affinity; i.e. K m ∼ K d. The physical basis for this equivalence can be appreciated by considering the case where GTP is not hydrolyzed; given sufficient time, the binding steps will equilibrate. If GTP hydrolysis were then allowed to occur at a rate that is insignificant compared with the adsorption and desorption of GTP, the binding steps would remain essentially at equilibrium. In this case, the double-reciprocal plot (Fig. 2 B) represents an equilibrium titration of the enzyme, and the value of K m obtained provides an excellent approximation of the K d. A two-stage mixing experiment was designed to determine if exchange between the eEF1A-bound and free pools of GTP is fast compared with product formation (48Wang R. Liu C. Leyh T.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 490-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To perform this experiment, eEF1A is first mixed with a saturating concentration of [γ-32P]GTP (10 μm, 10 × K d). This solution is quickly diluted 5% by hand with a concentrated solution of unlabeled GTP, producing a final unlabeled GTP concentration 100 times that of the labeled GTP. If the exchange of enzyme-bound and free nucleotide is slow compared with hydrolysis, a fraction of the eEF1A-bound [γ-32P]GTP, present at t = 0 of mixing, will be converted to product. If, however, GTP exchanges quickly compared with hydrolysis, the eEF1A-bound labeled GTP will be displaced by the exogenous unlabeled GTP, and no further32Pi will be produced. As can be seen from Fig. 2 C, th"
https://openalex.org/W2046814313,"The Numb protein is involved in cell fate determination during Drosophila neural development. Numb has a protein domain homologous to the phosphotyrosine-binding domain (PTB) in the adaptor protein Shc. In Shc, this domain interacts with specific phosphotyrosine containing motifs on receptor tyrosine kinases and other signaling molecules. Residues N-terminal to the phosphotyrosine are also crucial for phosphopeptide binding to the Shc PTB domain. Several amino acid residues in Shc have been implicated by site-directed mutagenesis to be critical for Shc binding to receptor tyrosine kinases. We have generated homologous mutations in Numb to test whether, in vivo, these changes affect Numb function during Drosophila sensory organ development. Two independent amino acid changes that interfere with Shc binding to phosphotyrosine residues do not affect Numb activity in vivo. In contrast, a mutation shown to abrogate the ability of the Shc PTB domain to bind residues upstream of the phosphotyrosine virtually eliminates Numb function. Similar results were observed in vitro by examining the binding of the Numb PTB domain to proteins from Schneider S2 cells. Our data confirm the importance of the PTB domain for Numb function but strongly suggest that the Numb PTB domain is not involved in phosphotyrosine-dependent interactions.

During the development of an organism, different cell fates can be acquired through both intrinsic or extrinsic mechanisms. In an intrinsic mechanism, a certain factor in the cell is asymmetrically distributed within the mother cell, such that when the mother cell undergoes cytokinesis, the factor is distributed differentially to the two daughter cells. Conversely, in an extrinsic mechanism, the daughter cell receives signals from neighboring cells (or its own sibling cell) to acquire a certain cell fate. The Numb protein represents a key point in linking both intrinsic and extrinsic means of assigning cell fates during asymmetric divisions in the Drosophila peripheral nervous system (Refs. 1Rhyu M.S.

In Drosophila, Numb is necessary for the asymmetric division of cells in neural lineages (1Rhyu M.S. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N.

Goodman C.S. Doe C.Q. Development. 1995; 121: 3489-3494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of simple external sensory organ lineages, the sensory organ precursor undergoes two sets of divisions as follows: the first set produces two daughter cells (IIa and IIb), and the second set produces a bristle and socket cell from the IIa cell and a neuron and glial cell from the IIb cell (Fig. 1 A). Numb protein has been shown to be localized to one side of the sensory organ precursor prior to division (1Rhyu M.S. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cell. 1994; 76: 477-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). After cell division it is then segregated asymmetrically to only the IIb cell. In numb mutants, the IIb daughter cell is transformed to a IIa cell fate resulting in two sets of bristle and socket cells (1Rhyu M.S. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cell. 1994; 76: 477-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). In numb mosaics, occasionally four socket cells are observed suggesting that Numb is also needed during the second division (Fig. 1 B). Conversely, when Numb protein is overexpressed, the IIa cell is transformed into a IIb cell, resulting in two sets of neuron and glial cells (see Fig. 1 C, balding; Ref. 1Rhyu M.S. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cell. 1994; 76: 477-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). When Numb is overexpressed after the first cell division, only the second stage of the lineage is affected, resulting in a transformation of a socket to a bristle cell (see Fig. 1 D,twinning) or a glia into a neuron (1Rhyu M.S. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cell. 1994; 76: 477-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Genetic studies have indicated that numb functions to antagonize signaling by the Notch receptor (2Guo M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Neuron. 1996; 17: 27-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 9Spana E.P. Doe C.Q. Neuron. 1996; 17: 21-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Lack of Notch function leads to an increase in neuronal cells in the Drosophila peripheral nervous system, whereas activated Notch leads to a decrease in cells adopting the neuronal fate (2Guo M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Neuron. 1996; 17: 27-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 10Hartenstein V. Posakony J.W. Dev. Biol. 1990; 142: 13-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). A reduction in Notch signaling partially suppresses the numb mutant phenotype leading to the generation of some neuronal cells. These data suggest that numb functions to inhibit Notch signaling and thus promotes the neuronal phenotype. Furthermore, there is evidence that Notch binds directly to the Numb PTB 1The abbreviations used are: PTB, phosphotyrosine-binding domain; Eve, Evenskipped; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Shc, Src homologous and collagen protein; EGF, epidermal growth factor; NGF, nerve growth factor; UAS, upstream activation sequence;w, white; pY, phosphotyrosine. 1The abbreviations used are: PTB, phosphotyrosine-binding domain; Eve, Evenskipped; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Shc, Src homologous and collagen protein; EGF, epidermal growth factor; NGF, nerve growth factor; UAS, upstream activation sequence;w, white; pY, phosphotyrosine. domain (2Guo M.

The phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain of Numb is critical for Numb function but not for the asymmetric localization of Numb (11Frise E. Knoblich J.A. Younger-Shepherd S. Jan L.Y. Jan N.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11925-11932Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The PTB domain was first described in the protein, Shc, and was subsequently identified by sequence homology to be present in several other proteins including Numb (12Bork P. Margolis B.

Med. 1996; 128: 235-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The PTB domain of Numb and Shc are 20% identical at the amino acid level (Fig. 2 A, see Refs. 12Bork P. Margolis B. Cell. 1995; 80: 693-694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar and17Zhou M.-M. Ravichandran K.S. Olejniczak E.T. Petros A.M. Meadows R.P. Sattler M. Harlan J.E. Wade W.S. Burakoff S.J. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1995; 378: 584-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), suggesting that the Numb PTB domain may act similarly to the Shc PTB domain in mediating signal transduction events by binding to the NPXpY motif (18Dikic I.

In Shc, the PTB domain binds a ΨXNPXpY motif on receptor tyrosine kinases, where Ψ is a hydrophobic residue, X is any amino acid residue, N is asparagine, P is proline, and pY is phosphotyrosine. Several individual amino acid residues in Shc have been implicated by site-directed mutagenesis to be critical for Shc binding to the ΨXNPXpY motif (17Zhou M.-M. Ravichandran K.S. Olejniczak E.T.

These include residues involved in binding the phosphotyrosine as well as residues necessary for contacting the amino acids upstream of the phosphotyrosine in the ΨXNPXpY peptide. An important question is whether all or only some of the PTB domains are involved in phosphotyrosine-dependent interactions (21Borg J.-P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1997; 272: 6399-6405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In an attempt to address whether or not the Numb PTB domain is involved in phosphotyrosine binding, we generated point mutants in the Numb PTB domain analogous to those generated in Shc (19Yajnik V. Blaikie P. Bork P. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1813-1816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Borg J.-P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Two of these mutations affect conserved residues involved in the binding of the Shc PTB domain to phosphotyrosine. These are serine 148 and arginine 171 of Numb. Another mutation targets phenylalanine 195 of Numb. In Shc, this phenylalanine binds to the hydrophobic residue −5 and the asparagine −3 to the phosphotyrosine without directly interacting with phosphotyrosine (17Zhou M.-M. Ravichandran K.S. Olejniczak E.T. Petros A.M. Meadows R.P. Sattler M. Harlan J.E. Wade W.S. Burakoff S.J. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1995; 378: 584-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Finally, a fourth mutation, phenylalanine to leucine 149 of Numb, which results in reduced binding affinity of the Shc PTB domain, was also tested. We have examined how these mutations affect Numb function in vivo both during Drosophila sensory organ development and mesodermal development. The phenylalanine to valine mutation (amino acid residue 195) is able to virtually eliminate the gain-of-Numb function when overexpressed in transgenic flies using the UAS-GAL4 system (27Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Altering the residues in Numb homologous to those involved in Shc phosphotyrosine binding has little or no effect on the lineage transformation activity of Numb overexpression in vivo. Another mutation, phenylalanine to leucine (position 149), which causes Shc to bind with a reduced affinity in vitro, exhibits an intermediate phenotype in vivo. In binding studies using Drosophila cell culture, we detect several proteins that bind to the wild-type PTB domain and to the S148A and R171Q mutants but not to the F195V mutant of Numb. These data with site-directed mutagenesis confirm that the PTB domain is crucial for Numb function but strongly suggest that phosphotyrosine is not required for Numb PTB domain function in vivo. Wild-type Numb PTB domain GST fusion protein constructs were made by subcloning a polymerase chain reaction-generated fragment of numb DNA spanning the 966–1490-base pair region of numb cDNA into the pGSTag vector (28Ron D. Dressler H. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 866-869PubMed Google Scholar) in the EcoRI site. PTB domain point mutants were generated by polymerase chain reaction-based site-directed mutagenesis from the wild-type pGSTag-Numb PTB domain. The full-length numb cDNA (760–2800 base pairs) was subcloned into the pUAST vector in the KpnI site. Site-directed mutagenesis of full-length numb was done by using Transformer Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH) or U.S.E. Mutagenesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A Myc epitope tag was attached to the C-terminal end of the Numb coding region. All constructs were sequenced using Sequenase version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). To assay for the expression of both wild-type and Numb protein, a Western blot was performed. The UAS-Numb flies (wild-type and mutant) were crossed to the daG32-GAL4 driver (29Wodarz A. Hinz U. Engelbert M. Knust E. Cell. 1995; 82: 67-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Embryos from this cross were collected from 0 to 8 h at 25 °C or 0 to 16 h at 18 °C. They were then washed in NaCl/Triton X (0.7% NaCl, 0.04% Triton X-100), dechorionated in 50% bleach in NaCl/Triton X, and then washed again in NaCl/Triton X, followed by a wash in PBT (0.1 mNaPO4, 0.3% deoxycholate, 0.5% Triton X-100). The embryos were then lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2 with 1 mm EGTA, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100) with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 100 mmsodium fluoride, 200 mm sodium vanadate, and 10 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate by grinding using a Dounce homogenizer. Lysates were then subjected to electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was then blotted with anti-Numb antibody (1Rhyu M.S. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cell. 1994; 76: 477-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Notch expressing Schneider S2 cells (30Lieber T. Kidd S. Alcamo E. Corbin V. Young M.W. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1949-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) were grown at room temperature in Schneider cell media (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and expression maintained with 200 mg/ml hygromycin B. Notch expression was induced by heat shock at 37 °C for 30 min followed by recovery at room temperature for 2 h. The cells were then lysed in lysis buffer (50 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2 with 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). PC12 cells overexpressing TrkA receptor were stimulated with EGF or NGF for 5 min at 37 °C as described (12Bork P. Margolis B.

Wild-type Schneider cells were first grown to 90% confluency. The cells were then placed in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% heat-treated fetal bovine serum. Cells were labeled for 4 h in the same media with [35S]methionine (80 μCi/ml; Easytag Express Labeling Mix, Life Science Products). Cells were then rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer with proteases and phosphatase inhibitors. GST (glutathione S-transferase) fusion proteins were expressed and bound to glutathione-agarose beads using standard protocols (13Blaikie P. Immanuel D. Wu J. Li N. Yajnik V. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32031-32034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins of the various Numb constructs were quantitated by SDS-PAGE, and the equal amounts were incubated with radiolabeled Schneider cell lysates for 90 min at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer, boiled in 1× sample buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was then fixed and treated with Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) prior to drying and subsequent autoradiography. For Western blotting, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and blotted with antibody directed against the intracellular domain of Notch (C17.9C6; kindly provided by S. Artavanis-Tsakonas) or anti-phosphotyrosine (12Bork P. Margolis B. Cell. 1995; 80: 693-694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The UAS-Numb constructs were purified on a CsCl gradient and then coprecipitated with the pπ25.7wcΔ2-3 transposase helper plasmid (31Karess R.E. Rubin G.M.

Open table in a new tab The wild-type and mutant UAS-Numb flies were crossed to several different GAL4 driver lines that were kindly donated by several different laboratories including that of Gerhard Technau (60-GAL4, 189-GAL4, and 281-GAL4), Elisabeth Knust (daG32-GAL4, Ref.29Wodarz A. Hinz U. Engelbert M. Knust E. Cell. 1995; 82: 67-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), Gabrielle Boulianne (C96-GAL4, Ref. 32Gustafson K. Boulianne G.L. Genome. 1996; 39: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center (32B-GAL4 and 71B-GAL4, Ref. 27Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many of the imaginal GAL4 lines used (including 60-GAL4, 189-GAL4, 281-GAL4, 32B-GAL4, and 71B-GAL4) exhibited a mix of twinning and bristle loss over much of the fly body, including the wing margin, to varying degrees (data not shown). The phenotype was restricted to the body bristles, with an essentially wild-type wing margin, in UAS-Numb;160-GAL4 flies. Conversely, one GAL4 driver, C96-GAL4 (32Gustafson K. Boulianne G.L. Genome. 1996; 39: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), when crossed to UAS-Numb, exhibited a moderate degree of twinning of the wing margin bristles but an essentially wild-type body bristle phenotype (see Fig. 3 B). To assay the effect of wild-type and mutant Numb on mesoderm development, a double GAL4 line of twist-GAL4;24B-GAL4 (Refs. 27Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 33Greig S. Akam M. Nature. 1993; 362: 630-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) was used (this line was constructed and kindly donated by Wendy Lockwood). To assay for the relative strength of the different mutations, several independent lines of the UAS-Numb wild-type and mutant flies were crossed to 189-GAL4 flies. The number of missing macrochaetae were scored and tabulated in Table I. Rarely, a twinned macrochaetae was observed with this driver, and these were scored the same as a missing macrochaetae. To examine the effects of the UAS-Numb constructs (wild-type and mutant) during embryonic development, the UAS-Numb flies were crossed to a daG32-GAL4 line (29Wodarz A. Hinz U. Engelbert M. Knust E. Cell. 1995; 82: 67-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) for assaying neuronal development and twist-GAL4;24B-GAL4 for assaying mesodermal development. The embryos from this cross were then collected, dechorionated, and fixed as described previously (34Bodmer R. Jan Y.N. Roux's Arch. Dev. Biol. 1987; 196: 69-77Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The neurons were then visualized using the 22C10 monoclonal antibody (35Zipursky S.L. Venkatesh T.R. Teplow D.B. Benzer S. Cell. 1984; 36: 15-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) at a concentration of 1:50. Cardiac and muscle cells were visualized with an anti-Evenskipped antibody (36Frasch M. Hoey T. Rushlow C. Doyle H. Levine M. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) used at a concentration of 1:10,000. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) was used as the secondary antibody at a concentration of 1:200. Imaginal discs for immunohistochemical staining were prepared and stained as described by Patel (37Patel N.H. Goldstein L.S.B. Fryberg E.A. Drosophila melanogaster: Practical Uses in Cell and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 445-487Google Scholar). Anti-Myc antibody (9E10) was used at a 1:50 dilution to visualize transgenic Numb overexpression. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad) was used as the secondary antibody at a concentration of 1:200. Since we wanted to determine if the Numb PTB domain functions in vivo in a fashion analogous to the Shc PTB domain, we decided to use Numb overexpression within the Drosophila peripheral nervous system as our assay. The UAS-GAL4 system (27Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used so that Numb could be induced specifically in ectodermal tissues, either during embryonic or pupal development. The full-length wild-type Numb cDNA, tagged with a Myc epitope, was subcloned into the pUAST vector (27Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and several transgenic lines were generated (see Fig. 2 B; Table I). As expected, many different phenotypes, corresponding to those observed by Rhyu et al. (1Rhyu M.S. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cell. 1994; 76: 477-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar), were observed when the wild-type Numb was overexpressed under the control of different GAL4 drivers, presumably because the different GAL4 drivers are turning on Numb expression at different points in the neural lineages (for details about some of the GAL4 drivers tested see “Materials and Methods”). When Numb is overexpressed before the first division of the sensory organ precursor, no bristles or sockets are formed, because the corresponding cells are transformed into neurons and glial cells in a simple external sensory organ lineage (Fig. 1 C,balding). However, when Numb protein is overexpressed only after the first division in the sensory organ precursor lineage, a transformation of sockets into bristles is observed (Fig. 1 D, twinning). An example of the twinning phenotype can be seen in Fig. 3 B, where overexpression of wild-type UAS-Numb driven by the C96-GAL4 driver (32Gustafson K. Boulianne G.L. Genome. 1996; 39: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) resulted in twinning of bristles on the wing margin. One of the most striking phenotypes observed was seen in the progeny of 189-GAL4 crossed to UAS-Numb, in which most of the bristles on the body were missing compared with wild type (see Fig. 3, A and B, and Table I). We chose to use this GAL4 driver for our assay, since any reduction in Numb activity might be expected to produce a less severe phenotype, intermediate between the extensive baldness observed with wild-type Numb overexpression and the normal bristle pattern observed in wild-type flies. The PTB domain of Shc has been extensively characterized in vitro using site-directed mutagenesis (17Zhou M.-M. Ravichandran K.S. Olejniczak E.T. Petros A.M. Meadows R.P. Sattler M. Harlan J.E.

An alignment of the human Shc PTB domain and the Drosophila Numb PTB domain is shown in Fig. 2 A. The amino acids indicated by asterisks in Fig. 2 A have been identified as being crucial for Shc PTB domain binding and are conserved in the Numb PTB domain. The Shc F198V mutation inhibits binding of the Shc PTB domain to a number of receptor tyrosine kinase targets (19Yajnik V. Blaikie P. Bork P. Margolis B. J. Biol.

A homologous mutation was made in the Drosophila Numb PTB domain, F195V, within a full-length Numb construct in the pUAST vector (Fig. 2). Four transgenic lines were made from this construct and crossed to both embryonic and imaginal GAL4 driver lines (see “Materials and Methods”). The progeny from these crosses appeared almost indistinguishable from wild type (Fig. 3 E, compare with Fig. 3 A). There is strong evidence to suggest that this mutant Numb protein is being expressed at high levels. In Western blot analysis, a higher level of Numb protein is seen in the progeny of daG32-GAL4 crossed to UAS-Numb relative to the amount observed in wild-type flies, suggesting that the Numb F195V mutant protein is strongly induced (Fig. 4 A). Furthermore, by using immunohistochemical staining with an antibody that recognizes the Myc epitope tag on the transgenic Numb protein, strong expression of both wild-type and Numb F195V was observed in larval third instar wing discs (Fig. 4 B). Finally, a very low number of duplicated bristles and/or missing bristles (3.3% macrochaetae per fly compared with 0.5% in wild type"

Both the 12 and 81 nucleotide insertions are found in hTH4. The four isoforms of hTH are differently distributed among tissues. Brain and adrenal medulla contain mainly the hTH1 and hTH2 isoforms. Detectable amounts of hTH3 and hTH4 are found in human pheochromocytoma tumors. The active site of TH lies in the C-terminal domain where the physiological co-substrate (6R)-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) binds. The enzyme requires Fe(II) and O2for the hydroxylation reaction. The molecular weight of the purified active TH indicates that it is a tetramer. A leucine zipper motif in the C terminus of TH might contribute to tetramerization (11Vrana K.E. Walker S.J. Rucker P. Liu X. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 2014-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The N terminus acts as a regulatory domain. It contains four serines that can be phosphorylated by several kinases including cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM-PKII), and protein kinase C (12Haycock J.

The four isoforms of hTH have been produced in frog oocytes (19Horellou P. Le Bourdellès B. Clot-Humbert J. Guibert B. Leviel V. Mallet J. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 652-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and appear to have different and specific enzymatic properties. To delineate their characteristics, TH isoforms have been produced in bacteria and purified to homogeneity. The activities and effects of phosphorylation by PKA and CaM-PKII have been described for hTH1 and hTH2 (20Le Bourdellès B. Horellou P. Le Caer J.P. Denèfle P. Latta M. Haavik J. Guibert B. Mayaux J.F. Mallet J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17124-17130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sutherland et al. (21Sutherland C. Alterio J. Campbell D.G. Le Bourdellès B. Mallet J. Haavik J. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 715-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) recently studied the activities of the four human TH following phosphorylation by mitogen-activated protein kinases. We here report further studies of the hTH3 isoform in its unphosphorylated state and following phosphorylation by PKA and CaM-PKII. We determined the initial velocity conditions of the enzyme and established that the co-substrate BH4 exerts an inhibitory effect and that thel-dopa synthesis activity of hTH3 is not regulated by phosphorylation. The particular properties of hTH3 may be relevant to diseases affecting dopaminergic cells. To construct the hTH3 pET expression vector, a DNA fragment containing the nucleotide sequence of the exons 1a and 2 and 84 base pairs of the exon 3 of human TH gene, was synthesized by polymerase chain reaction. hTH3 cDNA inserted into pSPT18 (19Horellou P. Le Bourdellès B. Clot-Humbert J. Guibert B. Leviel V. Mallet J. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 652-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was used as the template. The amplified fragment was inserted between the NdeI and NotI restriction sites of hTH1 cDNA which was in turn inserted into the expression vector pET-3a (20Le Bourdellès B. Horellou P. Le Caer J.P.

The pET-hTH3 construction was sequenced before its introduction into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (22Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4834) Google Scholar, 23Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorf J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar). To ensure that the recombinant hTH3 isoform is correctly expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3), a Western blot experiment was performed using a monoclonal anti-TH antibody (Boehringer Mannheim) at a final dilution of 1:1,000. After washing in 0.2% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline, bound antibody was detected by labeling with 125I-protein A and autoradiography (data not shown). hTH3 was then purified on a large scale from E. coli by a slight modification of a previously published procedure (24Haavik J. Le Bourdellès B. Martinez A. Flatmark T. Mallet J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In brief, the following modifications were used. The bacterial lysate from 36 liters of culture was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column. After washing the column with 20 mm Tris maleate, pH 7.0, the protein was eluted onto a heparin-Sepharose column using 0.3 m Tris-HCl in 20 mm Tris maleate, pH 7.0. The protein was eluted from the heparin-Sepharose column with 0.3 m KCl in 20 mm Tris maleate and, after concentration, was subjected to Sephacryl S-300 chromatography. The protein preparations had an estimated purity of 80% as assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein concentrations were determined according to the method of Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The molecular weight of the purified hTH3 was determined by electrospray mass spectrometry. Five micrograms of protein in 10 μl of a solution of acetonitrile/water/formic acid (50/50/0.2%) was injected at 2 μl/min into a Platform mass spectrometer (Fisons Instruments, Manchester, UK) previously calibrated with myoglobin. TH activity was assayed as described previously (26Reinhard J.F. Smith G.K. Nichol C.A. Life Sci. 1986; 39: 2185-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) with some modifications. We determined the initial velocity conditions by working with different quantities of purified recombinant hTH3, as given in Fig. 3. Kinetic assays were carried out at 30 °C in a total volume of 100 μl containing 100 mm Na-Hepes buffer, pH 6.9, 0.2 μCi of [3H]tyrosine, 20 μml-tyrosine (Sigma), 0.5 mg/ml catalase (Sigma), 0.1 mmFeSO4, and BH4 (Schircks Laboratory, Jona, Switzerland) as specified in the figure legends. Purified TH3 and TH1 (1 μg) were phosphorylated by either PKA or CaM-PKII. The conditions for the phosphorylation reaction (total volume 10 μl) were as follows: 20 mm Na-Hepes, pH 6.9, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mg/ml ovalbumin, 0.1 mm ATP, and [γ-32P]ATP (1300 cpm/pmol). TH was phosphorylated by CaM-PKII in the same assay mix, except that 1 mm CaCl2 and 30 μg/ml calmodulin were also included. Purified protein kinases were used in the following amounts: 120 units of the catalytic subunit of PKA (from bovine heart, Sigma) and 45 units of the CaM-PKII (from rat brain, generously provided by Dr. J. A. Girault, CNRS-Collège de France, Paris). To evaluate the ratio of phosphate incorporation, the reactions were stopped after 10 min at 30 °C by the addition of 1.0 ml of 25% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and left to stand for 10 min. The suspensions were then filtered through GF/C glass filters (Whatman), and the filters were washed with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid to remove ATP, and radioactivity was measured. Phosphorylation stoichiometries were calculated using a subunit mass of 60 kDa. The PKA or CaM-PKII phosphorylation reaction medium containing hTH (180 μg) was desalted by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography using an RP300 C8 column. After phosphorylation by CaM-PKII, the eluted peak containing radioactive material was composed of labeled phosphorylated hTH and of calmodulin-protein kinase II which co-elutes because the molecular mass of its subunit is similar to that of the hTH (58–60 kDa). The eluted phosphorylated protein was digested at 30 °C for 20 h with 3 μg of trypsin in a total volume of 200 μl, containing 0.1 m Tris, pH 8, 0.2 m guanidinium chloride, and 2 mm calcium chloride. Tryptic peptides were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography on a Vydac C18 column (2.1 mm internal diameter, 15 cm length). Phosphorylated hTH tryptic peptides were localized by monitoring the 32P radioactivity in Tcherenkov mode, using an on-line radiomatic flow beta detector (the cell detection volume was 25 μl) coupled with an UV 441 Waters detector at 214 nm. Peptides were eluted with a 0.32% per min linear gradient of acetonitrile in buffer A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water) and buffer B (0.9% trifluoroacetic acid in 80% acetonitrile in water), at a flow rate of 200 μl/min. The labeled phosphorylated tryptic fragments of TH were identified by comparison of their elution time with the elution time of synthetic phosphorylated peptides used as markers. The synthetic peptides (Altergen) used as standards had the same amino acid sequences as three tryptic fragments of hTH as follows: peptide 1, AVS(PO3H2)ELDAK; peptide 2, RQS(PO3H2)LIEDAR; peptide 3, GQS(PO3H2)PR. Peptides 1–3 contain the unlabeled phosphorylated serine residues 19, 40, and 31, respectively (numbers correspond to positions in the hTH1 sequence). hTH3 was produced in the E. coli Bl 21(DE3) expression system. The recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity by chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose, heparin-Sepharose, and Sephacryl S-300. The fraction recovered contained an active enzyme with an apparent molecular mass of 240 kDa, consistent with the eluted protein being in tetrameric form. The apparent molecular mass as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was 60 kDa (Fig. 1). The precise mass, determined by mass spectroscopy, was 58082.4 Da. The theoretical mass of TH is 58212.9 Da. The mass difference is equivalent to the average mass of a methionine residue (131.2 Da). Thus, the purified recombinant hTH3 contains the entire deduced amino acid sequence other than, presumably, the N-terminal methionine. The bacterial expression system produces an almost iron-free (24Haavik J. Le Bourdellès B. Martinez A. Flatmark T. Mallet J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and nonphosphorylated enzyme. The effect of phosphorylation on the enzymatic activity of the protein can therefore be easily tested in vitro. We first determined the stoichiometry of the phosphorylation reaction. Ratios of 0.8 and 1.7 mol of phosphate per mol of hTH3 phosphorylated subunit were obtained with PKA and CaM-PKII, respectively. Thus, hTH3 is phosphorylated at one site by PKA and two sites by CaM-PKII. To localize the phosphorylation sites, labeled hTH3 was digested with trypsin, and the tryptic fragments were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography. Synthetic phosphorylated tryptic peptides of hTH were used as markers. These peptides corresponded to regions containing either Ser19, Ser31, or Ser40 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The radioactivity was recovered in a single phosphopeptide fraction which had a retention time identical to that of synthetic phosphopeptide containing the Ser40 (Fig. 2 A). PKA thus phosphorylates the Ser40 of hTH3 as in hTH1. Phosphorylation of hTH3 and hTH1 by CaM-PKII was also investigated. Both hTH1 (data not shown) and hTH3 were found to be phosphorylated on Ser19 and Ser40 (Fig. 2 B), as previously demonstrated for hTH1 (20Le Bourdellès B. Horellou P. Le Caer J.P. Denèfle P. Latta M. Haavik J. Guibert B. Mayaux J.F. Mallet J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17124-17130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, hTH3 has the same phosphorylation sites as hTH1 for PKA and CaM-PKII, and therefore the 27 amino acid insertion between Met30 and Ser31 does not create a new phosphorylation site for either PKA or CaM-PKII. We determined the kinetic properties of nonphosphorylated hTH3 and hTH3 phosphorylated by PKA and CaM-PKII and compared them to those of hTH1. Various experimental conditions were tested to determine the initial velocity of the hydroxylation reaction for hTH3 (Fig. 3 A). The same determination was done for hTH1. For both enzymes the following conditions were deduced to be optimal whether or not the enzymes were phosphorylated by PKA or CaM-PKII (Fig. 3 B): 10 ng of hTH, 20 μml-tyrosine, pH 6.9, incubation time 15 min, 30 °C. These initial velocity conditions were valid over the range of BH4 concentrations from 5 to 500 μm, independent of the phosphorylation state of the enzyme. The activity of hTH3 was measured under the initial velocity conditions with various BH4 concentrations from 5 to 80 μm. The resulting Lineweaver-Burk plots (Fig. 4 A) are typical of a substrate excess inhibition as described by Dixon and Webb (27Dixon M. Webb E.C. Enzymes. Longmans, London1958: 81-85Google Scholar). The curve can be subdivided into two parts: at low co-substrate concentrations the curve is similar to the classic Michaelis-Menten curve; at higher BH4 concentrations the curve reflects inhibition by excess of substrate. According to the typical analysis of substrate excess inhibition kinetics described by Axelrod (28Axelrod J. Biochem. J. 1956; 63: 634-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and Dixon and Webb (27Dixon M. Webb E.C. Enzymes. Longmans, London1958: 81-85Google Scholar), the inhibition constant (K i) was assessed by plotting 1/V versus BH4 concentrations (Fig. 4 B). The experimental results were fitted to the following equation: V = V max × [BH4]/(K m + [BH4] + ([BH4]2/K i)) to determine the apparent Michaelis constant (K m) and the maximal velocity (V max). Kinetic data were then analyzed by nonlinear regression using the Grafit computer package. To evaluate the influence of the phosphorylation on the enzymatic activity, hTH3 was phosphorylated by PKA and CaM-PKII (see “Experimental Procedures”). The kinetic values for hTH3 phosphorylated by CaM-PKII were not significantly different from those of the unphosphorylated enzyme (Table I). In contrast, phosphorylation by PKA had significant effects on hTH3 kinetics. The K i and K m values were increased by 2.3-fold without a change in V max. Thus, the V maxvalue remained constant, whereas the changes in K i and K m had opposite effects. We therefore determined the catalytic constant (k cat) of hTH3.Table IApparent Ki, Km, and Vmax values for human recombinant TH3 and TH1 for its BH4 co-substrateK m 1-aValues are means ± S.E. of five independent experiments, each in duplicate, and using two different hTH3 and hTH1 enzyme preparations.K i 1-aValues are means ± S.E. of five independent experiments, each in duplicate, and using two different hTH3 and hTH1 enzyme preparations.V max 1-aValues are means ± S.E. of five independent experiments, each in duplicate, and using two different hTH3 and hTH1 enzyme preparations.μmnmol/min/mg hTHhTH35.31 ± 0.724.66 ± 2.8589 ± 102hTH3/PKA12.021-bSignificant at 99.9% (Fisher test). ± 1.461.871-bSignificant at 99.9% (Fisher test). ± 3.1558 ± 113hTH3/CAMPKII8.02 ± 0.331.25 ± 5.1618 ± 140hTII119.07 ± 3.353.0 ± 3.9326 ± 97hTH1 PKA7.11-bSignificant at 99.9% (Fisher test). ± 0.762.0 ± 2.5307 ± 851-a Values are means ± S.E. of five independent experiments, each in duplicate, and using two different hTH3 and hTH1 enzyme preparations.1-b Significant at 99.9% (Fisher test). Open table in a new tab Experimental determination of k cat implies maximal velocity conditions. Due to substrate excess inhibition we have determined the BH4concentration yielding to the experimental maximum of velocity. The corresponding BH4 concentrations for the enzyme were found to be 40 and 30 μm BH4 for PKA-phosphorylated and unphosphorylated hTH3, respectively. The kinetics of dopa production by hTH3 were studied under these two conditions, and the corresponding velocities were used to compute the k cat (Table II). The k cat values were similar for PKA-phosphorylated and unphosphorylated hTH3. Consequently, phosphorylation did not modify the enzyme activity, and the increase in K i is presumably compensated exactly by the increase in K m.Table IIApparent k.cat values for human recombinant TH3 and TH1k cat2-aThe values are means of five independent experiments, each in duplicate, with two different hTH3 and hTH1 enzyme preparations.min−1hTH3140.0 ± 0.2hTH3/PKA135.5 ± 0.8hTII129.82-bk cat values for hTH3 and hTH1 are significantly different (99.9% Fisher test). ± 1.7hTH1/PKA61.52-bk cat values for hTH3 and hTH1 are significantly different (99.9% Fisher test).,2-ckcat values for HTH1 phosphorylated or not by PKA are significantly different (99.9% Fisher test). ± 2.42-a The values are means of five independent experiments, each in duplicate, with two different hTH3 and hTH1 enzyme preparations.2-b k cat values for hTH3 and hTH1 are significantly different (99.9% Fisher test).2-c kcat values for HTH1 phosphorylated or not by PKA are significantly different (99.9% Fisher test). Open table in a new tab Under initial velocity conditions, hTH1 was subject to co-substrate excess inhibition (Fig. 4 and Table I), but this inhibition was less pronounced for hTH1 than for hTH3 (higher K i). The K m of BH4 for hTH1 was 3.6-fold higher than that of hTH3. PKA phosphorylation of hTH1, unlike that of hTH3, did not modify its K i value for the co-substrate but, in contrast, decreased its K m by 2.7-fold without changing the V max. Thus, the phosphorylation of hTH1 by PKA activates the enzyme by decreasing its K m of BH4, whereas the other kinetic parameters remain constant (K i and V max values). To compare the activities of hTH3 and hTH1, it was necessary to determine the hTH1k cat, since K m,V max, and K i differ between the two isoforms and have opposite effects on the activity. The k cat values for PKA-phosphorylated and unphosphorylated hTH1 (Table II) confirm the activation of the enzyme following phosphorylation and indicate that hTH3 is enzymatically more active than hTH1. In human, alternative splicing of exons 1 and 2 of the TH primary transcript results in the production of four isoenzymes. A further hTH mRNA species resulting from the skipping of exon 3 has been observed recently (29Dumas S. Le Hir H. Bodeau-Péan S. Hirsch E. Thermes C. Mallet J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We compared the enzymatic characteristics of the hTH3 isoform with those of hTH1, before and following phosphorylation by PKA and CaM-PKII. hTH3 differs from hTH1 by an additional 27 amino acids in the N terminus. The enzymatic analyses were rigorously performed with enzymes purified from recombinant bacteria. The purified enzymes were thus devoid of phosphate moieties and free of co-factor and catecholamines, which affect enzymatic characteristic determinations. To determine the genuine kinetic parameters of the enzymes, experiments were performed under initial velocity conditions. One major finding of this work is that the co-substrate BH4exerts an inhibitory effect on the activity of both hTH3 and hTH1 when in excess (Fig. 4). Earlier studies have shown that TH activity is inhibited by its tyrosine substrate (30Fitzpatrick P.F. Chlumsky L.J. Daubner S.C. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2042-2047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by its catecholamine end products such as dopamine (31Okuno S. Fujisawa H. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Inhibition by BH4 had not previously been detected (32Nasrin S. Ichinose H. Hidaka H. Nagatsu T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), most likely because kinetic studies were not performed under initial velocity conditions. The K i values for BH4 were 24.7 and 53.0 μm for hTH3 and hTH1, respectively. The physiological concentration of BH4 has been estimated to be in the range of 1 to 13 μm in catecholamine tissues of various species (33Nichol C.A. Smith G.K. Duch D.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 729-764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Abou-Donia M.M. Viveros O.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2703-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 35Nagatsu T. Neurochem. Int. 1983; 5: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These data suggest that in vivo the activity of hTH3 and hTH1 is optimal. Given this inhibition effect of BH4, the activity of the enzymes is best represented by the k cat value (see Table II). We show that the activity of hTH3 is over 5 times that of hTH1. This represents the first determination of the true kinetic characteristics of the activity of TH enzyme variants. Another important finding was that the phosphorylation of hTH3 by PKA does not modify its kinetics (Tables I and II). The hTH variants contain four serines, at positions 8, 19, 31, and 40 in their N-terminal regulatory domain. In hTH3 only Ser40 is phosphorylated by PKA, whereas Ser19 and Ser40 are phosphorylated by CaM-PKII. Ser40 in hTH1 has been previously found to be phosphorylated by these two kinases (20Le Bourdellès B. Horellou P. Le Caer J.P. Denèfle P. Latta M. Haavik J. Guibert B. Mayaux J.F. Mallet J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17124-17130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the same site is phosphorylated by PKA and CaM-PKII, the effects of these kinases on hTH3 and hTH1 enzyme activity are quite different. Consistent with previous findings, hTH1 activity was doubled under initial velocity conditions by phosphorylation at Ser40 by PKA (Table II). In sharp contrast, the phosphorylation at Ser40 by PKA had no effect on the enzymatic activity of hTH3 for BH4. The activity of hTH3 is nevertheless twice that of the phosphorylated form of hTH1. Several studies on the regulation of the activity of purified native rat TH (which is the TH most similar to hTH1) suggest that when the enzyme is tightly bound in a dopamine-iron complex, it may be in a state of low basal activity. The major effect of phosphorylation may thus be the activation of TH by favoring dopamine release, which reduces the inhibitory effects of catecholamines (36Haavik J. Martinez A. Flatmark T. FEBS Lett. 1990; 262: 363-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 37Daubner S.C. Lauriano C. Haycock J.W. Fitzpatrick P.F. J. Biol.

A. 1992; 89: 9593-9597Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Recombinant hTH3 bound in a complex with dopamine and Fe(III) may be regulated by phosphorylation by PKA. Although it would be of interest to investigate this issue, the main point of our study is that it demonstrates a major difference between the effects of phosphorylation on hTH3 and hTH1. In the absence of catecholamine, hTH3 but not hTH1 escapes regulation by PKA phosphorylation. The phosphorylation by CaM-PKII had no effect on the activity of hTH3 (Table I). An absence of regulation by CaM-PKII has previously been reported for rat TH. Furthermore, CaM-PKII phosphorylation appears to have no direct effect on the properties of the TH enzyme unless a 14.3.3-activator protein is present to activate the phosphorylated TH (39Yamauchi T. Fujisawa H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 100: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 40Atkinson J. Richtand N. Schworer C. Kuczenski R. Soderling T.R. J. Neurochem. 1987; 49: 1241-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This activator protein, which has been purified and its gene isolated (41Yamauchi T. Nakata H. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5404-5409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Ichimura T. Isobe T. Okuyama T. Takahashi N. Araki K. Kuwano R. Takahashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7084-7088Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), is a very abundant protein found throughout the brain (43Ichimura T. Isobe T. Okuyama T. Yamauchi T. Fujisawa H. FEBS Lett. 1987; 219: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Although the role of the 14.3.3-activator protein is uncertain, it is possible that it does not activate TH directly but rather stabilizes the Ser19-phosphorylated enzyme (21Sutherland C. Alterio J. Campbell D.G. Le Bourdellès B. Mallet J. Haavik J. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 715-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The behavior of hTH3 may be due to a specific conformation associated with the presence of an addition of 27 amino acids in the N terminus of the enzyme. Martinez et al. (44Martinez A. Haavik J. Flatmark T. Arrondo J.L. Muga A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19737-19742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) have shown that the activation of hTH1 by the phosphorylation on Ser40 was associated with a change in the conformation of the enzyme. Moreover, in its activated state, the enzyme appears to be less prone to bind dopamine, explaining why the activity is higher. It could be that the presence in hTH3 of the 27 amino acid fragment with hydrophobic residues could cause the enzyme to adopt a different conformational structure, similar to that generated by the addition of a phosphate group at position Ser40 in hTH1. This induced conformation would then be insensitive to activity regulation. The effect of an insertion on the enzymatic characteristics of TH has also been observed in the Drosophila tyrosine hydroxylase (DTH). Birman et al. (6Birman S. Morgan B. Anzivino M. Hirsh J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26559-26567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that two isoforms of DTH are produced following alternative splicing of a single DTH primary transcript. The DTH type I is an isoform predominantly produced in the central nervous system. The DTH type II, which contains an acidic extension of 71 amino acids at the N terminus not present in the DTH type I, is mostly produced in the hypoderm, where the dopamine synthesized is not a neurotransmitter. The two DTH isoenzymes have different properties possibly due to differences in activity regulation. The authors suggest that the group of negative charges at the N terminus of DTH type II could have the same effects as certain polyanions such as heparin. Thus, an acidic regulatory domain seems to be a characteristic of the regulation of TH activity. It is striking that both in human and Drosophila, the same mechanism of alternative RNA splicing leads to insertion in the N-terminal regulatory domain of TH. The resulting modification of enzymatic properties is likely to be due to specific conformational changes, although hydrophobic segment is added in human TH and an acidic one in Drosophila TH. Further studies are required to elucidate the details of the mechanism of the activity changes in hTH3 and DTH types I and II. Secondary structure analysis as described by Martinez et al. (44Martinez A. Haavik J. Flatmark T. Arrondo J.L. Muga A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19737-19742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) would be valuable. In summary, the two main enzymatic characteristics we report are first that hTH3 is a very active enzyme. The dopa synthesis activity, in absence of end product, is not regulated by phosphorylation by PKA. Second, hTH3 activity is inhibited by excess BH4 (the K i of BH4 is 24 μm). These particular enzymatic properties may be relevant to pathological situations. Although the hTH3 isoform seems not to be abundant in catecholamine cells (45Lewis D.A. Melchitzky D.S. Haycock J.W. Neuroscience. 1993; 54: 477-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), its high enzymatic activity even at low BH4 concentrations may safeguard a minimum level of dopamine synthesis in catecholaminergic neurons and could alleviate some diseases. There are also therapeutic implications arising from this study of hTH3. One way to restore the level of dopamine in the striatum would be to generate ectopic synthesis of l-dopa and dopamine using gene therapy approaches. We have recently shown that dopamine can be produced by direct gene transfer to the brain using a recombinant adenovirus encoding tyrosine hydroxylase (46Horellou P. Vigne E. Castel M.N. Barnéoud P. Colin P. Perricaudet M. Delaère P. Mallet J. Neuroreport. 1994; 6: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The local expression of an hTH1 transgene in the striatum leads to a functional recovery in an animal model of Parkinson's disease. The production of the hTH3 isoform would be more appropriate because it is the most active isoform and would therefore require least virus to be introduced into the brain. We are grateful to Jean Antoine Girault for providing purified calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. We also thank Annie Lamouroux and Bernard Guibert for helpful discussions."

Members of the CRP family of the LIM-only proteins are characterized by two LIM domains that are each followed by a conserved glycine-rich repeat (1Crawford A.W. Pino J.D. Beckerle M.C. J.

In adults, CRP1 is expressed in many tissues and cell types. CRP2/SmLIM is expressed mainly in VSMC, and CRP3/MLP is expressed only in striated muscle cells (12Arber S. Halder G. Caroni P.

Although the biological functions of CRP1 and CRP2/SmLIM have not been elucidated completely, it has been suggested that they play a similar role in maintaining the cytoarchitecture of smooth muscle cells and therefore affect smooth muscle cell differentiation (18Louis H.A.

We have shown that stimulating VSMC in culture with the potent mitogen platelet-derived growth factor-BB markedly down-regulates CRP2/SmLIM mRNA (14Jain M.K. Fujita K.P. Hsieh C.-M. Endege W.O. Sibinga N.E.S. Yet S.-F. Kashiki S. Lee W.-S. Perrella M.A. Haber E. Lee M.-E. J. Biol.

Fujita K.P. Hsieh C.-M. Endege W.O. Sibinga N.E.S. Yet S.-F. Kashiki S. Lee W.-S. Perrella M.A. Haber E. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10194-10199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This down-regulation suggests that CRP2/SmLIM may be involved in VSMC growth and differentiation. As a first step toward elucidating the biological function of CRP2/SmLIM and determining the molecular mechanisms regulating its expression, we cloned and characterized the mouse Crp2/SmLimgene and promoter. Crp2/SmLim is a single copy gene composed of six exons and five introns spanning approximately 20 kilobases (kb). We determined its transcription start site by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE) and S1 nuclease protection assays. By transient transfection assays, we found that the 5-kb Crp2/SmLim5′-flanking sequence confers a high level of transcriptional activity in VSMC in culture. Furthermore, this 5-kb 5′-flanking sequence directs high level expression of the lacZ reporter gene mainly in the VSMC of transgenic mice. The coding region of the mouse CRP2/SmLIM cDNA was amplified from mouse aorta RNA by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as described (20Lee M.-E. Temizer D.H. Clifford J.A. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16188-16192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The forward primer (5′-CCTGTCTGGGGCGGTGGAAA-3′) and the reverse primer (5′-CTACTGAGCATGAACAAGG-3′) were designed according to the rat CRP2/SmLIM cDNA open reading frame sequence (14Jain M.K. Fujita K.P. Hsieh C.-M. Endege W.O. Sibinga N.E.S. Yet S.-F. Kashiki S. Lee W.-S. Perrella M.A. Haber E. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10194-10199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The PCR products were subcloned into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). To isolate the 5′ end of the mouse CRP2/SmLIM cDNA, we performed 5′-RACE (Life Technologies, Inc.) with mouse aorta RNA. The sequence of the 3′-untranslated region was obtained by 3′-RACE (Life Technologies) with mouse aorta RNA. Nucleotide sequences were determined by the dideoxy chain termination method with Sequenase version 2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and on an automated DNA Sequencer (Licor, Lincoln, NE) according to the manufacturer's instructions. dITP and deaza-dGTP sequencing protocols were used to resolve compression artifacts in the highly GC-rich regions. Sequence analysis was performed with the GCG software package (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). High molecular weight genomic DNA was prepared from mouse tail biopsies (21Laird P.W. Zijderveld A. Linders K. Rudnicki M.A. Jaenisch R. Berns A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA (10 μg) was digested with restriction enzymes, fractionated on 0.8% agarose gels, and transferred to nylon membranes. The membranes were then hybridized with a 32P-labeled, random-primed (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) CRP2/SmLIM open reading frame probe (nucleotides 80–662) or a 3′-untranslated region probe (nucleotides 646–868). The membranes were washed in 0.1× SSC (15 mm sodium chloride, 1.5 mm sodium citrate) and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C and exposed to Kodak XAR film at −80 °C. The full-length CRP2/SmLIM cDNA was labeled by random priming (Stratagene) and used as a probe to screen a mouse 129SvJ λDASH II genomic library (Stratagene). About 1.5 million phage were plated, transferred to nitrocellulose, and screened according to standard techniques (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Hybridizing clones were then purified, and DNA was prepared according to standard procedures. Restriction fragments derived from phage clones containing the Crp2/SmLim gene were ligated into the vector pBS SKII (Stratagene) and sequenced. None of the clones from the first library screening contained CRP2/SmLIM exon 1 or the promoter region. We used a PCR strategy to obtain a probe near exon 1 for the second library screening. A forward primer from exon 1 and a reverse primer from the known sequence of the 3′ end of intron 1 were used to amplify an 11-kb fragment from mouse genomic DNA with the Expand Long Template PCR kit (Boehringer Mannheim). The 5′-most SacI fragment (550 base pairs (bp)) was labeled with 32P by random priming and used to screen a mouse 129SvJ genomic library in λFIX II (Stratagene). About 1.5 million phage were plated, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and screened at high stringency. Four clones were isolated that contained the Crp2/SmLim promoter sequence. The Crp2/SmLimtranscription start site was determined by S1 nuclease protection assay. An end-labeled antisense oligonucleotide corresponding to bp +79 to +50 was annealed to the alkaline-denatured plasmid −438/+79, which contains 438 bp of the Crp2/SmLim promoter plus exon 1. The primer was extended with the Klenow fragment and then digested with NdeI to generate a 410-bp fragment (−332 to +79). The purified, labeled probe (5 × 104 cpm) was then hybridized to 30 μg of each RNA sample in 20 μl of hybridization buffer containing 80% formamide, 40 mm Pipes, 0.4m NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA at 30 °C for 16 h. The DNA-RNA hybrid was mixed with 300 μl of nuclease S1 mapping buffer (0.28 m NaCl, 0.05 m sodium acetate (pH 4.5), 4.5 mm ZnSO4, and 20 μg/ml herring sperm DNA) and 100 units of S1 nuclease (Promega, Madison, WI). The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 60 min. The reaction was terminated with 80 μl of stop buffer containing 4 mammonium acetate, 20 mm EDTA, and 40 μg/ml tRNA. Final reaction products were analyzed on an 8% sequencing gel. Rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMC) were harvested from male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 g) by enzymatic dissociation according to the method of Günther et al.(23Günther S. Alexander R.W. Atkinson W.J. Gimbrone M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). RASMC were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) (JRH Biosciences). Cells were passaged every 3–5 days, and experiments were performed on cells 5–7 passages from primary culture. HeLa human epitheloid carcinoma cells, 3T3 mouse fibroblast cells, and HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Reporter constructs containing fragments of the Crp2/SmLim 5′-flanking region were inserted into pGL2-Basic and named according to the length of the fragment relative to the transcription start site. A DNA fragment containing Crp2/SmLim bp −4855 to +79 was amplified from phage DNA by PCR with the Expand Long Template PCR kit (Boehringer Mannheim). The fragment was then ligated into the pGL2-Basic vector to generate the −4855SmLIM luciferase reporter construct. PCR was used to generate fragments with increasingly shorter segments of Crp2/SmLimpromoter sequence. These constructs shared a common 3′ end at bp −10 but differed at the 5′ end (at bp −438, −91, and −74). Luciferase plasmid −144SmLIM was generated by religation after SacI digestion of plasmid −438SmLIM. Luciferase plasmid −39SmLIM was generated by cloning annealed, double-stranded complementary oligonucleotides into pGL2-Basic. The 5′-flanking region of the mouse Crp2/SmLim gene spanning bp −4855 to +79 was also subcloned into the promoterless vector pPD46.21 (24Fire A. Genet. Anal. Tech. Appl. 1992; 9: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) to generate the transgenic construct −4855SmLIM-lacZ. RASMC were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method (25Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Tan L. Yet S.-F. Hsieh C.-M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13776-13780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Approximately 5 × 105 cells were plated onto 100-mm tissue culture dishes and allowed to grow for 48–72 h (until 80–90% confluent). To correct for differences in transfection efficiency, the luciferase plasmids and pOPRSVICAT (Stratagene) (5 μg each) were added to RASMC in a solution containing 500 μg/ml DEAE-dextran. Cell extracts were prepared with 1× reporter lysis buffer according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega) 48 h after transfection. Luciferase activity was measured with an EG&G AutoLumat LB953 luminometer (Gaithersburg, MD) and the Promega luciferase assay system. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity was assayed by a modified two-phase fluor diffusion method (26Lee M.-E. Bloch K.D. Clifford J.A. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10446-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ratio of luciferase activity to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity in each sample served as a measure of normalized luciferase activity. Probes were made from double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to bp −74 to −39 of Crp2/SmLim which contains two Sp1 sites. The probes were radiolabeled as described (27Lee M.-E. Dhadly M.S.

A typical binding reaction mixture contained DNA probe at 50,000 cpm, 1 μg of poly(dI·dC), 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 40 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 5 μg of RASMC nuclear extract (25Perrella M.A. Patterson C.

The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min and analyzed by 5% native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 0.25× TBE (22 mm Tris, 22 mm boric acid, 0.5 mm EDTA). To determine the specificity of the DNA protein complexes, we performed competition assays with unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides encoding the Crp2/SmLim promoter sequence, ATF sequence, and an Sp1 consensus sequence (5′-TCCGCCCCGCCCCGCCCCGCATG-3′). To characterize the specific DNA-binding protein, we incubated nuclear extracts with antibodies to Sp1 and AP2 (Santa Cruz) for 3 h at 4 °C before adding the probe. The −4855SmLIM-lacZ transgenic construct was digested with PstI and NotI to generate an 8-kb fragment containing the 5-kb promoter, lacZ reporter gene, and SV40 polyadenylation sequence. The purified 8-kb fragment was injected into the pronuclei of fertilized FVB mouse eggs (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Core Transgenic Mouse Facility). Transgenic mice harboring the Crp2/SmLim promoter-lacZ gene were identified by PCR and Southern blot analysis with genomic DNA prepared from tail biopsies of potential founders. Two independent founder lines were identified. Transgenic embryos were fixed and stained for β-galactosidase activity. To make the vasculature more visible before photography, we clarified the stained, whole embryos by soaking them serially in glycerol at concentrations ranging from 30 to 80%. Stained embryos were also embedded in paraffin, sectioned on a microtome at a thickness of 5 μm, and counterstained with nuclear fast red according to standard procedures (29Hogan B. Beddington R. Constantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). By using mouse aorta RNA as template, we isolated the mouse CRP2/SmLIM cDNA by reverse transcription PCR in conjunction with 5′- and 3′-RACE. The mouse CRP2/SmLIM cDNA encodes a 193-amino acid protein that contains two LIM domains separated by a glycine-rich region (Fig. 1 A). A comparison of the coding sequences of the mouse and rat CRP2/SmLIM open reading frames (14Jain M.K. Fujita K.P. Hsieh C.-M. Endege W.O. Sibinga N.E.S. Yet S.-F. Kashiki S. Lee W.-S. Perrella M.A. Haber E. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10194-10199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) revealed that they are 97% identical at the nucleotide level and 100% identical at the amino acid level (data not shown). Hybridization of mouse genomic DNA digested with SacI, BamHI,HindIII, EcoRI, or PstI to a probe encoding the CRP2/SmLIM open reading frame revealed a simple pattern of bands (data not shown). To exclude the possibility that CRP2/SmLIM cross-hybridized to other CRP protein family genes, we also hybridized a parallel blot with a probe containing a part of the CRP2/SmLIM 3′-untranslated region that has little homology to other CRP cDNA sequences. The 3′-untranslated region probe hybridized to only one band (data not shown). These data indicate that in the mouse genome Crp2/SmLim is encoded by a single copy gene. By using the full-length CRP2/SmLIM cDNA as a probe to screen a library prepared from mouse genomic DNA (129SvJ), we isolated several overlapping clones encoding Crp2/SmLim genomic sequence. The mouse Crp2/SmLim gene is organized into six exons and five introns spanning approximately 20 kb of genomic DNA (Fig. 1 B). All exon/intron boundaries were determined by DNA sequencing, and intron sizes were determined by PCR with oligonucleotides derived from flanking exons (Fig. 1 A). All assigned exon/intron boundaries agree with consensus 5′-GT and 3′-AG splicing sequences (30Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3292) Google Scholar). The average length of the Crp2/SmLim exons, 145 bp, is consistent with the length of exons in general, 137 bp (31Hawkins J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9893-9908Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Exon 1 contains the 5′-untranslated region. Exon 2 contains the entire 5′ finger and the first cysteine of the 3′ finger of the first LIM domain. Exon 3 contains the rest of the 3′ finger. Exon 4 encodes the first two cysteines of the 5′ finger of the second LIM domain, and exon 5 contains the rest of the 5′ finger and most of the 3′ finger except the last cysteine. Exon 6 contains the remainder of the coding region and the 3′-untranslated region. At the 3′ end of the Crp2/SmLimgene, exon 6 contains a consensus polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) motif. Poly(A) addition occurs 11 bp downstream of this motif. The transcription start site identified by 5′-RACE was confirmed further by using an end-labeled CRP2/SmLIM DNA fragment (nucleotides −332 to +79) in an S1 nuclease protection assay (Fig. 2 A). Protected fragments were observed when the probe was incubated with total RNA prepared from mouse aortic smooth muscle cells in primary culture but not when it was incubated with tRNA or total RNA from mouse skeletal muscle cells (Fig. 2 B). The transcription start site was determined to be an A residue 80 bp 5′ of the translation initiation codon, consistent with the results obtained by 5′-RACE. The 5′-CA-3′ nucleotide pair at this position is the most common type of eukaryotic transcription start site (32Bucher P. Trifonov E.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 10009-10026Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The proximal 5′-flanking region of Crp2/SmLim is characterized by regions rich in G and C (Fig. 3). The Crp2/SmLimtranscription start site contains a pyrimidine-rich sequence that resembles the initiator motif (YAYTCYYY) (33Roy A.L. Meisterernst M. Pognonec P. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1991; 354: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). This initiator element, which is often associated with TATA-less promoters, is sufficient to initiate transcription (34Smale S.T. Schmidt M.C. Berk A.J. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4509-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). However, we also located a TATA-like sequence (TTTAAA) 27 bp 5′ of the transcription start site. A comparison of the 5′-flanking sequence with sequences in the Transcription Factors Data Base revealed numerous Sp1 sites and six consensus AP-2 sites at −4587, −3921, −3360, −126, +12, and +48. There are many E box/basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor binding sites, and three consensus GATA sites, at bp −3133, −2890, and −1485. Although there is no consensus myocyte-specific enhancer factor (MEF2) motif, there are two AT-rich, MEF2-like binding sites (YTAWAAATAR) (35Gossett L.A. Kelvin D.J. Sternberg E.A. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5022-5033Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) at bp −2129 and −1507, each with a one-base mismatch to the consensus sequence. Also, although the CArG box motif is crucial to mediation of VSMC-specific expression, there is no consensus CArG box in Crp2/SmLim. There is one consensus GArC motif (GAAAAATCT) (36Mably J.D. Sole M.J. Liew C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 476-482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), at bp −3103. Finally, the cytosine-rich motif at bp −1628 is identical to the CCAC box (CCCACCCC) conserved among human myoglobin genes (37Bassel-Duby R. Grohe C.M. Jessen M.E. Parsons W.J. Richardson J.A.

The transcription start site is marked by a bent arrow, and the intron 1 sequence is in lowercase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the sequence flanking the 5′ end of the Crp2/SmLim gene had promoter activity, we transfected into RASMC the luciferase plasmid −4855SmLIM, which contains bp −4855 to +79 of the mouse Crp2/SmLim gene linked to the luciferase reporter. pGL2-Control, driven by the potent SV40 promoter and enhancer, was also transfected into RASMC. Luciferase activity generated by −4855SmLIM was 60% that generated by pGL2-Control (Fig. 4). These data indicate that the 5′-flanking region of Crp2/SmLim contains potent promoter/enhancer activity. To localize the cis-acting elements further, we generated reporter plasmids containing various lengths of Crp2/SmLim 5′-flanking region and transfected these plasmids into RASMC (Fig. 4). As little as 74 bp of SmLIM promoter directed a high level of promoter activity; however, deletion of another 35 bp of promoter sequence (Fig. 4, −39SmLIM) decreased luciferase activity markedly. These data indicate that bp −74 to −39 of the Crp2/SmLim gene contain most of the promoter activity. By using the DNA fragment encoding bp −74 to −39 (which contains two Sp1 sites) as a probe in gel mobility shift analysis, we detected a specific DNA-protein complex when the probe was incubated with nuclear extracts prepared from RASMC (Fig. 5). The DNA-protein complex was specific because a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled identical competitor, but not an unrelat"

The products represent a faithful copy of the T strand, with no insertions or deletions. On double-stranded templates having protruding 3′ ends the polymerase is able to insert the free 3′ end of the NT strand and to utilize this as a new T strand (“turn around transcription”), resulting in the anomalous production of high molecular weight transcripts.The capacity of T7 RNAP to bypass interruptions in the T strand depends upon the stability of the elongation complex. Sequences that are expected to stabilize a local RNA:DNA hybrid (such as the presence of a C6 tract in the T strand) dramatically reduce dissociation of the RNAP while still allowing the enzyme to insert a new 3′ end. Similar effects on RNAP release are observed when the enzyme reaches the end of a template (i.e. when synthesizing runoff products), resulting in markedly different yields of RNA product during multiple rounds of transcription.

Once the enzyme has initiated transcription and cleared the promoter, the ternary elongation complex is highly processive and is able to synthesize long RNA chains (>15,000 nt) until it encounters a termination signal or reaches the end of the template. The transition from an unstable initiation complex to a stable elongation complex (EC) is accompanied by isomerization of the complex (6Ikeda R.A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The non-template (NT) strand of the DNA does not appear to be required for initiation or for the early stages of transcription, as Maslak and Martin (15Maslak M. Martin C.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4281-4285Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) have shown that T7 RNAP can initiate transcription at a promoter that is single-stranded in the initiation region (from −6 and downstream), and Milligan et al. (7Milligan J.F. Groebe D.R. Witherell G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8783-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1869) Google Scholar) have shown that the enzyme can transcribe a single-stranded DNA template once it has initiated transcription from a double-stranded promoter. However, Zhou et al. (16Zhou W. Doetsch P.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14926-14934Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 17Zhou W. Reines D. Doetsch P.W. Cell. 1995; 82: 577-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) have suggested that the stability of the EC may require the presence of duplex DNA at the leading edge of the elongation complex, as an elongation complex that is halted just upstream from a region in which the NT strand is missing appears to be unable to resume transcription. A number of studies to determine the importance of the integrity of the template (T) strand to processive transcription have been carried out. Although there are conflicting reports in the literature with regard to the ability of T7 RNAP to bypass nicks in the T strand (18Zhou W. Doetsch P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6601-6605Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 19Chen Y.H. Bogenhagen D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5849-5855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Zhou et al. (16Zhou W.

Cell. 1995; 82: 577-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) observed that T7 RNAP is able to bypass gaps of 1–24 nt, resulting in a faithful copy of the T strand in the regions preceding and following the gap. Although this result demonstrated that the enzyme is able to thread the 3′ end of a paired T strand into the active site, the RNAP was unable to switch to a free oligomer of single-stranded DNA, leading these authors to conclude that the DNA template must be double-stranded at the leading edge of the EC in order for template switching to occur (17Zhou W. Reines D. Doetsch P.W. Cell. 1995; 82: 577-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, an alternate explanation for this observation is that if the downstream oligomer is not tethered in the vicinity of the EC (because it is not complementary to the NT strand) its local concentration is low, and switching to the new T strand is inefficient. In this work, we have explored the ability of T7 RNAP to traverse nicks and gaps in the template strand and also to jump across branched junctions in which the leading or trailing edges of the T strand are not complementary to the NT strand. We found that the RNAP is able to traverse all of these discontinuities. Our results do not support a requirement that the DNA must be double-stranded at either the leading or trailing edge of the elongation complex in order for strand switching to occur but suggest an important role for the NT strand in tethering the T strand in the vicinity of the EC. DNA oligomers were synthesized by Macromolecular Resources (Colorado State University) and purified by low pressure reverse phase chromatography. To prepare synthetic templates, the indicated combinations of oligomers were mixed together (final concentration 0.5 μm, each oligomer) in 40 μl of GHT buffer (30 mm K-HEPES, pH 7.8, 100 mm potassium glutamate, 15 mmMg(OAc)2, 0.25 mm EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20 (20Maslak M. Martin C.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6918-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar)), and the samples were heated to 70 °C for 10 min and cooled slowly to room temperature (2–3 h). The templates were either used immediately or stored at −20 °C. T7 RNAP having a His6 amino-terminal leader (encoded by pBH161) was purified as described previously (21He B. Rong M. Lyakhov D.L. Gartenstein H. Diaz G.A. Castagna R.C. McAllister W.T. Durbin R.K. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 9: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). All plasmids were constructed by standard procedures (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted, transcription was carried out in a volume of 10 μl in GHT buffer (see above) containing 0.5 mm ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Ultrapure); 2 μCi of [α-32P]ATP or GTP (specific activity of 800 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products); 10–20 nm RNA polymerase, and 50 nm synthetic DNA or 1 μg of plasmid DNA as template. Reactions in which ITP replaced GTP contained 0.5 mm ITP and 2 mm GMP to allow efficient initiation (23Milligan J.F. Uhlenbeck O.C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and terminated by the addition of 10 μl of stop buffer, and the products were resolved by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea (21He B. Rong M. Lyakhov D.L. Gartenstein H. Diaz G.A. Castagna R.C. McAllister W.T. Durbin R.K. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 9: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The radioactivity in each electrophoretic species was quantified by exposing the gel to a PhosphorImagerTM screen (Molecular Dynamics) using a Storm 860 scanner and ImageQuaNT version 4.2a software (Molecular Dynamics). The efficiency of gap or branch jumping was calculated as follows: efficiency = (long runoff product)/(short runoff product + long runoff product) taking into account the base composition of individual transcripts. Transcription reactions were carried out as described above except that the volume was increased to 100 μl, and 10 units of RNase inhibitor (Boehringer Mannheim) were added. After 1 h at 37 °C, samples were treated with 1 unit of DNase (RNase-free, Promega) for 20 min and extracted with phenol and chloroform. RNA was precipitated at −70 °C in the presence of 70% isopropyl alcohol and 0.3 m sodium acetate and resolved by electrophoresis in a 20% polyacrylamide gel as described above. Gel slices containing the RNA were excised, crushed in 500 μl of elution buffer (10% sodium acetate in TE (0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 0.1 mm EDTA)), and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The sample was extracted with phenol and chloroform, and the RNA was precipitated with isopropyl alcohol and taken up in 10 μl of TE. A cDNA copy of the RNA was synthesized using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and a MarathonTM cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH); the primer for first strand synthesis was 5′-CAGGATCCCTCTAGAACTAGTGG-3′, which contains a BamHI site (underlined). The cDNA was amplified in a polymerase chain reaction using a PrimeZymeTM kit (Biometra), the primer noted above, and a second primer (5′-CAGAATTCGGGAGACCACAACCTC-3′) that contains an EcoRI site (underlined). The resulting products were digested with EcoRI and BamHI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pBluescript II SK(+) (Stratagene); the DNA sequence of the cloned interval was determined using chain terminating dNTPs (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To examine the effects of discontinuities in the DNA template on processivity, we constructed double-stranded templates having no discontinuities, nicks, gaps of 1–2 nt, or branches in the T strand by annealing synthetic T and NT strand DNA oligomers (Fig. 1 A, see Table I for sequences). These templates were then transcribed by T7 RNAP, and the products were resolved by electrophoresis in 20% polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 1, B and C).Table ISequences of DNA oligomersNumberID1-aLaboratory reference number.Sequence1-bSequences that are not complementary to MR37 are indicated in bold; homopolymeric tracts >6 nt are underlined.1MR35′ TCGAAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCACAACCTCTCGTTCTG 3′2MR25′ CAGAACGAGAGGTTGTGGTCTCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAATTTCGA 3′3MR375′ TCGAAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCACAACCTCTCGTTCTGGGGGGATCCACTAGTTCTAGAG 3′4MR385′ CTCTAGAACTAGTGGATCCCCCCAGAACGAGAGGTTGTGGTCTCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAATTTCGA 3′5MR395′ AGAACGAGAGGTTGTGGTCTCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAATTTCGA 3′6MR405′ CTCTAGAACTAGTGGATCCCC 3′7MR415′ CTCTAGAACTAGTGGATCCCCC 3′8MR435′ CTCTAGAACTAGTGGATCCCCCATGA 3′9MR425′ CTCTAGAACTAGTGGATCCCCCTCAAATGA 3′10MR445′ CTCTAGAACTAGTGGATCCCCCATGATCAAATGA 3′11MR455′ CTCTAGAACTAGTGGATCCCCCGAAATCAAATGA 3′12MR465′ CTCTAGAACTAGTGGATCCCCCGAAATCAATGAATGAA 3′13MR495′CCCCCCAGAACGAGAGGTTGTGGTCTCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAATTTCGA 3′14MR505′ CTCTAGAACTAGTGGAT 3′15MR515′ CTCTAGAACTAGTGGATATGA 3′16MR895′ TCGAAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCACAACCTCTCGTTCTGGGGGG 3′17MR985′ TCGAAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCACAACCTCTCGTTCTGACTAC 3′18MR995′ GTAGTCAGAAACGAGAGGTTGTGGTCTCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAATTTCGA 3′19MR1005′ TCGAAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCACAACCTCTCGTTCTAAAAAA 3′20MR1015′TTTTTTAGAACGAGAGGTTGTGGTCTCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAATTTCGA 3′21MR1025′ TCGAAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCACAACCTCTCGTTCTTTTTTT 3′22MR1035′AAAAAAAGAACGAGAGGTTGTGGTCTCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAATTTCGA 3′23MR1075′ AGGTTGTGGTCTCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAATTTCGAGCTGACAT 3′24MR1105′ AGGTTGTGGTCTCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAATTTCGA25MR1115′ ATGTCAGCTCGAAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCACAACCTCTCGTTCTG 3′26MR1125′ TCGAAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCACAACCT 3′27MR1055′AAAAAAAAAAGAACGAGAGGTTGTGGTCTCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAATTTCGA 3′1-a Laboratory reference number.1-b Sequences that are not complementary to MR37 are indicated in bold; homopolymeric tracts >6 nt are underlined. Open table in a new tab In agreement with previous reports (16Zhou W. Doetsch P.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14926-14934Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 17Zhou W. Reines D. Doetsch P.W. Cell. 1995; 82: 577-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) we found that T7 RNAP is able to traverse a gap of 1–2 nt in the template strand (Fig. 1 B, lanes 5, 6, and 8), resulting in the synthesis of RNA products that correspond to a full-length transcript (47 nt) minus the interval defined by the gap (1 nt in lanes 5 and 8 and 2 nt in lane 6). The polymerase also terminates transcription at the proximal side of the gap, releasing a product of 23 or 24 nt. The frequent addition of a non-templated nucleotide to the 3′ end of the transcripts by T7 RNAP (7Milligan J.F. Groebe D.R. Witherell G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8783-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1869) Google Scholar) results in a double band for each of these runoff products (see also Refs. 16Zhou W. Doetsch P.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14926-14934Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar and 17Zhou W. Reines D. Doetsch P.W. Cell. 1995; 82: 577-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). There are conflicting reports in the literature with regard to the ability of phage RNAPs to traverse a “nick” in the template strand (here defined as a break in the phosphodiester backbone but with no missing bases). Chen and Bogenhagen (19Chen Y.H. Bogenhagen D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5849-5855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) examined the effects of abasic (AP) sites and single strand breaks (nicks) near AP sites in the T and NT strands and concluded that SP6 RNAP is able to transcribe through AP sites in the T strand (where the enzyme inserts predominantly adenine residues), with little termination at the nick. In contrast, Zhou and Doetsch (18Zhou W. Doetsch P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6601-6605Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) reported that single strand breaks completely prevented passage of T7 RNAP through AP sites. By using synthetic oligomers to generate a discontinuity in the T strand, we found that T7 RNAP is able to traverse a nick with an efficiency of jumping that is comparable to the efficiency of gap jumping (Fig. 1 B, compare lane 7 with lanes 5, 6, and 8). The ability of the polymerase to jump across a branch in the template (in which the 3′ end of the T strand at the distal edge of the discontinuity is not complementary to the NT strand) was examined as shown in Fig. 1 C. In this experiment, T strand oligomers having unpaired 3′ tails 4–16 nt long were positioned either immediately after the 5′ end of the upstream T strand oligomer (lanes 9, 11, 13, 15, and 17) or after a gap of 1 nt (lanes 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18). The polymerase is able to transcribe through all of these junctions, resulting in the synthesis of transcripts that are larger than the product from a fully double-stranded template (lane 1, 47 nt) by an increment that corresponds to the length of the branch minus the size of the gap (if present). The efficiency of branch jumping drops with increasing length of the branch, but a plot of the data (Fig. 1 D) suggests that a basal level of branch jumping may remain even with longer branches. Further experiments with templates having longer branches will be required to confirm this. The products arising from transcription across the branch junctions were discrete and homogeneous and of a size expected for an exact copy of the branched T strand. The accuracy of transcription across such a junction was confirmed by sequencing a cDNA copy of the “jump” transcript produced from template 11, which has a branch of 8 nt. The results demonstrate that the transcript represents an accurate copy of the T strand on either side of the discontinuity and that T7 RNAP does not insert or delete nucleotides when it traverses such a junction (Fig. 2). T7 RNA polymerase is known to synthesize anomalous, high molecular weight products from templates that have protruding 3′ ends (24Schenborn E.T. Mierendorf Jr., R.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 6223-6236Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This phenomenon depends upon the structure at the termini, but not the sequence (24Schenborn E.T. Mierendorf Jr., R.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 6223-6236Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 25Lyakhov D.L. Ilgenfrits H. Chernov B.K. Dragan S.M. Rechinsky V.O. Pokholok D.K.

Biol. 1997; 269: 28-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and is not due to initiation at the ends of the DNA, as it requires the presence of a promoter in the template (24Schenborn E.T. Mierendorf Jr., R.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 6223-6236Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 26Lyakhov D.L. He B. Zhang X. Studier F.W. Dunn J.J. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 28-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In view of the finding that the RNAP is able to insert a free 3′ end when it reaches the end of a T strand, we asked whether the synthesis of these unusual products might arise from the same phenomenon (Fig. 3). Although transcription of templates that have a blunt end results in the synthesis of the expected runoff products (lanes 1 and 2), transcription of templates that have a protruding 3′ end gives rise to additional RNAs that would result from insertion of the 3′ end of the NT strand and subsequent transcription of that strand (lanes 3–5). If the terminus of the template upstream from the promoter has a blunt or recessed 3′ end, the process ceases there (lanes 4 and 5, 71 nt). However, if the upstream terminus has a protruding 3′ end (lane 3) the polymerase can again insert the free end, re-transcribing the template strand. Repeated cycles of transcription around the DNA by this mechanism (“turn around transcription”) result in the synthesis of a ladder of products and the accumulation of high molecular weight RNAs that do not enter the gel. As noted elsewhere, the production of these spurious products can be avoided through the use of T7 RNAP mutants such as del172-3 (25Lyakhov D.L. Ilgenfrits H. Chernov B.K. Dragan S.M. Rechinsky V.O. Pokholok D.K. Tunitskaya V.L. Kochetkov S.N. Mol. Biol. (Mosc.). 1992; 26: 679-687Google Scholar, 26Lyakhov D.L. He B. Zhang X. Studier F.W. Dunn J.J. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 28-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the experiment described in Fig. 1, a C6 tract was included in the T strand to enhance the formation of a stable DNA duplex in the vicinity of the discontinuity when paired with a complementary G6 tract in the NT strand. To determine how the presence of this G:C “clamp” affects transcription, we positioned the G:C tract either before or after the discontinuity (Fig. 4). In a completely duplex DNA template (one having no discontinuities in the T strand) only full-length runoff products (47 nt) were synthesized, with no evidence of pausing near or within the G:C tract (Fig. 4 B, lane 1). When the G:C tract was placed downstream from the discontinuity (as in Fig. 1) the characteristic production of short RNAs (24 nt) that terminate at the proximal side of the discontinuity was observed, along with production of the jump products (47 or 51 nt; Fig. 4 B, lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, when the G:C clamp was placed prior to the discontinuity, production of the short RNA was not detected, whereas synthesis of full-length runoff (jump) products continued to be observed (Fig. 4 B, lanes 4and 5). Under the latter conditions, the apparent efficiency of branch and gap jumping approaches 100%, as the jump transcripts are practically the only products observed. The results above suggest that the presence of a G:C clamp at the end of a template stabilizes the ternary complex, preventing dissociation of the RNAP while still allowing branch or gap jumping to occur. To examine this, we incubated RNAP with templates that either had a terminal G:C clamp or did not and then determined the availability of free enzyme by the subsequent addition of a second DNA template (Fig. 4 C). We found that the presence of a G:C clamp at the terminus of the primary template inhibited the production of runoff transcripts from this template (24 nt) and greatly diminished the synthesis of products from the second template (83 nt; lane 7). This phenomenon was not observed with templates that lacked a terminal G:C clamp (lanes 1 and 6). The low level of RNA synthesis observed in the presence of the template having a G:C clamp is not due to a failure of this template to initiate RNA synthesis or to a general inhibition of the RNAP, as this template directs the synthesis of equivalent amounts of poly(G) products when GTP is present as the sole substrate (Fig. 4 D). Under these conditions, repeated cycles of initiation and slippage of the nascent RNA result in the characteristic formation of a ladder of products 2–14 nt in length (5Martin C.T. Muller D.K. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3966-3974Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This result demonstrates that the template is fully competent to carry out the early stages of transcription and that the deficit in RNA synthesis occurs only later in transcription, when the RNAP has reached the end of the template. A possible explanation for this effect is that the formation of a stable RNA:DNA hybrid at the end of the template stabilizes the transcription complex and prevents enzyme turnover. To examine this, we determined the effect of substituting ITP for GTP in the transcription reaction (as I:C base pairs are less stable than G:C base pairs). As shown in Fig. 5, substitution of ITP for GTP resulted in increased release of short products (30 nt) from a template having a G:C clamp positioned before a branch junction while still allowing branch jumping to occur (lanes 4 and 5). In view of the observations above, we explored the effects of other variations in structure and sequence at the ends of a DNA template on the yield of RNA products (Fig. 6). In these experiments, the activity of templates that ended in various homopolymeric tracts was compared with that of a control template that ended with the sequence 5′-GACTAC-3′ (in the NT strand), either when the T strand was complementary to the NT strand or was unpaired. As before, the presence of a C6 tract in the T strand dramatically reduced the yield of transcripts, whether paired with a G6 tract in the NT strand (lane 2) or not (lane 5). In contrast, the presence of a T6tract in the T strand stimulated product yield (lanes 3 and 6), consistent with the lower stability of A:T base pairs as compared with G:C base pairs. The presence of an A6 tract in the T strand resulted in premature release of products and a lower overall yield as compared with results obtained with a T6 tract (compare lanes 4 and 7 with lanes 3 and 6). Although the release of the transcripts prior to reaching the end of the template is consistent with the remarkably low stability of rU:dA base pairs (27Martin F.H. Tinoco I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 2295-2299Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), the decreased yield of product is more difficult to explain. It has been observed that during the early stages of initiation T7 RNAP aborts transcription more frequently before or after incorporating a UMP residue, and it has been suggested that the weak interactions of the rU:dA base pair may hinder the correct orientation of the base in the active site, resulting in slower catalysis (5Martin C.T. Muller D.K. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3966-3974Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 8Ling M.L. Risman S.S. Klement J.F. McGraw N.J. McAllister W.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 1605-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, even though dissociation of the transcription complex would be enhanced when transcribing through a poly(dA) tract, the increased time required for the polymerase to reach the point of release would result in a slower turnover rate and hence a lower yield. We have shown that T7 RNAP is able to bypass a variety of interruptions in the template strand and that the sequence at the end of the strand affects the stability of the complex and its ability to traverse the discontinuity. Our observation that the enzyme can cross gaps of 1–2 nt in the T strand is in agreement with a previous report demonstrating jumping of gaps up to 24 nt in length (17Zhou W. Reines D. Doetsch P.W. Cell. 1995; 82: 577-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, in that report, the authors concluded that template switching by T7 RNAP occurred only if the 3′ end of the T strand was complementary to the NT strand (i.e. was present in the form of a DNA duplex). In this work, we have shown that T7 RNAP may also insert the 3′ end of an unpaired T strand when it is located in a branch junction. Under these circumstances, the 3′ end of the T strand is present at a high local concentration (as it is tethered to the EC via its complementarity to the downstream region of the NT strand), and this may account for failure on the part of previous investigators to detect jumping of T7 RNAP to a second molecule added in trans. We have also found that T7 RNAP is able to traverse branch junctions in which the T strand is unpaired before the discontinuity (i.e. has a 5′ tail) or in which there are unpaired regions on both sides of the discontinuity (having both 3′ and 5′ tails), although with reduced efficiency in the latter case (30Rong, M., Studies of the Promoter Specificity Determinants of T7 RNA Polymerease and the Ability of the Enzyme to Utilize Nicked and Branched Templates.Ph.D. thesis, 1997, State University, of New York, Brooklyn.Google Scholar). In contrast to these results, Nudler et al. (28Nudler E. Avetissova E. Markovtsov V. Goldfarb A. Science. 1996; 273: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) have reported that Escherichia coli RNAP may also switch to a new template strand requirement for double-stranded DNA for template switching by T7 RNAP suggests that there may be important structural and functional differences between the bacterial and phage enzymes. There are conflicting observations regarding the importance of the NT strand to the processivity and stability of the T7 RNAP elongation complex. Some experimental results suggest that the polymerase sequesters primarily the T strand and that a continuous encirclement of both strands may not be required for processivity. For example, polymerases that approach one another from opposite directions over the same transcription region are able to pass one another with no apparent pausing or termination, and we have observed processive transcription on single-stranded templates over distances as great as 800 nt (29Macdonald L.E. Durbin R.K. Dunn J.J. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). 2B. He, A. Kukarin, D. Temiakov, S. T. Chin-Bow, D. L. Lyakhov, M. Rong, R. K. Durbin, and W. T. McAllister, submitted for publication. Furthermore, cross-linking of psoralen mono-adducts or of psoralen-derivatized oligonucleotides inhibits transcription by T7 RNAP when the cross-link is to the T strand but not to the NT strand (31Shi Y.B.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10681-10697Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and we have observed similar results in the case of a protein cross-linked to the T or NT strands. 3R. K. Durbin and W. T. McAllister, unpublished observations. Although these results indicate that the presence of the NT strand is not required for the stability (and hence processivity) of an actively transcribing complex, Zhou et al. (17Zhou W. Reines D. Doetsch P.W. Cell. 1995; 82: 577-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) reported that an elongation complex that is halted just upstream from a region in which the NT strand is missing is unable to resume transcription when the remaining substrates are added and suggested that the NT strand may be required for the stability of such a complex. In work to be reported elsewhere, we have found differences in the stabilities and properties of halted complexes versus actively transcribing complexes, and we have shown that the presence of the NT strand is more important to the stability of the former complexes than to the latter. 4V. Gopal, W. T. McAllister, and R. Sousa, submitted for publication., 5P. E. Karasavas, S. T. Chin-Bow, R. Sousa, and W. T. McAllister, submitted for publication. The effects of various configurations and sequences at the ends of the DNA template on product yield and enzyme release indicate that the stability of an RNA:DNA hybrid is important in maintaining the association of the ternary complex and that under certain circumstances product release and complex dissociation may be rate-limiting. Thus, for example, we have found that a terminal C6 tract in the T strand inhibits dissociation and that this effect may be relieved by substituting ITP for GTP in the reaction. We have observed similar effects on templates that end in a variety of G:C-rich sequence contexts, indicating that it is the stability of the RNA:DNA hybrid, and not its sequence, that causes this effect (30Rong, M., Studies of the Promoter Specificity Determinants of T7 RNA Polymerease and the Ability of the Enzyme to Utilize Nicked and Branched Templates.Ph.D. thesis, 1997, State University, of New York, Brooklyn.Google Scholar). Due to the particularly low stability of rU:dA base pairs (27Martin F.H. Tinoco I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 2295-2299Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), the premature dissociation of complexes observed at the end of a template having a terminal A6 tract in the T strand (Fig. 6) is expected. However, the lower yield of transcripts from such a template is not consistent with a lowered hybrid stability (which should increase the turnover rate and hence product yield). As noted above, a possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the low stability of rU:dA base pairs may result in a decreased rate of elongation, thus increasing the time required to synthesize an rU:dA hybrid long enough to destabilize the complex and promote dissociation. In exploring this phenomenon, we examined the effects of a longer dA tract at the end of the T strand (an A10 tract) and found that very few polymerases were able to reach the end of this template (Fig. 6,lane 11). Under these conditions the longest products synthesized appeared to have incorporated only 8 U residues, suggesting that this is the maximum length of an extended rU:dA hybrid that the enzyme can tolerate when approaching the end of the DNA or that the enzyme slips to the end of the template after the incorporation of 7–8 consecutive UMP residues (33Macdonald L.E. Zhou Y. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 1030-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In previous work, we examined the effects of extended poly(dA) tracts in the T strand when these are embedded within a transcription unit (i.e. are not located at the end of the template) and found that they destabilize T7 RNAP, sometimes causing termination but also resulting in slippage of the transcription complex on the template (33Macdonald L.E. Zhou Y. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 1030-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These effects were greatly enhanced at lower concentrations of UTP, and under these conditions the slippage products were observed to approach a limit size that would correspond to the incorporation of 8–10 consecutive UMP residues (33Macdonald L.E. Zhou Y. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 1030-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These observations may have relevance to the process of termination. Class I termination signals for T7 RNAP (e.g. Tφ) as well as rho-independent termination signals for E. coli RNAP encode RNAs with a stable stem-loop structure followed by a run of uridylate residues. It seems likely that these U runs function both to destabilize the transcription complex as well as to slow the passage of the enzyme through the signal (34Landick R. Cell. 1997; 88: 741-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The picture that emerges from these and other studies of T7 RNAP is of a transcription complex that is held together by dynamic interactions between the RNAP, the DNA template, and the RNA product. As the enzyme approaches the end of the template strand, potential contacts with downstream regions of the template are lost, resulting in decreased stability of the complex.4 At this point, the stability of the RNA:DNA hybrid becomes critical to the continued maintenance of the complex. If the strength of the hybrid is high (e.g. in a G:C-rich sequence context) the complex is slow to dissociate, allowing the enzyme to position a new T strand 3′ end (if available) in the active site and to resume transcription. If the strength of the hybrid is low (e.g. in an rU:dA context), dissociation is more likely to occur before the enzyme can resume transcription. Under normal conditions of transcription in which the enzyme is highly processive (i.e. the presence of an intact duplex DNA template downstream, the absence of a pause or termination signal, and non-limiting concentrations of substrate), changes in the strength of the local RNA:DNA hybrid generally do not decrease the stability of the EC below the threshold that would result in dissociation. Thus, the RNAP does not usually terminate in extended T:A-rich regions nor does it pause in G:C-rich tracts (see Ref. 33Macdonald L.E. Zhou Y. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 1030-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar and this work). The contribution of the RNA:DNA hybrid to complex stability is likely to become of particular importance when the EC is destabilized or is halted for some reason (e.g. upon reaching the end of the template, or in the context of a pause/termination signal (35Lyakhov D.L. He B. Zhang X. Studier F.W. Dunn J.J. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar)2). In work to be reported elsewhere, we have found that the structure and stability of the T7 transcription complex is dynamically determined and that the properties of a halted EC are quite different from an EC that is involved in active transcription.4,5 Efficient release of the complex at the ends of the template is stimulated in the presence of T7 lysozyme (which enhances recognition of certain types of termination signals (26Lyakhov D.L. He B. Zhang X. Studier F.W. Dunn J.J. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 28-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 35Lyakhov D.L. He B. Zhang X. Studier F.W. Dunn J.J. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar)) or by the use of T7 RNAP mutants with altered termination properties. 6M. R. Rong, A. Kukarin, and W. T. McAllister, manuscript in preparation.

Leader exons 6 and 7 of the ovine IGF-II gene, with their 5′-flanking regions, were first isolated. Characterization of transcription start sites revealed a unique site for exon 6 and three dispersed sites for exon 7. Nuclear run-on assays showed a 5-fold higher transcription rate of the IGF-II gene in liver of adrenalectomized fetuses compared with control animals, suggesting that regulation of IGF-II gene expression by cortisol is at the transcriptional level. RNase protection assays demonstrated hepatic leader exon 7 expression in adrenalectomized fetuses to be more than 2-fold higher than in controls, whereas it was reduced by 50% in cortisol-infused fetuses compared with controls. There was no effect on the expression of other leader exons. Functions of the upstream regulatory region of leader exon 7 (i.e.promoter P4) were investigated by luciferase transient expression. A region of −172 bases downstream relative to the first transcription site of leader exon 7 was shown to retain basal promoter activity and respond to cortisol. These results suggest that cortisol may induce the prenatal decline in ovine hepatic IGF-II expression by suppressing promoter P4 of the IGF-II gene.

The insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) 1The abbreviations used are: IGF, insulin-like growth factor; kb, kilobase pair(s); bp, base pair(s); nt, nucleotide(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT, reverse transcription. are small single-chain peptides that affect cell proliferation and metabolism. The two major forms, IGF-I and IGF-II, comprise 70 and 67 amino acids for the mature peptides, respectively, and are structurally related to each other and to insulin (1Sara V.R. Hall K. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 707: 591-614Crossref Scopus (743) Google Scholar). IGF-I plays an important role throughout development, and postnatally it regulates growth under the control of pituitary growth hormone (2Roberts Jr., C.T. Brown A.L. Graham D.E. Seelig S. Berry S. Gabbay K.H. Rechler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10025-10028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, IGF-II is considered to have a major role in fetal growth. Disruption of the IGF-II gene by homologous recombination in transgenic mice produces growth deficiency at birth, directly demonstrating the growth-promoting function of IGF-II in the fetus (3DeChiara T.M. Efstratiadis A. Robertson E.J. Nature. 1990; 345: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar). The IGF-II genes in human, rat, and mouse have been characterized (4Ikejiri K. Wasada T. Haruki K. Hizuka N. Hirata Y. Yamamoto M. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 5van Dijk M.A. Holthuizen P.E. Sussenbach J.S. Mol. Cell.

DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 725-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and a recent report on the structure of the ovine IGF-II gene (8Ohlsen S.M. Lugenbeel K.A. Wong E.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) showed it to be most similar to that of the human gene. In the human IGF-II gene nine exons including six 5′-untranslated leader exons, and four promoters, P1–P4, have been identified. Promoter P1 is active in adults, whereas the other promoters are active in many fetal tissues, including liver, and are switched off completely in adult (5van Dijk M.A. Holthuizen P.E. Sussenbach J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 88: 175-185Google Scholar,9van Dijk M.A. Holthuizen P. Sussenbach J.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1992; 88: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The developmental and tissue-specific regulation of IGF-II mRNA expression is complex. The predominant IGF in the fetal circulation is IGF-II, and levels of IGF-II mRNA and protein are high in most fetal tissues; their concentration in utero is about 10 times greater than that of IGF-I (10D'Ercole J.A. J. Dev. Physiol. 1987; 9: 481-495PubMed Google Scholar). After birth, IGF-II expression is markedly decreased in most tissues (1Sara V.R. Hall K. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 707: 591-614Crossref Scopus (743) Google Scholar). However, regulatory factors and mechanisms involved in IGF-II gene expression still remain poorly understood. In the ovine fetus, there is a gradual rise in plasma cortisol levels starting about 2 weeks before birth and culminating in a dramatic rise during the final 3–5 days in utero (11Silver M. Exp. Physiol. 1990; 75: 285-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that cortisol fulfills the vital role of initiating many of the important prepartum maturation events that are essential for neonatal survival (11Silver M. Exp. Physiol. 1990; 75: 285-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It is during this latter period that the plasma level of IGF-II and the rate of fetal growth decline. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the surge in fetal plasma cortisol suppresses hepatic IGF-II mRNA expression during late gestation (12Li J. Saunders J.C. Gilmour R.S. Silver M. Fowden A.L. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2083-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The aims of the present study were, therefore, to gain further insight into the transcriptional control of the ovine IGF-II gene by cortisol and to identify the regulatory region of the gene involved in this response. A sheep genomic library in λ EMBL3 was screened with a human IGF-II cDNA fragment (13Bell G.I. Merryweather J.P. Sanchez-Pescador R. Rall L.B. Nature. 1984; 310: 775-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). A positive clone was digested with PstI and EcoRI and subcloned into M13mp18. Further screening produced positive subclones containing fragments of 1.7 and 0.9 kb, which were found to encode exon 8 (the first coding exon) and exon 9, respectively. Another positive genomic clone from the primary screening was digested with EcoRI and SalI, and the fragments were analyzed by Southern blot using an α-32P-radiolabeled 1.3-kb human IGF-II DNA fragment containing full-length leader exon 6 of the human IGF-II gene (kindly given by Dr. Paul Schofield, Department of Anatomy, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom (UK)). Fragments of 3.0 and 2.4 kb that hybridized to the probe were shown to contain leader exons 6 and 7, and their flanking regions, of the ovine IGF-II gene. The M13mp18 subclones containing exons 8 and 9 were sequenced by the single-stranded method of Sanger (14Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52771) Google Scholar). The EcoRI/SalI fragments containing leader exons 6 and 7 were cloned into Bluescript KS+ (Stratagene Ltd., Cambridge, UK), and nested deletions generated by exonuclease III (15Henikoff S. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 28: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (2832) Google Scholar) were sequenced. Where double-stranded sequencing gave rise to compressions, further subclones were generated in M13 and single-stranded sequencing was carried out. In all cases clones were sequenced from both ends. Splicing sites were determined by comparing the genomic sequence and that of leader exon-containing cDNAs obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The Wisconsin Package system (16Devereux J. Haebeali P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar) was used for computer sequence analysis. Six Welsh Mountain ewes carrying twin fetuses of known gestational age were used. Under halothane anesthesia (1.5% in O2/N2O2), one of two procedures was carried out using the surgical procedures described previously (17Comline R.S. Silver M. J. Physiol. 1972; 222: 233-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar): 1) intravascular catheterization of both fetuses in three sets of twins at 115–117 days of gestation, and 2) bilateral adrenalectomy of one fetus in each of three sets of twins at 117–119 days of gestation (term = 145 days). At least 5 days after surgery, the catheterized twin fetuses were infused intravenously with either cortisol (2–3 mg/kg/day in 3 ml of 0.9% (w/v) saline; EF-Cortelan, Glaxo Ltd.) or saline (3 ml/day; 0.9% (w/v)) for 5 days beginning at 122–125 days of gestation. Blood samples of 2 ml were taken daily from these fetuses throughout the experimental period, and tissues were collected at the end of the infusion period at 127–130 days. Blood and tissue samples were obtained from the adrenalectomized fetuses and their control twins at 143–145 days. All fetuses, regardless of previous treatment, were delivered by Caesarian section under general anesthesia (sodium pentobarbitone, 20 mg/kg intravenously). Blood samples were taken from the fetus immediately at delivery either through the indwelling arterial catheter or by venipuncture from the umbilical artery. After administration of a lethal dose of anesthetic (sodium pentobarbitone, 200 mg/kg intravenously), a sample of liver was collected, frozen rapidly in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until analysis. Blood samples were centrifuged immediately at 4 °C, and the plasma was stored at −20 °C until determination of cortisol concentrations using a radioimmunoassay validated for use with ovine plasma (18Robinson O.M. Comline R.S. Fowden A.L. Silver M. Q. J. Exp. Physiol. 1983; 68: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Total RNA was isolated from 1-g portions of frozen tissue using the guanidinium thiocyanate method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (19Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Total RNA was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm (1 A 260 unit = 40 μg). To check equivalence of RNA samples, total poly(A)+ content was also measured, as described previously (20Saunders J.C. Dickson M.C. Pell J.M. Gilmour R.S. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 6: 233-240Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A constant relation between A 260 and poly(A)+ content was found for RNA from all tissues. The transcription start sites for leader exons 6 and 7 were mapped by RNase protection assay of fetal sheep liver RNA using probes generated from Bluescript genomic clones containing fragments of exons 6 and 7, respectively. Sequence analysis revealed unique restriction enzyme sites, PstI and NheI in the 5′-flanking sequences of exon 6 and exon 7, respectively. These two sites were used to linearize the plasmids. Antisense riboprobes for exons 6 and 7 were synthesized by in vitro transcription with T3 and T7 RNA polymerase, respectively. A full-length antisense transcript of 509 bases was obtained for leader exon 6, which contained 473 bases of intronic sequence directly upstream of exon 6. The exon 7 template gave a full-length 723 bases transcript containing 161 bases of 5′ intronic sequence. Northern blot analyses were performed on 20 μg of total RNA fractionated on a denaturing agarose gel (Stratagene protocols), and transferred to Hybond-N (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). An ovine IGF-II exon 8 fragment was α-32P-radiolabeled and used for hybridization. The leader exon containing riboprobe used in this study spans exons 7–8 of the ovine IGF-II mRNA. This was generated by RT-PCR using oligonucleotide primers as follows. For the probe spanning exons 7 and 8, the 5′ primer was 5′-AGTCAG(GAATTC)GGACATTAGCTTCTCCT-3′, comprising an EcoRI recognition site (in parentheses) and the sequence between nucleotides 2954–2971 in Fig. 1 c. The 3′ primer in exon 8 used for PCR was 5′-GTACGA(AAGCTT)CTGAAGTAGAAGCCGCG-3′, comprising a HindIII recognition site linked to the complement of the DNA sequence of exon 8. Using this set of primers, PCR was carried out on cDNA synthesized from total RNA extracted from fetal sheep liver at 134 days of gestation, as described previously (20Saunders J.C. Dickson M.C. Pell J.M. Gilmour R.S. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 6: 233-240Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The product was digested with EcoRI and HindIII, cloned unidirectionally into Bluescript KS and verified by double-stranded dideoxy sequencing following the method of Chen and Seeburg (21Chen E.Y. Seeburg P.H. DNA J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 4: 165-170Google Scholar). The plasmids were linearized by EcoRI digestion and used as templates to generate antisense riboprobes with T3 RNA polymerase. Riboprobes were synthesized in the presence of [α-32P]UTP (ICN) to yield labeled antisense RNA probes, and RNase protection assays were performed on 50 μg of individual liver RNA samples, exactly as described previously (20Saunders J.C. Dickson M.C. Pell J.M. Gilmour R.S. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 6: 233-240Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Protected fragments were separated on 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gels, the dried gels exposed to x-ray film (Kodak, Cambridge, UK) and the intensities of protected bands quantified using an image analyzer (Seescan Imaging, Cambridge, UK). Nuclei were prepared from fresh liver of two sets of 143-day-old unoperated control and adrenalectomized twin sheep fetuses using the method of Martelli et al. (22Martelli A.M. Gilmour R.S. Bertagnolo V. Neri L.M. Manzoli L. Cocco L. Nature. 1992; 358: 242-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The purity of the nuclei was checked by microscopy and their DNA concentration measured spectrophotometrically following solubilization in 0.1 n NaOH. In vitro transcription reactions were carried out following the method essentially as described by Linial et al. (23Linial M. Gunderson N. Groudine M. Science. 1985; 230: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Nuclear suspensions containing 90 μg of DNA were mixed with the reaction buffer and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. RNase-free DNase I (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to the reaction which was then incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. Radiolabeled RNAs were extracted using the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (19Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Ovine IGF-II exon 8 DNA (20 μg) in alkaline solution (1m NaCl, 0.1 n NaOH, and 10 mm EDTA) was heat-denatured, dot-blotted onto Hybond-N, and hybridized with radiolabeled transcripts at 65 °C for 48 h in hybridization buffer (6× SSC, 0.5% SDS, 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.1% Ficoll, 4 μl of Escherichia coli tRNA (10 mg/ml), 2 μl of RNase inhibitor) following prehybridization at 65 °C for 12 h. After hybridization, the filters were washed at 37 °C for 30 min in 2× SSC + 0.5% SDS and further washed at 65 °C for 30 min in 0.5× SSC + 0.1% SDS. The filters were autoradiographed by exposing to x-ray film at −70 °C and also counted directly in a scintillation counter. The 3-kb and 2.4-kb genomic fragments containing the flanking regions of exons 6 and 7 were released from Bluescript KS+ by digestion with EcoRI and SalI, and their termini converted into HindIII sites by ligation into pIC 20H followed by digestion with HindIII. The resultant fragments were ligated into the HindIII site of pGL-2 basic plasmid (Promega, Southampton, UK), and designated pGL-2-P3 and pGL-2-P4, respectively. Unidirectional deletions of construct pGL-2-P4 were generated by exonuclease III digestion following linearization with MluI and KpnI. A series of 5′-nested deletions of promoter P4 sequence were generated using exonuclease III and designated pGL-2-P4a to pGL-2-P4f. The extent of deletion in each case was determined by sequencing from the appropriate primer in pGL-2. Plasmid DNA for transfection was prepared using Qiagen-Tip500 (Qiagen, Surrey, UK). NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal calf serum. On the day prior to transfection, the cells were plated at about 30% confluence in the same medium. Transfections were performed by the CaPO4 method (24Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). After 24 h the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium minus phenol red and containing dexamethasone (50 ng/ml), and 10% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum. After incubation for another 24 h, the cells were harvested and lysed. Transfection efficiencies were normalized by co-transfection with pSV-β-Gal (Promega). β-Galactosidase and luciferase activities were analyzed exactly as described previously (Promega Biological Research Protocols). Positive clones were isolated from a sheep genomic library following screening with a probe for human IGF-II cDNA. Restriction enzyme digestion and Southern blot analysis with both the human IGF-II cDNA and exon 6 containing fragments led to the subcloning of four different fragments of the ovine IGF-II gene, with sizes of 3, 2.4, 1.7, and 0.9 kb, respectively. DNA sequence analysis revealed that the 3-kb fragment contains part of exon 6 and its 5′-flanking region and is contiguous with the 2.4-kb fragment, which contains sequences spanning the rest of exon 6, exon 7, and 5′- and 3′-flanking region of exon 7. The 1.7- and 0.9-kb fragments contain coding exons 8 and 9 of the ovine IGF-II gene, respectively. Fig. 1 (a and c) summarizes the positions of the DNA fragments sequenced on the gene and the DNA sequence of exons 6 and 7and their flanking regions. These data enabled antisense riboprobes to be constructed and then used to map the transcription start sites for the leader exons and investigate expression and regulation of the ovine IGF-II gene. To determine the transcription start sites for exons 6 and 7, RNase protection analyses were carried out with antisense probes to their respective 5′ upstream sequences, the schematics of which are shown in Fig. 2. The probes contain both 5′ intron and leader exon sequence, and since the genomic clones had been completely sequenced beforehand and the exon/intron boundaries were determined from the sequence of the RT-PCR products for exons 6–8 and exons 7–8-specific mRNAs, the position of the 3′ end of the protected fragment could be predicted unequivocally. The sizes of the protected fragments were determined accurately by co-electrophoresis of a known sequencing reaction and the position of the start site worked back from the 3′ end of the protected fragment for the leader exon. For exon 6, a template that spanned the first 122 bp of exon 6 and 473 bp of 5′ intronic sequence was obtained by linearizing Bluescript plasmid DNA containing the 3-kb fragment DNA by digestion with PstI (position 460 in Fig. 1 c). The riboprobe was internally labeled by in vitro transcription with T3 RNA polymerase, and gave a full-length antisense transcript of 509 bases. For exon 7, a template spanning exon 7 and 163 bp of 5′ intronic sequence was obtained by linearizing Bluescript plasmid DNA containing the 2.4-kb fragment by digestion with NheI (position 2781; Fig. 1 c), and this gave a full-length antisense T7 transcript of about 723 bases. Fig. 1 b shows the analysis of transcription start sites for exons 6 and 7, using RNase protection assay with the riboprobes. A single protected fragment of 122 nt in length for exon 6 and three protected fragments of 109, 104, and 98 nt for exon 7 were seen. The deduced transcription start sites for exons 6 and 7 are indicated in the DNA sequence (Fig. 1 c). These indicate that transcription starts at a single point of 1125 bp upstream from the 3′ end of exon 6 and at three points, 109, 104, and 98 bp upstream from the 3′ end of exon 7. Previous data showed that cortisol down-regulates the ovine IGF-II gene in the fetus during late gestation (12Li J. Saunders J.C. Gilmour R.S. Silver M. Fowden A.L. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2083-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the present study, a preliminary assessment of the effect of cortisol on the abundance of mRNA transcripts of the ovine IGF-II gene was carried out by Northern analysis. Total RNAs isolated from the liver of 143-day-old adrenalectomized fetuses and their control twins were hybridized with a labeled exon 8 probe. The IGF-II gene comprises alternate leader exons and multiple polyadenylation sites, which results in multiple mRNA species. The results showed that there was no qualitative change in mRNA species but there was a quantitative decrease in the levels of certain mRNA species, most notably transcripts of 1.3, 1.9, and 2.9 kb, in the livers of control compared with those of adrenalectomized fetuses at 143 days of gestation (Fig. 3). To determine how cortisol affects differential leader exon expression of the ovine IGF-II gene, RNase protection analysis was carried out with a riboprobe which extends across the sequence of exons 7–8 as shown in Fig. 2. In principle, all leader exon 7-derived mRNAs will give full protection to this riboprobe, whereas the mRNAs derived from others will protect only the exon 8 region. Hence, this probe produces two protected bands, one of 262 nt representing full-length protection by leader exon 7 containing transcripts and a second, smaller product of 162 nt, which arises from partial protection from the exon 8 sequence. This allowed simultaneous monitoring of expression of alternative leader exon derived transcripts within a single analysis. Liver RNA was prepared from sets of twin fetuses. In one fetus from each pair, the cortisol levels were manipulated by either exogenous cortisol infusion before 130 days (i.e. prior to the natural surge in cortisol) to increase fetal plasma cortisol levels or by fetal adrenalectomy, which prevents the prepartum cortisol surge. The other fetus from each pair was used as a control and was either saline-infused or unoperated. The RNase protection analysis results are shown in Fig. 4. When fetal cortisol levels were elevated either by exogenous infusion at 127–130 days or endogenously at 143–145 days, there was a significant decrease (p < 0.01) in the abundance of mRNA arising from the leader exon 7-specific transcripts, which gave the full-length protection (upper band), but no significant change in the abundance of the smaller fragments protected by mRNAs originating from other leader exons (p > 0.05). This result suggests that the regulation of IGF-II gene expression by cortisol in the late gestation fetus operates preferentially through regulating the expression of leader exon 7.Figure 4Determination of cortisol-responsive leader exon expression by RNase protection assays. Analysis was carried out using liver RNAs isolated from adrenalectomized (AX) and control (CON) twin fetuses at 143–145 days of gestation, after infusion with either cortisol (CORT) or saline (SAL) at 127–130 days. Panel a, ovine IGF-II gene expression examined by RNase protection using riboprobe exons 7–8, which spanned exons 7 to exon 8. Upper bands represent fragments protected by mRNAs derived from leader exon 7, and lower bandsrepresent fragments protected by mRNAs derived from the other leader exons. The protected signals were quantified by image analysis and represent mRNA levels. The histogram (panel b) shows the levels (presented by mean ± S.E.; n = 3) of differential leader exon expression.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Nuclear run-on experiments were carried out to determine whether the observed changes occurred at the level of transcription, mRNA processing or by selective alteration of mRNA stability. Nuclei were prepared from fresh liver obtained from two pairs of 143-day-old adrenalectomized and control twin fetuses and incubated in the presence of [α-32P]UTP to complete the transcription of nascent RNA chains. The radiolabeled RNAs were isolated and hybridized to an excess of ovine IGF-II exon 8 DNA dot-blotted onto nitrocellulose. Results from the two pairs of animals were similar, and Fig. 5 therefore gives the results from one set of animals. Hybridization signals, which reflect the in vivo transcription rates, are shown in Fig. 5. Quantitative analysis showed that the transcription rate of the IGF-II gene was approximately 5 times higher in the liver of adrenalectomized compared with control animals. These data suggest that, in vivo, expression of the ovine IGF-II gene in late gestation is controlled at least in part by cortisol at the transcriptional level. Having established that the ovine IGF-II gene is down regulated by cortisol at the transcriptional level as well as via affecting leader exon 7 expression preferentially, the promoter activity of the putative 5′ regulatory region (i.e. promoter P4) of the leader exon 7 was investigated in response to cortisol. As a control, the regulatory region (i.e. promoter P3) of the leader exon 6 was also included in this study. Both promoter sequences were constructed into the plasmid vector pGL-2-basic in both orientations to drive the luciferase reporter gene in transient expression. Functional analysis of the promoter activities was performed by transfection into NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 6). Full-length constructs for P3 (pGL-P3) and P4 (pGL-P4a) supported approximately the same degree of luciferase expression when cloned into the vector in the 5′ to 3′ orientation, but not in the opposite orientation (data not shown). The presence of 50 ng/ml dexamethasone in the medium caused a 50% reduction in the promoter activity of P4 but had no effect on the activity of promoter P3. Since leader exon 7 was shown to respond to cortisol the function of promoter P4 was investigated in further detail by ligation of a series of nested deletions to the vector pGL-2 basic. In this study, analysis of the P4 deletions showed that the promoter could be deleted to within about 172 bp of the transcriptional start site without affecting the relative inhibition by dexamethasone, although an overall reduction of promoter activity of about 30% was observed when the sequence upstream of −388 bp was removed. When all but 32 bp of the P4 leader sequence was deleted, a complete abolition of luciferase expression was seen. The basal P4 promoter and glucocorticoid repression functions therefore appear to reside in a minimal construct, which includes only a 172-bp sequence immediately upstream of the transcriptional start site of P4. In a previous study, the prepartum rise in fetal plasma cortisol was shown to be responsible for down-regulating IGF-II gene expression in the fetal ovine liver close to term (12Li J. Saunders J.C. Gilmour R.S. Silver M. Fowden A.L. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2083-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Generally, glucocorticoid hormones are thought to exert their effects at the transcriptional level by inducing or repressing expression of target genes (25Yamamoto K.R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1985; 19: 209-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). However, glucocorticoids have also been reported to regulate mRNA expression at the post-transcriptional level by affecting mRNA stability and by facilitating extranuclear transport of specific mRNA to the cytoplasm (26Paek I. Axel A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1496-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In the current study, in vitro run-on assays in isolated nuclei indicated that the transcription rate of the IGF-II gene was suppressed about 5-fold in liver nuclei from control fetuses with high plasma cortisol levels compared with those from fetuses in which the natural prepartum rise in plasma cortisol was prevented by adrenalectomy (Fig. 5). To investigate IGF-II gene regulation further, the regions of genomic DNA containing the fetal promoters were cloned and their expression characterized. Two potential regions of control are inferred from the existence of two un"
https://openalex.org/W2017764753,"We have previously reported, on the basis of transfection experiments, the existence of a silencer element in the 5'-flanking region of the human embryonic (epsilon) globin gene, located at -270 base pairs 5' to the cap site, which provides negative regulation for this gene. Experiments in transgenic mice suggest the physiological importance of this epsilon-globin silencer, but also suggest that down-regulation of epsilon-globin gene expression may involve other negative elements flanking the epsilon-globin gene. We have now extended the analysis of epsilon-globin gene regulation to include the flanking region spanning up to 6 kilobase pairs 5' to the locus control region using reporter gene constructs with deletion mutations and transient transfection assays. We have identified and characterized other strong negative regulatory regions, as well as several positive regions that affect transcription activation. The negative regulatory regions at -3 kilobase pairs (epsilonNRA-I and epsilonNRA-II), flanked by a positive control element, has a strong effect on the epsilon-globin promoter both in erythroid K562 and nonerythroid HeLa cells and contains several binding sites for transcription factor GATA-1, as evidenced from DNA-protein binding assays. The GATA-1 sites within epsilonNRA-II are directly needed for negative control. Both epsilonNRA-I and epsilonNRA-II are active on a heterologous promoter and hence appear to act as transcription silencers. Another negative control region located at -1.7 kilobase pairs (epsilonNRB) does not exhibit general silencer activity as epsilonNRB does not affect transcription activity when used in conjunction with an epsilon-globin minimal promoter. The negative effect of epsilonNRB is erythroid specific, but not stage-specific as it can repress transcription activity in both K562 erythroid cells as well as in primary cultures of adult erythroid cells. Phylogenetic DNA sequence comparisons with other primate and other mammalian species show unusual degree of flanking sequence homology for the epsilon-globin gene, including in several of the regions identified in these functional and DNA-protein binding analyses, providing alternate evidence for their potential importance. We suggest that the down-regulation of epsilon-globin gene expression as development progresses involves complex, cooperative interactions of these negative regulatory elements, epsilonNRA-I/epsilonNRA-II, epsilonNRB, the epsilon-globin silencer and probably other negative and positive elements in the 5'-flanking region of the epsilon-globin gene."
https://openalex.org/W2055143831,"We reported previously that deletion of the 50-amino acid NH2-terminal A/B domain of the chicken (c) or rat thyroid hormone (T3) receptor-α (T3Rα) decreased the T3-dependent stimulation of genes regulated by native thyroid hormone response elements (TREs). This requirement of the NH2-terminal A/B domain for transcriptional activation was mapped to amino acids 21–30 of cT3Rα. Expression of transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) in cells was shown to enhance T3-dependent transcriptional activation by cT3Rα, and this enhancement by TFIIB was dependent on the same 10-amino acid sequence. In vitro binding studies indicated that cT3Rα interacts efficiently with TFIIB, and this interaction requires amino acids 23KRKRK27 in the A/B domain. In this study we document the functional importance of these five basic residues in transcriptional activation by cT3Rα, further supporting the biological significance of these residues and their interaction with TFIIB. Interestingly, we also find that the same amino acids also affect DNA binding and dimerization of cT3Rα. Gel mobility shift assays reveal that a cT3Rα mutant that has all five basic amino acids changed from23KRKRK27 to 23TITIT27 binds to a palindromic TRE predominantly as a homodimer, whereas cT3Rα with the wild-type23KRKRK27 sequence binds predominantly as a monomer. This results from both a marked decrease in the ability of the cT3Rα mutant to bind as a monomer and from an enhanced ability to dimerize as reflected by an increase in DNA-bound T3R-retinoic X receptor heterodimers. These effects of23KRKRK27 on DNA binding, dimerization, transcriptional activation, and the association of T3Rα with TFIIB support the notion that this basic amino acid motif may influence the overall structure and function of T3Rα and, thus, play a role in determining the distinct context-dependent transactivation potentials of the individual T3R isoforms.

Steroid, retinoid, and thyroid hormone nuclear receptors are ligand-dependent transcription factors that couple extracellular signals directly to transcriptional responses. These receptors activate or repress transcription of target genes by binding to specific DNA sequences referred to as hormone response elements (HREs) 1The abbreviations used are: HRE(s), hormone response element(s); T3, triiodothyronine; T3R, triiodothyronine receptor; RAR, retinoic acid receptor; RXR, retinoid X receptor; h, human; r, rat; c, chicken; DR, direct repeat; IR, inverted repeat; ER, everted repeat; DBD, DNA binding domain; TFIIB, transcription factor IIB; MTV, mammary tumor virus; TREp, palindromic thyroid hormone response element; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; GH, growth hormone; LTR, long terminal repeat; Mal, malic enzyme; TRE1/2, TREp with single G to C change in one of the half-sites; pEX, pEXPRESS; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus; GST, glutathione S-transferase; 9-cis-RA, 9-cis retinoic acid; ROR, retinoid orphan receptor. (1Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6341) Google Scholar). The nuclear receptor superfamily can be divided into the steroid hormone receptor family and the thyroid hormone/retinoid receptor family (1Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6341) Google Scholar, 2Forman B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1293-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), which includes receptors that mediate the effects of thyroid hormone [l-triiodothyronine (T3) (the T3Rs), all-trans-retinoic acid (the RARs), 9-cis-retinoic acid (the RARs and RXRs), and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 as well as several orphan receptors (e.g. COUP-TF, c-erbAα2) whose ligand(s), if any, are unknown (3Lazar M.A. Endocr.

Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407PubMed Google Scholar). The T3Rs are encoded by two distinct but closely related genes (α and β) which, in humans (h), map to chromosomes 17 and 3, respectively (6Thompson C.C. Weinberger C. Lebo R. Evans R.M. Science. 1987; 237: 1610-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Each gene expresses several alternatively spliced isoforms. The T3Rα gene in the rat (r) and man expresses the T3-binding isoform T3Rα1 along with c-erbAα2, which does not bind T3 because of alternative splicing at the COOH terminus (3Lazar M.A. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 184-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 7Lazar M.A. Hodin R.A. Darling D.S. Chin W.W. Mol.

The closely related chicken (c) α gene expresses only cT3Rα, which is more than 90% similar at the amino acid level to rT3Rα1 and hT3Rα1 (6Thompson C.C. Weinberger C. Lebo R. Evans R.M.

Nature. 1986; 324: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). The T3Rβ gene expresses T3Rβ1 and T3Rβ2 that differ only in their NH2-terminal A/B regions, which are distinct from the A/B region of T3Rα1 (3Lazar M.A. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 184-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 11Hodin R. Lazar M.A. Wintman B.I. Darling D.S. Koenig R.J. Larsen P.R. Moore D.D. Chin W.W. Science. 1989; 244: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Except for the A/B domains, the T3Rα and T3Rβ receptors are more than 90% similar at the amino acid level. Thus, three T3Rs are expressed which differ primarily in the A/B domain, suggesting that this region may play a role in mediating different effects of these receptors. One of the central issues in understanding the actions of the T3Rs and other nuclear receptors is elucidation of the details by which target genes are recognized. The T3Rs and certain other members of thyroid hormone/retinoid receptor family bind to their HREs as monomers, homodimers (12Selmi S. Samuels H.H. J. Biol.

In particular, the T3Rs bind to and activate transcription from a wide variety of response elements organized as direct repeats (DR), inverted repeats (IR), or everted repeats (ER) of the optimized AGGTCA hexanucleotide half-site (25Umesono K. Giguere V. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Evans R.M. Nature. 1988; 336: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 26Baniahmad A. Steiner C. Kohne A.C. Renkawitz R.

Chen Y. Warne R.L. Moore D.D. Larsen P.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1996-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Recognition of specific base pairs within the half-site core binding motif is mediated by the highly conserved DNA binding domain (DBD), which defines the nuclear receptor superfamily. This highly conserved DBD contains 66–68 amino acids that are organized into two zinc finger structures that include 9 perfectly conserved cysteines followed by a carboxyl-terminal extension (29Freedman L.P. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 30Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2843) Google Scholar). A helix in the carboxyl-terminal extension, with its extensive minor groove contacts, effectively extends the contact surface of the DBD beyond the consensus 6-base pair half-site (31Rastinejad F. Perlmann T. Evans R.M. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The ability of nuclear hormone receptors to distinguish among specific HREs is conferred by 3 amino acids at the base of the first zinc finger in the DBD (the P box) (32Umesono K. Evans R.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 1139-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). This region is organized into an α-helix that penetrates the major groove and recognizes the specific nucleotide sequence of the HRE. Amino acids at the base of the second zinc finger (the D box) are thought to provide a dimerization interface for protein-protein interactions on certain HREs (32Umesono K. Evans R.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 1139-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Structural studies indicate that the DBDs of certain thyroid hormone/retinoid family members form a cooperative dimerization interface, when bound to DRs but not to IRs and ERs (31Rastinejad F. Perlmann T. Evans R.M. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). For IRs and ERs, binding of homodimers or heterodimers is thought to result from a dimerization interface located within the ligand binding domain. In addition to homodimer and heterodimer binding, the T3Rs also bind IRs, DRs, and other DNA configurations as monomers (14Forman B.M. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Ghysdael J. Samuels H.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 429-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In the absence of RXR, T3Rα binds more efficiently as monomers to these elements, and T3Rβ isoforms bind more efficiently as homodimers (33Darling D.S. Carter R.L. Yen P.M. Welborn J.M. Chin W.W. Umeda P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10221-10227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We reported previously that a 10-amino acid sequence within the A/B domain of cT3Rα or rT3Rα1 was essential for ligand-dependent activation of native HREs and for interaction of T3Rα with TFIIB (34Hadzic E. Desai-Yajnik V. Helmer E. Guo S. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4507-4517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, deletion of the 50-amino acid A/B domain of cT3Rα markedly reduced monomer binding and increased homodimer binding of the receptor, suggesting that the A/B domain of T3Rα imposes preferential monomer binding of the receptor (34Hadzic E. Desai-Yajnik V. Helmer E. Guo S. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4507-4517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we show that the same 5 basic amino acids23KRKRK27 which are necessary for efficient binding to TFIIB are required for transcriptional activity of cT3Rα. These same amino acids are also responsible for imposing preferential monomer binding and influencing the efficiency of heterodimer formation with RXR. To our knowledge this is the first identification of specific NH2-terminal residues involved in the differential binding of T3R isoforms to DNA. ΔMTV-TREp-CAT (14Forman B.M. Casanova J. Raaka B.M.

Chem. 1990; 265: 7395-7400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively, and contain direct and inverted repeats. The TRE1/2 is the same as the TREp except that it contains a single G to C change in one of the half-sites (AGGTCA to ACGTCA). Full-length cT3Rα cDNA, corresponding to amino acids 1–408, was cloned into a pEXPRESS (pEX) vector (pEX-cT3Rα) (37Forman B.M. Samuels H.H. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 105: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). pEX vectors contain the Rous sarcoma viral (RSV) LTR linked to a phage T7 RNA polymerase promoter from pET8c (38Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar), an Asp718 (KpnI) site, followed by stop codons in each reading frame and an SV40 polyadenylation signal. pEX can be used for expression in both Escherichia coli and mammalian cells and for synthesis of in vitro transcripts using purified T7 RNA polymerase (37Forman B.M. Samuels H.H. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 105: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). pRSV-T7-cT3Rα was made by inserting an oligonucleotide containing a T7 polymerase binding site with 5′- and 3′-HindIII cohesive ends between the RSV LTR and the cT3Rα cDNA in pRSV-cT3Rα (34Hadzic E. Desai-Yajnik V. Helmer E. Guo S. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4507-4517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide was designed so that the 5′-HindIII site is inactivated, but the 3′-HindIII site is regenerated upon insertion, allowing for future cloning at this site. pRSV-T7-cT3Rα(21–408) was formed by digesting pRSV-T7-cT3Rα(31–408) with HindIII and PflMI and inserting an oligonucleotide corresponding to amino acids 21–30. pRSV-T7-cT3Rα(31–408), which lacks the first 30 amino acids of cT3Rα, was constructed by removing the HindIII-PflMI fragment corresponding to amino acids 1–30 of cT3Rα from pRSV-T7-cT3Rα and inserting an oligonucleotide containing a polylinker (5′-HindIII-XbaI-NcoI-PflMI-3′) into the digested vector. The NcoI site in this and other pRSV-T7-cT3Rα mutants contains the ATG initiation codon. pEX-cT3Rα(51–408), lacking the entire A/B region, was constructed from pEX-cT3Rα(51–157) and pEX-cT3Rα. DNA corresponding to amino acids 119–408 was excised from pEX-cT3Rα with MscI and Asp718 and subcloned into pEX-cT3Rα(51–157) after digestion of the vector with MscI, which cleaves at codon 118, and Asp718, which cleaves just after codon 157. pEX-cT3Rα(51–157) was constructed by polymerase chain reaction of wild-type cT3Rα using appropriate primers. pRSV-T7-cT3Rα(21–408, 7/8) was constructed by cleaving pRSV-T7-cT3Rα(21–408) with HindIII and PflMI and replacing the DNA corresponding to amino acids 21–30 with an oligonucleotide that changed amino acids23KRKRK27 to 23TITIT27. pRSV-T7-cT3Rα(21–408, 9/10) was constructed in the same way using an oligonucleotide that changed amino acids23KRKRK27 to 23TITRK27. pRSV-T7-cT3Rα(21–408, 11/12) was constructed as pRSV-T7-cT3Rα(21–408, 7/8) using an oligonucleotide that changed amino acids 23KRKRK27 to23KRTIT27. pRSV-T7-cT3Rα(21–408, 13/14) was constructed in the same way using an oligonucleotide that changed amino acids 23KRKRK27 to23TIKIT27. pEX-TFIIB was made from human TFIIB in pET11d (39Hisatake K. Roeder R.G. Horikoshi M. Nature. 1993; 363: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The TFIIB cDNA was excised from the pET11d vector with NcoI and BamHI and cloned into the NcoI-BglII site of a pEX vector that contained a BglII site at the 3′-end instead of the Asp718 site (34Hadzic E. Desai-Yajnik V. Helmer E. Guo S. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4507-4517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pGST-RXR contains the entire mouse RXRα cDNA cloned into pGEX2T (40Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). This plasmid was constructed and provided to us by Paul T. van der Saag. HeLa cells were transfected by electroporation (14Forman B.M. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Ghysdael J. Samuels H.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 429-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 34Hadzic E. Desai-Yajnik V. Helmer E. Guo S. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4507-4517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After transfection, cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 15 mm Hepes, 0.1 mg/ml pyruvate, 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 50 μg/ml penicillin (DHAP medium) containing 10% (v/v) hormone-depleted calf serum with and without 1 μm T3 for 48 h (as indicated) before harvesting for CAT assay. CAT expression was measured by determining the extent of [14C]chloramphenicol (50 mCi/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) acetylation as described previously (41Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar, 42Flug F. Copp R.P. Casanova J. Horowitz Z.D. Janocko L. Plotnick M. Samuels H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6373-6382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined (43Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and amounts of cell protein assayed for CAT activity were varied to maintain the percentage of [14C]chloramphenicol acetylated in the linear range (<30%) during a 16-h incubation. CAT activity values were normalized to represent the percent of [14C]chloramphenicol acetylated by a specific amount of cell protein in 16 h at 37 °C. All experiments were performed in duplicate, and the results represent the means of at least three independent transfections. Within each transfection, duplicate samples varied less than 10%. cT3Rα, cT3Rα(21–408), cT3Rα(21–408, 7/8), cT3Rα(51–408), and the various cT3Rα NH2-terminal amino acid mutants were expressed by in vitro translation in reticulocyte lysates (24Au-Fliegner M. Helmer E. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5725-5737Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). A fraction of each translation received l-[35S]cysteine in the incubation, and the amount of each 35S-synthesized protein was analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis and quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager with ImageQuant software. The number of fmol of each cT3Rα protein synthesized in the lysate was estimated by the relative amounts of the individual35S-proteins and quantitation of reticulocyte lysate-synthesized cT3Rα by binding withl-[125I]T3 (24Au-Fliegner M. Helmer E. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5725-5737Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Reticulocyte lysate-translated cT3Rα proteins (about 10 fmol/μl of lysate) were incubated with 5 fmol (30,000 dpm) of the32P-labeled TREp or the TRE1/2 element. The 30-μl incubation mixture contained 25 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 0.5 mm EDTA, 75 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 0.05% Triton X-100 (v/v), 30 μg of ovalbumin, 0.3 μm ZnCl2, 0.2 μg of RNase A, and 10% glycerol (v/v) and either 0.5, 1.5, 3.0, or 4.5 μl of reticulocyte lysate (24Au-Fliegner M. Helmer E. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5725-5737Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Control reticulocyte lysate was added to the 0.5-, 1.5-, or 3.0-μl receptor preparations to adjust the final amount of lysate in each sample to 4.5 μl. Unless indicated otherwise, a comparison of the different cT3Rα proteins used the same number of fmol of receptor. Samples were analyzed by electrophoresis at 4 °C for 50 min in nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 37.5:1) in buffer containing 10 mm Tris, 7.5 mm acetic acid, 40 μm EDTA (pH 7.8) (12Selmi S.

Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 429-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The gels were then dried and autoradiographed. The assignment of receptor monomers and homodimers is based on the mobility of purified cT3Rα (14Forman B.M. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Ghysdael J. Samuels H.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 429-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Certain gel shift studies were quantitated using a PhosphorImager as indicated. The binding of35S-cT3Rα and mutants to GST and GST-RXRin vitro were carried out as described previously (34Hadzic E. Desai-Yajnik V. Helmer E. Guo S. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4507-4517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).l-[35S]Cysteine-labeled wild-type cT3Rα, cT3Rα(21–408), and the cT3Rα(21–408, 7/8) NH2-terminal mutant were prepared using TNT reticulocyte lysates (Promega). 25,000 dpm of35S-labeled protein was incubated with 25 ng of GST-RXR or 10 ng of GST protein immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads in 300 μl of Buffer A for 1 h at 4 °C on an Orbitron rotator. Buffer A consists of 50 mm KCl, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 6% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.05% Triton X-100 (34Hadzic E. Desai-Yajnik V. Helmer E. Guo S. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4507-4517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of GST protein used (10 ng) was equivalent to the amount of GST in the GST-RXR fusion protein (25 ng). Beads were collected by centrifugation at 4 °C for 5 min at ∼500 ×g and washed three times with 1 ml of Buffer A. The bound proteins were eluted with SDS-gel loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography.35S-Labeled wild-type or mutant proteins in the binding assays were analyzed by electrophoresis and autoradiography to ensure that equal amounts of input radioactivity of the labeled protein were used. Our previous studies aimed at elucidating the functional role of the NH2-terminal A/B region of cT3Rα indicated that amino acids 21–30 of cT3Rα, which are also conserved in the NH2-terminal A/B domains of rT3Rα1 and hT3Rα1, are essential for both transcriptional activation and for efficient binding to TFIIB (34Hadzic E. Desai-Yajnik V. Helmer E. Guo S. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4507-4517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More detailed in vitro binding studies revealed that residues 23KRKRK27 centered within amino acids 21–30 are required for efficient binding of cT3Rα with TFIIB (34Hadzic E. Desai-Yajnik V. Helmer E. Guo S. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4507-4517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the functional activity that we originally mapped to amino acids 21–30 may depend solely on these 5 basic residues. To test this possibility we compared the functional activities of cT3Rα(21–408) and cT3Rα(21–408, 7/8) in which23KRKRK27 was changed to23TITIT27. In transfection experiments with a reporter gene regulated by a single idealized TRE organized as an inverted repeat (TREp) of the optimized AGGTCA half-site (ΔMTV-TREp-CAT), cT3Rα(21–408) and cT3Rα (21–408, 7/8) showed similar activity (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, with ΔMTV-TRE-GH-CAT or ΔMTV-TRE-Mal-CAT, which contain native TREs, cT3Rα(21–408) was much more active (Fig. 1, Band C). These results are similar to our previous findings that showed that the functional effect of the NH2 terminus is much more prominent on reporters containing lower affinity native TREs compared with reporters containing the idealized higher affinity TREp (34Hadzic E. Desai-Yajnik V. Helmer E. Guo S. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4507-4517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, coexpression of TFIIB, although enhancing the activity of both receptors, results in a much higher level of T3-dependent stimulation by cT3Rα(21–408) (Fig. 1 C). The ability of TFIIB to enhance the activity of cT3Rα(21–408, 7/8) partially is not altogether unexpected and is similar to our previous results with cT3Rα(51–408). This most likely stems from the low affinity of amino acids 119–154 of the cT3Rα D region for TFIIB (34Hadzic E. Desai-Yajnik V. Helmer E. Guo S. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4507-4517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The NH2 terminus of T3R isoforms may confer cell type and promoter specificity not just through divergent, isotype-distinct, interactions with other transcription factors (34Hadzic E. Desai-Yajnik V. Helmer E. Guo S. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4507-4517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,44Tomura H. Lazar J. Phyillaier M. Nikodem V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5600-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) but also through conferring distinct DNA binding properties to receptor isotypes (45Chen H. Smit-McBride Z. Lewis S. Sharif M. Privalsky M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2366-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 46Giguere V. Tini M. Flock G. Ong E. Evans R. Otulakowski G. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 538-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). For example, the DNA binding properties of v-erbA differ from those of c-erbA (cT3Rα) and more closely resemble those of the RARs. The structural basis behind this difference in DNA recognition by v-erbA results from one or more changes within the v-erbA NH2-terminal domain (45Chen H. Smit-McBride Z. Lewis S. Sharif M. Privalsky M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2366-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 47Wong C.-W. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 9: 551-562Google Scholar). In a previous study we found that in the absence of RXR, cT3Rα binds to the TREp predominantly as a monomer, whereas cT3Rα(51–408) binds preferentially as a homodimer (34Hadzic E. Desai-Yajnik V.

https://openalex.org/W2079922794,"Glucagon is a peptide hormone that plays a central role in the maintenance of normal circulating glucose levels. Structure-activity studies have previously demonstrated the importance of histidine at position 1 and the absolute requirement for aspartic acid at position 9 for transduction of the hormonal signal. Site-directed mutagenesis of the receptor protein identified Asp<sup>64</sup> on the extracellular N-terminal tail to be crucial for the recognition function of the receptor. In addition, antibodies generated against aspartic acid-rich epitopes from the extracellular region competed effectively with glucagon for receptor sites, which suggested that negative charges may line the putative glucagon binding pocket in the receptor. These observations led to the idea that positively charged residues on the hormone may act as counterions to these sites. Based on these initial findings, we synthesized glucagon analogs in which basic residues at positions 12, 17, and 18 were replaced with neutral or acidic residues to examine the effect of altering the positive charge on those sites on binding and adenylyl cyclase activity. The results indicate that unlike N-terminal histidine, Lys<sup>12</sup>, Arg<sup>17</sup>, and Arg<sup>18</sup> of glucagon have very large effects on receptor binding and transduction of the hormonal signal, although they are not absolutely critical. They contribute strongly to the stabilization of the binding interaction with the glucagon receptor that leads to maximum biological potency."

Although the exact role of EF-3 remains to be elucidated, it reportedly stimulates aminoacyl-tRNA binding to the ribosomal A site (6Kamath A. Chakraburrty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15423-15428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and may be involved in release of deacylated tRNA from the E site (7Triana-Alonso F.J. Chakraburrty K. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol.

(Tokyo). 1988; 103: 522-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Examination of the domain structure of EF-3 reveals that it has several regions that bear homology to members of the ATP-binding cassette family of nucleotide binding proteins. It has been shown recently that point mutations within two of these ATP-binding motifs in EF-3 severely impair the ribosome-dependent ATPase activity (8Yang H. Hamada K. Terashima H. Izuta M.

EF-3 also exhibits other sequence homologies that may predict structural domains critical for its role in protein synthesis (9Belfield G.P. Tuite M.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These include a C-terminal region with homology to a conserved sequence element in aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, a basic C-terminal tail, and an extended domain at the N terminus that shares sequence homology with Escherichia coliribosomal protein S5.Ribosomal protein S5 interacts with 16 S rRNA (10Stern S.

Science. 1996; 272: 1659-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), therefore we wished to explore whether the S5 homology domain of EF-3 could interact with 18 S rRNA. This N-terminal region of EF-3 (N-term EF-3, amino acids 98–388) was cloned with a His6 tag, expressed, and purified from E. coli. UV cross-linking and filter-binding results indicate that the interaction between N-term EF-3 and 18 S rRNA is specific. N-term EF-3 associates with yeast ribosomes and inhibits the ribosome-dependent ATPase activity of native EF-3. These data suggest that at least one of the ribosome-binding sites of EF-3 may be at the N terminus, and also raises the possibility that the association of EF-3 with the fungal ribosome may be dependent upon RNA/protein interactions.RESULTSAnalysis of the amino acid sequence of EF-3 has indicated several evolutionarily conserved functional domains that may predict important features critical for protein synthesis (9Belfield G.P. Tuite M.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), including a domain at the N terminus that exhibits some primary sequence homology to the ribosomal protein S5 from E. coli and Bacillus stearothermophilus. An alignment of the N terminus of EF-3 with B. stearothermophilus S5 revealed 26% identity and 55% similarity between the two proteins (9Belfield G.P. Tuite M.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), including a region of S5 predicted to interact with rRNA (15Ramakrishnan V. White S. Nature. 1992; 358: 768-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Based upon these sequence similarities, as well as studies on the interaction between S5 and 16 S rRNA (10Stern S. Powers T. Changchien L.M. Noller H.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 683-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 11Osswald M. Greuer B. Brimacombe R. Stoffler G. Baumert H. Fasold H.

Science. 1996; 272: 1659-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we were interested to determine if this region within the N-terminal domain of EF-3 could interact with 18 S rRNA in an analogous manner. We cloned the N terminus of EF-3 (amino acids 98–388) as a His-tagged fusion protein, and expressed the resultant protein in E. coli. Fig. 1shows the purification of the protein (referred to here as N-term EF-3) under denaturing conditions. By SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining, we judge the protein preparation to be highly enriched for N-term EF-3, with only minor smaller molecular weight contaminants.To examine whether N-term EF-3 was capable of interacting with 18 S rRNA, a UV cross-linking assay was used (Fig. 2). This analysis revealed an RNA/protein cross-link which migrated at ∼35 kDa on the gel, in accordance with the size of the recombinant protein (Fig. 3, lane 1). Addition of 5-, 10-, and 250-fold molar excess of unlabeled nonspecific competitor RNAs indicated that fragments of E. coli 16 S rRNA (nt 542–577,lanes 8–10) and S. cerevisiae 18 S rRNA (nt 588–625, lanes 5–7) were unable to compete for the cross-link, while addition of unlabeled specific competitor 18 S rRNA (lanes 2–4) did effectively compete. These results indicate that N-term EF-3 is able to form a cross-link with 18 S rRNA, and that this interaction is specific.Figure 2UV cross-linking assay reveals that N-term EF-3 binds specifically to 18 S rRNA. 5 fmol of radiolabeled 18 S rRNA were incubated with purified N-term EF-3 for 10 min at 30 °C in the absence (lane 1) or presence of unlabeled competitor RNAs at 10-, 50-, and 250-fold molar excess (lanes 2–4, 18 S rRNA, specific competitor; lanes 5–7, 18 S f RNA, nonspecific competitor, lanes 8–10,E. coli 16 S f rRNA nonspecific competitor).

These results are in good general agreement with the UV cross-linking data shown in Fig. 2, and further supports the notion that the interaction between N-term EF-3 and 18 S rRNA is specific. An additional filter-binding experiment was done using a range of purified N-term EF-3 in molar excess of labeled 18 S rRNA (Fig. 4). The results indicate the apparent K d to be approximately 238 nm.Figure 4Filter-binding assay reveals that N-term EF-3 binds to 18 S rRNA with an apparent K d of 238 nm. 8.0 fmol of radiolabeled 18 S rRNA was incubated with increasing amounts of purified N-term EF-3 for 10 min at 30 °C, and then filtered and washed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The maximal binding activity was normalized to 1.0 in this experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The results described above suggest that the N terminus of EF-3 interacts specifically with 18 S rRNA, suggesting that native EF-3 may interact with ribosomal RNA via its N-terminal domain. To directly address the question whether N-term EF-3 could interact with ribosomes, purified native and N-term EF-3 were incubated with yeast 80 S ribosomes. Factors associated with ribosomes were sedimented through a glycerol cushion, and resolved via SDS-PAGE. An immunoblot analysis is shown in Fig. 5, and reveals that native EF-3 (Fig. 5 A, lane 2) and N-term EF-3 (Fig. 5 B, lane 5) do not pellet through the glycerol cushion in the absence of 80 S ribosomes. As expected, native EF-3 associates with yeast 80 S ribosomes (Fig. 5 A, lane 4). A similar experiment was done using increasing amounts of N-term EF-3 bound to ribosomes. Fig. 5 B shows that N-term EF-3 is able to specifically associate with yeast 80 S ribosomes (lanes 3 and 4), further supporting the hypothesis that the N terminus of EF-3 can interact with ribosomes.Figure 5N-term EF-3 binds to yeast 80 S ribosomes. A, binding of native EF-3 to yeast 80 S ribosomes and analysis of ribosome-bound proteins was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” An immunoblot using a polyclonal antibody against native EF-3 revealed EF-3 to be associated with 80 S ribosomes. 5 pmol of EF-3 was run as a marker in lane 1;lane 2, EF-3 (in the absence of 80 S ribosomes) sedimented through the glycerol cushion; lane 3, 80 S ribosomes alone;lane 4, 5 pmol EF-3 plus 5 pmol of 80 S ribosomes.B, N-term EF-3 was incubated in the absence or presence of yeast 80 S ribosomes as described above, and an immunoblot of ribosome-associated proteins was performed using a monoclonal antibody against the His6 tag (Qiagen).

Chem. 1989; 264: 15423-15428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that this activity requires a direct contact between EF-3 and ribosomal proteins and/or 18 S rRNA. We next asked whether the ribosome-dependent ATPase activity of native EF-3 could be inhibited by the addition of excess N-term EF-3. When increasing amounts of N-term EF-3 were added to the reaction, a concomitant decrease in the ribosome-dependent ATPase activity of native EF-3 was observed (Fig. 6); For example, at a 25-fold molar excess of N-term EF-3 to native EF-3, we observed almost a 50% decrease in the ATPase activity of native EF-3 stimulated by yeast ribosomes. This dramatic inhibition of ATPase activity was not seen in control experiments when excess bovine serum albumin was added to the reaction (Fig. 6). The results of these experiments suggest that N-term EF-3 is able to inhibit the ribosome-dependent ATPase activity of native EF-3, presumably by competing for the EF-3 binding site(s) on ribosomes or rRNA.Figure 6N-term EF-3 inhibits ribosome-dependent ATPase activity of native EF-3.Purified, native EF-3 was incubated with S. cerevisiae 80 S ribosomes with increasing amounts of N-term EF-3 (▪——▪) or bovine serum albumin (▴——▴), and ATPase activity was determined by a colorimetric assay (see “Experimental Procedures.”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONSequence comparisons between E. coli ribosomal protein S5 and S. cerevisiae EF-3 have revealed some degree of homology, particularly with the N-terminal domain of EF-3. Because S5 has been shown to interact with 16 S rRNA (10Stern S. Powers T. Changchien L.M. Noller H.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 683-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 11Osswald M.

Science. 1996; 272: 1659-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we wished to test the possibility that EF-3 might make contact with 18 S rRNA via its N terminus. A 291-amino acid region of EF-3 (N-term EF-3) encompassing the S5 homology domain was expressed as a His-tagged protein in E. coli, and two independent biochemical assays were used to show a specific interaction between 18 S rRNA and N-term EF-3. That a specific RNA/protein cross-link could be induced by UV light is intriguing, particularly in light of the fact that this region of EF-3 lacks any of the canonical motifs common to many RNA-binding proteins (16Burd C. Dreyfus G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar). However, the failure to detect these motifs should not be taken to reflect an inability to interact with RNA. More work is needed to precisely identify and characterize the amino acid residues of N-term EF-3 involved in making contact with RNA.Previously, Kovalchuke and Chakraburtty (17Kovalchuke O. Chakraburtty K. Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 32: 336-342PubMed Google Scholar) reported an interaction between EF-3 and polynucleotides, with preferential binding to poly(G). While they showed that both 18 S and 26 S rRNA could effectively inhibit activation of EF-3 ATPase by yeast ribosomes, they did not examine whether EF-3 could interact directly with either of these RNAs in an isolated system. The results of our RNA-binding experiments demonstrate a physical interaction between N-term EF-3 and 18 S rRNA that is specific. While we did not examine the binding of N-term EF-3 to 26 S rRNA, it is possible that different domains of EF-3 are required for contacting different regions of the ribosome (see below).Because the C terminus of EF-3 is very basic and contains three clusters of lysine residues, it has been speculated that EF-3 may interact with yeast ribosomes via this region. In support of this, Uritani et al. (18Uritani M. Tabata A. Nakayama K. Izuta M. Iizumi M. Arisawa M. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 39: 227-234PubMed Google Scholar) reported that a monoclonal antibody specific for the C-terminal region of EF-3 inhibits its ribosome-dependent ATPase activity. Other work has reported that a GST-fusion protein containing the C-terminal domain of EF-3 remains associated with yeast ribosomes, suggesting that least one of the ribosome-binding sites of EF-3 resides within this region (19Kambampati R. Chakraburtty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6377-6381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Our observations that the N-terminal domain of EF-3 binds 18 S rRNA and also associates with ribosomes do not necessarily conflict with the results described above with the C-terminal domain. The two results can be easily reconciled by taking into account the fact that multiple contacts may exist between EF-3 and ribosomes or rRNA. It may be possible that some regions of EF-3 (like the N terminus) may interact directly with rRNA, while other domains are responsible for making protein-protein contacts. Further dissection of the putative protein and RNA-binding domains of EF-3 will help to elucidate the complex nature of the interactions described above, and may provide additional information regarding the functions of EF-3 in fungal translation. Fungi are unique among eukaryotes in their requirement for a third soluble translation elongation factor, called elongation factor 3 (EF-3) 1The abbreviations used are: EF-3, elongation factor 3; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; nt, nucleotide. 1The abbreviations used are: EF-3, elongation factor 3; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; nt, nucleotide. (1Skogerson L. Wakatama E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). EF-3 was first identified as a 125-kDa single polypeptide in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (2Dasmahapatra B. Chakraburtty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9999-10004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Uritani M. Miyazaki M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 103: 522-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and has subsequently been identified in other fungal species (3Uritani M. Miyazaki M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 103: 522-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 4Chakraburrty K. Kamath A. Int. J. Biochem. 1988; 20: 581-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 5Colthurst D.R. Santos M. Grant C.M. Tuite M.F. FEMS Microbiol. Letts. 1991; 80: 45-49Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although the exact role of EF-3 remains to be elucidated, it reportedly stimulates aminoacyl-tRNA binding to the ribosomal A site (6Kamath A. Chakraburrty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15423-15428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and may be involved in release of deacylated tRNA from the E site (7Triana-Alonso F.J. Chakraburrty K. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20473-20478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). EF-3 possesses strong ribosome-dependent ATPase and GTPase activities (2Dasmahapatra B. Chakraburtty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9999-10004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Uritani M. Miyazaki M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 103: 522-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Examination of the domain structure of EF-3 reveals that it has several regions that bear homology to members of the ATP-binding cassette family of nucleotide binding proteins. It has been shown recently that point mutations within two of these ATP-binding motifs in EF-3 severely impair the ribosome-dependent ATPase activity (8Yang H. Hamada K. Terashima H. Izuta M. Yamaguchi-Sihta E. Kondoh O. Satoh H. Miyazaki M. Arisawa M. Miyamoto C. Kitada K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1310: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). EF-3 also exhibits other sequence homologies that may predict structural domains critical for its role in protein synthesis (9Belfield G.P. Tuite M.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These include a C-terminal region with homology to a conserved sequence element in aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, a basic C-terminal tail, and an extended domain at the N terminus that shares sequence homology with Escherichia coliribosomal protein S5. Ribosomal protein S5 interacts with 16 S rRNA (10Stern S. Powers T. Changchien L.M. Noller H.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 683-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 11Osswald M. Greuer B.

Science. 1996; 272: 1659-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), therefore we wished to explore whether the S5 homology domain of EF-3 could interact with 18 S rRNA. This N-terminal region of EF-3 (N-term EF-3, amino acids 98–388) was cloned with a His6 tag, expressed, and purified from E. coli. UV cross-linking and filter-binding results indicate that the interaction between N-term EF-3 and 18 S rRNA is specific. N-term EF-3 associates with yeast ribosomes and inhibits the ribosome-dependent ATPase activity of native EF-3. These data suggest that at least one of the ribosome-binding sites of EF-3 may be at the N terminus, and also raises the possibility that the association of EF-3 with the fungal ribosome may be dependent upon RNA/protein interactions. RESULTSAnalysis of the amino acid sequence of EF-3 has indicated several evolutionarily conserved functional domains that may predict important features critical for protein synthesis (9Belfield G.P. Tuite M.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), including a domain at the N terminus that exhibits some primary sequence homology to the ribosomal protein S5 from E. coli and Bacillus stearothermophilus. An alignment of the N terminus of EF-3 with B. stearothermophilus S5 revealed 26% identity and 55% similarity between the two proteins (9Belfield G.P. Tuite M.F. Mol.

Science. 1996; 272: 1659-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we were interested to determine if this region within the N-terminal domain of EF-3 could interact with 18 S rRNA in an analogous manner. We cloned the N terminus of EF-3 (amino acids 98–388) as a His-tagged fusion protein, and expressed the resultant protein in E. coli. Fig. 1shows the purification of the protein (referred to here as N-term EF-3) under denaturing conditions. By SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining, we judge the protein preparation to be highly enriched for N-term EF-3, with only minor smaller molecular weight contaminants.To examine whether N-term EF-3 was capable of interacting with 18 S rRNA, a UV cross-linking assay was used (Fig. 2). This analysis revealed an RNA/protein cross-link which migrated at ∼35 kDa on the gel, in accordance with the size of the recombinant protein (Fig. 3, lane 1). Addition of 5-, 10-, and 250-fold molar excess of unlabeled nonspecific competitor RNAs indicated that fragments of E. coli 16 S rRNA (nt 542–577,lanes 8–10) and S. cerevisiae 18 S rRNA (nt 588–625, lanes 5–7) were unable to compete for the cross-link, while addition of unlabeled specific competitor 18 S rRNA (lanes 2–4) did effectively compete.

When increasing amounts of N-term EF-3 were added to the reaction, a concomitant decrease in the ribosome-dependent ATPase activity of native EF-3 was observed (Fig. 6); For example, at a 25-fold molar excess of N-term EF-3 to native EF-3, we observed almost a 50% decrease in the ATPase activity of native EF-3 stimulated by yeast ribosomes. This dramatic inhibition of ATPase activity was not seen in control experiments when excess bovine serum albumin was added to the reaction (Fig. 6). The results of these experiments suggest that N-term EF-3 is able to inhibit the ribosome-dependent ATPase activity of native EF-3, presumably by competing for the EF-3 binding site(s) on ribosomes or rRNA. DISCUSSIONSequence comparisons between E. coli ribosomal protein S5 and S. cerevisiae EF-3 have revealed some degree of homology, particularly with the N-terminal domain of EF-3. Because S5 has been shown to interact with 16 S rRNA (10Stern S. Powers T. Changchien L.M. Noller H.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 683-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 11Osswald M.

Science. 1996; 272: 1659-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we wished to test the possibility that EF-3 might make contact with 18 S rRNA via its N terminus. A 291-amino acid region of EF-3 (N-term EF-3) encompassing the S5 homology domain was expressed as a His-tagged protein in E. coli, and two independent biochemical assays were used to show a specific interaction between 18 S rRNA and N-term EF-3. That a specific RNA/protein cross-link could be induced by UV light is intriguing, particularly in light of the fact that this region of EF-3 lacks any of the canonical motifs common to many RNA-binding proteins (16Burd C. Dreyfus G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar). However, the failure to detect these motifs should not be taken to reflect an inability to interact with RNA. More work is needed to precisely identify and characterize the amino acid residues of N-term EF-3 involved in making contact with RNA.Previously, Kovalchuke and Chakraburtty (17Kovalchuke O. Chakraburtty K. Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 32: 336-342PubMed Google Scholar) reported an interaction between EF-3 and polynucleotides, with preferential binding to poly(G). While they showed that both 18 S and 26 S rRNA could effectively inhibit activation of EF-3 ATPase by yeast ribosomes, they did not examine whether EF-3 could interact directly with either of these RNAs in an isolated system. The results of our RNA-binding experiments demonstrate a physical interaction between N-term EF-3 and 18 S rRNA that is specific. While we did not examine the binding of N-term EF-3 to 26 S rRNA, it is possible that different domains of EF-3 are required for contacting different regions of the ribosome (see below).Because the C terminus of EF-3 is very basic and contains three clusters of lysine residues, it has been speculated that EF-3 may interact with yeast ribosomes via this region. In support of this, Uritani et al. (18Uritani M. Tabata A. Nakayama K. Izuta M. Iizumi M. Arisawa M. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 39: 227-234PubMed Google Scholar) reported that a monoclonal antibody specific for the C-terminal region of EF-3 inhibits its ribosome-dependent ATPase activity. Other work has reported that a GST-fusion protein containing the C-terminal domain of EF-3 remains associated with yeast ribosomes, suggesting that least one of the ribosome-binding sites of EF-3 resides within this region (19Kambampati R. Chakraburtty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6377-6381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Our observations that the N-terminal domain of EF-3 binds 18 S rRNA and also associates with ribosomes do not necessarily conflict with the results described above with the C-terminal domain. The two results can be easily reconciled by taking into account the fact that multiple contacts may exist between EF-3 and ribosomes or rRNA. It may be possible that some regions of EF-3 (like the N terminus) may interact directly with rRNA, while other domains are responsible for making protein-protein contacts. Further dissection of the putative protein and RNA-binding domains of EF-3 will help to elucidate the complex nature of the interactions described above, and may provide additional information regarding the functions of EF-3 in fungal translation.

Hepatic clearance of these so-called portomicrons must be rapid, but the protein(s) mediating their catabolism, presumably analogues of the 36-kDa mammalian apolipoprotein E, have not been identified. In searching for such a mediator(s), we have isolated a hitherto unknown 38-kDa protein from chicken serum, which we identified by microsequencing and molecular cloning as a counterpart to mammalian apolipoprotein AIV (apoAIV). Mature chicken apoAIV consists of 347 amino acids, lacks cysteine residues, and displays 57% sequence identity with human apoAIV and, to a significantly lesser extent, with apoAIVs of rodents. This first nonmammalian apoAIV characterized is the smallest homologue reported so far, because of the lack of repeated motifs at the carboxyl terminus with the consensus sequence Glu-Gln-Glu/Ala-Gln, a hallmark of mammalian apoAIVs. Chicken apoAIV (isoelectric point, 4.65) is also considerably more acidic than its human counterpart. Agarose gel electrophoresis revealed that unlike human apoAIV, which migrates to a pre-α-position, chicken apoAIV shows fast α migration. Functional characterization demonstrated that the avian protein is able to activate the enzyme lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase. Roosters and hens express apoAIV predominantly in the gut, one-fifth as much in the liver, and no other sites of expression are identifiable by Northern blot analysis. Although pronounced intestinal synthesis is common to apoAIVs, the features of the avian protein support the notion that it represents a prototype of an apoprotein that evolved to acquire possibly distinct functions in mammals and birds.

Key molecules of lipoprotein metabolism in birds and mammals display many common features but also differ in several aspects. For instance, apolipoprotein (apo) 1The abbreviations used are: apo, apolipoprotein; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein; LDL, low density lipoprotein; HDL, high density lipoprotein; LCAT, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.43); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s). 1The abbreviations used are: apo, apolipoprotein; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein; LDL, low density lipoprotein; HDL, high density lipoprotein; LCAT, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.43); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s).

However, whereas mammalian plasma apoB exists in two forms, apoB-48 and apoB-100 (4Kane J.P. Hardman D.A. Paulus H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2465-2469Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 5Krishnaiah K.V. Walker L.F. Borensztajn J. Schonfeld G. Getz G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Navaratnam N. Bhattacharya S. Morrison J.R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This process is not observed in the chicken (10Teng B. Davidson N.O. J.

A further difference concerns the metabolism of intestinally derived lipoproteins in birds; they are not delivered to the lymphatic system but rather are thought to be secreted into the portal vein as so-called, yet to be isolated, portomicrons (16Bensadoun A. Rothfeld A. Soc. Proc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1972; 41: 814-817Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar), which are subject to subsequent rapid uptake by the liver. Separation of chicken plasma lipoproteins has been performed by sequential ultracentrifugation (2Barakat H.A. St. Clair R. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 1252-1268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), by conventional density gradient ultracentrifugation (1Hermier D. Forgez P. Chapman M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 836: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), or by a faster vertical spin technique (17Brown E.M. Dower H.J. J. Chromatogr. 1990; 512: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar); however, a separate portomicron entity has not been identified during the characterization of isolated lipoprotein fractions. This could be due to a lack of circulating portomicrons in peripheral blood or from difficulties in separating portomicrons from hepatically derived VLDL, as both particles are likely to carry apoB-100 in view of the absence of apoB editing in the chicken (10Teng B. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21265-21272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, the mediator(s) of hepatic clearance of portomicrons has not been identified, but candidates for receptor binding are apoB-100, lipoprotein lipase, and/or as yet unknown proteins (18Beisiegel U. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1995; 6: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition to apoB-100, mammalian apoE was found to be an in vitro ligand for the chicken homologues of the mammalian LDL receptor gene family (13Steyrer E. Barber D.L. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19575-19581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Bujo H. Hermann M. Kaderli M.O. Jacobsen L. Sugawara S. Nimpf J. Yamamoto T. Schneider W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5163-5175Crossref Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Importantly, however, synthesis of apoE in chicken has not been demonstrated to date (1Hermier D. Forgez P. Chapman M.J. Biochim.

Chem. 1987; 262: 7058-7065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), prompting us to investigate further the possibility of expression of an avian apoE or surrogate protein(s). Recently, a sea lion apolipoprotein with a molecular mass of 36,053 Da has been identified as apoE (21Davis R.W. Pierotti V.R. Lauer S.J. Hubl S.T. McLean J.W. Witztum J.L. Young G. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 1013-1023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This protein is 12 residues longer than its human counterpart and thus represents the largest apoE molecule identified so far. In our search for hitherto unidentified chicken apolipoproteins, we discovered and purified an apoprotein with an apparent molecular mass of ∼38,000 Da, reminiscent of apoE in the sea lion. However, as reported here, N-terminal sequencing of the protein revealed high homology to mammalian apoAIV (22Karathanasis S.K. Yunis I. Zannis V.I.

Molecular cloning of the corresponding cDNA and characterization of the protein indeed demonstrates for the first time that apoAIV expression is not limited to mammals. White leghorn laying hens and roosters were obtained from Heindl (Vienna, Austria) and maintained as described previously (28George R. Barber D.L. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16838-16847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Adult female New Zealand White rabbits were used for raising antibodies. Blood (10 ml) was drawn from the wing veins of laying hens and mature roosters into tubes containing 1 mg/ml EDTA, placed on ice, and plasma was separated by low speed centrifugation (3000 ×g) for 20 min at 4 °C. Plasma was adjusted to a density of 1.063 g/ml by adding solid KBr, and the lipoproteins were floated by centrifugation in a TLA 120.2 rotor at 120,000 rpm for 1 h 40 min (29Pietzsch J. Subat S. Nitzsche S. Leonhardt W. Schentke K.-U. Hanefeld M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1254: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) using a Beckman Optima TLX ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments). The d < 1.063 lipoproteins were recovered with a syringe, dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, and delipidated in ether/ethanol (1:3, v/v) at −20 °C. The 38-kDa apoprotein was purified from the d < 1.063 lipoprotein fraction by preparation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Although the isolation from this fraction was highly reproducible, subsequent Western blotting analysis (see below) revealed that more than 80% of the 38-kDa apoprotein resided in the d > 1.063 lipoprotein fraction. Rabbit antibodies were obtained by intracutaneous injection of 200 μg of the protein mixed with complete Freund's adjuvant followed by injections of 200 μg of protein each mixed with Freund's incomplete adjuvant 3, 6, and 8 weeks later. Antisera were tested by Western blotting using preimmune serum as control. Human apoAI and apoAIV were isolated as described (30Steinmetz A. Utermann G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2258-2264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 38-kDa apolipoprotein was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P, 0.45 μm, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Microsequencing of the protein was carried out essentially as described (31Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze the apoprotein content of plasma lipoprotein fractions, 200 μl of plasma were separated on a Superose-12 column (1 × 30 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) operated at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml EDTA, pH 7.4. The positions of lipoproteins in the eluted fractions were determined by cholesterol measurement (Boehringer Mannheim). Aliquots of the fractions were separated by electrophoresis on 4–20% SDS gradient polyacrylamide gels, and apoproteins AI, B, and the 38 kDa-apoprotein were identified by Western blotting with specific antibodies. Lipoprotein fractions containing apoAI or the 38-kDa apoprotein were immunoprecipitated. To aliquots of the fractions were added equal volumes of immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.4), and incubation with the respective antisera at a dilution of 1:60 and protein A-Sepharose beads was carried out for 16 h at 4 °C. The protein A-Sepharose beads were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. The beads were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer containing 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, and the precipitated proteins were eluted by heating to 95 °C for 5 min and subjected to electrophoresis on 4–20% SDS gradient polyacrylamide gels. Chicken and human lipoproteins were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and crossed immunoelectrophoresis was performed using antibodies to human apoAIV (32Steinmetz A. Czekelius P. Thiemann E. Motzny S. Kaffarnik H. Atherosclerosis. 1988; 69: 21-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and to the chicken 38-kDa protein, respectively. Apolipoproteins were analyzed by isoelectric focusing in 6 m urea-containing gels with the PhastSystem essentially as described (33Schäfer J.R. Hackler R. Brand S. Schwarz S. Kleine T.O. Steinmetz A Clin. Chem. 1995; 41: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Plasma was diluted 50-fold and 1 μl was applied close to the cathode. Isoelectric focusing was performed with a gel containing only one sample lane at one side to determine the position of the protein. Immediately after isoelectric focusing, the lane containing the sample was cut off and subjected to Western blotting. The remaining gel was cut into 2-mm strips of approximately 25 μl volume. Strips were incubated overnight at 20 °C in plastic tubes containing 1.4 ml of distilled water and the resulting pH was measured (34Hackler R. Arndt T. Kleine T.O. Gressner A.M. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 230: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The position of the protein was then localized within the established pH gradient and assigned an isoelectric point. Delipidated apolipoproteins or aliquots of column fractions were separated on 4–20% SDS gradient polyacrylamide gels (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205496) Google Scholar) and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose (36Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (44642) Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 5% powdered milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, incubated with antiserum (diluted 1:1000), developed with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence method (37Vieira A.V. Elkin R.G. Kuchler K. Celis H. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, New York1994: 314-321Google Scholar). LCAT was isolated from human plasma by a combination of ultracentrifugation, affinity chromatography on blue Sepharose, ion exchange chromatography, and hydroxyapatite chromatography as described (38Steinmetz A. Kaffarnik H. Utermann G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 152: 747-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Chicken LCAT was isolated from 200 ml of pooled plasma essentially as described (39Hengstschläger-Ottnad E. Kuchler K. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26139-26145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. After ultracentrifugation at a buoyant density of 1.21 g/ml, the clear middle fractions were recovered from the tubes, dialyzed against 0.5 m NaCl, applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column (2.6 × 12 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer, and eluted with deionized water. LCAT activity was determined by incubating aliquots of the eluted fractions with artificial substrate complexes containing human apoAI-egg yolk lecithin-14C-cholesterol. Fractions containing LCAT activity were pooled, and purification of the enzyme was continued by DEAE-Sephacel and hydroxyapatite chromatography as described for human LCAT (38Steinmetz A. Kaffarnik H. Utermann G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 152: 747-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Apolipoprotein-phospholipid (egg yolk lecithin orl-α-phosphatidylcholine-β-palmitoyl-γ-oleoyl)-14C-cholesterol complexes as substrates for LCAT were prepared by the cholate dialysis procedure (40Chen C.H. Albers J.J. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 680-691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at a molar ratio of phospholipid/apoprotein of 150:1. The assays were performed by incubating the substrate complexes with purified enzyme as described (38Steinmetz A. Kaffarnik H. Utermann G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 152: 747-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). At various time points the amount of cholesteryl ester formed was determined in aliquots of the incubation mixture, and the formation of cholesteryl esters was found to be linear for at least 2 h. As human apolipoprotein AI serves as a cofactor for chicken LCAT as well (39Hengstschläger-Ottnad E. Kuchler K. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26139-26145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), this apoprotein, complexed to egg yolk lecithin, was used as an internal standard. The reactivity of each set of substrates with a given LCAT preparation was expressed relative to the reactivity with human apoAI-egg yolk lecithin complexes (100%). All determinations were performed in duplicate, and zero time blanks were subtracted. Total RNA was prepared by the Trisolve method (Biotecx), and poly(A)+ RNA was prepared by passing 1 mg of total RNA twice over an oligo(dT) column. First-strand cDNA was prepared by mixing 3 μg of poly(A)+ RNA with 0.2 nmol of a random hexamer (Boehringer Mannheim) in a total volume of 10 μl and heating for 10 min at 75 °C. After quick chilling, 0.5 mmol each of dNTPs and 200 units of SuperscriptTM II (Moloney murine leukemia virus RNase H-reverse transcriptase from Life Technologies, Inc.) were added, and DNA synthesis was allowed in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 37.5 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, pH 8.3, in a total volume of 25 μl for 2 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by heating to 95 °C for 5 min. PCR amplification was carried out in 100 μl final volume of the following reaction mixture: 2 μl of the cDNA solution, 500 pmol of each degenerated primer (see below), 200 μmol each of the dideoxynucleotides (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 50 mm KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 5 units of Taqpolymerase (Promega). The reaction conditions were as follows: 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, 1 min at 72 °C, 30 cycles in a Perkin-Elmer 480 DNA Thermal Cycler. PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel (SeaKem GTGTM, FMC Bioproducts) and purified using a Qiaex II gel extraction kit (Qiagen), subcloned into the pGEM-TTM vector (Promega) and transformed into Epurian Coli XL1-BlueTM Subcloning-Grade Competent Cells (Stratagene). Plasmid DNA samples were sequenced using [35S]dATP (NEN Life Science Products), T7, and SP6 primers and a Sequenase Version 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). For cDNA cloning, we screened a chicken liver λgt11 cDNA library (CLONTECH) in duplicate with a specific32P-labeled 190-bp PCR fragment (see under “Results”) under the following conditions: 2× SSC, 10× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Filters were washed in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Inserts from three strongly hybridizing phages were subcloned into pBluescript II SK+ vectors and sequenced. Total RNAs (15 μg each) from different homogenized organs (intestinal epithelium was scraped off the submucosal layers with a scalpel before isolation of RNA) were denatured in 1 m deionized glyoxal, 48% dimethyl sulfoxide, and 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, for 1 h at 50 °C and separated on a 1.2% agarose gel in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. After transfer to Hybond N membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), RNA was immobilized by UV cross-linking and filters were hybridized with a specific32P-labeled 190-bp PCR fragment (see under “Results”) in 1% BSA, 7% SDS, 0.5 m sodium phosphate buffer, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.8, for 15 h at 65 °C. After washing at 65 °C, autoradiography was carried out at −75 °C overnight. Before rehybridization with a labeled 1300-bp cDNA fragment of rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase for control, the blots were stripped by incubating the membranes three times (10 min each) in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 95 °C. Autoradiograms were scanned using a laser densitometer (ImageQuant Densitometer, Molecular Dynamics). Preparation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the proteins present in the d < 1.063 g/ml lipoprotein fraction resulted in the isolation of a hitherto unknown apolipoprotein. The relative mobility of this protein on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, corresponding to an apparent M r of 38,000, did not change whether or not the reducing agent dithiothreitol was added (Fig. 1). By microsequencing of the 38-kDa protein, we determined an amino-terminal sequence of Asp-Val-Ser-Pro-Asp-Gln-Val-Ala-Thr-Val-Leu-Trp-Arg-Tyr-Phe and partial sequences of two tryptic peptides, Leu-Val-Pro-Phe-Ala-Thr-Glu-Leu-Gln-Ala-Gln-Leu-Val-Gln-Asp-Ser-Gln-Arg-Leu (peptide I), and Leu-Gln-Asp-Asn-Ala-Asp-Ser-Ile-Gln-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly-Pro-Tyr-Ala-Glu-Arg (peptide II), respectively. All three of these sequences were highly homologous to apoAIV of human (22Karathanasis S.K. Yunis I. Zannis V.I. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3962-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and monkey (25Hixson J.E. Kammerer C.M. Mott G.E. Britten M.L. Birnbaum S. Powers P.K. VandeBerg J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15667-15673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Osada J. Pocovı́ M. Nicolosi R.J. Schaefer E.J. Ordovás J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1172: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and to a lesser degree to apoAIV of mouse and rat. Based on this information, we designed a pair of degenerated primers, 5′-CCYGAYCARGTSGCHACHGT-3′ (A) and 5′-YTCVGTRGCRAADGGVAC-3′ (B) (IUPAC ambiguity code) for PCR amplification of cDNA. With this primer pair, a 190-bp PCR product was obtained by amplification of chicken liver cDNA. Sequencing of the PCR fragment again revealed high nucleotide sequence homology to that of mammalian apoAIVs. Furthermore, the 190-bp fragment encoded an open reading frame which included both peptide sequences used to design the primer pair and overall was highly homologous to known apoAIV sequences. Thus, the PCR fragment most likely represented a newly found avian homologue of apoAIV, prompting us to clone the corresponding full-length cDNA. In preliminary Northern blot experiments, we had identified liver and intestine as organs expressing the highest levels of the specific transcript. Therefore, a chicken liver λgt11 cDNA library was screened with the PCR-amplified and labeled 190-bp cDNA fragment. The inserts of three positive clones were isolated and subcloned into pBluescript II SK+. We sequenced the largest (1236 bp) insert on both strands, a 1204-bp insert on one strand, and of the third insert, over 420 nucleotides each from both the T3 and T7 promoters of the vector. All of the sequences matched and confirmed that obtained from the 1236-bp insert, which also contained the sequence of the above described 190-bp PCR fragment. The nucleotide and derived amino acid sequences are shown in Fig. 2. The novel cDNA contains an open reading frame of 1098 bp following a 37-bp 5′-untranslated region. A single ATG (for methionine) codon is followed by a stretch of hydrophobic amino acid residues with a consensus signal sequence cleavage site (41von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar) 19 residues downstream. The mature protein is predicted to contain 347 amino acids with a molecular mass of 38,975 Da. Sequence similarity is highest to human apoAIV at both the nucleotide (66% identity) and protein levels (57% identity) and lower to monkey, rat, and mouse apoAIVs. Over the entire length of human apoE (317 residues), the chicken apoprotein displayed 45% similarity and 23% amino acid identity, respectively. However, as discussed below, the carboxyl-terminal glutaminyl- and glutamyl-rich stretch found in mammalian apoAIVs appears diminished or lacking; thus, chicken apoAIV represents the smallest homologue identified to date (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, the protein ends with the same two residues, Glu-Ser, as the mammalian counterparts. The 3′-untranslated region of the cDNA contained a polyadenylation signal (AATAAA); a poly(A) tail was not present in our clone. The calculated molecular mass of mature chicken AIV is in good agreement with the apparent molecular mass of the plasma protein of ∼38 kDa upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1). Thus, the protein does not seem to be significantly glycosylated. Indeed, no potential N-glycosylation sites (NXS/T) could be identified. We noticed a four-amino-acid insert, Glu-Arg-Leu-Ala, at positions 297–300 of the chicken protein, as compared with the human sequence (Fig. 3) and to the sequences of monkey, rat, and mouse apoAIV, respectively (data not shown). A hallmark of exchangeable apolipoproteins is the presence of 11-residue-long amino acid repeats that have evolved into multiple 22-mer tandem repeat units exhibiting the periodicity of an amphipathic α-helix (42Segrest J.P.

Many of the repeats have proline residues as the first amino acid, and indeed, most proline residues (10 of 11) in the newly discovered chicken protein are in positions corresponding to multiples of 11-mers, i.e. in the following positions (numbering in the mature protein), with spacing in parentheses: 62, (33Schäfer J.R.

Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3962-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), 293 (Fig. 2). This characteristic feature of the primary structure is in strong agreement with the prediction that the newly identified chicken protein is indeed a functional exchangeable apolipoprotein. The C-terminal regions of apoAIVs are of particular interest. Namely, the mammalian proteins possess hydrophilic extensions with a high density of glutamyl and glutaminyl residues,"
https://openalex.org/W1991262745,"Ras proteins possess multiple downstream effectors of distinct structures. We and others demonstrated that Ha-Ras carrying certain effector region mutations could interact differentially with its effectors, implying that significant differences exist in their Ras recognition mechanisms. Here, by employing the fluorescence polarization method, we measured the activity of effector region synthetic peptides bearing various amino acid substitutions to inhibit association of Ras with the effectors human Raf-1 and Schizosaccharomyces pombe Byr2. The effect of these peptides on association with another effector Saccharomyces cerevisiae adenylyl cyclase was also examined by measuring inhibition of the Ras-dependent adenylyl cyclase activity. The peptide corresponding to the residues 17–44 competitively inhibited Ras association with all the three effectors at the K i values of 1∼10 μm, and the inhibition was considerably attenuated by the D38A mutation. The peptide with the D38N mutation inhibited association of Ha-Ras with Byr2 but not with the others, whereas that with the P34G mutation inhibited association of Ha-Ras with Raf-1 and Byr2 but not with adenylyl cyclase. Thus, the specificity observed with the whole Ras protein was retained in the effector region peptide. These results suggest that the effector region residues constitute a major determinant for differential recognition of the effector molecules, raising a possibility for selective inhibition of a particular Ras function.

The ras genes are widely conserved from yeasts to mammals. Their protein products belong to a family of small guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that operate in key processes of intracellular signal transduction systems regulating cell growth and differentiation. In higher eukaryotes including vertebrates, Ras proteins bind directly and activate Raf (Raf-1, A-Raf, and B-Raf) proteins, which results in activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation cascade (for reviews, see Refs. 1Avruch J. Zhang X.-F. Kyriakis J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 279-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar and 2Daum G. Eisenmann-Tappe I. Fries H.-W. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R.

In addition, other mammalian proteins have been shown to associate directly with Ras in a GTP-dependent manner. These include Ral-guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator (3Kikuchi A. Demo S.D.

Biol. 1995; 15: 1518-1523Google Scholar). However, the significance of their interaction with Ras is presently unclear. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, its single Ras homologue, Ras1, is involved in signal transduction from mating pheromone receptors, and protein kinase Byr2 is its direct downstream effector (10Wang Y. Xu H.-P. Riggs M. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3554-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 11Masuda T. Kariya K. Shinkai M. Okada T. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1979-1982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, adenylyl cyclase is an immediate downstream effector of a pair of Ras proteins, Ras1 and Ras2 (for a review, see Ref. 12Gibbs J.B. Marshall M. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 171-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutational studies of the effector molecules identified discrete Ras binding regions. The Ras binding site of mammalian Raf-1 was mapped to an 81-amino acid segment in its N-terminal regulatory domain (13Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A.

In yeast adenylyl cyclase, the leucine-rich-repeat domain, which is composed of tandemly repeated 23-amino acid leucine-rich motifs (18Kataoka T. Broek D. Wigler M.

Comparison of the primary structures of these Ras binding domains revealed very little conservation among them except that those of Ral-guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator, AF-6, and Rin1 share a weakly homologous region called RA domain (20Ponting C.P. Benjamin D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 422-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). However, recent studies on the Ras binding regions of Raf-1 and Ral-guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator revealed that they exhibit similar three-dimensional structures (21Nassar N. Horn G.

On the other hand, extensive mutational studies on Ras identified amino acid residues whose substitution abolished the ability to transform NIH3T3 cells, to induce neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells, to induce germinal vesicle breakdown in Xenopus laevis oocytes, or to associate with Raf-1 without affecting the guanine nucleotide binding properties (24Sigal I.S.

These residues were concentrated in the positions 32–40 of mammalian Ras, so that this region was designated the effector region. This region almost matches with “switch I,” one of the two regions that take significantly different conformations between the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of Ras (32Milburn M.V. Tong L. deVos A.M.

In addition, the residues 26–31 and 42–53 flanking the effector region were shown to be critical for effector activation even though they do not change their conformations upon GDP/GTP exchange (30Shirouzu M.

Specifically, more than 50 Ha-Ras mutants were examined by us for interaction with Raf-1, Byr2, and yeast adenylyl cyclase, the three effectors whose functions are firmly established by both genetic and biochemical evidences (36Akasaka K.

We found that the D38N mutant lost the ability to associate with both Raf-1 and adenylyl cyclase while retaining the activity to associate with and activate Byr2. Also, the P34G mutation selectively abolished the ability of Ha-Ras to bind and activate adenylyl cyclase without affecting the interaction with Raf-1 and Byr2, suggesting that significant differences exist in the recognition mechanisms by which distinct effector molecules associate with Ras (36Akasaka K.

These observations opened up a possibility for selective inhibition of the function of a particular effector by exploiting the differences in the Ras recognition mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that short synthetic peptides corresponding to the effector region can be employed for this purpose by showing that they retain the ability to differentially recognize the effectors. Synthetic peptides used in this experiment are shown in Table I.

The fluorescein-labeled Ha-Ras (*F-Ha-Ras) was separated from the unincorporated dye by gel filtration chromatography on Sephadex G-25. One microliter of *F-Ha-Ras (about 105 fluorescence units or 8 fmol/reaction) loaded with GTPγS or GDPβS was mixed with 1 ml of buffer A containing various concentrations of the purified MBP-Raf-1-(1–206) or GST-Byr2-(1–236) in a siliconized glass tube. The reaction mixture was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C in the darkness followed by measurement of the fluorescence polarization value of each tube with BEACON (Pan Vera Co.) at an excitation wavelength of 490 nm and an emission wavelength of 520 nm. For assay of inhibition by the synthetic peptides, similar measurements were performed with 100 nm MBP-Raf-1-(1–206) or GST-Byr2-(1–236) in the presence of varying concentrations of the synthetic peptides. A fluorescence polarization value is given by a difference between the vertical and horizontal fluorescence intensities divided by a sum of the vertical and horizontal fluorescence intensities and expressed as mP units (42Perrin F. J. Phys. Radium. 1926; 7: 390-401Crossref Google Scholar, 43Checovich W.J. Bolger R.E. Burke T. Nature. 1995; 375: 254-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). It reflects the molecular size of a fluorescently labeled molecule (42Perrin F. J. Phys. Radium. 1926; 7: 390-401Crossref Google Scholar, 44Weber G. Adv. Protein Chem. 1953; 8: 415-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 45Maeda H. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 92: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). There occurs a large increase in the molecular size of *F-Ha-Ras upon complex formation with the effector proteins, causing an increase in the fluorescence polarization value. Thus, the change in fluorescence polarization of *F-Ha-Ras is proportional to the amount of the complex formed with the effector molecule. Adenylyl cyclase was solubilized from the crude membrane fraction of the yeast FS3–1 carrying pAD4-GST-CYR1-(606–2026) and YEP-HIS3-ADC1-CAP with buffer C (50 mm Mes (pH 6.2), 0.1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 1% LubrolPX, 0.6 m NaCl, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C, the resulting supernatant was used for the measurement of adenylyl cyclase activity in the presence of varying concentrations of the GTPγS-bound form of posttranslationally fully modified Ha-Ras as described before (19Minato T. Wang J. Akasaka K. Okada T. Suzuki N. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20845-20851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Shima F. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Yanagihara Y. Tamada M. Okada Y. Kariya K. Kataoka T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1057-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For the measurement of inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activities by the synthetic peptides, varying amounts of the peptides were added to the reaction mixtures before commencing the reaction. We employed the fluorescence polarization method to quantitatively analyze the association of Ha-Ras with its various effectors. The change in fluorescence polarization value of *F-Ha-Ras is proportional to the amount of a complex formed with its effector molecule. In this experiment, *F-Ha-Ras was loaded with GTPγS or GDPβS and examined for association with various concentrations of MBP-Raf-1-(1–206) (Fig. 1 A) or GST-Byr2-(1–236) (Fig. 1 B). *F-Ha-Ras alone exhibited an mP value of approximately 100, and the complex formation of *F-Ha-Ras with the effector polypeptides was detectable at the effector concentration as low as 10 nm. The binding was almost saturated at 100 nm for MBP-Raf-1-(1–206) or at 500 nm for GST-Byr2-(1–236) with the increase of the mP value by approximately 30 units. The extent of increase was consistent with that predicted from the increase in molecular size upon the complex formation with the effector polypeptides based on the observation that the reciprocals of the mP values correlate linearly with the reciprocal values of the molecular weights of the fluorescently labeled proteins (44Weber G. Adv. Protein Chem. 1953; 8: 415-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 45Maeda H. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 92: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This suggested that the binding reactions occurred stoichiometrically. The maximal bindings were reached within 10 min of incubation, and the values remained stable for the following 30 min (data not shown). The binding reactions were dependent on the GTP-bound configuration of *F-Ha-Ras, and almost no binding was observed for MBP or GST only (Fig. 1, A and B). Since the *F-Ha-Ras concentration used was very low at 8 pm, essentially all of MBP-Raf-1-(1–206) or GST-Byr2-(1–236) added to the reactions could be regarded as in a free form. When reciprocals of the fluorescence polarization increase values were plotted against reciprocals of the effector concentrations, a straight line could be drawn with an intersect with the horizontal axis giving K d values of 35 nm for MBP-Raf-1-(1–206) and 90 nm for GST-Byr2-(1–236) (Fig. 1 C). These values are comparable although somewhat higher than those estimated from the inhibition profiles of Ras-dependent adenylyl cyclase activity by the same effector fragments (11Masuda T. Kariya K. Shinkai M. Okada T. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1979-1982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 19Minato T. Wang J. Akasaka K. Okada T. Suzuki N. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20845-20851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We next examined the ability of synthetic peptides encompassing the Ha-Ras effector region with various single amino acid substitutions (Table I) to interfere with the Ha-Ras-Raf-1 and Ha-Ras-Byr2 associations. The peptide corresponding to the residues 17–44 was chosen because this peptide had been used successfully in inhibition of the Ras binding to Raf-1 or to protein kinase Cζ (7Diaz-Meco M.T. Lozano J. Municio M.M. Berra E. Frutos S. Sanz L. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31706-31710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Warne P.H. Viciana P.R. Downward J. Nature. 1993; 364: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). In addition, similar experiments were carried out with synthetic peptides SII and AD, corresponding to the switch II region (residues 58–76) of Ha-Ras and to a part of the activator region (residues 39–51), respectively (Table I). Fig. 2 shows inhibition profiles of the association of *F-Ha-Ras with MBP-Raf-1-(1–206) (Fig. 2 A) or with GST-Byr2-(1–236) (Fig. 2 B) by increasing concentrations of the various peptides. Wild-type effector region peptide effectively inhibited the Ras association with both of the effectors with 70% inhibition for Raf-1 and 55% inhibition for Byr2 at the concentration of 10 μm, whereas that carrying the D38A mutation was much less effective. In addition, the specificities of inhibition by the various peptides were clearly different between the two effectors. Although P34G substitution did not notably affect the inhibitory activity of the peptide against both Raf-1 and Byr2, D38N substitution selectively impaired the inhibitory activity against complex formation of *F-Ha-Ras with Raf-1-(1–206) but not with Byr2-(1–236). Both SII and AD peptides had no inhibitory effect up to the concentration of 10 μm. Kinetic analyses of the inhibition patterns were carried out as follows to determine K d values of each peptide for the two effectors. The fluorescence polarization value (Y) is proportional to the amount of *F-Ha-Ras bound to the effector and hence formulated as Y = Y max ·X/(K Ras + X), where Y max, X, and K Ras represent the maximal polarization value, the effector concentration, and the K d value of *F-Ha-Ras for the effector, respectively. Assuming that the association with *F-Ha-Ras is competitively inhibited by a peptide whose concentration (P) is in a vast excess over X, the concentration of the effector sequestered by the peptide is X · P/(K p + P), where K p represents the K d value of the peptide for the effector. Thus, the free effector concentration available for association with *F-Ha-Ras is given by X · (1 −P/(K p + P)). The fluorescence polarization value (Y p) in the presence of the peptide (P) can be formulated as Y p = Y max · X· (1 − P/(K p +P))/(K Ras + X · (1 − P/(K p + P))). From the two equations is derived Y/Y p = (K Ras/K p · (K Ras + X)) · P + 1. When Y/Y p was plotted against P for inhibition by the various peptides of association with Raf-1 (Fig. 2 C) or with Byr2 (Fig. 2 D), a straight line can be drawn for either case that converged on the longitudinal axis at Y/Y p = 1. The K p value can be calculated as −K Ras ·P 0/(K Ras + X), where P 0 represents the P value at the intersect on the horizontal axis (Fig. 2, C and D). Thus, the K p values for MBP-Raf-1-(1–206) of wild-type, P34G, D38N, and D38A peptides were calculated as 2.1, 4.4, 28, and 28 μm, respectively, given that K Ras is 35 nm and X is 100 nm. Similarly, the K p values of the same set of peptides for GST-Byr2-(1–236) were calculated as 3.8, 2.0, 4.7, and 39 μm, respectively. The effects of the various synthetic peptides on association between Ha-Ras and yeast adenylyl cyclase were examined by measuring inhibition of Ha-Ras-dependent adenylyl cyclase activity (Fig. 3). Wild-type peptide inhibited adenylyl cyclase activity obtained by the 8 nm post-translationally modified form of Ha-Ras by a half at approximately 21 μm(Fig. 3 A). A notable difference from Raf-1 and Byr2 was observed in the effect of P34G substitution, which was found totally ineffective in inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity. Assuming that the inhibitory associations of the peptides are competitive with that of Ha-Ras, the inhibition constants (K i) for the peptides can be derived from a conventional equation V= V max ·X/(Km · (1 +I/K i) + X), where V, V max, X,Km, and I represent the adenylyl cyclase activity, the maximal adenylyl cyclase activity, the concentration of Ha-Ras, the K d value for Ha-Ras, and the inhibitor peptide concentration, respectively. Rearranging the equation according to Lineweaver and Burk gives 1/V = 1/V max + K m · (1 +I/K i)/V max ·X. Adenylyl cyclase activities dependent on various concentrations of Ha-Ras were subjected to inhibition by varying concentrations of the peptides, and a reciprocal of the activity was plotted against a reciprocal of the Ha-Ras concentration. This gave a series of straight lines that converged on the longitudinal axis for each concentration of the peptide, wild type (Fig. 3 B), D38N (Fig. 3 C), and D38A (Fig. 3 D), as predicted from the above equation. The intersect of each line on the horizontal axis corresponds to −1/K m · (1 + I/K i). Thus, K i for each peptide could be determined by plotting reciprocals of the intersect values against I (Fig. 3 E). The K i values could be estimated from intersects of the straight lines on the horizontal axis and was determined to be 10, 56, and 68 μm for wild-type, D38N, and D38A peptides, respectively. Synthetic peptides encompassing the Ras effector region, in particular the one corresponding to the residues 17–44, were used successfully to competitively inhibit association of Ras with its effector proteins including Raf-1 (46Warne P.H. Viciana P.R. Downward J. Nature. 1993; 364: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar) and the ζ isoform of protein kinase C (7Diaz-Meco M.T. Lozano J. Municio M.M. Berra E. Frutos S. Sanz L. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31706-31710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Contact epitope scanning using a series of smaller peptides suggested that many residues across the residues 17–51 may be involved in direct interaction with Raf-1 N-terminal fragment (47Barnard D. Diaz B. Hettich L. Chuang E. Zhang X.-F. Avruch J. Marshall M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1283-1290PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have shown for the first time that introduction of certain single amino acid substitutions can confer the ability to discriminate Ras effectors, human Raf-1, fission yeast Byr2, and budding yeast adenylyl cyclase upon the effector region peptide. The association of the wild type and its mutant peptides with the three effectors was quantitatively examined by measuring competitive inhibition of the binding of the effectors to Ha-Ras, which was monitored by the fluorescence polarization method (42Perrin F. J. Phys. Radium. 1926; 7: 390-401Crossref Google Scholar, 43Checovich W.J. Bolger R.E. Burke T. Nature. 1995; 375: 254-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 44Weber G. Adv. Protein Chem. 1953; 8: 415-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The use of this method enabled us to measure the equilibrium binding constants of the effector molecules for Ras in solution and to determine the K d values for association with the peptides from kinetic analyses of the inhibition profile. This is certainly advantageous over other nonequilibrium procedures such as an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and an affinity precipitation of the complex formed, both of which require the physical separation of free and bound ligands considering that the binding nature of Ras to Raf-1, for example, is substoichiometric and the dissociation rate is very high (48Gorman C. Skinner R.H. Skelly J.V. Neidle S. Lowe P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6713-6719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The results clearly demonstrated selectivity in binding of the peptides to the distinct effectors. Specifically, D38N substitution attenuated the affinity of the effector region peptide for both Raf-1 and adenylyl cyclase by about 10-fold without affecting that for Byr2. The importance of Asp-38 of Ras for interaction with Raf-1 had been indicated from extensive mutational and structural studies on the whole Ras protein and its homologue Rap1A (21Nassar N. Horn G.

In contrast, P34G substitution almost abolished the interaction with adenylyl cyclase but did not appreciably affect that with Raf-1 or Byr2. These specificities, summarized in Table II, are in good coincidence with those observed with the whole Ha-Ras protein (36Akasaka K. Tamada M. Wang F. Kariya K. Shima F. Kikuchi A. Yamamoto M.

The results strongly suggest that the effector region residues by themselves constitute a major determinant for differential recognition of the effector molecules, although we cannot exclude the possibility that residues outside of the effector region may contribute to this recognition process. Since other Ras effector molecules such as Ral-guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase were also known to possess distinct requirements for the effector region residues from Raf-1, Byr2, or adenylyl cyclase and from one another (37Khosravi-Far R.

Open table in a new tab Our results have also shown that it is possible to achieve selective inhibition of the association of Ras with a particular effector molecule without significantly affecting those with other effectors by employing the antagonist peptide with a relatively small molecular size around 3 kDa. This may open up a possibility to design a compound that mimics a specific conformation of the effector region peptide bearing the particular substitution, which is in theory deducible from the x-ray crystallographic or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic analysis. From a viewpoint of effectiveness in cancer drug therapy, it is possible that the effector-specific inhibition, which could potentially be achieved by administration of such a compound, is superior to the total inhibition of Ras functions by, for example, a compound that directly inactivates Ras. In addition, the effector region peptides carrying a series of substitutions might be found useful as effector-specific inhibitors for analysis of individual cellular functions of the distinct effector molecules.

https://openalex.org/W2005468624,"The baculovirus p35 protein is a potent inhibitor of programmed cell death induced by a variety of stimuli in insects, nematodes, and mammalian cell lines. The broad ability of p35 in preventing apoptosis has led us to investigate its effect on mouse embryo fibroblasts in vitro and in vivo. For this purpose, we have used R− cells (3T3-like fibroblasts derived from mouse embryos with a targeted disruption of the insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) genes) and R508 cells (derived from R− and with 15 × 103IGF-IRs per cell). Both cell lines grow normally in monolayer, but they do not form colonies in soft agar, and they are non-tumorigenic in nude mice. We show here that, in addition to its anti-apoptotic effect, p35 causes transformation of R508 cells, as evidenced by the following: 1) decreased growth factor requirements, 2) ability to form foci in monolayer and colonies in soft agar, and 3) ability to form tumors in nude mice. Since R− cells stably transfected with p35 do not transform, our observations suggest that in addition to its effect as an inhibitor of apoptosis, the baculovirus p35 protein has transforming potential that requires the presence of the IGF-IR. The possibility that these two properties could be separated was confirmed by demonstrating that R508 cells expressing another anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2, could not form tumors in nude mice. The baculovirus p35 protein is a potent inhibitor of programmed cell death induced by a variety of stimuli in insects, nematodes, and mammalian cell lines. The broad ability of p35 in preventing apoptosis has led us to investigate its effect on mouse embryo fibroblasts in vitro and in vivo. For this purpose, we have used R− cells (3T3-like fibroblasts derived from mouse embryos with a targeted disruption of the insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) genes) and R508 cells (derived from R− and with 15 × 103IGF-IRs per cell). Both cell lines grow normally in monolayer, but they do not form colonies in soft agar, and they are non-tumorigenic in nude mice. We show here that, in addition to its anti-apoptotic effect, p35 causes transformation of R508 cells, as evidenced by the following: 1) decreased growth factor requirements, 2) ability to form foci in monolayer and colonies in soft agar, and 3) ability to form tumors in nude mice.

The possibility that these two properties could be separated was confirmed by demonstrating that R508 cells expressing another anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2, could not form tumors in nude mice. The baculovirus gene product p35 is a potent suppressor of programmed cell death induced by different stimuli in insects, nematodes, and mammalian cell lines (1Clem R.J. Fechheimer M. Miller L.K.

The broad ability of p35 to block apoptosis induced by different signals in diverse organisms is generally considered to be due to inhibition of ICE, 1The abbreviations used are: ICE, interleukin-1β converting enzyme; IGF-IR, insulin-like growth factor I receptor; IGF-I, insulin-like growth factor I; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ICH-1, ICE homologue; poly-HEMA, poly-(2-hydroxyethylmethylacrylate).

Although the mechanisms by which the targeting of the IGF-IR results in apoptosis remain to be elucidated, several reports have shown that IGF-I protects cells from apoptosis through activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway (33Kauffman-Zeh A.

Yuan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5112-5117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). On this basis, we decided to investigate the relationship between these two anti-apoptotic proteins, p35 and the IGF-IR, using mouse embryo fibroblasts stably transfected with a plasmid coding for the baculovirus p35 protein derived from the Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (Refs. 3Herschberger P.A.

Neurochem. 1993; 61: 2318-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In this study, we evaluated the effects of the baculovirus p35 protein on mouse embryo fibroblasts in vitro and in vivo. We show that the expression of p35 in R508 cells, but not in R− cells, results in anchorage-independent growth. R508.p35 cells were able to form foci in monolayer and colonies in soft agar and to develop tumors in nude mice. In parallel experiments, R508 cells expressing another anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2, were not tumorigenic in nude mice, indicating that in mouse embryo fibroblasts transformation and protection from apoptosis can be separated. Our observations also indicate that, in addition to its effect as an inhibitor of apoptosis, the baculovirus p35 protein has a transforming potential that requires the presence of the IGF-IR. R− cells are cells derived from mouse embryos with a targeted disruption of the IGF-IR genes (14Liu J.P. Baker J. Perkins A.S. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1993; 75: 59-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar, 15Baker J. Liu J.P. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1993; 75: 73-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). These cells, totally devoid of IGF-IRs, have been previously characterized and described in detail (16Sell C. Rubini M. Rubin R. Liu J.P. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11217-11221Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 17Sell C. Dumenil G. Deveaud C. Miura M. Coppola D. De Angelis T. Rubin R. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3604-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). R508 cells are R− cells stably transfected with pMRIGFIR12 (39Rubini M. Hongo A. D'Ambrosio C. Baserga R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 230: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), a derivative of CVN-IGFIR that expresses both the hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene of Escherichia coli and the human IGF-IR cDNA under the control of the rat IGF-IR promoter. These cells have been previously characterized regarding the number of IGF-I binding sites, mitogenicity, and clonogenicity in soft agar (39Rubini M. Hongo A. D'Ambrosio C. Baserga R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 230: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The plasmid pPRM-35KORF coding for the p35 protein derived from the A. californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (3Herschberger P.A. LaCount D.J. Friesen P.D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3467-3477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was subcloned into the BamHI site of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA (Invitrogen), as described previously (9Robertson N.M. Zangrilli J. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Friesen P.D. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 43-47PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid encoding for human wild-type Bcl-2 subcloned in pcDNA was a kind gift of Dr. S. Haldar (Thomas Jefferson University). R− and R508 cells were co-transfected with the plasmids encoding for p35, or Bcl-2, or the empty vector and a plasmid (pPDV6+) coding for the puromycin resistance gene (40Vara J.A. Portela A. Jimenez A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4617-4624Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Puromycin-resistant clones, selected in medium containing 2.5 μg/ml puromycin, were screened by Western blot analysis for expression of the baculovirus p35 protein (using a rabbit antiserum anti-p35, as described in Ref. 3Herschberger P.A. LaCount D.J. Friesen P.D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3467-3477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or of human Bcl-2 (using a monoclonal antibody anti-human Bcl-2 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Proteins from cell lysates (20 μg) were separated in a 4–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. After transfer, the filters were blocked for 1 h with 10% non-fat milk in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with the rabbit antiserum anti-p35 (1/5000) for 1 h at room temperature followed by a 1-h incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1/3000). Detection was performed using the ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Detection of human Bcl-2 was performed using a monoclonal antibody anti-human Bcl-2 followed by incubation with a goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and the ECL reagent, as described above. The cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 104 cells per 35-mm plate in DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 5% calf serum. After 6 h, the cells were carefully washed and transferred to serum-free medium (DMEM supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin fraction V (Sigma) and 0.1 μm ferrous sulfate). Two days later, the quiescent cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml IGF-I (Bachem), and the growth response was evaluated after 48 h by cell counting. For this assay, the cells were plated at a density of 4 × 103 cells/cm2. After 14 days, when the cells became confluent and began to form foci, the cultures were fixed in methanol containing 0.5% crystal violet stain, as described previously (17Sell C. Dumenil G. Deveaud C. Miura M. Coppola D. De Angelis T. Rubin R. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3604-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Anchorage-independent growth was determined by the ability of the cells to form colonies in soft agar. Clonogenicity in soft agar was assayed by scoring the number of colonies formed in medium (DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 5% calf serum) containing 0.2% agarose with a 0.4% agarose medium underlay. Cells were seeded at a density of 103 cells per 35-mm plate in duplicate. The number of colonies and their size were determined after 3 weeks. The cells (106 cells suspended in 0.1 ml of PBS, calcium- and magnesium-free) were injected subcutaneously above the hind leg of 7-week-old male Balb/c nude mice (Charles River Breeders). The animals were monitored daily for tumor development, and they were sacrificed following the development of bulky tumors. Three mice were used in each experimental condition. Petri dishes (Falcon) were coated with a film of poly-(2-hydroxyethylmethylacrylate) (poly-HEMA; Sigma), following the protocol reported by Folkman and Moscona (41Folkman J. Moscona A. Nature. 1978; 273: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at 105/ml. Cell number was determined after 24 h; the results are expressed as percentage recovery of surviving cells from initial seeding. The data represent the mean of three independent determinations, each performed in duplicate. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test. Mouse embryo fibroblasts (3T3-like cells), totally devoid of IGF-IRs (R− cells) or expressing 15 × 103 IGF-IRs per cell (R508 cells), were stably co-transfected with the plasmids encoding for p35 or the empty vector and the puromycin resistance gene, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Puromycin-resistant clones, selected in 2.5 μg/ml puromycin, were then screened for expression of p35 by Western blot analysis using a rabbit antiserum anti-p35 (3Herschberger P.A. LaCount D.J. Friesen P.D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3467-3477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression levels of p35 in representative clones of R− cells are shown in Fig. 1 A, whereas for clones of R508 cells, the results are shown in Fig. 1 B. R508 cells (untransfected or expressing the empty vector) are not able to grow in serum-free medium supplemented with 50 ng/ml IGF-I (Ref. 39Rubini M. Hongo A. D'Ambrosio C. Baserga R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 230: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar and TableI), although they remain viable under these conditions (Ref. 39Rubini M. Hongo A. D'Ambrosio C. Baserga R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 230: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar and see below). Expression of p35 resulted in growth in serum-free medium and increased mitogenic response to IGF-I stimulation (Table I).Table IGrowth characteristics of R− and R508 cells expressing p35Cell typeCell number (×10−4)SFMIGF-IR5083.3 ± 0.23.6 ± 0.3R508-Null-13.6 ± 0.23.7 ± 0.2R508–35-236.6 ± 0.18.0 ± 0.1R508–35-276.5 ± 0.18.5 ± 0.2R−2.2 ± 0.32.1 ± 0.2R− 35–393.3 ± 0.23.5 ± 0.2R− 35–473.2 ± 0.23.4 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab As expected, in R− clones expressing p35 no mitogenic response to IGF-I stimulation was observed (Table I). However, it is also interesting that these cells do not grow in serum-free medium, suggesting a requirement for a functional IGF-IR in the growth stimulation by p35. R508 cells are contact inhibited in monolayer, even in the presence of 10% serum (Ref. 39Rubini M. Hongo A. D'Ambrosio C. Baserga R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 230: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar and Fig. 2 A). R508 cells expressing the empty vector behaved as untransfected cells and were not able to form foci after 2 weeks in monolayer (Fig. 2 B). Expression of p35 resulted in formation of multiple and large foci (Fig. 2, Cand D). However, clones derived from R− cells, despite the high expression levels of p35, were not able to form foci in monolayer and remained contact inhibited as the controls (Fig. 2 G). This suggested that, in order to transform mouse embryo fibroblasts, the baculovirus p35 requires the presence of the IGF-IR, as reported for other cellular and viral oncogenes (see Introduction). These observations were confirmed by determining the ability of these cells to form colonies in soft agar. The ability of cells expressing p35 to grow under anchorage-independent conditions was evaluated by colony formation in soft agar. R508 cells, seeded at 103 cells per 35-mm plate, do not form colonies in soft agar (Ref. 39Rubini M. Hongo A. D'Ambrosio C. Baserga R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 230: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar and Table II). Clones expressing the empty vector behaved as untransfected R508 cells. Expression of p35 conferred clonogenic potential to R508 cells. The number of colonies and their size seemed to be dependent on the levels of expression of p35; clones expressing low levels of p35 were able to form an average of 4 ± 1 colonies of 25 μm in diameter, whereas clones expressing high levels of p35 formed an average of 22 ± 5 colonies, ranging from 60 to 100 μm in diameter (Table II and Fig. 3, C and D).Table IIAnchorage-independent growth of R508 cells expressing p35Cell typeClonogenicity in soft agarNo. of coloniesAverage sizeμmR5080; 0R508-Null-10; 0R508-Null-20; 0R508-p35–2320; 1880R508-p35–2722; 2480R508-p35–3021; 2780R508-p35–2413; 1650R508-p35–3216; 1050R508-p35–3612; 1450R508-p35–910; 1240R508-p35–109; 1140R508-p35–138; 940R508-p35–155; 425R508-p35–164; 325R508-p35–212; 425 Open table in a new tab The absence of the IGF-IR prevented the transforming potential of p35 in R− cells. Clones of R− cells expressing high levels of p35 were unable to form colonies in soft agar, although single cells remained viable for at least 3 weeks after seeding (Fig. 3 B). The ability to form tumors in nude mice is the most rigorous test for transformation of cells in culture. We therefore tested R508 cells expressing p35 for their ability to form tumors when injected subcutaneously in nude mice. R508 cells expressing p35 developed subcutaneous tumors, which became palpable 10 days after injection of 106 cells (Fig. 4 A). The controls receiving 106 R508 cells expressing the empty vector remained tumor-free for as long as followed (40 days, not shown). Similarly, R− cells stably transfected with p35 did not produce palpable tumors when injected into nude mice (not shown). We then asked whether transformation and protection from apoptosis were two aspects of the same phenomenon or whether they could be dissociated. To elucidate this, we decided to express another anti-apoptotic protein in R508 cells, such as Bcl-2, which is a potent inhibitor of apoptosis, and it is known to lack transforming ability (42Williams G.T. Cell. 1991; 65: 1097-1098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 43Korsmeyer S.J. Blood. 1992; 80: 879-886Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Nunez G. Clarke M.F.

A plasmid coding for human Bcl-2 was then co-transfected with a plasmid coding for the puromycin resistance gene, and puromycin-resistant clones were screened for Bcl-2 expression by Western blot. Clones expressing Bcl-2 were then tested for survival in poly-HEMA plates and tumorigenesis in nude mice. The results shown in Fig. 4 demonstrate that R508 cells expressing human wild-type Bcl-2, although fully protected from apoptosis (see Fig. 4, inset), do not form tumors in nude mice (Fig. 4 B). The novel finding in this report is that the baculovirus p35 protein, besides its well established ability to protect cells from apoptosis, has a previously unidentified property, which is its ability to induce a transformed phenotype in mouse fibroblasts. Our conclusion that p35 has transforming potential, above and beyond its anti-apoptotic activity, is supported by the following evidence: 1) R508 cells expressing p35 were able to grow in serum-free medium and in serum-free medium supplemented only with IGF-I (Table I), thus displaying reduced growth factor requirements; 2) they were able to form foci in monolayer (Fig. 2) and colonies in soft agar (Table II and Fig. 3, C and D); and 3) they developed tumors in nude mice (Fig. 4 A). None of these properties was shared by the parental cell line R508 or by cells expressing the empty vector. The transforming potential of p35 required the presence of the IGF-IR for p35 clones derived from R− cells remained contact inhibited when grown in monolayer, even in the presence of 10% serum (Fig. 2 G). Moreover, they were not able to grow under anchorage-independent conditions (Table II and Fig. 3 B) nor develop tumors in nude mice (data not shown). These observations are in agreement with previous reports showing that R− cells cannot be transformed by a variety of other viral oncogenes, such as SV40 large T antigen, an activated Ha-ras, or a combination of both (16Sell C. Rubini M. Rubin R. Liu J.P. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11217-11221Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 17Sell C. Dumenil G. Deveaud C. Miura M. Coppola D. De Angelis T. Rubin R. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3604-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), or by the E5 protein of the bovine papilloma virus (18Morrione A. DeAngelis T. Baserga R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5300-5303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or by an activated c-src (19Valentinis B. Morrione A. Taylor S. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3744-3754Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) all of which can readily transform cells with wild-type levels of IGF-IR. We believe that the transforming and anti-apoptotic activities of p35 can be dissociated for the following reasons: 1) R508 cells are not able to grow in serum-free medium supplemented solely with 50 ng/ml IGF-I (Ref. 39Rubini M. Hongo A. D'Ambrosio C. Baserga R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 230: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar and Table I), but they remain viable under these conditions and do not undergo apoptosis (Ref. 39Rubini M. Hongo A. D'Ambrosio C. Baserga R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 230: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar and data not shown). Expression of p35 allows R508 cells to respond to IGF-I stimulation (Table I), decreasing the requirements for growth factors (a characteristic of transformed cells), under conditions in which the parental cell line does not undergo apoptosis; 2) R508 cells expressing p35 are transformed, but R− cells expressing p35 are not (Figs. 2 and 3 B); and 3) most important, R508 cells expressing another anti-apoptotic protein, such as Bcl-2, are protected from apoptosis (Fig. 4, inset), but they are not able to form tumors in nude mice (Fig. 4 B). The mechanisms by which the baculovirus p35 protein induces transformation of mouse embryo fibroblasts remain to be elucidated. The use of mouse embryo fibroblasts totally devoid of IGF-IRs has allowed us to dissociate the effects of p35 on cell survival and transformation. The baculovirus p35 protein requires the presence of the IGF-IR in order to transform mouse embryo fibroblasts, as shown for a variety of other viral oncogenes (16Sell C. Rubini M. Rubin R. Liu J.P. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11217-11221Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 17Sell C. Dumenil G. Deveaud C. Miura M. Coppola D. De Angelis T. Rubin R. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3604-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 18Morrione A. DeAngelis T. Baserga R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5300-5303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One possible mechanism could be due to cooperation between IGF-IR and p35; the hypothesis we favor is that the IGF-IR transmits a permissive signal that allows p35 and other viral oncogenes to transform mouse embryo fibroblasts. To date, the only viral oncogene shown to bypass the requirement of IGF-IR for transformation is v-src (19Valentinis B. Morrione A. Taylor S. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3744-3754Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, we can conclude that the mechanism by which the baculovirus p35 protein induces transformation of mouse embryo fibroblasts is different from the one induced by v-src. One possibility that is attractive is that p35 may up-regulate the IGF system. Experiments along these lines are in progress. We believe that the transforming ability of p35 is not simply due to caspase inhibition. Our hypothesis is supported by another report in the literature (46Mc Carthy N.J. Whyte M.K.B. Gilbert C.S. Evan G.I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) showing that peptide inhibitors of ICE-related proteases delay but do not prevent cell death in Rat-1 fibroblasts following etoposide treatment, Bak expression, c-mycactivation, or E1A expression. In the presence of these inhibitors, the cells are not able to divide or to form colonies in soft agar (46Mc Carthy N.J. Whyte M.K.B. Gilbert C.S. Evan G.I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Therefore, the transforming ability of p35 observed in the presence of the IGF-IR cannot be explained only by its effect as a caspase inhibitor and should be due to an additional activity of p35. Similar observations have been reported for SV40 large T antigen. It can suppress ICE-mediated cell death (47Jung J.-K. Yuan J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1207-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), but it still requires the presence of the IGF-IR in order to transform mouse embryo fibroblasts (16Sell C. Rubini M. Rubin R. Liu J.P. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11217-11221Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 17Sell C. Dumenil G. Deveaud C. Miura M. Coppola D. De Angelis T. Rubin R. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3604-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). In addition, SV40 large T antigen is known to transcriptionally activate the IGF-I promoter and induce production of IGF-I (48Porcu P.L. Ferber A. Pietrzkowski Z. Roberts C.T. Adamo M. LeRoith D. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5069-5077Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A similar effect could be postulated for the baculovirus p35 protein. Future experiments, requiring appropriate mutants of p35, in which the anti-apoptotic domain can be dissociated from the transforming domain, will address this issue. In summary, in addition to its effect as an inhibitor of apoptosis, we now report for the first time that the baculovirus p35 protein has transforming potential that requires the presence of the IGF-IR."
