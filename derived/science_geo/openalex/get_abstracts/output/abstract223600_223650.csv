https://openalex.org/W2057070304,"Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) has been implicated as a mediator of muscle wasting through nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) -dependent inhibition of myogenic differentiation. The aim of the present study was to identify the regulatory molecule(s) of myogenesis targeted by TNFalpha/NF-kappaB signaling. TNFalpha interfered with cell cycle exit and repressed the accumulation of transcripts encoding muscle-specific genes in differentiating C2C12 myoblasts. Overexpression of a p65 (RelA) mutant lacking the transcriptional activation domain attenuated the TNFalpha-mediated inhibition of muscle-specific gene transcription. The ability of muscle regulatory factor MyoD to induce muscle-specific transcription in 10T1/2 fibroblasts was also disrupted by wild-type p65, demonstrating that NF-kappaB transcriptional activity interferes with the function of MyoD. Inhibition of muscle-specific gene expression by TNFalpha was restored by overexpression of MyoD, whereas endogenous MyoD protein abundance and stability were reduced by TNFalpha through increased proteolysis of MyoD by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. Last, the inhibitory effects of TNFalpha on myogenic differentiation were demonstrated in a mouse model of skeletal muscle regeneration, in which TNFalpha caused a delay in myoblast cell cycle exit. These results implicate that TNFalpha inhibits myogenic differentiation through destabilizing MyoD protein in a NF-kappaB-dependent manner, which interferes with skeletal muscle regeneration and may contribute to muscle wasting."
https://openalex.org/W2073173679,"Methamphetamine (METH) is an illicit drug that causes neurodegenerative effects in humans. In rodents, METH induces apoptosis of striatal glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) -containing neurons. This paper provides evidence that METH-induced cell death occurs consequent to interactions of ER stress and mitochondrial death pathways. Specifically, injections of METH are followed by an almost immediate activation of proteases calpain and caspase-12, events consistent with drug-induced ER stress. Involvement of ER stress was further supported by observations of increases in the expression of GRP78/BiP and CHOP. Participation of the mitochondrial pathway was demonstrated by the transition of AIF, smac/DIABLO, and cytochrome c from mitochondrial into cytoplasmic fractions. These changes occur before the apoptosome-associated pro-caspase-9 cleavage. Effector caspases-3 and -6, but not -7, were cleaved with the initial time of caspase-3 activation occurring before caspase 9 cleavage; this suggests possible earlier cleavage of caspase-3 by caspase-12. These events preceded proteolysis of the caspase substrates DFF-45, lamin A, and PARP in nuclear fractions. These findings indicate that METH causes neuronal apoptosis in part via cross-talks between ER- and mitochondria-generated processes, which cause activation of both caspase-dependent and -independent pathways."

https://openalex.org/W2148674446,"Cyclooxygenase1 (COX1) and COX2 mediate the rate-limiting step in arachidonic acid metabolism. Expression of COX2 mRNA and protein is often enhanced in various human cell types by inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). IL-1beta enhanced expression of various prostanoids and this expression was blocked by COX2 selective inhibitors. IL-1beta markedly induced angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo, which was significantly inhibited by COX2 selective inhibitors but not by a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. In contrast, COX2 selective inhibitors only partially blocked VEGF-induced angiogenesis. EP2, EP4 (prostaglandin E2 receptors) agonists and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) receptor agonists induced angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo; IL-1beta-induced angiogenesis was blocked by an EP4 antagonist and a TXA2 receptor antagonist. IL-1beta induced much less angiogenesis in cornea of COX2 knockout mice than that of wild-type mice. This is the first report that COX2 and some prostanoids play a key role in IL-1beta-induced angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2125279675,"We have generated homozygous transgenic mice (hpa-tg) overexpressing human heparanase (endo-beta-D-glucuronidase) in all tissues and characterized the involvement of the enzyme in tissue morphogenesis, vascularization, and energy metabolism. Biochemical analysis of heparan sulfate (HS) isolated from newborn mice and adult tissues revealed a profound decrease in the size of HS chains derived from hpa-tg vs. control mice. Despite this, the mice appeared normal, were fertile, and exhibited a normal life span. A significant increase in the number of implanted embryos was noted in the hpa-tg vs. control mice. Overexpression of heparanase resulted in increased levels of urinary protein and creatinine, suggesting an effect on kidney function, reflected also by electron microscopy examination of the kidney tissue. The hpa-tg mice exhibited a reduced food consumption and body weight compared with control mice. The effect of heparanase on tissue remodeling and morphogenesis was best demonstrated by the phenotype of the hpa-tg mammary glands, showing excess branching and widening of ducts associated with enhanced neovascularization and disruption of the epithelial basement membrane. The hpa-tg mice exhibited an accelerated rate of hair growth, correlated with high expression of heparanase in hair follicle keratinocytes and increased vascularization. Altogether, characterization of the hpa-tg mice emphasizes the involvement of heparanase and HS in processes such as embryonic implantation, food consumption, tissue remodeling, and vascularization."
https://openalex.org/W2073793348,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are traditionally known for their role in extracellular matrix remodeling. Increasing evidence reveals several alternative substrates and novel biological roles for these proteases. Recent evidence showed the intracellular localization of MMP-2 within cardiac myocytes, colocalized with troponin I within myofilaments. Here we investigated the presence of MMP-2 in the nucleus of cardiac myocytes using both immunogold electron microscopy and biochemical assays with nuclear extracts. The gelatinase activity found in both human heart and rat liver nuclear extracts was blocked with MMP inhibitors. In addition, the ability of MMP-2 to cleave poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) as a substrate was examined as a possible role for MMP-2 in the nucleus. PARP is a nuclear matrix enzyme involved in the repair of DNA strand breaks, which is known to be inactivated by proteolytic cleavage. PARP was susceptible to cleavage by MMP-2 in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner, yielding novel degradation products of ~66 and <45 kDa. The cleavage of PARP by MMP-2 was also blocked by MMP inhibitors. This is the first characterization of MMP-2 within the nucleus and we hereby suggest its possible role in PARP degradation."

https://openalex.org/W2158687094,"Dentin matrix protein-1 (DMP1) is a mineralized tissue matrix protein synthesized by osteoblasts, hypertrophic chondrocytes, and ameloblasts as well as odontoblasts. DMP1 is believed to have multiple in vivo functions, acting both as a signaling molecule and a regulator of biomineralization. Using a cell-free system in vitro, we evaluated the action of DMP1 in the regulation of hydroxylapatite (HA) formation and crystal growth. The non-phosphorylated recombinant protein acted as an HA nucleator, increasing the amount of mineral formed in a gelatin gel HA growth system relative to protein-free controls. The recombinant protein phosphorylated in vitro had no detectable effect on HA formation and growth. In contrast, phosphorylated bovine DMP1 expressed in marrow stromal cells with an adenovirus vector containing 29.7 phosphates/mol was an effective inhibitor of HA formation and growth. The native full-length protein appeared to be absent or present in only small amounts in the extracellular matrix of bones and teeth. However, two highly phosphorylated fragments representing the N- and C-terminal portions of DMP1 have been identified, apparently arising from proteolytic cleavage of four X–Asp bonds. The highly phosphorylated C-terminal 57-kDa fragment (containing 42 phosphates/mol), like the non-phosphorylated DMP1, was an HA nucleator. These data suggest that, in its native form, DMP1 inhibits mineralization, but when cleaved or dephosphorylated, it initiates mineralization. These in vitro data are consistent with the findings in the DMP1 knockout mouse.

Dentin matrix protein-1 (DMP1) 1The abbreviations used are: DMP1, dentin matrix protein-1; rDMP1, recombinant DMP1; bDMP1, bovine DMP1; HA, hydroxyapatite; PHEX, phosphate regulating gene with homology to endopeptidases on the X-chromosome. 1The abbreviations used are: DMP1, dentin matrix protein-1; rDMP1, recombinant DMP1; bDMP1, bovine DMP1; HA, hydroxyapatite; PHEX, phosphate regulating gene with homology to endopeptidases on the X-chromosome. is an acidic, phosphorylated, integrin-binding extracellular matrix protein first identified by screening a rat cDNA library (1George A. Sabsay B. Simnonian P.A. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12624-12630Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis in the rat originally suggested that the DMP1 message was odontoblast-specific, with in situ hybridization showing DMP1 mRNA expression to be restricted to those fully differentiated odontoblasts engaged in active dentin matrix formation, with transient expression by ameloblasts (1George A. Sabsay B. Simnonian P.A. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12624-12630Google Scholar, 2George A. Gui J. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Veis A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 1527-1531Google Scholar). More recent in situ hybridization studies show a much broader pattern of expression of DMP1, with expression associated with a number of mineralizing tissues, including bone and cementum (3MacDougall M. Gu T.T. Luan X. Simmons D. Chen J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 422-431Google Scholar). In rat and chicken bone, immunohistochemical detection showed an association of DMP1 with osteocytes, but not with osteoblasts (4Toyosawa S. Shintani S. Fujiwara T. Osshima T. Sato A. Ijuhin N. Komori T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 2017-2026Google Scholar). In the mouse, hypertrophic chondrocytes express more DMP1 than other cell types (5Fen J.Q. Zhang J. Dallas S.L. Lu Y. Chen S. Tan X. Owen M. Harris S.E. MacDougall M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1822-1831Google Scholar). DMP1 was detected at high levels by Northern analysis in fetal bovine brain and cultured long bone as well as in odontoblasts (6Hirst K.L. Ibaraki-O'Connor K. Young M.F. Dixon M.J. J. Dent. Res. 1997; 76: 754-760Google Scholar). Most recently, DMP1 was localized by immunohistochemistry in human lung cancer tissue (7Chaplet M. De Leval L. Waltregny D. Detry C. Fornaciari G. Bevilacqua G. Fisher L.W. Castronovo V. Bellahcene A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 1506-1512Google Scholar).DMP1 is a small protein that has been postulated to have a high affinity for hydroxylapatite (HA) (8Hohling H.J. Arnold S. Barckhaus R.H. Plate U. Wiesmann H.P. Connect. Tissue Res. 1995; 33: 171-178Google Scholar, 9He G. Dahl T. Veis A. George A. Nat. Mater. 2003; 2: 552-558Google Scholar). This coupled with its localization in mineralized tissues suggested that DMP1 could have an important role in mineralization. DMP1 is a member of the SIBLING (small integrin-binding ligand, N-linked glycoprotein) family of proteins (10Fisher L.W. Torchia D.A. Fohr B. Young M.F. Fedarko N.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 460-465Google Scholar, 11Fisher L.W. Fedarko N.S. Connect. Tissue Res. 2003; 44: 33-40Google Scholar). Like other members of the SIBLING family, DMP1 has an integrin-binding site that facilitates cell-matrix interactions and that provides the potential for cellular communication. It also resembles other SIBLING proteins in having large numbers of glycosylation and phosphorylation sites that, when occupied, can affect its own conformation and the interaction with other extracellular matrix proteins.DMP1 is immunolocalized throughout the extracellular matrix of all bony sites as well as in the dentin and cementum of mouse mineralized tissues (12Butler W.T. Brunn J.C. Win C. McKee M.D. Connect. Tissue Res. 2002; 43: 301-307Google Scholar). In bone, immunostaining is predominantly associated with osteocytes and their processes, in particular the lamina limitans lining the wall of canaliculi in the extracellular matrix surrounding the cell processes. Similarly, in dentin, there is substantial staining of cellular and/or matrix elements in the predentin as well as reactivity in the odontoblastic processes and/or in the dentin tubules. In cementum, similar reactivity is observed around the cementocytes and their cell processes. These results suggest that DMP1 might serve to prevent mineralization in select areas of the extracellular matrix. In contrast, recent studies with recombinant DMP1 immobilized on glass slides have shown it to bind calcium and to initiate mineralization (9He G. Dahl T. Veis A. George A. Nat. Mater. 2003; 2: 552-558Google Scholar), suggesting that the protein might be a nucleator. In cultures, DMP1 acts as a signaling molecule enhancing osteoblast mineralization when overexpressed (13Narayanan K. Ramachandran A. Hao J. He G. Park K.W. Cho M. George A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17500-17508Google Scholar). However, the function of the phosphorylated form of the protein is not known. Furthermore, intact, highly phosphorylated DMP1 has yet to be isolated from bone or dentin. Fully phosphorylated peptides corresponding to the C and N termini of full-length DMP1 were recently isolated from rat bone (14Qin C. Brunn J.C. Cook R.G. Orkiszewski R.S. Malone J.P. Veis A. Butler W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34700-34708Google Scholar). Although these peptides are heterogeneous in molecular size, they appear to be derived from cleavage at four X–Asp bonds located in close proximity.In this study, using a dynamic gelatin gel system to monitor mineral formation and growth (15Boskey A.L. J. Phys. Chem. 1989; 93: 1628-1633Google Scholar), we compare the effects on mineralization of recombinant DMP1 with and without post-translational modifications, bovine DMP1 expressed using an adenovirus system in human marrow stromal cells, and the phosphorylated C-terminal fraction of DMP1 isolated from rat bone. We demonstrate that the concentration-dependent in vitro actions of these proteins are a function of size and phosphorylation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAll chemical reagents were acquired from Fisher unless otherwise indicated. HA seed crystals were prepared as described previously (16Blumenthal N.C. Betts F. Posner A.S. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1981; 33: 111-117Google Scholar) by conversion of amorphous calcium phosphate at pH 8. Synthetic HA was characterized by x-ray diffraction as detailed below.Protein Preparations—Four proteins were used in these studies: rat recombinant DMP1 (rDMP1) expressed in Escherichia coli, phosphorylated rDMP1, “native” bovine DMP1 (bDMP1) expressed in human marrow stromal cells, and a 57-kDa C-terminal fragment of DMP1 isolated from rat bone. Details of the preparation and purification of the recombinant protein prepared in E. coli appear elsewhere (17Srinivasan R. Chen B. Gorski J.P. George A. Connect. Tissue Res. 1999; 40: 251-258Google Scholar). Purified rDMP1 was phosphorylated in vitro. Batches of 500 μl (0.3–0.5 μg) were mixed with 100 ng of casein kinases I and II (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 200 μl of 1 mm ATP, carried out overnight at 37 °C, and terminated by the addition of an inhibitor mixture (casein kinase I and II assay kit, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Samples were then purified by 10% SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated rDMP1 was stored in phosphate-buffered saline at –70 °C until used. Prior to use, the protein was dialyzed against 0.15 m Tris (pH 7.4) to remove the excess phosphate.bDMP1 was made by infecting bone marrow stromal cells with full-length bDMP1 cDNA cloned into replication-deficient adenovirus (Ad5) constructs using the cytomegalovirus promoter as described (18Jain A. Karadag A. Fohr B. Fisher L.W. Fedarko N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13700-13708Google Scholar). Briefly, adenovirus was plaque-selected and propagated on HEK293 cells (American Type Culture Collection CRL1573). Viral particles were purified by twice banding on CsCl, and viral titers were evaluated by plaque formation of virus dilutions on HEK293 cells. rDMP1 was generated by infecting subconfluent normal human marrow stromal fibroblasts with 10,000 plaque-forming units/cell. Harvested serum-free medium from the infected human marrow stromal cells was subjected to anion-exchange chromatography. Proteins were purified by diluting the medium from normal human marrow stromal fibroblast cells 1:1 with 40 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and loading directly onto a 5.0 × 2.0-cm column packed with ToyoPearl TSK QAE resin. A linear salt gradient to 2.0 m NaCl was employed to separately purify the proteins (∼95% purity as measured by SDS-PAGE). Solutions were desalted; a stock solution of 50 μg/ml was prepared in Tris buffer (pH 7.4), and solutions for analysis were prepared by serial dilution with Tris buffer (pH 7.4).The 57-kDa peptide from the C-terminal end of DMP1 was isolated from rat long bones as described (14Qin C. Brunn J.C. Cook R.G. Orkiszewski R.S. Malone J.P. Veis A. Butler W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34700-34708Google Scholar). In brief, after ion-exchange separation of the EDTA extract containing bone extracellular matrix proteins, subfractions rich in the 57-kDa fragment were first gel-filtered using a Bio-Gel A-15m column (Bio-Rad). Next, fractions enriched in the 57-kDa fragment were passed over a Bio-Gel A-50m column (Bio-Rad), providing a preparation of the 57-kDa fragment free of osteopontin, bone sialoprotein, the 37-kDa fragment, and other known bone proteins. SDS-PAGE with Stains-All staining showed that the 57-kDa protein migrated as a broad band with an average molecular mass of 57 kDa on 7.5% gels. Parallel phosphate and amino acid analyses showed 41 phosphorylated residues in the 57-kDa fragment. For mineralization analyses, the lyophilized 57-kDa protein was resuspended in Tris buffer (pH 7.4).Qualitative Phosphoamino Acid Analyses of in Vitro Phosphorylated Bacterial rDMP1 and Native Human Marrow Stromal Cell-expressed bDMP1—Ten μg of rDMP1 and 14 μg of bDMP1 were subjected to partial acid hydrolysis for 6 h at 110 °C in Pyrex-sealed tubes under vacuum in 4 n HCl to determine the phosphoamino acid content. One-third of each sample was further hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl for an additional 18 h at 110 °C for total amino acid analysis. The samples were dried in vacuo, suspended in borate buffer in the presence of AccQFluor reagent, and derivatized and analyzed following the AccQ-Tag method (Waters-Millipore Corp., Milford, MA) as recommended by the manufacturer.The AccQFluor-derivatized phosphoamino acids were identified by analyzing initially the standard mixture of AccQFluor derivatives of phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine (100 pmol of each alone), followed by analysis of the AccQFluor derivatives of the rDMP1 and bDMP1 acid hydrolysates. Comparison of the elution times of the standard phosphoamino acids and the peak areas were used as a means to determine the absence or presence of particular phosphoamino acids and their quantitative levels. The total amino acid content was determined similarly using standard AccQFluor derivatives of naturally occurring amino acids. The data from phosphoamino acid analysis and the total amino acids were used to calculate quantitatively the phosphorylation states of rDMP1 and bDMP1.Mineralization Assays—De novo HA formation and growth were monitored in the dynamic collagen gel HA growth system (15Boskey A.L. J. Phys. Chem. 1989; 93: 1628-1633Google Scholar). A double diffusion system, Ca2+ and HPO42- ions, was circulated at room temperature and diffused into opposite ends of a 6-cm-long 10% gelatin gel (bloom 275). The pH of the gelatin solution (prepared by stirring at 50 °C) was adjusted to 7.40 with 0.1 n NaOH. The gels were prepared in layers, adding 3 cm of 10% gelatin, allowing it to set, and adding a 100-μl band containing the proteins to be tested at a site 3.4 cm from the HPO42- entrance point. The protein in question was included at the gel site where apatite formation occurred in the absence of added protein. The proteins were delivered in 0.15 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) and mixed with an equal volume of 20% gelatin so that the final gelatin concentration in the band was 10%. The experimental gels contained 0.1–25 μg/ml protein. Control gels prepared in a similar fashion contained only buffer. Once the gel had hardened after cooling at 20 °C for 30 min, it was covered without any interface with the 10% gelatin.Calcium and phosphate solutions (100 mm each) were circulated from 2-liter containers, providing an “infinite reservoir” relative to the 3-ml contents of the 18 gels used for each experiment. Solutions were circulated at a continuous rate through this device in separate loops at opposite ends of the gel; when mineralization began, the CaxP concentration in their respective sides adjacent to the precipitant band was ∼5.5 mm2 (19Boskey A.L. Maresca M. Ullrich W. Doty S.B. Butler W.T. Prince C.W. Bone Miner. 1993; 22: 147-159Google Scholar). Solution flow was maintained using a nitrogen pump. The device was not thermostatted; but the ambient temperature around the device was monitored, and experiments were not done if the temperature was outside the range of 20–25 °C. Physiologic temperatures could not be used because the gelatin began to melt at 35 °C. After 3.5 days, a thin opaque band (precipitant band) formed perpendicular to the direction of the flow. Gels were sampled at 3.5 days (de novo formation) or at 5 days (formation and growth). For measurement of crystal growth, preformed HA seed crystals (0.5 mg/ml) were added to the 100-μl bands along with buffer and/or protein. For these cases, the seed crystals were preincubated with the protein for 18 h at 4 °C.All experiments were repeated at least in triplicate. For the de novo formation and growth studies, Ca2+ and HPO42- accumulation in the precipitant band containing Tris buffer (control) was compared with experimental gels. Identical “single diffusion” gels, into which either Ca2+ or HPO42- diffused, served as additional controls to correct for ion accretion due only to diffusion or to bonding of the ion to the matrix protein. Controls and experimental tubes were run parallel to each other. Comparisons were made with the controls to avoid errors inherent in experiments that might have varied in temperature, time span, solution flow, or reservoir concentrations.Gels were removed from the apparatus, and the position at which the mineral was deposited was noted. The precipitant was used as a reference to position the gel on a ruler. The gel was sliced into seven slices with a device consisting of equally spaced (0.3 cm apart) wires. Either the precipitant band was removed for mineral analysis based on x-ray diffraction, or the entire gel was cut into slices (0.30 ml). The Ca2+ (20Willis J.B. Clin. Chem. 1993; 39: 155-160Google Scholar) and HPO42- (21Heinonen J.K. Lahti R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 113: 313-317Google Scholar) contents of each slice were determined following hydrolysis of the gel in 2 n HCl for 18 h at 110 °C. Ca2+ and HPO42- accumulation in the precipitant band was calculated by subtracting the content of the comparable slice in the single diffusion gels from that in the double diffusion gel.X-ray Diffraction Analysis—X-ray powder diffraction was used to identify phases present at 5 days and to determine HA crystal size and perfection. Once the gels were cut, the slice with the precipitant band was heated to 50 °C and microcentrifuged for 20 s; the liquefied gelatin was removed; and the remaining mineral precipitate was lyophilized. The powder was then examined by wide-angle x-ray diffraction using a Brucker AX-8 powder diffractometer with CuKα radiation. Average crystal size was calculated using the Scherrer equation (22Klug H.P. Alexander K.E. X-ray Diffraction Procedures. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1962: 491-538Google Scholar).Statistical Analysis—For each individual experiment (9 experimental and 9 control gels plus 12 single diffusion gels), data were corrected for single diffusion, and ratios of experimental over control gels run at the same time were calculated. Calcium/phosphate molar ratios for both experimental and control gels were also calculated; and if they differed by >30% from the stoichiometric ratio of 1.7:1, then that particular set of data was excluded. All experimental data (with various forms of DMP1) were checked by analysis of variance and compared with control data (without DMP1) using Dunnett's test at a significance level of p = 0.05 (GraphPAD Instat). Because of the exclusion of some experiments, the total number of experiments for each concentration varied from three to seven.RESULTSThis study has shown that DMP1 has a variety of effects on in vitro mineral deposition that appear to be dependent on concentration, extent of phosphorylation, and size. The recombinant protein expressed in E. coli functioned as an HA nucleator, losing its nucleation activity once phosphorylated. The more phosphorylated protein expressed in marrow stromal cells was an inhibitor. In contrast, the highly phosphorylated 57-kDa peptide was capable of nucleation.rDMP1 expressed in E. coli promoted HA formation and growth at 3.5 days relative to protein-free controls (Fig. 1A). There was no statistically significant effect when de novo formation and growth were analyzed at 5 days (Fig. 1B). However, when HA crystals were precoated with DMP1, there was a dose-dependent inhibition of mineral accumulation, although this effect was only marginally significant (p = 0.06) (Fig. 1C). There was no effect of rDMP1 on HA crystal size at 5 days as measured by x-ray line broadening analysis (Table I).Table ICrystallite size of HA formed in the gelatin gel system in the presence of varying concentrations of DMP1 at 5 daysProteinc axis dimensionnmrDMP1 0 μg/ml14.7 25 μg/ml20.6 50 μg/ml13.8 100 μg/ml14.5bDMP1 0 μg/ml13.4 ± 1.2 1 μg/ml53.9 ± 2 10 μg/ml108.5 ± 8 25 μg/ml15 50 μg/ml17.9 100 μg/ml15.857-kDa peptide 5 μg/ml16.5 25 μg/ml14.7 100 μg/ml17.4 Open table in a new tab When the recombinant protein was phosphorylated in vitro, there was no significant effect on HA proliferation and growth at either 3.5 (Fig. 2A) or 5 (Fig. 2B) days. The phosphorylated recombinant protein also did not alter the HA crystal size as determined by line broadening analyses (Table I). Analysis of the extent of phosphorylation showed that there were 91.8 nmol of Ser(P)/mg of protein (9.6 Ser(P) residues/1000 residues), translating to 5.6 mol of Ser(P)/mol of DMP1, corresponding to ∼10% of the potential phosphorylation sites.Fig. 2Effect of phosphorylated rDMP1 on HA formation and growth in a gelatin gel system.

PrDMP1, phosphorylated rDMP1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In contrast, bDMP1 expressed in marrow stromal cells was a very effective inhibitor of de novo HA formation at 3.5 days (Fig. 3A). In these studies, the apparent crystal yield decreased with increasing concentrations of bDMP1. Based on line broadening analysis, the c axis crystallite particle length increased with increasing bDMP1 concentrations from 0 to 10 μg/ml, but decreased to control values at 25 μg/ml (Table I). In seeded growth experiments, bDMP1 showed a significant dose-dependent linear trend (p < 0.05) when yields were compared, but the observed values measured at each concentration were not statistically different from the control values measured at the same time (Fig. 3B). Analysis of the phosphoamino acid content of this protein showed 330 nmol of Ser(P)/mg of protein (35.5 Ser(P) residues/1000 residues), translating to 29.7 mol of Ser(P)/mol of bDMP1. It is noteworthy that the only phosphoamino acids detectable in both rDMP1 and bDMP1 are seryl residues. The data were corrected for both rDMP1 and bDMP1 analysis for partial hydrolysis and some cleavage of phosphate groups from the serine residues during partial acid hydrolysis. Comparison of in vitro phosphorylated rDMP1 with native bDMP1 indicated a substantial difference in the extent of phosphorylation between these two DMP1 forms, which is reflected in the differences in the mineral assays (see “Discussion”).Fig. 3Effect of bDMP1 expressed in human bone marrow stromal cells on HA formation and growth in a gelatin gel system. A, at 3.5 days, there was a significant dose-dependent inhibition of HA formation. B, seeded growth at 5 days was also inhibited.

Hohling et al. (8Hohling H.J. Arnold S. Barckhaus R.H. Plate U. Wiesmann H.P. Connect. Tissue Res. 1995; 33: 171-178Google Scholar) have suggested that, because the predicted secondary structures of several extracellular matrix proteins (including that of DMP1) match the HA crystal faces, these are the proteins that bind and stabilize HA critical nuclei and HA crystals, facilitating their growth and proliferation. This postulate is consistent with our observations the non-phosphorylated rDMP1 acted as a mineralization promoter.The partially phosphorylated form of the recombinant protein expressed in E. coli had no detectable effect on apatite formation and growth, in contrast to the native bovine protein expressed in human bone marrow cells, which acted as an effective inhibitor. The absence of effects of the phosphorylated recombinant protein may be due to incomplete protein phosphorylation, as phosphorylated bDMP1 did have an effect. Although it might be argued that the cloned protein is smaller than the intact bone protein (14Qin C. Brunn J.C. Cook R.G. Orkiszewski R.S. Malone J.P. Veis A. Butler W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34700-34708Google Scholar), comparing the recombinant protein and the similarly sized phosphorylated recombinant protein argues for the effect of phosphorylation on protein conformation. Other phosphoproteins such as dentin phosphophoryn, osteopontin, and bone sialoprotein have little effect on in vitro apatite formation and growth when dephosphorylated or partially dephosphorylated (23Boskey A.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 760: 249-256Google Scholar, 24Boskey A.L. Maresca M. Doty S. Sabsay B. Veis A. Bone Miner. 1990; 11: 55-65Google Scholar, 25Jono S. Peinado C. Giachelli C.M. J. Biol.

As in other systems, phosphorylation may change the conformation of the protein (27Lahiri S.D. Zhang G. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8351-8359Google Scholar, 28Dajani R. Fraser E. Roe S.M. Young N. Good V. Dale T.C. Pearl L.H. Cell. 2001; 105: 721-732Google Scholar) and may also expose anionic domains that can interact with calcium on the apatite surface. Thus, although apatite nuclei are stabilized in the presence of totally nonphosphorylated DMP1, these interactions may be blocked upon partial phosphorylation.Using two different systems in which DMP1 was immobilized on different surfaces, He et al. (9He G. Dahl T. Veis A. George A. Nat. Mater. 2003; 2: 552-558Google Scholar, 29He G. Dahl T. Veis A. George A. Connect. Tissue Res. 2003; 44: 240-245Google Scholar) showed recently that rDMP1 acts as a promoter of HA formation, binding large amounts of calcium. The HA used in those studies was formed by growth on an amorphous calcium phosphate surface. Even when not immobilized, as in the present study, rDMP1 promoted apatite formation.In contrast to the actions of non-phosphorylated DMP1 and partially phosphorylated DMP1, bDMP1 expressed in human marrow stromal cells was a significant inhibitor of in vitro mineralization. In parallel 5-day studies, the crystal size increased at 0.1–10 μg/ml, but decreased at 25 μg/ml. At the lowest concentrations, DMP1 inhibited crystal formation; but most likely, coating of existing crystals was not complete, and the crystals that were presented continued to grow at the expense of the smaller crystals. At higher concentrations, DMP1 most likely coated all the crystals present, preventing crystal growth. This presumably highly phosphorylated full-length protein should represent the actual DMP1 made in bone cells prior to protein degradation (14Qin C. Brunn J.C. Cook R.G. Orkiszewski R.S. Malone J.P. Veis A. Butler W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34700-34708Google Scholar).Although DMP1 may have other in situ functions in cell signaling and gene regulation (13Narayanan K. Ramachandran A. Hao J. He G. Park K.W. Cho M. George A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17500-17508Google Scholar, 30Septier D. Torres-Quintana M.A. Menashi S. George A. Goldberg M. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 2001; 109: 198-203Google Scholar), our data suggest that intact phosphorylated DMP1 acts as a mineralization inhibitor. This conclusion is consistent with immunohistochemical observations showing a cellular distribution of DMP1 predominantly in chicken and rat osteocytes, rather than in osteoblasts (4Toyosawa S. Shintani S. Fujiwar"
https://openalex.org/W1975120553,"Interleukin-8 (IL-8), a chemokine implicated in the metastasis and angiogenesis of a variety of cancers, has been reported to be overexpressed in prostate cancer. In this study, we ascribe a new role for IL-8 in prostate cancer progression using LNCaP cells. We demonstrate that IL-8 activates the androgen receptor and confers androgen-independent growth, while serving as a potent chemotactic factor. Our evaluation of the possible signal pathways involved in androgen-independence and cell migration shows that the tyrosine kinases Src and FAK (focal adhesion kinase) are involved in IL-8-induced signaling. Pharmacological and genetic inhibitors of Src and FAK interfere with IL-8-induced cell migration, while only the Src inhibitor was able to repress androgen-independent growth. This suggests that both growth and migration depend on the activity of Src, whereas cell migration also requires the activation of FAK. Our evidence that IL-8-induced androgen-independent growth is, at least in part, due to androgen receptor activation includes (1) an inhibitor of androgen receptor activity diminishes cell growth; (2) androgen receptor transactivation potential is augmented by IL-8 and (3) androgen receptor is recruited to the promoter of prostate specific antigen (PSA) upon IL-8 treatment, based on chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. Taken together, our data suggest that in addition to its role in metastasis and angiogenesis, IL-8 may also serve as a facilitator for androgen-independent transition of prostate cancers. To our knowledge, this is the first report about the tyrosine kinase signals and androgen receptor activation induced by IL-8 in prostate cancer cells. The observation that IL-8 mediates its growth and chemotactic effects via Src and FAK suggests the potential use for tyrosine kinase inhibitors at early stage of prostate cancer development."
https://openalex.org/W1594524304,"The combined effects of aging and regular physical exercise was investigated on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation, glutathione status, and the activity of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) in rat liver. A group of 24 male F344 rats was divided into the following categories: adult control (18 months), adult exercised (18 months), and aged control (28 months) and aged exercised (28 months). The ROS formation increased as a function of age and exercise training decreased the rate of ROS formation in the two age groups. Significant positive correlation was found between ROS production and lipid peroxidation (LIPOX). The reduced glutathione (GSH) level was higher and the oxidized glutathione (GSSG) level lower in exercised groups compared with the sedentary controls (P<0.05). An age-associated increase in NF-kappaB activity was attenuated by the regular exercise. The content of p50 and p65 subunits of NF-kappaB increased with age and decreased with exercise training. The content of inhibitory factor-kappaB was inversely related to NF-kappaB activation. Regular exercise-induced adaptive responses, including attenuation of an increase in ROS production, LIPOX level, NF-kappaB activation, and reduced GSH/GSSG ratio, appear to be capable, even in old age, of reducing increases in inflammatory and other detrimental consequences that are often associated with advancing age."
https://openalex.org/W2149183853,"Mutations in either polycystin-2 (PC2) or polycystin-1 (PC1) proteins cause severe, potentially lethal, kidney disorders and multiple extrarenal (including brain) disease phenotypes. PC2, a member of the transient receptor potential channel superfamily, and PC1, an orphan membrane receptor of largely unknown function, are thought to be part of a common signaling pathway. Here, we show that in rat sympathetic neurons and kidney cells, coassembly of full-length PC1 with PC2 forms a plasmalemmal ion channel signaling complex in which PC1 stimulation simultaneously activates PC2 ion channels and Gi/o-proteins. PC2 activation occurs through a structural rearrangement of PC1, independent of G-protein activation. Thus, PC1 acts as a prototypical membrane receptor that concordantly regulates PC2 channels and G-proteins, a bimodal mechanism that may account for the multifunctional roles of polycystin proteins in fundamental cellular processes of various cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2156121797,"Versican/PG-M is an extracellular matrix proteoglycan, expression of which is elevated in a variety of human tumors. The significance of this change is unclear. Here we show that versican G3-containing fragments are present at high levels in human astrocytoma. Expression of a versican G3 construct in U87 astrocytoma cells enhances colony growth in soft agarose gel and tumor growth and blood vessel formation in nude mice. The G3-containing medium enhances endothelial cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration. G3-expressing cells and tumors formed by these cells express increased levels of fibronectin and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Furthermore, the G3 domain directly binds to fibronectin and forms a complex together with VEGF. In the presence of these three molecules, endothelial cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration were found to be significantly enhanced. Removal of the complex containing these molecules reverses these processes. Taken together, these findings implicate G3 as a modifier of tumor growth and angiogenesis and suggest a new avenue for development of anticancer and anti-angiogenic therapies based on targeting versican G3 fragments."
https://openalex.org/W1963764350,"The clinically common mutant opsin P23H, associated with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, yields low levels of rhodopsin when retinal is added following induction of the protein in stably transfected HEK-293 cells. We previously showed that P23H rhodopsin levels could be increased by providing a 7-membered ring, locked analog of 11-cis-retinal during expression of P23H opsin in vivo. Here we demonstrate that the mutant opsin is effectively rescued by 9- or 11-cis-retinal, the native chromophore. When retinal was added during expression, P23H rhodopsin levels were 5-fold (9-cis) and 6-fold (11-cis) higher than when retinal was added after opsin was expressed and cells were harvested. Levels of P23H opsin were increased ∼3.5-fold with both compounds, but wild-type protein levels were only slightly increased. Addition of retinal during induction promoted the Golgi-specific glycosylation of P23H opsin and transport of the protein to the cell surface. P23H rhodopsins containing 9- or 11-cis-retinal had blue-shifted absorption maxima and altered photo-bleaching properties compared with the corresponding wild-type proteins. Significantly, P23H rhodopsins were more thermally unstable than the wild-type proteins and more rapidly bleached by hydroxylamine in the dark. We suggest that P23H opsin is similarly unstable and that retinal binds and stabilizes the protein early in its biogenesis to promote its cellular folding and trafficking.

The implications of this study for treating retinitis pigmentosa and other protein conformational disorders are discussed. Rhodopsin, the major pigment of vertebrate rod cells, is an integral membrane glycoprotein (∼40 kDa) that functions as a G protein-coupled receptor in detecting dim light (1Hargrave P.A. Hamm H.E. Hofmann K.P. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Rhodopsin biogenesis involves the membrane insertion of opsin, a 348-amino acid polypeptide that must fold to form seven transmembrane α-helices and assemble with the chromophore, 11-cis-retinal. The chromophore is covalently attached to opsin by a protonated Schiff base linked to Lys296 in the seventh α-helix and interacts extensively with amino acid residues located in transmembrane α-helices (2Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5038) Google Scholar). It also contacts residues at the base of the “retinal plug,” a short four-stranded β-sheet assembled from the N-terminal segment and the second extracytoplasmic loop of opsin (2Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5038) Google Scholar). Given these intimate contacts, key questions are whether retinal can bind opsin at the early stages of its biogenesis and whether such binding increases the yield of the protein. Retinal binding to opsin may be impaired in some forms of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (ADRP), 1The abbreviations used are: ADRP, autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; WT, wild type; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DM, n-dodecyl-β-maltoside; λmax, visible absorption maxima; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PNGase F, peptide N-glycosidase F; ConA, concanavalin A; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; DAPI, 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole hydrochloride; PCD, protein conformational disease. a group of hereditary disorders that leads to rod photoreceptor death and subsequently to a severe loss of peripheral and night vision (3Dryja T.P.

A. 1991; 88: 6481-6485Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), mutant opsins fall into three classes: Class I mutants bind retinal properly and accumulate at the cell surface; Class II mutants fail to bind retinal, are improperly glycosylated, and accumulate intracellularly; and Class III mutants bind retinal slightly, have less severe glycosylation defects than Class II mutants, and are found both on the cell surface and intracellularly. Class II and III mutants may have defects in the membrane insertion of opsin, opsin folding, retinal binding, or in the stability of the pigment once retinal has bound. A potential strategy to treat ADRP caused by Class II and III rhodopsin mutants is to use retinal as a pharmacological chaperone (10Morello J.P. Petaja-Repo U.E. Bichet D.G. Bouvier M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 466-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), a ligand that corrects the misfolding of a protein by binding specifically to non-native or native forms. Pharmacological chaperones appear to act mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), releasing the proteins they target from the ER quality control machinery and increasing their flux to other cellular compartments (10Morello J.P. Petaja-Repo U.E. Bichet D.G. Bouvier M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 466-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Because opsin stability in vitro is increased by the binding of 11-cis-retinal and other retinoids (11Landin J.S. Katragadda M. Albert A.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11176-11183Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 12Khan S.M. Bolen W. Hargrave P.A. Santoro M.M. McDowell J.H. Eur. J.

Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 256-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), these compounds may act as pharmacological chaperones and increase the yield of Class II and III rhodopsin mutants. In support of this idea, the level of T17M rhodopsin (a Class III mutant (8Kaushal S. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6121-6128Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar)) regenerated from cell membranes increased 10-fold when the protein was expressed in the presence of 11-cis-retinal (14Li T. Sandberg M.A. Pawlyk B.S. Rosner B. Hayes K.C. Dryja T.P. Berson E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11933-11938Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Cell surface expression of the Class III opsin, P23H, was increased in COS-7 cells when 9-cis-retinal was provided (15Saliba R.S. Munro P.M. Luthert P.J. Cheetham M.E. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2907-2918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the addition of a 7-membered ring, locked, non-photoisomerizable form of 11-cis-retinal to P23H opsin during its expression promoted trafficking of the mutant protein and increased the yield of the pigment relative to samples in which retinal was added after cell harvesting (16Noorwez S.M.

Although these studies suggest that they can act as pharmacological chaperones for mutant opsins, further experiments are needed to establish the precise function of retinoids. In this study, we show that the stimulation of P23H pigment production by added retinoids is not limited to the locked retinal used in our earlier work (16Noorwez S.M. Kuksa V. Imanishi Y. Zhu L. Filipek S. Palczewski K. Kaushal S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14442-14450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that yields of the protein can also be increased by 9- or 11-cis-retinal, the native chromophore. As observed with the locked retinal, the mutant pigment was formed efficiently only when retinals were added during opsin expression. We show that 9- and 11-cis-retinal promote trafficking of P23H opsin through the secretory pathway to the cell membrane, indicating that retinals bind the protein at an early stage. Finally, we show for the first time that P23H rhodopsin has a decreased thermal stability relative to wild-type (WT) rhodopsin, providing a partial explanation for the defect in its production. Cell Culture, Regeneration, and Purification of Rhodopsin—Cell lines and growth conditions were described previously (16Noorwez S.M. Kuksa V. Imanishi Y. Zhu L. Filipek S. Palczewski K. Kaushal S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14442-14450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). All steps were carried out under dim red light. Retinals in 100% ethanol were added to a final concentration of 50 μm 2 h after growing cultures were induced with tetracycline (0.5 μg/ml) or after cells were harvested 48 h after induction. Cells were harvested and lysed in PBS (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 137 mm NaCl), pH 7.4, containing 1% n-dodecyl-β-maltoside (DM) (Anatrace), and rhodopsin was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography as described previously (16Noorwez S.M. Kuksa V. Imanishi Y. Zhu L. Filipek S. Palczewski K. Kaushal S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14442-14450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Briefly, rhodopsin in cell lysates was bound to monoclonal antibody 1D4, which recognizes the rhodopsin C terminus, and was coupled to Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). The protein was eluted with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the last 18 amino acid residues of the rhodopsin C terminus in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, or PBS, both containing 0.1% DM. UV-visible spectra of eluted pigments were recorded on a Tidas II spectrophotometer (World Precision Instruments). Visible absorption maxima (λmax) were determined from the peak value of smoothed spectra. The variation in λmax of two to four independently purified samples was less than ±1 nm. Retinoid Analysis—All procedures were carried out under dim red light (>660 nm). Retinoids were analyzed following slight modifications of the procedures of Groenendijk et al. (17Groenendijk G.W. De Grip W.J. Daemen F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 617: 430-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and Smith and Goldsmith (18Smith W.C. Goldsmith T.H. J. Mol. Evol. 1990; 30: 72-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Freshly purified rhodopsin was dried under a stream of nitrogen at room temperature. A 1:1 mixture of methanol and 1 m hydroxylamine, pH 6.5, was added to each sample, and the samples were mixed by vortexing. Then methanol was added to a concentration of 70%, and the samples were mixed again in a 1.7-ml centrifuge tube. Water and dichloromethane were added to yield a 1:1:1 ratio of water:methanol: dichloromethane. The extracts were mixed briefly by vortexing and then centrifuged, and the lower organic phase was collected. The procedure of adding dichloromethane, vortexing, centrifugation, and collection of the lower phase was repeated twice. The collected organic phases were combined and dried under a stream of nitrogen gas. Samples were stored in the dark at -80 °C if they were not analyzed immediately. The residue was dissolved in 1% isopropyl alcohol in hexane, and an aliquot was immediately injected into the HPLC sample and resolved according to the procedure of Smith and Goldsmith (18Smith W.C. Goldsmith T.H. J. Mol. Evol. 1990; 30: 72-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), with detection at 357 nm. SDS Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Purified rhodopsin samples were electrophoresed on 10% SDS polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto Immobilon-NC (Millipore) nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with blocking buffer (Licor), then for 1 h with monoclonal 1D4 antibody, then three times for 5 min each in PBST (PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4), and finally for 1 h with IRDye800-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Rockland, Inc.). Finally the membranes were again washed three times with PBST and scanned in an Odyssey infrared scanner (Licor). For quantifying total opsin, the total cell protein concentration in cell lysates was determined by the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad), with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Equivalent amounts (10.0 μg) of total protein from each sample were electrophoresed, immunoblotted, and scanned as described above. Total opsin was quantified with the Odyssey software. Peptide N-Glycosidase F (PNGase F) Treatment and ConA Blotting— Rhodopsin samples (∼0.1 μg) eluted from 1D4 Sepharose beads were incubated with 2.5 milliunits of recombinant PNGase F (Prozyme) for 2 h at room temperature in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% w/v SDS, 1% v/v Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.0. In an attempt to improve digestion, the following variations of this buffer were explored: a Nonidet P-40 concentration of 2.5 or 5% v/v; a 2-fold increase in both SDS and Nonidet P-40 concentrations; digestion of the reaction with a second aliquot of enzyme in an equal volume of buffer; incubation at 37 °C with an identical buffer measuring pH 7.5 at room temperature; addition of 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol; a preincubation period of up to 5 h in a buffer lacking Nonidet P-40 followed by adjustment of Nonidet P-40 to 1% v/v and addition of enzyme; and the manufacturer's recommended buffers. Untreated samples were identical except that water was added instead of PNGase F. Samples were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and immunoblotted with 1D4 antibody as described above or blotted with 0.001% ConA-biotin (Sigma) in blocking buffer (Licor) followed by a streptavidin-IRdye800 conjugate (Rockland) at a concentration of 0.2 μg/ml in PBST. Immunocytochemistry—Cells were grown on glass coverslips to 50% confluence, and opsin expression was induced by tetracycline. Cells were treated with different retinoids after 2 h of induction. After 24 h of treatment, cells were fixed for 5 min with ice-cold methanol, treated for 5 min with ice-cold acetone, and washed three times with PBS. Cells were blocked with 10% normal goat serum (Sigma) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Cover slips were washed with PBST and were incubated for1hat room temperature with purified 1D4 antibody diluted 1:1000 with PBST. Following incubation, coverslips were rinsed in PBST and incubated with rhodamine (TRITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and DAPI (Molecular Probes). Cells were rinsed in PBST, mounted in 50 μl of anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes) to retard photobleaching, and analyzed with a DMIRE2 Leica microscope. Characterization of Rhodopsins—Photobleaching, hydroxylamine sensitivity, and thermal stability studies were conducted using a Cary 50 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian) and analyzed using Igor Pro software (Wavemetrics). Spectra were corrected for slight base-line displacements by subtracting the average absorbance from 625–650 nm, a frequency range where rhodopsin does not absorb significantly, from the entire spectrum. Photobleaching was performed in 0.1% DM in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, at room temperature using a 150-watt fiber-optic light source (Dolan-Jenner) with a >495 nm filter. Single samples were illuminated for three 10-s intervals, 30 s, and 1 min, with scanning after each period. Hydroxylamine sensitivity was determined as described previously (16Noorwez S.M. Kuksa V. Imanishi Y. Zhu L. Filipek S. Palczewski K. Kaushal S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14442-14450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), except that 1 m hydroxylamine, pH 6.0, was added to purified rhodopsin samples to a final concentration of 40 mm hydroxylamine. Spectra were multiplied by 1.04 to correct for the dilution because of hydroxylamine addition. Thermal stability was measured by obtaining full spectra every 2 min at 37 °Cin 0.1% DM in PBS, pH 7.4. The absorbance value at the absorption maximum was determined, corrected for base-line displacements, and normalized to the absorbance at the initial time point. Values from two independent experiments were averaged and fitted using Igor Pro with a monoexponential function for P23H samples and a linear function for WT samples. Rationale—We showed previously that 11-cis-7-ring but not 11-cis-6-ring or 11-cis-9-demethyl-7-ring retinal increased the yield of P23H rhodopsin if administered during opsin synthesis (16Noorwez S.M.

To test whether simpler retinoids, particularly the native chromophore, are capable of increasing the yield of P23H rhodopsin, we investigated the effects of 9- and 11-cis-retinal. The cellular expression, pigment characteristics, and cellular localization are reported here; full functional characterization of the proteins will be reported elsewhere. Yield and Pigment Characteristics of WT Rhodopsin—Control experiments were conducted first with WT opsin to compare the yield of rhodopsin when retinals were added during opsin expression with the yield of rhodopsin when retinals were added after opsin had been expressed and cells harvested (post-harvest). Forty-eight hours after tetracycline induction, HEK-293 cells expressing WT opsin were harvested and incubated with both 9- and 11-cis-retinals. The rhodopsin formed was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography under conditions that selectively release folded opsin (19Ridge K.D. Lu Z. Liu X. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3261-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and the first eluted fraction was examined by UV-visible spectroscopy and HPLC. The pigment obtained in post-harvest regeneration of WT opsin with 9-cis-retinal has a shifted absorption spectrum with λmax = 487 nm (Fig. 1A, dashed line), whereas the pigment obtained with 11-cis-retinal has the characteristic λmax = 500 nm of native rhodopsin (Fig. 1B, dashed line). When retinals were added under dim red light to the media of cells actively synthesizing WT opsin, the same spectral characteristics of the purified proteins were observed as in the post-harvest regeneration (Fig. 1, A and B, solid lines). The addition of 9-cis-retinal to the growth medium produced a pigment with λmax = 488 nm, whereas 11-cis-retinal produced a pigment with λmax = 500 nm. On acid denaturation (Fig. 1, A and B, insets) both proteins yielded a pigment with a λmax near 440 nm, indicating that retinal is linked as a Schiff base in the native protein (20Kito Y. Suzuki T. Azuma M. Sekoguti Y. Nature. 1968; 218: 955-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These pigments contained 9- and 11-cis-retinal, respectively, as the principal chromophores as shown by HPLC (Fig. 1, E and F). Immunoaffinity purification indicated that the cellular yield of the WT protein was similar whether retinal was added during expression or post-harvest but was ∼30% higher with 9-than with 11-cis-retinal (compare Fig. 1, A and B). To test whether these observations were representative of the total opsin in the cell, the opsin content of detergent-solubilized cell lysates was determined by quantitative immunoblotting. WT opsin yields increased only slightly (1.3- and 1.2-fold for 9- and 11-cis-retinal, respectively) when retinal was added during expression (Table I), results similar to the immunoaffinity purification. The level of WT opsin obtained in experiments with 9-cis-retinal was slightly less than that obtained with 11-cis-retinal (∼0.8-fold) and independent of whether the cofactor was added during expression or post-harvest. Thus, the effects of 9- and 11-cis-retinal on WT opsin and rhodopsin levels are relatively small.Table IRelative opsin yieldsExperimental conditionRelative opsin levelaThe level of WT opsin obtained by adding retinal post-harvest was set to 1.00, and all other samples were normalized to this value.

Values shown represent the average and standard deviation from four independent experimentsb Ratio of the relative opsin level obtained from adding retinal during expression to that obtained post-harvest Open table in a new tab Yield and Pigment Characteristics of P23H Rhodopsin—Parallel experiments were conducted with cells expressing P23H opsin. Cells were first harvested 48 h after induction with tetracycline and regenerated post-harvest with 9- or 11-cis-retinal, and the pigments were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography. The amount of pigment obtained with 9- or 11-cis-retinal (Fig. 1, C and D, dashed lines) was less than 10% of that obtained post-harvest with the WT protein. Strikingly, when the individual retinals were added to cells during expression of P23H opsin, a significant amount of pigment was produced (Fig. 1, C and D, solid lines). The increase in P23H rhodopsin yield was similar for both retinals, reaching levels that were 5-fold (9-cis) and 6-fold (11-cis) higher than the corresponding post-harvest samples (compare Fig. 1, C and D, dashed lines). Although the relative increase was similar for both retinals, the absolute yield of P23H rhodopsin was higher with 9-cis-retinal, typically twice that obtained with 11-cis-retinal (compare Fig. 1, C and D, solid lines). The pigment generated in the presence of 9-cis-retinal has a λmax = 479 nm, whereas the pigment generated in the presence of 11-cis-retinal has a λmax = 492 nm. The 8-nm blue shift in λmax with either 9- or 11-cis-retinal compared with WT rhodopsin suggests that the structure of P23H rhodopsin is slightly altered. The retinal in both P23H pigments is linked as a Schiff base (Fig. 1, C and D, insets). As in the case of the WT pigments, 11-cis-retinal is the major chromophore bound to P23H rhodopsin when 11-cis-retinal is added to the growth medium, whereas 9-cis-retinal predominates in pigments purified from cells grown in the presence of 9-cis-retinal (Fig. 1, G and H). Analysis of the total yields of P23H opsin confirmed the results obtained by immunoaffinity purification. When 9- and 11-cis-retinals were added during expression, the P23H opsin level was increased by 3.5- and 3.4-fold, respectively, compared with the level when retinals were added post-harvest (Table I). Consistent with the increased yield of immunoaffinity purified P23H rhodopsin, P23H opsin levels were ∼50–70% higher with 9-cis-than with 11-cis-retinal (Table I). Glycosylation State of Rhodopsin—To determine whether added retinals act early in rhodopsin biogenesis, we examined the glycosylation state of the purified protein. P23H rhodopsin purified from cells and exposed to 9- or 11-cis-retinal during expression acquires a high molecular mass smear above the major band at 36 kDa (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 4), similar to the WT protein (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 1 and 3). The 36-kDa form (Fig. 2C, band A) and the high molecular mass smear in all samples correspond to glycosylated protein because they are converted by PNGase F to 33 kDa (Fig. 2C, band B) and 30 kDa species (Fig. 2C, band C). Band C (Fig. 2C) is not detected by ConA blotting (Fig. 2D) and therefore corresponds to deglycosylated opsin; band B (Fig. 2C) is more abundant in P23H samples. It is unlikely to be the result of incomplete PNGase F digestion because incubation for 72 h, a second addition of enzyme, or other changes in incubation conditions (see under “Experimental Procedures”) did not significantly alter the digestion pattern. Band B is glycosylated (Fig. 2D), but the glycan is apparently inaccessible or modified and is resistant to PNGase F. Although complete conversion to a deglycosylated form is not observed with PNGase F, the smear is clearly absent. The high molecular mass smear results from glycan modification by the Golgi apparatus (8Kaushal S. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6121-6128Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). These results indicate that when P23H expression is induced in the presence of retinoids, an increased amount of the protein reaches the Golgi and is processed similarly to the WT protein. Thus, when they are added, 9- and 11-cis-retinals must interact with P23H opsin early during its biogenesis in either the ER or the Golgi apparatus. In P23H rhodopsin samples a distinct 28-kDa immunoreactive band is observed (Fig. 2C, band D). This species is not shifted by PNGase F, suggesting that it does not contain an N-linked carbohydrate. Because this species is recognized by the 1D4 antibody, has an apparent molecular mass lower than that of deglycosylated opsin, and is not detected by N-terminal-specific antibody R2–15 (data not shown), it appears to be a degradation product formed by proteolysis near the N terminus. Localization of Opsin—To further test whether added retinals act at an early stage of rhodopsin biogenesis, we examined the distribution of WT and P23H opsin in cells exposed to 9- or 11-cis-retinal during expression of the protein. Immunofluorescence microscopy with 1D4 antibody was used to detect opsin. Control experiments with uninduced WT and P23H cells lack an opsin-specific signal; only the DAPI staining of nuclei is detected (Fig. 3, A and E, blue fluorescence). The WT protein reaches the cell surface in the absence of added retinal (Fig. 3B) or in the presence of either 9- or 11-cis-retinal (Fig. 3, C and D) as observed by the presence of yellow-orange fluorescence on the cell periphery. In contrast, only a little P23H opsin is found at the cell surface in the absence of retinal, and distinct intracellular inclusions are observed (Fig. 3F). The inclusions appear to be aggresomes, 2S. Kaushal, unpublished results. similar to those observed previously in COS-7 and HEK-293 cells (15Saliba R.S. Munro P.M. Luthert P.J. Cheetham M.E. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2907-2918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Illing M.E. Rajan R.S. Bence N.F. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34150-34160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Strikingly, there are fewer inclusions and a substantial increase of P23H opsin at the cell surface with 9- or 11-cis-retinal (Fig. 3, G and H). Thus, adding either of the retinals to cells during opsin expression appears to promote the trafficking of the protein to the cell surface. Characterization of Purified Rhodopsins—The increased yield of P23H rhodopsin in our experiments provides an opportunity to assess the physical and functional properties of the protein in detail. We therefore examined the photosensitivity, hydroxylamine sensitivity, and thermal bleaching of rhodopsin purified from cells to which retinals were added during opsin expression. Illumination with >495 nm light resulted in decreased absorbance in the visible region, indicating that all of the rhodopsin pigments are photoactive (Fig. 4, A–D). A 10-s illumination converted the 9- and 11-cis WT rhodopsin to 380-nm species (Fig. 4, A and B), consistent with the format"

Specific nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzymes have been generally considered to be the primary source of NO in biological systems. These enzymes metabolize arginine to citrulline with the formation of NO, and oxygen is required for this process (8Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 3-11Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1840) Google Scholar, 9Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E. Lowenstein C. Reed R.R. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1991; 351: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2173) Google Scholar). Under severe hypoxic conditions, such as those that occur in ischemic tissues, the NO production from NOS is impaired because of the lack of oxygen. In ischemic tissues, other factors including marked acidosis also impair the function of NOS. More recently, it has been demonstrated that there is another enzymatic pathway of NO generation that does not require oxygen. It has been shown that under anaerobic conditions, XO-mediated nitrite or nitrate reduction can be a prominent source of NO (10Zhang Z. Naughton D. Winyard P.G. Benjamin N. Blake D.R. Symons M.C.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1150-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This pathway is also enhanced under the acidotic conditions that occur during ischemia. Such XO-mediated NO generation can serve as an alternative source of NO under the near anoxic conditions that occur with no-flow ischemia (13Li H. Samouilov A. Liu X. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24482-24489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 14Li H. Samouilov A. Liu X. Zweier J.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1150-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Xanthine oxidase (XO) is a flavoprotein enzyme that is widely distributed in various mammalian tissues. In addition to its FAD binding site, it also has molybdenum and iron sulfur centers. XO plays important roles in both physiological and pathological conditions. It is well known as an important source of superoxide and reactive oxygen species generation (15Zweier J.L. Kuppusamy P. Lutty G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4046-4050Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). More recently, XO-mediated nitrite reduction to NO has been reported under anaerobic conditions. The magnitude and kinetics of this process have been characterized, and it has been shown that under conditions occurring during noflow ischemia, myocardial XO and nitrite levels are sufficient to generate NO at levels comparable with or exceeding those from maximally activated nitric oxide synthases (13Li H. Samouilov A. Liu X. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24482-24489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 14Li H. Samouilov A. Liu X. Zweier J.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1150-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). XO has different site-specific electron donors. Xanthine and 2,3-dihydroxybenz-aldehyde (DBA) serve as electron donors to XO by binding to the molybdenum site, the site at which XO-mediated nitrite reduction occurs (13Li H. Samouilov A. Liu X. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24482-24489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). However, NADH reduces XO at the FAD site of the enzyme, which is the site that also reduces oxygen. Previous studies on XO-mediated nitrite reduction under anaerobic conditions showed that xanthine and DBA are more effective electron donors than NADH (13Li H. Samouilov A. Liu X. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24482-24489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Under aerobic conditions, it is unclear whether significant XO-mediated NO generation would occur because oxygen would be expected to effectively compete with nitrite for reduction by the enzyme. In addition, under aerobic conditions, substrate preference and control could be very different from that in the absence of oxygen. Thus, a number of questions remain regarding the magnitude and mechanism of XO-mediated NO generation in the presence of oxygen and the significance of this process in aerobic biological systems. To investigate the mechanism and effect of oxygen on XO-mediated nitrite reduction, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, chemiluminescence NO analyzer, and NO electrode studies were performed to characterize the kinetics and magnitude of XO-mediated nitrite reduction as a function of oxygen tension. We observe that XO-mediated NO production does occur under aerobic conditions; however, oxygen can exert concentration-dependent inhibition of this NO generation and greatly alter the relative potency of XO-reducing substrates. It was further demonstrated in normoxic heart tissue that XO-mediated NO generation can be observed. Materials—Xanthine oxidase from buttermilk (xanthine, oxygen oxidoreductase; EC1.1.3.22), superoxide dismutase (superoxide, superoxide oxidoreductase; EC1.15.1.1), xanthine, oxypurinol, diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI), sodium nitrite, β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (β-NADH), and 2,3-dithydroxybenz-aldehyde (DBA) were obtained from Sigma. N-methyl-d-glucamine dithiocarbamate (MGD) was synthesized using carbon disulfide and N-methyl-d-glucamine. Ferrous ammonium sulfate was purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co (99.997%). Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was obtained from Invitrogen. EPR Spectroscopy—EPR measurements were performed using a Bruker-IBM ER 300 spectrometer operating at X-band. Measurements were performed using a TM110 microwave cavity at ambient temperature with a modulation frequency of 100 kHz, modulation amplitude of 2.5 G, and microwave power of 20 mW. Samples for EPR spin-trapping measurements of NO were prepared as follows. The reaction solution for nitrite reduction was placed in purging vessel 1, and the NO released was purged out by flow of inert gas (argon) or oxygen mixtures of known concentrations to purging vessel 2 (Fig. 1A). Purging vessel 2 (trap vessel) was filled with aqueous solutions containing the ferrous iron complex of MGD, Fe-MGD, which forms the stable, water-soluble mononitrosyl adduct (MGD)2-Fe2+-NO, that exhibits a characteristic triplet EPR spectrum at g = 2.04 and aN = 12.8. Spin-trap solutions were prepared by adding solid ferrous ammonium sulfate and MGD (molar ratio 1:5) to 5 ml of PBS buffer in the trap vessel with final concentration 2 mm in iron. This setup (Fig. 1A) was designed to isolate the reaction solution in the purging vessel from the spin trap and thus avoid any possible perturbation caused by the reaction of (MGD)2-Fe2+ with nitrite or with the enzyme (16Hiramoto K. Tomiyama S. Kikugawa K. Free Radic. Res. 1997; 27: 505-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 17Tsuchiya K. Yoshizumi M. Houchi H. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1551-1556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Samples from purging vessel 2 were aliquoted at desired times for EPR measurements. Quantitation of NO formation and trapping was performed by double integration of the observed EPR signal with comparison to that from a similar aqueous NO-Fe-MGD standard. NO-Fe-MGD standards were formed by injection of solutions containing known amounts of NO into vessel I with purging to vessel II, which contained the same amount and concentration of Fe-MGD spin trap (using the same gas mixture as the experimental sample). Chemiluminescence Measurements—The rate of NO production was measured using a Sievers 270B nitric oxide analyzer interfaced through a DT2821 A to D board to a PC. In the analyzer, NO was reacted with ozone, forming excited-state NO2, which emitted light that was measured by a photomultiplier tube. Mixing of reagents and purging of NO from the reaction mixture were done at a controlled temperature in a glass-purging vessel equipped with heating jacket and pressure-monitoring device, which allowed the maintenance of atmospheric pressure inside the purging vessel within limits of 1 mm Hg by keeping water levels at the same height by means of adjustment of in and out gas-flow valves (Fig. 1B). The release of NO was quantified by analysis of the digitally recorded signal from the photo-multiplier tube using specially designed data acquisition and analysis software developed in our laboratory. The amount of NO released was determined from the integration of the signal over time compared with that released from nitrite standards added to acetic acid containing 1% KI (18Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Zweier J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 357: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The concentration of nitrite in the samples was determined by reduction to NO and comparison to values obtained from nitrite standards (18Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Zweier J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 357: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Because purging of the released NO was performed using gas mixtures containing variable concentrations of oxygen, studies were performed to estimate the efficiency of purging with these different gas mixtures. Compared with measurements performed with argon (100%), the efficiency of NO measurement with air, 10%, 5%, or 2% oxygen/nitrogen, was 91.9%, 92.5%, 96.3%, or 98.6%, respectively. Results showed that the chemiluminescence linearly increased with NO generation when purging with any of these gas mixtures (γ2 > 99%). Electrochemical Measurements—Electrochemical measurements of NO generation by XO were carried out at 37 °C in an electrochemical vial using a CHI 832 electrochemical detector (CH Instruments, Inc., Cordova, IN) and a WPI NO electrode (Word Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). The electrochemical detector continuously recorded the current through the working electrode, which was proportional to the NO concentration in the solution. The sensor was calibrated before and after the experiments with known concentrations of NO, based on dilutions of NO equilibrated solutions. EPR Measurement of NO Production from Heart Tissue—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250–300 g) were heparinized with 500 units of heparin and anesthetized with intraperitoneal pentobarbital at a dose of 30–35 mg/kg. The hearts were excised and cut into small pieces (∼0.05 g/piece) and then rinsed with HBSS solution (pH 7.0) to wash away blood and intrinsic nitrite/nitrate. This heart tissue (total = 1 g) was suspended in 5 cc HBSS (pH 7.0), purged with 5% oxygen/nitrogen gas mixture, and incubated with [15N]nitrite (10 μm) and with a NOS-inhibitor, 5 mm Nω-nitro-l-arginine. The reaction mixture was placed in a purging vessel and maintained at 37 °C. EPR spin-trapping of released NO was performed as described above using the experimental setup shown in Fig. 1A. Statistical Analysis—Values are expressed as mean ± S.D. of at least three repeated measurements. Statistical significance of difference was evaluated by a Student's t test. p ≤ 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. XO-mediated NO Generation from Nitrite under Aerobic Conditions—NO is paramagnetic and binds with high affinity to the water-soluble spin-trap Fe2+-MGD, forming a mononitrosyl iron complex with characteristic triplet spectrum at g = 2.04, with hyperfine splitting aN = 12.8 gauss. From the intensity of the observed spectrum, measurement of NO generation can be performed (19Xia Y. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18797-18803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 20Zweier J.L. Wang P. Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Nat.

Under aerobic conditions, XO can catalyze the reduction of oxygen, leading to the formation of superoxide anion, ·O–2, which can react with nitric oxide forming peroxynitrite. To prevent the interference of superoxide with the measurement of NO production, SOD was added to quench the ·O–2 in the solution. NO generated by XO-catalyzed nitrite reduction was purged out using compressed air from purging vessel I to purging vessel II (which contained the spin-trap Fe2+-MGD). Mixtures of SOD (400 units/ml), XO (0.02 mg/ml), and its reducing substrate xanthine (0.1 mm) gave rise to no detectable signal (Fig. 2A). In the absence of SOD, preparations of XO (0.02 mg/ml) with nitrite (1 mm) and xanthine (0.1 mm) also gave rise to no signal (Fig. 2B). In the presence of SOD (400 units/ml), however, after mixture of XO with nitrite and its reducing substrates DBA (0.5 mm), xanthine (0.1 mm), or NADH (1 mm), a large NO signal was seen (Fig. 2, C, D, and E). Thus, typical XO-reducing substrates including NADH, 2,3-dihydroxybenz-aldehyde, and xanthine acted as electron donors for XO-catalyzed nitrite reduction and triggered NO generation under aerobic conditions. As reported previously, under anaerobic conditions xanthine is the most effective reducing substrate, whereas NADH is a less effective electron donor for XO-mediated nitrite reduction to NO (13Li H. Samouilov A. Liu X. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24482-24489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). However, under aerobic conditions, NADH stimulated XO-mediated nitrite reduction occurs with a higher magnitude of NO generation than that stimulated by xanthine or DBA (Fig. 2). Electrochemical NO measurements were performed to further confirm the occurrence of NO generation from XO-mediated nitrite reduction under aerobic conditions. Prior to the addition of XO, no detectable NO generation was seen from nitrite (1 mm) in the presence of SOD (400 units/ml) with xanthine (0.02 mm) or NADH (1 mm) as reducing substrates. However, after addition of XO (0.02 mg/ml), NO generation was triggered from xanthine or NADH (Fig. 3, A and B) in the presence of SOD. Under aerobic conditions, the magnitude and rate of NO generation in the presence of NADH (Fig. 3A) was considerably higher than that with xanthine (Fig. 3B). In contrast, under anaerobic conditions, the magnitude of NO generation in the presence of similar concentrations of xanthine was much higher than that with NADH (13Li H. Samouilov A. Liu X. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24482-24489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Thus, both EPR spintrapping and NO electrode studies demonstrated that NADH is the most effective electron donor for XO-mediated NO generation under aerobic conditions. To quantitate the rate of XO-mediated NO generation, further studies were performed with a chemiluminescence NO analyzer. NO was purged out from the solution by compressed air. It was observed that the NADH-stimulated rate of NO generation is higher than the rate of NO generation stimulated by xanthine or DBA under aerobic conditions (Fig. 4). Kinetics of XO-catalyzed Nitric Oxide Generation in the Presence of Site-specific Reducing Substrates—All of the typical reducing substrates of XO can stimulate NO formation from nitrite under aerobic conditions as well as under anaerobic conditions; however, NADH, which is the least effective reducing substrate under anaerobic conditions, was the most potent reducing substrate in the presence of oxygen. To quantitatively describe the effect and further investigate the mechanism of nitrite reduction, chemiluminescence measurements of the rate of NO production were performed using different site-specific reducing substrates under different oxygen tensions. NO formation from XO-catalyzed nitrite reduction was measured with continuous purging with air, 10, 5, or 2% oxygen, corresponding to oxygen concentrations in solution at 37 °C of 214, 102, 51, and 20 μm, respectively. Both xanthine and DBA provide electrons to XO at the molybdenum site, the same site of nitrite binding to the enzyme. For xanthine or DBA as reducing substrates, the rate of XO-mediated NO formation was determined as a function of nitrite concentration, and Michaelis-Menten kinetics were observed. Lineweaver-Burk plots characterized the shift of Km value by oxygen and demonstrated that oxygen is a competitive inhibitor to nitrite in XO-mediated nitrite reduction (Fig. 5, A and B). With xanthine as reducing substrate, the Km values of nitrite, obtained from fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation, increased from 11.9, 23.4, and 39.2 to 58.6 mm with the increase of pO2 upon purging with 2, 5, 10% oxygen or air (21% oxygen), whereas Vmax values remained at about 9.0 nmol s–1 mg–1 (Fig. 5A). With DBA as reducing substrate, the Km values for nitrite increased from 10.0, 17.3, and 30.2 to 48.5 mm with the increase of pO2, whereas Vmax values remained at about 4.2 nmol s–1 mg–1 (Fig. 5B). NADH reacts with XO at the FAD site of the enzyme. With NADH as electron donor and purging with air, NO generation rates from nitrite do not follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Fig. 6B). Aerobic NO generation rates from nitrite were maintained at more than 70% of anaerobic levels (Fig. 6A). For 1 mm nitrite with XO (0.02 mg/ml), NADH (1 mm), and SOD (400 units/ml) for reactions in 21, 10, 5, or 2% oxygen or in argon, the rates of NO generation were 0.22 ± 0.01, 0.25 ± 0.01, 0.27 ± 0.01, and 0.29 ± 0.02 or 0.30 ± 0.03 nmol s–1 mg–1, respectively. The rate of NO generation decreased with the increase of pO2 when NADH was the reducing substrate; however, even in air, prominent NO production was still present. Effects of Site-specific Inhibitors on XO-mediated NO Generation under Aerobic Conditions—The effects of site-specific inhibition of XO were studied to investigate the reaction mechanisms in the process of the XO-catalyzed nitrite reduction under aerobic conditions. Oxypurinol binds to the molybdenum site of XO. Over the range of oxygen tensions studied, it was observed that oxypurinol inhibited the NO generation triggered by xanthine, DBA, or NADH. Addition of the FAD site-specific inhibitor, DPI, strongly inhibited XO-mediated NO generation, with NADH serving as reducing substrate; with xanthine or DBA as reducing substrates, NO generation was increased more than six times (Fig. 7). This result suggests that disruption of the flavin by DPI inhibited the binding and transfer of electrons to oxygen by XO, thus greatly inhibiting XO-mediated oxygen reduction. Thus, DPI blocked oxygen reduction by the enzyme and this, in turn, greatly increased its competitive reaction of nitrite reduction. Effects of pH on XO-catalyzed NO Generation—To assess the NO formation under different physiological or pathological conditions and to further characterize the mechanism of XO-catalyzed nitrite reduction, experiments were performed to measure the effect of different pH values on the magnitude of XO-mediated NO generation under aerobic conditions. As shown in Table I, it was observed for each of the three reducing substrates, xanthine, NADH, and 2,3-dihydroxybenz-aldehyde, that pH 5 is the condition of maximal NO generation. Under aerobic conditions, NO generation increased more than three times as the pH value decreased from 7.4 to 6.0, and another three times as pH decreased from 6 to 5.0 (Table I).Table IEffect of pH on NO generation rate under aerobic conditionsNO generation ratepH 5.0pH 6.0pH 7.4pH 8.0nmol/mg/sNADH (1 mm)2.44 ± 0.220.68 ± 0.040.22 ± 0.010.04 ± 0.01Xanthine (20 μm)1.89 ± 0.230.56 ± 0.070.15 ± 0.020.05 ± 0.01DBA (0.5 mm)1.16 ± 0.160.36 ± 0.050.08 ± 0.010.03 ± 0.01 Open table in a new tab XO-mediated NO Generation from Nitrite in Heart Tissue—In mammalian organs under normoxic conditions, O2 concentration ranges from 10 to <0.5%, with values of ∼14% in arterial blood and <5% in the myocardium. During mild hypoxia, myocardial O2 levels drop to ∼1–3% or lower (22Roy S. Khanna S. Bickerstaff A.A. Subramanian S.V. Atalay M. Bierl M. Pendyala S. Levy D. Sharma N. Venojarvi M. Strauch A.

Acta. 1999; 1411: 250-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). To determine whether nitrite can be reduced to form NO in tissues and to ascertain the role of XO in this process under aerobic conditions, studies were performed in heart tissue in the presence of [15N]nitrite, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Rat heart tissue was isolated, cut into pieces (∼50 mg), suspended in HBSS (pH 7.0), and purged with 5% oxygen/95% nitrogen. The tissue was rinsed to remove blood, thus preventing foam formation during purging. This also served to minimize the intrinsic nitrite/nitrate concentrations. NOS-inhibitor Nω-nitro-l-arginine (5 mm) was added to prevent possible NO generation from l-arginine. NO production from [15N]nitrite in the heart tissue was measured by EPR spectroscopy. 15NO gives a characteristic doublet 15NO-Fe2+-MGD spectrum, rather than the triplet observed with naturally abundant 14NO, thus enabling direct and selective detection of nitrite-derived NO formation. In the absence of tissue, no signal was seen from 20 μm nitrite with 400 units of SOD and 5 mm Nω-nitro-l-arginine (Fig. 8A). However, upon addition of 1 g of heart tissue, a 15NO signal was seen (Fig. 8B). With the addition of the XO inhibitor oxypurinol, the 15NO-Fe-MGD signal was quenched more than 60% (Fig. 8C). In the presence of 2% oxygen, the level of NO generation was more than 50% higher than that at 5% (Fig. 8D). Thus, XO-mediated nitrite reduction can be a source of NO in heart tissue under conditions of tissue normoxia, and it is further increased with mild hypoxia. It has been reported recently that XO catalyzes reduction of nitrite to NO under hypoxic conditions (10Zhang Z. Naughton D. Winyard P.G. Benjamin N. Blake D.R. Symons M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1150-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and the kinetics of this process have been characterized. It is clear that XO-mediated nitrite and nitrate reduction occurs and can be an important source of NO, particularly under conditions of limited tissue perfusion and resulting acidosis (13Li H. Samouilov A. Liu X. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24482-24489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 14Li H. Samouilov A. Liu X. Zweier J.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1150-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, questions remained regarding whether XO-mediated NO generation also occurs in the presence of oxygen, and the regulation, mechanism, and quantitative importance of this process in biological systems had not been characterized. Therefore, we performed a series of studies using EPR, chemiluminescence NO analyzer, and NO electrode techniques to measure the magnitude and kinetics of XO-mediated NO formation under different oxygen tensions. Experimental data obtained using each of these methods confirmed that XO does reduce nitrite to NO under aerobic conditions. Three typical reducing substrates of XO triggered NO generation from XO-mediated nitrite reduction (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5); however, the kinetics of XO-mediated NO formation are quite different in the presence of molybdenum-site binding substrates xanthine or DBA, compared with that in the presence of the FAD-site binding substrate NADH (Figs. 5 and 6). With xanthine or DBA as reducing substrates that donate electrons to XO at the molybdenum site of enzyme, the rate of NO production followed typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and kinetic studies show that oxygen acts as a strong competitive inhibitor of nitrite reduction (Fig. 5).

Although several groups have examined the functions of CERK and its product C1P, the functions of C1P and CERK are not understood. We studied the RBL-2H3 cell line, a widely used model for mast cells, and found that CERK and C1P are required for activation of the degranulation process in mast cells. We found that C1P formation was enhanced during activation induced by IgE/antigen or by Ca2+ ionophore A23187. The formation of C1P required the intracellular elevation of Ca2+. We generated RBL-2H3 cells that stably express CERK, and when these cells were treated with A23187, a concomitant C1P formation was observed and degranulation increased 4-fold, compared with mock transfectants. The cell-permeable N-acetylsphingosine (C2-ceramide), a poor substrate of CERK, inhibited both the formation of C1P and degranulation, indicating that C1P formation was necessary for degranulation. Exogenous introduction of CERK into permeabilized RBL-2H3 cells caused degranulation. We identified a cytosolic localization of CERK that provides exposure to cytosolic Ca2+.

Mast cells mediate inflammation and hypersensitivity by releasing bioactive molecules stored in their cytoplasmic granules. Stimulation through the cross-linking of IgE, bound to its mast cell receptor FcϵRI, triggers a series of biochemical events, including an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ and activation of both nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases and phospholipases (1Metzger H. Alcaraz G. Hohman R. Kinet J.P. Probluda V. Quarto R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1986; 4: 419-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). These cellular events culminate in the exocytosis of granular content. Mast cell degranulation has been the subject of many studies, however, mainly focused on the early signaling steps that follow receptor activation (2Benhamou M. Siraganian R.P. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 195-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In contrast, little is known about the late events regulating degranulation. In the present study, we focused on this later stage, especially on events downstream of Ca2+ signaling. The Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin has been shown to be involved in antigen-mediated phospholipase D activation in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3 cells) (3Kumada T. Nakashima S. Nakamura Y. Miyata H. Nozawa Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1258: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II reportedly plays an important role in exocytosis (4Ohyama A. Hosaka K. Komiya Y.

However, known inhibitors or antagonists for calmodulin and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II cannot completely inhibit degranulation (3Kumada T. Nakashima S. Nakamura Y. Miyata H. Nozawa Y.

Sphingolipids are ubiquitous constituents of eukaryotic cells with essential roles in cell growth, survival, and death (6Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. Adv. Lipid.

Sphingolipid metabolites include second messengers sphingosine (Sph), sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), ceramide (Cer), and ceramide 1-phosphate (C1P), all of which are involved in common signaling pathways controlling cell development, differentiation, activation, proliferation, and function (8Igarashi Y.

Mast cell activation is regulated by the balance of Sph and S1P (11Spiegel S. Milstien S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar), and S1P alone is thought to be involved in Ca2+ signaling following antigen stimulation (12Prieschl E.E. Csonga R. Novotny V.

Cer is the precursor for all sphingolipids and functions as a second messenger in a variety of cellular events including apoptosis and cell differentiation (9Perry D.K. Hannun Y.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), and its intracellular level is tightly controlled. Many bioactive agents stimulate neutral sphingomyelinase, which degrades sphingomyelin to Cer. The two enzymes that metabolize ceramide are ceramidase that converts Cer to Sph and a fatty acid. Since Sph is not produced by de novo synthesis (15Michel C. van Echten-Deckert G. Rother J. Sandhoff K. Wang E. Merrill A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22432-22437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), ceramidase is crucial for its generation and that of its catabolite S1P, which can regulate cell growth (16Oliver A. Spiegel S. Nature. 1993; 365: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar) and motility (17Kupperman E. An S. Osborne N. Waldron S. Stainier D.Y.R.

The second enzyme is CERK, which phosphorylates Cer to produce C1P, which was initially described as a Ca2+-stimulated lipid kinase that copurified with brain synaptic vesicles (19Bajjalieh S.M. Martin T.F.J. Floor E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14354-14360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CERK activity has also been reported in HL60 cells (20Dressler K.A. Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14917-14921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and neutrophils (21Rile G. Yatomi Y. Takafuta T. Ozaki Y. Acta Haematol. (Basel). 2003; 109: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, there are no reports at present ascribing the biological function of CERK in mast cells. Based on its sequence homology to sphingosine kinase type 1, CERK was cloned in 2002 (22Sugiura M. Kono K. Liu H. Shimizugawa T. Minekura H. Spiegel S. Kohama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23294-23300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The functions of CERK and C1P have been examined by several groups. CERK is involved in phagolysosome formation in polymorphonuclear leukocytes and also in liposome fusion (23Hinkovska-Galcheva V.T. Boxer L.A. Mansfield P.J. Harsh D. Blackwood A. Shayman J.A. J.

Veldhoven P.P.V. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), although when exogenously added it was hydrolyzed rapidly by phosphatases (25Boudker O. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22150-22155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, C1P was found to induce arachidonic acid release and prostanoid synthesis (26Pettus B.J. Bielawska A.

Chem. 2003; 278: 38206-38213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), although many of these experiments were based on exogenously added C1P. In the present study, we investigated cellular CERK/C1P functions by increasing the intracellular level of C1P through the expression of the CERK gene. By using this approach we revealed a previously unknown function for CERK in mast cell degranulation. Materials—Ceramide (C18:0, d18:1), N-acetylsphingosine (C2-Cer), cardiolipin, G418, p-nitrophenyl N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide (PNP-GlcNAc), streptolysin O, 1,4-diazobicyclo[2.2.2]octane, A23187, anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2), and anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody were all purchased from Sigma. [32P]ATP and [3H]Sph were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and American Radiolabeled Chemicals, respectively. All reagents were of the highest purity available. Cell Culture and Degranulation Assay—Rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells and transfectants were cultured as monolayers in Eagle's minimum essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. For degranulation assays, cells were harvested and washed with Tyrode's buffer (25 mm PIPES (pH 7.2), 119 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.4 mm MgSO4, 5.6 mm glucose, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)). The cells were stimulated at 37 °C with the indicated concentrations of the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. For IgE/antigen stimulation, 107 cells were incubated with 1 μg of anti-DNP IgE for 1 h at room temperature and then stimulated with 1 μg/ml DNP-BSA for 1 h at 37 °C. After stimulation, the cells were centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min, and β-hexosaminidase activity was measured in both the supernatant and cell pellet, using PNP-GlcNAc as a chromogenic substrate (27Yamashita T. Yamaguchi T. Murakami K. Nagasawa S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Anti-DNP IgE was prepared as described in Ref. 27Yamashita T. Yamaguchi T.

Plasmid Construction and Cell Transfection—A FLAG epitope tag was introduced into the HindIII-BamHI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) as described previously (28Kohno T. Wada A. Igarashi Y. FASEB J. 2002; 13: 893-992Google Scholar). Murine CERK was subcloned into this pcDNA3-FLAG vector using a 5′ primer with a BamHI restriction site (5′-CGGGATCCATGGGGGCAATGGGGGCG-3′) and as the 3′ primer with an EcoRI site (5′-GGAATTCTTATACTCTTCCTCGATTCCC-3′). This plasmid (20 μg) was transfected into 5 × 106 RBL-2H3 cells by electroporation, GenePulser (Bio-Rad) (960 microfarads, 250 V), as described elsewhere (29Murakami K. Sato S. Nagasawa S. Yamashita T. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Clones were selected with 600 μg/ml G418 (Sigma). We obtained six independent stable clones expressing the CERK protein. CERK Assays—The kinase activity of CERK was assayed as described by Bajjalieh et al. (19Bajjalieh S.M. Martin T.F.J. Floor E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14354-14360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with some modifications. Briefly, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 40 mm KCl, and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The lysate was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in a reaction mixture containing 20 mm HEPES, 80 mm KCl, 3 mm CaCl2, 1 mm cardiolipin, 1.5% β-octyl glucoside, 0.2 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, and 40 mm Cer (C18:0, d18:1). Lipids were extracted and separated on Silica Gel 60 high performance TLC (HPTLC) plates (Merck) using chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (10:4:3:2:1, v/v) as the solvent system. Bands were quantified using imaging analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji Film). PLD Assays—PLD activity was measured as described in Ref. 30Nakamura Y. Nakashima S. Ojio K. Banno Y. Miyata H. Nozawa Y. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 256-262PubMed Google Scholar. Metabolic Labeling of Cells—Cells (106) were incubated with 2 μCi of carrier-free [32P]orthophosphoric acid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 37 °C in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 90 min. After incubation, the cells were harvested and washed twice with Tyrode's buffer. Subsequently, the cells were stimulated at 37 °C with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 for the indicated time. Reactions were terminated by adding 7 volumes of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v). Two phases were generated by adding 1.6 volumes of 1 m KCl. The organic phase was dried and subjected to a mild alkaline treatment to remove glycerophospholipids as described (20Dressler K.A. Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14917-14921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipids were re-extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (31Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar). [32P]C1P was detected by HPTLC using the same method as described above. To label cellular sphingolipids, cells (106) were incubated with 1 μCi of [3H]Sph at 37 °C for 30 min in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Stimulation with ionophore and lipid extraction were performed using the same method as described above, without the mild alkaline treatment. Radioactive sphingolipids were visualized using autoradiography on Kodak X-Omat film with exposure at -80 °C for 1–3 days. Immunochemical Studies—For immunoprecipitation, harvested cells were lysed for 10 min at 4 °C in IP buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Tween 20, and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min, primary antibody was added to the supernatant, and samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Antibody complexes were precipitated by incubation with protein G-agarose FF (Amersham Biosciences) in IP buffer for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted, washed three times in IP buffer, and taken up in SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and transferred onto a polyvinyldifluoride membrane (33Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). After 1 h of treatment with 3% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20 (TBST), membranes were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG antibody at 4 °C overnight. After a wash with TBST, the membrane was incubated for 2 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. After another wash with TBST, the membranes were developed using the ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized by using x-ray firm. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells using TRIzol™ solution (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcriptase, Superscript II (Invitrogen). The single strand cDNA was used as template for PCR with sense (5′-AGGAGACTTTATACGAGATCA-3′) and antisense primers (5′-GACTCGATAAACTTCAACGAA-3′), using a GeneAmp PCR 9700 system (Applied Biosystems) employing AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems). The PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 20 s, 52 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, and 30 cycles were used. Cell Permeabilization and Stimulation—Permeabilization of cells was performed using streptolysin O as described previously (34Howell T.W. Gomperts B.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 927: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Permeabilized cells were incubated with the purified CERK for 30 min at 37 °C and were subjected immediately to the degranulation assay. The CERK and control (mock) were prepared from CERK- or mock-transfected CHO cells (35Mitsutake S. Tani M. Nozomu O. Mori K. Ichinose S. Omori A. Iida H. Nakamura T. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26249-26259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), by lysis and immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody as described above. The bound CERK was eluted with 100 mm citrate buffer (pH 2.7), followed by neutralization with 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5). The Sepharose resin was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was used. Preparation of Recombinant CERK and Generation of Polyclonal Antibodies—The open reading frame of the CERK gene was cloned in-frame into the pGEX 4T3 (Amersham Biosciences). The Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) was transformed with the construct. The recombinant protein was obtained from 100 ml of culture and purified by SDS-PAGE. From a rabbit immunized with the purified recombinant CERK, antiserum was obtained and purified using a GST-CERK-coupled to N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated HiTrap column (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Localization of Intracellular CERK—The open reading frame of the CERK gene was amplified and cloned in-frame into the pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) plasmids and transfected to RBL-2H3 cells using LipofectAMINE™2000 (Invitrogen). After overnight incubation, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed, and permeabilized for 10 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3.7% formaldehyde and 0.2% Triton X-100. Anti-CERK antibody was incubated with the cells overnight at 4 °C. The cells were washed and incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes). For colocalization studies, the cells were incubated with anti-GM130 (Transduction Laboratories), anti-KDEL (StressGen Biotechnologies), or anti-serotonin (Dako Cytomation) antibodies overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with Alexa 594-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) or Alexa-594-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) for 2 h at room temperature. The coverslips were mounted using 90% (w/v) glycerol containing 25% (w/v) 1,4-diazobicyclo[2.2.2]octane, and the cells were visualized by confocal fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss, LSM510). Ca2+-induced Mast Cell Activation Increases C1P—We examined the expression of CERK in RBL-2H3 cells, and we detected CERK mRNA expression using reverse transcriptase-PCR (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, we were able to detect CERK activity using an in vitro kinase assay with [32P]ATP (Fig. 1B). These results established that CERK is present in RBL-2H3 cells. We next examined whether the amount of C1P changed when RBL-2H3 cells were activated by IgE cross-linking. The cells were incubated with [32P]orthophosphoric acid and DNP-specific IgE for 90 min and then stimulated with antigen (DNP-BSA) to induce cross-linking. At different time points, lipids were extracted, and a mild alkaline hydrolysis was performed to remove glycerophospholipids. Lipids were separated on HPTLC, and the bands corresponding to [32P]C1P were quantified by BAS2000 image analyzer (Fuji Film, Japan). The amount of C1P increased by ∼1.2-fold in response to IgE/antigen stimulation (Fig. 1C). CERK is known to be a Ca2+-activated lipid kinase. This raised the possibility that the C1P increases might be because of Ca2+-mediated activation of CERK. Antigen-mediated cross-linking of the IgE receptor FcϵRI causes the rapid elevation of intracellular Ca2+, which is indispensable in the degranulation of mast cells. The Ca2+ ionophore A23187 is a well known inducer of degranulation in mast cells that acts by elevating the intracellular concentrations of Ca2+, mimicking the effect observed in activated mast cells (36Wightman R.M. Troyer K.P. Mundorf M.L. Catahan R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 971: 620-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). By using this reagent, we can exclude any complicated pathways that exist between FcϵRI and Ca2+ release and can focus downstream of the Ca2+signaling. Next, we examined whether the amount of C1P changed upon mast cell activation induced by A23187. RBL-2H3 cells were labeled with [3H]Sph for 10 min and then treated with A23187 for 30 min. C1P levels in A23187-treated cells increased as compared with those of untreated cells (Fig. 2A). To eliminate the possibility that Sph uptake was enhanced by Ca2+, [32P]orthophosphoric acid labeling was also performed. A23187 caused a 3-fold increase in C1P formation (Fig. 2B). Degranulation in the A23187-treated RBL-2H3 cells was confirmed by β-hexosaminidase assay of the culture supernatants (Fig. 2C) and was inhibited by the chelator EGTA. C1P formation was also blocked in the presence of EGTA (Fig. 2A). These results support the contention that the C1P formation was dependent on an intracellular elevation of Ca2+. Because CERK has been shown to be activated by Ca2+ (19Bajjalieh S.M. Martin T.F.J. Floor E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14354-14360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Dressler K.A. Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14917-14921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sugiura M. Kono K. Liu H. Shimizugawa T. Minekura H. Spiegel S. Kohama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23294-23300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), and the degranulation of mast cells requires elevated intracellular Ca2+ levels, it was reasonable to consider a role for CERK in the Ca2+-dependent degranulation pathway in mast cells. Ca2+-dependent Activation of CERK in Mast Cells—To investigate the role of CERK in degranulation in mast cells, RBL-2H3 cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged CERK were generated. Six independent clones were selected. Of these, RBL-CK3 and RBL-CK4 expressed the highest levels of CERK determined by Western blot (Fig. 3A). CERK activity was measured using an in vitro kinase assay. The CERK activity in the RBL-CK3 clone was ∼250 times higher and in the RBL-CK4 clone was 50 times higher than that in the parent cells (Fig. 3B). In a previous report, CERK was shown to be activated by Ca2+ using a partially purified enzyme (19Bajjalieh S.M. Martin T.F.J. Floor E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14354-14360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a lysate from CERK-overexpressing cells (22Sugiura M. Kono K. Liu H. Shimizugawa T. Minekura H. Spiegel S. Kohama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23294-23300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In our experiment, immunoprecipitated CERK was directly activated by Ca2+ without addition of cytosol (Fig. 4A). Next, we examined Ca2+-dependent degranulation in the newly established clones. RBL-2H3 cells and mock and CERK transfectants were treated with 0.1 μm A23187 for 30 min. A23187 induced degranulation in RBL-2H3 cells, and this degranulation was completely blocked by the addition of EGTA (Fig. 4B). In RBL-CK3 and -CK4 clones, the extent of degranulation increased after treatment with A23187 compared with that observed in either parent or mock-transfected cells. Nevertheless, this increased degranulation was completely blocked by 2 mm EGTA indicating that the increased degranulation remained fully Ca2+-dependent (Fig. 4B). Overexpression of CERK apparently enhanced Ca2+ sensitivity, resulting in higher extent of degranulation. The extent of degranulation was higher for RBL-CK3 (4.5 times over parent cells) than for RBL-CK4 (2.9 times), correlating with their CERK activities (Fig. 3B). These results strongly support the involvement of CERK in Ca2+-dependent mast cell degranulation. Next, we determined whether CERK overexpression leads to elevated C1P level. RBL-CK3 cells were labeled with [3H]Sph for 30 min and incubated with or without 0.1 μm A23187 and 2 mm EGTA. The addition of A23187 caused an increase in [3H]C1P formation, and this increase was blocked by the addition of EGTA (Fig. 5A), the same tendency observed in parental RBL-2H3 cells (Fig. 2A). To compare the C1P formation in CERK-transfected cells to that in parent or mock-transfected cells, the clones were incubated with carrier-free [32P]orthophosphoric acid for 90 min at 37 °C and incubated with 0.1 μm A23187 for various times. Lipids were extracted, and glycerophospholipids were removed by mild alkaline hydrolysis. The [32P]C1P bands seemed likely to contain several bands. Because acid hydrolysis of these lipids produced a single 32P-S1P band (not shown), several bands of [32P]C1P were due to its heterogeneity in the fatty acid moiety of ceramide. After a 30-min activation, the [32P]C1P levels in RBL-CK3 and RBL-CK4 were 12.0 and 9.4 times higher, respectively, than that of wild type RBL-2H3 cells (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that A23187-induced degranulation is accompanied by increased C1P formation in these clones. Inhibition of C1P Formation Causes Decreased Degranulation in Mast Cells—The cell-permeable N-acetylsphingosine (C2-Cer) is commonly used in studying Cer signaling. PLD plays an important role in the degranulation pathway induced by IgE/antigen, and its inhibition causes a decrease in the degranulation pathway induced by IgE/antigen (37Choi W.S. Chahdi A. Kim Y.M. Fraundorfer P.F. Beaven M.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 968: 198-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In mast cells, C2-Cer is known to inhibit IgE-induced degranulation by inhibiting PLD (30Nakamura Y. Nakashima S. Ojio K. Banno Y. Miyata H. Nozawa Y. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 256-262PubMed Google Scholar, 38Mansfield P.J. Hinkovska-Galcheva V. Carey S.S. Shayman J.A. Boxer L.A. Blood. 2002; 99: 1434-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), likely via a protein kinase C isozyme and adenosine 5′-diphosphate ribosylation factor (39Abousalham A. Liosis C. O'Brien L. Brindrey D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1069-1075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, although C2-Cer inhibits PLD activation induced by IgE/antigen, Ca2+ ionophore-induced PLD activation is not inhibited by C2-Cer (30Nakamura Y. Nakashima S. Ojio K. Banno Y. Miyata H. Nozawa Y. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 256-262PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the inhibitory effect of C2-Cer on PLD activation may depend on molecules that act upstream of the Ca2+ release. With this in mind, we examined the effect of C2-Cer on PLD activation in RBL-2H3 cells induced by A23187, but we found no inhibition (Fig. 6A). Therefore, the inhibitory effect of C2-Cer on PLD is not involved in A23187-induced degranulation. We then examined the effect of C2-Cer in degranulation induced by A23187 in RBL-2H3 and RBL-CK3 cells, and we found that 50 μm of C2-Cer inhibited this degranulation (Fig. 6B, hatched bars). We also examined the C1P formation and found that preincubation with 50 μm C2-Cer dramatically decreased the formation of [32P]C1P (Fig. 6C). The inhibition of C2-Cer on β-hexosaminidase release and C1P formation occurred concomitantly in all four clones. These results suggest that inhibition of C1P formation leads to a decrease in degranulation. Although C2-Cer has been shown to be a poor substrate for CERK (22Sugiura M. Kono K. Liu H. Shimizugawa T. Minekura H. Spiegel S. Kohama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23294-23300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), C2-Cer 1-phosphate production was also detected (not shown). These results indicate that inhibition of endogenous generation of C1P is accompanied by a decrease in degranulation. They further suggest that CERK is one of the targets of C2-Cer leading to inhibition of degranulation. Introduction of Exogenous CERK Protein Causes Degranulation in RBL-2H3 Cells—Phospholipases have a critical role in degranulation, so the addition of exogenous PLD or phospholipase C is sufficient to trigger degranulation in SLO-permeabilized RBL-2H3 cells (40Brown H.A. Cohen J.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6589-6597Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We introduced exogenous CERK into SLO-permeabilized cells. The enzyme and a control protein were prepared from CERK- or mock-transfected CHO cells by immunoprecipitation, and the CERK activity of each sample was confirmed by in vitro kinase assays (Fig. 7A). The activity of the immunoprecipitated enzyme was destroyed by boiling in some samples (Fig. 7A, lane 3). β-Hexosaminidase release was enhanced only in those cells that were exposed to active CERK (Fig. 7B, lane 2) but not in those treated with the boiled enzyme (lane 3). Furthermore, because a control sample prepared from mock-transfected cells failed to enhance β-hexosaminidase release (lane 1), the degranulation caused by the immunoprecipitated CERK-treated cells was not due to other proteins present in the sample. These results strongly suggest that the enzymatic activity of CERK elicits degranulation in these cells. Cytosolic Localization of CERK in RBL-2H3—Although the gene encoding CERK was identified recently, the cellular localization of this enzyme has not been characterized. To elucidate the subcellular distribution of CERK, we raised an anti-CERK antibody (IgG) in rabbits using recombinant CERK expressed in E. coli. The specificity of our anti-CERK antibody was examined by Western blotting (Fig. 8A). Bands consistent with the molecular weight of CERK were clearly seen in the lysate from CERK-transfected CHO cells (lane 1), but not in the lysate from mock-transfected (lane 2). Thus, this antibody was confirmed to bind to CERK specifically. By using this antibody, we examined the intracellular localization of CERK. CERK was stained with the anti-CERK antibody, and the staining pattern was compared with that of other antigens commonly used as markers of specific intracellular compartments. Specific antibodies were used in separate samples to stain the endoplasmic reticulum (KDEL), Golgi apparatus (GM130), secretory granules (serotonin), or filamentous actin (phalloidin). Some areas of colocalization were observed with the endoplasmic reticulum, as shown in the merged images (Fig. 8B-a). Little colocalization of CERK was observed with Golgi apparatus (Fig. 8B-b), secretory granules (Fig. 8B-c), or plasma membrane (Fig. 8B-d). However, in some cells we found strong CERK expressed in the plasma membrane (Fig. 8B-e). According to our data base searches, no distinct signal sequence or organelle retention signals could be found in the amino acid sequence of CERK. In a previous report, the major activity of CERK was recovered in the membrane fraction (22Sugiura M. Kono K. Liu H. Shimizugawa T. Minekura H. Spiegel S. Kohama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23294-23300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). However, in RBL-2H3 cells, CERK was predominantly localized in the cytosol along with more than 70% of the CERK activity (data not shown). Because some cells expressed this enzyme in the plasma membrane, the localization of CERK may be regulated by some stimuli. Many early studies of C1P function relied on the use of exogenous C1P. Recently, the cDNA encoding CERK was cloned, providing new tools for the elucidation of the intracellular functions of CERK/C1P signaling axis. In the present study, we generated RBL-2H3 clones, which stably express CERK (RBL-CK3 and RBL-CK4). These clones exhibited a high extent of degranulation when it was induced by a Ca2+ ionophore. The elevated degranulation in the CERK transfectants paralleled the C1P formation in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Additionally, both were inhibited by cell-permeable C2-Cer, a synthetic Cer analog. Introduction of CERK protein into permeabilized cells was enough to induce degranulation of mast cells. These results strongly indicate the involvement of CERK in degranulation of mast cells. Although C2-Cer is known to be a poor substrate of CERK (22Sugiura M. Kono K. Liu H. Shimizugawa T. Minekura H. Spiegel S. Kohama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23294-23300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), some formation of C2-C1P was observed (data not shown). These observations suggest that the conversion of endogenous Cer to C1P influences the properties of the membrane during degranulation. An elegant study by Shayman and co-workers (23Hinkovska-Galcheva V.T. Boxer L.A. Mansfield P.J. Harsh D. Blackwood A. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33203-33209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) demonstrated that CERK plays an important role in phagolysosome formation in neutrophils. They also provided evidence that the addition of exogenous C1P promotes liposome fusion. Their data strongly suggest that the conversion of Cer to C1P alters membrane fusogenicity resulting in enhanced vesicle fusion. In the present study, we found that Ca2+-dependent C1P formation was involved in the degranulation pathway of mast cells. The degranulation process includes the fusion of the plasma membrane with the secretory granules. Our findings can be explained by an alteration in membrane fusogenicity elicited by an increase in C1P. Most of the biological effects of C2-Cer are structurally specific and cannot be reproduced by C2-dihydro-Cer; this includes the inhibitory effect on degranulation. Most interesting, the inhibitory effect of C2-Cer on C1P formation also could not be reproduced by either C2-dihydro-Cer or Sph (data not shown). In this regard, the inhibition of degranulation by C2-Cer completely coincides with its inhibitory effect on C1P formation and is consistent with the inhibition of CERK. C2-Cer is commonly used in studying intracellular Cer effects, and there are several presumed targets for C2-Cer including protein kinase C isozymes, PLD (39Abousalham A. Liosis C. O'Brien L. Brindrey D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1069-1075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (41Burow M.E. Weldon C.B. Collins-Burow B.M. Ramsey N. McKee A. Klippel A. McLachlan J.A. Clejan S. Beckman B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9628-9635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Here we provided the first demonstration that CERK might be a target of C2-Cer during inhibition of mast cell degranulation. C1P may alternatively act as a lipid second messenger. A recent study (26Pettus B.J. Bielawska A. Spiegel S. Roddy P. Hannun A.H. Chalfant C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38206-38213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) revealed that C1P induced arachidonic acid release and activated prostanoid synthesis. C1P was also shown to stimulate DNA synthesis in fibroblasts (24Gijsbers S. Mannaerts G.P. Himpens B. Veldhoven P.P.V. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In our experiments, C1P played an essential role in the downstream signaling of Ca2+. Recently, soluble N-ethylmaleimide attachment protein receptors and associated regulators have been shown to control the Ca2+-dependent exocytosis in RBL-2H3 cells (42Blank U. Cyproen B. Martin-Verdeaux S. Paumet F. Pombo I. Rivera J. Roa M. Vari-Blank N. Mol. Immunol. 2001; 38: 1341-1345Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is of interest whether C1P may in some fashion control these soluble N-ethylmaleimide attachment protein receptor proteins or the small GTPase protein Rab. In this study, we raised antibodies against CERK and demonstrated the cytosolic distribution of CERK in mast cells. However, in a previous study, CERK was found in the membrane fraction in HEK293 cells (22Sugiura M. Kono K. Liu H. Shimizugawa T. Minekura H. Spiegel S. Kohama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23294-23300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). We also observed CERK to be associated with the plasma membrane in HEK293 cells (data not shown). In RBL-2H3 cells, some cells expressed CERK in the plasma membrane (Fig. 8B-e). CERK contains a PH domain in its N terminus, and we have already confirmed its specific binding to the phosphatidylinositol phosphate species. 2T.-J. Kim, S. Mitsutake, and Y. Igarashi, manuscript in preparation. Thus, the cytosolic distribution of CERK may not only depend on the cell type and conditions but also on local lipid composition. In conclusion, we have demonstrated a novel function for the lipid kinase CERK in mast cells. The target molecules of C1P, the CERK product, as well as the reasons why the intracellular distribution of CERK differs among cell types are topics of future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2116007724,"The ubiquitin-proteasome system is the major pathway for intracellular protein degradation in eukaryotic cells. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is the key enzyme of vascular homeostasis involved in the pathophysiology of several cardiovascular diseases. The aim of our study was to investigate whether eNOS expression and activity are regulated by the proteasome. Bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (CPAE cells) were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. MG132 (50-250 nmol/L) dose-dependently increased mRNA and protein levels of eNOS. Comparable results were obtained with other specific proteasome inhibitors, whereas the nonproteasomal calpain and cathepsin inhibitor ALLM had no effect. Efficacy of proteasome inhibition was evidenced by accumulation of poly-ubiquitinylated proteins and by measuring proteasomal activity in cell extracts. Cycloheximide prevented up-regulation of eNOS protein, indicating that post-translational stabilization of eNOS is not involved. eNOS activity was increased up to 2.8-fold (MG132 100 nmol/L, 48 h). Incubation of rat aortic rings with MG132 significantly enhanced endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation. Single MG132 treatment (100 nmol/L) induced long-term effects in CPAE cells, with increases of eNOS protein and activity for up to 10 days. Our results indicate that low-dose proteasome inhibition enhances eNOS expression and activity, and improves endothelial function."
https://openalex.org/W2029742330,"We have taken an integrated approach in which expression profiling has been combined with the use of small molecule inhibitors and computational analysis of transcription factor binding sites to characterize regulatory sequences of genes that are targets of specific signaling pathways in growth factor-stimulated human cells. T98G cells were stimulated with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and analyzed by DNA microarrays, which identified 74 immediate-early gene transcripts. Cells were then treated with inhibitors to identify subsets of genes that are targets of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and MEK/ERK signaling pathways. Four groups of PDGF-induced genes were defined: independent of PI3K and MEK/ERK signaling, dependent on PI3K signaling, dependent on MEK/ERK signaling, and dependent on both pathways. The upstream regions of all genes in the four groups were scanned using TRANSFAC for putative cis-elements as compared with a background set of non-induced genes. Binding sites for 18 computationally predicted transcription factors were over-represented in the four groups of co-expressed genes compared with the background sequences (p < 0.01). Many of the cis-elements identified were conserved in orthologous mouse genes, and many of the predicted elements and their cognate transcription factors were consistent with previous experimental data. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays experimentally verified nine predicted SRF binding sites in T98G cells, including a previously unknown SRF site upstream of DUSP5. These results indicate that groups of human genes regulated by discrete intracellular signaling pathways share common cis-regulatory elements. We have taken an integrated approach in which expression profiling has been combined with the use of small molecule inhibitors and computational analysis of transcription factor binding sites to characterize regulatory sequences of genes that are targets of specific signaling pathways in growth factor-stimulated human cells. T98G cells were stimulated with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and analyzed by DNA microarrays, which identified 74 immediate-early gene transcripts. Cells were then treated with inhibitors to identify subsets of genes that are targets of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and MEK/ERK signaling pathways. Four groups of PDGF-induced genes were defined: independent of PI3K and MEK/ERK signaling, dependent on PI3K signaling, dependent on MEK/ERK signaling, and dependent on both pathways.

These results indicate that groups of human genes regulated by discrete intracellular signaling pathways share common cis-regulatory elements. The identification of regulatory elements that control gene expression is one of the paramount problems in genomics and systems biology. However, computational identification of transcription factor binding sites is difficult because they consist of short, degenerate sequences that occur frequently by chance (1Pennacchio L.A. Rubin E.M. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 2Wyrick J.J. Young R.A. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Niemann H. Trends. Genet. 2001; 17: 56-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). One approach to this problem is to search for genes that share clusters of transcription factor binding sites, for example, upstream of developmentally regulated genes (5Halfon M.S. Grad Y. Church G.M. Michelson A.M. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 1019-1028PubMed Google Scholar, 6Markstein M. Markstein P. Markstein V. Levine M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2002; 99: 757-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). An alternative strategy limits searches for these elements to the upstream regions of genes that might be expected to be regulated by common transcription factors because they are functionally related (8Hughes J.D. Estep P.W. Tavazoie S. Church G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 1205-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar) or coordinately expressed.

Nature. 2002; 418: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar).In the present study, we have taken an integrated approach in which microarray expression profiling has been combined with the use of small molecule inhibitors to identify candidate transcription factor binding sites in groups of genes that are regulated by specific signaling pathways in growth factor-stimulated human cells. Many growth factors stimulate receptor-protein tyrosine kinases, leading to activation of intracellular signaling pathways that modulate gene expression by altering the activity of transcription factors (18Brivanlou A.H. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 2002; 295: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). A primary response to growth factor stimulation of mammalian cells is the transcriptional induction of ∼100 immediate-early genes, whose induction results directly from the post-translational modification of pre-existing transcription factors (19Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). As many immediateearly genes themselves encode transcription factors, their induction results in further downstream alterations in programs of gene expression.Growth factor receptors stimulate a variety of downstream signaling pathways, including the cAMP, JAK/STAT, MEK 1The abbreviations used are: MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; SRE, serum response element; SRF, serum response factor; RT-PCR, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. 1The abbreviations used are: MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; SRE, serum response element; SRF, serum response factor; RT-PCR, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction./ERK, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. We used microarray analysis to identify immediate-early genes induced by the MEK/ERK and PI3K pathways, which play critical roles in cell proliferation and survival. Activation of the MEK/ERK pathway is mediated by the Raf protein kinases, which are coupled to growth factor receptors by Ras proteins (20Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4337) Google Scholar). Once activated, ERK phosphorylates a variety of targets, including transcription factors and the protein kinase Rsk. Stimulation of growth factor receptors also results in activation of PI3K, leading to formation of the membrane phospholipid PIP3. PIP3 activates several downstream targets, including the protein kinase Akt, which plays a critical role in cell survival (21Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar). Like ERK, Akt and other targets of PI3K signaling phosphorylate and activate transcription factors, leading to the rapid induction of immediate early genes.Since induction of immediate-early genes is directly linked to signaling pathways that target transcription factors, genes that are responsive to a common signaling pathway might be expected to share transcription factor binding sites. We therefore sought to identify regulatory elements of genes induced by PI3K and MEK/ERK signaling, using a statistical analysis to identify transcription factor binding sites that were over-represented in the genomic regions upstream of groups of co-expressed genes. This approach identified binding sites for a limited number of transcription factors that were present at a high frequency upstream of genes regulated by specific signaling pathways. Many of the transcription factors predicted as regulators of immediate-early genes were established targets of the appropriate signaling pathways, and many of the predicted transcription factor binding sites were consistent with published experimental data and/or conserved in orthologous mouse genes. In addition, predicted binding sites for serum response factor (SRF) were confirmed directly by chromatin immunoprecipitation. It thus appears that biologically relevant transcription factor binding sites can be identified in groups of genes regulated by common signaling pathways in mammalian cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Treatments—T98G human glioblastoma cells were grown in Minimal Essential Medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with fetal calf serum (10%). For growth factor/inhibitor treatments, cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 72 h, and either left unstimulated, or stimulated for 30 min with human PDGF-BB (50 ng/ml) (Sigma). U0126 (10 μm) (Cell Signaling Technology) and LY294002 (50 μm) (BioMol) were added 60 min prior to PDGF addition.Immunoblots—In parallel to all microarray experiments, the activities of PI3K and MEK/ERK signaling pathways were assessed by immunoblotting cell lysates. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis in 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with anti-phospho-Akt or anti-phospho-ERK antibodies (Cell Signaling Technologies) as recommended by the manufacturer. Blots were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody, and chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences).RNA Preparations and Microarray Processing—Agilent Human I cDNA microarrays, containing PCR-amplified cDNA clones, were processed per manufacturer's guidelines. Briefly, RNA was isolated from multiple harvests of unstimulated and stimulated cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and RNeasy (Qiagen) protocols. Total RNA was oligo(dT) primed and reverse-transcribed in the presence of cyanine-coupled dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cyanine 3-dCTP and cyanine 5-dCTP dye-swap hybridizations were performed. Dye-swap determinations compared PDGF-stimulated cells in the presence or absence of inhibitor versus unstimulated cells. Arrays were scanned with a Gene-Pix 4000B scanner (Axon Instruments) with photomultiplier tube settings adjusted to eliminate signal saturation and provide an average Cyanine 3/Cyanine 5 intensity ratio of 1 across each array. GenePix Pro software (version 3.0) (Axon Instruments) was used to determine the Cyanine 3 and Cyanine 5 intensities for each array feature and the surrounding background. Following local background subtraction, the median intensities for each dye-swap pair were used to calculate the average log2 ratio for each feature (22Tseng G.C. Oh M.K. Rohlin L. Liao J.C. Wong W.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2549-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar).Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA preparations for the microarray hybridizations were used in quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR). Reverse transcription of 0.25 μg of total RNA was performed in 20 μl using SYBR green RT-PCR reagents and random hexamer primers (Applied Biosystems) as recommended by the manufacturer. Following a 95 °C incubation for 10 min, forty cycles of PCR (95 °C/15 s; 60 °C/1 m), were then performed on an ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System with 1 μl of the RT reaction, 100 nm PCR primers (see Supplementary Table I for primer sequences), and SYBR Green PCR Master Mix in 10-μl reactions. Threshold cycles (CT) for four replicate reactions were determined using Sequence Detection System software (version 2.0, release 4) and relative transcript abundance calculated following normalization with an 18 S ribosomal PCR amplicon. Amplification of only a single species was verified by a dissociation curve for each reaction.Identification of Upstream Sequences—Transcription start sites relative to the human genome sequence were obtained for 64 of the 74 PDGF-induced genes from the LocusLink data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/LocusLink/). The 5′ annotations for 13 of these transcripts were extended an average of 124 bases using the Data base of Transcription Start Sites (March 11, 2002 release) (23Suzuki Y. Yamashita R. Nakai K. Sugano S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 328-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Human genomic BLAST (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) was then used to verify the position of each transcript in the genome and 1-kb upstream sequences were extracted from the corresponding GenBank™ contig records (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/). This work was based on build 29 of the human genome assembly maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information.Identification of Transcription Factor Binding Sites—The computer program Match (version 1.4.1), distributed with the TRANSFAC Professional data base (Biobase Biological Databases), was used to identify putative transcription factor binding sites within each upstream sequence (24Wingender E. Chen X. Fricke E. Geffers R. Hehl R. Liebich I. Krull M. Matys V. Michael H. Ohnhauser R. Pruss M. Schacherer F. Thiele S. Urbach S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The 400 vertebrate position weight matrices in TRANSFAC (version 6.1) were used to score every position along each promoter sequence. In order to identify the maximum number of candidate transcription factor binding sites, all positions with scores greater than predefined Match thresholds that minimize false negatives (minFN14.prf; false negative rate of 10%) were considered matches in the subsequent analysis. To prevent a bias introduced by palindromic or internally repetitive cis-regulatory elements, overlapping matches, including on opposite DNA strands, were defined as a single match.Statistical Analysis of the Site Frequencies—The statistical significance of the frequency of a cis-regulatory element in each of the four groups of co-expressed genes was assessed by comparison against the average frequency in 194 genes expressed in both PDGF-treated samples and controls. This background set of upstream regions consisted of genes not induced by PDGF, with average log2 ratios limited to between -0.005 and 0.005 and standard deviations less than 0.25 following PDGF treatment. The upstream sequences for each gene were obtained in the same manner as the induced genes. To identify statistically over-represented binding sites in the PDGF-induced co-expressed gene groups, the mean number of sites identified per upstream region in each co-expressed gene group was compared with the mean per upstream region in the background group with a one-tailed two-sample Student's t test. In addition, a non-parametric permutation test, which does not assume a normal distribution, was used to ensure the validity of the Student's t test for the analysis. For each matrix, a permutation test was employed by randomly permuting the group labels of the background and promoter upstream sequences, and a t-value generated from the mean number of sites identified in the shuffled groups (25Ewens W.J. Grant G.R. Statistical Methods in Bioinformatics: An Introduction. Springer-Verlag, New York, NY2001: 119-121Google Scholar). After 10,000 permutations, the t-values were sorted, and a p value determined based on relative rank of the unpermuted t-value among the ordered list of t-values from the permuted groups.Comparison with Orthologous Mouse Sequences—We identified mouse orthologs for 65 PDGF-induced genes using the mouse homology map information found in LocusLink. A 1-kb nucleotide sequence upstream of the reported mouse transcription start site was used as input to the previously described Match program. The human and mouse sequences were then aligned using the Needleman-Wunsch global alignment tool found in version 2.5.0 of The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite (26Rice P. Longden I. Bleasby A. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 276-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6329) Google Scholar). The gap open and extension penalties were set at 50.0 and 3.0, respectively, and the nucleotide-scoring scheme of match 10, mismatch -9 was used. The positions of each site identified in the human sequence were mapped to positions in the aligned mouse sequence, and sites occurring in both organisms at the same alignment position were recorded.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin immunoprecipitations were performed as described (27Luo R.X. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. T98G cells were scraped and formaldehyde fixed at 37 °C for 10 min. Shearing was performed to yield 500–1500 bp chromatin fragments with a Branson Sonifier 250, using four 30-s pulses at 25% output. Samples were precleared with sonicated salmon sperm DNA/Protein A agarose (50% slurry) and immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C using 4 μg/ml anti-SRF antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-335) (28Miralles F. Posern G. Zaromytidou A.I. Treisman R. Cell. 2003; 113: 329-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). Complexes were then washed successively in low salt wash (0.01% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.1), high salt wash (0.01% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, pH 8.1), LiCl wash (0.25 m LiCl, 1% IGEPAL-Ca 630, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), and twice in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA pH 8.0. Cross-links were reversed for 6 h at 65 °C, and samples were proteinase K treated for 2 h at 45 °C, followed by purification using a Qiagen Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen). Immunoprecipitated chromatin was quantified with real-time PCR as described above, using primers that either flanked the predicted site or amplified a fragment within 134 bp of the predicted site (see Supplementary Table I for primer sequences). Each PCR reaction was carried out in quadruplicate and results for each promoter region are derived from at least two independent chromatin immunoprecipitations. Data were normalized to input and are presented as fold increase over GAPDH, a standard negative control for SRF chromatin immunoprecipitations (28Miralles F. Posern G. Zaromytidou A.I. Treisman R. Cell. 2003; 113: 329-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIdentification of Immediate-Early Genes Induced by the PI3K and MEK/ERK Pathways—Microarray analysis was used to identify immediate-early genes induced by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulation of quiescent T98G human glioblastoma cells, which were chosen for these experiments because they undergo reversible cell cycle arrest upon serum deprivation (29Takahashi Y. Rayman J.B. Dynlacht B.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 804-816PubMed Google Scholar, 30Stein G.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1979; 99: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Seventy-four genes were reproducibly induced >2-fold following 30 min of PDGF stimulation, the optimal time for induction of the immediate-early genes fos and jun (Table I). Gene inductions ranged from 2-fold to more than 80-fold (26.4) upon growth factor treatment, and were highly reproducible as evidenced by the standard deviations. Further, analysis of several representative genes by quantitative RTPCR confirmed the array data (Fig. 1). The number of genes induced was in good agreement with other studies examining immediate early gene induction, and included expected genes such as fos, jun, myc, and mcl1 (19Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 31Fambrough D. McClure K. Kazlauskas A. Lander E.S.

Science. 1999; 283: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar).Table IGenes induced by PDGF T98G cells were rendered quiescent and then stimulated by treatment with human PDGF-BB for 30 minutes. The values for each gene represent the mean average log2 ratio and standard deviation for dye-swap normalized determinations (N) comparing five independent cultures of PDGF-stimulated versus non-stimulated cells. Some genes were represented more than once on the array and thus have more than five determinations. Only genes induced >2-fold are presented and were used in subsequent analysis.

As expected, LY294002 inhibited phosphorylation of Akt, whereas U0126 inhibited phosphorylation of ERK (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, U0126 did not affect Akt phosphorylation and LY294002 had no effect on ERK phosphorylation, demonstrating the specificity of the inhibitors for each pathway. Gene expression profiles were then determined by analysis of PDGF-stimulated cells pretreated with inhibitors. Representative gene targets in inhibitor-treated cells (and appropriate vehicle controls) were validated using quantitative RT-PCR (data not shown).Fig. 2Effect of PI3K and MEK inhibitors on gene induction.

It has been reported that neutrophils mediate endogenous thrombolysis involving a uPA-dependent mechanism, and we previously demonstrated that both uPAR and integrin αMβ2 recognize uPA to control cell migration and adhesion. In the present study, we report that the αMβ2 regulates neutrophil-dependent fibrinolysis. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-stimulated but not resting neutrophils dissolved fibrin clots, and this activity was not only uPA- and Plg-dependent but also αMβ2-dependent. Purified αMβ2 directly bound uPA (Kd = 40 nm) and Plg (Kd = 1 μm) in a dose-dependent and saturable manner. In Plg activation assays, addition of purified αMβ2, but not a control protein, to a single chain uPA (sc-uPA)/Plg mixture, decreased the Km from 2 to 0.1 μm, thereby augmenting the overall reaction efficiency by 50-fold. The binding of sc-uPA to αMβ2 was critical for the αMβ2-mediated enhancement of plasmin (Plm) generation, because this effect was lost when WT-sc-uPA was replaced with a kringle-less mutant (ΔK-sc-uPA), which does not bind to αMβ2. Plm inactivation by α2-antiplasmin was significantly delayed when Plm was preincubated with purified, soluble αMβ2. When Plg was added to PMA-stimulated neutrophils, both uPA and Plg were co-immunoprecipitated with αMβ2. Thus, assembly of Plg and uPA on integrin αMβ2 regulates Plm activity and, thereby, plays a crucial role in neutrophil-mediated thrombolysis.

Components of the plasminogen (Plg) system and members of the integrin family contribute to the proteolytic and adhesive potentials of the PMN (1Plow E.F. Herren T. Redlitz A. Miles L.A.

Recent data have emphasized the importance of urokinase (uPA), released from intracellular stores, to activate Plg to plasmin (Plm) and, thereby, contribute to the fibrinolytic activity of these cells (5Moir E.

Tscherning T. Dano K. Hansen N.E. Blood. 1994; 83: 808-815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PMNs also express the uPA receptor, uPAR, on their surface (7Plesner T. Ploug M. Ellis V. Ronne E. Hoyer-Hansen G. Wittrup M. Lindhardt Pedersen T. Tscherning T. Dano K. Hansen N.E. Blood. 1994; 83: 808-815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most recent studies of uPAR have emphasized its participation in cell migration, but its contribution to Plg activation has been difficult to demonstrate not only in vitro but also in vivo using deficient mice (8Ellis V.

Soloviev D.A. Plow E.F. Blood. 2003; 101: 1582-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This recognition influences PMN adhesion and migration (11Pluskota E. Soloviev D.A. Plow E.F. Blood. 2003; 101: 1582-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), but the role of αMβ2 interaction with uPA in fibrinolysis has not been investigated. Plg can also bind to PMNs via its lysine binding sites (LBS) associated with its kringle domains (12Ryan T.J. Lai L. Malik A.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and numerous Plg-binding proteins, some present in PMN, have been identified (13Cesarman G.M. Guevara C.A. Hajjar K.A. J. Biol.

Thus, PMNs exhibit multiple interactions with components of the Plg system, but it is unclear if and how these interactions affect the primary function of Plg, its role in fibrinolysis. The adhesive and migratory responses of PMNs are critical to their participation in the inflammatory response, and numerous in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that αMβ2 is an important mediator of these activities (4Mizgerd J.P. Kubo H. Kutkoski G.J. Bhagwan S.D. Scharffetter-Kochanek K. Beaudet A.L. Doerschuk C.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1357-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 17Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Fibrinogen and ICAM-1 are among the ligands of this integrin that have been implicated in endothelial transmigration of PMNs (17Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 18Languino L.R. Duperray A. Joganic K.J. Fornaro M. Thornton G.B. Altieri D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1505-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). These and a myriad of other ligands for αMβ2 interact with its I domain, an inserted domain of ∼200 amino acids in the αM subunit (19Diamond M.S. Garcia-Aguilar J. Bickford J.K. Corbí A.L. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1031-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). As noted above, uPA is a ligand for αMβ2 and can support both adhesion and migration of αMβ2-bearing cells, including PMNs (11Pluskota E. Soloviev D.A. Plow E.F. Blood. 2003; 101: 1582-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). uPAR also interacts within a 17-amino acid sequence, M25, located within W4 repeat of the β-propeller (20Simon D.I. Wei Y.

The interaction between uPAR and αMβ2 augments αMβ2-mediated functions such as adhesion to fibrinogen, ICAM-1, and other ligands of this integrin (23Simon D.I. Rao N.K. Xu H. Wei Y. Majdic O.

In this study, we identify a previously unrecognized function of αMβ2, a direct and primary role of this integrin in Plg activation. This activity is demonstrated with purified αMβ2 and components of the Plg system as well as with intact PMNs and is shown to regulate the participation of PMNs in fibrinolysis. This function is particularly relevant in view of the preferential accumulation of these cells within thrombi (6Henry R.L. Thromb. Diath. Haemorrh. 1965; 13: 35-46PubMed Google Scholar) and the prominent role of Plg in the proteolytic and migratory responses of PMNs.

In the former assay, resting or PMA-stimulated PMNs were added at a final concentration of 1.5 × 105 cells/well to microtiter plates containing 2.9 μm fibrinogen, 0.5 μm Plg, 1 mm CaCl2,1mm MgCl2 in HEPES buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 1% human fresh cell-free plasma). Clot formation was initiated by addition of 0.5 NIH units/ml thrombin, and the total volume of the assay was 200 μl. In inhibition experiments, cells were preincubated in the absence or presence of selected protease inhibitors or F(ab)2 fragments of antibodies to uPA or the αM or β2 integrin subunits (50 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C, prior to incorporation into clots. Clot lysis was monitored as changes in turbidity at 405 nm at 37 °C for up to 5 h. For experiments in which αMβ2 on PMNs was activated with KIM 185 or Mn2+, the cells were pre-treated with these reagents for 20 min, 37 °C, incubated with 50 nm sc-uPA for 30 min at 37 °C, and washed two to three times to remove unbound uPA before incorporation into clots. The plasma clot also was measured turbidimetrically with some modifications of an assay previously described by Wu et al. (30Wu S.-C. Castellino F.J. Wong S.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18199-18206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 31Bajzar L. Fredenburg J.C. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16948-16954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human platelet-poor plasma was prepared from citrated blood by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 15 min and used on the same day. PMN were pretreated with or without blocking reagents to uPA, Plm, or αMβ2 as specified above and added at 5 × 105/well in a total volume of 150 μl to recalcified (20 mm CaCl2, final) platelet-poor plasma. Clotting was initiated by adding thrombin (2 NIH units/ml), and the plates were incubated at 37 °C. Clots formed within 0.5 h and were lysed within 20 h, and these processes were monitored as the changes of absorbance at 600 nm. Radioiodination of Proteins—Na125I (specific activity = 15 mCi of 125I/mg iodine) from Amersham Biosciences was used for radioiodination. HMW-tc-uPA, Plg, and goat anti-mouse IgG were radiolabeled using a modified chloramine-T method (32Miles L.A. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4303-4311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The labeled HMW-tc-uPA and goat IgG were indistinguishable from the unlabeled forms upon SDS-PAGE. Solid Phase Ligand Binding Assays—The binding of 125I-uPA and 125I-Plg to immobilized αMβ2 was performed as described by Wei et al. (33Wei Y. Lukashev M. Simon D.I. Bodary S.C. Rosenberg S. Doyle M.V. Chapman H.A. Science. 1996; 273: 1551-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. αMβ2 was purified on affinity chromatography column of mAb LM2/1.6.11 as previously described (34Miller L.J. Wiebe J. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 2381-2383PubMed Google Scholar). The receptor (20 μg/ml in TBS) was immobilized onto 96-well microtiter plates (Corning Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) at 2 μg/well for 20 h at 4 °C. After post-coating with BSA, 125I-HMW-tc-uPA was added (0-1 μm) in the presence of 1 mm MnCl2 and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Plates were then washed with TBS, and bound HMW-tc-uPA was quantitated by counting the bound radioactivity in a γ-counter. In competition studies, various concentrations (0-2 μm) of non-labeled uPA derivatives were added together with the radiolabeled ligand to the assays, or 125I-HMW-tc-uPA was preincubated with the αM or αLI domains (0-100 nm) prior to the addition to the αMβ2-coated wells. To measure Plg binding, varying concentrations of 125I-Glu-Plg (0-14 μm) were added to αMβ2- or BSA-coated plates in the presence of 1 mm MnCl2, with or without 50 μm unlabeled Plg. After 2-h incubation at 37 °C, the wells were washed, and bound 125I-Glu-Plg was measured as described for uPA binding. Data were determined as triplicate measurements at each experimental point. Diisopropyl fluorophosphate-treated Plm was labeled with Alex-afluor-488 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations (0-1.2 μm) of purified αMβ2, αMI, or αL domains, and allowed to bind to α2-antiplasmin (1 μg/well)-coated 96-well plates for 2 h at 37 °C. After washing, the bound Plm was quantitated by measuring fluorescence at λex 480 and λem 530 nm. Plg Activation Assays—Wild-type or mutant forms of sc-uPA (23 nm) were incubated in the absence or presence of purified, soluble αMβ2 integrin (0-50 nm) for 15 min at 37 °C in 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MnCl2, 0.07% N-octylglucopyranoside, 0.02% BSA, and then increasing concentrations of Glu-Plg (0-10 μm) were added. Plm generation was determined in a Molecular Devices microplate reader in the presence of the Plm chromogenic substrate S-2251 (0.5 mm) at 37 °C by ΔA405 over each 1-min interval and converted to Plm concentration by reference to a linear standard curve prepared with active site-titrated Plm. In the kinetic study rates of Plm generation were plotted against Glu-Plg concentration in a double-reciprocal manner to obtain the apparent kinetic constants for the reaction. In the inhibition studies, NIF (100 nm) or the KD of uPA (50 nm) were preincubated with the integrin and added to the sc-uPA/Plg mixture. When the effect of αMβ2 on the inactivation of Plm by α2-antiplasmin was measured, Plm (200 nm) was preincubated in the absence or presence of αMβ2 (600 nm) for 10 min at 37 °C followed by addition of S-2251 (0.5 mm). Hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate was measured continuously, and at 2 min the α2-antiplasmin (1 μm) was added. Plg Activation on the PMN Surface—PMNs were activated with 20 nm PMA, 20 μg/ml KIM 185, or 0.5 mm Mn2+ for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence 25 nm sc-uPA in 10 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.14 mm NaCl, 0.1% BSA, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2 (unless Mn2+ was present). The blocking mAbs to αM, β2, or uPAR were added at final concentrations of 20 μg/ml. The cells were washed three times, and 50 μl of the cell suspension (1 × 106 cells/ml) was added to each well of the microtiter plate. Then, 100 μl of a Glu-Plg (1 μm) and plasmin-specific fluorescent substrate H-d-Val-Leu-Lys-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (2 mm) mixture were added, and plasmin formation was monitored over 40 min at 37 °C at αem = 370 nm and αex = 470 nm using a fluorescence plate reader (SpectraMax GeminiXS, Molecular Devices). Plg Binding to PMNs and Immunoprecipitation—Resting or PMA-stimulated PMNs were resuspended (2 × 107 cells/ml) in 1 ml of 10 mm HEPES buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2 and incubated with Plg (2 μm) at 37 °C for 30 min. Excess ligand was removed by centrifugation. After washing with HEPES buffer, the cells were lysed with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 2% N-octylglucopyranoside, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) for 1 h on ice. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Lysates were precleared by incubation with 10 μg of non-immune mouse IgG and 50 μl of protein G-agarose (Zymed Laboratories, San Francisco, CA) for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatants were mixed with 5 μg of mAb to human anti-αM (clone OKM I) or with non-immune mouse IgG at 4 °C overnight. The immune complexes were captured by incubating with 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed twice with ice-cold lysis buffer; twice with TBS, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2 and eluted with SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed on 8% gels by SDS-PAGE, electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and stained with goat anti-Plg, or mAbs to uPA, uPAR, or the αM subunit. Plg Binding to αMβ2 on Beads—Purified αMβ2 was biotinylated using Sulfo-Link biotin (Pierce, Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer's instructions and immobilized on streptavidin-conjugated beads for 2 h at room temperature. After two washings with 10 mm HEPES buffer containing 0.1% N-octylglucopyranoside and 1 mm Mn2+, nonspecific binding sites were blocked with biotin, followed by five washings with the HEPES buffer. Immobilized αMβ2 on the beads was mixed in a total volume of 200 μl with combinations of Plg (20 μg) and/or sc-uPA (10 μg) in HEPES buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. The resins were washed four times, and formed complexes were analyzed by Western blot as described above. Data Analysis—The data are expressed as means ± S.E. To determine the significance of differences between two groups, Student's t test was performed using the Sigma-Plot software program (SPSS Inc.); p < 0.05 was considered significant. Integrin αMβ2 Promotes PMN-mediated Fibrinolysis—In view of the known accumulation of PMNs in thrombi, recent data implicating uPA in the capacity of these cells to spontaneously lyse blood clots (1Plow E.F.

Haemorrh. 1965; 13: 35-46PubMed Google Scholar, 35Heiple J.M. Ossowski L. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 826-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and our own results showing that integrin αMβ2 (11Pluskota E. Soloviev D.A. Plow E.F. Blood. 2003; 101: 1582-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) contributes to the adhesive and migratory responses to uPA, we sought to determine whether the integrin might influence PMN-mediated fibrin clot lysis. Isolated human blood PMNs were incorporated into fibrin clots enriched with Plg, and clot dissolution was monitored as changes in turbidity. The capacity of resting or PMA-stimulated PMNs to mediate fibrinolysis is shown in Fig. 1A. PMA-stimulated PMNs, but not resting cells, mediated clot lysis over a 5-h period. The observed time course of clot lysis time is consistent with previous reports (5Moir E. Booth N.A. Bennett B. Robbie L.A. Br. J. Haematol. 2001; 113: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 30Wu S.-C. Castellino F.J. Wong S.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18199-18206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, activation of the PMNs is essential for efficient fibrinolysis. The role of uPA in clot lysis mediated by stimulated PMNs was demonstrable with F(ab)2 fragments of a function blocking mAb and amiloride, a low molecular weight uPA inhibitor. Both reagents decreased PMN-mediated fibrin dissolution by ∼60-70% (Fig. 1B). Since exogenous uPA was not added to the cells, the source of uPA must be the sc-uPA, which is known to be rapidly secreted from specific granules upon stimulation of PMN (1Plow E.F. Herren T. Redlitz A. Miles L.A. Hoover-Plow J.L. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 7Plesner T. Ploug M. Ellis V. Ronne E. Hoyer-Hansen G. Wittrup M. Lindhardt Pedersen T. Tscherning T. Dano K. Hansen N.E. Blood. 1994; 83: 808-815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Heiple J.M. Ossowski L. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 826-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and this assumption was verified in subsequent experiments (see below). The dependence of the lysis on Plm was demonstrated by the capacity of Trasylol, a Plm active site inhibitor, and 6-aminohexoic acid (6-AHA), an inhibitor of the LBS functions of Plm, to suppress fibrinolysis induced by the PMA-stimulated PMNs. Together, these results verify the prominent role of uPA-mediated Plg activation in the fibrinolytic response of the cells. The involvement of integrin αMβ2 in fibrinolysis was evaluated using a blocking approach. When neutrophil inhibitory factor (NIF), a high affinity ligand antagonist of αMβ2 (36Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17558-17564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 37Rieu P. Ueda T. Haruta I. Sharma C.P. Arnaout M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 2081-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) was added, it was as effective as the uPA and Plm inhibitors in suppressing clot lysis (Fig. 1B). Similarly, F(ab)2 fragments of two different mAbs to αMβ2, one to the αM and the other to the β2 subunit, were effective in inhibiting PMN-dependent fibrinolysis (Fig. 1B), whereas non-immune mouse F(ab)2 fragments had no effect. These data implicate not only Plg and uPA but also indicate that αMβ2 plays a major role in PMN-mediated lysis of fibrin clots. PMN-dependent fibrinolysis was not completely blocked by the anti-integrin reagents. The participation of plasminogen receptors (14Miles L.A. Dahlberg C.M. Plescia J. Felez J. Kato K. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1682-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 38Falcone D.J. Borth W. Mathew J. Guevara C. Hajjar K.A. FASEB J. 1995; 92388aGoogle Scholar), plasmin-independent fibrin degradation by neutrophil proteases (39Plow E.F. Gramse M. Havemann K. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1983; 102: 858-869PubMed Google Scholar) or activation of Plg that dissociates from cell surface by cell-bound or released uPA may all contribute to integrin-independent fibrinolysis. We directly assessed the role of two prominent Plg receptors on PMNs, annexin II (13Cesarman G.M. Guevara C.A. Hajjar K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21198-21203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and α-enolase (14Miles L.A. Dahlberg C.M. Plescia J. Felez J. Kato K. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1682-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), using blocking mAbs and found that these reagents suppressed fibrinolysis by 15 and 25%, respectively (Fig. 1B), compared with the 50% inhibition by the integrin αMβ2-blocking mAbs. Because PMA not only induces integrin activation but also stimulates sc-uPA secretion, we investigated whether αMβ2 activation in itself is sufficient to affect PMN-mediated fibrinolysis. When PMNs were incubated with known activators of αMβ2, 0.5 mm Mn2+ (40Li R. Rieu P. Griffith D.L. Scott D. Arnaout M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1523-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), or the β2-activating mAb, KIM 185 (27Robinson M.K. Andrew D. Rosen H. Brown D. Ortlepp S. Stephens P.E. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1080-1085PubMed Google Scholar), the cells were not capable of supporting fibrin degradation (not shown); i.e. they behaved the same as non-stimulated PMN (see Fig. 1A). These reagents did induce αMβ2 activation as verified with mAb CBRM 1/5, which reacts with activated αMβ2 and did not induce sc-uPA and uPAR expression on PMN surface as assessed by FACS (not shown). However, when the cells were preincubated with exogenous sc-uPA, washed, and incorporated into fibrin clots, both Mn2+ and KIM 185 induced PMN-mediated fibrinolysis (60 and 45%, respectively) as compared with unstimulated cells (Fig. 1C). The fibrinolysis induced by these reagents was dramatically reduced by αMβ2-blocking mAbs (44a, TS1/18), confirming the crucial role of αMβ2 in the response. In control samples,"
https://openalex.org/W2110071884,"Neuronal loss via apoptosis is a key element in numerous neurodegenerative diseases. To avoid accumulation of apoptotic material, the remains of apoptotic cells should be degraded. It was suggested that microglial cells are phagocytosing and degrading apoptotic material. There is only limited information available concerning the fate of the remains of apoptotic neurons. In this study, we investigated the ability of microglial cells to take up and degrade neuronal apoptotic material. We isolated primary microglial cells and used apoptotic bodies of apoptotic neuron-like PC12 cells as a substrate. The apoptotic material was taken up and degraded within the microglial cells. The uptake is clearly activation dependent. We were able to demonstrate that the CD36 scavenger receptor is involved in the uptake of the apoptotic material via competition studies, antibody blockage, and use of a CD36 mutant rat strain. Blockage of other uptake mechanisms was also able to inhibit the uptake to some extent. Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate the role of the microglial lysosomal and proteasomal pathways in the degradation of proteins originating from apoptotic bodies."

The MAPK pathway is also activated in neurons in primary culture undergoing NK1R-mediated death, since the MEK inhibitor PD98059 inhibited Substance P-induced death in primary striatal neurons.

A. 2000; 97: 14376-14381Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Ischemia-induced cell death may also display a nonapoptotic morphology, referred to as “oncosis” (13Majno G. Joris I. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 3-15PubMed Google Scholar).The biochemical basis for these alternative morphological forms of cell death remains largely unknown. Understanding the mechanisms for these forms would have potentially important implications for the understanding of evolutionary aspects of cell death programs, developmental cell death, neurodegeneration, and cancer therapeutics and for the design of novel therapeutic agents for diseases featuring these alternative forms of cell death.Cell death has been divided into two main types: pcd, in which the cell plays an active role, and passive (necrotic) cell death. The pcd observed during development and tissue homeostasis has been classified morphologically into three main types: type 1, also known as nuclear or apoptotic; type 2 or autophagic; and type 3, also referred to as cytoplasmic (4Clarke P.G.

The biochemical activation of apoptosis occurs through two general pathways: the intrinsic pathway, originating from mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and associated activation of caspase-9, and the extrinsic pathway, originating from the activation of cell surface death receptors such as Fas and resulting in the activation of caspase-8 or -10 (17Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar). A third general pathway, originating from the endoplasmic reticulum and resulting in the activation of caspase-12 and -9, has also recently been described (18Yuan J. Yankner B.A. Nat.

Type 2 (autophagic) cell death can be activated in some cases by Ras (23Chi S. Kitanaka C. Noguchi K. Mochizuki T. Nagashima Y. Shirouzu M. Fujita H. Yoshida M. Chen W. Asai A. Himeno M. Yokoyama S. Kuchino Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2281-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), whereas the molecular activation of type 3 cell death is unknown. Recently, it was noted that the binding of the undecapeptide neurotransmitter Substance P (SP) to its receptor, neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R), induces a nonapoptotic form of pcd resembling type 2 or 3 morphologically and characterized by cytoplasmic vacuolation, lack of caspase activation, lack of inhibition by caspase inhibitors (benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone and Boc-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone) and by Bcl-xL, lack of nuclear fragmentation or membrane blebbing (Fig. 1), and a requirement for new gene transcription and translation (24Castro-Obregon S. Del Rio G. Chen S.F. Swanson R.A. Frankowski H. Rao R.V. Stoka V. Vesce S. Nicholls D.G. Bredesen D.E. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 807-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).The development of specific agonists and antagonists for NK1R has supported a role for NK1R in numerous biological processes, such as the transmission of pain in the spinal cord. In the central nervous system, it also regulates cardiovascular and respiratory function and is involved in activating the emetic reflex. NK1R also regulates several behavioral responses and has recently been implicated in depression and schizophrenia. It appears to be involved in a wide variety of functions due to its ability to modulate the release of other neurotransmitters, such as excitatory amino acids (25Quartara L. Maggi C.A. Neuropeptides. 1998; 32: 1-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar).SP also seems to play an important role in pathological states in which neural cell death occurs, such as status epilepticus and ischemia. For example, SP-null mice demonstrate resistance to excitotoxin-induced seizures, with an associated reduction in neuronal death (26Liu H. Cao Y. Basbaum A.I. Mazarati A.M. Sankar R. Wasterlain C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12096-12101Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Similarly, treatment with an antagonist for NK1R inhibits seizures and reduces kainic acidinduced cell death in the CA1 region of the hippocampus (27Zachrisson O. Lindefors N. Brene S. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 60: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in a model of focal cerebral ischemia, administration of an NK1R antagonist reduced infarct volume and improved neurological function (28Yu Z. Cheng G. Huang X. Li K. Cao X. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 2117-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that NK1R may be a mediator of cell death in vivo.In the current report, we demonstrate that SP/NK1R-induced cell death is mediated by a MAP kinase activation pathway involving Raf-1, MEK2, and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 2 (ERK2), upon recruitment by the scaffold protein arrestin 2, in both neuronal and nonneuronal cells. The activation of ERK2 leads to the phosphorylation of Nur77, whose activity is essential for the progression to cell death.MATERIALS AND METHODSNeuronal Primary CulturePrimary striatal cultures were prepared from 17-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat embryos (B&K, Fremont, CA). The tissue was dissected, minced, and trypsinized for 5 min using 0.25% trypsin (Cellgro). After the addition of 10% horse serum to inhibit the trypsin, the cell suspension was triturated 15–20 times with a 10-ml syringe and centrifuged for 5 min at 800 relative centrifugal force. The pellet was resuspended in MEM-PAK (University of California-San Francisco Cell Culture facility), supplemented with 2.02 mg of glucose, 2 mm GlutaMax (Invitrogen), and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml). The suspension was filtered through a 70-μm cell strainer, and the final culture medium contained 5% horse serum (Invitrogen). 3–4 × 105 cells/cm2 were seeded onto either poly-d-lysine-precoated eight-well chamber slides (BD Biosciences) or 96-well plates precoated with 50 μg/ml poly-d-lysine (Sigma) in water. After a 30-min incubation, unattached cells were removed together with the medium and replaced with glucose-enriched MEM-PAK plus 5% horse serum. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% carbon dioxide with 95% humidity. Cultures were used for experiments between day 1 and day 4 when glial contamination was at a minimum. 0.1 nm to 100 μm SP (Sigma) was added 24–48 h after seeding in the presence of 2.5% horse serum. Viability was quantified by trypan blue staining of the total cell population.cAMP QuantificationTotal cellular cAMP was measured using the Biotrak nonacetylation enzyme immunoassay system (Amersham Biosciences), following the manufacturer's instructions. Forskolin (Sigma) was added at 10 μm.Imaging of [Ca2+]c in Single CellsSingle cell imaging was performed in a Merlin imaging facility (Olympus America) using an Olympus IX70 inverted epifluorescence microscope equipped with a × 40 oil immersion objective and a Spectramaster monochromator (Life Science Resources, Cambridge, UK) (excitation, 340 and 380 nm; emission, >505 nm). Cells were loaded with 3 μm Fura-2/AM (from TEF LABS) for 30 min in incubation medium containing 120 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm KCl, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 20 mm TES buffer, 5 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm Na2SO4, 15 mm glucose, 1.2 mm MgCl2, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. 30 μg/ml bovine serum albumin was also added. Experiments were performed in a nonperfusing thermostatted chamber (37 °C) with incubation medium without bovine serum albumin (71Castilho R.F. Hansson O. Ward M.W. Budd S.L. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 10277-10286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2 μm ionomycin (Sigma) and 10 μm EGTA (Sigma) were added at the times indicated in Fig. 1B.InhibitorsProtein kinase inhibitors were added 30 min before 100 nm SP exposure at the following concentrations: 10 μm adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate, 8-bromo-, Rp-isomer, sodium salt (Rp-8-Br-cAMPS), which is a protein kinase A inhibitor; 50 nm calphostin C, which is a protein kinase C inhibitor; 10 μm PD 98059 and 10 μm U0126, which are MEK1/2 inhibitors; 10 μm SB203580, which is a p38 inhibitor; and 10 μm SP600125, which is a JNK inhibitor. These compounds were obtained from Calbiochem. The caspase inhibitor Boc-Asp(Ome)CH2F was obtained from Enzyme Systems Products (Livermore, CA).NK1R Mutants, Plasmids, and TransfectionsNK1R mutants were created using the QuikChange™ strategy (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), using the following sequences for the oligonucleotides: 5′-GTGGACCTGGCCTTCGCTCAGGCCTGCATGGCTGCATTC-3′ for the NK1RE78Q mutation and 5′-GGAAATGAAATCCACCCGATACCTCTAGGCATATTCAAGGCATGC-3′ for NK1RΔ342 truncation. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml) (Invitrogen). The cultures were incubated at 37 °C in 95% air and 5% carbon dioxide with 95% humidity. Transient transfection was performed using Superfect (Qiagen) as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, 2 × 105 cells/well were seeded into 35-mm wells 16 h prior to transfection. Superfect-DNA complexes were added at a 5 μl/2 μg ratio for 3 h; then the medium was replaced, and after 24 h, SP was added. Expression of each construct in the transient transfections was determined by Western blot and efficiency of transient transfections by immunocytochemistry (see Fig. 11). Transient transfection efficiencies were in all cases >80%, which was compatible with previously reported use of the same system (see Ref. 72Castro-Obregon S. del Rio G. Chen S. Frankowski H. Bredesen D.E. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 807-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar; see Figs. 4 and 6 therein). The dominant negative constructs evaluated were shown not to reduce NK1R expression (see Fig. 11). 24–48 h after the addition of SP, cell death was quantified as follows. The media containing floating cells were collected and centrifuged for 5 min at 2000 relative centrifugal force, the pellet was resuspended in PBS/trypan blue (1:10), and the blue cells were counted using a hematocytometer.Fig. 11The efficiency of the transfection of the NK1R plasmid is not affected by the co-transfection with plasmids encoding proteins that interfere with the death pathway activated by SP/NK1R. HEK293T cells were co-transfected at a ratio of 1:3 with the plasmid encoding NK1R and the following plasmids: GFP (A), dominant negative arrestin 2 (B), Nur77ΔDBD-GFP (C), Nur77ΔN152-GFP (D), or the empty vector (E). The transfected cells were identified by immunocytochemistry using an anti-NK1R antibody (the secondary antibody was Cy3-labeled (red)) or an anti-arrestin 2 antibody (the secondary antibody was coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate (green)) or by GFP expression. The Nur77 mutants are fused to GFP. The nucleus was stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The images were magnified × 400.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Expression of dominant negative Raf-1 inhibits SP/NK1R induction of cell death. Death induced by SP treatment of 293T cells transfected with NK1R was blocked by co-transfection of the Raf-1 dominant-negative mutant, c-Raf-C4. 24 h following co-transfection of empty vector (Control), NK1R and empty vector (NK1R+Control) or NK1R and c-Raf-C4 (NK1R+DN-Raf), SP was added to 293T cells, and cell death was quantified after 48 h by trypan blue exclusion. To eliminate any potential proapoptotic effects of c-Raf-C4 expression, all 293T cells were treated with the pancaspase inhibitor Boc-Asp(Ome)CH2F (35 μm) prior to transfection, a treatment shown previously to have no effect on nonapoptotic pcd mediated by NK1R.

Right panel, specific inhibition of MEK1 with siRNA targeting MEK1, but not MEK2, as revealed with an antibody with higher affinity for MEK1 than for MEK2 (MEK1); the siRNA targeting MEK2 reduced the amount of protein detected with an antibody that recognizes both MEK1 and MEK2; therefore, the band shown is likely to correspond to MEK1 that was not silenced by siMEK2 (MEK1 and MEK2 overlap in their gel migration) (MEK1/2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Nur77 plasmids were described by Li et al.

Science. 2000; 289: 1159-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar).Western Blot AnalysisFor the transfected HEK293T cells, the cells were washed with cold PBS after incubation with SP for the time indicated and homogenized in lysis buffer (150 μm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 50 μm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm Na3VaO3, 20 mm NaF, 20 mm glycero-2-phosphate, proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Cytoplasmic extracts were collected after a 10-min centrifugation at 14,000 relative centrifugal force. Protein was quantified by Bradford assay, and electrophoresis of equal amounts of total protein was performed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes at 4 °C for Western blot analysis. Membranes were probed with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-ERK1/2 or anti-phospho-ERK1/2, (BioSource, Camarillo, CA); a 1:8000 dilution of anti-GAPDH (Research Diagnostics, Flanders, NJ); 1:1000 dilution of anti-MEK1 monoclonal antibody (StressGen Biotechnologies Corp., Victoria, Canada); a 1:1000 dilution of anti-MEK1/2, anti-p38, anti-phospho-p38, anti-JNK1/2, anti-phospho-JNK1/2, or anti-phosphothreonine monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA); or a 1:200 dilution anti-Nur77 (M-210) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz CA). The membranes were incubated in the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody for 1 h followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection of the proteins with ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). The immunoprecipitations were carried out using superparamagnetic Microbeads conjugated to protein A, following the manufacturer's instructions (MACS; Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA).RNA Interference (RNAi)Synthesis—The siRNA was generated by in vitro transcription using the Silencer siRNA Construction Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX), following the manufacturer's instructions. Two regions were targeted for each gene, which resulted in similar levels of silencing with either siRNA, so both were combined. The accession numbers given below are from GenBank™. The regions targeted were ERK1 (accession number X60188) 245–265 and 1018–1038; ERK2 (accession number HUMERK2A) 466–486 and 1225–1245; MEK1 (accession number NM_002755) 241–261 and 1216–1236; MEK2 (accession number HUMMEK2NF) 562–582 and 1165–1185; Nur77 (accession number NM_173157) 943–953 and 1845–1865. The siRNA targeting GAPDH was synthesized using the oligonucleotides provided by the kit. An siRNA control sequence was synthesized targeting the region 153–173 of firefly luciferase gene from the plasmid pGL2-control (accession number X65324).siRNA Transfection—Human embryonic kidney 293T cells (105 cells/well in 12-well plates) were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) with no antibiotics for 16 h. Then NK1R cDNA was transfected as described above. 24 h later, the siRNA specific for each target gene was transfected with TransIT-TKO reagent (Mirus Corp., Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, for one well, 2 μl of TransIT-TKO and 20 nm siRNA (two target sequences for each gene were combined) were diluted with OPTI-MEM (Invitrogen) to make a final volume of 100 μl, incubated 15 min at room temperature, added to the cells, and incubated for 4 h at 37°C. Then 1 ml of fresh medium was added to each well and incubated for an additional 20 h. After that, 100 nm SP was administered for 24 h, and the samples were collected for Western and cell death assays. Alternatively, the siRNA was transfected with TransMessenger (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, for one well (5 × 104 cells/well, 24-well format), 1.6 μl of Enhancer R and 100 nm siRNA were diluted in buffer EC to obtain a final volume of 100 μl. After 10 min at room temperature, 4 μl of TransMessenger reagent were mixed gently and incubated for another 10 min at room temperature, and then the complex was diluted with 100 μl of OPTI-MEM. The media were removed from the wells, and the complex mixture was added to the cells and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C, after which time the media were replaced with fresh media and incubated for an additional 20 h. To estimate the efficiency of the transfection, the siRNAs for luciferase (as a sequence irrelevant for the mammalian genome) and ERK2 were chemically synthesized and fluorescently labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Xeragon-Qiagen, Valencia, CA).Microarray Generation and ProcessingCustom DNA microarrays were prepared from a Research Genetics human cDNA library (Invitrogen), by amplifying material using PCR from 8432 different cDNAs under standard conditions. This was facilitated through use of a volumetric robot (Genesis, RSP150; Tecan, Durham, NC) and several quality controls to verify the amplification of unique products for each gene, including gel electrophoretic sizing of all amplicons. Amplified products were transferred to 384-well plates and purified using commercially available kits (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA). The purified PCR products were transferred to 384-well print plates (Genetix, Beaverton, OR), dried, and resuspended in 6 μl of print buffer (50% Me2SO in 0.04× SSC). High density spotted cDNA microarrays were generated on commercially available glass slides (MWG Epoxy; MWG Biotech Inc., High Point, NC) with a commercial microarrayer (Omnigene; GeneMachines, San Carlos, CA) at the Genomics Facility of the Buck Institute. For each printed array, there were a total of 976 buffer controls, which facilitated differentiating signal from noise. The total number of analyzable genes per array, after removing PCR failures and genes with nondetectable expression, was 7483.Total RNA was prepared from four independent experiments of HEK293T cells transfected with NK1R and treated (or not) with SP for 30 min, 3 h, or 6 h. The RNA quality was assessed by measuring the size distribution on an Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) and by measuring the spectrophotometric 260/280 ratio (>1.8). RNA was labeled with either Cy3 or Cy5 using a commercially available kit (3DNA array 50, Genisphere Inc., Mahwah, NJ).Microarray Data Acquisition and AnalysisAfter hybridization and washing at high stringency, chips were scanned using a Packard Bioscience scanner (Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA), using ScanArray Express (version 1.1) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The scans were carried out using a PMT laser setting of 75 and power of 80. The resulting TIFF files were then analyzed using Quantarray 3 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using fixed circle and mean intensity for spot and background quantification. Data were LOWESS-normalized using the GeneTraffic software suite (Iobion Informatics, La Jolla, CA). For identifying statistically significant differential expression in the different treatment groups, eight hybridizations per gene (technical duplicates plus experimental duplicates) were analyzed. A list of the genes whose expression presented a mean log2 ratio (experimental/reference) of ≥0.6, with a coefficient of variance (COV = S.D./mean log2 ratio) of <30% were included, giving a total of 91 differentially regulated genes out of 7483.RESULTSSP/NK1R Death Signaling Is Independent of G-protein Activation—NK1R is a G-protein-coupled receptor that is connected by various second messengers to a wide variety of effector mechanisms to modulate cellular function.

https://openalex.org/W1983018722,"Mitotic entry, a critical decision point for maintaining genetic stability, is governed by the cyclin B/Cyclin dependent kinase 1 (Cdc2) complex. In Xenopus oocytes and early embryos, accumulation of cyclin B activates Cdk1, which then phosphorylates and activates the positive regulator Cdc25 in an autocatalytic feedback loop. However, cyclin B levels do not increase as some human cells approach mitosis, and the key factors regulating Cdk1 activation in human cells are unknown. We report here that reducing cyclin A expression by RNA interference (RNAi) in primary human fibroblasts inhibited activation of Cdc25B and Cdc25C and dephosphorylation of Cdk1 on tyrosine (tyr) 15. These results were reproduced in U2-OS cells by inducing the expression of a dominant-negative (dn) mutant of Cdk2, the principal cyclin A binding partner. Cdk2-dn induction could inhibit Cdc25B activity and foster Cdk1 tyr phosphorylation within the S phase, temporally dissociating these events from Cdk1 activation at mitosis. In contrast, reducing Cdk1 expression delayed mitotic entry without markedly impairing Cdc25B or Cdc25C activity. These results suggest that cyclin A/Cdk2 complexes are key regulators of Cdc25 and Cdk1 activation in human cells. This pathway appears to be commonly deregulated in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1981607645,"The attack of fungal cell walls by plant chitinases is an important plant defense response to fungal infection. Anti-fungal activity of plant chitinases is largely restricted to chitinases that contain a noncatalytic, plant-specific chitin-binding domain (ChBD) (also called Hevein domain). Current data confirm that the race-specific elicitor AVR4 of the tomato pathogen Cladosporium fulvum can protect fungi against plant chitinases, which is based on the presence of a novel type of ChBD in AVR4 that was first identified in invertebrates. Although these two classes of ChBDs (Hevein and invertebrate) are sequentially unrelated, they share structural homology. Here, we show that the chitin-binding sites of these two classes of ChBDs have different topologies and characteristics. The KD, ΔH, and ΔS values obtained for the interaction between AVR4 and chito-oligomers are comparable with those obtained for Hevein. However, the binding site of AVR4 is larger than that of Hevein, i.e. AVR4 interacts strictly with chitotriose, whereas Hevein can also interact with the monomer N-acetylglucosamine. Moreover, binding of additional AVR4 molecules to chitin occurs through positive cooperative protein-protein interactions. By this mechanism AVR4 is likely to effectively shield chitin on the fungal cell wall, preventing the cell wall from being degraded by plant chitinases.

Binding and conversion of carbohydrates by proteins is of fundamental importance in numerous biological processes, including (self and nonself) cell-cell recognition, cell adhesion, and carbohydrate turnover. Recently, protein domains responsible for this interaction have been reclassified into distinct carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) 1The abbreviations used are: CBM, carbohydrate-binding module; ChBD, chitin-binding domain; DP, degree of polymerization; ESI, electrospray ionization; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; MS, mass spectrometry; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; PR, pathogenesis-related; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin; UDA, U. dioica agglutinin.

CBMs are often present in carbohydrate-degrading enzymes, where they appear to mediate a prolonged and more intimate contact between the catalytic domain and insoluble carbohydrate polymers (2Bolam D.N.

Stintzi A. Fritig B. Legrand M. Plant J. 1998; 14: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Lectins, on the other hand, are carbohydrate-binding proteins that lack enzymatic activity but often contain tandem repeats of CBMs. Chitin, a polymer consisting of β-1,4-linked GlcNAc residues, is a major component of crustacean shells, insect exoskeletons, and fungal cell walls but is absent in plants. In higher organisms, two CBMs predominantly confer binding of proteins to chitin, i.e. the Hevein domain (hereafter denoted as CBM18) (4Beintema J.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and the invertebrate chitin-binding domain (CBM14) (5Shen Z. Jacobs-Lorena M. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 48: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). CBM18 is nearly exclusively found in plants (to date one additional member of CBM18 has been identified in Streptomyces griseus; Ref. 6Ohno T. Armand S. Hata T. Nikaidou N. Henrissat B. Mitsutomi M. Watanabe T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5065-5070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas CBM14 is commonly found in the genomes of baculoviridae, invertebrates, and mammals but absent in plants (5Shen Z. Jacobs-Lorena M. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 48: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Both ChBDs are typical CBMs, i.e. lectins with tandem repeats are known for both (e.g. wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) (7Chrispeels M.J. Raikhel N.V.

However, CBM18 is only fused to the plant-specific family 19 catalytic domain, whereas chitinases of mammals and invertebrates utilize CBM14 in combination with the family 18 catalytic domain. Sequence homology is missing between the two motifs, but the three-dimensional structure of Tachycitin revealed that CBM14 and CBM18 partially share their tertiary structure (9Suetake T. Tsuda S.

Originally, AVR4 was identified as an extracellular race-specific elicitor of C. fulvum that induces plant defense responses in tomato plants carrying the complementary Cf-4 resistance gene. Recognition of AVR4 is sufficient for induction of complete resistance in tomato against isolates of the fungus C. fulvum that carry the AVR4 encoding gene (13Joosten M.H.A.J.

The natural isolates of C. fulvum that were found to evade Cf-4-mediated resistance were reported to secrete protease-sensitive isoforms of AVR4, whereas native mature AVR4 (86 amino acids) is insensitive to these proteases (10van den Burg H.A.

The corresponding avr4 alleles in these isolates all contain single nucleotide polymorphisms causing in all but one case single amino acid substitutions (13Joosten M.H.A.J.

Among the Cf-4/AVR4-triggered plant defense responses are the hypersensitive response (i.e. a plant-specific programmed cell death response) and the accumulation of plant pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins (15Stintzi A.

The precursors of two well studied plant lectins, i.e. Hevein of Hevea brasilliensis and Urtica dioica agglutinin (UDA), are also chitinase-like proteins (PR-4), but their inactive catalytic domain is cleaved off during maturation, leaving only the ChBD (7Chrispeels M.J.

Can. J. Plant Pathol. 2001; 23: 216-235Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar). C. fulvum is reported to be insensitive to a combination of tomato chitinases and β-1,3-glucanases, at least under in vitro conditions (28Joosten M.H.A.J. Verbakel H.M. Nettekoven M.E. van Leeuwen J.

Studies using two other fungi, i.e. Trichoderma viride and Fusarium solani f.sp. phaseoli, showed that AVR4 can protect these two fungi against anti-fungal activity of PR-3 chitinases. 2H. A. van den Burg, S. Harrison, M. H. A. J. Joosten, P. J. G. M. de Wit, and J. Vervoort, submitted for publication. The protective effect was further substantiated by the observation that AVR4 binds to chitin present in the cell walls of these two fungi. To better understand the role of AVR4 during infection of tomato, we here examined the binding properties of AVR4 to chitin using soluble chito-oligomers. This system allows for a detailed comparison between AVR4 and CBM18 lectins (e.g. Hevein, Prohevein, UDA, and WGA). For the CBM18 lectins, the use of chito-oligomers has provided a detailed description of the chitin-binding site. In CBM18 lectins, the binding site consists of three binding subsites (a subsite is defined as all amino acids that interact with one sugar residue). Subsite +1 is formed by the residues Ser19, Trp23, and Tyr30, whereas Trp21 is involved in subsites +2 and +3 (29Wright C.S. J. Mol.

Here we show that binding of AVR4 requires at least a stretch of three GlcNAc residues. Using NMR, we identified several residues in AVR4 that are important for ligand binding. These residues are indeed positioned in the structural motif shared by CBM14 and CBM18, but they appear to highlight different binding sites rather than overlapping binding sites as compared with CBM18 (9Suetake T.

Materials—AVR4 was produced in culture by the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris and purified from culture fluids (37van den Burg H.A. de Wit P.J.G.M. Vervoort J. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). AVR9 was obtained by solid phase synthesis followed by oxidative folding (38Mahé E. Vossen P. van den Hooven H.W. Le-Nguyen D.

Biochem. 1999; 264: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Ribonuclease A was obtained from Sigma. Chito-oligomers (GlcNAc, N,N′-diacetylchitobiose (chitobiose), N,N′,N′-triacetylchitotriose, etc.) were purchased from Seikagaku (Tokyo, Japan). All of the solvents and chemicals used were of the highest grade available. Concentrations of AVR4 were determined by UV absorbance with ϵ280(AVR4) = 1.50 × 104m-1 cm-1. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—ITC measurements were performed at 298 K following standard procedures using a Microcal MCS titration calorimeter (40Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar). The reaction cell (with a volume of ∼1.35 ml) containing the AVR4 protein sample was continuously stirred while successive aliquots of ligand solution were added (final volume of the additions was 250 μl). Ligand and protein were dissolved in the same buffer. The AVR4 concentration in the cell was in the range of 90-360 μm depending on degree of polymerization (DP) of the chito-oligomer added (see legend of Fig. 1). The chito-oligomer concentrations used were 23, 20, 3.2, and 2.0 mm for DP = 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively. The integrated heat effects after correction for heat of dilution were analyzed using standard software provided by Microcal Inc. The cumulative heat effect (Q) during the titration process for a simple set of binding sites is given by the following equations, Q=MtV0nvΔH(Eq. 1) where Mt is the macromolecule concentration in the calorimetric cell, characterized by the volume (V0), n is the number of binding sites with a binding enthalpy of ΔH, and ν is the fractional saturation of the binding sites, which can be related to the apparent association constant (KA) and to the total ligand concentration (LT), KA=v/[(1-v)LT](Eq. 2) LT=Lf+Mtnv(Eq. 3) where Lf is the concentration of free ligand. Other thermodynamic parameters were calculated using the following standard thermodynamic equation. -RTlnKA=ΔG=ΔH-TΔS(Eq. 4) Tryptophan Fluorescence Quenching—The fluorescence measurements were performed with a Varian Cary Eclipse thermostatted at 293 K. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm with an excitation slit of 2.5 nm. Emission intensities were collected over the wavelength range of 315-400 nm with an emission slit of 5 nm. The spectra were the averages of three scans and corrected for the effect of dilution, buffer, and chito-oligomer additions. Quantitative binding experiments were performed in a volume of 3 ml to which aliquots of a ligand solution (5-30 μl) were added under continuous stirring. AVR4 was dissolved at a protein concentration of 3.6 μm in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 50 mm sodium chloride. Chito-oligomers were dissolved in the same buffer at a concentration of 38, 30, 16, and 2.0 mm for a DP = 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively. The maximum change in volume caused by the ligand additions was less than 5%. The fluorescence quenching at full saturation of binding (F∞) was estimated by plotting 1/(F0 - F) versus 1/[S], and extrapolating to the y axis, where F0 is the fluorescence intensity of AVR4 without ligand, and F is the fluorescence intensity of AVR4 at the chito-oligomer concentration [S]. Association constants (KA) were estimated using two methods: the fluorescence quenching titration equivalent of the Hill Plot (i.e. log (F0-F/F - F∞) versus log [S]) (41Privat J.P. Delmotte F. Mialonier G. Bouchard P. Monsigny M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 47: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and Scatchard plot analysis (i.e. ν/Lfversus ν) (42Lee R.T. Gabius H.J. Lee Y.C. Glyconj. J. 1998; 15: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Size Exclusion Chromatography—pH-dependent size exclusion chromatography was performed at 293 K using a Superdex-75 (HR 10/30; Amersham Biosciences) column operated at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The apparent molecular mass of the oligomeric/complexed state of AVR4 (25 μm in 50 μl of injection volume) was estimated from a standard curve produced at different pH values (5.0, 7.0, and 8.6) in buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate and 150 mm potassium chloride. The standard curves were obtained by plotting the log molecular mass of protein standards (aprotinin, insulin, ubiquitin, ribonuclease 5A, serum albumin (all bovine), horse myoglobin, chicken albumin, and blue dextran) versus Kav. The Kav is defined as follows, Kav=(VE-VV)/(VB-VV)(Eq. 5) where VE is the elution volume, VV is the void volume, and VB is the bed volume of the column matrix. Mass Spectrometry—ESI-MS was performed with a Q-Tof Ultima Global mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation, MS Technologies Centre, UK). AVR4 and the chito-oligomers were dissolved in 10 mm ammonium acetate/acetic acid (pH range, 5.0-8.6). The sample infusion flow rate was 10 μl/min. The instrument settings were: capillary potential, 3 kV; cone voltage, 100 V; desolvation gas flow rate, 150 liters/h; source temperature, 90 °C; and radio frequency 1, 225 kHz; and the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization strip was positioned at 3600 arbitrary units resulting in an elevated intermediate pressure of 4.35 mbar. The instrument was operated under standard ESI conditions. Calibration of the TOF analyzer was performed with a CsI solution of 2 mg/ml in isopropanol/water (50:50, v/v) over the mass range of 800-7100 Da. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy—The NMR samples contained typically 1.5 mm13C/15N AVR4 dissolved in 20 mm acetate-d4, pH 4.6, and 50 mm sodium chloride. Isotopic labeling and purification of AVR4 was performed as described (37van den Burg H.A. de Wit P.J.G.M. Vervoort J. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). All of the NMR samples were prepared in a mixture of 95% H2O, 5% D2O (v/v) and contained trace amounts of sodium azide as preservative. All of the NMR spectra were acquired at 298 K on Varian Inova 500, 600, or 800 MHz, and Bruker AMX500 spectrometers. Triple and double resonance heteronuclear NMR experiments performed to obtain backbone and side chain assignments of AVR4 included three-dimensional HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, (H)CCH-TOCSY, and HC(C)H-TOCSY (Protein Pack; Varian Inc.). The assignment was performed using the standard assignment procedures based on triple and double resonance NMR spectra. First, 15N HSQC spectra were used to obtain a set of 1H-15N resonance frequencies. Sequential assignment was then performed using these shift pairs in combination with HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCACB, and CBCA(CO)NH spectra. Assignment of the nonaromatic side chain resonances was obtained by means of (H)CCH-TOCSY and HC(C)HTOCSY spectra. A 15N NOE spectroscopy-HSQC (43Marion D. Driscoll P.C. Kay L.E. Wingfield P.T.

All of the data processing and analysis were done using the programs NMRPipe (44Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11570) Google Scholar) and XEASY (45Bartels C. Xia T.H. Billeter M. Guntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar), respectively. The chemical shifts of Tachycitin were retrieved from BioMagResBank (www.bmrb.wisc.edu). NMR Titration Experiments—Binding of chito-oligomers to AVR4 was followed by recording 1H-15N HSQC spectra at five different temperatures. Thereto, temperature in the NMR tube was carefully calibrated by referencing the water resonance to sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate. The protein concentration was kept constant during the titration (1 mm), whereas the ligand concentration was increased in successive steps (30Asensio J.L. Cañada F.J. Bruix M. Rodriguez R.A. Jiménez B.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 621-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). As buffer we used 20 mm acetate-d4, pH 6.0, and 150 mm NaCl. Final concentrations of the ligands were 50 mm GlcNAc, 35 mm (GlcNAc)2, 27.2 mm (GlcNAc)3, and 3.5 mm (Glc-NAc)6. The association constants (KA) were estimated using a NMR derivative of the Scatchard plot, (Δ/Δ0)/[L1]=-KAn+KA(Δ/Δ0)(Eq. 6) where Δ = δobserved - δfree and Δ0 = δsaturated - δfree. Thermodynamic parameters (ΔH and ΔS) were estimated from a van't Hoff plot based on a set of KA values obtained from a set of backbone resonances. Ligand Binding Studies—Recent studies using affinity precipitation showed that AVR4 specifically binds to chitin and not to other polysaccharides. 2H. A. van den Burg, S. Harrison, M. H. A. J. Joosten, P. J. G. M. de Wit, and J. Vervoort, submitted for publication. These studies included, besides chitin, the polymers cellulose, xylan, curdlan (β-1,3-glucan), lichenan, and chitosan (i.e. deacytelated chitin). Calorimetric Titrations—ITC was used to determine the affinity of AVR4 for linear soluble chitin fragments. No heat of binding was detected when 50 mm GlcNAc or 50 mm (GlcNAc)2 (chitiobiose) was added to AVR4. The addition of longer chitooligomers resulted, however, in substantial heat of binding (Table I). The binding curves obtained for (GlcNAc)3, (GlcNAc)4, and (GlcNAc)5 could be fitted, assuming a onebinding site model (Fig. 1, A-C). The binding curve obtained for (GlcNAc)6 deviated from a one-binding site model. However, a model with two AVR4 binding sites per one (GlcNAc)6 molecule described accurately the binding event (Fig. 1D). This second AVR4-binding site was not observed for (GlcNAc)5 (Fig. 1C). Together, these results suggest that AVR4 exclusively interacts with (GlcNAc)3 repeats. In contrast, CBM18 lectins already bind to one GlcNAc molecule (33Asensio J.L. Canada F.J. Siebert H.C.

Open table in a new tab The dissociation constant (KD) found for the binding of (GlcNAc)6 to AVR4 is ∼45 times lower than the KD observed for (GlcNAc)5 and ∼200 times lower than the KD observed for (GlcNAc)4 (Table I). This decreased KD for (GlcNAc)6 originates from a steep decrease in ΔH as compared with ΔH for (GlcNAc)5 (concomitantly, a small negative contribution to binding comes from a slight decrease in the ΔS). The substantially decreased ΔH could indicate that positive allosteric interactions occur between the two AVR4 molecules that bind to one (GlcNAc)6. Additionally, a substantial part of the decreased ΔH could originate from a decrease in the solvent-exposed area of the two bound AVR4 molecules. The existence of such a protein-protein interaction is supported by the fact that the number of binding sites (n) appears to be pH-dependent with an apparent pKa of ∼4 (Table II). This implies protonation of an acidic residue (i.e. Asp or Glu), which could effectively disrupt an interaction at the protein-protein interface.Table IIThe average result of at least three independent experiments is shownpHKA × 10−3KDΔGΔHTΔSΔS1/nan is the number of AVR4-binding sites at the chito-oligomer, not fixed.m−1μmKcal mol−1Kcal mol−1Kcal mol−1cal mol−1K−13.4bIn 50 mm potassium acetate buffer, 150 mm sodium chloride.74 ± 713.5 ± 1.2−6.6 ± 0.06−8.8 ± 0.20−2.2 ± 0.26−7.4 ± 0.871.05 ± 0.034.4104 ± 89.6 ± 0.7−6.8 ± 0.05−10.3 ± 0.04−3.5 ± 0.09−11.7 ± 0.300.65 ± 0.045.3121 ± 118.2 ± 0.7−6.9 ± 0.05−10.4 ± 0.05−3.5 ± 0.10−11.7 ± 0.340.73 ± 0.035.9cIn 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, 150 mm sodium chloride.149 ± 136.7 ± 0.5−7.1 ± 0.05−10.0 ± 0.05−2.9 ± 0.10−9.7 ± 0.340.62 ± 0.036.9155 ± 116.4 ± 0.4−7.1 ± 0.05−10.3 ± 0.03−3.2 ± 0.08−10.7 ± 0.270.54 ± 0.047.9136 ± 97.3 ± 0.4−7.0 ± 0.05−9.3 ± 0.04−2.3 ± 0.09−7.7 ± 0.300.63 ± 0.02a n is the number of AVR4-binding sites at the chito-oligomer, not fixed.b In 50 mm potassium acetate buffer, 150 mm sodium chloride.c In 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, 150 mm sodium chloride. Open table in a new tab The slight decrease of ΔS found for the binding of (GlcNAc)6 to AVR4 as compared with (GlcNAc)5 and (GlcNAc)4 suggests that an increased number of translations and rotations in the sugar chain is restrained upon binding of AVR4 to (GlcNAc)6. Potentially each of the GlcNAc residues is restrained because of the interaction with the two AVR4 molecules leading to an overall reduced flexibility of (GlcNAc)6. Correspondingly, a certain degree of freedom should remain in the chito-oligomer chain for (GlcNAc)4 and (GlcNAc)5 when bound to AVR4. Indeed, ΔS is increased for both (GlcNAc)4 and (GlcNAc)5 as compared with (GlcNA"
https://openalex.org/W2139395736,"The facultative intracellular pathogen Bartonella henselae is responsible for a broad range of clinical manifestations, including the formation of vascular tumors as a result of increased proliferation and survival of colonized endothelial cells. This remarkable interaction with endotoxin-sensitive endothelial cells and the apparent lack of septic shock are considered to be due to a reduced endotoxic activity of the B. henselae lipopolysaccharide. Here, we show that B. henselae ATCC 49882T produces a deep-rough-type lipopolysaccharide devoid of O-chain and report on its complete structure and Toll-like receptor-dependent biological activity. The major short-chain lipopolysaccharide was studied by chemical analyses, electrospray ionization, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, as well as by NMR spectroscopy after alkaline deacylation. The carbohydrate portion of the lipopolysaccharide consists of a branched trisaccharide containing a glucose residue attached to position 5 of an α-(2→4)-linked 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid disaccharide. Lipid A is a pentaacylated β-(1′→6)-linked 2,3-diamino-2,3-dideoxy-glucose disaccharide 1,4′-bisphosphate with two amide-linked residues each of 3-hydroxydodecanoic and 3-hydroxyhexadecanoic acids and one residue of either 25-hydroxyhexacosanoic or 27-hydroxyoctacosanoic acid that is O-linked to the acyl group at position 2′. The lipopolysaccharide studied activated Toll-like receptor 4 signaling only to a low extent (1,000–10,000-fold lower compared with that of Salmonella enterica sv.

Some unusual structural features of the B. henselae lipopolysaccharide, including the presence of a long-chain fatty acid, which are shared by the lipopolysaccharides of other bacteria causing chronic intracellular infections (e.g. Legionella and Chlamydia), may provide the molecular basis for low endotoxic potency.

Bartonella henselae is an emerging zoonotic pathogen. In the feline reservoir host this cat flea-borne Gram-negative pathogen causes a long lasting intraerythrocytic bacteremia associated with little or no symptoms of disease (1Dehio C. Trends Microbiol. 2001; 9: 279-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). B. henselae is transmitted to humans by cat scratch or bite or the bite of an infected cat flea. Human infection results in a broad range of clinical manifestations, which often have a chronic course. Catscratch disease is a necrotizing inflammatory lymphadenitis typically associated with fever, which represents the most common disease manifestation in immunocompetent patients. Prolonged febrile bacteremic syndrome is a frequent disease manifestation of immunocompromized patients, which, unlike bacteremia by most other Gram-negative bacteria, has never been reported to result in septic shock. Bacillary angiomatosis and bacillary peliosis are angioproliferative lesions also found primarily in immunocompromised hosts (2Karem K.L. Paddock C.D. Regnery R.L. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 1193-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Angioproliferation stimulated by B. henselae is a remarkable pathogenic process which represents a unique model to study pathogen-triggered tumor formation. Judged from the histology of bacillary angiomatosis and bacillary peliosis lesions, bacteria are in direct contact with the endothelium, probably triggering both endothelial cell proliferation and proinflammatory activation. Therefore, endothelial cells appear to represent a specific and unique target of B. henselae, and a detailed analysis of the bacteria-endothelial cell interactions is thus vital for understanding the pathophysiology of this emerging infection. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells have been used as an in vitro model to study important steps in the interaction of B. henselae with endothelial cells. This facultative intracellular pathogen invades endothelial cells by two different processes, either (i) by conventional endocytosis of single bacteria or small bacterial aggregates, which results in perinuclear-localizing intravacuolar bacteria, or (ii) by the invasion of large bacterial aggregates by a host cell-driven process referred to as invasome-mediated internalization (3Dehio C. Meyer M. Berger J. Schwarz H. Lanz C. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2141-2154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). B. henselae is considered to provoke angioproliferation by at least two independent mechanisms (4Dehio C. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar): directly, by triggering proliferation (5Maeno N. Oda H. Yoshiie K. Wahid M.R. Fujimura T. Matayoshi S. Microb. Pathog. 1999; 27: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and inhibiting apoptosis of endothelial cells (6Kirby J.E. Nekorchuk D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4656-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and indirectly, by stimulating a paracrine angiogenic loop of vascular endothelial growth factor production by infected macrophages (7Resto-Ruiz S.I. Schmiederer M. Sweger D. Newton C. Klein T.W. Friedman H. Anderson B.E. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 4564-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).

The LPS from enteric bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, are highly potent molecules with regard to their biological, i.e. endotoxic activities. The lipid A portion is responsible for these activities of the enterobacterial LPS (8Erridge C. Bennett-Guerrero E. Poxton I.R. Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 837-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells sense the endotoxin by soluble CD14 and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), resulting in the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-dependent activation of a proinflammatory response. This phenotype is characterized by the up-regulation of the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and E-selectin and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (9Faure E. Equils O. Sieling P.A. Thomas L. Zhang F.X. Kirschning C.J. Polentarutti N. Muzio M. Arditi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11058-11063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). B. henselae infection of human umbilical vein endothelial cells results in a prominant NF-κB-dependent proinflammatory activation (10Fuhrmann O. Arvand M. Gohler A. Schmid M. Krull M. Hippenstiel S. Seybold J. Dehio C. Suttorp N. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 5088-5097Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 11Schmid M.C. Schulein R. Dehio M. Denecker G. Carena I. Dehio C. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, this process is triggered by proteinacious components of the bacteria rather than by LPS (10Fuhrmann O. Arvand M. Gohler A. Schmid M. Krull M. Hippenstiel S. Seybold J. Dehio C. Suttorp N. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 5088-5097Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A mutant defective for the bacterial type IV secretion system VirB was shown to display only minimal activation of NF-κB, suggesting that bacterial effector proteins translocated by this system into endothelial cells are responsible for the proinflammatory phenotype observed during infection with wild-type B. henselae (11Schmid M.C. Schulein R. Dehio M. Denecker G. Carena I. Dehio C. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Moreover, in contrast to wild type, the VirB-defective mutant displayed any noticeable toxic effect on endothelial cells, even at very high infection doses (11Schmid M.C. Schulein R. Dehio M. Denecker G. Carena I. Dehio C. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Assuming that LPS is not affected in the VirB-defective mutant, the LPS of B. henselae appears to be devoid of toxicity for endothelial cells (11Schmid M.C. Schulein R. Dehio M. Denecker G. Carena I. Dehio C. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This observation together with the apparent absence of septic shock in bacteremic patients indicates that the LPS of this pathogen is of low endotoxic activity. The B. henselae LPS should thus be interesting in regard to structure/function analysis. This LPS is composed of a major rough-type form (R-form, lacking O-chain), and a minor smooth-type form (S-form, containing O-chain) (12Kyme P. Dillon B. Iredell J. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, despite the presence of a long-chain fatty acid (13Bhat U.R. Carlson R.W. Busch M. Mayer H. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1991; 41: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), no information is available regarding the structure of B. henselae LPS and lipid A. Based on the limited information available, a simliar LPS is found in the closely related species B. bacilliformis and B. quintana, which represent the only other known pathogens capable of triggering angioproliferative lesions in humans. The B. bacilliformis LPS is also composed of a minor S-form and a major R-form, the latter being poorly immunogenic in rabbits (14Minnick M.F. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 2644-2648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistently, the B. quintana LPS was described to be predominantly of a “deep-rough” chemotype (15Liberto M.C. Matera G. Microbiologica. 2000; 13: 449-456Google Scholar) and was further shown to possess a lower endotoxic activity on whole blood cells and endothelial cells than typical endotoxins (15Liberto M.C. Matera G. Microbiologica. 2000; 13: 449-456Google Scholar, 16Liberto M.C. Matera G. Lamberti A.G. Barreca G.S. Quirino A. Foca A. Diagn. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 2003; 45: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe elucidation of the structure of a short-chain LPS representing the major LPS species from B. henselae ATCC 49882T. The unusual structural features of this novel LPS are: (i) pentaacyl lipid A, containing a GlcN3N disaccharide bisphosphate [4′-P-β-d-GlcpN3N-(1→6)-α-d-GlcpN3N-1→P] as the lipid A backbone and a long-chain fatty acid, namely 26:0(25-OH) or 28:0(27-OH), and (ii) a small and unique inner core composed of an α-(2→4)-linked 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) disaccharide with one glucose residue attached. Moreover, we demonstrated that this LPS has a low endotoxic potential as measured by TLR4 signaling and, in contrast to LPS from some other pathogens, does not activate TLR2-signaling to any considerable extend. The structure and biological activity of the B. henselae ATCC 49882T short-chain LPS displays interesting parallels with LPS of rhizobacteria, which are phylogenetically related intracellular plant symbionts, as well as with some human pathogens poorly related to B. hensleae (e.g. Legionella and Chlamydia), which, however, share the intracellular life style and the typical chronic course of infection. Bacterial Strains and Cultivation—B. henselae ATCC 49882T isolated from the blood of an human immunodeficiency virus-positive febrile patient was obtained from the Collection de l'Institut Pasteur (CIP), Paris, France. B. henselae IBS 113 isolated from the blood of a bacteremic cat was kindly provided by Dr. Y. Piemont, Hopital Louis Pasteur, University of Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France. B. henselae ATCC 49882T was grown for 3 days on Columbia agar containing 5% defibrinated sheep blood at 35 °C in a humidified atmosphere. Small Scale Isolation of LPS for SDS-PAGE—Bacterial LPS was isolated from proteinase K-treated whole bacteria, separated by Tricine-SDS-PAGE and stained by oxidative silver staining as previously described for Bordetella spp. (17van den Akker W.M.R. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 1527-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Preparative Isolation of LPS—Bacteria were harvested from 500 plates in phosphate-buffered saline and washed twice in distilled water, followed each time by centrifugation for 30 min at 18,000 × g. The bacterial pellet was finally suspended in a small volume of aqueous 0.5% phenol. Dried bacteria (3.1 g) were washed successively with ethanol (300 ml), acetone (300 ml), and diethyl ether (300 ml) and dried in air overnight. The pellet was suspended in water (250 ml), treated first with RNase and DNase (2 mg each) at stirring over night at room temperature, then with proteinase K (2 mg) for 24 h at 20 °C, dialyzed extensively (4 days) against distilled water, and centrifuged. The precipitate was washed with acetone, suspended in water, and lyophilized (final yield of washed bacteria: 1.63 g). Attempts to isolate LPS by direct extraction of the digested dried bacterial cells described above using the phenol-water (P/W) (18Westphal O. Jann K. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1965; 5: 83-91Google Scholar) or phenol/chloroform/petrol ether procedures (19Galanos C. Luderitz O. Westphal O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 9: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar) were not satisfactory. After extensive enzyme digestions using proteinase K in the presence of SDS, mercaptoethanol, and lysozyme, sufficient quantities of B. henselae LPS for analytical studies could be extracted by the phenol/chloroform/petrol ether (2:5:8, v/v/v) procedure (19Galanos C. Luderitz O. Westphal O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 9: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). To remove non-LPS lipids, prior to extraction cells were washed three times with a 1:1 (v/v) chloroform/methanol mixture, centrifuged, and dried in a stream of nitrogen. To remove residual protein from this crude LPS perparation, the protocol of Hirschfeld et al. (20Hirschfeld M. Weis J.H. Vogel S. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar) was used. An aliquot of the extract containing 5 mg of LPS gave 2.9 mg of purified LPS, which showed no banding pattern in SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. O-Deacylation of LPS—LPS (14 mg) was dried over P2O5 and treated with anhydrous hydrazine (0.5 ml) at 37 °C for 35 min at ultrasonication. Acetone (5 ml) was added in the cold and the precipitate was separated by centrifugation, washed twice with acetone, dissolved in water (3 ml), and lyophilized. The product was treated with anhydrous hydrazine at 37 °C for 1.5 h and treated as above to give O-deacylated LPS (11 mg). Alkaline Degradation of LPS—O-Deacylated LPS (11 mg) was heated with 4 m KOH (1 ml) at 120 °C for 23.5 h, and the reaction mixture was diluted with water (5 ml), neutralized at 0 °C with 2 m HCl (2 ml), and extracted with chloroform (2 × 4 ml). After separation of phases the precipitate was washed with water (2 × 2 ml), the combined water phase and washings were lyophilized. The product was desalted by gel chromatography on Sephadex G-50 in pyridinium acetate buffer, pH 4.5 (4 ml of pyridine and 10 ml of HOAc in 1 liter of water), and fractionated by HPAEC using a Dionex system with pulsed amperometric detection on an analytical CarboPac PA1 column (250 × 4.6 mm) in a linear gradient of 0.15 → 0.5 m NaOAc in 0.1 m NaOH for 70 min at 1 ml/min. 1-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by HPAEC using the same gradient for 30 min at 1 ml/min. Four products with retention times 19.25, 21.35, 24.75 (major, 300 μg), and 28.10 min in the analytical run were isolated and desalted on a column (40 × 2.5 cm) of Sephadex G-50 in pyridinium acetate buffer, pH 4.5. Mild Acid Degradation of LPS—LPS (0.4 mg) was hydrolyzed with 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.4, at 100 °C for 2 h, and the supernatant was deionized with an IR-120 (H+-form) cation-exchange resin and analyzed by HPAEC in a linear gradient of 0.01 → 0.08 m NaOAc in 0.1 m NaOH for 30 min at 1 ml/min, which showed the presence of two compounds with retention times of 23.38 and 24.55 min. Composition Analyses—For analysis of Kdo, LPS was methanolyzed with 0.5 m HCl in methanol at 85 °C for 45 min. After removal of the solvent, the products were peracetylated with Ac2O in pyridine (1:1.5, v/v, 85 °C, 20 min). For analysis of Glc and GlcN3N, LPS was methanolyzed with 2 m HCl in methanol at 85 °C for 16 h, then hydrolyzed with 4 m CF3CO2H at 100 °C for 2 h, conventionally borohydride-reduced and peracetylated (21Sawardeker J.S. Sloneker J.H. Jeanes A. Anal. Chem. 1965; 37: 1602-1605Crossref Scopus (1484) Google Scholar). For fatty acid analysis, LPS was methanolyzed with 2 m HCl in methanol at 85 °C for 20 h, and sugars were trimethylsilylated with N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (22Sonesson A. Moll H. Jantzen E. Zähringer U. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 106: 315-320PubMed Google Scholar). The sugar and fatty acid derivatives were analyzed by GLC on a Hewlett-Packard HP 5890 Series II chromatograph, equipped with a 30-m fused silica SPB-5 column (Supelco) using a temperature gradient of 150 °C (3 min) → 320 °C at 5°/min, and GLC-MS on a Hewlett-Packard HP 5989A instrument equipped with a 30-m HP-5MS column (Hewlett-Packard) under the same chromatographic conditions as in GLC. Methylation Analysis—O-Deacylated LPS was dephosphorylated with aqueous 48% hydrofluoric acid (4 °C, 16 h), methylated with CH3I in dimethyl sulfoxide in the presence of solid NaOH (23Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3215) Google Scholar), and hydrolyzed with 2 m CF3CO2H (100 °C, 2 h). The partially methylated monosaccharides were borohydride-reduced, and Kdo was converted into the methyl ester by evaporation with 0.5 m HCl in methanol, peracetylated, borohydride reduced, peracetylated, and analyzed by GLC and GLC-MS as described above. Mass Spectrometry—MALDI-TOF MS was performed on a Bruker-Reflex II instrument (Bruker-Franzen Analytik, Bremen, Germany) in linear configuration in the negative mode at an acceleration voltage of 20 kV and delayed ion extraction. Samples were dissolved in chloroform at a concentration of 5 μg/μl, and 2 μl of solution was mixed with 2 μl of 0.5 m 2,4,6-trihydroxyacetophenone (Aldrich) in methanol as matrix solution. 1-μl aliquots were deposited on a metallic sample holder and analyzed immediately after drying in a stream of air. ESI FT-ICR MS/MS was performed using a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass analyzer (ApexII, Bruker Daltonics) equipped with a 7-tesla actively shielded magnet and an Apollo electrospray ion source. Samples were dissolved in a 30:30:0.01 (v/v/v) mixture of 2-propanol, water, and triethylamine at a concentration of ∼20 ng/μl and sprayed with a flow rate of 2 μl/min. For IRMPD MS/MS, a 40-watt CO2 laser (Synrad Inc., Mukilteo, WA) operating at λ = 10.6 μm was used. Laser power was set to 50% of maximal value. Duration of irradiation was controlled via the XMASS software (Bruker Daltonics) for optimal fragmentation (typically 50 ms). NMR Spectroscopy—Prior to the measurements, the samples were lyophilized twice from 2H2O. The 1H and 31P NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker DRX-600 spectrometer (Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany) at 600 and 243 MHz, respectively, at 27 °C in 99.96% 2H2O. Chemical shifts were referenced to internal sodium 3-trimethylsilylpropanoate-d4 (δH 0) and external aqueous 85% H3PO4 (δP 0). Bruker software XWINNMR 2.5 was used to acquire and process the data. A mixing time of 100 and 200 ms was used in two-dimensional TOCSY and ROESY experiments, respectively. Activation of HEK/HEK-CD14 Cells—For transient transfection, HEK293 cells were plated at a density of 5·104/ml in 96-well plates in Dulbecocc's modified Eagle's medium without G418. The following day, cells were transfected using Polyfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Expression plasmid containing human CD14 was a kind gift of Dr. D. T. Golenbock, Worcester, MA, and the FLAG-tagged versions of human TLR2 and human TLR4 were a kind gift from P. Nelson, Seattle, WA and subcloned into pREP9 (Invitrogen). The human MD-2 expression plasmid was a kind gift from K. Miyake, Tokyo, Japan. TLR2 and TLR4 plasmids were used at 200 ng/transfection, CD14 and MD-2 plasmids were used at 25 ng/transfection. The total DNA content was kept constant at 250 ng/transfection using pCDNA3 (Invitrogen). After 24 h of transfection, cells were washed and stimulated with LPS for another 18 h. Finally, supernatants were collected and the interleukin-8 content was quantified using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (BIOSOURCE). Bacterial lipopeptide (Pam3CysSK4) was obtained from EMC micro-collections, Tübingen, Germany, and LPS from S. enterica sv. Friedenau was kindly provided by H. Brade, Borstel, Germany. Purification of B. henselae LPS and Analysis by SDS-PAGE—Crude LPS extracts from B. henselae isolated following proteinase K treatment of whole cells was separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. Consistent with a recent study examining the LPS composition of several B. henselae strains (12Kyme P. Dillon B. Iredell J. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we observed for strains ATCC 49882T (Fig. 1A, lane 1) and IBS 113 (lane 2) the presence of at least two LPS species of different electrophoretic mobility, an R-form of about 3 kDa as the major constituent and at least one S-form of >20 kDa as a minor constituent. LPS was then isolated in preparative scale from cells of B. henselae ATCC 49882T by phenol/chloroform/petrol ether extraction (19Galanos C. Luderitz O. Westphal O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 9: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar) following extensive digestion of bacterial cells with proteolytic enzymes. Extraction with chloroform/methanol was necessary to remove non-LPS lipids. When this purified LPS was tested, no high molecular mass S-form LPS was observed (Fig. 1B, lane 1), indicating selective enrichment of the R-form during phenol/chloroform/petrol ether extraction. The mobility of the R-form LPS was in the range between that of E. coli deep-rough mutant strain F515 (chemotype Re, containing two Kdo residues as the core oligosaccharide; Fig. 1B, lane 2) and S. enterica sv. Minnesota rough mutant R7 (chemotype Rd1, containing two Kdo and two heptose residues; Fig. 1B, lane 3). Therefore, B. henselae ATCC 49882T produces a short-chain R-form LPS with a core ranged in size between di- and tetrasaccharide. Chemical and Mass Spectrometric Characteriztaion of LPS— Sugar analysis of the purified LPS showed the presence of Glc, Kdo, and GlcN3N, but no GlcN. Most likely, Glc and Kdo are components of the core oligosaccharide portion of LPS, whereas GlcN3N has been previously identified in the lipid A backbone of several bacteria (24Zähringer U. Lindner B. Rietschel E.T. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1994; 50: 211-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Fatty acid analysis revealed 12:0(3-OH), 16:0(3-OH), 26:0(25-OH), and 28:0(27-OH) as the major constituents, together with 12:1(3-OH), 14:0(3-OH), 18:0(3-OH) as minor constituents, and a negligible amount of 18:1(3-OH). Methylation analysis of the O-deacylated dephosphorylated LPS, including carboxyl reduction of Kdo, demonstrated 4,5-disubstituted Kdo (KdoI), terminal Glc, and terminal Kdo (KdoII). These data indicated that the LPS core is a branched trisaccharide composed of one Glc and two Kdo residues. A minor amount of a 5-substituted Kdo residue was also detected, which, most likely, resulted from a partial elimination of the terminal Kdo residue in the course of dephosphorylation of LPS under acidic conditions (25Knirel Y.A. Helbig J.H. Zähringer U. Carbohydr. Res. 1996; 283: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The charge-deconvoluted negative ion ESI FT-ICR mass spectrum of LPS (Fig. 2) showed two major molecular ion peaks at m/z 2399.44 (MI) and 2427.45 (MII) and a minor peak at m/z 2455.50. Taking into account the composition of LPS, the major peaks could be assigned to LPS species containing a GlcKdo2 trisaccharide and a bisphosphoryl di-GlcN3N lipid A backbone acylated with two residues each of 12:0(3-OH) and 16:0(3-OH) and one residue of either 26:0(25-OH) or 28:0(27-OH). The minor compound may differ in the replacement of one 12:0(3-OH) or 16:0(3-OH) residue with a residue of 14:0(3-OH) or 18:0(3-OH), respectively. Furthermore, the spectrum exhibited minor peaks representing compounds missing one phosphate group (m/z 2319.47, 2347.50, and 2365.51) or those containing one unsaturated fatty acid (m/z 2397.43, 2425.45, and 2453.50). Unlabelled peaks in Fig. 2 represent sodium adduct ions. Positive ion ESI FT-ICR IRMPD MS/MS of triethylammonium salt of LPS was performed using the molecular ion at m/z at 2501.41 (MI-salt) as the parent ion (Fig. 3). The spectrum showed ion peaks due to subsequent loss of triethylammonium phosphate (m/z 2302.45) and Kdo (m/z 2082.40) or the GlcKdo2 trisaccharide (m/z 1700.28, lipid A ion). The monophosphoryl lipid A ion was further cleaved to give β- and γ-fragment ions (according to the nomenclature of Domon and Costello) at m/z 1087.80 and an ion from the reducing end at m/z 613.48 (711.48, P), respectively. This fragmentation pattern showed that each GlN3N residue in lipid A bears one 12:0(3-OH), one 16:0(3-OH), and one phosphate group and that in MI the 26: 0(25-OH) residue is attached to the non-reducing GlcN3N residue (GlcN3NII). Alkaline Degradation of LPS and Structure of the Carbohydrate Core-Lipid A Backbone—LPS was O-deacylated with anhydrous hydrazine. As expected, the negative ion ESI FT-ICR mass spectrum of the O-deacylated LPS showed ion peaks at m/z 2005.04 (major) and 2033.08 (minor) for LPS species with four N-linked fatty acids. Further N-deacylation of the O-deacylated LPS resulted in a mixture of four oligosaccharide bisphosphates, which were separated by HPAEC. In negative ion ESI FT-ICR MS/MS, the major compound (1) with the HPAEC retention time 24.75 min showed a molecular ion peak at m/z 1099.28 and thus has the full core trisaccharide. The other compounds have a truncated core lacking either KdoII or Glc or both KdoII and Glc (molecular ions at m/z 879.22, 937.22, and 717.17, respectively) (data not shown). The content of the KdoII-lacking product with the retention time 19.25 min was twice as low as that of the major compound, whereas the two Glc-lacking products were present in negligible amounts. Since no compound with a truncated core was detected in MS studies on the whole LPS, the minor compounds resulted from partial cleavage of the glycosidic linkages under strong alkaline conditions. Compound 1 was studied by high-field NMR spectroscopy. The 1H NMR spectrum of compound 1 (Fig. 4) showed signals for three anomeric protons at δ 4.32, 5.22, and 5.26, protons at nitrogen-bearing carbons (H-2 and H-3) of two GlcN3N residues at δ 2.48, 2.55, 2.61, and 2.82, and methylene groups of two Kdo residues at δ 1.72, 1.92 (both H-3ax), 2.02, and 2.05 (both H-3eq). The spectrum was completely assigned using two-dimensional 1H,1H COSY, TOCSY, and 1H,13C HMQC experim"

Two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis and mass spectroscopy of proteins expressed in immature and mature cultures from embryonic rat cerebral cortex identified stathmin among several differentially expressed proteins, consistent with a possible role in neurogenesis. Stathmin immunohistochemistry in adult rodent brain revealed prominent expression in neuroproliferative zones and neuronal migration pathways, a pattern that resembles the expression of doublecortin, which is implicated in neuronal migration. Stathmin immunoreactivity was also associated with neurons undergoing ectopic chain migration into the ischemic striatum and cerebral cortex following focal cerebral ischemia. Reducing the expression of stathmin or doublecortin with an antisense oligonucleotide inhibited the migration of new neurons from the subventricular zone to the olfactory bulb via the rostral migratory stream. These results suggest a role for stathmin in the migration of newborn neurons in the adult brain."

In adults, melatonin is thought to synchronize other circadian rhythms and regulate seasonal rhythms in photoperiodic animals by acting on specific G-protein coupled receptors. The role of melatonin in development is unknown, even though melatonin receptors appear to be more highly expressed in developing embryos and neonates than in adults. In this study on zebrafish embryos, we describe a role for melatonin in increasing cell proliferation and accelerating development. We propose that melatonin has a role in extending the safe limit of proliferation rate at night to allow more rapid development when potentially damaging ultraviolet light is absent."
https://openalex.org/W2051716255,"In late mitosis and G1, a complex of the essential initiation proteins Mcm2–7 are assembled onto replication origins to 'license' them for initiation. At other times licensing is inhibited by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and geminin, thus ensuring that origins fire only once per cell cycle. Here we show that, paradoxically, CDKs are also required to inactivate geminin and activate the licensing system. On exit from metaphase in Xenopus laevis egg extracts, CDK-dependent activation of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) results in the transient polyubiquitination of geminin. This ubiquitination triggers geminin inactivation without requiring ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, and is essential for replication origins to become licensed. This reveals an unexpected role for CDKs and ubiquitination in activating chromosomal DNAreplication."

Thermal stress was delivered over a range of temperatures (42-68 degrees C) for 5 s to 20 min and luciferase activity was measured in live cells using a cooled CCD camera as a measure of reporter gene transcription. Reporter gene expression was assessed every 2 h for 10 h, and at 24 h post-stress. Expression patterns were validated for selected temperatures. A transition zone where cells lose the ability to produce light and beyond which >50% of cells die was observed to occur within a narrow (2.5 degrees C) temperature window. Although luc and hsp70 mRNA levels in this transition zone were high, there were reduced levels of Luc and Hsp70 protein and ATP levels. Cells treated at these temperatures recovered the ability to produce light in response to a secondary stress at 30 h. This Hsp70-luc reporter gene construct may be useful for defining zones of physiologic responses and assessing collateral thermal damage generated during treatment of biological tissue with lasers and other sources of heat."
https://openalex.org/W1966744074,"Thiamine triphosphate (ThTP) is present in low amounts in most organisms from bacteria to humans, but its biological role remains unknown. Escherichia coli grown aerobically in LB medium contain no detectable amounts of ThTP, but when they are transferred to M9 minimal medium with a substrate such as glucose or pyruvate, there is a rapid but transient accumulation of relatively high amounts of ThTP (about 20% of total thiamine). If a mixture of amino acids is present in addition to glucose, ThTP accumulation is impaired, suggesting that the latter may occur in response to amino acid starvation. To test the importance of ThTP for bacterial growth, we used an E. coli strain overexpressing a specific human recombinant thiamine triphosphatase as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein (GST-ThTPase). Those bacteria were unable to accumulate measurable amounts of ThTP. On minimal medium supplemented with glucose, pyruvate, or acetate, they exhibited an intermediate plateau in cell growth compared with control bacteria expressing GST alone or a GST fusion protein unrelated to thiamine metabolism. These results suggest that the early accumulation of ThTP initiates a reaction cascade involved in the adaptation of bacteria to stringent conditions such as amino acid starvation.

Thiamine triphosphate (ThTP), 1The abbreviations used are: ThTP, thiamine triphosphate; ThDP, thiamine diphosphate; ThTPase, thiamine triphosphatase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; polyP, inorganic polyphosphate; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. 1The abbreviations used are: ThTP, thiamine triphosphate; ThDP, thiamine diphosphate; ThTPase, thiamine triphosphatase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; polyP, inorganic polyphosphate; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. the triphosphorylated derivative of vitamin B1, is a minor component of most cells (generally 0.1–1% of total thiamine). Yet it has been found in most organisms from prokaryotes to mammals (1Makarchikov A.F. Lakaye B. Gulyai I.E. Czerniecki J. Coumans B. Wins P. Grisar T. Bettendorff L. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1477-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In contrast to the well known coenzyme role of thiamine diphosphate (ThDP), the biological role of ThTP has remained elusive so far. Recent findings, however, suggest that ThTP phosphorylates certain proteins, and this might be part of a new cellular signaling pathway. The most significant finding (2Nghiêm H.O. Bettendorff L. Changeux J.P. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 543-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) was that, in Torpedo marmorata electric organ, ThTP specifically phosphorylates rapsyn, a protein essential for the clustering of acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction (3Gautam M. Noakes P.G. Mudd J. Nichol M. Chu G.C. Sanes J.R. Merlie J.P. Nature. 1995; 377: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ThTP phosphorylated histidyl residues on rapsyn. Histidyl phosphorylation is a major regulatory event in prokaryotes (4West A.H. Stock A.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 369-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar) but is less well established in animals (5Besant P.G. Tan E. Attwood P.V. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the latter case the rule is phosphorylation on serine, threonine, and tyrosine with ATP as the phosphate donor. In primitive microorganisms, however, there are apparently more variations on this theme, and proteins may be phosphorylated by donors others than ATP; for instance, phosphoenolpyruvate is the phosphate donor for the phosphoenolpyruvate-sugar phosphate transferase of Escherichia coli (6Siebold C. Flukiger K. Beutler R. Erni B. FEBS Lett. 2001; 504: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It has also been reported (7Lukat G.S. McCleary W.R. Stock A.M. Stock J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 718-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) that CheY, the response regulator that controls motility in chemotaxis, can be autophosphorylated by low molecular weight metabolites such as acetyl phosphate and carbamoyl phosphate. It is, thus, tempting to speculate that protein phosphorylation by ThTP is also an ancient process and that cell signaling mechanisms involving ThTP may be more important in microorganisms than, for instance, in mammals. This prompted us to investigate ThTP biosynthesis in bacteria. As we have recently reported, E. coli grown aerobically in a LB medium under optimal conditions contain no detectable amounts of ThTP (1Makarchikov A.F. Lakaye B. Gulyai I.E. Czerniecki J. Coumans B. Wins P. Grisar T. Bettendorff L. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1477-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, measurable amounts appeared when the bacteria were switched from aerobic to anaerobic conditions. It was, thus, interesting to investigate in more detail the relationship between ThTP biosynthesis and adaptation of E. coli to changing metabolic conditions and growth. Here we show that when bacteria are transferred from LB medium to a minimal medium containing glucose or pyruvate but no amino acids, ThTP levels rapidly and transiently increase (up to 20% of total thiamine). Furthermore, bacteria rendered ThTP-deficient by overexpression of a specific mammalian ThTPase displayed an intermediate plateau in growth rate under the conditions that normally lead to ThTP synthesis. The results suggest that ThTP synthesis is a signal facilitating the adaptation of bacteria to stringent conditions such as amino acid starvation, possibly through protein phosphorylation. Growth and Processing of Bacteria—The E. coli strains used were either MG1655 (wild-type K-12 strain), CF5802 (Δppk-ppx::km) (8Kuroda A. Murphy H. Cashel M. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21240-21243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), or BL21 (Amersham Biosciences). BL21 were transformed with pGEX-5X-1 encoding either glutathione S-transferase (GST), the GST-ThTPase fusion protein (9Lakaye B. Makarchikov A.F. Fernandes Antunes A. Zorzi W. Coumans B. De Pauw E. Wins P. Grisar T. Bettendorff L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13771-13777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), or the GST-EFHC1 fusion protein (see next paragraph). The bacteria were grown overnight (37 °C, 250 rpm) in 50–100 ml of Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (Tryptone, 10 g/liter; yeast extract, 5 g/liter; NaCl, 10 g/liter, at pH 7.0). Then the bacteria were centrifuged (5 min; 10,000 × g) and suspended in the initial volume of fresh LB medium or M9 minimal medium (Na2HPO4, 6 g/liter; KH2PO4, 3 g/liter; NaCl, 0.5 g/liter; NH4Cl, 1 g/liter; CaCl2, 3 mg/liter; MgSO4, 1 mm, pH 7.0) containing various metabolic substrates. If not otherwise stated, the bacteria were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with shaking (250 rpm). For transformed bacteria, ampicillin (200 μg/ml) was present in the culture medium at all stages. After incubation, the bacteria were sedimented as above, the pellets were suspended in 12% trichloroacetic acid, the precipitated proteins were spun down (15 min, 10,000 × g), and the pellet was dissolved in 0.8 n NaOH for protein determination by the method of Peterson (10Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7127) Google Scholar). The supernatant was treated with diethyl ether and analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography for thiamine compounds (11Bettendorff L. Peeters M. Jouan C. Wins P. Schoffeniels E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and ATP (12Hill M. Dupaix A. Volfin P. Kurkdian A. Arrio B. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 132-141Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The authenticity of ThTP synthesized was checked by purification on an AG-50W-X8 (H+ form, Bio-Rad) cation exchange resin and subsequent hydrolysis by purified bovine ThTPase as previously described (1Makarchikov A.F.

Construction of GST-EFHC-1—EFHC1 (GenBank™ accession number BC020210) codes for a eukaryotic protein with a single EF-hand domain.

The PCR fragment was first cloned into pCR4 using the zero blunt TOPO PCR cloning kit (Invitrogen). The fragment was isolated by XhoI and EcoRI digestion and inserted into the GST expression plasmid pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Biosciences). Expression of the full-length protein was checked after IPTG induction by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining. ThTP Synthesis in E. coli Depends on the Metabolic Status—We have previously shown that when E. coli BL21 bacteria were grown under optimal conditions in LB medium (presence of oxygen and vigorous stirring), ThTP levels were virtually undetectable (1Makarchikov A.F. Lakaye B. Gulyai I.E. Czerniecki J. Coumans B. Wins P. Grisar T. Bettendorff L. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1477-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, when the bacteria were grown in the absence of oxygen, ThTP could be detected. On the other hand, in the only other report on the presence of ThTP in E. coli, the bacteria were grown in LB medium supplemented with glucose (13Nishimune T. Hayashi R. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. (Tokyo). 1987; 33: 113-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This suggested that a relationship exists between glycolysis and ThTP synthesis. LB broth is an undefined complex medium mainly composed of amino acids (Tryptone, a pancreatic digest of casein), yeast extract, and NaCl, and we therefore switched to the minimal medium M9 supplemented with various carbon sources (10 mm). ThTP and ATP were determined after 30 min in the defined minimal medium M9 under aeration (Table I). No significant amount of ThTP could be detected in the absence of a carbon source, although the bacteria still contained appreciable amounts of ATP. Glucose, fructose, gluconate, pyruvate, and acetate induced an important increase in intracellular ThTP levels. ThTP was identified after purification and hydrolysis by a specific ThTPase as previously described (1Makarchikov A.F. Lakaye B. Gulyai I.E. Czerniecki J. Coumans B. Wins P. Grisar T. Bettendorff L. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1477-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A smaller amount of ThTP was observed in the presence of glycerol, oxoglutarate, and succinate. Other Krebs cycle intermediates such as citrate, fumarate, oxaloacetate, and malate were completely ineffective, although especially the latter two significantly raised bacterial ATP content. These results suggest that ThTP accumulation is not directly related to the cellular ATP concentration but that the important factor is the nature of the carbon source. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that acetate is a good inducer of ThTP accumulation, although the ATP content remains low.Table IEffect of carbon source on ThTP and ATP contents of E. coli transferred to minimal M9Carbon sourceThTPATPpmol/mg of proteinnmol/mg of proteinNo substrate (16)ND1.3 ± 0.5Glucose (12)60 ± 213.2 ± 1.6ap < 0.01.Fructose (3)50 ± 63.4 ± 0.1Gluconate (6)50 ± 72.7 ± 0.8bp < 0.05.Pyruvate (28)90 ± 392.5 ± 0.7ap < 0.01.Acetate (3)50 ± 90.4 ± 0.1Glycerol (3)13 ± 10.55 ± 0.14Citrate (3)ND1.7 ± 0.2Oxoglutarate (3)17 ± 11.2 ± 0.1Glutamate (5)ND0.79 ± 0.01Succinate (7)19 ± 121.4 ± 0.7Fumarate (3)ND2.9 ± 0.1Malate (6)ND3.8 ± 1.1bp < 0.05.Oxaloacetate (3)ND4.1 ± 0.2bp < 0.05.a p < 0.01.b p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab The previous results suggest that ThTP accumulation is dependent on the metabolic status of the bacteria. Glucose, fructose, gluconate, and pyruvate directly feed into the glycolytic pathway, yielding acetyl-CoA. In our experiments, glucose and pyruvate were as effective in raising ThTP concentrations in the presence and the absence of oxygen (not shown). In E. coli, pyruvate will yield acetyl-CoA even in the absence of oxygen, due to the existence of a pyruvate-formate lyase (14Peng L. Shimizu K. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2003; 61: 163-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Acetyl-CoA can then be processed to acetyl phosphate and acetate with synthesis of ATP. Thus, oxidative metabolism does not appear to be required for ThTP accumulation. This is in agreement with the observation that in LB medium moderate ThTP levels were observed under anaerobic conditions (1Makarchikov A.F. Lakaye B. Gulyai I.E. Czerniecki J. Coumans B. Wins P. Grisar T. Bettendorff L. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1477-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).Bacteria fed on acetate accumulate ThTP, and acetate can only be metabolized to acetyl-CoA that is further metabolized via the glyoxylate shunt and the tricarboxylic cycle (15Oh M.K. Rohlin L. Kao K.C. Liao J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13175-13183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Krebs cycle intermediates will not rapidly yield high amounts of acetyl-CoA, and they do not induce the accumulation of a significant amount of ThTP, with two notable exceptions, oxoglutarate and succinate. It may be significant that both compounds are able in one step to yield another thioester, succinyl-CoA, the former via oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and the latter via succinyl-CoA synthetase. Thus, all our results suggest a link between thioesters and ThTP levels. ThTP Accumulation Is Initiated in Minimal Medium within Minutes after the Addition of a Suitable Substrate—As shown in Fig. 1, ThTP was detected already 5 min after the addition of glucose or pyruvate (10 mm) to the minimal M9 medium. The maximum (about 200–250 pmol·mg–1) was reached after 40–60 min, and ThTP levels started to decrease after 1 h. In the presence of the same concentration of glutamate, the appearance of ThTP was strongly delayed, and the maximum amount obtained remained much lower than in the presence of glucose or pyruvate. In the presence of malate no significant amount of ThTP was observed. Interestingly, when pyruvate was added to the LB medium, a maximum ThTP content of about 30–35 pmol·mg–1 was reached after 90 min (not shown). This value is 5–10 times lower than the one obtained in M9 medium. No significant accumulation was observed in the presence of glucose in LB medium. Under these conditions the bacteria remained in a stationary phase, and no significant bacterial growth was observed within the 3-h incubation period. This is probably due to the very high bacterial density under these conditions (A600 > 2). After 60 min in M9 medium containing glucose, the ThTP content reached about 250 pmol·mg–1, i.e. 20% percent of total thiamine (Fig. 2). The intracellular concentration was estimated to be about 20 μm at the maximum of the peak. During the same period ThDP content decreased from 1208 ± 36 to 978 ± 73 pmol/mg of protein (n = 8; Student's t test: p = 0.03), suggesting that ThTP is synthesized from an intracellular ThDP pool. ThTP Levels Are Linked to Amino Acid Starvation—Our results show that ThTP accumulation is dependent on two parameters that act synergistically, (i) the presence of the suitable carbon source and (ii) transfer to a minimal medium, lacking amino acids but also all vitamins. To test whether the absence of amino acids is responsible for the accumulation of ThTP induced by glucose, the bacteria were grown in M9 medium in which various concentrations of amino acids or Tryptone were added (Fig. 3). It can be seen that the presence of the 20 amino acids at 0.5 mm each was enough to nearly completely antagonize the effect of glucose. To check if one or several particular amino acids were responsible for the effect observed in Fig. 3, all 20 amino acids occurring in proteins were tested separately (Fig. 4). At 10 mm, many amino acids caused a small (10–20%) reduction of glucose-induced ThTP accumulation compared with the control (no amino acid present). Some were more effective; arginine, glutamate, tryptophan, and cysteine caused a 50–70% decrease in ThTP levels. These results suggest that in E. coli ThTP accumulation does not occur in response to the absence of one particular amino acid but, rather, in response to general amino acid starvation.Fig. 4Effect of amino acids on the accumulation of ThTP in M9 medium in the presence of 10 mm glucose. The bacteria were incubated for 30 min in M9 medium supplemented with 10 mm glucose either in the absence (No AA) or in the presence of the indicated amino acid (10 mm). Because of low solubility, tyrosine was used at 5 mm. No glucose was present in the last column, and ThTP was undetectable. For the Kruskal-Wallis test, p < 0.0001. Dunn's multiple comparisons test was used for comparison with control (***, p < 0.001; **, p < 0.01; *, p < 0.05). The results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. for 2–8 experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is well known that inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) plays a role in the adaptation of the bacteria transferred from a rich to a minimal medium as it stimulates endogenous protein degradation to increase the availability of amino acids (16Kuroda A. Tanaka S. Ikeda T. Kato J. Takiguchi N. Ohtake H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14264-14269Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). PolyP promotes the degradation of ribosomal proteins by the Lon protease (17Kuroda A. Nomura K. Ohtomo R. Kato J. Ikeda T. Takiguchi N. Ohtake H. Kornberg A. Science. 2001; 293: 705-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). However, the bacterial strain BL21 used here lacks protease Lon (that is the reason why this strain is used to increase the efficiency of protein expression). If ThTP is involved in the response to amino acid starvation in addition to polyP, it seemed important to check whether wild-type K-12 bacteria (MG1655) and also CF5802 bacteria, lacking polyP kinase and exopolyphosphatase, still produce ThTP when fed on pyruvate and glucose in minimal medium. The wild-type strain produced the same amount of ThTP as the BL21 strain, but ThTP accumulation was twice as high in the CF5802 strain compared with the previous strains (not shown). This could be because of the absence of exopolyphosphatase, which might be able to hydrolyze ThTP. Taken together, these data suggest that neither polyP nor polyP kinase is implicated in ThTP accumulation. In the Absence of Amino Acids, Bacteria Lacking ThTP Show an Intermediate Plateau in Growth Rate—The data presented above show that a transient accumulation of ThTP occurs in response to the transfer of bacteria from LB to M9 medium (containing an appropriate carbon source but no amino acids), and it is, thus, possible that ThTP may play a role in this adaptation. To test this hypothesis we compared the growth rate of E. coli expressing a highly specific ThTPase as a GST fusion protein (GST-ThTPase (9Lakaye B. Makarchikov A.F. Fernandes Antunes A. Zorzi W. Coumans B. De Pauw E. Wins P. Grisar T. Bettendorff L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13771-13777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)) with bacteria expressing GST alone. In M9 medium containing 10 mm pyruvate, GST bacteria rapidly entered an exponential growth phase and reached a plateau after about 9 h (Fig. 5A). In GST-ThTPase bacteria an “intermediate plateau” appeared after 5 h. It lasted about 5–6 h, before exponential growth resumed. The ThTP content was determined in parallel in GST and GST-ThTPase bacteria (Fig. 5B). In GST bacteria, there was an important but transient accumulation of ThTP, reaching a maximum of nearly 400 pmol per mg of protein after 1 h. In contrast, when GST-ThTPase was expressed instead of GST, no significant amount of ThTP was detected (Fig. 5B). It could be argued that GST-ThTPase overexpression induces a slow down in cell growth independently of ThTP hydrolysis. Indeed, because the molecular weight of the fusion protein (50 kDa) is twice higher than that of GST (25 kDa), its synthesis should require more energy. Therefore, we tested the effect of a larger fusion protein, GST-EFHC1 (100 kDa), on bacterial growth. EFHC1, under investigation in our laboratory, is a eukaryotic protein containing one EF-hand. In the presence of this fusion protein, which is irrelevant to thiamine metabolism and devoid of ThTPase activity, bacteria grew at the same rate as GST bacteria (not shown). When bacteria were grown in M9 medium supplemented with pyruvate in the absence of IPTG, no differences in the growth rate between GST and GST-ThTPase bacteria were observed (Fig. 5C). Under these conditions GST-ThTPase bacteria contain about half the amount of ThTP present in the GST bacteria (not shown). Indeed our previous results have shown that in the absence of IPTG ThTPase activity is about 10% of the activity in the presence of IPTG (9Lakaye B. Makarchikov A.F. Fernandes Antunes A. Zorzi W. Coumans B. De Pauw E. Wins P. Grisar T. Bettendorff L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13771-13777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This activity, although higher than endogenous ThTPase activity in E. coli, is not sufficient to hydrolyze all ThTP and, thus, impair bacterial growth. It could also be argued that the intermediate plateau observed in GST-ThTPase bacteria (Fig. 5A) is due to some kind of toxicity of ThTPase moiety independent of ThTP hydrolysis. Although several studies showed the high specificity of the 25-kDa ThTPase for ThTP, a significant hydrolysis of ATP in GST-ThTPase bacteria cannot be excluded. Determination of ATP in GST- and GST-ThTPase-expressing bacteria showed no significant differences (not shown). Moreover, when grown in LB medium supplemented with IPTG (Fig. 5D), both GST and GST-ThTPase bacteria rapidly entered the exponential growth phase and reached a stationary phase after about 3 h. In this medium, rich in amino acids, the expression of GST-ThTPase did not cause the appearance of an intermediate plateau. As expected, no ThTP was detected in either of the two cultures (not shown). These results strongly suggest that the intermediate plateau observed in GST-ThTPase bacteria in the absence of amino acids (Fig. 5A) is really due to ThTP depletion. After induction by IPTG, we consistently observed a decrease in the absorbance of the medium containing GST bacteria after a plateau was reached in minimal (Fig. 5A) as well as in LB (Fig. 5D) medium. After induction the amount of intracellular GST reached 10% of total protein, significantly more than GST-ThTPase (not shown). Protein overexpression is a significant metabolic burden for bacteria (18Jones K.L. Kim S.W. Keasling J.D. Metab. Eng. 2000; 2: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and a slow-down of growth after induction of GST is, therefore, not surprising. In the experiment shown in Fig. 5A, the differences in growth rate between GST- and GST-ThTPase-expressing bacteria were studied in the presence of pyruvate as the carbon source. We also observed those differences using two other substrates inducing ThTP accumulation, i.e. glucose and acetate (Fig. 6). As with pyruvate, an intermediate plateau was observed with bacteria depleted in ThTP but not in the absence of IPTG. In glucose, the growth curves diverged already after 2.5 h (compared with 4.5 in pyruvate), whereas in acetate, the curves diverged only after 6 h. In each case, the growth curves started to diverge when the absorbance doubled, i.e. after approximately one division. In glucose, GST-ThTPase bacteria recovered after the intermediate plateau phase, and after 4 h the cell density was the same for both strains. In contrast, GST-ThTPase bacteria grown in acetate showed no recovery of growth after 24 h. In this case, ThTP depletion appears to induce a long-term impairment of growth rather than an intermediate plateau. This inability to recover may be related to the fact that growth in acetate is considerably slower than in glucose. Acetate is indeed a poor energetic substrate (as shown in Table I, intracellular ATP levels are lower in acetate than with most other carbon sources). Two main findings emerge from the present study, (i) intracellular ThTP levels depend on the nature of the organic carbon source, and (ii) ThTP plays a role in the fast adaptation of bacteria to amino acid starvation. We have defined for the first time the experimental conditions under which a microorganism, i.e. E. coli, will accumulate ThTP in appreciable amounts and in a reproducible way. These conditions are (i) switching from rich LB medium to a minimal medium devoid of amino acids and (ii) the presence of an appropriate carbon source such as glucose or pyruvate. Under these conditions there is a fast and important increase in ThTP levels (up to 20% of total thiamine, corresponding to an intracellular concentration of at least 20 μm). The phenomenon is transient and after 1–3 h, the cellular ThTP content markedly decreases. This rapid decrease can only be explained by hydrolysis. ThTPases have indeed been shown to exist in bacteria (13Nishimune T. Hayashi R. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. (Tokyo). 1987; 33: 113-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), but they seem to be unrelated to the mammalian 25-kDa ThTPase. An important observation is that ThTP accumulation is impaired when the minimal medium, containing glucose, is supplemented with amino acids (i.e. a mixture of the 20 amino acids at 0.5 mm each). Taken together, those data support the idea that the appearance of ThTP is a signal involved in the adaptation of the bacteria to stringent conditions, such as amino acid starvation. It should be emphasized that ThTP levels reached were similar (about 300 pmol/mg of protein) whether the bacteria were in the stationary (Fig. 1) or the exponential (Fig. 5A) growth phase. Thus, the important factor for ThTP accumulation in minimal medium is not the physiological state of the culture but the nature of the carbon source. The second finding points more directly to the physiological role of ThTP, as we have shown that E. coli rendered ThTP-deficient by overexpression of a specific ThTPase exhibit an intermediate plateau of growth when they are switched to the minimal medium under conditions that would normally lead to ThTP accumulation. This does not mean that ThTP is always required for optimal growth, because we have seen that bacteria grown in optimal LB medium contain no ThTP. Rather, ThTP appears to be required temporarily when the bacteria have to adapt to a medium that contains no amino acids. ThTP accumulation may be only an early step in a cascade of adaptive biochemical processes. Although the present study appears as a useful basis for understanding the biological role of ThTP in bacteria, it leaves a number of important questions unanswered. First, we know very little about the enzymatic mechanism of ThTP synthesis and about the biochemical events that regulate ThTP concentrations in the cell. Yet some indications can be drawn from our results. We have seen that when the bacteria accumulate a certain amount of ThTP they loose an equimolar amount of ThDP, suggesting that the diphosphate is the precursor. A phosphate donor should thus be required, and the most obvious candidate is ATP. However, the data of Table I show only a poor correlation between the cellular ATP content and the amount of ThTP appearing in the cells. It is particularly noteworthy that malate and oxaloacetate, which increase cellular ATP, are completely ineffective in increasing ThTP, whereas acetate, which is a very poor substrate for ATP production, induces an appreciable accumulation of ThTP. Therefore, if we assume that ATP is in fact the direct phosphate donor, some other factor(s) probably controls the rate of synthesis or hydrolysis. As we pointed out, substrates that can be processed to form acetyl-CoA (or succinyl-CoA) raise ThTP levels, whereas oxaloacetate, which reacts with acetyl-CoA to form citrate, is unable to induce ThTP accumulation. It is, thus, tempting to speculate that acetyl-CoA (and possibly other thioesters) is either an activator of ThTP synthesis or an inhibitor of its hydrolysis. Conversely, the presence of amino acids would inhibit ThTP synthesis or stimulate its hydrolysis. A second important and unanswered question is, once ThTP is present, what are its cellular targets? Preliminary experiments have shown that [γ-32P]ThTP phosphorylates a 26-kDa protein in E. coli (not shown). It will be important to identify this protein to find out whether this phosphorylation is biologically relevant. Alternatively, the target may be a receptor protein binding ThTP, as is observed for cAMP and transcription factors in bacteria (19Harman J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1547: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Even mechanisms involving a riboswitch (20Winkler W. Nahvi A. Breaker R.R. Nature. 2002; 419: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar) may be considered. It is interesting to compare ThTP with another molecule that attracted much interest during recent years, i.e. polyP. Like ThTP, polyP transiently accumulates when bacteria are switched from a rich to a minimal medium (21Ault-Riche D. Fraley C.D. Tzeng C.M. Kornberg A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1841-1847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This accumulation is stimulated by a rapid rise in levels of guanosine pentaphosphate (22Spira B. Silberstein N. Yagil E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4053-4058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which strongly inhibits exopolyphosphatase (8Kuroda A. Murphy H. Cashel M. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21240-21243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). PolyP in turn promotes protein degradation by the Lon protease (17Kuroda A. Nomura K. Ohtomo R. Kato J. Ikeda T. Takiguchi N. Ohtake H. Kornberg A. Science. 2001; 293: 705-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), supplying amino acids needed for growth. Bacteria deficient in polyP kinase and, thus, unable to synthesize polyP exhibit an important lag in growth that is reversed in the presence of amino acids (16Kuroda A. Tanaka S. Ikeda T. Kato J. Takiguchi N. Ohtake H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14264-14269Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In this case, however, the growth lag is observed immediately after starting the experiment, whereas in our experiments there was a delay of 3–5 h between induction of GST-ThTPase and the slow-down of growth corresponding to the intermediate plateau (Figs. 5A and 6, A and C). A possible explanation would be that, even in the complete absence of ThTP, a relatively constant growth rate can be maintained as long as the intracellular concentration of some key intermediate(s) (may be amino acids) is maintained above a certain threshold. Once the intermediates are exhausted, the growth slows down, leading to an intermediate plateau. ThTP would be part of a rescue system stimulating the synthesis of the intermediate(s), thus facilitating bacterial growth. The observation that with three different substrates (glucose, pyruvate, and acetate) the intermediate plateau starts after different time intervals (respectively, 2.5, 4.5, and 6 h) but always approximately after doubling of the cell density would be in favor of the exhaustion of a key intermediate in metabolism. Further work will be required to substantiate this interpretation, but our results indicate at least that ThTP levels in E. coli do not directly control the growth rate. Rather, the initial accumulation of ThTP appears as a transient signal inducing a cascade of secondary biochemical processes, eventually resulting in growth facilitation. Although most of our results were obtained with the BL21 strain deficient in Lon protease, the adaptive mechanism involving ThTP accumulation probably exists in wild-type E. coli as well, as we have shown a similar initial accumulation of ThTP using the K-12 strain. On the other hand, ThTP accumulation requires a suitable carbon source, whereas there is no indication that the nature of the carbon source is important for polyP synthesis. Therefore, no obvious relationship appears to exist between the two responses to amino acid starvation. Even if the two mechanisms are unrelated, we should emphasize some striking similarities between ThTP and polyP. Both compounds are found in most organisms ranging from bacteria to mammals. Both compounds contain high energy phosphoanhydride bonds and are increased in bacteria after a stress such as amino acid starvation. Their role in eukaryotes remains enigmatic, but ThTP may phosphorylate certain proteins (2Nghiêm H.O. Bettendorff L. Changeux J.P. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 543-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), whereas polyP stimulates mammalian protein kinase target of rapamycin, involved in the proliferation of mammary cancer cells (23Wang L. Fraley C.D. Faridi J. Kornberg A. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11249-11254Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1973165991,"Modulation of mRNA stability by regulatory cis-acting AU-rich elements (AREs) and ARE-binding proteins is an important posttranscriptional mechanism of gene expression control. We previously demonstrated that the 3′-untranslated region of BCL-2 mRNA contains an ARE that accounts for rapid BCL-2 down-regulation in response to apoptotic stimuli. We also demonstrated that the BCL-2 ARE core interacts with a number of ARE-binding proteins, one of which is AU-rich factor 1/heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D, known for its interaction with mRNA elements of others genes. In an attempt to search for other BCL-2 mRNA-binding proteins, we used the yeast RNA three-hybrid system assay and identified a novel human protein that interacts with BCL-2 ARE. We refer to it as TINO. The predicted protein sequence of TINO reveals two amino-terminal heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K homology motifs for nucleic acid binding and a carboxyl-terminal RING domain, endowed with a putative E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity. In addition the novel protein is evolutionarily conserved; the two following orthologous proteins have been identified with protein-protein BLAST: posterior end mark-3 (PEM-3) of Ciona savignyi and muscle excess protein-3 (MEX-3) of Caenorhabditis elegans. Upon binding, TINO destabilizes a chimeric reporter construct containing the BCL-2 ARE sequence, revealing a negative regulatory action on BCL-2 gene expression at the posttranscriptional level.

The fate of mRNAs has recently emerged as an important point of regulation of gene expression. mRNA localization and stability and protein translation are closely controlled. In general, these mechanisms are based on the cooperation between cis- and trans-acting elements. Interactions among regulatory factors constitute the messenger ribonucleoprotein, an integrated dynamic platform for RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions acting on the cellular fate of each bound mRNA (1Mitchell P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). It is now clear that this fate is determined within the nucleus where pre-mRNAs are “coated” by heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear proteins (hnRNPs). 1The abbreviations used are: hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; THS, three-hybrid system; ARE, AU-rich element; KH, hnRNP K homology; AUF1, AU-rich factor 1; IST, interacting sequence tag; PEM-3, posterior end mark-3; MEX-3, muscle excess protein-3; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RT, reverse transcription; UTR, untranslated region; ORF, open reading frame; RPE, retinal pigment epithelial; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; E3, ubiquitin-protein ligase; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. 1The abbreviations used are: hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; THS, three-hybrid system; ARE, AU-rich element; KH, hnRNP K homology; AUF1, AU-rich factor 1; IST, interacting sequence tag; PEM-3, posterior end mark-3; MEX-3, muscle excess protein-3; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RT, reverse transcription; UTR, untranslated region; ORF, open reading frame; RPE, retinal pigment epithelial; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; E3, ubiquitin-protein ligase; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. Some of them are able to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (nucleocytoplasmic shuttling): in this manner nuclear and cytoplasmic events of mRNA metabolism are interconnected (2Shyu A.B. Wilkinson M.F. Cell. 2000; 102: 135-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Messenger ribonucleoprotein particle assembly is so integral to gene expression control that it is functionally conceptualized as a posttranscriptional “operon” (3Keene J.D. Tenenbaum S.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1161-1167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 4Tenenbaum S.A. Carson C.C. Lager P.J. Keene J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14085-14090Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). One of the more investigated classes of cis-acting factors are the AU-rich elements (ARE). AREs are involved in messenger ribonucleoprotein assembly, and they are responsible for mRNA half-life control (5Xu N. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4611-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). AREs were initially found in the 3′-UTR of the mRNAs of early response genes such as c-FOS, c-MYC, and c-JUN, which code for powerful transcriptional activators, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-2, interleukin-3, and interleukin-6, which code for growth factors and cytokines. These mRNAs are finely regulated in response to external stimuli and are subject to rapid turnover (6Stoecklin G. Stoeckle P. Lu M. Muehlemann O. Moroni C. RNA. 2001; 7: 1578-1588PubMed Google Scholar, 7Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8471-8482Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). AREs are well recognizable as one or more AUUUA motifs in 3′-UTRs of mRNAs often linked in a typical nonameric unit, UUAUUUA(U/A)(U/A). A more recent ARE classification is reported in the ARED data base (8Bakheet T. Frevel M. Williams B.R. Greer W. Khabar K.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) where more than 800 ARE-harboring mRNAs are classified on the basis of the number of AUUUA motifs they possess. AREs bind to a growing number of AU-rich element-binding proteins. Among these proteins are AUF1/hnRNP D; ELAV-like (embryonic lethal abnormal vision); and hnRNP A1, A2, and C proteins belonging to the wide family of hnRNPs; these proteins contain the RNA recognition motif as their RNA-interacting domain (9Ma W.J. Cheng S. Campbell C. Wright A. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8144-8151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 10Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W.

Chem. 1993; 268: 8881-8887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other classes of RNA-binding proteins participating in ARE decay have been recently identified. Tristetraprolin is the prototype of ARE-binding proteins that possess a characteristic CCCH zinc finger domain (13Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Another example is the hnRNP K homology (KH)-type splicing regulatory protein, a KH-type protein first identified as a splicing factor (14Min H. Turck C.W. Nikolic J.M. Black D.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1023-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Recently this protein was also implicated together with AUF1/hnRNP D and tristetraprolin proteins in the exosome recruitment on ARE mRNAs (15Chen C.Y. Gherzi R. Ong S.E. Chan E.L. Raijmakers R. Pruijn G.J. Stoecklin G. Moroni C. Mann M. Karin M. Cell. 2001; 107: 451-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Considering the complexity of proteins that can bind a particular cis-acting element, we have chosen the yeast RNA THS technique to identify other BCL-2 ARE-binding proteins by a library screening assay. The RNA THS allowed us to clone two cDNAs: p40AUF1 isoform cDNA and a novel human gene on which we have focused in this work. Here we report its isolation and characterization. We refer to this protein as pTINO. The novel protein, prevalently localized in the nuclear-perinuclear compartments of the cell, is a novel regulator of BCL-2 gene expression acting at the posttranscriptional level. RNA Three-hybrid Library Screening Assay—The yeast strain L40-coat (Mata, ura3–52, leu2–3, 112, his3–200, trp1-1, ade2, LYS2::(LexA-op)-HIS3, LexA-MS2coat (TRP1)) and plasmids pIIIA/MS2-1, pIIIA/MS2-2, and pIIIA/IRE-MS2 were gifts from Dr. M. Wickens (University of Wisconsin). The RNA expression vector that we chose for hybrid RNA transcription was pIIIA/MS2-1. The human BCL-2 ARE cDNA, cloned into the SmaI site of the pIIIA/MS2-1, spans nucleotides 944–1050 of the human BCL-2 mRNA (GenBank™ accession number M14745). The resulting plasmid, pIIIA/MS2-B2ARE, was constructed as described previously (16Lapucci A. Donnini M. Papucci L. Witort E. Tempestini A. Bevilacqua A. Nicolin A. Brewer G. Schiavone N. Capaccioli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16139-16146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A derivative of yeast L40-coat containing pIIIA/MS2-B2ARE was transformed with a human placenta MATCH-MAKER cDNA library (no. HL4025AH, Clontech). Double transformants were plated on synthetic medium lacking leucine and histidine. 3 mm 3-aminotriazole (Sigma) was used to select for relatively high levels of HIS3 reporter gene activation. About 1.2 × 107 yeast transformants were screened. After a week, 1,040 white colonies were picked up and assayed according to the described procedures for RNA THS (17Bernstein D.S. Buter N. Stumpf C. Wickens M. Methods. 2002; 26: 123-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The RNA-dependent false-positive clones were identified at the end of the screening by mating assay using the yeast R40-coat derivative strain (Matα, ura3–52, leu2–3, 112, his3–200, trp1-1, ade2, LYS2::(LexA-op)-HIS3, LexA-MS2coat (TRP1)) containing the unrelated RNA 5′IRE-MS23′; the deletion mutant version of BCL-2 ARE, 5′MS2-B2ΔARE3′, whose nonameric motif was deleted; and as a positive control the 5′MS2-B2ARE3′. The B2ΔARE cDNA sequence was deleted of the UUAUUUAU motif, ranging from nucleotides 1005 to 1012 of the human BCL-2 mRNA, and cloned in the SmaI site of the pIIIA/MS2-1, giving rise to pIIIA/MS2-B2ΔARE vector. RNA Three-hybrid System Mapping Assays—14 different and partially overlapping segments of BCL-2 ARE were cloned into the XmaI and SphI sites of the pIIIA/MS2-2. The first 11 segments (from B2ARE1 to B2ARE11) were PCR-amplified using Pfu DNA Polymerase (Stratagene) and pIIIA/MS2-B2ARE plasmid as template or, only for the segment named B2ΔARE, the pIIIA/MS2-B2ΔARE. The primers used were: fFW1, 5′-TCCcccgggTCAGCTATTTACTGCCA-3′; fFW2, 5′-TCCcccgggGCCAAAGGGAAATATCA-3′; fFW3, 5′-TCCcccgggATTTGTTACATTATTAAG-3′; fFW4, 5′-TCCcccgggATTTATTTATTTAAGACAG-3′; fFW5, 5′-TCCcccgggATTTAAGACAGTCCCATC-3′; fRV1, 5′-ACCTgcatgcTAAATGATATTTCCCTT-3′; fRV2, 5′-ACCTgcatgcTAATAATGTAACAAATAA-3′; fRV3, 5′-ACCTgcatgcTCTTAAATAAATAAATCT; fRV4, 5′-ACCTgcatgcCAAAGACAGGAGTTTTGA-3′; and fRV5, 5′-ACCTgcatgcGATTTCCAAAGACAGGAG-3′. The B2ARE1 segment was PCR-amplified with fFW1 and fRV2, B2ARE2 with fFW2 and fRV3, B2ARE3 with fFW3 and fRV4, and B2ARE4 with fFW4 and fRV5. The B2ARE5 segment was PCR-amplified with fFW1 and fRV1 primers, B2ARE6 with fFW2 and fRV2, B2ARE7 with fFW3 and fRV3, B2ARE8 with fFW4 and fRV4, and B2ARE9 with fFW5 and fRV5. B2ARE and B2ΔARE were amplified with fFW1 and fRV5. All 11 B2AREs were checked for their transcription in yeast baits using Northern analysis (data not shown). B2ARE10, B2ARE11, and B2ARE12 segments were synthesized as complementary oligonucleotides with protruding ends forming XmaI and SphI sites. The L40-coat derivative clones, containing different combinations of hybrid RNAs and activation domain-fused proteins, were assayed for HIS3 and lacZ gene activation. Plasmids—The 107-bp segment of human BCL-2 mRNA located in the 3′-UTR from nucleotides 944–1050 (GenBank™ accession number M14745, Ref. 16Lapucci A. Donnini M. Papucci L. Witort E. Tempestini A.

The resulting plasmid was pTRE2pur-B2ARE. pTRE2pur vector harboring the predicted ORF of TINO, named pTRE2pur/TINO, was produced as follows. A 1,485-nucleotide-long fragment was PCR-amplified from the pACT2 vector containing the human TINO cDNA with 5′-GGATCCGCCACCATGACCGAGTGCGTC-3′ forward and 5′-GATATCTCAATACTGTCGTTGAAGGGC-3′ reverse primers and cloned into the BamHI and EcoRV sites of the pTRE2pur. pQE-TriSystem vector (Qiagen) harboring the predicted ORF of TINO, named pQE-TriSystem/TINO, was produced as follows. A 1,485-nucleotide-long fragment was PCR-amplified from the pACT2 vector containing the human TINO cDNA with 5′-CATGCCATGGCAATGACCGAGTGCGTC-3′ forward and 5′-CGCCTCGAGATACTGTCGTTGAAGGGC-3′ reverse primers and cloned into the NcoI and XhoI sites of the pQE-TriSystem. Cell Culture and Transfection—Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) and HeLa cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), and the HeLa Tet-Off cell line was purchased from Clontech. RPE cells were maintained in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Euroclone) and Ham's F-12 medium (Euroclone) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 0.1 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Euroclone) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 0.1 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. HeLa Tet-Off cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Euroclone) supplemented with 10% tetracycline-free fetal calf serum (Clontech), 2 mm glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 μg/ml G418 (Sigma). Recombinant TINO protein was analyzed by Western blot of the protein lysates extracted from HeLa Tet-Off cells transfected with 4 μg of pTRE2pur/TINO (and pTRE2pur as control) or 4 μg of pQE-TriSystem/TINO (and pQE-TriSystem as control) performed in 6-well plates. For RNase protection assay experiments, HeLa Tet-Off cells were transiently transfected in 6-well plates with 50 ng of pQE-TriSystem/TINO or pQE-TriSystem plasmid and 20 ng of pTRE2pur-B2ARE or pTRE2pur as control in the presence of 10 μg of plasmid DNA carrier. SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA Extraction and RT-PCR—Midlog cells were detached from culture cell dishes, and about 1 × 106 cells were recovered for RNA extractions using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen). Total RNA was extracted from RPE, SH-SY5Y, K562, NB4, A431, human umbilical vein endothelial, human embryonic kidney 293, HeLa, and Jurkat T cells. 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using 0.5 μg of random examers (New England Biolabs) and 1 μl of Improm-II™ reverse transcriptase (Promega) following the manufacturer's recommendation. The reverse-transcribed product was amplified in a 50-μl volume containing 25 pmol of gene-specific primers, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 15 mm (NH4)SO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2.5% Me2SO, and 0.7–1 units of DyNAzyme™ EXT™ DNA polymerase (Finnzymes). PCR was performed for 34 cycles with annealing at 59 °C using 5′-GTCAACATGACCGAGTGCG-3′ forward and 5′-GGATGATGGAGAAGTGTTCGG-3′ reverse primers flanking the major intron site within TINO cDNA. Northern Blotting Analysis—For tissue distribution analysis, a premade Northern blot containing ∼2 μg of poly(A) RNA/lane was used (human MTN™ blot, Clontech). Hybridization conditions were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA probe was derived after ApaI restriction enzyme cutting of the novel gene (nucleotides 521–1118 of TINO cDNA). The cDNA fragment was gelpurified and then subjected to the random priming reaction for radioactive labeling using 24 ng of DNA and [α-32P]dATP (3,000Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) with the DECA Prime II kit (Ambion). 5′- and 3′-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (5′- and 3′-RACE)— The Human Placenta FirstChoice™ RACE Ready cDNA kit (Ambion) was used for 5′- and 3′-RACE analysis of TINO transcripts. It provides a mixture of two different types of cDNA population for each type of analysis. The cDNAs serves as templates in nested PCRs using adapter sequence-specific primers (provided with the FirstChoice™ RACE Ready cDNA kit) and gene-specific primers. The sequences of the gene-specific primers used are as follows: 5′GSP1, 5′-ATGTGCGCCTCGATCTCCTC-3′ (nucleotides 485–466 of TINO cDNA), and 5′GSP2, 5′-CTGCTGGATGCGCTTGATGG-3′ (nucleotides 375–356 of TINO cDNA) for 5′-RACE; 3′GSP1, 5′-ATTCGCGTGGAGACGGAGAC-3′ (nucleotides 1411–1430 of TINO cDNA), and 3′GSP2, 5′-GAAGCCGTTTTCTGATTTGACTTTTCTCGCCG-3′ (nucleotides 1627–1658 of TINO cDNA) for 3′-RACE. The DyNAzyme™ EXT™ polymerase (Finnzymes) was used in all nested RNA T4 ligation-mediated RACE PCRs according to the manufacturer's instructions. GENSCAN Analysis—The GENSCAN software is available on the Internet. 2See genes.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html. The predicted additional 5′-exon of TINO gene was amplified using the following forward primers: G1, 5′-ATGCCCAGCTCGCTCGGCCA-3′; G2, 5′-TGGCGCTGGACCAGCTGTCG-3′; and G3, 5′-TGGCGACACGGACGAGGA-3′. The reverse primers were: R1, 5′-GCGTGGCGCGGATGATGGAG-3′ (nucleotides 232–213 of TINO cDNA); and R2, 5′-TCCCAGTGACCGCGAACAC-3′ (nucleotides 439–421 of TINO cDNA). The PCR profile time and temperatures were as follows: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min followed by 35 cycles (94 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 1 min 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min 30 s) with a final elongation step at 72 °C for 5 min. Antibodies and Western Blotting Analysis—Rabbit polyclonal anti-pTINO antibody was raised against three synthetic peptides from pTINO. The peptides were the following: pep1, NH2-CKIKALRAKTNTYIK-COOH (amino acids 24–38); pep2, NH2-CKRIQQRTHTYIVTPGRDKE-COOH (amino acids 121–139); and pep3, NH2-CKTPNQGRRPPTATA-COOH (amino acids 199–212). pep2 and pep9 possess an additional residue (in bold) at the N-terminus in order to facilitate the conjunction with the protein carrier. The peptides were synthesized at the PRIMM s.r.l. (Milan, Italy) synthesis facility using the solidphase peptide synthesis method with Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry and purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The amino-terminal amino acid for each peptide was coupled to the keyhole limpet hemocyanin protein, then the three keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled peptides were injected into two rabbits, and serum was collected after the second injection. The antisera were purified by affinity column chromatography using CNBr-Sepharose resin (Amersham Biosciences) for each purification, aliquoted, and kept at -20 °C until use. For total protein preparation and Western analysis, cells were collected, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (100 μl/well; 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). For Western blotting, 25 μg of total proteins were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE in 1× Tris-glycine-SDS running buffer (ICN Biomedicals Inc.) and transferred with the Trans-blot SD/semidry transfer cell (BioRad) onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol, and 0.1% SDS at 0.330 A for 30 min in a cold room. Membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS-Tween 20 at room temperature for 1 h prior to addition of rabbit polyclonal anti-pTINO antibody (1:1,000) diluted in PBS-Tween 20 overnight at 4 °C or mouse monoclonal anti-His(C-term) antibody (Invitrogen, no. R930-25) (1:5,000) diluted in PBS-Tween 20 with 5% skim milk overnight at 4 °C. After washing, membranes were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature (1:10,000, rabbit, Amersham Biosciences; 1:5,000, goat, Sigma) and washed again prior to detection with ECL Plus reagents on ECL Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Translation—The ORF fragment of TINO gene was PCR-amplified from plasmid pQE-TriSystem/TINO using the following primers: the forward primer 5′-GTTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAAATAATAGTCAACATGACCGAGTGCGT-3′ containing the T7 promoter sequence (underlined) and the reverse primer 5′-CACTTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGGTGCTCGA-3′ containing the nucleotide sequence for the 8-histidine stretch present in the DNA template. The PCR product was incubated with the TnT-coupled transcription-translation reticulocyte lysate (Promega) in the presence of cold methionine according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gel Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assay—Mobility shift assays were performed using a radiolabeled 107-nucleotide-long RNA corresponding to the human BCL-2 mRNA located in the 3′-UTR from nucleotides 944 to 1050 (GenBank™ accession number M14745) as described in Lapucci et al. (16Lapucci A. Donnini M. Papucci L. Witort E. Tempestini A. Bevilacqua A. Nicolin A. Brewer G. Schiavone N. Capaccioli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16139-16146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Increasing volumes of reticulocyte lysate product were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 2 fmol (2 × 104 cpm/fmol) of 32P-labeled BCL-2 ARE riboprobe in the presence of 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm KOAc, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm spermine, 10% glycerol, 5 units of RNasin (Promega), 50 μg of heparin, and 0.2 μg/μl of yeast tRNA (total volume, 20 μl). Samples were electrophoresed in a 6% acrylamide gel (polyacrylamide:bisacrylamide, 60:1), dried, and analyzed using the Cyclone™ Storage Phosphor System (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Intracellular Localization—HeLa cells were seeded at very low density (about 10,000 cells/cm2) and grown on glass coverslips (15 × 15 mm) in 12-well plates. Harvested cells were washed two times with 1 ml of cold PBS and fixed for 20 min in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Following three washes for 2 min each with PBS, the cells were permeabilized with 1 ml of 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature and washed three times for 2 min each in PBS. The following incubations were performed in the dark. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 (Sigma, no. B2883, blue fluorescence) diluted 1:1,000 in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed three times for 5 min at room temperature and incubated with 1 ml of blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were incubated with primary rabbit polyclonal anti-TINO antibody diluted 1:500 in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C and the next day washed three times for 15 min each in washing buffer (0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS). The cells were then incubated with secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Chemicon, no. AP156F, green fluorescence) diluted 1:800 for 60 min at room temperature. Following a final three washes with 1 ml of washing buffer for 5 min each at room temperature, the samples were dried, mounted onto glass slides, and examined with a Nikon fluorescence microscope using a B-2A filter for fluorescein isothiocyanate and UV-2A filter for Hoechst 33258. RNase Protection Assay—HeLa Tet-Off cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/well 1 day prior to transient transfections. Two days posttransfection cells were treated with 2 μg/ml doxycycline (Clontech), and total RNA was collected at various time points and harvested in lysis solution containing guanidine thiocyanate (Ambion). Lysates were passed through shredder columns (Qiagen) and stored frozen at -20 °C. The plasmids pGAPM, containing a portion of the human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase coding region (18Legnado C.A. Brown C.Y. Goodall G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7984-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), and pBSΔβ (19Schiavone N. Rosini P. Quattrone A. Donnini M. Lapucci A. Citti L. Bevilacqua A. Nicolin A. Capaccioli S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 174-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), containing the rabbit β-globin cDNA, were linearized with DdeI and NcoI enzymes, respectively, and used for in vitro run-off transcriptions to produce specific antisense riboprobes. 10 fmol of 32P-labeled riboprobes were generated using T7 (pGAPM) and T3 (pBSΔβ) RNA polymerases in the presence of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions for the MaxiScript kit (Ambion). Riboprobes were synthesized to yield transcripts with specific activities of 1–2 × 104 cpm/fmol, and they were added (10 fmol each) to the total RNA isolated according to the Direct Protect™ Lysate RNase protection assay kit (Ambion). Protected RNA fragments were fractionated by denaturing gel electrophoresis, dried, and analyzed using a Cyclone Storage Phosphor System (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase band intensities were used to normalize β-globin bands to correct for loading errors. RNA half-lives and first-order decay constants were calculated from plots of percentage of remaining RNA versus time using Prism 3.03 (GraphPad software). Cloning of TINO—To identify trans-acting factors that interact with the BCL-2 ARE, a human placenta cDNA library was screened by the RNA THS. The bait RNA sequence used in the yeast RNA Three-hybrid library screening was the 107-nucleotide-long BCL-2 ARE (107-mer) located in the 3′-UTR of BCL-2 mRNA. For the synthesis of the hybrid RNA, the 107-mer cDNA was cloned downstream of the MS2 sequence in the pIIIA/MS2-1 RNA expression plasmid. The chimeric RNA is 5′MS2-B2ARE3′. Of the initial 1,040 white yeast double transformants recovered from plates of synthetic complete medium lacking Leu and His and containing 3 mm 3-aminotriazole, 11 were selected for sequencing reactions at the end of the screen. Indeed only these clones demonstrated binding specificity for the BCL-2 ARE as verified by yeast mating assays using the bait negative controls 5′IRE-MS23′, the unrelated RNA, and 5′MS2-B2ΔARE3′, the 107-mer sequence deleted of the UUAUUUAU segment. After sequencing, three different interacting sequence tags (ISTs) were selected for analysis. The first cDNA sequence identified (two ISTs), shared by six independent yeast clones, was the 40-kDa isoform of AUF1 protein, p40AUF1, an ARE-binding protein that we already demonstrated to interact in vitro with the BCL-2 ARE (16Lapucci A. Donnini M. Papucci L. Witort E. Tempestini A. Bevilacqua A. Nicolin A. Brewer G. Schiavone N. Capaccioli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16139-16146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The third IST, shared by five independent yeast clones, encoded a novel protein as determined using nucleotide-nucleotide BLAST. Consequently the presence of a previously uncharacterized human gene was revealed that we named TINO (Fig. 1). A second independent RNA three-hybrid library screening assay with a modified and improved version of the RNA THS was applied. 3M. Donnini, A. Lapucci, L. Papucci, E. Witort, A. Jacquier, S. Capaccioli, and N. Schiavone, unpublished results. Also with this modified RNA THS, p40AUF1 and TINO were recovered; in particular the same IST of the novel gene was cloned. The lacZ reporter gene assay indicated that TINO protein (pTINO) is the IST most specifically interacting with the BCL-2 ARE. Indeed a strong decrease in the transactivation signal was observed when this fusion protein was tested with 5′IRE-MS23′ or 5′MS2-B2ΔARE3′ RNAs for RNA-protein interactions. Thus we focused on the novel gene TINO (GenBank™ accession number AF458084). Recently a related cDNA sequence, KIAA2031 (GenBank™ accession number AB107353), was obtained from sequencing projects of large human transcripts with unknown function (20Kikuno R. Nagase T. Waki M. Ohara O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). TINO Protein Interacts in Vitro with the 107-mer ARE—To confirm the interaction of the novel protein with the 107-mer sequence, a gel electrophoresis mobility shift assay was performed. The pTINO was produced using the reticulocyte lysate system because of the difficulties producing recombinant protein either in bacteria or insect cells probably due to its toxicity. Increasing amounts of in vitro synthesized TINO protein mixture were incubated with the radioactively labeled 107-mer ARE; efficient complex formation was observed with pTINO for which the intensity parallels the volume of the protein"

https://openalex.org/W1965885258,"We recently reported that MDM2, a negative feedback regulator of the tumor suppressor p53, inhibits p300/CREB-binding protein-associated factor (PCAF)-mediated p53 acetylation. Our further study showed that MDM2 also regulates the stability of PCAF. MDM2 ubiquitinated PCAF in vitro and in cells. PCAF ubiquitination occurred at the N terminus and in the nucleus, as the nuclear localization signal sequence-deletion mutant of MDM2, which localized in the cytoplasm and degraded p53, was unable to degrade nuclear PCAF. Restriction of PCAF in the nucleus by leptomycin B did not affect MDM2-mediated PCAF degradation. Consistently, overexpression of MDM2 in p53 null cells caused the reduction of the protein level of PCAF, but not the mRNA level. Conversely, PCAF levels were higher in MDM2-deficient mouse p53-/-/mdm2-/- embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells than that in MDM2-containing MEF cells. Furthermore, MDM2 reduced the half-life of PCAF by 50%. These results demonstrate that MDM2 regulates the stability of PCAF by ubiquitinating and degrading this protein.

Ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis plays a pivotal role in regulating the turnover of many proteins that are crucial for cell homeostasis and growth. One important ubiquitin-proteasome pathway closely related to cell growth and tumorigenesis is mediated by an E3 ubiquitin ligase protein called MDM2 (1Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H.

Blood. 1993; 82: 2617-2623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The oncogenic activity of MDM2 is attributed primarily to its inhibitory effect on the function of the tumor suppressor p53 protein (9Momand J. Zambetti G.P. Olson D.C. George D. Levine A.J.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1001-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). p53 is a nuclear transcriptional activator that induces the expression of many genes, protein products of which mediate p53-dependent cell growth arrest and apoptosis, thus suppressing cell transformation and tumorigenesis (11Ko L.J.

Normally, p53 is hardly detectable in most tissues or cells because of its rapid degradation mediated by MDM2 (1Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H.

Because active p53 is extremely toxic to cells, MDM2 is also overproduced through transcription activation by p53 to monitor p53 activity in response to stresses (10Piette J. Neel H. Marechal V. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1001-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 18Barak Y. Juven T. Haffner R. Oren M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar, 19Oren M.

Thus, MDM2 serves as a negative feedback regulator of p53 as well (19Oren M. Damalas A. Gottlieb T. Michael D. Taplick J. Leal J.F. Maya R. Moas M. Seger R. Taya Y. Ben-Ze'ev A. Biochem.

Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of this feedback regulation is substantially illustrated by the fact that the lethal phenotype of the mdm2 knock-out mice is rescued by further deleting the p53 gene (22Jones S.N. Roe A.E. Donehower L.A. Bradley A. Nature. 1995; 378: 206-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar, 23Montes de Oca Luna R. Wagner D.S. Lozano G. Nature. 1995; 378: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar). Hence, p53 is the prime target of the MDM2-mediated ubiquitin-proteasome system in cell growth regulation. Whether MDM2 targets other proteins for ubiquitination and degradation has been a tempting question. An increasing number of proteins involving cell growth control, such as p14arf (p19arf for the mouse homolog), p300, CBP, Rb, E2F1, ATM, cyc G, PP2A, AKT, p73, and p63, have been shown to physically interact with MDM2 (24Pomerantz J.

However, no evidence has been presented so far to suggest that MDM2 could ubiquitinate these proteins or reduce their stability. However, several other proteins have been identified recently as the substrates for the MDM2 E3 ubiquitin ligase. These proteins include MDMx, β-arrestin, G-protein-coupled β2-adrenergic receptor, androgen receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, and Tip60, a histone acetyltransferase (40Pan Y. Chen J. Mol. Cell.

Dai M.S. Lu H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6365-6377Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and also ubiquitinate PSD95 (59Colledge M. Snyder E.M. Crozier R.A. Soderling J.A. Jin Y. Langeberg L.K. Lu H.

Identification of these non-p53 protein targets for MDM2 indicates that MDM2, in addition to regulating the p53 pathway, also plays a role in different cellular processes. Thus, identifying unknown substrates of MDM2 would reveal its new functions in cells. In our attempt to identify other possible substrates of the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2, we have tested whether a p300/CREB-binding protein-associated factor (PCAF) 1The abbreviations used are: PCAF, p300/CREB-binding protein-associated factor; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; MEF, mouse p53-/-/mdm2-/- embryonic fibroblast; HA, hemagglutinin; IB, immunoblot; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; HEK, human embryonic kidney; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; NLS, nuclear localization signal; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein. is a candidate. The idea for this test stemmed from our recent report in which we showed that MDM2 interacted with PCAF and inhibited its acetyltransferase activity on p53 (45Jin Y. Zeng S.X. Dai M.S. Yang X.J. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30838-30843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). PCAF contains an intrinsic histone acetyltransferase and functions as a coactivator for a number of transcriptional activators (46Imhof A. Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Wolffe A.P. Ge H. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 689-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 47Marmorstein R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). PCAF also acetylates p53 at lysine 320 in response to DNA damage signals and activates the activity of p53 (48Liu L. Scolnick D.M. Trievel R.C. Zhang H.B. Marmorstein R. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1202-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is significant if MDM2 can target PCAF for degradation. Indeed, our study as described here demonstrates that MDM2 ubiquitinates PCAF in vitro and in cells, leading to its degradation. Cell Culture—Human lung non-small cell carcinoma H1299 cells, human embryonic kidney epithelial 293 cells, and mouse p53-/-/ mdm2-/- embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells were cultured as described previously (35Zeng X. Chen L. Jost C.A. Maya R. Keller D. Wang X. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Oren M. Chen J. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3257-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The 293-HA-MDM2 stable cell line was established by introducing pCDNA3-HA-MDM2 into 293 cells and selecting with 0.5 mg/ml G418 for 3–4 weeks. Cell clones that expressed HA-MDM2 were confirmed by immunofluorescent staining and immunoblot (IB) analyses with anti-HA antibodies. Buffers—The lysis buffer consisted of 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Buffer C 100 included 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.9), 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.25 mg/ml pepstatin A. 1× SSC consisted of 0.15 m NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate (pH 7.0). Antibodies and Plasmids—Monoclonal anti-Flag and anti-α-tubulin antibodies were purchased from Sigma. The polyclonal anti-PCAF antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal anti-MDM2 antibodies 4B11 and 2A10 were described previously (35Zeng X. Chen L. Jost C.A. Maya R. Keller D. Wang X. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Oren M. Chen J. Lu H. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1993; 13: 4107-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). pCX-Flag-PCAF, pCX-Flag-ΔyGCN5, and pCX-Flag-Δ0–464 were described previously (45Jin Y. Zeng S.X. Dai M.S. Yang X.J. Lu H. J.

Purification of Recombinant UBA-1, UbcH5b, PCAF, MDM2, HA-Ubiquitin, and p53—PCAF and MDM2 were purified from baculovirus-infected SF9 insect cells using immunoaffinity columns as described (35Zeng X.

His-p53 and His-UbcH5b were purified from bacteria using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column as described (35Zeng X. Chen L. Jost C.A. Maya R. Keller D. Wang X. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Oren M. Chen J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 14799-14803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of the PCAF-associated Complex—The PCAF-associated complex was purified from stable Flag-PCAF-expressing HeLa cells using the method established previously (53Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T.

Purified proteins were analyzed by silver staining and immunoblotting assays. Transient Transfection and Immunoblot Analysis—H1299, HEK 293, and 293-HA-MDM2 stable cell lines (60% confluence in a 60-mm plate) were transfected with PCAF (1 μg) either alone or together with pCDNA3-HA-MDM2 or deletion mutant MDM2 (see the figure legends for the amount of plasmids used). 48 h post-transfection, cells were harvested for the preparation of whole cell lysates. Whole cell lysates containing 50 or 100 μg of protein were directly loaded onto an SDS gel, and proteins were detected by ECL reagents (Bio-Rad) after immunoblotting using antibodies as indicated in the figure legends. Immunoprecipitation-Immunoblot Analysis—Transfected HEK cells were harvested for preparation of cell lysate containing 300 μg of proteins used for immunoprecipitation, followed by immunoblot as described previously. Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blot analysis was conducted as described (54Zeng X. Keller D. Wu L. Lu H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6184-6188PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from transfected H1299 cells using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Fifteen μg of RNA were loaded onto a 1.5% agarose gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was exposed to UV light in a UV cross-linker (Fisher Biotech) and incubated with 32P-labeled cDNA probes encoding human PCAF at 42 °C overnight. After washing with 4× SSC once and 1× SSC twice, the blot was exposed to x-ray film overnight. Analysis of PCAF Half-life in Cells—For determination of the exogenous PCAF half-life, mouse p53-/-/mdm2-/- embryonic fibroblast cells or H1299 cells were transfected with the Flag-PCAF plasmid alone or together with the MDM2 expression plasmid as described above. 48 h after transfection, transiently transfected cells in 100-mm plates were treated with 50 μg/ml cycloheximide and harvested at different time points as indicated for the preparation of cell lysates. Equal amounts of proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot using the monoclonal anti-Flag antibody. These experiments were repeated twice. PCAF in Vitro Ubiquitination Analysis—The MDM2-mediated in vitro ubiquitination assay was performed as described previously (3Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The PCAF in vitro ubiquitination assay was carried out in 20 μl of a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm NaF, 3 μm okadaic acid, 100 ng of Flag-PCAF, 100 ng of MDM2, 200 ng of UBA-1, 200 ng of UbcH5b, 500 ng of HA-ubiquitin, 5 mm ATP (Amersham Biosciences), 1.5 mm ATPγS (Fisher ICN). As a control, His-p53 was used instead of PCAF. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min and analyzed on SDS-PAGE afterward. Ubiquitinated PCAF was detected by immunoblot using the polyclonal anti-PCAF antibody. Ubiquitinated His-p53 was detected by immunoblot using the monoclonal HA antibody. PCAF in Vivo Ubiquitination Assay—An in vivo ubiquitination assay was conducted as described previously (55Xirodimas D. Saville M.K. Edling C. Lane D.P. Lain S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4972-4983Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). HEK293 or 293 HA-MDM2 cells in 100-mm plates were transfected with His6-ubiquitin (2 μg), Flag-tagged wild type PCAF (2 μg), PCAF mutants (2 μg each), or HA-MDM2 (2 μg) expression plasmids using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen). 48 h after transfection, cells from each plate were harvested and split into two aliquots, one for straight immunoblot analysis and the other for detection of ubiquitinated proteins using Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen). Cell pellets were lysed in buffer A (6 m guanidinium chloride, 0.1 m Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and incubated with Ni-NTA beads at room temperature for 4 h. Beads were washed once with buffer A, buffer B (8 m urea, 0.1 m Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and buffer C (8 m urea, 0.1 m Na2HPO4/ NaH2PO4, 10mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.3, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Proteins were eluted from beads with buffer D (200 mm imidazole, 0.15 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 30% glycerol, 0.72 m β-mercaptoethanol, and 5% SDS). The eluted proteins were analyzed by immunoblot for the polyubiquitination of PCAF with monoclonal Flag antibodies (Sigma). Immunofluorescent Staining and Fluorescent Microscopic Analysis— H1299 cells were co-transfected with the plasmid encoding PCAF alone or with the MDM2 or Δ50–230MDM2 expression plasmids. 48 h after transfection, cells were fixed for immunofluorescent staining with monoclonal anti-Flag antibodies and polyclonal anti-MDM2 antibodies as well as for DNA staining with DAPI. The Alexa Fluor 488 (green) goat anti-mouse antibody and the Alexa Fluor 546 (red) goat anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes) were used for p21waf1/cip1 and MDM2, respectively. Stained cells were analyzed under the Zeiss Axiovert 25 fluorescent microscope. Glycerol Gradient Sedimentation Centrifugation—H1299 cells (60% confluence/10-cm plate × 3 plates) were transfected with the PCAF plasmid either alone or together with the MDM2 plasmid. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection for preparation of whole cell lysates. 400 μg of lysates from each sample were loaded onto the surface of a 12.5–25% glycerol gradient buffer in a 12-ml centrifuge tube. The samples were subjected to centrifugation in a SW41TI rotor (Beckman) at 32,000 rpm for 20 h. Approximately 250 μl per fraction were collected from each tube after centrifugation, and 30 μl of each fraction were used for IB analysis as shown (see Fig. 6B). Establishment of an in Vitro MDM2-mediated Ubiquitination Assay with Highly Purified Proteins—To identify new substrates for MDM2, first we wanted to establish an in vitro MDM2-mediated ubiquitination reaction using a defined system with purified proteins. As shown in Fig. 1, A–C, all of the required recombinant proteins including E1 (UbA-1), E2 (UbC-H5B), HA-ubiquitin, and MDM2 were highly purified. As a positive control, highly purified p53 (Fig. 1C) was used to test the activity of these pure proteins. In the reconstituted ubiquitination reaction, p53 was ubiquitinated by MDM2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1D). This ubiquitination was dependent on MDM2 (lane 1) and HA-ubiquitin (lane 6), as p53 was not ubiquitinated in the absence of either of them. It was also dependent on E1 and E2 (data not shown) as expected (3Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). This result was reproducible and clearly demonstrated that we were able to establish an efficient MDM2-dependent ubiquitination assay in vitro using highly purified proteins. MDM2 Ubiquitinates PCAF in Vitro and in Cells—After establishing the in vitro MDM2-mediated ubiquitination assay, we tested whether MDM2 was able to ubiquitinate PCAF in vitro. This idea originated from our recent study showing that MDM2 bound to PCAF and inhibited PCAF-mediated p53 acetylation and activation (45Jin Y. Zeng S.X. Dai M.S. Yang X.J. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30838-30843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To test this idea, Flag-PCAF was purified from the baculovirus expression system as shown in Fig. 2B. Using this purified PCAF, an in vitro PCAF ubiquitination assay was performed with the purified proteins as described above (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 2A, PCAF was ubiquitinated in vitro. This ubiquitination was dependent on MDM2, as no apparent ubiquitination of PCAF was detected in the absence of MDM2 (compare lane 4 with the rest of the lanes). This result was reproducible and suggests that MDM2 can ubiquitinate PCAF in vitro. To further confirm that PCAF is ubiquitinated by MDM2 in cells, we conducted an in vivo PCAF ubiquitination assay using HEK 293 cells, which contain a low level of MDM2, and stable MDM2-overexpressed HEK 293 cells (bottom panel of Fig. 2C). These cells were transfected with plasmids encoding His-ubiquitin or Flag-PCAF alone or together. Transfected cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 prior to being harvested for preparation of cell lysates. Ubiquitinated proteins were isolated using Ni-NTA beads and detected with antibodies against Flag-PCAF and MDM2. As shown in Fig. 2C, a basal level of Flag-PCAF ubiquitination was detected in the presence of His-ubiquitin in HEK 293 cells (lanes 3 and 4 of the top panel). By striking contrast, the ubiquitination of Flag-PCAF was remarkably elevated in the 293 cells that expressed the high level of MDM2 (lanes 7 and 8 of the top panel). Ubiquitination of Flag-PCAF was so marked that it was detectable even by a straight immunoblot analysis with antibodies against Flag after a longer exposure time of the membrane (lane 8 of the second panel from the top). This ubiquitination was dependent on both MDM2 and His-ubiquitin, as PCAF ubiquitination was not detectable if either of them was absent (lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6 of the top panel). Also, MDM2 autoubiquitination was detected in the presence of His-ubiquitin (lanes 5, 7, and 8 of the fourth panel from the top). The Flag-PCAF ubiquitination (lanes 7 and 8) was not a false result caused by the cross-contamination by MDM2 autoubiquitination, as polyubiquitinated bands were not detected using anti-Flag antibodies in the absence of Flag-PCAF (lane 5 of the top panel), whereas in the same lane ubiquitinated MDM2 molecules were clearly detected using anti-MDM2 antibodies (lane 5 of the fourth panel from the top). To further determine which region of PCAF is required for ubiquitination by MDM2, the same in vivo ubiquitination assay using the stable MDM2-expressed 293 cell line was performed, except that two PCAF deletion mutants without either the N terminus or C terminus were used as controls. As shown in Fig. 2D, the N-terminal half of PCAF lacking the GCN5-like domain was ubiquitinated in the MDM2-expressed 293 cells, whereas the C-terminal fragment lacking the region of amino acids 60–464 was not ubiquitinated even in the presence of His-ubiquitin (compare lane 5 with lane 7). The result indicates that the ubiquitination occurs in the N-terminal domain of amino acids 1–493, which is consistent with our previous study showing that this domain bound to MDM2 directly (45Jin Y. Zeng S.X. Dai M.S. Yang X.J. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30838-30843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results demonstrated that MDM2 ubiquitinates PCAF in cells, and the ubiquitination occurs at the MDM2-binding N terminus of PCAF. MDM2 Ubiquitinates the Complex-associated PCAF in Cells—Because PCAF has been shown to associate with other proteins including hTAFII31, forming a large multisubunit complex in cells (53Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schiltz R.L. Howard T. Yang X.J. Howard B.H. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1998; 94: 35-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 56Schiltz R.L. Nakatani Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1470: M37-M53Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we wanted to test whether MDM2 is able to target the complex-associated PCAF. First, we determined whether MDM2 could interact with the complex-associated PCAF by comparing the PCAF-associated complex with the Flag-PCAF monomer. The former was purified from a stable Flag-PCAF-expressing HeLa cell line (Fig. 3, A and B), and the latter was purified from insect cells (Fig. 2B) through a Flag-immunoaffinity column followed by gel-filtration chromatography (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3C, PCAF was co-immunoprecipitated with MDM2 by the anti-MDM2 antibody when either the Flag-PCAF-associated complex or the PCAF monomer was used. The observation that MDM2 can interact with PCAF even when it is in the complex suggested that MDM2 may target the complex-associated PCAF for ubiquitination as well. To test this idea, we performed an in vivo ubiquitination assay. Stable Flag-PCAF-expressing HeLa cells, which were used for purifying the PCAF-associated complex (Fig. 3), were transfected with MDM2 and His-ubiquitin plasmids and harvested 48 h after transfection. The Flag-PCAF-associated complex was purified through the same two-step procedures as those used for the results of Fig. 3: Flag-immunoaffinity and gel filtration columns. Consistent with the results of Fig. 3, the purified PCAF associated with a complex of ∼700 kDa (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, this PCAF protein was also ubiquitinated (Fig. 4B). This ubiquitination was indeed mediated by MDM2, as no ubiquitination of PCAF was detected in the absence of MDM2 even though His-ubiquitin was present (Fig. 4, C and D). Because Flag-PCAF already associated with the complex (Fig. 3A) prior to the transient introduction of MDM2 into the cells, ubiquitination of PCAF by MDM2 must occur when PCAF is in the complex instead of in a free form. These results demonstrate that MDM2 can bind to and ubiquitinate PCAF even when PCAF is in the complex.Fig. 4MDM2 ubiquitinates the complex-associated PCAF in cells. Stable Flag-PCAF-expressing HeLa cells (60% confluence of six 100-mm plates) were transfected with plasmids encoding MDM2 and His-ubiquitin. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and overnight after MG-132 treatment for preparation of whole cell extracts. The Flag-PCAF complex was purified through a Flag-immunoaffinity column followed by a Superdex 200 column. 30 μl of fractions or input as indicated below the panels were analyzed by immunoblot assays using antibodies against either PCAF (A) or ubiquitin (B). C and D show the results from the same analysis, except only the His-ubiquitin plasmid was introduced into the same HeLa cells. # denotes possibly ubiquitinated PCAF polypeptides, and * indicates short PCAF polypeptides possibly cleaved during purification.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) MDM2 Leads to the Decrease of PCAF Level in Cells—Next, we wanted to determine whether MDM2 regulates the stability of PCAF. To test this idea, human non-small cell carcinoma H1299 cells, which are devoid of p53, were transfected with the Flag-PCAF plasmid and HA-MDM2 plasmid either alone or together. Cells were harvested 40 h after transfection for immunoblot and Northern blot analyses. As shown in Fig. 5A, overexpression of MDM2 led to a marked decrease in the PCAF level (top panel). This decrease was not caused by the inhibition of PCAF transcription, as its mRNA level was not affected in the presence of MDM2 (third panel from the top). To test whether MDM2 affects the level of PCAF in the nucleus or cytoplasm, a similar transfection assay was conducted except that an MDM2 deletion mutant lacking the NLS-containing region was used. Proteins were analyzed by immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag antibodies, followed by immunoblot analysis with antibodies against PCAF and MDM2, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5B, overexpression of wild type, but not the deletion mutant, MDM2 resulted in the drastic decline of the PCAF level. Also, wild type, but not the mutant, MDM2 was co-immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibodies, suggesting that the mutant MDM2 did not interact with Flag-PCAF. This result is in agreement with our previously published results (45Jin Y. Zeng S.X. Dai M.S. Yang X.J. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30838-30843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and also is consistent with the fact that the NLS-deleted MDM2 mutant localized in the cytoplasm whereas PCAF stayed in the nucleus (Fig. 5C). Because this deletion mutant was still able to mediate p53 ubiquitination and degradation (58Jin Y. Lee H. Zeng S.X. Dai M.S. Lu H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6365-6377Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar; data not shown), the cellular compartments may prevent PCAF degradation by this MDM2 mutant. Moreover, the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B did not affect MDM2-mediated PCAF degradation (Fig. 5D), supporting the idea that PCAF was degraded in the nucleus. Consistently, the resultant decrease in PCAF levels by MDM2 was mediated by the proteasomal pathway, as this decrease was reversed by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 5E) and ALLN (data not shown). Well correlated with these results was that the level of endogenous PCAF in p53-/- MEF cells, which contains endogenous MDM2, was markedly lower than that in p53-/-/mdm2-/- MEF cells (Fig. 5F). In conclusion, these results indicate that MDM2 mediated PCAF degradation in the nucleus. MDM2 Reduces the Half-life of PCAF—To demonstrate that MDM2 regulates the stability but not the translation of PCAF, we determined the effect of MDM2 on the proteasomal turnover of PCAF in cells. p53-deficient H1299 or p53 and mdm2 double knock-out MEF cells were transfected with the Flag-PCAF plasmid either alone or together with the HA-MDM2 plasmid. Cells were treated with cyclohexamide, a protein translation inhibitor, and harvested at different time points post-treatment for immunoblot analysis with anti-Flag antibodies. As shown in Fig. 6A, PCAF level was remarkably reduced in the presence of MDM2, and its half-life was markedly shortened by ∼50% from greater than 4 h to ∼2 h (Fig. 6A). MDM2 also remarkably reduced the half-life of PCAF in p53-/-/mdm2-/- MEF cells. 2Y. Jin, S. X. Zeng, H. Lee, and H. Lu, unpublished data. To further determine whether degradation of PCAF by MDM2 would affect the steady level of the free form or complex form of PCAF in cells, we performed a transient transfection of H1299 cells with PCAF alone or together with MDM2, followed by a glycerol gradient sedimentation centrifugation analysis. As shown in Fig. 6B, overexpression of MDM2 remarkably reduced both the free and complex forms of PCAF in the cells (compare the levels of PCAF between the right and left panels). These results demonstrated that MDM2 enhanced the proteasomal turnover of PCAF by ubiquitinating and degrading this protein. This degradation led to marked reduction of both free PCAF proteins and the complex form of PCAF in cells. Our study demonstrates that we have identified PCAF as another ubiquitination substrate for MDM2. At least three lines of evidence support this statement. First, MDM2 ubiquitinates PCAF in vitro and in cells. Also, overexpression of MDM2 resulted in marked reduction of PCAF at the protein, but not mRNA, level. This reduction is reversed by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and ALLN, suggesting that MDM2-led PCAF reduction is caused by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In line with these results, endogenous PCAF levels are much lower in MDM2-containing MEF cells than in MDM2-deficient MEF cells. Interestingly, MDM2 appears to mediate PCAF degradation in the nucleus, which is consistent with a recent report showing that p53 polyubiquitination and degradation mediated by MDM2 can also occur in the nucleus (60Li M. Brooks C.L. Wu-Baer F. Chen D. Baer R. Gu W. Science. 2003; 302: 972-1975Google Scholar). Finally, MDM2 significantly reduces the half-life of PCAF and the level of the free and the complex-associated PCAF molecules in cells. Thus PCAF is a new target for the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2. Identification of PCAF as a substrate for MDM2 raises several interesting questions and possibilities. First, our previous study showed that MDM2 inhibited PCAF-catalyzed p53 acetylation in vitro and in cells (45Jin Y. Zeng S.X. Dai M.S. Yang X.J. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30838-30843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It is possible that the down-regulation of PCAF-mediated p53 activation by MDM2 is partially attributed to the ability of MDM2 to ubiquitinate PCAF and to target this protein for proteasomal degradation. Also, because PCAF has been shown to form a large complex with more than 20 different proteins, including some TATA-binding protein-associated factors in cells (53Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schiltz R.L. Howard T. Yang X.J. Howard B.H. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1998; 94: 35-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 56Schiltz R.L. Nakatani Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1470: M37-M53Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), it is likely that MDM2 may impair the complex formation by reducing the level of PCAF (Fig. 6B). In doing so, MDM2 might suppress transcription of those genes whose expression requires the PCAF-associated complex. Alternatively, MDM2 may influence PCAF-mediated transcription by ubiquitinating this protein. Correlated with this hypothesis is the observation that MDM2 is able to bind to and ubiquitinate PCAF that associates with a complex (Figs. 3 and 4) and to inhibit PCAF-stimulated p53 transcriptional activity by associating with the p53 responsive promoter (45Jin Y. Zeng S.X. Dai M.S. Yang X.J. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30838-30843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), although it is still necessary to clarify whether this inhibition is caused by the association of MDM2 with p53 or PCAF ubiquitination, or both, at the promoter. Moreover, PCAF has two other homologs, PCAF-B and hGCN5 (56Schiltz R.L. Nakatani Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1470: M37-M53Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It would be interesting to see if MDM2 also regulates these PCAF homologs through a ubiquitin-dependent mechanism. Finally, p300/CBP was recently shown to assist MDM2 in polyubiquitinating p53 and leading to its degradation (57Grossman S.R. Deato M.E. Brignone C. Chan H.M. Kung A.L. Tagami H. Nakatani Y. Livingston D.M. Science. 2003; 300: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). PCAF was originally identified as a p300/CBP-associated protein (50Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). Thus the next step would be to determine whether p300/CBP may also help MDM2 polyubiquitinate PCAF and accelerate its degradation, given our observation that PCAF appeared to be more efficiently ubiquitinated by MDM2 in cells than in vitro (Figs. 2 and 4). Of note, PCAF is a tissue- or cell-specific protein (50Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar), and thus its regulation by MDM2 may occur merely in a tissue- or cell-specific fashion under certain pathological or physiological conditions. Addressing these remaining questions in the near future would further our understanding of the MDM2-mediated regulation of the PCAF-p53 pathway as well as other PCAF-dependent transcriptional pathways.

https://openalex.org/W2090997831,"Dysregulation of the human transforming acidic coiled coil (TACC) genes is thought to be important in the development of multiple myeloma, breast and gastric cancer. However, even though these proteins have been implicated in the control of cell growth and differentiation, the mechanism by which they function still remains to be clarified. Using the yeast two-hybrid assay, we have now identified the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) hGCN5L2 as a TACC2-binding protein. GST pull-down analysis subsequently confirmed that all human TACC family members can bind in vitro to hGCN5L2. The authenticity of these interactions was validated by coimmunoprecipitation assays within the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293, which identified the TACC2s isoform as a component consistently bound to several different members of HAT family. This raises the possibility that aberrant expression of one or more TACC proteins may affect gene regulation through their interaction with components of chromatin remodeling complexes, thus contributing to tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1977513244,"Several studies have shown that ceramide (CER) glucosylation contributes to drug resistance in multidrug-resistant cells and that inhibition of glucosylceramide synthase sensitizes cells to various drug treatments. However, the role of glucosylceramide synthase has not been studied in drug-sensitive cancer cells. We have demonstrated previously that the anthracycline daunorubicin (DNR) rapidly induces interphasic apoptosis through neutral sphingomyelinase-mediated CER generation in human leukemic cell lines. We now report that inhibition of glucosylceramide synthase using d,l-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP) or 1-phenyl-2-palmitoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PPMP) protected U937 and HL-60 cells from DNR-induced apoptosis. Moreover, blocking CER glucosylation did not lead to increased CER levels but to increased CER galactosylation. We also observed that pretreating cells with galactosylceramide (GalCER) significantly inhibited DNR-induced apoptosis. Finally, we show that GalCER-enriched lymphoblast cells (Krabbe's disease) were significantly more resistant to DNR- and cytosine arabinoside-induced apoptosis as compared with normal lymphoblasts, whereas glucosylceramide-enriched cells (Gaucher's disease) were more sensitive.

Chalfant C.E. Hannun Y.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 114-125Google Scholar). On the basis of these studies, our group investigated the role of the sphingomyelin-CER (SM-CER) pathway in daunorubicin- (DNR-) and Ara-C-induced apoptosis. Clinically relevant DNR and Ara-C concentrations (1 and 40 μm, respectively (2Gewirtz D.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 727-741Google Scholar, 3Chabner B.A. Myers C.E. Coleman C.N. Johns D.G. N.

Cancer (Phila.). 1992; 69: 2603-2609Google Scholar). These cells present an altered pharmacology of drugs in relationship to the overexpression of the gene product of MDR1, an integral membrane protein termed P-glycoprotein, which acts as a drug efflux pump, thereby preventing them from accumulating in the tumor cell. MDR cells have also been shown to present altered lipid composition such as elevated cholesterol and SM as well as glycolipids (for review, see Ref. 8Lavie Y. Fiucci G. Czarny M. Liscovitch M. Lipids. 1999; 34: S57-S63Google Scholar). One glycolipid in particular is in the lime light, glucosylceramide (GlcCER).In 1996, Cabot and co-workers (9Lavie Y. Cao H. Bursten S.L. Giuliano A.E. Cabot M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19530-19536Google Scholar) first demonstrated that drug-resistant MCF-7-AdrR breast cancer cells accumulated GlcCER in comparison with wild-type MCF-7 cells. This study was followed by a series of studies that clearly demonstrated that by blocking GlcCER synthesis (such as with d,l-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP)) one could sensitize MDR cells to chemotherapeutic drugs (for review, see Ref. 10Senchenkov A. Litvak D.A. Cabot M.C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 347-357Google Scholar). Furthermore, increasing CER glucosylation by transfecting wild-type MCF-7 cells with glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) led to an increase in Adriamycin resistance (11Liu Y.Y. Han T.Y. Giuliano A.E. Cabot M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1140-1146Google Scholar). The gist of these studies provided ample evidence that GlcCER contributes greatly to drug resistance. However, the role of GCS in drug-sensitive cells has largely been overlooked.In this study, we elected to investigate the effect of blocking GCS in our highly drug-sensitive leukemic models. Surprisingly, we observed that by using the classic GCS inhibitors PDMP and PPMP, we completely blocked DNR- and Ara-C-induced apoptosis. Moreover, we demonstrated that by inhibiting the glucosylation of CER, galactosylation is increased and that this is associated with DNR and Ara-C resistance.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDrugs and Reagents—DNR (cerubidine®) was supplied by Laboratoire Roger Bellon (Neuilly-sur-Seine, France) and 1-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine (Ara-C) by Upjohn (Paris, France). Silica gel 60 thin-layer aluminum sheet chromatography plates were from Merck. 12-(N-methyl-N-[7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl])-labeled CER (NBD-CER) was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). GalCER, which was purified from bovine brain, was generously obtained from Prof. Thierry Levade (INSERM U466, Toulouse, France). All other drugs and reagents were purchased from Sigma, Carlo Erba (Rueil-Malmaison, France), or Prolabo (Paris, France).Cell Culture—The human leukemic cell lines U937 and HL-60 were purchased from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). The multidrug-resistant U935-DR cell line was generously provided by Dr. H. Morjani (CNRS Unité Mixte de Recherche 6142, Reims, France) (12Durrieu F. Belaud-Rotureau M.A. Lacombe F. Dumain P. Reiffers J. Boisseau M.R. Bernard P. Belloc F. Cytometry. 1999; 36: 140-149Google Scholar). Human Epstein-Barr virus-transformed peripheral blood lymphocytes were derived from control subjects (cell lines Dau, Cha, Gha, and Lel), from a patient affected with Gaucher's disease (cell lines Cas, Vio, Cuc, and Tre), or from patients with Krabbe's disease (cell lines Nun, Den, and GM6805). These cell lines were kindly provided by Prof. Thierry Levade (INSERM U466, Toulouse, France). Cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 μg/ml penicillin (all from Eurobio, les Ulis, France) at 37 °C and 5% CO2.DNA Analysis—Apoptotic nuclei were visualized after the cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, washed in 150 mm phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, stained by the DNA-intercalating fluorescent probe DAPI (0.1 μg/ml in (pH 7.0) Tris/EDTA/NaCl (10:10:100 v/v)), and mounted in Fluoprep for fluorescence microscopy (Leica model Diaplan). In each experiment, the presence or absence of apoptotic nuclei in samples of 300 cells was scored by two independent observers. For quantitative DNA fragmentation, cells were allowed to lyse for 15 min in 500 μl of lysis buffer (5 g/liter Triton X-100, 20 mm EDTA, and 5 mm Tris, pH 8.0) and were then ultracentrifuged for 30 min at 20,000 × g to separate the chromatin pellet from cleavage products. The pellet (resuspended in 500 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm EDTA) and the supernatant were assayed for DNA determination by the spectrofluorometric DAPI procedure (13Kapuscinski J. Skooczylas B. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 252-257Google Scholar).Analysis of Exogenous CER Metabolism—5 × 106 cells were preincubated with 5 μm NBD-CER for 45 min at 4 °C. Cells were then incubated in kinetic experiments at 37 °C. At each time point, cells were washed, and lipids were extracted and resolved by thin-layer chromatography developed in chloroform/methanol/water (100:42:6, by volume) up to two-thirds of the plate and then in chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (70:30:5, by volume). NBD-labeled lipid products were visualized under a UV light, scraped, and eluted in chloroform/methanol (2:1). NBD fluorescence (emitted at 536 nm) was quantitated by fluorometry (excitation at 466 nm) (14Lipsky N.G. Pagano R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2608-2612Google Scholar).Metabolic Cell Labeling and Quantitation of CER and Metabolites— Total cellular CER and CER metabolite quantitation was performed by labeling cells to isotopic equilibrium with 1 μCi/ml [9,10-3H]palmitic acid (53.0 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) for 48 h in complete medium as described previously (4Jaffrézou J.P. Levade T. Bettaieb A. Andrieu N. Bezombes C. Maestre N. Vermeersch S. Rousse A. Laurent G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2417-2424Google Scholar). Cells were then washed and resuspended in serum-free medium for kinetic experiments. Lipids were extracted and resolved by thin-layer chromatography developed in chloroform/methanol/acidic acid/formic acid/water (65:30:10:4:2, by volume) up to two-thirds of the plate and then in chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (94:5:5, by volume). CER and CER metabolites were scraped and quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Lipid standards were used to identify the various metabolic products.Caspase-3 Activity Assay—Caspase-3 colorimetric activity assay (R&D Systems, Abingdon, United Kingdom) was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, 2 × 107/ml cells were washed and resuspended in lysis buffer collected by centrifugation. Lysis buffer was added on the cell pellet, incubated on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. For each lysate, 10 μl of supernatant was incubated with caspase-3 colorimetric substrate for 2 h at 37 °C. Cleavage of the substrate by caspase-3 was quantified spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 405 nm.Statistical Analysis—Student's t test was used for statistical analysis.RESULTSEffect of PDMP and PPMP on DNR-induced Apoptosis in U937 Cells—The effect of GCS inhibition was evaluated in drug-sensitive myeloid leukemia cells. Treatment of U937 cells for 6 h with 1 μm DNR presented significant apoptosis (∼50%) as estimated by morphological analysis (Fig. 1). Apoptosis was also confirmed by DNA laddering and poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase cleavage (data not shown) (4Jaffrézou J.P. Levade T. Bettaieb A. Andrieu N. Bezombes C. Maestre N. Vermeersch S. Rousse A. Laurent G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2417-2424Google Scholar). However, when the cells were pretreated for 15 h with 20 μm PDMP or 20 μm PPMP, DNR-induced apoptosis was significantly reduced. Similar results were observed with Ara-C and on U937 and HL-60 cells (data not shown) (5Bezombes C. Plo I. Mansat-De Mas V. Quillet-Mary A. Negre-Salvayre A. Laurent G. Jaffrézou J.P. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1583-1585Google Scholar). This surprising observation led us to confirm whether, in an MDR version of our cell model (U937-DR), PDMP could sensitize this cell line to DNR. DNR alone presented little cytotoxic effect on U937-DR cells after 6 h of incubation. However, in the presence of PDMP, we observed a ∼4-fold increase in apoptosis (2.2% versus 8.9%) (data not shown).Effect of PDMP on DNR-induced CER Generation—To confirm the efficacy of GCS inhibition by PDMP, a dose-effect study was performed using NBD-CER. As shown in Fig. 2A, PDMP at 20 μm almost completely blocked, as expected, NBD-CER conversion to NBD-GlcCER (>90% inhibition). Higher concentrations were cytotoxic (data not shown). Moreover, we observed that concomitant with this inhibition was a pronounced increase in NBD-GalCER generation. From these observations, it appears that NBD-CER glucosylation is compensated by NBD-CER galactosylation. However, in U937-DR cells, 20 μm PDMP also significantly decreased NBD-GlcCER levels (although less efficiently); however, we observed little NBD-GalCER formation (Fig. 2B). It is noteworthy that in the parental U937 cells, the metabolism of NBD-CER to NBD-GlcCER and -GalCER appears comparable in the absence of PDMP, whereas in the MDR U937-DR cells, NBD-GalCER formation is very limited.Fig. 2Effect of PDMP on NBD-CER metabolism. U937 cells (A) were incubated with increasing concentrations of PDMP for 15 h followed by a 3-h incubation with 5 μm NBD-CER. Similarly, U937-DR cells (B) were incubated with or without 20 μm PDMP. Fluorescent lipids were extracted and resolved by thin-layer chromatography and photographed under UV light (365 nm). Lipids were then scraped and quantitated by fluorometry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are representative of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Since PDMP appeared to redirect CER metabolism toward galactosylation, we investigated the effect of PDMP on drug-induced endogenous CER generation. Indeed, apoptosis induced by DNR in myeloid leukemia cells has been correlated with early SM-derived CER generation (for review, see Ref. 15Laurent G. Jaffrézou J.P. Blood. 2001; 98: 913-924Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, PDMP did not affect DNR-induced CER generation (∼20–30% increase at 8 min). Moreover, PDMP had no significant effect on basal endogenous CER and GlcCER levels (Fig. 3, inset). A previous study (16Nicholson K.M. Quinn D.M. Kellett G.L. Warr J.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 423-430Google Scholar) showed modest if any effect of 75 μm PDMP on CER and GlcCER levels in the drug-sensitive human carcinoma cell line KB-3-1 after 24 h. Significant decrease in GlcCER and increase in CER have only been observed for longer time periods (72 h (17Naslavsky N. Shmeeda H. Friedlander G. Yanai A. Futerman A.H. Barenholz Y. Taraboulos A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20763-20771Google Scholar) to 1 week (18Mutoh T. Tokuda A. Inokuchi J. Kuriyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26001-26007Google Scholar)). These observations underline that exogenous NBD-CER is rapidly metabolized by GCS (and therefore easily blocked by PDMP) and evacuated from the cells (19Lipsky N.G. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 27-34Google Scholar). However, the endogenous conversion of CER by GCS of our myeloid leukemic cells is not readily PDMP-sensitive.Fig. 3Effect of PDMP on DNR-induced CER generation. 5 × 105/ml U937 cells were preincubated with (black circles) or without (white circles) 20 μm PDMP for 15 h and then treated with 1 μm DNR for the time intervals indicated. CER levels were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Inset, basal CER and GlcCER levels in U937 cells treated with (white bars) or without (gray bars) PDMP. Results are representative of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. *, p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Effect of DNR on CER Metabolism—Since PDMP protected U937 cells from DNR-induced apoptosis but did not affect DNR-induced CER generation, we investigated the effect of DNR on endogenous CER metabolism. As shown in Fig. 4, treatment of U937 cells with DNR led to a rapid time-dependent decrease in [3H]palmitic acid-labeled GlcCER. GlcCER was rapidly metabolized to form [3H]lactosylceramide, followed by [3H]GM3 and finally [3H]GD3, which accumulated at 4 h. It is at this time that we showed previously that the initial phases of the execution step of apoptosis are initiated (20Jaffrézou J.P. Maestre N. Mansat-Demas V. Bezombes C. Levade T. Laurent G. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 999-1006Google Scholar). Indeed, GD3 has been shown previously to be a potent apoptotic mediator directly targeting mitochondria and disrupting mitochondrial transmembrane potential (21DeMaria R. Lenti L.

The quantitation of CER metabolites was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are representative of two independent experiments performed in triplicate. *, significantly different from control (p < 0.01). Basal GlcCER, lactosylceramide (LacCER), GM3, and GD3 were 109 ± 46, 42 ± 12, 86 ± 14, and 67 ± 17 pmol/mg protein, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Effect of GalCER on DNR-induced Apoptosis—In our cell model, PDMP blocked DNR-induced apoptosis and prevented the metabolism of NBD-CER to NBD-GlcCER while increasing the formation of NBD-GalCER (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, PDMP had little effect on DNR-induced SM-derived CER generation (Fig. 3). We investigated whether PDMP and PPMP could reproduce these effects on endogenous [3H]palmitic acid-labeled CER. As shown in Fig. 5, DNR alone had no significant effect on GalCER levels in U937 cells, but when cells were pretreated with PDMP or PPMP, DNR induced a significant increase in [3H]GalCER. Moreover, PDMP and PPMP alone induced a drastic increase in basal [3H]GalCER levels (∼3-fold increase), confirming what was already observed with NBD-CER.Fig. 5Effect of PDMP and PPMP on GalCER levels in DNR-treated U937 cells. 3 × 105 U937 cells were preincubated in the absence (□) or in the presence (▪) of 20 μm PDMP or in the presence of 20 μm PPMP (•) for 15 h and then treated with 1 μm DNR for the time intervals indicated. GalCER levels were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are representative of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. *, significantly different from control (p < 0.01).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To examine whether this increase in GalCER could present an antiapoptotic effect, we investigated whether exogenous GalCER could influence DNR-induced apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 6, pretreatment of U937 cells with 5 μm GalCER presented a significant inhibition of DNR-induced apoptosis. However, 10 μm GalCER alone presented cell toxicity, which precluded its use (data not shown). Experiments were also performed using psychosine (the immediate metabolite of GalCER), but no cytoprotective effect was observed (data not shown). Finally, we investigated whether sphingosine-1-phosphate could contribute to the observed cytoprotective effect of PDMP. Cells were co-incubated with 10 μm dimethylsphingosine (an inhibitor of sphingosine kinase) and PDMP for 15 h, followed by an additional 6 h with 1 μm DNR. In this study, we did not observe any significant effect of dimethylsphingosine on cell survival (data not shown).Fig. 6Effect of GalCER on DNR-induced apoptosis. U937 cells were either untreated (white bars) or preincubated in the presence of 1 μm (gray bars) or 5 μm (black bars) GalCER for 18 h and then treated with 1 μm DNR for 6 h. A, percent of apoptotic cells was determined by morphological analysis using DAPI staining. B, caspase-3 activity was measured using a colorimetric assay. Results are mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. *, significantly different compared with DNR-treated U937 cells in the absence of GalCER (p < 0.01).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Effect of DNR on Gaucher's and Krabbe's Disease Lymphocytes—Since our observations indicated that the metabolism of CER toward GD3 is an important apoptotic pathway whereas the conversion of CER toward GalCER is potentially antiapoptotic, we investigated the sensitivity to both DNR and Ara-C on cells that constitutively present deficient catabolism of GlcCER or GalCER, Gaucher and Krabbe cells, respectively (24Hardy B. Teitelman-Weissman B. Chazan S. Neri A. Biomed. Pharmacother. 1987; 41: 40-44Google Scholar, 25O'Brien J.S. Bernett J. Veath M.L. Paa D. Arch. Neurol. 1975; 32: 592-599Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7 compared with four normal immortalized lymphocytic cell lines, the four Gaucher cell lines were significantly more sensitive to DNR-induced apoptosis, whereas the three Krabbe cell lines were significantly more resistant. Since basal apoptotic levels were observed to be similar, one could speculate that GlcCER and GalCER levels are only implicated in stress-induced cell signaling. Although this is highly indirect evidence, these observations underline the potential role of GalCER as an antiapoptotic lipid.Fig. 7Effect of DNR on Gaucher's and Krabbe's disease lymphoblasts. Four normal (white circles), four Gaucher (black circles), and three Krabbe (gray circles) lymphoblast cell lines were either untreated or treated for 6 h with either 1 μm DNR or 40 μm Ara-C. The percent of apoptotic cells was determined by morphological analysis using DAPI staining. Results are the mean of triplicate determinations ± S.E.

Negre-Salvayre A. Laurent G. Jaffrézou J.P. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1583-1585Google Scholar). The initial generation of CER has been shown to be implicated in apoptosis signaling in several human leukemia cells, as well as in a number of acid sphingomyelinase-deficient models (4Jaffrézou J.P.

Chem. 2001; 276: 24901-24910Google Scholar) have shown that only this initial CER generation but not the later delayed CER accumulation (which is at least partially fumonisin B-inhibitable) is correlated with apoptosis signaling.Surprisingly, pretreatment of U937 cells with PDMP or PPMP completely blocked DNR-induced apoptosis, while it sensitized the MDR U937-DR model (data not shown). Moreover, blocking GCS did not lead to an increase in DNR-induced CER generation but to an increase in GalCER content, which was not observed in the MDR model. It has been demonstrated previously that in drug-sensitive Jurkat cells, retrovirally transduced with GlcCER, CER generated by ligation of the death receptor CD95, or etoposide, or γ-radiation was not glycosylated by GCS (30Tepper A.D. Diks S.H. van Blitterswijk W.J. Borst J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34810-34817Google Scholar). In contrast, de novo synthesized CER as well as an exogenously supplied cell-permeable CER analog was efficiently glycosylated. The authors (30Tepper A.D. Diks S.H. van Blitterswijk W.J. Borst J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34810-34817Google Scholar) concluded that GCS, located at the Golgi, is topologically segregated from CER produced in the plasma membrane. Therefore, the ability of GCS overexpression to protect cells from possible detrimental effects of CER accumulation is limited. To determine the potential role of GalCER in “protecting” U937 cells from DNR, we preincubated the cells with 5 μm GalCER before drug treatment. Our study shows that exogenous GalCER protected U937 cells from DNR- and Ara-C-induced apoptosis. Finally, to further underline the role of GlcCER and GalCER in cell response to DNR and Ara-C, we treated Krabbe and Gaucher cells, which are inherently defective in GalCER and GlcCER metabolism, respectively, with both drugs. Interestingly, compared with normal lymphoblasts, cells originating from Krabbe patients were more resistant to both DNR- and Ara-C-induced apoptosis, whereas Gaucher cells presented significantly greater sensitivity. The observation that basal apoptotic levels were similar in all cell types suggests that endogenous GalCER and GlcCER levels only play a role in modulating stress-induced cell signaling (survival versus cell death).CER has long been considered a proapoptotic mediator (for review, see Ref. 1Pettus B.J. Chalfant C.E. Hannun Y.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 114-125Google Scholar), and inhibition of GlcCER synthesis leading to increased CER content has been considered to be the mechanism by which PDMP sensitizes MDR cells (10Senchenkov A. Litvak D.A. Cabot M.C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 347-357Google Scholar). However, there are several studies that show that apoptosis induction by CER requires its conversion to GD3 (21DeMaria R. Lenti L. Malisan F. d'Agostino F. Tomassini B. Zeuner A. Rippo M.R. Testi R. Science. 1997; 277: 1652-1655Google Scholar, 22Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Paris R. Fernandez-Checa J.C. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 847-858Google Scholar, 23Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Morales A. Calvo M. Enrich C. Fernandez-Checa J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36443-36448Google Scholar). Since the first step in this conversion is the glucosylation of CER, one would expect that cells enriched in GlcCER would present higher sensitivity to apoptosis. Indeed, Tepper et al. (30Tepper A.D. Diks S.H. van Blitterswijk W.J. Borst J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34810-34817Google Scholar) did notice a modest sensitization of retrovirally transduced Jurkat cells with GCS to CD95 ligation.A close look at the literature suggests that blocking GlcCER synthesis does not necessarily lead to increased apoptosis. Indeed, okadaic acid-induced CER elevation, while markedly potentiated by blocking GlcCER synthesis, did not result in increased apoptosis in human CHP-100 neuroepithelioma cells (31Di Bartolomeo S. Spinedi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 269-274Google Scholar). Such discrepancies may be explained by different basal levels of GlcCER and GalCER. For example, HepG2 hepatoma cells displayed only a modest apoptotic response to doxorubicin treatment (32Di Bartolomeo S. Spinedi A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 851-856Google Scholar). Since liver cells are rich in GalCER (33Nilsson O. Svennerholm L. J. Lipid R"
https://openalex.org/W2009762528,"RNA helicase A (RHA) is a member of the DEAD/H family of RNA helicases and unwinds duplex RNA and DNA. Recent studies have shown that RHA regulates the activity of gene promoters. However, little information is available about the in vivo relevance of RHA in the regulation of natural genes. We previously characterized a nuclear protein (MEF1) that binds to the proximal promoter of the multidrug resistance gene (MDR1) and up-regulates the promoter activity. In the present study, we isolated and identified RHA as a component of the MEF1 complex by using DNA-affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry. The antibody against RHA specifically disrupted the complex formation in electrophoretic mobility shift assay, confirming the identity of RHA. Western blotting showed that RHA in drug-resistant cells had a higher molecular weight than that in drug-sensitive cells. Similar results were obtained when FLAG-tagged RHA was overexpressed in these cells. This size difference probably reflects posttranslational modification(s) of RHA in drug-resistant cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that RHA occupies the MDR1 promoter in vivo. Overexpression of RHA enhanced expression of the MDR1 promoter/reporter construct and endogenous P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the MDR1 gene product, and increased drug resistance of drug-resistant cells but not the drug-sensitive counterpart. Introduction of short interfering RNA targeting the RHA gene sequence selectively knocked-down RHA expression and concomitantly reduced P-gp level. Thus, our study demonstrates, for the first time, the involvement of RHA in up-regulation of the MDR1 gene. Interactions of RHA with other protein factors in the MEF1 complex bound to the promoter element may contribute to P-gp overexpression and multidrug resistance phenotype in drug-resistant cancer cells.

Proteins of this family have seven conserved motifs in the helicase core and bind ATP (1Caruthers J.M. McKay D.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Aside from the central helicase core, RHA contains two copies of a double-stranded RNA-binding domain at its N terminus and a Arg-Gly-Gly (RGG) box at its C terminus that binds single-stranded nucleic acids (2Zhang S. Grosse F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11487-11494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). RHA unwinds both duplex RNA and DNA in an ATP-dependent fashion (3Zhang S.S. Grosse F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20483-20490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Zhang S. Grosse F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3906-3912Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Originally, RHA was identified as a human homologue of the Drosophila MLE protein (5Lee C.G. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16822-16830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent experimental data reveal that RHA is a multifunctional protein involved in many nuclear events including transcriptional regulation. For example, RHA mediates interaction between the general coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300 and RNA polymerase II (Pol II), which activates a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter construct containing the cAMP-responsive element via CREB (6Nakajima T. Uchida C. Anderson S.F. Lee C.G. Hurwitz J. Parvin J.D. Montminy M. Cell. 1997; 90: 1107-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). RHA is also known to enhance the expression of a CREB-dependent gene by interaction with a methyl-CpG binding domain protein, MBD2a (7Fujita H. Fujii R. Aratani S. Amano T. Fukamizu A. Nakajima T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2645-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the breast cancer-specific tumor suppressor protein (BRCA1) is recruited to Pol II by RHA (8Anderson S.F. Schlegel B.P. Nakajima T. Wolpin E.S. Parvin J.D. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 254-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), enabling BRCA1 to act as a transcriptional coactivator. In addition to functioning as a bridging factor between transcription factors, RHA is shown to bind directly to a DNA sequence in the promoter of the p16INK4a gene, leading to an increase in the promoter activity (9Myohanen S. Baylin S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1634-1642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Another recent study demonstrates an intriguing finding that RHA interacts with double-stranded (ds) DNA and topoisomerase IIα, indicating the involvement of RHA in the regulation of chromatin structure (10Zhou K. Choe K.T. Zaidi Z. Wang Q. Mathews M.B. Lee C.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2253-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Certain types of cancers, including some of the acute myelogenous leukemia, display intrinsic resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic drugs. Many other cancers acquire multidrug resistance (MDR) during chemotherapy. This has been a major clinical obstacle for successful treatment of cancer patients. MDR is frequently associated with overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a Mr 170,000 ATP-dependent transmembrane protein encoded by the MDR1 gene. P-gp is capable of pumping a number of structurally unrelated compounds out of the cell by utilizing the energy of ATP hydrolysis (11Safa A.R. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 289-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 12Fairchild C.R. Moscow J.A. O'Brien E.E. Cowan K.H. Mol.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7468-7485Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar), which results in a decrease in the intracellular accumulation of the compounds and resistance to drug cytotoxicity. P-gp is also expressed normally in epithelial cells of the liver, kidney, and small and large intestine and capillary endothelial cells in the brain, ovary, and testis, where it acts as a barrier to the uptake of xenobiotics and promotes their excretion (15Ambudkar S.V. Kimchi-Sarfaty C. Sauna Z.E. Gottesman M.M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7468-7485Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar).

In addition to its efflux pump activity, P-gp has been shown to have anti-apoptotic function via inhibition of drug-, Fas-, tumor necrosis factor-, or UV irradiation-mediated activation of caspase pathways (19Smyth M.J.

This work reinforces the importance of inhibition of MDR1 gene expression in circumventing MDR and eventually eliminating tumor cells. Detailed mechanisms regulating P-gp overexpression are not well understood; however, studies on transcriptional regulation of the human MDR1 gene reveal a complex pattern. The promoter of MDR1 gene contains a number of cis-elements for binding of transcription factors, including SP1, EGR1, and NF-Y (24Labialle S. Gayet L. Marthinet E. Rigal D. Baggetto L.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 943-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has shown that nuclear factor κB/p65 and c-fos transcription factors bind to the CAAT sequence in the promoter region, exerting a negative regulatory effect on sensitive MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, but not on their resistant counterparts (25Ogretmen B. Safa A.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that a nuclear protein, the MDR1 promoter-enhancing factor (MEF1), binds a region from nucleotide –118 to –111, which results in up-regulation of the MDR1 gene (26Ogretmen B. Safa A.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 194-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A 23-base region from nucleotide –123 to –100 including the sequence we described above is suggested to be important for the regulation of the MDR1 gene (24Labialle S. Gayet L. Marthinet E. Rigal D. Baggetto L.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 943-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This short region of the promoter bears several closely located or overlapping binding elements, which provide a potentially cooperative or competitive mechanism for transcription factor action. This organization of cis-elements may also provide an opportunity for construction of multiprotein complex containing DNA-binding factors and cofactors. Although many of the proteins bound to this region of the MDR1 promoter remain to be characterized, the cis-elements in the region have clearly been shown to functionally control the transcription activity of the MDR1 promoter (24Labialle S. Gayet L. Marthinet E. Rigal D. Baggetto L.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 943-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report that RHA is a component of a multiprotein complex that interacts with the –118/–111 sequence, designated as a CAAT-like motif (26Ogretmen B. Safa A.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 194-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), in the MDR1 promoter of a drug-resistant cell line derived from acute myelogenous leukemia cell line HL-60 that is drug sensitive. We demonstrate that RHA is involved in up-regulation of the MDR1 expression in drug-resistant but not drug-sensitive cells. Cell Lines, Plasmids, Antibodies, and Oligonucleotides—The HL-60 human acute myelogenous leukemia cell line, its MDR1-mediated multidrug-resistant derivative HL-60/Vinc, and the derivative of the HL-60/Vinc cell line, HL-60/VCR, which expresses high levels of P-gp, have been described previously (26Ogretmen B. Safa A.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 194-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To maintain the MDR phenotype, HL-60/VCR and HL-60/Vinc cells were cultured in medium containing 1 and 0.1 μg/ml vincristine (VCR), respectively. The MDR1 promoter –198/+43-firefly luciferase reporter plasmid construct, pMDR1-luc (previously referred to as pGL3-B/wt-MDR1), was as described previously (26Ogretmen B. Safa A.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 194-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The FLAG-tagged RHA expression vector, pcDNA3-FLAG-RHA, was kindly supplied by Dr. Chee-Gun Lee (University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Newark, NJ). Antibodies were obtained from the following sources: RHA rabbit polyclonal antibody was commercially raised by US Biological against amino acid residues 585–599 of RHA protein (GenBank™ accession number NP_001348); RHA rabbit polyclonal antibody against full-length RHA was supplied by Dr. Chee-Gun Lee and is referred to hereafter as anti-(full-length)-RHA; anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody was obtained from Sigma; and P-gp rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised in our laboratory against amino acid residues 910–924 of P-gp (GenBank™ accession number NP_000918). Double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized and annealed by Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX). The sequences of oligonucleotides (sense strand) are as follows: CAAT-like oligonucleotide, ATCAGCATTCAGTCAATCCGGGCC (nucleotides –129 to –106 relative to the transcription start site of the MDR1 gene; the CAAT-like motif is in bold); CAAT-deleted oligonucleotide, ATCAGCATTCAGTCCGGGCC; GC-box-like oligonucleotide, GGAACAGCGCCGGGGCGTGGGCTGA; and nonspecific oligonucleotide, GAAGCCTGAGCTCATTCGAGTAGC. RHA short interfering RNA (siRNA) duplex targeting 5′-AAGAAGTGCAAGCGACTCTAG-3′ (nucleotides +544 to +564) of the RHA gene (GenBank™ accession number NM_001357) and control siRNA 5′-AAAGTCATCGTGACTACGACG-3′ were synthesized and annealed by Qiagen-Xeragon (Germantown, MD). A BLAST search was performed to ensure RHA siRNA would not target other genes. The control siRNA was designed by a random selection of nucleotides and was not against any gene sequence by BLAST search. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—The nuclear extracts from HL-60/VCR cells were prepared essentially as described previously (26Ogretmen B. Safa A.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 194-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (∼109) were harvested with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 5 packed cell volumes of buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 2 mm MgCl2, 15 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), incubated on ice for 10 min, and pelleted by centrifugation. The swollen cells were placed in 3 packed cell volumes of buffer A and lysed in a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was checked microscopically for cell lysis. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 4 packed nuclear volumes of buffer A, and 4 m ammonium sulfate was then added to give a final concentration of 0.3 m. After incubation at 4 °C for 30 min with constant rotation, the suspension was spun at 50,000 × g at 4 °C for 60 min, and nuclear proteins in the supernatant were precipitated by addition of ammonium sulfate powder to a final concentration of 0.2 g/ml. Precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation at 50,000 × g, and the pellet was dissolved in 2 ml of buffer C (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol) and dialyzed against buffer C (500× volumes) at 4 °C. The dialysate was cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g. Concentration of the nuclear protein was determined by the method of Bradford. DNA-Affinity Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry—The DNA-affinity chromatography was performed as described previously (26Ogretmen B. Safa A.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 194-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), with small modifications. Nuclear proteins (20 mg) extracted from HL-60/VCR cells were cleared using Microcon YM-50 filter (Millipore) and preincubated at room temperature for 15 min with a 20-fold molar excess of ds CAAT-deleted and GC-box-like oligonucleotides in 1.8 ml of binding buffer (40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 40 mm KCl, 8% glycerol, 0.64 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.8 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA) containing 28 μg of poly(dI-dC)·(dI-dC) to remove nonspecific DNA-binding proteins. After addition of the 24-bp ds CAAT-like oligonucleotide (250 μg) coupled to the cyanogen bromide (CNBr)-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences), incubation was continued for an additional 60 min at room temperature with rotation. The resinnuclear protein mixture was then transferred to a Bio-Rad Poly-Prep Chromatography Column (0.8 × 4 cm), followed by extensive wash with the binding buffer to remove unbound proteins. Bound proteins were eluted with 1× SDS sample loading buffer at 95 °C, concentrated with the Microcon YM-50 filter, and subjected to SDS-5–15% PAGE. After electrophoretic separation, bands were visualized by silver staining with a Silver Stain Plus kit (Bio-Rad), excised, and in-gel-digested with trypsin. Protein identification was performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) at the Indiana University School of Medicine Proteomics Core Facility, which is supported by the Indiana Genomic Initiative. The masses of the tryptic peptides were used to search for protein candidates using the ProFound online search engine. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear proteins (8 μg) were preincubated in the binding buffer plus 1.5 μg of poly(dI-dC)·(dI-dC) with or without a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor ds oligonucleotides or anti-(full-length)-RHA at room temperature for 45 min. The [γ-32P]ATP-labeled ds CAAT-like oligonucleotide probe was added, and the incubation was continued for 20 min. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel at 10 °C controlled by the Isotemp 3016 Refrigerated Circulator (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Western Blotting—Cells were harvested and lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Equal microgram amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-7.5% PAGE and then transferred onto Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Membranes were incubated with the indicated antibodies. Secondary antibodies were either anti-mouse Ig or anti-rabbit Ig conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoreactive protein bands were visualized by using the ECL kit (Pierce). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—HL-60/Vinc cells (2 × 106 cells in 1.2 ml of normal growth medium) were seeded in a 12-well plate. Twenty-four h later, the cells were cross-linked with formaldehyde (final concentration, 1% (v/v)) for 15 min at room temperature followed by a 15-min treatment with 125 mm glycine to quench cross-linking. The soluble chromatin was prepared by using the ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). In brief, the cross-linked cells were lysed in SDS lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and sonicated (six times; 10 s each; 40% of maximum power) using a 130-watt model Cole Parma Ultrasonicator equipped with a cup horn that was pre-cooled by filling with ice water. The sonication resulted in DNA fragment sizes of 0.2–1.3 kb as analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide gels. Part (∼1%) of the whole cell lysate was taken as input chromatin for PCR analyses. The rest was precleared with salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose beads. The supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-RHA or anti-(full-length)-RHA at 1:100 dilutions. Preimmune serum, normal rabbit serum, or anti-Bax was used as negative control. The chromatin-antibody complex was collected through incubation with the agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifugation. The beads were washed and eluted with buffers as specified by the manufacturer (Upstate Biotechnology). The eluted chromatin and the input chromatin were incubated at 65 °C for 4 h to reverse the cross-links, followed by proteinase K digestion at 45 °C for 1 h. DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The purified DNA fragments were used as templates for PCR amplification to analyze the protein occupancy of the MDR1 promoter. The PCR primers spanning the –198/+43 (241 bp) region in the promoter of the MDR1 gene (GenBank™ accession number L07624) were as follows: 5′-CTAGAGAGGTGCAACGGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCGGCCTCTGCTTCTTTGA-3′ (reverse). PCR conditions were 1 cycle of 5 min at 94 °C for initial denaturation; 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 58 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C; and a final extension for 7 min at 72 °C. PCR products were separated by 8% PAGE and visualized with ethidium bromide. Dual Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay—HL-60/Vinc or HL-60 cells (2 × 106) were transiently transfected with 2 μg of pMDR1-luc, 0.03 μg of pRL-SV40 Vector (Promega), and 2 μg of expression vector pcDNA3-FLAG-RHA or empty vector pcDNA3 in 1 ml of serum-free medium in a 6-well plate using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). The pRL-SV40 vector contains the Renilla luciferase gene driven by the early SV40 enhancer/promoter, used as an internal control for transfection efficiency, and the promoter-less pGL3-Basic vector was used as a negative control. The pcDNA3 vector was used to keep the amount of DNA constant in each transfection mixture. The ratio of FuGENE 6 to DNA was 3:1. The cell/DNA mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 7 h and then supplemented with 4 ml of normal growth medium. The cells were cultured for an additional 40 h and harvested. Cell lysates were prepared, and the luciferase activity was measured with a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) in a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). Transfections were performed in triplicate three times. Firefly luciferase light units were normalized against Renilla luciferase and expressed as the mean ± S.D. Introduction of RHA Expression Vector or siRNA into Cells by Electroporation—HL-60/Vinc cells (1 × 106) suspended in 200 μl of serum-free medium were mixed with 4 μg of either pcDNA3 (empty vector) or pcDNA3-FLAG-RHA expression plasmid and electroporated in the Gene Pulser Xcell System (Bio-Rad) using the pre-set protocol for HL-60 cells. The cells were immediately transferred to a 12-well plate with 1.0 ml of normal growth medium and cultured for 7, 24, and 48 h, respectively. At the indicated time after electroporation, total RNA was isolated using TRI REAGENT (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH), and cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). The PCR conditions were the same as those for amplification of the MDR1 promoter described in ChIP assay, except that 25 cycles were performed. Primer sequences for reverse transcription-PCR were 5′-TGCTGAACATGATCCGTCAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAACTCTGGAGGAGACTACA-3′ (reverse), which spans the +3469/+3777 region (309 bp) of the RHA gene. The reverse transcription-PCR products were resolved by 8% PAGE and visualized with ethidium bromide staining. For siRNA transfection, 10 μg of RHA siRNA or the control siRNA were introduced into HL-60/Vinc cells with the electroporation procedure. The transfection was repeated after 24 h, and cells were cultured for another 24 h. The transfected cells were then harvested, and the whole cell lysates were used for Western blotting. For stable expression of the exogenous RHA gene, transfected HL-60/Vinc or HL-60 cells were selected with 800 μg/ml G418 for 2 weeks, and the transfectants were used for Western blotting and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Cell Survival (MTT) Assay—Untransfected or stably transfected HL-60 or HL-60/Vinc cells (1.5 × 104) suspended in 100 μl of growth medium were seeded in a 96-well plate. VCR was added at the indicated concentrations, and the cells were cultured for 72 h. At the end of treatment, 25 μl (5 mg/ml) of MTT was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for an additional 4 h. MTT-formazan products were solubilized with acidic isopropanol, and absorbance of each well was determined on a microplate reader at 570 nm. RHA Is a Component of MEF1 Complex That Interacts with the CAAT-like Motif—Our laboratory has previously identified a novel cis-acting element, CAAT-like, in the proximal promoter of the MDR1 gene and characterized a nuclear protein, MEF1, present in the multidrug-resistant HL-60/VCR cells (but not in the drug-sensitive HL-60 cells) that specifically binds to the CAAT-like sequence. Increased luciferase expression was observed by transient transfection of the wild-type MDR1 promoter/luciferase reporter construct, but not the construct with a deletion in the CAAT sequence. The CAAT-like motif behaves like an enhancer, as when it was cloned upstream of the SV40 promoter in the pGL3-Promoter Vector, a 7-fold increase in luciferase activity was also observed (26Ogretmen B. Safa A.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 194-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the notion that enhancers increase transcription in a manner that is independent of their orientation and distance relative to the transcription start site (27Khoury G. Gruss P. Cell. 1983; 33: 313-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). To help define the mechanism of MEF1 action, we sought to identify the proteins that interact with the CAAT-like region and/or MEF1 in HL-60/VCR nuclear extracts. We used a DNA-affinity chromatography procedure similar to that used previously to isolate MEF1 (26Ogretmen B. Safa A.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 194-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), except that bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample loading buffer, which allowed us to obtain eight major bands of polypeptides bound to the ds CAAT-like oligonucleotide as visualized by silver staining (Fig. 1, inset). All the bands were subjected to peptide mass fingerprinting by MALDI-TOF MS. The resulting peptide masses were searched against predicted tryptic peptide masses for all the proteins contained within the National Center for Biotechnology Information protein database using the ProFound online search engine (prowl.rockefeller.edu). Identification was considered positive if the top-ranked candidate had a Z score of 2.0 or above and a probability score of 1.0 and the next protein candidate had a significantly lower probability (28Zhang W. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 2482-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Based on these criteria, five of the eight proteins are positively identified (data not shown). One of the positively identified proteins (indicated by an arrowhead in the inset of Fig. 1) was analyzed in this study, and the rest are under investigation. Fig. 1 shows the MALDI-TOF spectrum of this protein. One hundred monoisotopic masses derived from Fig. 1 were submitted to ProFound. Twenty-one of the top 100 submitted peptide masses matched human RHA (Z score = 2.33) within 50 p.p.m. with 20% coverage. The probability (1.0) is ∼1024 higher than the next candidate. To confirm that RHA is present in the MEF1 complex interacting with the CAAT-like oligonucleotide, we performed EMSA by incubating nuclear extracts of HL-60/VCR cells with the radiolabeled CAAT-like oligonucleotide probe. A DNA-protein complex was detected (Fig. 2, lane 2). The complex was competed by the cold CAAT-like oligonucleotide (lane 3), but not by the mutant (deleted in the CAAT sequence) (lane 4) or unrelated oligonucleotides (lane 5), suggesting that the complex is specifically interacting with the CAAT-like element of the MDR1 gene. The polyclonal antibody against full-length RHA almost completely disrupted the formation of the DNA-protein complex, whereas it had no effect on the nonspecific (NS) band (Fig. 2, lane 6). Normal rabbit serum was used as a negative control, which could not disrupt the complex formation. These results demonstrate that RHA is a component of the MEF1 complex. To determine whether RHA binds directly to the CAAT-like element, we used the in vitro-translated RHA instead of nuclear protein extracts in EMSA, which showed no specific DNA-protein complex formed (results not shown), indicating that RHA may bind indirectly to the element. Different Isoforms of RHA Exist in Drug-sensitive and -resistant Cells—Because RHA was isolated from the highly drug-resistant HL-60/VCR cell line, we asked wheth"
https://openalex.org/W2025462337,"The interactions between Notch (N) receptors and their transmembrane ligands, Jagged1 (JI) and Delta1 (Dl1), mediate signaling events between neighboring cells that are crucial during embryonal development and in adults. Since the non-transmembrane extracellular form of J1 acts as an antagonist of N activation in NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblast cells and induces fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1)-dependent transformation (Small, D., Kovalenko, D., Soldi, R., Mandinova, A., Kolev, V., Trifonova, R., Bagala, C., Kacer, D., Battelli, C., Liaw, L., Prudovsky, I., and Maciag, T. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 16405–16413), we examined the potential redundant functions of the two subfamilies of Notch ligands and report that while the soluble (s) forms of both Dl1 and J1 act as N signaling antagonists in NIH 3T3 cells, they do display disparate functions. While sJ1 induced an attenuation of cell motility which is accompanied by a decrease in actin stress fibers and an increase in adherence junctions, sDl1 does not. However, sJ1, like sDl1, induces a NIH 3T3 cell tranformed phenotype mediated by FGF signaling. Because the inhibition of N signaling by sJ1 and sDl1 is rescued by dominant-negative Src expression, we suggest that there may be cooperation between the Notch and Src signaling pathways.

The Notch gene family encodes evolutionarily conserved cell surface receptors that initiate signaling between neighboring cells in multicellular organisms (1Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Google Scholar). Notch signaling plays a role in cell fate determination through the regulation of cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and apoptosis (2Jeffries S. Capobianco A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3928-3941Google Scholar). Aberrant Notch signaling is associated with developmental defects (3Xue Y. Gao X. Lindsell C.E. Norton C.R. Chang B. Hicks C. Gendron-Maguire M. Rand E.B. Weinmaster G. Gridley T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 723-730Google Scholar) and pathologic conditions in adults (4Joutel A. Tournier-Lasserve E. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 619-625Google Scholar). The Notch receptors and their ligands are single-pass transmembrane proteins with conserved protein structures (5Lardelli M. Dahlstrand J. Lendahl U. Mech. Dev. 1994; 46: 123-136Google Scholar). The ligands for the Notch receptors have traditionally been divided into two subclasses, Delta-like and Serrate-like, defined by the absence and presence, respectively, of an additional cysteine-rich domain in the extracellular portion of the polypeptide (6Weinmaster G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 436-442Google Scholar, 7Zimrin A.B. Pepper M.S. McMahon G.A. Nguyen F. Montesano R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32499-32502Google Scholar). The mechanism of Notch receptor signaling has been extensively studied and involves the activation of CSL (for CBF1 in mammals, Supressor of Hairless (Su(H)) in Drosophila and Xenopus and Lag-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans)-dependent transcription mediated by the nuclear translocation of the intracellular domain of Notch (8Jarriault S. Brou C. Logeat F. Schroeter E.H. Kopan R. Israel A. Nature. 1995; 377: 355-358Google Scholar). Notch displaces corepressors on CSL changing its function from a repressor into an activator for genes including the Hairy Enhancer of Split and Hairy Enhancer of Split-Related Protein families (9Zhou S. Fujimuro M. Hsieh J.J. Chen L. Miyamoto A. Weinmaster G. Hayward S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2400-2410Google Scholar). However, recent evidence also suggests that Notch signaling may proceed in a CSL-independent manner including pathways utilizing the cytoplasmic protein, Deltex (10Small D. Kovalenko D. Kacer D.

Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 1689-1702Google Scholar). The existence of soluble forms of Notch ligands including the extracellular portion of Delta in Drosophila and other organisms have been reported but their physiological roles have not been determined (11Nofziger D.

Transcripts encoding the extracellular domain of the Jagged1 ligand have also been detected in human endothelial cells (7Zimrin A.B. Pepper M.S. McMahon G.A. Nguyen F. Montesano R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32499-32502Google Scholar). There is evidence that the Delta ligand can be proteolytically cleaved by Kuzbanian, a member of the ADAM family metalloproteases, to generate a soluble extracellular form (18Qi H. Rand M.D. Wu X. Sestan N. Wang W. Rakic P. Xu T. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Science. 1999; 283: 91-94Google Scholar), and recent data also suggest that the Notch ligands may be processed by the γ-secretase presenilin in a manner similar to the Notch receptor (19Ikeuchi T. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7751-7754Google Scholar). While studies have suggested that the soluble forms of the Notch ligands are able to activate Notch receptors (14Han W. Ye Q. Moore M.A. Blood. 2000; 95: 1616-1625Google Scholar, 18Qi H. Rand M.D. Wu X. Sestan N. Wang W. Rakic P. Xu T. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Science. 1999; 283: 91-94Google Scholar, 20Li L. Milner L.A.

Likewise, the expression of a non-transmembrane form of the Notch ligand, Jagged1 (sJ1) also antagonizes Notch signaling in NIH 3T3 cells and induces significant changes in their cellular phenotype including FGFR1 1The abbreviations used are: FGF, fibroblast growth factor; FGFR, FGF receptor; dn, dominant-negative; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; BCS, bovine calf serum. -dependent transformation (10Small D.

Thus, to determine whether the secreted form of the Delta1 ligand would generate effects exhibited by the non-transmembrane form of Jagged1, we investigated the phenotypic characteristics of NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with the soluble form of the Delta1 (sDl1) ligand. Cell Lines and Cell Culture—Soluble Dl1 expressing stable cell lines were created by transfecting mouse fibroblast NIH 3T3 cells with pcDNA3.1(+), in which the DNA sequence encoding the human Dl1 extracellular domain was inserted in-frame with a Myc His tag (14Han W. Ye Q. Moore M.A. Blood. 2000; 95: 1616-1625Google Scholar) and the positive clones selected by Geneticin resistance as described previously (10Small D. Kovalenko D. Kacer D. Liaw L. Landriscina M. Di Serio C. Prudovsky I. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32022-32030Google Scholar). The stable sJ1 and the dn-Src NIH 3T3 cell transfectants as well as the cell culture conditions to grow and maintain these transfectants were described previously (10Small D. Kovalenko D. Kacer D. Liaw L. Landriscina M. Di Serio C. Prudovsky I. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32022-32030Google Scholar). Experiments were performed with multiple sDl1 NIH 3T3 cell clones and we observed no significant differences between clones expressing either high or low levels of the sDl1 protein. Cell Migration Assay—Approximately 105 sJ1 or sDl1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants were plated in DMEM supplemented with 10% (w/v) bovine calf serum (BCS; Hyclone), and after the cells reached ∼60–70% confluence, the cell monolayer was scratched using a plastic cell scraper. Photomicrographs were taken immediately after the injury and 24 and 48 h later. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were plated on glass coverslips and fixed with 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde. Actin stress fibers were visualized by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma), a monoclonal anti-vinculin antibody (Sigma) was used to visualize focal adhesion sites, and a monoclonal anti-β-catenin antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories) and a monoclonal anti-pan-cadherin antibody (Sigma) were both used to visualize cell-cell adhesions as described previously (10Small D.

Immunoblot Analysis—Cell lysates from insert-less vector sDl1 and sJ1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants were prepared and immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (10Small D. Kovalenko D.

Anchorage-dependent and -independent Cell Growth Assays—Approximately 3 × 104 cells were plated on fibronectin (10 μg/cm2)-coated in 12-well cell culture dishes (Falcon) in DMEM containing 10% BCS (v/v) (Hyclone). Three wells of the individual NIH 3T3 cell transfectants were harvested every third day and cell number was quantitated using a hemocytometer. Anchorage-independent cell growth was evaluated as described previously (24Small D. Kovalenko D. Soldi R. Mandinova A. Kolev V. Trifonova R. Bagala C. Kacer D. Battelli C. Liaw L. Prudovsky I.

Gene Juice (Novagen) was used as a transfection reagent. Some of the samples also contained 200 ng of a DNA construct encoding the truncated intracellular constitutively active form of Notch1 (N1IC) (10Small D. Kovalenko D. Kacer D. Liaw L. Landriscina M. Di Serio C. Prudovsky I. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32022-32030Google Scholar). In addition, 500 ng of a constitutively active Src kinase construct, encoding a mutant form of Xenopus laevis Src in which tyrosine 526 was replaced by phenylalanine cloned into the pcDNA3.1+ hygromycin vector was also added to certain samples. Individual assays were performed in triplicate, and the luciferase/Renilla activity was measured using Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) 48 h following the transient transfection. We have previously demonstrated that the expression of a soluble form of Jagged1 (sJ1) induced significant changes in the phenotype of NIH 3T3 cells including the onset of a FGFR1-dependent phenotype with impaired cell motility, associated with reduced actin stress fibers and focal adhesion sites formation (24Small D. Kovalenko D. Soldi R. Mandinova A. Kolev V. Trifonova R. Bagala C. Kacer D. Battelli C. Liaw L. Prudovsky I. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16405-16413Google Scholar). To determine whether these events were sJ1-specific, we examined the phenotype of NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with soluble extracellular domain of Delta1 (sDl1). Interestingly, although the stable sDl1 and sJ1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants shared some characteristics, there were significant differences between them; the most striking being their migratory behavior. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 1A, the sDl1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants displayed normal motility, while the sJ1 cells exhibited a decrease in their migratory potential. Since cell motility is dependent on F-actin stress fiber formation as well as cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesions, we examined the sDl1 and sJ1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants for these cellular features. While we observed normal levels of F-actin stress fibers and focal adhesion sites in the sDl1 NIH cell transfectants, the sJ1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants exhibited significantly reduced actin stress fibers and focal adhesion sites (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 1B, the sDl1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants did not display an increase in cell-cell adherence junctions, as revealed by β-catenin and pan-cadherin immunofluorescent staining, which was prominently exhibited in the sJ1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants (Fig. 1B). These data suggest that the sDl1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants exhibited cellular architectural properties consistent with a normal motility phenotype, whereas the sJ1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants did not. To further study the differences in the organization of the F-actin cytoskeleton in the sDl1 and sJ1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants, we compared the levels of the activated form of Src and its substrate cortactin, which is known to play a role in the organization of the cortical actin network and F-actin stress fibers (26Weed S.A. Karginov A.V. Schafer D.A. Weaver A.M. Kinley A.W. Cooper J.A. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 29-40Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, we observed a decrease in the level of tyrosine-phosphorylated cortactin in sDl1 NIH 3T3 transfectants that contrasted with the increased level observed in the sJ1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants. Since the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin exhibits low affinity for F-actin, which results in an attenuation of F-actin filament bundling, this observation is consistent with the appearance of F-actin stress fibers in the sDl1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants and a reduction in the appearance of F-actin stress fibers in the sJ1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants (Fig. 1B). However, because the sDl1 and sJ1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants both exhibited an increase in the level of active Src (Fig. 2), it may be possible that the differential phosphorylation of cortactin in these transfectants may be related to the ability of the sDl1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants to uncouple the association between Src and cortactin. While it is known that sJ1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants enable Src to associate with cortactin (10Small D. Kovalenko D. Kacer D. Liaw L. Landriscina M. Di Serio C. Prudovsky I. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32022-32030Google Scholar), cortactin immunoprecipitation followed by either Src or phosphotyrosine immunoblot analysis failed to resolve Src from cell lysates derived from the sDl1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants (data not shown). Despite the differences in the migratory behavior, F-actin cytoskeleton organization and the abundance of focal adhesion sites between the sDl1 and sJ1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants, these cells did exhibit a variety of common characteristics including accelerated proliferation at high cell density and anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. Growth kinetics of both sDl1 and sJ1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants revealed impaired contact inhibition of growth as compared with the insert-less vector control transfectants (Fig. 3A). In addition, the sDl1 and sJ1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants were also able to grow in an anchorage-independent manner and form colonies in soft agar (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, the size but not the number of colonies was significantly exaggerated upon the addition of exogenous FGF1, suggesting a synergy between FGF1 and the soluble forms of the Notch ligands. The accelerated proliferation at high cell density of both sDl1 and sJ1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants may be attributed to the function of Src, since expression of a dnSrc construct in both the sDl1 and sJ1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants restored contact inhibition of cell growth (Fig. 3A). In contrast, however, the anchorage-independent growth of both the sDl1 and sJ1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants appeared to be independent of the function of Src, since the sDl1/dnSrc and sJ1/dnSrc NIH 3T3 cell co-transfectants still formed colonies in soft agar (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that the non-transmembrane forms of the Notch ligands, Jagged1 and Delta1, utilize similar pathways to regulate NIH 3T3 anchorage-dependent and independent cell growth. Because the NIH 3T3 cell responds to sJ1 as a repressor of CSL-dependent Notch signaling (10Small D. Kovalenko D. Kacer D. Liaw L. Landriscina M. Di Serio C. Prudovsky I. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32022-32030Google Scholar, 24Small D. Kovalenko D. Soldi R. Mandinova A. Kolev V. Trifonova R. Bagala C. Kacer D. Battelli C. Liaw L. Prudovsky I. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16405-16413Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether sDl1 was also able to modify CSL-dependent signaling in the NIH 3T3 cell and whether the expression of dnSrc rescued this response. As shown in Fig. 4, we observed that like sJ1, the expression of sDl1 also inhibited the transactivation of the CBF1-responsive promoter in both NIH 3T3 cells and NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with the constitutively active intracellular domain of Notch (N1IC). Interestingly, the expression of dnSrc in either the N1IC background or in wild type NIH 3T3 cells rescued the repression of CSL-dependent transcription by both sJ1 and sDl1 (Fig. 4). These data suggest that Src may be a component of the signaling pathway utilized by both sJ1 and sDl1 to repress N1IC-dependent transcription, and this is consistent with the exaggerated levels of functional Src observed in both the sJ1 and sDl1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants (Fig. 2). Indeed, this is to our knowledge the first evidence suggesting an association and/or cross-talk between CSL-mediated Notch signaling and Src. Although the mechanism responsible for this event remains to be determined, it is possible that Src may interfere with the formation of the CSL·Notch1 intracellular domain complex. Because expression of a constitutively active Src mutant in NIH 3T3 cells also results in the repression of CSL-dependent Notch signaling, yet the expression of dnSrc in the NIH 3T3 cell activates CSL-dependent Notch signaling (Fig. 4), it is likely that the activation of Src by either sJ1 or sDl1 may establish a negative loop between active Src and a component of the Notch signaling pathway. It is noteworthy that while CSL transactivation is rescued in the sDl1/dnSrc and sJ1/dnSrc NIH 3T3 cell co-transfectants, these cells remain able to form colonies in soft agar. This observation suggests that the anchorage-independent growth of the sDl1 and sJ1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants is not only Src-independent but also CSL-independent. While the constitutive, non-stress-dependent FGF1 release pathway is functional in the sDl1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants, analysis by reverse transcription-PCR suggests that sDl1, unlike sJ1 (24Small D. Kovalenko D. Soldi R. Mandinova A. Kolev V. Trifonova R. Bagala C. Kacer D. Battelli C. Liaw L. Prudovsky I. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16405-16413Google Scholar), is unable to induce the expression of the FGF1 transcript (data not shown). However, while the FGF1, FGF3, FGF4, and FGF5 transcripts are induced by the expression of sJ1 in NIH 3T3 cells (24Small D. Kovalenko D. Soldi R. Mandinova A. Kolev V. Trifonova R. Bagala C. Kacer D. Battelli C. Liaw L. Prudovsky I. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16405-16413Google Scholar), sDl1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants did not exhibit the presence of the FGF1 and FGF5 transcripts; rather, the sDl1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants express the FGF3, FGF4, and FGF9 transcripts (data not shown). Since FGFR1 signaling is able to activate Src in NIH 3T3 cells (27Garfinkel S. Hu X. Prudovsky I.A. McMahon G.A. Kapnik E.M. McDowell S.D. Maciag T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 783-791Google Scholar), it is possible that FGF4- and/or FGF9-mediated FGFR1 signaling may not only be involved in the activation of Src in the sDl1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants but may also enable the sDl1 and dnSrc NIH 3T3 cell co-transfectants to survive and grow, albeit at a reduced level, both as monolayer and in soft agar in vitro (Fig. 3, A and B). This premise is supported by the observation that the anchorage-independent growth of the sDl1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants (Fig. 3B) was completely inhibited by the addition of the FGFR1-specific inhibitor, PD166866 (data not shown). While these data suggest that sDl1 and sJ1 modify similar growth-related phenotypes in the NIH 3T3 cells, the expression of these soluble Notch ligands do exhibit disparate phenotypic characteristics most notably in the regulation of cell migration in vitro. These differences could be due to differential interactions with the Notch receptors, since Jagged1, but not Delta1, contains both an additional cysteine-rich motif and a higher number of epidermal growth factor-like repeats within the extracellular domain (6Weinmaster G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 436-442Google Scholar). It is also possible that these differences may be due to other factors such as the function of the glycosyltransferase Fringe (28Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y. Stanley P. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. Vogt T.F. Nature. 2000; 406: 369-375Google Scholar), which may influence ligand binding. In addition, since the NIH 3T3 cells express only the Notch1 and Notch2 transcripts (data not shown), the soluble forms of the Delta1 and Jagged1 may be able to either antagonize different Notch receptors with different affinity or perhaps interfere with the activation of the Notch receptors with a different efficiency even though both are able to repress CSL-dependent signaling to a similar extent. However, because we did not observe differences between multiple stable sDl1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants expressing different levels of sDl1, it is unlikely that the differences between the expression levels of sDl1 and sJ1 account for these disparate behaviors. There is also evidence suggesting that Notch receptor-ligand interactions may trigger bi-directional signaling (29Bland C.E. Kimberly P. Rand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13607-13610Google Scholar, 30Ascano J.M. Beverly L.J. Capobianco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8771-8779Google Scholar). Indeed, the intracellular portion of the Jagged1 transmembrane protein does contain a PDZ-domain, which may be able to mediate interactions with other signaling systems regulated by SH2 domain-containing proteins (30Ascano J.M. Beverly L.J. Capobianco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8771-8779Google Scholar) such as Src. Since Jagged1, but not Delta1, is expressed endogenously in NIH 3T3 cells, it is intriguing to suggest that the differences in NIH 3T3 cell migratory behavior exhibited by the expression of sJ1 and sDl1 may be the result of the ability of sDl1 to modify a Jagged1-dependent, PDZ domain-regulated signal.

Whereas histamine increases the permeability of capillary and venular endothelium, its effect on the integrity of arteriolar endothelium is unknown. We tested whether histamine could inhibit conducted vasodilation. In second-order arterioles (2A) supplying the cremaster muscle of C57BL6, PECAM-1-/-, and eNOS-/- mice (8-12 wk), neither resting (16+/-2 microm) nor maximal (38+/-2 microm) diameters were different. Acetylcholine (ACh) microiontophoresis (1 microA, 500 ms pulse) triggered vasodilation that was conducted >1400 microm along arterioles. Neither local (14+/-2 microm) nor conducted vasodilation (10+/-2 microm) was different among mice. Histamine (5 microM) had no effect on resting diameter or local vasodilation to ACh yet inhibited conduction by >50% in C57BL6 and PECAM-1-/- mice (P<0.05); this effect was abolished after blockade of NO synthase or of soluble guanylate cyclase. Washout of histamine restored conduction, though recovery was longer (P<0.05) in PECAM-1-/- mice vs. C57BL6 mice. Remarkably, conducted vasodilation in eNOS-/- mice was insensitive to histamine. These findings indicate that histamine inhibits cell-to-cell coupling through an NO-dependent mechanism and suggests a dynamic interaction among intercellular adhesion molecules and gap junction channels along arteriolar endothelium."

It transfers a redox signal received from ferredoxin to thioredoxins (Trxs) by a unique mechanism involving a 4Fe-4S cluster and a disulfide bridge, thereby transforming the signal from an “electron signal” to a “thiol signal.” Trxs, the regulatory disulfide proteins, transmit this signal by dithiol-disulfide interchange reactions to certain enzymes, e.g. chloroplast fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (3Chueca A.

Most biochemical investigations have been done on the spinach enzyme, whereas the only three-dimensional structure was solved for the Synechocystis FTR (5Dai S. Schwendtmayer C. Schürmann P. Ramaswamy S. Eklund H. Science. 2000; 287: 655-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This enzyme shows no functional difference to the spinach protein but is significantly more stable (6Schwendtmayer C. Manieri W. Hirasawa M. Knaff D.B. Schürmann P. Garab G.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 549: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The FTR is an unusually thin molecule in the shape of a concave disk with only 10 Å across the center of the molecule where the Fe-S cluster and the redox-active disulfide are located (8Dai S. Schwendtmayer C. Johansson K. Ramaswamy S. Schürmann P. Eklund H. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2000; 33: 67-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It contains seven strictly conserved cysteine residues, six of them organized in two CPC and one CHC motifs. These six Cys constitute the redox-active disulfide bridge and ligate, in an unusual arrangement, the Fe-S cluster (9Chow L.-P. Iwadate H. Yano K. Kamo M. Tsugita A. Gardet-Salvi L. Stritt-Etter A.-L. Schürmann P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the Synechocystis FTR Cys-57 and Cys-87 form the active-site disulfide. The four remaining cysteines, Cys-55, Cys-74, Cys-76, and Cys-85, are ligands to the cluster. This arrangement positions the redox-active disulfide bridge adjacent to the cluster with Cys-57 exposed to the solvent on one side of the flat molecule, whereas Cys-87 is protected. The iron-sulfur center is closer to the opposite side of the thin molecule. It has been proposed that the two sides of the molecule represent, respectively, the ferredoxin and the Trx docking areas, enabling the FTR to interact simultaneously with electron donor and acceptor (8Dai S. Schwendtmayer C. Johansson K. Ramaswamy S. Schürmann P. Eklund H. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2000; 33: 67-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Based on spectroscopic measurements and on the structure a two-step reaction mechanism has been proposed for the reduction of Trx by FTR (8Dai S. Schwendtmayer C. Johansson K. Ramaswamy S. Schürmann P. Eklund H. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2000; 33: 67-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 10Staples C.R. Gaymard E. Stritt-Etter A.L. Telser J. Hoffman B.M. Schürmann P. Knaff D.B. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4612-4620Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The first electron, delivered by ferredoxin on the ferredoxin docking area and transmitted through the 4Fe-4S, cleaves the active-site disulfide producing a surface-exposed sulfhydryl (Cys-57) and a cysteine-based thiyl radical (Cys-87). This radical becomes stabilized by the covalent attachment of the cysteine to the cluster, forming an oxidized (3+) five-coordinate cluster. Cys-57 then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the disulfide bond of a Trx, forming a one-electron-reduced heterodisulfide intermediate. His-86 and Arg-58, which are very close to the disulfide bridge (3.9 and 5.6 Å, respectively), might increase the nucleophilicity of the cysteine. This first reaction anchors the Trx molecule through the heterodisulfide linkage to the Trx docking area. The ferredoxin docking area, on the opposite side, stays free for a second interaction with a reduced ferredoxin. The second electron reduces the cluster-ligated Cys-87 and reestablishes the original 2+ oxidation state of the cluster. The newly reduced internal Cys-87 attacks and cleaves the heterodisulfide linkage between FTR and Trx, thus liberating the reduced Trx. The closing of the active-site disulfide bridge completes the reaction cycle. Alkylation of the accessible cysteine of the active-site disulfide (Cys-57 in Synechocystis) with N-ethylmaleimide provided a stable analogue of the one-electron-reduced heterodisulfide intermediate (10Staples C.R.

This modification is accompanied by a typical change of the visible spectrum (12Schürmann P. Gardet-Salvi L. Chimia. 1993; 47: 245-246Google Scholar) because of the oxidation of the cluster from its 2+ state in the resting enzyme to the 3+ state in the analogue of the reaction intermediate. Recent spectroscopic analyses demonstrated that in the reaction intermediate Cys-87 is coordinated to the closest iron atom of the cluster (13Jameson G.N.L. Walters E.M. Manieri W. Schürmann P. Johnson M.K. Huynh B.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1146-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition there is partial bonding of the disulfide to this iron even in the resting state of the enzyme. This promotes charge buildup on this special iron making it an electron donor with increased ferrous character. The system is therefore primed and ready to accept an electron from ferredoxin to break the disulfide bond. The binding of an additional cysteine to the special iron, in the one-electron-reduced heterodisulfide intermediate, makes it more ferric, and the charge is drawn away from it. Thus Cys-87 appears to be a critical residue not only as a member of the disulfide bridge but also because it interacts with an iron atom of the cluster in the resting enzyme. In this study we have produced and characterized mutant FTRs, based on the Synechocystis protein, to obtain further information on the function of three important residues. We individually replaced the redox-active cysteines, Cys-57 by serine and Cys-87 by serine or alanine, as well as His-86, proposed to increase the nucleophilicity of the active site, by tyrosine. The choice of tyrosine was based on sequences of putative FTRs in two archaebacteria (14Klenk H.P. Clayton R.A. Tomb J.F. White O. Nelson K.E. Ketchum K.A. Dodson R.J. Gwinn M. Hickey E.K.

Our results confirm the functions attributed to the two active-site cysteines and provide evidence that His-86 indeed increases the reactivity of the FTR. In addition we have used the wild type (WT) as well as the mutant FTRs to study their interaction with ferredoxin and Trxs. We obtained non-covalent complexes with ferredoxin, covalent heterodimeric complexes with Trxs, representing the one-electron-reduced reaction intermediates, and triple complexes involving all three proteins confirming the protein-protein interactions postulated based on the structural analyses.

In a first amplification, using the primers C57S antisense, 5′-GTGGCGAGAGGGGCACA-3′, and T7 sense, 5′-AATACGACTCACTATAG-3′, a megaprimer was obtained containing the information for the variable and part of the catalytic subunit including the mutation. In a second amplification using the megaprimer and T7term antisense 5′-GCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGG-3′, the dicistronic construct was rebuilt and could be inserted into the pET-3c expression plasmid. All sequences and mutations were checked by automatic sequencing using either the T7 or T7term primers and the sequencing kit from Amersham Biosciences on a MWG LICOR sequencer. Protein Expression and Purification—Expression of recombinant proteins was done in Escherichia coli cells grown in Luria broth at 37 °C either in a 1.5-liter (MultiGen, New Brunswick, CT) or 10-liter fermenter (Model L1523, Bioengineering AG), sparged with air, and stirred at 500 rpm. Spinach fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and Trx f WT as well as the C49S mutant were expressed and purified as described earlier (17Balmer Y. Schürmann P. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Mutant spinach Trx m C40S was constructed based on Trx mc (18Wedel N. Clausmeyer S. Herrmann R.G. Gardet-Salvi L. Schürmann P. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 18: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) by PCR, and the product was cloned into the expression plasmid pET-3c and expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (19Manieri W. Mutational and Functional Studies on Proteins of the Ferredoxin/Thioredoxin Regulatory System. Ph.D. thesis. 2002; (University of Neuchâtel)Google Scholar). It was purified to homogeneity as described earlier (20Schürmann P. Packer L. Methods in Enzymology. 252. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1995: 274-283Google Scholar). Recombinant Synechocystis ferredoxin was constitutively expressed in E. coli cells (strain DH5a from Invitrogen), transformed with the expression vector pCK5/19 (gift from Herbert Böhme, University of Bonn), and grown overnight in the presence of 50 μm FeSO4 and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The purification of ferredoxin was achieved through hydrophobic interaction, size exclusion, and anion exchange chromatography. Ferredoxin:NADP reductase (FNR) from spinach leaves has been purified to homogeneity. WT and mutant Synechocystis FTRs were expressed in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS in the presence of 50 μg/ml ampicillin, 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 10 mm glucose. When the culture reached an A600 nm of 6-7, expression was induced by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.2 mm, and 2 h later cells were harvested by centrifugation (2400 × g, 6 min, 4 °C). The purification of the FTR was done as described elsewhere (16Schürmann P. Packer L. Sies H. Methods in Enzymology. 347. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2002: 403-411Google Scholar). Analytical Procedures—Spectrophotometry was performed with a PerkinElmer Lambda 16 instrument. Difference spectra were recorded in dual-compartment cuvettes with compartment path lengths of 0.438 cm. Thiol determinations were done according to Habeeb (21Habeeb A.F.S.A. Hirs C.H.W. Timasheff S.N. Methods in Enzymology. 25. Academic Press, New York, London1972: 457-464Google Scholar). The activity of FTR was measured by its capacity to activate fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, using dithionite-reduced benzyl viologen as the electron donor for the FTR as described earlier (22Schürmann P. Stritt-Etter A.-L. Li J. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 46: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Gel electrophoretic analyses of the heteroduplexes were done under non-denaturing conditions in a Mini-Protean (Bio-Rad) with the buffer system described by Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Favre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar), omitting SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol, however. Dissociation of the WT FTR-Trx f heteroduplex by the thylakoid system was achieved in a 200-μl incubation mixture containing 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 10 mm sodium ascorbate, 0.2 mm 2,6-dichloroindophenol, 10 μm ferredoxin, 40 μm WT FTR-Trx f heteroduplex, and spinach thylakoids equivalent to 100 μg of chlorophyll. After equilibration with argon for 5 min in the dark at 25 °C, the mixture was illuminated for 10 min. Thylakoids were removed by centrifugation, and the 50-μl supernatant was separated on a Superdex-75 HR 10/30 column. Redox titrations were performed by incubating heteroduplexes in mixtures of oxidized and reduced DTT of defined redox potentials (24Hirasawa M. Schürmann P. Jacquot J.-P. Manieri W. Jacquot P. Keryer E. Hartman F.C. Knaff D.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5200-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) followed by analysis of the mixtures by native gel electrophoresis, which separates heteroduplexes from free FTR and Trxs. This experimental approach provided very reproducible results allowing a good estimate of the redox potential. Incubations were done with 50 μm heteroduplex in 300 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, and 100 mm DTT under argon at room temperature. Equilibrium was reached after 2 h when samples, large enough to easily visualize the proteins, were removed and analyzed on 15% native polyacrylamide gels. Heteroduplex Formation—Small amounts of heteroduplex were obtained by incubating equimolar solutions of FTR and Trx in 20 mm triethanolamine-Cl buffer, pH 7.3, for 2-4 h at room temperature. Larger quantities of heteroduplex were prepared by mixing FTR (up to 2 μmol) and a 1.2-1.5-fold excess of Trx in 20 mm triethanolamine-Cl buffer, pH 7.3, and 100 mm DTT to reduce possible mutant Trx homodimers. The mixture was concentrated to about 5 ml in an Amicon ultrafiltration cell (Model 12) fitted with an YM-10 membrane and diafiltered with 10 volumes of the above buffer without DTT. The diafiltered solution was transferred to a beaker permitting good oxygenation and slowly stirred overnight at 4 °C. Then the heterodimer was separated from free FTR and Trx by ion exchange chromatography on a Q-Sepharose HiLoad column and finally concentrated and diafiltered with 20 mm triethanolamine-Cl buffer, pH 7.3. Production and Purification—The WT and mutant Synechocystis FTRs were well expressed in E. coli and could be purified by our standard procedure except for the C87S mutant. This mutant, although produced in E. coli as evidenced by immunoblotting, could not be purified. The Cys to Ser mutation apparently generates an unstable protein, whereas the C87A mutation yields a more stable protein. We obtained yields of purified proteins in the range of 7-27 mg/liter of bacterial culture. Spectral Characterization—WT FTR has a typical UV-visible absorbency spectrum, which is characteristic of the 4Fe-4S cluster in its 2+ redox state and its interactions with the redox-active disulfide bridge (16Schürmann P. Packer L. Sies H. Methods in Enzymology. 347. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2002: 403-411Google Scholar). Changes in the environment of the Fe-S cluster are therefore expected to influence the spectral properties. Fig. 1A shows the spectra of the WT and the three mutant proteins, and Table I lists their molar absorbencies at 408 nm and the spectral ratios at 408/278 and 408/345 nm calculated from the spectra. The spectra of the mutants C87A and H86Y are very similar to that of the WT protein, except for small differences in the absorbency ratios. In the case of the H86Y mutant the lower 408/278 ratio is explained by the presence of the additional tyrosine. The spectrum of the C57S mutant is clearly different from that of the WT FTR, identical to the one observed with the N-ethylmaleimide-modified FTR (11Staples C.R. Ameyibor E. Fu W. Gardet-Salvi L. Stritt-Etter A.-L. Schürmann P. Knaff D.B. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11425-11434Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12Schürmann P. Gardet-Salvi L. Chimia. 1993; 47: 245-246Google Scholar), and appears to be caused by the oxidation of the Fe-S cluster to its 3+ redox state. This has been verified by treating WT and mutant proteins with dithionite. Comparable with what was reported earlier for the WT protein (11Staples C.R. Ameyibor E. Fu W. Gardet-Salvi L. Stritt-Etter A.-L. Schürmann P. Knaff D.B. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11425-11434Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we observed no change in the C87A or H86Y FTR spectra. However, reduction of mutant C57S clearly transforms its spectrum to the type observed with WT FTR as isolated, indicating that the cluster is in the 2+ redox state (Fig. 1B). During oxidation of the added dithionite, because of the presence of oxygen in the cuvette, the spectrum of the C57S mutant shifts back to its original oxidized form.Table 1Spectral properties of WT and mutant FTRs and of FTR-Trx heteroduplexesFTRColor408 nmSpectral ratio408/278 nm408/345 nmm−1 cm−1WTBrown-green17,4000.440.94C87ABrown-green17,4000.441.00H86YBrown-green17,4000.410.96C57SBrown-red18,7000.470.78WT-Trx fBrown-red0.350.78WT-Trx mBrown-red0.300.78C87A-Trx fBrown-green0.291.00 Open table in a new tab Changes of the spectra of the four proteins over time were used to compare their stability in solution, an approach already applied successfully to the spinach FTR (7Manieri W. Franchini L. Raeber L. Dai S. Stritt-Etter A.-L. Schürmann P. FEBS Lett. 2003; 549: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These results (data not shown) indicate that the C57S mutant has the most stable conformation. The WT and H86Y mutant are about equally stable but less than the C57S. The C87A mutant is significantly more labile, progressively losing its color during incubation, which indicates that the Fe-S cluster disintegrates. Thiol Determinations—The accessible and total thiols have been determined by reacting the proteins with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) in the absence and presence of SDS to verify the correctness of the mutations and the intactness of the structures. For the WT and the mutants H86Y and C57S the experimentally determined values correspond to the theoretically expected numbers, i.e. one accessible and five total thiols in the WT and H86Y FTR, and one accessible and six total thiols in the C57S mutant. For the C87A mutant the expected two accessible thiols were found; however, there were only four instead of six total Cys residues. This might be because of the formation of an artifactual disulfide bond in this less stable mutant under our aerobic assay conditions. Activity—The catalytic activity of the mutants was measured as their capacity to activate fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and compared with that of the WT protein. As expected, the two mutations modifying the active-site disulfide, C57S and C87A, completely abolish activity. The mutant H86Y had only ∼10% of the WT activity when tested under comparable conditions. Non-covalent Interaction with Ferredoxin—Synechocystis FTR and ferredoxin form a 1:1 complex resulting in a typical difference spectrum with a peak at 460 nm and a trough at 410 nm (Fig. 2A, inset). We titrated the Synechocystis FTR mutants with ferredoxin to verify whether the mutations influence this protein-protein interaction. The results show that at a low salt concentration all mutants form a 1:1 complex like the WT protein (Fig. 2A). These complexes are stabilized by electrostatic interactions and have a high affinity, because concentrations above 200 mm NaCl had to be added to observe a deviation from linearity in the formation of the complexes. Curiously, with the mutant C87A the absorbency difference due to the complex started to decrease when ferredoxin above an equimolar ratio was added (Fig. 2B). Interaction with Thioredoxins through Formation of Covalent Heteroduplexes—Reduction of Trxs proceeds via the formation of a transient, covalent heteroduplex between FTR and Trx. This intermediate complex can be stabilized using mutants in which one or both non-accessible Cys of the participating disulfide bridges are modified. We used mutant Trxs f C49S and m C40S as well as WT and all three mutant FTRs to study the formation of such heteroduplexes. Their presence could be demonstrated by chromatography and by native gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting. SDS-PAGE was not suited for these analyses because of artifactual S-S bond formation upon denaturation under oxidizing conditions leading to multiple bands. When the WT FTR as well as the mutants C87A and H86Y are incubated with Trx f C49S a new band appears upon electrophoretic analysis. This band is colored, clearly visible during migration like the band representing FTR, and reacts with antibodies against Trx f indicating that it represents the heteroduplex. Similar results were obtained with WT FTR and mutant Trx m. When dithiothreitol is added to the electrophoresis samples the heteroduplex band disappears. Upon incubation of the FTRs with WT Trx f, no heteroduplex is formed. Also the FTR C57S mutant did not form a heteroduplex, because its interacting Cys had been replaced. We observed, however, that in the presence of Trx f C49S, the C57S mutant was degraded. This was verified by following the A408/A278 absorbency ratio of an equimolar mixture of the two proteins. Fig. 3A shows that the ratio decreases because of the disintegration of the Fe-S cluster leading to a degradation of the protein, whereas the ratio of FTR incubated alone does not change. The heteroduplexes were separated from the unreacted proteins by chromatography. Whereas gel filtration did not completely resolve heteroduplex and FTR, because of the relatively small difference in molecular mass, ion exchange chromatography provided quantitative separation of all proteins engaged in the reaction (Fig. 4). This approach enabled us to purify and characterize the heteroduplexes and to use them for interaction studies with ferredoxin. The visible absorbency spectra of free and Trx-complexed FTR C87A are identical (compare in Table I). By contrast, the spectra of the heteroduplexes formed with WT or H86Y mutant FTR are comparable with the spectra of N-ethylmaleimide-modified FTR or mutant C57S (Fig. 1). This suggests that the redox state of the cluster is altered. The spectral change, which is most pronounced at 345 nm, provided a useful measure to follow complex formation over time as documented in Fig. 3B for the reaction with Trx m C40S. Similar results were obtained with Trx f C49S. A comparison of the kinetics between WT FTR and mutant H86Y reveals that the mutant FTR reacts more slowly. On the Trx interaction side of the FTR, Cys-30 represents an accessible thiol. A titration of accessible thiols in the heteroduplexes by 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) can therefore provide some information about the coverage of this surface by Trx. In the FTR·Trx f complex one thiol was found; however, none was found in the complex with Trx m. Because Trx f contains an accessible Cys on its surface and Trx m has none (25Capitani G. Markovic-Housley Z. del Val G. Morris M. Jansonius J.N. Schürmann P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 135-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), this result suggests that Cys-30 on the FTR surface is masked by the bonded Trx. The heteroduplex between WT FTR and Trx represents a stable reaction intermediate with an oxidized Fe-S cluster. Its reduction should dissociate Trx from FTR, which can be shown by gel filtration. It is assumed that in the chloroplast, light-reduced ferredoxin delivers the electron necessary to reduce the Fe-S cluster and thereby breaks the disulfide bond linking the two molecu"

A helical region of Hrs containing a Q-SNARE motif mediates this effect as well as its endosomal membrane association via SNAP-25, an endosomal receptor for Hrs. Hrs inhibits formation of an early endosomal SNARE complex by displacing VAMP-2 from the complex, suggesting a mechanism by which Hrs inhibits early endosome fusion. We examined the regulation of endosomal SNARE complexes to probe how Hrs may function as a negative regulator. We show that although NSF dissociates the VAMP-2·SNAP-25·syntaxin 13 complex, it has no effect on the Hrs-containing complex. Whereas Ca2+ dissociates the Hrs-containing complex but not the VAMP-2-containing SNARE complex. This is the first demonstration of differential regulation of R/Q-SNARE and all Q-SNARE-containing SNARE complexes. Ca2+ also reverses the Hrs-induced inhibition of early endosome fusion in a tetanus toxin-sensitive manner and removes Hrs from early endosomal membranes. Moreover, Hrs inhibition of endosome fusion and its endosomal localization are sensitive to bafilomycin, implying a role for luminal Ca2+. Thus, Hrs may bind a SNARE protein on early endosomal membranes negatively regulating trans-SNARE pairing and endosomal fusion.

It functions in nutrient uptake, regulation of the protein and lipid composition in the plasma membrane, and modulation of cellular responses by affecting exocytosis and receptor signaling. Molecules transit through the endocytic pathway by passing from one compartment to another through a series of membrane fission and fusion reactions. The ultimate role of this pathway is to allow the sorting of molecules to be recycled from those to be degraded. To function correctly, this system must regulate both the sorting events and the fusion events that promote proper targeting of internalized small molecules, lipids, and proteins.Protein machinery is required for fusion of biological membranes.

SNAREs form cytoplasmic helical bundles that bridge two membranes (trans-SNARE complex) to enable membrane fusion (1Jahn R. Lang T. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 519-533Google Scholar, 4Sutton R.B.

Botulinum and tetanus toxins are zinc endoproteases that cleave the SNAREs, inhibit the formation of SNARE complexes, and block fusion (1Jahn R. Lang T. Sudhof T.C.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Google Scholar). Once membrane fusion has occurred, the cytoplasmic adapter protein αSNAP binds to the SNARE complex and recruits N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) from the cytoplasm (1Jahn R. Lang T. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 519-533Google Scholar, 2Lin R.C. Scheller R.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 19-49Google Scholar, 7Chen Y.A. Scheller R.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 98-106Google Scholar). The ATPase activity of NSF dissociates the cis-SNARE complex, allowing the proteins to be available for trans-pairing and subsequent fusion events (1Jahn R. Lang T. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 519-533Google Scholar, 2Lin R.C. Scheller R.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 19-49Google Scholar, 7Chen Y.A. Scheller R.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 98-106Google Scholar).The trans-SNARE complex may be the catalyst for membrane fusion, although regulatory events or molecules may influence this process. For example, intraorganellar Ca2+ release from the yeast vacuole, mammalian endosome, or nuclear vesicles is required for fusion events involving those compartments (10Sullivan K.M. Busa W.B. Wilson K.L. Cell. 1993; 73: 1411-1422Google Scholar, 11Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Google Scholar, 12Holroyd C. Kistner U. Annaert W. Jahn R. Mol. Biol.

A model that has emerged from these studies is that an unknown event triggers Ca2+ release from the organelle. This local pool of Ca2+ is required for the fusion event, although the nature of its effector is unclear. Evidence from studies of homotypic vacuole fusion suggest that calmodulin may be a Ca2+ target because it binds to vacuoles upon Ca2+ release and appears to promote bilayer mixing of vacuoles and endosomes (11Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Google Scholar, 12Holroyd C. Kistner U. Annaert W. Jahn R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3035-3044Google Scholar, 13Colombo M.I. Beron W. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7707-7712Google Scholar), although the effect of calmodulin may be via regulation of SNARE complexes (14Quetglas S. Leveque C. Miquelis R. Sato K. Seagar M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9695-9700Google Scholar, 15Quetglas S. Iborra C. Sasakawa N. De Haro L. Kumakura K. Sato K. Leveque C. Seagar M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3970-3979Google Scholar).The endosome-associated protein Hrs (hepatocyte-growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate) has been shown to bind the Q-SNARE SNAP-25 (16Tsujimoto S. Pelto-Huikko M. Aitola M. Meister B. Vik-Mo E.O. Davanger S. Scheller R.H. Bean A.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 3047-3063Google Scholar) and inhibits the homotypic fusion of early endosomes (17Sun W. Yan Q. Vida T.A. Bean A.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 125-137Google Scholar). A heptad repeat region of Hrs containing a Q-SNARE motif mediates this effect as well as its endosomal membrane association (17Sun W. Yan Q. Vida T.A. Bean A.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 125-137Google Scholar). SNAP-25 is an endosomal receptor for Hrs, and Hrs inhibits the formation of an early endosomal SNARE complex by disallowing VAMP incorporation into the complex (17Sun W. Yan Q. Vida T.A. Bean A.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 125-137Google Scholar). Hrs is also likely involved in cargo sorting at the level of the early/late endosome by recruiting sorting or signaling components to the endosomal membrane. Therefore, Hrs may bind to SNAP-25 using its Q-SNARE domain and inhibit endosomal fusion while it is involved in cargo sorting or endosome motility using NH2-terminal VHS (Vps27, Hrs, STAM, a domain found in a number of proteins involved in trafficking that, in some cases, binds to GGA proteins); FYVE (Fab 1, YotB, Vac1, EEA1, a dual zinc finger domain found in a number of proteins involved in trafficking some of which bind to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate); or ubiquitin-interacting motif, a domain found in a number of proteins that binds ubiquitin with low affinity) domains (Ref. 17Sun W.

Interestingly, the binding of Hrs to SNAP-25 is negatively regulated by Ca2+ such that Ca2+ inhibits the binding of Hrs and SNAP-25 (18Bean A.J. Seifert R. Chen Y.A. Sacks R. Scheller R.H. Nature. 1997; 385: 826-829Google Scholar, 19Kwong J. Roundabush F.L. Hutton Moore P. Montague M. Oldham W. Li Y. Chin L.S. Li L. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2273-2284Google Scholar). In the present study, we have examined the regulation of Hrs- and VAMP-2-containing endosomal SNARE complexes and find that although NSF regulates the dissociation of the VAMP-2·SNAP-25·syntaxin 13 complex, it has no effect on the Hrs-containing complex. Conversely, Ca2+ dissociates the Hrs-containing complex but not the VAMP-2-containing SNARE complex. Ca2+ removes Hrs from early endosomal membranes at concentrations similar to those that dissociate the Hrs-containing SNARE complex. Similar Ca2+ concentrations reverse the Hrs-induced inhibition of early endosome fusion in a tetanus toxin-sensitive manner. Moreover, the sensitivity of Hrs inhibition of endosome fusion to bafilomycin implies a role for luminal Ca2+ release in the dissociation of Hrs from SNAP-25/early endosomal membranes. These data suggest that Hrs provides a Ca2+-dependent negative influence on early endosome fusion and that a VAMP-2-containing SNARE complex can form to enable fusion after the dissociation of Hrs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Hrs was expressed in insect cells as previously described (16Tsujimoto S.

The light chain of Tetanus toxin (a kind gift from Dr. Heiner Niemann) was expressed in E. coli as described (9Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Google Scholar, 24McMahon H.T. Ushkaryov Y.A. Edelmann L. Link E. Binz T. Niemann H. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 346-349Google Scholar). The antibodies were obtained from the following sources: Hrs (Alexsis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA), EEA1 (Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO), syntaxin 13 (a kind gift of Dr. Rytis Prekeris), VAMP-2 (Synaptic Systems, Germany), His6 (Sigma), and SNAP-25 (Sternberger Monoclonals, Inc., Lutherville, MD).Early Endosome Fusion—The homotypic fusion of early endosomes was measured as previously described (17Sun W. Yan Q. Vida T.A. Bean A.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 125-137Google Scholar). Effects of various molecules were assessed after incubation on ice for 15 min with the donor and acceptor membranes, cytosol, and ATP. The reactions were then transferred to 37 °C for 60 min. Free Ca2+ concentrations (0, 0.003, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 10, and 30 mm) and 1 mm of Cu2+, Ba2+, and Mn2+ were calculated in the presence of 2 mm EGTA using the WebMaxCalc program (www.stanford.edu/~cpatton/webmaxcS.htm) (18Bean A.J. Seifert R. Chen Y.A. Sacks R. Scheller R.H. Nature. 1997; 385: 826-829Google Scholar). TeTx treatment was performed by isolating the early endosomes as described above and resuspending the vesicles with varying concentrations of TeTx (5–6400 nm in a final volume of 30 μl) (9Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Google Scholar, 24McMahon H.T. Ushkaryov Y.A. Edelmann L. Link E. Binz T. Niemann H. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 346-349Google Scholar) followed by incubation at 37 °C for 30 or 60 min. The membranes were collected by centrifugation (100,000 × g for 10 min) and resuspended in 100 μl of homogenization buffer for use in the fusion reactions. For bafilomycin treatment, the cells were incubated with Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 10 mm Ca2+ for 60 min. Subsequently, the cells were labeled with fluorescent epidermal growth factor (15 min at 37 °C) in the presence of bafilomycin (100 nm). After labeling, the cells were washed, homogenized, and the endosomes were isolated in the presence of bafilomycin. The endosomes were incubated with Hrs (180 nm) in the presence of bafilomycin (15 min on ice). Bafilomycin was removed from some membranes by dilution with 10 volumes of reaction buffer, and all of the membranes were subjected to centrifugation followed by resuspension of endosomes in reaction buffer. The reactions were incubated (37 °C for 60 min) in the presence or absence of bafilomycin.SNARE Complex Disassembly—A constant amount of GST-syntaxin 13 (2 μg/reaction) bound to glutathione-agarose was incubated with constant amounts of SNAP-25 (1 μg), VAMP-2 (1 μg), or Hrs (2 μg) in the presence or absence of NSF/αSNAP (0.25 mg/ml), MgATP, or ATPγS (0.5 mm) or EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline binding buffer to a final reaction volume of 50 μl. In addition, the Hrs-containing complex was incubated in 50 μm free Ca2+. After incubation (4 °C for 60 min), the samples were washed three times with binding buffer, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblot analysis was performed using anti-Hrs and anti-VAMP-2 antibodies followed by appropriate 125I secondary antibodies. Parallel experiments in which Hrs- or VAMP-2-containing SNARE complexes were preformed prior to incubation with NSF/αSNAP or Ca2+ yielded similar results (see Fig. 1b). Immunoreactive bands were visualized and quantitated using phosphorimaging. The experiment shown is representative of six experiments.Endosomal Membrane Binding—The endosomal membranes were purified from HeLa cells by centrifugation on a discontinuous sucrose gradient (17Sun W. Yan Q. Vida T.A. Bean A.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 125-137Google Scholar). One 10-cm plate (approximately 80% confluent) was scraped in homogenization buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 ml) and passed through a 30-gauge needle 30 times. The resulting lysate was subjected to centrifugation (100,000 × g 10 min), and the pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer (0.17 ml) and then mixed with 61% sucrose to a final concentration of 46% sucrose (0.5 ml total). The 46% sucrose cushion was overlaid with two additional layers of sucrose 35% (0.65 ml) and 30% (0.45 ml) and then with homogenization buffer (0.4 ml). The gradients were subjected to centrifugation in a Beckman TLS55 rotor (124,000 × g for 60 min), and the early endosomes (interface between 30 and 35% sucrose) were collected. A constant amount of His-tagged Hrs (180 nm) was added to reactions containing purified endosomal membranes (as in a fusion reaction), along with various concentration of free Ca2+ (0, 0.003, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, and 30 mm) and 1 mm of Cu2+, Ba2+, and Mn2+. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min and stopped by subjecting them to centrifugation (100,000 × g for 10 min). The amount of His-Hrs was determined in pellet and supernatant fractions by quantitative Western blotting using anti-His antibodies and 125I-conjugated secondary antibodies. The experiment shown is representative of 11 experiments.RESULTSCa2+ but Not NSF Dissociates an Hrs-containing SNARE Complex—Because Ca2+ inhibits Hrs from binding to SNAP-25 (18Bean A.J. Seifert R. Chen Y.A. Sacks R. Scheller R.H. Nature. 1997; 385: 826-829Google Scholar, 19Kwong J. Roundabush F.L. Hutton Moore P. Montague M. Oldham W. Li Y. Chin L.S. Li L. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2273-2284Google Scholar), we tested the possibility that Ca2+ might prevent the formation of the recently identified SNARE complex containing Hrs, syntaxin 13, and SNAP-25 (17Sun W. Yan Q. Vida T.A. Bean A.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 125-137Google Scholar). In the presence of free Ca2+ (50 μm), <10% of Hrs bound to a complex of SNAP-25 and syntaxin 13 (Fig. 1a, lane 5) compared with the binding in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 1a, lanes 1–4). Even in the presence of αSNAP and NSF, two proteins known to disassemble SNARE complexes, Hrs was incorporated into a complex with SNAP-25 and syntaxin 13 (Fig. 1a, lane 2). In contrast, NSF and αSNAP dissociated the VAMP-2-containing SNARE complex (Fig. 1a, lane 7). The effect of NSF and αSNAP required MgATP because the VAMP-2-containing complex did not dissociate when EDTA was present (Fig. 1a, lane 8). Moreover, the ATPase activity of NSF was required for SNARE complex dissociation because the complex did not dissociate in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog ATPγS (Fig. 1a, lane 9). Parallel experiments in which Hrs or VAMP-2 SNARE complexes were preformed prior to incubation with Ca2+ or NSF/αSNAP yielded similar results (Fig. 1b and data not shown). The half-maximal concentration of Ca2+ required to inhibit Hrs binding to the SNAP-25·syntaxin 13 complex was ∼20 μm (Fig. 1b). These results suggested that Ca2+ could dissociate a SNARE complex containing Hrs, SNAP-25, and syntaxin, whereas NSF and αSNAP have no effect on the formation or dissociation of this complex.Ca2+ Dissociates an Hrs-containing SNARE Complex Allowing VAMP-2 Binding—The effect of Ca2+ dissociation of Hrs on the ability of VAMP-2 to enter a SNARE complex was tested. When VAMP-2 and Hrs alone were added to binding reactions with SNAP-25 and syntaxin 13, they were both able to form SNARE complexes (Fig. 1c, lanes 1 and 3, respectively). However, when VAMP-2 and Hrs were added together, >80% of VAMP-2 was not bound (Fig. 1c, lane 2), consistent with our previous studies (23Tsujimoto S. Bean A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2938-2942Google Scholar). Free calcium inclusion resulted in a loss of Hrs binding (Fig. 1c, lane 4). However, when VAMP-2 was included with Hrs and Ca2+, VAMP-2 binding was comparable with control (Fig. 1c, lane 5 compared with lane 1). This result demonstrates that Ca2+ has no effect on formation/dissociation of a VAMP-2·SNAP-25·syntaxin 13 SNARE complex and that in the presence of Ca2+ VAMP-2 is able to displace Hrs for SNAP-25-syntaxin 13 binding.Ca2+ Relieves the Hrs-dependent Inhibition of Early Endosome Fusion—The ability of Ca2+ to displace Hrs from the SNARE complex and allow complex assembly with VAMP-2 suggests that calcium might reverse the inhibition of early endosome fusion produced by Hrs. We previously developed an assay for endosome fusion in which different populations of HeLa cells engage in receptor-mediated endocytosis of epidermal growth factor linked to either Alexa 488 or tetramethylrhodamine, allowing isolation of donor and acceptor pools of endosomes. These compartments are used in fusion reactions that are analyzed by examining resonance energy transfer between the fluorophores to detect content mixing. This assay is dependent on temperature, time, energy, and cytosol (17Sun W. Yan Q. Vida T.A. Bean A.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 125-137Google Scholar). Fusion reactions containing 180 nm Hrs were inhibited 70.2 ± 1.4% compared with control reactions (Fig. 2). However, when Ca2+ was added to these reactions in the range of 3 nm to 30 mm, fusion became more efficient in a concentration-dependent fashion reaching a maximum of 84.0 ± 5.4% of control reactions (Fig. 2). This effect had a half-maximal value of ∼90 μm Ca2+ and was specific to calcium because other divalent cations such as Cu2+, Ba2+, and Mn2+ (all at 1 mm) were unable to relieve the inhibition (Fig. 2). Although not shown, Cu2+, Ba2+, and Mn2+ did not prevent Hrs from binding in SNARE complexes formed in vitro as performed earlier (Figs. 1 and 2). The concentration of calcium required and the cation specificity necessary for relieving the Hrs-dependent inhibition of early endosome fusion correlated well with the block in formation of the Hrs·SNAP-25·syntaxin 13 SNARE complex. This provided evidence to suggest that calcium might function to dissociate a “nonfusogenic” SNARE complex (containing Hrs) and allow a “fusogenic” SNARE complex (containing VAMP-2) to assemble on early endosomes.Fig. 2Calcium relieves the Hrs-dependent inhibition of early endosome fusion. Separate cultures of HeLa cells were treated with epidermal growth factor linked to either Alexa488 or tetramethylrhodamine, and early endosomes were prepared for use as donor and acceptor membranes (17Sun W. Yan Q. Vida T.A. Bean A.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 125-137Google Scholar). Fusion assays using standard conditions were performed in the presence of various concentrations of free Ca2+, Cu2+, Ba2+, or Mn2+ as indicated. The fluorescent signal at 580 nm (acceptor emission) was measured as an indicator of content mixing (17Sun W. Yan Q. Vida T.A. Bean A.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 125-137Google Scholar). The results are representative of three such experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Calcium Blocks Hrs from Binding to Early Endosomes—To further examine the notion that calcium might block binding of Hrs to SNARE complexes on membranes, we examined the effect of divalent cations on the binding of Hrs to purified early endosomes. When Hrs was added (180 nm) to early endosomes (purified as described under “Experimental Procedures”) in the presence of increasing Ca2+, a concentration-dependent decrease of Hrs binding was observed (Fig. 3a, lanes 1–7). The half-maximal value for calcium in this inhibition was ∼30 μm. As seen previously (Fig. 2), Cu2+, Ba2+, and Mn2+ had no effect (Fig. 3a, lanes 8–10). Importantly, Ca2+ did not affect the binding of an early endosomal protein, EEA1, suggesting specificity in its effect on Hrs (Fig. 3a, lanes 1–7). The inhibition of Hrs binding to early endosomes and the SNAP-25·syntaxin 13 SNARE complex suggested that Ca2+ might regulate how Hrs interacts with a receptor on membranes such as SNAP-25 (17Sun W. Yan Q. Vida T.A. Bean A.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 125-137Google Scholar). SNAP-25 is considered to be a strictly neuroendocrine or neuronal protein (although see Ref. 25Zhao C.M. Jacobsson G. Chen D. Hakanson R. Meister B. Cell Tissue Res. 1997; 290: 539-551Google Scholar). Our use of HeLa cells for not only purified early endosomes but also homotypic endosome fusion assays and the dependence of these assays on SNAP-25 as suggested by their sensitivity to botulinum toxin E suggests that SNAP-25 resides in this non-neuronal cell. To demonstrate that this is indeed the case, we attempted to detect SNAP-25 in HeLa cell lysates and purified early endosomes. As expected, markers for the ER (calnexin), plasma membrane (Na/K ATPase), lysosomes (LAMP1), and early endosomes (EEA1) were detectable in crude lysates from HeLa cells (Fig. 4, lane 1). The HeLa cell lysate also contained SNAP-25 (Fig. 4, lane 1). Most importantly, purified membranes from HeLa cells containing the early endosomal marker, EEA1, also contained SNAP-25 (Fig. 4, lane 2). These membranes did not contain detectable amounts of the Na/K ATPase, calnexin, or LAMP1, suggesting the lack of plasma membrane, ER, and lysosomes, respectively (Fig. 4, lane 2). This demonstrated that the membranes were not contaminated with other organelles and allowed us to conclude that SNAP-25 was indeed located on early endosomes from HeLa cells.Fig. 3Calcium inhibits Hrs binding to early endosomes. a, early endosomes were purified from HeLa cells (described under “Experimental Procedures”). The binding reactions contained purified early endosomes, recombinant His6-Hrs (180 nm), and various concentrations of divalent cations as indicated (lanes 2–10). After incubations (60 min at 37 °C), the membranes were collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. His6-Hrs was detected with a monoclonal antibody against the His tag and quantified using an 125I secondary antibody and phosphorimaging. The early endosomal marker, EEA1, was detected with chemiluminescence. b, plot of the Hrs amount bound to early endosomes from data in a.

HeLa cell lysate (lane 1) and purified early endosomes (lane 2) were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and proteins were detected on Western blots with specific antibodies using chemiluminescence. In addition to SNAP-25, marker proteins for the ER (calnexin), plasma membrane (Na/K ATPase), lysosomes (LAMP1), and early endosomes (EEA1) were detected. The bottom blot shows Ponceau S staining before antibody detection.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)VAMP-2 Is Required for Calcium to Efficiently Relieve Hrs Inhibition of Early Endosome Fusion—Certain bacterial toxins are valuable tools for dissecting the molecular details of SNARE-dependent membrane fusion. These toxins are proteases with highly specific cleavage recognition sites (9Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H.

For example, botulinum toxin E (BoNT/E) is a zinc endoprotease that cleaves the COOH-terminal 26 amino acids of SNAP-25 and thereby blocks membrane fusion that requires a four helical SNARE complex containing SNAP-25 (9Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Google Scholar). Likewise, TeTx cleaves the COOH-terminal 41 amino acids of VAMP-2 (24McMahon H.T. Ushkaryov Y.A. Edelmann L. Link E. Binz T. Niemann H. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C.

NF-κB is composed of homodimeric and heterodimeric complexes of Rel/NF-κB family members, including p65 (RelA), c-Rel (Rel), RelB, NF-κB1/p50, and NF-κB2/p52. Here we report the identification and characterization of a novel ZU5 and death domain-containing protein designated ZUD. In reporter gene assays, overexpression of ZUD inhibited NF-κB-dependent transcription induced by both tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 and their downstream signaling proteins. Gel shift assays indicated that the overexpression of ZUD inhibited binding of NF-κB to its target sequence. ZUD is a cytoplasmic protein, and coimmunoprecipitation assays indicated that ZUD interacted with the NF-κB subunit p105 and transactivator p65. Consistent with its role in inhibition of NF-κB-dependent transcription, ZUD sensitized cells to apoptosis induced by TNF and the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL).

The NF-κB/Rel family of transcription factors play critical roles in the regulation of immune responses, inflammation, apoptosis, and cell survival through induction of a large set of downstream genes, including cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and effectors (1Siebenlist U.

Five members of this family have been identified in vertebrates, including p65 (RelA), c-Rel (Rel), RelB, NF-κB1/p50, and NF-κB2/p52. All of these proteins share a conserved 300-amino acid region known as the Rel homology domain, which is responsible for DNA binding, dimerization, and nuclear translocation of NF-κB. These proteins bind DNA as homo- and hetero-dimers. Two of the active subunits of NF-κB, p50 and p52, are derived from the N-terminal domains of their precursor molecules, p105 and p100, respectively, via post-translational processing of the C-terminal ankyrin repeat-containing domains by the 26 S proteasome (1Siebenlist U.

The major cellular form of NF-κB is a heterodimer consisting of the DNA binding subunit p50 and the transactivator p65. Normally, NF-κB is retained in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells through association with its inhibitor IκB. Upon stimulation by various NF-κB activating signals, IκB is phosphorylated and degraded through an ubiquitin-dependent process. This process frees NF-κB, which is then translocated into the nucleus to activate transcription of its target genes (1Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev.

Upon TNF stimulation, TNF receptor 1 (TNF-R1), which contains a cytoplasmic death domain (DD), trimerizes and recruits the downstream DD-containing protein TRADD (TNF-receptor-associated death domain) to the receptor signaling complex (9Hsu H.

Although FADD is critically involved in TNF-R1-mediated apoptosis, TRAF2 and RIP recruit IKK (IκB kinase) to the TNF-R1 complex (13Devin A. Cook A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Kelliher M. Liu Z.

Once IKK is recruited to the TNF-R1 complex, it is activated and subsequently leads to IκB phosphorylation and NF-κB activation (6Ghosh S. Karin M.

Reagents—The ZUD EST clone (Research Genetics, Huntsville, TN), the recombinant human TNF, IL-1, and IFN-γ (R & D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN), the monoclonal antibodies against FLAG (Sigma), Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), hemagglutinin epitopes (Covance, Berkeley, CA), and the goat polyclonal antibody against p65 and the rabbit polyclonal antibody against p50 and IκBα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were purchased from the indicated manufacturers. Recombinant soluble TRAIL was produced in our laboratory (27Hu W.H. Johnson H. Shu H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 275: 10838-10844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Constructs—Expression plasmids for TNF-R1, TRAF2, TRAF6, IKK-β, p65, p50, and IκBα (Dr. David Goeddel) and the NF-κB (Dr. Gary Johnson) and IRF-1 (Dr. Uli Schindler) luciferase reporter constructs were provided by the indicated investigators. Mammalian expression plasmids for Myc-tagged p105 and its deletion mutants and for hemagglutinin- or FLAG-tagged ZUD and its deletion mutants were constructed by PCR amplification of the corresponding cDNA fragments and subsequent cloning into a cytomegalovirus promoter-based vector. Mammalian expression plasmid for SINK was described previously (28Wu M. Xu L. Zhai Z. Shu H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27072-27079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Northern Blot Hybridization—Human multiple tissue mRNA blots were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). The cDNA probe was an ∼1.6-kb fragment corresponding to the coding sequence of amino acids 1-518 of ZUD. The hybridization was performed with the radiolabeled ZUD cDNA probe in rapid hybridization buffer (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) under high stringency conditions. Cell Transfection and Reporter Gene Assays—293 cells (∼2 × 105) were seeded on 6-well (35-mm) dishes and transfected the following day by the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method (29Sambrook J. Fritch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Within the same experiment, each transfection was performed in triplicate, and, where necessary, an empty control plasmid was added to ensure that each transfection received the same amount of total DNA. To normalize for transfection efficiency, 0.3 μg of a Rous sarcoma virus β-galactosidase plasmid was added to each transfection. Luciferase reporter assays were performed using a luciferase assay kit (BD PharMingen) and following the manufacturer's protocols. β-galactosidase activity was measured using the Galacto-Light chemiluminescent kit (Tropix, Bedford, MA). Luciferase activities were normalized on the basis of β-galactosidase activities. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Transfected 293 cells from each 100-mm dish were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). For each immunoprecipitation, a 0.4-ml aliquot of lysate was incubated with 0.5 μg of the indicated monoclonal antibody or control mouse IgG and 25 μl of a 1:1 slurry of GammaBind G Plus-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for at least 1 h. The Sepharose beads were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl. The precipitates were fractionated on SDS-PAGE, and subsequent Western blot analyses were performed as described (27Hu W.H. Johnson H. Shu H.B. J. Biol.

Immunofluorescent Staining—293 cells cultured on glass coverslips were sequentially plunged into methanol at -20 °C for 10 min. The cells were rehydrated in PBS, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min, and stained with a monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (2 μg/ml) in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were rinsed with PBS and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200 dilution) for 45 min at room temperature. The cells were then rinsed with PBS containing Hoechst 33342 and mounted in Prolong Antifade (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The cells were observed with a Leica DMR/XA immunofluorescent microscope using a 40× plan objective. Apoptosis Assays—β-Galactosidase co-transfection assays for determination of cell death were performed as described previously (9Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V.

Briefly, 293 cells (∼2 × 105) were seeded on 6-well (35-mm) dishes and transfected the following day with 0.1 μg of a cytomegalovirus β-galactosidase plasmid and 2 μg of an expression plasmid for ZUD or an empty control plasmid. Approximately 36 h after transfection the cells were stained with X-gal. The numbers of surviving blue cells from five representative viewing fields were determined microscopically. Data shown are averages and standard deviations of one representative experiment in which each transfection has been performed in triplicate. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—An electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed as described previously (27Hu W.H. Johnson H. Shu H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 275: 10838-10844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 28Wu M. Xu L. Zhai Z. Shu H.B. J. Biol.

Briefly, 293 cells (∼2 × 106) cells were transfected with 10 μg of empty control plasmid or an expression plasmid for ZUD or SINK. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were treated with TNF (20 ng/ml) for 30 min. The cells were harvested and incubated in 500 μl of Buffer A (10 mm Hepes, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.8) at 4 °C for 10 min. Five hundred microliters of Buffer B (Buffer A plus 1.2% Nonidet P-40) was added, and the sample was mixed vigorously for 10 s. The pellet was spun down, washed with buffer A, and resuspended in 4.5 μl of Buffer C (Buffer A plus 10% glycerol). After the addition of 5 μl of 4.1 m NaCl and incubation at 4 °C for 30 min, the sample was centrifuged, and the nuclear extract in the supernatant was quantified with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. The NF-κB target oligonucleotide 5′-GGGGACTTTCCC-3′ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), was labeled with [32P]ATP by T4 DNA kinase and incubated with 20 μg of nuclear extract and 0.8 μg poly dI-dC in binding buffer (20 mm Tris, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 5% glycerol, pH 7.5) at room temperature for 15 min. The mixture was fractionated in 5% acrylamide gel prepared in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA. The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. Identification and Cloning of ZUD—To identify a potential DD-containing protein, we searched the GenBank™ EST databases using the tBLASTn program. This search identified multiple human EST clones that encode a novel DD-containing protein, which was designated ZUD. The longest EST clone (GenBank™ accession number BI762014) encodes the full-length human ZUD protein because it contains an in-frame stop codon 5′ of the putative ATG start codon and a poly(A) signal sequence at the 3′-end (data not shown). Sequence analysis indicated that human ZUD cDNA encodes a 518 amino acid protein (Fig. 1A). BLAST searches of the GenBank™ databases indicated that human ZUD shares ∼83% sequence identity with its mouse ortholog at the amino acid level. Structural analysis indicated that ZUD contains an N-terminal ZU5 domain (aa108-186) (a functionally unknown domain found in ZO-1 and UNC5H receptors), a middle leucine zipper motif (aa 249-270), and a C-terminal death domain (aa 423-491) (Fig. 1A). ZUD is mostly homologous to the cytoplasmic fragments of the UNC5H receptor family members, which also contain a ZU5 domain and a death domain (21Hong K. Hinck L. Nishiyama M. Poo M.P. Tessier-Lavigne M. Stein E. Cell. 1999; 97: 927-941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 22Leonardo E.D. Hinck L. Masu M. Keino-Masu K. Ackerman S.L. Tessier-Lavigne M.

A. 2003; 100: 4173-4178Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The overall similarity between ZUD and the cytoplasmic domains of UNC5H receptors is ∼40%. Northern blot analysis indicated that ZUD is expressed in pancreas, kidney, and liver as transcripts of ∼3 and ∼4kb respectively (Fig. 1B). ZUD mRNA is barely detectable in other examined tissues, including heart, brain, placenta, lung, skeletal muscle, spleen, thymus, prostate, uterus, testis, small intestine, colon, and peripheral blood leukocytes (Fig. 1B). Analysis of available sequences in the GenBank™ databases (cDNAs, ESTs, and genomic sequences) suggests that the more abundant ∼3 kb transcript represents the cDNA sequence we obtained. Because this sequence contains a 5′ in-frame stop codon and no splicing or poly(A) signal variants were identified by the GenBank™ data base searches, the ∼4 kb transcript may represent an alternative splicing form in which additional 5′-untranslated region sequence is included. ZUD Inhibits NF-κB-dependent Transcription—Because ZUD contains a DD, we determined whether ZUD has a role in apoptosis. Transient transfection experiments indicated that overexpression of ZUD could not induce apoptosis or inhibit death receptor-induced apoptosis (data not shown). Because many DD-containing proteins are involved in NF-κB activation and the NF-κB subunits p105 and p100 themselves contain DDs, we determined whether ZUD has a role in NF-κB activation. In reporter gene assays, overexpression of ZUD did not activate NF-κB but significantly inhibited NF-κB activation induced by overexpression of TNF-R1, TRAF2, TRAF6, IKKβ, and p65 (Fig. 2A). Moreover, ZUD could also inhibit NF-κB activation triggered by TNF and IL-1 stimulation (Fig. 2B). In contrast, ZUD did not inhibit IFN-γ-induced IRF-1 activation (Fig. 2C), suggesting that ZUD specifically inhibits TNF and IL-1 triggered NF-κB activation. ZUD Is a Cytoplasmic Protein and Inhibits NF-κB Binding to Its Target Sequence—Because ZUD inhibits p65-mediated transcription in our reporter assays (Fig. 2A), we reasoned that ZUD acts at a downstream step of the NF-κB activation pathways. To determine the potential mechanism, we examined the cellular localization of ZUD by immunofluorescent microscopy. These experiments indicated that ZUD was mostly localized in the cytoplasm and that this localization was not changed by TNF treatment (Fig. 3A). We next determined whether ZUD affects NF-κB transport into the nucleus and binding to its target sequences. Using gel shift assays, we found that ZUD inhibited TNF-induced NF-κB binding to a conserved target sequence (Fig. 3B). In these assays, a control protein, SINK, did not inhibit TNF-induced NF-κB DNA binding activity (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that ZUD functions in the cytoplasm to inhibit NF-κB binding to its target sequence. ZUD Is Associated with p105 and p65—Because ZUD inhibits NF-κB DNA binding activity, we determined whether this inhibitory effect is mediated by physical association between ZUD and NF-κB or IκB components. We co-transfected ZUD and p50, p65, p105, IκBα, IKKα, or IKKβ into 293 cells and performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The results indicated that ZUD interacted with p65 and p105 but not with p50, IκBα, IKKα, orIKKβ (Fig. 4, A and B). Consistent with the fact that ZUD interacted with p105 but not p50, domain-mapping experiments indicated that ZUD interacted with the C terminus (aa 535-969) (equivalent to IκBγ) but not the N terminus (aa 1-434) (equivalent to p50) of p105 (Fig. 4B). To determine which domain of ZUD is responsible for its interaction with p105 and p65, we made several deletion mutants of ZUD (Fig. 5A). Transient transfection and co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that the middle region containing the leucine zipper motif of ZUD, aa 186-400, is required and sufficient for interaction with p105 and p65 (Fig. 5). ZUD Sensitizes Cells to TNF- and TRAIL-induced Apoptosis—NF-κB promotes cell survival through transcriptional induction of anti-apoptotic genes (2Baeuerle P.A.

We transfected 293 cells with an expression plasmid for ZUD and examined its effect on TNF- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The results indicated that overexpression of ZUD significantly sensitized 293 cells to TNF- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6). In an attempt to clone novel DD-containing proteins, we isolated ZUD by searching human EST databases. ZUD contained a conserved ZU5 domain, a middle leucine zipper motif, and a C-terminal DD. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of ZUD suggests that it is homologous to the cytoplasmic domains of a group of netrin-1 receptors, UNC5H1-4 (21Hong K. Hinck L. Nishiyama M. Poo M.P.

A. 2003; 100: 4173-4178Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). These receptors were initially proposed as mediators of the chemo-repulsive effects of netrin-1 on specific axons (22Leonardo E.D. Hinck L. Masu M. Keino-Masu K. Ackerman S.L. Tessier-Lavigne M. Nature. 1997; 386: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Although UNC5H receptors are highly expressed in specific neurons during the development of the nervous system in adults, their expression can also be detected in thyroid, kidney, ovary, uterus, stomach, colon, lung, spleen, bladder, and breast tissues (23Ackerman S.L. Kozak L.P. Przyborski S.A. Rund L.A. Boyer B.B. Knowles B.B. Nature. 1997; 386: 838-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). These observations suggest a role for these receptors away from the neuronal guidance system. Recently, it has been shown that these receptors, when unbound to their ligand, induce apoptosis (24Llambi F. Causeret F. Bloch-Gallego E. Mehlen P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2715-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). One of the UNC5H genes, UNC5H2/B, was recently shown to be a direct transcriptional target of the tumor suppressor p53 and to mediate the proapoptotic activity of p53 (25Tanikawa C. Matsuda K. Nakanashi H. Fukuda S. Nakamura Y. Arakawa H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 216-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In addition, human UNC5H1, UNC5H2, and UNC5H3 are down-regulated in multiple cancers, and overexpression of these receptors inhibits anchorage-independent growth and invasion of tumor cells (26Thiebault K. Mazelin L. Pays L. Llambi F. Joly M.O. Scoazec J.Y. Saurin J.C. Romeo G. Mehlen P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4173-4178Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Because ZUD is undetectable in the brain, it may have no role in UNC5H-mediated chemo-repulsive effects. However, it is possible that ZUD may be involved in other UNC5H-mediated effects. In transient transfection and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we found that ZUD could interact with UNC5H2 in 293 cells (data not shown), pointing to the possibility that they are functionally connected. It has been suggested that UNC5H induces apoptosis when it is not bound with its ligand (24Llambi F. Causeret F. Bloch-Gallego E. Mehlen P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2715-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Our future studies will investigate whether ZUD is involved in this process. Overexpression of ZUD inhibited TNF- and IL1-triggered NF-κB activation, but not IFN-γ-triggered IRF-1 activation, suggesting that ZUD is a specific inhibitor of the NF-κB activation pathways (Fig. 2). In addition, overexpression of ZUD also inhibited TNF-R1-, TRAF2-, TRAF6-, IKKβ-, and p65-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 2). In gel shift assays, overexpression of ZUD inhibited TNF-induced NF-κB binding to its target sequence (Fig. 3B). Because ZUD is primarily a cytoplasmic protein (Fig. 3A), our original hypothesis was that ZUD might act by retaining NF-κB, especially the p65 subunit, in the cytoplasm. However, immunofluorescent staining experiments indicated that overexpression of ZUD did not block TNF-induced translocation of p65 and p50 to the nucleus (data not shown). Currently, the mechanisms responsible for the inhibitory effects of ZUD are unknown. One of the possibilities is that ZUD affects modification of p65 in the cytoplasm, such as phosphorylation, and this leads to inhibition of NF-κB binding to its target sequence and the subsequent inhibition of NF-κB-mediated transcription. In this context, it has been shown that p65 phosphorylation is important for the full transcription competence of NF-κB (37Naumann M. Scheidereit C.

Consistent with its role in inhibiting NF-κB-dependent transcription, ZUD also sensitizes cells to TNF- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis, probably through the inhibition of expression of NF-κB activated anti-apoptotic genes. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that ZUD is a novel NF-κB inhibitor with functional similarity to IκB proteins. Previously, it has been shown that p65 interacts directly with multiple proteins other than the IκB family, including p202 (42Min W. Ghosh S. Lengyel P. Mol. Cell.

Consistent with this notion, 5-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase, two major enzymes downstream of cPLA2, reside in the nuclear envelope and oxidize arachidonic acid (6Brock T.G. McNish R.W.

However, the entry of cPLA2 into the nucleus does not occur in these conditions (5Perisic O. Paterson H.F. Mosedale G. Lara-Gonzalez S. Williams R.L. J. Biol.

These findings along with the observations that more downstream enzymes such as lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase reside in the nuclear envelope prompted us to test a hypothesis that cPLA2 can enter the nucleus under some cellular conditions. Because the cPLA2 protein does not harbor any apparent classical nuclear localization signal (NLS), cPLA2 might be directed toward the nucleus by a partner protein(s). Recent studies using mice lacking a gene for cPLA2 showed that these mice were associated with impairment of allergic responses and fertility and also suggested important contributions of cPLA2 to the pathophysiology of neural cell death (13Bonventre J.V.

These studies imply that cPLA2 may play a more important role than previously thought. B-Myb is a nuclear transcriptional factor belonging to the Myb family that is ubiquitously expressed in tissues and is involved in cell growth control, differentiation, and cancer (15Oh I.H. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3017-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Furthermore, B-Myb interacts with other transcriptional factors and modulates their biological functions. Here we demonstrate so-far undefined physical associations of cPLA2 and BMyb transcriptional factor, which facilitates redistribution of cPLA2-B-Myb complexes into the nucleus. Importantly, we also show that redistribution of cytoplasmic cPLA2 after its specific binding to B-Myb transcriptional factor can regulate B-Myb-dependent c-myc gene expression. Cell Culture—African Green monkey kidney cells (CV-1) and human kidney cells (293T) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 4 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Human monocytes were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers by Ficoll-Paque separation followed by adherence for 1 h and removal of non-adherent cells. The adherent cells were collected and washed 3 times with culture medium. The resultant cell population consisted of >90% monocytes as judged by morphological examination and α-naphthyl acetate esterase staining (16Nakamura T. Lin L.L. Kharbanda S. Knopf J. Kufe D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4917-4922Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Monocytes were cultured in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 4 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The monocytes were treated with 103 units/ml MCSF (Leukoprol; Morinaga Co., Tokyo, Japan). Thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal cells were collected from cPLA2+/+ and cPLA2-/- mice and seeded at 4 × 105 cells/ml in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% FBS. To obtain mature macrophages, the collected cells were allowed to adhere to the plastic dish bottom for 2 h in culture medium, and adherent cells were harvested after washing the dish with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Lung fibroblasts were isolated from cPLA2+/+ and cPLA2-/- mice by digesting the minced lung tissues for 4 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.5% collagenase and 2% FBS. Obtained cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% FBS. Plasmid Construction and Transfection—The FLAG-tagged cPLA2 fragments 1-749 (full-length), 1-524, 1-294, 1-202, and 202-749 were constructed by subcloning restriction fragments of cPLA2 into a pact vector. A FLAG-tagged C-terminal truncated mutant cPLA2-(493-749) and FLAG-tagged cPLA2 mutated in nuclear export signal (NES) were created by PCR and were also subcloned into the same vector. We carried out DNA transfection by LipofectAMINE reagents (Invitrogen) or by calcium phosphate precipitation method. We used 3 and 65 μg of plasmids, respectively, for LipofectAMINE and calcium phosphate precipitation methods. Transfection of mouse peritoneal macrophages from cPLA2-/- mice was carried out according to a commercially available protocol using a Nucleofector transfection system and Mouse Neuron Nucleofector Solution (Amaxa Biosystems). We transfected 4 × 106 peritoneal macrophages with 0.5 μg of pact plasmid containing full-length cPLA2. Immunofluorescence Staining and Confocal Microscopy—Cells were fixed for 10 min by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature, permeabilized by 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocked with 1.5% skimmed milk and 1.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Primary antibodies (10 μg/ml) were prepared in 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Cells were then incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:20; Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:100; Amersham Biosciences). Confocal imaging was performed using a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS laser-scanning microscope. Cell Fractionation—Cell were suspended in ice-cold hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1.5 mm MgCl2,10 mm KCl) supplemented with 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and incubated for 5 min on ice. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction) was collected. The pellets were washed twice with ice-cold buffer. The pellets were resuspended in an appropriate volume of high salt buffer (20 mm Hepes, 25% glycerol, 0.42 m KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated for 15 min on ice. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were collected (nuclear fraction). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—For the immunoprecipitation experiments we used monoclonal antibodies specific for cPLA2 (Santa Cruz) or FLAG (Eastman Kodak Co.) or polyclonal antibodies for B-Myb (Santa Cruz). Immunoprecipitates were then electrophoresed in an SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride filter (Millipore), and the protein-protein interaction was confirmed by Western blotting using the above antibodies. Reporter Gene Activity Assays—CV-1 cells were co-transfected with empty vector or a pact plasmid containing B-Myb-(1-700) or pact plasmid containing cPLA2-(1-749) or both. The reporter gene activity was measured as described previously (17Mizuguchi G. Nakagoshi H. Nagasa T. Nomura N. Date T. Ueno Y. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9280-9284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter plasmid pmycCAT was used for the c-myc transcription assays in CV-1 cells expressing B-Myb and/or wild-type or mutant cPLA2. The amount of cell extracts used for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays were normalized with respect to cotransfected pRL-SV40 plasmid (Promega). The radioactivity of either [14C]chloramphenicol or its acetylated form was measured using a BAS 1500 imager (Fuji Film). Data were shown as averages of three experiments. PLA2 Assay—In vitro PLA2 assay was performed on cell lysates after subcellular fractionation into the nuclear and cytoplasmic components using the same protocol for Western blotting as described above. The PLA2 assay was performed as described in the previous publication (16Nakamura T. Lin L.L. Kharbanda S. Knopf J. Kufe D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4917-4922Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). PLA2 activity was assessed in the presence of 4 mm Ca2+ by measuring labeled arachidonic acid release from the sn-2 position of 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl phosphatidylcholine. The radioactive spots on TLC plates, each corresponding to released arachidonic acid, were visualized by a BAS 1500 imager (Fuji Film) and were quantitated by densitometric scanning of the spots. Generation of cPLA2-/- Mice—cPLA2-/- mice were generated by using homologous recombination as described previously (14Uozumi N. Kume K. Nagase T. Nakatani N. Ishii S. Tashiro F. Komagata Y. Maki K. Ikuta K. Ouchi Y. Miyazaki J. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 390: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). The mouse strains used (C57BL/6J and 129/Ola) are congenitally defective in type II PLA2, which is a secretory PLA2 participating in the release of arachidonate in the inflammatory lesions (18Bingham C.O. Murakami M. Fujishima H. Hunt J.E. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25936-25944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Reverse Transcription-PCR—c-myc expression in MCSF-activated human monocytes was assessed by reverse transcription-PCR using a commercially available kit (RT-PCR high-Plus, Toyobo). Primers used were human c-myc 5′-GCCAAGCTCGTCTCAGAGAAG and 5′-CAGAAGGTGATCCAGACTCTG, spanning exon 2 and exon 3 of the human c-myc genome. Real-time PCR was performed with a LightCycler instrument (Roche Diagnostics) using a commercially available kit (LightCycler RNA amplification kit SYBR Green I, Roche Diagnostics). The level of c-myc mRNA was expressed as a relative value to glyceraldehydes 3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. cPLA2 Ablation by RNA-mediated Interference and Antisense Oligonucleotide—The RNA-mediated ablation of endogenous cPLA2 in MCSF-activated human monocytes was performed essentially described as previously (19Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschi T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8186) Google Scholar). A 21-nucleotide small interfering RNA duplex with 3′-dTdT overhangs corresponding to human cPLA2 mRNA (5′-CCUGACGUUUCAGAGCUGATT and 5′-TTGGACUGCAAAGUCUCGACU) was synthesized (Japan Bio Services). RNA-mediated interference transfection was performed using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). Harvested human peripheral blood monocytes were stimulated with MCSF for 24 h and then transfected once using the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). The ablation of endogenous cPLA2 in human monocytes was also performed using antisense oligonucleotide, which was complementary to nucleotide 219-238 of human cPLA2 (5′-GTGCTGGTAAGGATCTAT) (20Locati M. Lamorte G. Luini W. Introna M. Bernasconi S. Mantovani A. Sozziani S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6010-6016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The mis-sense oligomer was used for the control (5′-GTGCTCCTAAGTTTCTAT). The phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified by high performance liquid chromatography (Sigma). Subcellular Localization of cPLA2—To identify the sequence(s) regulating subcellular distribution of cPLA2, we created serial deletion mutants and assayed their localization by indirect immunostaining and confocal microscopy. Deletions of the C-terminal amino acids up to but not including the putative NES (PLLLLTP), which resides in the N-terminal region of the PH-like domain, did not affect the distribution of cPLA2 (Fig. 1, A-D). Further deletion of the C-terminal 547 amino acids, cPLA2-(1-202), resulted in nuclear localization of the protein (Fig. 1, A and E). cPLA2 distributed diffusely in the nucleus and cytoplasm when CV-1 cells were transfected with a C-terminal-truncated cPLA2 (amino acids 493-749) (Fig. 1, A and F). Extension of the truncation to the amino acid 202, cPLA2-(202-749), however, resulted in exclusively cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 1, A and G). We obtained similar results with 293T cells. Replacement of all four leucines with alanines in amino acids 263-269 in a truncated (1-294) (Fig. 1, A and H) and a full-length (1-794) (Fig. 1, A and I) cPLA2 or complete deletion of this sequence (not shown) resulted in predominant nuclear localization of the proteins in CV-1 cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that the mid-portion of cPLA2 protein directs the protein to the cytoplasm, probably via the nuclear export signal (PLLLLTP). In Vivo Interaction of cPLA2 and B-Myb—Because the cPLA2 protein does not harbor any apparent classical NLS, cPLA2 might be directed toward the nucleus by a partner protein(s). We, therefore, investigated a possible adapter protein(s) that binds to cPLA2 and drives the protein into the nucleus. Physical or functional interactions have been suggested between cPLA2 and proteins involved in transcriptional regulation (12Pawliczak R. Han C. Huang X.L. Demetris J. Shelhamer J.H. Wu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33153-33163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 21Flati V. Haque S.J. Williams B.R.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1566-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the possibility that B-Myb, another protein that regulates transcription of several genes, may play a role as an adopter protein for nuclear transport of cPLA2. B-Myb is a potential candidate for this adapter protein, since it is ubiquitously expressed in tissues and is involved in cell growth control, differentiation, and cancer (15Oh I.H. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3017-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Furthermore, B-Myb interacts with other transcriptional factors and modulates their biological functions (22Tashiro S. Takemoto Y. Handa H. Ishii S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1699-1707PubMed Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis we first determined the subcellular distribution of cPLA2 after co-transfection with vectors containing either wild-type or mutant B-Myb protein. As described above, the wild-type full-length cPLA2-(1-749) predominantly localizes in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1B). Surprisingly, cPLA2 redistributes into the nucleus and colocalizes with B-Myb in the nucleus when the wild-type B-Myb is co-expressed (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the wild-type cPLA2 remains in the cytoplasm of cells expressing NLS-deleted B-Myb (B-Myb NLS) (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the NLS of B-Myb is required for the nuclear entry of cPLA2-B-Myb complexes. Similarly, truncated cPLA2 that is cytoplasmic when expressed alone translocates into the nucleus after co-expression with the wild-type B-Myb but not with NLS-mutated B-Myb (not shown). In contrast, co-expression of c-Myb, another member of the Myb family functioning as a transcriptional transactivator, does not direct cPLA2 into the nucleus (Fig. 2C), indicating that interaction between cPLA2 and B-Myb is specific. We next examined in vivo interaction between cPLA2 and B-Myb by immunoprecipitating cPLA2 followed by Western blotting with monoclonal antibody specific for B-Myb after transfection of 293T cells with the wild-type cPLA2 tagged with FLAG (Fig. 2F). In this condition, cPLA2 coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous B-Myb. A reciprocal experiment using FLAG-specific antibodies for immunoprecipitation of the full-length cPLA2 followed by Western blotting for B-Myb confirmed in vivo interaction of cPLA2 and B-Myb (Fig. 2G). We detected B-Myb protein in cPLA2 immunoprecipitates from 293T cells overexpressed with the N- or C-terminal-truncated cPLA2 (Fig. 2H), suggesting that the B-Myb protein can interact with both the N- and C-terminal regions of cPLA2. Nuclear Colocalization of cPLA2 and B-Myb in Human Macrophages—We ask next whether the specific interaction between cPLA2 and B-Myb and subsequent entry of cPLA2 into the nucleus might have any biological relevance. To address this question, we examined cPLA2-B-Myb interaction and the subcellular distributions of these proteins in human monocytes. MCSF up-regulates cPLA2 protein levels and intrinsic enzymatic activity in human monocytes (16Nakamura T. Lin L.L. Kharbanda S. Knopf J. Kufe D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4917-4922Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In resting human monocytes, cPLA2 was exclusively cytoplasmic, and the endogenous B-Myb protein level was very low in the nucleus (Fig. 3, A and C). MCSF treatment resulted in a significant nuclear redistribution of cPLA2, which colocalizes with B-Myb (Fig. 3, B and C). The interaction was confirmed by Western blotting using antibodies specific for cPLA2 of immunoprecipitates isolated by antibodies specific for B-Myb (Fig. 3D). A reciprocal experiment using antibodies specific for cPLA2 with immunoprecipitation and antibodies specific for B-Myb with Western blotting also showed an in vivo interaction of these proteins (not shown). In vitro cPLA2 enzyme assay showed that the nuclear fraction of resting monocytes contained a greater activity than the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 3E), indicating that a significant part of cPLA2 resides in the cytoplasmic fraction. The nuclear redistribution of cPLA2 was associated with a 2.6-fold increase in cPLA2 enzymatic activity in the nuclear fraction from MCSF-activated monocytes. In contrast, MCSF treatment resulted in only a 40% increase in cPLA2 activity in the cytoplasmic fraction, consistent with the notion that MCSF-induced terminal differentiation of human monocytes is associated with selective induction of cPLA2 activity in the nucleus. Regulation of B-Myb-dependent Gene Expression by cPLA2—B-Myb participates in regulation of several genes, each of which has an important role in cell growth. For example, the c-myc gene bears a putative B-Myb-responsive element on its promoter (23Nakagoshi H. Kanei-Ishii C. Sawazaki T. Mizuguchi G. Ishii S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1233-1240PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether nuclear cPLA2 could affect the B-Myb-dependent c-myc gene expression. To this end we measured the B-Myb-dependent reporter gene activity in CV-1 cells transiently expressing the pmycCAT reporter in the presence or absence of coexpressed wild-type cPLA2 (Fig. 4A). As expected, transient expression of B-Myb activated the reporter gene activity. Interestingly, coexpression of the full-length cPLA2-(1-749) greatly inhibits the B-Myb-dependent reporter gene activity to the control level. These findings suggest that cPLA2 negatively regulates c-myc gene expression in a B-Myb-dependent manner. However, it is unclear how the interaction between cPLA2 and B-Myb would be effective. To explore this, we next asked whether the action of B-Myb would be influenced by changes in levels of cPLA2. To test this, we transfected CV-1 cells with varying doses of plasmid containing full-length cPLA2 and then monitored the B-Myb-dependent activation of c-myc reporters. We found that cPLA2 inhibited B-Myb-dependent c-myc expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). These findings suggest that cPLA2 can inhibit the transcriptional activity of M-Myb. Up-regulation of c-Myc in Macrophages from cPLA2-null Mice—To investigate further the biological relevance of cPLA2-B-Myb interaction we examined c-Myc protein levels in cells that lack cPLA2 activity. To this end we used mice with disrupted cPLA2 gene (cPLA2-/- mice) (14Uozumi N. Kume K. Nagase T. Nakatani N. Ishii S. Tashiro F. Komagata Y. Maki K. Ikuta K. Ouchi Y. Miyazaki J. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 390: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Peritoneal macrophages were isolated from these mice and were then monitored for the c-Myc protein levels in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Peritoneal macrophages from cPLA2+/+ mice showed substantial amounts of cPLA2 in the cytoplasm and much smaller but detectable levels of cPLA2 in the nuclei (Fig. 5A). The absence of immunoreactive cPLA2 protein and cPLA2 transcripts (not shown) of peritoneal macrophages confirmed the disruption of the cPLA2 gene in the cells from cPLA2-/- mice. Peritoneal macrophages from cPLA2+/+ and cPLA2-/- mice contained equivalent quantities of B-Myb protein, suggesting that disruption of the cPLA2 gene does not affect the B-Myb protein levels in these cells. However, peritoneal macrophages from cPLA2-/- mice showed a substantial level of c-Myc protein in the nucleus, whereas c-Myc protein was barely detectable in macrophages from cPLA2+/+ mice. Next, we tested whether the restoration of cPLA2 expression could affect the c-Myc protein level in cPLA2-/- mouse peritoneal macrophages. We obtained low levels of cPLA2 after transfection in these primary cells, whereas the c-Myc expression was inhibited to 69% of the levels in non-transfected cPLA2-/- cells (Fig. 5B). We further examined the effects of cPLA2 inhibition in normal human peripheral blood monocytes. When the cPLA2 expression was specifically inhibited by using antisense oligonucleotide or small interfering RNA in MCSF-activated human monocytes, the c-myc expression was up-regulated in these cells (Fig. 5, C-E). Collectively, these results suggest that cPLA2 interacts directly with B-Myb to enter into the nucleus and thereby functions as an inhibitory factor for the c-Myc activity. A causative relationship was found between cPLA2 activation and UV irradiation and apoptosis (24Gresham A. Masferrer J. Chen X. Leal-Khouri S. Pentland A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1037-C1050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Pilane C.M. LaBelle E.F. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 191: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assessed the lack of cPLA2 on cell survival after DNA-damaging agents using lung fibroblasts isolated from cPLA2+/+ and cPLA2-/- mice. The growth rate was similar between cPLA2+/+ and cPLA2-/- cells without treatment (data not shown). However, compared with cPLA2+/+ cells, cPLA2-/- cells showed decreased numbers of cells 48 h after treatment with UV irradiation or H2O2 (Table I). In contrast, cPLA2-/- cells were more resistant to ionizing radiation than cPLA2+/+ cells, as assessed 96 h after irradiation. Taken together these results suggest that the lack of cPLA2 may affect cell growth and/or apoptosis after DNA damage, depending on the types of cells and damaging.Table ISurvival and growth rates after treatment with UV irradiation, H2O2, or X irradiationPercent survivalUVH2O2X irradiation%cPLA2+/+24.951.244.7cPLA2−/−3.514.4100.0 Open table in a new tab Our report has demonstrated thus far undefined physical associations of cPLA2 and B-Myb transcriptional factor that facilitates redistribution of cPLA2-B-Myb complexes into the nucleus. cPLA2 protein does not harbor any apparent intrinsic NLS, whereas B-Myb protein has multiple functional NLSs (26Takemoto Y. Tashiro S. Handa H. Ishii S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a deletion of the NLS from the B-Myb protein results in a mutant protein that cannot direct cPLA2 protein into the nucleus. Therefore, B-Myb protein may serve as an adapter protein for the nuclear entry of cPLA2. We also found that the physical interaction of cPLA2 and B-Myb proteins is specific and c-Myb, which is another Myb family transcriptional factor, does not direct cPLA2 into the nucleus. More importantly, our results suggest that, after binding to B-Myb protein, nuclear cPLA2 may participate in the transcriptional regulation of B-Myb-dependent expression of c-myc gene. It is surprising that cPLA2 is not confined to the cytoplasm but is redistributed into the nucleus to serve as a regulator for B-Myb-dependent gene expression. Originally, cPLA2 was considered to translocate onto the cytoplasmic membrane after appropriate stimuli to release arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids (3Clark J.D. Lin L.L. kriz R.W.

However, accumulating evidence suggests that cPLA2 can translocate from the cytosolic compartment to the nuclear membrane (2Schievella A.R. Regier M.K. Smith W.L. Lin L.L. J. Biol.

Recent findings that an acetyltransferase Tip60 interacted and colocalized with cPLA2 in the nucleus and that the introduction of protein complexes into the nucleus was associated with stimulation of apoptosis (28Sheridan A.M. Force T. Yoon H.J. O'Leary E. Choukroun G. Taheri M.R. Bonventre J.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4470-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) strongly support the notion that cPLA2 plays additional roles in the nucleus other than its enzymatic activity at the nuclear membrane. Our results suggest that the c-myc gene is one of the major targets of cPLA2-B-Myb complexes in the nucleus. We also foundthatcPLA2-B-MybcomplexesinthenucleusinhibitB-Myb-dependent gene expressions of cdc25C, but the effect was minimal (data not shown). cPLA2 was reported to be involved in the induction of apoptosis caused by tumor necrosis factor (29Adam-Klages S. Schwandner R. Lüschen S. Ussat S. Kreder D. Krönke M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5687-5694PubMed Google Scholar). Tumor necrosis factor is considered to transduce apoptotic signals from the cytoplasmic membrane to mitochondria. During these processes the 100-kDa cPLA2 is cleaved in a caspase 3-dependent fashion to a 70-kDa proteolytic fragment that loses its catalytic activity but contributes to apoptosis (30Wissing D. Mouritzen H. Egeblad M. Poirier G.G. Jaäättela M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5073-5077Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 31Atsumi G. Tajima M. Hadano A. Nakatani Y. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13870-13877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Although we have shown in the present study that the nuclear cPLA2 exhibited in vitro enzyme activity, the enzyme activity may be inhibited or masked in the nucleus by an adaptor protein such as B-Myb and Tip60. The c-myc protooncogene encodes a transcriptional factor that participates in the regulation of cellular proliferation and apoptosis (32Adachi S. Obaya A.J. Han Z. Ramos-Desimone N. Wyche J.H. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4929-4937Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 33Amati B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 112-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In particular, the Myc protein can induce S-phase entry and apoptosis by independent mechanisms (34Leone G. Sears R. Huang E. Rempel R. Nuckolls F. Park C.H. Giangrande R. Wu L. Saavedra H.I. Field S.J. Thompson M.A. Yang H. Fujiwara Y. Greenberg M.E. Orkin S. Smith C. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 105-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). As shown in cells from cPLA2-/- mice, the absence of cPLA2 may lead to an increased expression of c-Myc protein. Therefore, cPLA2 might exert an antiproliferative function in the nucleus by inhibiting aberrant expression of c-Myc and other proteins whose expressions are B-Myb-dependent. Most recently, Pawliczak et al. (12Pawliczak R. Han C. Huang X.L. Demetris J. Shelhamer J.H. Wu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33153-33163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) raised possibility that cPLA2 may regulate peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-mediated gene transcription, implying further a role in the regulation of genes that participate in differentiation and apoptosis. However, cPLA2 may exert its regulatory function for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-dependent gene transcription in the cytoplasm, since this property was apparent only after stimulation by calcium ionophore A23187, where cPLA2 did not enter the nucleus. In this report we showed that lack of cPLA2 affects cell survival after DNA damages (Table I). In this context it is noteworthy that Haq et al. (35Haq S. Kilter H. Michael A. Tao J. O'Leary E. Sun X.M. Walters B. Bhattacharya K. Chen X. Cui L. Andreucci M. Rosenzweig A. Guerrero J.L. Patten R. Liao R. Molkentin J. Picard M. Bonventre J.V. Force T. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 944-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) show that deletion of cPLA2 sustained activation of insulin-like growth factor signaling and promoted striated muscle growth. Therefore, we postulate the possibility that cPLA2 has separate roles for cell proliferation and apoptosis in the different compartment of the cell; the protein participates in stimulation of cell death in the cytoplasm, whereas the protein plays a role in the inhibition of proliferation and cell death in the nucleus."

Urease possesses multiple, nickel-containing active sites, and UreE, the only nickel-binding protein among the urease accessory proteins, activates urease by transporting nickel ions. We performed NMR experiments to investigate the solution structure and the nickel-binding properties of Bacillus pasteurii (Bp) UreE. The secondary structures and global folds of BpUreE were determined for its metal-free and nickel-bound forms. The results indicated that no major structural change of BpUreE arises from the nickel binding. In addition to the previously identified nickel-binding site (Gly97–Cys103), the C-terminal tail region (Lys141–His147) was confirmed for the first time to be involved in the nickel binding. The C-terminally conserved sequence (144GHQH147) was confirmed to have an inherent nickel-binding ability. Nickel addition to 1.6 mm subunit, a concentration where BpUreE predominantly forms a tetramer upon the nickel binding, induced a biphasic spectral change consistent with binding of up to at least three nickel ions per tetrameric unit. In contrast, nickel addition to 0.1 mm subunit, a concentration at which the protein is primarily a dimer, caused a monophasic spectral change consistent with more than 1 equivalent per dimeric unit. Combined with the equilibrium dialysis results, which indicated 2.5 nickel equivalents binding per dimer at a micromolar protein concentration, the nickel-binding stoichiometry of BpUreE at a physiological concentration could be three nickel ions per dimer. Altogether, the present results provide the first detailed structural data concerning the nickel-binding properties of intact, wild-type BpUreE in solution.

Therefore, the molecular details of the urease- and UreE-related biological systems are a matter of primary concern for many scientists, who are attempting to provide targets for potential drugs able to abolish the negative effects of bacterial urease activity. Many UreE proteins from various species possess His-rich C-terminal tails. The number of histidines conserved in the C-terminal tail differs among species, and their functional role is still unclear (14Ciurli S. Safarov N. Miletti S. Dikiy A. Christensen S.K. Kornetzky K.

Residues 13–17 in the BpUreE structures are different from those of the wild-type sequence, and the C-terminally conserved residues (144GHQH147)of BpUreE are not visible in the electron-density map. In addition, the metal ions bound in the KaUreE and BpUreE structures are copper and zinc, respectively, instead of nickel. No detailed structural data have been reported for the metal-free and nickel-bound forms of intact, wild-type UreE proteins. Because of these limitations in the UreE crystal structures, we have investigated the structural properties of nickel binding by BpUreE in solution. This study was designed to clarify the following three points. First, it is presently unclear whether the nickel binding affects the protein structure. Second, the functional role of the C-terminal tail in UreE proteins is not clearly understood. Finally, the nickel-binding stoichiometry of the UreE proteins is still ambiguous, particularly for BpUreE. Thus, we determined the solution structures of metal-free and nickel-bound BpUreE, and identified the nickel-binding stoichiometry as well as the nickel-binding site. The results constitute the first structural data providing new information about the nickel-binding properties of the intact, wild-type BpUreE in solution. Protein and Peptide Preparation—Recombinant BpUreE was prepared as described previously (20Lee Y.-H. Won H.-S. Lee M.-H. Lee B.-J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 522: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Three kinds of isotope-labeled ([u-15N], [90%-2H, u-15N], and [90%-2H, u-15N/13C]BpUreE were prepared by growing the cells in the corresponding isotope-supplemented media (21Lee Y.-H. Won H.-S. Ahn H.-C. Park S. Yagi H. Akutsu H. Lee B.-J. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 24: 361-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). BpUreECt (a synthetic peptide corresponding to the BpUreE C-terminal tail) was purchased from Anygen (Kwang-Ju, Korea), and its sequence and purity were confirmed by mass spectrometry and high pressure liquid chromatography. For the nickel-binding experiments, the protein/peptide solutions with various nickel concentrations were prepared individually by mixing the protein/peptide solution with the same volume of a NiCl2 solution. Before titrating the nickel, the absence of any effective metal ion in the prepared protein/peptide solution was checked by confirming the NMR spectral identities in the presence and the absence of EDTA. NMR Spectroscopy—The NMR spectra of BpUreE, dissolved in a standard buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5) containing 7% (v/v) D2O and 0.5 m NaCl, were obtained on a Bruker DRX 600 spectrometer at 308 K. The protein concentration was spectrophotometrically determined as a dimer (20Lee Y.-H. Won H.-S. Lee M.-H. Lee B.-J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 522: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The 15N-edited nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy-heteronuclear single quantum coherence (NOESY-HSQC) (mixing time = 150 ms) and a series of TROSY-based triple-resonance (HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HN(CA)CB, HN(COCA)CB, and HNCO) spectra (22Salzmann M.

The conventional [1H-15N] HSQC spectra (24Won H.-S. Lee T.-W. Park S.-H. Lee B.-J. J. Biol.

The BpUreECt solutions were prepared by dissolving a precise amount of the peptide powder in the standard buffer, containing 7% (v/v) D2O, 0.3 m NaCl, and various concentrations of NiCl2. Two-dimensional DQF-COSY, TOCSY, NOESY, and ROESY spectra of 4 mm BpUreECt were obtained on a Bruker DRX 500 spectrometer at 308 K. All of the NMR spectra were processed and analyzed using the NMRPipe/NMRDraw software (25Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol.

Equilibrium Dialysis—Equilibrium dialysis of BpUreE with 63NiCl2 (9,155 mCi/mg; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), diluted with various concentrations of unlabeled NiCl2, was performed in an eight-cell multicavity microdialysis cell (Bel-Art Products Inc., Pequannock, NJ) with precut dialysis membranes (M.W. cutoff = 6,000–8,000). Nickel binding of 5 μm BpUreE dimer was analyzed in the standard buffer containing 100 mm NaCl to reduce the Donnan effect. After a 16-h incubation at room temperature, the radioactivity was measured in aliquots from each compartment by using a Beckman LS6500 liquid scintillation system and Ultima-gold scintillation mixture (Packard Bioscience, Meriden, CT). Nonlinear least-squares regression analysis was performed according to a single-site binding model and a two-site binding model (nonidentical and independent sites) using the formula for fractional saturation (Y): Y=Bmax⋅[Ni2+]Kd(ave)+[Ni2+](Eq. 1) and Y=Bmax1⋅[Ni2+]Kd1+[Ni2+]+Bmax2⋅[Ni2+]Kd2+[Ni2+](Eq. 2) where Bmax, Bmax1, and Bmax2 are constants reflecting maximal binding, and Kd(ave), Kd1, and Kd2 are the dissociation constants (10Lee M.H. Pankratz H.S. Wang S. Scott R.A. Finnegan M.G. Johnson M.K. Ippolito J.A. Christianson D.W. Hausinger R.P. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1042-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 37Wakabayashi H.

Nickel-binding Effect—The solution structure of the intact, wild-type BpUreE protein was analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. Because BpUreE is expected to tetramerize in the presence of nickel (14Ciurli S.

Soc. 1999; 121: 844-848Crossref Scopus (297) Google Scholar) was essential to overcoming the high molecular mass. The chemical shifts assigned previously for the metal-free form (21Lee Y.-H. Won H.-S. Ahn H.-C. Park S. Yagi H. Akutsu H. Lee B.-J. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 24: 361-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and, in this work, for the nickel-bound form have been deposited in the BioMagResBank (http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu) under accession numbers 5484 and 5826, respectively. 2BioMagResBank (BMRB), a National Institutes of Health-funded bioinformatics resource, Department of Biochemistry, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI. The results implied that the nickel-bound BpUreE (dimer or tetramer) is symmetric in solution, as observed for the metal-free form (21Lee Y.-H. Won H.-S. Ahn H.-C. Park S. Yagi H. Akutsu H. Lee B.-J. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 24: 361-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The number of peaks in the NMR spectra was consistent with that expected from the number of residues in one subunit.

NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar) predictions and the sequential and short-range NOE connectivities were performed to determine the secondary structure of metal-free BpUreE in solution (Fig. 1). Because the three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra of the perdeuterated BpUreE necessarily lacked the NOE cross-peaks from the non-labile protons, we finely analyzed the NOE connectivities only between the amide protons. Three regions were determined as α-helices, where the sequential dNN(i,i+1) NOEs continued strongly, the short-range dNN(i,i+2) NOEs were frequent, the predicted backbone angles (ϕ and φ) indicated helical properties, and the consensus CSIs mainly indicated continuous helical tendencies: Trp27–Leu30, Met86–Asn98, and Lys116–Gly126. Ten β-strands were identified where the sequential dNN(i,i+1) and short-range dNN(i,i+2) NOEs were absent or weak, and the predicted backbone dihedral angles and consensus CSI results indicated mainly β-strand tendencies: Met1–Ile6, Lys19–Val25, Arg33–Thr39, Asp44–Lys48, Asp59–Ser64, Thr67–Lys74, Glu76–Lys82, Cys103–Glu106, Glu109–Val112, and Tyr129–Arg134. The presence of β-sheets was also supported by the ordered long-range NOEs between the strands, which allowed the construction of the two-dimensional global fold of the metal-free BpUreE, as shown in Fig. 2A. The present structural features of the metal-free BpUreE in solution indicated no significant differences from those of the zinc-bound crystal structure (19Remaut H. Safarov N. Ciurli S. Beeumen V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49365-49370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). All of the secondary structure elements were detected in the same regions with identical or similar lengths, and even the predicted backbone dihedral angles agreed rather well with those calculated from the zinc-bound crystal structure (Fig. 1). The two-dimensional fold was also the same as that observed in the zinc-bound crystal form (Fig. 2). All of the long-range 1HN-1HN NOEs in Fig. 2A were those that could be expected from the inter-atom distances in the crystal structure. In the presence of excess nickel, the resonance chemical shifts in all of the measured NMR spectra were hardly perturbed, although some resonances disappeared completely (refer to Fig. 3 and the assignment tables in BMRB). The resonances not only maintained nearly identical chemical shifts in the triple resonance spectra, but they also generated the same NOE correlations in the NOESY-HSQC spectra (data not shown). Therefore, the secondary structure and the two-dimensional global fold of the nickel-bound BpUreE in solution were determined to be identical with those of the metal-free form, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. These results provide the first detailed structural data for intact, wild-type UreE, in both the metal-free and nickel-bound states in solution. Based on these results, the metal binding to BpUreE induces no major conformational changes in the protein. However, it was previously reported that nickel binding to BpUreE greatly enhances the thermal stability of the protein (20Lee Y.-H. Won H.-S. Lee M.-H. Lee B.-J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 522: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus, it can be reasonably suggested that the structural constraints at the metal-binding sites of BpUreE would be critical to the folding, stability, and/or molecular dynamics of the protein.Fig. 2Structural comparison of BpUreE in the metal-free form in solution (A) and the zinc-bound form in the crystal (B).

The Asp11 resonance (indicated by blue-dashed circles) seemed to be highly sensitive to pH changes that were hardly detectable experimentally, because its chemical shift varied even with the same samples prepared independently.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Nickel-binding Sites—No significant changes in the chemical shifts were observed in the NMR spectra of BpUreE upon nickel binding. Therefore, the resonances that disappeared in the presence of nickel, probably because of the paramagnetic effect of nickel leading to severe peak broadening, could be assigned to the nickel-binding sites. All of the resonances that disappeared were mapped on two distinct regions in the protein sequences Gly97–Cys103 and Lys141–His147 (Figs. 3, 4, 5). The former region is consistent with the metal-binding site observed in the crystal structure of the zinc-bound BpUreE (Fig. 2B). In the crystal structure, the His100 residues served as the zinc-binding ligands, and the other residues in this region were located close (less than 10 Å) to the bound zinc ion (19Remaut H. Safarov N. Ciurli S. Beeumen V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49365-49370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In contrast, the C-terminal tail region (Lys141–His147) has not been shown to function in metal binding. It adopted a long, coiled conformation in the crystal structure, and the last four residues (144GHQH147) were not visible.Fig. 5Nickel-induced spectral change of 100 μm BpUreE. Selected regions from the two-dimensional [1H-15N] HSQC spectra in Fig. 3 were enlarged. The molar ratio of [BpUreE subunit]/[nickel] is denoted in each panel by the corresponding color of each spectrum. The resonances that changed upon nickel binding have brown assignment labels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the C-terminal tail region independently serves as a ligand for nickel binding or is just located close to the bound nickel, the synthetic peptide BpUreECt (N-acetyl-KEPFKYRGHQH-COOH), which corresponds to the C-terminal 11 residues of BpUreE, was synthesized. Its N terminus was acetylated to mimic a continuous peptide bond. Consistent with both the previous crystal and the present solution structures, which revealed a disordered C-terminal conformation, the NMR spectra of BpUreECt indicated a flexible, unstructured peptide conformation. Poor spectral dispersion and no inter-residue NOE cross-peaks were observed in the two-dimensional ROESY and the two-dimensional NOESY spectra, even with a 500-ms mixing time (data not shown). Although the sequence-specific NMR assignments could not be fully achieved because of the lack of inter-residue NOEs, the amino acid-specific assignments were obtained (Fig. 6) according to individual spin-system identifications using the two-dimensional DQF-COSY and the two-dimensional TOCSY spectra (38Yoon M.-K. Park S.-H. Won H.-S. Na D.-S. Lee B.-J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 39Won H.-S. Park S.-H. Kim H.E. Hyun B. Kim M. Lee B.J. Lee B.-J. Eur. J.

J. 2002; 368: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The two-dimensional TOCSY spectra were then employed to monitor the nickel-induced spectral changes in BpUreECt. The results indicated that the nickel binding occurred specifically at the last four residues (Gly-His-Gln-His) of the peptide. For example, in the fingerprint (1HN-1Hα correlation) region (Fig. 6, A and B) of the spectra, the Gly and one of the two His resonances were completely broadened in the presence of increasing concentrations of nickel ions. In addition, the other His resonance was severely broadened, with a slight chemical shift change, and either the Gln or Glu resonance was moderately broadened. In contrast, the other resonances remained nearly unchanged. In the side-chain correlation region (Fig. 6C), the cross-peaks between the Hϵ1 and Hδ2 atoms of both His residues (“a” and “b” correlations) disappeared upon nickel addition, and a chemical-shift change was observed in the side-chain cross peaks of either a Gln or Arg residue (“c” or “d” correlation). In contrast, the cross-peaks between the aromatic ring protons in the Phe and Tyr residues (“e” and “f” correlations, respectively) were hardly changed upon nickel addition. In summary, all of the resonances affected by nickel addition were mapped on the last four residues, which are a conserved sequence in UreE proteins (14Ciurli S. Safarov N. Miletti S. Dikiy A.

Together, the nickel-binding results of BpUreE and BpUreECt confirm the role of the C-terminal tail region of BpUreE in nickel binding. This work is the first to prove that the C-terminally conserved motif (Gly-His-Gln-His) of BpUreE is a nickel-binding site, in addition to the core region near the His100 residue. Nickel-binding Stoichiometry—Until now, one metal ion-bound tetramer (14Ciurli S. Safarov N. Miletti S. Dikiy A. Christensen S.K. Kornetzky K. Bryant D.A. Vandenberghe I. Devreese B. Samyn B.

Safarov N. Miletti S. Dikiy A. Christensen S.K. Kornetzky K. Bryant D.A. Vandenberghe I. Devreese B. Samyn B. Remaut H. Van Beeumen J. J. Biol. Inorg.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 522: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, the present results, which characterized the C-terminally conserved sequence as a potential nickel-binding motif, suggested the possibility of additional nickel binding to the BpUreE tetramer and/or dimer. Thus, in the present study, the nickel-binding properties of BpUreE were quantitatively investigated by analyzing a series of [1H-15N] HSQC spectra (Figs. 4 and 5). Upon the addition of increasing concentrations of nickel to 1.6 mm subunit, the spectra of BpUreE showed biphasic peak changes of the nickel-binding site resonances (Fig. 4), which could be described as a complete broadening following the chemical-shift change. For example, in Fig. 4A, the Lys141, Tyr142, His145, and His147 resonances were broadened by the addition of 0.125 equivalents of nickel per subunit, and they subsequently disappeared with 0.25 equivalents of nickel per subunit. Concomitantly, new peaks, such as a–e, appeared in the spectrum with 0.125 equivalents of nickel per subunit and were intensified in the spectrum with 0.25 equivalents of nickel. Thus, this kind of spectral change can be interpreted as a chemical-shift change with a slow exchange rate. The new (or shifted) resonances that emerged through the binding of 0.25 equivalents of nickel per subunit (Fig. 4A, peaks a–e) gradually became broadened without a chemical-shift change by the addition of over 0.25 equivalents of nickel per subunit. All of these spectral changes were completed at the stoichiometry of 0.75 equivalents of nickel per subunit, and no additional changes occurred with further nickel addition above 0.75 equivalents per subunit. Likewise, other resonances from the nickel-binding sites, including Gly97, Gly144, Arg99, His100, Thr101, and Cys103 (Fig. 4, B and C) were first shifted elsewhere, including the intermediate resonances “f–j,” through the binding of 0.25 equivalents of nickel per subunit, and then were completely broadened through the binding of 0.5 additional equivalents. The intermediate saturation ratio, 0.25 equivalents of nickel per subunit, at which the chemical-shift changes were completed, is consistent with the previously determined stoichiometry from an NMR hyperfine-shift experiment by Ciurli et al. (14Ciurli S. Safarov N. Miletti S. Dikiy A. Christensen S.K. Kornetzky K. Bryant D.A. Vandenberghe I. Devreese B. Samyn B. Remaut H. Van Beeumen J. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2002; 7: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It was interpreted as a stoichiometry of one nickel binding per tetramer. In addition, the BpUreE crystal structure showed tetrameric folds sharing one zinc ion (19Remaut H. Safarov N. Ciurli S. Beeumen V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49365-49370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was revealed that the protein, at millimolar concentrations, becomes tetramerized upon binding a metal ion, such as zinc or nickel (14Ciurli S. Safarov N. Miletti S. Dikiy A. Christensen S.K. Kornetzky K. Bryant D.A. Vandenberghe I. Devreese B. Samyn B. Remaut H. Van Beeumen J. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2002; 7: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the present results, the severe line-broadening after the addition of 0.25 equivalents of nickel per subunit supported an enlarged oligomeric state (Figs. 3 and 4). Thus, the first-phase spectral change at the millimolar BpUreE concentration (1.6 mm subunits) by the binding of up to 0.25 equivalents of nickel seems to reflect the nickel-induced tetramerization of the protein. Then, the additional spectral change that occurred with up to 0.75 equivalents of nickel per subunit indicates that the BpUreE tetramer, which was formed by binding one nickel ion, could bind additional nickel ions. Because the nickel-binding site resonances completely disappeared by 0.75 equivalents of nickel binding per subunit, we could not determine whether further nickel binding can occur. Thus, the spectral saturating ratio, 0.75 nickels per subunit, can be interpreted as at least three nickel ions binding to a BpUreE tetramer. This is the first observation of the BpUreE molecular state with more than one metal ion bound per tetramer, which could not be identified in the previous hyperfine-shift NMR and x-ray crystallographic studies. The nickel-binding features of BpUreE in the tetrameric state provide information about the nickel-binding properties of the BpUreE dimer, which has been suggested to be the only physiologically relevant state of the protein. Based on the crystal structure (Fig. 2B), the nickel-binding sites of BpUreE, including the C-terminal tail, are located on the surface of the dimeric unit and constitute the dimer-dimer interface in the metal-bound tetramer (19Remaut H. Safarov N. Ciurli S. Beeumen V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49365-49370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This suggests that each dimeric unit might be able to independently bind all of the nickels that can be captured by the tetramer. To define the nickel-binding stoichiometry in a physiologically relevant state, we first approached the NMR analysis of BpUreE at a micromolar concentration, 100 μm of subunit. At this concentration, nickel-induced tetramerization of BpUreE could be excluded, because the nickel-induced spectral change showed no intermediate chemical-shift change. For example, in Fig. 5, all of the nickel-binding site resonances, including Lys141, Tyr142, His145, His147 (Fig. 5A), Gly97, Gly144 (Fig. 5B), Arg99, His100, Thr101, and Cys103 (Fig. 5C) were gradually broadened without chemical-shift perturbations by the addition of increasing concentrations of nickel up to 0.5 equivalents per subunit. Among the resonances, only a trace of the His147 and/or His145 resonance remained at the stoichiometry of 0.5 equivalents of nickel per subunit, whereas the others were completely broadened. Then, the trace of His147 and/or His145 disappeared upon further nickel addition up to 0.625 equivalents per subunit. These results indicate that all of the nickel-binding site residues are located close to the first bound nickel, but more than one nickel can bind to a BpUreE dimer. Although no additional spectral changes occurred with the further nickel addition above 0.625 equivalents per subunit, the maximum number of nickel ions bound to a BpUreE dimer could not be defined, because of the peak disappearance. Thus, the nickel-binding stoichiometry of the physiological dimer was finally investigated by an equilibrium dialysis of 5 μm BpUreE dimer with 63NiCl2 (Fig. 7). The data were best fitted by the single-site binding model (Eq. 1) rather than by the two-site binding model (Eq. 2). The results demonstrated that the dimeric BpUreE protein can bind ∼2.5 nickel ions (Bmax = 2.49 ± 0.05) with an average dissociation constant, Kd(ave), of 17.3 ± 0.9 μm. These values are comparable with the data for the H91A/H144A-KaUreE protein (Bmax = 2.02; Kd(ave) = 10.6 μm), which can bind three metal ions per dimer (16Colpas G.J. Brayman T.G. Ming L.-J. Hausinger R.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4078-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 18Song H.K. Mulrooney S.B. Huber R. Hausinger R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49359-49364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Considering the NMR and equilibrium dialysis results together, we conclude that the nickel-binding stoichiometry of BpUreE at a physiological state is three nickel ions per dimer. The previous crystallographic and hyperfine-shift NMR studies (14Ciurli S. Safarov N. Miletti S. Dikiy A. Christensen S.K. Kornetzky K. Bryant D.A. Vandenberghe I. Devreese B. Samyn B. Remaut H.

Chem. 2001; 276: 49365-49370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) revealed only one metal ion bound to the BpUreE tetramer. The thermostability of the protein dimer is greatly increased by the binding of up to only one nickel equivalent (20Lee Y.-H. Won H.-S. Lee M.-H. Lee B.-J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 522: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The chemical-shift change in the millimolar BpUreE spectra was completed by one nickel binding per tetramer (Fig. 4). One nickel binding to the protein dimer, at a micromolar concentration, completely broadened all of the nickel-binding site resonances, except for His147 and/or His145 (Fig. 5). All of these results suggest that, among the possible three bindings, the first nickel binding would have higher affinity. During the first nickel-binding, the spectral change in the His147 and/or His145 resonance was either retarded or less than those in the other resonances from the nickel-binding sites (Figs. 4 and 5). Accordingly, the C-terminal histidines of BpUreE seem to be mainly involved in the binding of the two additional nickel ions, with relatively lower affinity, as observed for KaUreE (10Lee M.H. Pankratz H.S. Wang S. Scott R.A. Finnegan M.G. Johnson M.K. Ippolito J.A. Christianson D.W. Hausinger R.P. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1042-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 16Colpas G.J.

Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5410-5416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present work provides NMR-derived structural information about intact, wild-type BpUreE, in both the metal-free and nickel-bound states in solution. Based upon the results, BpUreE does not undergo any major conformational changes upon metal binding. The C-terminal tail region, Lys141–His147, was characterized as a nickel-binding site, in addition to the core region, Gly97–Cys103. The synthetic analysis of the equilibrium dialysis and NMR results suggests that the nickel-binding stoichiometry of BpUreE is three nickel ions per dimer in the physiological state."

A novel compound, KR-31378, has been shown to be a neuroprotective agent for ischemia-reperfusion damage in rat brain via its potent antioxidant and antiapoptotic actions. Here, we report the effects of this compound on atherogenesis and possible mechanisms of action. In Ldlr knockout mice fed with a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet, treatment with KR-31378 significantly inhibited fatty streak formation and macrophage accumulation. To address the possibility that KR-31378 may influence the initial stages of atherogenesis, we examined its effect on the adhesion and migration of monocytes to endothelial cells stimulated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha. KR-31378 decreased the adhesion in a dose-dependent manner. The observed decreases in cell adhesion and migration correlated with KR-31378-mediated down-regulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and interleukin (IL)-8. Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) is known to regulate the expression of adhesive and chemotactic molecules including VCAM-1 and IL-8. Indeed, transient transfection experiments, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and IkappaB degradation assay showed that KR-31378 decreased NF-kappaB activation. These results indicate that KR-31378 potently reduces fatty streak formation by inhibiting NF-kappaB-dependent cellular adhesion and chemotactic molecule expression, which are crucial to monocyte infiltration into the arterial wall during the early stages of atherogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2145571175,"Chemokines are small cytokines that function in immune responses, wound healing, and pathological conditions such as chronic inflammation and tumorigenesis. This multifunctionality has been attributed primarily to ligand interaction with multiple or dimerized receptors. However, multifunctionality could also result from interactions of the receptors with small peptides produced by processing of the chemokines. Chemokine peptides are functional in vivo, but it is not yet known whether they can interact with and activate their receptors. The work presented here examines the interactions between the two forms of human interleukin 8 (hIL-8), and its N- and C-peptides, with the chemokine receptors hCXCR1 and hCXCR2. We used a Tet-on retroviral system to introduce CXCR1 into mouse NIH 3T3 cells (that lack endogenous CXCR1) and monitored activation of this receptor by the ligands by using quantitative Ca2+ imaging and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. We found that the N and C termini of the chemokine can stimulate the respective CXCR1 to induce intracellular Ca2+ release and MAPK activation independent of the other regions of the molecules. Furthermore, we showed that these peptides can also stimulate chemotaxis of several cell types, including primary human microvascular endothelial cells, and that this function is specific and mediated by hCXCR1 and/or hCXCR2. These findings advance understanding of the multifunctionality exhibited by chemokines, reveal a new mode of functional regulation, and may serve as the basis for therapeutic targeting."
https://openalex.org/W2071125921,"The latent membrane protein-1 (LMP1) is an integral membrane molecule expressed by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) during viral latency and displays properties of a constitutively activated member of the TNF receptor family. LMP1 is required for B-cell or monocyte immortalization induced by EBV and is sufficient to transform rodent fibroblasts. Transforming potential of LMP1 is mediated by its cytoplasmic C-terminal domain, which activates various cellular signaling pathways including NFkappaB and JNK. In this report, we constructed mutants of LMP1 with preserved membrane spanning domain but mutated in the C-terminal domain and a second truncated C-terminal LMP1 fused to the enhanced green fluorescent protein. This latter mutant, termed LMP1-CT, impairs signaling by ectopic LMP1 as well as endogenous EBV-expressed wild-type (wt) LMP1. In contrast to dominant-negative mutants of LMP1 with preserved membrane spanning domains, LMP1-CT was unable to bind wt LMP1 to form an inactive complex. Its dominant-negative effects were due to binding and sequestration of LMP1 adapters TRAF2 and TRADD as assessed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments and confocal analysis. The effect was selective since LMP1-CT did not inhibit IL-1beta-induced signaling, whereas it impaired TNF-triggered NFkappaB and JNK signals without affecting TNF-induced apoptosis. In addition and in contrast to LMP1 constructs with membrane localization, LMP-CT did not display cytostatic properties in noninfected cells. Importantly, LMP1-CT inhibited survival induced by LMP1 in an EBV-transformed T-cell line expressing the type II viral latency commonly found in the majority of EBV-associated human tumors. These data demonstrate that LMP1-CT is a new tool to explore the differences between LMP1 and TNF signaling and may facilitate the design of molecules with potential therapeutic roles."
https://openalex.org/W2053683766,"Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 4 (IGFBP4/BP4) gene expression plays an important role in the transition from proliferation to differentiation of a human colon cancer cell line, CaCo2. We recently cloned and identified multiple cis elements (including putative binding sites for activator protein 1 (AP-1) and specificity proteins (Sps) ) in the promoter of human BP4 gene, and measured a significant upregulation of the promoter activity in response to c-Jun. We therefore examined the role of the single AP-1 site (-869/-863) and other cis elements, in regulating the expression of hBP4 gene, in the current studies. Deletion of a 25 bp sequence from -872 to -848, which contains the AP-1 site, significantly reduced BP4 promoter activity by approximately 50%. Surprisingly, mutation of the AP-1 site did not produce significant alteration in the activity of the BP4 promoter. However, mutation of 7 bp (5'-TGCTGCA) at the 3' end of the AP-1 site resulted in significantly decreasing the promoter activity by >50%. Proteins bound to the 25 bp probe (-872/-848) could be supershifted by antibodies specific for JunD and Sp3 in an EMSA. JunD binding was abolished on mutation of the AP-1 site and Sp3 binding was abolished on mutation of the 7 bp at -861/-855; binding of the purified Sp3 protein to the 25 bp probe was similarly abolished on mutation of the newly discovered Sp3 binding site (TGCTGCA). BP4 promoter activity was upregulated in insect cells in response to Sp3 expression, confirming a functional importance of the novel Sp3 binding site. These studies suggest that the Sp3 binding site, rather than the AP-1 site, may be playing a significant role in regulating the expression of IGFBP4 gene in CaCo2 cells."

To determine whether, similar to prothrombinase, taipan venom utilizes proexosite-1 on prothrombin for a productive complex assembly, the activation of proexosite-1 mutants of prethrombin-1 by the partially purified venom was studied. It was discovered that basic residues of this site (Arg35, Lys36, Arg67, Lys70, Arg73, Arg75, and Arg77) are also crucial for recognition and rapid activation of the substrate by taipan venom. This was evidenced by the observation that the Km and kcat values for the activation of the charge reversal mutants of prethrombin-1 (in particular K36E, R67E, and K70E) were markedly impaired. Competitive kinetic studies with the Tyr63-sulfated hirudin54-65 peptide revealed that although the peptide inhibits the activation of the wild type zymogen by taipan venom with a KD of ∼2 μm, it is ineffective in inhibiting the activation of mutant zymogens (KD > 4-30 μm). Interestingly, an ∼50-kDa activator, isolated from the taipan venom complex, catalyzed the activation of prothrombin in a factor Va-dependent manner and exhibited identical activation kinetics toward the substrate in the presence of the hirudin peptide.

Previous kinetic data have indicated that such a dramatic improvement in the rate of prothrombin activation by the prothrombinase complex is derived from an ∼100-fold decrease in the apparent Km and a greater than 1000-fold enhancement in the kcat of the activation reaction (2Rosing J.

Similar to FXa, it is previously shown that the N terminus of the taipan venom activator contains several γ-carboxyglutamic acid residues that can interact with negatively charged membrane surfaces in the presence of Ca2+ (10Speijer H. Govers-Riemslag J.W.P. Zwaal R.F.A. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, similar to FXa, the venom activator is by itself a very poor activator of prothrombin unless it is in complex with a venomic protein cofactor containing an apparent molecular mass of ∼220 kDa (10Speijer H. Govers-Riemslag J.W.P. Zwaal R.F.A. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to factor Va, the snake venom cofactor dramatically accelerates the activation of prothrombin by the taipan venom activator on negatively charged membrane surfaces (10Speijer H. Govers-Riemslag J.W.P. Zwaal R.F.A. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The mechanism by which factor Va improves the catalytic efficiency of FXa in the prothrombinase complex is not very well understood. However, it was recently demonstrated that the interaction of proexosite-1 of prothrombin with a recognition site on the prothrombinase complex is required for the efficient activation of the substrate (12Anderson P.J. Nesset A. Dharmawardana K.R. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16435-16442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, a proexosite-1-specific peptide ligand derived from the C-terminal domain of the leech inhibitor, hirudin, effectively inhibited the activation of prothrombin by FXa in the presence but not in the absence of factor Va (12Anderson P.J. Nesset A. Dharmawardana K.R. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16435-16442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This observation suggested that factor Va in the prothrombinase complex may provide a binding site for direct interaction with the proexosite-1 on prothrombin (12Anderson P.J. Nesset A. Dharmawardana K.R. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16435-16442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, we showed that the basic residues of proexosite-1 are required for the factor Va-dependent recognition and activation of prothrombin by FXa in the prothrombinase complex (13Chen L. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27564-27569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, the charge reversal mutants of proexosite-1 were activated normally by FXa alone, but their activation by the protease in the presence of factor Va was dramatically impaired (13Chen L. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27564-27569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Further support for a direct interaction between basic residues of proexosite-1 with a complementary site of factor Va was provided by the observation that the mutagenesis of a hirudin-like sequence on the C-terminal heavy chain of factor Va dramatically compromised the cofactor function of factor Va in accelerating the FXa activation of prothrombin by the prothrombinase complex (14Beck D.O. Bukys M.A. Singh L.S. Szabo K.A. Kalafatis M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3084-3095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).To determine whether, similar to activation by the prothrombinase complex, the basic residues of proexosite-1 constitute a recognition site for interaction with the taipan venom complex, the kinetics of activation of the proexosite-1 charge reversal mutants of prethrombin-1 (prothrombin lacking both the Gla and Kringle-1 domains) by the partially purified venom was studied. The prethrombin-1 mutants in which Arg35, Lys36, Arg67, Lys70, Arg73, Arg75, and Arg77 (chymotrypsinogen numbering (15Bode W. Mayr I. Baumann U. Huber R. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J.

Yang L. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27564-27569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The taipan venom activator complex was partially purified by the QAE-Sephadex ion exchange chromatography as described (8Walker F.J. Owen W.G. Esmon C.T.

Chem. 1986; 261: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The SDS-PAGE and a functional activity assays revealed that both the FXa-like activator and the higher molecular weight cofactor of taipan venom are copurified by these methods. The activation kinetic data suggested that, similar to activation by the prothrombinase complex, the Km and kcat values for the activation of the charge reversal mutants of prethrombin-1 (in particular K36E, R67E, and K70E) have been markedly impaired. Further kinetic studies in the presence of the proexosite-1 specific peptide Tyr63-sulfated hirudin54-65 suggested that the hirudin peptide inhibits the taipan venom activation of prethrombin-1 with a KD of ∼2 μm. However, the competitive inhibitory effect of the hirudin peptide on the activation of the mutants was impaired at varying degrees, which correlated well with the extent of the impairments observed in the activation of mutant zymogens. In agreement with previous results (10Speijer H. Govers-Riemslag J.W.P. Zwaal R.F.A. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the catalytically active subunit of the taipan venom complex was determined to be an ∼50-kDa molecule that could catalyze the rapid activation of prothrombin in a factor Va-dependent manner. Similar to the factor Va-dependent inhibition of FXa, the hirudin peptide inhibited the activation of prothrombin by the isolated venom activator in the presence of factor Va. These results suggest that the basic residues of proexosite-1 are specific recognition sites for a factor Va-like cofactor in the taipan venom complex. The results further suggest that an interaction between the basic proexosite-1 on prothrombin and an acidic region on factor Va accounts for the mechanism of the rate accelerating effect of the cofactor in the prothrombinase complex.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction and Expression of Mutant Proteins—The expression of wild type prethrombin-1 (prothrombin lacking both γ-carboxyglutamic acid and Kringle-1 domains) by the pNUT-PL2 expression/purification vector system in baby hamster kidney cells has been described previously (13Chen L.

A. 2003; 100: 12051-12056Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Human plasma proteins, antithrombin, factor Va, and FXa were purchased from Hematologic Technologies Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). Phospholipid vesicles containing 80% phosphatidylcholine and 20% phosphatidylserine (PC/PS) were prepared as described (17Smirnov M.D. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 816-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chromogenic substrates S2238, S2765, and S2222 were purchased from Kabi Pharmacia/Chromogenix (Franklin, OH). The chromogenic substrate N-p-tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide (GPR-pNA), Tyr63-sulfated hirudin54-65 (Hir54-65(SO−3), and O. scutellatus scutellatus (taipan venom) were purchased from Sigma. Unfractionated heparin (heparin sodium injection, 10,000 units/ml) from beef lung and the active anti-thrombin-binding pentasaccharide fragment of heparin (fondaparinux sodium) were purchased from Quintiles Clinical Supplies (Mt. Laurel, NJ). The prothrombin activating complex was partially purified from the crude venom by an ion exchange chromatography using QAESephadex A-50 (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (8Walker F.J. Owen W.G. Esmon C.T. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1020-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 10Speijer H. Govers-Riemslag J.W.P. Zwaal R.F.A. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, 25 mg of crude venom was dissolved in 2 ml of 0.1 m NaCl and 50 mm NaOAc, pH 5.8, and applied to a QAE-Sephadex ion exchange column (10 × 1 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. The bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1-0.6 m NaCl using a fast protein liquid chromatography system.SDS-PAGE—Pooled fractions from two QAE-Sephadex A-50 peaks were analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. To identify the active subunit of the activator complex, the gel was briefly rinsed with 0.1 m NaCl and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (TBS), and then overlaid with 1 mm S2222 in 1% low melting agarose. Following 15-30 min of incubation at room temperature, the active subunit of the taipan venom was identified by its ability to cleave the chromogenic substrate S2222 and thus generate a yellow dye in the gel. The gel was then developed with Coomassie Blue. To isolate the active subunit, 100 μg of the partially purified taipan venom was applied on a 10% preparative polyacrylamide gel, and following electrophoresis, the protein band possessing amidolytic activity was sliced out of the gel and transferred to a dialysis bag containing 1 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and electroeluted at 4 °C. The concentration of the venom activator was determined by stoichiometric titration of the enzyme with a known concentration of antithrombin in complex with an unfractionated high molecular weight heparin as described (18Rezaie A.R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Prothrombin and Prethrombin-1 Activation—The initial rate of prothrombin and prethrombin-1 activation by taipan venom was studied by incubating different concentrations of the substrate (0.2-30 μm) with QAE-Sephadex purified activator complex (140 pm) in TBS containing 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000, and 5 mm CaCl2 (TBS/Ca2+). Following 3-30 min of incubation at room temperature, small aliquots of the activation reactions were transferred to wells of a 96-well assay plate containing 20 mm EDTA, and the rate of thrombin generation was determined from the cleavage of S2238 (200 μm) at 405 nm by a Vmax Kinetic Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). The concentration of the generated thrombin was determined from standard curves prepared from the cleavage rate of S2238 (200 μm) by known concentrations of wild type and mutant thrombins as described (13Chen L. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27564-27569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The apparent Km and kcat values for prethrombin-1 activation were calculated from the Michaelis-Menten equation. In all reactions, it was ensured that less than 10% of prethrombin-1 was activated at all concentrations of the substrates.The factor Va-dependent activation of prothrombin by the isolated ∼50 kDa venom activator was utilized to evaluate the affinity of the venom activator for the human cofactor. Thus, the activation of prothrombin (0.5 μm) by the isolated activator (6.5 pm) was monitored on PC/PS vesicles (35 μm) in TBS/Ca2+ as a function of increasing concentrations of human factor Va (0.08-10 nm). Following 3-5 min of incubation at room temperature, EDTA was added to a final concentration of 20 mm, and the rate of thrombin generation was determined by an amidolytic activity assay using S2238 as described above. The kinetics of prothrombin activation by the isolated activator in complex with a saturating concentration of factor Va (30 nm) was also studied as a function of increasing concentrations of prothrombin (7.8-1000 nm) by the same procedures.Prethrombin-1 Activation in the Presence of Hir54-65(SO−3)—The inhibitory effect of the hirudin peptide on the kinetics of prethrombin-1 activation by the taipan venom complex was studied as described (12Anderson P.J. Nesset A. Dharmawardana K.R. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16435-16442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 13Chen L. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27564-27569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, the rate of activation of each prethrombin-1 derivative (1 μm) by the QAE-Sephadex purified venom (140 pm) was monitored in the presence of increasing concentrations of the hirudin peptide (0-30 μm) in TBS/Ca2+. The concentration of thrombin generated in each reaction was calculated from standard curves as described above except that GPR-pNA was used as the chromogenic substrate. It is known that the cleavage rate of this substrate is not affected by the occupancy of exosite-1 by the hirudin peptide (19Liu L.-W. H. T. Esmon C.T. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16977-16980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hirudin peptide inhibition of prethrombin-1 activation by the ∼50-kDa isolated active subunit was also monitored in the presence of a saturating concentration of factor Va (30 nm) on PC/PS phospholipid vesicles (35 μm) in TBS/Ca2+. To simplify comparisons of the hirudin peptide dependence of the activation reactions, the data for all activation reactions were normalized to maximal thrombin generation in the absence of the peptide. The dissociation constants (KD) for the interaction of the hirudin peptide with prethrombin-1 derivatives were calculated from Equations 1 and 2 as described (12Anderson P.J. Nesset A. Dharmawardana K.R. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16435-16442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Vobs=(Vlim-Vo)[Pre-1⋅Hir][Pre-1]o+Vo(Eq. 1) [Pre-1⋅Hir]=((KD+[Pre-1]o+[Hir]o)-Sqrt((KD+[Pre-1]o+[Hir]o)2-4[Pre-1]o[Hir]o)2)(Eq. 2) Vobs is the observed initial rate of prethrombin-1 (Pre-1) activation; Pre-1 is prethrombin-1; Vlim is the limiting rate at a saturating hirudin peptide concentration; Hir is hirudin peptide; Vo is the initial rate of activation in the absence of the hirudin peptide; KD is the dissociation constant for the hirudin peptide binding to prethrombin-1; and [Pre-1·Hir] represents the prethrombin-1-hirudin peptide complex concentration.RESULTSExpression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Wild type and mutant prethrombin-1 derivatives were expressed in baby hamster kidney cells using the pNUT-PL2 expression/purification vector system as described previously (13Chen L. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27564-27569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). All of the recombinant proteins were purified to homogeneity by an immunoaffinity chromatography using the Ca2+-dependent monoclonal antibody HPC4 as described (13Chen L. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27564-27569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The zymogenic and enzymatic properties of these mutants have been extensively characterized in previous studies (13Chen L. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27564-27569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 16Rezaie A.R. Yang L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12051-12056Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). All of the mutants are activated normally by FXa in the absence of a cofactor, and the mutant enzymes, with the exception of K70E, which exhibits an elevated Km value for S2238, cleave the chromogenic substrate with Km and kcat values similar to those by the wild thrombin, suggesting that the mutagenesis has not globally changed the conformation of mutant proteins (13Chen L. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27564-27569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that all of the mutant proteins have been purified to homogeneity (data not shown).Purification of the Prothrombin Activator from Taipan Venom—The prothrombin activating complex was partially purified from the crude venom by a QAE-Sephadex ion exchange chromatography as described (8Walker F.J. Owen W.G. Esmon C.T. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1020-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 10Speijer H. Govers-Riemslag J.W.P. Zwaal R.F.A. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bound proteins were eluted as two major peaks at NaCl concentrations of ∼0.22 and ∼0.35 m (Fig. 1A). Both prothrombin and chromogenic substrate activity assays indicated that only the latter peak contains the active protein. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that the first peak contains at least two inactive protein bands with apparent molecular masses of below 25 kDa (Fig. 1B, lane 2). The second peak, which contained four or five major protein bands with apparent molecular masses of ∼50-250 kDa (Fig. 1B, lane 1) activated prothrombin rapidly and also exhibited amidolytic activity toward FXa-specific chromogenic substrates. The venom activator hydrolyzed S2765 with Km and kcat values of 0.5 mm and 20 s-1, respectively. Previously, the gel filtration of the crude venom on the Sephadex G-200 followed by a QAE-Sephadex ion exchange chromatography has also fractionated the prothrombin activating complex into four or five similar major protein bands (8Walker F.J. Owen W.G. Esmon C.T. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1020-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 10Speijer H. Govers-Riemslag J.W.P. Zwaal R.F.A. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the gel filtration step with the commercial crude venom, prior to the ion exchange chromatography, did not yield any further purification advantage in this study (data not shown).To identify the active subunit of the prothrombin activating complex, SDS-polyacrylamide gel of the QAE-Sephadex isolated proteins was incubated with 1 mm S2222 dissolved in TBS containing 1% agarose. The active subunit was identified by its ability to release p-nitroaniline and was thus identified by the appearance of a yellow band in the gel at the point corresponding to the catalytically active enzyme. As shown in Fig. 1C, the active subunit of the taipan venom activator complex migrated at an apparent molecular mass of ∼50 kDa. This band was sliced out of a preparative gel and transferred to a small dialysis bag (12-14-kDa molecular mass cut-off) containing 1 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl. The active protein was eluted at 4 °C and concentrated by Centricon (Millipore Corp., Bradford, MA), and its activity toward prothrombin was examined in both the absence and the presence of human factor Va on PC/PS vesicles in TBS/Ca2+. In agreement with previous results (10Speijer H. Govers-Riemslag J.W.P. Zwaal R.F.A. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the ∼50-kDa activator was by itself a poor activator of prothrombin; however, in the presence factor Va, the activator rapidly activated the substrate to thrombin. The cofactor dependence of prothrombin activation revealed that the activator binds to factor Va with a Kd(app) of 0.34 ± 0.04 nm on PC/PS vesicles in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 2A). At a saturating concentration of factor Va (Fig. 2B), the activator activated prothrombin with a Km(app) and kcat values of 60 ± 10 nm and 670 ± 30 nm/min/nm, respectively.Fig. 2Activation of prothrombin by the∼50-kDa subunit of taipan venom in complex with factor Va. A, the apparent dissociation constant for the interaction of the isolated ∼50-kDa subunit with factor Va was determined by incubating the activator (3.8 pm) with prothrombin (100 nm) in the presence of increasing concentrations of human factor Va (0.08-10 nm) and 35 μm PC/PS vesicles in TBS/Ca2+. Following 3-5 min of incubation at room temperature, EDTA was added to a final concentration of 20 mm, and the rate of thrombin generation was determined by an amidolytic activity assay using S2238 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, the concentration dependence of prothrombin activation by the ∼50-kDa activator (6.5 pm) in the absence (○) and the presence of 30 nm human factor Va (•) was determined on PC/PS vesicles (35 μm) in TBS/Ca2+. The rate of thrombin generation was determined as described above and fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation to obtain the Km(app) (60 ± 10 nm) and kcat (670 ± 30 nm/min/nm) values in the presence of factor Va.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Reaction with Antithrombin and Active Site Titration of Prothrombin Activator—Noting that the ∼50-kDa activator from taipan venom exhibited FXa-like properties, it was rationalized that the activator may also react with antithrombin. However, the incubation of the isolated ∼50-kDa activator or the taipan venom activation complex partially purified by the ion exchange chromatography with 1 μm serpin for 1 h at room temperature did not result in a significant decline in the amidolytic or the proteolytic activities of enzymes. Nevertheless, it was discovered that both the isolated and the activator complex react with the serpin in the presence of a full-length heparin with second order association rate constants of 4.8 ± 0.5 × 103m-1 s-1, thus making it possible to reliably determine the concentration of the active site of the venom activators by their stoichiometric titration with known concentrations of anti-thrombin. It should be noted that SDS-PAGE analysis of the inhibition reactions indicated that, similar to FXa, the venom activator forms a stable high molecular weight complex with the serpin with no evidence for the enzyme recognizing the serpin as a substrate. Further study revealed that the rate accelerating effect of heparin is not mediated through a conformational activation of antithrombin but through a t"
