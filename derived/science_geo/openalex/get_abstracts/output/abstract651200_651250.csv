https://openalex.org/W3016732089,"Abstract Polyploidy is an evolutionary innovation for many animals and all flowering plants, but its impact on selection and domestication remains elusive. Here we analyze genome evolution and diversification for all five allopolyploid cotton species, including economically important Upland and Pima cottons. Although these polyploid genomes are conserved in gene content and synteny, they have diversified by subgenomic transposon exchanges that equilibrate genome size, evolutionary rate heterogeneities and positive selection between homoeologs within and among lineages. These differential evolutionary trajectories are accompanied by gene-family diversification and homoeolog expression divergence among polyploid lineages. Selection and domestication drive parallel gene expression similarities in fibers of two cultivated cottons, involving coexpression networks and N 6 -methyladenosine RNA modifications. Furthermore, polyploidy induces recombination suppression, which correlates with altered epigenetic landscapes and can be overcome by wild introgression. These genomic insights will empower efforts to manipulate genetic recombination and modify epigenetic landscapes and target genes for crop improvement."
https://openalex.org/W3016440405,"While fixed effects (FE) models are often employed to address potential omitted variables, we argue that these models’ real utility is in isolating a particular dimension of variance from panel data for analysis. In addition, we show through novel mathematical decomposition and simulation that only one-way FE models cleanly capture either the over-time or cross-sectional dimensions in panel data, while the two-way FE model unhelpfully combines within-unit and cross-sectional variation in a way that produces un-interpretable answers. In fact, as we show in this paper, if we begin with the interpretation that many researchers wrongly assign to the two-way FE model—that it represents a single estimate of X on Y while accounting for unit-level heterogeneity and time shocks—the two-way FE specification is statistically unidentified, a fact that statistical software packages like R and Stata obscure through internal matrix processing."
https://openalex.org/W3016423702,"Family history of disease can provide valuable information in case–control association studies, but it is currently unclear how to best combine case–control status and family history of disease. We developed an association method based on posterior mean genetic liabilities under a liability threshold model, conditional on case–control status and family history (LT-FH). Analyzing 12 diseases from the UK Biobank (average N = 350,000) we compared LT-FH to genome-wide association without using family history (GWAS) and a previous proxy-based method incorporating family history (GWAX). LT-FH was 63% (standard error (s.e.) 6%) more powerful than GWAS and 36% (s.e. 4%) more powerful than the trait-specific maximum of GWAS and GWAX, based on the number of independent genome-wide-significant loci across all diseases (for example, 690 loci for LT-FH versus 423 for GWAS); relative improvements were similar when applying BOLT-LMM to GWAS, GWAX and LT-FH phenotypes. Thus, LT-FH greatly increases association power when family history of disease is available. A new association method using both case–control status and family history (LT-FH) greatly increases association power in analyses of 12 diseases from the UK Biobank."

https://openalex.org/W3023066456,"A double burden of malnutrition occurs when individuals, household members or communities experience both undernutrition and overweight. Here, we show geospatial estimates of overweight and wasting prevalence among children under 5 years of age in 105 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) from 2000 to 2017 and aggregate these to policy-relevant administrative units. Wasting decreased overall across LMICs between 2000 and 2017, from 8.4% (62.3 (55.1-70.8) million) to 6.4% (58.3 (47.6-70.7) million), but is predicted to remain above the World Health Organization's Global Nutrition Target of <5% in over half of LMICs by 2025. Prevalence of overweight increased from 5.2% (30 (22.8-38.5) million) in 2000 to 6.0% (55.5 (44.8-67.9) million) children aged under 5 years in 2017. Areas most affected by double burden of malnutrition were located in Indonesia, Thailand, southeastern China, Botswana, Cameroon and central Nigeria. Our estimates provide a new perspective to researchers, policy makers and public health agencies in their efforts to address this global childhood syndemic."
https://openalex.org/W3016288291,"There is growing interest in leveraging real-world data to complement knowledge gained from randomized clinical trials and inform the design of prospective randomized studies in oncology. The present study compared clinical outcomes in women with metastatic breast cancer who received letrozole as first-line monotherapy in oncology practices across the United States versus patients in the letrozole-alone cohort of the PALOMA-2 phase 3 trial. The real-world cohort (N = 107) was derived from de-identified patient data from the Flatiron Health electronic health record database. The clinical trial cohort (N = 222) comprised postmenopausal women in the letrozole-alone arm of PALOMA-2. Patients in the real-world cohort received letrozole monotherapy per labeling and clinical judgment; patients in PALOMA-2 received letrozole 2.5 mg/d, continuous. Real-world survival and response rates were based on evidence of disease burden curated from clinician notes, radiologic reports, and pathology reports available in the electronic health record. Progression-free survival and objective response rate in PALOMA-2 were based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1. Concordance of survival and response rates were retrospectively assessed using inverse probability of treatment weighting-adjusted Cox regression analysis. Inverse probability of treatment weighting-adjusted Cox regression results showed similar median progression-free survival in the real-world and PALOMA-2 cohorts (18.4 and 16.6 months, respectively): the hazard ratio using real-world data as reference was 1.04 (95% CI, 0.69-1.56). No significant difference was observed in response rates: 41.8% in the real-world cohort vs 39.4% in the PALOMA-2 cohort (odds ratio using real-world data as reference: 0.91 [95% CI, 0.57-1.44]). These findings indicate that data abstracted from electronic health records with proper quality controls can yield meaningful information on clinical outcomes. These data increase confidence in the use of real-world assessments of progression and response as efficacy endpoints. Trial registration NCT01740427; Funding: Pfizer."
https://openalex.org/W3017383204,"The microgravity conditions of prolonged spaceflight are known to result in skeletal muscle atrophy that leads to diminished functional performance. To assess if inhibition of the growth factor myostatin has potential to reverse these effects, mice were treated with a myostatin antibody while housed on the International Space Station. Grip strength of ground control mice increased 3.1% compared to baseline values over the 6 weeks of the study, whereas grip strength measured for the first time in space showed flight animals to be -7.8% decreased in strength compared to baseline values. Control mice in space exhibited, compared to ground-based controls, a smaller increase in DEXA-measured muscle mass (+3.9% vs +5.6% respectively) although the difference was not significant. All individual flight limb muscles analyzed (except for the EDL) weighed significantly less than their ground counterparts at the study end (range -4.4% to -28.4%). Treatment with myostatin antibody YN41 was able to prevent many of these space-induced muscle changes. YN41 was able to block the reduction in muscle grip strength caused by spaceflight and was able to significantly increase the weight of all muscles of flight mice (apart from the EDL). Muscles of YN41-treated flight mice weighed as much as muscles from Ground IgG mice, with the exception of the soleus, demonstrating the ability to prevent spaceflight-induced atrophy. Muscle gene expression analysis demonstrated significant effects of microgravity and myostatin inhibition on many genes. Gamt and Actc1 gene expression was modulated by microgravity and YN41 in opposing directions. Myostatin inhibition did not overcome the significant reduction of microgravity on femoral BMD nor did it increase femoral or vertebral BMD in ground control mice. In summary, myostatin inhibition may be an effective countermeasure to detrimental consequences of skeletal muscle under microgravity conditions."

https://openalex.org/W3017353260,"Abstract Hippo signaling functions to limit cellular growth, but the aberrant nuclear accumulation of its downstream YAP1 leads to carcinogenesis. YAP1/TEAD complex activates the oncogenic downstream transcription, such as CTGF and c-Myc. How YAP1 is protected in the cytoplasm from ubiquitin-mediated degradation remains elusive. In this study, a member of Angiomotin (Motin) family, AMOTL1 (Angiomotin Like 1), was screened out as the only one to promote YAP1 nuclear accumulation by several clinical cohorts, which was further confirmed by the cellular functional assays. The interaction between YAP1 and AMOTL1 was suggested by co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescent staining. The clinical significance of the AMOTL1–YAP1–CTGF axis in gastric cancer (GC) was analyzed by multiple clinical cohorts. Moreover, the therapeutic effect of targeting the oncogenic axis was appraised by drug-sensitivity tests and xenograft-formation assays. The upregulation of AMOTL1 is associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes of GC, and knocking down AMOTL1 impairs its oncogenic properties. The cytoplasmic interaction between AMOTL1 and YAP1 protects each other from ubiquitin-mediated degradation. AMOTL1 promotes YAP1 translocation into the nuclei to activate the downstream expression, such as CTGF. Knocking down AMOTL1, YAP1, and CTGF enhances the therapeutic efficacies of the first-line anticancer drugs. Taken together, AMOTL1 plays an oncogenic role in gastric carcinogenesis through interacting with YAP1 and promoting its nuclear accumulation. A combination of AMOTL1, YAP1, and CTGF expression might serve as a surrogate of Hippo activation status. The co-activation of the AMOTL1/YAP1–CTGF axis is associated with poor clinical outcomes of GC patients, and targeting this oncogenic axis may enhance the chemotherapeutic effects."
https://openalex.org/W3016719704,"This work describes a large-scale analysis of sentiment associations in popular word embedding models along the lines of gender and ethnicity but also along the less frequently studied dimensions of socioeconomic status, age, sexual orientation, religious sentiment and political leanings. Consistent with previous scholarly literature, this work has found systemic bias against given names popular among African-Americans in most embedding models examined. Gender bias in embedding models however appears to be multifaceted and often reversed in polarity to what has been regularly reported. Interestingly, using the common operationalization of the term bias in the fairness literature, novel types of so far unreported bias types in word embedding models have also been identified. Specifically, the popular embedding models analyzed here display negative biases against middle and working-class socioeconomic status, male children, senior citizens, plain physical appearance, Islamic religious faith, non-religiosity and conservative political orientation. Reasons for the paradoxical underreporting of these bias types in the relevant literature are probably manifold but widely held blind spots when searching for algorithmic bias and a lack of widespread technical jargon to unambiguously describe a variety of algorithmic associations could conceivably be playing a role. The causal origins for the multiplicity of loaded associations attached to distinct demographic groups within embedding models are often unclear but the heterogeneity of said associations and their potential multifactorial roots raises doubts about the validity of grouping them all under the umbrella term bias. Richer and more fine-grained terminology as well as a more comprehensive exploration of the bias landscape could help the fairness epistemic community to characterize and neutralize algorithmic discrimination more efficiently."
https://openalex.org/W3016384416,"The role of recommendation algorithms in online user confinement is at the heart of a fast-growing literature. Recent empirical studies generally suggest that filter bubbles may principally be observed in the case of explicit recommendation (based on user-declared preferences) rather than implicit recommendation (based on user activity). We focus on YouTube which has become a major online content provider but where confinement has until now been little-studied in a systematic manner. We aim to contribute to the above literature by showing whether recommendation on YouTube exhibits phenomena typical of filter bubbles, tending to lower the diversity of consumed content. Starting from a diverse number of seed videos, we first describe the properties of the sets of suggested videos in order to design a sound exploration protocol able to capture latent recommendation graphs recursively induced by these suggestions. These graphs form the background of potential user navigations along non-personalized recommendations. From there, be it in topological, topical or temporal terms, we show that the landscape of what we call mean-field YouTube recommendations is often prone to confinement dynamics. Moreover, the most confined recommendation graphs i.e., potential bubbles, seem to be organized around sets of videos that garner the highest audience and thus plausibly viewing time."
https://openalex.org/W3016453231,"Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common malignant thyroid neoplasm comprising 80-90% of all thyroid malignancies. Molecular changes in thyroid follicular cells are likely associated with the development of PTC. Mutations in serine/threonine-protein kinase (BRAF) and Rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (RAS) are commonly seen in PTC.In total, 90 cases of PTC are randomly selected from archive paraffin blocks and 10μm sections were cut and processed for DNA extraction. BRAF V600E mutation and 8 types of KRAS mutations were investigated using Real Time PCR.BRAF V600E mutation was identified in 46% of PTC while KRAS mutations were seen in 11% of PTC. There was significant correlation between BRAF V600E mutation and PTC larger than 5cm in diameter, positive surgical margin and lymph node metastasis. BRAF V600E mutation was significantly higher in patients with less than 55-year of age than those more than 55-year of age. BRAF V600E mutation was significantly higher in patients with family history of thyroid cancer than those without. There was no significant difference in BRAFV600E mutation between males and females, PTC classic and follicular variants, unifocal and multifocal PTC. There was a significant higher percentage of BRAF V600E mutation in classic PTC than papillary microcarcinoma variant. There was no significant age, gender, histologic type, tumor size, lymph node metastasis, tumor focality, and surgical margin status differences between KRAS mutated and non-mutated PTC.BRAF V600E and KRAS mutation are seen in a significant number of PTC in the UAE. BRAF mutation is significantly correlated with large tumor size, positive surgical margins and lymph node metastasis suggesting an association between BRAF V600E mutation and tumor growth and spread."
https://openalex.org/W3016585041,"Recurrence and poorly differentiated (grade 3 and above) and atypical cell type endometrial cancer (EC) have poor prognosis outcome. The mechanisms and characteristics of recurrence and distal metastasis of EC remain unclear. The extracellular matrix (ECM) of the reproductive tract in women undergoes extensive structural remodelling changes every month. Altered ECMs surrounding cells were believed to play crucial roles in a cancer progression. To decipher the associations between ECM and EC development, we generated a PAN-ECM Data list of 1516 genes including ECM molecules (ECMs), synthetic and degradation enzymes for ECMs, ECM receptors, and soluble molecules that regulate ECM and used RNA-Seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for the studies. The alterations of PAN-ECM genes by comparing the RNA-Seq expressions profiles of EC samples which have been grouped as tumorigenesis and metastasis group based on their pathological grading were identified. Differential analyses including functional enrichment, co-expression network, and molecular network analysis were carried out to identify the specific PAN-ECM genes that may involve in the progression of EC. Eight hundred and thirty-one and 241 PAN-ECM genes were significantly involved in tumorigenesis (p-value <1.571e-15) and metastasis (p-value <2.2e-16), respectively, whereas 140 genes were in the intersection of tumorigenesis and metastasis. Interestingly, 92 of the 140 intersecting PAN-ECM genes showed contrasting fold changes between the tumorigenesis and metastasis datasets. Enrichment analysis for the contrast PAN-ECM genes indicated pathways such as GP6 signaling, ILK signaling, and interleukin (IL)-8 signaling pathways were activated in metastasis but inhibited in tumorigenesis. The significantly activated ECM and ECM associated genes in GP6 signaling, ILK signaling, and interleukin (IL)-8 signaling pathways may play crucial roles in metastasis of EC. Our study provides a better understanding of the etiology and the progression of EC."
https://openalex.org/W3017108235,"Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), a leading cause of urinary tract infections, is associated with prostate and bladder cancers. Cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1) is a key UPEC toxin; however, its role in bladder cancer is unknown. In the present study, we found CNF1 induced bladder cancer cells to secrete vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) through activating Ras homolog family member C (RhoC), leading to subsequent angiogenesis in the bladder cancer microenvironment. We then investigated that CNF1-mediated RhoC activation modulated the stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) to upregulate the VEGF. We demonstrated in vitro that active RhoC increased heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) phosphorylation, which induced the heat shock protein 90α (HSP90α) expression, leading to stabilization of HIF1α. Active RhoC elevated HSP90α, HIF1α, VEGF expression, and angiogenesis in the human bladder cancer xenografts. In addition, HSP90α, HIF1α, and VEGF expression were also found positively correlated with the human bladder cancer development. These results provide a potential mechanism through which UPEC contributes to bladder cancer progression, and may provide potential therapeutic targets for bladder cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3016668710,"How does sexual attraction alter social interaction behavior? We examined the influence of sexual orientation on locomotor approach-avoidance behavior and interpersonal distance. We immersed androphilic and gynophilic male subjects into a virtual environment and presented various male and female virtual persons. In the first experiment, subjects took a step forward (approach) or backward (avoidance) in response to the sex of the virtual person. We measured reaction time, peak velocity, and step size, and obtained ratings of sexual attractiveness in every trial. In the second experiment, subjects had to approach the virtual person as if they were to engage in a social interaction. Here, we analyzed interpersonal distance and peak velocity of the approaches. Our results suggest that sexual attraction facilitates the approach response and reduces the preferred interpersonal distance. We discuss our findings in terms of proxemics, current findings in sex research, and the applicability of our novel task in other fields of psychological research."
https://openalex.org/W3016729847,"Atrial metabolic disturbance contributes to the onset and development of atrial fibrillation (AF). Autophagy plays a role in maintaining the cellular energy balance. We examined whether atrial gene expressions related to fatty acid metabolism and autophagy are altered in chronic AF and whether they are related to each other. Right atrial tissue was obtained during heart surgery from 51 patients with sinus rhythm (SR, n = 38) or chronic AF (n = 13). Preoperative fasting serum free-fatty-acid levels were significantly higher in the AF patients. The atrial gene expression of fatty acid binding protein 3 (FABP3), which is involved in the cells' fatty acid uptake and intracellular fatty acid transport, was significantly increased in AF patients compared to SR patients; in the SR patients it was positively correlated with the right atrial diameter and intra-atrial electromechanical delay (EMD), parameters of structural and electrical atrial remodeling that were evaluated by an echocardiography. In contrast, the two groups' atrial contents of diacylglycerol (DAG), a toxic fatty acid metabolite, were comparable. Importantly, the atrial gene expression of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) was significantly increased in AF patients, and autophagy-related genes including LC3 were positively correlated with the atrial expression of FABP3. In conclusion, in chronic AF patients, the atrial expression of FABP3 was upregulated in association with autophagy-related genes without altered atrial DAG content. Our findings may support the hypothesis that dysregulated cardiac fatty acid metabolism contributes to the progression of AF and induction of autophagy has a cardioprotective effect against cardiac lipotoxicity in chronic AF."
https://openalex.org/W3016728872,"To explore the prevalence and factors that contribute to burnout among Thai psychiatrists.The practice of psychiatry can lead to emotional fatigue. As rates of emotional illness in Thailand continue to climb, increasing demands are placed on a limited number of psychiatrists. This can lead to burnout, and multiple negative physical and mental health outcomes.Electronic questionnaires were sent to all 882 Thai psychiatrists and residents via a private social media group managed by the Psychiatric Association of Thailand. The questionnaire included demographic data, the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), the Proactive Coping Inventory, and questions about strategies that Thai psychiatrists believed reduce/prevent burnout.Questionnaires were sent and 227 (25.7%) responded. According to MBI, 112 (49.3%) of respondents reported high level of emotional exhaustion, and 60 (26.4%) had a high level of depersonalization. Nearly all respondents (99.6%) maintained a high level of personal accomplishment. Working more than 50 hours per week (p = 0.003) and more patients per day (p = 0.20) were associated with higher levels of burnout. Feeling satisfied with work (p<0.001) and having a good support system from family (p = 0.027) and colleagues (p = 0.033) were associated with lower levels of burnout. The coping mechanisms related to lower levels of burnout included more emotional support seeking (p = 0.005), more proactive coping (p = 0.047), and less avoidance (p = 0.005).Compared to a previous study on burnout among Thai psychiatrists in 2011, in this study, the prevalence of high levels of burnout had increased dramatically from 17.1% to 49.3%. An intervention to decrease workload, strengthen social support and encourage proactive coping mechanisms may be beneficial for relieving burnout."
https://openalex.org/W3017070166,"Background Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive degenerative disease without curative treatment perspectives. Even when palliative care for people with PD seems to be beneficial, the need for palliative care is often not timely recognized. Aim Our aim was to develop a tool that can help healthcare professionals in timely identifying palliative care needs in people with PD. Design We used a mixed-methods design, including individual and focus group interviews and a three-round modified Delphi study with healthcare professionals from a multidisciplinary field. Results Data from the interviews suggested two distinct moments in the progressive PD trajectory: 1) an ultimate moment to initiate Advance Care Planning (ACP); and 2) the actual start of the palliative phase. During the Delphi process, six indicators for ACP were identified, such as presence of frequent falls and first unplanned hospital admission. The start of the palliative phase involved four indicators: 1) personal goals have started to focus on maximization of comfort; 2) care needs have changed; 3) PD drug treatment has become less effective or an increasingly complex regime of drug treatments is needed; and 4) specific PD-symptoms or complications have appeared, such as significant weight loss, recurrent infections, or progressive dysphagia. Indicators for both moments are included in the RADboud indicators for PAlliative Care Needs in Parkinson’s Disease (RADPAC-PD) tool. Conclusion The RADPAC-PD may support healthcare professionals in timely initiating palliative care for persons with PD. Identification of one or more indicators can mark the need for ACP or the palliative phase. We expect that applying the RADPAC-PD, for example on an annual basis throughout the PD trajectory, can facilitate identification of the palliative phase in PD patients in daily practice. However, further prospective research is needed on the implementation of the RADPAC-PD."
https://openalex.org/W3016316488,"In deep ocean hypersaline basins, the combination of high salinity, unusual ionic composition and anoxic conditions represents significant challenges for microbial life. We used geochemical porewater characterization and DNA sequencing based taxonomic surveys to enable environmental and microbial characterization of anoxic hypersaline sediments and brines in the Orca Basin, the largest brine basin in the Gulf of Mexico. Full-length bacterial 16S rRNA gene clone libraries from hypersaline sediments and the overlying brine were dominated by the uncultured halophilic KB1 lineage, Deltaproteobacteria related to cultured sulfate-reducing halophilic genera, and specific lineages of heterotrophic Bacteroidetes. Archaeal clones were dominated by members of the halophilic methanogen genus Methanohalophilus, and the ammonia-oxidizing Marine Group I (MG-I) within the Thaumarchaeota. Illumina sequencing revealed higher phylum- and subphylum-level complexity, especially in lower-salinity sediments from the Orca Basin slope. Illumina and clone library surveys consistently detected MG-I Thaumarchaeota and halotolerant Deltaproteobacteria in the hypersaline anoxic sediments, but relative abundances of the KB1 lineage differed between the two sequencing methods. The stable isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic carbon and methane in porewater, and sulfate concentrations decreasing downcore indicated methanogenesis and sulfate reduction in the anoxic sediments. While anaerobic microbial processes likely occur at low rates near their maximal salinity thresholds in Orca Basin, long-term accumulation of reaction products leads to high methane concentrations and reducing conditions within the Orca Basin brine and sediments."
https://openalex.org/W3016539235,"Although fungicides could be the best solution in combating fungal infections in crops, however, the phytotoxic level of fungicides to the crops should be tested first to ensure that it is safe for the crops. Moreover, nanocarrier systems of fungicides could play a significant role in the advancement of crop protection. For this reason, chitosan was chosen in the present study as a nanocarrier for fungicides of hexaconazole and/or dazomet in the development of a new generation of agronanofungicides with a high antifungal potent agent and no phytotoxic effect. Hence, the encapsulation of fungicides into the non-toxic biopolymer, chitosan was aims to reduce the phytotoxic level of fungicides. In the present study, the in vivo phytotoxicity of chitosan-fungicides nanoparticles on the physiological and vegetative growth of oil palm seedlings was evaluated in comparison to its pure fungicides as well as the conventional fungicides. The results revealed the formation of chitosan-fungicides nanoparticles could reduce the phytotoxic effect on oil palm seedlings compared to their counterparts, pure fungicides. The chitosan-fungicides nanoparticles were seen to greatly reduce the phytotoxic effect compared to the conventional fungicides with the same active ingredient."
https://openalex.org/W3016772159,"Denitrification, an important process in microbial mediated nitrogen cycle, plays important roles in nitrogen loss in estuarine sediments. However, the function of denitrifiers in the estuarine subsurface sediments remained poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed the potential activity, abundance and community structure of nirS-type denitrifiers using 15N-labeled incubation quantitative-PCR and high throughput sequencing techniques in sediment cores from Pearl River Estuary (PRE). Results showed that subsurface sediments had nearly same level denitrification potential activity compare to surface sediments, although the abundance of nirS gene decreased sharply from surface to bottom in sediment cores. Meanwhile, nirS gene abundance exhibit significant temporal variations, which is consistent with denitrification potential activity. Moreover, the community structure and diversity of nirS-type denitrifiers in sediment cores exhibited remarkable temporal shift pattern. For spatial variation, no significant difference was observed of denitrifiers community structure in each sediment core from the surface to the subsurface, while there were significant different diversity characteristic among different cores. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that multiple environmental factors including salinity, pH, oxidation-reduction potential, nutrient content and organic substances synergistically shaped the diversity and distribution of nirS-type denitrifers in PRE sediments. Our results showed that nirS-type denitrifers played important roles in the nitrogen removal in subsurface sediments of PRE."
https://openalex.org/W3016320565,"People are adept at generating and evaluating explanations for events around them. But what makes for a satisfying explanation? While some scholars argue that individuals find simple explanations to be more satisfying (Lombrozo, 2007), others argue that complex explanations are preferred (Zemla, et al. 2017). Uniting these perspectives, we posit that people believe a satisfying explanation should be as complex as the event being explained-what we term the complexity matching hypothesis. Thus, individuals will prefer simple explanations for simple events, and complex explanations for complex events. Four studies provide robust evidence for the complexity-matching hypothesis. In studies 1-3, participants read scenarios and then predicted the complexity of a satisfying explanation (Study 1), generated an explanation themselves (Study 2), and evaluated explanations (Study 3). Lastly, in Study 4, we explored a different manipulation of complexity to demonstrate robustness across paradigms. We end with a discussion of mechanisms that might underlie this preference-matching phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W3016863638,"MAGEL2 encodes the L2 member of the MAGE (melanoma antigen) protein family. Protein truncating mutations in MAGEL2 cause Schaaf-Yang syndrome, and MAGEL2 is one of a small set of genes deleted in Prader-Willi syndrome. Excessive daytime sleepiness, night-time or early morning waking, and narcoleptic symptoms are seen in people with Prader-Willi syndrome and Schaaf-Yang syndrome, while mice carrying a gene-targeted Magel2 deletion have disrupted circadian rhythms. These phenotypes suggest that MAGEL2 is important for the robustness of the circadian rhythm. However, a cellular role for MAGEL2 has yet to be elucidated. MAGEL2 influences the ubiquitination of substrate proteins to target them for further modification or to alter their stability through proteasomal degradation pathways. Here, we characterized relationships among MAGEL2 and proteins that regulate circadian rhythm. The effect of MAGEL2 on the key circadian rhythm protein cryptochrome 1 (CRY1) was assessed using in vivo proximity labelling (BioID), immunofluorescence microscopy and ubiquitination assays. We demonstrate that MAGEL2 modulates the ubiquitination of CRY1. Further studies will clarify the cellular role MAGEL2 normally plays in circadian rhythm, in part through ubiquitination and regulation of stability of the CRY1 protein."
https://openalex.org/W3016287857,"Introduction The contribution of high tuberculosis (TB) transmission pockets in propagating area-wide transmission has not been adequately described in Zimbabwe. This study aimed to describe the presence of hotspot transmission of TB cases in Harare city from 2011 to 2012 using geospatial techniques. Methods Anonymised TB patient data stored in an electronic database at Harare City Health department was analysed using geospatial methods. Confirmed TB cases were mapped using geographic information system (GIS). Global Moran’s I and Anselin Local Moran’s I (LISA) were used to assess clustering and the local Getis-Ord Gi* was used to estimate hotspot phenomenon of TB cases in Harare City for the period between 2011 and 2012. Results A total of 12,702 TB cases were accessed and mapped on the Harare City map. In both 2011 and 2012, ninety (90%) of cases were new and had a high human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/TB co-infection rate of 72% across all suburbs. Tuberculosis prevalence was highest in the Southern district in both 2011 and 2012. There were pockets of spatial distribution of TB prevalence across West South West, Southern, Western, South Western and Eastern health districts. TB hot spot occurrence was restricted to the West South West, parts of South Western, Western health districts. West South West district had an increased peri-urban population with inadequate social services including health facilities. These conditions were conducive for increased intensity of TB occurrence, a probable indication of high transmission especially in the presence of high HIV co-infection. Conclusions and recommendations Increased TB transmission was limited to a health district with high informal internal migrants with limited health services in Harare City. To minimise spread of TB into greater Harare, there is need to improve access to TB services in the peri-urban areas."
https://openalex.org/W3016372722,"Background Malaria in pregnancy remains a major public health problem especially in sub-Saharan Africa. In malaria endemic areas, majority of pregnant women may remain asymptomatic but still associated with complications on the mother and her foetus. They also serve as reservoirs and act as transmitters of infection. Despite these effects, the prevalence of asymptomatic Plasmodium species infections among pregnant women attending antenatal care has not been yet studied at the study area. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of asymptomatic Plasmodium species infections among pregnant women attending antenatal care at Fendeka town health facilities. Methods Health facility based cross -sectional study was conducted from February to March 2019. A total of 331 participants were enrolled by using convenient sampling technique. Socio-demographic and associated factors were collected by a face to face interview. All the 331 samples were tested using rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and microscopy. However, only 83 dried blood spot (DBS) samples out of 331 participants, were collected by using systematic random sampling technique for molecular analysis. Data was analysed using SPSS version 20. Descriptive statistics were used to determine the prevalence of asymptomatic Plasmodium species infections. Univariate logistic regression was employed to assess factors associated with asymptomatic Plasmodium species infection. Variables with P-value < 0.25 in the univariate logistic regression were selected for multivariate logistic regression analysis model. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated and P- values < 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. Results Overall, 37 (11.2%) asymptomatic Plasmodium species infections were detected using: RDTs, microscopy and real-time PCR altogether. The asymptomatic Plasmodium species infection prevalence was 17 (5.1%), 30 (9.1%) and 15(18.1%) using RDTs, microscopy and real-time PCR, respectively. Asymptomatic Plasmodium species infections were more likely to occur in primigravida (AOR: 4.51, 95% CI: 1.27–16.03), secundigravida (AOR: 3.87, 95% CI: 1.16–12.93), rural inhabitants (AOR: 4.51, 95% CI: 1.72–11.84) and in participants who did not use indoor residual spray (IRS) for the last one year (AOR: 3.13, 95% CI: 1.47–6.66). Conclusions The prevalence of asymptomatic Plasmodium species infection was 11.2%. Pregnant women who reside in the rural area, primigravidae, secugravidae and those who did not utilize indoor residual spray for the last one year were at high risk of infection. Therefore, routine laboratory diagnosis of asymptomatic Plasmodium species infection among pregnant women should be adopted as a part of the antenatal care."
https://openalex.org/W3016459516,"Background New-born survival is a prominent goal on the global health agenda and an important area of focus for programs seeking to ensure child survival. Geographically, neonatal deaths are most prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia, accounting for 39% and 38% of all neonatal deaths respectively while Ethiopia in particular has 28% neonatal death. Promotion of essential new-born care practice is one of a cheap approach to improve health outcomes of new-born babies. Thus, this study was aimed to assess the magnitude of essential new-born care practices and associated factors among postnatal mothers in Nekemte city, Western Ethiopia. Methods An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from February to March, 2017, in Nekemte city, East Wollega Zone. Data was collected from 417 randomly selected mothers who have less than six months infants by face to face interview in three public health institutions of Nekemte City, Ethiopia. Women who were not biological mother to the new-born were excluded from the study. The collected data were coded, cleaned and entered using Epi-Data version 3.1 and analysed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 21.0. Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis were computed to identify associated factors. The strength of association was measured by odds ratios with 95% confidence interval (CI) at a p-value of < 0.05 and finally obtained results were presented by using simple frequency tables, graphs, and charts. Results The study revealed that the level of essential new-born care practice was 184(44.1%). The overall safe cord care practice of the respondents was 285 (68.3%) while the optimal thermal care practices and good neonatal feeding were 328 (78.7%) and 322 (77.2%) respectively. Having visit to Antenatal Care (ANC) [Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 4.38, 95% CI = (1.38, 13.94)], knowledge of essential new-born care [AOR = 4.58, 95% CI = (2.93, 7.16)], and counselled about essential new-born care [AOR = 2.32, 95% CI = (1.38, 3.91)] were factors significantly associated with good practices of essential new-born care. Conclusion This study indicated that the level of essential new-born care practice was unsatisfactory in the study area. Promotion of essential new-born care through the provision of community awareness and provision of counselling on essential new-born care and neonatal danger signs to all pregnant women should be given emphasis."
https://openalex.org/W3016481007,"We studied the relationship between body morphometric traits, and their underlying association with milk production (MP), lactation length (LL), first calving interval (FCI) and subsequent calving interval (CI) of crossbred progeny of Murrah × Jafarabadi buffalo aiming to assist in selection programs. We carried out principal component analysis (PCA) of the body morphometric traits, which include breast width (BW), thigh width (THW), hip width (HW), rump width (RW), rump length (RL), body depth (BD), body length (BL), height withers (HEW), rear height (RH), shoulder width (SW), thorax width (TW), loin width (LW), distance from the head to ischium (DHI), and thoracic perimeter (TP). We determined the association of morphometric traits with milk/reproduction traits using canonical correlation analysis (CCA). The analysis revealed that the first six PCA accounted for 82.14% of the total observed variation, and the traits THW, HW, TW, LW, RW, HEW, TP, RH, and BW, accounted for almost half (48.00%) of the total variance indicating a higher contribution in body structural conformation. The first canonical function was significant (p<0.05), accounted for 72.46% of the total variance, and the canonical correlation was 0.56, indicating the dependence between both groups of traits. Higher canonical loadings were obtained for LL (0.49), FCI (0.46), BW (-0.71), BL (-0.56), DHI (-0.34), HEW, (-0.38) and TP (-0.50). These traits were most important for the derivation of canonical statistical variables, and presented a higher canonical correlations (r) between the dependent (LL/FCI) and independent (BW, BL, DHI, HEW and TP) groups. The results could suggest that the body morphometric traits THW, HW, TW, LW, RW, HEW, BD, TP, RH, and BW could play important role in body structural composition, indicating a suitable functional type, and aid designing of selection programs for buffalo breeding."
https://openalex.org/W3017231176,"We aimed to investigate the association of various obesity parameters and phenotypes with hypertension in nationally representative Korean adults. Among adults aged 19 years and older who participated in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2008–2010, a total of 16,363 subjects (8,184 men and 8,179 women) were analyzed. Hypertension was defined as blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or higher or taking antihypertensive medication. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to estimate multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Higher obesity parameters [body mass index (BMI) representing general obesity, waist circumference (WC) representing central obesity, and percentage body fat (PBF) representing elevated body fat] were consistently associated with increased odds of prevalent hypertension (OR, 7.54; 95% CI, 5.89–9.65 for BMI ≥30 vs. 18.5–23; OR, 3.97; 95% CI, 3.41–4.63 for WC ≥95 cm in males and ≥90 cm in females vs. <85 cm in males and <80 cm in females; OR, 3.56; 95% CI, 3.05–4.15 for PBF, highest vs. lowest quartile; all p trends<0.0001). These associations were stronger in the younger age group (<40 years), and were observed in both sexes. Furthermore, even in individuals with normal BMI (18.5–23), the odds of prevalent hypertension were consistently increased in those with central obesity (WC≥90 cm in males, WC≥80 cm in females; normal weight central obesity phenotype) (OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.63–2.19) and those with high PBF (highest quartile of PBF; normal weight obesity phenotype) (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.25–1.77). These associations were consistent with updated hypertension guidelines in 2017. Obesity may be positively associated with hypertension, regardless of obesity parameters. Even within normal BMI range, high WC and high PBF may be associated with hypertension."

One of the indicators for this objective is the proportion of births attended by skilled health attendants (SBA). This study assessed the progress of low- and middle-income countries from South and Southeast Asian (SSEA) region in SBA coverage and evaluated the contribution of women's education in this progression.The Demographic and Health Surveys were assessed, which included 38 nationally representative surveys on women aged between 15-49 years from 10 selected SSEA region countries in past 30 years. Binary Logistic regression models were fitted adjusting the survey clusters, strata and sampling weights. Meta-analyses were conducted by collapsing effect sizes and confidence intervals of education modeled on SBA coverage.Results indicated that Cambodia, Indonesia and Philippines had over 80% SBA coverage after 2010, whereas Bangladesh and Afghanistan had around 50% coverage. Women with primary, secondary and higher level of education were 1.65, 2.21 and 3.14 times significantly more likely to access SBA care during childbirth respectively as compared to women with no education, suggesting that education is a key factor to address skilled delivery cares in the SSEA region.Evaluation of the existing skilled birth attendance policies at the national level could provide useful insight for the decision makers to improve access to skilled care at birth by investing on women's education in remote and rural areas."
https://openalex.org/W3016380543,"The proline-specific enzymes dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), prolylcarboxypeptidase (PRCP), fibroblast activation protein α (FAP) and prolyl oligopeptidase (PREP) are known for their involvement in the immune system and blood pressure regulation. Only very limited information is currently available on their enzymatic activity and possible involvement in patients with sepsis and septic-shock. The activity of the enzymes was measured in EDTA-plasma of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU): 40 septic shock patients (sepsis-2) and 22 ICU control patients after major intracranial surgery. These data were used to generate receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. A survival analysis (at 90 days) and an association study with other parameters was performed. PRCP (day 1) and PREP (all days) enzymatic activities were higher in septic shock patients compared to controls. In contrast, FAP and DPP4 were lower in these patients on all studied time points. Since large differences were found, ROC curves were generated and these yielded area under the curve (AUC) values for PREP, FAP and DPP4 of 0.88 (CI: 0.80–0.96), 0.94 (CI: 0.89–0.99) and 0.86 (CI: 0.77–0.95), respectively. PRCP had a lower predicting value with an AUC of 0.71 (CI: 0.58–0.83). A nominally significant association was observed between survival and the DPP4 enzymatic activity at day 1 (p<0.05), with a higher DPP4 activity being associated with an increase in survival. All four enzymes were dysregulated in septic shock patients. DPP4, FAP and PREP are good in discriminating between septic shock patients and ICU controls and should be further explored to see whether they are already dysregulated in earlier stages, opening perspectives for their further investigation as biomarkers in sepsis. DPP4 also shows potential as a prognostic biomarker. Additionally, the associations found warrant further research."
https://openalex.org/W3016548358,"The aim of this study was to determine the effect of autologous serum (AS) eye drops on the density of human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DR-positive epithelial cells and Langerhans cells on the ocular surface of patients with bilateral severe dry eye disease (DED) due to graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) or Sjögren’s syndrome (SS). The study was conducted on 24 patients (48 eyes). AS was applied 6–10 times daily for 3 months together with regular artificial tear therapy. HLA-DR-positive cells were detected by direct immunocytochemistry on upper bulbar conjunctiva imprints obtained before and after treatment. The application of AS drops led to a statistically significant increase in the mean density of aberrant HLA-DR-positive conjunctival epithelial cells (p < 0.05) and HLA-DR-positive Langerhans cells (p < 0.05) in the GvHD group. Aberrant HLA-DR-positive epithelial cells in the SS group were decreased non-significantly. All patients reported a significant decrease in the Ocular Surface Disease Index (p < 0.01), which indicates improvement of the patient’s subjective feelings after therapy. There was an expected but non-significant decrease of aberrant HLA-DR-positive conjunctival epithelial cells in the SS group only. However, the increased density of HLA-DR-positive cells, indicating slight subclinical inflammation, does not outweigh the positive effect of AS in patients with DED from GvHD."
https://openalex.org/W3017198588,"Early detection of obesity-related glomerulopathy in humans is challenging as it might not be detected by routine biomarkers of kidney function. This study’s aim was to use novel kidney biomarkers and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) to evaluate the effect of obesity development and weight-loss on kidney function, perfusion, and injury in dogs. Sixteen healthy lean adult beagles were assigned randomly but age-matched to a control group (CG) (n = 8) fed to maintain a lean body weight (BW) for 83 weeks; or to a weight-change group (WCG) (n = 8) fed the same diet to induce obesity (week 0–47), to maintain stable obese weight (week 47–56) and to lose BW (week 56–83). At 8 time points, values of systolic blood pressure (sBP); serum creatinine (sCr); blood urea nitrogen (BUN); serum cystatin C (sCysC); urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPC); and urinary biomarkers of glomerular and tubular injury were measured. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal perfusion using CEUS were assayed (except for week 68). For CEUS, intensity- and time-related parameters representing blood volume and velocity were derived from imaging data, respectively. At 12–22% weight-gain, cortical time-to-peak, representing blood velocity, was shorter in the WCG vs. the CG. After 37% weight-gain, sCysC, UPC, glomerular and tubular biomarkers of injury, urinary immunoglobulin G and urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, respectively, were higher in the WCG. sBP, sCr, BUN and GFR were not significantly different. After 23% weight-loss, all alterations were attenuated. Early weight-gain in dogs induced renal perfusion changes measured with CEUS, without hyperfiltration, preceding increased urinary protein excretion with potential glomerular and tubular injury. The combined use of routine biomarkers of kidney function, CEUS and site-specific urinary biomarkers might be valuable in assessing kidney health of individuals at risk for obesity-related glomerulopathy in a non-invasive manner."
https://openalex.org/W3017371628,"Resistance genes are an effective means for disease control in plants. They predominantly function by inducing a hypersensitive reaction, which results in localized cell death restricting pathogen spread. Some resistance genes elicit an atypical response, termed extreme resistance, where resistance is not associated with a hypersensitive reaction and its standard defense responses. Unlike hypersensitive reaction, the molecular regulatory mechanism(s) underlying extreme resistance is largely unexplored. One of the few known, naturally occurring, instances of extreme resistance is resistance derived from the soybean Rsv3 gene, which confers resistance against the most virulent Soybean mosaic virus strains. To discern the regulatory mechanism underlying Rsv3-mediated extreme resistance, we generated a gene regulatory network using transcriptomic data from time course comparisons of Soybean mosaic virus-G7-inoculated resistant (L29, Rsv3-genotype) and susceptible (Williams82, rsv3-genotype) soybean cultivars. Our results show Rsv3 begins mounting a defense by 6 hpi via a complex phytohormone network, where abscisic acid, cytokinin, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid pathways are suppressed. We identified putative regulatory interactions between transcription factors and genes in phytohormone regulatory pathways, which is consistent with the demonstrated involvement of these pathways in Rsv3-mediated resistance. One such transcription factor identified as a putative transcriptional regulator was MYC2 encoded by Glyma.07G051500. Known as a master regulator of abscisic acid and jasmonic acid signaling, MYC2 specifically recognizes the G-box motif (""CACGTG""), which was significantly enriched in our data among differentially expressed genes implicated in abscisic acid- and jasmonic acid-related activities. This suggests an important role for Glyma.07G051500 in abscisic acid- and jasmonic acid-derived defense signaling in Rsv3. Resultantly, the findings from our network offer insights into genes and biological pathways underlying the molecular defense mechanism of Rsv3-mediated extreme resistance against Soybean mosaic virus.

https://openalex.org/W3017145928,"Colored wheat is a valuable resource that is rich in anthocyanins and minerals and thus contributes additional nutritional value to a healthy human diet. However, the effects of nitrogen fertilization on anthocyanin content (AC) and the balance between quality and yield still merit discussion. In this study, blue, purple, and common-colored wheat genotypes were used to investigate three nutrient quality traits, seven processing quality traits, three yield traits and seven grain morphology traits at three nitrogen levels in two years to excavate their possible plasticity under low-nitrogen stress and the tradeoffs among these traits. The highest AC was found in the blue genotypes followed by the purple genotypes. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that AC could be significantly increased by reducing N application, especially in the purple genotypes. Therefore, growing colored wheat with low nitrogen input could allow efficient harvesting of grain with higher AC. However, the other nutrient quality traits and most processing quality traits were observed to decrease under low-nitrogen (LN) stress. Additionally, a correlation analysis indicated that the nutrient quality traits had stable tradeoffs with thousand kernel weight at all N levels because of the significantly negative correlations among them. Therefore, the additive main effect and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) model was used to further identify the most suitable colored genotypes with the best yield potential and also nutrient quality relative characteristics under LN stress. The blue lines Lanmai2999 and purple varieties Zhongkezinuomai 168 were found to be specifically adapted to LN stress with the highest AC values and showed stable performance in the other nutrient quality- and yield-related features. To further investigate the possible mechanism of anthocyanin accumulation in response to reduced N application, the expression of four genes (TaCHS, TaFDR, TaCHI and TaANS) involved in the anthocyanin synthesis pathway was evaluated. All four genes were downregulated under high nitrogen fertilizer application, indicating that anthocyanin synthesis in colored wheat might be inhibited by nitrogen fertilizer. Therefore, this research provided information for optimizing nitrogen fertilizer management in producing colored wheat and also demonstrated that it is efficient and economical to plant colored wheat genotypes in nitrogen-poor areas for use in a healthy human diet, improving the benefits of wheat planting and facilitating nitrogen pollution control."

The large eggs of Chinese oak silkworm, Antheraea pernyi, are one of the best alternative host for mass production of Trichogramma. However, they are considered poor host for the growth and development of T. leucaniae. Here, we determine the feasibility of successive rearings of T. leucaniae on the large eggs for eight generations and evaluated their capacity of parasitizing SPB eggs of different ages. In the first four generations, the suitability of T. leucaniae reared on large eggs exhibited a significant increasing tendency and then decreased with the successive generations thereafter. The percentage of parasitized eggs and number of emerged adults per egg were increased from 40.0% and 10.8 adults/egg in F1 generation to 86.7% and 36.4 adults/egg in F4 generation respectively. In addition, T. leucaniae reared on A. pernyi for four generations significantly parasitized more SPB eggs regardless of egg age compared with those reared on Corcyra cephalonica eggs. These results provided useful information on the feasibility of mass production of T. leucaniae by reared for successive generations on A. pernyi large eggs."

Therefore, we aimed in the present study to characterize the functional relevance of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated microRNA-21 (miR-21) in regulating bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in a mouse model of aGVHD. We first isolated and cultured BMSCs and Tregs. Then, we examined effects of miR-21 knockdown or overexpression and EGF on cell activities of BMSCs and the expression of PTEN, Foxp3, AKT phosphorylation, and extent of c-jun phosphorylation by gain- and loss-of-function approaches. The results showed that miR-21 promoted the proliferation, invasion, and migration of BMSCs. Furthermore, miR-21 in BMSCs-derived exosomes inhibited PTEN, but enhanced AKT phosphorylation and Foxp3 expression in Tregs. In addition, EGF enhanced c-jun phosphorylation to elevate the miR-21 expression. Furthermore, EGF significantly increased the efficacy of BMSCs in a mouse model of aGVHD, manifesting in reduced IFN-γ expression and lesser organ damage. Moreover, EGF treatment promoted the Foxp3 expression of Tregs in BMSCs-treated aGVHD mice. Taken together, EGF induced the BMSCs-derived exosomal miR-21 expression, which enhanced Foxp3 expression in Tregs, thereby improving the therapeutic effect of BMSCs on aGVHD."

We demonstrate the occurrence of recurrent behavior in the infected number [more than one peak in a season], which is observed in data, in our simulations for populations consisting of cohorts with strong intra- and weak inter-cohort transmissibility. We examine the dependence of the results on epidemiological and population characteristics by investigating their dependence on a range of parameter values. Finally, we study infection with two strains of influenza, inspired by observations, and show a counter-intuitive result for the effect of inoculation against the strain that leads to the first wave of infection."
https://openalex.org/W3017204083,"The primary aim of this study was to extend existing theory on the relationship between chance-level performance and the number of alternatives and trials in closed-set, forced-choice speech audiometry and sound localization methods. When calculating chance performance for closed-set, forced-choice experiments with multiple trials, the binomial distribution should be preferred over the simple 1/a probability, as the latter is appropriate only for single trial experiments. The historical use of constant hit rates for determining chance performance has been based upon the assumption that random hits are distributed evenly across multiple trials. For any closed-set, forced-choice task with 2 to 10 alternatives and 2 to 100 trials, we calculated the probability of obtaining any given hit rate due to random guessing alone according to the binomial distribution. Hit rates with probabilities p > 0.05 were interpreted as being likely to occur due to random chance alone, whereas hit rates with probabilities of p ≤ 0.05 were interpreted as being unlikely to occur due to chance alone. For sound localization experiments with speakers at fixed positions, the expected probability of a random hit was also calculated using the binomial distribution. The expected angular root mean square (rms) error in sound localization resulting from the random selection of sound sources was investigated using Monte Carlo simulations. A new aspect in the interpretation of test results was identified for situations in which the observed number of hits is much lower than would be expected due to chance alone. For test methods incorporating a relatively low number of alternatives and a sufficiently high, yet clinically feasible, number of trials, both upper and lower thresholds for chance-level performance could be identified. This lower threshold represents the lowest hit rate which can be expected through random chance alone. Extending interpretation of results to include this lower threshold affords the ability to not only identify performance significantly superior to that of chance, but also that significantly poorer than chance and thereby represents a simple method for the objective detection of malingering."

The purpose of this study was to conduct a situational analysis to better understand the healthcare provider response to sexual violence in Cape Coast, Ghana.First, an observational facility assessment about healthcare services for survivors of sexual violence was conducted at two hospitals serving university students in Cape Coast, Ghana. Next, healthcare providers at the two hospitals completed: 1) a 113-item questionnaire about healthcare services, knowledge, and attitudes related to sexual violence and 2) in-depth semi-structured interviews describing their experiences providing healthcare to survivors of sexual violence. Descriptive statistics and frequencies were computed, and thematic analysis was used to analyze the qualitative data.Both sites lacked supplies, including pre-packed rape kits, post-exposure HIV prophylaxis, and informational handouts on medications and support services for survivors. Further, healthcare providers lacked training on gender-based violence, including best practices for caring for survivors and evidence collection procedures. Providers described the clinical management for survivors of sexual violence, including providers' role in reporting sexual violence to authorities, medical forensic exams, reproductive and sexual health services, and referral for mental healthcare. Finally, providers described a number of barriers to survivors accessing post-assault healthcare, including stigma and structural barriers, such as cost of medical supplies and lack of privacy within the healthcare facilities.The current healthcare response to sexual violence in Ghana is limited by lack of supplies, knowledge, and training for healthcare providers. Personal and structural barriers may prevent survivors from accessing needed healthcare following sexual violence."

However, targeting these cancer drivers frequently fail to demonstrate sustained cancer remission. Tumor heterogeneity and evolution contribute to cancer resistance and pose challenges for cancer therapy due to differential genomic rearrangement and expression driving distinct tumor responses to treatments. Here we report that intratumor heterogeneity of Wnt/β-catenin modulator δ-catenin controls individual cell behavior to promote cancer. The differential intratumor subcellular localization of δ-catenin mirrors its compartmentalization in prostate cancer xenograft cultures as result of mutation-rendered δ-catenin truncations. Wild-type and δ-catenin mutants displayed distinct protein interactomes that highlight rewiring of signal networks. Localization specific δ-catenin mutants influenced p120ctn-dependent Rho GTPase phosphorylation and shifted cells towards differential bFGF-responsive growth and motility, a known signal to bypass androgen receptor dependence. Mutant δ-catenin promoted Myc-induced prostate tumorigenesis while increasing bFGF-p38 MAP kinase signaling, β-catenin-HIF-1α expression, and the nuclear size.

Using linear regression, tooth wear explained 54.5% of the variation in the ages of the riverine subjects (p<0.001). This coefficient is mid-way between those obtained in semi-isolated indigenous populations (65-86%) and urban subjects (12%) living in the Amazon.

As expected, results from structural equation modeling revealed that autonomous motivation was more specific to the situational level than controlled motivation. Moreover, results showed that the more specific the regulations are, the more relationships with students’ grades can be found. Therefore, this study offers a new understanding of previous results between autonomous and controlled regulations with grades and of the relationships between academic self-concepts, academic achievement and motivation."

To avoid cross-contamination of aerosols, a closed independent isothermal amplification tube (IAT) was used to perform the assays. Optimal amplification conditions for IMSA and CPA were selected for specificity and sensitivity, respectively, and for clinical relevance. Both IMSA and CPA assays could specifically recognize all 3-STa positive strains in which they fluoresced green under UV light, but not in the 11 non-STa strains. The results of the sensitivity analysis indicated that the detection limit of the IMSA assay was 1.5 ×102 CFU, comparable to real-time PCR, but 10-fold more sensitive than CPA and LAMP. Further evaluation of the detection methods of swine diarrhea samples demonstrated that both could successfully identify the DNA of STa-producing ETEC in clinical specimens, consistent with LAMP and qPCR methods. The results demonstrated that the IMSA and CPA methods had high specificity and sensitivity with rapid detection of ETEC, so having great potential in clinical applications."
https://openalex.org/W3017028598,"Background Numerous studies have shown that specific components of breast milk, considered separately, are associated with disease status in the mother or the child using univariate analyses. However, very few studies have considered multivariate analysis approaches to evaluate the relationship between multiple breast milk components simultaneously. Aim Here we aimed at visualizing breast milk component complex interactions in the context of the allergy status of the mother or the child. Methods Milk samples were collected from lactating mothers participating in the Leipziger Forschungszentrum für Zivilisationskrankheiten (LIFE) Child cohort in Leipzig, Germany. A total of 156 breast milk samples, collected at 3 months after birth from mother/infant pairs, were analyzed for 51 breast milk components. Correlation, principal component analysis (PCA) and graphical discovery analysis were used. Result Correlations ranging from 0.40 to 0.96 were observed between breast milk fatty acid and breast milk phospholipids levels and correlations ranging from 0 to 0.76 between specific human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) were observed. No separation of the data based on the risk of allergy in the infants was identified using PCA. When graphical discovery analysis was used, dependencies between maternal plasma immunoglobulin E (IgE) level and the breast milk immune marker transforming growth factor-beta 2 (TGF-ß2), between TGF-ß2, breast milk immunoglobulin A (IgA) and TGF-ß1 as well as between breast milk total protein and birth weight were observed. Graphical discovery analysis also exemplifies a possible competition for the fucosyl group between 2’FL, LNFP-I and 3’FL in the HMO group. Additionally, dependencies between immune component IgA and specific HMO (6’SL and blood group A antigen tetraose type 5 or PI-HMO) were identified. Conclusion Graphical discovery analysis applied to complex matrices such as breast milk composition can aid in understanding the complexity of interactions between breast milk components and possible relations to health parameters in the mother or the infant. This approach can lead to novel discoveries in the context of health and diseases such as allergy. Our study thus represents the first attempt to visualize the complexity and the inter-dependency of breast milk components."
https://openalex.org/W3017058341,"Atrial septal defect (ASD) is one of the most common congenital heart defects diagnosed in children. Sarcomeric genes has been attributed to ASD and knockdown of MYH3 functionally homologues gene in chick models indicated abnormal atrial septal development. Here, we report for the first time, a case-control study investigating the role of MYH3 among non-syndromic ASD patients in contributing to septal development. Four amplicons which will amplifies the 40 kb MYH3 were designed and amplified using long range-PCR. The amplicons were then sequenced using indexed paired-end libraries on the MiSeq platform. The STREGA guidelines were applied for planning and reporting. The non-synonymous c. 3574G>A (p.Ala1192Thr) [p = 0.001, OR = 2.30 (1.36–3.87)] located within the tail domain indicated a highly conserved protein region. The mutant model of c. 3574G>A (p.Ala1192Thr) showed high root mean square deviation (RMSD) values compared to the wild model. To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide compelling evidence on the pathogenesis of MYH3 variants towards ASD hence, suggesting the crucial role of non-synonymous variants in the tail domain of MYH3 towards atrial septal development. It is hoped that this gene can be used as panel for diagnosis of ASD in future."
https://openalex.org/W3016660997,"Traditionally, subgroup analyses are used to assess whether patient characteristics moderate treatment effectiveness with general disregard for issues of multiplicity. Using data from The Action for Health in Diabetes (Look AHEAD) trial in the United States, we aim to identify a subgroup where all of its types of members experience a treatment benefit defined as reducing the likelihood of a major cardiovascular event under an intensive lifestyle and weight-loss intervention. We apply the credible subgroups method to a Bayesian logistic model with a conservative prior that is sceptical of large treatment effect heterogeneity. The covariate profiles for which there is sufficient evidence of treatment benefit are, coarsely, middle-aged women, in poor subjective general health and with moderately to poorly controlled diabetes. There is at least 80% posterior probability that the conditional average treatment effect is positive for all covariate profiles fitting this description, which account for 0.5% of trial participants. Conversely, the covariate profiles that are likely to be associated with no benefit are middle aged and older men in excellent subjective general health, with well-controlled diabetes. These profiles apply to less than 2% of trial participants. More information is required to determine treatment benefit or no benefit for the remainder of the trial population."
https://openalex.org/W3016974480,"Background Media reporting on communicable diseases has been demonstrated to affect the perception of the public. Communicable disease reporting related to foreign-born persons has not yet been evaluated. Objective Examine how political leaning in the media affects reporting on tuberculosis (TB) in foreign-born persons. Methods HealthMap, a digital surveillance platform that aggregates news sources on global infectious diseases, was used. Data was queried for media reports from the U.S. between 2011–2019, containing the term “TB” or “tuberculosis” and “foreign born”, “refugee (s),” or “im (migrants).” Reports were reviewed to exclude duplicates and non-human cases. Each media source was rated using two independent media bias indicators to assess political leaning. Forty-six non-tuberculosis reports were randomly sampled and evaluated as a control. Two independent reviewers performed sentiment analysis on each report. Results Of 891 TB-associated reports in the US, 46 referenced foreign-born individuals, and were included in this analysis. 60.9% (28) of reports were published in right-leaning news media and 6.5% (3) of reports in left-leaning media, while 39.1% (18) of the control group reports were published in left- leaning media and 10.9% (5) in right-leaning media (p < .001). 43% (20) of all study reports were posted in 2016. Sentiment analysis revealed that right-leaning reports often portrayed foreign-born persons negatively. Conclusion Preliminary data from this pilot suggest that political leaning may affect reporting on TB in US foreign-born populations. Right-leaning news organizations produced the most reports on TB, and the majority of these reports portrayed foreign-born persons negatively. In addition, the control group comprised of non-TB, non-foreign born reports on communicable diseases featured a higher percentage of left-leaning news outlets, suggesting that reporting on TB in foreign-born individuals may be of greater interest to right-leaning outlets. Further investigation both in the U.S. and globally is needed."
https://openalex.org/W3016570594,"The study of molecular dynamics simulations is largely facilitated by analysis and visualization toolsets. However, these toolsets are often designed for specific use cases and those only, while scripting extensions to such toolsets is often exceedingly complicated. To overcome this problem, we designed a software application called AViS which focuses on the extensibility of analysis. By utilizing the dataflow programming (DFP) paradigm, algorithms can be defined by execution graphs, and arbitrary data can be transferred between nodes using visual connectors. Extension nodes can be implemented in either Python, C++, and Fortran, and combined in the same algorithm. AViS offers a comprehensive collection of nodes for sophisticated visualization state modifications, thus greatly simplifying the rules for writing extensions. Input files can also be read from the server automatically, and data is fetched automatically to improve memory usage. In addition, the visualization system of AViS uses physically-based rendering techniques, improving the 3D perception of molecular structures for interactive visualization. By performing two case studies on complex molecular systems, we show that the DFP workflow offers a much higher level of flexibility and extensibility when compared to legacy workflows. The software source code and binaries for Windows, MacOS, and Linux are freely available at https://avis-md.github.io/."
https://openalex.org/W3017333733,"Low-intensity training involving high repetitions is recommended to enhance muscular endurance. Hyperoxic conditions could increase the number of repetitions until exhaustion and thereby improve the results of muscular endurance training. This study aimed to investigate the acute effects of hyperoxia on dynamic muscular endurance, and determine individual factors that may be related to these effects. A single-blinded, counterbalanced crossover design was used. Twenty-five young men performed repetitions of the one-arm preacher curl at 30% of their 1-repetition maximum until exhaustion under hyperoxic and normoxic conditions. The maximum number of repetitions was recorded as an index of muscular endurance. Electromyogram (EMG) and near-infrared spectroscopy parameters were measured in the biceps brachii. The maximum number of repetitions was greater (P < 0.001) under hyperoxic conditions (132 ± 59 repetitions) than under normoxic conditions (114 ± 40 repetitions). The root mean square amplitude of EMG and oxygenated hemoglobin concentration for the last five repetitions under normoxic conditions were greater than those under hyperoxic conditions (P = 0.015 and P = 0.003, respectively). The percent change in the maximum number of repetitions between hyperoxic and normoxic conditions had significant positive correlations with individual maximal oxygen uptake measured using an incremental cycle ergometer test (r = 0.562, 95% confidence intervals [CI] = 0.213-0.783, P = 0.003), but not with muscle strength (τ = -0.124, 95% CI = -0.424-0.170, P = 0.387). The 95% CI for the correlation coefficient between the percent change in the maximum number of repetitions and muscular endurance included 0 (τ = 0.284, 95% CI = -0.003-0.565, P = 0.047); this indicated no significant correlation between the two parameters. The results suggest that hyperoxia can acutely enhance dynamic muscular endurance, with delayed elevation of EMG amplitude due to fatigue, and the effects are associated with individual whole-body endurance capacity."
