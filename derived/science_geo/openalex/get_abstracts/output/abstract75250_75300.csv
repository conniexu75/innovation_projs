https://openalex.org/W2112675547,"Abstract Glycogen phosphorylase has been purified from rabbit liver by a simplified procedure which depends on the initial separation of the enzyme from a crude extract by centrifuging it as a complex with particulate glycogen. Initial rates have been measured with varied concentrations of both substrates in each reaction direction. The data were analyzed with double reciprocal plots and secondary plots of intercepts and slopes to yield the eight Dalziel kinetic coefficients. Inhibition by uridine diphosphoglucose is competitive with glucose 1-phosphate and inorganic orthophosphate. With the latter substrate the Ki at high glycogen concentration is 0.4 mm and at low glycogen concentration it is 0.2 mm. Consideration of the relationships among the Dalziel kinetic coefficients, various related kinetic constants, the Haldane relationship, and the patterns of inhibition by UDP-glucose has led to a tentative assignment of a kinetic mechanism which involves random order of substrate addition to enzyme, with rapid equilibria compared to a rate-limiting interconversion of ternary complexes. On the basis of this tentative kinetic mechanism, the kinetically derived dissociation constants for glycogen, Pi, and glucose-1-P from the free enzyme are 14, 11, and 1.3 mm, respectively. Dissociation constants were also deduced for glycogen and the enzyme-Pi complex (0.93 mm); glycogen and the enzyme-glucose-1-P complex (2.9 mm); Pi and the enzyme-glycogen complex (0.82 mm); and glucose-1-P and the enzyme-glycogen complex (0.28 mm). Some of these differences were rationalized by suggesting a glucose-binding site adjacent to a phosphate-binding site, both of which are occupied by glucose-1-P in one case or by the terminal glucose of glycogen and by Pi. Increasing the concentration of Pi or glucose-1-P decreases the apparent Km for glycogen, while increasing the concentration of glycogen decreases the apparent Km values for either of the other two substrates. Adenosine 5'-phosphate decreases the apparent Km values for all three substrates. The apparent Km for AMP is 6 x 10-5 m at 24 mm glucose-1-P and 10 x 10-5 m at 8 mm glucose-1-P. The apparent Km values and dissociation constants for glycogen and liver phosphorylase are of the same order of magnitude as those commonly found for the muscle phosphorylases. The apparent Km values of glucose-1-P and Pi are less than those found for the muscle enzymes, and this is paralleled by smaller Ki values for inhibition by a variety of naturally occurring organic phosphates and pyrophosphates. Alteration of the groups on the glucose moiety of various phosphate compounds decreases binding to the active center with an order of importance of C-4 g C-6 g C-2."
https://openalex.org/W1482173162,"Abstract l-Tryptophan administered to normal or adrenalectomized rats inhibits formation of glycogen from pyruvate, aspartate, or malate and from endogenous sources under the influence of hydrocortisone, but not from glucose or glycerol. The site of inhibition was located by determining the concentration of hepatic metabolites in fasted, normal rats and in fasted, adrenalectomized rats treated with tryptophan as compared with untreated control animals. Administration of tryptophan was found to cause rapid accumulation of lactate, pyruvate, citrate, aspartate, malate, and oxalacetate to 5 to 35 times normal concentrations. Phosphoenolpyruvate and all succeeding intermediates toward glycogen were decreased to one-half of normal concentrations or less. These data indicate that, following tryptophan administration, gluconeogenesis is blocked because phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase is nonfunctional. The accumulation of citrate, aspartate, and especially of malate in livers of rats given tryptophan supports the proposal that these compounds are intermediates in the conversion of pyruvate to phosphopyruvate. Tryptophan is a useful tool for studying the process of gluconeogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1846822997,"Abstract The pathways of serine biosynthesis utilizing either phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated intermediates have been investigated in a variety of tissues from different species of animals. The levels of activity of hydroxypyruvate phosphate:l-glutamate and hydroxypyruvate:l-alanine transaminases were determined, and their distribution was compared with that previously reported for d-glycerate 3-O-phosphate and d-glycerate dehydrogenases. Direct comparisons were made between the extent of the over-all conversion of d-glycerate to serine and of d-glycerate 3-O-phosphate to serine 3-O-phosphate catalyzed by liver preparations from six species. Additional studies were carried out on the specificity of the amino donor participating in transamination reactions with hydroxypyruvate in different tissues. The results indicate that although both pathways are functional in animal systems, the relative contribution by each pathway for the synthesis of serine is not the same for all tissues. For example, in dog and frog liver, the major pathway for the formation of this amino acid involves nonphosphorylated intermediates. In these two tissues, as well as in rabbit liver, it has been clearly shown that the amino donor for hydroxypyruvate transamination is alanine. Glutamine has been demonstrated to be the most effective amino donor for this reaction in rat kidney and liver. In contrast to these results, serine formation in beef and chicken liver has been shown to take place primarily by the phosphorylated pathway. In other tissues, e.g. pig liver and dog kidney, considerable serine biosynthesis occurs by both the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated routes."
https://openalex.org/W1525056371,"Abstract The activity coefficients of thymine, adenine, cytosine, deoxyadenosine, and adenosine have been determined in aqueous salt solutions from solubility measurements at 25.0°. The large differences in activity coefficients which are observed with different salts are mainly due to the anions, and the order of effectiveness of different salts on all of the bases is nearly the same. There is a good correlation between the effects of concentrated salt solutions on the activity coefficients of the bases and their effects on the denaturation of deoxyribonucleic acid. Salts which cause large decreases in the activity coefficients, or increase in the solubility, of the bases (the sodium salts of Cl3CCOO-, SCN-, ClO4-, and I-) are potent denaturants of DNA. Cations, including (CH3)4N+, have only small effects on the bases corresponding to their lack of effectiveness in denaturation. These results indicate that the denaturation of DNA by these concentrated salt solutions can be accounted for by their effects on the activity coefficients of the bases, and is attributable to the greater degree of exposure of the bases to solvent in denatured DNA than in the native form. The mechanism of the activity coefficient effects is not known but they cannot be explained by salt effects on the activity of water, by electrostatic effects of the Debye-Kirk-wood type, by effects on the internal pressure of the solvent, or by effects on the cavity formation energy of Sinanoglu and Abdulnur. In addition there is no correlation between the effects of salts on the bases and their effects on the structure of water as reflected by the viscosity B coefficients and the partial molal entropy of ions and other parameters. It is suggested, but not proved, that anions which decrease the activity coefficient of the bases may do so by a direct interaction of anions with the polar groups in the bases."
https://openalex.org/W1648461994,"Abstract 1. The portion of brain metabolism involving glutamate, aspartate, glutamine, glutathione, γ-aminobutyric acid, Krebs cycle intermediates, and related substances has been simulated with a digital computer. This involves the interaction of a complex metabolic pattern with a complex compartmentation. A model has been constructed from 49 differential equations representing 49 (unlabeled) chemical species, and its behavior has been compared, with generally satisfactory agreement, with experimental data obtained from administration of several 14C-labeled tracers and intravenous infusion of large doses of 15NH3. 2. Most of the substances and pathways involved in the model are divided between a large and a small compartment (except glutamine and ammonia). The large compartment contains 4 to 10 times as much as the small compartment of nearly all divided substances; but the Krebs cycle flux and hence the number of mitochondria are about equally divided between the compartments. Radioactivity from 14C-glucose first appears mostly in the large compartment, and ordinarily most CO2 fixation to oxalacetate takes place there; but high ammonia levels stimulate fixation of CO2 into the small compartment, together with an efflux of glutamine from the brain. 3. On the basis of the rates at which they metabolize possible energy sources, such as glucose, and their response to ammonia intoxication, it is suggested that the compartments serve as a homeostatic mechanism to protect part of the brain against fluctuations in environment. 4. Based on known biochemical properties, an identification with these compartments of several cytological structures is suggested: the small compartment contains the nerve ending fraction and some glial cells; the large compartment includes most of the neuron bodies and glial cells, particularly astroglia. 5. A number of experiments suggested by the model are described, mostly to check the identification of the nerve ending fraction as part of the small compartment (e.g. by following CO2 fixation in vitro). Some are to check theories relating to this area of metabolism, such as a possible neurotransmitter action of γ-aminobutyric acid."

The activity in liver tissue increased from 3 days before birth to a maximum in the 10-day-old animal and then declined to adult levels between 35 and 45 days. No observed rise in transferase activity occurred in gut and kidney from term until 10 days with a subsequent decrease until 35 days. Adult rat brain and diaphragm were also examined for enzyme activity. By comparison at any age, liver had a consistently higher enzyme rate than any of the other tissues studied, and brain had the lowest in the adult tissues studied. The enzyme activity in liver of female adult rats was significantly lower than in the same aged male animals. By differential centrifugation, transferase from newborn and adult rat liver was located entirely in the soluble fraction. The enzyme in newborn liver was 3 times more active and had Vmax values 3 times greater than in the adult liver, but the enzyme from both preparations had the same (a) stability characteristics, (b) Km values for galactose-1-P (1.39 x 10-4 m ) and for UDP-glucose (1.56 x 10-4 m ), (c) pH optimum (8.3 to 8.6), and (d) sulfhydryl requirements. In addition, both enzyme preparations utilized UDP-galactose as a substrate with galactose-1-P with the same Km (1.67 x 10-4 m ), and neither was as sensitive to inhibition by this substrate as with galactose-1-P or UDP-glucose. The enzyme from both sources was more sensitive to UDP-glucose inhibition than galactose-1-P inhibition, but the enzyme from newborn liver was 3 times less sensitive to inhibition by either of these substrates than the enzyme from adult liver. Glucose-1-P caused marked inhibition of the enzyme from the adult liver."

Normal males and females increase saliva-spreading with increasing ambient temperatures. Rats recovered from lateral hypothalamic lesions do not spread saliva in the heat, confirming the inference drawn from studies of their drinking behavior that their saliva production is severely impaired. Recovered lateral rats do produce saliva when injected with pilocarpine. The failure to salivate is, therefore, a result of the lateral hypothalamic lesions and is not due to an incompetence of the glands."
https://openalex.org/W1566829633,"The effect of (-)-carnitine on the conversion of citrate-1-14C and pyruvate-2-14C to 14CO2 and either 14C-fatty acids or 14C-acetylsulfanilamide was studied in pigeon liver homogenates. Carnitine stimulated the conversion of pyruvate-2-14C to fatty acids and acetylsulfanilamide, but had no effect on citrate. In the fasted state both fatty acid synthesis and citrate cleavage enzyme activity were decreased, whereas the conversion of pyruvate-2-14C to 14C-acetylsulfanilamide and carnitine acyltransferase activity were increased. (+)-Carnitine, a competitive inhibitor of carnitine acyltransferase, decreased the conversion of pyruvate-2-14C to 14C-acetylsulfanilamide. It was concluded from calculations of 14CO2 and 14C-fatty acids derived from citrate-1-14C and pyruvate-2-14C that the major pathway of supply of acetyl groups to the extramitochondrial portion of the cell is an indirect one via citrate and the citrate cleavage enzyme, but that a direct pathway via carnitine acyltransferase does exist. A role of carnitine acyltransferase in biological acetylations is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W68206323,"Abstract Procedures are described for the isolation of the phosphoglucomutases of flounder and shark muscle. Like the rabbit muscle enzyme, these exhibit a molecular weight of about 63,000 by ultracentrifugal and phosphate analysis, require α-d-glucose 1,6-diphosphate and Mg++ for activity, are stimulated by preincubation with imidazoles and Mg++, and are phosphorylated by glucose 1,6-diphosphate and dephosphorylated by α-d-glucose 1-phosphate. Unlike rabbit muscle phosphoglucomutase, the flounder and shark enzymes are extremely labile below pH 5.0 and at pH 7.4 exhibit a significant level of glucose 1,6-diphosphatase activity. The activity of the flounder enzyme is doubled by formation of 1 mole of mercaptide of p-mercuribenzoate per mole of enzyme. Long after the reaction catalyzed by rabbit enzyme has come to thermodynamic equilibrium, the phosphate of glucose diphosphate fails to achieve isotopic equilibrium with that of the glucose monophosphates. The flounder P-glucomutase system behaves similarly, but isotopic equilibrium is achieved somewhat more rapidly than with the rabbit enzyme."

The conversion of 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triol-26-oicacid to 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,24ξ-tetraol-26-oic acid I was catalyzed by rat liver mitochondria supplemented with 105,000 x g supernatant fraction, adenosine triphosphate, MgCl2, flavin adenine dinucleotide, and coenzyme A. Cell fractionation and requirement of cofactors for the same reaction were examined. 5β-Cholestane-3α,7α,12α,24ξ-tetraol-26-oic acid I which was derived from the incubation of 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triol-26-oic acid was further oxidized to cholic acid with 105,000 x g supernatant fraction of rat liver, ATP, MgCl2, glutathione, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, and CoA.

https://openalex.org/W1569564160,"Abstract Insulin does not modify the low levels of liver adenosine triphosphate:hexose phosphotransferase attained in rats fed a carbohydrate-free diet, nor does insulin accelerate the induction of phosphotransferase by glucose, indicating that endogenous hormone is sufficient. Glucagon prevents the induction of ATP:hexose phosphotransferase, and this effect is not counteracted by an excess of insulin. A small dose of glucagon that has only a slight effect on phosphotransferase induction causes a definite glycogenolysis in the liver. Furthermore, certain observations on the levels of liver glycogen in animals receiving insulin indicate that secretion of glucagon secondary to insulin hypoglycemia does not interfere seriously with enzyme induction. A hypothesis is presented in an attempt to understand the interplay of different factors affecting ATP:hexose phosphotransferase activity in liver. Glucose and glucagon are considered as inducer and repressor, respectively. Insulin might be a permissive agent, probably acting at the inner membranes of liver cells."
https://openalex.org/W2028808115,"PREVIOUS reports1,2 have indicated that sialic acid in human, wax-stimulated saliva is rapidly released and metabolized by the oral flora. Heat (100°, 5 min), or antibiotic, prevents both these reactions from taking place. Further investigations have now shown that the other sugars associated with the salivary glycoproteins (3 hexoses, 2 hexosamines and fucose) are all spontaneously lost from saliva by bacterial action, and this loss may also be prevented by either heat or antibiotics. Wax-stimulated saliva contains, with the exception of fucose, all these sugars in two distinct forms: those in the salivary glycoproteins and those in the many and varied bacteria (108/ml.) also present in the saliva. Many of the bacteria in the saliva contain rhamnose, a 6-deoxy-hexose of the same group of sugars as fucose, but it is possible to distinguish between these two sugars by either paper or thin-layer chromatography3. By this method it was shown that the 6-deoxyhexoses in freshly collected, wax-stimulated saliva consisted of rhamnose and fucose. It was also shown that, on incubation, the saliva rapidly lost all its fuoose and sialic acid, while the rhamnose remained. The hexoses and hexosamines, however, occurred in the salivary glycoproteins and the bacteria, and it was not possible to distinguish between these sources by direct analysis or by chromatography. On incubating wax-stimulated saliva, 50–70 per cent of the hexoses and hexosamines were lost, but it was not possible in this instance to distinguish whether the remaining sugar was derived from the salivary glycoproteins or from the bacteria. If the saliva was collected directly from the salivary ducts (parotid, submaxillary and sublingual) and pooled, there were now present so few bacteria that all the sugars from the glycoproteins remained intact on incubation and the saliva remained clear and viscous. The addition of bacteria, in the form of dental plaque or salivary sediment, to the viscous duct saliva caused a rapid loss of sugars, a drop in viscosity and the formation of a precipitate. After incubation no fucose or sialic acid was present and the amount of residual sugars was approximately equal to that from the added bacteria. In none of the experiments described here has it been possible to detect any but traces of free sugars in the saliva when bacteria have been present, and these sugars were also rapidly metabolized when added in a free state to the saliva. It is thus apparent that the carbohydrate components of the glycoproteins in saliva are labile in the oral environment and are rapidly released and metabolized by bacterial action. The loss of these sugars, particularly sialic acid, provides an explanation for the observed drop in viscosity and formation of a precipitate that occurs spontaneously in wax-stimulated saliva1,2. Previous suggestions that the drop in viscosity is due to a mucinolytic depolymerization of the salivary glycoproteins4 are valid so far as the viscosity-drop is concerned, but this mechanism should produce a product of increased solubility, and, in fact, a heavy precipitate always appears concomitantly with the drop in viscosity. It is tempting to postulate that this is the mechanism whereby the material from the saliva forms a matrix holding together the many bacteria adjacent to the teeth, which is commonly referred to as dental plaque. Support for this is found in the observation that dental plaque is practically devoid of both sialic acid and fucose (< 0.002 per cent), the two essential sugar constituents of salivary glycoproteins that can be identified as belonging exclusively to the glycoproteins and not to the oral bacteria."

https://openalex.org/W1584002812,"Abstract Intact beef heart mitochondria having high acceptor control ratios catalyze an oligomycin-sensitive adenosine diphosphate-ATP exchange reaction in the presence of 6.0 mm Mg++ at a rate of about 400 to 600 mµmoles per min per mg of mitochondrial protein, or somewhat higher than the rate of oxidative phosphorylation in beef heart mitochondria. The oligomycin-sensitive component of the total ADP-ATP exchange activity is saturated with Mg++ at much lower concentrations (∼1.0 mm) than the oligomycin-insensitive component (∼8.0 mm). Gramicidin, valinomycin, aurovertin, azide, arsenate, and atractyloside inhibit the ADP-ATP exchange, to an extent not exceeding the inhibition by oligomycin, whereas the adenylate kinase activity is insensitive to these agents. Beef heart mitochondria also catalyze uridine diphosphate-UTP, cytidine diphosphate-CTP, guanosine diphosphate-GTP, and ADP-dCTP exchanges, but these are insensitive to oligomycin and occur at less than 10% of the rate of the ADP-ATP exchange. Freezing and thawing of beef heart mitochondria, which has been reported not to cause loss of oxidative phosphorylation as measured by the P:O ratio, caused loss of the oligomycin-sensitive ADP-ATP exchange, loss of acceptor control of respiration, and gain of ATPase activity. It is suggested that the loss of oligomycin-sensitive ADP-ATP exchange activity during preparation of phosphorylating submitochondrial particles is caused by a molecular transformation of the ATP-synthesizing system so that the affinity for ADP is decreased, with a resulting gain of ATPase activity."

https://openalex.org/W2104940732,"The effects of insulin added in vitro on the metabolic fates of uniformly labeled glucose-14C in slices of rat interscapular brown adipose tissue were studied. Insulin strongly stimulated glucose uptake, lactate production, oxygen consumption, total carbon dioxide production, and conversion of uniformly labeled glucose-14C into fatty acids, glyceride-glycerol, carbon dioxide, and total lipids. Fatty acid synthesis from extracellular glucose was particularly sensitive to insulin and was stimulated approximately 60-fold by addition of this hormone. The insulin concentration required for half-maximal stimulation of net gas exchange was in the general range of estimated plasma insulin concentrations. The rate of fatty acid synthesis from extracellular glucose by brown adipose tissue slices under maximal stimulation by insulin was found to be lower by several-fold than that of white adipose tissue of similar rats, when the comparison is made per unit weight of lipid-free dry tissue. It is suggested that this may at least partially account for the relatively low content of stored triglycerides which characterizes brown adipose tissue in vivo. Although the stimulation of oxygen consumption in white adipose tissue by insulin has recently been quantitatively accounted for in terms of the necessity to reoxidize excess pyridine nucleotides generated during the passage of glucose through the pentose phosphate shunt and conversion of glucose to fatty acids, this explanation does not in its simplest form account adequately for the stimulation of oxygen consumption in brown adipose tissue by insulin. Certain apparent advantages are enumerated which seem to make attractive the use of brown adipose tissue for further study of the primary chemical mechanism of action of insulin."
https://openalex.org/W30813776,"Abstract Unlike ferrihemoglobin (Hb+), denatured carbonylhemoglobin (COHb) has almost the same absorption spectrum in the visible and near ultraviolet region as the native form; the very slight difference appears only in the Soret band. Kinetic and equilibrium experiments under anaerobic conditions show that COHb is considerably more resistant to acid denaturation at 25° than is Hb+ although the rates of denaturation of both proteins depend on pH in much the same way. These conclusions are based on assays of denatured protein by precipitation at the isoionic point, by the measurements of unmasking of imidazole groups inaccessible in the native protein, and by changes in optical rotatory dispersion. Air, when present, oxidizes the denatured protein practically instantaneously, but it has no discernible effect on the denaturation rate. It does, however, predictably shift the equilibria by removing the initial product, unoxidized acid-denatured protein. COHb, unlike Hb+, is not stabilized by formate, but another stabilizer of Hb+, azide, produces complex effects. Bromphenol blue greatly accelerates the rate of denaturation and shifts the denaturation equilibrium to higher pH. The possible significance of the absence of a marked spectral change is discussed in terms of a possible nonbonded clathrate structure for the prosthetic group in COHb. Changes in the Cotton effects in the Soret band differ in acid-denatured COHb and Hb+, and there are differences in the regenerability of the denatured proteins. These facts add support to the evidence that conformation differences exist in the native forms; thus the difference in stability between COHb and Hb+ need not be solely the direct consequence of the positive charge on the prosthetic group of the latter as previously postulated."

https://openalex.org/W1492598933,Abstract The succinate oxidase activity of Mycobacterium phlei was sensitive to irradiation with light at 360 mµ. The loss of activity was due to a lesion occurring in the electron transport chain between the flavoprotein and cytochrome b regions. The activity lost was not restored by addition of vitamin K1 or other cofactors but could be restored by the addition of the supernatant fraction. The factor responsible for the restoration of the succinate chain has been purified. It was sensitive to heat and irradiation and appeared to be protein in nature. It activated both oxidation and phosphorylation in irradiated particulate systems. The proteins which restored the two activities could not be separated.

At pH 4.5 all of the sulfhydryl groups of human hemoglobin react with peroxyacetyl nitrate, whereas at pH 7.2 the reaction is slower and is limited to two to three sulfhydryls per mole of hemoglobin. Ribonuclease in the reactive form is not inactivated by peroxyacetyl nitrate even when the oxidant is in 300-fold molar excess. Amino acid analysis of the protein shows a decrease in cystine and increase in cysteic acid. Reduced ribonuclease is prevented from regaining activity if exposed to peroxyacetyl nitrate in the sulfhydryl form. The inactivation of papain by peroxyacetyl nitrate depends on the amount of free protein sulfhydryl at the time of gas exposure."

The pyrimidine rings of uracil, uridine, and pseudouridine serve equally well as precursors of the pyrimidine component of uridine and pseudouridine of ribonucleic acid. The ribosyl moiety of uridine labels the ribosyl portions of RNA uridine and RNA pseudouridine equally. Although the latter was not degraded to establish unequivocally that uridine ribosyl is present in pseudouridine ribosyl, the equivalence of specific activities and the evidence of the presence of precursor uridine ribosyl in the uridine of the RNA make it appear that the uridine-pseudouridine interconversion takes place by an intramolecular rearrangement and not principally through a free uracil or diribosyluracil intermediate. Although some transribosylation involving purine and pyrimidine ribosyl moieties and some formation of RNA pyrimidine ribosyl from glucose were observed, these appear to be of secondary importance. The data are consistent with, but do not prove, a rearrangement of pyrimidine nucleosides at the polynucleotide level."

Catalytic hydrogenation of the product resulted in the reduction of the polyisoprenoid side chain as well as debenzylation. Substantial reduction was also observed with the use of nuclear magnetic resonance for a number of naturally occurring quinones with conditions recommended for quinol phosphate synthesis. Previous studies with the use of reductive debenzylation with naturally occurring quinones did not consider this possibility. The double bond β,γ to the quinonoid ring was found to be more resistant to reduction, and the degree of saturation of the side chain could be partially controlled. The results of biological incorporation experiments carried out with quinol phosphates prepared by this route need to be interpreted in terms of these results. They are particularly relevant to the presumed participation of the isoprenoid double bond β,γ to the quinonoid ring in oxidative phosphorylation."

Evidence is accumulating that this cell releases its granules containing histamine and heparin in the presence of an antigen and a reactive antibody. These morphological changes of degranulation, however, are not specific nor limited to the allergic state. Certain drugs may induce similar degranulation in the complete absence of any sensitivity3. The investigation reported here extends our view of the role of this cell, since it shows that, in man, acute heat stress also induces the morphological changes of degranulation in the circulating basophil."
