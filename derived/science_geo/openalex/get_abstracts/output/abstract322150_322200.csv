In addition, the nature of the medium in which the cells were previously grown, the time permitted for incubation of the cells in the test medium, and the presence of substances or conditions which may specifically introduce the need for certain molecules to preserve balance can strongly influence nutritional requirements. This great versatility may reflect the ability of the mammalian cell to assume different metabolic states characteristic of specific types of differentiation. Under certain conditions, growth of single HeLa cells of the S3 clonal strain requires the presence of cholesterol at a level of 0.5 to 1 microgram per milliliter."
