Based on sequence homology to murine and human sphingosine kinase-1 (SPHK1), which we recently cloned (Kohama, T., Oliver, A., Edsall, L., Nagiec, M. M., Dickson, R., and Spiegel, S. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 23722–23728), we have now cloned a second type of mouse and human sphingosine kinase (mSPHK2 and hSPHK2). mSPHK2 and hSPHK2 encode proteins of 617 and 618 amino acids, respectively, both much larger than SPHK1, and though diverging considerably, both contain the conserved domains found in all SPHK1s. Northern blot analysis revealed that SPHK2 mRNA expression had a strikingly different tissue distribution from that of SPHK1 and appeared later in embryonic development. Expression of SPHK2 in HEK 293 cells resulted in elevated SPP levels. d-erythro-dihydrosphingosine was a better substrate than d-erythro-sphingosine for SPHK2. Surprisingly, d,l-threo-dihydrosphingosine was also phosphorylated by SPHK2. In contrast to the inhibitory effects on SPHK1, high salt concentrations markedly stimulated SPHK2. Triton X-100 inhibited SPHK2 and stimulated SPHK1, whereas phosphatidylserine stimulated both type 1 and type 2 SPHK. Thus, SPHK2 is another member of a growing class of sphingolipid kinases that may have novel functions.

Intracellular SPP, in turn, mobilizes calcium from internal stores independently of inositol triphosphate (11.Meyer zu Heringdorf D. Lass H. Alemany R. Laser K.T. Neumann E. Zhang C. Schmidt M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 2910-2916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Moreover, competitive inhibitors of SPHK block the formation of SPP and selectively inhibit calcium mobilization, cellular proliferation, and survival induced by these various stimuli (reviewed in Ref. 1.Spiegel S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been suggested that the dynamic balance between levels of the sphingolipids metabolites, ceramide and SPP, and consequent regulation of opposing signaling pathways, is an important factor that determines the fate of cells (19.Cuvillier O. Rosenthal D.S. Smulson M.E. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2910-2916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). For example, stress stimuli increase ceramide levels leading to apoptosis, whereas survival factors stimulate SPHK leading to increased SPP levels, which suppress apoptosis (19.Cuvillier O. Rosenthal D.S. Smulson M.E. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2910-2916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Moreover, the SPHK pathway, through the generation of SPP, is critically involved in mediating tumor necrosis factor-α-induced endothelial cell activation (12.Xia P. Gamble J.R. Rye K.A. Wang L. Hii C.S.T. Cockerill P. Khew-Goodall Y. Bert A.G. Barter P.J. Vadas M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14196-14201Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), and the ability of high density lipoproteins to inhibit cytokine-induced adhesion molecule expression has been correlated with its ability to reset this sphingolipid rheostat (12.Xia P. Gamble J.R. Rye K.A. Wang L. Hii C.S.T. Cockerill P. Khew-Goodall Y. Bert A.G. Barter P.J. Vadas M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14196-14201Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). This has important implications for the protective function of high density lipoproteins against the development of atherosclerosis and associated coronary heart disease. Recent data have also connected the sphingolipid rheostat to allergic responses (20.Prieschl E.E. Csonga R. Novotny V. Kikuchi G.E. Baumruker T. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Interest in SPP has accelerated recently with the discovery that it is a ligand of the G protein-coupled cell surface receptor EDG-1 (17.Van Brocklyn J.R. Lee M.J. Menzeleev R. Olivera A. Edsall L. Cuvillier O. Thomas D.M. Coopman P.J.P. Thangada S. Hla T. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 21.Lee M.J. Van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). This rapidly led to the identification of several other related receptors, named EDG-3, -5, -6, and -8, which are also specific SPP receptors (reviewed in Refs. 2.Goetzl E.J. An S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar and 22.Spiegel S. Milstien S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Sphinganine-1-phosphate, which is structurally similar to SPP and only lacks the trans double bond at the 4 position, but not lysophosphatidic acid or sphingosylphosphorylcholine, also binds to these receptors (23.Van Brocklyn J.R. Tu Z. Edsall L.C. Schmidt R.R. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4626-4632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), demonstrating that EDG-1 belongs to a family of G protein-coupled receptors that bind SPP with high affinity and specificity (reviewed in Refs. 2.Goetzl E.J. An S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar and 22.Spiegel S. Milstien S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The EDG-1 family of receptors are differentially expressed, mainly in the cardiovascular and nervous systems, and are coupled to a variety of G proteins and thus can regulate diverse signal transduction pathways culminating in pleiotropic responses depending on the cell type and relative expression of EDG receptors. Although the biological functions of the EDG-1 family of G protein-coupled receptors are not completely understood, recent studies suggest that binding of SPP to EDG-1 stimulates migration and chemotaxis (24.Wang F. Van Brocklyn J.R. Hobson J.P. Movafagh S. Zukowska-Grojec Z. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Biol.

Cell. 1999; 99: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). EDG-5 may play a role in cytoskeletal reorganization during neurite retraction, which is important for neuronal differentiation and development (23.Van Brocklyn J.R. Tu Z. Edsall L.C. Schmidt R.R. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4626-4632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 28.MacLennan A.J. Marks L. Gaskin A.A. Lee N. Neuroscience. 1997; 79: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Critical evaluation of the role of SPP requires cloning of the enzymes that regulate its metabolism. Recently, we purified rat kidney SPHK to apparent homogeneity (29.Olivera A. Kohama T. Tu Z. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12576-12583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and subsequently cloned the first mammalian SPHK, designated mSPHK1 (30.Kohama T. Olivera A. Edsall L. Nagiec M.M. Dickson R. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23722-23728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Independently, two genes, termed LCB4 and LCB5, were also shown to code for SPHKs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (31.Nagiec M.M. Skrzypek M. Nagiec E.E. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19437-19442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Moreover, data base searches identified homologues of mSPHK1 in numerous widely disparate organisms, including worms, plants, and mammals, demonstrating that the enzyme is encoded by a member of a highly conserved gene family (30.Kohama T. Olivera A. Edsall L. Nagiec M.M. Dickson R. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23722-23728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences of the known SPHK1s revealed five blocks of highly conserved amino acids (30.Kohama T. Olivera A. Edsall L. Nagiec M.M. Dickson R. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23722-23728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). However, several lines of evidence indicate that there may be multiple mammalian SPHK isoforms. The finding that SPHK activity in platelets could be chromatographically fractionated into several forms with differing responses to detergents and inhibition by known SPHK inhibitors suggested the presence of multiple enzyme forms in human platelets (32.Banno Y. Kato M. Hara A. Nozawa Y. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Moreover, homology searches against a comprehensive nonredundant data base revealed that several of the expressed sequence tags (dbEST) at NCBI had significant homology to conserved domains of mSPHK1 (30.Kohama T. Olivera A. Edsall L. Nagiec M.M. Dickson R. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23722-23728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), yet they had substantial sequence differences. Thus, we embarked on an effort to clone other SPHK isoforms. We report here the cloning, functional characterization, and tissue distribution of a second type of mammalian SPHK (SPHK2) that has distinct sequence, properties, and tissue distribution. SPP, sphingosine, andN,N-dimethylsphingosine were from Biomol Research Laboratory Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). All other lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Poly-l-lysine and collagen were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN). Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Poly(A)+ RNA blots of multiple mouse adult tissues were purchased fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). LipofectAMINE PLUS and LipofectAMINE were from Life Technologies, Inc. BLAST searches of the EST data base identified a mouse EST clone (GenBankTM accession number AA839233), which had significant homology to conserved domains of mSPHK1 (30.Kohama T. Olivera A. Edsall L. Nagiec M.M. Dickson R. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23722-23728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) yet had substantial sequence differences. Using this EST, a second isoform of SPHK, denoted mSPHK2, was cloned by two different PCR approaches. In the first, we used the method of PCR cloning from a mouse cDNA library (Stratagene). Approximately 1 × 106phages were plated on twenty 150-mm plates, plaques were collected, and plasmids were isolated using standard procedures (33.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley-Interscience, New York1987: 9.1.4-9.9.1Google Scholar). An initial PCR reaction was carried out with a sequence specific primer (M-3–1, 5′-CCTGGGTGCACCTGCGCCTGTATTGG) and the M13 reverse primer. The longest PCR products were gel-purified and used as the template for a second PCR, which contained a sequence-specific antisense primer (M-3–2, 5′-CCAGTCTTGGGGCAGTGGAGAGCC-3′) and the T3 primer. The final PCR products were subcloned by TOPO TA cloning (Invitrogen) and then sequenced. Platinum high fidelity DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used for the PCR amplifications with the following cycling parameters: 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 2 min with a final primer extension at 72 °C for 5 min. In a second approach, 5′-RACE PCR was performed with the 5′-RACE System for rapid amplification of cDNA ends according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts using a Quick Prep mRNA purification kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). First strand cDNA was synthesized at 42 °C for 50 min with 5 μg of Swiss 3T3 poly(A)+ RNA using a target antisense primer designed from the sequence of AA839233 (m-GSP1, 5′-AGGTAGAGGCTTCTGG) and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Two consecutive PCR reactions using this cDNA as a template and LA Taq polymerase (TaKaRa) were carried out as follows: first PCR, 94 °C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min, and primer extension at 72 °C for 5 min with 5′-RACE Abridged Anchor Primer, 5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACGGGIIGGGIIGGGIIG and the target-specific antisense primer m-GSP2, 5′-GCGATGGGTGAAAGCTGAGCTG; second PCR, same conditions except that the annealing temperature was 65 °C, with Abridged Universal Amplification Primer, 5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTAC and m-GSP3, 5′-AGTCTCCAGTCAGCTCTGGACC. PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1 and sequenced, and final PCR products were subcloned into pCR3.1 and pcDNA 3 expression vectors. Poly(A)+ RNA from HEK293 cells was used for a 5′-RACE reaction. Target-specific antisense primers (h-GSP1, 5′-CCCACTCACTCAGGCT; h-GSP2, 5′-GAAGGACAGCCCAGCTTCAGAG; h-GSP3, 5′-ATTGACCAATAGAAGCAACC) were designed according to the sequence of a human EST clone (accession number AA295570). First strand cDNA was synthesized with 5 μg of HEK293 mRNA and h-GSP1. This cDNA was used as a template in an initial PCR reaction using 5′-RACE Abridged Anchor Primer and h-GSP2. Then, nested PCR was carried out using the Abridged Universal Amplification Primer and h-GSP3. The resulting PCR products were cloned and sequenced as described above. HEK293 cells (ATCC CRL-1573) and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (ATCC CRL-1658) were cultured as described previously (34.Olivera A. Kohama T. Edsall L.C. Nava V. Cuvillier O. Poulton S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 545-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were seeded at 6 × 105/well in poly-l-lysine-coated 6-well plates. After 24 h, cells were transfected with 1 μg of vector alone or with vectors containing sphingosine kinase constructs and 6 μl of LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent plus 4 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent/well. 1–3 days after transfection, cells were harvested and lysed by freeze-thawing as described previously (30.Kohama T. Olivera A. Edsall L. Nagiec M.M. Dickson R. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23722-23728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). In some experiments, cell lysates were fractionated into cytosol and membrane fractions by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. SPHK activity was determined in the presence of sphingosine, prepared as a complex with 4 mg/ml BSA and [γ-32P]ATP in kinase buffer (35.Olivera A. Spiegel S. Bird I.M. Methods in Molecular Biology. 105. Humana Press Inc., Totawa, NJ1998: 233-242Google Scholar) containing 200 mm KCl, unless indicated otherwise. 32P-SPP was separated by TLC and quantified with a phosphoimager as described previously (30.Kohama T. Olivera A. Edsall L. Nagiec M.M. Dickson R. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23722-23728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in 1 ml of methanol containing a 2.5-μl conc. HCl. Lipids were extracted by adding 2 ml of chloroform, 1 m NaCl (1:1, v/v) and 100 μl of 3N NaOH, and the phases were separated. The basic aqueous phase containing SPP, and devoid of sphingosine, ceramide, and the majority of phospholipids, was transferred to a siliconized glass tube. The organic phase was re-extracted with 1 ml of methanol, 1 m NaCl (1:1, v/v) plus 50 μl of 3N NaOH, and the aqueous fractions were combined. Mass measurements of SPP in the aqueous phase and total phospholipids in the organic phase were carried out exactly as described (8.Edsall L.C. Pirianov G.G. Spiegel S. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6952-6960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Edsall L.C. Spiegel S. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 272: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA blots containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA/lane from multiple adult mouse and human tissues, and mouse embryos were purchased fromCLONTECH. Blots were hybridized with the 1.2-kbPstI fragment of mouse EST AA389187 (mSPHK1 probe), the 1.5-kb EcoRI fragment of pCR3.1-mSPHK2, the 0.3-kbPvuII fragment of pCR3.1-hSPHK1, or the 0.6-kbEcoRV-SphI fragment of human EST AA295570 (hSPHK2 probe), after gel-purification and labeling with [α-32P]dCTP. Hybridization in ExpressHyb buffer (CLONTECH) at 65 °C overnight was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol. Blots were reprobed with β-actin as a loading control (CLONTECH). Bands were quantified using an imaging analyzer (BAS2000, Fuji film). Blast searches of the EST data base identified several ESTs that displayed significant homology to our recently cloned mSPHK1 sequence (30.Kohama T. Olivera A. Edsall L. Nagiec M.M. Dickson R. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23722-23728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Specific primers were designed from the sequences of these ESTs and were used to clone a new type of mouse and human SPHK (named mSPHK2 and hSPHK2) by the approaches of PCR cloning from a mouse brain cDNA library and 5′-RACE PCR. ClustalW alignment of the amino acid sequences of mSPHK2 and hSPHK2 is shown in Fig. 1 A. The open reading frames of mSPHK2 and hSPHK2 encode polypeptides of 617 and 618 amino acids, respectively, with 83% identity and 90% similarity. Five highly conserved regions (C1–C5), identified previously in SPHK1s (30.Kohama T. Olivera A. Edsall L. Nagiec M.M. Dickson R. Spiegel S. J. Biol.

Interestingly, the invariant GGKGK positively charged motif in the C1 domain of SPHK1 is modified to GGRGL in SPHK2, suggesting that it may not be part of the ATP binding site as previously proposed (30.Kohama T. Olivera A. Edsall L. Nagiec M.M. Dickson R. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23722-23728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). A motif search also revealed that a region beginning just before the conserved C1 domains of mSPHK2 and hSPHK2 (amino acid 147–284) also has homology to the diacylglycerol kinase catalytic site. Compared with SPHK1, both SPHK2s encode much larger proteins containing 236 additional amino acids (Fig. 1 B). Moreover, their sequences diverge considerably from SPHK1 in the center and at the amino termini. However, after amino acid 140 of mSPHK2, the sequences of type 1 and type 2 mSPHK have a large degree of similarity. These sequences (amino acids 9–226 for mSPHK1 and 141–360 for mSPHK2), which encompass domains C1–C4, have 47% identity and 79% similarity (Fig. 1 B). In the carboxyl-terminal portion of the proteins there are also large homologous regions, which include the C5 domain, from amino acids 227–381 for mSPHK1 and 480–617 for mSPHK2, with 43% identity and 78% similarity (Fig. 1 B). The overall divergence suggests that SPHK2 probably did not arise as a simple gene duplication event. The tissue distribution of SPHK2 mRNA expression in adult mouse was compared with that of SPHK1 by Northern blotting (Fig.2 A). In most tissues, including adult liver, heart, kidney, testis, and brain, a predominant 3.1-kb SPHK2 mRNA species was detected, indicating ubiquitous expression. However, the level of expression was markedly variable and was highest in adult liver and heart and barely detectable in the skeletal muscle and spleen (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, the expression pattern of mSPHK1 is quite different, with highest mRNA expression of a 2.2-kb transcript in adult lung, spleen, and liver, although expression in liver does not predominate as with mSPHK2. mSPHK1 and mSPHK2 were both temporally and differentially expressed during embryonic development. mSPHK1 was expressed highly at mouse embryonic day 7 and decreased dramatically after embryonic day 11 (Fig.2 B). In contrast, at embryonic day 7, mSPHK2 expression was much lower than mSPHK1 and gradually increased up to embryonic day 17. The hSPHK2 2.8-kb mRNA transcript was mainly expressed in adult kidney, liver, and brain, with much lower expression in other tissues (Fig. 2 C). Interestingly, expression of SPHK2 in human kidney is very high and relatively much lower in the mouse kidney, whereas the opposite pattern holds for the liver. To investigate whether mSPHK2 and hSPHK2 encode bona fide SPHKs, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors containing the corresponding cDNAs. Because previous studies have indicated that SPHK might be present in cells in both soluble and membrane-associated forms (3.Olivera A. Spiegel S.

As described previously (30.Kohama T. Olivera A. Edsall L. Nagiec M.M. Dickson R. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23722-23728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), untreated or vector-transfected HEK293 cells have low levels of SPHK activity (Fig.3 A). 24 h after transfection with mSPHK2 or hSPHK2, in vitro SPHK activity was increased by 20- and 35-fold, respectively, and then decreased thereafter (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, SPHK activity in cells transfected with mSPHK1 was much higher, 610-fold greater than basal levels 24 h after transfection and remained at this level for at least 3 more days (data not shown). As in HEK293 cells, transfection of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts with mSPHK1 resulted in much higher SPHK activity than with mSPHK2. We previously found that, similar to untransfected cells, the majority of SPHK activity in cells transfected with mSPHK1 was cytosolic (30.Kohama T. Olivera A. Edsall L. Nagiec M.M. Dickson R. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23722-23728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Similarly, in cells transfected with either mSPHK2 or hSPHK2, 17 and 26%, respectively, of the SPHK activity was membrane-associated (Fig. 3 A), although Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy plots did not suggest the presence of hydrophobic membrane-spanning domains. Transfection of HEK293 cells with mSPHK2 and hSPHK2 also resulted in 2.2- and 3.3-fold increases, respectively, in SPP, the product formed by SPHK (Fig. 3 B), in agreement with previous studies of sphingolipid metabolite levels after transfection with mSPHK1, which showed a lack of correlation of fold increases in SPP levels andin vitro SPHK enzyme activity (30.Kohama T.

Although SPHK2 is highly homologous to SPHK1, there are substantial sequence differences. Therefore, it was of interest to compare their enzymatic properties. Typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics were observed for recombinant SPHK2 (data not shown). The K m ford-erythro-sphingosine as substrate is 3.4 μm, almost identical to the K mpreviously found for SPHK1 (29.Olivera A. Kohama T. Tu Z. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12576-12583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Although the naturally occurringd-erythro-sphingosine isomer was the best substrate for SPHK1 (30.Kohama T. Olivera A. Edsall L. Nagiec M.M. Dickson R. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23722-23728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar),d-erythro-dihydrosphingosine was a better substrate for SPHK2 than d-erythro-sphingosine (Fig. 4 A). Moreover, althoughd,l-threo-dihydrosphingosine and phytosphingosine were not phosphorylated at all by SPHK1, they were significantly phosphorylated by SPHK2, albeit much less efficiently than sphingosine. Like SPHK1, other lipids includingN,N-dimethylsphingosine (DMS), C2- or C16-ceramide, diacylglycerol, or phosphatidylinositol, were not phosphorylated by SPHK2 (Fig. 4 A), suggesting high specificity for the sphingoid base. DMS and threo-DHS have previously been shown to be potent competitive inhibitors of SPHK1 (40.Edsall L.C. Van Brocklyn J.R. Cuvillier O. Kleuser B. Spiegel S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12892-12898Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and have been used to block increases in intracellular SPP levels resulting from various physiological stimuli (3.Olivera A.

However, becausethreo-DHS is a substrate for SPHK2, it is not useful as a tool to investigate the role of SPHK2/SPP signaling. Thus, it was important to characterize the inhibitory potential of the nonsubstrate DMS on SPHK2. Surprisingly, we found that although DMS was also a potent inhibitor of SPHK2 (Fig. 4 B), it acted in a noncompetitive manner (Fig. 4, C and D). TheK i for DMS with SPHK2 was 12 μm, slightly higher than the K i of 4 μmwith SPHK1, suggesting that it can be used to inhibit both types of SPHK. mSPHK2 had highest enzymatic activity in the neutral pH range from 6.5 to 8 with optimal activity at pH 7.5 (Fig.5 A), a pH dependence similar to that of SPHK1 (data not shown). The activity decreased markedly at pH values below and above this range. Most of the SPHK activity in human platelets is membrane-associated and extractable with 1 mNaCl (32.Banno Y. Kato M. Hara A. Nozawa Y. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the salt extractable SPHK from platelets has different properties than the cytosolic enzyme. It was thus of interest to determine the effect of high salt concentrations on recombinant SPHK1 and SPHK2. Interestingly, we found that high ionic strength had completely opposite effects on their activities. SPHK1 was markedly inhibited by either NaCl and KCl, with each causing 50% inhibition at a concentration of 200 mm (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, SPHK2 activity was dramatically stimulated by increasing the salt concentration, with a maximal effect at a concentration of 400 mm, although KCl was much more effective than NaCl. However, above this concentration, SPHK2 activity decreased sharply although remaining elevated even at 1 m salt (Fig.5 C). Kinetic analysis of mSPHK2 in the presence and absence of high concentrations of salt indicated that the K mfor sphingosine was unaltered, whereas the V maxwas increased (Fig. 5, D and E). The physiological significance of these observations remains to be determined but it could be related to different subcellular localizations of the two types of SPHK. Because sphingolipids are highly lipophilic, in in vitro SPHK assays, sphingosine is usually presented in micellar form with Triton X-100 or as a complex with BSA (42.Olivera A. Rosenthal J. Spiegel S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 60: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 43.Olivera A. Barlow K.D. Spiegel S. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 311: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Furthermore, detergents such as Triton X-100 have been shown to stimulate the activity of SPHK in rat brain extracts (37.Buehrer B.M. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3154-3159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the enzyme from rat kidney (29.Olivera A. Kohama T. Tu Z. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12576-12583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), and we previously found that the stability of rat kidney SPHK was increased in the presence of certain detergents (29.Olivera A. Kohama T. Tu Z. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12576-12583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). However, when the effect of increasing concentrations of Triton X-100 on the activities of SPHK1 and SPHK2 were compared, some unexpected results were found. Concentrations of detergent up to 0.005% had no effect, but at higher concentrations, SPHK2 activity was inhibited and SPHK1 activity was markedly stimulated (Fig.6 A). At a concentration of Triton X-100 of 0.5%, SPHK1 activity was increased by more than 4-fold, whereas SPHK2 was almost completely inhibited. Thus, Triton X-100 could be used to differentially determine SPHK1 and SPHK2 activities in tissues or cells that express both types. Interestingly, increasing the BSA concentration from our usual SPHK assay conditions with sphingosine-BSA complex as substrate,i.e. 0.2 mg/ml BSA, caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of SPHK2 activity without affecting SPHK1 activity (Fig. 6 B). Therefore, when measuring SPHK activity in cell or tissue extracts, the method of substrate presentation, whether in mixed micelles or in BSA complexes, must be carefully optimized because the differential effects of Triton X-100 and BSA on activity could yield different results depending on the relative expression of the two types of SPHK. Acidic phospholipids, particularly phosphatidylserine, phosphatidic acid, and phosphatidylinositol, and cardiolipin to a lesser extent, induced a dose-dependent increase in SPHK activity in Swiss 3T3 fibroblast lysates, whereas neutral phospholipids had no effect (42.Olivera A. Rosenthal J. Spiegel S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 60: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In agreement, the enzymatic activity of recombinant SPHK1 and SPHK2 was stimulated by phosphatidylserine; the activity of both was maximally increased 4-fold at a concentration of 40 μg/ml (Fig. 6 C) and inhibited by higher concentrations in a dose-dependent manner. These effects of phosphatidylserine appeared to be specific because other phospholipids, including phosphatidylcholine, had no effect on the enzyme activity. In contrast, the activities of the three major forms of SPHK in human platelets were not affected by phosphatidylserine (32.Banno Y. Kato M. Hara A. Nozawa Y. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which phosphatidylserine enhances the enzymatic activity of SPHK is not yet understood. One possibility is that phosphatidylserine possesses unique membrane-structuring properties, which better present the substrate, sphingosine. A second possibility is that SPHK contains determinants that specifically recognize the structure of the serine headgroup and that these determinants may only become exposed upon interaction of SPHK with membranes. In this regard, the molecular basis for the remarkable specificity of protein kinase C for phosphatidylserine has been the subject of much debate. However, recent data reveal that lipid structure and not membrane structure is the major determinant in the regulation of protein kinase C by phosphatidylserine (44.Johnson J.E. Zimmerman M.L. Daleke D.L. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12020-12025Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The presence of multiple ESTs in the data base with significant homologies to SPHK1 as well as the identification of several genes inS. cerevisiae encoding different SPHKs (31.Nagiec M.M. Skrzypek M. Nagiec E.E. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19437-19442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) suggested that there may be a large and important SPHK gene family. In this study, we have cloned and characterized a second type of SPHK that has some unique properties. Although SPHK2 has a high degree of homology to SPHK1, especially in the previously identified conserved domains identified in type 1 SPHKs (30.Kohama T. Olivera A. Edsall L. Nagiec M.M. Dickson R. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23722-23728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), it is much larger (65.2 and 65.6 kDa for hSPHK2 and mSPHK2, respectively, versus 42.4 kDa for mSPHK1) and contains an additional 236 amino acids. Furthermore, its differential tissue expression, temporal developmental expression, cellular localization, and kinetic properties in response to increasing ionic strength and detergents are completely different from SPHK1, suggesting that it most likely has a different function and regulates levels of SPP in a different manner than SPHK1, which is known to play a prominent role in regulating cell growth and survival. Thus, type 2 SPHK might be involved in regulation of some of the numerous biological responses attributed to SPP, such as angiogenesis and allergic responses.

However, the coupling between the signaling cascades of estrogen receptors α and β and the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) is poorly understood. Therefore, we selectively transfected estrogen receptor α or β in COS7 and HEK293 cells, which contain IGF-1R.

Overexpression of dominant negative mitogen-activated protein kinases kinase inhibited this effect.

Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6293) Google Scholar), whereas IGF-1 as a peptide-growth factor binds to a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor, which signals via a series of phosphorylation events (2.Rubin R. Baserga R. Lab. Invest. 1995; 73: 311-331PubMed Google Scholar).Two different estrogen receptors, ERα and ERβ, which are encoded by genes located on different chromosomes, have been identified so far (8.Walter P. Green S. Greene G. Krust A. Bornert J.-M. Waterfield M. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7889-7893Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar,9.Kuiper G.G.J.M. Enmark E.

Sequence analysis demonstrates a high degree of homology between ERα and ERβ in the DNA-binding domain and the ligand-binding domain. However, there are significant differences in regions that would be expected to influence transcriptional activity. The ability of estrogen receptors to activate target gene transcription has been attributed to two regions: the N-terminal activation function 1 (AF-1) and the ligand-dependent AF-2, which is localized in the C-terminal hormone-binding domain (10.Tora L. White J. Brou C. Tasset D. Webster N. Scheer E. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 59: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar, 11.Mosselman S. Polman J. Dijkema R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (2038) Google Scholar). AF-1 and AF-2 can activate transcription independently and synergistically, and they act in a promoter- and cell-specific manner (12.Tzukerman M.T. Esty A. Santiso Mere D. Danielian P. Parker M.G. Stein R.B. Pike J.W. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 13.Jones P.S. Parrott E. White I.N.H. J. Biol.

Metzger D. Bornert J.-M. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1153-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Both AF-1 and AF-2 are required to enhance transcription of target genes through AP-1 sites (15.Webb P. Nguyen P. Valentine C. Lopez G.N. Kwok G.R. McInerney E. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Enmark E. Gustafsson J.A. Nilsson S. Kushner P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1672-1685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, ERα and ERβ act differently at AP-1 sites (16.Paech K. Webb P. Kuiper G.G.J.M. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.A. Kushner P.J. Scanlan T.S. Science. 1997; 277: 1508-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar), which may be due to differences in their AF domains (17.Hall J.M. McDonnell D.P. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5566-5578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ERα and ERβ can form homo- and heterodimers (18.Cowley S.M. Hoare S. Mosselman S. Parker M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 32: 19858-19862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (600) Google Scholar), and thus the tissue-specific distribution of the estrogen receptor subtypes plays an important role in the different responses to 17β-estradiol. ERα appears to play a major role in the regulation of reproductive events. ERα knockout female mice are completely infertile, whereas ERβ knockout mice females display severe but incomplete infertility (19.Warner M. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.A. Curr. Opin. Obstet. Gynecol. 1999; 11: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 20.Ogawa S. Chan J. Chester A.E. Gustafsson J.-A. Korach K.S. Pfaff D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Under pathological conditions such as endothelial denudation of the rat carotid artery ERα mRNA is constitutively expressed, whereas the expression of ERβ mRNA is increased (21.Mäkela S. Savolainen H. Aavik E. Myllärniemi M. Strauss L. Taskinen E. Gustafsson J.-A. Häyry P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7077-7082Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The cross-talk between IGF-1R and estrogen receptor-signaling pathways results in synergistic growth stimulation (22.Aronica S.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol.

The mitogenic response of IGF-1 appears to be initiated by ligand-induced tyrosine autophosphorylation of the IGF-1R, which is important for the selective recruitment of downstream signaling molecules and results in activation of the Ras/Raf/MAPK signaling cascade. Because activation of the estrogen receptors by growth factors like IGF-1 involves the MAPK pathway by direct phosphorylation of AF-1 (5.Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H.

On the other hand, the modulation of IGF-1R and membrane-associated IGF-binding proteins as a response to stimulation by estrogen have been described.

In our understanding of the role and function of estrogen receptors on the cell membrane level two major points deserve further attention: the interaction between estrogen receptors and tyrosine kinase receptor signaling pathways as well as the differences of ERα and ERβ in coupling to the cell membrane.The data presented here contribute new observations to these points by demonstrating that: 1) E2 activates the IGF-1R signaling cascade exclusively via ERα, 2) binding of ERα to the IGF-1R is a potential mechanism for estrogen to activate the IGF-1R, 3) phosphorylation of ERK1/2 is required for binding of ERα to the IGF-1R, and 4) ERα but not ERβ is the target of ligand-independent activation by IGF-1 signal transduction via the MAPK. Rapid, so called nongenomic effects of estrogen, which occur within seconds to minutes, are part of a variety of cellular responses to estrogen. In particular, rapid effects of estrogen on NO release (45.Caulin-Glaser T. Garcia-Gardena G. Sarrel P. Sessa W.C. Bender J.R. Circ.

Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. Metzger D. Chambon P.

MAPKs such as ERKs are important regulators in signaling pathways in response to a wide array of extracellular stimuli. This observation raises the possibility that estrogen receptors can be activated by a number of growth factors using the MAPK pathway. Interestingly, activation of MAPK pathway is also induced by estrogen itself (33.Nuedling S. Kahlert S. Löbbert K. Meyer R. Vetter H. Grohé C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 56.Migliaccio A. Di Domenico M. Green S. DeFalco A. Katjaniak E.L. Blasi F. Chambon P. Auricchio F. Mol.

McDonnell D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4686-4691Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Thus it appears that a feed-forward system exists where E2 activates MAPK, an event that in turn enhances transcriptional activity of the estrogen receptor. In the present study we show that E2-induced MAPK activation is mediated by ERα and does not involve ERβ. We were able to demonstrate that binding of ERα to the IGF-1R depends on MAPKK activity and is induced via the MAPK pathway. As a consequence, the binding of ERα to the transmembrane IGF-1R is regulated by the MAPK pathway under these conditions.In our study we found important differences between the two estrogen receptor subtypes in the ability to interact with the IGF-1 pathway. ERβ was not able to bind to the IGF-1R, and in consequence no phosphorylation and activation of IGF-1R was observed. ERα and ERβ display significant differences in the transcriptional activation of target genes upon stimulation with IGF-1. Treatment with IGF-1 only stimulated transcriptional activity of ERα but not of ERβ in different cell lines such as COS7, HEK293, L6, or R−. These results suggest different regulatory functions of the two estrogen receptor subtypes. The differences may be in part due to different AF-1 domains because ERα reveals constitutive AF-1 activity, whereas ERβ lacks constitutive AF-1 activity (15.Webb P. Nguyen P. Valentine C. Lopez G.N. Kwok G.R. McInerney E. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Enmark E. Gustafsson J.A. Nilsson S. Kushner P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1672-1685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 59.Cowley S.M. Parker M.G. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 69: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that the tissue-specific distribution pattern of ERα and ERβ may be crucial to understand the proliferative response to IGF-1 and E2 in a variety of hormone-dependent malignant diseases.In summary, we were able to demonstrate that after ligand binding and phosphorylation by the MAPK cascade ERα is able to bind to the IGF-1R. This binding induces autophosphorylation of the IGF-1R and thus its activation. IGF-1R activation stimulates MAPKK and consequently phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Activation of ERK1/2 may, in turn, lead to phosphorylation of ERα and provides a possible mechanism for ligand-independent activation of ERα but not of ERβ (Fig.6). Further investigations, however, are required to understand how estrogen and the expression patterns of the two estrogen receptor subtypes as well as IGF-1R signal transduction cooperate in the regulation of growth and differentiation. Estrogen as well as insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)1 are potent mitogens that are involved in a large array of processes that control proliferation and differentiation in mammalian cells (1.Katzenellenbogen B.S. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 2.Rubin R. Baserga R. Lab. Invest. 1995; 73: 311-331PubMed Google Scholar). Both mitogens act through receptor-mediated signaling pathways. The cross-talk between these two signaling pathways is currently under investigation (3.Ignar-Trowbridge D.M. Nelson K.G. Bidwell M.C. Curtis S.W. Washburn T.F. McLachlan J.A. Korach K.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4658-4662Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 4.Richards R.G. Diaugustine R.P. Petrusz P.

Endocrinol. 1997; 152: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Estrogen is a steroid hormone that binds to members of the nuclear receptor superfamily (7.Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6293) Google Scholar), whereas IGF-1 as a peptide-growth factor binds to a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor, which signals via a series of phosphorylation events (2.Rubin R. Baserga R. Lab. Invest. 1995; 73: 311-331PubMed Google Scholar). Two different estrogen receptors, ERα and ERβ, which are encoded by genes located on different chromosomes, have been identified so far (8.Walter P. Green S. Greene G. Krust A. Bornert J.-M. Waterfield M. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7889-7893Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar,9.Kuiper G.G.J.M. Enmark E. Pelto-Huikko M. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5925-5930Crossref PubMed Scopus (4198) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis demonstrates a high degree of homology between ERα and ERβ in the DNA-binding domain and the ligand-binding domain. However, there are significant differences in regions that would be expected to influence transcriptional activity. The ability of estrogen receptors to activate target gene transcription has been attributed to two regions: the N-terminal activation function 1 (AF-1) and the ligand-dependent AF-2, which is localized in the C-terminal hormone-binding domain (10.Tora L. White J. Brou C. Tasset D. Webster N. Scheer E. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 59: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar, 11.Mosselman S. Polman J. Dijkema R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (2038) Google Scholar). AF-1 and AF-2 can activate transcription independently and synergistically, and they act in a promoter- and cell-specific manner (12.Tzukerman M.T. Esty A. Santiso Mere D. Danielian P. Parker M.G. Stein R.B. Pike J.W. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 13.Jones P.S. Parrott E. White I.N.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32008-32014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of a serine residue at position 118 is required for full action of the AF-1 (14.Ali S. Metzger D. Bornert J.-M. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1153-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Both AF-1 and AF-2 are required to enhance transcription of target genes through AP-1 sites (15.Webb P. Nguyen P. Valentine C. Lopez G.N. Kwok G.R. McInerney E. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Enmark E. Gustafsson J.A. Nilsson S. Kushner P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1672-1685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, ERα and ERβ act differently at AP-1 sites (16.Paech K. Webb P. Kuiper G.G.J.M. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.A. Kushner P.J. Scanlan T.S. Science. 1997; 277: 1508-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar), which may be due to differences in their AF domains (17.Hall J.M. McDonnell D.P. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5566-5578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ERα and ERβ can form homo- and heterodimers (18.Cowley S.M. Hoare S. Mosselman S. Parker M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 32: 19858-19862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (600) Google Scholar), and thus the tissue-specific distribution of the estrogen receptor subtypes plays an important role in the different responses to 17β-estradiol. ERα appears to play a major role in the regulation of reproductive events. ERα knockout female mice are completely infertile, whereas ERβ knockout mice females display severe but incomplete infertility (19.Warner M. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.A. Curr. Opin. Obstet. Gynecol. 1999; 11: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 20.Ogawa S. Chan J. Chester A.E. Gustafsson J.-A. Korach K.S. Pfaff D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12887-12892Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Under pathological conditions such as endothelial denudation of the rat carotid artery ERα mRNA is constitutively expressed, whereas the expression of ERβ mRNA is increased (21.Mäkela S. Savolainen H. Aavik E. Myllärniemi M. Strauss L. Taskinen E. Gustafsson J.-A. Häyry P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7077-7082Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The cross-talk between IGF-1R and estrogen receptor-signaling pathways results in synergistic growth stimulation (22.Aronica S.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 743-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 23.Ma Z.Q. Santagati S. Patrone C. Pollio G. Vegeto F. Maggi A. Mol.

The mitogenic response of IGF-1 appears to be initiated by ligand-induced tyrosine autophosphorylation of the IGF-1R, which is important for the selective recruitment of downstream signaling molecules and results in activation of the Ras/Raf/MAPK signaling cascade. Because activation of the estrogen receptors by growth factors like IGF-1 involves the MAPK pathway by direct phosphorylation of AF-1 (5.Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. Metzger D. Chambon P. Science. 1995; 270: 1491-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar, 25.Bunone G. Briand P.-A. Miksicek R.J. Picard D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2174-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar), this is one of the potential interaction sites of both signaling pathways. On the other hand, the modulation of IGF-1R and membrane-associated IGF-binding proteins as a response to stimulation by estrogen have been described. Estrogen induces tyrosine phosphorylation of IGF-1 and insulin receptor substrate-1, which is followed by enhanced MAPK activation (4.Richards R.G. Diaugustine R.P. Petrusz P. Clark G.C. Sebastian J.

McDonnell D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4686-4691Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Thus it appears that a feed-forward system exists where E2 activates MAPK, an event that in turn enhances transcriptional activity of the estrogen receptor. In the present study we show that E2-induced MAPK activation is mediated by ERα and does not involve ERβ. We were able to demonstrate that binding of ERα to the IGF-1R depends on MAPKK activity and is induced via the MAPK pathway. As a consequence, the binding of ERα to the transmembrane IGF-1R is regulated by the MAPK pathway under these conditions.In our study we found important differences between the two estrogen receptor subtypes in the ability to interact with the IGF-1 pathway. ERβ was not able to bind to the IGF-1R, and in consequence no phosphorylation and activation of IGF-1R was observed. ERα and ERβ display significant differences in the transcriptional activation of target genes upon stimulation with IGF-1. Treatment with IGF-1 only stimulated transcriptional activity of ERα but not of ERβ in different cell lines such as COS7, HEK293, L6, or R−. These results suggest different regulatory functions of the two estrogen receptor subtypes. The differences may be in part due to different AF-1 domains because ERα reveals constitutive AF-1 activity, whereas ERβ lacks constitutive AF-1 activity (15.Webb P. Nguyen P. Valentine C. Lopez G.N.

Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 69: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that the tissue-specific distribution pattern of ERα and ERβ may be crucial to understand the proliferative response to IGF-1 and E2 in a variety of hormone-dependent malignant diseases.In summary, we were able to demonstrate that after ligand binding and phosphorylation by the MAPK cascade ERα is able to bind to the IGF-1R. This binding induces autophosphorylation of the IGF-1R and thus its activation. IGF-1R activation stimulates MAPKK and consequently phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Activation of ERK1/2 may, in turn, lead to phosphorylation of ERα and provides a possible mechanism for ligand-independent activation of ERα but not of ERβ (Fig.6). Further investigations, however, are required to understand how estrogen and the expression patterns of the two estrogen receptor subtypes as well as IGF-1R signal transduction cooperate in the regulation of growth and differentiation. The interaction of ERα and ERβ with membrane-associated signaling pathways is currently under investigation but is still poorly understood (3.Ignar-Trowbridge D.M. Nelson K.G. Bidwell M.C.

In our understanding of the role and function of estrogen receptors on the cell membrane level two major points deserve further attention: the interaction between estrogen receptors and tyrosine kinase receptor signaling pathways as well as the differences of ERα and ERβ in coupling to the cell membrane. The data presented here contribute new observations to these points by demonstrating that: 1) E2 activates the IGF-1R signaling cascade exclusively via ERα, 2) binding of ERα to the IGF-1R is a potential mechanism for estrogen to activate the IGF-1R, 3) phosphorylation of ERK1/2 is required for binding of ERα to the IGF-1R, and 4) ERα but not ERβ is the target of ligand-independent activation by IGF-1 signal transduction via the MAPK. Rapid, so called nongenomic effects of estrogen, which occur within seconds to minutes, are part of a variety of cellular responses to estrogen. In particular, rapid effects of estrogen on NO release (45.Caulin-Glaser T. Garcia-Gardena G. Sarrel P. Sessa W.C. Bender J.R. Circ.

Therefore, the observation that 1) ligand-induced ERα binds to a transmembrane receptor and that 2) E2 rapidly activates phosphorylation of the IGF-1R in the presence of ERα may offer a potential mechanism to gain further insight into the previous findings. Our data provide a model for how ligand-bound ERα activates growth factor signaling cascades in a rapid nongenomic fashion: by binding to the IGF-1R followed by its phosphorylation. Recently, it was reported that estrogen stimulates the phosphorylation of the membrane bound IGF-1R in the uterus after 6 h and involves the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway (4.Richards R.G. Diaugustine R.P. Petrusz P. Clark G.C. Sebastian J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12002-12007Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar,26.Richards R.G. Walker M.P. Sebastian J.

Previously, it was demonstrated that the estrogen-independent phosphorylation and activation of estrogen receptors can be mediated via the MAPK pathway (5.Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. Metzger D. Chambon P. Science. 1995; 270: 1491-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar, 25.Bunone G. Briand P.-A.

MAPKs such as ERKs are important regulators in signaling pathways in response to a wide array of extracellular stimuli. This observation raises the possibility that estrogen receptors can be activated by a number of growth factors using the MAPK pathway. Interestingly, activation of MAPK pathway is also induced by estrogen itself (33.Nuedling S. Kahlert S. Löbbert K. Meyer R. Vetter H. Grohé C.

https://openalex.org/W1970519591,"Peroxidases of the peroxiredoxin (Prx) family contain a Cys residue that is preceded by a conserved sequence in the NH(2)-terminal region. A new type of mammalian Prx, designated PrxV, has now been identified as the result of a data base search with this conserved Cys-containing sequence. The 162-amino acid PrxV shares only approximately 10% sequence identity with previously identified mammalian Prx enzymes and contains Cys residues at positions 73 and 152 in addition to that (Cys(48)) corresponding to the conserved Cys. Analysis of mutant human PrxV proteins in which each of these three Cys residues was individually replaced with serine suggested that the sulfhydryl group of Cys(48) is the site of oxidation by peroxides and that oxidized Cys(48) reacts with the sulfhydryl group of Cys(152) to form an intramolecular disulfide linkage. The oxidized intermediate of PrxV is thus distinct from those of other Prx enzymes, which form either an intermolecular disulfide or a sulfenic acid intermediate. The disulfide formed by PrxV is reduced by thioredoxin but not by glutaredoxin or glutathione. Thus, PrxV mutants lacking Cys(48) or Cys(152) showed no detectable thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase activity, whereas mutation of Cys(73) had no effect on activity. Immunoblot analysis revealed that PrxV is widely expressed in rat tissues and cultured mammalian cells and is localized intracellularly to cytosol, mitochondria, and peroxisomes. The peroxidase function of PrxV in vivo was demonstrated by the observations that transient expression of the wild-type protein, but not that of the Cys(48) mutant, in NIH 3T3 cells inhibited H(2)O(2) accumulation and activation of c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha."
https://openalex.org/W2008325243,"Macrophages derived from tristetraprolin (TTP)-deficient mice exhibited increased tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) release as a consequence of increased stability of TNFα mRNA. TTP was then shown to destabilize TNFα mRNA after binding directly to the AU-rich region (ARE) of the 3′-untranslated region of the TNFα mRNA. In mammals and in Xenopus, TTP is the prototype of a small family of three known zinc finger proteins containing two CCCH zinc fingers spaced 18 amino acids apart; a fourth more distantly related family member has been identified inXenopus and fish. We show here that representatives of all four family members were able to bind to the TNFα ARE in a cell-free system and, in most cases, promote the breakdown of TNFα mRNA in intact cells. Because the primary sequences of these CCCH proteins are most closely related in their tandem zinc finger domains, we tested whether various fragments of TTP that contained both zinc fingers resembled the intact protein in these assays. We found that amino- and carboxyl-terminal truncated forms of TTP, as well as a 77 amino acid fragment that contained both zinc fingers, could bind to the TNFα ARE in cell-free cross-linking and gel shift assays. In addition, these truncated forms of TTP could also stimulate the apparent deadenylation and/or breakdown of TNFα mRNA in intact cells.

One relatively uncommon class of zinc finger proteins contains fingers of the CCCH type, in which three cysteines and one histidine are thought to coordinate a single atom of zinc. Members of a subclass of the larger family of CCCH zinc finger proteins contain two tandem zinc fingers consisting of CX 8CX 5CX 3H, where X refers to variable amino acids, spaced exactly 18 amino acids apart. The prototype of proteins of this CCCH double zinc finger subclass is tristetraprolin (TTP),1 also known as TIS11 and Nup475. It was first identified as the product of an immediate early response gene in fibroblasts and other cells stimulated with insulin, serum, or phorbol esters (1.DuBois R.N. McLane M.W. Ryder K.

Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13341-13347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and rapid nuclear to cytosol translocation (6.Taylor G.A. Thompson M.J. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 140-146PubMed Google Scholar) in fibroblasts.TTP-deficient mice appear normal at birth but rapidly develop a wasting syndrome accompanied by erosive arthritis, dermatitis, alopecia, autoantibodies, and myeloid hyperplasia. Essentially all of these abnormalities were prevented by the injection of monoclonal antibodies specific for mouse tumor necrosis factor (TNFα) (7.Taylor G.A. Carballo E. Lee D.M. Lai W.S.

Macrophages derived from these mice exhibited enhanced TNFα release, accompanied by increases in TNFα mRNA levels (8.Carballo E. Gilkeson G.S. Blackshear P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 986-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This was due to an increase in stability of TNFα mRNA in macrophages derived from TTP-deficient mice (9.Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings implicated TTP as an intracellular regulator of TNFα mRNA stability and thus of TNFα biosynthesis. More recently, we have shown that TTP deficiency has a similar effect on the stability of another mRNA containing a so-called class II AU-rich element (ARE), that encoding granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (10.Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Blood. 2000; 95: 1891-1899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, there was a marked stabilization of GM-CSF mRNA in bone marrow stromal cells derived from TTP-deficient mice compared with control cells, indicating that TTP is also a physiological regulator of GM-CSF mRNA stability and thus of GM-CSF secretion (10.Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Blood. 2000; 95: 1891-1899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).TTP can bind directly to the ARE of TNFα mRNA (9.Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J.

The integrity of both zinc fingers was required for this direct protein-RNA interaction, because a single C → R mutation within the CCCH motif from either finger abolished the ARE binding activity of TTP (11.Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). The same mutations abrogated the ability of TTP to destabilize the TNFα mRNA in intact cells (11.Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). These studies indicated that TTP could bind directly to the TNFα ARE and destabilize the TNFα mRNA in a zinc finger-dependent manner, apparently by initially stimulating its deadenylation (11.Lai W.S.

All three of these proteins contain the two typical CCCH fingers, spaced 18 amino acids apart, with the sequence RYKTEL or a variant leading into each finger. Proteins with nearly identical double zinc fingers spaced 18 amino acids apart have been identified in Drosophila and yeast (17.Ma Q. Wadleigh D. Chi T. Herschman H.

Gene (Amst.). 1996; 174: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition to the Xenopus homologues of the three mammalian proteins described above, which all contain two tandem zinc fingers, we recently cloned a fourth cDNA encoding a Xenopus protein (XC3H-4) that contained two CCCH zinc fingers that were 18 amino acids apart and were preceded by the R(K)YKTEL sequence, as well as an additional more carboxyl-terminal pair of CCCH zinc fingers that were more closely spaced and lacked the lead-in R(K)YKTEL sequence (20.De J.

This mRNA was expressed only in the oocyte, eggs, and early embryo; its mammalian homologue has not been identified, to our knowledge.Although TTP appears to be a normal physiological regulator of TNFα and GM-CSF mRNA levels, secondary to its ability to bind to and promote the destabilization of their mRNAs, the physiological functions of the other vertebrate CCCH double zinc finger proteins are unknown. In the present study, we assessed the ability of these family members to bind to the ARE of the TNFα mRNA, and their ability to influence the stability of this mRNA in intact cells. Our data indicate that representatives of all four known members of this subclass of CCCH proteins exhibit TNFα ARE-binding activity, as assessed by cell-free mRNA cross-linking and gel shift assays. Members of at least three of the families can also exhibit TNFα mRNA-destabilizing capabilities in intact cell transfection assays. Somewhat surprisingly, both cell-free and intact cell activities were exhibited by both amino- and carboxyl-terminal truncated forms of TTP and by a 77-amino acid internal domain of TTP that contains both zinc fingers. Alignments of this tandem zinc finger (TZF) domain from all vertebrate members of this subclass revealed many invariant residues within this domain, as well as group-specific signature amino acids that may be important for the specific cellular functions of these proteins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid ConstructionParent PlasmidsThe human (21.Taylor G.A.

When cells were co-transfected with CMV·mTNFα and CCCH protein expression constructs, human growth hormone expression plasmid pXGH5 (Nichols Institute Diagnostics, San Juan Capistrano, CA) was also co-transfected to monitor transfection efficiency.24 h after the removal of the transfection mixture, samples were taken from the cell culture medium, and the human growth hormone released was assayed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total cellular RNA was then harvested from the HEK 293 cells using the RNeasy system (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Northern blots were prepared as described (2.Lai W.S. Stumpo D.J. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol.

The cells were incubated on ice for 20 min in a buffer consisting of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 3 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet-P40, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 8 μg/ml leupeptin (lysis buffer). Lysis of the cells and maintenance of intact nuclei were carefully monitored by microscopy. The nuclei and cell membrane debris were removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. Glycerol was added to the supernatant (cytosolic extract) to 20% (v/v), and the resulting extract was stored at −70 °C.Analysis of RNA-Protein Complexes by SDS-PAGE, Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay, and Western BlottingPreparation of RNA ProbesPlasmid pTNFα 1281–1350 (bp 1281–1350; GenBankTM accession number X02611) contained seven AUUUA motifs, five of them being overlapping UUAUUUAUU nonamers. This was constructed as described (11.Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar).Plasmid pTNFα 1309–1332 (bp 1309–1332; GenBankTMaccession number X02611), containing four overlapping UUAUUUAUU nonamers, was constructed by inserting double-stranded oligonucleotides spanning bp 1309–1332 into the EcoRV-XbaI cloning sites of pSK−.Plasmid pTNFα 1309–1332 (A/G) contained five Gs (italics) replacing the five flanking As of bp 1309–1332 of GenBankTMaccession number X02611(UUGUUUGUUUGUUGUUUGUUUUUU) and was constructed as described for pTNFα 1309–1332.Correct sequences of all plasmid inserts were confirmed by dRhodamine Terminator Cycle Sequencing (Perkin-Elmer, Foster City, CA). To label RNA transcripts with [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol), the above plasmids linearized with XbaI were used as templates, and the Promega Riboprobe in vitro Transcription Systems protocol was employed. The resulting products were precipitated with ammonium acetate and ethanol.Cross-linking of Proteins to RNACytosolic extracts prepared from HEK 293 cells transfected with CMV·hTTP·tag or other zinc finger protein expression constructs or vector (5 or 20 μg of protein) were incubated with 1.5 × 106 cpm of RNA probe in a 96-well plate at room temperature for 20 min in 20 μl of lysis buffer (without protease inhibitors). Heparin and yeast tRNA were added to final concentrations of 2.5 μg/μl and 50 ng/μl, respectively, for an additional 10 min. The 96-well plate was then placed on ice and irradiated at 254 nm UV light in a Stratalinker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for 30 min at a distance of 5 cm from the light source. RNA not associated with protein was digested with 100 units of RNase T1 (Life Technologies, Inc) for 20 min at room temperature and further digested with 25 μg of RNase A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 37 °C for 15 min. The remaining RNA-protein complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12 or 16% acrylamide gel) followed by autoradiography.Western BlottingCell extracts (5–50 μg of protein) were mixed with 15 volume of 5× SDS sample buffer (26.Blackshear P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 104: 237-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), boiled for 5 min, and then loaded onto 12 or 16% SDS-PAGE gels. Western blotting was performed by standard techniques. Membranes were incubated in Tris-buffered saline/0.3% Tween 20 (TBS/T) with either polyclonal antiserum HA.11 (1:2, 500) or an antiserum to U2AF35 (27.Zuo P. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1356-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Incubation of the membranes with second antibody and development were performed as described (8.Carballo E. Gilkeson G.S. Blackshear P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 986-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). For some blots, 125I-protein A (0.2 μCi/ml in TBS/T; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used in place of second antibody.RNA Electrophoretic Mobility Shift AssayCytosolic extracts prepared from HEK 293 cells transfected with either vector alone or expression constructs driven by the CMV promoter (5 or 20 μg of protein) were incubated with 2 × 105 cpm of RNA probe at room temperature for 20 min in 20 μl of lysis buffer (without protease inhibitors). Heparin and yeast tRNA were added to final concentrations of 2.5 μg/μl and 50 ng/μl, respectively, for an additional 10 min. RNA not associated with protein was digested with 100 units of RNase T1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 20 min at room temperature; the reaction mixture was then loaded onto a 6% nondenaturing acrylamide gel and subjected to electrophoresis at 250 V for 90 min, in 0.4× Tris borate/EDTA buffer.Expression of XC3H-4 Protein and Its Fragments in Xenopus OocytesPreparation of XC3H-4 RNA in VitrocDNAs encoding various regions of the XC3H-4 protein (20.De J.

Gene (Amst.). 1999; 228: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), full length (amino acids 1–276); amino acids 1–120 (containing the tandem CCCH zinc fingers of the TTP-type); and amino acids 121–276 (containing the second pair of CCCH zinc fingers), were inserted into the BglII cloning site of plasmid pSP64TEN (a gift from Dr. Douglas Melton, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA). The epitope tag derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein (22.Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 508-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) was attached to the last amino acid of each of the peptides as described (23.Lai W.S. Thompson M.J. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 506-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Correct sequence of the inserts was confirmed by dRhodamine Terminator Cycle Sequencing (Perkin-Elmer). The plasmids were linearized by XbaI digestion and were used as templates to synthesize RNA in vitro. The RNAs were prepared with the use of the mMESSAGEmMACHINE SP6 Kit (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) following the manufacturer's protocol.Microinjection of OocytesOvary was removed from adultXenopus females (Xenopus I, Ann Arbor, MI), and stage VI oocytes were separated from the ovary and manually defolliculated. Oocytes were allowed to recover for 16 h at 18 °C in buffer OR-2 (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 82.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 3.8 mm NaOH). Oocytes were injected with 30–50 ng of mRNA and incubated for 24 h at 18 °C. Oocyte cytosolic extracts were prepared as described above for 293 cell extracts.RESULTSThe other two human members of the mammalian CCCH double zinc finger protein family, ERF1 (cMG1 and TIS11b) and ERF2 (TIS11d), share strikingly similar amino acid sequences in the TZF region with TTP (Fig. 1, underlined). Although the carboxyl termini exhibit some sequence similarities, there are major differences between TTP and the other two proteins, whereas the amino acid sequences of ERF1 and ERF2 are more closely related to each other (Fig. 1).To determine whether these other two family members shared the ability of TTP to bind to the ARE region of the TNFα mRNA and destabilize it, ARE binding studies were performed using proteins expressed in HEK 293 cells, and co-transfection assays with the TNFα mRNA expression construct were performed in the same cell type. Besides the TTP expression constructs, the new expression constructs used were made from rat cMG1 (13.Gomperts M. Pascall J.C. Brown K.D. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1081-1083PubMed Google Scholar), which is the rat homologue of mouse TIS11b, human ERF1, and Xenopus XC3H-2, and Xenopus XC3H-3 (20.De J. Lai W.S. Thorn J.M. Goldsworthy S.M. Liu X. Blackwell T.K. Blackshear P.J. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 228: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), which is the Xenopus homologue of mouse TIS11d and human ERF2.Effects of TTP-related Proteins on TNFα mRNAIn the expression studies described below, we used a previously described (11.Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar) TNFα expression construct, CMV·mTNFα. This construct does not contain the full 3′-untranslated region of mTNFα; instead, it ends at base 1325 (of GenBankTM accession number X02611) followed by 33 adenylate residues encoded by the cDNA. The expression of TNFα mRNA from this construct allowed the detection of both the adenylated and deadenylated forms of this mRNA in the presence of TTP (11.Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). TTP has similar effects on the full-length mouse TNFα mRNA (data not shown), but for technical reasons involving size overlap with the 18 S ribosomal RNA, these are more difficult to quantitate.The HEK 293 cells used in the transfection experiments do not express endogenous TNFα or TTP mRNA (11.Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). In the following paragraph referring to Fig. 2, all quantitation of Northern blot mRNA expression was determined by PhosphorImager and was corrected for transfection efficiency by human growth hormone secretion and for gel loading by quantitating endogenous cyclophilin mRNA levels. When these cells were co-transfected with CMV·mTNFα and a range of concentrations of the human TTP expression construct CMV·hTTP·tag, the mTNFα mRNA exhibited a characteristic expression pattern. At a low concentration of TTP DNA (0.005 μg/dish of cells; Fig. 2 A, lane 2), the total amount of mTNFα mRNA was reduced to ∼40% of control in this experiment (Fig. 2 A, lane 1). When the amount of co-transfected TTP DNA was increased to 0.01 μg of DNA, the total amount of hybridizable TNFα mRNA was further reduced to 23% of control (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). When 0.1 and 1 μg of TTP were co-transfected, a smaller species of mTNFα mRNA was increased in intensity, whereas the upper band decreased markedly (Fig. 2 A, lanes 4 and 5). We have previously shown by RNase H experiments that the lower band is a deadenylated species of TNFα mRNA (11.Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). At these higher concentrations of TTP DNA, the total accumulated hybridizable mTNFα mRNA was actually greater than that seen in the cells co-transfected with vector alone (Fig. 2 A, lane 1). After correcting for transfection efficiency, the amounts of hybridizable mTNFα mRNA from cells co-transfected with 0.1 or 1 μg of CMV·hTTP·tag were 254 and 481% of control, respectively. The apparent decrease in hybridizable mTNFα mRNA seen at the highest concentration of TTP DNA (1 μg; Fig. 2 A,lane 5) is likely to be due to the global inhibition of transcription seen at this level of TTP expression, as noted previously (11.Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19:"

We investigated the role of intracellular ascorbic acid in endothelium-derived NO bioactivity. Incubation of porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAECs) with ascorbic acid produced time- and dose-dependent intracellular ascorbic acid accumulation that enhanced NO bioactivity by 70% measured as A23187-induced cGMP accumulation. This effect was due to enhanced NO production because ascorbate stimulated both PAEC nitrogen oxide (NO2− + NO3−) production andl-arginine to l-citrulline conversion by 59 and 72%, respectively, without altering the cGMP response to authentic NO. Ascorbic acid also stimulated the catalytic activity of eNOS derived from either PAEC membrane fractions or baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells. Ascorbic acid enhanced bovine eNOS V maxby ∼50% without altering the K m forl-arginine. The effect of ascorbate was tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)-dependent, because ascorbate was ineffective with BH4 concentrations >10 μmor in PAECs treated with sepiapterin to increase intracellular BH4. The effect of ascorbic acid was also specific because A23187-stimulated cGMP accumulation in PAECs was insensitive to intracellular glutathione manipulation and only ascorbic acid, not glutathione, increased the intracellular concentration of BH4.

Thus, scavenging superoxide has important implications for NO bioactivity under both normal and pathologic conditions.Ascorbic acid also efficiently scavenges superoxide (20.Nishikimi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 63: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) and numerous studies in a host of pathologic conditions such as diabetes (21.Ting H.H. Timimi F.K. Boles K.S.

Circulation. 1998; 97: 2222-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar) indicate that NO bioactivity is improved by parenteral ascorbic acid at supraphysiologic concentrations (∼10 mm). We have observed enhanced NO bioactivity in atherosclerotic patients after both acute (25.Levine G.N. Frei B. Koulouris S.N. Gerhard M.D. Keaney Jr., J.F. Vita J.A. Circulation. 1996; 96: 1107-1113Crossref Scopus (513) Google Scholar) and chronic (1 month) (26.Gokce N. Keaney Jr., J.F. Frei B. Holbrook M. Olesiak M. Zachariah B.J. Leeuwenburgh C. Heinecke J.W. Vita J.A. Circulation. 1999; 99: 3234-3240Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) oral ascorbic acid administration. With respect to these latter two observations, the role of superoxide scavenging is unclear. In particular, kinetic constraints indicate that extracellular ascorbic acid concentrations in these studies (∼100 μm) cannot preserve NO bioactivity through superoxide scavenging (27.Jackson T.S. Xu A. Vita J.A. Keaney Jr., J.F. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 916-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study, therefore, was to investigate the role of intracellular ascorbic acid on endothelial NO bioactivity.DISCUSSIONThe major finding of this study is that intracellular ascorbic acid status is an important determinant of endothelial cell NO production, principally because of increased intracellular BH4. We found that endothelial cells demonstrated enhanced eNOS-mediated cGMP accumulation as a function of increasing intracellular ascorbic acid (Fig. 1). We interpret this enhanced NO bioactivity with ascorbic acid to reflect an absolute increase in the amount of NO produced by endothelial cells. In support of this interpretation, ascorbic acid had no effect on the cGMP response to exogenous NO (Fig. 2), and endothelial cells containing ascorbic acid produced more l-citrulline and NO2− + NO3− than cells not containing ascorbate (Fig. 3). In addition, the enzymatic activity of eNOS was enhanced (via increased V max) by ascorbic acid at concentrations that are physiologically relevant (0.1–5 mm). We also found that ascorbic acid enhanced eNOS catalysis in a manner that is dependent upon BH4. In particular, the stimulatory effect of ascorbic acid on eNOS was lost with BH4 concentrations exceeding 10 μm and in endothelial cells treated with sepiapterin, an agent that increases intracellular BH4 levels (Fig. 6) (45.Gross S.S. Levi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25722-25729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46.Schmidt K. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Wachter H. Kukovetz W.R. Biochem.

Chem. 1993; 268: 1842-1846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the effect of ascorbic acid on isolated eNOS was mimicked by GSH (Fig.7 B), we found that the effects of ascorbic acid and GSH on endothelial cell NO bioactivity were distinct. In contrast to ascorbic acid, manipulation of intracellular GSH status had no effect on NO bioactivity. The mechanism for this distinction relates to our observation that intracellular ascorbic acid, but not GSH, appears to be an important determinant of endothelial cell BH4content.A potential role for reductants in NO production has been proposed for the neuronal isoform of NOS (nNOS). Komori and colleagues (48.Komori Y. Hyun J. Chiang K. Fukuto J.M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 923-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) found that nNOS purified in the absence of thiols was stimulated 4–7-fold by glutathione, cysteine, dithiothreitol, and β-mercaptoethanol. Because a similar effect was observed for dihydropteridine reductase, the authors proposed a mechanism involving the reduction of dihydrobiopterin to BH4. In that study, ascorbic acid was not an effective replacement for thiols (48.Komori Y. Hyun J. Chiang K. Fukuto J.M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 923-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This latter finding contrasts with that of Hofmann and Schmidt (49.Hofmann H. Schmidt H.H.H.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13443-13452Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that glutathione, dihydropteridine reductase, and ascorbic acid were interchangeable in stimulating nNOS activity. The latter two reagents, however, were not effective in preventing nNOS inactivation during catalysis. Thus, there is precedent for stimulation of NOS activity in the presence of reducing agents.The data presented here extend these previous studies to eNOS, demonstrating that ascorbic acid at a concentration of 5 mmstimulated bovine eNOS enzymatic activity ∼80%, a value that is in excellent agreement with its ∼70–90% stimulatory effect on nNOS (49.Hofmann H. Schmidt H.H.H.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13443-13452Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Our results are also in excellent agreement with a recent report by Heller and colleagues (50.Heller R. Münscher-Paulig F. Gräbner R. Till U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8254-8260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) who found that human endothelial cells treated with ascorbic acid demonstrated enhanced NO production as determined by l-citrulline formation and cGMP accumulation in response to both ionomycin and thrombin. Using a number of ascorbic acid derivatives, these authors found that the reductive capacity of ascorbic acid was an important component of its action and that ascorbate had no effect on l-arginine uptake, an important determinant of endothelial NO bioactivity (51.Girerd X.J. Hirsch A.T. Cooke J.P. Dzau V.J. Creager M.A. Circ. Res. 1990; 67: 1301-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Our data provide some additional mechanistic insight into the action of ascorbic acid. We were unable to duplicate the effect of ascorbic acid with physiologic concentrations of SOD, suggesting that superoxide scavenging by ascorbate is not involved in eNOS stimulation. This finding is consistent with our report demonstrating that ascorbic acid is a poor substitute for SOD (27.Jackson T.S. Xu A. Vita J.A. Keaney Jr., J.F. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 916-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Moreover, we observed that ascorbic acid stimulated eNOS activity principally as a result of an increase in the enzyme V max without any effect onl-arginine binding as the K m forl-arginine remained unchanged (Fig. 5). Thus, there is precedent for stimulation of NOS activity with ascorbic acid, and the mechanism for this effect is unrelated to superoxide orl-arginine.We did observe that the effect of ascorbic acid was dependent upon the concentration of BH4 in both isolated enzyme preparations and intact cells (Fig. 6). In this regard, several aspects of BH4 warrant consideration. Only the completely reduced (tetrahydro) form of biopterin supports NOS coupling of NADPH oxidation to NO synthesis (52.Presta A. Siddhanta U. Wu C. Sennequier N. Huang L. Abu-Soud H.M. Erzurum S. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 298-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Because NOS catalysis is associated with oxidation of BH4 (53.Reif A. Frohlich L.G. Kotsonis P. Frey A. Bommel H.M. Wink D.A. Pfleiderer W. Schmidt H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24921-24929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 54.Witteveen C.F. Giovanelli J. Kaufman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29755-29762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and ascorbic acid has been proposed to maintain BH4 in a reduced state (55.Petrack B. Sheppy F. Fetzer V. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 743-748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), one might speculate that ascorbic acid simply maintains BH4 in its reduced state. Indeed, our experiments with bovine eNOS from Sf9 cells would tend to support such an argument because ascorbic acid was ineffective with saturating BH4 levels and GSH could substitute for BH4. However, this line of reasoning would also predict equivalent effects on NO bioactivity with the intracellular manipulation of either ascorbic acid or GSH, a prediction clearly inconsistent with the data presented here (Figs. 1 and 7). The major distinction between intracellular GSH and ascorbic acid manipulation in this study was the activity of ascorbic acid alone to increase endothelial cell BH4 content. The precise mechanism for this observation is not yet clear but may relate to the prevention of intracellular BH4 oxidation or some effect of ascorbate on BH4 synthesis. Further investigation will be required to clearly define the role of ascorbic acid in maintaining intracellular BH4.In the context of other ascorbate-sensitive enzymes, the fact that ascorbic acid stimulates NO synthesis is not particularly surprising. The first step in NO synthesis involves the hydroxylation ofl-arginine to N-hydroxy-l-arginine (56.Stuehr D.J. Kwon N.S. Nathan C.F. Griffith O.W. Feldman P.L. Wiseman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6259-6263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and several enzymes that mediate amino acid hydroxylation are ascorbate-sensitive (Table I). In the first three instances, ascorbic acid acts through a reductive mechanism maintaining the iron cofactor in its reduced state for the hydroxylation of proline (57.Peterkofsky B. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 53: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 58.Kivirikko K.I. Prockop D.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1977; 252: 5073-5084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the copper-containing enzymes dopamine β-hydroxylase and peptidylglycine monooxygenase, ascorbic acid serves as a source of electrons for reduction of molecular oxygen (62.Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7347-7356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 63.Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. Glembotski C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5144-5148Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In contrast, the mechanism of ascorbate action with tyrosine 3-hydroxylase is less clear. Like the NOS isoforms, this enzyme utilizes tetrahydrobiopterin as a cofactor, and one suggested mechanism of ascorbate action involves maintaining the pterin in a reduced state (64.Bjur R.A. Weiner N. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1975; 194: 9-26PubMed Google Scholar). Whether ascorbic acid stimulates NO synthesis principally through facilitating l-arginine hydroxylation remains to be determined.Table IAscorbic acid-sensitive enzymesEnzymeFunctionMechanismReference(s)Prolyl-4-hydroxylase (EC1.14.11.2)Trans-4-hydroxylation of proline in procollagen biosynthesisReduction of iron with increasedV max57.Peterkofsky B.

In fact, ascorbic acid improves endothelial NO bioactivity in a number of disease states including diabetes mellitus (21.Ting H.H. Timimi F.K. Boles K.S. Creager S.J. Ganz P. Creager M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar), hypercholesterolemia (22.Ting H.H. Timimi F.K. Haley E.A. Roddy M.A. Ganz P.

Circulation. 1998; 97: 2222-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Given the fundamental role of intracellular BH4 for NO synthesis (46.Schmidt K. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Wachter H. Kukovetz W.R. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), the BH4-dependent effect of ascorbic acid described here provides an attractive explanation for such uniform clinical observations.In summary, the data presented here indicate that endothelial cell NO bioactivity is sensitive to intracellular ascorbic acid. In particular, endothelial cell production of NO is enhanced by intracellular ascorbate, and this effect appears to be mediated through an effect on intracellular BH4. These data suggest a novel mechanism for numerous in vivo observations that endothelium-derived NO bioactivity is enhanced by ascorbic acid. Nitric oxide is produced from l-arginine in the vascular endothelium by the endothelial isoform of nitric-oxide synthase (NOS).1 Endothelial production of NO is crucial in the control of vascular tone (1.Lefroy D.C.

Both endothelial elaboration of NO and arterial relaxation in response to nitrovasodilators are dependent upon intact copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity (13.Mugge A. Elwell J.K.

Thus, scavenging superoxide has important implications for NO bioactivity under both normal and pathologic conditions. Ascorbic acid also efficiently scavenges superoxide (20.Nishikimi M. Biochem.

We have analyzed the sequence and expression pattern of a BACE homolog termed BACE2. BACE and BACE2 are unique among aspartic proteases in that they possess a carboxyl-terminal extension with a predicted transmembrane region and together they define a new family. Northern analysis reveals that BACE2 mRNA is expressed at low levels in most human peripheral tissues and at higher levels in colon, kidney, pancreas, placenta, prostate, stomach, and trachea. Human adult and fetal whole brain and most adult brain subregions express very low or undetectable levels of BACE2 mRNA. In addition, in situ hybridization of adult rat brain shows that BACE2 mRNA is expressed at very low levels in most brain regions. The very low or undetectable levels of BACE2 mRNA in the brain are not consistent with the expression pattern predicted for β-secretase."
https://openalex.org/W2001919177,"NRAMP2 (naturalresistance-associated macrophageprotein 2)/DMT1 (divalentmetal transporter 1) is a divalent metal transporter conserved from prokaryotes to higher eukaryotes that exhibits an unusually broad substrate range, including Fe2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Pb2+, and mediates active proton-coupled transport. Recently, it has been shown that the microcytic anemia (mk) mouse and the Belgrade (b) rat, which have inherited defects in iron transport that result in iron deficiency anemia, have the same missense mutation (G185R) in Nramp2. These findings strongly suggested that NRAMP2 is the apical membrane iron transporter in intestinal epithelial cells and the endosomal iron transporter in transferrin cycle endosomes of other cells. To investigate the cellular functions of NRAMP2, we generated a polyclonal antibody against the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of human NRAMP2. The affinity-purified anti-NRAMP2 N-terminal antibody recognized a 90–116-kDa membrane-associated protein, and this band was shifted to 50 kDa by deglycosylation with peptide N-glycosidase F. Subcellular fractionation revealed that NRAMP2 co-sedimented with the late endosomal and lysosomal membrane proteins and LAMP-1 (lysosome-associated membraneprotein 1), but not with the transferrin receptor in early endosomes. The intracellular localization of endogenous NRAMP2 and recombinant green fluorescent protein (GFP)-NRAMP2 was examined by immunofluorescence staining and by native fluorescence of GFP, respectively. Both endogenous and GFP-NRAMP2 were detected in vesicular structures and were colocalized with LAMP-2, but not with EEA1 (early endosomeantigen 1) or the transferrin receptor. These results indicated that NRAMP2 is localized to the late endosomes and lysosomes, where NRAMP2 may function to transfer the endosomal free Fe2+ into the cytoplasm in the transferrin cycle.

The normal human adult has 35–45 mg of iron/kg of body weight. More than two-thirds of the body's iron content is incorporated into hemoglobin in developing erythroid precursors and mature red cells (1.Andrews N.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 1986-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar). Nutritional iron absorption (both heme and non-heme iron) occurs primarily in the intestine. Heme iron constitutes only a small fraction of the available dietary iron, but it is highly available for absorption. On the other hand, the absorption of non-heme iron is low and markedly regulated in the first part of the duodenum, in which the acidic pH promotes solubilization of iron transformed to Fe2+ by ferrireductase and ascorbate. In non-intestinal cells, iron is taken into the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis by transferrin (Tf).1 Specific receptors (Tf receptor (TfR)) on the outer face of the plasma membrane bind diferric Tf with high affinity (2.Ponka P. Beaumont C. Richardson D.R. Semin. Hematol. 1998; 35: 35-54PubMed Google Scholar). Once internalized into the cells, the Tf·TfR complex is delivered to endosomes, which are acidified to pH 5.5–6.0 through the action of an ATP-dependent proton pump. Endosomal acidification weakens binding of iron to Tf and produces conformational changes in both Tf and TfR, strengthening their association (3.Dautry-Varsat A. Ciechnover A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2258-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 4.Rao K. Renswoude J. van Kempf C. Klausner R.D. FEBS Lett. 1983; 160: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The apo-Tf·TfR complex is recycled back to the plasma membrane, where apo-Tf is discharged, thereby completing an elegant and efficient cycle. Previously, it was not clear how iron exits from the transferrin cycle endosomes. However, recent studies have provided new insight into this process and demonstrated a surprising link between the Tf cycle and intestinal iron absorption. Several inbred strains of rodents have functional defects in iron uptake and transport that define obligate intracellular steps in the iron metabolic pathway (5.Bannerman R.M. Fed Proc. 1976; 35: 2281-2285PubMed Google Scholar). Among these animals, the microcytic anemia (mk) mouse and the Belgrade (b) rat have autosomal recessive defects in iron metabolism that are associated with defects in erythroid iron utilization and intestinal iron uptake (6.Russell E.S. Nash D.J. Bernstein S.E. Kent E.L. McFarland E.C. Matthews S.M. Norwood M.S. Blood. 1970; 35: 838-850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Edwards J.A. Hoke J.E. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.

Moreover, studies in vivo have shown that this anemia cannot be corrected by increased dietary iron (9.Garrick M. Scott D. Walpole S. Finkelstein E. Whitbred J. Chopra S. Trivikram L. Mayes D. Rhodes D. Cabbagestalk K. Oklu R. Sadiq A. Mascia B. Hoke J. Garrick L. Biometals. 1997; 10: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 10.Oates P.S. Morgan E.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G826-G832PubMed Google Scholar) or by direct iron injection (5.Bannerman R.M. Fed Proc. 1976; 35: 2281-2285PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting also a second block in iron uptake by red blood cell precursors and other peripheral tissues. Using a positional cloning approach to identify the gene defective in these rodents, it has recently been demonstrated that the Nramp2gene is mutated in both the mk and b animal models (11.Fleming M.D. Trenor III, C.C. Su M.A Foernzler D. Beier D.R. Dietrich W.F. Andrews N.C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 12.Fleming M.D. Romano M.A. Su M.A. Garrick L.M.

Indeed, both the mk mouse and theb rat have been shown to carry the same mutation atNramp2, a glycine-to-arginine substitution (G185R) in one of the predicted transmembrane domains (TM4) of the protein. Using aXenopus oocyte expression cloning assay to screen for iron uptake, Gunshin et al. (13.Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.S. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2679) Google Scholar) searched for an intestinal iron transporter in the duodenal mRNA from rats fed a low-iron diet. A single cDNA (initially named Dct1 (divalentcation transporter 1), but recently renamed as Dmt1 (divalent metaltransporter 1)) encoding the rat isoform ofNramp2 was found to stimulate iron uptake by ∼200-fold. Voltage-clamp analysis of Nramp2/Dmt1-mediated iron transport indicated a pH-dependent electrogenic process, similar to those of other transmembrane transporters. A variety of other ions, including Zn2+, Mn2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Pb2+, stimulated currents indistinguishable from that of iron at the same concentration, suggesting that Nramp2/Dmt1 can transport a variety of divalent metal ions. Nramp2 is an orphan protein with no known function cloned based on its homology to Nramp1 (14.Gruenheid S. Cellier M. Vidal S. Gros P. Genomics. 1995; 20: 514-525Crossref Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Nramp1 has been identified in the mouse Bcg/Ity/Lshlocus by positional cloning, which controls resistance to infectionin vivo with Mycobacterium,Salmonella, and Leishmania (15.Vidal S.M. Malo D. Vogan K. Skamene E. Gros P. Cell. 1993; 73: 469-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). The NRAMP1 and NRAMP2 proteins are highly similar (64% overall identity) and are highly hydrophobic integral membrane glycoproteins composed of 12 transmembrane domains that possess several structural characteristics of ion channels and transporters. The members of the mammalianNramp gene family are homologous to the yeast SMFgene family of Mn2+ transporters (16.Superk F. Supekova L. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5105-5110Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). MouseNramp2 and human NRAMP2 can functionally complement a Saccharomyces cerevisiae smf1/smf2 null mutant and aSchizosaccharomyces pombe pdt1 + null mutant, respectively, whereas mouse Nramp1 and humanNRAMP1 cannot (17.Pinner E. Gruenheid S. Raymond M. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28933-28938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 18.Tabuchi M. Yoshida T. Takegawa K. Kishi F. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 211-219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The functions of NRAMP1 are still unknown, but this molecule is predicted to function as a metal transporter similar to NRAMP2. As opposed to Nramp1, which is expressed exclusively in mononuclear phagocytes such as tissue macrophages (15.Vidal S.M. Malo D. Vogan K. Skamene E. Gros P. Cell. 1993; 73: 469-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar), Nramp2 mRNA expression is more ubiquitous and has been detected in most tissues and cell types analyzed (13.Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.S. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2679) Google Scholar, 14.Gruenheid S. Cellier M.

Genome. 1995; 6: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, its levels of expression are higher in the brain, thymus, proximal intestine, kidney, and bone marrow (13.Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.S. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2679) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical analysis with protein-specific antibodies revealed that Nramp1 is expressed in the late endosomal and lysosomal membranes in macrophages and is recruited to the membrane of the phagosome upon phagocytosis (20.Gruenheid S. Pinner E. Desjardins M. Gros P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 717-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 21.Atkinson P.G.P. Blackwell J.M. Barton C.H. Biochem.

Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2855-2866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, some groups argued that Nramp2 is expressed in the apical membrane in the brush border of intestinal enterocytes and in Tf-positive recycling endosomes in non-intestinal cells (23.Canonne-Hergaux F.C. Gruenheid S. Ponka P. Gros P. Blood. 1999; 93: 4406-4417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Gruenheid S. Ganonne-Hergaux F. Gauthier S. Hackman D.J. Grinstein S. Gros P. J. Exp.

In previous studies, we have reported both cDNA and genomic DNA structures of human NRAMP2(26.Kishi F. Tabuchi M. Mol. Immunol. 1997; 34: 839-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 27.Kishi F. Tabuchi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), generated human NRAMP2 N-terminal domain-specific antiserum, and showed that this antiserum recognized functional recombinant NRAMP2 protein expressed in fission yeast (18.Tabuchi M. Yoshida T. Takegawa K. Kishi F. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 211-219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we investigate the subcellular localization of NRAMP2 in cultured human cells with the affinity-purified anti-NRAMP2 N-terminal antibody and showed that NRAMP2 is localized to late endosomes and lysosomes. Production of anti-NRAMP2 N-terminal antiserum was described previously (18.Tabuchi M. Yoshida T. Takegawa K. Kishi F. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 211-219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The affinity-purified anti-NRAMP2 N polyclonal antibody (pAb) was purified from antiserum on a HiTrapTM N-hydroxysuccinimide activated column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) coupled with glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged NRAMP2-(1–66) that was produced in Escherichia coli strain JM106 and purified on a column of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Mouse anti-human TfR monoclonal antibody (mAb) (N-2) was prepared as described previously (28.Yoshimori T. Shimonishi Y. Uchida T. Cell Struct. Funct. 1988; 13: 311-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Mouse anti-human EEA1 mAb and mouse anti-human LAMP-1 mAb were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Mouse anti-human LAMP-2 mAb (H4B4, developed by Drs. J. E. K. Hildreth and J. T. August) was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (Baltimore, MD). Alexa 594-labeled anti-rabbit IgG, anti-mouse IgG, Alexa 488-labeled anti-rabbit IgG, and Texas Red-dextran were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. Cy2-labeled anti-mouse IgG was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. The human larynx carcinoma cell line HEp-2 and human cervix carcinoma cell line HeLa were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. The african green monkey kidney cell line COS-7 was maintained in high-glucose Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. FuGENETM 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used for the transient transfection of HEp-2, HeLa, and COS-7 cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. The human NRAMP2 cDNA was amplified using the sense primer NR2-1 (5′-TGATCAACC ATG GTGCTGGGTCCTGA-3′, possessing a 5′-BclI site (underlined) and the first six amino acids including the initiation methionine (double-underlined) ofNRAMP2) and the antisense primer NR2-3 (5′-TGATCATG TTA TTTAACGTAGCCACG-3′, possessing a 5′-BclI site (underlined) and the final five amino acids and stop codon (double-underlined) of NRAMP2) and human NRAMP2 cDNA (26.Kishi F. Tabuchi M. Mol. Immunol. 1997; 34: 839-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) as a template. The reaction product was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and cloned into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega). Nucleotide sequences of the polymerase chain reaction products were verified by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method using a LI-COR 4000L automated DNA sequencer. The resulting plasmid, pNRAMP2-2, was prepared from E. colistrain SCS110 (Stratagene) and digested with BclI, and theBclI fragment containing the full-length NRAMP2cDNA was ligated into the BamHI site of pGFP-C1 (CLONTECH) to generate pGFP-NRAMP2. HEp-2 cells were homogenized with 15 strokes in a Potter homogenizer and centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min. The post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) was centrifuged for an additional 30 min at 128,000 × g to recover the pellet as the membrane fraction. The membrane fraction was resolved in 100 μl of denaturing buffer (0.5% SDS and 0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol in PBS) and denatured for 5 min at 95 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). For differential extraction, HEp-2 membrane fraction was suspended in a solution containing NaCl, urea, and Na2CO3, pH 11.0, at final concentrations of 1.0, 2.0, and 0.1 m, respectively. The suspension was incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 128,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube, precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and resolved in 100 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. The precipitate was dissolved in 100 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. The supernatant (S) and precipitate (P) fractions were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted using the affinity-purified anti-NRAMP2 N pAb. For peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) digestion, aliquots of 0.1 m Na2CO3-treated membrane fractions prepared from HEp-2 cells and the membrane fraction of recombinant NRAMP2 expressed in fission yeast were denatured before digestion in denaturing buffer for 10 min at 95 °C. PNGase F digestion was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs Inc.). Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and the blots were incubated with the primary antibodies. Proteins were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody against rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Following two rinses with ice-cold PBS, confluent HEp-2 cells in 450-cm2 culture dishes were scraped with a rubber policeman, harvested in ice-cold PBS, and collected by centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in 1.0 ml of ice-cold homogenization buffer (0.3m sucrose and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3) and homogenized with 10 strokes in a Potter homogenizer. The cell homogenate was centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the PNS was saved. The pellet was resuspended in 1.0 ml of ice-cold homogenization buffer, homogenized with 10 strokes, and centrifuged. A total of ∼2.0 ml of PNS was recovered, and then 1.5 ml of PNS was layered on 31 ml of a 0.3–1.7 m preformed linear sucrose gradient in homogenization buffer. The gradients were centrifuged at 24,000 rpm for 3 h at 4 °C in a P28S rotor (Hitachi Co. Ltd.) and then removed in 3-ml fractions from the bottom of the tube. Each fraction was dialyzed with PBS overnight and then centrifuged at 128,000 × g for 30 min to recover the pellet as the membrane fraction. The membrane fractions were resolved in 100 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, and aliquots of 5 μl were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by immunoblotting. The enrichment of proteins was confirmed by densitometric analysis using NIH Image Version 1.59. Cells grown on glass coverslips were washed three times with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, and permeabilized with 50 μg/ml digitonin in PBS for 10 min. The coverslips were washed twice (10 min/wash) with PBS and blocked in 0.2% fish skin gelatin in PBS for 10 min. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in PBS for 60 min at room temperature. Coverslips were washed three times (10 min/wash) with 0.2% fish skin gelatin in PBS. Secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa 488, Alexa 594, or Cy2 were diluted in PBS and incubated on coverslips for 60 min at room temperature. Coverslips were washed with 0.2% fish skin gelatin in PBS as described above and mounted on slides in 9:1 glycerol/PBS. Antibodies were used at the following dilutions: affinity-purified anti-NRAMP2 N pAb, 1:50; anti-TfR mAb, 1:500; anti-LAMP-2 mAb, 1:1000; anti-EEA1 mAb, 1:50; Alexa 594-labeled anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa 594-labeled anti-mouse IgG, and Alexa 488-labeled anti-rabbit IgG, 1:500; and Cy2-labeled anti-mouse IgG, 1:100. To label the lysosomal compartment, HEp-2 cells were incubated with 1 mg/ml lysine-fixable Texas Red-dextran in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium for 3 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were stripped with trypsin/EDTA, washed twice with PBS, grown on glass coverslips for 12 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2, and then fixed with 4% PFA. GFP-NRAMP2-transfected cells grown on glass coverslips were treated with nocodazole (100 μg/ml for HEp-2 cells and 20 μg/ml for HeLa and COS-7 cells). After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, cells were washed three times with PBS, fixed with 4% PFA, permeabilized, and then incubated with primary antibodies followed by secondary antibodies. The coverslips were examined with an Olympus BX50 microscope. Photographs were taken with an Olympus color chilled 3CCD camera (Model M-3204C-10). Images were analyzed on a Macintosh computer using Adobe PhotoShop 4.0J. NRAMP2 is an integral membrane protein that consists of 12 putative transmembrane domains and two potential glycosylation sites as shown in Fig.1 A. Previously, we produced a polyclonal antibody against the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail of human NRAMP2 by immunization with recombinant TrpE-NRAMP2-(1–66) protein produced in E. coli and showed that this anti-NRAMP2 N antiserum recognized the functional NRAMP2 protein expressed in fission yeast (18.Tabuchi M. Yoshida T. Takegawa K. Kishi F. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 211-219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we failed to detect endogenous human NRAMP2 in various human cell lines with this anti-NRAMP2 N antiserum (data not shown). We purified this anti-NRAMP2 N antiserum by recombinant GST-NRAMP2-(1–66) fusion protein-coupled affinity column chromatography to detect the endogenous NRAMP2 protein by immunoblotting and indirect immunofluorescence analysis. Anti-NRAMP2 N antiserum recognized not only the TrpE-NRAMP2-(1–66) fusion protein, but also the TrpE protein (Fig. 1 B, panel b), and preimmune serum did not recognize either protein (panel a). The affinity-purified anti-NRAMP2 N pAb recognized only the TrpE-NRAMP2-(1–66) fusion protein, but not the TrpE protein (Fig.1 B, panel c). These results indicated that the affinity-purified NRAMP2 N pAb specifically recognized only the portion of amino acids 1–66 of human NRAMP2. To identify endogenous NRAMP2, immunoblot analysis was performed with the affinity-purified NRAMP2 N pAb using the membrane fractions prepared from HEp-2 and COS-7 cells (Fig. 1 C). The affinity-purified anti-NRAMP2 N pAb recognized both the 66-kDa (p66) band and the 90–116-kDa (p116) smear on immunoblot analysis of the HEp-2 membrane fraction (Fig.1 C, lane 1). In COS-7 cells, the affinity-purified NRAMP2 N pAb recognized only the p66 band, and not the p116 band (Fig. 1 C, lane 2). The predicted molecular mass of NRAMP2 is 61.5 kDa, which is close to that of the p66 band. Gruenheid et al. (24.Gruenheid S. Ganonne-Hergaux F. Gauthier S. Hackman D.J. Grinstein S. Gros P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 831-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) reported that mouse NRAMP2 is a 90–100-kDa integral membrane protein extensively modified by glycosylation (>40% of the molecular mass); this molecular mass is close to that of the p116 band. To determine which band(s) actually represented the human NRAMP2 protein, HEp-2 membrane fractions were extracted with 1 m NaCl, 2 m urea, or 0.1m Na2CO3, pH 11.0. Although both p66 and p116 were sedimented in the membrane fraction, p66 was readily extracted to the soluble fraction by 1 m NaCl or 0.1m Na2CO3 treatment, but p116 could not be extracted under any conditions used in this study (Fig.1 D). These solubilization profiles suggest that p66 is not an integral membrane protein and that p116 could be the NRAMP2 protein. To confirm the identity of p116, the 0.1 mNa2CO3-extracted membrane fraction from HEp-2 cells and the membrane fraction from NRAMP2 expressed in fission yeast were treated with PNGase F, followed by electrophoresis and immunoblotting. PNGase F treatment of HEp-2 cell membrane resulted in a shift of the apparent molecular mass of the p116 band from 90–116 to 50 kDa (Fig. 1 E, lane 2). PNGase F also converted the 50–60-kDa recombinant NRAMP2 expressed in fission yeast into smaller forms with an apparent molecular mass of 50 kDa (Fig.1 E, lane 1), which was the same molecular mass as the band detected upon PNGase F treatment of the HEp-2 cell membrane. These results showed that the 0.1 mNa2CO3-resistant p116 band recognized by this pAb was the NRAMP2 protein itself. Understanding the localization of NRAMP2 within the cell is critical for understanding the Fe2+ transport step from the endosomes to the cytoplasm in the Tf cycle. To confirm the subcellular localization of NRAMP2 biochemically, we performed subcellular fractionation of HEp-2 cells. PNS was prepared from HEp-2 cells and fractionated on a 0.3–1.7 m sucrose density gradient, and the distribution of NRAMP2 within the gradient was compared with the early endosomal membrane protein TfR and the late endosomal/lysosomal membrane proteins LAMP-1 and LAMP-2. The enrichment of NRAMP2, TfR, LAMP-1, and LAMP-2 was confirmed by densitometric analysis (Fig. 2 B). NRAMP2 immunoreactivity was detected in fractions 4–8 and was enriched in fraction 6, coincident with LAMP-1 (Fig. 2). LAMP-2 also appeared essentially in the same position of LAMP-1; and it is obvious that TfR appeared in fractions 5–9, its peak was detected in fraction 7, and NRAMP2 appeared in a different position from TfR (Fig. 2). We repeated the same experiments, and these differences were consistently seen. Thus, the observations in our subcellular fractionation studies suggested that NRAMP2 was expressed within the late endosomal/lysosomal membranes. To elucidate the intracellular localization of NRAMP2, we performed indirect immunofluorescence staining of NRAMP2. When HEp-2 cells were fixed with 4% PFA and stained using the affinity-purified anti-NRAMP2 N pAb, vesicular structures in the perinuclear regions were stained (Fig.3 a). These structures were not stained by preimmune serum or non-purified antibody (data not shown) or in the presence of an excess amount of the bacterially expressed GST-NRAMP2-(1–66) fusion protein that may have been recognized by the antibody (Fig. 3 d). When COS-7 cells were stained with the affinity-purified anti-NRAMP2 N pAb, only the nuclear regions were specifically stained (Fig. 3 c). As some of the HEp-2 cells were disrupted to too great an extent by detergent through the immunostaining process, they showed staining of not only the perinuclear vesicles, but also the nuclei (Fig. 3 b,arrowheads). Immunoblot analysis showed that the affinity-purified anti-NRAMP2 N pAb recognized only p66, but not p116/NRAMP2 in the membrane fraction of COS-7 cells (Fig.1 C, lane 2). This indicated that COS-7 cells did not express p116/NRAMP2 proteins that could be recognized by the affinity-purified NRAMP2 N pAb. As the affinity-purified anti-NRAMP2 N pAb specifically recognized a portion of amino acids 1–66 of NRAMP2, these observations suggested that p66 must be the protein containing the same epitope as the N-terminal domain of NRAMP2 and that is localized to the nucleus. Fortunately, because the antibody could not permeate the nucleus in HEp-2 cells under our immunostaining conditions, only the perinuclear vesicular structures representing NRAMP2 were stained. However, because of the different permeability of antibodies, when HeLa cells were stained with the affinity-purified pAb, most of the cells showed staining of not only the perinuclear vesicles, but also of the nuclei under our immunostaining conditions (data not shown). To identify the perinuclear vesicular structures stained in HEp-2 cells, the cells were double-stained with anti-EEA1 marker for early (sorting) endosomes; anti-TfR marker for sorting endosomes, recycling endosomes, and plasma membrane; anti-LAMP-2 marker for late endosomes and lysosomes; or Texas Red-dextran-endocytosed for 15 h, a marker of lysosomes. The early endosomal markers EEA1 and TfR were not colocalized with NRAMP2 (Fig. 4,A–F), although a small portion of NRAMP2 in the perinuclear region overlapped with TfR (Fig. 4, D–E). In contrast, most of the puncta of NRAMP2 were completely colocalized with LAMP-2 (Fig.4, G–I); and furthermore, endocytosed Texas Red-dextran in the perinuclear region, which was supposed to be a lysosomal marker, appeared to be localized in the same compartment as NRAMP2 (Fig. 4,J–L). These results indicated that NRAMP2 was located in late endosomes and lysosomes. To confirm the late endosomal and lysosomal localization of NRAMP2 by examining the localization of recombinant GFP-NRAMP2, HEp-2 cells were transfected with pGFP-NRAMP2, fixed with 4% PFA, and stai"

This pathway is essential during embryonic development and oncogenesis. Previous studies on both Xenopus and mammalian cells indicate that lithium mimics Wnt signaling by inactivating GSK-3β. Here we show that serum enhances accumulation of cytoplasmic β-catenin induced by lithium in both 293 and C57MG cell lines and that growth factors are responsible for this enhancing activity. Growth factors mediate this effect through activation of protein kinase C (PKC), not through Ras or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. In addition, Wnt-induced accumulation of cytoplasmic β-catenin is partially inhibited by PKC inhibitors and by chronic treatment of cells with phorbol ester. Both calphostin C, a PKC inhibitor, and a dominant negative PKC exhibit partial inhibition on Wnt-mediated transcriptional activation. We therefore propose that Wnt signaling to β-catenin consists of two interactive components: one involves inhibition of GSK-3β and is mimicked by lithium, and the other involves PKC and serves to augment the effects of GSK-3β inhibition.

In normal or non-stimulated cells, the majority of the β-catenin protein is present in cell-cell junctions with very little in cytoplasmic or nuclear fractions. This is due to rapid turnover of β-catenin promoted by complexes containing the adenomatous polyposis coli protein, GSK-3β,1 and Axin/Conductin (7.Munemitsu S. Albert I. Souza B. Rubinfeld B.

The N-terminal clusters of serine and threonine residues of β-catenin are putative GSK-3β phosphorylation sites (8.Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfiri E. Fiol C. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Science. 1996; 272: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar), which serve as signals for ubiquitin-mediated degradation (15.Orford K. Crockett C. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Byers S.W. J.

Dishevelled in turn leads to the inactivation of GSK-3β, causing the accumulation of cytoplasmic β-catenin. High levels of β-catenin in the cytosol result in its translocation into the nucleus and subsequent interaction with the Tcf/Lef family of transcription factors to activate expression of Wnt-responsive genes (6.Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2242) Google Scholar). Recently, c-myc and cyclin D1 have been identified as target genes of β-catenin (21.He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C.

The majority of these mutations are located in the putative GSK-3β phosphorylation sites (29.Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3529) Google Scholar, 30.Sparks A.B. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1130-1134PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, these mutations result in stabilization of the β-catenin protein. Intracellular levels of β-catenin are therefore regulated by different signaling pathways and play a central role in both development and tumorigenesis. Lithium has marked effects on the embryonic development and patterning in different organisms including Xenopus andDictyostelium (31.Kao K.R. Elinson R.P. Biol. Cell. 1998; 90: 585-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In Xenopus embryos, lithium causes axis duplication, resembling a phenotype caused by overexpression of Wnt, dominant negative GSK-3β, or β-catenin (32.Sokol S. Christian J.L. Moon R.T. Melton D.A. Cell. 1991; 67: 741-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 33.Pierce S.B. Kimelman D. Development. 1995; 121: 755-765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34.He X. Saint-Jeannet J.P.

Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). In Dictyostelium, lithium alters cell fate determination, resulting in transformation of pre-spore cells into pre-stalk cells (36.Van Lookeren Campagne M.M. Wang M. Spek W. Peters D. Schaap P. Dev. Genet. 1988; 9: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In isolated rat adipocytes, treatment with lithium leads to increased glycogen synthesis (37.Cheng K. Creacy S. Larner J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1983; 56: 183-189PubMed Google Scholar). The action of lithium has been previously attributed to depletion of inositol, based on the observation that lithium inhibits inositol monophosphatase (38.Berridge M.J. Downes C.P. Hanley M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 411-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). However, recent observations suggest that lithium may mimic Wnt signaling by direct inhibition of GSK-3β, leading to the accumulation of cytoplasmic β-catenin (39.Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar, 40.Stambolic V. Ruel L. Woodgett J.R. Curr.

This is consistent with the fact that GSK-3β is a highly conserved serine/threonine protein kinase in evolution and plays a central role in diverse biological processes including those affected by lithium (34.He X.

Normally, GSK-3β is highly active in resting cells. However, many extracellular stimuli result in the inhibition of its activity. For example, stimulation by insulin and growth factors activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway and the subsequent protein kinase B (PKB) activation leads to inhibition of GSK-3β, probably via the N-terminal Ser-9 phosphorylation (49.Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4426) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Wnt stimulation also leads to similar degrees of inhibition of GSK-3β yet does not involve PI3K pathway, p70 S6 kinase, or MAP kinase pathway (50.Cook D. Fry M.J. Hughes K. Sumathipala R. Woodgett J.R. Dale T.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4526-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Instead, TPA-sensitive isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC) have been shown to be involved in Wnt-induced inactivation of GSK-3β (50.Cook D. Fry M.J. Hughes K. Sumathipala R. Woodgett J.R. Dale T.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4526-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). PKC has been shown to phosphorylate and inactivate GSK-3β in vitro (51.Goode N. Hughes K. Woodgett J.R. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16878-16882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of PKC activation in Wnt-induced β-catenin accumulation remains unknown. Inactivation of GSK-3β by Wnt causes slower cytoplasmic turnover and increased nuclear translocation of β-catenin, and leads to activation of Wnt target gene expression. However, there is no evidence that GSK-3β inhibition by insulin or growth factor stimulation leads to β-catenin accumulation and Tcf/Lef-dependent transcriptional activation. Here we provide evidence that growth factors can enhance lithium-induced β-catenin accumulation and transactivation. This enhancement is through a distinct signaling pathway that involves TPA-sensitive isoforms of PKC. More importantly, our study suggests that two different components, one mimicked by lithium and the other mediated by PKC, contribute to Wnt-induced β-catenin stablization and activation of gene expression. EGF, calphostin C, GF-109203X (bisindolylmaleimide I), and TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) were obtained from Calbiochem.

The monoclonal antibodies against β-catenin and actin were purchased from Transduction Laboratories and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, respectively.

TOPFlash (a reporter plasmid containing multiple copies of wild-type Tcf-binding sites), FOPFlash (a reporter plasmid containing mutant Tcf-binding sites), full-length human Tcf4, and dominant negative Tcf4 were generous gifts from Dr. Hans Clevers (Utrecht University, The Netherlands) (54.Korinek V.

PKCα(T/A)3, a dominant negative form of PKCα (DN-PKC), was a gift from Dr. Peter Parker (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, United Kingdom) (55.Cazaubon S.M. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17559-17563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AP-1-luciferase (AP-1-Luc) and p53-luciferase (p53-Luc) reporter plasmids were purchased from Stratagene. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. 1 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added where selection was necessary. Cytoplasmic and membrane fractions were prepared according to a protocol described previously (56.Shimizu H. Julius M.A. Giarre M. Zheng Z. Brown A.M. Kitajewski J. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1349-1358PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice and scraped in phosphate-buffered saline and the cell pellets were resuspended in ice-cold hypotonic buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 25 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm EDTA) containing a protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were lysed by incubating on ice for 20 min, followed by 30 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. The lysates were subject to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant and the pellet were collected as the cytoplasmic fraction (S100 fraction) and the membrane fraction (P100 fraction), respectively. Protein concentration of the cytoplasmic extracts was estimated by using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein from each lysate was analyzed by 10 or 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein bands were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin, 1× TBS, 0.05% Tween 20. Membranes were incubated with appropriate primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C and then probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used to visualize the protein bands on the membranes, Semi-Quantitation by Gel Doc 1000 (Bio-Rad). Transfections were performed by using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) or FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufactures instructions. Cells from one 10-cm dish were transfected with 5 μg of the TOPFlash reporter plasmid or 5 μg of activator plasmids plus 2.5 μg of the TOPFlash reporter plasmid. Ten hours after transfection, the cells were split into eight 6-well dishes. Cells were serum-starved overnight, followed by stimulation with different stimuli for another 16 h. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed for 15 min at room temperature. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min and 20 μl of each lysate was used to measure luciferase reporter gene expression (luciferase assay kit, Promega). The luciferase activity was either normalized toRenilla luciferase activity from co-transfected internal control plasmid pRL-TK or normalized to protein concentration. All experiments were performed in duplicate at least 3 times. Each 6-cm dish was seeded with 2 × 105 C57MG cells the day before infection. The medium was removed from the dishes, and the virus stocks and Polybrene (final concentration of 8 μg/ml) (Sigma) were added to the cells and incubated for at least 5 h. Cells were allowed to recover in fresh media for 24 h before being split into G418 containing media for selection. After 2 weeks of selection, cells that are resistant to G418 were pooled together for further analysis. Regulation of cytoplasmic β-catenin is critical for its signaling function. In colon carcinomas, cytoplasmic β-catenin levels and Tcf/Lef-dependent transcription can be up-regulated by either the loss of adenomatous polyposis coli protein function or mutations of the putative GSK-3β phosphorylation sites in the N-terminal region of β-catenin (27.Ilyas M.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1130-1134PubMed Google Scholar). Wnt stimulation also specifically causes repression of GSK-3β activity and subsequent β-catenin accumulation in the cytosol and nucleus (6.Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2242) Google Scholar). We asked whether serum stimulation, which has been shown to decrease GSK-3β activity to a similar extent as Wnt stimulation (50.Cook D. Fry M.J. Hughes K. Sumathipala R. Woodgett J.R. Dale T.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4526-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 57.Welsh G.I. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), would induce cytoplasmic β-catenin accumulation. To test this possibility, cells were stimulated with serum, lysed in hypotonic buffer, and fractionated by ultracentrifugation. Normalized amounts of S100 lysates were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and cytoplasmic β-catenin was visualized by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig.1 A, serum stimulation alone did not lead to cytoplasmic accumulation of β-catenin. However, lithium did increase cytoplasmic β-catenin levels, which is consistent with previous observations that lithium acts as a non-competitive inhibitor of GSK-3β and leads to the cytoplasmic accumulation of β-catenin (39.Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar, 40.Stambolic V. Ruel L. Woodgett J.R. Curr.

Biol. 1997; 185: 82-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, when cells were stimulated with both serum and lithium, a much more pronounced accumulation of cytoplasmic β-catenin in C57MG and 293 cells was observed (Fig. 1 A and data not shown). Furthermore, serum and lithium also synergistically enhanced transcriptional activation of a reporter gene with multiple copies of Tcf-binding sites (TOPFlash) (Fig. 1 B). Whereas lithium activated the reporter gene only up to 3-fold, lithium plus serum gave rise to 10-fold activation in 293 cells. These results indicate that serum by itself does not have a significant effect on β-catenin levels, yet can potentiate the effect of lithium on cytoplasmic β-catenin accumulation and β-catenin-dependent transcriptional activation. In order to find out what is responsible for the serum enhancement of lithium-induced β-catenin stablization, we used l-α-lysophosphatidic acid and different growth factors, instead of serum, to stimulate cells.l-α-Lysophosphatidic acid neither caused the accumulation of β-catenin by itself nor had any synergistic effect with lithium (data not shown). Combinations of growth factors (insulin, platelet-derived growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-1, and EGF) could substitute for serum stimulation (Fig.2 A). Among them, EGF partially substituted serum in β-catenin accumulation (data not shown) and β-catenin-dependent transcriptional activation (Fig.2 B). Therefore, growth factors play a major role in the cooperation of serum with lithium on the cytoplasmic β-catenin stablization and β-catenin-dependent transcriptional activation. Since growth factors contributed to the serum effect on β-catenin accumulation, we reasoned that growth factors might elicit their functions by feeding into GSK-3β via PI3K/PKB pathway (49.Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4426) Google Scholar, 58.Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Cross D.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined if a constitutively active form of PI3K (p110-CAAX) (59.Marte B.M. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 63-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) would substitute for serum in the reporter gene assay described earlier. p110-CAAX, co-transfected with the reporter TOPFlash, neither activated the reporter gene by itself nor synergized with lithium. Moreover, lithium-induced reporter gene activity could be further increased by serum stimulation in the p110-CAAX-transfected 293 cells (Fig. 3 A). Likewise, co-transfection of gag-PKB, an activated form of PKB, with TOPFlash failed to enhance lithium-induced reporter gene activation (data not shown). Ras is a major mediator in the growth factor signaling pathways (60.Katz M.E. McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar,61.McCormick F. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 500-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We wondered if Ras might be involved in synergizing with lithium in β-catenin accumulation. We made a stable C57MG-V12 cell line expressing activated RasVal-12. The C57MG-V12 cells showed typical morphology of Ras-transformed cells (data not shown). We then examined if RasVal-12 could substitute for serum in potentiation of β-catenin accumulation by lithium. The C57MG-V12 cells did not accumulate more cytoplasmic β-catenin than the vector cells when treated with lithium. In addition, the cytoplasmic β-catenin levels in both the vector and the C57MG-V12 cells could be further elevated to a similar extent by treatment with serum and lithium (Fig. 3 B). Therefore, expression of RasVal-12 cannot substitute for serum in potentiation of β-catenin accumulation. One of the other candidate pathways activated by serum and growth factors is the PKC pathway. To investigate if PKC is involved in the accumulation of β-catenin, we tested TPA, a potent activator of certain isoforms of PKC, in conjunction with lithium to induce β-catenin accumulation. TPA alone had little effect on the cytoplasmic β-catenin levels. Interestingly, TPA plus lithium stimulated further the accumulation of β-catenin (Fig. 4 A). The level of stimulation by TPA is comparable to that of serum. These results suggest that although activation of PKC alone is not sufficient for activation of Wnt signaling pathway, it can enhance Wnt signaling by cooperating with lithium. We postulated that the serum cooperation might be due to the activation of PKC. To test this, we pretreated cells with calphostin C, a PKC inhibitor, before being stimulated with serum and lithium. As shown in Fig. 4 B, treatment of calphostin C inhibited serum potentiation of β-catenin accumulation. Furthermore, long-term treatment of cells with TPA ablated the serum potentiation of lithium-stimulated β-catenin accumulation (data not shown). Chronic treatment of cells with TPA has been shown to down-regulate the TPA-sensitive isoforms of PKC. Therefore, the TPA-sensitive isoforms of PKC might be responsible for the enhancement of lithium-induced β-catenin accumulation by serum. Wnt signaling also leads to cytoplasmic β-catenin accumulation by inhibiting GSK-3β activity (62.Peifer M. Sweeton D. Casey M. Wieschaus E. Development. 1994; 120: 369-380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 63.Papkoff J. Rubinfeld B. Schryver B. Polakis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2128-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Since lithium mimics the Wnt signaling in terms of inhibiting the activity of GSK-3β, we examined if serum could also enhance the Wnt signaling by increasing Wnt-stimulated β-catenin accumulation. C57MG-Wnt-1 cells showed elevated levels of cytoplasmic β-catenin (52.Bradley R.S. Brown A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4616-4622Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 53.Jue S.F. Bradley R.S. Rudnicki J.A. Varmus H.E. Brown A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, serum starvation or serum stimulation of C57MG-Wnt-1 cells did not affect the levels of cytoplasmic β-catenin accumulation (Fig. 5 A). Therefore, serum does not seem to further enhance β-catenin accumulation induced by Wnt-1 expression. This observation suggests that lithium is not the surrogate for the Wnt signaling, and serum or growth factors can provide additional signal(s) that leads to further accumulation of β-catenin. PKC has been shown to participate in the inactivation of GSK-3β by Wnt (50.Cook D. Fry M.J. Hughes K. Sumathipala R. Woodgett J.R. Dale T.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4526-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). To investigate whether PKC is involved in the β-catenin accumulation induced by Wnt-1, we treated the Wnt-1 cells with different PKC inhibitors and examined the cytoplasmic β-catenin accumulation by immunoblotting. Treatment of the C57MG-Wnt-1 or 293-Wnt-1 cells with increasing concentrations of calphostin C for 3 h resulted in gradual reduction of the cytoplasmic β-catenin (Fig. 5 B and data not shown). Similarly, chronic treatment of C57MG-Wnt-1 or 293-Wnt-1 cells with TPA or treatment of the C57MG-Wnt-1 cells with GF-109203X (1 μm) also led to partial inhibition of β-catenin accumulation (data not shown). Furthermore, β-catenin accumulation stimulated by conditioned Wnt media was also partially inhibited by treatment of calphostin C, as well as by chronic treatment of TPA in C57MG and 293 cells (Fig.5 C and data not shown). To test whether the inhibition of β-catenin accumulation by these inhibitors has any functional significance, we assayed the Tcf reporter activity in 293-Wnt-1 cells. The reporter activity was 10-fold higher in 293-Wnt-1 cells compared with 293-Vector cells and was partially inhibited by calphostin C in a dose-dependent manner in 293-Wnt-1 cells (Fig.6 A). To further strengthen the conclusion from the PKC inhibitor experiments, we employed PKCα(T/A)3, a dominant negative PKC (DN-PKC), to test whether it has any effect on Wnt-mediated transcriptional activation. In control experiments, DN-PKC blocked 70% of TPA-stimulated AP-1 luciferase reporoter activity (Fig. 6 B, left panel) and it had no significant effect on p53-mediated transcriptional activation (Fig. 6 B, right panel). The expression of DN-PKC caused partial loss of Wnt-induced transcriptional activation in a dose-dependent manner, although it was not as strong as the dominant negative Tcf4 (DN-Tcf4) (Fig. 6 B, middle panel). Since activation of PKC by TPA alone did not result in any accumulation of cytoplasmic β-catenin, we conclude that activation of PKC is not sufficient for transduction of Wnt signal yet it is an important component of Wnt signaling. From genetic and biochemical studies of Drosophila andXenopus, a linear pathway has been elucidated from the extracellular ligand Wnt to the transcription factor Tcf/Lef. Wnt binds to its receptor Frizzled, triggering the activation of Dishevelled, which in turn leads to the inactivation of GSK-3β (6.Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2242) Google Scholar). Inactivation of GSK-3β abolishes the phosphorylation and ubiquitin-mediated degradation of β-catenin (18.Winston J.T. Strack P. Beer-Romero P. Chu C.Y. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 270-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar, 19.Hart M. Concordet J.P. Lassot I. Albert I. del los Santos R. Durand H. Perret C. Rubinfeld B. Margottin F. Benarous R. Polakis P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 207-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 20.Latres E. Chiaur D.S. Pagano M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 849-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms underlying the inactivation of GSK-3β and β-catenin accumulation have not been fully understood. It has been proposed that PKC might be involved in the inactivation of GSK-3β because certain inhibitors of PKC are capable of antagonizing Wnt-mediated GSK-3β inactivation (50.Cook D. Fry M.J. Hughes K. Sumathipala R. Woodgett J.R. Dale T.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4526-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Our data further demonstrated that Wnt/β-catenin pathway could comprise two components, one is mimicked by lithium and the other involves PKC. It is interesting that Wnt-1 and growth factors inactivate GSK-3β to a similar extent (50.Cook D. Fry M.J. Hughes K. Sumathipala R. Woodgett J.R. Dale T.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4526-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 57.Welsh G.I. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), yet only Wnt-1 can induce cytoplasmic β-catenin accumulation (Figs. 1 and 5). Earlier studies have indicated that signaling from growth factors (e.g. insulin) to GSK-3β is wortmannin sensitive and involves PKB (49.Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4426) Google Scholar, 64.Welsh G.I. Foulstone E.J. Young S.W. Tavare J.M. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 65.Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Vandenheede J.R. McDowell H.E. Hundal H.S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) whereas that from Wnt to GSK-3β is insensitive to wortmannin treatment (50.Cook D. Fry M.J. Hughes K. Sumathipala R. Woodgett J.R. Dale T.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4526-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Instead, Wnt-1-induced GSK-3β inactivation is completely blocked by certain PKC inhibitors (50.Cook D. Fry M.J. Hughes K. Sumathipala R. Woodgett J.R. Dale T.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4526-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Therefore, the pathway from GSK-3β inhibition to cytoplasmic β-catenin accumulation appears to be fundamentally different between Wnt signaling and growth factor signaling. In the case of insulin signaling, GSK-3β inhibition is mediated by phosphorylation of Ser-9 on GSK-3β (66.Sutherland C. Leighton I.A. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 67.Stambolic V. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 68.Shaw M. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar); in Wnt signaling, GSK-3β activity is inhibited to 50% of its normal activity but little is known about the mechanism of the inhibition. It is of interest to study whether Wnt-mediated GSK-3β inhibition is accomplished via covalent modification and whether different pools of GSK-3β are involved in Wnt signaling. Lithium has profound effects on morphogenesis in diverse organisms (31.Kao K.R. Elinson R.P. Biol. Cell. 1998; 90: 585-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). One action of lithium has been recently shown to mimic Wnt signaling by direct inhibition of GSK-3β causing the accumulation of cytoplasmic β-catenin (39.Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar, 40.Stambolic V. Ruel L. Woodgett J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1664-1668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Hedgepeth C.M. Conrad L.J. Zhang J. Huang H.C. Lee V.M. Klein P.S. Dev. Biol. 1997; 185: 82-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). In this study, we confirmed the lithium effect on GSK-3β inhibition (data not shown) and β-catenin accumulation in both 293 and C57MG cells. We further showed that serum or growth factors could cooperate with lithium to induce β-catenin stablization (Figs. 1 and 2). This raised a possibility that Wnt might also synergize with serum or growth factors to induce maximum accumulation of β-catenin. However, our results indicated that Wnt-induced β-catenin accumulation is independent of serum (Fig. 5). These observations imply that lithium might only partially mimic the Wnt signaling pathway. Which serum-activated pathways are involved in the cooperation with lithium to induce cytoplasmic β-catenin accumulation? We ruled out the involvement of PI3K/PKB and Ras in the synergistic stablization of β-catenin (Fig. 3). Since PKC is implicated as a candidate component in the Wnt signal transduction, we examined PKC inhibitors on serum enhancement of lithium-induced β-catenin accumulation. Indeed, PKC inhibitors completely block the serum enhancement function. The role of PKC is further supported by the observation that TPA, a potent activator of certain PKC isoforms, can also cooperate with lithium (Fig. 4). In conclusion, we identified a pathway involving PKC that enhances lithium-induced β-catenin accumulation. It is noteworthy that a synergy between lithium and insulin-like growth factor-1 is reported in the stimulation of granule neuron progenitor proliferation, a process involving inhibition of GSK-3β (69.Cui H. Meng Y. Bulleit R.F. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1998; 111: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Questions emerge as what is the target(s) of growth factors/PKC pathway. One possibility is that growth factors/PKC may cooperate with lithium in the inactivation of GSK-3β. To test this hypothesis, we immunoprecipitated GSK-3β kinase from resting cells or serum-stimulated cells and performedin vitro kinase assay in the presence of increasing amounts of lithium. We did not observe any cooperative inhibition of GSK-3β by serum and lithium (data not shown). However, considering the nature of the in vitro kinase assay, we still cannot rule out the possibility of cooperative inhibition of GSK-3β by serum and lithiumin vivo. Further study is needed to dissect the converging point from activation of PKC to β-catenin accumulation. The role of PKC in the Wnt signaling pathway remains controversial.In vitro, PKC has been shown to phosphorylate and inactivate GSK-3 (51.Goode N. Hughes K. Woodgett J.R. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16878-16882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An earlier report showed that a PKC inhibitor Ro31-8220 or chronic treatment with TPA resulted in complete block of Wnt-mediated inhibition of GSK-3β in mouse 10T1/2 fibroblasts (50.Cook D. Fry M.J. Hughes K. Sumathipala R. Woodgett J.R. Dale T.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4526-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In that study, the authors did not determine the effect of these PKC inhibitors on Wnt-induced β-catenin accumulation. On the other hand, others reported that treatment with the PKC inhibitors GF-109203X or Ro31-8220 caused β-catenin accumulation in certain human breast epithelial cell lines, whereas treatment with the PKC inhibitor calphostin C or TPA-induced down-regulation of PKCs has no significant effect on β-catenin accumulation (15.Orford K. Crockett C. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Byers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24735-24838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Our data showed that Wnt-dependent β-catenin stablization was partially inhibited by certain PKC inhibitors (Fig. 5 and data not shown). The discrepancy may be explained by the differences of these inhibitors on various isoforms of PKCs or their nonspecific effects on other kinases. It is possible that TPA-sensitive PKCs are involved in the Wnt-induced GSK-3β inactivation whereas atypical PKCs contribute to β-catenin degradation (15.Orford K. Crockett C. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Byers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24735-24838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 50.Cook D. Fry M.J. Hughes K. Sumathipala R. Woodgett J.R. Dale T.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4526-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). However, the most plausible explanation is from the recent publication by Hers and colleagues (70.Hers I. Tavare J.M. Denton R.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), who showed that the PKC inhibitors GF-109203X and Ro31-8220 also inhibit GSK-3β, potentially slowing down β-catenin degradation. The importance of PKCs in colon cancer has been demonstrated in transgenic PKC βII mice that exhibit hyperproliferation and increased Wnt signaling in the colonic epithelium (71.Murray N.R. Davidson L.A. Chapkin R.S. Clay Gustafson W. Schattenberg D.G. Fields A.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 699-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Recently, certain Wnt and Frizzled homologs have been reported to modulate PKC but have no effect on expression of β-catenin target genes, whereas other Frizzled homologs capable of activating β-catenin target genes do not activate PKC (72.Sheldahl L.C. Park M. Malbon C.C. Moon R.T. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Consistent with the report, we found that molecules such as growth factors or TPA that activate PKCs do not stimulate any detectable β-catenin accumulation and transcriptional activation. In contrast, using inhibitors and the dominant negative PKC mutant, we showed that PKCs do participate in Wnt/β-catenin signaling, although they are not the essential components of this pathway. For example, calphostin C-mediated PKC inhibition or TPA-induced PKC down-regulation results in partial inhibition of Wnt-induced β-catenin accumulation. Furthermore, both calphostin C and the dominant negative PKC inhibit partially the Wnt-mediated Tcf/Lef reporter activation. These results strengthened the notion that PKC activation alone is not sufficient to cause stablization of β-catenin, but it is a component of Wnt pathway that leads to maximum accumulation of β-catenin and transcriptional activation. Elevation of β-catenin levels in the cytosol and nucleus as well as its transcriptional activity is strongly correlated with tumorigenesis. Therefore, understanding the regulation of free β-catenin pools by different signaling pathways could facilitate the development of new strategies to regulate β-catenin signaling. We thank Dr. P.

Here we report on the discovery of a novel IL-17 homolog (IL-17B), together with the identification of a novel cell surface receptor that specifically binds to it. We detail the molecular cloning, tissue distribution, and expression of both IL-17B and IL-17BR, describe thein vivo activity of IL-17B, and demonstrate binding to IL-17BR. Our results illustrate the utility of searching large sequence data bases for the rapid matching of ligand-receptor pairs. Full-length cDNAs for human IL-17B and IL-17BR were identified, sequenced, and submitted to GenBankTM and were assigned the accession numbers AF212311and AF212365, respectively. DNA sequencing was performed using ABI 377 automated DNA sequencers and Perkin-Elmer Biosystems Big Dye Terminator sequencing chemistries. Northern blot analysis of poly(A) RNA samples was performed usingCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA) multiple tissue Northern blots. For analysis of murine IL-17B transcripts, total RNA was prepared from rodent organs, separated on agarose gels containing formamide, and blotted onto Nylon filters. Membranes were hybridized overnight in Hybrisol solution (Oncor), preheated to 42 °C before use, followed by two subsequent washes in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at the same temperature. Double-stranded cDNA probes, used at a minimum specific activity of 2 × 109 cpm/μg, were generated by restriction digestion, 32P-labeled using the Rediprime random primer labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and purified with NucTrap ion exchange push columns (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The genomic position of the IL-17B gene was determined with the standard G3 radiation hybrid panel (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL). The panel DNAs were amplified by PCR usingIL-17B gene-specific primers 5′-GGCGGGCAGCAGCTGCAGGCTGACC-3′ and 5′-CTGGGCTGGCCCAGCCCCAGGAAG-3′. The primers used for mapping ofIL-17BR were 5′-GATCCTCCCGGACTTCAAGAGGC-3′ and 5′-GGAAAGGCCAGGCAGGCCTGG-3′. For bacterial production of IL-17B, an open reading frame coding for the mature form of IL-17B (residues Gln21–Phe180), as predicted by SignalP (34.Nielsen H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), was amplified by PCR and cloned as anNdeI-Asp718I restriction fragment (495-bp product) downstream of an inducible lacZ promoter. For efficient translation, the first 50 nucleotides of mature IL-17B were codon-optimized for expression in Escherichia coli. The primers used were sense, 5′-GACTCATATGCAGCCGCGTTCCCCGAAATCCAAGCGTAAA-3, and antisense, 5′-GACTGGTACCTTATCAGAAGATGCAGGTGCAGC-3′. The reading frame and adjacent areas were sequence-confirmed following cloning. After transformation and expression in E. coli, IL-17B was present in the inclusion bodies. Inclusion bodies were solubilized with 4 m guanidine HCl and dialyzed against 50 mmsodium acetate buffer, pH 5, containing 0.1 m NaCl. Antisera were prepared by immunizing rabbits with IL-17B (Q21-F180). The sera were used for immunoblot analysis after 1000-fold dilution. In vitro cultures were grown in sterile disposable polystyrene (Corning Glass Works, Corning, NY) in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. 293, CHO, NIH3T3, WRL-68, Colo587, PANC-1, HeLa S3, K562, Raji, and SW480 cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Plasmid DNA was transfected into 293T cells using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The complete open reading frame of human IL-17B was amplified by PCR (601-bp product). The primers used were sense, 5′-GACTGGATCCGCCATCATGGACTGGCCTCACAACC-3, and antisense, 5′-GACTGGTACCGGATGGTCTCGGGCTGCTG-3′. Full-length IL-17B was cloned as aBamHI-Asp718I restriction fragment into a cytomegalovirus-enhancer/Rous sarcoma virus-long terminal repeat promoter-based expression vector. The clones were sequence-confirmed before transfection into CHO cells. IL-17B-positive CHO clones were selected by reverse transcriptase-PCR and amplified to 1 micromolar methotrexate. Conditioned media (CHO-5 serum-free media without methotrexate) from 7 CHO clones were analyzed for IL-17B expression by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. Three CHO clones with the highest expression were selected for continued amplification in the presence of 10 μm methotrexate. Four-day conditioned media from IL-17B-expressing clones was used for protein purification. The media were adjusted to 25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.2, and applied to the strong cation exchange resin (Poros HS-50) using a BioCad 60 (PE, Perkin-Elmer/Perseptive Biosystems). The HS-50 bound material was eluted using a step gradient of NaCl in 25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.2, and fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The 0.8 mNaCl pool was applied to weak anion exchanger (CM HyperD, BioSepra) and eluted with a NaCl gradient. The IL-17B-positive fractions were pooled, subjected to size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex-75 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline, and pooled again. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA procedure (Pierce). Endotoxin was measured using the LAL assay (Cape Cod Assoc.). Measured endotoxin levels were between 11 and 20 EU/mg protein. For synthesis of N-terminal Flag fusion protein, the mature portion (Arg23–Phe184) coding region of IL-17B was amplified by PCR and cloned into pFLAG-CMV-1 vector (Sigma) as anEcoRI-BamHI restriction fragment. The primers used were 5′-GCCCCGGAATTCAAGGAGCCCCAAAAGCAAGAGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCCCGC GGATCC TCAGAAGATGCAGGTGCAGCC-3′ (antisense, 550-bp product). Conditioned media from 293T cells transiently transfected with pFLAG-CMV-1:IL-17B was prepared and purified using anti-FLAG affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 300 μg of purified protein was recovered from 500 ml of culture supernatant. The extracellular portion of the receptors was fused to a human Fc domain (heavy chain constant region of IgG1). The primers used for PCR amplification of the extracellular domain coding region of huIL-17R were 5′- GATCGCGGATCCGCCATCATGGGGGCCGCACGCAGCCCGCCGTCCG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GATCGCGGATCCCCGTCCGGAATTGGTTCTGGAGTGTCTGGCATTTCTG-3′ (antisense, 959-bp product), and 5′- GAGCGCAGATCTGCCACCATGTCGCTCGTGCTGCTAAGCCTGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGGGGGAGATCTCCTCCCGGCTTGCTTTTGTTGTTATC-3′ (antisense, 878-bp product) for huIL-17BR, respectively. Clones with correct insert orientation were selected by PCR screening and resequenced before use. Conditioned media from 293T cells transiently transfected with the IL-17B receptor (M1-G289)-Fc fusion or IL-17 receptor (M1-D315)-Fc were prepared. The Fc protein was purified using a protein A column (POROS), and approximately 150 μg of purified protein was recovered from 500 ml of culture supernatant. High density BIAcore flow cells were prepared for initial ligand screening by covalent immobilization to the sensor chip (CM5 chip) via amine groups usingN-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide chemistry. huIL-17R and huIL-17BR proteins were dialyzed against 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5, and coupled at densities of 7900 and 9600 relative units for IL-17R and IL-17BR, respectively. Various concentrations of purified IL-17B and IL-17 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) in 50 ml of HEPES-buffered saline (HBS) buffer were examined for receptor binding at a flow rate of 15 μl/min. After injection of sample the flow cell was equilibrated with HBS. A low density BIAcore flow cell (∼300 relative units) derivatized with IL-17B receptor was used for kinetic analysis. Various concentrations of IL-17B were flown over the huIL-17BR flow cell and a control flow cell immobilized with irrelevant Fc protein, TR2-Fc. Injection of IL-17B in HBS at different flow rates (15–75 μl/ml) and at different concentrations (0.04–5 μg/ml) were used to determine the kinetic binding constants. IL-17B binding was followed during the binding (k a, on-rate) and dissociation (k d, off-rate) phases. After analysis the chip was regenerated by dissociation of IL-17B·receptor complexes by washing with 20 ml of 10 mm glycine HCl, pH 2.3. All methods were run on a BIAcore 3000 using the BIAcore control software version 1.3 (BIAcore AB). The on and off rates were determined using the kinetic evaluation program in BIAevaluation 3 software using a 1:1 binding model and the global analysis method. The χ2 value was 2.54. For detection of IL-17B, cells (106 in 100 μl) were incubated with either preimmunized rabbit serum (1:100) or IL-17B immunized rabbit serum (1:100). Cells were washed and then incubated with phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit F(ab)2. Cell were washed, resuspended in 5 μg/ml propidium iodide solution, and acquired on the FACScan (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA). Alternatively, cells were first incubated 10 min at room temperature with 1 μg of soluble IL-17B, and then the anti-IL-17B serum was added as described. Ability of soluble IL-17BR-Fc to block IL-17B binding to IL-17BR+ cells was also tested, using 1 or 10 μg of IL-17BR-Fc added in solution with the soluble IL-17B. Analysis was performed using an electronic gate on propidium iodide-negative live cells. BALB/c mice (n = 8 per group) were injected intraperitoneally with 0.2 ml of rhIL-17B at indicated amounts plus 50 μg of the human chemokine HCC-1 (35.Schulz-Knappe P. Magert H.-J. Dewald B. Meyer M.

Med. 1996; 183: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) as a carrier. At 4 h after injection the mice were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation. The peritoneal cavity was then exposed, and the exudate was collected by washing the cavity with 4 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Cell counts performed in triplicate on each peritoneal exudate sample were quantitated by complete blood chemistry analyzer and hemocytometer. Cytocentrifuge (Shandon, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA) smears of peritoneal exudate cells from each mouse were stained with Wright's stain for differential counts. Total numbers of PMN accumulating in the peritoneal cavity were calculated by multiplying total peritoneal exudate cells by the percent PMN determined from differential counts. Both % and total values of PMN were expressed as means ± S.E. Significance of difference was determined by an analysis of variance t test. Recombinant human IL-17 was from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS,M r 36,000–44,000) was purchased from American International Chemistry (Natick, MA). LipofectAMINE reagent and geneticin (G418) were from Life Technologies, Inc. Indomethacin and methotrexate were obtained from Sigma. Female Swiss Webster mice (20–25 g) and female Lewis rats (160–180 g) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Raleigh, NC) and kept under standard conditions for 1 week before being used in experiments. The animal protocols used in this study were reviewed and approved by the Human Genome Sciences, Inc., Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Tissues from several models of inflammation were tested for expression of the IL-17B receptor. Models included murine colitis, rat jejunitis, mouse graft versushost disease, and Listeria-induced bacteremia in mice. In the DSS-induced murine colitis model, female Swiss Webster mice were given a 4% solution of DSS ad libitum for 7 days. Animals were euthanized on day 7, and the distal third of the colon flushed with saline and snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen in preparation for RNA extraction. In indomethacin-induced rat jejunitis, female Lewis rats were injected subcutaneously on day 0 and 1 with indomethacin. Indomethacin was prepared by solubilizing in absolute ethanol, sonicating for 30 s, and then diluting 1:4 v/v with 5% sodium bicarbonate to create a stock solution of 10 mg/ml. The stock solution was diluted further with 5% sodium bicarbonate, and rats were injected subcutaneously (sc) with a final dose of 8 mg/kg in a volume of 0.2 ml. On day 4, 3 days after the final indomethacin injection, rats were euthanized, and 10 cm of the small intestine was removed, starting 20 cm up from the cecum. The intestinal tissue was flushed with saline and snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen prior to RNA analysis. An EST coding for a putative signal peptide was initially discovered in a human thymus cDNA library. Three additional clones were subsequently identified in libraries from thymus tumor and from 9- and 12-week-old human embryo tissue. All four clones were fully sequenced and found to be identical over the entire open reading frame. They are predicted to code for a protein of 184 amino acids with an N-terminal leader sequence of 20 amino acids. The predicted molecular mass for this protein is 20.4 kDa, with an estimated isoelectric point of 9.24 (Fig.1 A). There is one potentialN-linked glycosylation site and eight cysteine residues. The short 3′-untranslated region contains a single near-consensus polyadenylation site and is devoid of the characteristic AU repeats found in several other cytokines, growth factors, and proto-oncogenes (30.Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3103) Google Scholar). A comparison of both nucleotide and amino acid sequences with the GenBankTM or EMBL data bases revealed significant homology of the translation product with the amino acid sequence of the recently described T cell-derived cytokine, IL-17 (Fig. 1 B). At the amino acid level, human IL-17B shared 21.3, 19, and 20.7% identity with human, mouse, and rat IL-17, respectively, and 21.9% identity with the product of the 13th ORF of Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS13). The degree of conservation is higher in the C-terminal portion of the protein, and six of the eight cysteines present in IL-17B are conserved and identically spaced between IL-17B and IL-17 (2.Yao Z.

Med. 1996; 183: 2593-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). A putative murine ortholog of IL-17B was identified in a mouse EST data base and found to be 87.8% similar to the human IL-17B and 21.3, 19.6, 22, and 21.9% similar to the human, mouse, rat, and viral IL-17 sequences (Fig. 1 B). The map position of the human IL-17B gene was determined by somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid mapping. Amplification of the standard G3 radiation hybrid panel using gene-specific oligonucleotide primers showed linkage to the SHGC-33930, SHGC-4655, and SHGC-11215 markers on chromosome 6 at distances of 13, 14, and 18 centirads, with LOD scores of 10.13, 9.25, and 8.94, respectively, corresponding to a cytogenetic location at 6p21.2. By Northern blot analysis of human tissues, a very strong signal at ∼1.0 kb was seen in spinal cord, testis, and small intestines, and less pronounced in prostate, colon mucosal lining, ovary, and in the K-562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line (Fig.2). Furthermore, a weak transcript of similar length was routinely observed in trachea, uterus, adrenal gland, substantia nigra, and fetal kidney. Even though IL-17B cDNA was initially isolated from thymus, the signal observed on all blots with spleen or thymus poly(A) RNA was either faint or not visible. The tissue distribution of murine IL-17B was also determined. An ∼1.0-kb band was observed on poly(A) mouse RNA blots probed with a murine reading frame-specific cDNA probe (Fig. 1 B). The signal was strongest in brain, heart, and testis and weaker in lung, liver, and skeletal muscle (mouse spinal cord was not tested). In order to identify target cell types that respond to IL-17B, we searched for candidate receptors. Since IL-17B is distantly related to IL-17, we screened the EST data bases for novel homologs of the recently described murine and human IL-17R amino acid sequences (31.Yao Z. Fanslow W.C.

A cDNA clone containing an open reading frame predicted to code for a type I transmembrane protein was identified in a library from human adult lung tissue. Overlapping clones were subsequently discovered in libraries from various other tissues, predominantly eosinophils, brain, pancreas, kidney, thyroid, and osteoclastomas. A large open reading frame is predicted to encode a receptor of 426 amino acids. Computer-assisted analysis suggests that this protein has an N-terminal signal peptide with a cleavage site after proline 17. The signal peptide is followed by a 273-amino acid extracellular domain (Arg18–Gly289), a 22-amino acid transmembrane stretch (Trp290–Leu311), and a 115-amino acid cytoplasmic tail (Met312–Leu426, Fig.3 A). There are six potentialN-linked glycosylation sites in the extracellular domain, at positions 67, 103, 156, 183, 197, and 283. The predicted molecular mass for this protein is 47.9 kDa, with an isoelectric point of 8.16. Overall, the IL-17BR protein sequence is 19.2 and 18.2% identical to the human and murine IL-17R sequences, respectively (Fig.3 B). There is no WSXWS motif in the extracellular domain (33.Baumgartner J.W. Wells C.A. Chen C.M. Waters M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29094-29101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic portion of this new receptor is much shorter than the unusually long tail described for IL-17R (32.Yao Z. Spriggs M.K. Derry J.M. Strockbine L. Park L.S. VandenBos T. Zappone J.D. Painter S.L. Armitage R.J. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 794-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a segment (TPPPLR-PRKVW) located proximal to the IL-17R transmembrane domain, which is highly conserved among cytokine receptors (33.Baumgartner J.W. Wells C.A. Chen C.M. Waters M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29094-29101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is absent. By Northern blot analysis of human tissues using an open reading frame-specific hybridization probe, two specific transcripts of ∼3.5 and 1.4 kb can be detected in several endocrine tissues, most pronounced in fetal and adult liver, kidney, pancreas, testis, colon, and small intestines but are absent in peripheral blood leukocytes and lymphoid organs (Fig. 4). Only a few of a large series of transformed human cell lines grown in culture expressed IL-17BR transcript detectable by Northern and real-time PCR analysis (not shown). These were predominantly derived from organs found to be positive for IL-17BR message above and included the WRL-68 human embryonic liver, Colo587 pancreas adenocarcinoma-mesothelioma, PANC-1 pancreatic epithelioid carcinoma, HeLa S3 cervical carcinoma, K562 leukemia, Raji Burkitts lymphoma and SW480, colorectal adenocarcinoma lines. The map location of IL-17BR was determined at 3p21.1 by radiation hybrid mapping, with an LOD score of 12. It is noted that several chemokine receptors and trypsin inhibitors have been mapped in the 3p21.1, 3p21.2, and 3p21 regions. The constitutive mRNA and protein levels of many cytokine receptors are extremely low, and detection of their transcription and surface expression to levels that can be detected by Northern blot or cell sorting is very often d"

Calpain activity is required during an early stage of the adipocyte differentiation program. Thus, inhibition of calpain with N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN) blocks clonal expansion and acquisition of the adipocyte phenotype only when added between 12 and 24 h after the induction of differentiation. Likewise, inhibition of calpain by overexpression of calpastatin, the specific endogenous inhibitor of calpain, prevents 2-day post-confluent preadipocytes from reentering the cell cycle triggered by the differentiation inducers. Inhibition of calpain with ALLN causes preadipocytes to arrest just prior to S phase and prevents phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma gene product, DNA replication, clonal expansion, and subsequent adipocyte differentiation but does not affect the expression of immediate early genes (i.e. fos, jun, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ). Inhibition of calpain by either ALLN or by overexpression of calpastatin blocks the degradation of p27. p27 is degraded in vitro by cell-free extracts from clonally expanding preadipocytes that contain “active” calpain but not by extracts from pre-mitotic preadipocytes that do not. This action is inhibited by calpastatin or ALLN. Likewise, p27 in preadipocyte extracts is a substrate for purified calpain; this proteolytic action was inhibited by heat inactivation, EGTA, or ALLN. Thus, extracellular signals from the differentiation inducers appear to activate calpain, which degrades p27 allowing density-dependent inhibited preadipocytes to reenter the cell cycle and undergo mitotic clonal expansion.

Growth arrest at confluence appears to be a prerequisite for subsequent differentiation. This cell cycle arrest, however, is overcome by mitotic and adipogenic inducers. Confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes are unique in that serum alone is unable to induce reentry of contact-inhibited preadipocytes into the cell cycle. Specific adipogenic agents are necessary to induce reentry of density-dependent, growth-arrested preadipocytes into the cell cycle. Upon addition of the differentiation inducers (MDI),1 i.e. a combination of isobutylmethylxanthine (M, a cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor), dexamethasone (D), a high level of insulin (I, which acts through the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor), and fetal bovine serum (FBS) (1.Cornelius P. MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 99-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 5.Student A.K. Hsu R.Y. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4745-4750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the cells reenter the cell cycle and undergo several rounds of mitosis (6.Bernlohr D.A. Bolanowski M.A. Kelly Jr., T.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5563-5567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) referred to as mitotic clonal expansion (1.Cornelius P. MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 99-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 2.MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 345-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar, 5.Student A.K. Hsu R.Y. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4745-4750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The initiation of this clonal expansion phase involves the expression of “immediate early” genes, fos, jun, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ, to drive confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes from G0 into G1. These genes are expressed during the first few hours following induction of differentiation. During mitosis, DNA replication is hypothesized to alter the accessibility of promoter/enhancer elements to factors required for the transcription of genes involved in the initiation of differentiation (1.Cornelius P. MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 99-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). This is followed by the expression of transcription factors, notably C/EBPα and PPARγ, that terminate mitotic clonal expansion and coordinately activate transcription of adipocyte genes (7.Lin F.-T. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8757-8761Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 8.Freytag S.O. Geddes T.J.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1977) Google Scholar). Mitotic clonal expansion of growth-arrested preadipocytes appears to be necessary for optimal differentiation. Thus exposure of subconfluent proliferating preadipocytes to differentiation inducers results in poor differentiation (5.Student A.K. Hsu R.Y. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4745-4750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Entry into the cell cycle is known to be regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) (12.Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3200) Google Scholar). The CDK complex consists of a catalytic serine/threonine kinase subunit and a regulatory cyclin subunit. Several factors contribute to the activity of the CDK complex (12.Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3200) Google Scholar, 13.MacLachlan T. Sang N. Giordano A. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expr. 1995; 5: 127-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). 1) Synthesis and degradation of the cyclins are regulated at specific stages of the cell cycle. 2) Specific kinases and phosphatases regulate the phosphorylation status of the serine/threonine kinase subunit. 3) The CDK complex also binds inhibitory factors at specific points in the cell cycle. The cyclin·CDK complex is regulated by two families of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs). The CIP1/KIP1 family, i.e. p21, p27, and p57, inhibits CDKs by forming ternary complexes with various cyclin-CDKs, whereas the INK4 family,i.e. p15, p16, p18 and p19, inhibits CDK activity by forming binary complexes with CDKs (12.Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3200) Google Scholar). Progression of quiescent cells through G1 and into S phase requires the coordinated activation of CDK4/CDK6 and CDK2 (12.Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3200) Google Scholar). The interaction between cyclin D and CDK4/CDK6 is thought to link extracellular signals to the cell cycle, whereas the onset of DNA replication per se is regulated by cyclin E·CDK2 complexes (14.Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2576) Google Scholar). The CIP1/KIP1 family of proteins form ternary complexes with cyclins and CDKs, including the cyclin D·CDK4/6 complexes. The primary target of cyclin D·CDK4 complexes is the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product, Rb (15.Matsushime H. Ewen M.E. Strom D.K. Kato J.Y. Hanks S.K. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 323-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). Activation of cyclin D·CDK4 leads to phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein, Rb (15.Matsushime H. Ewen M.E. Strom D.K. Kato J.Y. Hanks S.K. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 323-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). This initial phosphorylation event is required for further phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin E·CDK2 complexes at the G1/S boundary, which allows cells to enter S phase (16.Planas-Silva M.D. Weinberg R.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 768-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The active (hypophosphorylated) form of Rb acts by sequestering transcription factors, such as E2F, that regulate genes required for S phase (17.Nevins J.R. Nature. 1992; 358: 375-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar,18.Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Rb causes its inactivation, thereby releasing these transcription factors from inhibition and allowing cell cycle progression. Although the process by which contact-inhibited 3T3-L1 preadipocytes are induced to reenter the cell cycle upon exposure to adipogenic factors is poorly understood, one (or more) of the signaling events described above is likely to be involved. p27 has been shown to be regulated via its degradation. Previous studies have demonstrated that p27 is a substrate for the ubiquitin-proteosomal degradation pathway (19.Pagano M. Tam S.W. Theodoras A.M. Beer-Romero P. Del Sal G. Chau V. Yew P.R. Draetta G.F. Rolfe M. Science. 1995; 269: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). In the present study, we provide evidence that during the mitotic clonal expansion phase of adipocyte differentiation calpain is also able to degrade p27. Calpain is known to degrade several different factors involved in the cell cycle, including cyclin D1 (20.Choi Y.H. Lee S.J. Nguyen P. Jang J.S. Lee J. Wu M.-L. Takano E. Maki M. Henkart P.A. Trepel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28479-28484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that inhibition of calpain, either by addition of the calpain inhibitor, ALLN, or by overexpression of the endogenous calpain inhibitor, calpastatin, blocks the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (21.Patel Y.M. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1279-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and this inhibition occurs prior to the expression of C/EBPα (21.Patel Y.M. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1279-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Evidence presented in the present study demonstrates that calpain catalyzes the degradation of the CDK inhibitor, p27, thereby allowing cells to make the G1/S transition, reenter the cell cycle, and proceed through the mitotic clonal expansion phase of adipocyte differentiation. N-Acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN) and purified rabbit skeletal muscle calpain were purchased from Sigma and Oil Red O from Matheson Coleman & Bell. All antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% calf serum (CS) until confluent (day −2) and then were maintained in the same medium for an additional 2 days (until day 0). Differentiation was induced on day 0 by addition of 0.5 mmmethylisobutylxanthine, 1 μm dexamethasone, 1 μg/ml insulin, and 10% FBS in DMEM. After 48 h (day 2), the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 1 μg/ml insulin and 10% FBS (5.Student A.K. Hsu R.Y. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4745-4750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After day 4 the cells were fed every other day with 10% FBS in DMEM without insulin. Between day 0 and day 2 the cells synchronously reenter the cell cycle, undergo 2–3 rounds of mitotic clonal expansion, and then begin to express genes indicative of adipocyte terminal differentiation. Cytoplasmic triglyceride droplets become abundant between days 4 and 5, and by day 7 the cells are fully differentiated (5.Student A.K. Hsu R.Y. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4745-4750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ALLN (26 μm) was added at the time of MDI treatment (day 0) unless otherwise indicated. Day 7 3T3-L1 cell monolayers were washed two times with PBS and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 2 min. A 0.2% Oil Red O-isopropyl alcohol solution was added to the cells for 1 h after which the monolayers were washed several times with distilled water, and stained cytoplasmic triglycerides were visualized (22.Mackall J.C. Student A.K. Polakis S.E. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6462-6464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells at various stages of differentiation were trypsinized, pelleted, and resuspended in a solution containing 10% CS and DMEM. Cell number was determined using a Coulter counter (Coulter Electronics). A tetracycline-regulated expression system (TET-OFF) (Life Technologies, Inc.) was employed to inducibly express calpastatin (generously provided by Dr. M. Maki, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan), in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, as described previously (21.Patel Y.M. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1279-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was isolated at various time points during the first 24 h after the induction of differentiation, by the acid-phenol guanidine isothiocyanate method (23.Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDougald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 24: 5294-5299Crossref Scopus (16610) Google Scholar). Ten micrograms of total RNA were separated by electrophoresis, and Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (21.Patel Y.M. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1279-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar,24.MacDougald O.A. Cornelius P. Liu R. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 647-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). cDNA fragments of C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, c-fos, c-jun,c-myc, and 18 S rRNA (full-length cDNAs) were used to probe for the corresponding mRNAs. Probes were labeled to high specific activity by random priming (25.Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16562) Google Scholar). Two-day post-confluent preadipocytes were induced to differentiate with MDI in the presence or absence of 26 μm ALLN. [3H]Thymidine was added to the medium for 30 min at various times following induction of differentiation after which aliquots were assayed for thymidine incorporation as described previously (26.Smulson M.E. Kang V.H. Ntambi J.M. Rosenthal D.S. Ding R. Simbulan C.M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 119-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). BrdUrd incorporation was performed as described in the protocol provided by Becton Dickinson. Briefly, 2-day post-confluent preadipocytes grown on coverslips were treated with MDI or MDI and 26 μm ALLN for 16 h. The cell monolayers were labeled with 10 μm BrdUrd for 30 min, fixed in 70% ethanol for 30 min, air-dried, and then immersed in 0.07 nNaOH for 2 min and neutralized with PBS, pH 8.5. Coverslips were incubated in a solution containing 50 μl of 0.5% Tween 20/PBS and 20 μl of anti-BrdUrd (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated) for 30 min, washed with PBS, and dried. Cell lysates were prepared from dividing preadipocytes, 2-day post-confluent preadipocytes (day 0), and cells at various time points during the course of differentiation. Each cell monolayer (6 cm) was washed once with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 0.5 ml of a solution containing 1% SDS, 60 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8. The lysate was incubated at 100 °C for 10 min and stored at −35 °C. Samples were subjected to 12% acrylamide, SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Membranes were stained with Ponceau S to assess total protein loading. Membranes were incubated with various antisera as indicated or HA mouse antiserum to detect HA-tagged human calpastatin followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma). Proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Two-day post-confluent cells were lysed in a solution containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl. Lysates (30 μg of protein) were incubated in the presence of 1 unit of purified rabbit skeletal muscle calpain that had or had not been heated to 100 °C for 10 min. Incubations were at 30 °C for 1 h in the presence of 6 mmCaCl2 alone or in the presence of 10 mm EGTA or 26 μm ALLN (20.Choi Y.H. Lee S.J. Nguyen P. Jang J.S. Lee J. Wu M.-L. Takano E. Maki M. Henkart P.A. Trepel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28479-28484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). p27 degradation was assessed by Western blot analysis. In mixing experiments, confluent (day 0) preadipocytes that were either maintained in CS or induced to differentiate with MDI or MDI and ALLN for 24 h after the start of induction were lysed as described above. Lysates (alone or in combination) were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min, in the presence of 6 mm CaCl2. To verify the involvement of calpain, cell lysates from preadipocytes, induced to differentiate with MDI, were first incubated for 30 min in the presence or absence of antibody against calpain or calpastatin or in the presence of a calpastatin peptide and then for 30 min with lysates from uninduced preadipocytes (CS). Samples were then analyzed for p27 by Western blot analysis as described previously. Induction of differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes leads to the expression of genes. The coordinate expression of these genes gives rise to the adipocyte phenotype (1.Cornelius P. MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 99-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 2.MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 345-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar, 3.Hwang C.-S. Loftus T.M. Mandrup S. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 231-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Thus, as illustrated in Fig. 1 A when preadipocytes are induced to differentiate with MDI, massive amounts of triglyceride accumulate in the cytoplasm. Previous studies (21.Patel Y.M. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1279-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) showed that by inhibiting calpain, preadipocytes that had been induced to differentiate became growth-arrested. This growth arrest occurred at a stage prior to the expression of the C/EBPα and thus prevented the expression of adipocyte marker genes. To locate the time window in the differentiation program at which calpain acts, confluent, growth-arrested 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were treated with a calpain inhibitor, i.e. ALLN, for a 24-h period at the beginning of day 1, 2, or 4 following induction of differentiation with MDI. After each 24-h treatment, ALLN was “washed out” with a medium change. The extent of differentiation was assessed on day 7 by staining cytoplasmic triglyceride with Oil Red O. As shown in Fig.1 B, differentiation was unaffected by exposure to ALLN beginning on days 2 or 4; however, differentiation of preadipocytes treated with ALLN on day 1 (concomitant with MDI treatment) was almost completely (>95%) inhibited as evidenced by a lack of Oil Red O staining. It is evident, therefore, that calpain is required at an early stage(s) of the differentiation program. To define the exact time frame of ALLN action, preadipocytes were treated with ALLN for 6–12-h periods within the first 24 h of differentiation. Preadipocytes treated with ALLN from 0 to 6 or 6 to 12 h, following the addition of the differentiation inducers, differentiated normally (Fig.1 B). However, differentiation was markedly inhibited in preadipocytes treated with ALLN between 12 and 24 h. Thus, it appears that the action of calpain is required for only a limited period early (12–24 h) in the differentiation program. Since the time window during which differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes is susceptible to inhibition by ALLN coincides with that of mitotic clonal expansion, it was of interest to determine whether the inhibitor affects clonal expansion. It should be noted that mitotic clonal expansion is a prerequisite for differentiation (2.MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 345-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Clonal expansion occurs during the first 3 days after induction with MDI (6.Bernlohr D.A. Bolanowski M.A. Kelly Jr., T.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5563-5567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To address this question, 2-day post-confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were either maintained without differentiation inducers or were treated with MDI or MDI plus ALLN for 48 h. Cell number was then determined on day 7, and the fold increase in cell number was normalized to that of non-induced controls. Preadipocytes treated with MDI exhibit a 4–5-fold increase in cell number relative to non-induced controls (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, preadipocytes treated with MDI and ALLN fail to proliferate to a significant extent (Fig. 1 C). These findings show that ALLN treatment of preadipocytes blocks the mitotic clonal expansion of the differentiation program. As ALLN has also been reported to act as a proteosome inhibitor, the effect of a potent irreversible proteosome inhibitor, i.e.lactacystin (27.Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar), was investigated. Confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were either induced with MDI or with MDI in the presence of a high concentration (10 μm) of lactacystin for 48 h, after which cell number was assessed. Preadipocytes treated with lactacystin and MDI underwent cellular proliferation (Fig. 1 C) and differentiated normally (not shown), albeit at a slightly slower rate than cells treated with MDI alone. Previous studies have shown that a much lower concentration of lactacystin (3 μm) is sufficient to block proteosome action (28.Mellgren R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 555-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Inhibition of proteosome action by lactacystin has been shown to inhibit progression of the cell cycle (29.Fenteany G. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). To verify that lactacystin, at the concentration used in this study, i.e. 10 μm, is capable of inhibiting proteosome action in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, we treated dividing preconfluent preadipocytes with lactacystin after which cell number was assessed. Cell cycle progression/proliferation of preconfluent preadipocytes was completely blocked by lactacystin (Fig.1 D). Thus, the proteosomal inhibitor, lactacystin, can inhibit cell proliferation of “preconfluent” 3T3-L1 preadipocytes but does not inhibit cell proliferation (mitotic clonal expansion) of MDI-induced 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. These findings indicate that the MDI-induced mitotic clonal expansion of confluent preadipocytes is distinctly different from cell proliferation of preconfluent preadipocytes. Thus, the inhibitory effect of ALLN on differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes does not appear to be due to inhibition of proteosome action. The specificity of calpain action in initiating mitotic clonal expansion was further investigated with 3T3-L1 preadipocytes stably transfected with an inducible expression vector for calpastatin, the specific endogenous inhibitor of calpain (30.Saido T.C. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 814-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). This vector contains a TET-promoter/HA-tagged calpastatin transgene that allows conditional expression of calpastatin under the control of the tetracycline promoter. In the presence of tetracycline, calpastatin is not expressed (21.Patel Y.M. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1279-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and preadipocytes undergo clonal expansion (Fig. 1 C) and differentiation (21.Patel Y.M. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1279-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Upon removal of tetracycline from the medium 24 h prior to induction with MDI, calpastatin is expressed (21.Patel Y.M. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1279-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and mitotic clonal expansion is almost completely blocked following induction with MDI (Fig. 1 C). Therefore, it appears that the inhibition of calpain activity, rather than inhibition of proteosome activity, is responsible for the blockade of clonal expansion and differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Nevertheless, it is possible that calpain initiates proteolytic degradation, and proteosomes complete the proteolytic process. Since ALLN blocks the mitotic clonal expansion phase of the adipocyte differentiation program, it was important to identify the stage of the cell cycle where cells are arrested. To ascertain whether calpain activity is required prior to or during S phase, confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were treated either with MDI or MDI and ALLN and then were pulse-labeled with [3H]thymidine for 30-min intervals at various times after induction. It should be noted that induction with MDI induces the synchronous reentry of growth-arrested preadipocytes into the cell cycle. During the first 12 h following induction with MDI, very little [3H]thymidine was incorporated into DNA (Fig.2 A). Initiation of DNA synthesis, as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation, began about 14 h after induction with MDI (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, cells treated with MDI and ALLN failed to incorporate [3H]thymidine. Addition of ALLN prevented the incorporation of [3H]thymidine even after 24 h, indicating that the initiation of DNA synthesis was inhibited, not merely delayed (results not shown). To verify the timing of DNA synthesis, BrdUrd incorporation was measured 16 h after induction of differentiation. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were treated with MDI or MDI and ALLN for 16 h and then incubated for 30 min with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd), an S phase-specific marker. The cells were then fixed, and BrdUrd incorporation was assessed by immunofluorescence. As shown in Fig.2 B, preadipocytes induced to differentiate with MDI were heavily stained with fluorescent anti-BrdUrd, indicating entry into S phase by 16 h. In contrast, cells treated with MDI and ALLN for 16 h failed to incorporate BrdUrd into DNA and thus had been arrested prior to S phase, most likely in late G1 or at the G1-S boundary. As a negative control, preadipocytes that had not been induced to differentiate did not incorporate BrdUrd (results not shown). Previous studies (21.Patel Y.M. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1279-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) have shown that ALLN-induced inhibition of adipocyte differentiation is reversible. Preadipocytes treated with MDI and ALLN for 48 h and then re-exposed to MDI after 7 days underwent mitotic clonal expansion and were then differentiated to the same extent as control cells treated with MDI alone (21.Patel Y.M. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1279-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The time when ALLN blocks reentry into the cell cycle,i.e. near the G1-S boundary of MDI-induced preadipocytes, is consistent with the finding that ALLN inhibits differentiation only when added between 12 and 24 h after the induction of differentiation (Fig. 1 C). Two-day post-confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes become growth-arrested in a distinctive G0 state (4.Scott R.E. Florine D.L. Wille J.J. Yun K. Proc. Natl. Ac"
https://openalex.org/W2012008185,"Cholesterol accumulates to massive levels in cells from Niemann-Pick type C (NP-C) patients and in cells treated with class 2 amphiphiles that mimic NP-C disease. This behavior has been attributed to the failure of cholesterol released from ingested low density lipoproteins to exit the lysosomes. However, we now show that the rate of movement of cholesterol from lysosomes to plasma membranes in NP-C cells is at least as great as normal, as was also found previously for amphiphile-treated cells. Furthermore, the lysosomes in these cells filled with plasma membrane cholesterol in the absence of lipoproteins. In addition, we showed that the size of the endoplasmic reticulum cholesterol pool and the set point of the homeostatic sensor of cell cholesterol were approximately normal in NP-C cells. The plasma membrane cholesterol pools in both NP-C and amphiphile-treated cells were also normal. Furthermore, the build up of cholesterol in NP-C lysosomes was not a physiological response to cholesterol overload. Rather, it appeared that the accumulation in NP-C lysosomes results from an imbalance in the brisk flow of cholesterol among membrane compartments. In related experiments, we found that NP-C cells did not respond to class 2 amphiphiles (e.g.trifluoperazine, imipramine, and U18666A); these agents may therefore act directly on the NPC1 protein or on its pathway. Finally, we showed that the lysosomal cholesterol pool in NP-C cells was substantially and preferentially reduced by incubating cells with the oxysterols, 25-hydroxycholesterol and 7-ketocholesterol; these findings suggest a new pharmacological approach to the treatment of NP-C disease. Cholesterol accumulates to massive levels in cells from Niemann-Pick type C (NP-C) patients and in cells treated with class 2 amphiphiles that mimic NP-C disease. This behavior has been attributed to the failure of cholesterol released from ingested low density lipoproteins to exit the lysosomes. However, we now show that the rate of movement of cholesterol from lysosomes to plasma membranes in NP-C cells is at least as great as normal, as was also found previously for amphiphile-treated cells. Furthermore, the lysosomes in these cells filled with plasma membrane cholesterol in the absence of lipoproteins. In addition, we showed that the size of the endoplasmic reticulum cholesterol pool and the set point of the homeostatic sensor of cell cholesterol were approximately normal in NP-C cells. The plasma membrane cholesterol pools in both NP-C and amphiphile-treated cells were also normal. Furthermore, the build up of cholesterol in NP-C lysosomes was not a physiological response to cholesterol overload. Rather, it appeared that the accumulation in NP-C lysosomes results from an imbalance in the brisk flow of cholesterol among membrane compartments. In related experiments, we found that NP-C cells did not respond to class 2 amphiphiles (e.g.trifluoperazine, imipramine, and U18666A); these agents may therefore act directly on the NPC1 protein or on its pathway. Finally, we showed that the lysosomal cholesterol pool in NP-C cells was substantially and preferentially reduced by incubating cells with the oxysterols, 25-hydroxycholesterol and 7-ketocholesterol; these findings suggest a new pharmacological approach to the treatment of NP-C disease.

Characteristically, NP-C cells accumulate massive amounts of cholesterol in abundant cytoplasmic vacuoles; these bear lysosomal markers, are packed with membrane whorls, and are of low buoyant density (1.Blanchette-Mackie E.J.

It has been speculated that these vesicles facilitate the transport of endocytic cholesterol to the plasma membrane; however, the mechanisms mediating intracellular cholesterol transport are not well understood (12.Liscum L. Munn N.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 19-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). From the start, the experimental hallmark of NP-C cells has been a delay of several hours in the exit of ingested LDL cholesterol from the lysosomes (13.Pentchev P.G. Boothe A.D. Kruth H.S.

However, this lag is seen only in cells that have been incubated for several days in the absence of LDL. Because of this unphysiological treatment, the significance of the lag phenomenon has been questioned (17.Shamburek R.D. Pentchev P.G. Zech L.A. Blanchette-Mackie J. Carstea E.D. VandenBroek J.M.

Indeed, the efflux of lysosomal cholesterol in NP-C cells under typical culture conditions has not been clearly determined. The observation that the entire cholesterol pool in cultured fibroblasts circulates between lysosomes and plasma membranes suggests that it may not be trapped (5.Lange Y. Ye J. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18915-18922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Similarly, cholesterol exits the lysosomes promptly both in vitro (18.Cruz J.C. Sugii S., Yu, C.

Many of the key features of the NP-C phenotype are mimicked by fibroblasts treated with a variety of drugs and experimental agents called class 2 amphiphiles; these compounds are typically steroids or hydrophobic amines (4.Kobayashi T.

It is therefore possible that class 2 amphiphiles act upon the NPC1 protein or along its pathway (25.Lange Y. Steck T.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Given these unsettled issues, we re-examined the movement of cholesterol in NP-C and amphiphile-treated cells in order to address the following questions. (a) Is there a block in lysosomal cholesterol transport in NP-C cells? (b) Is the extensive accumulation of cholesterol a misguided homeostatic response of NP-C cells to the underestimation of their cholesterol load? (c) In particular, is the putative sensor of cell cholesterol perturbed in NP-C cells? (d) In that case, does the altered sensor cause an expansion of the plasma membrane cholesterol pool, leading to spillover of cholesterol to the lysosomes (3.Sokol J. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Kruth H.S. Dwyer N.K. Amende L.M. Butler J.D. Robinson E. Patel S. Brady R.O. Comly M.E. Vanier M.T. Pentchev P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3411-3417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)? (e) Do class 2 amphiphiles act on the NPC1 protein pathway (25.Lange Y. Steck T.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar)? (f) Can the pool of excess lysosomal cholesterol be reduced pharmacologically? [oleoyl-1-14C]Coenzyme A was purchased from NEN Life Science Products; [1α,2α-3H]cholesteryl oleate and [1α,2α-3H]cholesterol were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. 4-Methylumbelliferyl β-d-galactopyranosidase was from Molecular Probes. Hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPCD) from Research Plus, Inc. (Bayonne, NJ), was complexed with cholesterol as described (26.Klein U. Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13784-13793Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). LPDS was prepared from FBS (27.Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7306-7314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Normal human foreskin fibroblasts were obtained as described (28.Echevarria F. Norton R.A. Nes W.D. Lange Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8484-8489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human NP-C fibroblast cell lines 93.59 and 93.41 were generously provided by Peter Pentchev (National Institutes of Health); the two lines lacked detectable NPC1 protein and behaved similarly. All fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μmg/ml streptomycin, and 10% FBS. 25-RA, a mutant Chinese hamster ovary cell line generously provided by T.-Y. Chang (Dartmouth University), was grown in Ham's-F12 medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mmglutamine, and 10% FBS. For cholesterol depletion experiments, 10% FBS was replaced by 5% LPDS. Controls for incubations with drugs contained the solvent at <1% of volume. The cholesterol content of cells (plasma membranes) was reduced by HPCD extraction and augmented by incubation with HPCD·cholesterol complexes (29.Lange, Y., Ye, J., Rigney, M., and Steck, T. L.

Lipid. Res. 2264–2270Google Scholar) were as described. ER cholesterol was taken as the total cholesterol esterified when whole cell homogenates were reacted to completion with 30 μm[14C]oleoyl-CoA for 2 h at 37 °C (32.Lange Y. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13103-13108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). For this determination, a [3H]cholesteryl oleate standard was added to correct for subsequent losses; cholesteryl esters were isolated by thin layer chromatography, and their radioactivity was determined. The mass of cholesterol esterified was calculated from the14C radioactivity using the known specific activity of the [14C]oleoyl-CoA added (32.Lange Y. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13103-13108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Because aqueous solutions of HPCD efficiently extract plasma membrane but not intracellular cholesterol (9.Neufeld E.B. Wastney M. Patel S. Suresh S. Cooney A.M. Dwyer N.K. Roff C.F. Ohno K. Morris J.A. Carstea E.D. Incardona J.P. Strauss III, J.F. Vanier M.T. Patterson M.C. Brady R.O. Pentchev P.G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9627-9635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), we used this agent to determine the time course of transfer of lysosomal cholesterol to the plasma membrane, as follows. Cells in 75-cm2 flasks were incubated at 37 °C for short or long intervals in growth medium with ∼0.6 μCi of [3H]cholesterol dissolved in a trace of ethanol. The medium was then removed, and the cells were rinsed with PBS, dissociated with trypsin, resuspended in growth medium, and placed in two 25-cm2 flasks to which they reattached within ∼3 h. (This replating minimized contamination by the extracellular [3H]cholesterol adsorbed to the plastic in the first flask.) One flask was assayed immediately for cholesterol mass and label as well as protein. The duplicate flask was incubated at 37 °C with complexes of HPCD (27 mg/ml) plus cholesterol (30 μg/ml, final) in PBS. (The concentration of HPCD used was near saturation for the exchange process; the amount of unlabeled cholesterol complexed with the HPCD was that which kept total cell cholesterol constant to within 15% during the exchange incubation.) The medium was changed at frequent intervals (5–30 min) to make the efflux of label quasi-irreversible. At each time point, duplicate aliquots were centrifuged, and the medium was counted. At the end of the time course, the cells were also assayed for cholesterol label and mass as well as protein. The data, expressed as the fraction of radioactivity transferred to the medium, were analyzed by fitting to a rate equation for a two-step process as follows: (a) the irreversible efflux from the plasma membrane to the exogenous HPCD, and (b) a reversible equilibration between intracellular (lysosomal) and plasma membrane compartments. For simplicity, we assumed that the two rate constants describing the reversible step were the same. The distribution of cholesterol mass between the surface and interior of cells can be determined by selectively labeling the plasma membrane with a pulse of exogenous [3H]cholesterol and then determining the cholesterol mass, label, and specific activity in a sample of the plasma membrane pool (obtained here by a brief extraction of the cell surface with aqueous HPCD) and in the residual cells. Specifically, replicate monolayers of confluent cells were rinsed and covered with PBS containing ∼2 μCi of [3H]cholesterol dissolved in the benign vehicle, Triton WR-1339 (final ∼0.025%), for 15 min at room temperature. The label was removed, and the monolayers were rinsed with PBS containing 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The cells were then dissociated, washed, and resuspended in PBS. Aliquots of the suspension were taken for the determination of protein and cholesterol mass. The remaining cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with 2% HPCD in PBS to remove about 30% of the plasma membrane cholesterol. After a brief centrifugation, the cell pellets and media were analyzed for cholesterol mass and radioactivity. Precision improved with the amount of cholesterol extracted, but estimates of the distribution did not change appreciably. It is assumed in this analysis that (a) the HPCD sampled the cell surface but not the intracellular pool, and (b) the plasma membrane and intracellular pools did not exchange mass or label during the assay. The first assumption has been validated by filipin staining HPCD-extracted NP-C cells (9.Neufeld E.B. Wastney M. Patel S. Suresh S. Cooney A.M. Dwyer N.K. Roff C.F. Ohno K. Morris J.A. Carstea E.D. Incardona J.P. Strauss III, J.F. Vanier M.T. Patterson M.C. Brady R.O. Pentchev P.G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9627-9635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar); see also Table II. The second issue was addressed by using brief assay times and low temperatures to minimize transfer between the plasma membrane and intracellular pools. In particular, we labeled the cells at room temperature in order to reduce intracellular cholesterol movement. Furthermore, cholesterol moves from the plasma membrane to the intracellular (lysosomal) pools at about 5%/h (5.Lange Y. Ye J. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18915-18922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), so that only a few percent of the label might redistribute during the 15-min extraction period. Whereas cholesterol moves rapidly between the plasma membrane and ER (33.Lange Y. Strebel F. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13838-13843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the latter pool is typically <1% of the former pool so that even complete equilibration between them would not affect our findings.Table IIResponse of NP-C lysosomal cholesterol to plasma membrane depletionPreincubationChaseTotal cell cholesterolPlasma membrane cholesterolIntracellular cholesterolhμg cholesterol/mg cell proteinLPDS alone01073968LPDS + HPCD0992970LPDS + HPCD3923853Replicate flasks were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C in growth medium containing 5% LPDS ± 2.5% HPCD and then chased in growth medium containing 5% LPDS for 0 or 3 h.

Open table in a new tab Replicate flasks were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C in growth medium containing 5% LPDS ± 2.5% HPCD and then chased in growth medium containing 5% LPDS for 0 or 3 h. The distribution of cell cholesterol was then determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The values shown are averages of duplicate determinations that agreed to within 5%; two other experiments gave comparable results. To calculate the subcellular distribution of cholesterol, we defined three compartments as follow: 1) the intracellular pool; 2) the plasma membrane; and 3) the extraction medium containing HPCD. LetM i(t),H i(t), and ηi(t) be the cholesterol mass, radioactivity, and specific activity (dpm [3H]cholesterol/μg cholesterol), respectively, in compartment i at time t. Let ηcell(t) be the specific activity of the whole cells at time t. In Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3, Equation 4 we assume the following. M1(t)+M2(t)+M3(t)=constant (cholesterol mass conserved)Equation 1 M2(t)+M3(t)=constant (plasma membrane cholesterol mass conserved)Equation 2 M1(t)=constant (intracellular cholesterol mass conserved)Equation 3 H2(t)+H3(t)Equation 4 =constant (plasma membrane radioactivity conserved)Because the HPCD samples only the plasma membrane, the specific activity of the cholesterol in the medium equals that of the plasma membrane at all times. That is, η3(t)=H3(t)/M3(t)=η2(t)=H2(t)/M2(t)Equation 5 By definition: ηcell(t)=H2(t)/(M1(t)+M2(t))Equation 6 Since the plasma membrane is the sole source of HPCD-cholesterol in the medium. M2(t)=M2(0)−M3(t)that is M3(t)=M2(0)−M2(t)Equation 7 From Equation 5, we get M2(t)=H2(t)/η3(t)Equation 8 The fraction of cell cholesterol initially residing in the plasma membrane of the cells, R, is given by R=M2(0)/[M1(0)+M2(0)]Equation 9 The numerator in Equation 9 can be substituted from Equation 7, and the denominator can be replaced by the expressionM 1(t) +M 2(t) + M3(t). Thus Equation 9 can be written: R=[M2(t)+M3(t)]/[M1(t)+M2(t)+M3(t)]Equation 10 Substituting from Equation 8 into the numerator and Equation 6into the denominator: R={[H2(t)/η3(t)]+M3(t)}/{[H2(t)/ηcell(t)]+M3(t)}Equation 11 Assay of the cell pellet provided bothH 2(t) and ηcell(t).M 3(t) and η3(t) were determined by assaying the medium. We determined the distribution of cholesterol between plasma membrane and intracellular compartments by a new method (see “Experimental Procedures”). As illustrated in TableI, 83% of the cholesterol in the normal human fibroblasts was found in the plasma membrane. This value is in excellent agreement with those determined by three other methods (34.Lange Y. Swaisgood M.H. Ramos B.V. Steck T.L. J. Biol.

The present method has the advantage of simplicity and avoids the problem of cross-contamination of organelles encountered in density gradient fractionation.Table ICholesterol distribution in NP-C cells and fibroblasts treated with U18666AFibroblastsTotal cell cholesterolPlasma membrane cholesterolIntracellular cholesterolFraction in plasma membraneFraction intracellularFraction intracellular (published)nμg cholesterol/mg cell protein (S.D.)%%%nRef.A Control535 (2)29 (1)6 (1)83171034.Lange Y.

The cholesterol in the plasma membrane of NP-C fibroblasts was about 20% greater than normal (Table I, part A). In contrast, the intracellular cholesterol pools in the NP-C cells were increased roughly 10-fold. These results are consistent with those obtained by density gradient fractionation, where about two-thirds of NP-C cell cholesterol was in buoyant vacuoles containing acid hydrolases, and about one-third was in the plasma membrane fraction (Table I, part A, last column). It is well known that class 2 amphiphiles induce the steady accumulation of lysosomal cholesterol in normal fibroblasts (22.Liscum L. Underwood K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15443-15446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 23.Pentchev P.G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Liscum L. Subcell.

We now show that plasma membrane cholesterol is not altered by U18666A, a prototypic class 2 agent (Table I, parts B and C). Once again, the distribution of cellular cholesterol obtained by the new method agreed well with data from density gradient fractionation (TableI, part C, last column). As one approach to determining the rate of exit of cholesterol from the lysosomes of NP-C cells, we followed its redistribution following the acute depletion of surface cholesterol by HPCD extraction. Most of the cholesterol extracted came from within the cell (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the average absolute rate of loss of intracellular NP-C cholesterol over the 5-h incubation, 5 μg of cholesterol/mg of protein/h, is comparable to the rate of movement of lysosomal cholesterol to the plasma membrane determined for normal human fibroblasts (5.Lange Y. Ye J. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18915-18922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The present value presumably underestimates the true rate of transport of lysosomal cholesterol to the plasma membrane, since (a) it is somewhat limited by the submaximal rate of extraction by the HPCD, and (b) it disregards plasma membrane cholesterol movement back to the lysosomes.

The regulatory properties ofEscherichia coli were investigated by mutating six charged residues involved in interdomain salt bridges (Arg271, Arg292, Asp297, and Lys413) and in the binding of the allosteric activator (Lys382 and Arg431). Arg271 and Lys413 are located at the interface between A and C domains within one subunit. The R271L and K413Q mutant enzymes exhibit altered kinetic properties. In K413Q, there is partial enzyme activation, whereas R271L is characterized by a bias toward the T-state in the allosteric equilibrium. In the T-state, Arg292 and Asp297form an intersubunit salt bridge. The mutants R292D and D297R are totally inactive. The crystal structure of R292D reveals that the mutant enzyme retains the T-state quaternary structure. However, the mutation induces a reorganization of the interface with the creation of a network of interactions similar to that observed in the crystal structures of R-state yeast and M1 PK proteins. Furthermore, in the R292D structure, two loops that are part of the active site are disordered. The K382Q and R431E mutations were designed to probe the binding site for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, the allosteric activator. R431E exhibits only slight changes in the regulatory properties. Conversely, K382Q displays a highly altered responsiveness to the activator, suggesting that Lys382 is involved in both activator binding and allosteric transition mechanism. Taken together, these results support the notion that domain interfaces are critical for the allosteric transition. They couple changes in the tertiary and quaternary structures to alterations in the geometry of the fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and substrate binding sites.

PK requires monovalent (K+) and divalent cations (Mg2+ or Mn2+) for its activity. The reaction is essentially irreversible under physiological conditions and is critical for the control of the metabolic flux in the second part of glycolysis. Moreover, the substrate PEP and the product pyruvate are involved in a variety of metabolic pathways. Such a central position in the cellular metabolism is reflected in the regulatory properties of PK, which is a typical allosteric protein (1.Fothergill L.A. Michels P.A. Prog. Mol. Biol. Biophys. 1993; 59: 105-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The activity is controlled by several physiological effectors, including H+, Mg2+, Mn2+, and K+(2.Mesecar A.D. Nowak T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6792-6802Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the enzyme displays sigmoidal kinetics toward the substrate PEP and it is activated by an heterotropic effector whose nature depends on the organism (1.Fothergill L.A. Michels P.A. Prog. Mol. Biol. Biophys. 1993; 59: 105-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 3.Mattevi A. Bolognesi M. Valentini G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The mammalian isoenzymes R (expressed in erythrocytes), L (in liver), and M2 (in kidney and lung) are regulated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) (4.Noguchi T. Inoue H. Tanaka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13807-13812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in trypanosomatid protozoans the allosteric effector is fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (5.Van Schaftingen E. Opperdoes F.R. Hers H.-G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 153: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Most bacterial PKs are activated by FBP, although in some cases the effector is a monophosphorylated sugar such as ribose 5-phosphate. Thus far, the only known PK displaying hyperbolic kinetics is the mammalian M1 isoenzyme that is present in muscle, brain, and heart. However, the M1 protein is thought to be a highly specialized descendant of the allosteric PKs, locked in an active R-like conformation (6.Ikeda Y. Tanaka T. Noguchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20495-20501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). PK has been characterized from a number of prokaryotes and eukaryotes and in most cases has been found to exist as a tetramer of identical subunits, each consisting of approximately 500 residues (Fig.1 A) (1.Fothergill L.A. Michels P.A. Prog. Mol. Biol. Biophys. 1993; 59: 105-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Crystal structures are available for the enzyme from cat and rabbit muscle (7.Allen S.C.

Structure. 1998; 6: 195-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), Escherichia coli (10.Mattevi A. Valentini G. Rizzi M. Speranza M.L. Bolognesi M. Coda A. Structure. 1995; 3: 729-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and Leishmania mexicana (11.Rigden D.J. Phillips S.E.V. Michels P.A.M. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 615-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These proteins share a very similar architecture. Each subunit consists of three domains (Fig. 1 B): the A domain with the classic (α/β)8 topology, the B domain with a somewhat irregular fold, and the C domain with an α+β organization. The eukaryotic proteins contain an additional small N-terminal domain, which is absent in the E. coli enzyme. The active site is located on the C-terminal side of the A domain (α/β)8 barrel, facing the cleft between the A and B domains. The complex between yeast PK and FBP has revealed that the FBP binding site is entirely located in the C domain, at more than 40 Å from the catalytic center (9.Jurica M.S. Mesecar A. Heath P.J. Shi W. Nowak T. Stoddard B.L. Structure. 1998; 6: 195-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Four identical subunits are assembled to form the tetrameric enzyme with 222 symmetry. The subunits mainly interact through the A and C domains located along the molecular twofold axes (Fig. 1 A). Progress in the knowledge of the allosteric regulation was obtained by comparison of the T-state E. coli PK with the non-allosteric muscle M1 enzyme in the active R-like conformation (10.Mattevi A. Valentini G. Rizzi M. Speranza M.L. Bolognesi M. Coda A. Structure. 1995; 3: 729-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The study demonstrated that each individual domain approximates a rigid body. On transition from the T- to the R-state, the domains of the functional tetramer modify their relative orientation by up to 29°. These movements are coupled to a conformational change in the active center, which upon transition to the T-state undergoes a distortion of the PEP binding site. The recent structure determination of the yeast R-state (9.Jurica M.S. Mesecar A. Heath P.J. Shi W. Nowak T. Stoddard B.L. Structure. 1998; 6: 195-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) and the L. mexicana T-state (11.Rigden D.J. Phillips S.E.V. Michels P.A.M. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 615-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) proteins helped to refine this model, by allowing a better discrimination between the genuine allosteric conformational changes and those due to the inherent structural divergence between the mammalian and bacterial proteins. However, the complete and detailed elucidation of the mechanism for the allosteric transition must await the determination of the structure of the same PK crystallized in both active and inactive conformations. The “domain rotation model” implies that PK must be equipped with structural elements that enable the coupling of the domain movements to conformational changes in the active site. In this context, the interfaces between domains and subunits are predicted to be critical for the enzyme regulation (3.Mattevi A. Bolognesi M. Valentini G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 6.Ikeda Y. Tanaka T. Noguchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20495-20501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 9.Jurica M.S. Mesecar A. Heath P.J. Shi W. Nowak T. Stoddard B.L.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2949-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The intrasubunit interface between the A and C domains may take part in the transmission of the allosteric signal between PEP and FBP binding sites. Likewise, the contact region between twofold related A (A/A′ interface along thevertical axis in Fig. 1 A) and C domains (along the horizontal axis in Fig.1 A) may fulfil the role of coupling changes in the quaternary structure with modifications of the active center. To test these predictions, we have undertaken a site-directed mutagenesis study on the E. coli FBP-dependent PK. These experiments were guided by the knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme crystallized in the T-state. Our approach was to mutate charged amino acid residues involved in interdomain salt bridges in the A/C and A/A′ interfaces and to evaluate the effect of the substitutions on the enzyme activity and regulation. In addition, we replaced charged residues involved in the binding of FBP to elucidate the mechanism of responsiveness to the heterotropic activator. A total of six mutant proteins were prepared and analyzed by kinetic, thermal inactivation, and crystallographic methods. These data essentially agree with the proposed model for the allosteric transition and highlight the complexity of the enzyme, which has the remarkable ability to transmit a regulatory signal across long distances spanning different domains and subunits. Restriction and DNA modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. FBP, PEP, lactate dehydrogenase, and NADH were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. Other chemicals were reagent grade and obtained from Sigma or Aldrich. For mutagenesis the double-stranded plasmid pGV5A (13.Valentini G. Mattevi A. Barillà V. Galizzi A. Speranza M.L. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 719-721PubMed Google Scholar), a pBluescript II KS expression vector carrying the pykI gene, was employed. The procedure followed the protocol of Deng and Nickoloff (14.Nickoloff J.A. Deng W.P. Miller E.M. Ray F.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 58: 455-468PubMed Google Scholar), using the commercially available Chameleon™ double-stranded site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The method consists of the denaturation of double-stranded plasmid DNA and resynthesis of one strand using two primers; one, the selection primer, changes a restriction site, whereas the second, or mutagenic primer, introduces the desired mutation. Following digestion with the enzyme recognizing the old restriction site to linearize the unmutated parental plasmid, the surviving plasmid molecules are transformed into a repair-deficient E. colistrain (XLmutS). The primers used for constructing the point mutations were the following (the underlined sequences indicate the mutated bases): R271L, AAATGTATCCGTGCACTTAAAGTCGTTATCACT; R292D, AACCCACGCCCGACTGACGCAGAAGCCGGTGAC; D297R, CGCGCAGAAGCCGGTCGCGTTGCAAACGCCATC; K382Q, GCTACTCAGGGCGGTCAATCTGCTCGCGCAGTA; K413Q, CAGTTGGTACTGAGCCAAGGCGTTGTGCCGCAG; R431E, TCTACTGATGATTTCTACGAACTGGGTAAAGAACTGGCT. The selection primer used for changing the vector unique restriction site AflIII into StyI had the following sequence: CGCAGGAAAGACCTTGGGAGCAAAAGGCC. Plasmids isolated from cultures of individual transformants were screened by StyI digestion. More than 50% of the plasmids containing the StyI site also contained the desired point mutation, as confirmed by DNA sequencing of the entire pykI gene. Sequencing of double-stranded DNA was performed by the dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method using Thermosequenase™ kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (15.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52770) Google Scholar). E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells transformed with the plasmid pGV5A or its mutant derivatives were grown overnight in a Luria-Bertani medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The cells were then diluted (1/30 v/v) in a freshly prepared growth medium, and cultures were grown at 37 °C until the optical density at 600 nm reached a value in the range 0.8–1.2. At that point expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.6 mm. After 3 h of induction, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. Recombinant enzyme production was calculated by dividing the total activity of the culture by the specific activity of the purified enzyme after deduction of endogenous PK activity. Recombinant wild-type and mutant forms of PK were purified as described previously (13.Valentini G. Mattevi A. Barillà V. Galizzi A. Speranza M.L. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 719-721PubMed Google Scholar). All buffers contained 1 mm EDTA and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Cells collected by centrifugation were sonicated in a solution consisting of 10 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 30 μg/ml pancreatic DNase. After DNA digestion, cell debris was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was loaded onto a DEAE Sephacel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (4 × 32 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 100 mmKCl. The protein was eluted with 1200 ml of a linear gradient of KCl (0.1–0.5 m KCl in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.5) and subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation (70% saturation). Next, it was applied to a Octyl-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (4 × 20 cm) equilibrated with 50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, and 1.17 mammonium sulfate. Elution was performed with 1000 ml of a linear gradient of decreasing ammonium sulfate (1.17–0 m) and increasing ethylene glycol (0–50% v/v) concentrations. The enzyme preparation was divided into two aliquots, and each of them was applied to a Sephacryl S-200 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (1.9 × 100 cm) equilibrated in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The protein was eluted with the equilibration buffer. Protein concentration was determined according to Lowry (16.Lowry O.M. Rosebrough M.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as standard. The level of expression of most of the mutants was comparable to that of the recombinant wild-type enzyme (30–100 mg/liter of culture). The endogenous activity of the control cells transformed with pBluescript II KS was less than 150 units/liter of culture, that is less than 1 mg of endogenous enzyme/liter of culture. The final preparations were judged to be more than 95% pure from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis (17.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). In most cases, each preparation produced at least 20–25 mg of purified enzyme/liter of culture. The endogenous PK activity was undetectable in the preparations of pure mutant proteins, as proved by the complete absence of activity in the preparations of the R292D and D297R mutants (see “Results”). PK activity was determined at 25 °C by the lactate dehydrogenase-coupled spectrophotometric assay (18.Bücher T. Pfeiderer G. Methods Enzymol. 1955; 1: 435-440Crossref Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture contained: 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm PEP, 2 mm FBP, 2 mm ADP, 0.12 mm NADH, and 22 units of crystalline lactate dehydrogenase in a final volume of 1 ml. The reaction was started by adding enzyme solution. One unit is the amount of enzyme catalyzing the oxidation of 1 μmol of NADH/min under the above conditions. Enzymatic activity was assayed at 25 °C using various concentrations of PEP, ADP, and FBP under conditions identical to those above except for substrates and effector. Kinetic parameters were determined as follows: for PEP at fixed concentration of 2 mm ADP in the absence and in the presence of 2 mm FBP; for ADP at 2 mm PEP and 2 mm FBP; for FBP at 1 mm PEP and 2 mm ADP. In all cases, the enzyme activity was assayed at 10 different concentrations of substrate or effector. All measurements were performed in triplicate, and the plot of Lineweaver-Burk was used to determine V max and apparentK m values. The Hill plot was used to determine the apparent S 0,5 (the substrate concentration giving one-half of V max) andn H (Hill coefficient) values. Thermal stability studies were carried out at 55 °C in the absence and in the presence of 2 mm FBP. The enzyme (100–200 μg/ml) was incubated in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mmEDTA, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Samples were removed at intervals and rapidly cooled in ice, and the enzyme activity measured as described previously. Crystals of the R271L and R292D mutants were obtained using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at conditions (12% w/v polyethylene glycol 4000, 20 mm KCl, 20 mm MgSO4, 50 mm MES, pH 6.5) identical to those used for the wild-type enzyme (10.Mattevi A. Valentini G. Rizzi M. Speranza M.L. Bolognesi M. Coda A. Structure. 1995; 3: 729-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The absence from the crystallization medium of PEP, FBP, or other activating molecules is consistent with the protein being crystallized in the inactive T-state. The diffraction data for the R271L and R292D mutants were collected at the x-ray diffraction beam-line of Elettra (Trieste, Italy) at 100 K. Before freezing, the crystals were exposed for a few seconds to a solution containing 15% w/v polyethylene glycol 4000, 25% v/v polyethylene glycol 400, 20 mm KCl, 20 mm MgSO4, and 50 mm MES, pH 6.5. The data were processed using MOSFLM (written by A. G. Leslie) and programs of the CCP4 (19.Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) suite. Crystals of the mutants are isomorphous to those of the wild-type protein and belong to space group P212121. Crystallographic refinement was performed with the program REFMAC (20.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar), whereas model building was done using the program O (21.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Tight non-crystallographic restrains were applied throughout the refinement following the same protocol used for the native structure (10.Mattevi A. Valentini G. Rizzi M. Speranza M.L. Bolognesi M. Coda A. Structure. 1995; 3: 729-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The freeR-factor was calculated employing the same reflections used for the free R-factor calculations in the refinement of the wild-type protein. Table I gives a summary of the data collection and refinement statistics. Analysis of the model was done with the O (21.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

An intriguing feature of the PK structure is the large 40-Å separation between the FBP binding site, located in the C domain (9.Jurica M.S. Mesecar A. Heath P.J. Shi W. Nowak T. Stoddard B.L. Structure. 1998; 6: 195-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), and the catalytic center, in the A domain (Fig. 1 B). The enzyme must be equipped with structural components that are able to transmit the allosteric signal over such a long distance across the two domains. The crystal structure of the T-state E. coli PK shows that the interface between the A and C domains comprises several polar amino acids. Among them, the positively charged side chains of Arg271 and Lys413 are engaged in interdomain salt bridges. These residues were chosen as target for site-directed mutagenesis to probe the role of interdomain interactions in the allosteric transition and signal transduction between catalytic and allosteric sites. Lys413 belongs to the loop connecting helix Cα4 and strand Cβ3 of the C domain (Fig. 1 B). Its side chain amino group makes a salt bridge with the carboxylate of Asp336, which is located on the surface of the A domain (α/β)8barrel (distance between Lys413-NE and Asp336-OD1 of 2.7 Å). The K413Q mutation introduces a side chain, which, although uncharged, is expected to produce little perturbation on the protein three-dimensional structure. However, thermal inactivation studies revealed that the loss of the positive charge had a marked effect on the enzyme function. Incubation of the K413Q mutant at 55 °C leads to a rapid enzyme inactivation, both in the presence and absence of FBP (Table IV). Moreover, several kinetic parameters are considerably affected by the mutation (Tables II andIII). The Hill coefficient for FBP binding decreases from a value of 1.96 in the wild type to a value of 1.0 in the mutant, implying that cooperativity in FBP binding has been abolished. Furthermore, the saturation"

To investigate the effect of SR-BI on atherogenesis, we examined two lines of SR-BI transgenic mice with high (10-fold increases) and low (2-fold increases) SR-BI expression in an inbred mouse background hemizygous for a human apolipoprotein (apo) B transgene. Unlike non-HDL cholesterol levels that minimally differed in the various groups of animals, HDL cholesterol levels were inversely related to SR-BI expression. Mice with the low expression SR-BI transgene had a 50% reduction in HDL cholesterol, whereas the high expression SR-BI transgene was associated with 2-fold decreases in HDL cholesterol as well as dramatic alterations in HDL composition and size including the near absence of α-migrating particles as determined by two-dimensional electrophoresis. The low expression SR-BI/apo B transgenics had more than a 2-fold decrease in the development of diet-induced fatty streak lesions compared with the apo B transgenics (4448 ± 1908 μm2/aorta to 10133 ± 4035 μm2/aorta; p < 0.001), whereas the high expression SR-BI/apo B transgenics had an atherogenic response similar to that of the apo B transgenics (14692 ± 7238 μm2/aorta) but 3-fold greater than the low SR-BI/apo B mice (p < 0.001). The prominent anti-atherogenic effect of moderate SR-BI expression provides in vivosupport for the hypothesis that HDL functions to inhibit atherogenesis through its interactions with SR-BI in facilitating reverse cholesterol transport. The failure of the high SR-BI/apo B transgenics to have similar or even greater reductions in atherogenesis suggests that the changes resulting from extremely high SR-BI expression including dramatic changes in lipoproteins may have both pro- and anti-atherogenic consequences, illustrating the complexity of the relationship between SR-BI and atherogenesis.

Lancet. 1980; 2: 603-606Abstract PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have attempted to explain the properties of HDL that result in this relationship. A major postulated anti-atherogenic property of HDL involves the HDL particle participating in the metabolism of cholesterol through its transport of this lipid from the periphery to the liver, a process termed reverse cholesterol transport (3.Miller N.E. La Ville A. Crook D. Nature. 1985; 314: 109-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been proposed that the particle itself participates in inhibiting pro-atherogenic processes in the plasma and/or at the vessel wall via a variety of mechanisms including the inhibition of lipid peroxidation, cytokine-induced expression of adhesion molecules, and procoagulation processes (4.Parthasarathy S.

A significant advance in the understanding of how HDL may participate in cholesterol transport has been the identification and functional analyses of the scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI). This is the first HDL receptor to be well defined at the molecular level, andin vivo and in vitro studies have supported its participation in the selective uptake of HDL cholesterol (8.Acton S.

Many of the insights concerning the properties of this receptor in HDL metabolism have come from studies where SR-BI expression in mice has been altered by either somatic cell gene transfer or germ line manipulations. Transgene-mediated overexpression of SR-BI in mice resulted in dramatic reductions in plasma HDL (15.Wang N. Arai T. Ji Y. Rinninger F. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32920-32926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 16.Ueda Y. Royer L. Gong E. Zhang J. Cooper P.N. Francone O. Rubin E.M. J. Biol.

Donahee M.H. Rigotti A. Iqbal S.N. Edelman E.R. Krieger M. Nature. 1997; 387: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). These SR-BI overexpression results are consistent with studies of mice with decreases in SR-BI expression caused by gene targeting (12.Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L. Penman M. Rayburn H. Herz J. Krieger M.

Taken together, the in vivo and in vitro studies of SR-BI have consistently supported the suggested role of this molecule in reverse cholesterol transport. Although the mouse is relatively resistant to diet-induced atherogenesis, a variety of transgenic and gene knockout mice have been created over the last several years with increased atherogenic susceptibility. Mice overexpressing human apo B transgenes with prominent diet-induced hypercholesterolemia have been a useful background to assess the impact on atherogenesis of other putative pro- or anti-atherogenic genetic manipulations (17.Purcell-Huynh D.A. Farese Jr., R.V. Johnson D.F. Flynn L.M. Pierotti V. Newland D.L. Linton M.F. Sanan D.A. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2246-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 18.Callow M.J. Verstuyft J. Tangirala R. Palinski W. Rubin E.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1639-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The prominent diet-induced hypercholesterolemia and ensuing heightened atherosclerosis susceptibility of the apo B transgenics is the consequence of increased synthesis and decreased clearance of human apo B containing lipoproteins. FVB mice, the background strain of mice in this study, do not develop atherogenesis even when fed the atherogenic diet, whereas C57/BL6 mice do develop lesions on this diet. This difference allows us to study the well investigated mechanism of apo B-containing lipoprotein atherogenesis in the absence of an unknown mechanism that may be involved in the atherogenesis of C57/BL6 mice. In the present study investigating the effect of SR-BI overexpression on diet-induced atherogenesis, aortic fatty streak lesions were quantitatively assessed in animals hemizygous for a human apo B transgene compared with animals that, in addition to the human apo B transgene, contain SR-BI transgenes expressing at two different levels. These studies revealed that moderate increases in SR-BI expression, accompanied by moderate decreases in HDL concentration in the SR-BI/apo B transgenics, were associated with a significant reduction in atherogenesis. In contrast, significant increases in SR-BI expression accompanied by dramatic changes in HDL concentration, size, and composition were associated with an atherogenic susceptibility similar to animals exclusively expressing the human apo B transgene. The two lines of SR-BI transgenic mice used in this study were created in an FVB background and expressed the transgene specifically in the liver at levels approximately 2-fold (low SR-BI) and 10-fold (high SR-BI) higher than those of control FVB mice (16.Ueda Y. Royer L. Gong E. Zhang J. Cooper P.N. Francone O. Rubin E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7165-7171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The transgene in these mice was a construct where the human apo A-I promoter had been fused to an SR-BI genomic fragment at its initiation codon. The human apo B transgenic line (apo B) created and maintained in an inbred FVB background has previously been described (18.Callow M.J. Verstuyft J. Tangirala R. Palinski W. Rubin E.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1639-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Hemizygous high or low SR-BI transgenic mice were bred with hemizygous apo B mice to produce mice that either were nontransgenic, hemizygous for one transgene (high or low SR-BI or apo B), or doubly hemizygous for both transgenes (high SR-BI/apo B and low SR-BI/apo B). All mice used in this study were female. Total RNA (10 μg) isolated from livers using RNA Stat 60 (Teltest Inc., Friendswood, TX) were subjected to RNase protection assays. The expression of the endogenous SR-BI, the SR-BI transgene, and the LDL receptor (LDLr) gene was determined as described previously (16.Ueda Y. Royer L. Gong E. Zhang J. Cooper P.N. Francone O. Rubin E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7165-7171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Mice were fed Purina mouse chow (number 5001) until 6 weeks of age and then fed an atherogenic diet consisting of 1.25% cholesterol, 0.5% cholic acid, and 15% fat for 18 weeks (19.Nishina P.M. Verstuyft J. Paigen B. J. Lipid. Res. 1990; 31: 859-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blood samples from the tail vein after an overnight fast were collected at 6 weeks of age and 4 weeks after initiation of the atherogenic diet. Plasma levels of lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins were determined as described previously (16.Ueda Y. Royer L. Gong E. Zhang J. Cooper P.N. Francone O. Rubin E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7165-7171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Briefly, total cholesterol was determined by an enzymatic colorimetric assay using a kit (number 112756B Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Free cholesterol was determined using a commercially available kit (Wako, Osaka, Japan). Triglyceride and phospholipid concentrations were measured with Triglyceride/GB kit number 450032 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and Phospholipid B reagent (Wako), respectively. HDL cholesterol was measured after selective precipitation of non-HDL lipoproteins by dextran sulfate and magnesium chloride. Plasma levels of mouse apo A-I, apo B, and human apo B were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays as described previously (16.Ueda Y. Royer L. Gong E. Zhang J. Cooper P.N. Francone O.

Res. 1997; 38: 813-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two-dimensional nondenaturing electrophoresis and antibody blotting was carried out as described previously (21.Francone O.L. Royer L Haghpassand M. J. Lipid. Res. 1996; 37: 1268-1277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the first dimensional gel electrophoresis was run on a 0.75% agarose gel in 50 mm barbital buffer on Gelbond (FMC, Rockland, ME) and then placed on a 3–16% polyacrylamide gradient gel (Integrated Separation Systems, Natick, MA) in 25 mm Tris-glycine buffer (pH 8.3). Electrophoresis was carried out for 4.5 h. After transfer to Nitro Plus transfer membranes (Micron Separation Incorporated, Westboro, MA), the samples were treated with a biotinylated rabbit polyclonal antibody to murine apo AI (Biodesign, Kennebunk, ME) in 10 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.0 containing 2% milk. Apo AI-containing HDL species were visualized with 125I-labeled streptavidin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the nitrocellulose membranes were exposed to Fuji XLS film at −70 °C. Gradient gel electrophoresis and particle size distribution was determined by computer-assisted scanning densitometry as described (16.Ueda Y. Royer L. Gong E. Zhang J. Cooper P.N. Francone O. Rubin E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7165-7171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Pooled plasma samples of animals of each genotype were combined and fractionated using two tandem Superose 6 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (22.Yokode M. Hammer R.E. Ishibashi S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1990; 250: 1273-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Fractions containing either non-HDL or HDL were pooled and concentrated with Centricon concentrators (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA) for further lipid composition and apolipoprotein analyses. After 18 weeks of feeding the atherogenic diet, female mice of the various genotypes were sacrificed, and their hearts were collected. Aortic sectioning, lipid staining, and lesion scoring were performed as described previously with some modification (18.Callow M.J. Verstuyft J. Tangirala R. Palinski W. Rubin E.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1639-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, the heart and attached aorta were first perfused with phosphate-buffered saline and then perfused with diluted tissue embedding medium (Tissue-Tek O.C.T. (Miles Inc., Elkhart, IN):H2O, 1:1) and quickly frozen in O.C.T. 10-μm-thick sections were collected starting with the first and most proximal section of the aorta where the aorta becomes round and the aortic valves distinct. Sections were stained with oil-red O and hematoxylin; the lesion area was determined by measuring the oil-red O stained lesions using a calibrated eyepiece at 200× magnification. The mean lesion area/section/animal was determined for each individual animal. Significant differences between means were determined using the Mann-Whitney U test for nonparametric analysis. To quantitatively assess SR-BI expression and to distinguish expression of the SR-BI transgene from that of the endogenous SR-BI gene, we performed RNase protection assays of SR-BI in differing genetic and dietary environments. Results were normalized densitometrically against the β-actin signal. Neither the SR-BI nor the human apo B transgenes altered the expression of the endogenous SR-BI gene (Fig. 1). The endogenous SR-BI expression levels also were not affected by diet-induced hypercholesterolemia. These results are inconsistent with the previous report (23.Fluiter K. van der Westhuijzen D.R. van Berkel T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8434-8438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A possible explanation is that RNase protection assays, which we performed with total liver RNA, may mask the reciprocal effects on parenchymal and nonparenchymal cells as previously reported. The SR-BI transgenes in this study, consistent with their previous analysis (16.Ueda Y. Royer L. Gong E. Zhang J. Cooper P.N. Francone O. Rubin E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7165-7171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), expressed at levels more than 10-fold (high SR-BI transgenics) and 2-fold (low SR-BI transgenics) higher than that of the endogenous SR-BI genes on both the chow and the atherogenic diet. The RNase protection assays for mouse LDLr analyzed the response of this gene to diet as well as SR-BI genotype. The presence of an SR-BI transgene did not alter the LDLr expression levels, and LDLr expression was down-regulated after the atherogenic diet treatment in every genotype. This suggests that the atherogenic diet treatment results in increases in hepatocellular cholesterol concentrations of sufficient magnitude to down-regulate LDLr expression. Human apo B transgene induces up-regulation of LDLr with chow diet and higher response to the atherogenic diet compared with wild type mice. Human apo B-containing LDL may block the interaction between mouse apo B and LDLr while not being internalized, resulting in up-regulation of LDLr. When fed mouse chow, the SR-BI expression level was inversely associated with total, HDL, and non-HDL cholesterol concentrations in apo B transgenic mice (Fig.2, a–c). Relationship of plasma human apo B levels to genotype was similar to that of cholesterol, whereas plasma mouse apo B levels did not show this trend (Fig. 2, a–e). The atherogenic diet treatment, however, led to dramatic increases in total cholesterol levels in all the transgenic lines studied (Fig. 2 f). Notably, non-HDL cholesterol concentrations in each of the three genotypes studied was no longer inversely related to SR-BI expression levels when the animals were fed the atherogenic diet (Fig. 2 h). Non-HDL cholesterol levels were similar in low SR-BI/apo B and apo B transgenic mice, whereas high SR-BI/apo B transgenic mice had significant increases in non-HDL cholesterol concentrations compared with the low SR-BI/apo B mice. There no longer exists any significant difference in human apo B levels among the three genotypes of animals after the atherogenic diet treatment (Fig. 2 j). Unlike the changes in non-HDL cholesterol in response to the atherogenic diet, HDL cholesterol levels remained inversely related to SR-BI expression levels in these animals (Fig. 2, b and g). These results were identical in animals after either 4 or 18 weeks on the atherogenic diet. Male mice of each genotype show characteristics in lipid and apolipoprotein analyses comparable with those in female mice (data not shown). To examine apolipoprotein distribution among lipoprotein fractions, mouse and human apo B and mouse apo A-I concentrations in FPLC fractions were measured in the different groups of animals fed the atherogenic diet (Fig. 3). Apo A-I concentrations in the HDL fractions decreased inversely with SR-BI expression level (Fig. 3 b). HDL lipid composition shows no significant differences between low SR-BI/apo B and apo B transgenics (Table I). In contrast, high level expression of SR-BI was associated with the generation of triglyceride-rich, phospholipid depleted HDL. Although there is no significant difference in human apo B concentrations in LDL/IDL fractions between low SR-BI/apo B and apo B transgenics, high SR-BI/apo B mice have higher concentrations of human apo B in these fractions (Fig. 3 c). Comparing lipid composition and apo B concentrations of LDL/IDL fractions (TableII) between the different groups of mice revealed no consistent pattern of differences in cholesterol, triglyceride, phospholipid, and apo B content in these particles with SR-BI expression level. These results suggest that these three lines of mice can serve as reagents for exploring the effect of SR-BI expression levels on atherogenesis in a large part, but not entirely, independent of its effect on non-HDL cholesterol.Table ILipid composition in HDL fractionsGenotypeUCCETGPLmg/mlmg/mlmg/mlmg/mlApo B1.2 (10%)3.3 (27%)0.19 (2%)7.7 (61%)Low SR-BI/apo B0.81 (10%)1.9 (23%)0.21 (3%)5.4 (64%)High SR-BI/apo B0.07 (8%)0.35 (38%)0.26 (28%)0.25 (26%)500 μl of pooled plasma from 4–6 mice of each genotype taken after atherogenic diet treatment were fractionated by FPLC as described under “Materials and Methods.” Fractions corresponding to HDL were pooled and assayed for lipid concentration as described under “Materials and Methods.” UC, unesterified cholesterol; CE, cholesteryl ester; TG, triglyceride; PL, phospholipid.

The effects of SR-BI on HDL subclass distribution was studied by two-dimensional nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (Fig.4). The size and distribution of pre β-HDL species was not affected by the level of expression of SR-BI, whereas the α HDL fraction, predominantly monodisperse, was influenced by the expression of SR-BI and is markedly decreased in high SR-BI/apo B plasma. Interestingly, the amount of a less prominent but distinct α HDL population of smaller particles was induced by SR-BI, suggesting a dose effect. The HDL particle size distribution in mice fed the atherogenic diet, as determined by gradient gel electrophoresis of HDL isolated by ultracentrifugation, is in agreement with a previous study (16.Ueda Y. Royer L. Gong E. Zhang J. Cooper P.N. Francone O. Rubin E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7165-7171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and consisted of a monodisperse population of particles. When SR-BI was overexpressed, there was a slight decrease in particle size in low expressors (9.39 ± 0.09 nm (n = 4)versus 9.51 ± 0.03 (n = 4) for low SR-BI/apo B and apo B mice, respectively) and the complete absence of large HDL particles with the appearance of a minor population of particles with peak diameter of 7.74 ± 0.15 nm (n= 6) in high expressors. To evaluate the effect of SR-BI overexpression and associated changes in lipoprotein metabolism on atherogenesis, the various lines of transgenic mice were fed the atherogenic diet for 18 weeks. Consistent with previous studies (17.Purcell-Huynh D.A. Farese Jr., R.V. Johnson D.F. Flynn L.M. Pierotti V. Newland D.L. Linton M.F. Sanan D.A. Young S.G. J. Clin.

Invest. 1995; 96: 1639-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), the 18-week atherogenic diet treatment resulted in large fatty streak lesions in the apo B mice (10133 ± 4035 μm2/aorta) (Fig.5 a). The apo B transgenics also containing the low expression SR-BI transgene had significantly smaller lesions (4448 ± 1908 μm2/aorta) than the mice expressing exclusively the human apo B transgene (p < 0.001). This difference in atherogenesis susceptibility between apo B and low SR-BI/apo B mice occurred in the setting of similar non-HDL cholesterol levels, despite the significant decreases in plasma HDL and apo A-I levels in the low SR-BI/apo B transgenics. The individual animal plots of the lesion area and HDL cholesterol levels (Fig. 5 b) indicate that low SR-BI/apo B mice develop smaller fatty streak lesions than apo B mice with similar plasma HDLc levels. This observation also is apparent when mice were subgrouped according to their non-HDLc levels (Fig.5 c). The effect on diet-induced atherogenesis of the high expression SR-BI transgene differed significantly from that of the low expression SR-BI transgene. The lesion area of high SR-BI/apo B transgenics was three times greater than that observed in low SR-BI/apo B animals (p < 0.001). High SR-BI/apo B transgenics also developed larger lesions (14692 ± 7238 μm2/aorta) than those expressing the apo B transgene alone, although this difference did not quite achieve statistical significance (p = 0.06) (Fig. 5 a). The effect of the differences in non-HDL cholesterol levels in the high SR-BI/apo B transgenics compared with the low SR-BI/apo B and apo B transgenics on atherogenesis was minimized when lesion area was compared in animals grouped according to similar non-HDL cholesterol concentrations. The lesion area of the high SR-BI/apo B transgenics with lower HDL cholesterol levels was larger than that of low SR-BI/apo B and the apo B transgenics, when comparing animals grouped at three similar levels of non-HDL cholesterol (Fig. 5 c). Analysis of SR-BI in several in vivo and in vitro studies has provided convincing evidence that SR-BI mediates the selective transport of cholesteryl ester into cells, a process intimately linked to how HDL is believed to participate in reverse cholesterol transport (8.Acton S.

In the present study we have investigated the relationship between murine atherogenesis and differing HDL cholesterol and hepatic SR-BI expression levels. The demonstration that the low SR-BI/apo B transgenic mice, despite low HDL cholesterol concentrations, are protected against diet-induced atherogenesis provides in vivo (25.Arai T. Wang N.

The effects of SR-BI on HDL speciation, size, and composition previously have been reported (12.Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L. Penman M. Rayburn H. Herz J. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12610-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar, 24.Trigatti B. Rayburn H. Vinals M. Braun A. Miettinen H. Penman M. Hertz J. Schrenzel M. Amigo L. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Proc.

In our studies, significant differences with regard to HDL lipid composition and particle distribution where noted in the high SR-BI/apo B transgenics compared with the low SR-BI/apo B transgenics and apo B transgenic control animals. The near complete absence of α-migrating HDL supports the hypothesized involvement of these particles in the later steps of reverse cholesterol transport (28.Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid. Res. 1995; 36: 211-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is in agreement with the increased HDL-cholesteryl ester clearance previously observed in the high SR-BI compared with the low SR-BI expressing transgenics (16.Ueda Y. Royer L. Gong E. Zhang J. Cooper P.N. Francone O. Rubin E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7165-7171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest increased reverse cholesterol transport in the high SR-BI transgenics compared with the two other groups of animals studied. The finding that the SR-BI/apo B mice have lower non-HDL as well as HDL cholesterol levels compared with apo B transgenics when fed the chow diet agrees with previous SR-BI transgenic studies, suggesting that the selective uptake of cholesteryl esters via SR-BI is not restricted to HDL but also includes non-HDL lipoproteins (15.Wang N.

Recently, SR-BI transgenics containing an inactive LDLr allele were shown to experience decreases in both HDL as well as non-HDL cholesterol when fed an atherogenic diet (25.Arai T. Wang N. Bezouevski M. Welch C. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2366-2371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to the results of the present study where the non-HDL cholesterol levels in both the low and high SR-BI/apo B transgenics, when fed a similar atherogenic diet, underwent marked increases which eliminated any significant difference between these mice and the apo B animals. FPLC analyses shown in Fig. 3indicate increases of non-HDLc and human apo B levels in high SR-BI/apo B mice, which are not significant in the plasma lipid analyses shown in Fig. 2. These findings suggest that the high influx of non-HDLc via overexpressed SR-BI may stimulate the secretion of lipoproteins, as well as down-regulate LDLr expression. To what extent this increase of non-HDL lipoproteins contributes to the atherogenic susceptibility in high SR-BI/apo B mice is to be investigated in a future study. A possible explanation for the increase of non-HDLc in SR-BI transgenic animals is that non-HDL lipoproteins may be a poor substrate for SR-BI. Because non-HDLc is not taken up as efficiently as HDLc via SR-BI, non-HDL lipoproteins saturate their binding sites in SR-BI when fed the atherogenic diet. This renders the levels of non-HDLc and apo B independent of SR-BI expression. The majority of non-HDL lipoproteins in these animals contain human apo B, which raises the possibility that human apo B containing lipoproteins may be poorer ligands for mouse SR-BI than mouse apo B containing lipoproteins. The effect of SR-BI on atherogenesis has recently been assessed in two groups of animals: mice containing an SR-BI transgene expressing at more than 10-fold endogenous levels in combination with LDLr knockout alleles (25.Arai T. Wang N. Bezouevski M. Welch C. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2366-2371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) and homozygous knockouts for both SR-BI and apo E (24.Trigatti B. Rayburn H. Vinals M. Braun A. Miettinen H. Penman M. Hertz J. Schrenzel M. Amigo L. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9322-9327Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). In these studies dramatic increases and decreases in SR-BI expression resulted in decreases and increases in atherogenesis, respectively. In both studies significant alterations in non-HDL cholesterol as well as HDL cholesterol levels prevented an assessment of the impact of SR-BI on atherogenesis via its ability to participate in the metabolism of HDL. The results from our study of low SR-BI/apo B mice sheds light on the antiatherogenic property of HDL as a key of the reverse cholesterol transport system. Moreover, studying animals with two different overexpression levels of SR-BI reveals the complexity of the protective mechanism of HDL against atherogenesis. A general observation in studies exploring the effect of transgenes on organismal phenotypes is that there invariably exists a direct relationship between the expression level of the transgene and the magnitude of the transgene effect. Thus, it is surprising that the high SR-BI/apo B transgenics fail to be protected from atherogenesis at a level greater or even equal to that of the low SR-BI/apo B transgenics. The molecular mechanisms contributing to the atherogenic protective properties of HDL have long been thought to be multifactorial (4.Parthasarathy S. Barnett J. Fong L.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 5.Navab M. Imes S.S. Hama S.Y. Hough G.P. Ross L.A. Bork R.W. Valente A.J. Berliner J.A. Drinkwater D.C. Laks H. Fogelman A.M. J.

Studies of the high SR-BI expressor based on the absence of α-migrating particles and their increased HDL cholesterol clearance (16.Ueda Y. Royer L. Gong E. Zhang J. Cooper P.N. Francone O. Rubin E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7165-7171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) suggest that these animals have increased reverse cholesterol transport compared with the low SR-BI transgenics, as well as the control animals. Whether the reverse cholesterol transport system, including peripheral cholesterol efflux, is activated in SR-BI overexpressing animals remains to be clarified. The dramatic effects of high SR-BI expression on HDL and more modest effects on non-HDL lipoproteins suggest that the atherogenesis findings in these animals may be mediated via these lipoprotein changes, thus countering any atheroprotective effect of the increase in reverse cholesterol transport. It is possible that the profound decrease in HDL concentration and/or HDL lipid composition in high expressor SR-BI transgenics may lead to a shortage of specific HDL particles with atherogenesis inhibiting properties. Alterations of LDL/IDL lipoprotein particles and their effect on atherogenesis in the high SR-BI/apo B transgenics may also contribute to the increased diet-induced atherogenic susceptibility of these animals. By examining a large number of inbred mice differing in SR-BI expression levels, we have derived a perspective on the effect of this molecule on atherogenesis that would have been missed had we examined a smaller number of mice expressing the SR-BI transgene at a single level. Although directly supporting the anti-atherogenic properties of HDL via participation in SR-BI-mediated reverse cholesterol transport, our results suggest that marked overexpression of SR-BI and its impact on HDL and possibly non-HDL lipoproteins may lessen the anti-atherogenic properties normally associated with elevated reverse cholesterol transport. Taken together, these findings suggest that, although activating the reverse cholesterol transport system through increased SR-BI expression is a potential way to reduce atherogenesis, the level of activity may need to be monitored to maximize anti-atherogenic benefits."

A number of clinically important chronic pathologic conditions, ranging from diabetes to hypertension and chronic inflammation, induce hypertrophy, an overall increase in the protein mass of the affected tissue that is due predominantly to cell enlargement and excess matrix deposition, without an increase in cell numbers. At the cellular level, hypertrophy is marked by an increase in overall protein synthesis, new gene expression (notably of immediate early genes), and, in some cases, reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and the expression of embryonic genes and extracellular matrix proteins. Among the agonists thought to have a role in hypertrophy are vasoactive peptides (e.g. endothelin-1 and angiotensin-II), mitogens, and inflammatory mediators (e.g.platelet-derived growth factor, interleukin-1, transforming growth factor-β, and gp130-coupled cytokines such as cardiotropin), diabetic hyperglycemia, and mechanical strain (1.Fine L.G.

Med. 1999; 341: 1276-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). While modest compensatory hypertrophy, such as that observed upon unilateral nephrectomy or in the heart in response to regular vigorous exercise, can occur without major clinical repercussions, excessive and/or eccentric hypertrophy arising as a consequence of sustained stress generally results in the physiologic insufficiency and ultimate failure of organ systems, as occurs in cardiac and diabetic renal failure, two major causes of morbidity and mortality in the developed world (1.Fine L.G.

Mechanical strain not only causes hypertrophy in the heart and kidney but has been implicated in precipitating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),1 as occurs during mechanical ventilation, especially if the ventilation pressure is not adequately controlled. Ameliorating the consequences of excess ventilation pressure is a significant challenge in dealing with pulmonary disease (3.Wyncoll D.L. Evand T.W. Lancet. 1999; 354: 497-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Accordingly, dissection of the molecular mechanisms that underlie mechanical and hypertension-induced cell stress responses is of general importance. Signal transduction pathways recruited in response to the persistent presence of pro-hypertrophic and other chronic stress agonists may participate in the initiation of pathologic hypertrophy and other deleterious effects. The stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs; also called c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases) and the p38s, two mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) subgroups that are activated strongly by environmental stresses, are among several signaling mechanisms that have been implicated in the progression to hypertrophy. In particular, both kinase groups can be activated by mechanical strain and vasoactive peptides (4.Choukroun G. Bonventre J.V. Kyriakis J.M. Rosenzweig A. Force T. J. Clin.

As with all MAPK signaling pathways, SAPKs and p38s are activated as part of three-tiered MAPK kinase kinase (MAP3K) → MAPK kinase (MKK) → MAPK “core” signaling modules (5.Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). These core modules, in turn, are subject to multiple forms of regulation, including activation by the trimeric G protein α-subunits Gα12, Gα13, Gα16, and Gαq; trimeric G protein βγ subunits (β1γ1); and Rac and Cdc42, members of the Rho subfamily of Ras type GTPases. Gα12 and Gα13, along with Gαo, are putative effectors for angiotensin-II, a potent pro-hypertrophic vasoactive peptide (9.Prasad M.V.V.S.V. Dermott J.M. Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L. Dhanasekaran N. J.

Support for the idea that the SAPKs and p38s are involved in hypertrophy comes from studies showing that expression in cardiomyocytes of constitutively active mutants of MKKs upstream of the SAPKs (SAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase-1, SEK1, and MKK7) or p38s (MKK-3 and -6) can induce hypertrophy in the absence of external stimulus (6.Wang Y.

Ross Jr., J Brown J.H. Han J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2161-2168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Moreover, expression of a dominant inhibitory, kinase-inactive form of SEK1 can completely block neonatal rat cardiomyocyte hypertrophy stimulated by endothelin, one of the most potent pro-hypertrophic agonists known (4.Choukroun G. Bonventre J.V. Kyriakis J.M. Rosenzweig A. Force T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Although the SAPK and p38 pathways may indeed be involved in the progression to hypertrophy, there is no clear picture of the molecular basis by which these stress pathways reprogram cells adapt to chronic stresses, including those that cause hypertrophy. The ability of the SAPKs and p38s to phosphorylate transcription factors and thereby trigger changes in gene expression is thought to underlie a substantial part of the mechanism by which these pathways affect cell function. Thus, the SAPKs and p38s are largely responsible for recruiting of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor in response to stress (5.Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 18.Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2310) Google Scholar). Key to dissecting the molecular mechanisms responsible for pathogenic stress responses such as hypertrophy is the identification of stress-induced genes that can sustain the prolonged activation of stress pathways and/or initiate the phenotypic changes characteristic of the responses to chronic stresses. gene 33 encodes a polypeptide of previously unknown function. It has been established for some time that rat gene 33, like c-fos and c-jun, is an immediate early gene that is rapidly induced by a heterologous array of mitogenic and stressful stimuli. The human isoform of gene 33,mig-6, behaves in a similar manner (19.Messina J.L. Draznin B. LeRoith D. Molecular Biology of Diabetes, Part II. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1994: 263-281Google Scholar, 20.Lee K.L. Makkinje A. Ch'ang L.Y. Kenney F.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 276: 106-113Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 21.Wick M. Burger C. Funk M. Muller R. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, despite the extensive analysis of stimuli that induce gene 33, a possible physiologic function for Gene 33 has heretofore not been identified. Given the reported induction of gene 33 by stress, we sought to determine if pro-hypertrophic and chronic stress agonists could induce gene 33 transcription. In addition, we wished to begin to identify potential biochemical functions for the Gene 33 polypeptide. Our results show that gene 33 mRNA levels increase dramatically soon after the onset of diabetes and continue to increase throughout the progression to diabetic nephropathy. By contrast, c-fos and c-juntranscripts are detected in the kidney early in diabetes but return to basal levels well before the onset of nephropathy. We also show that angiotensin-II and endothelin-1, potent pro-hypertrophic agonists in both the hypertensive heart and the diabetic kidney, can inducegene 33 and that mechanical strain, which is important to the pathology of cardiac and renal hypertrophy as well as ARDS (1.Fine L.G.

Lancet. 1999; 354: 497-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), induces gene 33 expression in a SAPK-dependent manner. This raises the possibility that expression of gene 33 could serve as a marker for chronic stress conditions such as incipient diabetic renal failure and, perhaps, the response to persistent environmental stresses such as those that precipitate ARDS. The structure of the Gene 33 protein is suggestive of a molecular adapter that couples to Rho family GTPases. Two forms of Gene 33 are generated as a consequence of differential RNA splicing, a long form and a short form missing aa 67–142. We demonstrate that the long Gene 33 polypeptide is cytosolic and can interact with Cdc42Hs in vivo and in a GTP-dependent manner in vitro. Moreover, transient expression of the long form of Gene 33 results in the substantial and selective activation of the SAPKs. Our findings are the first to identify potential functions for the Gene 33 protein and suggest that stress-induced expression of Gene 33 may serve to reprogram the cellular signaling machinery in response to chronic stress, resulting in sustained activation of the SAPKs and, consequently, SAPK-dependent gene expression. We used the following vectors: pEBG, a mammalian expression vector that expresses a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged polypeptide; pCMV5-FLAG, a mammalian expression vector that expresses an M2-FLAG-tagged polypeptide; pCMV5-Myc, a mammalian expression vector that expresses a Myc-tagged polypeptide; pMT3, a mammalian expression vector that expresses a hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged polypeptide; and pGEX-KG, a bacterial expression vector that expresses a GST-tagged polypeptide. pCMV5-FLAG- and pGEX-KG-Cdc42Hs, pMT3-SAPK-p46β1, pMT3-p38α, and pMT3-ERK1 have been described (22.Bagrodia S.

The recombinant adenoviral construct encoding SEK1(K129R) has been described (4.Choukroun G. Bonventre J.V. Kyriakis J.M. Rosenzweig A. Force T. J. Clin.

Guri Tzivion and Joseph Avruch (Massachusetts General Hospital). cDNA for ASK1 was kindly provided by Dr. Hidenori Ichijo (Tokyo Medical and Dental University). Gene 33 deletion constructs were generated by polymerase chain reaction and cloned, using standard methods (24.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), into various expression plasmids. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells and murine NIH3T3 fibroblasts were transfected by the calcium phosphate method. Rat renal mesangial cells were prepared and cultivated as described (25.Kreisberg J.I. Venkatchalam M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: C505-C511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells used were at passage 3. A549 cells, a human pulmonary alveolar epithelial tumor cell line, were infected with the SEK1(K129R) adenovirus at the multiplicities of infection indicated in the figures. Mesangial cells were treated with human endothelin-1 (100 nm, 60 min), human angiotensin-II (500 nm, 60 min), or calcium ionophore (A23187, 1 μm, 60 min). For mechanical strain experiments, A549 cells were cultured on elastic surfaces. A flat piston, which is pushed upward in a cyclic fashion against the bottom of the elastic surface, produces uniform biaxial strain (26.Schaffer J.L. Rizen M. L'Italien G.J. Benbrahim A. Megerman J. Gerstenfeld L.C. Gray M.L. J. Orthop. Res. 1994; 12: 709-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The rate of cyclic stretch was 12 cycles/min, and the degree of stretch was 5% for 2 h. Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (150–200 g) were made diabetic with an intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (50 mg/kg). Control animals were injected with water. Early diabetes was defined as the first detectable onset of glucosuria (≥250 mg/dl), which generally occurred within 15–20 h of injection. Diabetic nephropathy was defined as the onset of frank proteinuria and was apparent within 5 weeks of injection. Unilateral nephrectomy was performed as described (27.Pombo C.M. Bonventre J.V. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Kyriakis J.M. Force T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26546-26551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SAPK, p38, and ERK1 immune complex kinase assays were performed as described (23.Pombo C.M. Kehrl J.H. Sánchez I. Katz P. Avruch J. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Force T. Kyriakis J.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). 293 cells were transfected with 1 μg of pMT3-SAPK, p38, or ERK1 and either empty plasmid or pCMV5-FLAG-Gene 33. After cell lysis, kinases were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA. In vivoassociations between Gene 33 and various proteins were performed as described (28.Yuasa T. Ohno S. Kehrl J.H. Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22681-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In vitro association of Gene 33 and Cdc42Hs was performed as follows. GST-Cdc42Hs was expressed in E. coli, purified on GSH-agarose, eluted with free GSH, and stored as described (29.Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar). For reimmobilization and nucleotide charging, purified GST-Cdc42Hs was then normalized to 1 mg/ml in GSH-Sepharose binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20% (v/v) glycerol), and 500 μl of protein was added per 50 μl (settled) aliquot of glutathione-agarose. After 1 h of rotating at 4 °C, the slurry was washed twice in nucleotide depletion buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100). GST-Cdc42Hs beads were then loaded with GTPγS or GDPβS as follows. 50-μl beads were incubated with 1 ml of nucleotide loading buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100) containing 0.2 mm freshly added GTPγS or GDPβS. Twenty-four hours prior to the experiment, 293 cells were transfected with M2-FLAG-Gene 33 (1 μg of plasmid/10-cm dish) or, as a positive control, M2-FLAG-p21-activated kinase-1 (PAK1; 10 μg of plasmid/10-cm dish). Twenty-four hours later, extracts were prepared from transfected cells by scraping into extraction buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm EGTA, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μm leupeptin, 10 milliunits/ml aprotinin, 400 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm Na3VO4). Extracts were normalized to 2 mg/ml protein and supplemented with 10 mm MgCl2 plus either GTPγS or GDPβS at a final concentration of 0.2 mm. Charged Cdc42Hs was pelleted by centrifugation, the supernatant was removed, and 1 ml of the cognate (GTPγS- or GDPβS-supplemented) cell extract was added. After 2 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed with the relevant (GTPγS- or GDPβS-supplemented) nucleotide loading buffer. Polypeptides bound to the GST-Cdc42Hs were detected by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-FLAG. Northern blotting was performed as described (24.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence analysis of Gene 33 localization was performed as described (30.Molnár Á. Theodoras A.M. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (13235): 13299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Transcription of gene 33 is known to occur in response to insulin, growth factors, and some stresses (19.Messina J.L. Draznin B. LeRoith D. Molecular Biology of Diabetes, Part II. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1994: 263-281Google Scholar). We wished to confirm and extend the hypothesis that gene 33 was induced in response to environmental stress. Cultures of rat glomerular mesangial cells were subjected to hypertonic shock (500 mmsorbitol) for 20 min, at which time the medium was returned to iso-osmotic conditions. Total cellular RNA was prepared immediately after the 20-min stimulus and for various times up to 4 h after the cessation of stimulus and used for Northern analysis of gene 33 expression. As is apparent in Fig.1, gene 33 expression is detectable first at 40 min after sorbitol removal, achieving a maximum at 1 h and declining slightly thereafter; however, expression is still detectable at 4 h. By contrast, SAPK is activated within the first 20 min of osmotic shock and remains active up to 2 h after the return to iso-osmotic conditions (data not shown). c-junexpression is similarly transient, appearing before gene 33(20 min), peaking at 40 min, and declining to base line by 2 h. Thus, gene 33 expression follows activation of the SAPKs and c-jun induction and remains elevated long after c-jun expression returns to control levels. The induction ofgene 33 by hypertonicity suggested that Gene 33 might serve as a general stress-responsive element and prompted us to ask if the transcriptional induction of gene 33 might occur in response to physiologically significant, chronic, pathologic stresses. Diabetes is the single largest cause of end stage renal failure in the United States and Europe, and nephropathy accounts for a substantial fraction of the mortality associated with diabetes. Diabetic nephropathy is a chronic stress response, characterized by glomerular mesangial cell hypertrophy. Hypertension in the renal microvasculature and elevated plasma glucose are believed to contribute to this hypertrophy (1.Fine L.G. Norman J.T. Kujubu D.A. Knecht A. Seldin D.W. Geibisch G. The Kidney: Physiology and Pathophysiology. Raven Press, New York1992: 3113-3134Google Scholar). In order to ascertain the effect of diabetes on gene 33expression in the kidney, we employed a well established technique, the administration of streptozotocin, a genotoxin that targets selectively the β cells of the pancreas, to render rats diabetic. At various times, kidneys were removed, and the mRNA was extracted and subjected to Northern analysis using gene 33, c-jun, and c-fos cDNAs as probes. Within 24 h of streptozotocin administration, diabetes (glucosuria and elevated blood glucose) was evident in the injected animals. At this time, there was a significant increase in gene 33mRNA, consistent with the characterization (19.Messina J.L. Draznin B. LeRoith D. Molecular Biology of Diabetes, Part II. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1994: 263-281Google Scholar, 20.Lee K.L. Makkinje A. Ch'ang L.Y. Kenney F.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 276: 106-113Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 21.Wick M. Burger C. Funk M. Muller R. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) of gene 33 as an immediate early gene. Similarly, expression of two other immediate early genes, c-jun and c-fos, was stimulated at this early time point (Fig.2 A). Expression of c-fos continued to increase and was maximal by 41 h after the onset of diabetes, declining thereafter; by contrast, c-jun expression remained constant for up to 46 h after the onset of diabetes. Unilateral nephrectomy is associated with immediate early gene expression and correlates with a transient compensatory hypertrophy in the remaining kidney (1.Fine L.G. Norman J.T. Kujubu D.A. Knecht A. Seldin D.W. Geibisch G. The Kidney: Physiology and Pathophysiology. Raven Press, New York1992: 3113-3134Google Scholar). Unilateral nephrectomy, in nondiabetic animals, produced a striking induction of gene 33, within 17 h, in the remaining kidney. In parallel, c-junexpression in the remaining kidney was also strongly stimulated. c-fos induction was observed but was less robust than that incurred by diabetes. gene 33 and c-jun, but not c-fos, expression was greater in unilaterally nephrectomized, diabetic animals than in animals subjected to either treatment alone (Fig. 2 A). We allowed some of the streptozotocin-injected animals to progress, over 5 weeks, to frank diabetic nephropathy, a point at which they displayed overt proteinuria and, as determined by gross examination of the kidneys, renal hypertrophy. We performed Northern analysis of mRNA from control and diabetic rat kidneys at 5 weeks post-streptozotocin administration; again, gene 33, c-jun, and c-fos cDNAs were used as probes. Northern blots of total RNA from rat kidneys at 23 h and 5 weeks post-streptozotocin injection revealed a continuous increase ingene 33 mRNA levels (Fig. 2 B). By contrast, c-jun and c-fos mRNAs, which were markedly induced at 23 h, had returned to basal levels by 5 weeks (Fig. 2,A and B). Thus, the onset of diabetic nephropathy correlates closely with a progressively increasing induction ofgene 33, an expression pattern that differs significantly from the comparatively transient expression of c-jun and c-fos, two other immediate early genes, the expression of which has been associated with diabetic nephropathy (1.Fine L.G. Norman J.T. Kujubu D.A. Knecht A. Seldin D.W. Geibisch G. The Kidney: Physiology and Pathophysiology. Raven Press, New York1992: 3113-3134Google Scholar, 2.Hunter J.J. Chien K.R. N. Engl. J.

This persistent expression, tracking with the pathogenesis of a chronic disease, suggests that gene 33 may be a good marker for the cellular response to persistent stress. Although a role for Gene 33 in the pathogenesis of diabetes has yet to be established, the expression pattern of gene 33 corresponds closely with that of the known increase in extracellular matrix protein expression that is characteristic of diabetic nephropathy (1.Fine L.G. Norman J.T. Kujubu D.A. Knecht A. Seldin D.W. Geibisch G. The Kidney: Physiology and Pathophysiology. Raven Press, New York1992: 3113-3134Google Scholar), and this persistent expression of gene 33 is consistent with the hypothesis thatgene 33 expression is a marker for diabetic nephropathy. By contrast, c-fos and c-jun expression, although possibly necessary for triggering renal hypertrophy, appear not to correlate with the progression of diabetic renal disease and may be more general markers for inducible immediate early gene expression. The renal disease characteristic of diabetes is particularly evident in glomerular mesangial cells. In the diabetic kidney, elevated plasma glucose stimulates the secretion, by glomerular mesangial cells, of excess extracellular matrix and the production of transforming grow"

Here we report that signals provided by extracellular matrix proteins (ECM) augment the PE-induced hypertrophic response of cardiomyocytes and provide evidence that ECM-dependent signaling is mediated in part by the protein tyrosine kinase, focaladhesion kinase (FAK). Addition of PE to cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes stimulated sarcomeric organization, increased cell size, and induced atrial natriuretic factor in cardiomyocytes plated on the ECM protein laminin or fibronectin. In contrast, cardiomyocytes plated on the non-adhesive substrate gelatin exhibited a reduced capacity to undergo these PE-stimulated hypertrophic changes. In cardiomyocytes cultured on ECM, PE stimulated a rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins including FAK, paxillin, and p130 Crk-associated substrate and subsequent formation of peripheral focal complexes. Inhibition of the PE-induced hypertrophic response by genistein and herbimycin-A indicated a requirement for protein tyrosine kinases in PE signaling. To determine whether activation of FAK is required for PE-induced hypertrophy, a dominant-interfering mutant form of FAK, termed FRNK (FAK-relatednon-kinase), was ectopically expressed in cardiomyocytes using a replication-defective adenovirus expression system. FRNK expression attenuated PE-stimulated hypertrophy as assessed by cell size, sarcomeric organization, and induction of atrial natriuretic factor.

However, in the fully developed adult heart, pressure or volume overload, myocardial infarction, or hormonal imbalance can lead to chronic pathological hypertrophy characterized by induction of immediate early genes, re-activation of an embryonic gene program, and reorganization of myocyte cytoskeletal architecture (1.Komuro I. Yazaki Y. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 55-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The ability of integrins, extracellular matrix receptors, to regulate cytoskeletal architecture has been well characterized, and integrin signaling has clearly been implicated in hormone and growth factor-induced alterations in gene transcription in variety of cell types (2.Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). Integrins are a family of heterodimeric transmembrane receptors (composed of α and β subunits) containing extracellular ligand binding domains that show binding specificity for extracellular matrix (ECM)1 components and a short cytoplasmic domain that serves to couple integrins with the actin cytoskeleton (3.Hynes R.O.

Several studies have shown that cardiac hypertrophy is accompanied by alterations in ECM components and cardiac integrin expression (4.Graf K. Do Y.S. Ashizawa N. Meehan W.P. Giachelli C.M.

Specifically, enhanced expression of collagen III, fibronectin, osteopontin, and β1, α3, and α5 integrin subunits correlates with advancement of hypertrophy (4.Graf K. Do Y.S. Ashizawa N. Meehan W.P.

A direct role for integrins in the development of hypertrophy has been demonstrated by transgenic studies in which cardiac specific expression of activated α5 integrin leads to profound ventricular hypertrophy (7.McDonald, J. A., and Valencik, M. (1998) Abstracts of the X7 Keystone Symposium (Abstr. 220)Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations support a model whereby alterations in signaling pathways responsive to ECM may influence the progression of cardiac hypertrophy. Integrin signaling in many cell types involves activation offocal adhesion kinase (FAK), a cytoplasmic non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase. Clustering of integrins leads to the recruitment of FAK to the newly formed focal adhesion and results in autophosphorylation and concomitant activation of FAK. Tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr-397 (proximal to the kinase domain) creates a binding site for the SH2 domain of another non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Src, resulting in formation of a bipartite complex of two tyrosine kinases (8.Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). The formation of the FAK·Src complex results in the activation of Src and the subsequent activation of downstream signals leading to the regulation of cellular processes such as growth, migration, and apoptosis (2.Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar, 3.Hynes R.O.

Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 379-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of FAK contains binding sites for a number of signaling molecules including phosphoinositide 3-kinase, p130Crk associated substrate (CAS), GRB2, paxillin, and the GTPase regulatorassociated with FAK (Graf; Ref. 10.Parsons J.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The recruitment and activation of these molecules are thought to be important for the subsequent activation of other downstream signaling pathways. For example, association of FAK with CAS is required for integrin-mediated activation of ERK2 (11.Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13189-13195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). In some cells, the C-terminal domain of FAK is expressed as a separate protein termed FRNK (FAK-relatednon-kinase), whose overexpression attenuates integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin (12.Richardson A. Malik R.K. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6906-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 13.Richardson A. Parsons T. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) and results in the inhibition of the rate of cell spreading and cell migration (12.Richardson A. Malik R.K. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6906-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 13.Richardson A. Parsons T. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). These data indicate that FRNK can act as a biological inhibitor of FAK signaling and highlight the importance of FAK in ECM-mediated signaling events. In addition to providing specific signaling from ECM, recent evidence suggests that integrin engagement is required to mediate efficient growth factor and hormonal-mediated signaling. When fibroblasts are held in suspension, EGF-, platelet-derived growth factor-, and lysophosphatidic acid-stimulated ERK2 activity is markedly reduced compared with cells plated on fibronectin (14.Renshaw M.W. Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5592-5599Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 15.Lin T.H. Chen Q. Howe A. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8849-8852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Importantly, the inhibition observed in suspended cells can be rescued by overexpression of activated FAK (16.Renshaw M.W. Price L.S. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). These data indicate that growth factors (or hormones) synergize with cell adhesion signals to stimulate cell growth and survival. We report herein that PE-induced hypertrophy in isolated neonatal cardiomyocytes requires signaling through FAK. Plating cells on the integrin-dependent ECM proteins laminin or fibronectin supports the PE-induced hypertrophic response of the cultured cardiomyocytes, whereas plating cells on the integrin-independent substrate gelatin fails to sustain cellular hypertrophy. Addition of PE stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins including FAK, paxillin, and CAS and alters the subcellular localization of paxillin in cardiomyocytes plated on ECM. In addition, we show that ectopic expression of FRNK, a dominant-interfering mutant for FAK, attenuates PE-induced hypertrophy. These data support a role for integrin-mediated, FAK-dependent signaling for induction of cardiac hypertrophy.

An anti-FAK tyrosine 397-specific antibody was purchased fromBIOSOURCE International, and an anti-human FAK antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.. The ERK1/2 antibodies used include a phosphorylation-specific antibody purchased from Calbiochem, and polyclonal (TR10) and monoclonal (1B3B9) antibodies were generously provided by Dr. Michael Weber (University of Virginia). CAS was detected using a mixture of two polyclonal antibodies generated against the C-terminal domain of CAS (CAS-F and CAS-P; provided by Dr. Amy Bouton, University of Virginia, see Ref. 17.Bouton A.H. Burnham M.R. Hybridoma. 1997; 16: 403-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The cDNA constructs encoding the N-terminal Myc- and GFP-tagged variants of FRNK were generated by cloning chicken FRNK into theBamHI/NotI or BglII/EcoRI sites of the mammalian expression vectors pCMV-Neo-BamHI or pEGFP-C1, respectively. For adenovirus production, GFP and GFP-tagged FRNK were generated by PCR from pEGFP-C1 and pEGFP-C1-FRNK, respectively, using primers that added 5′ and 3′ BamHI restriction sites. The resultant PCR products were digested withBamHI and ligated with BamHI-digested pAd-lox (an adenoviral shuttle vector generously provided by Stephen Hardy, Somatix Therapy Corp., Alameda, CA). Correct orientations of all reading frames were confirmed by sequencing and Western blot analysis of expressed proteins. The GFPAd-lox and GFP-FRNKAd-lox constructs were subsequently co-transfected with replication-defective ψ5 virus into HEK293 cells that produce stable overexpression of the Cre-recombinase. After recombination, plaque-purified virus (1 × 1010plaque-forming units/ml) was generated and purified by cesium-chloride gradients as described elsewhere (18.Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ventricular cardiomyocytes were isolated from neonatal rats (1–3 days old) by trypsin and collagenase digestion and purified as described previously (19.Thorburn J. McMahon M. Thorburn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30580-30586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were resuspended in DMEM:Media 199 (4:1) containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin and plated on tissue culture plastic for two consecutive 1-h periods to remove non-cardiomyocyte cells. For the biochemical experiments, cardiomyocytes were treated with 100 μm5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine as described previously to obtain cultures with >95% myocytes (20.Simpson P.C. McGrath A. Savion S. Circ. Res. 1982; 51: 787-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The cardiomyocytes were then plated on tissue culture dishes or chamber slides pre-coated with ECM or gelatin as required. Cardiomyocytes were plated at low density (2 × 104 cells/ml) for immunofluorescent studies and at high density (1 × 106 cells/ml) for biochemical studies. After 18–24 h the cells were rinsed in serum-free DMEM:Media 199 (4:1) and plated in serum-free DMEM:Media 199 (4:1) containing 1% penicillin-streptomycin. After a 24-h incubation period, cells were treated with vehicle or PE for the indicated times. For adenoviral infection, cells were infected in serum-free media with either GFP or GFP-FRNK (4 m.o.i.) for 12 h prior to treatment with PE. In some experiments cardiomyocytes were transfected with a Myc-FRNK expression vector using the FuGene transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Typically 3 μg of DNA/20-mm chamber slide was combined with 6 μl of FuGene and incubated with the cells in serum-free DMEM:Media 199 (4:1) for 24 h prior to treatment with vehicle or PE. For immunofluorescent staining, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, calcium- and magnesium-free) and fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times in PBS and permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100 in PBS for 3 min at room temperature. Slides were then washed three times in PBS to remove the detergent and incubated with either the primary anti-Myc monoclonal antibody, 9E10 (1 μg/ml), or the polyclonal anti-ANF Ab (1:500, Peninsula Laboratories) for 1 h. Cells were washed three times in PBS and incubated with Cascade Blue-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ab (2 μg/ml) and/or Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit Ab (2 μg/ml) for 1 h. In some experiments, Texas Red- or FITC-conjugated phalloidin (1:1000; Molecular Probes) was used to visualize filamentous actin. Cardiomyocytes were lysed by homogenization in a modified RIPA buffer (50 mmHepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.05% sodium deoxycholate, pH 7.2) containing 1 mm Na3VO4, 40 mm NaF, 10 mm Na2 pyrophosphate. Paxillin or CAS or ERK1/2 was immunoprecipitated by incubation of 1–2 mg of cell extract with 5 μg of the appropriate antibody for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by a 1-h incubation with protein A-Sepharose-conjugated beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For paxillin immunoprecipitation, the beads were pre-coupled to rabbit anti-mouse antibody (10 μg/ml, Jackson Laboratories). The immune complexes were collected by centrifugation, and the beads were washed three times with RIPA buffer and once with Tris-buffered saline (0.2 m NaCl and 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), boiled in sample buffer, and the proteins resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and Western blots were performed using the appropriate primary antibody at a 1:1000 dilution followed by incubation with either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse Ab or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a 1:1000 dilution. Blots were visualized after incubation with chemiluminescence reagents (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). ERK was immunoprecipitated by incubation of cardiomyocyte extracts (100 μg) from GFP or GFP-FRNK-infected cells with a polyclonal antibody specific for ERK1 and ERK2 (TR10) as described above. The immune complexes were resuspended in MAP kinase reaction buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 50 μmunlabeled ATP) containing myelin basic protein (2 μg) and [γ-32P]ATP (1 μCi, 6,000 Ci/mmol) and incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. The reaction mixtures were boiled in SDS sample buffer, resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. Cardiomyocytes were isolated as described previously and plated at a density of 2.5 × 105cells/well in a 24-well plate. Cells were treated with either GFP virus or GFP-FRNK virus (4 m.o.i.) or vehicle control in serum-free media (300 μl/well). 12 h after infection, cells were treated with either vehicle alone or 100 μm PE for 24 h. The conditioned media were collected and centrifuged to pellet any possible debris. The concentration of ANF in the conditioned media was then determined using a peptide enzyme immunoassay (Peninsula Laboratories, San Carlos, CA). Many features of pathological hypertrophy can be reproduced in isolated neonatal cardiomyocytes by treatment with a variety of agents including phenylephrine (PE), angiotensin II, and endothelin-1 (21.Sadoshima J. Izumo S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 551-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). These cells respond to an increase in cell size, sarcomeric organization, increased expression of immediate early genes (c-fos, c-jun, Egr-1, jun-B, andNur-7), and re-expression of embryonic genes (atrial natriuretic factor (ANF); skeletal α-actin, smooth muscle α-actin, and β-myosin heavy chain; see Ref. 22.Chien K.R. Zhu H. Knowlton K.U. Miller-Hance W. van-Bilsen M. O'Brien T.X. Evans S.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 77-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). By using this experimental paradigm, we examined to what extent integrin-mediated signaling is involved in the hypertrophic response in vitro. Initially, we examined the ability of PE to stimulate hypertrophy in neonatal cardiomyocytes plated on integrin-dependent (e.g. laminin, fibronectin, and collagen type I) or integrin-independent (e.g. gelatin) substrates. PE treatment of cardiomyocytes plated on laminin (Fig.1 A, middle panels) stimulated sarcomeric organization and increased cell size and ANF production compared with the control vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 1 A, top panels). In contrast, cardiomyocytes plated on gelatin exhibited a reduced capacity to undergo these PE-stimulated hypertrophic changes (Fig. 1 A, bottom panels). To quantitate the extent of hypertrophy on different matrices, a total of 150–200 cells in each treatment group (representing cells from three separate experiments) were scored for sarcomeric organization and ANF induction using fluorescent microscopy (Fig. 1 B). Sarcomeric reorganization was observed in approximately 90% of PE-treated cells plated on laminin versus 35% of the cells plated on gelatin. Cells not treated with PE showed little actin reorganization whether plated on laminin or gelatin (Fig. 1 B, left panel). ANF production was observed in approximately 70% of PE-treated cells plated on laminin compared with 15% of the cells plated on gelatin. Fibronectin supported PE-stimulated sarcomeric reorganization and ANF production to a similar extent as laminin, whereas type I collagen was far less efficient in supporting these hypertrophic responses (Fig. 1 B). Thus, these initial experiments provide support for the role of ECM-directed integrin signaling in PE-induced hypertrophy. Since maximal PE-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy required ECM, we examined whether components of the integrin-signaling cascade were altered after PE stimulation. First we examined whether PE treatment altered the subcellular localization of focal adhesion proteins during the hypertrophic response. Fig. 2 shows immunostaining of actin stress fibers and the focal adhesion protein paxillin during the progression of PE-induced hypertrophy in cells plated on laminin. Typically, cellular changes indicative of hypertrophy including increases in cell size and sarcomeric organization are complete within 24–48 h after PE treatment in cultured neonatal cells. As shown in Fig. 2 A, myofibrillar reorganization was enhanced relative to controls as early as 1 h after PE treatment, and the organization was virtually complete by 4 h. The recruitment of the focal adhesion protein paxillin to complexes at the periphery of cells appeared to be concomitant with the enhanced sarcomeric reorganization (Fig. 2 B). Paxillin staining was generally dispersed in untreated cells, but after 1 h of PE treatment, staining appeared more focal in nature, localized to the periphery of cells. At 4 h of PE treatment paxillin appeared in distinct complexes at the termini of actin fibers. A similar staining pattern was observed with antibodies directed against another prominent focal adhesion protein, vinculin (data not shown). The PE-stimulated paxillin complexes observed in cardiomyocytes are reminiscent (albeit smaller than) of classical focal adhesions observed following plating of fibroblasts or epithelial cells on ECM proteins and suggest that PE treatment is giving rise to a rearrangement of the ECM adhesion structures. Tyrosine phosphorylation is a critical covalent modification driving protein-protein interactions required for cytoskeletal reorganization and focal adhesion assembly (10.Parsons J.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B, PE treatment of cultured cardiomyocytes induced the formation of phosphotyrosine-rich focal adhesion-like complexes at the periphery of cells similar to that observed for paxillin immunostaining. To determine the kinetics and extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion-associated proteins, FAK and CAS were immunoprecipitated from PE-treated cells and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) antibodies. As shown in Fig.3, cells plated on fibronectin, but not gelatin, exhibited a PE-stimulated, time-dependent increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK (Fig. 3 A). Typically, an increase in FAK Tyr(P) is observed within 5–10 min after treatment with PE and is sustained for at least 30 min. A similar PE-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the FAK-binding partners, CAS and paxillin, were also observed when cells were plated on fibronectin (Fig. 3,B and C) but not gelatin (data not shown). Importantly, as shown in Fig. 3 D, PE-induced activation of the downstream signaling molecule ERK2 is also dependent on ECM interactions. Although variability is observed in the onset of ERK phosphorylation (ranging from 5 to 10 min) a consistent correlation is observed between the time course for PE-induced FAK and ERK phosphorylation within each experiment. These observations mirror data from numerous studies showing enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins after integrin ligation induced by plating cells on ECM proteins and are consistent with integrin signaling being a component of PE-induced hypertrophy. Previous studies have shown that tyrosine phosphorylation is central to integrin-stimulated focal adhesion formation and downstream signaling. Therefore, we examined the requirement for tyrosine phosphorylation in the induction of PE-induced hypertrophy. Fig.4 shows that the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein (100 μg/ml) or herbimycin A (875 nm) markedly inhibited PE-induced myofibrillar organization and expression of endogenous ANF in cells plated on ECM. However, these inhibitors did not alter viability or morphology of vehicle-treated cardiomyocytes (data not shown). These studies corroborate a previous report indicating that induction of an ANF-reporter construct was attenuated by genistein (23.Fuller S.J. Gillespie-Brown J. Sugden P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18146-18152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The requirement for tyrosine phosphorylation and the ability of PE to stimulate FAK tyrosine phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes plated on ECM suggested the possibility that FAK is a downstream mediator of PE-stimulated integrin signaling in the hypertrophy response. To determine whether the integrin signaling required for PE-stimulated hypertrophy is dependent on FAK activity, we sought to express a dominant-negative construct corresponding to the C-terminal domain of FAK (termed FRNK) in cardiomyocytes, and we examined the ability of these cells to undergo PE-mediated hypertrophy. It has been previously shown that FRNK functions to attenuate integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin as well as block integrin-mediated cell spreading and cell migration (12.Richardson A. Malik R.K. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6906-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 13.Richardson A. Parsons T. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Since this dominant-negative strategy required a high percentage of FRNK-expressing cells in order to observe populational changes in PE-induced signaling, we generated replication-defective adenovirus encoding GFP-tagged FRNK (GFRNK) or GFP alone as a control. GFP and GFRNK were efficiently expressed in 90–100% of the cardiomyocyte population as determined by immunofluorescence (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 5 A, both GFP and GFRNK proteins are expressed in cardiomyocytes within 12 h after adenoviral infection. Importantly, infection of cardiomyocytes with GFP-FRNK but not GFP alone attenuates PE-stimulated FAK activation as assessed by immunoblotting with antibodies specific for FAK Tyr(P) at position 397 (Fig. 5 B). These data indicate that infection of cardiomyocytes with GFRNK is an effective means of inhibiting FAK signaling in these cells. To determine whether FAK activity was required for PE-stimulated hypertrophy, cardiomyocytes plated on fibronectin were infected with GFP or GFRNK virus prior to PE stimulation. Fig.6 shows that PE stimulates actin rearrangement and ANF production in GFP-infected cardiomyocytes, indicating that adenovirus alone does not interfere with PE-stimulated hypertrophy and is not cytotoxic to these cells. However, infection of cardiomyocytes with GFRNK resulted in a near-complete inhibition of PE-stimulated hypertrophy as assessed by cell size, sarcomeric reorganization, and endogenous ANF staining (Fig. 6). Lack of PE-stimulated ANF production in GFRNK-infected cells compared with those infected with GFP or uninfected control cells was confirmed by quantitating the amount of ANF secretion in these cells using a peptide enzyme immunoassay. PE stimulated a 3.2- ± 0.9-fold increase in ANF secretion over vehicle-treated uninfected control cells (n = 5; p < 0.05) and a 2.6- ± 0.4-fold increase in GFP-infected cells (n = 5,p < 0.05). However, no increase (0.94 ± 0.1) in ANF secretion was observed following PE treatment of GFRNK-infected cells (n = 5; p > 0.05). Basal ANF secretion was not significantly altered by infection with either GFP or GFRNK viruses (n = 5, p > 0.05). A similar inhibition of PE-stimulated hypertrophy was observed when cells were transfected (rather than infected) with a Myc-tagged FRNK cDNA construct and scored visually for organized actin structures or ANF production (data not shown). Taken together these data indicate that activation of FAK is critical for maximal PE-stimulated hypertrophy in isolated cardiomyocytes. It is possible that the requirement for functional integrin signaling through FAK in PE-stimulated hypertrophy may be due to the ability of FAK to activate cooperatively an essential PE-stimulated pathway. One candidate PE-stimulated pathway involves signaling from Ras to ERK. Activation of ERK2 has been implicated in the regulation of hypertrophic gene expression, and as shown above, PE-stimulated ERK2 activity is dependent on ECM. As shown in Fig.7, PE st"

Among the antiapoptotic genes, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 2 (c-IAP2/HIAP-1/MIHC) is originally identified as a molecule recruited to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor complex, and its expression is preferentially up-regulated by TNF and other stimuli activating NF-κB.

A. 1997; 94: 10057-10062Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Among these, c-IAP2 (cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 2), also known as HIAP-1 (11.Liston P. Roy N. Tamai K. Lefebvre C. Baird S. Cherton-Horvat G. Farahani R. McLean M. Ikeda J.E. MacKenzie A. Korneluk R.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar) and MIHC (12.Uren A.G. Pakusch M. Hawkins C.J. Puls K.L. Vaux D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4974-4978Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), was initially identified as a molecule that is recruited to the TNF receptor via its association with the TNF receptor-associated factors, TRAF1 and TRAF2 (13.Rothe M. Pan M.G. Henzel W.J. Ayres T.M. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 83: 1243-1252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). TRAF molecules are proposed to function as adapter proteins conveying the TNF receptor-mediated signals (14.Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that c-IAP2 can inhibit apoptosis by modulating the TNF-induced NF-κB activity (10.Chu Z.L. McKinsey T.A. Liu L. Gentry J.J. Malim M.H. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10057-10062Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). It was observed that, in Jurkat T cells, TNF treatment led to NF-κB-dependent induction ofc-IAP2 gene, and conversely, c-IAP2 was able to activate NF-κB via an IκBα-targeting mechanism; this consequently suppressed TNF-induced apoptosis. Later studies showed that c-IAP2 exhibits its antiapoptotic function by directly binding and inhibiting downstream cell death protease caspases-3, -7, and -9, but not upstream protease caspase-8, which is implicated in TNF-induced cell death signaling (15.Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar, 16.Deveraux Q.L. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Van Arsdale T. Zhou Q. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2215-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). However, a recent study suggests that c-IAP2 requires TRAF1, TRAF2, and c-IAP1 activities for the full suppression of TNF-induced cell death at the level of caspase-8, all of which are transcriptionally activated by NF-κB (17.Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar). In cells in which NF-κB activation was prevented with dominant negative IκBα, ectopic expression of c-IAP-1, c-IAP2, TRAF1 and TRAF2 together fully suppressed TNF-induced apoptosis and caspase-8 activation, substituting for the antiapoptotic effect of NF-κB. In the same cells, however, either c-IAP1 or c-IAP2 alone was sufficient to suppress etoposide-induced cell death by direct inhibition of caspase-3 (17.Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar). These results support the hypothesis that NF-κB activates a group of gene products that function cooperatively to suppress TNF-induced apoptosis by inhibiting the activation of upstream death protease caspase-8. In contrast to the mode of action of c-IAP2, little is known about how c-IAP2 is regulated, except that it is under the control of NF-κB. Transcription of c-IAP2 gene was found to be also up-regulated by treating endothelial cells with interleukin 1 (IL-1) or lipopolysaccharide (18.Stehlik C. de Martin R. Kumabashiri I. Schmid J.A. Binder B.R. Lipp J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) and by CD40 stimulation on B lymphocytes (19.Craxton A. Shu G. Graves J.D. Saklatvala J. Krebs E.G. Clark E.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3225-3236PubMed Google Scholar), which are stimuli that lead to NF-κB activation. It has been demonstrated that the transcriptional activation of other antiapoptotic genes such as A20, Bcl-X, and Bfl/A1 by NF-κB is through one or two NF-κB binding sites resided in their promoter regions (5.Tamatani M. Che Y.H. Matsuzaki H. Ogawa S. Okado H. Miyake S. Mizuno T. Tohyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8531-8538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 20.Chen F. Demers L.M.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9136-9141Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). It remains to be elucidated, however, whether a similar transcription-regulating mechanism is involved inc-IAP2 gene expression. Although the partial 5′-flanking region surrounding the putative transcription start site ofc-IAP2 was reported (22.Young S.S. Liston P. Xuan J.Y. McRoberts C. Lefebvre C.A. Korneluk R.G. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the sequence information was not enough to gain an understanding of the regulation of c-IAP2gene expression. In the present study, we sequenced the 5′-flanking region (3.5 kilobases (kb)) of the c-IAP2 gene. Deletion analysis revealed that the region conferring inducibility by TNF or IL-1 is localized downstream from the previously proposed transcription start site and contains three putative consensus NF-κB binding sites and other potential transcription factor binding elements. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and site-directed mutagenesis analysis of the NF-κB binding sites demonstrated that two NF-κB elements are required for promoter activity and that they function cooperatively in mediating TNF-induced c-IAP2promoter activation. Moreover, we showed that the c-IAP2promoter activity is strongly enhanced in cells transfected with expression plasmids for CD40 and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) oncoprotein latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1). Human embryonic kidney 293 cells and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and gentamicin (50 μg/ml). Recombinant human TNF was kindly supplied by Dr. H. H. Chung of LG Biotech Research Institute, Daejeon, Korea. Recombinant IL-1β was purchased from Genzyme. Poly(dI·dC) was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma if not otherwise stated. Expression plasmid for LMP1 was obtained from Dr. W. G. Lee (Myung-Ji University, Yongin, Korea). A genomic library from HeLa cells was screened with the full length human c-IAP2 cDNA. A total of 8 × 105 plaques were screened, and nine positives were isolated and further characterized by restriction mapping and Southern blot analysis. The SpeI restriction fragment (∼8.0 kb) was selected and cloned into pBluescript KS(+) (Stratagene) as a potential genomic fragment harboring promoter region extending from the 5′-untranslated region of the c-IAP2gene. Further analysis revealed that a unique SphI site within the 8.0-kb SpeI fragment represents the restriction site embedded closest to the 5′-end of the longest cDNA sequence filed (GenBankTM accession number AF070674). The 3.5-kb fragment upstream of the SphI was isolated after restriction with the pBluescript multicloning site-derived XbaI andSphI and cloned to the respective sites of pSP73 (Promega), resulting in pSP73-S(3.5k)Sh. Nucleotide sequences of the insert on both strands were determined by the use of automatic DNA sequencer. A series of plasmids containing various sizes of the 5′-flanking region of c-IAP2 promoter were constructed by inserting DNA fragments into the basic luciferase reporter plasmid, pGL2 (Promega). The 3.5-kbSpeI-HindIII fragment from pSP73-S(3.5k)Sh was cloned into the NheI and HindIII sites of pGL2, generating pGL(−3.5kLUC). The 2.1-kb SpeI-BamHI and 1.4-kb BamHI-HindIII fragments were inserted, respectively, into the NheI/BglII andBglII/HindIII-digested pGL2, resulting in pGL(−3.5kΔLUC) and pGL(−1.4kLUC). For a fine directional deletion cloning within the 1.4-kb BamHI-HindIII fragment, DNA fragments were amplified using polymerase chain reaction with various forward primers and a common reverse primer complementary to the T7 promoter sequence that is embedded downstream of the multicloning sites of pSP73. Following are the synthetic forward primers incorporating a XhoI site at their 5′-end: 5′-ccgctcgagTTACTTTCTTGATCAG-3′ (−527 to −512), 5′-ccgctcgaGACTTCTGCAGCTATAG-3′ (−447 to −431), 5′-ccgctcgAGATATGCCACGGTTAAG-3′ (−247 to −230), ccgctcGAGTGGGTTTGCCAGGC-3′ (−200 to −184), 5′-ccgctcgAGAGGAAGTGTGTGTGG-3′ (−174 to −158), and 5′-ccgctcGAGGAGTGCGGAACGC-3′ (−93 to −78). Polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA fragments were gel-purified and digested withXhoI and HindIII and inserted into the respective sites of pGL2. Transfection was carried out by the CaPO4-DNA precipitation method usingN,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (BES) buffer as described elsewhere. 2 μg of each reporter luciferase constructs was transfected along with 0.5 μg of pCDM8-β-galactosidase (23.Kim C.H. Song Y.H. Park K. Oh Y. Lee T.H. J. Inflamm. 1995; 45: 312-322PubMed Google Scholar) when the cells (seeded onto 6-well plates) reached 50–70% confluence. At 16 h post-transfection, TNF or IL-1 was added for 4 h as indicated. Transfectants were lysed in 0.15 ml of lysis buffer (Promega) and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 5 min to remove cell debris. The resulting clear lysates were assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity, and the values of the luciferase assay were normalized with respect to the values of the β-galactosidase assay for relative comparison of each transfection. 293 and HeLa cells were treated with TNF at the indicated times. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Dignam et al. (24.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar), quantitated by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and stored at −70 °C. The oligonucleotide probes for EMSA corresponded to the three potential NF-κB binding sites in the c-IAP2 promoter (NF-κB site 1: sense, 5′-ATGGAAATCCCCGA-3′ and antisense, 5′-TCGGGGATTTCCAT-3′; NF-κB site 2: sense, 5′-AGTGGGTTTGCCAG-3′ and antisense, 5′-CTGGCAAACCCACT-3′; NF-κB site 3: sense, 5′-GCTGGAGTTCCCCT-3′ and antisense, 5′-AGGGGAACTCCAGC-3′). Two oligonucleotides complementary to each other were annealed to generate a double stranded probe. End labeling was accomplished by treatment of T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Approximately 1 ng of the labeled probe was mixed with 2.4 μg of nuclear protein in a total of 20 μl of the binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) containing 2 μg of poly(dI·dC). After incubation for 20 min, the reaction mixture was separated on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel with 0.5× TBE buffer (40 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). The gel was vacuum-dried and subjected to autoradiography. For competition experiments, a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled double stranded probe was added prior to the addition of the labeled probe as specified. For supershift experiments, 0.2 μg of antibody was added to the mixture before the addition of the labeled probe. All antibodies used in these experiments were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For cloning of the 5′-flanking region of the c-IAP2 gene, a λDASH II HeLa cell genomic library was screened with a probe directed against the full length c-IAP2 cDNA sequence. Southern blot and restriction enzyme analysis of DNA from nine strongly hybridizing clones led to the identification of one clone termed λ10-a, which contained the 5′-flanking region of c-IAP2. After digestion with various restriction enzymes, fragments of the genomic insert were cloned into pBluescript KS(+) and their partial nucleotide sequences were determined. Fig. 1 A shows the map of clone λ10-a relative to the genomic organization reported by Young et al. (22.Young S.S. Liston P. Xuan J.Y. McRoberts C. Lefebvre C.A. Korneluk R.G. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Because it has been reported thatc-IAP2 gene is induced by TNF (10.Chu Z.L. McKinsey T.A. Liu L. Gentry J.J. Malim M.H. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10057-10062Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 17.Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar), we initially tried to analyze whether the region upstream from the 5′-end of the longest cDNA filed (GenBankTM accession number AF070674) possesses the promoter activity conferring TNF inducibility by reporter gene transfection analysis. The 3.5-kb SpeI-SphI fragment and its 5′- or 3′-deleted fragments were linked to theluciferase reporter gene in the pGL2 basic plasmid (Fig.1 B), and the resultant reporter plasmid constructs were transiently transfected into human embryonic kidney cell line 293 cells. After 24 h, transfected cells were treated with TNF for 4 h and examined for TNF-induced luciferase expression. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the SpeI-SphI fragment showed a strong promoter activity, enhancing the luciferase activity by 8.5-fold upon TNF stimulation. The promoter activity imparting TNF inducibility did not change with the transfection of the reporter plasmids having the BamHI-SphI segment in which the 2.1-kb region was removed from the 5′-side of theSpeI-SphI fragment, yielding a 10-fold induction. However, the SpeI-BamHI segment upstream of the putative transcription start site, determined previously using the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends method (22.Young S.S. Liston P. Xuan J.Y. McRoberts C. Lefebvre C.A. Korneluk R.G. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), revealed no promoter activity. To further confirm the functional importance of the promoter region we assigned, the reporter plasmids were cotransfected with plasmid expressing either NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) or NF-κB subunit p65, and the transfected cells were examined for luciferase activities. As shown in Fig. 1 D, both NIK and p65 were able to activate luciferase expression in cells transfected with theBamHI-SphI segment-containing reporter constructs but not in cells transfected with the SpeI-BamHI segment-containing construct, indicating that the promoter region conferring NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activation ofc-IAP2 gene resides downstream of the previously proposed transcription start site. The 3.5-kb SpeI-SphI segment of the 5′-flanking region of the c-IAP2 gene was sequenced. The resulting sequence features a number of elements characteristic of eukaryotic promoters and their regulatory regions (Fig.2). Several attempts were made but failed to assign the transcription start site by primer extension analysis due to the inherent technical difficulty of obtaining the intact mRNA whose length of the 5′-untranslated region of c-IAP2 mRNA is estimated to be longer than 3.5 kb. For convenience, however, we arbitrary assigned the sequence number +1 for the nucleotide G that was documented as a 5′-end residue of the longest cDNA clone. Based on this numbering, a TATA-like box (TTTAAA) was identified at position −42. Several potential regulatory elements were found by computer search using the MatInspector software (Genomatrix). Two interferon regulatory factor-1 consensus sequences were detected at positions −130 and −475. Two potential binding sites for activator protein-1 (AP-1) (at −220 and −294) and four nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) binding sites (at −301, −354, −821, and −1086) as well as a glucocorticoid responsible element (at −514) were found. Most importantly, three putative NF-κB binding sites were identified at positions −147, −197, and −210. To localize important regulatory regions within the 5′-flanking sequence of c-IAP2, which confer TNF or IL-1 inducibility, 293 or HeLa cells were transfected with constructs of serially deleted sequences of the c-IAP2 promoter linked to theluciferase gene. The length of the 5′-flanking region incorporated into the constructs ranged from 93 base pairs to 1.4 kb (Fig. 3 A). Upon transfection of the cells with the eight different constructs, cultures were divided into three groups that were, respectively, left untreated, treated with TNF, or treated with IL-1. No significant inducible luciferase activity by TNF or IL-1 was detected with the shortest construct −93LUC used (Fig. 3, B and C). However, construct −174LUC, which in addition to the TATA-box, incorporates also the interferon regulatory factor site and proximal NF-κB site 3, mediated TNF and IL-1-inducible promoter activity as shown by a 3- to 4-fold increase in luciferase activity over the untreated control. Transfection of the −200LUC construct, containing an additional NF-κB site 2, resulted in a similar fold induction with the −174LUC construct, whereas the −247LUC construct, possessing all the potential NF-κB sites 1, 2, and 3, produced a significantly higher fold increase in luciferase activity than those observed with the −174LUC and −200LUC constructs following TNF or IL-1 treatment (11- to 12-fold induction in 293 and HeLa cells by TNF, 16-fold induction in HeLa cells by IL-1). When transfected with the four longer constructs, the level of luciferase activity did not show much variation, suggesting that the major elements mediating transcriptional activation of the c-IAP2gene by TNF and IL-1 are located between positions −247 and −93, in which more than one NF-κB binding sites are functionally involved. The results were reproduced in many confirmatory experiments. With the −174LUC construct, stimulation of the luciferase activity in 293 cells by TNF over the untreated control ranged from the low of 2.5-fold to the high of 4.3-fold; in the experiments using the −247LUC construct, stimulation by TNF ranged from 8.4- to 14-fold. Because our data indicated that TNF- or IL-1-inducible transcriptional activation ofc-IAP2 gene expression could be directed by NF-κB binding elements resided in the 5′-flanking region between −247 and −93, we determined which of the potential NF-κB sites were functional. We introduced mutations into the −247LUC construct using the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's guidelines, generating four different constructs, each of which contained one or two mutated NF-κB sequences (Fig.4 A). The NF-κB mutant at site 2 retained the full TNF or IL-1 inducibility as much as, or even higher, than that seen with the wild type −247LUC construct, whereas the double mutation at both sites 1 and 3 exhibited no inducibility, thus indicating that the NF-κB site 2 is not functional. Mutation of the NF-κB elements at sites 1 and 3 resulted in loss of inducible promoter activity by 45% and 68%, respectively, although inducibility by TNF was still evident (Fig. 4 B). These results indicate that both sites are functionally important for c-IAP2promoter activity inducible by TNF and that they cooperatively regulatec-IAP2 gene expression. To determine whether nuclear proteins could bind to the NF-κB binding elements embedded in thec-IAP2 promoter, EMSA was performed with nuclear extracts of TNF-stimulated 293 or HeLa cells using specific oligonucleotides containing the NF-κB elements at sites 1, 2, and 3. Fig.5 A shows that 293 extracts treated with TNF for 30 min resulted in the induction of nuclear protein complex that bound to NF-κB sites 1 and 3 but not to the site 2. Competition assays using excess unlabeled wild type oligonucleotides of sites 1 and 3 resulted in loss of the radioisotope-labeled bands, whereas the respective mutant oligonucleotides did not have any effect, confirming the binding specificity of nuclear proteins to the NF-κB sites 1 and 3. These results are consistent with those obtained from the mutational analysis of the respective NF-κB sites in which the NF-κB element at site 1 and site 3 were functional in driving the transcriptional activation following TNF stimulation. To characterize the nuclear protein complexes bound to the NF-κB sites 1 and 3, supershift assay was performed using antibodies against NF-κB proteins p50, p65, and c-Rel and an unrelated NF-IL-6 antibody. Fig.5 B shows that preincubation with the p50 or p65 antibodies reduced the level of protein-DNA complexes of NF-κB sites 1 and 3. Furthermore, when pretreated with both antibodies, the protein-DNA complexes disappeared almost completely. However, antibodies recognizing c-Rel, another member of NF-κB proteins, and the unrelated NF-IL6 did not affect supershifting of proteins complexed with NF-κB sites 1 or 3. Essentially, similar results were obtained in experiments using HeLa cell nuclear extracts. Therefore, our results indicate that the NF-κB sites 1 and 3 could be bound by the NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimeric complex in both cell types. Given that c-IAP2 mRNA is up-regulated by CD40 stimulation in B lymphocytes (19.Craxton A. Shu G. Graves J.D. Saklatvala J. Krebs E.G. Clark E.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3225-3236PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated whether overexpression of CD40 is capable of enhancingc-IAP2 promoter activity. We also investigated whether Epstein-Barr virus LMP1 can induce the c-IAP2 promoter activity. LMP1 is known to be involved in B cell transformation (25.Kaye K. Izumi K.M. Kieff E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Scl. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9150-9154Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) and induces the antiapoptotic genes A20 and Bcl-2through NF-κB activation (26.Laherty C.D. Hu H.M. Opipari A.W. Wang F.

Cell. 1991; 65: 1107-1115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). 293 cells were transfected with the plasmids expressing CD40 or LMP1 along with either the −247LUC reporter construct or its mutant counter part (−247(mκB1,3)LUC). Also included is the TNFR1 expression plasmid whose expression elicits spontaneous NF-κB activation and apoptotic signaling in the transfected cells (23.Kim C.H. Song Y.H. Park K. Oh Y. Lee T.H. J. Inflamm. 1995; 45: 312-322PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Boldin M.P. Mett I.L. Varfolomeev E.E. Chumakov I. Shemer-Avni Y. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 387-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows that overexpression of TNFR1, CD40, or LMP1 in 293 cells resulted in a strong luciferase gene expression driven by the −247LUC construct but not by its mutant promoter construct in which two functional NF-κB sites were disrupted, indicating a NF-κB-dependent c-IAP2 promoter activation by CD40 and LMP1. It is becoming evident that NF-κB appears to exert its antiapoptotic function through the induction of antiapoptotic genes, which include c-IAP1, c-IAP2, XIAP,Bcl2, IEX-1L, and A20 (4.Wu M.X. Ao Z.

Among members of the IAP family, c-IAP2 is particularly interesting in the sense that, first, not only is its expression under the control of NF-κB but also c-IAP2 conversely can activate NF-κB (10.Chu Z.L.

Second, according to the previous reports, c-IAP2 is inducible by a variety of NF-κB-inducing stimuli, including TNF, IL-1, CD40, lipopolysaccharide, and etoposide in multiple cell lines, whereas induction of c-IAP1 and XIAP appears to be cell-type and stimulus-dependent (8.Shu H.B.

Despite such indication that c-IAP2 gene is preferentially up-regulated by NF-κB among the IAPs, direct evidence of transcriptional regulation of NF-κB on c-IAP2 is still missing. The purpose of this study was to clone and characterize the 5′-flanking region of the c-IAP2 gene and to identify the cis-regulatory elements responsible for transcriptional activation of thec-IAP2 gene. Recently, the physical genomic map of c-IAP2 gene was reported by Young et al. (22.Young S.S. Liston P. Xuan J.Y. McRoberts C. Lefebvre C.A. Korneluk R.G. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). They determined the putative transcription start site by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends polymerase chain reaction and documented the partial sequence information upstream of their proposed start site. In our studies, however, the 2.1-kb segment upstream of the proposed transcription start site did not exhibit basal promoter activity as well as NF-κB-dependent reporter gene activation, instead, the 1.4-kb segment downstream from the proposed transcription start site could direct the transcriptional activation of the c-IAP2gene following stimulation of cells with TNF or transfection of NIK or p65 (Fig. 1). In addition, the downstream region from the proposed start site featured a number of elements typical to the eukaryotic promoter including a TATA-like box (TTTAAA) found in many eukaryotic promoters, for example TSG6 (31.Lee T.H. Klampfer L. Shows T.B. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6154-6160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), rat creatine kinase (32.Hobson G.M. Molloy G.R. Benfield P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6533-6543Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and mouseEGF genes (33.Fenton S.E. Groce N.S. Lee D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30870-30878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, our results strongly suggest that the promoter region of the c-IAP2 gene, which confers NF-κB-dependent inducibility, is located downstream of the proposed transcription start site. It is possible that the regulatory enhancer elements responsible for this inducible expression may reside downstream of the transcription start site or within the intron(s) of the c-IAP2 gene. However, this issue can be clarified by determining precise transcription initiation sites by more reliable methods such as primer extension analysis, although in our hands several trials have failed, because of its inherent difficulty to obtain intact c-IAP2 mRNA, which has a 5′-untranslated region estimated to be longer than 3.5 kb. Several potential cis-acting enhancer elements have been identified in the sequence of the 5′-flanking region of the c-IAP2 gene. The transfection experiments of the promoter deletion constructs linked to the luciferase gene revealed that the region conferring TNF- or IL-1-inducible promoter activation resides between −247 and −93 of the c-IAP2 promoter. Site-directed mutational analysis and EMSA of the putative NF-κB binding sites incorporated within the −247 region of the promoter identified that two NF-κB binding elements at positions −147 and −210 are required for promoter activity and that they function cooperatively in mediating transcriptional activation of the c-IAP2 gene. In addition, supershifting experiments with antibodies against NF-κB subunits characterized that the two NF-κB binding sites could be recognized and bound by the NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimeric complex. Therefore, our results provide direct mechanistic evidence of transcriptional regulation of NF-κB on c-IAP2 gene and a confirmatory proof of the notion that NF-κB functions as a primary factor in the regulation of genes involved in cell survival or protection in response to apoptotic stimuli. Despite the predominant role of NF-κB in c-IAP2 gene expression as characterized by the present study, a recent report suggests that induction of c-IAP2 gene is not solely dependent on NF-κB activation (34.Wen L.P. Madani K. Fahrni J.A. Duncan S.R. Rosen G.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: 921-929PubMed Google Scholar). c-IAP2 can be induced by dexamethasone and, to a higher extent, by treatment of dexamethasone plus interferon-γ in a lung carcinoma cell line, A549, in the setting that dexamethasone protects the cells from apoptosis induced by interferon-γ and anti-Fas antibody (34.Wen L.P. Madani K. Fahrni J.A. Duncan S.R. Rosen G.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: 921-929PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that dexamethasone and interferon-γ act in synergy to induce c-IAP2. In this regard, it is of interest that a glucocorticoid response element at position −514 as well as interferon regulatory factor-1 inducible interferon-γ binding sites at position −130 and −475 were identified by computer search in the 5′-flanking promoter region of thec-IAP2 gene. Whether those elements can function as specific binding sites in the context of the c-IAP2 5′-flanking DNA remains to be elucidated. In addition, according to a recent report (35.Schwenzer R. Siemienski K. Liptay S. Schubert G. Peters N. Scheurich P. Schmid R.M. Wajant H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19368-19374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), stimulation of T cell receptor (TCR) can also induce c-IAP2 in the T cell line DII/27. It showed that the TCR-mediated induction ofc-IAP2 gene was slower but stronger than that mediated by TNF. In their study, endogenously produced TNF and lymphotoxin α in the culture medium appeared not to be involved in the TCR-mediated c-IAP2 induction, because the respective neutralizing antibodies did not affect the level of c-IAP2 mRNA. It is well established that TCR-mediated transcriptional regulation that initiates cytokine gene expression requires several signaling pathways, which activate different transcription factors simultaneously. For example, TCR-induced activation of AP-1, NFAT, and NF-κB all cooperate to enhance IL-2 gene transcription (36.Cantrell D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 7: 579-600Google Scholar). Therefore, it is noteworthy that four potential consensus NFAT binding elements are incorporated in the 5′-flanking sequence of c-IAP2. Whether NFAT plays a role in the c-IAP2 promoter during TCR stimulation remains to be elucidated. In this sense, the present characterization of the 5′-flanking sequence of the c-IAP2 gene makes it possible to direct future efforts at a precise identification of the cis-acting elements and corresponding transactivating factors involved in the TCR- or dexamethasone-mediated c-IAP2 gene induction. Another noteworthy finding in this study is that overexpression of CD40 or LMP1 resulted in the c-IAP2 promoter-driven reporter gene activation. CD40 and LMP1 are cell surface receptors triggering NF-κB activation and, consequently, up-regulating the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and A20 (26.Laherty C.D. Hu H.M. Opipari A.W. Wang F. Dixit V.M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12343-12346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Along with the report that CD40 stimulation on B cells differentially increased the steady-state level of c-IAP2 mRNA, although not significantly inducing the levels of other family members (XIAP, NAIP, and c-IAP-1) (19.Craxton A. Shu G. Graves J.D. Saklatvala J. Krebs E.G. Clark E.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3225-3236PubMed Google Scholar), our demonstration that CD40 activated the c-IAP2 promoter suggests that one mechanism by which CD40 rescues cells from apoptosis is via up-regulation of c-IAP2. Also our results suggest that LMP1, an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent membrane protein responsible partly for B cell transformation, mediates enhanced expression of c-IAP2 mRNA. In these regards, it is very interesting that LMP1 proteins are present in the Reed-Sternberg cells in more than 70% of Hodgkin's disease cases (38.Herbst H. Niedobitek G. Int. J. Clin. Lab. Res. 1993; 23: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and that the high level of c-IAP2 expression is seen in the Reed-Sternberg cells (39.Messineo C. Jamerson M.H. Hunter E. Braziel R. Bagg A. Irving S.G. Cossman J. Blood. 1998; 91: 2443-2451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also of interest is that TRAF1 is shown to be overexpressed in the Reed-Sternberg cells and EBV-transformed lymphoid cells (40.Durkop H. Foss H.D. Demel G. Klotzbach H. Hahn C. Stein H. Blood. 1999; 93: 617-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, TRAF1 can be induced by LMP1 in the B lymphocyte cell line (41.Mosialos G. Birkenbach M. Yalamanchili R. VanArsdale T. Ware C. Kieff E. Cell. 1995; 80: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar), and its overexpression inhibits antigen-induced CD8+ T lymphocyte apoptosis (42.Speiser D.E. Lee S.Y. Wong B. Arron J. Santana A. Kong Y.Y. Ohashi P.S. Choi Y. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). As indicated, TRAF1 is associated with the protection of apoptosis induced by TNF under the circumstances in which TRAF1, TRAF2, c-IAP-1, and c-IAP2 are all expressed (17.Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar). Therefore, it can be speculated that the LMP1-inducible c-IAP2 protein functions as a prosurvival or antiapoptotic factor in certain EBV-associated lymphoid cell proliferation or transformation such as those seen with the Reed-Sternberg cell, acting independently or in concert with TRAF1 or other LMP1-inducible antiapoptotic proteins such as A20 and Bcl-2. Further investigations are necessary to clarify the role of c-IAP2 in EBV-associated lymphoproliferation and in Hodgkin's disease. Taken together, the data presented here confirm the antiapoptotic protein c-IAP2 as a target of NF-κB signaling, the expression of which is tightly dependent on the presence of two NF-κB binding elements within the promoter. We found c-IAP2 to be induced by stimulation of a variety of cell surface receptors, including TNFR1, IL-1 receptor, CD40, and LMP1, which trigger NF-κB activation. Therefore, the present elucidation of the transcriptional regulating mechanism of the c-IAP2 gene expression provides an additional proof of the notion that transcriptional activation of NF-κB on antiapoptotic genes is a common mechanism involved in the survival or protective effect in response to various apoptotic stimuli. This also sheds more light on the role of c-IAP2 in tumor cell survival, transformation, and anticancer drug resistance."

In this report we demonstrate that activation of the Fas receptor present on a human breast epithelial cell line resulted in a conformational change in the N terminus of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax. This conformational change appeared to occur in the cytosol and precede Bax translocation to the mitochondria. Overexpression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 inhibited both the conformational change of Bax as well as its relocalization to the mitochondria. Bcl-2 overexpression did not, however, inhibit Fas-induced cleavage of both procaspase-8 and the pro-apoptotic protein Bid, indicating that Bcl-2 functions downstream of these events. These results suggest that the mechanism by which Bcl-2 inhibits Bax mitochondrial translocation and subsequent amplification of the apoptotic cascade is not by providing a physical barrier to Bax, but rather by inhibiting an upstream event necessary for Bax conformational change.

During this process mitochondrial dysfunction occurs, evidenced by dissipation of the electrochemical gradient, uncoupling of the respiratory chain, and production of reactive oxygen species (5.Adachi S.

However, recent evidence suggests that the Fas-induced cell death pathway may bifurcate with predominantly mitochondrial-dependent or -independent mechanisms (8.Kuwana T. Smith J.J. Muzio M. Dixit V.

Members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins interact to set a threshold for cell death, although they may also act independently (10.Kroemer G. Nat.

Recent data indicate that the pro-apoptotic molecule Bax is a monomeric and predominantly cytosolic protein in unstressed cells despite the presence of a C-terminal hydrophobic domain that is required for membrane insertion and Bax-induced cell death (12.Wolter K.G. Hsu Y.-T. Smith C.L. Nechushtan A. Xi X.-G. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar, 13.Hsu Y.-T. Youle R.J. J. Biol.

Insertion of Bax into the mitochondrial membrane appears to be sufficient to induce cytochrome c release, an event that may act to amplify the apoptotic signal (8.Kuwana T. Smith J.J. Muzio M.

Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6236) Google Scholar). Mutations in the C terminus can also result in both constitutively mitochondrial or cytoplasmic Bax protein (17.Nechushtan A. Smith C.L. Hsu Y.-T. Youle R.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2330-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Deletion of the N terminus, or enforced dimerization of Bax, results in direct targeting of Bax to the mitochondria and enhanced cytotoxicity (18.Goping I.S. Gross A. Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Jemmerson R. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 19.Gross A. Jockel J. Wei M.C. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3878-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Bid is a pro-apoptotic molecule that belongs to a class of the Bcl-2 family that has little homology to other members, containing only a single BH domain (BH3) (20.Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Bid is unique among the BH3-only class of proteins in that it has been reported to be able to complex with either pro- or anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, potentially enhancing or antagonizing their function (21.Kelekar A. Thompson C.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Bid, which lacks a C-terminal transmembrane domain, is predominantly cytosolic in living cells. It is cleaved and activated by caspase-8, and the truncated protein translocates to the mitochondria apparently triggering cytochrome c release (22.Gross A. Yin X.-M. Wang K. Wei M.C. Jockel J.

Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3789) Google Scholar). A recent model of Fas-induced apoptosis suggests that Bid causes a conformational change in the N terminus of Bax, resulting in mitochondrial cytochrome crelease and amplification of the apoptotic cascade (25.Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Martinou J.-C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear whether the conformational change in Bax occurs prior or subsequent to mitochondrial membrane insertion. Hsu and Youle (13.Hsu Y.-T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar,26.Hsu Y.-T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13829-13834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) have reported a detergent-induced conformational change in the N terminus of Bax (amino acids 12–24), which appears to be required for both homo- and heterodimerization with Bcl-xL. However, the physiological significance and relevance to its role in apoptosis is unknown. We have previously demonstrated that activation of the Fas receptor leads to Bax translocation from the cytosol to the mitochondria that can be inhibited by Bcl-2 overexpression (27.Murphy K.M. Streips U.N. Lock R.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5991-5999Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In the present report we demonstrate that activation of the Fas receptor results in a conformational change in the N terminus of Bax, which appears to precede its translocation to the mitochondria. Our findings that overexpression of Bcl-2 does not inhibit Fas-induced cleavage of procaspase-8 or Bid, but does inhibit both the Bax conformational change and mitochondrial translocation, provide further insight into the Fas apoptotic pathway. Mid-passage MCF10A1 cells, a spontaneously immortalized non-tumorigenic human breast epithelial cell line, were obtained from the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute. The transfection, selection, and growth conditions used for both control vector transfected (N10) and stable Bcl-2-expressing (B30) clones have been described previously (27.Murphy K.M. Streips U.N. Lock R.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5991-5999Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Anti-Fas monoclonal antibody (clone CH11, Upstate Biotechnology) was stored at −20 °C and diluted directly into tissue culture medium. Cells were exposed to 100 ng/ml anti-Fas antibody plus 1 μg/ml cycloheximide (Calbiochem). For separation of subcellular cytosolic and nuclear/membrane fractions, 107cells were washed twice with PBS at 4 °C and resuspended in 1 ml of extraction buffer (50 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 50 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A). Cells were lysed by five cycles of freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing at 37 °C. After microscopic examination with trypan blue verified that >95% cells were lysed, the crude lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant, which consisted of the cytosol, was separated from the pellet that contained the cellular membrane and organelles, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of extraction buffer. Immunoblotting for the nuclear protein topoisomerase I (clone C-21, kindly provided by Dr. Y.-C. Cheng, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT) and the mitochondrial protein COXVIc (clone 3G5-F7-G3, Molecular Probes) revealed no cross-contamination of these organelles in the cytosolic fraction by this method of fractionation. As a cytosolic marker, a lactate dehydrogenase assay kit (Sigma) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions, and experiments were only deemed valid if >95% of the total lactate dehydrogenase activity was detected in the cytosolic fraction. Whole cell extracts were prepared by lysing 107 cells in 1 ml of either Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm orthovanadate, plus protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) or CHAPS lysis buffer (10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% CHAPS, plus protease inhibitor mixture) on ice for 30 min. The crude lysate was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and the supernatant stored at −80 °C. Protein concentration was estimated by the bicinchoninic acid assay method (Pierce) using a BSA standard. Equal amounts of protein, or equal volumes of cytosol and membrane fractions, were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Primary antibodies used were rabbit polyclonal antisera raised against human Bcl-2, Bax (PharMingen), and actin (Sigma); a goat polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 176–195 of human Bid (Santa Cruz); and a mouse monoclonal against COXVIc(Molecular Probes). Secondary antibodies used were horseradish peroxidase conjugates of anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz). Chemiluminescent signals were generated by the addition of SuperSignal Ultra Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). Proteins were visualized using radiographic film and quantified using a Bio-Rad GS-525 Molecular Imager System with Multi-Analyst version 1.0.2 software. Preliminary experiments had verified the linearity of protein quantification using the Molecular Imager System (data not shown). Equal amounts of protein from whole cell lysates (1 mg) or cytosolic fractions (750 μg) were used for immunoprecipitation. The KCl concentration of the cytosolic lysates was adjusted to 150 mm, and all samples were brought to a final volume of 450 μl with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl. Samples were rotated for 2 h at 4 °C with 6 μg of monoclonal anti-Bax 6A7 (Trevigen) or 7 μl of polyclonal anti-Bax (PharMingen). Antigen-antibody complexes were immobilized by rotation for 2 h at 4 °C with protein G-agarose (Pierce) for monoclonal anti-Bax or protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for polyclonal anti-Bax. The complexes were centrifuged and the supernatant removed with an aliquot being stored for subsequent analysis. The complexes were then washed five times with the same buffer used for the immunoprecipitation and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as described above. Cells were grown on No. 1 glass coverslips under the same conditions described above. Prior to Fas activation, cells were labeled with Mitotracker Red CM-H2XRos (Molecular Probes). Preliminary experiments had determined the minimum concentration and time required for optimal Mitotracker Red staining of MCF10A1 cells to be 2 μm for 45 min at 37 °C. Treatments with Fas-activating antibody were carried out as described above. At the indicated time points, cells were washed twice in PBS, fixed for 30 min in 3% formaldehyde, and permeabilized for 2 min with 0.2% CHAPS/PBS. Cells were then incubated with mouse anti-Bax 6A7 monoclonal antibody (Trevigen) diluted 1:300 in 3% BSA/PBS for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified chamber. Excess antibody was removed by washing the coverslips six times with PBS. Cells were then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) diluted 1:20 in 3% BSA/PBS, for 1 h protected from light. After washing six times with PBS, coverslips were mounted onto microscope slides using ProLong antifade mounting reagent (Molecular Probes). Control slides were stained with secondary antibody alone. Immunofluorescence of total Bax was performed using a rabbit anti-Bax polyclonal antibody, as we have described previously (27.Murphy K.M. Streips U.N. Lock R.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5991-5999Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cells were viewed under a Zeiss Axioskop 20 fluorescence microscope and imaged using the Bio-Rad MRC 1024 Laser Confocal Imaging System. For each time point, at least 300 cells were counted and the numbers reported represent the average and S.E. of two experiments. We have shown previously that treatment of MCF10A1 N10 cells with anti-Fas antibody results in a redistribution of Bax from the cytosol to the mitochondria, which is inhibited by overexpression of Bcl-2 (B30 cells) (27.Murphy K.M. Streips U.N. Lock R.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5991-5999Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To study the conformation of Bax during this translocation we used the 6A7 monoclonal antibody, which recognizes a detergent-induced conformation of Bax, but not native Bax (13.Hsu Y.-T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 17.Nechushtan A. Smith C.L. Hsu Y.-T. Youle R.J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13829-13834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows immunofluorescence with anti-Bax 6A7 (green) either alone (A–C, G, andH) or merged with mitochondrial staining (red)(D–F, I, and J). Untreated N10 and B30 cells were negative for staining with 6A7 (A, D, G, I), consistent with previous results using COS-7 cells (17.Nechushtan A. Smith C.L. Hsu Y.-T. Youle R.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2330-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Treatment of N10 cells with anti-Fas induced a conformational change in Bax, resulting in a punctate staining pattern (B, C, E, F). At early time points (2 h, B and E) a proportion of conformationally changed Bax appeared not to co-localize to the mitochondria. In some cells there was extremely little co-localization as indicated by the green color observed in Fig. 1 E, while in other cells there was a mixture of non-co-localized and co-localized Bax indicated by green and yellow, respectively (Fig. 1 E). At a later treatment time point (4 h) a significant proportion of 6A7 staining was yellow (Fig.1 F), indicating its co-localization to the mitochondria, while apoptotic morphology was also observed in some cells. The remainder of the intracellular green staining observed in Fig. 1 F is consistent with our previous report that only 35–40% of total Bax had translocated to mitochondria at 4 h following Fas activation (27.Murphy K.M. Streips U.N. Lock R.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5991-5999Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Overall, these data raise the possibility that the conformational change of Bax precedes translocation to the mitochondria. Notably, the Bax conformational change was observed before morphological evidence of apoptosis, and once associated with the mitochondria, Bax maintained this altered conformation as the cells executed apoptosis. Strikingly, overexpression of Bcl-2 inhibited the conformational change of Bax (Fig. 1, H and J). Fig. 1 K shows graphically the time-dependent increase in immunoreactivity with anti-Bax 6A7 in N10 cells, while the conformational change is inhibited in B30 cells. The proportion of N10 and B30 cells exhibiting a punctate Bax staining pattern, indicative of mitochondrial translocation, was assessed as we have described (27.Murphy K.M. Streips U.N. Lock R.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5991-5999Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) using a polyclonal antibody that recognizes both native and conformationally active Bax (total Bax, Fig. 1 K). The increase in the proportion of cells with punctate total Bax staining showed a similar time course, albeit slightly delayed, as that for conformationally changed Bax (6A7). In an attempt to confirm the immunofluorescence results, immunoprecipitation with 6A7 was performed on the cytosolic fractions of N10 and B30 cells that had been lysed in the absence of detergents. As controls, immunoprecipitations were performed on cells lysed with 0.2% Nonidet P-40 or 1% CHAPS. Consistent with the results of Hsu and Youle (13.Hsu Y.-T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), lysis with Nonidet P-40 induced a conformational change in Bax, allowing its immunoprecipitation with 6A7 (Fig.2 A, lane a). In contrast, CHAPS lysis did not induce a Bax conformational change, prohibiting immunoprecipitation with 6A7 (lane b). In the cytosolic fraction of untreated N10 or B30 cells lysed in the absence of detergents, Bax was in its native conformation and therefore was not immunoprecipitated by anti-Bax 6A7 (Fig. 2 A, lanes c and f), in agreement with a previous study using mouse L929 cells (17.Nechushtan A. Smith C.L. Hsu Y.-T. Youle R.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2330-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). After 3- and 6-h treatment with anti-Fas, the conformationally changed Bax was detected in the immunoprecipitate of the cytosolic fractions of N10 cells (Fig. 2 A, lanes d and e). Fig. 2 B shows Bax relocalization from the cytosol (lanes a–c) to the membrane compartment (lanes d–f), and subsequent proteolysis (lane f) during Fas activation, demonstrating that the decreased amount of Bax protein in the 6-h supernatant from the immunoprecipitation (Fig.2 A, lane e) reflects its relocalization to the membrane compartment. Thus, we have demonstrated by two different methods that the conformational change in Bax can be detected in the cytosol of anti-Fas-treated N10 cells. These results differ from those of Desagheret al. (25.Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Martinou J.-C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar) who described a conformational change in Bax but concluded that Bax is constitutively associated with the mitochondria and undergoes a conformational change within that location. The apparent differences in Bax localization between this study and that by Desagher et al. (25.Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Martinou J.-C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar) may be due to the methods used to prepare subcellular fractions or to cell type-specific variations. Notably, our studies have not made the distinction between Bax that is merely associated with the mitochondrial membrane and that which is inserted (i.e. resistant to alkali extraction). Overexpression of Bcl-2 significantly delayed Bax conformational change and membrane translocation. After 6 h of treatment of N10 cells, greater than 90% of Bax was membrane-bound, and the majority of the cells were apoptotic (Fig. 2 B, lane f, and data not shown). In contrast, there was no detectable conformational change or translocation of Bax within the first 6 h of treatment of B30 cells (Fig. 2 A, lane g, Fig. 2 B,lanes k–m, and Fig. 1, H and J). At 6-h treatment and beyond there was a loss of Bcl-2 expression presumably due to proteolysis (Fig. 2 B, lanes mand n) (28.Cheng E.H.-Y. Kirsch D. Clem R.J. Ravi R. Kastan M.B. Bedi A. Ueno K. Hardwick J.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1966-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). At 12 h of treatment the Bax conformational change was detected in B30 cells (Fig. 2 A,lane h), and its membrane translocation and proteolysis were observed (Fig. 2 B, lane n). Clearly, however, the Bax conformational change and membrane translocation in B30 cells occurred subsequent to the loss of Bcl-2 expression. These results suggest that Bcl-2, a membrane-bound protein, inhibits the conformational change of Bax that occurs in the cytosol. A potential upstream event for Bcl-2 regulation of Bax conformation change is the cleavage of Bid. Overexpression of Bcl-2 did not alter the subcellular localization of Bid, which was cytosolic in both N10 and B30 cells (Fig. 3 A). Fig.3 B demonstrates that overexpression of Bcl-2 did not inhibit processing of procaspase-8, which supports previously published reports that Bcl-xL functions downstream of caspase-8 activation (29.Srinivasan A. Li F. Wong A. Kodandapani L. Smidt R. Krebs J.F. Fritz L.C. Wu J.C. Tomaselli K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4523-4529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 30.Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3388-3393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 B also demonstrates that overexpression of Bcl-2 did not inhibit Fas-induced cleavage of Bid. We were, however, unable to detect a cleaved product in the membrane compartment of N10 or B30 cells. The time course of Bid cleavage does suggest that it preceded insertion of Bax since after 3 h of treatment, greater than 70% of Bid was cleaved (Fig. 3 B), while there was only a slight (approximately 20%) relocalization of Bax to the membrane compartment in N10 cells (Fig. 2 B, lanes b ande). Two previous reports suggest that Bid directly interacts with both Bax and Bcl-2 (20.Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 25.Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Martinou J.-C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). To investigate interactions between Bid and Bax during Fas-induced apoptosis, N10 cells were treated, lysed in 1% CHAPS, and immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal anti-Bax antibody. Fig.3 C demonstrates that neither full-length nor cleaved Bid co-immunoprecipitated with Bax. We also re-probed the immunoblot of the anti-Bax 6A7 immunoprecipitation in Fig. 2 A for Bid and were unable to detect any full-length or cleaved Bid that co-immunoprecipitated with conformationally changed Bax (data not shown). In addition, immunoprecipitations with anti-Bcl-2 antibody detected no Bid/Bcl-2 interactions (data not shown). Thus, using samples lysed with CHAPS we were unable to detect native Bid, full-length or cleaved, interaction with native Bax or Bcl-2. This does not rule out the possibility that Bid may be responsible for Bax conformational change, but our results indicate that if a Bid/Bax interaction occurs the interaction is not stable enough to survive immunoprecipitation. To verify that Bax/Bid interactions do not occur under conditions that allow Bax/Bcl-2 dimerization (26.Hsu Y.-T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13829-13834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), N10 and B30 cells were lysed in the presence of Nonidet P-40 and immunoprecipitated using polyclonal anti-Bax antibody. Fig. 3 D shows that a significant amount (approximately 20%) of Bcl-2 was co-immunoprecipitated with Bax from the B30 cell lysate. Despite this observation, there was no indication that any of the Bid protein co-immunoprecipitated with Bax from either the N10 or B30 cell lysates. Interestingly, previous reports of Bid interacting with Bax or Bcl-2 have used recombinant proteins in vitro or cells expressing ectopic Bid that were lysed with Nonidet P-40 (20.Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 25.Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Martinou J.-C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that endogenous cellular Bid and Bax do not dimerize to any significant degree. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that activation of the Fas receptor results in a conformational change in the N terminus of native Bax protein (amino acids 12–24). The conformational change appeared to precede its translocation to the mitochondria. This conformational change, which can be induced by detergents, may be necessary for Bax to interact with other members of the Bcl-2 family (13.Hsu Y.-T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 26.Hsu Y.-T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13829-13834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The structure of Bax is currently unknown; however, x-ray crystallography of the related family member Bcl-xLsuggests that the N terminus and BH3 domain are adjacent to the C-terminal amino acid 197 (31.Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.-L. Ng S.-C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). The Bax C terminus is known to be required for redistribution during apoptosis (12.Wolter K.G. Hsu Y.-T. Smith C.L. Nechushtan A. Xi X.-G. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar), while the N terminus negatively regulates Bax membrane insertion (18.Goping I.S. Gross A. Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Jemmerson R. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Based on these and other studies it has been hypothesized that in its native conformation the N terminus of Bax masks domains at the C terminus that are required for mitochondrial translocation (17.Nechushtan A. Smith C.L. Hsu Y.-T. Youle R.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2330-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Bax molecules containing C-terminal deletions or substitutions that cause its constitutive localization to mitochondria do not undergo N-terminal conformational change until the application of an apoptotic stress (17.Nechushtan A. Smith C.L. Hsu Y.-T. Youle R.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2330-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). In the same study, the temporal relationship between N-terminal conformational change and mitochondrial translocation of wild-type Bax was not delineated (17.Nechushtan A. Smith C.L. Hsu Y.-T. Youle R.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2330-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Our data support a model in which, following application of an apoptotic stress such as Fas activation, Bax undergoes an N-terminal conformational change while residing in the cytosol, thereby unmasking the C-terminal hydrophobic domain allowing insertion into the mitochondrial membrane. In support of this model, high pH was recently shown to induce an N-terminal conformational change of cytosolic Bax in lymphoid cells (32.Khaled A.R. Kim K. Hofmeister R. Muegge K. Durum S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14476-14481Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that Bcl-2 can inhibit the Bax conformational change by direct interaction with Bax, since the two proteins appear to be in different subcellular locations when the conformational change occurs. Furthermore, Bcl-2/Bax interactions are not observed in immunoprecipitation experiments in the absence of nonionic detergents (13.Hsu Y.-T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). 2K. M. Murphy, U. N. Streips, and R. B. Lock, unpublished data. Our data demonstrate that overexpression of Bcl-2 does not sequester Bid to the membrane compartment, nor does it prevent Bid cleavage during Fas-induced apoptosis. Thus, Bcl-2 appears to function downstream of caspase-8 and Bid activation. It is possible, however, that Bcl-2 may inhibit activation of other caspases that are responsible for the Bax conformational change. These mechanisms are currently under investigation."

Here it is shown that cofactor F420H2-dependent reduction of 2-hydroxyphenazine as catalyzed by the membrane-bound enzyme is coupled to proton translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane, exhibiting a stoichiometry of 0.9 H+ translocated per two electrons transferred. The electrochemical proton gradient thereby generated was shown to drive ATP synthesis from ADP + Pi. The gene cluster encoding the F420H2 dehydrogenase ofM. mazei Gö1 comprises 12 genes that are referred to as fpoA, B, C, D,H, I, J, K,L, M, N, and O. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences revealed that the enzyme is closely related to proton translocating NADH dehydrogenases of respiratory chains from bacteria (NDH-1) and eukarya (complex I). Like the NADH-dependent enzymes, the F420H2 dehydrogenase is composed of three subcomplexes. The gene products FpoA, H, J, K, L, M, and N are highly hydrophobic and are homologous to subunits that form the membrane integral module of NDH-1. FpoB, C, D, and I have their counterparts in the amphipathic membrane-associated module of NDH-1. Homologues to the hydrophilic NADH-oxidizing input module are not present in M. mazei Gö1. Instead, the gene product FpoF may be responsible for F420H2 oxidation and may function as the electron input part. Thus, the F420H2 dehydrogenase from M. mazeiGö1 resembles eukaryotic and bacterial proton translocating NADH dehydrogenases in many ways. The enzyme from the methanogenic archaeon functions as a NDH-1/complex I homologue and is equipped with an alternative electron input unit for the oxidation of reduced cofactor F420 and a modified output module adopted to the reduction of methanophenazine.

The two electrons required for the reduction are derived from 7-mercaptoheptanoylthreonine phosphate, resulting in the formation of a heterodisulfide (CoB-S-S-CoM)1 of 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate (HS-CoM) and 7-mercaptoheptanoylthreonine phosphate (HS-CoB) (1.Thauer R. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 2377-2406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An energy-conserving step in the metabolism of methanogens is the reduction of CoB-S-S-CoM with either molecular hydrogen or reduced coenzyme F420. In recent years, the membrane-bound electron transfer of M. mazei Gö1 has been analyzed in detail, resulting in the discovery of two proton translocating systems referred to as H2:heterodisulfide oxidoreductase and F420H2:heterodisulfide oxidoreductase, respectively (2.Deppenmeier U. Lienard T. Gottschalk G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). During growth on methylated substrates, part of the methyl groups of the substrates is oxidized to CO2, and reducing equivalents are transferred to F420. The reduced cofactor (F420H2) is reoxidized by the above-mentioned membrane-bound electron transport system consisting of an F420H2 dehydrogenase and a heterodisulfide reductase. The transfer of electrons between the enzymes is most likely mediated by methanophenazine, a hydrophobic cofactor that has been isolated from the cytoplasmic membrane of M. mazeiGö1. The overall process has been shown to be competent in driving proton translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane (3.Deppenmeier U. Blaut M. Mahlmann A. Gottschalk G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9449-9453Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The resulting electrochemical proton gradient is the driving force for ATP synthesis from ADP + Pi catalyzed by an A1A0-type ATP synthase (2.Deppenmeier U. Lienard T. Gottschalk G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 4.Müller V. Ruppert C. Lemker T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The F420H2 dehydrogenase with a molecular mass of 115 kDa has been purified from M. mazei Gö1 and contains iron-sulfur clusters and FAD (5.Abken H.J. Deppenmeier U. FEMS Lett. 1997; 154: 231-237Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The isolated enzyme is very similar to the corresponding protein from Methanolobus tindarius (6.Haase P. Deppenmeier U. Blaut M. Gottschalk G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and is composed of five different subunits with molecular masses of 40, 37, 22, 20, and 17 kDa. A F420H2 dehydrogenase has also been purified form the sulfate-reducing archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus(7.Kunow K. Linder D. Stetter K.O. Thauer R.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this report the gene locus encoding the F420H2 dehydrogenase on the M. mazeigenome is described. Furthermore, it is shown that the corresponding enzyme is a novel proton pump contributing to the generation of the electrochemical proton gradient in the methanogenic organism. Washed inverted vesicles of M. mazei Gö1 (DSM 3647) were prepared according to Ide et al. (8.Ide T. Bäumer S. Deppenmeier U. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4076-4080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proton translocation, electron transport, and ATP synthesis were monitored as described previously (8.Ide T. Bäumer S. Deppenmeier U. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4076-4080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The isolation and reduction of F420 as well as the synthesis of 2-OH-phenazine was performed according to Abken et al. (9.Abken H.J. Tietze M. Brodersen J. Bäumer S. Beifuss U. Deppenmeier U. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2027-2032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The F420H2 dehydrogenase was purified as described previously (5.Abken H.J. Deppenmeier U. FEMS Lett. 1997; 154: 231-237Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The subunits were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Pall GmbH, Dreieich, Germany). N-terminal sequences were determined by Dr. B. Schmidt (Zentrum Biochemie, University of Göttingen) on an Applied Biosystems Procise Sequencer. The complete genomic sequence of M. mazei Gö1 was determined by a whole genome shotgun approach. More than 18,000 clones carrying inserts of approximately 2.5 kilobases in length from small insert libraries representative of the whole genome were sequenced from both ends usind LICOR IL 4200 and ABI PRISM 377 DNA sequencers. The generated sequence readings were assembled into contigs with the Prap software implemented in the STADEN software package. Protein sequence analysis was performed with the following internet servers: PredictProtein server; SignalP V1.1 World Wide Web Prediction Server, Center for Biological Sequence Analysis; and PSORT Prediction server. It was shown that electron transport from F420H2 to CoM-S-CoB as catalyzed by washed inverted vesicles from M. mazei Gö1 is coupled to proton translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane (3.Deppenmeier U. Blaut M. Mahlmann A. Gottschalk G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9449-9453Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). With the identification of methanophenazine as an electron carrier in the membrane the redox-driven proton translocation could be analyzed in more detail. It became evident that the key enzymes of the membrane-bound electron transfer systems were able to interact with 2-OH-phenazine, which is a water-soluble homologue of methanophenazine (9.Abken H.J. Tietze M. Brodersen J. Bäumer S. Beifuss U. Deppenmeier U. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2027-2032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reducing equivalents from F420H2 were transferred to 2-OH-phenazine by the membrane-bound F420H2 dehydrogenase. Furthermore, the heterodisulfide reductase present in the cytoplasmic membrane was able to use reduced 2-OH-phenazine as electron donor for the reduction of CoB-S-S-CoM (10.Bäumer S. Murakami E. Brodersen J. Gottschalk G. Ragsdale S.W. Deppenmeier U. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of 2-OH-phenazine as electron acceptor, it became evident that the F420H2 dehydrogenase is directly involved in the generation of an electrochemical proton gradient (Fig. 1). Concentrated vesicles were diluted with a sucrose/thiocyanate solution containing 200 nmol of F420H2 and were pulsed with 2-OH-phenazine under an atmosphere of molecular nitrogen. In the course of electron transport from F420H2 to 2-OH-phenazine a rapid alkalinization of the medium occurred that was due to proton movement into the lumen of the inverted vesicles. Thiocyanate was used as a permeant charge-compensating cation required to exchange for the ejected protons, thus maintaining the electroneutrality across the membrane. After consumption of F420H2, the energy conserving electron transport stopped leading to a decay of the generated ΔμH+ by passive diffusion of protons from the lumen of the inverted vesicles to the medium. This is indicated in the second reaction phase where a reacidification took place until the base line was reached again. After calibration of the instrument response with NaOH as an internal standard the extent of reversible alkalinization was used to calculate the H+/2e− ratio. As evident from Fig. 1(inset), the extent of H+ ejection was dependent on the amount of 2-OH-phenazine added. From the linear part of the reaction curve (0–7 nmol of 2-OH-phenazine/assay) a stoichiometry of 0.9 ± 0.2 H+/2e− was determined. Proton translocation was not observed when 2-OH-phenazine was replaced by ethanol or when F420 instead of F420H2 was added, indicating that proton transfer was specifically coupled to the F420H2-dependent 2-OH-phenazine reduction. In the presence of the protonophore SF 6847 the generation of a pH gradient was abolished, and a reversible alkalinization was prevented (Fig. 1). When the electron transfer from F420H2 to 2-OH-phenazine was analyzed the initial velocity of substrate conversion was 0.42 ± 0.03 μmol × min−1 × mg protein−1(Table I). After 1 min, the rate slowly decreased because of the depletion of reduced F420. The reaction was coupled to the phosphorylation of ADP as indicated by a rapid increase of the ATP content upon start of the reaction (Fig.2). The initial rate of ATP synthesis was 0.11 ± 0.03 μmol × min−1 × mg protein−1 resulting in an ATP/2e−stoichiometry of about 0.26 within the first minute of the reaction. In the absence of ADP, 2-OH-phenazine reduction slowed down to 0.3 ± 0.02 unit/mg protein (Table I), and ATP synthesis was not possible (Fig. 2). The ATP synthase inhibitor DCCD led to a strong inhibition of phosphorylation of ADP and resulted in a slight decrease of the electron transport rate (0.32 ± 0.04 unit/mg protein). SF 6847 abolished ATP synthesis (Fig. 2) because of the decay of ΔμH+. Inhibition of electron transfer in the presence of DCCD or in the absence of ADP was relieved by the addition of SF 6847 (Table I). The results of the experiments outlined are clearly in accordance with the chemiosmotic coupling mechanism of ATP synthesis. Furthermore, the effect of SF 6847, DCCD, and ADP on the rate of electron transport resembles the phenomenon of respiratory control. The low control ratio is explained by the fact that about 50% of the vesicles were uncoupled and catalyzed electron transfer without generating an electrochemical proton gradient (2.Deppenmeier U. Lienard T. Gottschalk G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).Table IEffect of ADP, DCCD, and SF 6847 on electron transfer rates from F420H2 to 2-OH-phenazineAdditionsElectron transport ratea1 μmol of F420H2oxidized or 1 μmol 2-OH-phenazine reduced per min and mg protein.μmol × min −1 × mg protein −1ADP0.42 ± 0.03No addition0.30 ± 0.02SF 68470.47 ± 0.02SF 6847 + ADP0.44 ± 0.05DCCD + ADP0.32 ± 0.04DCCD + SF 6847 + ADP0.42 ± 0.03The conditions were the same as those described in the legend to Fig.2.

The entire genome of M. mazei Gö1 is currently sequenced in the Genomic Laboratory Göttingen. In the course of the sequencing process the data were checked for the presence of regions coding for the known N-terminal amino acid sequences obtained from five subunits of the purified enzyme. Finally, one DNA fragment was identified that codes for the 40-, 22-, 20-, and 16-kDa subunits of the purified F420H2 dehydrogenase (Fig. 3). The proposed name for the gene locus is fpo forF420H2:phenazineoxidoreductase. The fragment comprises 12 genes that were designated fpoA, B, C, D,H, I, J, K, L,M, N, and O. Each gene is preceded by at least one putative ribosome binding site starting with the initiation codon ATG or GTG (fpoL) and is terminated by the stop codons TAA or TGA. Other putative open reading frames could not be identified in the direct neighborhood of the flanking genesfpoA and fpoO, respectively. Upstream offpoA is an AT-rich region, which contains potential archaeal consensus promoter sequences (Fig.4 A). At the opposite boundary a stem loop was found downstream of fpoO (Fig.4 B), followed by a T-rich region. The RNA duplex stability is −51 kJ/mol (11.Freier S.M. Kierzek R. Jaeger J.A. Sugimoto N. Caruthers M.H. Neilson T. Turner D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9373-9377Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar). Furthermore, two different repeats of a 9-bp sequence and a 10-bp sequence (TAAAGTGGCT and CTTTATTTT) were identified in this region (Fig. 4 B). These structures are similar to transcriptional termination sites of polypeptide-encoding genes from other archaea (12.Brown J.W. Daniels C.J. Reeve J.N. CRC Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1989; 16: 287-338Crossref Scopus (187) Google Scholar). All 12 structural genes are organized so compactly in the cluster that there is almost no intergenic space for promoter or terminator-like sequences. Therefore, the genesfpoA–O may represent one operon. Evidence for this assumption came from Northern blot analysis. A single 11-kilobase signal was obtained when RNA from methanol-grown cells was hybridized with a specific probe (not shown). The size of the transcript is in full accordance with the length of the predicted fpogenes.Figure 4Putative promoter (A) and terminator sequences (B) upstream and downstream of the fpo gene cluster.

The fifth subunit is encoded by the fpoFgene, which will be described below. Because the gene products of the remaining fpo genes were not found in the homogeneous protein preparation, it is most likely that only a subcomplex of the F420H2 dehydrogenase was purified and that the other subunits were lost during purification. However, the core enzyme composed of FpoB, C, D, F, and I showed catalytic activity with F420H2 as electron donor and several artificial dyes as electron acceptors (10.Bäumer S. Murakami E. Brodersen J. Gottschalk G. Ragsdale S.W. Deppenmeier U. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The deduced primary sequences of all predicted F420H2 dehydrogenase subunits from M. mazei Gö1 were compared with those of other organisms. Eleven polypeptides showed significant homologies to NADH:plastoquinone oxidoreductases from cyanobacteria or chloroplasts and to NADH:UQ oxidoreductases from mitochondria and bacteria (complex I, NDH-1). Alignments of the fpo gene products A–N indicated similarities of 42–71% and identities of 37–60% to the corresponding subunits of the above-mentioned enzyme complexes (TableII). With the exception ofnqo6 from Thermus thermophilus (13.Yano T. Chu S.S. Sled V.D. Ohnishi T. Yagi T. J. Biol.

On the other hand the fpo genes are arranged in the same order as bacterial NDH-1 genes. This fact prompted us to number the genes according to the nomenclature of the nuo operon fromEscherichia coli (Fig. 3).Table IIHomologies of deduced amino acid sequences of fpo genes from M. mazei Göl to corresponding gene products of NADH dehydrogenases from other organismsDeduced amino acid sequence from M. mazei GölHighest homology to deduced amino acid sequence fromIdentitySimilaritykDa%%fpoA14.1ndhC(Synechocystis PCC 6803)4356fpoB20.7nqo6 (T. thermophilus)5364fpoC18.3ndhJ(Nicotiana tabacum)3842fpoD42.5ndhH (Secale cereale)4863fpoH38.0ndh1(Plectonema boryanum)4355fpoI15.2nuoI (P. abyssi)4053fpoJ18.5ndh6 (P. boryanum)3951fpoK11.3ndhE(Synechocystis PCC 6803)5267fpoL72.3ndh7 (Pisum sativum)6071fpoM53.9ndh4(Artemia salina)4047fpoN52.7ndhB (Synechocystis PCC 6803)3750fpoO15.0fpoF38.4frhB (M. jannaschii)aPart of the F420-reducing hydrogenase.3848a Part of the F420-reducing hydrogenase. Open table in a new tab Hydropathy plots revealed that the deduced polypeptides fromfpoA, H, J, K,L, M, and N are membrane-integral components. The largest subunits are predicted to contain 14 (FpoM, N) to 16 (FpoL) transmembrane helices, and the smaller peptides FpoJ and FpoH are predicted to contain 2 and 8 membrane-spanning helices. Computer programs (PSORT Prediction/SignalP-Server) revealed that FpoA and FpoK may contain N-terminal signal peptides with cleavage sites at amino acid positions 38 and 23, respectively. If this prediction is correct, each of the processed polypeptides would comprise two transmembrane helices. In summary, the membrane integral part of the F420H2 dehydrogenase complex showed high similarities to the corresponding module of bacterial NDH-1 with respect to composition and homology of the amino acid sequences. In the bacterial nuo/nqo operons known so far the genes encoding hydrophobic subunits are clustered at the 3′ end of the operon with the exception of nuoA/nqo7, which is located at the very beginning of the operon. The same organization is given in thefpo gene cluster from M. mazei Gö1. It is important to note that the hydrophobic subunits of bacterial NDH-1 and of the F420H2 dehydrogenase have their counterparts in mitochondrially encoded complex I subunits from Eukarya (15.Finel M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 112-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Secondary structure prediction classifies the gene products FpoB, FpoC, FpoD, and FpoI as nonmembrane proteins. This is in agreement with the cellular localization of the homologous polypeptides from bacterial NDH-1 of Nuo BCDI from E. coli (16.Friedrich T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 134-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and eukaryotic complex I of PSST, 30k, 49k, TYKY from bovine heart (17.Walker J.E. Skehel J.M. Buchanan S.K. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 14-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These subunits comprise a module that connects the membrane-integral subcomplex to the NADH-oxidizing device (Fig. 3). It is most likely that FpoB, C, D, and I have a similar function in the F420H2dehydrogenase. In subunit FpoB and FpoI, binding motifs for up to three tetranuclear iron-sulfur centers are present that are invariably conserved in the bacterial and eukaryotic equivalents (TableIII). It has been suggested that these prosthetic groups mediate electron transport between the subcomplexes and play an important role in energy conversion of NDH-1 and complex I (18.Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 186-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar).Table IIIBinding motifs in the deduced amino acid sequences of the fpo genesSubunitPositions of conserved cysteine residues and binding sitesPutative typeFpoBC60C61 XXEX 60C125 X 29C155P[Fe4-S4]FpoIC43 XXC46 XXC49 XXXC53P[Fe4-S4]C83 XXC86 XXC89 XXXC93P[Fe4-S4]FpoOSCRXGXCSXCXXXKX 25C[Fe2-S2]FpoFC33 XXC36 XXC39 XXXC43P[Fe4-S4]C64 XXC67 XXC70 XXXC74P[Fe4-S4]F420H2 and FAD binding site Open table in a new tab The amino acid sequence derived from the open reading frame designatedfpoO contains motifs for the binding of one [Fe2-S2] cluster (Table III). The corresponding polypeptide has no counterpart in NDH-1 or complex I and shows no homologies to any known protein. This hydrophilic polypeptide was not copurified with the core enzyme, and its function is unknown. NADH is oxidized by the hydrophilic NADH dehydrogenase fragment of NDH-1 or complex I, which is composed of NuoF, G, and H (E. coli) or the 24-, 51-, and 75-kDa subunits (bovine heart) (16.Friedrich T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 134-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar,17.Walker J.E. Skehel J.M. Buchanan S.K. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 14-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Genes encoding these subunits are not present in thefpo gene cluster or anywhere else on the M. mazeichromosome, indicating that the input module is different and adjusted to the oxidation of F420H2 as electron donor of the F420H2 dehydrogenase. A suitable candidate for this function is the 37-kDa subunit of the purified core enzyme. The N-terminal sequence of this polypeptide was not found in the deduced amino acid sequences of the fpo gene cluster. However, a gene coding for the fifth subunit (37 kDa) of the purified enzyme was identified at a different location on the chromosome and was referred to as fpoF (F for F420). The deduced amino acid sequences shows motifs for two [Fe4-S4] clusters. It is homologous to the β subunit of F420-reducing hydrogenases and to subunits of the F420H2 dehydrogenase from M. tindarius (FfdB; Ref. 19.Westenberg D.J. Braune A. Ruppert C. Müller V. Herzberg C. Gottschalk G. Blaut M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 170: 389-398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and A. fulgidus(AF1833; Ref. 20.Klenk H.P. Clayton R.A. Tomb J.F. White O. Nelson K.A. Dodson R.J. Gwinn M. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Richardson D.L. Kerlavage A.R. Graham D.E. Kyrpides N.C. Fleischmann R.D. Quackenbusch J. Lee N.H. Sutton G.G. Gill S. Kirkness E.F. Dougherty B.A. McKenny K. Adams M.D. Loftus B. Venter J.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 364-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). In the latter organism the fpoF homologue gene AF1833 is part of the operon encoding the F420H2 dehydrogenase. Recently, the gene was overexpressed in E. coli, and the corresponding polypeptide was purified to homogeneity. The subunit contained nonheme iron, acid-labile sulfur, and FAD and was able to oxidize F420H2 when the artificial electron acceptor methylviologen was added. 2H. Brüggemann and U. Deppenmeier, unpublished results. Because AF1833 and FpoF are structurally equivalent and FpoF is part of the purified F420H2 dehydrogenase from M. mazei Gö1, it may function as electron input device of the enzyme. F420 is the central cytoplasmic electron carrier in the methanogen M. mazei Gö1. The cofactor is involved in the process of methanogenesis from H2 + CO2 and from methylated compounds such as methanol and methylamines. In the methylotrophic pathway of methane formation (21.Deppenmeier U. Müller V. Gottschalk G. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 165: 149-163Crossref Scopus (166) Google Scholar) three out of four methyl-groups are reduced to methane. The remaining methyl-moiety is oxidatized to CO2, and the resulting reducing equivalents are transferred to F420. The membrane-bound F420H2 dehydrogenase catalyzes the reoxidation of F420H2 and most likely transfers the electrons to the novel membrane-integral cofactor methanophenazine, which is a linear sesterterpenic ether of 2-OH-phenazine (2.Deppenmeier U. Lienard T. Gottschalk G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicate that the protein is part of the membrane-bound F420H2:heterodisulfide oxidoreductase, which is one of the major energy conserving systems ofM. mazei Gö1 (3.Deppenmeier U. Blaut M. Mahlmann A. Gottschalk G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9449-9453Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It was found that the electron transport from F420H2 to the heterodisulfide (CoM-S-S-CoB) is coupled to the transfer of 3–4 protons across the cytoplasmic membrane. Using 2-OH-phenazine as a water-soluble precursor of methanophenazine, it became evident that the overall electron transfer can be divided into two partial reactions catalyzed by the F420H2 dehydrogenase and the heterodisulfide reductase, respectively. F420H2+2­OH­phenazine→F420+dihydro­2­OH­phenazine(ΔG′=−20.2 kJ/mol) dihydro­2­OH­phenazine+CoM­S­S­CoB→2­OH­phenazine+HS­CoM+HS­CoB(ΔG0=−10.6 kJ/mol) REACTIONS 1 AND 2Very recently, it was shown that the dihydrophenazine-dependent heterodisulfide reduction (Reaction 2) is coupled to proton translocation exhibiting a stoichiometry of 2H+/2e− (8.Ide T. Bäumer S. Deppenmeier U. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4076-4080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The experiments in this publication show that in the first partial reaction catalyzed by the F420H2 dehydrogenase, a maximum of 0.9 ± 0.2 protons/two electrons were translocated. Taking into account that about 50% of the vesicles are uncoupled (2.Deppenmeier U. Lienard T. Gottschalk G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), a H+/2e− ratio of about 2.0 could be considered. Then the H+/2e− stoichiometries of the partial reactions would add up to 4 and support the value of 3–4 H+/2e− translocated in the overall electron transport from F420H2 to heterodisulfide (3.Deppenmeier U. Blaut M. Mahlmann A. Gottschalk G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9449-9453Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In summary, the data clearly indicate that the F420H2 dehydrogenase is a redox-driven proton pump showing a maximal energetic efficiency of about 2 H+translocated per 2e− transported. The F420H2 dehydrogenase from M. mazeiGö1 resembles eukaryotic complex I and bacterial NDH-1 in many ways: 1) The membrane-bound, flavin and iron-sulfur containing enzymes are characterized by a complex subunit composition. 2) The electron donors F420H2 and NADH are both reversible hydride donors with comparable mid-point potentials. 3) Both enzymes take advantage of small hydrophobic nonproteinous electron acceptors namely quinones in case of the NADH dehydrogenase and methanophenazine in case of F420H2 dehydrogenase. The electron acceptors are highly hydrophobic and can diffuse within the cytoplasmic membrane. Several experimental data indicate that semiquinone radicals are produced in the course of the NADH dehydrogenase reaction (22.Ohnishi T. Sled V.D. Yano T. Yagi T. Burbaev D.S. Viogradov A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The same could be true for methanophenazine because the direct precursor 2-OH-phenazine is also reduced in two 1e− transfer reactions forming a semiphenazine radical as an intermediate in solution (23.Mann S. Arch. Mikrobiol. 1970; 71: 304-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). 4) It was shown that mitochondrial and bacterial NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductases as well as the F420H2 dehydrogenase are inhibited by diphenyleneiodonium chloride (24.Brodersen J. Bäumer S. Abken H.J. Gottschalk G. Deppenmeier U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 25.Majander A. Finel M. Wikström M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21037-21042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 5) The redox-reaction catalyzed by the proteins is coupled to proton translocation. It is shown in this publication that the physiological characteristics of the F420H2 dehydrogenase are supported by genetic data. The deduced primary sequences of the M. mazeiGö1 F420H2 dehydrogenase subunits were compared with those of other organisms and with those of some phylogenetically related enzymes. For 11 proteins encoded byfpoA to fpoN related counterparts exist in bacterial NDH-1 and mitochondrial complex I. The organization of the genes resembles operons encoding the proton-translocating NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductases (Ndh/Nqo) from several bacteria such asE. coli, T. thermophilus, and Rhodobacter capsulatus (13.Yano T.

Acta. 1998; 1364: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The bacterial enzyme is composed of 13 or 14 different subunits (28.Yagi T. Yano T. Di Bernardo S. Matsuno-Yagi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) that form the following modules (nomenclature according to E. coli) 1) The hydrophilic NADH dehydrogenase fragment composed of NuoE, F, and G catalyzes the oxidation of NADH. 2) NuoA, H, J, K, L, M, and N form the membrane-integral module and are involved in quinone reduction and proton-translocation. 3) NuoB, C, D, and I connect the above-mentioned subunits and catalyze electron transfer from module 1 to module 3 (29.Friedrich T. Weiss H.J. Theor. Biol. 1997; 187: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The detailed reaction mechanism of the enzyme is unknown. Several intrinsic redox components were detected that are involved in NADH-dependent quinone reduction (18.Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 186-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The NuoE, F, and G module contains most of the redox-active prosthetic groups (16.Friedrich T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 134-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). One noncovalently bound FMN and at least five EPR detectable iron-sulfur clusters form a long electron transfer chain guiding electron transfer from NADH to the [Fe4-S4] cluster N2 that is part of the amphipathic connecting fragment NuoB, C, D, and I. It is still a matter of debate whether this cluster is bound to NuoB or NuoI. However, it is well established that reduced N2 successively injects single electrons into the membraneous subcomplex, thereby activating a serial array of quinones that are directly involved in H+ translocation (30.Dutton P.L Moser C.C. Sled V. Daldal F. Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1364: 245-257Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The native structure of the F420H2dehydrogenase is still unknown. However, the primary sequence informations, operon structure, and the homology to bacterial NDH-1 allow composition of a tentative model (Fig.5). The gene product FpoF forms the input module that oxidizes F420H2 by hydride transfer. FAD present in this subunit catalyzes a two-electron/one-electron switch to reduce the [Fe4-S4] clusters. It is still an open question whether the gene product of fpoOis also part of the input module. This polypeptide is predicted to be hydrophilic and probably contains [Fe2-S2]-clusters. On the other hand this polypeptide was not copurified with the core enzyme, indicating that it is not essential for catalytic activity. From the F420H2-oxidizing device the electrons are then channeled to the amphipathic connecting fragment composed of FpoB, C, D, and I, which is highly homologous to the corresponding module of NDH-1. Because all iron-sulfur signatures are conserved in FpoB and FpoI, it is reasonable to assume that a FeS-cluster comparable with N2 is present in one of these subunits. In analogy to NDH-1 and complex I cluster N2 should transfer electrons to the membrane integral module composed of FpoA, H, J, K, L, M, and N. In spite of the fact that the composition of the membraneous part of the F420H2 dehydrogenase and NDH-1 is identical, the further electron transport pathway of the F420H2-dependent enzyme is difficult to predict because methanogenic archaea do not contain quinones. Therefore, the reaction mechanism of the F420H2 dehydrogenase must be different at this point and must involve the electron carrier methanophenazine. The mid-point potential of 2-OH -phenazine, which is a potential precursor of methanophenazine, was determined to be −255 mV (23.Mann S. Arch. Mikrobiol. 1970; 71: 304-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). With the assumption that the redox potential of methanophenazine is similar, the change of free energy (ΔG o′) coupled to the F420H2-dependent methanophenazine reduction is only −20.2 kJ/mol compared with a ΔG o′ of −80.9 kJ/mol for the NADH-dependent reduction of ubiquinone. These thermodynamic facts are reflected by the coupling efficiencies of the enzymes because the maximal H+/2e− ratio of the F420H2 dehydrogenase is 1.8, in contrast to NDH-1/complex I, which translocates four or even more protons across the membrane per reaction cycle (30.Dutton P.L Moser C.C. Sled V. Daldal F. Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1364: 245-257Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Despite the aforementioned differences, the F420H2 dehydrogenase represents a NDH-1 homologue in the methanogenic archaeon M. mazei Gö1, which is equipped with an alternative input device and a modified proton translocating machinery. Further analysis of the enzyme may contribute to the understanding also of the reaction mechanism of NADH dehydrogenases. Interestingly, fpo-like gene clusters were not detected in the methanogenic archaea Methanococcus jannaschii (31.Bult C. White J.O. Olsen G.J. Zhou L. Fleischmann R.D. Sutton G.G.J. Blake A.

The functional properties of uPA and the significance of its various domains for chemotactic activity were analyzed using human airway smooth muscle cells (hAWSMC). The wild-type uPA (r-uPAwt), inactive urokinase with single mutation (His204 to Gln) (r-uPAH/Q), urokinase with mutation of His204to Gln together with a deletion of growth factor-like domain (r-uPAH/Q-GFD), the catalytic domain of urokinase (r-uPALMW), and its kringle domain (r-KD) were expressed inEscherichia coli. We demonstrate that glycosylated uPA, r-uPAwt, r-uPAH/Q, and r-uPAH/Q-GFD elicited similar chemotactic effects. Half-maximal chemotaxis (EC50) were apparent at approximately 2 nm with all the uPA variants. The kringle domain induced cell migration with an EC50 of about 6 nm, whereas the denaturated r-KD and r-uPALMW were without effect. R-uPAwt-induced chemotaxis was dependent on an association with uPAR and a uPA-kringle domain-binding site, determined using a monoclonal uPAR antibody to prevent the uPA-uPAR interaction, and a monoclonal antibody to the uPA-kringle domain. The binding of iodinated r-uPAwt with hAWSMC was due to interaction with a high affinity binding site on the uPAR, and a lower affinity binding site on an unidentified cell surface target, which was mediated exclusively through the kringle domain of urokinase. Specific binding of r-uPAH/Q-GFD to hAWSMC involved an interaction with a single site whose characteristics were similar to those of the low affinity site of r-uPAwt binding to hAWSMC. uPAR-deficient HEK 293 cells specifically bound r-uPAwt and r-uPAH/Q-GFD via a single, similar type of binding site. These cells migrated when stimulated by r-uPAH/Q-GFD and uPAwt, but not r-uPALMW. HEK 293 cells transfected with the uPAR cDNA expressed two classes of sites that bound r-uPAwt; however, only a single site was responsible for the binding of r-uPAH/Q-GFD. Together, these findings indicate that uPA-induced chemotaxis is dependent on the binding of the uPA-kringle to the membrane surface of cells and the association of uPA with uPAR.

Of the two types of plasminogen activators expressed by tissues, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA1 or urokinase) and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), uPA rather than tPA promotes cell migration (5.Busso N.

In addition to interacting with uPA, the significance of uPAR in chemotaxis also appears dependent upon interaction with integrins (12.Chapman H.A. Curr. Opin.

The urokinase/uPAR system also participates in the chemotaxis initiated by growth factors which activate tyrosine kinase receptors, as well as several chemoattractant molecules such as formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (14.Stepanova V.

Urokinase is secreted by many cell types, as a single chain polypeptide that possesses little or no proteolytic activity (18.Petersen L.C. Lund L.R. Nielsen L.S. Dano K. Skriver L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11189-11195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is composed of three structurally independent domains, a proteolytic domain (PD), a kringle domain (KD), and a growth factor-like domain (GFD). The active serine protease is generated from a single cleavage between Lys158 and Ile159 (18.Petersen L.C. Lund L.R. Nielsen L.S. Dano K. Skriver L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11189-11195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and further plasminolysis generates the two-chain low molecular weight form uPALMW, commencing at Lys136 and consisting of mainly PD (19.Barlow G.H. Francis C.W. Marder V.J. Thromb. Res. 1981; 23: 541-547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and amino-terminal fragment (ATF) (20.Mazar A.P. Buko A. Petros A. Barnathan E.S. Henkin J. Fibrinolysis. 1992; 6 Suppl. 1: 49-55Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Urokinase PA and the ATF have been shown to bind with similar high affinity to uPAR/CD87 via the GFD (9.Rabbani S.A. Mazar A.P. Bernier S.M. Haq M. Bolivar I. Henkin J. Goltzman D. J. Biol.

Several studies indicate that the ability of uPA to initiate a chemotactic response is dependent only on its proteolytic activity (29.Wang W. Chen H.J. Gieddi K.N. Schwartz A. Cannon P.J. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1095-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 30.Jackson C.L. Reidy M.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 667: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), implicating a direct or plasmin-mediated activation, or release of the mitogenic growth factors-basic fibroblast growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor, and VEGF− from the extracellular matrix (31.Saksela O.

Others have demonstrated that uPA-induced cell migration is dependent on its proteolytic activity, interaction with uPAR, as well as interactions with low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein/α2-macroglobulin receptor (LRP/α2-MR) or very low density lipoprotein receptor (34.Okada S.S.

Haemost. 1997; 78: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Together these studies indicate that signal transduction pathways utilized by uPA in initiating chemotaxis exhibit marked diversity depending upon cell type. The importance of uPA in cell migration and tissue remodeling was recently demonstrated in knockout mice (36.Carmeliet P. Moons L. Herbert J.M. Crawley J. Lupu F. Lijnen R. Collen D. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 829-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), where there was marked reduction in the size of the neointima which forms after intra-vessel injury in the uPA-deficient mice, when compared with tPA-deficient and normal animals. In contrast, when mice deficient in uPAR were similarly injured neointima size was unaffected (37.Carmeliet P. Moons L. Dewerchin M. Rosenberg S. Herbert J.M. Lupu F. Collen D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Together these observations suggest that mechanisms, distinct or additional to uPA/uPAR interaction might mediate processes of the uPA-dependent tissue remodeling. Since uPAR is attached to the cell membrane via glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor and lacks transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions, alone it is not capable of initiating a chemotactic signal. An obligatory partner of yet unknown nature is probably required for uPAR to act as a signaling receptor (13.Blasi F. APMIS. 1999; 107: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 22.Resnati M. Guttinger M. Valcamonica S. Sidenius N. Blasi F. Fazioli F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1572-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), that can be activated either by a uPAR fragment (38.Fazioli F. Resnati M. Sidenius N. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7279-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) or following binding of uPA. Such an adaptor might be integrins, which can interact directly with uPAR and promote cell adhesiveness and chemotaxis (39.Gyetko M.R. Sitrin R.G. Fuller J.A. Todd 3 rd, R.F. Petty H.R.

Most investigating uPA-dependent chemotaxis has utilized full-length uPA, DFP-inactivated uPA, or its ATF. However, the ATF includes the growth factor-like and kringle domains, which behave as independently folded domains (45.Novokhatny V. Medved L. Mazar A. Marcotte P. Henkin J. Ingham K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3878-3885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Urokinase PA-kringle is highly homologous to the kringle structure-containing fragments of blood plasma proteins, which affect cell motility and/or proliferation (46.Ji W.-R. Barrientos L.G. Llinas M. Gray H. Villarreal X. DeFord M.E. Castellino F.J. Kramer R.A. Trail P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 414-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar,47.Cao Y. Ji R.W.

Despite these observations, the precise mechanism mediating the uPA-dependent effects on cell migration and the impact of the different domains of uPA on cell migration remain unclear. To elucidate the role of uPA structural domains in cell migration, we have constructed and produced recombinant uPA forms deficient in the GFD, as well as the individual domains of urokinase. Recently we reported that a form of uPA lacking proteolytic activity and the growth factor-like domain is capable of inducing cell migration to a similar extent as uPA. It exhibited the atypical binding of urokinase, which was unrelated to any interaction with uPAR via GFD (48.Poliakov A.A. Mukhina S.A. Traktouev D.O. Bibilashvily R. Sh Gursky Y.G. Minashkin M.M. Stepanova V.V. Tkachuk V.A. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1999; 19: 939-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Here we report that besides the growth factor-like domain, which interacts with uPAR, the kringle domain of urokinase can also be involved in the induction of cell chemotaxis by uPA. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum, and LipofectinTM were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.. Chromogenic substrate S-2444 was obtained from Chromogenix, Mölndal, Sweden. Glycosylated high molecular weight urokinase purified from urine (glycosylated uPA) was from Medac, Hamburg, Germany, and tPA (Actilyse) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. A mouse monoclonal antibody clone 3 (R-3-01) which reacts with domain I of human uPAR was from Monozyme, Denmark. The goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and chemiluminescent substrate “Super Signal Substrate” were from Pierce. Plasminogen, a mouse IgG, and two different murine monoclonal antibodies of the IgG1 subtype (UIG-1 and UNG-5) raised against human urinary uPA (49.Kratasyuk G.A. Jakubov L.Z. Sinitsyn V.V.

An anti-uPA mAb UIG-1 detected high and low molecular forms of uPA by Western blots. An anti-uPA mAb UNG-5 detected urokinase forms containing the kringle domain, (specifically, glycosylated uPA, r-uPAwt, r-uPAH/Q, r-uPAH/Q-GFD, and r-KD); it does not interact with r-uPALMW, lacking the kringle domain, tPA, and plasminogen. UNG-5 did not interact with denaturated r-KD, uPAwt, and r-uPAH/Q-GFD. Recombinant uPA with wild-type structure (r-uPAwt), proteolytically inactive urokinase with substitution of His204 in active center for Gln (r-uPAH/Q), and proteolytically inactive urokinase with deletion of NH2-terminal 1–43 amino acids called “growth factor-like domains” (r-uPAH/Q-GFD) were expressed inEscherichia coli and purified as described previously (14.Stepanova V. Bobik A. Bibilashvily R. Belogurov A. Rybalkin I. Domogatsky S. Little P.J. Goncharova E. Tkachuk V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 417-474Google Scholar,48.Poliakov A.A. Mukhina S.A. Traktouev D.O.

Two-chain low molecular weight urokinase with the catalytic domain r-uPALMW was prepared by proteolytic cleavage of r-uPAwt by plasmin, followed by purification with affinity chromatography, using monoclonal antibody against urokinase catalytic domain coupled to CNBr-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The recombinant kringle domain (r-KD) was made in E. coli as follows. The region of uPA cDNA corresponding to amino acids 42–210 (50.Riccio A. Grimaldi G. Verde P. Sebastio G. Boast S. Blasi F.

Bio/Technology. 1985; 3: 923-929Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar) was amplified using primers: M3, 5′-CTGTGATCTAGATAAGTCAAAAACCTGCTATGAGGG-3′, and M7, 5′-AGCACTGTGTGGCGCTGATCACCCAGCAAGGGCTG-3′. Primer M3 was designed to introduce an XbaI site (underlined) between GFD and KD of uPA without changing the amino acid sequence. The PCR product was digested with XbaI andEcoRI enzymes, generating a fragment coding urokinase amino acids 42–166. The expression vector was constructed by modifying a pTZ19 plasmid between HindIII and XbaI sites. This modification was done using a synthetic fragment containing a new translation initiation region and coding for the first 5 amino acids (MKSTL). This plasmid allowed the cloning of coding inserts between theXbaI and BamHI sites. TheXbaI-EcoRI fragment of uPA and theEcoRI and BamHI ending synthetic duplex: 5′-AATTCACCACCCTGCACCATCACCATCACCATTAATAG-3′; 3′-GTGGTGGGACGTGGTAGTGGTAGTGGTAATTATCCTAG-5′ were ligated between the XbaI and BamHI sites; the duplex sequence contains a hexahistidine tag and stop codon after theEcoRI site. The structure of the resulting construct was confirmed by sequencing. The cloning procedures outlined above resulted in a pKR-his6 plasmid coding for a polypeptide identical to r-uPAwt amino acids 43–166 as shown:MKSTLEIDKSKTCYEGNGHFYRGKASTDTMGRPCLPWNSATVLQQTYHAHRSDA- LQLGLGKHNYCRNPDNRRRPWCYVQVGLKPLVKECMVHDCADGK- KPSSPPEELKFQCGQKTLRP RF KIIGGEFTTLHHHHHH. The non-urokinase amino acids acquired from the vector are underlined. E. coli strain JM109 was transformed by the resulting pKR-his6 plasmid. Purification of r-KD was carried out as follows: inclusion bodies were isolated and the proteins denatured in buffer containing 6 m guanidine chloride. Subsequent reconstitution was carried out by gradually removing the denaturing agents while maintaining appropriate redox conditions with a glutathione-containing buffer (52.Marston F.A.O. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). The primary structure of r-KD allowed us to use nickel-chelate affinity chromatography for its initial purification. Subsequent purification to homogeneity was achieved by affinity chromatography on Sepharose coupled with the monoclonal antibody UNG-5. Then the kringle polypeptide was treated with thrombin, to cleave the peptide bond (Arg156-Phe157) in urokinase (53.Ichinose A. Fujikawa K. Suyama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3486-3489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (shown in bold); affinity chromatography using anti-kringle mAb removed the hexahistidine tag, any uncleaved peptides and thrombin. The resulting purified r-KD corresponded to urokinase amino acids Glu43-Arg156. The homogeneity of recombinant urokinase forms was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using monoclonal antibodies directed against the urokinase catalytic and kringle domains. The amidolytic activities of the glycosylated uPA and recombinant uPA forms were determined using the chromogenic urokinase substrate S-2444, as described previously (54.Stepanova V. Mukhina S.

The proteolytic activities of glycosylated uPA, r-uPAwt, and r-uPALMW were ∼5000 units/nmol; the other urokinase forms with substitution of His204 in active center for Gln (r-uPAH/Q and r-uPAH/Q-GFD) as well as r-KD were proteolytically inactive. R-uPAwt and r-uPAH/Q coupled to CNBr-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) specifically precipitated uPAR from cell lysates with similar efficiency, while r-uPAH/Q-GFD and r-uPALMW did not. This was performed as described previously (46.Ji W.-R. Barrientos L.G. Llinas M. Gray H. Villarreal X. DeFord M.E. Castellino F.J. Kramer R.A. Trail P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The reduced r-KD was alkylated by the addition of 0.25 m iodoacetamide for 1 h at 4 °C and then dialyzed against PBS. Both the denatured r-KD and the intact r-KD were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-kringle mAb UNG-5. Human airway smooth muscle cells (hAWSMC) were isolated from trachea and characterized as previously described (55.Panettieri R.A. Murray R.K. DePalo L.R. Yadvish P.A. Kotlikoff M.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C329-C355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney cells HEK 293 were from Cardiology Research Center Cell Collection, Moscow. The cell lines were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The XbaI-EcoRI fragment from pB SK-(uPAR) plasmid containing human uPAR-cDNA (GenBank accession number X51675), was ligated into pUC19 (New England Biolabs) producing an intermediate plasmid pUC-uPAR. Then theHindIII-EcoRI fragment from pUC-uPAR was inserted into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). The resultant plasmid pcDNA-uPAR transfected into HEK 293 cells using Lipofectin, according to the manufacturers protocol. Two days later the cells were plated onto 96-well plates for clone selection. The transfected cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum containing 1.5 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 25 days and G418-resistant clones were analyzed. Recombinant-uPAR expressed by these HEK 293 cells specifically bound recombinant uPAwt, assessed using an affinity uPAR precipitation method from cell lysates and immobilized r-uPAwt. Cells HEK 293 transfected by plasmid pcDNA3-anti-βGAL bearing a 3-kilobase fragment of E. coli β-galactosydase gene inserted in the antisense orientation (HEK-control cells) were used as controls. Cells were scraped into 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.2), containing 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After incubation for 20 min at 4 °C, the suspension was centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The proteins in the supernatant were mixed with SDS sample buffer and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE/Western blotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was immersed overnight at 4 °C in PBS containing 1% casein, 0.05% Tween 20, and 1 μg/ml anti-uPAR mAb (Monozyme). After multiple washings the membranes were incubated with a goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and visualized using the chemiluminescent substrate “Super Signal Substrate.” Migration of hAWSMC was determined as described previously, using a micro-Boyden chamber (14.Stepanova V. Bobik A. Bibilashvily R. Belogurov A. Rybalkin I. Domogatsky S. Little P.J. Goncharova E. Tkachuk V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 417-474Google Scholar). Briefly, to determine the role of uPAR in uPA-induced cell migration, a hAWSMC cell suspension in DMEM supplemented with 0.1% BSA was preincubated with the anti-uPAR mAb (50 μg/ml) or a mouse Ig (50 μg/ml) for 1 h prior to seeding the cells into the upper wells of the Boyden chamber. When the role of the urokinase-kringle domain in uPA-induced cell migration was to be assessed, r-uPAwt, r-uPAH/Q-GFD, or r-KD and the anti-kringle mAb UNG-5 (20 μg/ml) or with total mouse Ig (20 μg/ml) were preincubated for 1 h prior to placement into the lower wells. HEK cell suspension was prepared in DMEM supplemented with 1% BSA. The extent of cell migration was evaluated after incubation for 3 h at 37 °C in the CO2 incubator. Data are presented as peak area on scanned fields with stained cells and expressed as percentage of cells that migrate across a filter compared with control chemotaxis. Comparisons between cell migration under the different conditions were analyzed using Student's t test. A p < 0.05 value was considered statistically significant. All results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Urokinase constructs (60 μg) were iodinated with 1 mCi of Na125I and 0.1 mg of IODO-GEN (Pierce) for 8 min at room temperature and the reaction was terminated with excessl-tyrosine. Purification of iodinated peptides was carried out by chromatography on PD-10 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with PBS. Iodinated peptides could be precipitated (95–98%) by trichloroacetic acid and had specific activities from 3.0 to 4.0 × 105 cpm/pmol. Binding studies with the iodinated peptides were carrie"
https://openalex.org/W2049146226,"RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, NS5B protein, catalyzes replication of viral genomic RNA, which presumably initiates from the 3'-end. We have previously shown that NS5B can utilize the 3'-end 98-nucleotide (nt) X region of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome as a minimal authentic template. In this study, we used this RNA to characterize the mechanism of RNA synthesis by the recombinant NS5B. We first showed that NS5B formed a complex with the 3'-end of HCV RNA by binding to both the poly(U-U/C)-rich and X regions of the 3'-untranslated region as well as part of the NS5B-coding sequences. Within the X region, NS5B bound stem II and the single-stranded region connecting stem-loops I and II. Truncation of 40 nt or more from the 3'-end of the X region abolished its template activity, whereas X RNA lacking 35 nt or less from the 3'-end retained template activity, consistent with the NS5B-binding site mapped. Furthermore, NS5B initiated RNA synthesis from a specific site within the single-stranded loop I. All of the RNA templates that have a double-stranded stem at the 3'-end had the same RNA initiation site. However, the addition of single-stranded nucleotides to the 3'-end of X RNA or removal of double-stranded structure in stem I generated RNA products of template size. These results indicate that HCV NS5B initiates RNA synthesis from a single-stranded region closest to the 3'-end of the X region. These results have implications for the mechanism of HCV RNA replication and the nature of HCV RNA templates in the infected cells."

These studies pave the way for more detailed analysis of the possible functions of the mammalian subunits of pol δ. proliferating cell nuclear antigen polymerase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis fast protein liquid chromatography DNA polymerase δ (pol δ) is the key polymerase that is involved in the replication of chromosomal DNA in eukaryotic cells. Studies of the in vitro replication of SV40 DNA have established that pol δ plays a central role in mammalian DNA replication (1.Waga S. Bauer G. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10923-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA),1 the molecular sliding clamp of pol δ, is a processivity factor for pol δ and ε (2.Kuriyan J. O'Donnell M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 234: 915-925Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar). PCNA was first identified as an activating factor for pol δ (3.Lee M.Y.W.T. Tan C, -K. Downey K.M. So A.G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1906-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar,4.Tan C.K. Castillo C. So A.G. Downey K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12310-12316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is essential for replicative DNA synthesis. Several other factors have been identified as being required for SV40 DNA replication. Replication factor C (also known as activator-1) binds to the primer-template terminus, following which it recruits PCNA and then pol δ (5.Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 6.Lee S.H. Kwong A.D. Pan Z.Q. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 594-602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) onto the DNA template. Replication Protein A, the single stranded DNA-binding protein, is involved in both initiation and elongation and also stimulates pol δ activity when replication factor C and PCNA are present (7.Kenny M.K. Schlegel U. Furneaux H. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265 (7000): 7693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Lee S.H. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5672-5676Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The current view of DNA replication at the replication fork is that the pol δ complex is responsible for synthesis of the leading strand and that pol δ also participates in synthesis of the lagging strand (1.Waga S. Bauer G. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10923-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA polymerase α/primase is primarily involved in the synthesis of RNA primers plus short stretches of DNA primers on the lagging strand, and the actual elongation of the primers is performed by DNA polymerase δ in a process that requires “polymerase switching” (9.Tsuimoto T. Melendy T. Stillman B. Nature. 1990; 346: 435-539Google Scholar). Additional proteins, including topoisomerase and helicase activities, are also involved in the movement of the replication fork (1.Waga S. Bauer G. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10923-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian pol δ has been rigorously isolated by conventional methods as a heterodimer consisting of two subunits, p125 and p50 (3.Lee M.Y.W.T. Tan C, -K. Downey K.M. So A.G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1906-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The subunit structure of pol δ has been the focus of recent investigations in yeast, and these have led to the identification of additional subunits. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, pol δ is believed to consist of at least four subunits: a large catalytic subunit (Pol3) and three smaller subunits (Cdc1, Cdc27, and Cdm1) (10.Zuo S. Gibbs E. Kelven Z.

Pol δ purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is composed of three subunits: Pol3p, Pol31p/Hys2, and Pol32p (12.Burgers P.M.J. Gerik K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19756-19762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 13.Gerik K.J. Li X. Pautz A. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3493-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The pol δ core purified from calf thymus consists of two subunits: p125 and p50 (3.Lee M.Y.W.T. Tan C, -K. Downey K.M. So A.G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1906-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, we have found that recombinant p125 catalytic subunit alone can only be stimulated by PCNA by 2-fold at most, while the overexpressed p125/p50 heterodimer is stimulated much less than pol δ purified by immunoaffinity chromatography (15.Wu S. Zhang P. Zeng X. Zhang S. Mo J. Li B. Lee M.Y.W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9561-9569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 16.Sun Y. Jiang Y. Zhang P. Zhang S. Zhou Y.

These findings suggest that additional factor(s) which may be removed during protein purification are required for a full PCNA response in our assay. This is consistent with the hypothesis that mammalian pol δ may also contain additional subunits. Using the proteomics approach, by peptide sequencing of polypeptides associated with the core pol δ in highly purified preparations isolated by p125 immunoaffinity chromatography, we have previously identified a 68-kDa polypeptide that is encoded by KIAA0039 and which is associated with the pol δ core. The p68 polypeptide is the third subunit of mammalian pol δ (17.Zhang P. Mo J. Perez A. Leon A. Liu L. Mazloum N. Xu H. Lee M.Y.W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26647-26653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Using a combination of proteomic approaches and GenBank searches, we have identified a novel subunit of pol δ that is the mammalian homologue of Cdm1, which in S. pombe is the fourth subunit of pol δ. Mammalian pol δ may thus consist of at least four subunits. cDNA AA402118 was obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD). Calf thymus tissue was obtained from Animal Technologies (Tyler, TX). Q-Sepharose, SP-Sepharose, heparin-Sepharose, Mono Q columns, and Mono S columns were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Piscataway, NJ). The immunoaffinity purification was performed as described previously by Jiang et al. (18.Jiang Y.-Q Zhang S.J. Wu S.M. Lee M.Y.W.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The following buffers were used: lysis buffer consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.25 m sucrose, 5% glycerol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mg/ml bacitracin, 10 mm benzamidine. TGEED buffer consisted of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol. KGEED buffer consisted of 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.5 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol. All steps were carried out at 0–4 °C. Pol δ activity was assayed using poly(dA)/oligo(dT) as a template (19.Zhang P. Zhang S.J. Zhang Z. Woessner Jr., J.F. Lee M.Y.W.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10703-10712Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Eight hundred grams of frozen calf thymus tissue in 4 liters of lysis buffer were homogenized in a Waring blender. The suspension was centrifuged at 5,000 rpm at 4 °C for 1 h and filtered through glass wool. The supernatant was mixed with 1.5 liters of DE52-cellulose equilibrated with TGEED buffer and stirred for 30 min. The mixture then was filtered through a Buchner funnel. The DE52-cellulose was washed with TGEED and the pol δ activity was stripped off with 20% ammonium sulfate in TGEED buffer. The 3.5 liters of DE52-cellulose fraction were precipitated by the addition of 320 g/liter of ammonium sulfate. The suspension was stirred for 30 min, kept on ice for an additional 30 min, and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 45 min. The precipitate was resuspended in TGEED and dialyzed against TGEED buffer containing 50 mm NaCl with two changes and applied on to a 70-ml Q-Sepharose column. The bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 50–750 mm NaCl in TGEED. The peak fractions containing pol δ activity were pooled and dialyzed against KGEED buffer containing 25 mm KCl. The Q-Sepharose fraction was loaded on to a 50-ml SP-Sepharose column. Pol δ was eluted with a linear gradient of 25–650 mm KCl in KGEED. The fractions containing enzyme activity were pooled and applied to a 10-ml Mono Q column, which was equilibrated with TGEED buffer containing 25 mm NaCl. The column was washed with 40 ml of TGEED buffer containing 25 mm NaCl. The activity was eluted with a gradient of 25–650 mm NaCl in 100 ml of TGEED at a flow rate 0.4 ml/min. The Mono Q fractions were pooled and dialyzed against TGEED buffer containing 25 mm NaCl and applied to a 5-ml heparin-Sepharose column. The column was washed with 2 column volume of TGEED containing 25 mm NaCl and eluted with a 50-ml gradient of 25–750 mm NaCl in TGEED at a flow rate 0.5 ml/min. The heparin-Sepharose fraction (17 ml) was dialyzed against two changes of KGEED buffer containing 50 mm KCl and loaded onto a 1-ml Mono S column equilibrated with KGEED buffer. The column was washed with 5 ml of KGEED buffer and then eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient of KGEED buffer from 50 to 700 mm KCl. The active fractions were combined and dialyzed against TGEED buffer until the conductivity reached that of TGEED containing 50 mm NaCl. The fraction was applied to a Source Q15 column. The enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of 50–650 mm NaCl in TGEED. The fractions with enzyme activity were pooled (3.0 ml) and concentrated to 270 μl using Centricon 30 (30,000 MW cutoff, Amicon). The concentrated enzyme (270 μl) was chromatographed on a FPLC Superdex 200 column equilibrated with TGEED buffer containing 150 mm NaCl. Fractions above 50% of the maximum peak of activity were pooled. Polypeptide bands excised from a Coomassie Blue-stained gel were used for protein sequence analysis by the Harvard Microchemistry Facility using a microcapillary reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography nano-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (μLC-MS-MS) on a Finnigan LCQ quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. Peptide rabbit polyclonal antibodies against p12/hCdm1 and p68 were generated from a commercial source (SynPep, Dublin, CA) and purified by a peptide affinity column made from the same peptide antigen. For p12, the peptide contains amino acid residues 77 to 94 of p12 (H2N-GLEPPPEVWQVLKYHPGD-COOH). For p68 (encoded by KIAA0039) the 19-amino acid peptide from near the extreme N terminus of p68 was used (H2N-TDQNKIVTYKW-LSYTLGVH-COOH). Proteins were transferred to 0.45 μm nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) after SDS-PAGE in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 192 mm glycine containing 10% v/v methanol) in a Genie blotter (Idea Scientific, Minneapolis, MN) for 75 min for 0.8-mm thick gels using a constant voltage of 12 volts. The membrane was incubated in TBST buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% fat-free dry milk for 1 h at room temperature and washed briefly with TBST. The membrane was incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed 3× with TBST and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG (Pierce, Rockford, IL) for 1 h. The membrane was washed 3× with TBST. SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate was used for signal production (Pierce) and the signal was captured on a Blue Bio film (Denville Scientific, Metuchen, NJ) after exposure for 15 s to 30 min and developed. We have previously devised a conventional procedure for the rigorous isolation of the pol δ core enzyme containing p125 and p50 (3.Lee M.Y.W.T. Tan C, -K. Downey K.M. So A.G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1906-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In order to isolate a multisubunit form of mammalian pol δ, a new purification scheme was devised, which allowed the isolation of pol δ core that retained associated polypeptides. This involved successive chromatographies on DE52, Q-Sepharose, SP-Sepharose, Mono Q, heparin-Sepharose, Mono S, Source Q15, Superdex 200 supports, including four FPLC chromatography steps (Mono Q, Mono S, Source Q15, and Superdex 200). Table I shows the purification of pol δ by this means. The specific activity of the preparation (about 9,000 units/mg) was comparable with that of pol δ purified by immunoaffinity chromatography (18.Jiang Y.-Q Zhang S.J. Wu S.M. Lee M.Y.W.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Review of a number of preparations isolated by the latter method gave an average specific activity about 10,000 units/mg, with a PCNA stimulation of 20–40-fold. The PCNA stimulation of 30-fold was found for the preparation obtained by the new procedure. This is similar to that of the immunoaffinity purified enzyme. The average specific activity of the purified recombinant pol δ heterodimer in our hands is about 2000 units/mg, with maximum PCNA stimulations of 6–10-fold. These results indicate that rigorously purified pol δ p125/p50 heterodimer has lost a significant fraction of its ability to respond to PCNA.Table IPurification of calf thymus DNA polymerase δFractionTotal volumeProteinTotal unitsSpecific activitymlmgunits/mg proteinDE 523,61518,075397,00022Q-Sepharose4702,585295,000113SP-Sepharose176722468,000648Mono Q3476.556,000736Heparin-Sepharose1712.239,0003,211Mono S3.32.19,4004,500Source Q153.00.159006,000Superdex 2000.80.0222008,900 Open table in a new tab The final purification step used was FPLC gel filtration on Superdex 200. Calibration of the column showed that the peak of pol δ activity was eluted at a position indicating a much higher molecular weight (280,000) than can be accounted for by the two-subunit core. The Coomassie Blue staining of this pol δ complex is shown in Fig.1. There were six major bands in the peak fractions of pol δ from fractions 48 to 50; these were of 125 kDa, 50 kDa, a doublet at about 25 kDa and a doublet at about 12 kDa. These polypeptide bands were excised from the Coomassie Blue-stained gel and sequenced at the Harvard Microchemistry Facility using LC/MS/MS methods. The sequencing results are displayed in TableII. Both the 25-kDa polypeptides were identified as the proteolytic products of KIAA0039, which was recently found to be associated with pol δ by a PCNA overlay assay (17.Zhang P. Mo J. Perez A. Leon A.

The KIAA0039 product was also eluted with pol δ from a PCNA affinity column (20.Hughes P. Tratner I. Ducoux M. Piard K. Baldacci G.

The second 12-kDa polypeptide was found to be a novel protein. The partial sequence obtained from this protein was QFDLAWQYGPCTGITR (Table II). This sequence was searched against the known protein data bases, which did not provide a match. A tBlastn search of the EST data base showed a match with one human EST sequence, AA402118, which, however, did not have a well defined open reading frame. Concurrently, the S. pombe Cdm1 protein sequence, which represents the fourth subunit of pol δ, was used for a tBlastn search at NCBI. This also retrieved the human EST sequence, AA402118. The EST cDNA clone was obtained from ATCC and was resequenced and corrected. The corrected sequence contained an open reading frame that encoded a protein of 107 amino acid residues, with a predicted molecular mass of 12.4 kDa. This protein was designated as p12. The corrected DNA sequence has been deposited in GenBank with the accession number AJ179890 (Fig.2). The peptide sequence obtained from p12 shows a perfect match with residues 51–65 of the open reading frame of AJ179890. These results indicate that p12 is a likely human homologue of theS. pombe Cdm1 protein, which has been reported to be the fourth subunit of S. pombe pol δ (10.Zuo S. Gibbs E. Kelven Z. Wang T.S.-F. O'Donnell M. MacNeill S.A. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11244-11249Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 21.Reynolds N. Watt A. Fantes P.A. MacNeill S.A. Curr. Genet. 1998; 34: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The S. pombe Cdm1 protein has a calculated molecular mass of 18.5 kDa and an apparent size of 22 kDa on SDS-PAGE, and is significantly larger than human p12. Sequence alignments were performed to assess the possible relationships between these two proteins. Protein sequence alignment indicates that the identity between p12 (107 residues) andS. pombe Cdm1 (160 residues) is 25% and the similarity is 39% (Fig. 3). It can be seen that the main region of identity of p12 is with the C-terminal half of S. pombe Cdm1. Alignment of amino acid residues 96- 142 of Cdm1 with residues 48 to 94 of p12 shows that there is a 44% identity. This degree of similarity is sufficient for p12 to be regarded as the mammalian homologue of S. pombe Cdm1. Taken together with the sequence identification of the p12 and its co-purification with the calf thymus pol δ core through eight chromatography procedures, these findings provide strong evidence for the identification of p12 as a novel subunit of mammalian pol δ. We had previously shown that pol δ isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography contains the pol δ core in association with a number of other polypeptides (18.Jiang Y.-Q Zhang S.J. Wu S.M. Lee M.Y.W.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and also displayed a much higher molecular weight than could be accounted for by the core on gel filtration analysis (22.Mo, J., Liu, L., Leon, A., Mazloum N., and Lee, M. Y. W. T. (2000) Biochemistry, in pressGoogle Scholar). The failure to observe p12 in these studies could be due its small size and the fact that it migrated close to the dye front under the conditions used. A preparation of pol δ was purified from calf thymus using immunoaffinity chromatography (18.Jiang Y.-Q Zhang S.J. Wu S.M. Lee M.Y.W.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and the preparation was assessed for the presence both of the p68 and p12 subunits. The presence of these two polypeptides on SDS-PAGE gels of the preparation are shown in Fig. 4. Polypeptides corresponding to 68 and 12 kDa were prominent components of the preparation, and their identity as the p68 and p12 polypeptides was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 4). Thus, the presence of all four subunits of pol δ (p125, p50, p68, and p12) were demonstrated in this preparation (Fig. 4). The KIAA0039 product in the Western blot was 68 kDa. The p68 sequence has a conserved p21 Waf1 -like PCNA binding motif at the extreme C terminus, as does S. pombe Cdc27 and S. cerevisiae Pol32p, the yeast third subunits of pol δ (13.Gerik K.J. Li X. Pautz A. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19747-19755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The p68 sequence encoded by KIAA0039 was aligned with the sequences of Cdc27 and Pol32p (Fig. 5). Analysis of the alignments showed that p68 shares little sequence identity with Cdc27 and Pol32p. The only sequence conservation was the C-terminal PCNA binding motif in these three sequences. p68 and Pol32p both have nuclear localization motifs. p68 also has an unique proline-rich motif. Pairwise alignments using the Clustal W 1.8 program show that between Pol32p and Cdc27, Pol32p and p68, or Cdc27 and p68 there is only 15 to 16% sequence identity (not shown). However, evaluation of the significance of the alignment score for p68 with Cdc27 using the PRSS program provided a score of 0.4, i.e. the alignment score (% identity) would be attained by chance against the randomly shuffled Cdc27 sequence only 0.4 times in 100 attempts. This indicates that the similarity between these two proteins is significant. The thrust of the earlier studies of pol δ was the rigorous isolation of the enzyme which culminated in the isolation of a two-subunit enzyme, containing a catalytic subunit of 125 kDa and a second subunit of 50 kDa (3.Lee M.Y.W.T. Tan C, -K. Downey K.M. So A.G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1906-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 23.Lee M.Y.W.T. Jiang Y. Zhang S.L. Toomey N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266 (2429): 2433Google Scholar). The major difficulties in this process were the small amounts of protein available and the likelihood of proteolysis using extensive purification schemes due to the fragile nature of the mammalian system compared with other systems,i.e. prokaryotic or lower eukaryotes such as yeast. Recently, expression systems for the p125 (15.Wu S. Zhang P. Zeng X. Zhang S. Mo J. Li B. Lee M.Y.W.T. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1094-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The p50 subunit has no known enzymatic functions, but has been shown to be required for the response of the p125 subunit to PCNA (16.Sun Y. Jiang Y. Zhang P. Zhang S. Zhou Y. Li B. Toomey N.L.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1094-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this study we have shown for the first time the isolation of a four-subunit mammalian pol δ enzyme. This newly isolated pol δ contains the third subunit p68 and a previously unknown subunit, p12. The latter two are the mammalian homologues of S. pombe Cdc27 and Cdm1, respectively. The association of p68 and p12 with pol δ was demonstrated by their isolation with p125 and p50 from calf thymus through extensive purification involving multiple conventional column chromatographies as well as by immunoaffinity chromatography. The conventional procedure included several FPLC steps including gel permeation chromatography. The strong association of the p68 and p12 polypeptides with the pol δ core provide very strong evidence for the proposal that these represent subunits of pol δ. p68 has also been isolated from mouse cell extracts using a PCNA affinity column in association with the pol δ core consisting of the p125 and p50 subunits (20.Hughes P. Tratner I. Ducoux M. Piard K. Baldacci G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2108-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). There are extensive technical problems associated with the identification of subunits of mammalian pol δ. As encountered in our studies, these include the susceptibility of the p68 polypeptide to proteolysis and the difficulties of isolation of pol δ from animal tissues to study stoichiometries of pol δ subunits in native enzyme preparations. Nevertheless, in these studies it is demonstrated that it is possible to rigorously isolate pol δ from calf thymus in a form which retains the p68 and p12 polypeptides. A key difference in the new method from the older procedure (18.Jiang Y.-Q Zhang S.J. Wu S.M. Lee M.Y.W.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) was the avoidance of single-stranded DNA cellulose chromatography. The identification of the fourth subunit of pol δ in mammalian systems now provides a parallel for the situation found in yeast. A comparison of the subunit structures of pol δ from the mammalian and the two yeast models is shown in TableIII. The catalytic subunit of mammalian pol δ is strongly conserved in evolution, and shares a high degree of homology with the corresponding catalytic subunits in S. pombe and S. cerevisiae, the identity being greater than 48% (27.Yang C.-L. Chang L.-S. Zhang P. Hao H. Lingyn Z. Toomey N.L. Lee M.Y.W.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The p50 subunit is less conserved than the catalytic subunit, the identity between p50 and S. pombe being 33% (11.MacNeill S.A. Moreno S. Reynolds N. Nurse P. Fantes P.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4613-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the finding that PCNA from human or yeast origin can activate the heterologous pol δ preparations strongly suggests that the pol δ complex is functionally conserved to a high degree (28.Burgurs P.M.J. Nuclear Acids Res. 1988; 16: 6297-6307Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The functions of these subunits are still incompletely understood. The third subunit of S. pombe pol δ was only recently identified (10.Zuo S. Gibbs E. Kelven Z. Wang T.S.-F. O'Donnell M. MacNeill S.A. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11244-11249Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and is encoded by the cdc27 +gene, which is needed for the transition of G2/M in the cell cycle (11.MacNeill S.A. Moreno S. Reynolds N. Nurse P. Fantes P.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4613-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The third subunit of S. cerevisiae pol δ is Pol32p, was isolated and identified in 1998. It was proposed as a candidate for dimerization factor of pol δ (13.Gerik K.J. Li X. Pautz A. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19747-19755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) based on the finding that the recombinant three-subunit enzyme could be shown to behave as a dimer on gel filtration (13.Gerik K.J. Li X. Pautz A. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19747-19755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In addition, Pol32p was found to interact with the pol α catalytic subunit by the yeast two-hybrid method (29.Huang M.E. Le Douarin B. Henry C. Galibert F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 260: 541-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Pol32p can (a) dimerize pol δ at the replication fork, and (b) provide a means for the proposed “polymerase” switch at the lagging strand through the interaction with pol α as suggested by Waga et al.(1.Waga S.

In fact, Blast searches with Cdc27 failed to identify either p68 or Pol32p. tBlastn searches using Pol32p only identified a Drosophila melanogaster third subunit of pol δ. Similarly, using p68 the putative Caenorhabditis elegans and Arabidopsis thaliana third subunit of pol δ were identified (Table IV). As already noted (“Results”), the third subunits of human, S. pombe, and S. cerevisiae are poorly conserved, although the relationships based on the alignments can be shown to be significant. The third subunits of pol δ from different species all contain a putative p21waf1-like PCNA binding motif (30.Warbrick E. Lane D.P. Glover D.M. Cox L.S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2313-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 31.Warbrick E. Heatherington W. Lane D.P. Glover D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3925-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) at the extreme C terminus. An important aspect of the third subunit is that it interacts with PCNA, and also with the yeast p50 homologues (11.MacNeill S.A. Moreno S. Reynolds N. Nurse P. Fantes P.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4613-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 13.Gerik K.J. Li X. Pautz A. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol.

The ability of p68 to bind to PCNA (17.Zhang P. Mo J. Perez A. Leon A. Liu L. Mazloum N. Xu H. Lee M.Y.W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26647-26653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 20.Hughes P. Tratner I. Ducoux M. Piard K. Baldacci G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2108-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) may account for the loss of sensitivity to PCNA shown by pol δ p125/p50 heterodimer. In addition, all share in common a high content of charged amino acids which ranges from 29 to 35%. The calculated isoelectric points for these proteins are all basic, with the exception of theS. pombe Cdc27, which has an acidic isoelectric point. This common property suggests that p68 is likely to have an extended structure in solution, which is also consistent with its apparent liability to proteolysis. A third property of the third subunit may be an ability to interact with the p50 second subunit, which has been demonstrated in S. pombe and S. cerevisiae (11.MacNeill S.A. Moreno S. Reynolds N. Nurse P. Fantes P.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4613-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar,13.Gerik K.J. Li X. Pautz A. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol.

One speculative function of p68 may be to act as a linker protein between p50 and PCNA, which would provide additional stabilization of the pol δ-PCNA interaction. This possibility is consistent with the higher sensitivity to PCNA of the pol δ preparations which contain p68 compared with that of the heterodimer.Table IVThe third subunits and putative third subunits of pol δOrganisma1.

Interestingly, data base searches have failed to identify a homologue in S. cerevisiae, despite the fact that its entire genome has been cloned. This may be due to a lack of evolutionary conservation. The functions of this newly described subunit also remain to be determined. In summary, this work provides evidence for the identification of a novel subunit, p12, as a component of mammalian pol δ, as well as evidence for the isolation of pol δ in a form that contains the core heterodimer in association with both p12 and the third subunit, p68."

The crystal structure of the dehaloperoxidase (DHP) was determined by the multiple isomorphous replacement method and was refined at 1.8-Å resolution. The enzyme fold is that of the globin family and, together with the amino acid sequence information, indicates that the enzyme evolved from an ancient oxygen carrier. The peroxidase activity of DHP arose mainly through changes in the positions of the proximal and distal histidines relative to those seen in globins. The structure of a complex of DHP with 4-iodophenol is also reported, and it shows that in contrast to larger heme peroxidases DHP binds organic substrates in the distal cavity. The binding is facilitated by the histidine swinging in and out of the cavity. The modeled position of the oxygen atom bound to the heme suggests that the enzymatic reaction proceeds via direct attack of the oxygen atom on the carbon atom bound to the halogen atom.

It is less known that bromoaromatics of biotic origin are also widespread and secreted as chemical warfare by a number of marine organisms. Dehalogenating enzymes are used as the first line of defense against these toxicants by organisms that live in such contaminated environments (1.Fielman K.T. Woodin S.A. Walla M.D. Lincoln D.E. Mar.

This species does not produce halogenated compounds itself but usually co-habits estuarine mud flats with other polychaete worms, such asNotomastus lobatus, and hemichordata such asSaccoglossus kowalewskyi, which secrete large quantities of brominated aromatics and other halometabolites as repellents (5.Woodin S.A.

Woodin, submitted for publication. 2D. E. Lincoln, K. T. Fielman, R. L. Marinelli, and S. A. Woodin, submitted for publication. The levels of DHP are very high as it represents approximately 3% of the soluble protein in crude extracts of A. ornata. The enzyme catalyzes the oxidative dehalogenation of polyhalogenated phenols in the presence of hydrogen peroxide at a rate at least 10 times faster than all known halohydrolases of bacterial origin, according to Reaction FR1. The oxidative potential of hydrogen peroxide likely allows for the unusually high rate of this reaction as well as for the unique ability of DHP to dehalogenate fluorophenols. The enzyme has activity toward substrates with different numbers and positions of halogen substituents (2.Chen Y.P. Woodin S.A. Lincoln D.E. Lovell C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4609-4612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The binding of oxygen and peroxide ligands and their activation are due to the presence of heme in a variety of oxygen carriers and enzymes. This is also true for DHP, which contains one heme per subunit (3.Zhang E. Chen Y.P. Roach M.P. Lincoln D.E. Lovell C.R. Woodin S.A. Dawson J.H. Lebioda L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 1191-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and a histidine as the proximal iron ligand (4.Roach M.P. Chen Y.P. Woodin S.H. Lincoln D.E. Lovell C.R. Dawson J.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2197-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The propensity of peroxidases (and oxygenases, which tend to have a cysteinate proximal ligand) to cleave the oxygen-oxygen bond and form a high valent iron-oxo intermediate, as opposed to globins, has been explained by the “push-pull” theory (7.Poulos T.L. Adv. Inorg. Biochem. 1988; 7: 1-36PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Dawson J.H. Science. 1988; 240: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar), in which crucial roles have been assigned to the proximal histidine and polar residues in the distal pocket. Peroxidases form a strong hydrogen bond between the Nδ1 atom of the proximal histidine and a nearby glutamate conveying partial histidinate character to the proximal histidine and making it a better electron donor (providing a better electron “push”). Conversely, globins lack a glutamate in the proximal pocket, and the Nδ1 atom of the axial histidine only forms a weak hydrogen bond (7.Poulos T.L. Adv. Inorg. Biochem. 1988; 7: 1-36PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Dawson J.H. Science. 1988; 240: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). However, more recent studies of cytochrome c peroxidase mutants indicate that the electronic push plays only a minor role in its catalytic activity (9.Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 356-359Crossref Scopus (241) Google Scholar). On the other hand the “pull” effect survives well a scrutiny of site-directed mutagenesis (10.Matsui T. Ozaki S. Liong E. Phillips Jr., G.N. Watanabe Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2838-2844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Here, we report structural analyses of DHP and their implications for evolutionary relationship between DHP and oxygen carriers. We also discuss how well the push-pull theory explains the catalytic properties of DHP. Preliminary data have been briefly communicated previously (11.Lebioda L. LaCount M.W. Zhang E. Chen Y.P. Han K. Whitton M.M. Lincoln D.E. Woodin S.A. Nature. 1999; 401: 445Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Proteins separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Edman degradation of the polyvinylidene difluoride blots was performed using an Applied Biosystems 492 ProciseTM Protein Sequencing System and 610A Data Analysis software to determine N-terminal protein sequence. The sequence of first 64 amino acids was established. A cDNA library was constructed from A. ornata collected at North Inlet, Georgetown, SC, in the Uni-ZAP XR vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A 125-bp fragment of the DHP gene was amplified from the library by polymerase chain reaction using primers designed from the N-terminal amino acid sequence. The fragment was labeled with fluorescein-11-dUTP using random priming (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used to screen the cDNA library. Positive plaques were purified through three rounds of repeated screening. Plasmid DNA was excised using ExAssist helper phage with the SOLR strain (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the sequence was determined with an automated DNA sequencer (Li-COR, Lincoln, NB). The nucleotide sequence was translated into an amino acid sequence using the GCG software (12.Genetics Computer GroupWisconsin Package, Version 9.1. Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI1997Google Scholar). Protein was purified and assayed for activity using the same procedures as published previously. Crystals with two subunits in an asymmetric part of the unit cell were obtained as reported previously (3.Zhang E. Chen Y.P. Roach M.P. Lincoln D.E. Lovell C.R. Woodin S.A. Dawson J.H. Lebioda L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 1191-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, an unbuffered solution containing 30% PEG8000 and 200 mm ammonium sulfate was used as the precipitant in the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. Crystals belong to space group P212121 with unit cell dimensionsa = 68.5, b = 68.4, andc = 61.1 Å. Even in the absence of sequence information, we suspected a structural relation to the globin family based on the protein size and the presence of the heme. However, the molecular replacement method with a myoglobin model did not provide a solution. The DHP structure was determined by MIRAS using a mercury acetate derivative (0.1 mm, 1-h soak), a 4-iodophenol derivative (saturated, overnight soak), and anomalous scattering from heme iron atoms. Two mercury sites were located in a difference Patterson map and used to phase difference Fourier and anomalous Fourier maps in which the positions of iodine and iron atoms were located. Structure-factor phases were calculated with MLPHARE (13.Otwinowski Z. Wolf W. Evans P.R. Leslie A.G.W. Isomorphous Replacement and Anomalous Scattering. SERC Daresburry Laboratory, Warrington, UK1991: 80-86Google Scholar, 14.Collaborative Computing Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar) yielding a figure of merit of 0.58 and improved with solvent flattening and histogram matching in DM (14.Collaborative Computing Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr.

An electron density map calculated at 3.0-Å resolution revealed the orientation of heme groups and the location of several helices. At this stage, the similarity of DHP to the globin structure became apparent. A model of myoglobin was used to construct the molecular envelope, and electron density maps were optimized using non-crystallographic symmetry averaging, solvent flattening, and phase extension to the maximum resolution of the native data set, 1.8 Å, with DM. The resulting electron density was readily interpretable. The initial model was built with only partial sequence information. The identification of residues in the stretch where the sequence was not known, based on the shape of side chains electron density and hydrogen bonding pattern, turned out to be successful for ∼60% of the residues. The final model included all amino acids (137 per subunit), hemes, two sulfate ions, and 107 water molecules and was optimized using simulated annealing, positional, and B-refinements of the CNS (16.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

The structure of iodophenol complex was obtained by rebuilding the native structure and refinement with the CNS.

We have isolated a protein with N-terminal sequence, DCNALDRIKVLDQQI, that is 53% identical to earth worm giant hemoglobin; others have reported a tetrameric hemoglobin with four different N-terminal sequences (18.Fushitani K. Bonaventura J. Bonaventura C. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1986; 84: 134-141Google Scholar), one of which agrees with our giant hemoglobin data. These sequences, 3–4 amino acids, were too short to show any relation to DHP. A. ornata also has a monomeric, coelomic hemoglobin (19.Weber R.E. Magnum C. Steinman H. Bonaventura C. Sullivan B. Bonaventura J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1977; 56: 179-187Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the sequence of which has not yet been determined. However, the N-terminal 28-amino acid sequence of the coelomic hemoglobin from another polychaete worm, Enoplobranchus sanguineus (19.Weber R.E. Magnum C. Steinman H. Bonaventura C. Sullivan B. Bonaventura J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1977; 56: 179-187Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), is 32% identical to DHP indicating that DHP evolved from an oxygen carrier. DHP has retained its ability to bind oxygen, and when isolated it is in the oxy-ferrous state (4.Roach M.P. Chen Y.P. Woodin S.H. Lincoln D.E. Lovell C.R. Dawson J.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2197-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) but, in contrast to the coelomic hemoglobin, is dimeric (2.Chen Y.P. Woodin S.A. Lincoln D.E. Lovell C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4609-4612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The complete sequence closest to DHP found in the Swiss-Prot data base is that ofAplysia limacina (sea hare) myoglobin (MBA), with 20.6% identity in a 126-amino acid overlap. Interestingly, MBA is a globin that has had its distal histidine replaced by valine (20.Bolognesi M. Onesti S. Gatti G. Coda A. Ascenzi P. Brunori M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 529-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The alignment of the amino acid sequence of DHP with those of MBA and sperm whale myoglobin (MYO) as well as information on three-dimensional structure superpositions is shown in Fig.1. Polychaete worms are well represented by the Middle Cambrian (21.Conway Morris S. Philos. Trans. Roy. Soc. Lond - Biol Sci. 1979; 258: 227-274Google Scholar) about 530 million years ago, so the dehalogenase activity is probably younger than that. On the other hand the oxygen carrier function of globins is considerably older and universal (22.Moens L. Vanfleteren J. Van de Peer Y Peeters K. Kapp O. Czeluzniak J. Goodman M. Blaxter M. Vinogradov S. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1996; 13: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), so it is highly likely that the DHP activity arose by a globin gene duplication and divergence. The overall fold of DHP closely resembles that of globins despite the relatively low sequence identity. The structural differences are on the same order of magnitude as the differences between distantly related globins (Fig. 1). A least squares superposition of the structures of DHP and MYO, shown in Fig.2, yielded a root mean square distance between the positions of Cα of 1.8 Å. In solution DHP is dimeric (2.Chen Y.P. Woodin S.A. Lincoln D.E. Lovell C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4609-4612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and crystallizes with the dimer in an asymmetric part of the unit cell. The two subunits of DHP are very similar; their least squares superposition shows that they are related by a 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry axis with an root mean square distance between Cαs of 0.25 Å and the largest differences, ∼0.85 Å, at residues 39–41, which form lattice contacts. Intersubunit contacts are relatively limited; the dimer interface involves hydrophobic interactions of the side chains of Val-74 from both subunits and hydrogen bonding between the side chain of Asp-72 from one subunit and the side chains of Arg-112 and Asn-126 from the other. The formation of the dimer reduces the surface area by 464 Å2. The residues at the interface do not correspond to those in tetrameric and dimeric hemoglobins, and the spatial arrangement of dimers is completely different. The catalytic mechanism of DHP is probably similar to that to that employed by other peroxidases at least as far as the key role of a high valent iron-oxo intermediate formed upon addition of hydrogen peroxide to the enzyme and subsequent heterolytic cleavage of the O—O bond (8.Dawson J.H. Science. 1988; 240: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Since the reaction does not take place at the heme edge but in the distal pocket and the enzyme is isolated in the ferrous state, it may be speculated that the intermediate does not carry the oxidative equivalent in the form of porphyrin radical (compound I) as found in peroxidases. If so, both oxidative equivalencies of peroxide would be contained on the heme iron, which cycles between II and IV oxidation states, and thus the intermediate would be compound II. Such reactivity has previously been observed in model systems (23.Groves J.T. Gross Z. Stern M.K. Inorg. Chem. 1994; 33: 5065-5072Crossref Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The pull component in peroxidases is created by the distal histidine functioning as an acid/base in proton transfer to the leaving water molecule with the guanidinium moiety of an arginine stabilizing the developing negative charge (7.Poulos T.L. Adv. Inorg. Biochem. 1988; 7: 1-36PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Dawson J.H. Science. 1988; 240: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). This arrangement is functional because peroxidases do not utilize the distal cavity as an organic substrate binding pocket but rather the reaction takes place at the heme edge (24.Ator M.A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1542-1551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytochromes P-450, which bind organic substrates next to heme, appear to depend largely on the push created by the proximal cysteinate ligand (8.Dawson J.H. Science. 1988; 240: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 25.Dawson J.H. Holm R.H. Trudell J.R. Barth G. Linder R.E. Bunnenberg E. Djerassi C. Tang S.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1976; 98: 3707-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). It is likely that the utilization of the distal cavity by DHP is dynamic and combines elements of mechanisms of both cytochrome P-450 and peroxidases. In short, DHP binds peroxide and uses the distal histidine as the pull to accomplish the heterolytic cleavage of the oxygen-oxygen bond. When the high valent iron-oxo intermediate is ready, the distal histidine swings out of the cavity enabling the substrate to enter the distal pocket and undergo oxidation. This hypothesis finds strong support in the observation that the distal histidine, His-55, in the native DHP is disordered between two positions, one outside the distal pocket and the other inside (Fig.3 B). The distances between the Nα2 atom of the distal histidine and the heme-iron in globins are 4.1–4.6 Å, whereas in peroxidases the distances are larger, 5.5–6.0 Å (10.Matsui T. Ozaki S. Liong E. Phillips Jr., G.N. Watanabe Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2838-2844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In DHP, this distance is 5.4 Å for the position inside the distal cavity. It appears that the ability of His-55 to function in the in/out mode arose as a result of a difference in the position of its Cα when compared with MYO. This difference is ∼1 Å when the superposition that minimizes distances between equivalent Cαs of DHP and MYO is used or 2.4 Å when the hemes are superimposed. The shift appears to be generated by the replacement of Gly that follows the distal His-in MYO with Thr in DHP. This residue is located on a sharp turn of the main chain, and the larger side chain of threonine pushes the main chain toward the entrance of the distal cavity creating the shift, as shown in Fig. 3 B. This residue, Gly-65 in MYO, is almost completely conserved in globins that utilize distal His. The out of pocket location of distal histidine is not unique to DHP. It was observed in low pH (4.0) structure of myoglobin (6.Franzen S. Roach M.P. Chen Y.P. Dyer R.B. Woodruff W.H. Dawson J.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 4658-4661Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar) in which the distal histidine was likely to be protonated. The content of the distal pocket in the native DHP is partially disordered and probably correlated with the disorder of the distal histidine. Nevertheless, it is apparent that the heme iron is pentacoordinated. In the structure of the complex with 4-iodophenol, Fig. 4, the positions of iodine atom (11ς in the difference Fourier map) and oxygen atom are well established; however, the orientation of the plane of the phenyl ring is based on steric considerations. It appears to form an angle of about 45° with the plane of the heme. The distal histidine is in the position outside the distal cavity. On the proximal side of the heme there are significant differences between DHP and both globins and peroxidases. In DHP, the proximal histidine does not form a strong hydrogen bond to a nearby carboxylate as in peroxidases. Instead, the imidazole ring is rotated by ∼60° with respect to the position in globins, and its hydrogen atom points directly into the oxygen atom of the Leu-83 peptide carbonyl. The resulting hydrogen bond is shorter, and likely stronger, than in myoglobin where this hydrogen bond is bifurcated (Fig. 3 A). The reorientation of the imidazole ring is facilitated by the replacement of the last turn of the F-helix of myoglobin with a very short 310 helix and, remarkably, a shift of the proximal histidine in the sequence by two residues (Fig. 1). It may also be suspected that the lone electron pairs of Sδ of Met-86, one of which is in contact with His-89, contribute to the push through charge transfer. Studies using vibrational spectroscopy (6.Franzen S. Roach M.P. Chen Y.P. Dyer R.B. Woodruff W.H. Dawson J.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 4658-4661Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar) have shown that the Fe–N bond, the strength of which reflects the electron push, is indeed stronger in DHP than in globins, although not as strong as in peroxidases where the proximal histidine has a partial histidinate character. DHP offers a valuable perspective, as a chimera of sort, on one of the most thoroughly studied structure-function relationship, that of the protoporphyrin IX properties in globins versus peroxidases. The distal pocket is almost as hydrophobic as in globins, but the distal histidine is positioned more like in peroxidases. It appears that the lack of an auxiliary, polarizing arginine has to be compensated on the proximal side. Indeed, there are large differences there between classical globins and DHP. They suggest, however, that this is not so much electronic push but rather the different coupling of protein molecular dynamics to the heme through repositioning of the proximal histidine. Such concept is in agreement with the studies of the variants of peroxidases with altered proximal environment of the heme and supports the proposition that the mechanical coupling of the heme iron plays an important role (9.Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 356-359Crossref Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Thus perhaps it is time to replace the push and pull theory in peroxidases with a “pull and pull” approach. It is likely that the DHP function arose to dehalogenate biogenic bromphenols, but the enzyme also can dehalogenate trichlorophenols and a number of other anthropogenic pollutants. The enzyme efficiency does not change significantly with the position and number of halogen atoms at the phenol ring (2.Chen Y.P. Woodin S.A. Lincoln D.E. Lovell C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4609-4612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It appears that the enzyme simply binds the organic substrate close to a very active oxygen atom and works without a system of complicated hydrogen bonds and other interactions that are characteristic of enzymes with more sophisticated mechanisms. This also offers hope that appropriate modifications of the residues lining the distal cavity can broaden or modify its specificity. Efforts in other laboratories to enhance the peroxidase activity of MYO have yielded only limited success (10.Matsui T. Ozaki S. Liong E. Phillips Jr., G.N. Watanabe Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2838-2844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The structure of DHP offers excellent clues how to proceed toward this goal.

The enzymes also require bound FMN, FAD, (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l-biopterin (BH4), and Ca2+/calmodulin for activity. Three main isoforms of NOS have been identified: isoform I or neuronal NOS (nNOS), which is constitutively expressed in a variety of neuronal cells as well as other cells; isoform II or inducible NOS, which is usually not constitutively expressed but can be induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide and/or cytokines in macrophages and other cells; and isoform III or endothelial NOS, which is expressed in endothelial cells (5.Lancaster Jr., J.R.

Based on studies with other hsp90-associated proteins, this loss of NOS is likely due to enhanced proteasomal degradation, presumably as a mechanism for the removal of misfolded proteins (9.Schneider C.

More recently, our laboratory has shown that suicide inactivation of nNOS enhances the proteolytic removal of the enzyme that is mediated, in part, by the proteasome (13.Noguchi S. Jianmongkol S. Bender A.T. Kamada Y. Demady D.R. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2376-2380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Based on these studies, we asked if nNOS could be regulated by ubiquitination prior to proteolytic removal by the proteasome in HEK 293 cells transfected with nNOS. This cellular model was chosen since it is the same model used in studies on the suicide inactivation and hsp90 regulation of nNOS (7.Bender A.T. Silverstein A.M. Demady D.R. Kanelakis K.C.

In the current study, we have found that inhibition of the proteasome leads to the accumulation of higher molecular mass forms of nNOS, which are in part due to conjugation with ubiquitin (Ub). The major nNOS-Ub conjugate did not greatly change the relative mobility of the protein on SDS-PAGE gels, suggesting that the conjugate contains a few or perhaps one Ub. This limited ubiquitination of nNOS could be reproduced with an in vitro system containing purified nNOS, reticulocyte extracts, ATP, and Ub. Studies with 125I-Ub indicate that the heme-deficient monomeric form of nNOS is preferentially ubiquitinated over the dimeric active form of nNOS. Thus, these studies establish for the first time that ubiquitination of nNOS occurs and likely plays a regulatory role in the removal of misfolded or non-functional protein. The affinity-purified rabbit IgG used for Western blotting of nNOS was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) or from RBI (Natick, MA) where indicated. The immunogen used for production of the antibody from Transduction Laboratories was a C-terminal peptide (residues 1095–1289) of nNOS, whereas that from RBI was an N-terminal peptide (residues 251–270). The affinity-purified IgG used for Western blotting of Ub was from Dako Corp. (Carpinteria, CA). The rabbit antiserum used to immunoprecipitate nNOS was raised against rat neuronal NOS and was the generous gift of Dr. Lance Pohl (NHLBI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The antibody was affinity purified prior to use.N G-Nitro-l-arginine (NNA) and the rabbit antiserum used to immunoprecipitate Ub were purchased from Sigma. Peroxidase conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. 125I-Labeled Ub was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Lactacystin was purchased from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA). BH4 was purchased from Dr. Schirk's Laboratory (Jona, Switzerland). The cDNA for rat neuronal NOS was kindly provided by Dr. Solomon Snyder (Johns Hopkins Medical School, Baltimore, MD). Male Wistar rats (150–250 g) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells stably transfected with rat neuronal NOS by Bredtet al. (14.Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E. Lowenstein C. Reed R.R. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1991; 351: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar) were obtained from Dr. Bettie Sue Masters (University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX). HEK 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum and G418 as described previously (3.McMillan K. Bredt D.S. Hirsch D.J. Snyder S.H. Clark J.E. Masters B.S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11141-11145Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). When treated with lactacystin, cells were seeded at a density of 0.8 × 105 cells/ml and grown for 48 h. After 48 h, the cell medium was aspirated and replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1 mm arginine and supplemented with either 10 μm lactacystin or H2O as a vehicle control. HEK cells were harvested, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and homogenized with a Tenbroeck ground glass homogenizer in three volumes of HE lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.32 m sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, 6.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 10 mm Na3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM)). Homogenates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min with the supernatant taken as the cytosolic fraction. Cytosol from rat brains was prepared as above in three volumes of HE lysis buffer. nNOS was immunoadsorbed from 50 μl of HEK 293 cytosol or 100 μl of rat brain cytosol with 20 μl of anti-nNOS IgG and 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose in a total volume of 300 μl of HE lysis buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. In studies where Ub was immunoadsorbed, 25 μl of anti-Ub IgG replaced anti-nNOS IgG. Immune pellets were washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold HE lysis buffer. Immune pellets were boiled in SDS sample buffer containing dithiothreitol (6.0 mg/ml), and the proteins were resolved on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for 6 h at 850 mA. The membranes were probed with either a 0.1% anti-nNOS polyclonal antibody from Transduction Laboratories or 0.1% anti-nNOS antibody from RBI or 0.1% anti-Ub polyclonal antibody (Dako Corp.). Prior to probing with the anti-Ub antibody, the nitrocellulose membranes were autoclaved in distilled H2O for 20 min. An anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to peroxidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used as a secondary antibody. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with the use of enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Super Signal, Pierce) and X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Co.). nNOS was expressed in Sf9 cells using a recombinant baculovirus as described previously (7.Bender A.T. Silverstein A.M. Demady D.R. Kanelakis K.C. Noguchi S. Pratt W.B. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1472-1478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were grown in SFM 900 II serum-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with Cytomax (Kemp Biotechnology, Rockville, MD) in suspension cultures maintained at 27 °C with continuous shaking (150 rpm). Cultures were infected in log phase of growth with recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 1.0. After 48 h, oxyhemoglobin (25 μm) was added as a source of heme. Cells were harvested and lysates prepared as described previously (7.Bender A.T. Silverstein A.M. Demady D.R. Kanelakis K.C. Noguchi S. Pratt W.B. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1472-1478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Lysates from infected Sf9 cells (8 × 109) were centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. The supernatant fraction was loaded onto a 2′,5′-ADP Sepharose column, and the nNOS was affinity-purified as described previously (15.Roman L.J. Sheta E.A. Martasek P. Gross S.S. Liu Q. Masters B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8428-8432Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), except that 10 mm 2′-AMP in high salt buffer was used to elute the protein. The nNOS containing fractions were loaded onto a Sephacryl S-300 HR gel filtration column (2.6 × 100 cm, Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, and 10 μm BH4. The proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 1.3 ml/min, and 1.5 ml-fractions were collected and analyzed for protein content and NOS activity. The fractions containing NOS activity were pooled and supplemented with 10 μm FAD, 10 μm FMN, and 10 μmBH4 before concentration with the use of a Centriplus concentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA). The concentrated enzyme was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. For preparation of purified heme-deficient apo-nNOS, the same procedure was followed except that oxyhemoglobin was not added to the insect cells during expression. To conjugate Ub to nNOS, purified nNOS (10 μg) was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in a total volume of 60 μl of HKD buffer (10 mm Hepes, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol) containing 50 μm Ub, an ATP-regenerating system (50 mm ATP, 250 mm creatine phosphate, 20 mm MgOAc, and 100 units/ml creatine phosphokinase), and 2 mg/ml DE52-retained fraction of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RET), which was prepared as described previously (7.Bender A.T. Silverstein A.M. Demady D.R. Kanelakis K.C. Noguchi S. Pratt W.B. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1472-1478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). After the incubation, reactions were quenched with SDS sample buffer containing dithiothreitol (6 mg/ml) and Western blotted with a 0.1% polyclonal antibody from Dako Corp. 125I-Ub was conjugated to nNOS using a procedure modified from Ref. 16.Sokolik C.W. Cohen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9100-9107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar by incubating 5 μg of nNOS for 2 h at 37 °C in a total volume of 25 μl of HKD buffer containing 0.2 pmol of125I-Ub (9 × 105 cpm), ATP-regenerating system, and 0.8 mg/ml RET. The reaction was halted by the addition of SDS sample buffer, and aliquots were resolved on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. To separate nNOS monomers and dimers by SDS-PAGE, 100 μm BH4 and 100 μml-arginine were included in the SDS sample buffer and samples were kept ice-cold prior to loading on gels. This method has previously been described by Klatt et al. (17.Klatt P. Schmidt K. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bachinger H.P. Mayer B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3687-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) to prevent the dissociation of nNOS dimers prior to and during electrophoresis. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and dried using a Bio-Rad model 583 gel dryer. Dried gels were then exposed to X-Omat film overnight at −80 °C. The radioactivity was quantified with the use of a PhosphorImager (model 445 SI, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). As shown in Fig.1 A, treatment of nNOS-transfected HEK 293 cells with 10 μm lactacystin leads to the appearance of nNOS bands, which were detected by probing with an antibody directed against the C-terminal region of nNOS, that were of higher molecular mass than the native enzyme (cf. lane 2 with lane 1). HEK 293 cells that have not been transfected with nNOS do not give these intensely staining higher molecular mass bands (lane 4), indicating specificity of the antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 B, higher molecular mass bands were also detected with an antibody directed against the N-terminal region of nNOS (lane 2). The pattern of higher molecular mass forms of nNOS differed from that found with the use of the antibody directed against the C terminus, suggesting that some of the epitopes may be masked. Moreover, these bands were only found when the lysis buffer contained NEM, suggesting an instability of these higher molecular mass nNOS forms due to a thiol-sensitive degradative pathway (cf. lane 2 with lane1). As expected from previous studies (12.Mimnaugh E.G. Chavany C. Neckers L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22796-22801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 18.Chen E.

Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar), lactacystin treatment of HEK 293 cells was found to cause a large increase in the level of immunodetectable Ub-protein conjugates (data not shown). Moreover, Ub-protein conjugates are known to be deubiquitinated by an NEM-sensitive pathway (20.Mimnaugh E.G. Bonvini P. Neckers L. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, we suspected that the higher molecular mass forms of nNOS were due to conjugation with Ub. As shown in Fig.2 A, immunoprecipitation of Ub-conjugates from cytosol that was prepared from lactacystin-treated nNOS-transfected HEK 293 cells revealed higher molecular mass bands that were recognized by anti-nNOS IgG in the immune (I), but not non-immune pellet (N), indicating the formation of nNOS-Ub conjugates. Unexpectedly, we observed a very dark band corresponding to the nNOS monomer that could not be entirely explained by nonspecific immunoprecipitation of nNOS (cf. lanes N withlanes I). As will be described below, this is due to ubiquitination of nNOS in a manner that did not greatly alter the relative mobility of the protein on SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 2 B, anti-nNOS IgG was able to immunoprecipitate large amounts of the native nNOS but not the higher molecular mass forms of the enzyme (left panel). This may be due to masking of nNOS epitopes under the non-denaturing conditions of the immunoprecipitation. Even though we could not address the nature of the higher molecular mass species by immunoprecipitation with anti-nNOS IgG, we found that Western blotting and probing of the nNOS-immunoprecipitate with an anti-Ub IgG gave an immune-specific signal corresponding approximately to the mobility of the nNOS monomer (right panel, cf. lane I with lane N). This signal was increased in lactacystin-treated cells (LC) over that found for control cells (CT), strongly suggesting that the signal was not due to cross-reactivity of the antibody and that ubiquitination of nNOS occurred. Furthermore, the ubiquitination did not greatly alter the relative mobility of the conjugate on SDS-PAGE gels, suggesting that the conjugate contained only one or a few Ub molecules. To further confirm these observations, an in vitro system was investigated as described below. As shown in Fig.3 A, ubiquitination of purified nNOS was also found to occur in vitro when RET and ATP were present during the incubation (cf. lane 3 with lane 1). Again, the nNOS conjugate appeared as a band with the relative mobility on SDS-PAGE gels near that of the monomer of nNOS. The changes in intensity of this nNOS-Ub band were quantified by laser densitometry as shown in Fig. 3 B. The ubiquitination was greatly increased when exogenous Ub was added (lane 4). The smear of higher molecular mass proteins recognized by the Ub antibody were not due to nNOS conjugates, as they were not recognized by anti-nNOS IgG (data not shown), and likely represent various ubiquitinated proteins from RET. The immunoreactivity to the Ub antibody found here was not due to cross-reactivity as the same amount of nNOS was present in all samples. To further support that ubiquitination of nNOS occurs, we utilized 125I-Ub in the in vitro system. As shown in Fig. 4, the radiolabeled Ub was conjugated to nNOS only when incubated with RET and ATP (cf. lane 3 with lane 1). There were three higher molecular mass bands that were radiolabeled, but these were found in reaction mixtures not containing nNOS and are due to ubiquitination of proteins found in RET (cf. lane 3 with lane 4). Thus, taken together, nNOS was ubiquitinated in a manner that had little effect on the relative mobility of nNOS. Higher molecular mass nNOS-Ub conjugates were not observed in these in vitro studies.Figure 4In vitro conjugation of125I-Ub to nNOS. nNOS was treated with a DE52-retained fraction of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RET), an ATP-regenerating system (ATP), and 125I-Ub (9 × 105 cpm) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Where indicated RET, ATP or nNOS were omitted from the reaction mixtures. The reaction mixtures were resolved by SDS-PAGE and the radioactivity detected by exposure of the gel to x-ray film.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Under conditions where 125I-Ub could be conjugated to nNOSin vitro, we asked whether the monomeric or dimeric forms of nNOS were ubiquitinated. The dimeric or catalytically active form of nNOS is resistant to SDS and can be detected as a dimer if the gel and sample are kept cold (17.Klatt P. Schmidt K. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bachinger H.P. Mayer B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3687-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). We utilized this procedure to separate monomer from dimer after ubiquitination with 125I-Ub and subsequently analyzed the samples by Coomassie Blue (CB) staining and PhosphorImager analysis for radioisotope ( 125 I-Ub) (Fig.5). As shown in Fig. 5 A, our nNOS preparation was a mixture of monomer and dimer as determined by Coomassie Blue staining (lane 9). The nNOS was converted to the monomer during incubation with RET and ATP (lane 2) and reflects the instability of the enzyme during the incubation. The nNOS could be stabilized as a dimer if 10 μm NNA was added to the ubiquitination reaction mixture (lane 4). Conversely, we have a purified preparation of inactive heme-deficient apo-nNOS that exists only as a monomer (lane 3). We have previously shown that this apo-nNOS preparation can be functionally reconstituted to give the active dimer (7.Bender A.T. Silverstein A.M. Demady D.R. Kanelakis K.C. Noguchi S. Pratt W.B. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1472-1478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 B, treatment of nNOS gave125I-Ub conjugated to the nNOS monomer (lane 2) as well as to other proteins found in RET (lane 1). The intensity of the 125I-Ub-nNOS monomer band increased when heme-deficient apo-NOS was used instead of native nNOS (lane 3), whereas the intensity decreased when the dimeric nNOS was stabilized with 10 μm NNA (lane 4). An125I-Ub-labeled band corresponding to the dimer of nNOS was not observed, even though a substantial amount of dimer was found by Coomassie Blue staining (cf. panel A, lane 4, with panel B, lane 4). As shown in Fig.5 C, the amount of radioiodine was quantified in samples that were kept cold and thus processed to detect dimer (lanes 2–4) or in samples that were boiled and thus processed under denaturing conditions to detect total nNOS as the monomer (lanes 6–8). The lack of increase in radioactivity found on the monomer under the denaturing conditions over that when the dimer was stabilized, as well as the lack of radioactivity migrating with the dimer, strongly suggests that the dimer was not ubiquitinated. Moreover, the approximately 2-fold increase in 125I-Ub associated with the heme-deficient apo-NOS over that found for nNOS treated with NNA indicated that the monomeric form was preferentially ubiquitinated. It is noteworthy that the amount of nNOS monomer as determined by Coomassie Blue staining in the NNA-treated sample was approximately one-half of that found for heme-deficient apo-nNOS (cf. lane 4 with lane 3). This indicated that the amount of 125I-Ub bound to the monomeric nNOS was approximately equal in these samples and further supported the conclusion that only the monomer was ubiquitinated. Cytosolic fractions from male Wistar rats were prepared and the nNOS was immunoprecipitated. As shown in Fig. 6, probing the immunoprecipitate with antibody to Ub gave a signal at the molecular mass of monomeric nNOS that was immune-specific (right panel, cf. lane I with lane N). Thus, native nNOS exists, in part, as a Ub conjugate. Suicide inactivation of nNOS enhances the proteolytic degradation of the enzyme, in part, due to the proteasome (13.Noguchi S. Jianmongkol S. Bender A.T. Kamada Y. Demady D.R. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2376-2380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We show here that inhibition of the proteasome caused the accumulation of ubiquitinated forms of nNOS, strongly suggesting that ubiquitination regulates nNOS degradation. That ubiquitination is a mechanism for proteasomal removal of proteins is well recognized (19.Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar, 21.Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar, 22.Peters J.-M. Harris J.R. Finley D. Ubiquitin and the Biology of the Cell. Plenum Press, New York1998Crossref Google Scholar), although this is the first report of the ubiquitination of NOS. These observations are consistent with the finding that liver microsomal P450 cytochromes, which are heme-thiolate enzymes similar to NOS, are ubiquitinated and proteasomally degraded after suicide inactivation (23.Korsmeyer K.K. Davoll S. Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. Correia M.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 365: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 24.Wang H.F. Figueiredo Pereira M.E. Correia M.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 365: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the case of suicide inactivation of liver P450 cytochromes, structural changes and not the functional inactivation per se appears to be the “trigger” for proteolysis (25.Tierney D.J. Haas A.L. Koop D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 293: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 26.Correia M.A. Decker C. Sugiyama K. Caldera P. Bornheim L. Wrighton S.A. Rettie A.E. Trager W.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 258: 436-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In particular, the cross-linking of heme to the protein, which occurs during suicide inactivation of cytochrome P450, plays a prominent role in the enhanced turnover of cytochrome P450 (23.Korsmeyer K.K. Davoll S. Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. Correia M.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 365: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 24.Wang H.F. Figueiredo Pereira M.E. Correia M.A. Arch. Biochem.

Falick A.M. Patel N. Correia M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 59-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This process is selective in that other structural changes that occur during suicide inactivation, including the N-alkylation of the heme (25.Tierney D.J. Haas A.L. Koop D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 293: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), the formation of apoprotein (28.Bornheim L.M. Underwood M.C. Caldera P. Rettie A.E. Trager W.F. Wrighton S.A. Correia M.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 32: 299-308PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Correia M.A. Davoll S.H. Wrighton S.A. Thomas P.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 297: 228-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and the covalent alteration of the protein (30.Lunetta J.M. Sugiyama K. Correia M.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 10-17PubMed Google Scholar), all fail to enhance the proteolysis of the affected P450 cytochromes. In the case of nNOS, it is not known if heme-protein cross-links can lead to enhanced proteolytic degradation, and further studies are needed to define this pathway of nNOS heme alteration. We have found, however, that the functionally inactive monomeric form of the protein was preferentially ubiquitinated over the enzymatically active homodimer. Moreover, the slowly reversible inhibitor, NNA, stabilized the dimeric state of nNOS and decreased the extent of ubiquitination. This is consistent with the observation that NNA causes a slight increase in the amount of immunodetectable nNOS in vivo (31.Nakatsuka M. Nakatsuka K. Osawa Y. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1998; 26: 497-501PubMed Google Scholar) and slows the rate of proteolytic degradation of nNOS in HEK 293 cells (13.Noguchi S. Jianmongkol S. Bender A.T. Kamada Y. Demady D.R. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2376-2380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). That functionally inactive monomeric nNOS would be processed for removal is consistent with the recent postulate that ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation as well as chaperone-based folding and unfolding are mechanisms for cellular “quality control” of proteins (32.Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Gottesmann S. Science. 1999; 286: 1888-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). In this regard, our laboratory has also shown that inhibition of the hsp90-based chaperone system leads to the enhanced degradation of nNOS (7.Bender A.T. Silverstein A.M. Demady D.R. Kanelakis K.C. Noguchi S. Pratt W.B. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1472-1478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that under conditions where heme is not available for assembly of newly synthesized nNOS to functionally active homodimers in vivo that the excess monomeric nNOS would be ubiquitinated and proteolytically removed. Alternatively, the monomeric form of nNOS may form during autoinactivation of the holoenzyme (Fig.5). Thus, ubiquitination may be critical in regulating the level of monomeric nNOS in vivo. The amount of monomeric NOS may be important as a reserve pool of protein that could be rapidly assembled in the absence of protein synthesis to give the functional homodimer (33.Wolff D.J. Lubeskie A. Gauld D.S. Neulander M.J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 350: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The major ubiquitinated form of nNOS found in vitro andin vivo was a conjugate that did not greatly alter the relative mobility of nNOS, suggesting that only one or a few Ub are attached. It is likely that the limited ubiquitination of nNOS gives a more stable conjugate whereas the polyubiquitinated forms, which were only observed in cells treated with lactacystin, are rapidly proteolyzed. It is noteworthy that the major conjugate observed in rat brains was that containing only limited amounts of Ub. The lability of the polyubiquitinated forms may be a possible explanation for not detecting the polyubiquitinated conjugates in our in vitrostudies. The mono-ubiquitinated forms of proteins are thought to be involved in subcellular targeting (see Ref. 34.Hicke L. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 107-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar for review), and it would be important to further define if limited ubiquitination of nNOS is biologically important in this regard as a certain portion of nNOS exists in the membrane particulate fraction (35.Hecker M. Mulsch A. Busse R. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1524-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The sites on nNOS that serve to conjugate Ub are not known. It is likely that some structural change, which is related to inactivation and monomerization, serves to expose a lysine residue for Ub conjugation. For some proteins such as IκBα and the large subunit of RNA polymerase II, phosphorylation serves to initiate structural changes that lead to ubiquitination (36.Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar, 37.Mitsui A. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6054-6059Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In this regard, the phosphorylation of nNOS has been shown to occur on a serine residue and lead to the inhibition of the enzyme (38.Dawson T.M. Steiner J.P. Dawson V.L. Dinerman J.L. Uhl G.R. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9808-9812Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 39.Dinerman J.L. Steiner J.P. Dawson T.M. Dawson V. Snyder S.H. Neuropharmacology. 1994; 33: 1245-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Moreover, suicide-inactivated liver microsomal P450 cytochromes are phosphorylated prior to ubiquitination and degradation (23.Korsmeyer K.K. Davoll S. Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. Correia M.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 365: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, the elucidation of the structural features that predispose nNOS to ubiquitination will aid in understanding the post-translational events that govern the steady state levels of nNOS. The current report describes the ubiquitination of nNOS and the initial studies to define these structural features. We thank Bettie Sue Masters, Solomon Snyder, William Pratt, and Lance Pohl for providing cell lines, cDNAs, reticulocyte extracts, and antisera used in this work."
https://openalex.org/W2092660611,"Cleavage of osteopontin by thrombin has been reported to enhance cell adhesion. We asked whether thrombin could regulate the αvβ3-mediated adhesion of platelets and B lymphocytes to this substrate. Although there was no difference in the extent or the avidity of thrombin- and ADP-stimulated platelet adhesion to intact or thrombin-cleaved human osteopontin, both the extent and avidity of phorbol ester-stimulated B cell adhesion to thrombin-cleaved osteopontin was significantly increased. Thus, these data suggest that the ability of αvβ3 to recognize osteopontin can be differentially regulated in a cell-specific manner. To localize the αvβ3binding site on osteopontin, we measured cell adhesion to the two thrombin cleavage products of osteopontin and to a series of nested RGD-containing osteopontin peptides cross-linked to albumin. Whereas ADP-stimulated platelets adhered to the amino-terminal but not the carboxyl-terminal osteopontin fragment and to the osteopontin peptide RGDSVVYGLR, phorbol ester-stimulated B cells did not adhere to this peptide, although they did so in the presence of 1 mmMn2+. Thus, our data confirm that thrombin cleavage enhances the accessibility of the binding motif for αvβ3 on osteopontin, but this enhancement is also a function of the activation state of αvβ3. Moreover, they indicate that the sequence RGDSVVYGLR contains sufficient information to specify activation-dependent αvβ3-mediated platelet and lymphocyte adhesion. Cleavage of osteopontin by thrombin has been reported to enhance cell adhesion. We asked whether thrombin could regulate the αvβ3-mediated adhesion of platelets and B lymphocytes to this substrate.

Whereas ADP-stimulated platelets adhered to the amino-terminal but not the carboxyl-terminal osteopontin fragment and to the osteopontin peptide RGDSVVYGLR, phorbol ester-stimulated B cells did not adhere to this peptide, although they did so in the presence of 1 mmMn2+. Thus, our data confirm that thrombin cleavage enhances the accessibility of the binding motif for αvβ3 on osteopontin, but this enhancement is also a function of the activation state of αvβ3. Moreover, they indicate that the sequence RGDSVVYGLR contains sufficient information to specify activation-dependent αvβ3-mediated platelet and lymphocyte adhesion. osteopontin bovine serum albumin monoclonal antibody phorbol myristate acetate high pressure liquid chromatography matrix-assisted laser desorption time of flight The initial event in the formation of a hemostatic platelet plug or a platelet thrombus is platelet adhesion to components of the subendothelial matrix of a damaged blood vessel (1.Sixma J.J. Wester J. Semin. Hematol. 1977; 14: 265-299PubMed Google Scholar). The acidic phosphorylated glycoprotein osteopontin (OPN)1 is a component of the subendothelial matrix of blood vessels involved by atherosclerosis, in which it surrounds areas of dystrophic calcification. We reported that platelets and B lymphocytes adhere to OPN-coated surfaces and that their adhesion is mediated by the integrin αvβ3 (2.Bennett J.S. Chan C. Vilaire G. Mousa S.A. DeGrado W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8137-8140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Unlike other cells that adhere to OPN, however, the adhesion of platelets and B cells to OPN requires agonist stimulation (2.Bennett J.S. Chan C. Vilaire G. Mousa S.A. DeGrado W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8137-8140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), indicating that the activation state of αvβ3 on platelets and lymphocytes, like that of the homologous platelet integrin αIIbβ3, is regulated by cellular agonists. The most potent physiologic platelet agonist is thrombin (3.Coughlin S.R. Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that OPN contains a potential thrombin cleavage site six amino acids downstream from an RGDS motif (4.Denhardt D. Guo X. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar) and that thrombin cleavage has been reported to enhance the ability of OPN to support the attachment and spreading of a number of cultured cells in vitro (5.Senger D.R. Perruzzi C. Papadopoulos-Sergiou A. Van de Water L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We postulated that not only might thrombin regulate the activation state of platelet αvβ3, but it might also regulate the ability of OPN to serve as a substrate for platelet adhesion. To address this possibility, we cleaved recombinant human OPN with thrombin and compared the ability of the cleaved protein and the isolated cleavage products to support platelet adhesion. In addition, because agonist stimulation is also required to induce B cell adhesion to OPN, we examined the effect of thrombin cleavage on B cell adhesion. Recombinant human OPN was synthesized as a histidine-tagged fusion protein using the pET system (Novagen) as described previously (2.Bennett J.S. Chan C. Vilaire G. Mousa S.A. DeGrado W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8137-8140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, recombinant OPN was synthesized as insoluble inclusion bodies inEscherichia coli BL21(DES)pLysS, solubilized using 6m guanidine-HCl, and isolated by metal-chelate affinity chromatography on a Ni2+-NTA resin (His·Bind Resin, Novagen). Following elution from the resin using 20 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.9, containing 0.5 m NaCl and 500 mm imidazole, the recombinant OPN was renatured by dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. The apparent molecular weight of the recombinant protein determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was 58,000. Its weight determined by electrospray mass spectroscopy was 35,518, consistent with the calculated mass of the full-length osteopontin amino acid backbone (4.Denhardt D. Guo X. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar) plus the poly-histidine tag and Factor Xa cleavage site contributed by pET16b. Recombinant OPN was incubated with 0.32 unit of human α thrombin (a gift of Dr. Lawrence F. Brass) per μg of OPN at 37 °C for 30 min. Thrombin activity was then quenched using a 1.3-fold excess (unit/unit) of hirudin (Sigma). Complete OPN cleavage was verified by electrophoresis of the products of the cleavage reaction on a 0.1% SDS, 4–20% gradient polyacrylamide gel. As reported previously (5.Senger D.R. Perruzzi C. Papadopoulos-Sergiou A. Van de Water L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), thrombin cleaves OPN into two fragments with apparent molecular weights of 32,000 and 30,000 (Fig.1). OPN cleavage was detectable following incubation with as little thrombin as 0.1 unit/ml, but complete cleavage required thrombin concentrations of at least 10 units/ml. The OPN cleavage products were purified using reverse phase HPLC (series 1100 model, Hewlett Packard) on an analytical C4 column (Vydac). A linear AB gradient of 0.6% B/min at 1 ml/min was used in which solvent A was 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and solvent B was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 90% acetonitrile. Individual products were identified using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, amino acid analysis, and laser desorption mass spectrometry. Peptides overlapping the RGDS motif in the amino-terminal OPN cleavage fragment were synthesized using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry on an Applied Biosystems A433 peptide synthesizer. An Arg-preloaded Wang resin with a 0.33 mmol/g substitution level was used. After completion of the amino acid sequence, the peptidyl resins were treated for 2 h at room temperature with a cleavage mixture consisting of 90% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% thioanisole, 3% ethanedithiol, and 2% anisole. The crude peptides were then purified by HPLC (Dynamax, Rainin) using a preparative C18 column (Vydac) and a 0.6%/min acetonitrile gradient at a 15 ml/min flow rate. Fractions containing pure peptide were pooled and lyophilized. The peptides were determined to be homogeneous by analytical HPLC, and their calculated molecular weights were confirmed by MALDI-TOF spectrometry. Nested OPN peptides were also synthesized that contained the amino acid sequence GGCGG at their amino-terminal ends. The cysteine thiol was used as a handle to attach the peptides to thiopyridone-activated bovine serum albumin. Bovine serum albumin (Sigma) dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA at a concentration of 2 mg/ml was reacted with a 10-fold molar excess of the heterobifunctional cross-linker sulfosuccinimidyl-6-α-methyl-α(2-pyridyldithio)tolune hexanoate (Pierce). The reaction was stopped after 2 h by chromatography through a Sephadex G-25 m PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with the same buffer. Peptides at 0.2 mm were subsequently incubated with the activated BSA for 48 h at 4 °C. The stoichiometry of cross-linking was calculated after spectroscopically measuring the release of the cross-linking byproduct pyridine-2-thione at 343 nm (ε = 8080 ± 300m−1cm−1). The molar ratio of each OPN peptide to BSA was approximately 3, as determined using two separate preparations of activated BSA. 96-well flat-bottomed microtiter plates (Immulon 2, Dynatech) were coated with 5 μg/ml of recombinant intact OPN, thrombin-cleaved OPN, BSA, or various concentrations of peptide-BSA complexes, each dissolved in 50 mmNaHCO3 buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl. Unoccupied protein binding sites on the wells were then blocked with nonfat dried milk dissolved in the same buffer. One hundred-μl aliquots of suspensions of gel-filtered human platelets (∼2–5 × 106) in 4 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 135 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 5.6 mm glucose, 1 mm CaCl2, 3.3 mm NaH2PO4, and 0.35 mg/ml BSA were added to the protein-coated wells in the absence or presence of a platelet agonist. Following an incubation for 30 min at 37 °C without agitation, the plates were washed four times with 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, and the number of adherent platelets was measured using a colorimetric assay, as described previously (6.Bellavite P. Andrioli G. Guzzo P. Arigliano P. Chirumbolo S. Manzato F. Santonastaso C. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 444-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-stimulated adhesion of GM1500 B lymphocytes to OPN was measured as described previously (7.Loh E. Beaverson K. Vilaire G. Qi W. Poncz M. Bennett J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18631-18636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.5 × 105 lymphocytes, metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and suspended in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mmNaCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.1% glucose, and 1% BSA, were stimulated with 200 ng/ml PMA and added to the wells of the protein-coated microtiter plates. Following an incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the plates were washed four times with the lymphocyte suspension buffer, and adherent cells were dissolved using 2% SDS. The SDS solutions were then counted for 35S in a liquid scintillation counter. The statistical significance of differences in platelet or lymphocyte adhesion was determined using a t test for two samples assuming equal variance (Microsoft Excel 98 for the Macintosh). CD spectra were recorded with a model 62 DS spectropolarimeter (Aviv, Lakewood, NJ), using an 1 mm path length quartz cell. The cell holder was temperature controlled at 25 °C. The bandwidth was 1 nm, with a scan step of 1 nm and an averaging time of 10 s per point. The buffer was 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 1 mmCaCl2. The concentrations of peptide stock solutions were determined by the absorbance at 280 nm in H2O using an extinction coefficient of 1490 cm−1m−1 per tyrosine. Ellipticity is reported as mean residue molar ellipticity. One-dimensional proton NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker AMX 500 operating at a 500.13 MHz proton frequency. Peptides were studied at 1 mm in a 50 mm deuterated sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5. To test whether thrombin cleavage affects platelet adhesion to OPN-coated surfaces, we coated the wells of microtiter plates with equal quantities of intact OPN and thrombin-cleaved OPN and compared the adhesion of unstimulated and agonist-stimulated platelets to each substrate. As shown in Fig.2 A, whereas unstimulated platelets were unable to adhere to either intact or thrombin-cleaved OPN, equal numbers of thrombin-stimulated platelets readily adhered to each substrate. Nonetheless, it is possible that although the number of adherent platelets was not increased, thrombin cleavage may have increased the avidity of platelet adhesion instead. To test this possibility, we compared the ability of the tetrapeptide RGDS to inhibit platelet adhesion to each substrate, reasoning that there is a direct relationship between the IC50 of RGDS inhibition and the avidity of cell adhesion. However, we found no significant difference in the IC50 for RGDS (39.7 ± 11.9 and 34.6 ± 9.6 μm; n = 4;p = 0.75). Thrombin is the most potent physiologic platelet agonist (3.Coughlin S.R. Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), and it is conceivable that differences in the ability of intact and thrombin-cleaved OPN to support platelet adhesion might be apparent with a weaker agonist. To test this possibility, we repeated the experiments using ADP as the platelet agonist. However, as shown in Fig. 2 B, there was again no difference in the number of platelets adherent to either substrate (n = 7;p = 0.06), nor was there a significant difference in the IC50 for RGDS inhibition (13.2 ± 0.9 and 14.9 ± 1.1 μm; n = 3;p = 0.29). On the other hand, the platelets in these experiments were maximally stimulated by 10 μm ADP. To determine whether an effect of OPN cleavage might be observed at lower ADP concentrations, we measured platelet adhesion as a function of ADP concentration. As shown in Fig. 2 C, there was no difference in platelet adhesion to either substrate as the concentration of ADP was varied from 0.2 to 20 μm. Thus, in contrast to the behavior of a number of epithelial and mesenchymal cells (5.Senger D.R. Perruzzi C. Papadopoulos-Sergiou A. Van de Water L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), we found that thrombin cleavage increased neither the number of platelets that adhere to OPN nor the avidity of their adhesion. To determine which of the OPN fragments generated by thrombin cleavage supports platelet adhesion, the fragments were purified using reverse phase HPLC and examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig.3 A, the purified fragments had apparent molecular weights of 32,000 and 30,000, whereas MALDI-TOF spectroscopy indicated weights of 18,663 and 16,828, values corresponding to the calculated masses of the amino- and carboxyl-thrombin cleavage fragments of OPN, respectively. Amino acid analysis of the purified fragments confirmed their identity. The purified fragments were then immobilized on microtiter plates, and platelet adhesion to each was compared with platelet adhesion to intact OPN. As shown in Fig. 3 B, whereas unstimulated platelets were unable to adhere to intact OPN and either the amino-terminal or carboxyl-terminal OPN fragments, ADP-stimulated platelets adhered equally well to intact OPN and to the amino-terminal fragment. Adhesion to each was reduced to baseline levels by 5 mm RGDS. Thus, these experiments indicate that agonist-stimulated platelets recognize a sequence motif located in the amino-terminal half of the OPN molecule and suggest that this motif contains the sequence RGD. To identify the sequence motif in OPN that supports platelet adhesion, we synthesized a series of nested OPN-related peptides, the carboxyl termini of which corresponded to Arg-168 at the thrombin cleavage site. However, because we were unable to consistently immobilize these peptides on polystyrene, we synthesized a second series of peptides containing the sequence Gly-Gly-Cys-Gly-Gly at their amino termini (TableI), enabling us to cross-link the peptides to BSA using the bifunctional cross-linking reagent sulfosuccinimidyl-6-[α-methyl-α(2-pyridyldithio)tolune hexanoate at a stoichiometry of approximately 3 molecules of peptide per molecule of albumin. We then coated the wells of microtiter plates with either the modified albumin or albumin that had been incubated with cross-linking reagent in the absence of peptide and measured platelet adhesion to each of the surfaces.Table INested osteopontin-related peptidesGGCGGRGDSVVYGLR 168 10-merGGCGGTVDTYDGRGDSVVYGLR 168 17-merGGCGGELVTDFPTDLPATEVFTPVVPTVDTYDGRGDSVVYGLR 16838-mer Open table in a new tab We found that ADP-stimulated platelets adhered equally well to surfaces coated with albumin cross-linked to the 10-, 17-, or 38-residue OPN peptides (Fig. 4 A) but not to surfaces coated with albumin incubated with cross-linker in the absence of peptide (not shown). Platelet adhesion to these surfaces required agonist stimulation and was inhibited completely by EDTA and by the tetrapeptide RGDS, indicating that it was both divalent cation- and RGD-dependent. Moreover, it was unaffected by the αIIbβ3-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) A2A9 but was inhibited completely by the β3integrin-specific mAb 7E3, indicating that it was mediated by the integrin αvβ3. Thus, these experiments indicate that the OPN sequence RGDSVVYGLR is sufficient to support agonist-stimulated platelet adhesion and to differentiate between adhesion mediated by αvβ3 versusthat mediated by αIIbβ3. To determine whether αvβ3 on platelets could also interact with the peptides in solution, we measured the ability of the soluble peptides to inhibit platelet adhesion to surfaces coated with intact OPN. As shown in Fig. 4 B, each of the peptides inhibited platelet adhesion. IC50 values calculated from these data were similar, at 7.0, 4.2, and 2.4 μm. The platelets in these experiments were maximally stimulated by 10 μm ADP. To test whether differences in platelet adhesion to the three peptides might be apparent at lesser degrees of ADP stimulation, we measured adhesion as a function of ADP concentration. As shown in Fig. 5, there were no significant differences in platelet adhesion to each of the peptides as the concentration of ADP was increased from 0.2 to 10 μm. To address the possibility that differences might be seen at lower densities of immobilized peptide, the coating concentration of peptide-cross-linked albumin was varied from 0.25 to 200 μg/ml. Again, no substantial differences in platelet adhesion to the 10-, 17-, and 38-residue peptides were observed (data not shown). Because agonist-stimulated B lymphocytes also adhere to OPN-coated surfaces (2.Bennett J.S. Chan C. Vilaire G. Mousa S.A. DeGrado W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8137-8140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we asked whether thrombin cleavage might affect B cell adhesion to this substrate. As expected, there was little adhesion of unstimulated B cells to intact OPN, whereas PMA stimulation increased adhesion ∼4-fold (Fig.6 A). However, in contrast to the lack of effect of thrombin cleavage on platelet adhesion, thrombin cleavage resulted in a significant 2.1 ± 0.4-fold increase in the number of PMA-stimulated lymphocytes adherent to OPN (n= 9; p < 0.006). Moreover, as indicated by an increase in the IC50 for RGDS, thrombin cleavage also increased the avidity of B cell adhesion to OPN ∼6-fold (n = 8;p < 0.005). One possible explanation for the difference in the behavior of platelets and lymphocytes toward intact and thrombin-cleaved OPN is a difference in the agonist-induced activation state of αvβ3 on these cells. To address this possibility, we measured the adhesion of unstimulated B cells to intact and thrombin-cleaved OPN in the presence of increasing concentrations of MnCl2 because Mn2+ ions are thought to modulate the activation state of integrins by affecting the conformation of their extracellular domains (8.Kawaguchi S. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16279-16285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Bazzoni B. Hemler M.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 30-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6 B, increasing the MnCl2 concentration from 0.1 to 5 mm decreased the difference in lymphocyte adhesion to intact and thrombin-cleaved OPN such that there was no significant difference at MnCl2 concentrations >2 mm. Thus, these results suggest that in the presence of a sufficient stimulus, αvβ3 on lymphocytes can no longer distinguish between intact and thrombin-cleaved OPN. We next measured B cell adhesion to the nested OPN peptides cross-linked to albumin. As with platelets, there was no B cell adhesion to any of the peptides in the absence of agonist stimulation (Fig.7 A). Unlike the case with platelets, however, there was substantial PMA-stimulated adhesion to the 38-mer, but little adhesion, if any, to the 10- and 17-residue peptides. Adhesion to the 38-mer was prevented by the αvβ3-specific mAb LM609 and the β3-integrin-specific mAb 7E3 but was unaffected by the αIIbβ3-specific mAb A2A9, indicating that it was mediated by αvβ3. Adhesion was also prevented by chelating calcium with EDTA and by the presence of the tetrapeptide RGDS. To determine whether this result also applied to the peptides in solution, we compared their ability to inhibit B cell adhesion to intact OPN. As shown in Fig. 7 B, we found no substantial difference in the ability of the soluble peptides to inhibit lymphocyte adhesion to OPN. Calculated IC50 values for the 10-, 17-, and 38-residue peptides were 8.9, 16.2, and 13.5 μm, respectively. Thus, these experiments indicate that although the 10- and 17-residue peptides were able to interact with αvβ3, this interaction was insufficient to mediate cell adhesion when the peptides were immobilized. To determine whether these results were a function of the activation state of αvβ3, we measured the adhesion of unstimulated B cells to the immobilized 10-mer in the presence of increasing concentrations of Mn2+. As shown in Fig.8, adhesion increased from 0.4 to 38% as the Mn2+ concentration increased from 0.5 to 5 mm. Adhesion of cells in the presence of Mn2+was again inhibited by both LM609 and 7E3, confirming that it was mediated by αvβ3. Thus, these experiments indicate that αvβ3 on B cells can recognize the 10-residue peptide but suggest that its ability to do so is a function of its state of activation. To investigate structural features of the OPN peptides that might account for the data shown in Figs. 7 and 8, we used CD and NMR spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 9 A, CD spectra of the 10-, 17-, and 38-residue peptides did not reveal strong negative peaks at 208 and 222 nm, implying that none of the peptides contained substantial stretches of α-helix. It is noteworthy, however, that as the length of the peptides increased, the magnitude of the n – π* transition near 220 nm also increased. This suggests that the longer peptides may have some increased conformational order. To further characterize the conformation of the 38-mer, we recorded its one-dimensional NMR spectrum. As shown in Fig.9 B, the methyl region of the spectrum (0–1.5 ppm) revealed 12 resolved resonances, compared with the theoretical number of 20, suggesting that the peptide may have a partially folded structure in solution. However, two-dimensional NOESY spectra failed to show any long-range NOEs that would be indicative of a well defined tertiary structure (data not shown). Thus, the β structure in the 38-mer is only marginally stable, and the peptide appears to also adopt a population of unfolded conformations in solution.

Cell Res. 1998; 242: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), support cell adhesion to OPN. In most instances, these integrins bind constitutively to OPN, and this interaction requires the presence of an RGD motif located in the amino half of the OPN molecule (18.Xuan J. Hota C. Shigeyama Y. D'Errico J. Somerman M. Chambers A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 57: 680-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The RGD sequence in OPN is located in proximity to an Arg-Ser sequence that is susceptible to cleavage by thrombin. Senger et al. (5.Senger D.R. Perruzzi C. Papadopoulos-Sergiou A. Van de Water L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) reported that the adhesion, spreading, and migration of a variety of cultured cells on surfaces coated with OPN was increased by 2–5.5-fold following OPN cleavage by thrombin. In an extreme example of this phenomenon, HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells were unable to adhere to intact OPN, but readily attached following thrombin cleavage (5.Senger D.R. Perruzzi C. Papadopoulos-Sergiou A. Van de Water L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Similarly, Smith et al. (16.Smith L.L. Cheung H.K. Ling L.E. Chen J. Sheppard D. Pytela R. Giachelli C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28485-28491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) reported that α9β1-mediated adhesion to OPN requires thrombin cleavage. Because the adhesion of the cultured cells to OPN was also RGD-dependent, these data suggest that thrombin cleavage makes the RGD motif more accessible (5.Senger D.R. Perruzzi C. Papadopoulos-Sergiou A. Van de Water L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar,19.Senger D.R. Perruzzi C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1314: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In contrast to cultured epithelial and mesenchymal cells, the adhesion of platelets and B lymphocytes to intact OPN requires agonist stimulation (2.Bennett J.S. Chan C. Vilaire G. Mousa S.A. DeGrado W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8137-8140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Because OPN in plasma can be cleaved by thrombin during blood coagulation (20.Senger D.R. Perruzzi C.A. Gracey C.F. Papadopoulos A. Tenen D.G. Cancer Res. 1988; 15: 5770-5774Google Scholar), we postulated that thrombin might convert OPN into a more efficient adhesive substrate, perhaps enabling it to bypass the requirement for cell stimulation. However, we found that although platelets and B cells readily adhere to surfaces coated with thrombin-cleaved OPN, their adhesion remained agonist-dependent. Nevertheless, we did find striking differences in the ability of platelets and B cells to interact with the intact or thrombin-cleaved protein. Regardless of the agonist used, there was no difference in the ability of platelets to bind to either form of the protein, whereas both the extent and the avidity of phorbol ester-stimulated B cell adhesion to OPN were increased by thrombin cleavage. Thus, these data indicate that for some cells of hematopoietic origin, thrombin cleavage makes OPN a more efficient adhesion substrate. Our data also suggest that the ability of αvβ3 to recognize OPN can be differentially regulated and that this regulation is cell type-specific. The prototypic example of regulated integrin activity is platelet αIIbβ3. αIIbβ3is unable to bind soluble ligands such as fibrinogen in the absence of platelet stimulation, but its affinity for fibrinogen increases rapidly following platelet exposure to agonists such as ADP (21.Bennett J.S. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1996; 16: 31-36Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Stimulation by stronger agonists, such as thrombin, however, is necessary to enable αIIbβ3 to bind soluble fibronectin (10.Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9477-9482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the ability of αIIbβ3 to discriminate among ligands is regulated by the strength of the platelet stimulus. Unlike αIIbβ3, the integrin α4β1 binds constitutively to VCAM-1 and to the alternatively spliced fibronectin CS1 domain. Nevertheless, its ability to bind to these ligands can be modulated at the cellular level. For example, Masumoto and Hemler (22.Masumoto A. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 228-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Yednock et al. (23.Yednock T.A. Cannon C. Vandevert C. Goldbach E.G. Shaw G. Ellis D.K. Liaw C. Fritz L.C. Tanner L.I. J.

However, the variability could be largely eliminated by increasing the affinity of α4β1 for these ligands with Mn2+ or β1 integrin-activating mAbs (8.Kawaguchi S. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16279-16285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Bazzoni B. Hemler M.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 30-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), implying that α4β1 can display a range of cell-specific activation states. Similarly, Garcia et al. used a spinning disc device to apply hydrodynamic forces to adherent cells and found that although the interaction of α5β1 with fibronectin was constitutive, the force required to break α5β1-fibronectin bonds was sensitive to the activation state of α5β1 (24.Garcia A.J. Huber F. Boettiger D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10988-10993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the regulation of αvβ3 function resembles that of αIIbβ3. Byzova and Plow (25.Byzova T.V. Plow E.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 2081-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and Pamporiet al. (26.Pampori N. Hato T. Stupack D.G. Aidoudi S. Cheresh D.A. Nemerow G.R. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21609-21616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) reached similar conclusions after studying ligand binding to αvβ3 on endothelial and smooth muscle cells and JY B lymphoblasts, respectively. Nevertheless, like α4β1 function in leukocytes, we found substantial differences in the extent of agonist-stimulated αvβ3 activation in platelets and B cells. Thus, the αvβ3 on both ADP- and thrombin-stimulated platelets appeared to be present in a highly activated state such that it was unable to distinguish between cleaved and uncleaved OPN and was able to bind to each of the nested OPN peptides. By contrast, the interaction of αvβ3 on PMA-stimulated B cells with OPN was significantly augmented by thrombin cleavage, and it did not mediate cell adhesion to surfaces coated with the 10- and 17-residue peptides. Accordingly, it is possible that these peptides simply do not contain sufficient information to produce productive adhesion in the solid state; however, both readily supported αvβ3-mediated platelet adhesion, and the 10-mer supported B cell adhesion when the activation state of αvβ3 was enhanced by Mn2+. Adhesion assays preclude direct measurements of the affinity of αvβ3 on platelets and lymphocytes for OPN. Thus, it is conceivable that unlike endothelial and JY cells (25.Byzova T.V. Plow E.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 2081-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 26.Pampori N. Hato T. Stupack D.G. Aidoudi S. Cheresh D.A. Nemerow G.R. Shattil S.J. J. Biol.

Pampori et al. (26.Pampori N. Hato T. Stupack D.G. Aidoudi S. Cheresh D.A. Nemerow G.R. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21609-21616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) were unable to detect the binding of a patch-engineered mAb containing a 50-residue RGD-containing stretch from the adenovirus penton base (WOW-1) to thrombin-stimulated platelets, although the construct bound to antibody-activated αvβ3 on CHO cells and to αvβ3 on PMA-stimulated JY lymphoblasts. It is possible, however, that there is an insufficient amount of αvβ3 on platelets to detect WOW-1 binding using flow cytometry (27.Coller B.S. Seligsohn U. West S.M. Scudder L.E. Norton K.J. Blood. 1991; 78: 2603-2610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, they did not detect penton base binding to thrombin-stimulated platelets, suggesting that perhaps this protein is not a ligand for αvβ3 on platelets. On the other hand, we found that ADP-stimulated platelet adhesion to immobilized OPN was completely inhibited by soluble OPN with an IC50 of ∼9 μm (data not shown). Thus, these data suggest that agonist stimulation provided αvβ3 with access to soluble OPN, implying an increase in the affinity of αvβ3 for this ligand (8.Kawaguchi S. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16279-16285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Bazzoni B. Hemler M.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 30-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The studies using nested peptides provide considerable information regarding the specificity of β3 integrins for their ligands. The αvβ3-specific adhesion of agonist-stimulated platelets to the peptide RGDSVVYGLR indicates that this sequence contains sufficient information to differentiate between αvβ3 and αIIbβ3and to confer activation dependence to adhesion. This finding is particularly significant in view of the fact that αIIbβ3 is present at 100–1000-fold excess over αvβ3 in human platelets (27.Coller B.S. Seligsohn U. West S.M. Scudder L.E. Norton K.J. Blood. 1991; 78: 2603-2610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, examination of the secondary structure of this peptide and of the larger 17- and 38-residue peptides by CD spectroscopy indicated that they adopt flexible, random conformations in solution, although further examination of the 38-residue peptide by one-dimensional NMR revealed some evidence for a partially folded structure. Nonetheless, the NOESY spectra for this peptide clearly showed that the peptide has no well defined tertiary structure, but instead appears to adopt a condensed but nevertheless flexible conformation. It is possible to design highly rigid cyclic peptides with a very high affinity and specificity for αvβ3, presumably because the peptides are locked into conformations that closely match the conformation recognized by this integrin. For example, replacing a type II′ β turn with a type I β turn in the cyclic RGD peptide DMP728 results in a substantial decrease in the distance between the Arg and Asp side chains and a >10,000-fold increase in the selectivity of the compound for αvβ3 over αIIbβ3 (28.Bach A.C.I. Espina J.R. Jackson S.A. Stouten P.F.W. Duke J.L. Mousa S.A. DeGrado W.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 293-294Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it is clear that the ability of the 10-mer to differentiate between αvβ3 and αIIbβ3does not have a purely conformational basis. Rather, side chains within the carboxyl-terminal heptapeptide must account for this specificity. Activation of αvβ3 to an intermediate level was sufficient to mediate lymphocyte adhesion to the 38-mer, but not to the 10- and 17-residue peptides. This difference was not due to differences in binding affinity because the three peptides had similar IC50 values for inhibiting lymphocyte adhesion to intact OPN. The mechanism responsible for this effect is under investigation, but may involve selective “outside-in” activation by the longest peptide. This effect may also be conformational because the longest peptide showed evidence of a partially organized structure that may become consolidated following binding to αvβ3. Alternatively, the 38-mer may contain sequence information that is specifically required for triggering tight adhesion following the initial binding event.

Here we tested whether endogenous heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) accounts for the resistance of human cells. Stable transfection of the human beta cell line CM with an antisense hsp70 mRNA-expressing plasmid (ashsp70) caused selective suppression (>95%) of spontaneously expressed hsp70 but not of hsc70 or GRP75 protein. ashsp70 transfection abolished the resistance of CM cells to the NO donors (Z)-1- (2-(2-aminoethyl)-N-(2-ammonioethyl)amino)diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate and sodium nitroprusside and increased the proportions of necrotic cells 3–5-fold (p < 0.05) and of apoptotic cells about 2-fold (p < 0.01). Re-induction of hsp70 expression by heat shock re-established resistance to NO toxicity. hsp70 did not exert its protective effect at the level of membrane lipid integrity because radical induced lipid peroxidation appeared independent of hsp70 expression. However, after NO exposure only hsp70-deficient cells showed significantly decreased mitochondrial activity, by 40–80% (p < 0.01).

With these functions the hsps essentially contribute to the protection of vital cell components against injuries induced under conditions of physical (3.Li G.C. Li L. Liu Y.-K. Mak J.Y. Chen L.

A. 1996; 93: 6458-6463Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Among the hsps a special protective potential is attributed to the heat shock protein 70 (hsp70), which obviously plays a crucial role in the cellular defense against radical-induced injury. In insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells of rats up-regulation of hsp70 is associated with an improved resistance against NO, reactive oxygen species and the beta cell toxin streptozocin (6.Bellmann K. Wenz A. Radons J. Burkart V. Kleemann R. Kolb H. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2840-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Further evidence for the importance of hsp70 in beta cell defense comes from studies in which the selective overexpression of the hsp70 protein resulted in an improved resistance of rat insulinoma cells against NO (8.Bellmann K. Jäättelä M. Wissing D. Burkart V. Kolb H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), which has been identified as an important mediator of beta cell destruction in experimental systems of type 1 diabetes (9.Kolb H. Kolb-Bachofen V. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 157-160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 10.Kolb H. Kolb-Bachofen V. Diabetologia. 1992; 35: 796-797PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent findings indicate strong species-specific differences in the sensitivity of beta cells toward NO-induced toxicity. Whereas human beta cells are largely resistant, beta cells from rodents exhibit an increased susceptibility toward the damaging effects of NO (11.Eizirik D.L. Sandler S. Welsh N. Cetkovic-Cvrlje M. Niemann A. Geller D.A. Pipeleers D.G. Bendtzen K. Hellerström C. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1968-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The parallel finding of a considerably increased spontaneous expression of hsp70 in human beta cells compared with rodent beta cells (12.Eizirik D.L. Horm. Metabol. Res. 1996; 28: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) led to the suggestion that hsp70 contributes to the strong natural resistance of human beta cells against NO-induced damage (13.Eizirik D.L. Pipeleers D.G. Zhidong L. Welsh N. Hellerström C. Andersson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9253-9256Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). To prove this issue we established a human beta cell line in which the expression of hsp70 is selectively suppressed by transfection with a plasmid designed for the constitutive expression of antisense-hsp70 mRNA. Our experiments show that the selective inhibition of hsp70 expression results in an increased susceptibility of human beta cells toward NO-induced toxicity. The preservation of the respiratory activity in NO-exposed islet cells identified the mitochondria as the primary targets of hsp70-mediated protection. The study was performed with cells of the rat insulinoma line RINm5F (14.Chick W. Warren S. Chute R.N. Like A.A. Lauris V. Kitchen K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 628-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), the mouse beta cell line MIN-6 (kindly provided by Drs. J. Miyazaki, Y. Oka, H. Ishihara, Tokyo, Japan) (15.Miyazaki J.-I. Araki K. Yamato E. Ikegami H. Asano T. Shibasaki Y. Oka Y. Yamamura K.-I. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar), and the human beta cell line CM, which was originally isolated from tumor cells present in the ascitic fluid of a patient suffering from insulinoma (16.Gueli N. Toto A. Palmieri G. Carmenini G. Delfino A. Ferrini U. J. Exp. Clin. Cancer Res. 1987; 4: 281-285Google Scholar). The cells were cultivated (37 °C, 5% CO2) in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 125 mg/liter ampicillin, 75 mg/liter penicillin, 50 mg/liter streptomycin (Serva, GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany), 2 mmol/liter l-glutamine, 10 ml/liter 100x nonessential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.), 3.4 g/liter NaHCO3, 2.38 g/liter HEPES (pH 7.3, Serva), and 5% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) (culture medium). Cell cultures were regularly tested for the absence of mycoplasma contamination. The antisense (as) hsp70pcDNA3 plasmid was constructed by insertion of a 500-base pair fragment of the human inducible hsp70cDNA in antisense orientation (974–475) at the multiple cloning site downstream the cytomegalovirus promoter in the pcDNA3 vector (17.Jäättelä M. Wissing D. Kokholm K. Kallunki T. Egeblad M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6124-6134Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic expression vector pZEM-neo was used as control. This vector, with a size (6.3 kilobases) comparable to that of pcDNA3, also contains the neomycin resistance gene but lacks any fragment interfering with hsp70 transcripts. Transfection of the CM cells was performed by electroporation as described previously (8.Bellmann K. Jäättelä M. Wissing D. Burkart V. Kolb H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). CM cells (2 × 107) were resuspended in 800 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 40 μg of plasmid DNA and exposed to a double pulse (pulse 1: 330 V/cm, ∞ Ω, 1500 microfarads; pulse 2: 100 V/cm, 192 Ω, 900 microfarads) in a Cellject electroporation device (Eurogentec, Sart Tilman, Belgium). After electroporation the cells were seeded in cloning plates (Greiner, Solingen, Germany) in the presence of 1600 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). From the pool of the surviving G418-resistant cells single cell-derived clones were selected and expanded to a cell number sufficient for analysis by Western blot and for the in vitroexperiments. Proteins from lysates of CM cells cultivated under standard conditions or exposed to heat shock (42.5 °C, 60 min) (6.Bellmann K. Wenz A. Radons J. Burkart V. Kleemann R. Kolb H. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2840-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) were separated on 10% SDS- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated for 1 h with 1:1000 dilutions of a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against the inducible form of the human hsp70 (BIOMOL, Hamburg, Germany), a rat monoclonal antibody raised against the constitutive form of Chinese hamster heat shock protein 70 (hsc 70, BIOMOL) or a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for the human mitochondrial heat shock protein 70 (GRP 75, BIOMOL). The detection was performed with sheep peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse or anti-rat antibodies (1:10,000, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (8.Bellmann K. Jäättelä M. Wissing D. Burkart V. Kolb H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 18.Bellmann K. Hui L. Radons J. Burkart V. Kolb H. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 232-236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For flow cytometric analysis single cell suspensions of ashsp70-transfected cells and CM cells were fixed in methanol/acetone (30 min, 4 °C). The cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 18 h (4 °C) with a 1:150 dilution of the mouse anti-human hsp70 antibody (see Western blot analysis). After washing in PBS with 2% fetal calf serum the cells were incubated with a rat fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:60, Sigma) for 1 h. The cell suspension was washed again and resuspended in PBS with 2% fetal calf serum for flow cytometric analysis in a FACScan (Becton-Dickinson, San José, CA). Cells were seeded at a concentration of 1 × 105/200 μ l/well of 96-well culture plates (Falcon/Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) or laminin- (Sigma) coated chamber slides (Nunc, Naperville, IL) and incubated for 1 day (37 °C, 5%CO2). (Z)-1-(2-(2-Aminoethyl)-N-(2-ammonioethyl)amino)diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate) (ALEXIS, Grünberg, Germany) and sodium nitroprusside (NP, Sigma) served as NO-generating agents. NP was added in the presence of rhodanese and thiosulfate to scavenge cyanide ions eventually released during the decomposition process (19.Kallmann B. Burkart V. Kröncke K.-D. Kolb-Bachofen V. Kolb H. Life Sciences. 1992; 51: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Xanthine oxidase (EC 1.1.3.22, grade III from buttermilk, specific activity 1.2 units/mg protein, Sigma) and its substrate hypoxanthine (Sigma) were used to expose the cells to superoxide anion (O⨪2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (20.Burkart V. Koike T. Brenner H.-H. Kolb H. Diabetologia. 1992; 35: 1028-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The proportion of dead cells was determined by the trypan blue exclusion assay (19.Kallmann B. Burkart V. Kröncke K.-D. Kolb-Bachofen V. Kolb H. Life Sciences. 1992; 51: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) in 96-well flat bottom plates (Falcon/Becton-Dickinson). After incubation under various conditions, 150 μl of the culture supernatant were removed from each well and 15 μl of a trypan blue solution (0.4% in PBS) were added, and the cells were incubated for another 15 min (37 °C, 5% CO2). Then 200 cells were counted in adjacent microscopic fields in each well, and the percentage of dead cells from the total cell number was calculated. To investigate the reactivity of CM cells toward glucose stimulation the cells were cultivated in medium containing 16.7 mm glucose. After 0, 4, and 24 h the cells were disrupted by ultrasound treatment, and insulin was extracted by incubation of the cell lysates in acidified ethanol (75% ethanol, 1.5% HCl (12 m), 23.5% H2O) for 18 h at 4 °C. The insulin contents of the ethanol extracts were determined by a microparticle enzyme immunoassay insulin kit (IMX, ABBOTT Diagnostics, Wiesbaden, Germany). The insulin concentrations were quantified by the use of standard preparations of human insulin included in the IMX kit. The metabolic activity of the cells was assessed by their capacity to convert 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, Sigma) into its formazan product. Recent studies demonstrated that this reaction reflects metabolic processes that mainly depend on the activity of mitochondrial redox processes, such as the activity of succinate dehydrogenase (21.Janjic D. Wollheim C.B. Diabetologia. 1992; 35: 482-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 22.Segu V. Li G. Metz S.A. Metabolism. 1998; 47: 824-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). After termination of the various treatments 25 μl of the MTT stock solution (5 mg/ml) were added to each well (100 μl) of the cultivated cells. After 4–5 h of incubation (37 °C, 5% CO2) the supernatant was removed and the formazan crystals were dissolved in 100 μl of isopropanol. The OD was measured at 550 nm with 650 nm as the reference wavelength in an Emax precision 96-well microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corporation, Graefeling, Germany) (20.Burkart V. Koike T. Brenner H.-H. Kolb H. Diabetologia. 1992; 35: 1028-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For the detection of apoptotic alterations of cell nuclei the cells were cultivated on laminin-coated chamber slides. After exposure to NO (48 h, 37 °C, 5% CO2) 10 μl of a solution of acridin orange (3 mm, Serva) was added to each well. The supernatant was removed, and the cells were observed under the fluorescence microscope (526 nm). The percentage of cells containing two or more apoptotic bodies was calculated from the total cell number. At least 200 cells/sample were counted in triplicates. DNA fragmentation analysis was performed by the use of the InViSorb Apoptosis Detection Kit (InViTek, Berlin, Germany). Cells (2 × 105/200 μl) were seeded in the wells of 96-well flat bottom microtiter plates and exposed to NO. After 72 h the cells were lysed, and the released DNA was bound to a mineral carrier material. The fixed DNA was washed over a column (12,000 × g, 2 min) and eluted by incubation in elution buffer (2 min), followed by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 1 min). The DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis on an agarose gel (2%, Metaphor, FMC Bioproducts, Rockland, ME) containing ethidium bromide and visualized by UV exposure. DNA isolated from apoptotic murine thymocytes included in the InViSorb kit was used as a positive control for a ladder-like DNA fragmentation pattern. Lipid peroxidation was assessed by measurement of malondialdehyde (MDA). The cells (2 × 106 in 10 ml) were seeded in Petri dishes and incubated for 24 h in the presence of NP (0.6 mm). To induce lipid peroxidation in the cells FeCl3 (0.1 mm) and ascorbate (0.25 mm) were used as a positive control. Then the cells were scraped from the Petri dishes in the presence of butylhydroxytoluol (Sigma), disrupted by sonification and frozen at −20 °C until use. To 1 ml of the cell lysate 0.35 ml of 20% trichloroacetic acid (Sigma) and 0.5 ml of 1.4% (w/v) thiobarbituric acid (Merck) were added. After heating (15 min, 95 °C) the samples were centrifuged (5 min, 250 × g), and 2 ml of the supernatant were mixed with 2 ml of 1-butanol. The resulting thiobarbituric acid-MDA complex was separated on reversed-phase HPLC and quantitated with a fluorescence detector (excitation 515 nm, emission 553 nm) (23.Lepage G. Munoz G. Champagne J. Roy C.C. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 197: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Statistical differences were calculated using the Student's t test with a significance level ofp < 0.05. The study was performed to investigate the role of hsp70 in the natural resistance of human beta cells against damage induced by reactive radicals. For the experiments, cells of the human insulinoma line CM were used, which was maintained under tissue culture conditions since its isolation from an insulinoma patient. To confirm the beta cell characteristics of this cell line, the insulin contents of the cells was determined before and after stimulation by an increased glucose level in the culture medium. As shown in TableI the CM cells contained measurable amounts of insulin (8.5 microunits/106 cells) and were able to release the stored hormone in a time-dependent manner in response to stimulation with an elevated glucose concentration.Table IEffect of glucose stimulation on insulin contents of CM cellsDuration of stimulationInsulin contentshmicrounits/10 6 cells08.5 ± 2.780.4 ± 0.2240.05 ± 0.04CM cells were incubated at 16.7 mm glucose, and after 0, 8, and 24 h of stimulation their insulin content was determined by measuring the amount of immunoreactive insulin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data show mean ± S.D. from three determinations. Open table in a new tab CM cells were incubated at 16.7 mm glucose, and after 0, 8, and 24 h of stimulation their insulin content was determined by measuring the amount of immunoreactive insulin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data show mean ± S.D. from three determinations. To compare the sensitivity of human and rodent beta cells to radical-induced injury, CM cells and cells of the rat line RINm5F and of the mouse line MIN-6 were exposed to NO and reactive oxygen species generating agents for 18 h. Both agents dose dependently damaged cell functions as determined by the MTT test. The human insulinoma cell line showed a significantly improved metabolic activity in the presence of the NO donor NP (Fig. 1 A) as well as after exposure to the O⨪2/H2O2 generating system hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase (Fig. 1 B) compared with the insulinoma cells from mouse and rat (p < 0.05 andp < 0.005, respectively). Next we analyzed for spontaneous expression of hsp70 in untreated cells. Western blot analysis revealed spontaneous expression of hsp70 in human CM cells, whereas the rodent cells contained almost undetectable amounts of the protein (inset in Fig. 1 B). Both rodent cell lines expressed hsp70 in response to heat stress (not shown). To investigate the role of hsp70 in the enhanced natural resistance of the human insulinoma cells against NO radicals, the expression of hsp70 protein was suppressed in CM cells by transfection with a plasmid expressing an antisense hsp70 mRNA. The efficiency and the selectivity of the antisense strategy was proven by Western blot analysis. Transfection of the CM cells with the ashsp70 construct resulted in a 15-fold reduction of hsp70 expression in cells cultivated under standard conditions (37 °C, 5% CO2), whereas cells transfected with the control plasmid pZEM showed an hsp70 protein expression comparable to the level in the untransfected controls (TableII). Expression of the antisense construct did not influence the morphology and growth rate of the cells. Exposure of the cells to heat shock (42.5 °C, 60 min) 4 h prior to protein extraction resulted in a significant increase of the hsp70 signal in all three cell lines tested. In the control lines (CM and pZEM-transfected CM) the hsp70 signal increased about 1.7-fold. Interestingly, heat shock induced a more than 30-fold increase of the hsp70 signal also in ashsp70-transfected cells thereby reaching a level of expression comparable to the control cells (Table II). The deficient expression of hsp70 in the antisense line was also confirmed by cytofluorometry. As shown in Fig. 2, there was a reduction of the fluorescence activity in ashsp70-transfected cells yielding a single peak, which indicated homogeneously reduced hsp70 expression in antisense plasmid-transfected cells.Table IIhsp70 protein expression in untransfected, ashsp70-transfected, and pZEM-transfected CM cellsCM cells untransfectedCM cells ashsp70 transfectedCM cells pZEM transfectedUntreated354.9 ± 20.220.4 ± 10.2ap < 0.01 compared to the signal of untransfected CM cells or the pZEM-transfected cells.319.8 ± 23.5Heat shock treated570.9 ± 27.1bp < 0.01 versus the signal of the corresponding samples without heat shock treatment.682.1 ± 18.7bp < 0.01 versus the signal of the corresponding samples without heat shock treatment.571.1 ± 24.7bp < 0.01 versus the signal of the corresponding samples without heat shock treatment.Untransfected, ashsp70-transfected, and pZEM-transfected CM cells remained untreated or were exposed to heat shock (42.5 °C, 60 min).

The data show densitometrical units (mean ± S.D.) from scans of three experiments. Because the constitutively expressed hsc70 and the mitochondrial GRP75 have a high amino acid sequence homology with hsp70, we investigated whether the expression of these proteins was impaired in cells transfected with ashsp70. As shown in Fig.3 (lane 1) the CM cells spontaneously express hsp70, hsc70, and GRP75. Transfection with the ashsp70 construct strongly reduced the expression of hsp70, whereas the signal strengths of hsc70 and GRP75 remained unchanged (lane 2). CM cells transfected with the control plasmid pZEM expressed the same levels of hsp70, hsc70, and GRP75 as the wild type CM cells (lane 3). After heat shock treatment a strong increase mainly of the hsp70 protein expression was observed in all three cell lines (lanes 4 -6). To investigate whether the suppression of spontaneous hsp70 protein expression by the antisense plasmid would increase the sensitivity of the CM cells toward NO radical-induced injury, the cell lines were exposed to the NO donors NP (Fig.4 A) and DETA/NO (Fig.4 B). As an end point of necrotic cell death, the irreversible loss of membrane integrity was determined by the inability of the cells to exclude trypan blue. Within the first 24 h of NO exposure the rates of cell death slightly increased up to 5–10% (Fig.4, A and B). No significant difference in sensitivity could be observed between the ashsp70-transfected cells and the cells transfected with the control plasmid. Prolongation of the exposure time resulted in a steady increase of the death rate in the control cells up to a maximum of 10% after 48 h. In contrast, ashsp70-transfected cells showed a strongly accelerated death rate reaching 50% in the NP- (0.6 mm) exposed cells and more than 30% in the DETA/NO- (0.2 mm) exposed cells (p < 0.05 compared with the specific lysis of the pZEM-transfected cells after 48 h). These findings clearly show an increased susceptibility toward NO-induced necrosis in cells with suppressed spontaneous hsp expression. To further prove the role of hsp70 we tested the hypothesis that the (re-)induction of hsp70 protein in ashsp70-transfected CM cells by heat shock exposure (Fig. 3) will re-establish the resistance of the cells toward NO-induced damage. In fact, heat shock treatment resulted in a significant reduction of DETA-NO-induced lysis of ashsp70-transfected cells from 38.4 to 12.0% for 0.1 mm DETA-NO and from 55.6 to 17.3% for 0.2 mm DETA-NO (p < 0.01, Fig. 5). Heat shock did not improve the resistance of untransfected and pZEM-transfected CM cells that constitutively express hsp70. In parallel samples the effect of hsp70 expression on the NO-induced apoptotic pathway of cell death was examined by analyzing nuclear chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation. As shown in Fig. 6exposure to NO resulted in an increased proportion of cells showing apoptotic alterations. Acridin orange staining revealed condensation of nuclear chromatin and formation of apoptotic bodies in a significantly higher percentage of ashsp70-transfected CM cells (24.0 ± 0.5%) (Fig. 6 A) when compared with identically treated cells transfected with the control plasmid pZEM (13.8 ± 2.2%) (p < 0.05). In the untreated samples, about 4% of the cells formed apoptotic bodies. To investigate the mode of DNA degradation, DNA was isolated from ashsp70-transfected CM cells and controls after 72 h of NO exposure. After separation of the DNA by electrophoresis a ladder-like fragmentation pattern was clearly visible in ashsp70-transfected cells (lane 3), whereas only faint signals of DNA degradation were detectable in untransfected CM cells (lane 1) and in CM cells transfected with the control plasmid pZEM (lane 4) (Fig. 6 B). These observations indicate that suppression of spontaneous hsp70 expression increased the susceptibility of the CM cells toward NO-induced apoptosis. Exposure to NO radicals may lead to cell injury via the formation of toxic compounds from cellular components. It has been suggested that lipid peroxides mediate radical toxicity in islet cells (24.Rabinovitch A. Suarez W.L. Thomas P.D. Strynadka K. Simpson I. Diabetologia. 1992; 35: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 25.Rabinovitch A. Suarez-Pinzon W.L. Strynadka K. Lakey J.R. Rajotte R.V. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 3197-3202PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it was analyzed whether hsp70-mediated protection from NO toxicity affects lipid peroxidation. As a measure of lipid peroxidation, we determined MDA. CM cells transfected with the ashsp70 plasmid or the pZEM control plasmid were incubated in the presence of the NO donor NP or the potent reactive oxygen species generating system FeCl3 and ascorbate. As expected, HPLC analysis of the cell lysates revealed a strong accumulation of MDA (about 8800 nm/106 cells) in cells exposed to FeCl3/ascorbate for 24 h (Fig.7). In contrast, NP-exposed cells showed only a slight, but significant (p < 0.05) increase to 0.86 nm MDA/106 cells compared with untreated cells (0.07 nm MDA/106 cells). However, the analysis of the ashsp70-transfected cells and the pZEM transfected CM cells did not reveal any difference in the degree of lipid peroxidation in response to either NO or reactive oxygen species (Fig. 7). Because the mitochondrial respiratory system and energy metabolism in general were found to be highly susceptible to NO radicals, it was determined whether hsp70 might exert its protective action at this level. CM cells transfected with the ashsp70 construct and with the control plasmid pZEM were incubated for 24 h in the presence of increasing doses of NP or DETA/NO, and after different time intervals the residual metabolic activity was assessed by the capacity of the cells to reduce MTT into its formazan product (Fig.8). In CM cells transfected with pZEM, the metabolic activity was decreased by 40% after exposure to NP, and no significant changes were noted after DETA/NO exposure. In contrast, the ashsp70-transfected CM cells showed a significantly decreased capacity to convert MTT after 24 h of exposure to either NP or DETA/NO (p < 0.01). In an additional sample CM cells were used, which derived from the pool of ashsp70-transfected cells after selection for G418 resistance but before selection of clones. After NO exposure (0.6 mm NP) these cells showed a significant reduction of mitochondrial activity to a level comparable to th"

Such DNAs/RNAs are a new class of potential chemotherapeutics that could block the enzymatic activity of pathologically relevant proteins. We have conducted a detailed biochemical study of the interaction of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) with a SELEX-derived pseudoknot RNA aptamer. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy of site-directed spin-labeled RT mutants revealed that this aptamer was selected for binding to the “closed” conformation of the enzyme. Kinetic analysis showed that the RNA inhibitor bound to HIV RT in a two-step process, with association rates similar to those described for model DNA/DNA and DNA/RNA substrates. However, the dissociation of the pseudoknot RNA from RT was dramatically slower than observed for model substrates. Equilibrium binding studies revealed an extraordinarily lowK d, of about 25 pm, for the enzyme-aptamer interaction, presumably a consequence of the slow off-rates. Additionally, this pseudoknot aptamer is highly specific for HIV-1 RT, with the closely related HIV-2 enzyme showing a binding affinity close to 4 orders of magnitude lower.

The enzyme consists of an asymmetric heterodimer of two subunits, p66 and p51, possessing RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase and RNase H activities. The small subunit, p51, is derived from p66 by proteolytic cleavage of the C-terminal domain. Several x-ray structures of RT have been determined showing structural changes of the enzyme depending on whether the protein is bound to inhibitors, bound to substrates, or unliganded (for a recent review, see Ref. 1.Jäger J. Pata J.D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The overall fold of the p66 subunit has been compared with a right hand, consisting of subdomains termed fingers, palm, thumb, connection, and RNase H. RT is one of the main targets in the fight against AIDS. Drugs currently in use include nucleoside inhibitors, such as AZT, 3TC, ddI, ddC, d4T, as well as non-nucleoside inhibitors, such as nevirapine, delavirdine, and efavirenz, all of which target RT (for a review, see Ref. 2.De-Clercq E. I/Farmaco. 1999; 54: 26-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). However, severe side effects and the rapid emergence of drug resistant mutants compromise the efficacy of these drugs. Recently, significant progress has been achieved by applying multidrug combination therapy (for a review, see Ref. 3.Vandamme A.M. Van Laethem K. De-Clercq E. Drugs. 1999; 57: 337-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In this therapy, at least two drugs against RT and one against the retroviral protease are taken simultaneously. Nevertheless, the underlying problems of this kind of chemotherapeutic treatment remain the same, urgently calling for alternative strategies to deal with viral infections such as AIDS. Many different strategies have been discussed without, so far, leading to a genuine alternative to the currently used anti-AIDS drugs. However, one promising alternative approach could be the application of nucleic acid aptamers derived using in vitro selection. Aptamers bind with high affinity as well as specificity to their target proteins, often eliminating enzymatic activity (for a review, see Ref.4.Gold L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13581-13584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Tuerk and Gold (5.Tuerk C. Gold L. Science. 1990; 249: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (7993) Google Scholar) have used SELEX to identify RNA aptamers against the HIV-1 RT. The analysis of the isolated aptamers revealed a consensus sequence that resulted in the formation of an RNA pseudoknot (6.Tuerk C. Macdougal S. Gold L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6988-6992Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The interactions between SELEX RNA pseudoknots and HIV-1 RT have been analyzed in some detail using biochemical studies and chemical modification (7.Green L. Waugh S. Binkley J.P. Hostomska Z. Hostomsky Z. Tuerk C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 8.Burke D.H. Scates L. Andrews K. Gold L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 650-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Pseudoknots are defined as loop regions base pairing with complementary sequences, outside the loop, in the same RNA molecule (9.Rietveld K. Van Poelgeest R. Pleij C.W. Van Boom J.H. Bosch L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 1929-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 10.Studnicka G.M. Rahn G.M. Cummings I.W. Salser W.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 3365-3387Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The pseudoknot fold is a widespread structural motif found in all kinds of RNA, including coding and noncoding regions of cellular mRNAs, viral RNAs, ribosomal RNAs, and small nuclear RNAs. Although not all of the functions of this RNA secondary structure motif are fully understood, pseudoknots play an important role in ribosomal frameshifting, in transcriptional read-through, as internal ribosomal entry sites, and as translational enhancers, and they are key components of ribozymes (11.Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Zhou K.H. Doudna J.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) and cis-acting elements important for the initiation of viral replication (for a review, see Ref. 12.Deiman B.A.L.M. Pleij C.W.A. Semin. Virol. 1997; 8: 166-175Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Several NMR studies and one high resolution x-ray study of pseudoknots have been reported (13.Puglisi J.D. Wyatt J.R.

Biol. 1999; 6: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of HIV-1 RT complexed with an RNA pseudoknot inhibitor has been solved recently (see Fig.1) (20.Jäger J. Restle T. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4535-4542Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This is the first example of an x-ray structure of such an pseudoknot aptamer bound to its target protein. The RNA ligand binding surface lies within the nucleic acid cleft of the enzyme, between the polymerase and RNaseH active sites, and partially overlapping the binding surface of duplex DNA substrates. The pseudoknot is kinked by 60° from the co-axial stacking of stems 1 and 2, thus optimizing the extensive contacts between the RNA inhibitor and both subunits of the heterodimeric enzyme. The protein-RNA interaction stabilizes the “closed” conformation of the enzyme, in which the fingers and thumb domains of the large subunit are in close contact. Further, we suggested that the SELEX procedure appears to have identified an RNA molecule whose uncomplexed solution structure is very similar to its structure when bound to RT and which binds to the unliganded conformation of RT. Here we present the first detailed biochemical study of the this enzyme-inhibitor interaction. Using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy of site-directed spin-labeled RT mutants, we show that the relative positions of the fingers and thumb domains of the large subunit are virtually indistinguishable whether or not RNA is bound. This proves, for the first time, that RT in solution can adopt the closed conformation seen in the x-ray structure by Rodgers et al. (21.Rodgers D.W. Gamblin S.J. Harris B.A. Ray S. Culp J.S. Hellmig B. Woolf D.J. Debouck C. Harrison S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1222-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) and might be an important feature of selecting for tight binding ligands. An analysis of the binding equilibrium of the protein-inhibitor complex revealed astonishingly tight binding, with aK d in the low picomolar range, about 2–3 orders of magnitude lower than the K d of about 5 nm reported earlier by Tuerk et al. (6.Tuerk C. Macdougal S. Gold L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6988-6992Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, this is the first report of a SELEX-derived RNA ligand showing such a tight binding for a known nucleic acid binding target protein. To label RT with either spin labels or fluorophors in a site-directed manner, the naturally occurring cysteines had to be replaced by serines, and cysteines had to be introduced at the desired positions. In a first step, the mutant RT p66C38S/C280S/p51C280S was generated. The cysteine at position 38 in the small subunit is not solvent-accessible and consequently does not interfere with site-directed labeling. 2O. Kensch, unpublished data. In a second step, cysteines at certain positions were introduced as described below. Mutant RT was prepared by site-directed mutagenesis using polymerase chain reaction (22.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6824) Google Scholar). The mutations were introduced into the plasmids pRT166 (23.Müller B. Restle T. Weiss S. Gautel M. Sczakiel G. Goody R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13975-13978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and p6HRT51 (24.Le Grice S.F. Naas T. Wohlgensinger B. Schatz O. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3905-3911Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The plasmids thus generated were transformed into Escherichia coli M15/pDMI.1 (25.Certa U. Bannwarth W. Stüber D. Gentz R.

EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3051-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), resulting in expression systems for mutated p66 and mutated His-tagged p51. Recombinant heterodimeric wild type HIV-1, HIV-2, and equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) RT were expressed in E. coli and purified as described before (23.Müller B. Restle T. Weiss S. Gautel M.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12144-12152Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Enzyme concentrations were routinely determined using an extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 260,450 (HIV-1 RT), 238,150 (HIV-2 RT), and 223,180 m−1cm−1 (EIAV RT). The purified RTs were free of nuclease contamination. Mutant RTs were purified according to a protocol described previously (28.Wöhrl B.M. Krebs R. Thrall S.H. Le Grice S.F.J. Scheidig A.J. Goody R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17581-17587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Co-homogenization of E. coli cells expressing p66 or p51 led to reconstruction of heterodimeric p66/p51 RT. Analysis of the mutant proteins by a standard RT assay (see below) showed indistinguishable polymerase activity as compared with the wild type enzyme. Spin labeling of the introduced cysteine residues at positions 24 and 287 in p66 was achieved by the following procedure. In order to reduce any disulfide bonds, 2 μl of 1 m DTT was added to 200 μl of a 44 μm solution of mutant RT (p66W24C/C38S/C280S/K287C/p51C280S) in Buffer A. After 30 min at 4 °C, a 2-fold excess of 18/36-mer DNA/DNA p/t was added to the solution. The resulting RT-p/t complex was separated from excess DTT using a Sephadex G25 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The eluted complex was collected in a tube containing 2 μl of 100 μm(1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-3-methyl)methane-thiosulfonate (Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc.) in Me2SO. After 16 h at 4 °C, excess spin label and bound p/t were removed by purifying the enzyme over a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose column (Qiagen). The bound protein was washed extensively with a buffer containing 1 m NaCl and eluted with 0.3 mimidazole. Subsequently, the protein solution was concentrated, and buffer was changed (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol) using centrifugal filters (Millipore). Finally, samples were shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The labeled cysteine/RT ratio, estimated from double integration of the EPR spectra and absorption measurements of protein (280 nm), was found to be > 90%. Analysis of the spin-labeled protein by a standard RT assay (see below) shows polymerase activity that was indistinguishable from that of wild type enzyme. The labeling of the HIV-1 RT mutant (p66C38S/C280S/p51C280S/K281C) used for the fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments at position p51281C with the fluorophor Alexa488 was performed according to the instructions given by the manufacturer (Molecular Probes). Equilibrium as well as kinetic measurements of DNA/DNA p/t binding to this fluorescently labeled RT gave similar values to those obtained for the wild type protein (data not shown). The 33-nucleotide pseudoknot RNA (sequence, 5′-GGGAGAUUCCGUUUUCAGUCGGGAAAAACUGAA) was prepared in a standard 10-ml T7 reaction mixture for in vitro transcription and purified by gel electrophoresis as described previously (20.Jäger J.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13349-13358Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The RNA was refolded at a concentration of 200–300 μm at 65 °C for 5 min followed by slow cooling to room temperature in 20 mm cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5, 25 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2. 5′-End labeling of the RNA with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) was performed as described previously (30.Krebs R. Immendorfer U. Thrall S.H. Wöhrl B.M. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10292-10300Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of the in vitrotranscribed RNA prior to end labeling was carried out according to standard procedures (31.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). The fluorescent-labeled 5′-hexachlorofluorescein (HEX) pseudoknot RNA was synthesized and high pressure liquid chromatography-purified as described previously (32.McGregor A. Murray J.B. Adams C.J.

This chemically synthesized RNA consists of 28 residues missing the last 5 nucleotides at the 5′-end. Final purity was > 97% as assessed by high pressure liquid chromatography. Protein-RNA interactions were routinely analyzed at 25 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, and 10 mmMgCl2 (standard buffer). Additionally, some of the experiments were also performed in a buffer containing 200 mm KOAc, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, and 10 mm DTT (6.Tuerk C. Macdougal S. Gold L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Protein and 5′-32P-labeled RNA were mixed in standard buffer and incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. An aliquot of this mixture was filtered under suction through a prewet (standard buffer) nitro-cellulose filter (Schleicher & Schuell BA85) and rinsed with 4 ml of standard buffer. Radioactivity retained on the filters was measured by scintillation counting. The affinity of the different RTs for the pseudoknot RNA was measured both by displacing a fluorescently labeled 18/36-mer DNA/DNA p/t bound to RT and by titrating increasing amounts of RT with 5′-HEX-labeled RNA. The fluorescently labeled DNA-primer was synthesized by coupling the phosphoroamidite dye 6-carboxyfluorescein, a fluorescein derivative, directly to the 5′-end of the oligodeoxynucleotide during DNA synthesis according to the recommendation of the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems). The titrations were performed using an SLM AB2 spectrofluorometer. To monitor the fluorescence change upon displacing the labeled p/t from RT, the samples were excited at 492 nm, and the emission intensity was measured at 516 nm. These competitive titrations were evaluated using the program Scientist (MicroMath), which allows the user to define the system under investigation as a series of parallel equations defining (in this case) each discrete equilibrium, the relationship between the total and free concentrations of the components, and the way in which the observable signal is generated. The K d of the 18/36-mer DNA/DNA p/t was determined independently (30.Krebs R. Immendorfer U. Thrall S.H. Wöhrl B.M. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10292-10300Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 35.Divita G. Müller B. Immendörfer U. Gautel M. Rittinger K. Restle T. Goody R.S.

To monitor the fluorescence change upon binding of RT to the 5′-HEX-labeled pseudoknot RNA, the samples were excited at 538 nm, and the emission intensity was measured at 556 nm. Data were fitted to a quadratic equation analogous to the one given by Müller et al. (36.Müller B. Restle T. Reinstein J. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3709-3715Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) using the program Grafit (Erithacus Software). Values for the dissociation constant (K d), the amplitude of the fluorescence change, and the RNA concentration were allowed to vary during the fit procedure. Experiments on the kinetics of the association of HIV-1 RT with the pseudoknot RNA were performed using a stopped flow apparatus (High Tech Scientific, Salisbury, United Kingdom). 25 nmAlexa488-labeled HIV-1 RT (final concentration) was rapidly mixed with increasing 5′-HEX-labeled pseudoknot RNA concentrations (50–300 nm). Collection and analysis of the data was done as described previously (27.Souquet M. Restle T. Krebs R. Legrice S.F.J. Goody R.S. Wöhrl B.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12144-12152Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 30.Krebs R. Immendorfer U. Thrall S.H. Wöhrl B.M. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10292-10300Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Excitation of the Alexa488-labeled protein was at 435 nm and detection of the donor quenching due to fluorescence resonance energy transfer to the HEX-fluorophor was through a bandpass filter (520 nm). Data were fitted using a double exponential equation. The rate of the first phase (k +1) is dependent on the concentration of RT and corresponds to the formation of the collision complex. The rate of the second phase (k +2) is largely concentration-independent and arises from a conformational change of the RT-RNA complex after formation of the collision complex. Continuous wave EPR experiments were performed using home made X-band EPR spectrometers equipped with a dielectric resonator (Bruker) or with an H103 cavity (AEG). The magnetic field was measured with a B-NM 12 B-field meter (Bruker). Spin-labeled RT samples were loaded into EPR quartz capillaries (50 μl for low temperature measurements, otherwise 5 μl) at a final RT concentration of 100–200 μm. Spectra were recorded with a modulation amplitude of 1.5 G, and the microwave power was adjusted to between 0.2 and 0.6 mW. A modified Oxford ESR 9 variable temperature accessory allowed stabilization of the sample temperature between 80 and 330 K. The whole apparatus was controlled by a personal computer, which also performed 12 bit analog-to-digital data acquisition. EPR powder spectra simulations were performed according to the method described by Steinhoff et al. (37.Steinhoff H.J. Radzwill N. Thevis W. Lenz V. Brandenburg D. Antson A. Dodson G. Wollmer A. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 3287-3298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The spin-spin interaction between two spin labels attached to a protein is composed of static dipolar interaction, modulation of the dipolar interaction by the residual motion of the spin label side chains, and exchange interaction. For temperatures below 200 K, the residual motion of the nitroxide side chain is strongly restricted, and the static dipolar interaction leads to considerable broadening of the spectrum if the interspin distance does not exceed 25 Å. A detailed line shape analysis allows determination of absolute values of the interspin distance in the range of about 10 to 25 Å (37.Steinhoff H.J. Radzwill N. Thevis W. Lenz V. Brandenburg D.

Biol. 1997; 273: 951-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). For certain cases the modulation of the dipolar interaction due to the motion of the spin labels allows an estimation of the interresidue distances at room temperature (41.Mchaourab H.S. Oh K.J. Fang C.J. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Exchange interaction was found to contribute significantly to the line broadening for distances of less than 10 Å, because partial overlap of the nitrogen pi-orbitals of the two interacting nitroxides is required (42.Closs G.L. Forbes M.D.E. Piotrowiak P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 3285-3294Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 43.Fiori W.R. Millhauser G.L. Biopolymers. 1995; 37: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Binding measurements to determine theK d of the RT-RNA complex were performed using three different approaches. Fig. 2 Ashows a displacement titration using a fluorescently labeled DNA/DNA p/t, for which the affinity has previously been determined (35.Divita G. Müller B. Immendörfer U. Gautel M. Rittinger K. Restle T. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7966-7971Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). When this p/t binds to RT, its fluorescence is quenched. A complex was formed between RT and the p/t, and increasing amounts of pseudoknot RNA were added. The fluorescence increase observed upon displacement of the fluorescent p/t into solution was measured, as shown in Fig. 2 A. A K d of 25 pm was calculated from a least squares fit of the data to a model describing both equilibria (see under “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 2 B shows titration of increasing amounts of HIV-1 RT with a 5′-HEX-labeled pseudoknot RNA. Data were fitted to a quadratic equation yielding a K d of 24 pm. These results indicate that the chemically synthesized RNA, labeled with a fluorophor on the 5′-end (see under “Experimental Procedures”), shows a similar affinity for RT to the in vitro transcribed RNA used in Fig. 2 A. However, in Fig. 2, A and B, the concentration of the substrates is 2–3 orders of magnitude higher than the determinedK d value, and therefore the K dvalues derived show a rather large error, being in the same range as the fitted value. Due to the limiting fluorescence signal of the probes, it was not possible to reduce the substrate concentrations below 1 nm. To overcome the drawbacks of fluorescence-based measurements, radioactive labeling was used, allowing for the use of substrate concentrations in the pm range. Fig.2 C shows a filter binding assay in which 5′-32P-labeled pseudoknot RNA was titrated with increasing amounts of RT. However, upon dilution of the RNA from the stock solution (which had a concentration in the micromolar range) to the working solution in the low picomolar range, about 90% of the RNA was lost, probably due to molecules irreversibly absorbing to the Eppendorf tube. Several attempts to minimize this problem were only partially successful. However, as the RNA is highly labeled, it was possible to correct for these losses. Fitting of the experimental data, shown in Fig. 2 C, to a quadratic equation yielded aK d of about 40 pm, in good agreement with the fluorescence-based approaches. However, thisK d is dependent on the assumption that dilute solutions of RT do not result in absorption to the Eppendorf tube, as seen with the RNA. If such absorption (which cannot easily be corrected for) takes place, the effective protein concentration would be reduced, leading to a lower K d value than determined. Therefore the figure of 40 pm should be regarded as an upper estimate. Measurements were performed routinely in standard buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mm KCl, 1 mmDTT, and 10 mm MgCl2) with refolded pseudoknot RNA. Performing the experiments in the buffer used to select the pseudoknot (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 200 mmKOAc, and 10 mm DTT) and carry out previous experiments (6.Tuerk C. Macdougal S. Gold L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6988-6992Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), with RNA that was not folded, gave similar results. Stopped flow experiments were performed to analyze the association of RT with RNA. Binding of RT to the 5′-HEX-labeled pseudoknot RNA results in quenching of the fluorescence signal of about 6% (see Fig. 2 B). This rather small signal change was, however, not sufficient to obtain reasonable data in stopped flow experiments. We therefore used fluorescence resonance energy transfer to enhance the signal. The Alexa488-fluorophor (absorption and emission maxima of 493 and 520 nm, respectively) covalently linked to a cysteine at position 281 in the small subunit of the heterodimeric enzyme was used as donor and the HEX-fluorophor (absorption and emission maxima of 538 and 555 nm, respectively) on the 5′-end of the RNA as acceptor. From the x-ray structure of the protein-RNA complex, it could be predicted that the two fluorophors are about 20 Å apart (see Fig. 1). Upon binding of the RNA to the protein, a quenching of the donor fluorescence of about 20% could be observed. Independent measurements demonstrated that the Alexa488-labeled enzyme had comparable behavior to wild type RT with respect to enzymatic activities, substrate binding, and affinity for the pseudoknot (data not shown). Fig. 3 A shows a typical stopped flow experiment. The data obtained could be fitted best to an equation with two exponential terms. The fast first phase was dependent on the RT concentration, whereas the slower phase was not. In Fig.3 B, the dependence of the first phase of pseudoknot binding (observed pseudo-first-order rate constant) on RT concentration is shown."

We have previously shown that three basic residues in the TPR domain of PP5 are required for binding to the acidic C-terminal domain of hsp90. We have now tested which acidic residues in this C-terminal domain are required for binding to three different TPR proteins as follows: PP5, FKBP52, and Hop. Mutation of Glu-729, Glu-730, and Asp-732 at the C terminus of hsp90 interfered with binding of all three TPR proteins. Mutation of Glu-720, Asp-722, Asp-723, and Asp-724 inhibited binding of FKBP52 and PP5 but not of Hop. Mutation of Glu-651 and Asp-653 did not affect binding of FKBP52 or PP5 but inhibited both Hop binding and hsp90 chaperone activity. We also found that a conserved Lys residue required for PP5 binding to hsp90 was critical for the binding of FKBP52 but not for the binding of Hop to hsp90. These results suggest distinct but overlapping binding sites on hsp90 for different TPR proteins and indicate that the binding site for Hop, which is associated with hsp90 in intermediate stages of protein folding, overlaps with a site of chaperone activity.

Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar, 2.Pratt W.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 217: 420-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Over the past few years, many co-chaperones that play an important role in the folding of different subsets of proteins via the hsp90 pathway have been identified (1.Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar, 2.Pratt W.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 217: 420-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Several of these proteins bind to hsp90 via tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains. The order and specificity with which different TPR proteins bind to hsp90 complexes containing newly synthesized proteins is critical for proper protein folding (3.Frydman J. Höhfeld J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 87-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 4.Johnson J.L. Craig E.A. Cell. 1997; 90: 201-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This pathway has been best characterized in the study of steroid receptors. Newly synthesized receptors are found in complexes with hsp70. Intermediate complexes contain hsp70, hsp90, and Hop, a protein with two separate TPR domains that bind to hsp70 and hsp90. At this stage, receptors acquire the ability to bind hormone. Mature complexes contain either PP5 or one of the large immunophilins (FKBP51, FKBP52, or CyP-40), each of which contains a single hsp90-binding TPR domain (reviewed in Refs. 1.Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar, 2.Pratt W.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 217: 420-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 3.Frydman J.

Cell. 1997; 90: 201-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). At this point, the receptor can bind steroids with high affinity and is fully functional in vivo.Understanding the structural basis for the interactions between TPR proteins and hsp90 has become an important problem. Not only must specific TPR proteins bind to hsp90 complexes at specific stages of protein folding, but the TPR proteins found in mature hsp90 complexes containing steroid receptors differ according to the identity of the receptor (2.Pratt W.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 217: 420-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). In the case of the glucocorticoid receptor, the identity of the large immunophilin bound can dramatically affect hormone binding affinity (5.Reynolds P.D. Ruan Y. Smith D.F. Scammell J.G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PP5 has been shown to modulate glucocorticoid receptor signaling (6.Chen M.-S. Silverstein A.M. Pratt W.B. Chinkers M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32315-32320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 7.Zuo Z. Urban G. Scammell J.G. Dean N.M. McLean T.K. Aragon I. Honkanen R.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8849-8857Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus, specificity for the binding of TPR proteins to hsp90 exists and is functionally important, but its structural basis remains unknown. Determining what guides a particular TPR protein to a particular hsp90 complex at a particular time is of interest not only in terms of understanding protein folding but also for potential drug development. Geldanamycin is an antitumor antibiotic that blocks hsp90 function by competing with ATP for a binding site at its N terminus (8.Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar, 9.Prodromou C. Roe M.S. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). Its biological activity is thought to be due to prevention of proper folding and stabilization of proteins required for cell growth. If it were possible to specifically inhibit the binding to hsp90 of Hop, of PP5, or of particular large immunophilins, it would be possible to target specific subsets of proteins involved in cell signaling.Hsp90 contains two functional chaperone domains. One domain, at the N terminus, has been extensively characterized, including determination of its three-dimensional structure (8.Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar, 9.Prodromou C. Roe M.S. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). The structure of the other domain, at the C terminus, is not known. This highly acidic 12-kDa domain contains the binding site for TPR proteins and can promote protein folding in an ATP-independent manner (10.Young J.C. Obermann W.M.J. Hartl F.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18007-18010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 11.Young J.C. Schneider C. Hartl F.U.

A. 1998; 95: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Although the structure of this domain has not yet been determined, the structure of the TPR domain of PP5, to which it binds, has been solved (13.Das A.K. Cohen P.T.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). The TPR domain of PP5 consists of a series of antiparallel α-helices that form a right-handed superhelix (13.Das A.K. Cohen P.T.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar) making it similar to the α subunit of farnesyltransferase, which consists largely of a TPR domain (14.Park H.-W. Boduluri S.R. Moomaw J.F. Casey P.J. Beese L.S. Science. 1997; 275: 1800-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 15.Zhang H. Grishin N.V. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1658-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Both TPR domains contain a groove involved in protein-protein interactions (13.Das A.K. Cohen P.T.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 14.Park H.-W. Boduluri S.R. Moomaw J.F. Casey P.J. Beese L.S. Science. 1997; 275: 1800-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar).We have shown that, for PP5, four basic residues in this groove are involved in binding to the C-terminal domain of hsp90 (16.Russell L.C. Whitt S.R. Chen M.-S. Chinkers M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20060-20063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Several of these basic residues are conserved in Hop and in the large immunophilins. We have now used site-directed mutagenesis to determine the location of both the TPR-binding and chaperone sites within the C-terminal domain of hsp90. Our results indicate that similarities exist between the binding sites for PP5, FKBP52, and Hop, but we also identified interesting differences between these binding sites. Thus, the structural basis for the different biological activities of these different TPR proteins may lie partly in different interactions between their TPR domains and hsp90.DISCUSSIONWe have previously identified a groove in the TPR domain of PP5 that contains several basic residues critical for the binding of hsp90, and we hypothesized that these basic residues interacted with the abundant acidic residues in the 12-kDa C-terminal domain of hsp90 (16.Russell L.C. Whitt S.R. Chen M.-S. Chinkers M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20060-20063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), designated C90. It has been speculated that this groove could bind an amphipathic α-helix (13.Das A.K. Cohen P.T.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar), a structure predicted to be found in C90. We have now determined which of the 25 acidic residues in this 105-amino acid region are required for binding to the TPR domains of PP5, FKBP52, and Hop; all three proteins bind to C90 and contain the same conserved basic residues. Our results confirm and extend previous data suggesting that the MEEVD sequence at the C terminus of hsp90 was important for binding TPR proteins and that different TPR proteins competed for binding to the same site (22.Carello A. Ingley E. Minchin R.F. Tsai S. Ratajczak T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2682-2689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 23.Chen S. Sullivan W.P. Toft D.O. Smith D.F. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 118-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The data presented here, however, suggest a more complex picture. Although it seems clear that the MEEVD sequence is involved in binding to all three TPR proteins, there are also differences in their binding determinants. A cluster of four acidic amino acids adjacent to the MEEVD sequence (Glu-720, Asp-722, Asp-723, and Asp-724) is involved in binding to FKBP52 and PP5, proteins that are found in mature hsp90 complexes. Its mutation does not affect the binding of Hop, however, which is found in intermediate complexes. Mutation of either of these C-terminal sequences, while inhibiting TPR binding, does not affect the chaperone activity of C90, suggesting that the site of chaperone activity is located more toward the N terminus of this domain. Mutation of Glu-651 and Asp-653 decreases not only chaperone activity but Hop binding. Thus, the site of Hop binding, but not that of FKBP52 or PP5 binding, appears to overlap with the site of chaperone activity. One might speculate that Hop enters the hsp90 complex at an intermediate stage of protein folding because it is recognized by hsp90 as a misfolded protein, binding to one of the two available chaperone sites. Hop differs from FKBP52 and PP5 in another respect; a Lys residue conserved among these three proteins is absolutely required for binding of PP5 or FKBP52 to hsp90 but not for binding of Hop. This suggests that there are differences between the interactions between Hop and hsp90 and those between FKBP52 or PP5 and hsp90. This could either involve a difference in the binding of the TPR domain of Hop itself or simply the presence of additional binding determinants outside the TPR domain. With the exception of Hop, this conserved Lys residue may be of general importance in the binding of TPR proteins to hsp90. Recently, several investigators have found that its mutation prevents binding of hsp90 to CyP-40 2T. Ratajczak, personal communication. , FKBP51, 3J. Scammell, personal communication. and CNS1. 4R. Gaber, personal communication. At least two caveats apply to these data. First, as always, there is the possibility that site-directed mutagenesis can have global effects on protein folding, i.e. that particular mutants may result in altered folding of either C90 or of the TPR proteins. Although determination of the three-dimensional structure of hsp90 complexes with these proteins will be required to address fully this question, it is clear that whether due to loss of charged residues or whether to altered folding TPR proteins do not bind to hsp90 in an identical fashion. Similarly, homologous mutations in three TPR proteins differentially affect their binding to hsp90. We are, therefore, confident in drawing the general conclusion that the interactions between hsp90 and Hop are substantially different than those between hsp90 and PP5 or FKBP52. A second concern in interpreting the binding data has to do with the effects of experimental conditions on the results. Carello et al. (22.Carello A. Ingley E. Minchin R.F. Tsai S. Ratajczak T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2682-2689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) have previously shown that deletion of the MEEVD sequence results in a loss of binding of Hop to the immobilized C-terminal domain of hsp90. Chen et al. (23.Chen S. Sullivan W.P. Toft D.O. Smith D.F.

We obtained results identical to those of Carello et al. (22.Carello A. Ingley E. Minchin R.F. Tsai S. Ratajczak T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2682-2689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), but when we performed the assay slightly differently, immobilizing Hop by an N-terminal FLAG tag rather than immobilizing C90, we found that mutating MEEVD to MAAVA had no effect on Hop binding. We also found that this mutation inhibited binding to FKBP52 as well as to PP5, no matter which protein was immobilized. We interpret these results to indicate that the MEEVD sequence is involved in binding to all three TPR proteins but that multiple binding determinants exist for Hop. Only under some experimental conditions does a single mutation result in a complete loss of Hop binding.The observation that there appear to be different binding determinants for different TPR proteins, both within the TPR domain and within hsp90, is somewhat surprising. It has been assumed that all TPR proteins bind to the identical site on hsp90, and competition binding studies have reinforced this notion (22.Carello A. Ingley E. Minchin R.F. Tsai S. Ratajczak T.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2961-2965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Such studies, however, have also shown that bound TPR proteins can block the interaction of hsp90 with cdc37, which presumably binds to a separate nearby site (26.Owens-Grillo J.K. Czar M.J.

If the TPR domains all bound to hsp90 in an identical fashion, then biological differences between hsp90-binding TPR proteins would reside outside their TPR domains. This hypothesis is consistent with the observations that only Hop contains an hsp70-binding domain, only FKBP52 contains a peptidylprolyl isomerase domain, and only PP5 contains a phosphatase domain. However, the situation may not be so simple. First, the TPR domains diverge considerably in sequence. Second, the TPR domain of a large immunophilin has the same biological activity as the full-length protein in yeast, and inhibition of the peptidylprolyl isomerase activity of a large immunophilin does not block its chaperone activityin vitro (28.Bose S. Weikl T. Bugl H. Buchner J. Science. 1996; 274: 1715-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 29.Freeman B.C. Toft D.O. Morimoto R.I.

Chem. 1998; 273: 10819-10822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, TPR domains may function as more than simple targeting or docking domains. Even if the biological differences between these TPR proteins prove to be mainly due to interactions taking place outside their TPR domains, differences in binding determinants may be exploited pharmacologically. Our results suggest that there are structural differences between the binding sites on hsp90 for PP5, FKBP52, and Hop. This, in turn, suggests that it should be possible to develop inhibitors of specific TPR complexes. These would have potential uses both as drugs and in the study of proteins whose folding, processing, and subcellular trafficking is dependent on particular TPR proteins.Note Added in ProofIt has now been shown that sequence alignments were indeed misleading and that Lys-301 rather than Lys-429 of Hop corresponds to Lys-97 of PP5 (Scheufler, C., Brinker, A., Bourenkov, G., Pegoraro, S., Moroder, L., Bartunik, H., Hartl, F. U., and Moarefi, I. (2000) Cell 101, 199–210). Heat shock protein 90 (hsp90)1 is a molecular chaperone required for the proper folding of steroid receptors and a growing number of proteins involved in signal transduction (1.Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar, 2.Pratt W.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 217: 420-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Over the past few years, many co-chaperones that play an important role in the folding of different subsets of proteins via the hsp90 pathway have been identified (1.Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar, 2.Pratt W.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 217: 420-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Several of these proteins bind to hsp90 via tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains. The order and specificity with which different TPR proteins bind to hsp90 complexes containing newly synthesized proteins is critical for proper protein folding (3.Frydman J. Höhfeld J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 87-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 4.Johnson J.L. Craig E.A. Cell. 1997; 90: 201-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This pathway has been best characterized in the study of steroid receptors. Newly synthesized receptors are found in complexes with hsp70. Intermediate complexes contain hsp70, hsp90, and Hop, a protein with two separate TPR domains that bind to hsp70 and hsp90. At this stage, receptors acquire the ability to bind hormone. Mature complexes contain either PP5 or one of the large immunophilins (FKBP51, FKBP52, or CyP-40), each of which contains a single hsp90-binding TPR domain (reviewed in Refs. 1.Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar, 2.Pratt W.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 217: 420-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 3.Frydman J. Höhfeld J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 87-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 4.Johnson J.L. Craig E.A. Cell. 1997; 90: 201-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). At this point, the receptor can bind steroids with high affinity and is fully functional in vivo. Understanding the structural basis for the interactions between TPR proteins and hsp90 has become an important problem. Not only must specific TPR proteins bind to hsp90 complexes at specific stages of protein folding, but the TPR proteins found in mature hsp90 complexes containing steroid receptors differ according to the identity of the receptor (2.Pratt W.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 217: 420-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). In the case of the glucocorticoid receptor, the identity of the large immunophilin bound can dramatically affect hormone binding affinity (5.Reynolds P.D. Ruan Y. Smith D.F. Scammell J.G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PP5 has been shown to modulate glucocorticoid receptor signaling (6.Chen M.-S. Silverstein A.M. Pratt W.B. Chinkers M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32315-32320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 7.Zuo Z. Urban G. Scammell J.G. Dean N.M. McLean T.K. Aragon I. Honkanen R.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8849-8857Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus, specificity for the binding of TPR proteins to hsp90 exists and is functionally important, but its structural basis remains unknown. Determining what guides a particular TPR protein to a particular hsp90 complex at a particular time is of interest not only in terms of understanding protein folding but also for potential drug development. Geldanamycin is an antitumor antibiotic that blocks hsp90 function by competing with ATP for a binding site at its N terminus (8.Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar, 9.Prodromou C. Roe M.S. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). Its biological activity is thought to be due to prevention of proper folding and stabilization of proteins required for cell growth. If it were possible to specifically inhibit the binding to hsp90 of Hop, of PP5, or of particular large immunophilins, it would be possible to target specific subsets of proteins involved in cell signaling. Hsp90 contains two functional chaperone domains. One domain, at the N terminus, has been extensively characterized, including determination of its three-dimensional structure (8.Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar, 9.Prodromou C. Roe M.S. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). The structure of the other domain, at the C terminus, is not known. This highly acidic 12-kDa domain contains the binding site for TPR proteins and can promote protein folding in an ATP-independent manner (10.Young J.C. Obermann W.M.J. Hartl F.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18007-18010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 11.Young J.C. Schneider C. Hartl F.U.

A. 1998; 95: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Although the structure of this domain has not yet been determined, the structure of the TPR domain of PP5, to which it binds, has been solved (13.Das A.K. Cohen P.T.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). The TPR domain of PP5 consists of a series of antiparallel α-helices that form a right-handed superhelix (13.Das A.K. Cohen P.T.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar) making it similar to the α subunit of farnesyltransferase, which consists largely of a TPR domain (14.Park H.-W. Boduluri S.R. Moomaw J.F. Casey P.J. Beese L.S. Science. 1997; 275: 1800-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 15.Zhang H. Grishin N.V. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1658-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Both TPR domains contain a groove involved in protein-protein interactions (13.Das A.K. Cohen P.T.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 14.Park H.-W. Boduluri S.R. Moomaw J.F. Casey P.J. Beese L.S. Science. 1997; 275: 1800-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). We have shown that, for PP5, four basic residues in this groove are involved in binding to the C-terminal domain of hsp90 (16.Russell L.C. Whitt S.R. Chen M.-S. Chinkers M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20060-20063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Several of these basic residues are conserved in Hop and in the large immunophilins. We have now used site-directed mutagenesis to determine the location of both the TPR-binding and chaperone sites within the C-terminal domain of hsp90. Our results indicate that similarities exist between the binding sites for PP5, FKBP52, and Hop, but we also identified interesting differences between these binding sites. Thus, the structural basis for the different biological activities of these different TPR proteins may lie partly in different interactions between their TPR domains and hsp90. DISCUSSIONWe have previously identified a groove in the TPR domain of PP5 that contains several basic residues critical for the binding of hsp90, and we hypothesized that these basic residues interacted with the abundant acidic residues in the 12-kDa C-terminal domain of hsp90 (16.Russell L.C. Whitt S.R. Chen M.-S. Chinkers M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20060-20063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), designated C90. It has been speculated that this groove could bind an amphipathic α-helix (13.Das A.K. Cohen P.T.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar), a structure predicted to be found in C90. We have now determined which of the 25 acidic residues in this 105-amino acid region are required for binding to the TPR domains of PP5, FKBP52, and Hop; all three proteins bind to C90 and contain the same conserved basic residues. Our results confirm and extend previous data suggesting that the MEEVD sequence at the C terminus of hsp90 was important for binding TPR proteins and that different TPR proteins competed for binding to the same site (22.Carello A. Ingley E. Minchin R.F. Tsai S. Ratajczak T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2682-2689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 23.Chen S. Sullivan W.P. Toft D.O. Smith D.F. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 118-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The data presented here, however, suggest a more complex picture. Although it seems clear that the MEEVD sequence is involved in binding to all three TPR proteins, there are also differences in their binding determinants. A cluster of four acidic amino acids adjacent to the MEEVD sequence (Glu-720, Asp-722, Asp-723, and Asp-724) is involved in binding to FKBP52 and PP5, proteins that are found in mature hsp90 complexes. Its mutation does not affect the binding of Hop, however, which is found in intermediate complexes. Mutation of either of these C-terminal sequences, while inhibiting TPR binding, does not affect the chaperone activity of C90, suggesting that the site of chaperone activity is located more toward the N terminus of this domain. Mutation of Glu-651 and Asp-653 decreases not only chaperone activity but Hop binding. Thus, the site of Hop binding, but not that of FKBP52 or PP5 binding, appears to overlap with the site of chaperone activity. One might speculate that Hop enters the hsp90 complex at an intermediate stage of protein folding because it is recognized by hsp90 as a misfolded protein, binding to one of the two available chaperone sites. Hop differs from FKBP52 and PP5 in another respect; a Lys residue conserved among these three proteins is absolutely required for binding of PP5 or FKBP52 to hsp90 but not for binding of Hop. This suggests that there are differences between the interactions between Hop and hsp90 and those between FKBP52 or PP5 and hsp90. This could either involve a difference in the binding of the TPR domain of Hop itself or simply the presence of additional binding determinants outside the TPR domain. With the exception of Hop, this conserved Lys residue may be of general importance in the binding of TPR proteins to hsp90. Recently, several investigators have found that its mutation prevents binding of hsp90 to CyP-40 2T. Ratajczak, personal communication. , FKBP51, 3J. Scammell, personal communication. and CNS1. 4R. Gaber, personal communication. At least two caveats apply to these data. First, as always, there is the possibility that site-directed mutagenesis can have global effects on protein folding, i.e. that particular mutants may result in altered folding of either C90 or of the TPR proteins. Although determination of the three-dimensional structure of hsp90 complexes with these proteins will be required to address fully this question, it is clear that whether due to loss of charged residues or whether to altered folding TPR proteins do not bind to hsp90 in an identical fashion. Similarly, homologous mutations in three TPR proteins differentially affect their binding to hsp90. We are, therefore, confident in drawing the general conclusion that the interactions between hsp90 and Hop are substantially different than those between hsp90 and PP5 or FKBP52. A second concern in interpreting the binding data has to do with the effects of experimental conditions on the results. Carello et al. (22.Carello A. Ingley E. Minchin R.F. Tsai S. Ratajczak T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2682-2689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) have previously shown that deletion of the MEEVD sequence results in a loss of binding of Hop to the immobilized C-terminal domain of hsp90.

J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2682-2689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 24.Owens-Grillo J.K. Hoffmann K. Hutchison K.A. Yem A.W. Deibel Jr., M.R. Handschumacher R.E.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2961-2965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Such studies, however, have also shown that bound TPR proteins can block the interaction of hsp90 with cdc37, which presumably binds to a separate nearby site (26.Owens-Grillo J.K. Czar M.J. Hutchison K.A. Hoffmann K. Perdew G. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13468-13475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 27.Silverstein A.M. Grammatikakis N.

If the TPR domains all bound to hsp90 in an identical fashion, then biological differences between hsp90-binding TPR proteins would reside outside their TPR domains. This hypothesis is consistent with the observations that only Hop contains an hsp70-binding domain, only FKBP52 contains a peptidylprolyl isomerase domain, and only PP5 contains a phosphatase domain. However, the situation may not be so simple. First, the TPR domains diverge considerably in sequence. Second, the TPR domain of a large immunophilin has the same biological activity as the full-length protein in yeast, and inhibition of the peptidylprolyl isomerase activity of a large immunophilin does not block its chaperone activityin vitro (28.Bose S. Weikl T. Bugl H. Buchner J. Science. 1996; 274: 1715-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 29.Freeman B.C. Toft D.O. Morimoto R.I.

Chem. 1998; 273: 10819-10822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, TPR domains may function as more than simple targeting or docking domains. Even if the biological differences between these TPR proteins prove to be mainly due to interactions taking place outside their TPR domains, differences in binding determinants may be exploited pharmacologically. Our results suggest that there are structural differences between the binding sites on hsp90 for PP5, FKBP52, and Hop. This, in turn, suggests that it should be possible to develop inhibitors of specific TPR complexes. These would have potential uses both as drugs and in the study of proteins whose folding, processing, and subcellular trafficking is dependent on particular TPR proteins. Note Added in ProofIt has now been shown that sequence alignments were indeed misleading and that Lys-301 rather than Lys-429 of Hop corresponds to Lys-97 of PP5 (Scheufler, C., Brinker, A., Bourenkov, G., Pegoraro, S., Moroder, L., Bartunik, H., Hartl, F.

https://openalex.org/W2014802689,"The initial stage of oxidation of high density lipoproteins (HDL) is accompanied by the lipid hydroperoxide-dependent, selective oxidation of two of the three Met residues of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) to Met sulfoxides (Met(O)). Formation of such selectively oxidized apoA-I (i.e. apoA-I+32) may affect the antiatherogenic properties of HDL, because it has been suggested that Met86and Met112 are important for cholesterol efflux and Met148 is involved in the activation of lecithin:cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT). We therefore determined which Met residues were oxidized in apoA-I+32 and how such oxidation of apoA-I affects its secondary structure, the affinity for lipids, and its ability to remove lipids from human macrophages. We also assessed the capacity of discoidal reconstituted HDL containing apoA-I+32 to act as substrate for LCAT, and the dissociation of apoA-I and apoA-I+32 from reconstituted HDL. Met86 and Met112 were present as Met(O), as determined by amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry of isolated peptides derived from apoA-I+32. Selective oxidation did not alter the α-helicity of lipid-free and lipid-associated apoA-I as assessed by circular dichroism, and the affinity for LCAT was comparable for reconstituted HDL containing apoA-I or apoA-I+32. Cholesteryl ester transfer protein mediated the dissociation of apoA-I more readily from reconstituted HDL containing apoA-I+32 than unoxidized apoA-I. Also, compared with native apoA-I, apoA-I+32 had a 2- to 3-fold greater affinity for lipid (as determined by the rate of clearance of multilamellar phospholipid vesicles) and its ability to cause efflux of [3H]cholesterol, [3H]phospholipid, and [14C]α-tocopherol from lipid-laden human monocyte-derived macrophages was significantly enhanced. By contrast, no difference was observed for cholesterol and α-tocopherol efflux to lipid-associated apolipoproteins. Together, these results suggest that selective oxidation of Met residues enhances rather than diminishes known antiatherogenic activities of apoA-I, consistent with the overall hypothesis that detoxification of lipid hydroperoxides by HDL is potentially antiatherogenic.

In addition to promoting cholesterol efflux, HDL has also been proposed to be antiatherogenic by aiding the removal and detoxification of proatherogenic oxidized lipids (5.Bowry V.W. Stanley K.K.

Thus, cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) transfers oxidized lipids from low density lipoproteins (LDL) to HDL (7.Christison J. Rye K.-A. Stocker R. J. Lipid. Res. 1995; 36: 2017-2026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and HDL carries the majority of cholesteryl ester hydroperoxides (CE-OOH, the first and major products formed during lipoprotein oxidation) in human plasma (5.Bowry V.W. Stanley K.K. Stocker R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10316-10320Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). In addition, CE-OOH and cholesteryl ester hydroxides (CE-OH) in HDL, but not LDL, are removed rapidly via selective uptake by liver parenchymal cells in vitro (6.Sattler W. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and by perfused liver in situ (8.Christison J.K. Karjalainen A. Brauman J. Bygrave F. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 739-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This uptake is associated with cellular detoxification of CE-OOH (6.Sattler W. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and is more rapid than that of the corresponding nonoxidized cholesteryl esters (CE) (6.Sattler W. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 8.Christison J.K. Karjalainen A. Brauman J. Bygrave F. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 739-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CE-OH are also rapidly removed from HDL via hepatic clearance in vivo (9.Fluiter K. Vietsch H. Biessen E.A. Kostner G.M. van Berkel T.J.C. Sattler W. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and this is associated with biliary secretion of the CE-OH-derived cholesterol (9.Fluiter K. Vietsch H. Biessen E.A. Kostner G.M. van Berkel T.J.C. Sattler W. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), indicating that oxidation of the fatty acid moiety of CE may aid the elimination of cholesterol from the body. Once associated with HDL, CE-OOH are reduced to the corresponding CE-OH (10.Sattler W. Christison J.K. Stocker R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) that no longer contribute to or enhance the oxidation of lipoproteins. This “antioxidant” activity is expressed by reconstituted HDL particles (rHDL) containing apoA-I only and lipid-free apoA-I (11.Garner B. Witting P.K. Waldeck A.R. Christison J.K. Raftery M.

Res. 1998; 39: 1133-1140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reduction of lipid hydroperoxides, added to or formed in HDL exposed to radical oxidants, results in the formation of selectively oxidized apoA-I (i.e. apoA-I+32) that contains two Met sulfoxide [Met(O)] residues as the sole modification (11.Garner B.

However, it is not known which Met residues of apoA-I become oxidized and how formation of Met(O) affects the ability of apoA-I/HDL to mediate efflux of lipids from macrophages and to act as substrate for lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT). These questions are relevant, because in human atherosclerotic lesions HDL is oxidized to an extent comparable to that of LDL (14.Niu X. Zammit V. Upston J.M. Dean R.T. Stocker R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1708-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and a decreased and enhanced ability to promote cellular cholesterol efflux has been reported for in vitro oxidized HDL (see e.g.Refs. 15.Nagano Y. Arai H. Kita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6457-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 16.Francis G.A. Mendez A.J. Bierman E.L. Heinecke J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the present study, we therefore examined the physicochemical characteristics and biological activities of apoA-I+32. Isolated HDL was prepared from fresh plasma obtained from normolipidemic donors (18.Sattler W. Mohr D. Stocker R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), and its protein content was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Sigma) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma) as standard. HDL was oxidized in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA by aerobic incubation at 37 °C for 19 h in the presence of 2,2′-azobis(2-amidinopropane) hydrochloride (AAPH, 80 μmol/liter and mg HDL protein), a generator of aqueous peroxyl radicals. After oxidation, AAPH was removed by gel filtration (11.Garner B. Witting P.K. Waldeck A.R. Christison J.K. Raftery M. Stocker R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6080-6087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). ApoA-I and apoA-I+32 were isolated by semipreparative reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), as described in detail (11.Garner B. Witting P.K. Waldeck A.R. Christison J.K. Raftery M. Stocker R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6080-6087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 19.von Eckardstein A. Walter M. Holz H. Benninghoven A. Assmann G. J. Lipid. Res. 1991; 32: 1465-1476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peaks corresponding to apoA-I and apoA-I+32 were collected, placed immediately on dry ice, freeze-dried, redissolved in reconstitution buffer (3 mguanidine HCl, 10 mm Tris, 0.01% EDTA, pH 8.2), and then dialyzed extensively against PBS (two buffer changes) and 0.5 mm Tris, pH 7.4 (three changes). Protein concentrations were determined by A 280 nm or by the bicinchoninic acid method described as above, and the phospholipid content was determined using an enzymatic kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Discoidal reconstituted HDL (drHDL) containing either apoA-I (drHDLA-I) or apoA-I+32(drHDLA-I+32) were prepared by cholate dialysis (20.Rye K.A. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10298-10303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the respective purified apolipoproteins. Compositional analyses were performed on a Cobas autoanalyzer (Roche Diagnostics). The Stokes' diameter and surface charge of the particles were determined by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gradient and agarose gel electrophoreses, respectively (20.Rye K.A. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10298-10303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The composition and properties of drHDLA-I and drHDLA-I+32 were comparable with regards to the molar ratio of phospholipid/cholesterol/apoA-I (i.e. 91/12/1 and 90/11/1 for apoA-I and apoA-I+32, respectively, with a stoichiometric variation of <5% between preparations), electrophoretic mobility, and particle size. Because a change in electrophoretic migration of rHDL is indicative of alteration of the secondary and/or tertiary structure of apoA-I (21.Sparks D.L. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25839-25847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Sparks D.L. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25830-25838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the results indicate that introduction of two Met(O) does not cause a major conformational change of lipid-associated apoA-I. Spherical reconstituted HDLA-I (srHDLA-I) and srHDLA-I+32were prepared from drHDLA-I and drHDLA-I+32, respectively, and purified by ultracentrifugation (23.Rye K.-A. Hime N.J. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4243-4250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The phospholipid/cholesterol/CE/apoA-I molar ratios were 24/25/4/1 and 24/25/3/1 for srHDLA-I and srHDLA-I+32, respectively. Dissociation of apoA-I and apoA-I+32 from srHDL was assessed by incubating the particles with CETP and the phospholipid/triglyceride emulsion Intralipid (20% triglyceride, Kabivitrum AB). Details of the incubations are in the legend to Fig. 1. Changes in srHDL size were determined by nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (23.Rye K.-A. Hime N.J. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4243-4250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Dissociation was determined by immunoblotting with anti-apoA-I polyclonal antibodies and visualization by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A Sharp JX-610 high resolution scanner was used to scan Coomassie-stained gradient gels and immunoblots. Size-exclusion HPLC of lipid-free apoA-I and apoA-I+32 was performed using a Phenomex Biosep SEC-S2000 column (300 × 7.8 mm, Bio-Rad), using 0.05 m phosphate, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.5, as the mobile phase at 0.5 ml/min and UV detection at 214 nm. Protein size was calculated using a gel filtration standard (Bio-Rad) for comparison. For cross-linking experiments, apoA-I or apoA-I+32 (25 μg/ml PBS) was preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by further incubation for 30 min at room temperature in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of bis-sulfosuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce) and separation of the proteins on 8% Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Bands were visualized by silver staining. ApoA-I and apoA-I+32 (∼50 μg in 200 μl) were digested at 37 °C for 20 h using endoprotease AspN (sequencing grade, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 400 μl of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, at an enzyme-to-substrate ratio of 1:100 (w/w). The pH of each digest was then lowered to ≈2.0 with 1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the mixture was applied to a C18 RP-column (5 μm, 300 Å, 4.6 × 250 mm, Separations Group, Hesperia). Peptides were eluted at 1 ml/min over 30 min using a gradient of 5–75% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peaks with major absorbance at 214 nm were collected, lyophilized, and then dissolved in acetonitrile/water (1:1, v/v), containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (∼50 μl) for mass determination. Mass spectra were acquired using a single quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source (Platform, VG-Fisons Instruments). Samples (∼50 pmol, 10 μl) were injected into a moving solvent (10 μl/min; acetonitrile/water (1:1, v/v), containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) coupled directly to the ionization source via polyether ether ketone tubing (127 μm x 40 cm). The source temperature was 50 °C and N2 was used as nebulizer and drying gas. Sample droplets were ionized at approximately 3 kV and transferred to the mass analyzer with a cone voltage of 50 V. The peak width at half height was 1 Da. Spectra of proteins were acquired in multichannel acquisition mode over the mass range of 700–1800 Da in 5 s then calibrated with horse heart myoglobin (Sigma). Spectra of peptides were also acquired in multichannel acquisition mode over the mass range 250–2000 Da in 10 s. Some spectra were recorded using an LC/MSD 1100 mass spectrometer (Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA) employing similar conditions. Peptides (typically 50–200 pmol) were N-terminally sequenced using an automated protein sequencer (model 470A, Applied Biosystems). The secondary structure was analyzed by circular dichroism (CD). Spectra of apoA-I or apoA-I+32 (0.1 mg/ml 0.5 mm Tris, pH 7.4) and drHDLA-I or drHDLA-I+32 (0.16 mg of protein/ml of 1 mm PBS, pH 7.4) were recorded on a JASCO 720 CD spectropolarimeter at 25 °C using 1- and 0.1-mm path length cells, respectively. Acquisition parameters were: range = 184–260 nm; resolution = 0.5 nm; bandwidth = 1.0 nm; response time = 1 s; scan speed = 20 nm/min; and number of scans = 16. The mean residue ellipticity was calculated by θMRW = θobs × MRW/10 × c × l, where θobs is the observed raw data in millidegrees, MRW is the mean residue weight (i.e. 115.0 for apoA-I),c is the concentration, and l is the path length of the cell. The secondary structure was predicted by analyzing the CD spectra using the program “variable selection” (VARSELEC), where fitting of a data base of 33 proteins of known secondary structures is performed (24.Manavalan P. Johnson Jr., W.C. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). The lipid affinity of apoA-I and apoA-I+32 was determined using the dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC, Sigma) clearance assay (25.Pownall H.J. Pao Q. Hickson D. Sparrow J.T. Kusserow S.K. Massey J.B. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6630-6635Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, the decrease in turbidity of multilamellar DMPC vesicles (0.5 mg/ml) upon addition of apoA-I and apoA-I+32 (0.2 mg/ml) was measured over time at 325 nm and 24 ± 0.2 °C using a UV-visible Lambda 40 spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer). LCAT, prepared as described (23.Rye K.-A. Hime N.J. Barter P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4243-4250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and used for the experiments, esterified 340 nmol of CE/ml of LCAT/h under assay conditions. drHDL was labeled by placing [3H]cholesterol (48 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a test tube, and the organic solvent was removed under N2. Ethanol (20 μl) and drHDL containing cholesterol were then added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min before dilution with buffer and supplementation with β-mercaptoethanol (4 mm, final concentration) and fatty acid-free BSA (4 mg/ml). The final volume of the incubation mixtures was 135 μl, and the cholesterol concentration was varied from 0.1 to 5.0 μm. Following incubation at 37 °C for 30 min under N2, the LCAT reaction was initiated by adding 5 μl of a 1:8 (v/v) dilution of the LCAT preparation or buffer (control), and the mixture was incubated under N2 at 37 °C for 1 h. Following the reaction, radiolabeled CE were quantified by the digitonin precipitation method, exactly as described by Piran and Morin (26.Piran U. Morin R.J. J. Lipid.

Chem. 1994; 269: 14457-14464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from buffy coats prepared from blood from normolipidemic volunteers. Cells were plated in 12-well tissue culture plates (Falcon) at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells per ml of RPMI medium containing 10% heat-inactivated human serum and left to adhere and differentiate into macrophages (hMDM) over the next 10 days. Subsequently, cells were washed and incubated in RPMI medium containing 10% lipoprotein-depleted serum in the presence of 100 μg/ml acetylated LDL (acLDL) for 48 h to generate lipid-laden “foam cells” as described (28.Kritharides L. Christian A. Stoudt G. Morel D. Rothblat G.H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1589-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For metabolic labeling of cellular cholesterol pools, acLDL was first labeled with [3H]cholesterol (51 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 6 h (28.Kritharides L. Christian A. Stoudt G. Morel D. Rothblat G.H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1589-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), before [3H]cholesterol-acLDL was diluted in RPMI (100 μg/ml acLDL and 2 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol), and then incubated with cells. The “labeling” medium was then replaced with RPMI medium without serum for 18 h to equilibrate labeled cholesterol among cellular pools. The same procedure was used for metabolic labeling of cellular α-tocopherol (α-TOH) pools, using 0.4 μCi/ml all-rac-[14C]α-tocopherol (a generous gift of Eisai Co. Ltd.) instead of [3H]cholesterol. To label phospholipids, hMDM were incubated with acLDL as described above and labeled during the 18-h equilibration period with 5 μCi/ml methyl-[3H]choline chloride (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the presence of 0.1% BSA (29.Francis G.A. Knopp R.H. Oram J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Subsequently, cells were washed twice with RPMI, incubated with fresh medium for 1 h, and washed twice with RPMI containing 0.1% BSA and then twice with RPMI before efflux incubations. After appropriate labeling, cells were incubated at 37 °C with 2 ml of RPMI per dish and, unless indicated otherwise, 25 μg/ml either lipid-free or lipid-associated apoA-I or apoA-I+32. Previous studies showed that 25 μg of apoA-I is sufficient for saturating cholesterol efflux from primary macrophages (30.Kritharides L. Jessup W. Mander E.L. Dean R.T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 276-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To investigate initial kinetics, efflux experiments were performed as described previously (31.Johnson W.J. Chacko G.K. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5546-5553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the indicated times, aliquots of efflux media were collected and centrifuged to remove cell debris, and the radioactivity was determined by β-counting. Where indicated, the label remaining within the cells was also determined. For this, cells were washed twice with PBS containing 0.1% BSA, washed twice with PBS, and lysed in 0.2 N NaOH for 10 min on ice, and aliquots of the lysates then used to count radioactivity and to determine protein using the bicinchoninic acid assay. After equilibration and before efflux (i.e. time 0), cells in separate dishes were lysed, and the lipids were extracted with methanol/hexane (1:5; v:v) and analyzed by HPLC with UV210 nm detection (for cholesterol and CE), with electrochemical or fluorescent detection (for α-TOH), and with on-line radiometric detection (for [14C]α-TOH, [3H]cholesterol, and [3H]CE) (7.Christison J. Rye K.-A. Stocker R. J. Lipid. Res. 1995; 36: 2017-2026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Witting P.K. Mohr D. Stocker R. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 299: 362-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In some experiments, lipids in the efflux media were also extracted and analyzed as above. For experiments with methyl-[3H]choline-labeled cells, media and cells were stored (−80 °C) until protein determination and extraction of phospholipids with 2 × 1 ml of hexane/isopropanol (3:2; v:v) (18 and 1 h for the first and second extractions, respectively). The combined organic supernatants were then dried under nitrogen and extracted further using the method of Bligh and Dyer (33.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar). The resulting CH3Cl fraction (1 volume) was back-washed four times with 1 volume of methanol:H2O (1:1) to remove any remaining radiolabeled choline, and the radioactivity in the washed CH3Cl fraction was counted. The cellular phospholipid mass at time 0 was determined using an enzymatic kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). To assess HDL protein oxidation and to isolate pure native apoA-I and apoA-I+32, we adapted the HPLC method previously described (11.Garner B. Witting P.K. Waldeck A.R. Christison J.K. Raftery M.

Oxidation of the same HDL with AAPH (as described under “Experimental Procedures”) decreased the content of apoA-I and apoA-II with the concomitant formation of new peaks. The two apoA-I-derived peaks have been shown previously to correspond to modified apoA-I containing one (referred to as apoA-I+16) and two (apoA-I+32) Met(O) instead of Met (11.Garner B. Witting P.K.

In the present study, the mass of collected apoA-I+32 was 28,112.5 ± 2 Da (mean ± S.D., n = 10), 33 ± 2 mass units greater than that obtained for apoA-I (28,079.1 ± 1 Da, n = 10; the value predicted from the amino acid composition of apoA-I is 28,078.7 Da) (Table I).

A kinetic isotope effect,k H/k D = 21–24, was observed with [U-2H]linoleic acid as a substrate. The relative biosynthesis of (11S)-hydroperoxylinoleate (11S-HPODE) and (13R)-hydroperoxylinoleate (13R-HPODE) was pH-dependent and changed by [U-2H]linoleic acid. Stopped-flow kinetic traces of linoleic and α-linolenic acids indicated catalytic lag times of ∼45 ms, which were followed by bursts of enzyme activity for ∼60 ms and then by steady state (k cat ∼26 and ∼47 s−1, respectively). 11S-HPODE was isomerized by manganese lipoxygenase to 13R-HPODE and formed from linoleic acid at the same rates (k cat 7–9 s−1). Catalysis was accompanied by collisional quenching of the long wavelength fluorescence (640–685 nm) by fatty acid substrates and 13R-HPODE. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) of native manganese lipoxygenase showed weak 6-fold hyperfine splitting superimposed on a broad resonance indicating two populations of MnII bound to protein. The addition of linoleic acid decreased both components, and denaturation of the lipoxygenase liberated ∼0.8 Mn2+ atoms/lipoxygenase molecule. These observations are consistent with a mononuclear MnII center in the native state, which is converted during catalysis to an EPR silent MnIII state. We propose that manganese lipoxygenase has kinetic and redox properties similar to iron lipoxygenases."
https://openalex.org/W2009195662,"RGS3 belongs to a family of the regulators of G protein signaling (RGS). We previously demonstrated that cytosolic RGS3 translocates to the membrane to inhibit G<sub>q/11</sub>signaling (Dulin, N. O., Sorokin, A., Reed, E., Elliott, S., Kehrl, J., and Dunn, M. J. (1999) <i>Mol. Cell. Biol.</i> 19, 714–723). This study examines the properties of a recently identified truncated variant termed RGS3T. Both RGS3 and RGS3T bound to endogenous Gα<sub>q/11</sub> and inhibited endothelin-1-stimulated calcium mobilization and mitogen-activated protein kinase activity to a similar extent. However, unlike cytosolically localized RGS3, RGS3T was found predominantly in the nucleus and partially in the plasma membrane. Furthermore, RGS3T, but not RGS3, caused cell rounding and membrane blebbing. Finally, 44% of RGS3T-transfected cells underwent apoptosis after serum withdrawal, which was significantly higher than that of RGS3-transfected cells (7%). Peptide sequence analysis revealed two potential nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences in RGS3T. Further truncation of the RGS3T N terminus containing putative NLSs resulted in a significant reduction of nuclear <i>versus</i> cytoplasmic staining of the protein. Moreover, this truncated RGS3T no longer induced apoptosis. In summary, RGS3 and its truncated variant RGS3T are similar in their ability to inhibit G<sub>q/11</sub> signaling but are different in their intracellular distribution. These data suggest that, in addition to being a GTPase-activating protein, RGS3T has other distinct functions in the nucleus of the cell."
https://openalex.org/W2006320529,"Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like growth factor (HB-EGF) is a member of the EGF family of growth factors. The membrane-anchored form of HB-EGF (proHB-EGF) is mitogenically active to neighboring cells as well as being a precursor of the soluble form. In addition to its mitogenic activity, proHB-EGF has the property of binding to diphtheria toxin (DT), serving as the specific receptor for DT. Tetramembrane-spanning protein CD9, a member of the TM4 superfamily, is physically associated with proHB-EGF at the cell surface and up-regulates both mitogenic and DT binding activities of proHB-EGF. To understand this up-regulation mechanism, we studied essential regions of both CD9 and proHB-EGF for up-regulation. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that not only CD9 but also other TM4 proteins including CD63, CD81, and CD82 associate with proHB-EGF on the cell surface. However, these TM4 proteins did not up-regulate DT binding activity of proHB-EGF. Transfection of a series of chimeric constructs comprising CD9 and CD81 showed that the major extracellular domain of CD9 is essential for up-regulation. Assays of DT binding activity and juxtacrine mitogenic activity of the deletion mutants of proHB-EGF and chimeric molecules, derived from proHB-EGF and TGF-α, showed that the essential domain of proHB-EGF for up-regulation is the EGF-like domain.

Similar to other EGF family growth factors, HB-EGF binds to and stimulates EGF receptors, and thus soluble mature HB-EGF is a potent mitogen for a number of cells including NIH3T3 cells, bovine aortic smooth muscle cells, rat hepatocytes, and human keratinocytes (3.Raab G. Klagsbrun M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F179-F199PubMed Google Scholar). HB-EGF is synthesized as a trans-membrane protein of 208 amino acids composed of signal peptide, pro, heparin-binding, EGF-like, juxtamembrane, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains. Although the membrane-anchored form of HB-EGF (proHB-EGF) is cleaved on plasma membrane to yield a soluble HB-EGF (4.Goishi K. Higashiyama S. Klagsbrun M. Nakano N. Umata T. Ishikawa M. Mekada E.

Indeed, proHB-EGF is not only a precursor protein for soluble HB-EGF but also a membrane-anchored growth factor itself. As shown in other membrane-anchored growth factors and lymphokines, proHB-EGF transduces mitogenic signals to neighboring cells in a nondiffusible manner, the so-called “juxtacrine mechanism” (6.Higashiyama S.

In the endocytic vesicle, DT or its fragment A penetrates the endosome membrane and reaches to the cytosol (9.Umata T. Mekada E. J. Biol.

CRM197, a nontoxic mutant of DT, inhibits mitogenic activity of HB-EGF by preventing binding of HB-EGF to the EGF receptor (11.Mitamura T. Higashiyama S. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1015-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), thus the binding site of proHB-EGF for DT has been suggested as being located in close proximity to, or overlapping with, that for the EGF receptor. The proHB-EGF gene has been identified in mammals and chicken, and thus most mamalian cells are sensitive to DT. However, cells derived from mouse or rat are resistant to DT, because proHB-EGF of these animals has amino acid substitutions in the EGF-like domain and therefore does not bind DT. proHB-EGF forms a complex with CD9 (7.Iwamoto R.

CD9 up-regulates both DT binding and juxtacrine mitogenic activities of proHB-EGF when CD9 is co-expressed with proHB-EGF, although CD9 itself does not have those properties (6.Higashiyama S.

CD9 does not enhance the proHB-EGF transcription, and neither does it increase the number of proHB-EGF molecules on the cell surface (6.Higashiyama S. Iwamoto R. Goishi K. Raab G. Taniguchi N.

Scatchard plot analysis of DT binding to proHB-EGF indicated that increased DT binding with CD9 is due to an increase in the number of effective binding sites for DT (7.Iwamoto R. Higashiyama S. Mitamura T. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2322-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism of up-regulation remains to be elucidated. In this report we have studied the regions of proHB-EGF and CD9 responsible for up-regulation. Results showed that the second extracellular domain of CD9 and the EGF-like domain of proHB-EGF are essential for the up-regulation of proHB-EGF, indicating that interaction of these molecules at the extracellular domains is important. DT was produced as described previously (17.Uchida T. Pappenheimer Jr., A.M. Greany R. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3838-3844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Mouse anti-CD9, -CD63, and -CD81 antibodies were from MBL Co., Ltd (Nagoya, Japan). Mouse anti-CD82 monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Serotec Ltd. (Oxford, UK). Rabbit anti-goat IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG were from Cappel Laboratories (Durham, NC). Plasmids encoding monkey CD9 (pRcT1843) and human proHB-EGF (pRcHBEGF) were used as described previously (11.Mitamura T. Higashiyama S. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Biol.

Levy (Stanford University), respectively. cDNA of human CD82 was obtained by polymerase chain reaction from the human B cell cDNA library. These cDNAs were inserted into the HindIII/XbaI site in the expression vector, pRc/CMV. CD9/CD81 chimeras were constructed as follows. NdeI site andNarI sites were introduced in CD9 cDNA by substituting324C to A and 594A to C, respectively. The mutations introduced were synonymous; thus no amino acid substitutions occurred. Then CD9/CD81 chimeras were constructed by substituting to the corresponding polymerase chain reaction fragments of CD81 cDNA with corresponding restriction enzyme sites as illustrated in Fig.3 A. The deletion mutants of proHB-EGF were derived from pTHG-1 (11.Mitamura T. Higashiyama S. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Biol.

These alterations resulted in amino acid substitutions of P149E, T160G, and T161S. The deletions were made by digesting proHB-EGF cDNA with corresponding restriction enzyme sites and linking them with oligonucleotide. In the case of the FRM construct, synthetic nucleotide of the corresponding region of transferrin receptor was inserted. ΔCyto was made by introducing stop codon at the 530 base pair by site-directed mutagenesis. HB-EGF/TGF-α chimeras were based on the mutant proHB-EGF, which has additional BalI, XhoI, and BamHI sites (see Ref. 11.Mitamura T. Higashiyama S. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Biol.

Each domain of TGF-α was generated by polymerase chain reaction using the corresponding primer and inserted into HB-EGF cDNA digested by corresponding restriction enzymes. To construct TGJ, synthetic nucleotide corresponding to the juxtamembrane domain of TGF-α was inserted into HB-EGF cDNA digested by XhoI andBamHI (Fig. 5 A). Monkey Vero cells, human HT1080D cells, mouse L cells, and their derivatives were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin.

Transfection of plasmids into recipient cells was done as described previously (18.Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were cultured for 48 h and then used for further studies. LC, LH, and LCH cells are stable transfectants of L cells expressing monkey CD9 alone, human proHB-EGF alone and both monkey CD9 and human HB-EGF, respectively (7.Iwamoto R. Higashiyama S. Mitamura T. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2322-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Stable transfectants expressing TG-E alone (L/TGE cell) or both TG-E and CD9 (L/TGE/D cell) were isolated from L cells in a selection medium containing 40 μg/ml of G418 after transfection with each of the plasmids. HT1080D cells were cloned in the selection medium containing 40 μg/ml of G418 after transfection with monkey CD9 into HT1080 cells. VeroHKa cells were Vero cells stably expressing proHB-EGF and CD82. Cell surface biotinylation was carried out as described previously (14.Nakamura K. Iwamoto R. Mekada E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1691-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed and incubated in a biotinylating solution containing 0.2 mg/ml NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) for 30 min at 4 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 40 mm of glycine. For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed with HBS (10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0) containing 10 mm CHAPS, 10 μg/ml chymostatin, and 20 μg/ml antipain. The lysates were cleared of insoluble material by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was precipitated with primary antibodies at a concentration of 5 μg/ml followed by the addition of Sepharose 4B-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies. The gel was washed with washing buffer (HBS containing 10 mm CHAPS) then boiled with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Material recovered from the gel was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Samples subjected to SDS-PAGE were electrotransferred to an Immobilon membrane. The membrane was blocked with TBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) at room temperature for 1 h, and proteins were detected by incubation with 100 ng/ml horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin (Pierce), then analyzed with an ECL-Western blotting kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Binding of125I-labeled DT to cells was measured as described previously (12.Mitamura T. Umata T. Nakano F. Shishido Y. Toyoda T. Itai A. Kimura H. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27084-27090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding of 125I-DT was assessed in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled DT. Specific binding was determined by subtracting the nonspecific binding from the total binding obtained with 125I-DT alone. The amount of DT bound to the cells was calculated from the value of the specific binding of DT. The amounts of proHB-EGF expressed on the cell surface were determined as described previously (12.Mitamura T. Umata T. Nakano F. Shishido Y. Toyoda T. Itai A. Kimura H. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27084-27090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with 5 μg/ml anti-HB-EGF antibody in binding medium at 4 °C for 2 h. After washing three times, cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml 125I-secondary antibody in binding medium. Finally cells were washed with washing buffer three times, and the cell-associated radioactivity was counted. DT binding activity was expressed as the calculated value B/A, in whichA is the amount of proHB-EGF expressed on the cell surface, whereas B is the amount of DT bound to the cells. Juxtacrine mitogenic activity of proHB-EGF was monitored by measuring the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA of EP170.7 cells as described previously (6.Higashiyama S. Iwamoto R. Goishi K. Raab G. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Stable transfectants were plated in 24-well plates and incubated for 1 day. The cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2m NaCl and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min. The fixed cells were washed twice with 10% fetal calf serum/RPMI 1640, and EP170.7 cells were added in co-culture. After incubation for 36 h, [3H]thymidine (37 kBq/ml) was added to the well, and the co-culture cells were incubated for 4 h. The EP170.7 cells were harvested and analyzed for incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA. We have shown that proHB-EGF forms a complex with CD9 and integrin α3β1 (14.Nakamura K. Iwamoto R. Mekada E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1691-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Recent studies also show that integrins α3β1 and α6β1 associate with not only CD9 but also other TM4SF proteins including CD63 and CD81 (19.Berditchevski F. Zutter M.M. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TM4SF proteins including CD9, CD63, CD81, and CD82 have a tendency to associate each other (20.Imai T. Yoshie O. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6470-6481PubMed Google Scholar). We examined whether other members of the TM4SF associate with proHB-EGF by co-precipitation experiments using a lysate of VeroHKa cells. VeroHKa cells are stable transfectants of Vero cells overexpressing proHB-EGF and CD82 and also endogenously express CD9, CD63, and CD81 of TM4SF. Cell lysates of surface-biotinylated VeroHKa cells were immunoprecipitated with specific antibody against CD9, CD63, CD81, or CD82, and the precipitated material was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting followed by staining of the biotinylated proteins. Anti-CD9 antibody precipitated integrin α3β1, proHB-EGF, and unidentified proteins including those at 95 and 48 kDa and other minor bands, as well as CD9 itself, as previously shown (14.Nakamura K. Iwamoto R. Mekada E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1691-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1,A and B, lane 2). Antibodies against CD63, CD81, and CD82 also co-precipitated integrin α3β1 and proHB-EGF (Fig. 1,A and B, lanes 3–5). Western blotting analysis of co-precipitated material probed with anti-integrin α3 antibody confirmed that the band at 150 kDa was integrin α3 (Fig. 1 C). Similarly, anti-proHB-EGF antibody confirmed that the bands at 20–27 kDa were proHB-EGF (data not shown). However, the bands of CD63 and CD82, which generally migrate over a broad range because of their extensive glycosylation, were difficult to see in precipitates of the biotinylated cell lysate, as previously mentioned (19.Berditchevski F. Zutter M.M. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Associations among TM4SF proteins were also detected. Anti-CD63, -CD81, and -CD82 antibodies co-precipitated the 27-kDa band of CD9 (Fig. 1 A,lanes 3–5), as confirmed by Western blotting using anti-CD9 antibody (data not shown). Western blotting analysis also revealed the co-precipitation of CD63 and CD81 with anti-CD9 antibody (data not shown). These results indicated that CD63, CD81, and CD82 also associate with proHB-EGF and that these TM4SF proteins are included in the integrin α3β1, CD9, and proHB-EGF complex. CD9 associates with proHB-EGF, and it up-regulates both DT binding activity and the mitogenic activity of proHB-EGF. We tested whether other TM4SF molecules up-regulate DT binding activity of proHB-EGF, as with CD9. LH cells, stable transformants of L cells expressing human proHB-EGF, were transfected with plasmids encoding cDNA of CD9, CD63, CD81, or CD82, and the amounts of 125I-labeled DT bound to the cell surfaces of the transfected cells were measured. Transfection efficiency was about 60% for all transfections, and the expression of transfected cDNA at the cell surface was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence. proHB-EGF molecules expressed on cell surfaces were determined by the binding of the anti-HB-EGF antibody followed by the 125I-labeled secondary antibody. DT binding activity was normalized from the amount of proHB-EGF molecules expressed on the cell surface as described previously (12.Mitamura T. Umata T. Nakano F. Shishido Y. Toyoda T. Itai A. Kimura H. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27084-27090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although CD63, CD81, and CD82 are able to associate with proHB-EGF, these TM4SF molecules did not enhance the DT binding activity of proHB-EGF at all (Fig. 2 A). Similar results were obtained using stable transfectants of LH cells expressing each of the TM4SF molecules (data not shown). CD63, CD81, and CD82 associate with proHB-EGF but do not up-regulate DT binding activity of proHB-EGF. These results raise the possibility that CD63, CD81, or CD82 may inhibit the effect of CD9 in a competitive manner. We examined this possibility using HT1080D cells that are stable transformants of HT1080 cells expressing CD9. HT1080D cells express low amounts of human proHB-EGF endogeneously. After transfection with CD63, CD81, or CD82 into HT1080D cells, the DT binding activity of proHB-EGF was measured. As shown in Fig.2 B, the ectopic expression of these TM4SF proteins diminished the up-regulation effect of CD9. These results indicate that CD63, CD81, and CD82 have the ability to reduce the effect of CD9. However, because TM4SF proteins including CD9 associate with each other, the possibility cannot be ruled out that the association of TM4SF proteins with proHB-EGF in the present study is indirect,i.e. merely a consequence of their interaction with CD9. Thus, their ability to inhibit the potentiation of proHB-EGF activity by CD9 might be attributable to sequestration of CD9. No more enhancement of DT binding activity was observed from further transfection with CD9, probably because CD9 was saturated in HT1080D cells Next we determined the domain within CD9 that is essential for up-regulation of proHB-EGF. To examine this we made chimeric constructs between CD9 and CD81 and tested which chimeric molecules up-regulated the DT binding activity of proHB-EGF. Because CD63, CD81, and CD82 associate with proHB-EGF but do not up-regulate the DT binding activity (Fig. 2 A), these molecules could thus be candidates for being partners of chimeric molecules. Among these TM4SF we selected CD81 as the partner. This because CD81 was localized predominantly at the cell surface, similar to CD9 (data not shown), whereas the majority of CD63 and CD82 was localized in lysosomes and other intracellular vesicles. The schematic structures of the chimeric constructs studied here are shown in Fig.3 A. Plasmids encoding the chimeric constructs were transfected into LH cells, and the DT binding activity of the cells was measured. All the chimeric molecules were expressed on the cell surface in the expected sizes and associated with proHB-EGF as shown in co-immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-CD9 antibody or anti-CD81 antibody (data not shown). Among the chimeric constructs, DR11 and TA2 enhanced DT binding activity, whereas DR8 did not enhance it (Fig. 3 B). These results indicated that the second extracellular loop of CD9 is important for up-regulation. We also studied the domain(s) within proHB-EGF necessary for up-regulation by CD9. To examine this we made deletion mutants of proHB-EGF. proHB-EGF can be structurally divided into seven domains: pre, pro, heparin-binding, EGF-like, juxtamembrane, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains. Of these domains, the heparin-binding, EGF-like, juxtamembrane, or cytoplasmic domain was deleted, and the constructs were termed ΔHBD, ΔEGF, ΔJxM, and ΔCyto, respectively. FRM is a chimeric construct in which the transmembrane domain of proHB-EGF was substituted to that of the transferrin receptor. Because the transmembrane domain is essential for anchoring of membrane proteins, a mutant form lacking transmembrane domain was not constructed. Schematic structures of these constructs are shown in Fig.4 A. It should be noted that deletion mutants shown here were made from the pseudo-wild type of proHB-EGF, which has amino acid substitutions of P149E, T160G, and T161G. The pseudo-wild type had DT binding activity, which was as up-regulated by CD9 as that of wild type proHB-EGF. Plasmids encoding each proHB-EGF mutant and plasmids encoding CD9 or vectors only were introduced into L cells. These deletion mutants were expressed on the cell surface of the L cells in expected sizes and coprecipitated with CD9 (Fig. 4 B). The DT binding activity of the transfected cells was next determined. The results are shown in Fig. 4 C. Under these conditions DT binding activity of wild type proHB-EGF was up-regulated about 15-fold by the transfection with CD9. ΔHBD, ΔCyto, and FRM were significantly up-regulated by CD9, although the up-regulation for FRM seemed to be lower than wild type. These results indicated that the heparin-binding, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains were not essential for up-regulation and that the remaining domains must be responsible for the up-regulation. Because DT binding activity was not observed in the cells transfected with ΔEGF or ΔJxM, regardless of the presence or absence of CD9, the effect of CD9 on the DT binding activity of ΔEGF or ΔJxM could not be determined. ΔEGF and ΔJxM were expressed on the cell surface in amounts similar to wild type proHB-EGF (data not shown); therefore deletion of these domains must cause a loss of DT binding activity. The loss of DT binding activity in ΔEGF is reasonable because DT binds to the EGF-like domain of proHB-EGF (11.Mitamura T. Higashiyama S. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1015-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The failure of ΔJxM DT binding is surprising and is probably due to the impaired access of DT to the EGF-like domain of proHB-EGF without the juxtamembrane domain. 2T. Takahashi and E. Mekada, manuscript in preparation. Deletion mutant analysis still retained the possibility that either the EGF-like or the juxtamembrane domain was responsible for the up-regulation mechanism. To determine the domain necessary for up-regulation, we made a series of chimeric constructs between proHB-EGF and TGF-α. TGF-α does not bind DT (11.Mitamura T. Higashiyama S. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1015-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), and the juxtacrine mitogenic activity of TGF-α is not up-regulated by CD9 (6.Higashiyama S. Iwamoto R. Goishi K. Raab G. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). N-terminal regions containing pre, pro, and heparin-binding, EGF-like, and juxtamembrane domains or both transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of proHB-EGF were replaced with the corresponding domains of TGF-α, termed TGN, TGE, TGJ, or TGMC, respectively, as illustrated in Fig.5 A. TGNJMC, the chimera in which the EGF-like domain of proTGF-α was replaced with that of proHB-EGF was also constructed. These chimeras were transfected into L cells with or without CD9 cDNA, and DT binding activity was determined. As shown in Fig. 5 B, DT binding of TGN, TGJ, and TGMC were up-regulated 5–10 fold by the expression of CD9, whereas that of wild type proHB-EGF was 10-fold. Consistent with the deletion analysis, the substitution of the N-terminal, juxtamembrane, transmembrane, or cytoplasmic domain with the corresponding domain of TGF-α did not affect the up-regulation properties. TGE had no DT binding activity, as expected, and thus the effect of CD9 could not be determined. It is also noteworthy that the DT binding of TGNJMC was also up-regulated by the expression of CD9. These results indicate that the pre, pro, heparin-binding, juxtamembrane, and cytoplasmic domains are not essential and that these domains are dispensable to the corresponding domains of TGF-α for up-regulation by CD9, whereas the EGF-like domain of proHB-EGF is responsible for up-regulation. Although the above studies indicated that the EGF-like domain of proHB-EGF would be essential for up-regulation by CD9, DT does not bind to the EGF-like domain of TGF-α and thus up-regulation of DT binding activity in TGE by CD9 could not be directly determined. To examine whether the replacement of the EGF-like domain of proHB-EGF by that of TGF-α results in the loss of up-regulation, juxtacrine growth factor assay was performed as described previously (6.Higashiyama S. Iwamoto R. Goishi K. Raab G. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). To do this assay we used stable transfectants expressing proHB-EGF alone (LH), TGE alone (L/TGE), both proHB-EGF and CD9 (LCH), or both TGE and CD9 (L/TGE/D). As shown in Fig. 6 A, LCH cells display much higher juxtacrine activity than LH cells, despite LCH cells expressing lower numbers of proHB-EGF molecules on the cell surface (Fig. 6 B). In the case of TGE, two independently isolated clones of L/TGE4/D (L/TGE4/D2 and L/TGE4/D7) cells had rather lower juxtacrine activity than L/TGE4 cells (Fig. 6 A), although these three cell lines expressed similar numbers of TGE molecules on the cell surface (Fig. 6 B). Similar results were also obtained using other stable transfectant cell lines, L/TGE15 and L/TGE15/D2 (data not shown). These results indicated that the juxtacrine growth factor activity of TG-E was not up-regulated by CD9. From our DT binding and juxtacrine mitogenic assays, we concluded that the EGF-like domain of proHB-EGF is essential for up-regulation by CD9. A number of TM4SF proteins have been described in a wide variety of animal cells (16.Maecker H.T. Todd S.C. Levy S. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 428-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). A characteristic feature of this family of proteins is to form complexes with a variety of membrane proteins. They are thus supposed to be “adapters for membrane proteins” or “molecular facilitators” that mediate the formation of large molecular complexes and allow them to function more efficiently. CD9 is one of the best characterized TM4SF members, and a number of studies have suggested that CD9 is involved in cell signaling (21.Tai X.G. Yashiro Y. Abe R. Toyooka K. Wood C.R. Morris J. Long A.

However, despite such fundamental roles, evidence to demonstrate the role of CD9 in molecular complexes is limited. One of the functions of CD9 clearly demonstrated is the up-regulation activity of CD9 for proHB-EGF. We originally identified CD9 as a diphtheria toxin receptor-associated protein (15.Iwamoto R. Senoh H. Okada Y. Uchida T. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20463-20469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In subsequent studies we have shown that CD9 greatly up-regulates DT binding activity and the juxtacrine activity of proHB-EGF (6.Higashiyama S. Iwamoto R. Goishi K. Raab G. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 7.Iwamoto R. Higashiyama S. Mitamura T. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2322-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Here we study the molecular mechanism of up-regulation by analyzing essential regions of both CD9 and proHB-EGF for up-regulation activity. Results obtained from these studies are useful for understanding the molecular nature of the complex formation. Previous studies indicated that the number of proHB-EGF molecules at the cell surface was not changed in the presence or absence of CD9 (7.Iwamoto R. Higashiyama S. Mitamura T. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2322-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Furthermore, direct binding of DT with CD9 has not been detected. Scatchard plot analysis of DT binding to proHB-EGF indicated that increased DT binding with CD9 is due to an increase in the number of effective binding sites for DT rather than any increased binding affinity for DT (7.Iwamoto R. Higashiyama S. Mitamura T. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2322-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Therefore, an increase in the number of effective binding sites must be attributable to protein-protein interaction between proHB-EGF and CD9. Co-precipitation studies showed that not only CD9 but also CD63, CD81, and CD82 are associated with proHB-EGF and integrin α3β1. However, among these TM4SF proteins only CD9 up-regulated the DT binding activity of proHB-EGF. We took advantage of the inability of CD81 to up-regulate to analyze the region necessary for up-regulation. A series of chimeric molecules was made to analyze the region of CD9 essential for up-regulation. All the chimeric molecules expressed on the cell surface, but only constructs that had a second extracellular domain of CD9 had up-regulation activity. Hence, we concluded that the second loop of CD9 is sufficient for up-regulation and that all of the transmembrane domains and the first loop between the first and the second transmembrane domains are exchangeable with CD81. Consistant with our present results, a recent report has suggested that the latter half of CD9 is necessary for up-regulation of DT sensitivity (35.Lagaudriere Gesbert C. Le Naour F. Lebel Binay S. Billard M. Lemichez E. Boquet P. Boucheix C. Conjeaud H. Rubinstein E. Cell Immunol. 1997; 182: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We also studied the domain of proHB-EGF necessary for up-regulation by using a series of deletion mutants of proHB-EGF and chimeric molecules between proHB-EGF and TGF-α. DT binding assay revealed that none of the domains of proHB-EGF, except for the EGF-like domain, were essential for up-regulation, whereas the chimeras that have the EGF-like domain of proHB-EGF were all up-regulated by CD9, suggesting the involvement of the EGF-like domain in up-regulation. The chimeric molecule TGE, which has the EGF-like domain of TGF-α, does not bind to DT; thus up-regulation of DT binding was not determined by this chimera. To circumvent this difficulty, juxtacrine mitogenic assay was performed, and the results showed that juxtacrine activity of TGE is not up-regulated by CD9. Thus, the domain of proHB-EGF necessary for up-regulation is the EGF-like domain. From these results, together with data obtained from CD9/CD81 chimera, we concluded that the extracellular domains of CD9 and the EGF-like domain of proHB-EGF are important for up-regulation. Our studies demonstrated that proHB-EGF associated with CD63, CD81, and CD82 as well as with CD9, but these TM4SF proteins and some CD9/CD81 chimera failed to up-regulate DT binding activity. Moreover, it was shown that TGE was associated with CD9 (Fig. 4 B) but that the juxtacrine activity was not up-regulated by CD9. Therefore, association of CD9 with proHB-EGF is probably essential but is not enough for up-regulation. We attempted to define the domains responsible for the association of proHB-EGF and CD9 in this study. However, because all of the deletion mutants of proHB-EGF, including ΔEGF and FRM, were co-precipitated with CD9, at more or less the same efficiency compared with wild type proHB-EGF, these studies did not allow us to define a particular domain of proHB-EGF necessary for association. These results may suggest that multiple domains,e.g. the EGF-like domain and the transmembrane domain, are involved in association, but the possibility of the artifact being due to the overexpression of CD9 and proHB-EGF cannot be ruled out. The present study showed that not only CD9 but also other TM4SF members are associated with proHB-EGF. The role of the TM4SF members in this complex is unclear, but they would have different functions at cell-cell contact sites, because only CD9 of these TM4SF members up-regulates proHB-EGF. Subcellular localization of each TM4SF member seems to be different. Immunofluorescence studies showed that CD9 and CD81 localized mainly at the cell surface, whereas CD63 mainly localizes at lysosomes and secreted vesicles. Thus CD63 may have functions in the transport of proHB-EGF or integrin α3β1 to or from cell surfaces. Consistent with this notion, association of CD63 with PI4 kinase has been reported, and its role for integrin internalization has been suggested (36.Hemler E.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Diphtheria toxin is internalized with proHB-EGF, but the domains responsible for internalization have not been found. It would be intriguing to speculate that internalization of DT-bound proHB-EGF is achieved by assistance from a TM4SF member. Further study is needed to clarify the role of each TM4SF member in the complex. In conclusion, the present domain analysis of CD9 and proHB-EGF suggests the importance of the interactions of both molecules at their extracellular domains. The precise molecular mechanism for up-regulation still remains to be clarified. Further studies, especially of the extracellular domains, would help with understanding the molecular mechanism of up-regulation and also help to create dominant negative forms of these proteins."

To inhibit this inducible signaling to the nucleus, we designed a cyclic peptide (cSN50) containing a cell-permeable motif and a cyclized form of the nuclear localization sequence for the p50-NF-κB1 subunit of NF-κB. When delivered into cultured macrophages treated with the pro-inflammatory agonist lipopolysaccharide, cSN50 was a more efficient inhibitor of NF-κB nuclear import than its linear analog. When delivered into mice challenged with lipopolysaccharide, cSN50 potently blocked the production of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor α and interferon γ) and significantly reduced the lethality associated with ensuing endotoxic shock. Based on specificity studies conducted with a mutated form of cSN50, a functional nuclear localization motif is required for this protective effect. Taken together, our findings demonstrate effective targeting of a cell-permeable peptide that attenuates cytokine signaling in vivo. This new class of biological response modifiers may be applicable to the control of systemic inflammatory reactions.

Three of the key mediators of these localized and systemic responses are the cytokines, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα),1 interferon γ (IFNγ), and interleukin 1 (IL-1). The genes encoding these cytokines are activated in response to inflammatory, immune, and oxidative stress via a mechanism involving nuclear translocation of stress-responsive transcription factors (SRTFs). As exemplified by NF-κB and NFAT, SRTFs are sequestered in the cytoplasm and mobilized to the nucleus following cellular stimulation (3.Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5570) Google Scholar, 4.Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6842-6844Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 5.Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev.

In turn, SRTFs interact with specific cognate sites present in the promoter region of genes encoding mediators of inflammatory and immune responses. For example, the gene encoding TNFα is regulated by NF-κB, NFAT, and ATF2/Jun, whereas the gene encoding IFNγ is controlled by NF-κB and NFAT (7.Goldfeld A.E. McCaffrey P.G. Strominger J.L. Rao A. J.

Cytokine-mediated systemic inflammatory response can be evoked by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (10.Hawiger J. Brigham K.L. Endotoxin and the Lungs. 77.

Persistent nuclear translocation of NF-κB in human and mouse mononuclear phagocytic cells correlates with the lethal outcome of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (19.Bohrer H. Qui F. Zimmerman T. Zhang Y. Jllmer T. Mannel D. Bottiger B.W. Stern D.M. Waldherr R. Saeger H.-D. Ziegler R. Bierhaus A. Martin E. Nawroth P.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 972-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Thus, development of this syndrome involves a multiplex process that is triggered by mobilization of NF-κB and other SRTFs to their nuclear sites of action and by systemic expression of proinflammatory cytokine mediators. TNFα and IFNγ play a key role in the systemic inflammatory response syndrome induced by LPS, which has lethal effects in experimental animals. In keeping with this concept, animals deficient in receptors for these cytokines are resistant to lethal endotoxic shock (11.Car B.D. Eng V.M. Schnyder B. Ozmen L. Huang S. Gallay P. Heumann D.

Thus, controlling the expression of these cytokine genes could provide an opportunity to ameliorate the ensuing systemic inflammatory responses. Considering the regulatory linkage between SRTFs and cytokine gene expression, we developed a method for noninvasive, intracellular delivery of peptides that interfere with SRTF signaling (for review see Ref. 22.Hawiger J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The cell-permeable SN50 peptide we designed for these studies carries the hydrophobic region (h region) of the signal peptide as a membrane translocating motif and a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) derived from the p50-NF-κB1 subunit of transcription factor NF-κB. This linear peptide inhibits the nuclear import of NF-κB in human monocytic cells and murine endothelial cells stimulated with the proinflammatory agonists LPS and TNFα (23.Lin Y.Z. Yao S.Y. Veach R.A. Torgerson T.R. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14255-14258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). The SN50 peptide also inhibits the inducible nuclear import of AP-1, NFAT, and signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (24.Torgerson T.R. Colosia A.D. Donahue J.P. Lin Y.Z. Hawiger J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6084-6092PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Zhang L. Torgerson T.R. Liu X.Y. Timmons S. Colosia A.D. Hawiger J. Tam J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9184-9189Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In terms of its mechanism of action, we have demonstrated in prior studies that the SN50 peptide interacts in vitro with a cytoplasmic NLS receptor comprised of the Rch 1/importin (karyopherin)-β heterodimer (24.Torgerson T.R. Colosia A.D. Donahue J.P. Lin Y.Z. Hawiger J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6084-6092PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide-directed interference with nuclear import of SRTFs in cultured cells attenuates the inducible expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX 2) protein (26.Abate A. Oberle S. Schroder H. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 1998; 56: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and the level of mRNA transcripts of the IL-2 and Fas ligand genes (24.Torgerson T.R. Colosia A.D. Donahue J.P. Lin Y.Z. Hawiger J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6084-6092PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Kasibhatla S. Genestier L. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 987-992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). These data indicate that SN50 affects downstream SRTF-regulated genes. In this report, we demonstrate that in vivo delivery of a more potent cyclic analog (cSN50) of this cell-permeable inhibitor of inducible nuclear import of NF-κB and other SRTFs suppresses systemic expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes and reduces LPS lethality. The SN50 and SM peptides were synthesized, purified, filter-sterilized, and analyzed as described elsewhere (23.Lin Y.Z. Yao S.Y. Veach R.A. Torgerson T.R. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14255-14258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar, 24.Torgerson T.R. Colosia A.D. Donahue J.P. Lin Y.Z. Hawiger J. J.

A. 1998; 95: 9184-9189Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The SN50 peptide carries an NLS derived from NF-κB1 (p50), whereas the SM peptide functional motif contains NLS mutations that preclude recognition by the NLS receptor, importin α (also called karyopherin α or Rch 1) (24.Torgerson T.R. Colosia A.D. Donahue J.P. Lin Y.Z. Hawiger J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6084-6092PubMed Google Scholar). The cSN50 peptide was synthesized and analyzed in a similar manner. To assure an efficient coupling of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC; Pierce Chemical, Rockford, IL) to cSN50, three glycine residues were added to the NH2 terminus of cSN50. The coupling of FITC was done according to the manufacturer's manual. Murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). These cells were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum containing no detectable LPS (< 0.006 ng/ml as determined by the manufacturer, Atlanta Biological, Norcross, GA), 2 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics. Intracellular persistence of cSN50 and SN50 peptides in cultured macrophage RAW 264.7 cells was done by pulsing the cells with either peptide (5 μm) for 30 min, removing cells by centrifugation, and resuspending them in fresh MEM with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. The cells were grown on chamber slides, and at specified time intervals (3–10 h) the cells were examined by indirect fluorescence with the rabbit antibody against epitope tag (LMP) present in both peptides as described previously (23.Lin Y.Z. Yao S.Y. Veach R.A. Torgerson T.R. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14255-14258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Intracellular location of FITC-cSN50 peptide in cultured macrophage RAW 264.7 cells was done by confocal laser scanning microscopy using direct fluorescence (28.Liu X.-Y. Timmons S. Lin Y.-Z. Hawiger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11819-11824Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).In vivo detection of FITC-cSN50 peptide in blood cells and in spleen cells of C57Bl/6 mice following intraperitoneal injection was done using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. Briefly, whole blood was collected from the periorbital plexus into heparin-containing tubes 20 min after intraperitoneal injection of 190 nanomoles of FITC-cSN50 peptide (0.7 mg) or equimolar concentration of FITC. White blood cell-rich fraction was prepared by differential centrifugation followed by the lysis of residual erythrocytes and analyzed by FACS. The mice were immediately sacrificed after blood collection and their spleens were excised, rinsed in PBS, and gently homogenized between two microscopic slides. The erythrocytes were removed by a brief hypotonic lysis. The spleen cells were spun down and resuspended in PBS supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and analyzed by FACS. Separately, blood samples containing erythrocytes and the total spleen cell population (erythrocytes included) were analyzed by FACS. FACS analysis (FACSCalibur; Becton and Dickinson, San Jose, CA) was done using forward versus side light scatter, and green fluorescence was collected with a 530 ± 30-nanometer band pass filter. Where indicated, 80% confluent monolayers of murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 (100-mm plates with 10 ml of fresh medium) were stimulated with LPS from Escherichia coli 0127:B8 (Difco, Detroit, MI) at 30 ng for 30 min. Nuclear import of NF-κB in RAW 264.7 was measured by electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay using a radiolabeled κB probe (14.Cordle S.R. Donald R. Read M.A. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11803-11810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Donald R. Ballard D.W. Hawiger J. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1998; 161: 6084-6092PubMed Google Scholar). Inducible nuclear import of AP-1 and NFAT was measured in Jurkat T cells as described elsewhere (24.Torgerson T.R. Colosia A.D. Donahue J.P. Lin Y.Z. Hawiger J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6084-6092PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Zhang L. Torgerson T.R. Liu X.Y. Timmons S. Colosia A.D. Hawiger J. Tam J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9184-9189Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Gels were dried onto chromatography paper and exposed to Fuji FLA 2000 imager plates (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan) for quantitation and then to Kodak Biomax MR autoradiography film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). The effects of cell-permeable peptides on the nuclear import of SRTF was quantitated in the phosphoimager by subtracting the radioactive content of nucleoprotein complexes obtained using unstimulated cell nuclear extracts from the content measured in nuclear extracts from stimulated cells. The resulting value was normalized to 100% as the maximal inducible nuclear import. The value obtained in cells treated with cell-permeable peptide was similarly obtained and subtracted from 100% of inducible nuclear import to determine the percent inhibition. Blood samples from saphenous veins were collected in heparinized tubes at indicated times. Aliquots of plasma were kept at −80 °C until assayed for the cytokine levels using ELISA kits specific for TNFα and IFNγ (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Serial dilutions were made to determine the cytokine concentrations by comparison with the standard according to the manufacturer's instruction. Female C57BL/6 mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) that were 8–12 weeks old (20 g weight) were injected intraperitoneally with LPS (200 microliters, 4 mg/ml) from E. coli 0127:B8 (Difco). Cell-permeable cSN50, SN50 and SM peptides, or 0.8% pyrogen-free saline (diluent) were injected intraperitoneally before (30 min) and after (30, 90, 150, and 210 min and 6 and 12 h) LPS challenge. In experiments presented in Fig. 4 D, the cSN50 peptide was not injected before LPS. Injections followed LPS challenge at 30, 90, 150, and 210 min and 6, 12, and 24 h. All injected agents were sterile and prepared in pyrogen-free saline. Animals were observed at 2-h intervals during the first 8 h, at 4-h intervals during the subsequent 16 h, and twice daily thereafter. Autopsies were performed shortly after death. Surviving animals were observed for 3 days in most experimental groups or for 10 days in the groups shown in Fig. 4, B and D, after which they were sacrificed and autopsied. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of the liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys were stained with hematoxylin and eosin to assess overall histology. Animal handling and experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the American Association of Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care guidelines and approved by the Institutional Animal Care Committee. A cell-permeable cyclic peptide termed cSN50 was designed by inserting two cysteines flanking the NLS motif of the p50-NF-κB1 to form an intrachain disulfide bond (TableI). In addition, FITC-conjugated cSN50 peptide (FITC-cSN50) was synthesized to monitor its intracellular location in cultured cells in vitro and in blood and spleen cells in vivo. As shown in Fig.1 A, fluorescence confocal laser scanning microscopy of cultured murine RAW 264.7 macrophages demonstrated intracellular accumulation of the FITC-cSN50 peptide. This finding is concordant with prior studies of its linear analog, SN50 (23.Lin Y.Z. Yao S.Y. Veach R.A. Torgerson T.R. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14255-14258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic localization of FITC-cSN50 peptide is consistent with the intracellular distribution of its target, importin α (karyopherin α), in non-stimulated cells (24.Torgerson T.R. Colosia A.D. Donahue J.P. Lin Y.Z. Hawiger J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6084-6092PubMed Google Scholar). When intracellular persistence of cSN50 and SN50 peptides was analyzed using indirect fluorescence (see “Experimental Procedures”) no detectable differences were observed (data not shown).Table ISequences of cSN50, SN50, and SM peptidesPeptideCell-permeable sequence NLS motif or its mutantcSN50 peptideAAVALLPAVLLALLAPCYVQRKRQKLMPCFITC-cSN50 peptide(FITC)GGGAAVALLPAVLLALLAPCYVQRKRQKLMPCSN50 peptideAAVALLPAVLLALLAPVQRKRQKLMPSM peptideAAVALLPAVLLALLAPAAADQNQLMPSequences are given in single letter amino acid code.

Macrophages are known targets for the proinflammatory agonist, LPS, which can induce endotoxic shock. When tested in LPS-stimulated murine RAW264.7 macrophages, cSN50 inhibited the nuclear import of NF-κB at a concentration of 10 to 30 μm as compared with the 30–100-μm inhibitory range for SN50 peptide (Fig.1 B). During the same experiment the constitutively expressed nuclear CCAAT-binding factor, NF-Y, remained unchanged (results not shown). Based on quantitative phosphoimager analyses of these experiments (n = 3) presented in Fig. 1 C, cSN50 was 3 times more potent than the linear SN50 peptide (IC50 = 7 versus 21 μm). The cSN50 peptide was 3–10 times more inhibitory than the SN50 peptide toward the nuclear import of AP-1 and NFAT, respectively, when analyzed in Jurkat T cells stimulated with phorbol ester and ionomycin (results not shown). These experiments with the cultured cells provided a basis for the in vivo delivery of cSN50 to examine its effect on the expression of cytokine genes and the outcome of LPS-induced lethal shock. To determine whether cell-permeable cSN50 peptide injected intraperitoneally is delivered to blood cells and to the spleen, peripheral blood leukocytes and lymphocytes, as well as isolated spleen cells, were analyzed by FACS. As shown in Fig.2, FACS analysis of the leukocyte/lymphocyte-rich fraction prepared from blood collected 20 min after intraperitoneal injection of FITC-cSN50 (0.7 mg) showed its transfer to circulating white blood cells based on a strong fluorescence signal detectable in examined cells (green tracing). Leukocytes and lymphocytes prepared from the blood of control mice injected with unconjugated FITC produced a background signal (red tracing) similar to that observed in leukocytes and lymphocytes isolated from the blood of animals receiving intraperitoneal saline injection (black tracing). Monitoring the delivery of FITC-cSN50 peptide to spleen cells, predominantly T and B lymphocytes, showed a strong fluorescence gain as compared with that measured in splenocytes obtained from mice injected with unconjugated FITC or saline (Fig. 2). FITC-cSN50 peptide was also detectable in other blood cell fractions, including red blood cells, analyzed by FACS (results not shown). There was no detectable hemolysis in blood samples collected from cell-permeable peptide-treated animals. These results indicate that FITC-cSN50 peptide injected intraperitoneally was rapidly delivered to circulating blood cells and to the spleen. This type of analysis cannot establish what fraction of intraperitoneally injected FITC-cSN50 peptide was delivered to blood and spleen cells. Injection of LPS into humans, primates, or mice leads to an early burst of proinflammatory cytokine mediators of endotoxic shock such as TNFα, IL-1, and IFNγ (29.Tracey K.J. Fong Y. Hesse D.G.

To test whether in vivo delivery of cSN50 will attenuate expression of cytokine genes regulated by NF-κB and other SRTFs, we injected C57BL/6 mice intraperitoneally with 800 μg of LPS from E. coli serotype 0127:B8 (LD100 = 800 μg). Consistent with prior studies (36.Amiot F. Fitting C. Tracey K.J. Cavaillon J.M. Dautry F. Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 864-875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), mice challenged with LPS showed an early burst of TNFα expression at 1–2 h, followed by increased IFNγ production peaking at 24 h (Fig. 3). In contrast, there was no rise in TNFα expression in the cSN50 peptide-treated mice (1.5 mg given intraperitoneally in 7 injections 30 min before to 12 h after LPS challenge). This effect was statistically significant (p < 0.004) using the area under the curve method and the Student's t test (37.Altman D.G. Practical Statistics for Medical Research. Chapman & Hall, London1991: 430-433Google Scholar). Likewise, the more progressive rise of IFNγ in LPS-challenged mice was suppressed by cSN50 peptide (p < 0.04). Thus, in vivo delivery of cSN50 resulted in a striking attenuation of expression of genes encoding two key proinflammatory mediators of endotoxic shock, TNFα and IFNγ. This is consistent with prior in vitro data on SN50 peptide-induced attenuation of expression of genes encoding IL-2, Fas ligand, and COX 2 measured as mRNA transcripts or protein levels in cultured cells (24.Torgerson T.R. Colosia A.D. Donahue J.P. Lin Y.Z. Hawiger J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6084-6092PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Abate A. Oberle S. Schroder H. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 1998; 56: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 27.Kasibhatla S. Genestier L. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 987-992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Almost complete in vivo suppression of the key cytokine mediators of endotoxic shock by cSN50 correlated with a reduction in mouse lethality. As shown in Fig.4 A, all LPS-injected animals died within 72 h. In contrast, mice treated with cSN50 (1.5 mg given in 7 injections 30 min before to 12 h after LPS challenge) were essentially protected throughout the 72-h period, as evidenced by the cumulative survival rate of 90% (Fig. 4 B). Survivors observed for the subsequent 10 days showed no apparent signs of disease. This protective effect of cSN50 was reduced (50% survival) when the dose was decreased to 0.7 mg per injection (Fig.4 C). To determine whether the cSN50 peptide reduces lethality when administered after exposure to LPS, the first peptide dose was given 30 min after endotoxin. The survival rate was 60%, indicating that the cSN50 peptide attenuates endotoxic shock, if given shortly after exposure to LPS (Fig. 4 D). The in vivo protective effect was lost if the functional NLS motif was mutated, as in the SM peptide. Mutations in the NLS motif preclude recognition by the NLS receptor, importin α (also called karyopherin α or Rch 1) (24.Torgerson T.R. Colosia A.D. Donahue J.P. Lin Y.Z. Hawiger J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6084-6092PubMed Google Scholar). All SM peptide-treated mice died within 72 h (Fig. 4 E). Based on the log rank test (38.Dawson-Saunders B. Trapp B. Basic and Clinical Biostatistic. 2nd Ed. Appleton & Lange, Norwalk, Connecticut1994: 200-203Google Scholar), the difference in survival rate between cSN50 peptide-treated and control mice was statistically significant (p < 0.001). The cSN50 peptide appears to be at least 3 times more potent in vivothan its linear analog, SN50 (1.5 mg given in 7 injections 30 min before to 12 h after LPS challenge; results not shown). This is consistent with the differences in inhibitory potency in cultured cells (Fig. 1 C). Cumulatively, in vivo data obtained with the cSN50 peptide indicate that this inhibitor of nuclear import of NF-κB and other SRTFs is effective in attenuating systemic expression of proinflammatory cytokine mediators of endotoxic shock and its lethal outcome. When delivered to cultured cells, the cell-permeable cyclic peptide, cSN50, inhibits inducible nuclear import of NF-κB and other SRTFs. We have demonstrated not only in vitro delivery of cSN50 to murine macrophages but in vivo targeting of this new cyclic peptide to blood and spleen cells in mice. Accordingly, we tested whether the in vivo delivery of cSN50 modifies the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and lethal shock in response to LPS. These in vivo experiments demonstrated that cSN50 attenuates expression of genes encoding two key mediators of endotoxic shock, TNFα and IFNγ, as well as provides a highly significant protection of mice from LPS-induced lethal shock. Remarkably, in vivo delivery of cSN50 at its optimal concentration resulted in a 90% survival rate among mice receiving LD100 of LPS. As expected from studies of SN50 (24.Torgerson T.R. Colosia A.D. Donahue J.P. Lin Y.Z. Hawiger J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6084-6092PubMed Google Scholar), its cyclic analog, cSN50, inhibits nuclear import of NF-κB and other SRTFs. However, cyclization of SN50 appears to enhance its inhibitory effects toward NF-κB signaling. The enhanced inhibitory potency of cSN50 does not appear to be due to its longer intracellular persistence than that of SN50 peptide. Rather, it may reflect a higher affinity of cSN50versus SN50 for importin α (karyopherin α), the intracellular target of these peptides (24.Torgerson T.R. Colosia A.D. Donahue J.P. Lin Y.Z. Hawiger J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6084-6092PubMed Google Scholar). The cSN50 peptide fails to inhibit the constitutively expressed nuclear transcription factor, NF-Y, suggesting that the peptide preferentially affects inducible nuclear import. Based on prior studies with SN50 peptide, we postulate that its intracellular target is most likely the cytoplasmic NLS receptor, Rch 1 (importin α/karyopherin α) (24.Torgerson T.R. Colosia A.D. Donahue J.P. Lin Y.Z. Hawiger J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6084-6092PubMed Google Scholar). The broad inhibitory range of cSN50 toward the nuclear import of NF-κB and other SRTFs is an advantage rather than a drawback to its in vivo delivery for the following reasons. First, the cytokine genes that mediate systemic inflammatory response are regulated by multiple SRTFs. In particular, the gene encoding TNFα is regulated by NF-κB, NFAT, and ATF2/Jun, whereas the gene encoding IFNγ is controlled by NF-κB and NFAT (7.Goldfeld A.E. McCaffrey P.G. Strominger J.L. Rao A. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1365-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 8.Tsai E.Y. Yie J. Thanos D. Goldfeld A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5232-5244Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 9.Sica A. Dorman L. Viggiano V. Cippitelli M. Ghosh P. Rice N. Young H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30412-30420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Almost total suppression of TNFα and IFNγ expression by cSN50 in mice challenged with LPS indicates that in vivo inhibition of SRTF-regulated gene transcription was achieved. Second, the requirement for repeated in vivo administration of cSN50 may reflect the time-limited intracellular inhibitory activity of cell-permeable peptides (Refs. 22.Hawiger J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar and 24.Torgerson T.R. Colosia A.D. Donahue J.P. Lin Y.Z. Hawiger J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6084-6092PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown). Hence, its in vivo inhibitory effect on inducible genes expression regulated by SRTFs is reversible. On the other hand, the in vivo kinetics of TNFα and IFNγ induction differs (see Fig. 3), thereby requiring the maintenance of in vivo delivery of cSN50 peptide over the 12-h period. Third, the in vivoinhibitory effect of cSN50 peptide was dependent on the presence of a functional NLS. Mutations that inactivate NLS function yield a cell-permeable peptide (SM) that fails to affect the acute systemic inflammatory response to LPS in this experimental model of lethal shock. Fourth, the cSN50 peptide exhibited no detectable side effects when administered to control animals in the absence of LPS (results not shown). Taken together, these findings suggest that an in vivo delivery of cSN50 is functionally effective and safe. In summary, these experiments indicate that cSN50 can be deliveredin vivo to cells involved in synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines. In turn, the expression of genes encoding these key mediators of endotoxic shock is suppressed, resulting in reduced mortality. Although endogenous inhibitors of cytokine signaling, such as members of the CIS/SOCS/JAB/SSI family, negatively regulate signal transduction (39.Kovanen P.E. Leonard W.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 899-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), all exogenous inhibitors of LPS toxicity testedin vivo and reported until now are targeted toward the interaction of LPS or cytokines with their cognate receptors (29.Tracey K.J.

In contrast, the cell-permeable peptides described here are targeted intracellularly (22.Hawiger J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). As a reversible inhibitor of the nuclear import of SRTFs, cSN50 represents a new class of anti-inflammatory agents capable of suppressing systemic inflammatory responses in vivo. In keeping with this concept, SN50 is protective when delivered to mice challenged with a low dose of LPS in combination withd-galactosamine, 2X. Y. Liu, D. Robinson, R. A. Veach, S. Timmons, R. D. Collins, and J. Hawiger, unpublished observations. which renders mice hypersensitive to LPS (42.Galanos C. Freudenberg M.A. Reutter W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5939-5943Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). In addition, preliminary experiments indicate that in vivo delivery of the cSN50 peptide is effective in blocking lethal shock induced by the superantigen, staphylococcal enterotoxin B, that robustly activates a subset of T cells (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2078613604,"PF1022A belongs to a recently identified class of N-methylated cyclooctadepsipeptides (CODPs) with strong anthelmintic properties. Described here is the cell-free synthesis of this CODP and related structures, as well as the purification and enzymatic characterization of the responsible synthetase. For PF1022A synthesis extracts of Mycelia sterilia were incubated with the precursorsl-leucine, d-lactate,d-phenyllactate, and S-adenosyl-l-methionine in the presence of ATP and MgCl2. A 350-kDa depsipeptide synthetase, PFSYN, responsible for PF1022A synthesis was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. Like other peptide synthetases, PFSYN follows a thiotemplate mechanism in which the substrates are activated as thioesters via adenylation. N-Methylation of the substrate l-leucine takes place after covalent binding prior to peptide bond formation. The enzyme is capable of synthesizing all known natural cyclooctadepsipeptides of the PF1022 type (A, B, C, and D) differing in the content of d-lactate andd-phenyllactate.

PFSYN strongly resembles the well documented enniatin synthetase in size and mechanism. Our results suggest that PFSYN, like enniatin synthetase, is an enzyme with two peptide synthetase domains and forms CODP by repeated condensation of dipeptidol building blocks.

(Tokyo). 1992; 45: 692-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) isolated a new N-methylated cyclodepsipeptide, PF1022A, from the fungus Mycelia sterilia. PF1022A exhibits strong anthelmintic properties in combination with low toxicity and is, therefore, one of the most outstanding anthelmintics to emerge since the discovery of the avermectins and milbemycins (2.Terada M. Ishih A. Tungtrongchitr A. Sano M. Shomura T. Jpn. J. Parasitol. 1993; 42: 199-210Google Scholar, 3.Kachi S. Terada M. Hashimoto H. Jpn. J.

PF1022A belongs to a new class of CODPs1 consisting of four alternating residues of N-methyl-l-leucine and four residues of d-lactate or d-phenyllactate as shown in Fig. 1. Structurally, the PF1022 anthelmintics are related to bassianolide, which is an insecticidal metabolite from the fungus Beauveria bassiana(5.Suzuki A. Kanaoka M. Isogai A. Murakoshi S. Ichinoe M. Tamura S. Tetrahedron Lett. 1977; 25: 2167-2170Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and to the enniatins, a class of N-methylated cyclohexadepsipeptides produced by Fusarium species with manifold biological activities (6.Bergendorff O. Anke H. Dekeermendjian K. Nielsen M. Rudong S. Sterner O. Witt R. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1994; 47: 1560-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 7.Tomoda H. Nishida H. Huang X.H. Masuma R. Kim Y.K. Omura S. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1992; 45: 1207-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Enniatins consist of alternating residues of d-HIV andN-methylated branched chain amino acids likel-valine or l-isoleucine. Enniatins are synthesized by the multifunctional enzyme ESYN, which was the firstN-methyl-cyclopeptide synthetase ever characterized. Biochemical investigations revealed that this enzyme is one single polypeptide chain with a molecular mass of about 350 kDa (8.Zocher R. Keller U. Kleinkauf H. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 28-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 9.Haese A. Schubert M. Herrmann M. Zocher R. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 905-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). All catalytic functions necessary for enniatin synthesis, i.e.ATP-dependent substrate activation, thioacylation reactions, N-methylation, and condensation of the covalently bound substrates, are catalyzed by ESYN in a so-called thiotemplate mechanism (10.Zocher R. Keller U. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1997; 38: 85-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ESYN represents a hybrid system of a peptide synthetase and a methyltransferase and serves as a model system for otherN-methyl-cyclopeptide synthetases like cyclosporine synthetase (11.Lawen A. Zocher R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11355-11360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and for the peptide synthetase responsible for the synthesis of PF1022 compounds. ESYN catalyzes synthesis of the enniatin molecule from its primary precursors d-HIV and a branched chain amino acid likel-valine or l-isoleucine in an ATP-dependent reaction; the methyl group in theN-methylated peptides is donated by AdoMet. As in other peptide synthetases, 4′phosphopantetheine, covalently attached to the enzyme, acts as a prosthetic group in acylation reactions. Analysis of the ESYN gene (esyn1) of Fusarium scirpirevealed an open reading frame of 9393 base pairs encoding a 347-kDa polypeptide, which contains two highly conserved peptide synthetase domains, EA and EB (9.Haese A. Schubert M. Herrmann M. Zocher R. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 905-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The EA domain of the protein N-terminal region was identified as the d-HIV binding site. The EB domain of the C-terminal region was identified as the l-amino acid binding site. The EB domain is interrupted by a 434-amino acid insertion responsible for the N-methyltransferase function. An analogous insertion is found in cyclosporine synthetase (9.Haese A. Schubert M. Herrmann M. Zocher R. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 905-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 12.Weber G. Schörgendorfer K. Schneider-Scherzer E. Leitner E. Curr. Genet. 1994; 26: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Both domains (EA and EB) carry a phosphopantetheine prosthetic group. C-terminal to domain EB is a third phosphopantetheine that acts as a waiting position for biosynthetic intermediates, similar to fatty acid synthase. Enniatin synthesis is an iterative process in which the depsipeptide chain is formed by successive condensations of dipeptidol building blocks (10.Zocher R. Keller U. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1997; 38: 85-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No information on the biosynthesis of cyclooctadepsipeptides like PF1022A and bassianolide has been available so far, whereas the biosynthesis of enniatins is well established (8.Zocher R. Keller U. Kleinkauf H. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 28-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 9.Haese A. Schubert M. Herrmann M. Zocher R. Mol.

Here we report the cell-free synthesis of PF1022A and related cyclooctadepsipeptides and the purification and characterization of the responsible N-methyl-cyclooctadepsipeptide synthetase PFSYN. l-[14C]Methionine (60 mCi/mmol), l-[14C]leucine (89 mCi/mmol),d-[14C]lactate (60 mCi/mmol), and S-adenosyl-l-[14C-methyl]methionine (60 mCi/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. PF1022A, -B, -C, -D, and -F (a new PF1022 derivative extracted from mycelium ofM. sterilia) and diketomorpholino derivatives were generously donated by Meiji Kaisha Seika Ltd. (Kayama, Japan). All other chemicals were of the highest purity commercially available. M. sterilia PF1022, donated by Meiji Seika Kaisha Ltd., was maintained on agar slants (1.95% potato dextrose). Pieces from agar slants were transferred into 250-ml baffled flasks and glass beads containing 50 ml of preculture medium (3% glucose, 1% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 1% malt extract, 0.05% KH2PO4, pH 7). After cultivation for 72 h at 26 °C on a rotary shaker (200 rpm), the mycelium was used as an inoculum for the main culture. A 5-ml aliquot of the preculture was transferred into 500-ml baffled flasks containing 100 ml of production medium (1% Pharmamedia, 2% wheat germ, 0.2% MgSO4·7H2O, 0.2% NaCl, 0.3% CaCO3, pH 7). After incubation for 90 h at 26 °C on a rotary shaker (200 rpm), the mycelium reached its maximum capacity for PF1022A formation, measured by the in vivo incorporation of [14C]l-methionine carried out as described by Zocher et al. (13.Zocher R. Keller U. Kleinkauf H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 110: 292-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by suction filtration on a Büchner funnel, washed three times with 0.1m KCl solution, and stored at −80 °C. Amino or hydroxy acid-dependent ATP/PPi exchange was carried out as described by Lee and Lipmann (15.Lee S. Lipmann F. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 53: 585-602Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Covalently bound substrates were measured according to Gevers et al. (16.Gevers W. Kleinkauf H. Lipmann F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 63: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). One picokatal of purified PFSYN was incubated in the presence of 5 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 μCi of [14C]l-leucine, S-adenosyl-l-[14C-methyl]methionine, or [14C]d-lactate in a final volume of 100 μl. To show the ATP-dependent covalent binding of the substrates, the control was incubated without ATP. The reaction was stopped after 1 h by addition of 1 ml of 7% trichloroacetic acid. The reaction mixture was centrifuged for 3 min at 3000 rpm. The protein precipitate was then washed twice with 1 ml of ethanol and dried at 60 °C for 1 h. The covalently bound substrates were released from PFSYN by treatment with 100 μl of performic acid (control with formic acid). Identification of the products was performed by TLC in the solvent system butanol/acetate/water (4:1:1). All operations were carried out at 4 °C. Lyophilized cells of M. sterilia PF 1022 (2 g) were homogenized in a mortar and extracted with buffer A (50 mmTris-HCl, 0.3 m KCl, 60% glycerol, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μm leupeptin, pH 8) by gentle stirring for 1 h. The extract was centrifuged for 20 min at 15,000 rpm using a SS34 rotor in a Sorvall centrifuge. A solution of polyethylenimine (13%, pH 7) was added to the supernatant to give a final concentration of 0.15% and kept on ice for 10 min. The extract was centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 rpm. The supernatant was brought to a final ammonium sulfate saturation of 30% by adding saturated ammonium sulfate solution and was immediately applied to a butyl-agarose column (10 × 2.5 cm). After washing the column, fractions were collected from a linear (30–0%) ammonium sulfate gradient in buffer B (50 mmTris-HCl, 20% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, pH 8). Fractions catalyzingd-phenyllactate-dependent ATP/PPiexchange were pooled and dialyzed against buffer B overnight. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was done according to the method of Laemmli (17.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue or silver-stained using the procedure described by Blum et al. (18.Blum H. Beiger H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3736) Google Scholar). The apparent molecular weight of PFSYN was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 3% acrylamide gels according to the method of Quandt et al. (19.Quandt N. Stindl A. Keller U. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Cyclosporine synthetase (1700 kDa), actinomycin synthetase III (480 kDa), ESYN (350 kDa), and actinomycin synthetase II (280 kDa) were used as standard proteins. The molecular weight of native PFSYN was estimated by gel filtration chromatography on Ultrogel AcA 22 (Biosepra) using 0.1 m phosphate buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 4 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7). The column was calibrated with alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), thyroglobulin (669 kDa), and cyclosporine synthetase (1700 kDa). V 0 was determined using blue dextran (2000 kDa). Protein concentrations were determined by a modified Bradford procedure (20.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 12: 248-254Crossref Scopus (214455) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Purified PFSYN was subjected to 5% SDS-PAGE. The protein was electrotransferred to nitrocellulose in a semidry blotting procedure (Biometra). After the transfer, immunoblot analysis was done using rabbit anti-ESYN polyclonal antibodies according to Haese et al. (9.Haese A. Schubert M. Herrmann M. Zocher R. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 905-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Purified PFSYN was hydrolyzed with 1 n NaOH for 2 h at 80 °C and incubated after adjusting the pH to 8 with or without (control) 15 units of bovine alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) overnight at 37 °C. Pantetheine liberated from enzyme-bound 4′-phosphopantetheine was verified microbiologically using pantothenic acid auxotrophLactobacillus plantarum DSM 20205 as the test organism as described previously (8.Zocher R. Keller U. Kleinkauf H. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 28-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). For in vitrosynthesis of PF1022A, enzyme fractions were incubated in the presence of 5 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 8 mmd-lactate, 2 mmd-phenyllactate, 5 mml-leucine, and 0.05 mm [14C]methyl-AdoMet in a total volume of 100 μl for 1 h at 26 °C. After addition of 2 ml of water, the mixture was extracted with 2 ml of ethyl acetate. The organic phase was evaporated, and the residue was subjected to TLC. Autoradiography was performed with Konica medical A2 x-ray film. For synthesis of other cyclooctadepsipeptides, the ratio ofd-lactate/d-phenyllactate in the assay was changed (see Fig. 4). For kinetic measurements, [14C]methyl-AdoMet served as the radiolabel in thein vitro assay. For determination of initial rates of PF1022F formation, 1 pkat of PFSYN was incubated in the presence of 5 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mml-leucine, and varying concentrations ofd-lactate in a final volume of 100 μl. For determination of initial rates of PF1022B formation, 1 pkat of PFSYN was incubated in the presence of 5 mm ATP, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mml-leucine, and varying concentrations of d-phenyllactate in a final volume of 100 μl. Each concentration ranging from 0.1 to 10 mm was tested in triplicate. After incubation for 30 min at 26 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 ml of water, and the product was extracted with 2 ml of ethyl acetate. Quantitative measurements of the radioactive product in the organic phase were done with a Wallac 1409 liquid scintillation counter using Lumasafe Plus (Lumac-Lsc B.V., Groningen, Netherlands) scintillation liquid. The K mvalues for d-lactate and d-phenyllactate were calculated from nonlinear regression analysis of the kinetic data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the SigmaPlot program (SPSS Science Software). The calculation of k cat was based on a molecular mass of 350 kDa. The K m value for l-leucine was determined from the formation of PF1022B and PF1022F, respectively, with varying concentrations of l-leucine ranging from 1 to 100 μm and excess of the other substrates as described above. For HPLC/MS, a HP 1100 series HPLC system from Hewlett Packard (Waldbron, Germany) with vacuum-degasser, pump, autosampler, column thermostat, and photodiode array detector coupled to a Quattro LC tandem mass spectrometer from Micromass (Manchester, United Kingdom) was used. Both systems were controlled by MassLynx 3.1 Build 004 software. After incubation of 10 pkat of purified PFSYN with 5 mmATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 8 mmd-lactate, 2 mmd-phenyllactate, 5 mml-leucine, and 2 mm AdoMet at 26 °C for 2 h, the products were extracted with 2 ml of ethyl acetate. The organic phase was evaporated, and the residue was dissolved in 200 μl of 5% acetonitrile/water. Sample volumes of 50 μl were injected. Separation of products was performed on a Nova-Pak® column (C18, 4 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm) (Waters, Milford, MA). The following step gradient was used: 0 min/5% acetonitrile, 10 min/5% acetonitrile, 15 min/50% acetonitrile, 25 min/50% acetonitrile, 30 min/80% acetonitrile, 40 min/80% acetonitrile, 45 min/100% acetonitrile, 60 min/100% acetonitrile (flow rate 1 ml/min). The LC effluent was split by means of an adjustable flow splitter (Upchurch; GAT, Bremerhaven, Germany) in the ratio 1:4, with 0.2 ml/min directed to the mass spectrometer and 0.8 ml/min to the diode array detector. The mass spectrometer was operated in the electrospray mode with positive ionization. Identification of the products was done by retention time, UV spectra, and the protonated and sodiated quasimolecular ions in the mass spectra. Products were separated on silica gel plates (Merck, Darmstadt) with ethyl acetate/chloroform (1:2) as the solvent system. After TLC separation, radioactive products were extracted from the silica gel plates with ethanol and applied to HPLC. A step gradient was used as described above. Identification of the products was done by co-chromatography with DKM and CODP references. These references were synthesized by Meiji Seika Kaisha Ltd. Structural documentation was done by NMR and MS analysis. 2K. Iiuma, personal communication. RadioactiveN-[14C]methyl-l-leucine and [14C]l-leucine were separated on silica gel plates in butanol/acetic acid/water (4:1:1). PFSYN from M. sterilia was purified in two steps (Table I). The presence of 60% glycerol was essential for the isolation of active enzyme preparations. In the butyl-agarose step, the bulk of the protein was found to be in the run-through fraction. PFSYN could be eluted with a decreasing gradient of ammonium sulfate (30–0%) at about 15% saturation. PFSYN activity was monitored by measuring thed-phenyllactate-dependent ATP/PPiexchange. After the butyl-agarose step, the PFSYN peak fraction reached about 95% homogeneity, as judged by SDS-gel electrophoresis (Fig.2). The purified enzyme could be preserved for several months by storage at −80 °C in the presence of 20% glycerol without significant loss of activity.Table IPurification of PFSYN from M. steriliaTotal amount of proteinActivityaOne picokatal is the amount of enzyme catalyzing the formation of 1 pmol of PF1022A/s.Specific activityPurificationmgpkatpkat/mg-foldCrude extract14010.0071Polyethyleneimine precipitation1281.20.011.4Hydrophobic chromatography0.52.55228Two grams of lyophilized cells per extraction were used.a One picokatal is the amount of enzyme catalyzing the formation of 1 pmol of PF1022A/s. Open table in a new tab Two grams of lyophilized cells per extraction were used. The molecular mass of the denatured enzyme determined by SDS-PAGE was found to be 350 kDa. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the enzyme comigrated with ESYN. The molecular mass of the native enzyme determined by gel filtration chromatography was found to be 1400–1600 kDa, suggesting an oligomeric structure. PFSYN showed strong cross-reaction with polyclonal antibodies directed against ESYN in a Western blot analysis. No other protein in the crude extract of M. sterilia gave a response. Peptide synthetase domains contain 4′-phosphopantetheine as a prosthetic group for thioacylation of the substrates (10.Zocher R. Keller U. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1997; 38: 85-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm the assumption that 4′-phosphopantetheine is also present in PFSYN as a prosthetic group, we performed a microbiological assay with L. plantarum as a test organism (8.Zocher R. Keller U. Kleinkauf H. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 28-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The growth of this organism is strictly dependent on the presence of pantetheine or pantothenate and therefore was used for determining if 4′-phosphopantetheine is present in the enzyme. Purified PFSYN from the butyl-agarose step was used to detect the presence of enzyme-bound 4′-phosphopantetheine. After alkaline hydrolysis and subsequent alkaline phosphatase treatment, bacterial growth could be stimulated. Without phosphatase treatment, the growth rate of the test organism was strongly reduced due to the limited uptake of phosphopantetheine (results not shown). From these results we suggest that 4′-phosphopantetheine was released from the enzyme. We were able to establish the cell-free synthesis of PF1022A and related compounds when the enzyme was incubated with d-lactate, d-phenyllactate,l-leucine, AdoMet, ATP, and MgCl2. Product formation is dependent on the presence of ATP as shown in Fig.3 (lanes 1 and2). In these experiments [14C-methyl]AdoMet was used. The same product pattern was observed when [14C]Leu (and unlabeled AdoMet) was used (data not shown). Besides PF1022A, the synthesis yielded some additional cyclooctadepsipeptides of the PF1022 type, as detected by TLC analysis using authentic PF1022-related compounds as standards. Using different molar ratios of d-phenyllactate/d-lactate, the product formation in vitro could be shifted from PF1022A to PF1022B (four d-phenyllactate residues) (Fig.4). Thus, PFSYN is responsible for the synthesis of all known natural occurring cyclooctadepsipeptides inM. sterilia. N-Methylation is necessary for product formation, as shown in Fig. 3 (lane 3). As can be seen, in the absence of the methyl donor, no product formation occurs. This behavior is obviously different from ESYN, where the formation of unmethylated enniatins takes place in the absence of AdoMet (8.Zocher R. Keller U. Kleinkauf H. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 28-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Like other peptide and depsipeptide synthetases, PFSYN activates its substrates as thioesters via adenylation. The first activation step (acyl adenylation) can be followed by monitoring the ATP/[32P]pyrophosphate exchange reaction, which is a specific indicator for adenylation reactions (21.Eigner E.A. Loftfield R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 29: 601-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). When the enzyme was incubated with the appropriate substrates (l-Leu, d-Lac, d-Phelac) in the presence of ATP and [32P]pyrophosphate, the formation of radioactive ATP could be monitored. All primary precursors of PF1022A were found to be activated as adenylates. The second activation step (ATP-dependent thioacylation) could be demonstrated using the method of Gevers et al. (16.Gevers W. Kleinkauf H. Lipmann F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 63: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This is shown in Fig. 5. Bound substrates could be released by oxidation with performic acid. When the enzyme was charged with [14C]leucine in the presence of the methyl donor AdoMet, N-methyl-leucine was found after oxidation (see Fig. 5, lanes 4 and 7). From the fact that formic acid did not release radioactive products, we conclude that the substrates are indeed bound as thioesters. The band at the origin in Fig. 5 (lanes 7 and8) is most probably labeled protein that was not oxidized by performic acid treatment and does not migrate in TLC. M. sterilia produces high levels of PF1022A as well as low levels of PF1022B, -C, and -D. Because PFSYN is able to synthesize all naturally occurring cyclooctadepsipeptides in vitro, the question arose as to whether product formation depends mainly on the substrate specificity of the enzyme (concerning the hydroxy acid binding site) or on the substrate pool in the fungal cell. Therefore, K m values of d-lactate andd-phenyllactate were determined from initial rates of PF1022F formation (contains only d-lactate as the hydroxy acid constituent) and PF1022B formation (contains onlyd-phenyllactate as the hydroxy acid constituent), respectively. K m values for these substrates were found to lie in the micromolar range (0.77 ± 0.15 μm for d-lactate, 0.45 ± 0.12 μm for d-phenyllactate), indicating a high affinity of the enzyme for both hydroxy acids compared withl-leucine (K m = 20 ± 3 μm). k cat/K mvalues showed the same order of magnitude (k cat/K m ford-lactate is 0.0022 s−1μm−1,k cat/K m ford-phenyllactate is 0.0037 s−1μm−1), indicating that there is no distinct preference for one substrate. These results suggest that the formation of different PF-related compounds is mainly controlled by the molar ratio of the hydroxy acids and not by the specificity of the hydroxy acid binding site of the synthetase. This might be due to the elongation and reactions on the enzyme (see “Discussion”), which are probably limited by the different hydrophobic residues of the incorporated substrates d-Lac and d-Phelac. Thus, a strong excess of d-Lac compared withd-Phelac in the reaction mixture of the cell-free synthesis is necessary for the formation of PF1022-related compounds containingd-Lac as can be seen in Fig. 4. Interestingly, several homologous hydroxy acids like d-2-hydroxyisocaproate,d-2-hydroxyvalerate, d-2-hydroxybutyrate,d-2-hydroxycaproate,d-2-hydroxy-3-methyl-valerate, and p-nitro- andp-amino-d-phenyllactate could be incorporated into new products, indicating a rather low specificity of the hydroxy acid binding site (22.Weckwerth W.

(September 23, 1998) International Patent WO9720945Google Scholar). A product of the reaction mixture from the in vitro synthesis could be identified as a diketomorpholine derivative whose formation depends either on the hydroxy acids d-phenyllactate ord-lactate, the amino acid l-leucine and the methyl donor AdoMet. This is shown in Fig.6, where [14C]methyl-AdoMet was used as a radiolabel. In the absence of d-hydroxy acids, no product formation was observed (Fig. 6 A,lane 4). Acid hydrolysis of this radioactive product yielded radioactive N-methyl-l-leucine (Fig. 6 B). HPLC analysis showed a similar retention time with the authentic DKMs c(d-LacNMeLeu) and c(d-Phelac NMeLeu) (see Fig.7). The in vitro formation ofN-methylated cyclodipeptidols and diketopiperazines is well known from enniatin synthetase (13.Zocher R. Keller U. Kleinkauf H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 110: 292-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and cyclosporine synthetase, respectively (24.Zocher R. Nihira T. Paul E. Madry Peeters H. Kleinkauf H. Keller U.

When a molar ratio of 10:1 (10 mm/1 mm)d-lactate/d-phenyllactate in the in vitro reaction mixture was chosen, the formation of all natural cyclooctadepsipeptides, PF1022A, -B, -C, and -D, could be observed (Fig. 8). Interestingly, a hitherto postulated and chemically synthesized (26.Ohyama, M., Ohishi, M., Okada, Y., Koyama, M., Sumi, S., Murai, Y., Takagi, M., Okada, T., Sakanaka, O., Yoneta, T., Iinuma, K.,and Shibahara, S. (September 1, 1994) International Patent WO9419334Google Scholar) cyclooctadepsipeptide called PF1022F consisting of d-lactate andN-methyl-l-leucine was found in the in vitro reaction mixture (see Fig. 7). Besides the known PF1022A type structures, we could also detect two new cyclotetradepsipeptides and a new cyclohexadepsipeptide in the in vitro reaction mixture by HPLC/MS analysis (see Fig. 7). Thus, PFSYN is capable of synthesizing not only cyclooctadepsipeptides but also di-, tetra- and hexadepsipeptides.Table IICyclodepsipeptides found by HPLC/MS in the in vitro synthesis catalyzed by PFSYNCyclodepsipeptidesaCyclic structures are based on their calculated and observed molecular mass, as well as on their behavior in HPLC.Molecular formulaMass peakIntensities relative to PF1022AbAs estimated by relative peak areas in the HPLC/MS analysis.Retention time (t R)%minTetradepsipeptide (NMeLeu2d-Lacd-Phelac)C26H38N2O6[M + H]+ 475.283332.33[M + Na]+497.077 (NMeLeu d-PhelacNMcLeud-Phelac)C32H42N2O6[M + H]+ 551.1142534.67[M + Na]+573.074Hexadepsipeptide (NMeLeu3d-Lac2d-Phelac)C36H55N3O9[M + H]+ 674.164734.15[M + Na]+696.136Octadepsipeptide (NMeLeu4d-Lac4) PF1022FC40H68N4O12[M + H]+ 797.2422233.8 Fig. 8, lane F[M + Na]+ 819.21 (NMeLeu4d-Lac3d-Phelac) PF1022DC46H72N4O12[M + H]+ 873.2659535.97 Fig. 8, lane E[M + Na]+ 895.238 (NMeLeu4d-Lac2d-Phelac2) PF1022AC52H76N4O12[M + H]+ 949.2610039.29 Fig. 8, lane D[M + Na]+ 972.227 (NMeLeu4d-Lac d-Phelac3) PF1022CC58H80N4O12[M + H]+ 1025.2521144.75 Fig. 8, lane C[M + Na]+ 1047.219 (NMeLeu4d-Phelac4) PF1022BC64H84N4O12[M + H]+ 1101.379246.29 Fig. 8, lane B[M + Na]+ NFcNot found.a Cyclic structures are based on their calculated and observed molecular mass, as well as on their behavior in HPLC.b As estimated by relative peak areas in the HPLC/MS analysis.c Not found. Open table in a new tab PFSYN was purified from crude extracts of M. sterilia PF 1022. This is the first reported purification and characterization of a N-methyl-cyclooctadepsipeptide synthetase. This multifunctional enzyme catalyzes: 1) activation of the substrates via adenylation; 2) covalent binding of the substrates via thioesters; 3)N-methylation of thioesterified leucine with AdoMet; and 4) condensation reaction, elongation, and cyclization. Interestingly, the molecular size of the purified enzyme in SDS-PAGE is identical with that of the ESYN, although the latter enzyme is responsible for the synthesis of a cyclohexadepsipeptide and therefore assembles only six residues instead of eight to form the final product enniatin. It has been previously demonstrated that peptide and depsipeptide synthetases consist of repeating 120-kDa domains responsible for the activation and condensation of the corresponding substrates to form the final peptide metabolite (for review, see Ref. 10.Zocher R. Keller U. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1997; 38: 85-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mass of 350 kDa estimated for PFSYN suggests that, like ESYN, PFSYN also comprises two peptide synthetase domains each of more than 100 kDa with an integrated methyltransferase portion of about 50 kDa (9.Haese A. Schubert M. Herrmann M. Zocher R. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 905-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 12.Weber G. Schörgendorfer K. Schneider-Scherzer E. Leitner E. Curr. Genet. 1994; 26: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Interestingly, estimation of the native molecular weight by gel filtration chromatography yielded higher values (>1 Mda) than the denatured enzyme indicating a possible oligomeric structure. Work is in progress to analyze the exact oligomeric structure of PFSYN by means of analytical ultracentrifugation. Based on the assumption that PFSYN is a two-domain enzyme like ESYN, catalyzing the biosynthesis of PF1022-related compounds via an iterative mechanism, we suggest that one domain of PFSYN activates l-leucine and is responsible for N-methylation. The other domain activatesd-lactate as well as d-phenyllactate. The low substrate specificity of the latter domain is also illustrated by the fact that the enzyme activates a wide range of differentd-2-hydroxy acids. The occurrence of different natural PF1022A-related compounds varying in the d-lactate andd-phenyllactate position appears to be the consequence of a competition of the hydroxyacids for one binding site on the enzyme leading to the formation of different dipeptidols. Elongation of the growing depsipeptide chain occurs by linking dipeptidol units either ofN-methyl-l-leucine and d-lactate or of N-methyl-l-leucine andd-phenyllactate. After four dipeptidol units have entered the process, cyclization terminates the reaction sequence of the enzyme. The elongation reaction links the different combinations of the two possible dipeptidol units consisting either ofd-lactate/N-methyl-leucine or ofd-phenyllactate/N-methyl-leucine and therefore leads to the complete natural product spectrum of M. sterilia including PF1022A, -B, -C, -D, and -F. The detection of DKM derivatives, tetra- and hexadepsipeptides, in the in vitro system provides strong evidence for this mechanism of stepwise dipeptidol condensations, whereas the odd-numbered tri-, penta-, and heptadepsipeptides were not detectable in the MS analysis of the in vitro products. We could demonstrate by in vitro studies that PF1022F, which consists of four residues ofd-lactate and four residues ofN-methyl-l-leucine, is also synthesized by PFSYN. From the six possible arrangements of d-lactate,d-phenyllactate, andN-methyl-l-leucine in the corresponding PF1022-related molecules, there should be one isomer of PF1022A in which the two d-phenyllactate residues are neighbors (Fig.1, R1= R2= CH2C6H5, R 3= R4= CH3). Because of their structural homology, the two PF1022A isomers have not been distinguished by mass spectrometry analysis. Work is in progress to detect the two isomers by MS/MS and NMR technics. DKM formation appears to be a general reaction in cyclodepsipeptide-producing fungi. Recently, a DKM derivative named lateritin was isolated from Gibberella (syn.Fusarium) lateritium (27.Hasumi K. Shinohara C. Iwanaga T. Endo A. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1993; 46: 1782-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), consisting ofd-2-hydroxyisovalerate andN-methyl-l-phenylalanine, which are the alternating constituents of the cyclohexadepsipeptide beauvericin (28.Peeters H. Zocher R. Kleinkauf H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1988; 12: 1983-1987Google Scholar). The ability to produce mixed-type structures is also known from enniatin biosynthesis (29.Pieper R. Kleinkauf H. Zocher R. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1992; 45: 1273-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, in this case variations in the amino acid moieties of the enniatin molecule occur, whereas the hydroxy acid component d-HIV is conserved. Similarly, it has been demonstrated by in vitro studies with beauvericin synthetase from B. bassiana that l-phenylalanine could be replaced by l-leucine and a variety of homologous amino acids (28.Peeters H. Zocher R. Kleinkauf H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1988; 12: 1983-1987Google Scholar). In summary, these results show that cyclodepsipeptides with repetitive dipeptidole building blocks like PF1022A-type cyclooctadepsipeptides, enniatins, and beauvericins are synthesized by two-domain enzymes in an iterative process in contrast to peptides with irregular structure,e.g. cyclosporine, which is synthesized by a peptide synthetase with 11 domains."

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, G protein-linked pheromone receptors mediate events needed for cell fusion and mating (1.Dohlman H.G. Song J. Apanovitch D.M. DiBello P.R. Gillen K.M. Semin.

Generally speaking, receptor activation triggers a conformational change in the G protein α subunit, exchange of GDP for GTP, and dissociation of Gα from the G protein βγ subunits. Gα is free to activate downstream effectors until GTP is hydrolyzed and the protein reverts to the inactive conformation. Gβγ does not undergo a conformational change and so activates its effector only until it can reassociate with Gα·GDP (2.Bohm A. Gaudet R. Sigler P.B. Curr. Opin.

For instance, arrestins bind to phosphorylated receptors and prevent further coupling to the G protein (5.Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Although phosducin-Gβγ interaction has been convincingly documented through in vitro studies, it is not clear how this activity should affect signaling in vivo. Indeed there is growing evidence that phosducin may have other functions in the cell. Phosducin and the phosducin-like protein PhLP were recently shown to bind p45 SUG1, the regulatory subunit of the 26 S proteasome (16.Zhu X. Craft C.M. Mol. Vis. 1998; 4: 13PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Barhite S. Thibault C. Miles M.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1402: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Phosducin has also been reported to bind with low affinity to Gα (14.Bauer P.H. Bluml K. Schroder S. Hegler J. Dees C. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9465-9471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), although this finding has not been reproduced (13.Yoshida T. Willardson B.M. Wilkins J.F. Jensen G.J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 25104-25112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosducin could also act as a Gβγ effector, in the manner of phospholipase Cβ and ion channels (19.Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar), or as a Gβγ adaptor protein, in the manner of arrestin.Are phosducins regulators, effectors, or do they have some other function in the cell? To test these possibilities, it would be useful to obtain a cell or organism in which phosducin expression is disrupted. S. cerevisiae is an appropriate system to carry out such a genetic analysis, because gene disruption mutations are easily obtained through homologous recombination. Indeed, yeast is the only system in which all of the known signaling components (receptor, G protein, effector) (1.Dohlman H.G. Song J. Apanovitch D.M. DiBello P.R. Gillen K.M. Semin. Cell Dev.

Now, with the completion of the yeast genome, we have identified two candidate phosducins that we named PLP1 and PLP2(phosducin-like proteins 1 and 2). Our analysis reveals that these proteins can bind and regulate Gβγ in vivo. In addition, one of the PLP isoforms has an essential role in maintaining cell viability, independent of its role in G protein signal transduction or desensitization.DISCUSSIONPhosducin was originally discovered in the retina by virtue of its association with purified transducin Gβγ (35.Lolley R.N. Brown B.M. Farber D.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 78: 572-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although phosducin is best known for its role in the visual system, it has been proposed to regulate other signaling systems as well. Phosducin (12.Bauer P.H. Muller S. Puzicha M. Pippig S.

Elliott M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10831-10835Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) shares only limited sequence similarity with phosducin but is still able to bind to Gβγ (34.Thibault C. Sganga M.W. Miles M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12253-12256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 43.Schroder S. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2100-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Two additional homologues, PhLOP1 (an N-terminally truncated form of phosducin) and PhLOP2, do not appear to bind to Gβγ at all (44.Craft C.M. Xu J. Slepak V.Z. Zhan-Poe X. Zhu X. Brown B. Lolley R.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15758-15772Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Although past studies have demonstrated that some phosducin family members can regulate G protein βγ signaling in vitro(12.Bauer P.H. Muller S. Puzicha M. Pippig S. Obermaier B. Helmreich E.J. Lohse M.J. Nature. 1992; 358: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 18.Lee R.H. Ting T.D. Lieberman B.S. Tobias D.E. Lolley R.N.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22546-22551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether they regulate G protein function in vivo. We have shown that phosducins in yeast, like phosducin and PhLP in mammals, have the ability to bind to Gβγ. As expected, overexpression of either PLP1 orPLP2 can greatly reduce pheromone-mediated gene transcription. Surprisingly, overexpression of the same genes had no effect on pheromone-mediated growth arrest. Finally, and perhaps most significantly, gene disruption mutants of PLP1 had only modest effects on signaling, whereas the PLP2 disruption was lethal.Both PLP1 and PLP2 can inhibit short term but not long term pheromone responses. To our knowledge, this type of selective regulation has not been reported previously in yeast. This is understandable, considering that most genetic screens are designed to isolate mutants affecting growth, which is simpler to assay than is transcription. This raises the exciting possibility that new genetic screens based on transcriptional induction rather than growth arrest could yield additional novel regulators of short term desensitization.Compared with Gpa1, Plp1 and Plp2 bind poorly to Ste4. In mammalian cells the binding of phosducin (and PhLP) to Gβγ is also quite weak, with published affinity constants of 17–110 nm (12.Bauer P.H. Muller S. Puzicha M. Pippig S. Obermaier B.

By comparison, flow cytometry measurements of Gβγ binding to Gα yield considerably higher affinities of 1–3 nm in the presence of GDP and >100 nm in the presence of GTPγS (47.Ueda N.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7934-7940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, similar quantitative methods are not yet available for the yeast proteins.Of the two yeast phosducins, Plp2 is most similar to other members of the family, yet Plp1 is best able to bind to βγ. An explanation may be found in the recently solved crystal structures of the retinal phosducin-Gβγ complex (49.Gaudet R. Bohm A. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1996; 87: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 50.Gaudet R. Savage J.R. McLaughlin J.N. Willardson B.M. Sigler P.B. Mol.

Structure. 1998; 6: 1007-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These studies reveal extensive contacts between the N-terminal domain of phosducin with the top of the Gβγ “propeller,” a region that also binds to Gα (52.Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain forms less extensive contacts with the side of the Gβγ propeller, a region that is believed to face the lipid bilayer (52.Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). A structurally based alignment of Plp2 with phosducin reveals several amino acid deletions and charge substitutions in helix I (residues 20–34 in phosducin), which caps the central hole formed by the Gβγ propeller. These changes could impair binding of Plp2 to Gβγ. There may also be other subtle differences that are not obvious from broad comparisons of sequence or structure. For instance, phosducin binding is reduced ∼5-fold when it is phosphorylated at Ser-73 (13.Yoshida T. Willardson B.M. Wilkins J.F. Jensen G.J. Thornton B.D. Bitensky M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24050-24057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 53.Lee R.H. Brown B.M. Lolley R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15860-15866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), even though this residue is oriented away from Gβγ (49.Gaudet R. Bohm A. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1996; 87: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) and has only modest effects on the order of the loop that contains the site of phosphorylation (50.Gaudet R. Savage J.R. McLaughlin J.N. Willardson B.M. Sigler P.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Apparently, even small differences in phosducin structure, at sites removed from the binding interface, can have significant effects on phosducin function. The structural and functional differences between Plp1 and Plp2 could be just as subtle.Our finding that PLP2 is an essential gene was unexpected. If the only role of phosducin is to desensitize Gβγ signaling, a gene disruption should be viable. One explanation is that phosducin homologues have different functions in different organisms. We think this is highly unlikely, given the well documented structural and functional similarities between yeast and mammalian signaling components. A second possibility is that phosducins do not ordinarily modulate G protein signaling. Although they clearly have thecapacity to sequester Gβγ and perturb signaling, this may not be their principal function in vivo. Some GRKs bind Gβγ to facilitate membrane localization as well as phosphorylation and desensitization of receptors (5.Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 19.Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 40.Boekhoff I. Touhara K. Danner S. Inglese J. Lohse M.J. Breer H. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1264-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Although GRKs also have the capacity to sequester Gβγ and perturb their function (55.Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6193-6197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is not, however, considered to be their main function in the cell. A third scenario (which we favor) is that phosducin can regulate signaling but only in the visual system. Phosducin is expressed at much higher concentrations in the retina (∼380 μm) than in other tissues (<1 μm), and the retina is the only tissue in which there is sufficient phosducin to bind more than about 10% of the available Gβγ (36.Danner S. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10145-10150Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar,56.Wilkins J.F. Bitensky M.W. Willardson B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19232-19237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).If phosducins do not act primarily as regulators of G protein function, what do they do? One possibility is that they act as chaperones, delivering Gβγ (and most likely other proteins) to or from the plasma membrane. A chaperone function would likely require that hydrophobic regions of Gβγ be masked so that it can be transported through the cytosol. In fact, phosducin normally resides within the cytoplasm of rod and cone photoreceptors, whether or not it is bound to Gβγ (10.Lee R.H. Whelan J.P. Lolley R.N. McGinnis J.F. Exp. Eye Res. 1988; 46: 829-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 35.Lolley R.N. Brown B.M. Farber D.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Commun. 1996; 223: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Moreover, binding of phosducin to Gβγ promotes its dissociation from the membrane (60.Tanaka H. Kuo C.H. Matsuda T. Fukada Y. Hayashi F. Ding Y. Irie Y. Miki N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). InCryphonectria parasitica, disruption of a phosducin-like protein produces a phenocopy of Gβ null mutants, suggesting a role in facilitating G protein function (61.Kasahara S. Wang P. Nuss D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). There is also evidence from two-hybrid screens that phosducin and PhLP bind to the mammalian 26 S proteasome regulatory subunit, p45 SUG1 (16.Zhu X. Craft C.M. Mol. Vis. 1998; 4: 13PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Barhite S. Thibault C. Miles M.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1402: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Perhaps phosducin helps to deliver Gβγ and other proteins to the proteasome.Many investigators have equated phosducin with Gβγ binding. This view may be too limited. Indeed, our analysis reveals an essential (and βγ-independent) function for at least one phosducin homologue in yeast. These findings support an emerging model in which phosducin family members have functions other than to simply regulate G proteins. It remains to be determined if these proteins modulate some other aspect of G protein function, such as subunit assembly, stability, or subcellular localization. Our gene disruption mutants represent an essential first step to addressing these questions. Currently, we are attempting to identify downstream targets of Plp1 and Plp2, through genetic suppression, synthetic interaction, and two-hybrid interaction studies in yeast. Given the extensive similarity between yeast and human signaling pathways, these studies should help determine thein vivo function of phosducins in other organisms as well. G protein-coupled receptors are a large and diverse family of signaling proteins that can respond to chemosensory signals (hormones, neurotransmitters, odors) and light. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, G protein-linked pheromone receptors mediate events needed for cell fusion and mating (1.Dohlman H.G. Song J. Apanovitch D.M. DiBello P.R. Gillen K.M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Generally speaking, receptor activation triggers a conformational change in the G protein α subunit, exchange of GDP for GTP, and dissociation of Gα from the G protein βγ subunits. Gα is free to activate downstream effectors until GTP is hydrolyzed and the protein reverts to the inactive conformation. Gβγ does not undergo a conformational change and so activates its effector only until it can reassociate with Gα·GDP (2.Bohm A. Gaudet R. Sigler P.B. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 480-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 3.Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). G protein signaling can be modulated at various steps throughout the pathway. Receptors become desensitized following phosphorylation by second messenger-dependent and activation-dependent protein kinases (G protein-coupled receptor kinases ( GRKs)1) (4.Premont R.T. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 5.Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). In some cases, accessory proteins contribute to receptor desensitization. For instance, arrestins bind to phosphorylated receptors and prevent further coupling to the G protein (5.Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Arrestins also bind to clathrin and promote receptor endocytosis (6.Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar, 7.Ferguson S.S. Downey 3rd, W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). More recently, it has become evident that G proteins are also subject to desensitization. Members of the RGS (regulators of G protein signaling) family accelerate G protein GTP hydrolysis, thereby shortening the lifetime of the active species and dampening the signal (8.Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3871-3874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 9.Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

Although phosducin-Gβγ interaction has been convincingly documented through in vitro studies, it is not clear how this activity should affect signaling in vivo. Indeed there is growing evidence that phosducin may have other functions in the cell. Phosducin and the phosducin-like protein PhLP were recently shown to bind p45 SUG1, the regulatory subunit of the 26 S proteasome (16.Zhu X. Craft C.M. Mol.

We evaluated this hypothesis by replacing the large N-terminal extracellular domain of the human type 1 PTH receptor (hP1Rc-WT) with residues 1–9 of PTH (AVSEIQLMH) using a tetraglycine linker between His-9 of the ligand and Glu-182 of the receptor near the extracellular terminus of transmembrane domain-1. Expression of this construct, hP1Rc-Tether(1–9), in COS-7 cells resulted in basal cAMP levels that were 10-fold higher than those seen in control cells transfected with hP1Rc-WT. Extending the ligand sequence to include Asn-10 and the activity-enhancing substitution of Leu-11 → Arg yielded hP1Rc-[Arg11]Tether(1–11), for which we observed basal cAMP levels that were 50-fold higher than those seen with P1Rc-WT. An alanine-scan analysis of hP1Rc-[Arg11]Tether(1–11) revealed that Gln-6 and His-9 were not critical for autoactivation, whereas Val-2, Ile-5, and Met-8 were. The data show that tethered PTH/PTH receptors can autoactivate. Analysis of the structure-activity relationships in these tethered receptor constructs can provide new information concerning how the N-terminal residues of PTH interact with the extracellular loops and transmembrane regions of the PTH-1 receptor, particularly in regard to receptor activation.

Abou-Samra A Bringhurst F. Gardella T. Jüppner H. Segre G. Thakker R. Genetics of Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders. Chapman & Hall, London1997: 389-420Google Scholar). The PTH-1 receptor also mediates the actions of PTH-related peptide, a large (∼140 amino acids) polypeptide ligand that plays a critical role in the developmental of several organs, particularly the skeleton (1.Kronenberg H. Abou-Samra A Bringhurst F. Gardella T. Jüppner H. Segre G. Thakker R. Genetics of Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders. Chapman & Hall, London1997: 389-420Google Scholar). PTH has potent anabolic effects on bone in humans (2.Roe E. Sanchez S. del Puerto G. Pierini E. Bacchetti P. Cann C. Arnaud C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14 Suppl. 1: 137Google Scholar) and, thus, is a potential therapy for metabolic bone diseases, such as osteoporosis (3.Dempster D.W. Cosman F. Parisien M. Shen V. Lindsay R. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14 (Correction (1994) Endocr. Rev. 15, 261): 690-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Structure-activity analyses of PTH have shown that the 1–34 fragment is sufficient for full biological activity (4.Tregear G.W. Van Rietschoten J. Greene E. Keutmann H.T. Niall H.D. Reit B. Parsons J.A. Potts Jr., J.T. Endocrinology. 1973; 93: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Within the PTH(1–34) peptide, the N-terminal residues are the most critical for receptor activation, whereas the C-terminal residues are more important for determining receptor binding affinity (4.Tregear G.W.

Recent receptor mutagenesis and photochemical cross-linking approaches suggest that residues within the C-terminal 15–34 region of PTH(1–34) interact with the relatively large (∼170 amino acid) N-terminal extracellular domain of the PTH-1 receptor and that the N-terminal residues of PTH interact with the 7 transmembrane domains and extracellular loops of the receptor (6.Bergwitz C.

In further support of the latter component of this hypothesis, we recently showed that a peptide as small as PTH(1–14) could stimulate cAMP formation, albeit weakly, with both the wild type PTH receptor and a truncated PTH receptor (P1Rc-delNt) that lacked most of the N-terminal domain (11.Luck M. Carter P. Gardella T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 670-680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The potency of PTH(1–34) was severely diminished with P1Rc-delNt, as compared with its potency with the wild type receptor (EC50values = ∼500 nm and ∼2 nm, respectively). In contrast, the potency of PTH(1–14) was equivalent with both the intact receptor and with P1Rc-delNt (EC50values = ∼200 μm). An alanine-scanning analysis performed on PTH(1–14) revealed that residues (1.Kronenberg H. Abou-Samra A Bringhurst F. Gardella T. Jüppner H. Segre G. Thakker R.

Carter P. Gardella T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 670-680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the above results, we considered the possibility that the first nine residues of PTH could be sufficient for receptor activation if they were constrained to within the region of the receptor containing the seven transmembrane domains and extracellular loops. As described herein, we show that this can be accomplished by tethering the N-terminal residues of PTH directly to a truncated receptor lacking the N-terminal extracellular domain. The resulting tethered ligand/receptor constructs are active and exhibit a similar, yet not identical, mutational profile to that seen previously with exogenous PTH(1–14) and PTH(1–34) peptide ligands. This system provides a new approach for analyzing how the N-terminal residues of PTH contribute to interactions with the PTH-1 receptor. The peptides PTH(1–14) (rPTH(1–14)NH2), rPTH(1–34) ([Nle8,21,Tyr34]rPTH(1–34)NH2), and Q-PTH(1–34) ([Ala1,3,10,12,Arg11,Tyr34]hPTH(1–34)NH2) were prepared by the M. G. H. Biopolymer Synthesis Facility, Boston, MA, as described previously. 2Shimizu, M., Potts, J. J., and Gardella, T. (2000) J. Biol. Chem., in press. The Q-PTH(1–34) analog contains a quartet (Q) of substitutions (Ser3 → Ala, Asn10 → Ala, Leu11 → Arg, and Gly12 → Ala) that strongly enhances potency on PTH-1 receptors lacking the N-terminal extracellular domain.2 This peptide is, thus, well suited for assessing the agonist responsiveness of the truncated receptors used in this study. The pCDNA-1-based plasmid encoding the intact hPTH-1 receptor (13.Schipani E. Karga H. Karaplis A.C. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Segre G.V. Abou-Samra A.B. Jüppner H. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2157-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) (hP1Rc-WT) was used as a starting plasmid for mutagenesis. The truncated human PTH-1 receptor (hP1R-delNt) is deleted for residues 24 to 181 and was constructed from hP1Rc-WT by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (14.Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4879) Google Scholar). Signal peptidase cleavage of this receptor is predicted to occur between Ala-22 and Tyr-23 (15.Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4911) Google Scholar) and, thus, leave Tyr-23 as the N-terminal residue followed directly in sequence by Glu-182 located near the extracellular boundary of the first transmembrane helix. A similarly truncated rat PTH receptor containing a nine-amino acid N-terminal extracellular epitope tag described by us previously was expressed on the surface of COS-7 cells at 60% of the level of the intact wild-type receptor (11.Luck M. Carter P. Gardella T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 670-680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Carter P.H. Shimizu M. Luck M.D. Gardella T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31955-31960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The tethered human PTH-1 receptor, hP1Rc-Tether(1–9), was made from hP1R-delNt by a single oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis step that inserted a 13-amino acid sequence (AVSEIQLMHGGGG) corresponding to PTH(1–9) joined C-terminally to a tetraglycine spacer between the Tyr-23/Glu-182 peptide bond. The predicted signal peptidase cleavage of this receptor between Ala-22 and Tyr-23 (15.Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4911) Google Scholar) generates the N-terminal tyrosine followed directly by Ala-1 of the ligand sequence (see Fig. 1). The receptors hP1Rc-Tether(1–10), hP1Rc-Tether(1–11), and hP1Rc-[Arg11]Tether(1–11) were made from hP1Rc-Tether(1–9) by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. Transient transfections of COS-7 cells were performed using DEAE-dextran and cesium chloride-purified plasmid DNA, as described previously (16.Carter P.H. Shimizu M. Luck M.D. Gardella T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31955-31960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All transfections utilized 200 ng of DNA/well of a 24-well plate, except for the experiments shown in Fig. 5, which utilized the amounts of DNA indicated in the graph.Figure 5DNA dependence of cAMP signaling by tethered and H223R constitutively active PTH-1 receptors. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated dose of plasmid DNA encoding either hP1Rc-WT (▪), hP1Rc-[Arg11]Tether(1–11) (●), or hP1Rc-H223R (○), a constitutively active PTH-1 receptor containing a point mutation in transmembrane domain 2. Cells were assayed for intracellular cAMP accumulation after treatment for 60 min at room temperature with IBMX buffer alone (A) or IBMX buffer containing Q-PTH(1–34) ([Ala1,3,10,12Arg11,Tyr34]hPTH(1–34)amide) at a concentration of 1 μm (B).

Carter P. Gardella T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 670-680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were rinsed with 0.5 ml of binding buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 5% heat-inactivated horse serum, 0.5% fetal bovine serum, adjusted to pH 7.7 with HCl) and treated with 200 μl of IBMX buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 35 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4) and 100 μl of binding buffer (basal) or binding buffer containing varying amounts of a PTH peptide analog (total volume = 300 μl). The cells were then incubated at room temperature for 1 h (or less for the time course experiment of Fig. 4), and the IBMX-containing buffer was removed. The cells were immediately frozen on crushed dry ice, and then 0.5 ml of 50 mm HCl was added, and the cells were refrozen on dry ice. The cAMP content of the thawed and diluted lysate was determined by radioimmunoassay. Calculations were performed using Microsoft Excel. For some experiments, a four-parameter nonlinear regression equation was used to fit curves to the cAMP dose-response data and to obtain the corresponding EC50 values (16.Carter P.H. Shimizu M. Luck M.D. Gardella T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31955-31960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The statistical significance between two data sets was determined using a one-tailed Student's t test assuming unequal variances for the two sets. To construct PTH receptors having the PTH ligand sequence covalently “tethered” to the body of the receptor, we utilized as a starting scaffold a human PTH-1 receptor analog that is deleted for most of the extracellular N-terminal domain, hP1Rc-delNt (11.Luck M. Carter P. Gardella T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 670-680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This deletion mutant receptor retains the native signal sequence, as do each of the subsequent tethered receptor constructs, such that signal peptidase cleavage between the Ala-22 and Tyr-23 peptide bond is predicted to generate the mature receptor mutant with an N-terminal tyrosine residue (15.Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4911) Google Scholar). In hP1Rc-delNt, this tyrosine is joined directly to glutamate 182; in the tethered receptors, the PTH segment, linked C-terminally to a tetraglycine linker, is inserted between the N-terminal tryrosine and glutamate 182 (Fig.1). The N-terminal tyrosine was not expected to be a major detriment to the potential signaling activity induced by the tethered PTH segment because [Tyr−1]rPTH(1–14)NH2 was 50% as active as native PTH(1–14) in stimulating a cAMP response in cells expressing the P1Rc. 3T. Gardella and P. H. Carter, unpublished observations. The basal and ligand-stimulated signaling properties of the tethered PTH-1 receptors in transiently transfected COS-7 cells are shown in Fig. 2. In the absence of added agonist, cells expressing hP1R-Tether(1–9) exhibited basal cAMP levels that were 10-fold higher than those observed with hP1Rc-WT or hP1Rc-delNt (Fig. 2 A). Extension of the ligand chain by one or two residues yielded hP1Rc-Tether(1–10) and hP1Rc-Tether(1–11), which produced moderate, but statistically significant (p < 0.005), improvements in the levels of basal cAMP signaling relative to hP1Rc-Tether(1–9). Basal cAMP signaling was increased substantially by the replacement of the native leucine at position 11 of hP1R-Tether(1–11) with arginine; we recently found that this same substitution enhances cAMP potency in short N-terminal PTH(1–14) analog peptides.2 Each of the tethered hP1Rc constructs responded to a 1 μm dose of exogenous PTH(1–34) analog to a similar extent (Fig. 2 B). To further evaluate the ability of these tethered receptors to respond to exogenous ligands, we performed dose-response analyses using rPTH(1–34), the Q-PTH(1–34) analog,2 and the N-terminal PTH(1–14) fragment (11.Luck M. Carter P. Gardella T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 670-680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The receptor hP1Rc-Tether(1–9) exhibited agonist responses to these ligands that were much the same as those seen with hP1Rc-delNT (Fig. 3,B and C). With hP1Rc-[Arg11]Tether(1–11), only a weak stimulation of cAMP accumulation could be discerned with the full-length peptides, and no increase in cAMP accumulation above the already high basal level was detected for the shorter PTH(1–14) peptide (Fig. 3 D). The rate of cAMP accumulation induced by hP1Rc-[Arg11]Tether(1–11) was examined in a time-course experiment conducted in transfected COS-7 cells either in the absence or presence of a 1 μm dose of Q-PTH(1–34). In the absence of agonist ligand, cAMP accumulation increased rapidly following the addition of IBMX (t = 0) in cells expressing hP1Rc-[Arg11]Tether(1–11), such that within 5 min the cAMP level (78 ± 6 pmol/well) was nearly half the maximum level attained by the 40-min time point (156 ± 5 pmol/well, Fig. 4). This basal rate of cAMP accumulation observed for hP1Rc-[Arg11]Tether(1–11) was comparable with that observed with PTH(1–34)-treated cells expressing hP1Rc-WT and contrasted strongly with the untreated hP1Rc-WT-expressing cells, for which little or no cAMP accumulation was observed. The basal and agonist-induced cAMP signaling activity of hP1Rc-[Arg11]Tether(1–11) was dependent on the amount of plasmid DNA used in the transient transfections of COS-7 cells (Fig.5). The DNA-dependence of these responses were parallel to those seen with a constitutively active PTH-1 receptor that contained the His-223 → Arg point mutation at the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane helix 2 (17.Schipani E. Kruse K. Jüppner H. Science. 1995; 268: 98-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). At each equivalent DNA dose, the basal cAMP response observed with hP1Rc-[Arg11]Tether(1–11) was approximately twice that observed for hP1Rc-H223R (range = 1.6–2.3-fold). The finding that the Leu-11 → Arg substitution substantially improved the signaling activity of both the tethered receptor construct and a synthetic PTH(1–14) peptide2 prompted us to investigate whether other similarities existed between the structure-activity profiles of free PTH peptides and the PTH portion of the tethered receptor. Thus, we performed an alanine scan analysis of the PTH residues 2–9 of hP1Rc-[Arg11]Tether(1–11), because these amino acid positions correspond to the most critical functional sites in PTH(1–14) (11.Luck M. Carter P. Gardella T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 670-680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig.6 A, position-specific effects of these alanine substitutions on the basal cAMP-signaling activity of hP1Rc-[Arg11]Tether(1–11) were observed. The alanine substitutions of glutamine 6 and histidine 9 had relatively mild effects on basal signaling. These results stand in contrast to the severe effects that alanine substitutions at positions 6 and 9 had on PTH(1–14) peptide activity (11.Luck M. Carter P. Gardella T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 670-680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alanine substitutions of glutamate 4 and leucine 7 had intermediate effects on the basal signaling of hP1Rc-[Arg11]Tether(1–11). The most severe reductions in basal activity occurred with the alanine substitutions of valine 2, isoleucine 5, and methionine 8. These strong reductions in activity paralleled the effects that substitutions at the corresponding positions in PTH(1–14) had on cAMP-signaling activity (11.Luck M. Carter P. Gardella T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 670-680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).2 Each of the alanine-substituted tethered receptors mediated a response to exogenous PTH(1–34) analog (1 μm) that was comparable with that observed with the unmodified hP1Rc-[Arg11]Tether(1–11) control receptor (Fig. 6 B). This study describes a series of novel tethered PTH ligand/PTH-1 receptor constructs in which the N-terminal residues of the PTH ligand are fused to the body of the heptahelical G protein-coupled human PTH-1 receptor. This approach was pursued as a means to potentially simplify the analysis of the interactions between PTH and its receptor. This interaction can be otherwise difficult to evaluate, given the high degrees of freedom inherent to a bimolecular system involving large diffusible proteins of uncertain three-dimensional structures. Each of the tethered receptors in our study exhibited elevated basal cAMP signaling levels, as compared with hP1Rc-WT, when transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. The highest constitutive activity occurred with hP1Rc-[Arg11]Tether(1–11), for which the basal cAMP levels were 75% of the maximum cAMP response attained by PTH(1–34)-treated hP1Rc-WT. The basal signaling activities of the tethered receptors were dependent on the amount of DNA used for the COS-7 cell transfection and followed a time course that closely resembled that observed for the agonist-stimulated hP1Rc-WT. The basal signaling of hP1Rc-[Arg11]Tether(1–11) resulted in approximately twice the level of intracellular cAMP that was obtained with a previously described constitutively active PTH-1 receptor, hP1Rc-H223R (17.Schipani E. Kruse K. Jüppner H. Science. 1995; 268: 98-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar), when the two receptors were transfected using equal amounts of plasmid DNA. The ability of a small peptide derived from the activation domain of PTH to stimulate G protein coupling when tethered to the body of the PTH receptor bears direct similarity to the intramolecular mechanism of activation utilized by the protease-activated receptors, such as the well characterized thrombin receptor (18.Chen J. Ishii M. Wang L. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16041-16045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the tethered PTH receptors of the present study, the native ligand sequences of PTH(1–9), PTH(1–10), and PTH(1–11) were weaker than the tethered PTH(1–11) sequence containing the Leu11 → Arg substitution, even though each of these tethered ligands was present at the same equimolar ratio, relative to the concentration of the membrane-embedded portion of the receptor. The level of expression of these receptors was likely to be comparable, given that each stimulated similar maximum levels of cAMP in response to high doses of an exogenous PTH(1–34) analog. There was not a simple correlation between PTH chain length and basal activity because hP1Rc-Tether(1–11) was statistically weaker than hP1Rc-Tether(1–10) (34 ± 1 and 52 ± 2 pmol/well, respectively, p < 0.001). The improved basal signaling of the Arg-11-containing tethered ligand is consistent with the favorable effect that this substitution had on the potency of PTH(1–11) and -(1–14) synthetic peptide analogs.2 This observation supports the hypothesis that the tethered PTH ligands utilize the same contact points for activating the receptor as do exogenous PTH peptide ligands. We examined the above hypothesis further by performing an alanine-scan analysis of the PTH (2.Roe E. Sanchez S. del Puerto G. Pierini E. Bacchetti P. Cann C. Arnaud C. J. Bone Miner.

In the case of hP1Rc-[Arg11]Tether(1–11), alanine substitution of Ser-3 yielded a mutant that resulted in 23% less cAMP accumulation than did the unsubstituted control tethered receptor. Substitutions of alanine at Gln-6 and His-9 yielded tethered receptor mutants that were nearly as active as hP1Rc-[Arg11]Tether(1–11) (basal cAMP levels were 83% and 67% of control, respectively, Fig. 6). Perhaps more importantly, alanine substitutions at Val-2, Ile-5, and Met-8 yielded receptors with markedly reduced basal cAMP signaling activity. These results on residues 2, 5, and 8 correlate closely with previous functional studies of PTH(1–14) (11.Luck M. Carter P. Gardella T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 670-680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as PTH(1–34)- or PTHrP (1–36)-length analog peptides (19.Gardella T.J. Jüppner H. Wilson A.K. Keutmann H.T. Abou-Samra A.B.

A recent computer modeling study has predicted that Ile-5 and Met-8 of PTH penetrate the heptahelical core of the receptor, whereas Val-2 interacts with extracellular loop 3 (22.Rölz C. Pellegrini M. Mierke D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6397-6405Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The results of several mutational analyses are in general support of these predictions, as residues within transmembrane domains 2, 5, 6, and 7 of the PTH-1 receptor have been shown to contribute importantly to PTH-induced cAMP-signaling responses (19.Gardella T.J.

Recent cross-linking data support such a receptor location for the N-terminal residues of PTH (8.Bisello A. Adams A.E. Mierke D.F. Pellegrini M. Rosenblatt M. Suva L.J. Chorev M. J. Biol.

The reasons for the greater mutational tolerance that we observed for certain PTH residues in the context of hP1Rc-[Arg11]Tether(1–11), in comparison to similarly substituted PTH(1–14) peptides (e.g. Gln-6, Leu-7, and His-9), are not clear at present. It is possible that the free PTH peptide and the tethered ligand utilize slightly different modes of receptor interaction. It also possible that an alanine substitution has a different effect on the secondary structure of the ligand when the ligand is a free peptide, as compared with when it is in a tethered configuration. A third possibility is that the high effective molarity of the tethered ligand could allow for a discrimination between those residues that principally affect receptor signaling and those that principally affect ligand binding. Residues of the latter category would be critical for detecting activity in short diffusible peptides but not when the same ligand sequence is fixed to the receptor, whereas residues of the former category would be essential in both situations. The ability to discern such a structure-function relationship within short N-terminal PTH peptides has not been available previously, because the cAMP potency and efficacy of any given analog is inextricably linked to its affinity for the receptor (12.Colquhoun D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 924-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Further work is needed to determine the precise contribution that each residue of the tethered PTH ligand makes toward the constitutive signaling activity of the receptor. The results presented in this report suggest that the tethered ligand system can offer new insights into the mechanism by which the N-terminal residues of PTH interact with the PTH-1 receptor and induce transmembrane signaling. The information from these and future studies on the tethered receptors could help to constrain the emerging three-dimensional models of the PTH/PTH-1 receptor complex. The dramatic minimization of the bioactive ligand sequence that is now possible due to the elimination of the need for high affinity binding should simplify such analyses and could lead to a better definition of the minimal pharmacophore required for PTH-1 receptor activation."

Most CD44-positive cells fail to exhibit constitutive HA receptor function but CD44-mediated HA binding on hematopoetic cells can be induced by antibody cross-linking of the receptor and by physiologic stimuli, including cytokines. We now demonstrate that oncostatin M (OSM) and transforming growth factor-β1, cytokines known to regulate the growth of tumor cells, stimulate HA binding in lung epithelial-derived tumor cells. In lung epithelial-derived tumor cells, cytokine-induced binding resulted from post-translational modification of the receptor. OSM-induced HA binding was associated with a reduction in N-linked carbohydrate content of CD44. In addition, OSM induced HA binding via a novel mechanism requiring sulfation of chondroitin sulfate chains linked to CD44. The mechanism underlying transforming growth factor-β1 induced HA binding was distinct from the effects of OSM. The data presented indicate that modulation of the glycosylation and sulfation of CD44 by cytokines provides mechanisms for regulating cell adhesion during tumor growth and metastasis.

CD44 is a broadly distributed cell surface glycoprotein that can mediate cell-cell adhesion and cell-matrix interactions (1.Goldstein L.A. Zhou D.F.H. Picker L.J. Minty C.N. Bargatze R.F. Ding J.F.

CD44 is encoded by a single gene, but is expressed as multiple isoforms ranging from 80 to 250 kDa. This structural diversity is generated by alternative RNA splicing as well as differences in glycosylation and the attachment of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)1 (4.Schlossman S. Boumsell L. Gilks W. White Cell Differentiation Antigens. Oxford University Press, New York1995Google Scholar). The most common form of CD44, referred to as standard or hematopoetic CD44 (CD44H), does not contain any of the differentially spliced “variant” exons (5.Stamenkovic I. Aruffo A. Amiot M. Seed B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). CD44 isoforms expressing variant exons have been demonstrated in epithelia, activated lymphocytes, and tumor cells (4.Schlossman S. Boumsell L. Gilks W. White Cell Differentiation Antigens.

CD44 is the principal receptor for hyaluronan (HA), a glycosaminoglycan that is ubiquitously distributed in extracellular spaces (4.Schlossman S. Boumsell L. Gilks W.

The ubiquitous expression of HA and the constitutive expression of CD44 by a wide variety of cells implies that the interaction between these molecules is regulated. Indeed, most primary CD44-positive cells fail to exhibit HA receptor function. However, cross-linking of cell surface CD44 by some anti-CD44 monoclonal antibodies induces HA binding (4.Schlossman S.

Evidence has also been accumulating that CD44-mediated HA binding can be induced by activation with physiologic stimuli including cytokines (4.Schlossman S. Boumsell L. Gilks W.

However, with the exception of a single example in which tumor necrosis factor-α-induced activation of CD44 was attributed to sulfation of a 90-kDa form of the receptor (19.Maiti A. Maki G. Johnson P. Science. 1998; 282: 941-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), the mechanisms utilized by soluble factors to modulate CD44-HA binding interactions remain unknown. Even in this case, the component of CD44 that was targeted for sulfation was not identified. CD44 has been implicated in tumor growth and metastasis (20.Thomas L. Byers R.H. Vink J. Stamenkovic I. J.

Transfection of cells originating from a non-metastatic tumor with a CD44 cDNA isolated from a metastatic tumor cell line conferred metastatic behavior (25.Gunthert U. Hofmann M. Rudy W. Reber S.

Tumorigenic and metastatic proclivity of human mammary carcinoma cell lines was shown to correlate with the capacity of the tumor cells to internalize and degrade HA via CD44 (26.Yu Q. Toole B.P. Stamenkovic I. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 186: 1985-1996Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Moreover, the enhanced tumorigenesis of CD44-transduced lymphoma and melanoma cells was found to be dependent on the ability of CD44 to bind HA (27.Naot D. Sionov R.V. Ish-Shalom D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1997; 71: 241-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite compelling evidence to support the concept that CD44-HA interactions play a role in tumorigenesis and metastasis, little is known about how CD44-HA interactions are regulated in tumor cells. In this study we investigated the effect of cytokines on the structure and function of CD44 on lung carcinoma cells. This is of particular interest because lung carcinomas represent a significant proportion of all human tumors. We demonstrate that oncostatin M (OSM) and TGF-β1, cytokines known to regulate the growth of tumor cells (27.Naot D. Sionov R.V. Ish-Shalom D. Adv.

Furthermore, we defined some of the post-translational modifications underlying the activation of CD44 adhesion function which provides mechanisms for regulating cell adhesion during tumorigenesis and/or metastasis. Human recombinant OSM and human recombinant TGF-β1 were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The following anti-human CD44 mAbs were used (4.Schlossman S. Boumsell L. Gilks W.

Purified hyaluronan from rooster comb (HA) was obtained from Sigma. Purified HA from human umbilical cords (HA-ICN) was purchased from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA). The molecular weight of the hyaluronan preparations were approximately 2.5 × 105to 9 × 105 Da according to the manufacturer's specifications. Fluorescein-conjugated rooster comb HA (FITC-HA) was prepared as described (31.De Belder A.N. Wik K.O. Carbohydr. Res. 1975; 44: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). PE-labeled anti-human CD44 and anti-human CD3 antibodies were purchased from PharMingen. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-fluorescein antibodies were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN). The fluorescent indicator calcein was purchased from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). RecombinantN-glycosidase F, O-glycosidase fromDiplococcus pneumoniae, and neuraminidase fromAthrobacter ureafaciens were all obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Chondroitinase ABC from Proteus vulgaris, chondroitinase AC and heparinase II fromFlavobacterium heparinum, keratanase fromPseudomonas, and hyaluronate lyase from Streptomyces hyalurolyticus were purchased from Sigma. HTB58 human lung squamous carcinoma cell line, HTB55 human lung adenocarcinoma, and Calu-6 anaplastic carcinoma were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Cells were cultured in Eagle's MEM (Biowhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 μg/ml gentamycin (all from Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY), and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA). Cells were plated, allowed to grow to confluency, and treated with the indicated factors. Cells were harvested using 0.2% EDTA or trypsin/EDTA (0.05%, 0.02%) and stained with 5–10 μg/ml PE-conjugated mouse anti-human CD44 antibody (G44–26) or PE-conjugated anti-human CD3 antibody as an isotype-matched negative control. Cells were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and analyzed on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Mansfield, MA). Soluble HA binding was assayed using saturating amounts of FITC-HA. Specific binding of FITC-HA to CD44 was determined by comparison of binding in the presence of blocking anti-CD44 mAb 5F12 or an excess of unlabeled HA. 96-Well tissue culture plates were coated with hyaluronan (ICN) at 1 mg/ml. Cells in suspension (1 × 106/ml) were loaded with 5 μg/ml calcein in HEPES-buffered saline for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing in HEPES-buffered saline, labeled cells were resuspended in MEM supplemented with 10% FBS and aliquoted into HA-coated wells. Plates were then incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Nonadherent cells were removed by washing and adherent cells were quantified using a fluorescence plate reader (Spectrafluor, SLT-Labinstruments Ges. m. b. H., Salzburg, Austria). Total RNA was isolated by SDS-phenol extraction and resolved by electrophoresis in agarose gels containing 2.2 m formaldehyde, followed by capillary transfer to Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Filters were hybridized with a 32P-labeled 1.4-kilobaseXhoI-XhoI restriction fragment of human CD44H (5.Stamenkovic I. Aruffo A. Amiot M. Seed B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The hybridization was carried out at 65 °C in 0.5 mphosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 7% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 100 μg/ml herring DNA. Blots were washed at 65 °C in 40 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA and exposed to x-ray film. Cells were lysed in PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitors (0.2 units/ml aprotinin, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates were normalized based on protein concentrations as determined using the BCA kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and equal amounts of protein were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-CD44 mAb (Hermes III) conjugated to Sepharose. Immune complexes were washed once with lysis buffer followed by three washes with PBS and resolved on SDS-7.5% PAGE under nonreducing conditions. CD44 was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) after electrotransfer to a PVDF membrane (NEN Life Science Products Inc., Boston, MA) and incubation with mouse anti-CD44 antibodies (G44–26) and donkey anti-mouse IgG antibodies conjugated to HRP. HA binding was analyzed by ECL after incubation of PVDF bound CD44 with FITC-HA followed by HRP-conjugated anti-fluorescein antibodies. CD44 was immunoprecipitated with Sepharose-conjugated anti-CD44 (Hermes III) mAb. CD44 was recovered from beads by boiling for 5 min in the presence of 0.1% of SDS. After addition of Triton X-100 (final concentration of 1%), affinity purified CD44 was treated at 37 °C for 24 h with 40 units/mlN-glycosidase F in 0.2 m sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, and 20 mm EDTA, or for 4 h with 100 milliunits/ml neuraminidase in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.01% bovine serum albumin. Treatment with chondroitin ABC (2 units/ml) and AC lyase (2 units/ml) as well as keratanase (30 milliunits/ml), heparinase II (5 units/ml), and hyaluronate lyase (50 milliunits/ml) was performed on CD44 bound to the Sepharose-conjugated Hermes III mAb in PBS at pH 7.4 (chondroitin ABC and AC lyases, keratanase), PBS at pH 7.0 (heparinase), or in buffer containing 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and 125 mm NaCl (hyaluronate lyase), for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were incubated in methionine-free medium containing 2% FBS and 200 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (Trans35S-label), or in sulfate-free MEM supplemented with 2% FBS and 500 μCi/ml Na235SO4 (ICN). Cytokines were added as indicated. Cells were lysed as for Western blot analysis. Aliquots of [35S]methionine/cysteine-labeled cell lysates were precleared with preimmune serum and then precipitated with anti-CD44 mAb (Hermes III) conjugated to Sepharose. Immune complexes were washed with high salt (0.6 m NaCl, 125 mmKPO4, pH 7.4, 0.02% NaN3), mixed detergent buffer (0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.6), and PBS. Aliquots of Na235SO4-labeled cell lysates were immunoprecipitated and washed as for Western blot analysis. CD44 was then treated with enzymes or directly released by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer and resolved on SDS-PAGE. Bands were detected by fluorography. Cells were lysed and extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with Sepharose-conjugated anti-CD44 (Hermes III) mAb. CD44 was then eluted from beads with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, and after neutralization to pH 7.0 with Tris-HCl buffer, CD44 was quantified by ELISA. Hermes III mAb-coated wells were used to capture CD44 and FITC-labeled G44–26 mAb and FITC-labeled rooster comb HA were used to quantitate total CD44 and HA binding, respectively. After incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-FITC mAb, the reaction was developed withp-nitrophenyl phosphate. Lung carcinomas represent a significant proportion of human tumors. OSM and TGF-β1 are known to regulate the growth of tumor cells and the function of lung epithelial cells (27.Naot D. Sionov R.V. Ish-Shalom D. Adv.

We found that OSM and TGF-β1 induced soluble HA binding to human squamous carcinoma-derived HTB58 cells (Fig.1, A and B), and induced CD44-mediated adhesion of HTB58 cells to an HA-coated substrate (Fig. 1 C). HA binding was further increased on cells treated with OSM plus TGF-β1. HA binding was CD44-mediated since it was abrogated by the anti-CD44 mAb 5F12. The increase in HA binding could not be attributed to increased levels of surface CD44 since no significant increase in binding of anti-CD44 to cytokine-stimulated cells was observed (Fig. 1 A). Treatment of HTB58 cells with hyaluronate lyase to remove endogenous HA increased HA binding capacity to a similar extent in control and in OSM-stimulated cells and to a lesser extent in TGF-β-stimulated cells (data not shown). These data indicate that CD44 may serve as an anchor for endogenous HA but argue against the possibility that exogenously added HA binds to other components in the pericellular matrix that are anchored by CD44. The enhancement of HA binding induced by OSM and TGF-β1 was evident at 24 h and increased further at 48 h. Therefore, in subsequent experiments cells were treated with cytokines for 48 h. Initial studies indicated that HA binding was evident in cytokine-stimulated HTB58 cells, even if fixed with formaldehyde prior to assaying. Furthermore, soluble CD44 spontaneously released from cytokine-stimulated HTB58 cells exhibited enhanced HA binding compared with unstimulated HTB58-derived soluble CD44 (data not shown). Therefore, we hypothesized that structural modification of the extracellular domain of CD44 was sufficient to mediate cytokine-enhanced HA binding. Cells of epithelial origin express the standard form of CD44, but expression of variant isoforms of CD44 is also a hallmark of epithelial cells (5.Stamenkovic I. Aruffo A. Amiot M. Seed B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Three major CD44 RNA species of approximately 1.6, 2.2, and 5 kilobases are characteristic for human cells expressing only the standard form of CD44 (5.Stamenkovic I. Aruffo A. Amiot M. Seed B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Transcripts of the same electrophoretic mobility were detected in HTB58 cells. Although we did not observe any significant increase in expression of CD44 at the cell surface, stimulation of HTB58 cells with OSM or TGF-β1 did up-regulate the steady state levels of the 1.6-, 2.2-, and 5-kilobase CD44 mRNAs. Importantly, however, cytokine stimulation did not lead to the expression of alternatively spliced mRNAs encoding variant exon(s) (Fig. 2 A). Two species of CD44 with average molecular mass of 90 and 180 kDa were immunoprecipitated from detergent lysates of HTB58 cells (Fig.2 B). In addition to the predominant 90-kDa standard form, a 180-kDa form of CD44 has also been detected in hematopoetic cells despite the fact that no expression of variant exons was detected (5.Stamenkovic I. Aruffo A. Amiot M. Seed B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Together with our data, these results are consistent with the 180-kDa species arising from post-translational modification of the standard form, including decoration with GAGs or dimerization of the standard form, as previously suggested (5.Stamenkovic I. Aruffo A. Amiot M. Seed B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Treatment with OSM alone or OSM plus TGF-β1 resulted in faster migration of both the high and low molecular weight forms of CD44 in HTB58 cells whereas TGF-β1 alone appeared to slightly retard the migration of both species of CD44. The OSM-induced decrease in the apparent molecular weight of CD44 resembled that previously associated with reduced glycosylation (11.Katoh S. Zheng Z. Oritani K. Shimozato T. Kincade P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 419-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Sulfation can facilitate functional interactions between adhesion molecules, including l-selectin, and their ligands (34.Sako D. Comess K.M. Barone K.M. Camphausen R.T. Cumming D.A. Shaw G.D. Cell. 1995; 83: 323-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar,35.Pouyani T. Seed B. Cell. 1995; 83: 333-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Recently, an increase in incorporation of sulfate into a 90-kDa species in response to tumor necrosis factor-α was suggested to regulate the function of CD44 in a human leukemic cell line (19.Maiti A. Maki G. Johnson P. Science. 1998; 282: 941-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, the component of CD44 that was inducibly sulfated was not determined. Both the 90-kDa form and species of >210 kDa were detected in anti-CD44 immunoprecipitates from lysates of sulfate-labeled HTB58 cells (Fig. 2 D). The 90-kDa form of CD44 immunoprecipitated from parallel cultures of unlabeled cells detected by immunoblotting and the CD44 immunoprecipitated from [35S]sulfate-labeled cells co-migrated. The highly sulfated high molecular weight species exhibited extensive microheterogeneity with an average mass of >210 kDa compared to an average mass of 180 kDa for the high molecular species detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 2) or [35S]methionine biosynthetically labeled CD44. The >210-kDa species was readily detectable by [35S]sulfate labeling in anti-CD44 immunoprecipitates even following washing under stringent conditions with high salt and mixed detergent buffers and was detectable by immunoblotting when the blot was overexposed (Fig.2 C). These data indicate that the >210-kDa species was less abundant although it was highly sulfated and therefore a major species detected by [35S]sulfate labeling. Conversely, the more abundant 180-kDa species of CD44 exhibited negligible sulfation. Treatment with OSM resulted in a marked increase in sulfate incorporation into CD44, particularly of the >210-kDa species while treatment of HTB58 cells with TGF-β1 had only a slight effect on incorporation of [35S]sulfate into CD44 (Fig.2 D). These data suggested that changes in sulfation are potentially involved in regulating the HA binding function of CD44 in OSM-stimulated lung-derived epithelial cells. Previously described assays detect HA binding to the total repertoire of CD44 species expressed by cells. To establish the biological significance of the differentially modified forms of CD44, we developed a cell-free blot assay for measuring HA binding to distinct species of CD44. Total cell lysates or CD44 immunoprecipitated from detergent lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes that were then incubated with FITC-labeled HA followed by HRP-conjugated anti-FITC antibodies. Reactivity was detected by ECL. To determine if HA binding to isolated CD44 correlated with HA binding to intact cells, we compared CD44-mediated HA binding to intact Calu-6, HTB55, and HTB58 cells by flow cytometry and to CD44 affinity purified from these cell lines and evaluated in the cell-free blot assay. The three cell lines expressed similar levels of CD44 but differed in their capacity to bind HA (Fig. 3 A); Calu-6 cells constitutively bind HA, HTB55 cells do not bind HA, and HTB58 cells exhibit an intermediate level of constitutive HA binding. In all three cases, HA binding to isolated CD44 in the cell-free blot assay correlated very well with HA binding to intact cells (Fig. 3,A and B). The anti-CD44 antibody 5F12 and an excess of unlabeled HA ablated the signal in the cell-free HA blot assay (Fig. 3 C), demonstrating the specificity of HA binding to isolated CD44. Furthermore, pretreatment of CD44 bound to PVDF membranes with an antibody, F10-44, that enhances HA binding to intact cells (4.Schlossman S. Boumsell L. Gilks W. White Cell Differentiation Antigens. Oxford University Press, New York1995Google Scholar) (data not shown), also augmented HA binding in the cell-free blot assay (Fig. 3 C). Thus HA binding of CD44 assayed in the cell-free system mimicked the HA binding activity of intact cells. Using the cell-free blot assay we could discriminate binding to the different species of CD44 expressed by HTB58 cells. Analysis of total cell extracts of unstimulated cells did not reveal any reactivity with HA. In contrast, prominent HA binding to a major 90-kDa species that co-migrated with the predominant form of CD44 was evident in analysis of whole cell lysates from OSM-stimulated HTB58 cells (Fig.3 D). When we enriched for CD44 by analyzing anti-CD44 immune complexes, HA binding to both the 90-kDa and 180-kDa species of CD44 isolated from HTB58 cells was detected (Figs. 3 and 4). Furthermore, treatment of HTB58 cells with OSM resulted in markedly increased HA binding to both the low and high molecular weight forms of CD44 (Fig.4). However, we did not detect any significant difference in affinity of CD44 for HA in the cell-free blot assay following TGF-β1 stimulation suggesting that OSM and TGF-β1 utilized different mechanisms for modulating CD44 receptor function. To elucidate the role of carbohydrates in cytokine-induced HA binding, HTB58 cells were subjected to metabolic or enzymatic deglycosylation and analyzed for CD44-mediated HA binding by flow cytometry. Disruption of N-linked glycosylation by exposure to tunicamycin was found to inhibit CD44-HA interactions whereas treatment of cells with neuraminidase, to cleave terminal sialic acid residues, markedly enhanced the CD44-mediated constitutive binding of HA to intact HTB58 cells (Table I). Treatment with neuraminidase also enhanced HA binding of cytokine-stimulated cells but to a lesser extent in OSM-treated cells then in cells stimulated with TGF-β1. The effects of tunicamycin and neuraminidase were not due to changes in the density of cell surface CD44 (Table I).Table IEffect of tunicamycin and neuraminidase on HA binding to HTB58 cells+Tunicamycin+NeuraminidaseHA binding (% positive cells)Control24.26.074.4OSM51.46.268.8TGF47.08.386.3OSM + TGF60.27.765.0CD44 expression (MFI)Control617.3514.5535.3OSM474.6473.1477.9TGF620.0490.0500.3OSM + TGF445.1550.2430.9Cells were cultured for 48 h in MEM containing 10% FBS and 1.5 μg/ml tunicamycin, 50 ng/ml OSM, and 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 as indicated.

Previous results from our laboratory demonstrate that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)) pathway controls transit through G1 phase of the cell cycle by regulating the induction of cyclin D1 mRNA levels and cyclin dependent kinase 4 (CDK4)-cyclin D1 activity. In IIC9 cells, PI 3-kinase activation also is an important controller of the expression of cyclin D1 protein and CDK4-cyclin D1 activity. Pretreatment of IIC9 cells with the selective PI 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002 blocks the α-thrombin-stimulated increase in cyclin D1 protein and CDK4 activity. However, LY294002 does not affect α-thrombin-induced cyclin D1 steady state message levels, indicating that PI 3-kinase acts independent of the ERK pathway. Interestingly, expression of a dominant-negative Ras significantly decreased both α-thrombin-stimulated ERK and PI 3-kinase activities.

The role of PI 3-kinase in growth probably involves the serine/threonine kinase, Akt (PKB), a downstream effector of PI 3-kinase, thought to be important for cell proliferation and antiapoptotic responses (31.Franke T.F.

Although the importance of the PI 3-kinase pathway in cell growth is well established, its role in the regulation of growth in not understood. α-Thrombin is a potent mitogen in IIC9 cells. The addition of α-thrombin to growth-arrested IIC9 cells stimulates an increase in endogenous ERK1 activity, and this activity is required for growth. 2A. J. Gardner and J. J. Baldassare, unpublished results. 2A. J. Gardner and J. J. Baldassare, unpublished results. In this study, we show that PI 3-kinase is required for α-thrombin-stimulated growth in IIC9 cells. We provide evidence that PI 3-kinase is required for cyclin D1 accumulation independent of the ERK pathway. Furthermore, these pathways are regulated at the level of Ras. Our data indicate that both the PI 3-kinase and ERK pathways coordinately regulate cyclin D1 expression to promote cell cycle progression. This is the first study to examine the role of PI 3-kinase stimulated by a G-protein-coupled receptor in the regulation of cyclin D1. IIC9 cells, a subclone of Chinese hamster embryo fibroblasts, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 4.5 g/liter glucose and 2 mml-glutamine (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Subconfluent IIC9 cells (80%) were growth-arrested by washing once with α-minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), containing 2 mml-glutamine (BioWhittaker) followed by a 48-h incubation in the same media. Human α-thrombin isolated from plasma (Sigma) was used at 1 unit/ml in all experiments. PD98059 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) was used at 15 μm. Wortmannin (Calbiochem) was used at 100 nm. LY294002 (Calbiochem) was used at 10 μm. Calphostin C (Calbiochem) was used at 10 μm. The cDNA encoding pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) or a HA-tagged dominant-negative Ras mutant, HA-RasN17 (a kind gift from Gary L. Johnson, University of Colorado) was transfected into subconfluent (60–80%) IIC9 cells using LipofectAMINETM (Life Technologies) following the manufacturer's protocol. 2 μg of each plasmid was mixed with 10 μl of LipofectAMINETM per 1 ml of medium. Six hours post-transfection, an equal volume Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.2% (v/v) fetal calf serum was added to the transfection mix, and the cells were incubated overnight. The following day, cells were growth-arrested by washing once with α-minimal essential medium followed by a 48-h incubation in the same medium prior to agonist stimulation. Transient transfection using LipofectAMINETM resulted in 80–90% expression efficiency as visualized by β-galactosidase staining. Growth-arrested IIC9 cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 1 unit/ml α-thrombin after preincubation in the absence or presence of 100 nmwortmannin, 10 μm LY294002, or 15 μmPD98059 for 30 min. At the indicated times, cells were washed twice in cold PBS and harvested by scraping into 150 μl of cold lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin). The lysates were sonicated briefly, and the insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. Protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined using Coomassie® Plus (Pierce) as recommended by the manufacturer. Protein lysates (10–25 μg) were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Boston, MA). Membranes were probed with polyclonal antibodies to cyclin D1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), Akt (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phopsho-Akt (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), or phospho-ERK1/2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as recommended by the manufacturer. Growth-arrested IIC9 cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 1 unit/ml α-thrombin after preincubation in the absence or presence of 100 nmwortmannin, 10 μm LY294002, or 15 μmPD98059 for 30 min. Cells were harvested 10 h after stimulation by washing twice in cold PBS and scraping into 100 μl of cold retinoblastoma (Rb) assay buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mmsodium fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin). Cell lysates were sonicated briefly, and the insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. Cyclin D1-CDK4 complexes were immunoprecipitated from supernatants containing equal amounts of protein by incubation with a monoclonal cyclin D1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 3 h at 4 °C, followed by an incubation with protein G-agarose (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. Cyclin D1-CDK4 immune complexes were pelleted by centrifugation and washed twice with cold wash buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2). Cyclin D1-CDK4 immune complexes were then resuspended in 30 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mmEGTA, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and 20 μmATP) and incubated with 2 μg/ml soluble GST-Rb fusion protein (Rb sequence encoding amino acids 379–928 inserted into pGEX-2T plasmid was a kind gift from Dr. Mark Ewen, Harvard University) and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. Samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (9.75%) and developed using a PhosphorImagerTM (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Growth-arrested IIC9 cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 1 unit/ml α-thrombin after preincubation in the absence or presence of 100 nmwortmannin, 10 μm LY294002, or 15 μmPD98059 for 30 min. At the indicated times, total RNA was isolated using TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA (20 μg) was electrophoresed in a 2% (w/v) agarose-formaldehyde gel. After electrophoresis, formaldehyde was removed from the gel washing gels in 0.5% ammonium acetate. RNA was then transferred to a Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the TurboblotterTM system (Schleicher & Schuell) and cross-linked onto the membrane using an ultraviolet cross-linker (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as recommended by the manufacturer. Randomly labeled [α-32P]dCTP cDNA probes were made using the Random Primed DNA Labeling Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Membranes were preincubated with rapid hybridization buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 65 °C and then probed simultaneously with cyclin D1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probes for 2 h at 65 °C. After hybridization, the membrane was washed twice with 5× SSPE (20 mm EDTA, 1 m NaCl, 50 mmNaH2PO4-H2O), 0.1% (w/v) SDS at room temperature and once with 1× SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. The membrane was developed using a PhosphorImagerTM (Molecular Dynamics). Growth IIC9 cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 1 unit/ml α-thrombin after preincubation in the absence or presence of 100 nmwortmannin, 10 μm LY294002, or 15 μmPD98059 for 30 min. At the indicated times, cells were washed twice in cold PBS and harvested by scraping into 100 μl of cold ERK lysis buffer and assayed as described previously (16.Weber J.D. Raben D.M. Phillips P.J. Baldassare J.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Growth-arrested IIC9 cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 1 unit/ml α-thrombin for 17 h after preincubation in the absence or presence of 100 nm wortmannin or 10 μm LY294002 for 30 min. Following the 17-h incubation, 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine (NEN Life Science Products) was added to the cells for an additional 3-h incubation. 3H-Labeled cells were washed twice with cold PBS, and the DNA was precipitated by incubating the cells in 5% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid for 30 min at 4 °C. The trichloroacetic acid-precipitated DNA was washed twice with cold 5% trichloroacetic acid and solubilized with 500 μl of 2% (w/v) sodium bicarbonate, 0.1n NaOH. The solution was neutralized with 100 μl of 5% trichloroacetic acid, and the trichloroacetic acid-precipitated [3H]DNA was quantified by scintillation counting. Growth-arrested IIC9 cells were labeled for 4 h with [32P]Pi at 0.2 mCi/100-mm dish in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker). Cells were then washed twice with phosphate-free medium and once with a saline buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl). Cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 1 unit/ml α-thrombin for 5 min following preincubation in the absence or presence of 100 nm wortmannin or 10 μm LY294002 for 30 min. After stimulation, cells were washed two times with PBS and harvested by scraping into 500 μl of IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mmMgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Homogenates were incubated for 10 min on ice and then centrifuged at 750 ×g for 5 min. The supernatants were treated with 100 μl of bovine serum albumin-coated charcoal for 5 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 750 × g to remove charcoal. Ras immune complexes were immunoprecipitated by incubation with a monoclonal p21 ras antibody (Oncogene) for 3 h at 4 °C, followed by an incubation with protein G plus agarose (Oncogene) overnight at 4 °C. Ras complexes were washed twice with IP buffer and three times with wash buffer (Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mmMgCl2, and 150 mm NaCl). Final pellets were drained and bound nucleotides were eluted in 20 μl of elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, 0.5 mm GDP, and 0.5 mm GTP). Eluants were heated at 65 °C for 5 min and centrifuged. The supernatants were spotted onto a polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer plate (Merck) and developed with 0.75 m KH2PO4, pH 3.4. GDP and GTP 32P-labeled fractions were quantified using a PhosphorImagerTM (Molecular Dynamics). Growth-arrested IIC9 cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 1 unit/ml α-thrombin for 10 min after preincubation in the absence or presence of wortmannin. After stimulation, cells were washed twice with PBS and harvested by scraping into in 400 μl of cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm sodium vanadate, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin). The lysates were sonicated briefly, and the insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. p85 immune complexes were immunoprecipitated from lysates containing 300–400 μg of protein by incubation with polyclonal p85 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) at 4 °C for 3 h, followed by an incubation with protein A-agarose (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. The p85 immune complexes were pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times with lysis buffer, three times with TNE (100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 m LiCl, and 100 mm sodium vanadate), and twice with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 100 mmsodium vanadate. After the last wash, 50 μl of TNE, 10 μl of phosphatidylinositol (suspended by sonication in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EGTA at 2 μg/ml), and 10 μl of 100 mm MgCl2 was added to the beads. The reaction was started by the addition of 5 μl of reaction buffer (0.88 mm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 20 mm MgCl2). Samples were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, and the reactions were stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 6 n HCl. Lipids were extracted by adding 160 μl of CHCl3/MeOH (1:1) to the samples and vortexing briefly. Labeled lipids were resolved by spotting on a silicon TLC plate (J. T. Baker Inc.) and developed with CHCl3/MeOH/4n NH4OH (9:7:2). Phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate production was quantitated using a PhosphorImagerTM (Molecular Dynamics). Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate isolated from bovine brain (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., Alabaster, AL) was included as a standard for TLC resolution of the lipids and visualized by iodine vapor. Subconfluent IIC9 cells were incubated for 24 h in myoinositol-free basal medium and then an additional 24 h with 1 μCi of [3H]myoinositol (NEN Life Science Products) in the same medium. LiCl was added to the cells 1 min prior to incubation in the absence or presence of α-thrombin for 15 min. Cells were washed with cold PBS, and total inositol phosphates were extracted in 600 μl of cold 4% HClO4 (v/v) for 30 min at 4 °C. To each supernatant, 50 μl of phenol red, 60 mm Hepes was added, and supernatants were neutralized with Na4OH and then centrifuged. The supernatants were applied to a 0.5-ml column of Dowex AG1 × 8 (200–400 mesh size), formate form (Bio-Rad). Columns were washed three times with 3 ml of water and three times with 3 ml of 0.05m ammonium formate, 0.005 m Borax. [3H]Inositol phosphates were eluted with 3 ml of formic acid, 1.8 m ammonium formate, and 1 ml was quantified by scintillation counting. Recently, much attention has focused on the role of PI 3-kinase in the regulation of cell growth. PI 3-kinase activity has been shown to be required for DNA synthesis in response to several mitogens (22.Roche S. Koegl M. Courtneidge S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9185-9189Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 23.Cheatham B. Vlahos C.J. Cheatham L. Wang L. Blenis J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8977-8982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To determine whether PI 3-kinase is essential for α-thrombin-stimulated growth in IIC9 cells, we investigated the effect of a selective PI 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002, on α-thrombin-induced DNA synthesis (Fig.1). Pretreatment of growth-arrested IIC9 cells with LY294002 inhibits α-thrombin-induced DNA synthesis as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1). Maximal inhibition of α-thrombin-induced DNA synthesis occurs at a concentration of 10 μm LY294002 (Fig. 1). Wortmannin, a less selective inhibitor of PI-3-kinase activity, also blocks α-thrombin-induced DNA synthesis in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). We next examined whether α-thrombin-induces the activation of endogenous PI 3-kinase activity. α-Thrombin stimulates a 2-fold increase in PI 3-kinase activity over levels found in growth-arrested IIC9 cells (Fig. 2 A). Although LY294002 is a potent selective inhibitor of PI 3-kinase activity, its effects are reversible (37.Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and subject to error when assayed in vitro by immunocomplex assays. To overcome this problem, we investigated whether LY294002 inhibits α-thrombin-induced Akt phosphorylation. This phosphorylation can be quantified by immunoblot analysis with a specific anti-phospho-Akt antibody. We reasoned that because the phosphorylation of Akt is dependent on PI 3-kinase activation (31.Franke T.F. Yang S.-I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N.

Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar), changes in its phosphorylation reflect changes in PI 3-kinase activity. α-Thrombin induces a rapid increase in Akt phosphorylation as detected by immunoblot analysis (Fig.2 B). Increased activity is detectable within 10 min and remains elevated for at least 60 min. Preincubation of IIC9 cells with 10 μm LY294002 blocks Akt phosphorylation (Fig.2 C). Importantly, treatment with 10 μmLY294002 decreased Akt phosphorylation to values seen in growth-arrested IIC9 cells, in agreement with its effects on DNA synthesis. To confirm our results, we also determined the effect of wortmannin, a nonreversible but less selective inhibitor of PI 3-kinase activity on both PI 3-kinase (Fig. 2 A) and Akt phosphorylation (data not shown). When IIC9 cells are incubated with 100 nm wortmannin 30 min prior to stimulation with α-thrombin, PI 3-kinase activity (Fig. 2 A) and Akt phosphorylation (data not shown) are below levels found in growth-arrested IIC9 cells. Previous data from our laboratory (16.Weber J.D. Raben D.M. Phillips P.J. Baldassare J.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) and others (15.Lavoie J.N.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20608-20616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar) have shown that inhibition of mitogen-induced signaling pathways affects CDK4 activity and progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. We therefore decided to determine whether inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity affects cyclin D1-CDK4 activation by quantifying the effects of LY294002 on α-thrombin-stimulated CDK4 activity. Stimulation with α-thrombin produces a 4-fold induction of CDK4 activity that is blocked by preincubation of IIC9 cells with 10 μm LY294002 (Fig.3). Interestingly, this concentration of LY294002 also reduces DNA synthesis and Akt phosphorylation to growth-arrested levels (Figs. 1 and 2 C). The effect of PI 3-kinase on CDK4 activity is similar to that seen with inhibitors of the ERK pathway in IIC9 cells (16.Weber J.D. Raben D.M. Phillips P.J. Baldassare J.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Previously, we (16.Weber J.D. Raben D.M. Phillips P.J. Baldassare J.J. Biochem.

Most notably, mutation or depletion of TAFII145p, the dTAFII250 homologue, affects only a small portion of the genome (9.Moqtaderi Z. Bai Y. Poon D. Weil P.A. Struhl K.

In contrast, inactivation of temperature-sensitive mutants of yeast TAF68/61,TAF60, TAF40, TAF25, andTAF17 resulted in much broader transcriptional phenotypes (15.Apone L.M. Virbasius C.A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 18847-18850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The interpretation of the results obtained using TAFII mutants has been complicated by the presence of certain TAFIIs in the SAGA histone acetyltransferase complex (21.Grant P.A. Schieltz D. Pray-Grant M.G. Steger D.J. Reese J.C. Yates J. Workman J.L. Cell. 1998; 94: 45-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 22.Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schlitz R.L. Howard T. Yang X.J. Howard B.H. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1998; 94: 35-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the broad transcriptional phenotypes of some TAFII mutants may result from their presence in both TFIID and the SAGA histone acetyltransferase complex (17.Moqtaderi Z. Keaveney M. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 675-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, although presence of some TAFIIs in both TFIID and SAGA may contribute to broader transcriptional phenotypes, it cannot solely explain these effects. Mutations in TAF40, whose translation product is believed to be part of TFIID but not SAGA, cause a broad transcriptional phenotype (19.Komarnitsky P.B. Michel B. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2484-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). There is a strong correlation between the severity of the effects of TAFII mutations on the integrity of the TFIID complexin vivo and the fraction of the genome affected by their inactivation. All TAFIIs whose inactivation leads to decreases in the expression of a large percentage of the genome cause a concurrent reduction of additional TAF subunits and TBP in vivo. In particular, the TAFII genes with similarities to the core histones are important for the structure of TFIID in vivo. In contrast, mutation or depletion of the two largest yeast TAFIIs, TSM1p or TAFII145p, has relatively minor effects on TFIID structure (9.Moqtaderi Z. Bai Y. Poon D. Weil P.A. Struhl K. Nature. 1996; 383: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 10.Walker S.S. Reese J.C. Apone L.M. Green M.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This is surprising considering that yTAFII145p (dTAFII250) is the subunit that binds to TBP with highest affinity (6.Reese J.C. Apone L. Walker S.S. Griffin L.A. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 22.Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schlitz R.L. Howard T. Yang X.J. Howard B.H. Qin J. Nakatani Y.

Biol. 1997; 17: 3081-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and dTAFII250 is absolutely essential to form a functional TFIID complex in biochemical reconstitution experiments (25.Chen J.L. Attardi L.D. Verrijzer C.P. Yokomori K. Tjian R. Cell. 1994; 79: 93-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). A logical explanation for these observations is that additional TFIID subunits bind to TBP in the absence of TAFII145p, and that the histone-like TAFIIs are more important for TFIID structure. Structural and biochemical studies on metazoan TAFIIs revealed that three TAFIIs adopt a structure similar to the histone fold of the core histones and are capable of forming dimer pairs (26.Hoffmann A. Chiang C.M. Oelgeschlager T. Xie X. Burley S.K. Nakatani Y. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1996; 380: 356-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 27.Xie X. Kokubo T. Cohen S.L. Mirza U.A. Hoffmann A.

Moras D. Cell. 1998; 94: 239-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The structure of the dTAFII60/dTAFII40 (yTAFII60/yTAFII17) dimer resembles that of histone H3/H4 in the nucleosome, and the primary sequence of hTAFII20 (yTAFII68/61) predicts its structure resembles histone H2B. The histone 2A-like dimerization partner of hTAFII20 (yTAFII68/61) in the hTFIID complex has been recently identified as hTAFII135 (29.Gangloff Y.-G. Werten S. Romier C. Carre L. Poch O. Moras D. Davidson I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 340-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These same studies identified the SAGA component Ada1, as the H2A partner of yTAFII68/61p in the SAGA complex. Unfortunately, there is no yeast protein that shows extensive sequence homology to hTAFII135, leaving the dimerization partner of TAFII68/61p in the yTFIID complex unidentified. The analysis of yeast TAFII68/61 contained in this report has addressed two important issues regarding the function of this gene and its role in the yTFIID complex. First, we have identified the putative C-terminal α-helix of TAFII68/61p as important for the interaction of TBP with the yTFIID complex, indicating that TAFII145p is not the only subunit capable of binding to TBP. Second, we have isolated a gene, TSG2/MPT1, as a suppressor of a TAF68/61 mutation and demonstrate that it can stabilize the mutant TFIID complex in vivo. Finally, we have identified Tsg2/TAFII48p as a bona fideTFIID subunit and provide genetic, molecular, and biochemical evidence that it is the dimerization partner for TAFII68/61p in the TFIID complex. pRS414-TAF68/61 was mutagenized in vitro for 60–120 min at 70 °C using hydroxylamine, purified and transformed directly into YJR20 (Mat a;Δtaf68:hisg; ade2–11; his3–11, 15; leu2–3, 112; ura3–1; trp1–1; can1–100; [RS416-TAF68/61]). Tryptophan prototrophs were replica plated onto 5-fluoroorotic acid-containing media at 23 °C and 37 °C, and mutants that supported growth at 23 °C, but not 37 °C, were isolated for further analysis. The ts− phenotypes were verified to be plasmid-linked by recovery of the plasmids, re-transformation into YJR20, and rescreening at the indicated temperatures. Mutants that ceased growth at ≤2 doubling times were analyzed further. The strain YJR21–9 (taf68–9) was transformed with a Yep13-based high copy genomic library obtained from the ATTC. Approximately 40,000 transformants were plated at 23 °C for 16 h and than transferred to 37 °C for 2–5 days. Colonies were isolated, and the plasmids were recovered from the cells and reintroduced into YJR21–9. Plasmids that conferred growth at 37 °C were sequenced, and the open reading frame conferring the suppression phenotype was identified by subcloning into pRS426 and rescreening in YJR21–9. The plasmid pGAL1-TSG2/TAF48 was constructed by cloning the polymerase chain reaction-amplified coding sequence ofTSG2/TAF48 into the vector pSW107 (10.Walker S.S. Reese J.C. Apone L.M. Green M.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and integrated at theTRP3 locus of the strain BY4705 (Mat α; ade2Δ::hisg; his3Δ200; leu2Δ0; lys2Δ0; met15Δ0; trp1Δ63; ura3Δ0). After verification, the chromosomal TSG2/TAF48 gene was deleted by homologous recombination using a polymerase chain reaction-based strategy resulting in the strain YJR475 (Mat α; ade2Δ::hisg; his3Δ200; leu2Δ0; lys2Δ0; met15Δ0; trp1Δ63; ura3Δ0;Δtsg2::LEU2; trp3::GAL1p-HA-TSG2::HIS3). Cultures of YJR475 were grown to an optical density of 1.0 in YP plus galactose, collected by centrifugation, washed once in YP, and grown in YP plus dextrose for the times indicated in the Fig. legends. Cells were grown to midlog phase in YP plus dextrose (unless indicated otherwise) and shifted to a 37 °C shaking water bath. Aliquots were taken from the culture prior to temperature shift and at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h thereafter. After centrifugation, cells were washed in ice-cold STE (Tris-EDTA plus 100 mmNaCl) and separated into two parts for the isolation of RNA and protein extract preparation. RNA was prepared (8.Apone L.M. Virbasius C.A. Reese J.C. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2368-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 10.Walker S.S. Reese J.C. Apone L.M. Green M.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and analyzed by S1 nuclease protection (30.Cormack B.P. Struhl K. Cell. 1992; 69: 685-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) or Northern blotting. Protein extracts were prepared by glass-bead disruption in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 0.7 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 25 mm sodium fluoride, and protease inhibitors (6.Reese J.C. Apone L. Walker S.S. Griffin L.A. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We find that the addition of NaCl to >0.6m significantly aids in the extraction of TAFs and other transcription factors. 20 μg of whole cell extract protein was fractionated on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose in buffers containing and lacking SDS, depending on the TAFs to be analyzed. Antibodies and Western blotting were described (10.Walker S.S. Reese J.C. Apone L.M. Green M.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Mid-scale extracts were prepared from 1-liter cultures of cells grown at the permissive temperature as follows. Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed in ice-cold STE plus 1 mmbenzamidine HCl and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and frozen. One cell pellet volume of buffer T containing 0.3m potassium acetate plus 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors (6.Reese J.C. Apone L. Walker S.S. Griffin L.A. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and 1 volume of glass beads were added, and the cells were broken by vortex mixing for 6 cycles of mixing and cooling. The beads and debris were separated by low speed centrifugation, and the supernatant was further clarified by centrifugation twice for 30 min at 30,000 × g. TFIID was immunoprecipitated from 1 ml of extracts diluted to 2–3 mg/ml protein with 0.3 m buffer T as follows. Antiserum was added for 2–4 h on ice, followed by an overnight incubation with protein A-agarose beads (Repligen). Protein A beads were collected by low speed centrifugation and washed three times for 10 min each in buffer T containing the concentrations of potassium acetate indicated in the figure legends. After a brief wash in buffer T containing 0.1 m potassium acetate, proteins were eluted in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The region of TAF68and taf68–9 encoding the conserved C-terminal portion of the protein was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-1. GlutathioneS-transferase (GST) proteins were produced in XA90 cells and purified on glutathione-agarose beads, and Bradford assays and Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels monitored protein concentrations. Equal amounts of GST fusion protein was bound to the beads. Yeast TBP and Tsg2/TAF48p was in vitro translated from pet15-yTBP (31.Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18194-18202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and bluescript-TSG2/TAF48, respectively, using a wheat germ transcription and translation (TnT) kit from Promega. Three micrograms of GST fusion protein bound to 5 μl of glutathione beads were incubated with 20 μl of wheat germ extract and 80 μl of binding buffer (20 HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.01% Nonidet P-40) at 4 °C for 60 min with agitation. Afterward, 200 μl of ice-cold binding buffer was added, and the beads were collected by low speed centrifugation. The beads were washed 4 times for 5 min each with 300 μl of binding buffer and finally eluted with SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue, treated with En3Hance (NEN Life Science Products), dried, and exposed to film. In vitro random chemical mutagenesis and plasmid shuffling was used to isolate three TAF68/61 mutants that could not support growth at 37 °C (Fig.1 A). The sequence of the mutants was determined, and it was found that all three alleles contained a single nucleotide change at nucleotide 1456 (ATG = +1) resulting in the change from a tryptophan residue to a stop codon at amino acid 486. The expressed protein is truncated for the last 54 amino acids (Fig. 1 B). It is interesting to note that the only tight ts− mutants we isolated out of a total 20,000 colonies screened contained the same mutation. Moreover, two ts− alleles ofTAF68/61 described in another report also contained truncations at and near this region (16.Michel B. Komarnitsky P. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 663-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Truncation at residue 486 removed the C-terminal α-helix (Fig. 1 B) but retained the three α-helices comprising the histone fold (32.Burley S.K. Xie X. Clark K.L. Shu F. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Inactivation of three different yeast TAFII mutants results in a specific cell cycle arrest phenotype (8.Apone L.M. Virbasius C.A. Reese J.C. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2368-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 10.Walker S.S. Reese J.C. Apone L.M. Green M.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar); we therefore analyzed the cell cycle phenotypes of the taf68–9 mutant following growth at the restrictive temperature. We found that shifting the taf68–9 mutant to the restrictive temperature caused a rapid cessation of growth with no specific cell cycle phenotypes (not shown). A previous study showed that inactivation of temperature-sensitive mutants ofTAF68/61 resulted in the reduced transcription of a large number of yeast genes (16.Michel B. Komarnitsky P. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 663-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effects oftaf68–9 inactivation on the transcription of yeast genes to verify the phenotype in our strain. A wild type strain, thetaf68–9 mutant, and as a control, a temperature-sensitive RNA polymerase II mutant (rpb1–1), were transferred to the restrictive temperature, and RNA was isolated at various times. The mRNA levels of seven representative genes were analyzed by S1 nuclease protection. Within 1 h of temperature shift, we found significant reductions in the mRNA levels of a number of RNA polymerase II-transcribed genes (Fig. 2 A and data not shown), but only minor effects were observed on the levels ofSPT15 and DED1 mRNA. The expression of an RNA polymerase III-transcribed gene (tRNA) was only mildly affected at later time points (Fig. 2 A). We next examined the effect of the inactivation of taf68–9 on the expression of a number of highly induced genes. The wild type and taf68–9 mutant was preincubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then treated under the inducing conditions described in the figure legends. Growth of thetaf68–9 mutant at 37 °C prevented the induction of theRNR2 gene by DNA damage and the derepression of theSUC2 gene (Fig. 2 B). Moreover, we found that the uninduced levels of SUC2 and RNR2 were reduced in the mutant. However, inactivation of taf68–9 did not affect the induction of all genes tested. Induction of the SSA4,CUP1, and CTT1 were not significantly reduced by the inactivation of the taf68–9 mutant but were strongly affected by mutations in the large subunit of RNA polymerase II (Fig.2 B). Incubation of certain TAFII mutants at the restrictive temperature results in the disruption of the TFIID complex and the degradation of TAFII subunits in vivo (10.Walker S.S. Reese J.C. Apone L.M. Green M.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 16.Michel B. Komarnitsky P. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 663-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar,19.Komarnitsky P.B. Michel B. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2484-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 20.Sanders S.L. Klebnaow E.R. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18847-18850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); therefore, we analyzed the effects of shifting thetaf68–9 mutant to the restrictive temperature on the steady state levels of TAFII protein. We found that incubation of the mutant at 37 °C caused a rapid reduction in the levels of TBP, TAFII145p, and TAFII47p and, to a lesser degree, TAFIIs 90p, 68p, 60p, 25p, and 17p (Fig.2 C and data not shown). In contrast, Sua7p, a nuclear protein not associated with TFIID or SAGA, was not affected. It appears that the TAFIIs not shared between TFIID and the SAGA complex (21.Grant P.A. Schieltz D. Pray-Grant M.G. Steger D.J. Reese J.C. Yates J. Workman J.L. Cell. 1998; 94: 45-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) are less stable in the mutant. Shifting a TBP (tbp1–1; Fig. 2 C) or a RNA polymerase II ts− mutant (not shown) to the restrictive temperature failed to cause similar reductions in TAFII protein levels, indicating that the reductions in TBP and TAFII protein in the taf68–9 mutant is largely at the level of protein turnover. Interestingly, growth of the TBP mutant at 37 °C resulted in the rapid turnover of TBP but not other subunits in the TFIID complex, indicating that TBP is not required for the stability of TAFIIs. Our results above demonstrate that inactivation of temperature-sensitive mutants ofTAF68/61 causes a loss of TBP protein within the cell that is faster and more severe than what is observed in TAF145mutants (10.Walker S.S. Reese J.C. Apone L.M. Green M.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This result is surprising in light of the fact that TAFII145p was identified as the single subunit of TFIID that binds to TBP with high affinity by Far Western blotting (6.Reese J.C. Apone L. Walker S.S. Griffin L.A. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). A logical explanation for these findings is that in the absence of TAFII145p another TFIID subunit binds to TBP and protects it from degradation. The human homologue of TAFII68/61p (hTAFII20) can bind to TBP in vitro (31.Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18194-18202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and it is likely that TAFII68/61p has this function. To test this hypothesis, we expressed the conserved C-terminal portion (amino acids 330–539) of TAFII68/61p as a GST derivative and used it in pull down assays to identify an interaction with in vitrotranslated TBP. This region alone retains all the essential functions of the full-length TAFII68/61protein because it can fully complement a TAF68/61 gene disruption (33.Moqtaderi Z. Yale J.D. Struhl K. Buratowski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14654-14658Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A GST derivative containing the activation domain of the herpesvirus protein VP16 was used as a positive control in our experiments. TBP was capable of interacting with the C terminus of TAFII68/61p; moreover, it bound to TBP more strongly than GST-VP16 (Fig.3 B). However, when the assay was carried out using a GST derivative corresponding to thetaf68–9 mutation, GST-taf68–9C (amino acids 330–485), we found the mutant was defective for its ability to interact with TBPin vitro (Fig. 3 B). The binding of TBP to the N terminus of TAFII145p and dTAFII230 has been extensively characterized (6.Reese J.C. Apone L. Walker S.S. Griffin L.A. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 22.Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schlitz R.L. Howard T. Yang X.J. Howard B.H. Qin J. Nakatani Y.

Cell. 1998; 94: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). To address the significance of the TBP-TAFII68/61 interaction, we compared the TBP binding ability of GST-TAFII68C versus GST-TAFII145N (amino acids 5–230) under identical conditions. The results contained in Fig. 3 C clearly show that TBP interacted equally well with the C terminus of TAFII68/61p and the N terminus of TAFII145p. Our TBP binding studies demonstrate that the C-terminal α-helix (485–539) of TAFII68/61p is required for its ability to bind to TBP and that this interaction is comparable with that of the well characterized TAFII145p-TBP interaction. We next sought to determine if the C terminus of TAFII68/61p is important for the interaction of TBP with the TFIID complex by comparing the ability of TFIID to co-immunoprecipitate with TBP in extracts of wild type and mutant cells. For this experiment, extracts were prepared from cells grown at the permissive temperature because incubation at 37 °C would result in the depletion of TAFs and ambiguous results. We failed to detect any differences in the co-immunoprecipitation of TFIID in extracts from wild type and mutant cells under our standard medium salt conditions (Fig. 3 D and data not shown). Since TAFII145p is present in these complexes, it is likely that its interaction with TBP is obscuring the detection of any differences between the wild type and mutant TFIID complexes that would otherwise be apparent in vivo. Therefore, we performed our analysis under conditions that disrupt the TBP-TAFII145Np interaction and accentuate the contributions of other TBP-TAF interactions. The TAFII145Np-TBP interaction is sensitive to pot"

Equilibrium binding studies showed that Escherichia coli HPPK-bound ATP or the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue α,β-methyleneadenosine triphosphate (AMPCPP) with high affinity. The fluorescent ATP analogue 2′(3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) adenosine 5′-triphosphate (MANT-ATP) exhibited a substantial fluorescence enhancement upon binding to HPPK, with an equilibrium dissociation constant comparable with that for ATP (10.4 and 4.5 μm, respectively). The apoenzyme did not bind the second substrate HMDP, however, unless AMPCPP was present, suggesting that the enzyme binds ATP first, followed by HMDP. Equilibrium titration of HPPK into HMDP and AMPCPP showed an enhancement of fluorescence from the pterin ring of the substrate, and a dissociation constant of 36 nm was deduced for HMDP binding to the HPPK·AMPCPP binary complex. Stopped flow fluorimetry measurements showed that the rate constants for the binding of MANT-ATP and AMPCPP to HPPK were relatively slow (3.9 × 105 and 1.05 × 105m−1 s−1, respectively) compared with the on rate for binding of HMDP to the HPPK·AMPCPP binary complex. The significance of these results with respect to the crystal structures of HPPK is discussed. 6-Hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase (HPPK) catalyzes the pyrophosphorylation of 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin (HMDP) by ATP to form 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphate, an intermediate in the pathway for folic acid biosynthesis.

For this reason, the enzymes of folic acid biosynthesis are an attractive group of potential antimicrobial drug targets. 6-Hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase (HPPK1; EC 2.7.6.3) catalyzes a vital step in the folate biosynthesis pathway, the pyrophosphorylation of 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin (HMDP) by ATP to form 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphate (DHPPP; see Fig. 1). DHPPP is a substrate for the next enzyme in the pathway, dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS; EC2.5.1.15), which catalyzes the condensation of DHPPP withpara-aminobenzoic acid to form dihydropteroate and pyrophosphate. Work by Brown and co-workers established that inEscherichia coli HPPK and DHPS are two separate enzymes that can be separated chromatographically (1.Weisman R.A. Brown G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 326-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Richey D.P. Brown G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1582-1592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Richey D.P. Brown G.M. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 18B: 765-771Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). More recently, the purification of both enzymes to homogeneity from E. coli has been described (4.Talarico T.L. Dev I.K. Dallas W.S. Ferone R. Ray P.H. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7029-7032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and subsequently the gene for HPPK was cloned and sequenced (5.Talarico T.L. Ray P.H. Dev I.K. Merrill B.M. Dallas W.S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5971-5977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cloning and expression studies on the sulDgene from Streptococcus pneumoniae have shown that this organism encodes a bifunctional enzyme, with HPPK and dihydroneopterin aldolase activities (6.Lopez P. Greenberg B. Lacks S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4766-4774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Lopez P. Lacks S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2214-2220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). (Dihydroneopterin aldolase catalyzes the previous step in the pathway to form the HPPK substrate HMDP.) Expression and partial purification of the S. pneumoniaeenzyme showed that it is much larger than E. coli HPPK, being a trimer or tetramer of subunit molecular weight 31,000. The enzyme has, however, a relatively high degree of sequence conservation, and homologues have been identified from a variety of organisms (8.Volpe F. Dyer M. Scaife J.G. Darby G. Stammers D.K.

The crystal structures of HPPK from Haemeophilus influenzaeand E. coli have been reported to resolutions of 2.1 and 1.5 Å, respectively (14.Hennig M. Dale G.E. D'arcy A. Danel F. Fischer S. Gray C.P.

The enzymes from both organisms adopt an α/β structure, with five helices packed around a four-strand antiparallel β-sheet. The fold generates a large crevice on the enzyme surface, approximately 26 Å long and 10 Å wide, which has been identified as the active site of the enzyme. A substrate analogue of HMDP was used to identify the principal residues involved in the recognition of the pterin ring; all of the potential hydrogen bond donors and acceptors in the pterin moiety are involved in hydrogen bonds to main chain or side chain atoms within the protein (14.Hennig M. Dale G.E. D'arcy A. Danel F. Fischer S. Gray C.P. Jolidon S. Muller F. Page M.G. Pattison P. Oefner C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of a nonproductive ternary complex has also been reported of E. coli HPPK in complex with ATP and an analogue of HMDP (16.Stammers D.K. Achari A. Somers D.O. Bryant P.K. Rosemond J. Scott D.L. Champness J.N. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The side chains from two Asp residues are involved in chelating two magnesium ions that lie adjacent to the α-, β-, and γ-phosphates within ATP and may play a role in stabilizing the reaction transition state. Although the crystal structures have provided valuable information about the tertiary structure of HPPK, more detailed enzymological information concerning ligand binding affinities for the enzyme is scant. Previous investigators have reported K mvalues for the two substrates, but the substrate binding order for HPPK has not been investigated (4.Talarico T.L. Dev I.K. Dallas W.S. Ferone R. Ray P.H. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7029-7032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Rebeille F. Macherel D. Mouillon J.M. Garin J. Douce R.

John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1984: 121-134Google Scholar). Here we show how the binding of both substrates to HPPK can be probed using fluorimetric measurements, allowing the measurement of equilibrium binding constants and some pre-steady state kinetic rate constants. The results are consistent with a compulsory order ternary complex mechanism, with ATP binding first in a relatively slow step, followed by the faster addition of HMDP. The following chemicals were obtained from Sigma: ATP, AMP, GTP, AMPCPP, GMP, Hepes, inorganic pyrophosphatase, and purine nucleoside phosphorylase. 6-Hydroxymethylpterin was from Schircks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland). 2′(3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) adenosine 5′-triphosphate (MANT-ATP) was from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). 2-Amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside (MESG) was prepared from (−)-2-amino-6-chloropurine riboside (Aldrich), methyl iodide, and thiourea by the method of Webb (19.Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). 6-Hydroxymethylpterin was reduced to HMDP by an adaptation of the method of Futterman (20.Futterman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 228: 1031-1038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gene for HPPK was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from E. coli genomic DNA using the following two primers: 5′-GGCAGCGAATTCATATGACAGTGGCGTATATTGCCATAG-3′, coding for the N terminus of the protein, with an NdeI site underlined, and 5′-GCAGCGGGATCCAAGCTTTTACCATTTGTTTAATTTGTCAAATGCTC-3′, coding for the C terminus of the protein, with a BamHI site underlined. The amplified gene product was digested with NdeI andBamHI before ligation into the pET-11a expression vector (Novagen), to generate the resulting plasmid pEH214. The DNA sequence of the gene was identical to that reported previously (5.Talarico T.L. Ray P.H. Dev I.K. Merrill B.M. Dallas W.S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5971-5977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid vector pEH214 was transformed into E. coli strain B834 (DE3), and an inoculum from a single colony was grown at 37 °C in a 2YT batch culture to an optical density at 600 nm (A 600) of 0.4. Expression was induced through the addition of 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and growth continued for a further 4 h. Cells were recovered by centrifugation (5000 rpm in a Sorvall GSA rotor at 4 °C for 30 min). The cell pellet was resuspended in a minimum volume of 20 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at pH 7.6 and stored frozen at −20 °C. Purification was by an adaptation of the method described by Talarico et al. (5.Talarico T.L. Ray P.H. Dev I.K. Merrill B.M. Dallas W.S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5971-5977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. A 220-ml DEAE-Sephacel column was used instead of Q Sepharose, the chromatofocusing step was omitted, and a 100-ml Sephacryl S-100 column was used for the final size fractionation step. The purity was estimated to be over 95% by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The final preparation was stored at 4 °C at a concentration of 4 mg/ml, with the addition of 0.05% (w/v) sodium azide. The specific activity was 2.0 μmol/min/mg, and the final yield gave a total of 6 mg of pure HPPK per liter of culture. N-terminal sequencing of this protein product gave the sequence Thr, Val, Ala, Tyr, and the results of electrospray mass spectrometry gave a mass of 17,948 Da, showing that the N-terminal methionine residue had been removed. Protein concentrations were measured using the method of Bradford (21.Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). HPPK activity was measured in 1 ml of 50 mmHepes/NaOH buffer (pH 7.6) containing 10 mmMgCl2, by coupling to a sequence of consecutive enzyme reactions in situ. The HPPK product, 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphate, was converted by an excess of DHPS, the next enzyme in the folate pathway, into dihydropteroate and inorganic pyrophosphate. The pyrophosphate is then converted to inorganic phosphate by cleavage with inorganic pyrophosphatase. Inorganic phosphate is used by purine nucleoside phosphorylase to cleave MESG into the products ribose-1-phosphate and a purine base. The cleavage of MESG gives an absorbance change at 360 nm between pH 6.5 and 8.5 (19.Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1.7 μg of purified HPPK in the presence of 0.015 units of purified DHPS from S. pneumoniae (22.Vinnicombe H.G. Derrick J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 752-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The concentrations of other components were as described by Webb (19.Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The progress of the reaction was monitored in real time at 25 °C using a UVICON 922 Spectrophotometer (Kontron Instruments). Titrations were carried out by measuring the changes in fluorescence of either MANT-ATP or HMDP upon binding to HPPK. Measurements were made using a quartz cuvette containing 3 ml of 25 mm Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.5) plus 2.5 mm MgCl2, maintained at 25 °C. The solution was stirred continuously during the course of the titration. Titration with HMDP required anaerobic conditions, which were obtained by purging the buffer extensively with oxygen-free nitrogen gas before the experiment and maintaining a steady stream of nitrogen across the surface of the solution during the titration measurements. For titrations conducted using MANT-ATP, the excitation wavelength was 356 nm, and the emission wavelength was 440 nm. For measurements based on HMDP fluorescence, the excitation wavelength was 330 nm and the emission wavelength was 430 nm. Fluorescence values were corrected for the inner filter effect using the method described previously (23.Birdsall B. King R.W. Wheeler M.R. Lewis C.A. Goode S.R. Dunlap R.B. Roberts G.C.K. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Stopped flow measurements were carried out using an SX.18MV spectrometer (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK). The light source used was a 150-watt xenon lamp; for experiments using MANT-ATP, the excitation wavelength was 356 nm, using a 2.5-mm slit width. For HMDP, the excitation wavelength was at 330 nm, and a 3.0-mm slit width was used. The temperatures of the drive syringes and observation chamber were controlled by water circulation, and all experiments were carried out at 25 °C. The mixing ratio was 1:1 for all experiments. Solutions of ligands and enzyme were prepared by dilution into 25 mm Hepes/NaOH and 2.5 mmMgCl2 (pH 7.5). The buffer was purged extensively with oxygen-free nitrogen gas immediately before use. Anaerobic conditions were maintained in the drive syringes by using an accessory, supplied by the manufacturer, that fitted over the seals of the drive syringes and was filled with a continuous stream of oxygen-free nitrogen gas. The flow tubing was purged of oxygen by presoaking in glucose oxidase and glucose, as recommended by the manufacturer. Finally, the water in the circulating water bath was purged of oxygen with oxygen-free nitrogen gas and treated with dithionite immediately before use. These precautions were sufficient to prevent HMDP oxidation during the lifetime of the experiment. Data acquisition and processing were controlled by a 32-bit RISC processor workstation. Apparent rate constants were determined by fitting the data to a single exponential expression using the Applied Photophysics SpectraKinetic software version 4.38. A column of Sephadex G-50 (10-mm inner diameter × 300 mm) was connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography apparatus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and equilibrated in 25 mm Hepes/NaOH and 2.5 mmMgCl2 buffer at pH 7.5 at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was then saturated with an appropriate ligand (5 μm AMP-CPP, 5 μm HMDP, or 10 μm ATP) before the addition of 0.1 ml (0.4 mg) of HPPK stock. The optical density of the eluent was monitored at 254 nm using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech UV-MII detector. Steady state reaction velocities were fitted using the software package Enzfitter (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). The data were fitted using the Marquardt-Levenberg method with simple weighting. For the titration of HPPK into MANT-ATP, the concentration of enzyme in the bound form was calculated from the quadratic root, EA=((Et+Kd+At)−((Et+Kd+At) 2−4Et·At) 0.5)/2Equation 1 where E t is the total concentration of enzyme, A t is the total concentration of MANT-ATP, and K d is the equilibrium dissociation constant. Fluorescence values were then calculated from the expression, F=Fo+(EA/At)·FampEquation 2 where F is the calculated fluorescence value,F o is the starting fluorescence value (when [HPPK] = 0), and F amp is the total amplitude of fluorescence change at infinite [HPPK]. The data were fitted using Enzfitter, employing the Marquardt-Levenberg method and with simple weighting. For the experiments in which MANT-ATP is displaced from HPPK by another ligand, calculation of the fluorescence requires computation of the residual amount of enzyme·MANT-ATP binary complex that remains at any point during titration with the second ligand. This must be determined by solution of the following cubic, a·[EA] 3+b·[EA] 2+c·[EA]+d=0Equation 3 where [EA] is the concentration of the enzyme·MANT-ATP binary complex, and a, b,c, and d are defined as follows, a=Ka−KbEquation 4 b=Et·Kb+2At·Kb−Ka 2+Bt·Ka−Et·Ka+Ka·Kb−Ka·AtEquation 5 c=−2At·Et·Kb−At 2·Kb−Ka·At·Bt+Ka·At·Et−Kb·Ka·AtEquation 6 d=Kb·Et·At2Equation 7 where E t is the total concentration of enzyme, A t is the total concentration of MANT-ATP,K a is the equilibrium dissociation constant for MANT-ATP, K b is the equilibrium dissociation constant for the competitor ligand (e.g. ATP), andB t is the total concentration of competitor ligand. For each concentration of B t, the value of [EA] was determined iteratively using Newton's method. Fluorescence values were then calculated from the expressionF = F o +F1·([EA]/[EA]o), whereF o + F1 and [EA]oare the fluorescence value and concentration of EA whenB t = 0, and F1 is a constant. Optimal values of K b and F1 were then determined by minimization of the sum of the square of the residuals between the observed and calculated fluorescence values. For the titration of HPPK into AMPCPP and HMDP, a compulsory order binding mechanism was assumed, with AMPCPP binding first, followed by HMDP to form the nonproductive HPPK·AMPCPP·HMDP ternary complex. There are therefore only two equilibria to consider: HPPK + AMPCPP = HPPK·AMPCPP and HPPK·AMPCPP + HMDP = HPPK·AMPCPP·HMDP. If ligand A represents AMPCPP and ligand B represents HMDP, the following can be shown, (Et−[EA]−[EAB])·(At−[EA]−[EAB])−[EA]·Ka=0Equation 8 where [EAB]=([EA]·Bt)/([EA]+Kb)Equation 9 and A t is the total concentration of AMPCPP,B t is the total concentration of HMDP,E t is the total enzyme concentration,K a is the dissociation constant for AMPCPP binding to HPPK, and K b is the dissociation constant for HMDP binding to the HPPK·AMPCPP binary complex. For each concentration of E t, the values of [EA] and [EAB] were determined iteratively using Newton's method. Fluorescence values were then calculated from the expressionF = F o +F1·([EAB]/B t), whereF o is the fluorescence value whenE t = 0 and F1 is a constant. Optimal values of K b and F1 were then determined by minimization of the sum of the square of the residuals between the observed and calculated fluorescence values. In order to study the binding of individual ligands to HPPK, it was useful to be able to generate a nonproductive ternary complex containing a substrate analogue. The nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue AMPCPP was identified as a potential inhibitor of HPPK, because it contains a carbon atom at the scissile bond for pyrophosphoryl transfer from ATP. A novel and convenient spectrophotometric assay for HPPK was developed that used the next enzyme in the pathway, DHPS, to form inorganic pyrophosphate from the products of the HPPK reaction. The pyrophosphate was then converted to phosphate with pyrophosphatase and linked to a phosphate-dependent colorimetric change using purine nucleoside phosphorylase (see “Experimental Procedures”). Measurement of the steady state velocity of the HPPK reaction at a range of different AMPCPP and ATP concentrations established that AMPCPP was a competitive inhibitor with respect to ATP, with aK i of 0.31 μm (data not shown). The ligand binding characteristics of E. coli HPPK were examined using the method of Hummel and Dreyer (24.Hummel J.P. Dryer W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 63: 530-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). This is convenient to use, because both ATP and HMDP absorb ultraviolet light. A column of Sephadex G-50 gel matrix was pre-equilibrated with buffer containing the selected ligand and HPPK applied in a small volume. The absorbance of the eluent was monitored as a function of time. In the absence of any equilibrating ligand, HPPK eluted as a single absorbance peak (data for these experiments not shown). If the column was pre-equilibrated with ATP or AMPCPP, a peak of increased absorbance eluted that is coincident with the enzyme, which arose from the formation of the enzyme·ATP binary complex. This peak was followed by a trough of reduced absorbance, which arose from depletion of ligand by binding to the enzyme. The experiment was repeated using HMDP as the equilibrating ligand; the elution profile was identical to the control without ligand, indicating that the apoenzyme does not bind to HMDP. Inclusion of AMPCPP with HMDP in the equilibrating buffer gave a substantially increased absorbance peak coincident with HPPK elution, followed by a large trough, indicating that binding of both ligands occurs under these conditions. The results suggest a compulsory order of substrate binding, at least at the low concentrations of ligands studied here, with AMPCPP binding to the enzyme first, followed by HMDP. We proceeded to test this hypothesis by a more detailed analysis of ligand binding using fluorescence detection. 2′(3′)-O-(N-Methylanthraniloyl) adenosine 5′-triphosphate (MANT-ATP) is a fluorescent analogue of ATP that has been used to study the binding of ATP to other proteins (25.Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar,26.Woodward S.K.A. Eccleston J.F. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 422-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments established that MANT-ATP is a substrate for HPPK and would therefore be an ideal probe for ATP binding (data not shown). Titration of HPPK into a fixed concentration of MANT-ATP led to a 2.5-fold enhancement of fluorescence, and the data were consistent with a single, saturable binding site for MANT-ATP, with aK d of 10.4 μm (Fig.2). The binding constants for other ligands can be obtained by competition; for example, the addition of ATP to the HPPK·MANT-ATP binary complex reduced the fluorescence in a manner consistent with competitive displacement of MANT-ATP by ATP (Fig. 3). ATP and MANT-ATP were found to have similar equilibrium binding constants, but AMPCPP binds approximately 10-fold more tightly (TableI). A product of the reaction, AMP, binds about 10-fold more weakly than ATP, and, interestingly, the enzyme has affinity for GTP and GMP, albeit 75-fold weaker than for ATP binding.Figure 3Displacement of bound MANT-ATP from HPPK by ATP. ATP was titrated into a solution containing 2 μm MANT-ATP and 3.5 μm HPPK, and the fluorescence was measured at the concentrations shown. Other conditions are as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data points are means for three observations ± S.E. The data were fitted to a model for competitive inhibition at a single binding site using a nonlinear least squares fitting method described under “Experimental Procedures.” The graph shows the predicted fluorescence, indotted lines, for a K d value for ATP of 4.5 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IEquilibrium dissociation constants for binding of nucleotides to HPPKNucleotideK dμmMANT-ATP10.4 ± 0.3AMPCPP0.45 ± 0.04ATP4.5 ± 0.6AMP48 ± 5GTP340 ± 50GMP340 ± 70Dissociation constants were measured by displacement of MANT-ATP from HPPK as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Dissociation constants were measured by displacement of MANT-ATP from HPPK as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The fluorescence of the pterin ring can be exploited to measure the binding of HMDP to the enzyme. The addition of HPPK alone to HMDP resulted in no detectable change in pterin fluorescence, presumably because the apoenzyme does not bind to HMDP. The addition of HPPK to AMPCPP and HMDP, however, resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in fluorescence (Fig.4). Similar results could be obtained if AMPCPP, rather than HPPK, was titrated into HMDP and HPPK (results not shown). The data in Fig. 4 were analyzed according to a compulsory order model where AMPCPP binds to the enzyme first, followed by HMDP; the predicted results are shown as dashed linesin Fig. 4 and gave an estimated K d for the binding of HMDP to the HPPK·AMPCPP binary complex of 36 nm. The equilibrium measurements described above were extended to measure the rate constants for substrate binding to HPPK by stopped flow fluorimetry. Rapid mixing of HPPK and MANT-ATP resulted in a slow increase in fluorescence that can be fitted to a single exponential (Fig.5). The apparent rate constant (k app) was measured at a series of different MANT-ATP concentrations, and the results are shown in Fig.6. The intercept gives an estimate of the rate constant for dissociation of MANT-ATP from the enzyme·MANT-ATP binary complex (k −1); in this case, it is 0.47 s−1. The gradient of the line gives a measure of the association rate constant (k +1) for MANT-ATP binding to HPPK of 3.9 × 105m−1s−1.Figure 6Dependence of apparent rate constant for MANT-ATP binding to HPPK with MANT-ATP concentration. Data were collected as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each point is the mean ± S.E. for three observations. The final concentration of HPPK (after mixing) was 0.25 μm. The data were fitted by linear regression as implemented in Enzfitter to yield a gradient of 3.9 ± 0.3 × 105m−1 s−1and intercept of 0.47 ± 0.21 s−1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The fluorescence of the pterin ring was used to monitor the binding of HMDP to the enzyme. Rapid mixing of HMDP plus AMPCPP in syringe A with the apoenzyme in syringe B resulted in an increase in fluorescence that could be described by a single exponential, similar to that shown in Fig. 5 (data not shown). The same result was obtained if the enzyme and HMDP were pre-equilibrated in syringe B and mixed rapidly with AMPCPP in syringe A. If, however, the enzyme was pre-equilibrated with AMPCPP in syringe B and then mixed with HMDP in syringe A, the slow fluorescence response was not observed. A series of experiments were carried out using different concentrations of HMDP and AMPCPP in syringe A and a fixed concentration of HPPK in syringe B. If the HMDP concentration is fixed, the apparent rate constant (k app) for fluorescence change varies in a linear manner with [AMPCPP] (Fig. 7).k app did not vary, however, when the AMPCPP concentration was fixed and [HMDP] was changed up to 50 μm (data not shown). Our interpretation of these results is that the association of AMPCPP with the HPPK apoenzyme is slow and is followed by the relatively rapid addition of HMDP. The slow increase in HMDP fluorescence is therefore dependent on the rate of association of HPPK with AMPCPP, and as soon as the binary complex is formed, HMDP binds rapidly with a concomitant change in fluorescence. If this interpretation is correct, the gradient of the line in Fig. 7 is a measure of the association rate constant (k +1) for AMPCPP binding to HPPK; this value (1.05 × 105m−1 s−1) is the same order of magnitude as that obtained above for MANT-ATP (3.9 × 105m−1s−1). The intercept of the line in Fig. 7 therefore corresponds to the dissociation rate constant for HMDP from the nonproductive ternary complex (k −2) and gives a value of 0.50 s−1. Although some steady state kinetic data have been reported previously for HPPK, these studies were confined to measurements of apparent K m values for one substrate at a fixed concentration of the second substrate. The results of the steady state kinetics of E. coli HPPK at multiple concentrations of ATP and HMDP were analyzed assuming the initial velocity for a compulsory order ternary complex reaction, which is given by Equation 10. v=Vmax·[A]·[B]/(KiA·KmB+KmB·[A]+KmA·[B]+[A]·[B])Equation 10 This expression assumes that substrate A binds first to the enzyme, followed by substrate B (27.Cornish-Bowden A. Fundamentals of Enzyme Kinetics. Butterworth Inc., Woburn, MA1979: 109Google Scholar). The data were fitted to this expression using Enzfitter, to give the following estimated parameters:K m A (ATP) = 3.44 ± 0.02 μm; K m B (HMDP) = 0.60 ± 0.01 μm; K i A = 2 × 10−7 ± 0.08 μm (steady state velocity data not shown). The K i A term is effectively zero within the limits of error, so the data can be fitted to the following simplified expression. v=Vmax·[A]·[B]/(KMB·[A]+KMA·[B]+[A]·[B])Equation 11 Under these circumstances, the apparent K m for each substrate is independent of the concentration of the second substrate. The data were in good agreement with Equation 11 and gave aK M A (ATP) of 3.2 ± 0.3 μmand a K M B (HMDP) of 0.68 ± 0.07 μm. The results show that the steady state kinetic data are at least consistent with a compulsory order ternary complex mechanism, within the limits of experimental error. The results presented here have provided evidence for a compulsory order of addition of the two substrates to HPPK, with ATP binding first in a slower step, followed by the more rapid addition of HMDP. It is important to try to reconcile these observations with the reported crystal structures of E. coli and H. influenzaeHPPK in complex with various ligands. Xiao et al. examined the binding of ATP and HMDP to E. coli HPPK independently by NMR; both ligands induced significant changes in the backbone amide1H or 15N chemical shifts (15.Xiao B. Shi G. Chen X. Yan H. Ji X. Structure. 1999; 7: 489-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that these experiments were conducted at millimolar concentrations of protein and ligand, and the binding of HMDP to the apoenzyme may be occurring at a much lower affinity than the high affinity binding to the AMPCPP·HPPK binary complex observed here. Stammers et al. (16.Stammers D.K. Achari A. Somers D.O. Bryant P.K. Rosemond J. Scott D.L. Champness J.N. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) have reported the solution of two crystal structures with HMDP analogues bound to E. coliHPPK; these compounds, 40Y67 and 87Y76, contain methyl- or phenethyl- substituents at the 7-position within the pterin ring and were originally identified as potent inhibitors of HPPK by Wood and co-workers (28.Wood H.C.S. Pfleiderer W. Chemistry and Biology of Pteridines. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1975: 27-49Google Scholar). It may be the case that 40Y67 and 87Y76 have higher affinity for the apoenzyme than HMDP itself, which would explain why observable electron density for the ligand can be seen in the binary complex with HPPK. Hennig et al. (14.Hennig M. Dale G.E. D'arcy A. Danel F. Fischer S. Gray C.P. Jolidon S. Muller F. Page M.G. Pattison P. Oefner C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) have reported the measurement of an equilibrium binding constant of 20 μm for ATP binding toH. influenzae HPPK, determined by titration of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. No observations were made, however, on the binding of ATP analogues, nor were the pre-steady state kinetics of binding investigated. We find here that MANT-ATP is a useful probe of ATP binding to HPPK; the addition of the fluorescent methylanthraniloyl group to the 2′ or 3′ group of the ribose ring does not seriously impair the binding affinity of MANT-ATP for HPPK, compared with ATP. Unfortunately, at the time of writing, only the coordinates of theE. coli apoenzyme form are available from the Protein Data Bank (accession code 1HKA). Most of the interactions with ATP observed in the complex with E. coli HPPK are apparently with the adenine ring or the triphosphate portions of the molecule, so it appears plausible that MANT-ATP could act as an effective analogue of ATP (16.Stammers D.K. Achari A. Somers D.O. Bryant P.K. Rosemond J. Scott D.L. Champness J.N. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Two magnesium ions are chelated within the complex by the phosphate oxygen atoms in ATP and also by Asp-95 and Asp-97 from the protein; removal of these interactions may explain why AMP binds with about 10-fold lower affinity than ATP. The results of stopped flow experiments using MANT-ATP or AMPCPP give similar values for the on-rate for binding of both of these ligands to HPPK, of about 105m−1s−1. This is approximately 3 orders of magnitude slower than the fastest second order rate constants for small ligands binding to proteins (29.Gutfreund H. Kinetics for the Life Sciences. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1995Crossref Google Scholar). A rough estimate of the rate constant for the addition of HMDP to the AMPCPP·enzyme binary complex can be obtained from the equilibrium binding constant (36 nm) and the measured off-rate for HMDP (0.50 s−1); the ratio gives a value of 1.4 × 107m−1 s−1. This suggests that AMPCPP and, by inference, ATP bind slowly to the enzyme, but once the binary complex is formed the addition of HMDP is very rapid. The very high binding affinity of the AMPCPP·HPPK complex for HMDP probably reflects the low concentration of this intermediatein vivo. It also suggests that the design of antimicrobial inhibitors, targeted at the HMDP binding site, should be based on the HPPK·ATP binary complex, rather than the apoenzyme. Although the present study has illuminated some aspects of the HPPK reaction, there are still several details of the structure and mechanism of this enzyme that remain to be elucidated. The structural basis for the low affinity of the apoenzyme for HMDP and the high affinity of the AMPCPP·HPPK binary complex for the ligand is unclear at present; very few structural changes apparently occur upon formation of the 87Y76·ATP·HPPK ternary complex (16.Stammers D.K. Achari A. Somers D.O. Bryant P.K. Rosemond J. Scott D.L. Champness J.N. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for the catalysis of the pyrophosphoryl transfer is also uncertain, although it has been suggested that the magnesium ions, in conjunction with Asp-95 and Asp-97, may play a role in stabilizing the transition state. In general, the reaction mechanisms of pyrophosphokinases are poorly understood, but the extent to which HPPK is a paradigm for this type of enzyme remains to be seen.

The homeodomain transcription factor IDX1/IPF1, the expression of which was thought until recently to be restricted to the pancreas and foregut, is required for pancreas development and for the expression of genes controlling glucose homeostasis. We report that IDX1/IPF1 is also expressed in embryonic rat brain at a time coincident with active neurogenesis. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with nuclear extracts of embryonic brains indicated that IDX1/IPF1 binds to two somatostatin promoter elements, SMS-UE-B and the recently discovered SMS-TAAT3. The requirement of these elements for IDX1/IPF1 transactivation of the somatostatin gene in neural cells was confirmed in transfection studies using embryonic cerebral cortex-derived RC2.E10 cells. Immunohistochemical staining of rat embryos showed IDX1/IPF1-positive cells located near the ventricular surface in germinative areas of the developing central nervous system. Cellular colocalization of IDX1/IPF1 and somatostatin was found in several areas of the developing brain, including cortex, ganglionic eminence, hypothalamus, and inferior colliculus.

During gestation, expression of individual homeodomain genes is critical for proper regional development of the central nervous system (CNS)1 and peripheral tissues of the embryo. IDX1/IPF1 (also known as STF-1 and PDX-1) is a transcription factor encoded by a Hox-like homeodomain gene, the expression of which was initially described to be restricted to the pancreas and duodenum, and it has been demonstrated that pancreas development requires IDX1/IPF1 in mice (1.Jonsson J. Carlsson L. Edlund T. Edlund H. Nature. 1994; 371: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar, 2.Offield M.F. Jetton T.L. Labosky P.A. Ray M. Stein R.W. Magnuson M.A. Hogan B.L. Wright C.V. Development. 1996; 122: 983-995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This requirement was confirmed in the human by the identification of an individual with pancreatic agenesis and a homozygous mutation in the IPF-1 gene (3.Stoffers D.A. Zinkin N.T. Stanojevic V. Clarke W.L. Habener J.F. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). In addition, IDX1/IPF1 is essential for normal pancreatic islet function by regulating the expression of a number of pancreatic genes, including insulin, somatostatin, islet amyloid polypeptide, and glucose transporter type 2 (4.Carty M.D. Lillquist J.S.

Importantly, in humans, heterozygous mutations of the IPF-1 gene are linked to a type of autosomal dominant diabetes mellitus known as maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY4) (9.Stoffers D.A. Ferrer J. Clarke W.L. Habener J.F. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 138-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In the developing neural tube, different homeodomain genes that control mechanisms of regional and cellular determination are selectively expressed in the primordia of the three major regions of the CNS: forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain (10.Rubenstein J.L.R. Shimamura K. Martinez S. Puelles L. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 445-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). In the hindbrain, certainHox-like homeodomain genes specify positional information utilized by neural precursor cells to develop into appropriate types of neurons or glial cells (11.Lumsdem A. Krumlauf R. Science. 1996; 274: 1109-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). A similar type of code involvingLIM and Pax homeodomain genes operates in the spinal cord (12.Tanabe Y. Jessell T.M. Science. 1996; 274: 1115-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). In the midbrain, proper development requires the expression of engrailed genes (13.Millen K.J. Wurst W. Herrup K. Joyner A.L. Development. 1994; 120: 695-706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Wurst W. Auerbach A.B. Joyner A.L. Development. 1994; 120: 2065-2075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the forebrain, expression of most Hox genes is not readily detectable. However, other classes of mammalian homeobox genes, including Nkx, Otx, Emx, andDlx, show restricted patterns of expression preferentially located in the forebrain (15.Shimamura K. Hartigan D.J.

In addition, homeodomain transcription factors of two other classes (POU and Pax) are important for forebrain development (20.Alvarez-Bolado G. Rosenfeld M.G. Swanson L.W. J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 355: 237-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 21.Ryan A.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1207-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 22.Shimazaki T.

Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1395-1412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a preliminary study, we found that expression of IDX1/IPF1 during embryonic development occurs in the CNS as well as in the pancreas (24.Perez-Villamil B. Schwartz P. Vallejo M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3857-3860Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the present study, we provide evidence that the somatostatin gene is a target for regulation by IDX1/IPF1 in neural cells and that neural expression of IDX1/IPF1 is spatially and temporally regulated during CNS development. Thus, our data reinforce the notion that the transcriptional functions of IDX1/IPF1 are broader than previously anticipated, as they indicate the likelihood that IDX1/IPF1 plays a role in neural development. Developing brains from rat embryos removed at different gestation times from timed-pregnant Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were dissected under the microscope, and the meningeal membranes were carefully removed. Brains of embryonic day 16 (E16) and E19 embryos were further dissected into two parts by a transverse section made at the level of the caudal edge of the cerebral cortex. The piece rostral to this cut was labeled as forebrain, and the piece caudal to this cut was labeled as hindbrain. In addition, brains were removed from adult rats, and several brain regions were dissected as described (25.Vallejo M. Carter D.A. Biswas S. Lightman S.L. Neurosci. Lett. 1987; 73: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Total RNA (10 μg) from individual samples was incubated with (dT)15 and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase to synthesize cDNA. For PCR amplification of IDX1/IPF1, two different sets of primers were used in independent experiments, yielding identical results. In the first set, a forward primer that corresponds to nucleotides 90–117 (5′-CGGCTGCAACCATGGATAGTGAGGAGCAG-3′) and a reverse primer that anneals to nucleotides 280–296 (5′-AAGTCCCCCGGACATCT-3′) of the published cDNA (6.Miller C.P. McGehee R.E. Habener J.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1145-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) were used. In the second set, a forward primer that corresponds to nucleotides 96–118 (5′-CCACCATGAATAGTGAGGAGCA-3′) and a reverse primer that anneals to nucleotides 305–322 (5′-GGCGAGCGGGGGCACTTC-3′) were used. In both cases, PCR conditions were as follows: 98 °C for 1 min; 30 cycles of 96 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s, and 75 °C for 1 min; and a 5-min incubation at 75 °C. After PCR, an aliquot of the reaction was resolved in a 1% agarose gel, blotted onto a nylon membrane, probed with a 32P-labeled internal primer that anneals to nucleotides 216–236 (5′-GCCGCCAGCCCCCACCTCCGC-3′), and autoradiographed at −70 °C. Primers for PCR amplification of Emx-1 and Dlx-2 were designed based on the published sequences of the rat cDNAs (26.Robel L. Ding M. James A.J. Lin X. Simeone A. Leckman J.F. Vaccarino F.M. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 7879-7891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Emx-1 forward primer (nucleotides 10–31) was 5′-CCTGGCTGGCTGGGTGCACACC-3′, and the reverse primer (nucleotides 278–289) was 5′-CCACTCACGAAGGCCGCCTCG-3′. PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 5 min; 30 cycles of 96 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 75 °C for 1 min; and a 5-min incubation at 75 °C. As a probe to detect the PCR product after blotting onto nylon, the following32P-labeled internal primer was used: 5′-CACTCCTCTTCGGCGGCAGCG-3′. The Dlx-2 forward primer (nucleotides 1–23) was 5′-ACAGCCATGTCTGCTTAGACCAG-3′, and the reverse primer (nucleotides 298–321) was 5′-TTCACGCCGTGATACTGATACTGG-3′. PCR conditions were as follows: 98 °C for 1 min; 30 cycles of 96 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 75 °C for 1 min; and a 5-min incubation at 75 °C. The 32P-labeled internal primer used as a probe to detect the PCR product was 5′-ACTTCCAAGCTCCGTTCCCGA-3′. For PCR amplification of actin, the primers used were as follows: forward, 5′-GACGATATGGAGAAGATTTGGCA-3′, which anneals to exon 2; reverse, 5′-CCATCTCTTGCTCGAAGTCTAGG-3′, which anneals to exon 3. The following protocol was used: 94 °C for 5 min; 20 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s; and a 5-min incubation at 72 °C. As a probe to detect the PCR product after blotting onto nitrocellulose, the following32P-labeled internal primer was used: 5′-CACACGCAGCTCATTGTAGAAAGT-3′. In all cases, controls were carried out in which samples were treated with RNase A prior to cDNA synthesis to rule out genomic DNA contamination. In preliminary experiments, different numbers of PCR cycles were tested to ensure that the resulting signal in most samples does not increase to saturation. Brain samples or cell lines were lysed in buffer containing 125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 15% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mmdithiothreitol. Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoreactivity was detected with the α253 antiserum (1:10,000 dilution) (3.Stoffers D.A.

Rat fetuses of different ages were removed from timed-pregnant Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats and fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde. After fixation, they were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, transferred to phosphate-buffered saline containing 20% sucrose, and kept at 4 °C for at least 24 h. Sagittal cryostat sections (10 μm) were cut and kept at −80 °C until used. Sections were brought to room temperature, permeabilized with methanol for 2 min at −20 °C, treated with 5% normal goat serum, and then incubated overnight with the α253 anti-IDX1/IPF1 antiserum (1:1500 dilution) at 37 °C. Immunodetection was carried out with a secondary biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antiserum (Bio-Rad) using nickel-intensified immunoperoxidase staining with a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Two-color dual antigen immunostaining was carried out serially as described (32.Moratalla R. Elibol B. Vallejo M. Graybiel A.M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 147-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). First, somatostatin was detected with a specific monoclonal rat antiserum (33.Kowall N.W. Ferrante R.J.

Sections were then washed, and IDX1/IPF1 immunohistochemistry proceeded as described above, using immunoperoxidase staining without nickel ammonium, yielding a brown color. Three regions of the rat brain (cortex, hippocampus, and hypothalamus/thalamus) were dissected essentially as described (25.Vallejo M. Carter D.A. Biswas S. Lightman S.L. Neurosci. Lett. 1987; 73: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 34.Glowinski J. Iversen L.L. J. Neurochem. 1966; 13: 655-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (5032) Google Scholar), with the exceptions that only parietal cortex was taken and that the hypothalamus/thalamus was dissected as a single block of tissue. Total RNA (10 μg) purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation from each one of these regions was primed with (dT)15 and incubated with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to synthesize cDNA. One-tenth of this cDNA preparation was used for PCR, using degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to conserved residues found in helices 1 and 3 of Hox-like homeodomains. A control sample that lacked RNA was processed in parallel. The resulting PCR products were ligated into pBluescript (KS) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA); after transforming Escherichia coli JM109, 25–30 individual colonies corresponding to each brain region were randomly picked, and plasmid minipreps were prepared and sequenced using the dideoxy chain termination method (Sequenase kit, United States Biochemicals, Cleveland, OH). The degenerate oligonucleotide sequences, PCR conditions, and subcloning procedure were exactly as described (6.Miller C.P. McGehee R.E. Habener J.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1145-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 35.James R. Kazenwadel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3246-3251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequences were compared with those in the GenBankTM data base by using the BLAST Network Service provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information. To confirm that IDX1/IPF1 is expressed in the brain, we carried out RT-PCR/Southern blot hybridization analysis with specific primers to IDX1/IPF1, using embryonic as well as adult rat brains. As a control to monitor developmental changes in homeodomain gene expression, we determined, in parallel experiments using the same template for RT-PCRs, the expression of Emx-1 and Dlx-2, two homeodomain genes known to be expressed restrictively in telencephalic areas of the developing brain (18.Anderson S.A.

As expected, Emx-1 and Dlx-2 transcripts were present in the brains of E14 and E15 rats, enriched in the forebrain relative to the hindbrain (Fig.1, E16 and E19). We found that IDX1/IPF1 transcripts are present in the brains of E14 and E15 rats (Fig. 1). In contrast to Emx-1 and Dlx-2, there was no difference in the levels of expression of IDX1/IPF1 between forebrain and hindbrain at E16. Finally, at E19, expression of Emx-1 and Dlx-2 was robust and restricted to the forebrain, but IDX1/IPF1 levels had decreased both in the forebrain and in the hindbrain (Fig. 1). In the adult brain, IDX1/IPF1 transcripts appeared to be of relatively low abundance in most regions examined, with the exception of the cerebellum (Fig. 1). As expected, Emx-1 and Dlx-2 were found to be preferentially expressed in telencephalic areas (hippocampus, striatum, and cortex) (Fig. 1). Immunochemical detection of IDX1/IPF1 protein in neural cells was carried out initially by Western immunoblotting using an antiserum (α253) that recognizes specifically the C-terminal 12 amino acids of IDX1/IPF1 (3.Stoffers D.A. Zinkin N.T. Stanojevic V. Clarke W.L. Habener J.F. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 27.Stoffers D.A. Stanojevic V. Habener J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 232-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Western immunoblot analysis confirmed that this antiserum recognizes both IDX1/IPF1 synthesized in vitro, and IDX1/IPF1 constitutively expressed in pancreatic islet-derived RIN-1027-B2 cells (Fig. 2), a cell line from which IDX1/IPF1 was originally cloned (6.Miller C.P. McGehee R.E. Habener J.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1145-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In addition, we detected immunoreactive IDX1/IPF1 in nuclear extracts of E15 and E17 rat brains, as well as in nuclear extracts of RC2.E10 cells (Fig. 2), a neural precursor cell line derived from rat embryonic cortex (28.Schwartz P.T. Vallejo M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1297-1310Google Scholar,73.McManus M. Chen L.-C. Vallejo I. Vallejo M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9004-9015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The finding of IDX1/IPF1 in RC2.E10 cells, which express the somatostatin gene in a neural-specific manner (28.Schwartz P.T. Vallejo M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1297-1310Google Scholar), prompted us to explore the possibility that IDX1/IPF1 regulates somatostatin gene expression in neural cells. The promoter region of the somatostatin gene contains at least four homeodomain-binding DNA regulatory elements with a common TAAT core motif, named SMS-UE-B, SMS-TAAT1, SMS-TAAT2, and SMS-TAAT3, some of which appear to act as targets for regulation of somatostatin gene expression by IDX1/IPF1 in pancreatic cells (5.Leonard J. Peers B. Johnson T. Ferreri K. Lee S. Montminy M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1275-1283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Miller C.P. McGehee R.E. Habener J.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1145-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar,28.Schwartz P.T. Vallejo M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1297-1310Google Scholar, 30.Vallejo M. Penchuk L. Habener J.F. J. Biol.

Biol. 1995; 15: 7091-7097Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We sought to investigate whether IDX1/IPF1 expressed in developing neural tissue is able to bind to these elements. Initially, we determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assays that nuclear extracts prepared from embryonic rat brains contain proteins that recognize synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to these TAAT sites. Several specific DNA-protein complexes, distributed in three different clusters of slow (cluster 1), medium (cluster 2), and fast (cluster 3) relative electrophoretic mobility, were found to bind to SMS-TAAT1 (Fig. 3 A). No appreciable differences were observed between brain nuclear extracts prepared from E14 or E16 embryos (Fig. 3 A). A similar pattern was found when the SMS-TAAT2 probe was used, with the exception that the bands corresponding to complex 1 were not detected (Fig.3 B). When the SMS-TAAT3 probe was used, only two major protein-DNA complexes with relatively slow electrophoretic migration were detected in brain nuclear extracts from E14 or E16 embryos (Fig. 3 C). Finally, two complexes were found to bind to SMS-UE-B in brain nuclear extracts from E14 embryos, but only one was detected when brain nuclear extracts were prepared from E16 embryos (Fig. 3 D). To investigate whether any of the complexes observed with embryonic brain nuclear extracts contain IDX1/IPF1, we carried out electrophoretic mobility shift assays in the presence of the α253 antiserum or in the presence of a different anti-IDX1/IPF1 antiserum (α251), which specifically recognizes the N-terminal 12 amino acids of IDX1/IPF1 (3.Stoffers D.A. Zinkin N.T. Stanojevic V. Clarke W.L. Habener J.F. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 27.Stoffers D.A. Stanojevic V. Habener J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 232-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The addition of either of these antisera to the binding reaction did not disturb the protein complexes bound to SMS-TAAT1 and SMS-TAAT2 (not shown). However, we found that the presence of either of these antisera in the binding reaction results in the disappearance of the upper band detected with the SMS-TAAT3 (Fig.4 A) or with the SMS-UE-B probes (Fig. 4 B). Similar results were obtained when nuclear extracts from neural RC2.E10 cells, which express the somatostatin gene (28.Schwartz P.T. Vallejo M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1297-1310Google Scholar), were used (not shown). Thus, these experiments identify IDX1/IPF1 as a homeodomain transcription factor that binds somatostatin gene regulatory elements in neural cells. We carried out transient transfection experiments to evaluate the transactivational activity of IDX1/IPF1 on the somatostatin gene. First, we confirmed that transfection of RC2.E10 cells with pBJ5-IDX-1 (6.Miller C.P. McGehee R.E. Habener J.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1145-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), an expression plasmid encoding IDX1/IPF1, results in elevated levels of IDX1/IPF1 expression (Fig.5 A). We then cotransfected increasing amounts of the pBJ5-IDX-1 plasmid with a fixed amount of plasmid SMS900, a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter plasmid that contains a fragment of the somatostatin gene spanning nucleotides −900 to +54 (40.Vallejo M. Miller C.P. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12868-12875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of SMS900 after transient transfections in RC2.E10 cells has been characterized previously (28.Schwartz P.T. Vallejo M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1297-1310Google Scholar). Cotransfection of pBJ5-IDX-1 and SMS900 resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in the levels of CAT activity (Fig. 5 C). To determine whether any of the TAAT-containing elements of the somatostatin gene promoter are important for IDX1/IPF1 transactivation in neural cells, we carried out another series of transient cotransfection experiments in RC2.E10 cells, using mutant SMS900 plasmids in which each one of the TAAT motifs had been altered by site-directed mutagenesis in such a way that binding of nuclear proteins is impaired (28.Schwartz P.T. Vallejo M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1297-1310Google Scholar). Disruption of either SMS-TAAT1 or SMS-TAAT2 (Fig. 5 D), or of both elements together (not shown), did not alter the transactivation activity of IDX1/IPF1. However, disruption of either SMS-TAAT3 or SMS-UE-B independently inhibited the increase in the levels of CAT activity elicited by cotransfection with pBJ5-IDX-1 (Fig.5 D), indicating that the integrity of these elements is required for the transactivation of the somatostatin gene by IDX1/IPF1 in neural cells. To gain information on the regional distribution of cells expressing IDX1/IPF1 in the developing CNS, we carried out immunohistochemistry on sagittal sections of rat embryos. As expected, we observed IDX1/IPF1 immunoreactivity in the duodenum and pancreatic mesenchyme (not shown). In the developing CNS, we found IDX1/IPF1 expressed in several regions. In the telencephalon, cells with IDX1/IPF1 immunopositive nuclei were readily detectable throughout the depth of the neocortical neuroepithelium of E14 and E15 embryos (Fig.6 A). At E15, a higher density of cells was often found clustering in the subventricular zone (Fig.6 A). The intensity of immunostaining and relative number of immunopositive cells decreased at E16. In the neocortical epithelium of these embryos, IDX1/IPF1-positive cells were restricted to the ventricular and subventricular zones; by E17, IDX1/IPF1 immunoreactivity in the neocortex was practically undetectable (Fig.6 A), and positive nuclei were observed only occasionally. IDX1/IPF1 was also found expressed in the archicortex, which corresponds to the hippocampal primordium (Fig. 6 B), as well as in the germinative layers of the medial and lateral ganglionic eminence corresponding to the striato-pallidal primordium that generates the basal ganglia (Fig. 6 B). However, at E17, IDX1/IPF1 expression in the hippocampus and basal ganglia was undetectable (not shown). IDX1/IPF1 immunoreactivity was also found in periventricular areas of the hypothalamus of E14 and E15 embryos, in scattered cells surrounding the optic, mammillary, and infundibular recesses (not shown), and in the anterior hypothalamic neuroepithelium and the tuberal hypothalamus, where the highest density of cells with immunopositive nu"

To discover proteins that associate with hsp27, we made a differentiated rat Sertoli cell cDNA expression library and screened it using the yeast two-hybrid system. We obtained a cDNA coding for a novel protein of 428 amino acids that we have named PASS1 (proteinassociated with small stress proteins 1). BLAST searches did not reveal major similarity of PASS1 to any known protein, but the cDNA sequence matched several mouse EST clones and shares 34% homology with aCaenorhabditis elegans genomic sequence. In vitro, bacterially expressed glutathioneS-transferase-PASS1 fusion protein bound to hsp27, and hsp27 was co-immunoprecipitated with c-Myc-tagged PASS1 overexpressed in several cell lines. The region of PASS1 responsible for association with hsp27 was identified as existing predominantly between amino acids 108 and 208 of PASS1. Northern hybridization and Western blot analysis demonstrated that PASS1 is expressed in several tissues, with the highest expression occurring in testis, primarily in Sertoli cells. The presence of a 1.4-kilobase PASS1 mRNA in kidney as well as the 1.8-kilobase mRNA seen in other tissues suggests that alternate splicing may occur in this organ. Ectopic expression of PASS1 in two cultured cell lines was observed to inhibit the ability of hsp27 to protect cells against heat shock, indicating that PASS1 does interact with hsp27 in the live cell. hsp27 is involved in development of tolerance to stress, possibly by its involvement in molecular chaperoning, maintenance of glutathione status, and/or modulation of microfilament structure and function.

In response to toxic conditions, or stress, cells increase the synthesis of heat shock proteins, including hsp27, and coincidentally become more stress-resistant. Elevated levels of hsp27 have been shown to be coincident with elevated resistance to many types of stress, including elevated temperature, toxic metals, drugs, and oxidants (9.Landry J. Chrétien P.

These proposed hypotheses are that hsp27 has chaperone-like activity (15.Merck K.B. Horwitz J. Kersten M. Overkamp P. Gaestel M. Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1993; 18: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 16.Buchner J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 17.Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), that hsp27 stabilizes microfilaments (see 8), and that expression of hsp27 enhances cellular glutathione levels (18.Mehlen P. Kretz-Remy C. Preville X. Arrigo A.-P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2695-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 19.Mehlen P. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Arrigo A.-P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). hsp27 is believed to exist in cells primarily as oligomers of as many as 8–40 hsp27 protein monomers. It is the large oligomers that permit denatured proteins to regain some of their enzymatic activity in vitro (17.Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), suggesting that large oligomers of hsp27 have a chaperone-like activity by serving as a site where unfolding proteins may bind (by doing so, the proteins will not irreversibly aggregate) until ATP and hsp70-dependent refolding can occur (17.Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). αB-crystallin has also been shown to have a chaperone-like activityin vitro (20.Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that hsp27 regulates microfilament organization, in a manner dependent on its phosphorylation and oligomeric status. Hsp27 inhibits actin polymerization in vitro (21.Miron T. Vancompernolle K. Vandekerckhove J. Wilchek M. Geiger B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). This ability of hsp27 to inhibit actin polymerization appears to be regulated by its phosphorylation status, because only the nonphosphorylated lower molecular weight forms of hsp27 were determined to bind actin barbed ends and inhibit polymerization (22.Benndorf R. Hayess K. Ryazantsev S. Wieske M. Behlke J. Lutsch G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20780-20784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Severalin vivo studies suggest an interaction between expression and phosphorylation of hsp27 and the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. In cell lines transfected to overexpress hsp27, cortical actin arrays were increased, as was pinocytotic activity (23.Lavoie J.N. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24210-24214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Microfilaments in cells transfected to overexpress hsp27 are more stable to heat shock, oxidative stress, or treatment with cytochalasin D than are microfilaments in parental cells (11.Lavoie J.N. Gingras-Breton G. Tanguay R.M. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3420-3429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Lavoie J.N. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1995; 15: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with an hsp27 antisense construct were seen to have a drastic reduction in microfilament arrays (25.Mairesse N. Horman S. Mosselmans R. Galand P. Cell Biol. Int. 1996; 20: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Increased microfilament stability was not observed in cell lines transfected with mutant hsp27 incapable of being phosphorylated (serine residues had been replaced with glycine residues) (24.Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Migration was reduced in endothelial cells that had been transfected with this mutant form of hsp27, while in cells transfected with wild type hsp27 migration was enhanced (26.Piotrowicz R.S. Hickey E. Levin E.G. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1481-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this mutant form of hsp27 is not only incapable of being phosphorylated, but it also does not form high molecular weight oligomers (19.Mehlen P. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Arrigo A.-P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The third mechanism by which hsp27 may protect cells is by enhancing cellular glutathione levels. Elevated glutathione levels have been measured in cells overexpressing hsp27, while cells underexpressing hsp27 contained less glutathione (19.Mehlen P. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Arrigo A.-P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). When cells overexpressing hsp27 were treated with buthionine-S-sulfoximine (to deplete cellular glutathione stores), the protective effect of hsp27 was abolished, so that hsp27 can apparently protect cells only when glutathione is present. Transfection of cells with wild-type and mutant forms of hsp27 in which the serine phosphorylation sites were mutated to alanines (3A), glycines (3G), or aspartates (3D) demonstrated that the effect of hsp27 on cellular glutathione levels depended on the oligomerization of hsp27, with only the large oligomeric forms of hsp27 being able to protect cells by enhancing glutathione levels (19.Mehlen P. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Arrigo A.-P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Expression of hsp27 also correlates with growth and differentiation in the developmental processes (reviewed in Ref. 8.Arrigo A.-P. Landry J. Morimoto R. Tissieres A. Georgopolos C. Heat Shock Proteins: Structure, Function and Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 335-373Google Scholar). For example, the accumulation of hsp27 in muscle tissues and certain neuronal cells during murine development has been observed (27.Gernold M. Knauf U. Gaestel M. Stahl J. Kloetzel P.M. Dev. Genet. 1993; 14: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 28.Walsh M.T. Li K. Crowther C. Marsh D. Edwards M. Hightower L. Nover L. Heat Shock and Development. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1991: 58-70Google Scholar). Interestingly, hsp27 seemed to be associated with reduced growth or proliferation and increased differentiation state in mammalian cells, such as murine Ehrlich ascites tumor cells (29.Benndorf R.

Unfortunately, no precise mechanism has been proposed, much less demonstrated, to explain how hsp27 may participate in all of the activities suggested. We have hypothesized that hsp27 may participate in differing cellular functions as a consequence of association with different specific binding protein partners. For example, the localization of hsp27 with microfilaments in some cell types but not others might be a consequence of the expression in some cells,e.g. muscle and Sertoli cells, of as yet unknown proteins that specifically bind to both hsp27 and microfilaments or a microfilament-associated protein. More generally, we further hypothesized that the various functions suggested for hsp27 and the other members of the small stress protein family may depend on the existence of different proteins that interact with the small stress proteins and mediate different events. Thus, by identifying proteins associating with small stress proteins, functions of hsp27 may be elucidated, and mechanisms may be understood. Previously, hsp27 has been reported to associate with the mammalian transglutaminase, platelet factor XIII (37.Zhu Y. Tassi L. Lane W. Mendelsohn M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22379-22384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to aDrosophila nuclear ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (38.Joanisse D.R. Inaguma Y. Tanguay R.M. Biochem. Biophys Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Here we report the molecular cloning of a novel binding protein we have termed PASS1 (protein associated withsmall stress proteins 1). PASS1 was isolated from a rat Sertoli cell cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid system and biochemically shown to interact specifically with mammalian hsp27. Additionally, we demonstrate that PASS1 expression affects the ability of hsp27 to protect cells against heat shock. Sertoli cells were isolated from testes of 27-day-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats and were cultured for 3 days as described previously (39.Pittenger G.L. Gilmont R.R. Welsh M.J. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3207-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Sertoli cells were harvested by scraping from culture dishes, and RNA was isolated using TRIZOL (Life Technology), as described by the manufacturer. Poly(A+) RNA was isolated by oligo(dT) affinity chromatography (40.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). A cDNA library was then made using the Zap-cDNA Synthesis Kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, first strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcriptase from 5 μg of Sertoli cell poly(A) mRNA with 5-methyl-dCTP and the other dNTPs. The primer used was an oligo(dT) linker-primer containing anXhoI site. In a control tube, [32P]dATP was used to monitor the efficiency of the synthesis. After the second strand was synthesized using RNase-H/DNA polymerase I with [32P]dATP and the other three dNTPs, the cDNA termini were blunted by Pfu DNA polymerase so that anEcoRI adapter could be ligated to the blunt ends. Following treatment of the cDNA with T4 polynucleotide kinase, anXhoI digestion created an EcoRI–XhoI cDNA mixture. A Sephacryl S-400 spin column was used to purify and select the cDNA of 600 base pairs and larger, as determined by alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis. The purified cDNA (100 ng) was ligated into 1 μg of the gel-purified vector pACT II arms (41.Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar) at 12 °C for 2 days. The ligation mixture was packaged using the Gigapack II Gold packaging extract (Stratagene). Aftercre-lox conversion, plasmid preparation was performed using Mega Plasmid Kit (Qiagen). The screening was performed by transforming the cDNA library DNA into a host yeast strain (Y190) transformed with the bait plasmid pGal4BD-hsp27, expressing hsp27 fused with Gal4-BD (binding domain). Positive clones were obtained with nutrition deficiency (Trp, Leu, His) selection and the reporter gene expression assay (β-galactosidase lift assay). Prey vectors (pACT II), containing the Gal4-AD (activation domain) fusion genes, were isolated from these clones following standard protocol after eliminating the pGal4BD-hsp27 plasmid. The plasmid pGal4AD-PASS1 was recovered from one of the positive clones. As control, PASS1 was further tested negative for interaction with γ-interferon, CD40 receptor, and a random frameshifted protein in the yeast two-hybrid system. The bait construct, pGal4BD-hsp27, used in the two-hybrid system, was created by ligating a 757-base pairSmaI–SalI fragment from a rat hsp27 cDNA (GenBankTM accession no. M86389) into plasmid pAS1-CYH2 to create an intermediate plasmid, pAS-HSPM. Then pAS-HSPM was made in frame by SmaI–NdeI digestion, followed by filling with dATP and dTTP, and then a religation. The subcloning was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The rat hsp27 expression vector, pcDNA-hsp27, was described previously (14.Wu W. Welsh M.J. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 141: 330-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The αB-crystallin expression plasmid, pcDNA-crystB, was constructed by subcloning a complete rat αB-crystallin cDNA sequence into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) atEcoRI–XhoI sites. For expression of PASS1 as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein, a 1.5-kb PASS1 cDNA fragment containing the complete coding region of PASS1 protein was cut with BamHI–XhoI from the cloning construct pGal4AD-PASS1. The fragment was then subcloned into pGex-5x-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the resulting construct was designated pGEX-PASS1. For constructing a c-Myc-tagged PASS1 expression plasmid, a modified prk5 vector designated prk5Myc, containing coding sequence for c-Myc peptide (EQKLISEEDL), was used and fused in theBamHI–HindIII site, with the coding sequence of PASS1 derived from pGal4AD-PASS1. The fusion-expression vector was designated prkPASS1. Removing the 3′-end sequence of PASS1 cDNA to the BglII, SmaI, EcoRI, andXbaI sites, respectively, generated four serial C-terminal truncated versions of prkPASS1. The corresponding plasmids prkPASS1Δct1, prkPASS1Δct2, prkPASS1Δct3, and prkPASS1Δct4, each containing PASS1 inserts of 1.155, 0.843, 0.624, and 0.324 kb, respectively, were obtained. Two N-terminal truncated PASS1 constructs were made as follows. Cloning a 1.020-kb PCR fragment from PASS1 into prk5Myc generated prkPASS1Δnt1, and prkPASS1Δnt2, containing a 0.627-kb insert, was obtained by removing the 5′ EcoRI fragment from prkPASS1. To generate the green fluorescent protein-expressing fusion construct, designated pGFP-PASS1, the full coding region of PASS1 was subcloned into pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH) in the BglII–XhoI sites. DNA sequencing was performed to confirm the sequence accuracy of all subcloned constructs. PCR was performed using a GeneAmp 2400 PCR System (Perkin-Elmer) with 30 cycles, at different temperatures for denaturing (96 °C), annealing (55–60 °C), and extension (72 °C) for various times (30 s to 2 min), with Expand High-Fidelity enzymes (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). RACE-PCR was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Monkey COS cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 1 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum. Human 293T cells were cultured in the DMEM supplemented with nonessential amino acids. NIH/3T3 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5% calf serum. Cells were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Culture medium and serum were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Transient transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 24 h prior to transfection, 5 × 104 cells were plated onto each well of six-well plates, with 1 μg of each construct used per well. Total DNA was adjusted to the same concentration for all treatments. Cells were harvested or processed for further treatments 48 h after transfection. Total RNA was prepared from whole testis or primary culture of rat Sertoli cells (39.Pittenger G.L. Gilmont R.R. Welsh M.J. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3207-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with TRIZOL (Life Technologies, Inc.), and poly(A+)-RNA was prepared from the total RNA (40.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). For Northern blotting, a rat multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) was used, or 2 μg of poly(A+)-RNA was run on a 1% agarose gel and transferred onto a nylon membrane. The probe, a gel-purified 1-kbBamHI–HindIII fragment from plasmid pAD-PASS1, was labeled with [32P]dCTP in a random primer reaction (kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Northern blots were prehybridized for 2 h at 42 °C in a solution containing 0.5% SDS, 400 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 50% formamide. The labeled probe was added to the mixture, and hybridization was allowed to proceed for 18 h. After hybridization, blots were washed in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS two times for 30 min at 42 °C. These washes were followed by three 20-min high stringency washes in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C, after which the blot was covered in plastic wrap and exposed to XAR-5 x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) using a Kodak Lanex enhancer screen. Bacterial strain BL21 (Stratagene) was used to produce GST fusion proteins. Briefly, an overnight culture was diluted 10-fold and allowed to continue growth until the optical density at a wavelength of 600 nm reached 1.0 before the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.2 mm for induction of the fusion protein. Cells were harvested after another 4 h of incubation. After lysis of bacterial cells by French press, cell supernatants were batch affinity-purified using glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). Fusion proteins were eluted from the beads using a buffer containing reduced glutathione and were subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The pull-down assay was performed as follows. Total protein extracts from rat kidneys prepared in Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40) were incubated for 2 h with bead-immobilized GST alone or GST-PASS1 at 4 °C. The beads were washed extensively with PBS to remove any proteins that would not bind to GST or PASS1. The column was then washed with PBS containing reduced glutathione (10 mm) to elute proteins binding to the column. Eluted proteins were subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. An adult male laboratory rat (about 200 g) was sacrificed, and the organs to be studied were immediately removed and processed for protein extraction. About 200 mg each of the more dense tissues (heart, skeletal muscle) were ground under liquid nitrogen using a precooled mortar and pestle. After evaporation of liquid nitrogen, the remaining frozen tissue powder was transferred into a Dounce tissue grinder and homogenized with 300 μl of extraction solution (3% SDS, 68.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 pill/20 ml of protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at room temperature. For disintegration of the more fragile tissues (brain, spleen, lung, liver, cortex of the kidney, testis), about 100 mg of each was directly homogenized in the Dounce tissue grinder with 300 μl of the extraction solution. After centrifugation (5 min at 18,000 ×g; room temperature) the supernatants were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −140 °C. For protein determination, aliquots of the supernatants were diluted 1:10 with water, and the protein contents were determined with the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad), which tolerates all of the added components, following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were rinsed three times with ice-cold PBS buffer. Then they were lysed using a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100 supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The lysate supernatant fluids were incubated with the indicated antibodies on ice for 2 h. Protein A-agarose beads (25 μl; Sigma) were then added to the mixture for another hour at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer before being resuspended in sample loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.) by a semidry transfer method (42.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). Blots were blocked with 5% dry milk in PBST (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20), treated with appropriate primary antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Protein detection was performed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sometimes membranes were stripped and reprobed, following protocols also recommended by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Developed films were scanned into files using a GS 200 Imaging Densitometer (Bio-Rad) and analyzed by the accompanying software, Molecular Analyst (Bio-Rad). A peptide sequence (SRISGPFKKYDHSKFWA) derived from PASS1 was selected as an antigen based on its antigenic index and hydrophilicity properties as determined by MacVector (Oxford Molecular Group). The peptide was synthesized with a T cell epitope from botulinum toxin (RAHYNIVTF) (43.Feltkamp M.C. Smits H.L. Vierboom M.P. Minnaar R.P. de Jongh B.M. Drijfhout J.W. ter Schegget J. Melief C.J.

Immunol. 1993; 23: 2242-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar) coupled to multiple antigenic peptide by the University of Michigan Protein and Carbohydrate Structure Facility. Antigen was injected into sheep for raising an anti-PASS1 antiserum designated MJW22. For affinity chromatography purification of MJW22 serum, a column composed of the PASS1-derived peptide coupled to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) was made, following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The resulting antibody recognized PASS1 as judged from the pronounced band at the apparent molecular mass of approximately 64 kDa obtained after transfection of COS cells with PASS1-pcDNA3.1 (cf. Fig. 4 C). In COS cells, this antibody did not cross-react with any other protein, indicating a sufficient specificity. However, it had a certain nonspecific cross-reactivity with other proteins with lower apparent molecular masses when rat tissues were analyzed (not shown). The identity of the labeled proteins is not known. Monoclonal antibody against hsp27 (anti-hsp27) was described previously (44.Bitar K.N. Kaminski M.S. Hailat N. Cease K.B. Strahler J.R. Biochem.

Reprod. 1996; 55: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Rabbit antisera against human and murine/rat hsp27 were purchased from StressGen. The specific antibody against αB-crystallin (anti-αB-crystallin) was also purchased from StressGen. Myc monoclonal 9E10 (anti-Myc) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated 9E10 antibody were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody preabsorbed with Fc and anti-rabbit horseradish-conjugated peroxidase secondary antibody were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. 24 h prior to transfection, 5 × 104NIH/3T3 cells were plated into six-well plates (Falcon). Transfection was performed as described above using either the control vectors pcDNA3.1 and prk5Myc, pcDNA3.1-hsp27 alone, or pcDNA3.1-hsp27 and prkPASS1 together (1"

In terms of discoidal HDL particles, there has been a debate as to the orientation of the apoA-I α-helices around the disc edge. The “picket fence” model states that the α-helical repeats, separated by turns, are arranged parallel to the phospholipid acyl chains of the enclosed lipid bilayer. On the other hand, the “belt” model states that the helical segments run perpendicular to the acyl chains. To distinguish between these models, we used nitroxide spin labels present at various depths in the bilayer of reconstituted HDL (rHDL) to measure the position of Trp residues in single Trp mutants of human proapoA-I. Two mutants were studied; the first contained a Trp at position 108, which was located near the center of helix 4. The second contained a Trp at position 115, two turns along the same helix. The picket fence model predicts that these Trp residues should be at different depths in the bilayer, whereas the belt model predicts that they should be at similar depths. Different sized rHDL particles were produced that contained 2, 3, and >4 molecules of proapoA-I per complex. In each case, parallax analysis indicated that Trp-108 and Trp-115 were present at similar depths of about 6 Å from the center of the bilayer, consistent with helix 4 being oriented perpendicular to the acyl chains (in agreement with the belt model). Similar experiments showed that control transmembrane peptides were oriented parallel to the acyl chains in vesicles, demonstrating that the method was capable of distinguishing between the two models. This study provides one of the first experimental measurements of the location of an apoA-I helix with respect to the bilayer edge.

Wisdom C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1972; 41: 703-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), little progress has been made in defining the detailed mechanisms underlying its well known protection against coronary artery disease. HDL and apoA-I are thought to be critical for the uptake of cellular cholesterol in the periphery and, after interactions with numerous plasma factors, for its delivery to the liver and adrenals for bile acid and steroid hormone synthesis, respectively. Arguably, the most prominent obstacle to a molecular understanding of these events is the lack of information on how the structure of apoA-I modulates HDL function. Most of our knowledge of apoA-I conformation was generated within the first few years of the publication of its primary structure (2.Baker H.N. Gotto A.M.J. Jackson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2725-2738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), largely from theoretical analysis of the amphipathic α-helical repeats in the sequence (3.McLachlan A.D. Nature. 1977; 267: 465-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 4.Segrest J.P. Jackson R.L. Morrisett J.D. Gotto A.M.J. FEBS Lett. 1974; 38: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism and infrared spectroscopy (IR) have shed light on the rough secondary structural contents of various forms of apoA-I (5.Lux S.E. Hirz R. Shrager R.I. Gotto A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2598-2606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Wald J.H. Coormaghtigh E. De Meutter J. Ruysschaert J.M. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20044-20050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but hard experimental evidence concerning the three-dimensional arrangement of these elements in the native protein is lacking. Recently, an x-ray crystal structure of a lipid-free fragment of apoA-I was reported (7.Borhani D.W. Rogers D.P. Engler J.A. Brouillette C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12291-12296Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The structure was a homotetramer of highly α-helical apoA-I molecules arranged in a ring with the monomers associating via the hydrophobic faces of their amphipathic α-helices. While the applicability of this structure to the native lipid-free forms of apoA-I is undetermined, this advance has rekindled an old debate on the structure of nascent, discoidal HDL particles. It is widely accepted that discoidal HDL particles reconstituted in vitro (rHDL) are composed of a patch of phospholipid/cholesterol bilayer stabilized at its edges by the amphipathic α-helices of apoA-I. Segrest et al. and others (8.Segrest J.P. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1977; 18: 7-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 9.Wlodawer A. Segrest J.P. Chung B.H. Chiovetti R.J. Weinstein J.N. FEBS Lett. 1979; 104: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) proposed early on that the α-helices were arranged around the circumference of the disc with the long axis of the helices perpendicular to the phospholipid (PL) acyl chains. This became known as the “belt” or “bicycle wheel” model. However, other investigators theorized that the 22 aa helical repeats were an ideal length to traverse the bilayer edge with the helices parallel to the acyl chains (10.Tall A.R. Small D.M. Deckelbaum R.J. Shipley G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4701-4711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This “picket fence” model has been favored in recent years because of supporting IR spectroscopy studies (6.Wald J.H. Coormaghtigh E. De Meutter J. Ruysschaert J.M. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20044-20050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Brasseur R. De Meutter J. Vanloo B. Goormaghtigh E. Ruysschaert J.M. Rosseneu M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1043: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and the model's superb ability to account for the experimentally observed size classes of apoA-I containing rHDL (12.Wald J.H. Krul E.S. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20037-20043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Borhani et al. (7.Borhani D.W. Rogers D.P. Engler J.A. Brouillette C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12291-12296Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) proposed that the ring shaped structure observed in their crystal was new evidence that the belt model may be correct. This view has been supported in recent months by methodologically updated IR experiments (13.Koppaka V. Silvestro L. Engler J.A. Brouillette C.G. Axelsen P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14541-14544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). A detailed computer analysis of the belt model has also been recently published (14.Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Klon A.E. Sheldahl C.J. Hellinger M. De Loof H. Harvey S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31755-31758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). To provide information on the three-dimensional structure of apoA-I, we have taken the approach of combining fluorescence spectroscopy with single Trp mutants of human proapoA-I. Our initial studies focused on lipid-free apoA-I (15.Davidson W.S. Arnvig-McQuire K. Kennedy A. Kosman J. Hazlett T. Jonas A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14387-14395Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, in light of the picket fenceversus belt model debate and the conflicting IR data, our current study utilized a simple strategy to distinguish between the two models in discoidal rHDL particles. We employed lipid-based quenching studies using rHDL reconstituted with the single Trp mutants and synthetic phospholipids containing nitroxide spin labels at various positions down the length of the fatty acyl chain. These labels can quench Trp residues in lipid interacting areas of proteins and are used in conjunction with a technique called the parallax analysis. This method has been used to accurately measure the depth of Trp penetration in transmembrane proteins (16.Ghosh A.K. Rukmini R. Chattopadhyay A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14291-14305Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 17.Abrams F.S. London E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10826-10831Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 18.Ren J.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6608-6616Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We have extended this analysis to the situation of apoA-I wrapping around a patch of lipid bilayer in rHDL particles. Our hypothesis was straight forward. If the picket fence model is correct, Trp residues at the center of a helical domain should be measured near the center of the bilayer in rHDL particles, whereas those near the ends of the domain should be considerably more shallow (see Figs. 1 and 2). If the belt model is correct, Trp residues should be measured at similar bilayer depths regardless of their location on the helix.Figure 2Predictions of Trp location with respect to the bilayer for the picket fence and belt models.

We believe this study provides one of the first measurements of the location of an apoA-I helix with respect to the bilayer edge. 1-Palmitoyl,2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC), the nitroxide spin probes 1-palmitoyl,2-stearoyl(X-DOXYL)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (where X = 5, 7, 10, 12, and 16), and 1-oleoyl,2-(12-NBD)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). The atomic phosphorus standard was obtained from Sigma. The single Trp synthetic peptides K2WL9AL9K2A and K2GL9WL9K2A were the generous gift of Dr. Erwin London at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3) was purchased from Pierce. All other reagents were analytical grade. Human proapoA-I (containing the 6-aa prosegment) was used in this study because of its high expression level in bacteria and the lack of structural or functional differences from mature plasma apoA-I (20.McGuire K.A. Davidson W.S. Jonas A. J. Lipid. Res. 1996; 37: 1519-1528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To generate single Trp mutants, each of the five naturally occurring Trp residues (positions −3, 8, 50, 72, and 108) in proapoA-I were converted to Phe. This yielded a mutant that contained no Trp residues ([email protected]φ). [email protected]φ was then used as a template to re-insert a Trp residue at position 108 ([email protected]) and, in a separate mutant, to convert Tyr-115 to a Trp ([email protected]). The site-directed mutagenesis was accomplished using either standard polymerase chain reaction-based techniques or the Quick-ChangeTM mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The sequence of each construct was verified on an Applied Biotechnology System DNA sequencer. The resulting constructs were ligated into the PET-30 vector (Novagen) directly downstream of a histidine tag (His tag) sequence and transfected into BL-21 (DE3) Escherichia coli cells. The overexpression of the mutant proapoA-I was performed using freshly transfected cells as described previously (15.Davidson W.S. Arnvig-McQuire K. Kennedy A. Kosman J. Hazlett T. Jonas A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14387-14395Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). After harvesting, the cells were resuspended in 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.15 m NaCl (standard Tris buffer, STB). The cells were lysed for 1 h at room temperature using B-PER lysis detergent (Pierce) at 4 ml of detergent solution for every 100 ml of bacterial cell culture. The soluble cell contents were applied to a His bind column (Novagen) and eluted according to manufacturer's instructions. The His-tagged proteins were dialyzed into 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.0, and lyophilized. Lyophilized proteins were solubilized in 3 m guanidine HCl, dialyzed into STB to make rHDL particles (see below). The His tag was then removed by cleavage with 0.5 unit of enterokinase per 250 μg of proapoA-I at 25 °C for 16 h. The intact proapoA-I containing rHDL particles were purified away from the enterokinase and the cleaved His tag by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 200 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column. Proteins prepared by this method were >95% pure as visualized by SDS electrophoresis stained with Coomassie Blue and the yields were about 5 mg of protein/100 ml of original culture. rHDL particles were prepared as described previously (21.Jonas A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 553-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) using POPC, mutant proapoA-I and spin-labeled phospholipids. All phospholipid stock solutions were assayed before the reconstitution by the phosphorus method of Sokoloff and Rothblat (22.Sokoloff L. Rothblat G.H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1974; 146: 1166-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Initial lipid to protein molar ratios were 85:15:1 (POPC:DOXYL-PSPC:proapoA-I) to isolate the 98- and 160-Å particles and 34:6:1 (POPC:DOXYL-PSPC:proapoA-I) to isolate the 78- and 90-Å particles. For each mutant, a set of particles was reconstituted without the spin-labeled phospholipids. The different particle sizes were isolated by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (23.Davidson W.S. Rodrigueza W.V. Lund-Katz S. Johnson W.J. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17106-17113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) to remove any unreacted protein and vesicular structures. To ensure that the gel filtration step did not change the concentration of quencher within the particles, we performed control experiments using rHDL preparations that contained 12-NBD-PC. The various DOXYL quenchers were able to quench this label identically whether in complexes studied prior to or after gel filtration chromatography. The phosphorus assay and the Markwell modification of the Lowry protein assay (24.Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5319) Google Scholar) determined the final lipid and protein concentrations. Particle hydrodynamic diameters were measured by gradient native polyacrylamide electrophoresis (23.Davidson W.S. Rodrigueza W.V. Lund-Katz S. Johnson W.J. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17106-17113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The number of apolipoprotein molecules per rHDL complex was determined by BS3cross-linking (25.Jonas A. Kezdy K.E. Wald J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4818-4824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The secondary structure content of the proapoA-I in the rHDL particles was estimated by circular dichroism at 222 nm (23.Davidson W.S. Rodrigueza W.V. Lund-Katz S. Johnson W.J. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17106-17113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) containing the transmembrane peptides were prepared as by Ren et al. (26.Ren J. Lew S. Wang J. London E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5905-5912Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). For all peptide experiments, the lipid to protein molar ratios were 68:12:1 (POPC:DOXYL-DSPC:peptide). The appropriate lipids in chloroform were dried under nitrogen for at least 2 h. The appropriate amount of peptide was applied to the lipids in a volume of 10 μl absolute ethanol. The lipid/peptide mixture was vortexed, incubated on ice for 10 min, and then diluted to 1 ml with filtered STB. The small amount of ethanol in the mixture has been shown not to interfere with the fluorescence characteristics of the sample (18.Ren J. Lew S. Wang Z. London E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10213-10220Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The final concentrations of lipid in the samples were 200 μm. Identical samples were made containing POPC SUV only (blank for fluorescence runs) and POPC SUV with peptide in the absence of spin label (for determination of F o). All fluorescence measurements were performed on a Photon Technology International Quantamaster spectrometer in photon counting mode. The emission and excitation band passes were 3.0 nm. The excitation wavelength for all Trp studies was 295 nm to minimize the contribution of tyrosine fluorescence in proapoA-I. The samples (in STB for all studies) were measured at 25 °C in a semimicro quartz cuvette. The emission spectra from 303 to 375 nm were corrected for the background fluorescence of either buffer alone (rHDL samples) or SUV alone in buffer (peptide samples). The spectra were not corrected for the spectral characteristics of the emission and excitation monochromators. The parallax method for determining the depth of penetration of a fluorophore into a lipid bilayer was derived by Chattopadhyay and London (27.Chattopadhyay A. London E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar) from classical relationships of static quenchers to randomly distributed fluorophores. The method depends on the differences in fluorescence intensities of the fluorophore in the presence of known concentrations of nitroxide quencher groups at known locations in a phospholipid acyl chain. Since quenching is a distance-dependent phenomena, the quenching ratio from two quenchers, one shallow and one deep in the membrane, are used calculate the relative depth of the fluorophore relative to the quenchers. The method was initially applied to lipid-based fluorescent groups that are exposed to quencher on all sides and both leaflets of the bilayer. The theory was later modified to allow for the quenching of Trp residues on transmembrane peptides (18.Ren J. Lew S. Wang Z. London E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10213-10220Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The distance of the Trp from the center of the bilayer (Z cf) is given by, Zcf=Lcs+[−ln(Fs/Fd)/πC−Lds2]/2LdsEquation 1 where F s is the fluorescence intensity in the presence of the shallow quencher, F d is the same for the deep quencher, L cs is the distance from the center of the bilayer to the shallow quencher,L ds is the distance between the shallow and deep quenchers, and C is the concentration of the quencher molecules per Å2. Equation 1 holds when the Trp residue is quenched by nitroxide groups in the same leaflet of the membrane as the Trp. However, in the case where the Trp is deeply buried within the membrane, it is subjected to quenching from groups in the opposing leaflet of the membrane as well. For this situation, a second relationship is required to account for trans-bilayer quenching, Zcf=Lcd−[ln((FS/Fo) 2/(Fd/Fo))/πC)−2Lds2+4Lcd2)/4(Lds+Lcd)]Equation 2 where F o is the fluorescence intensity in the absence of quencher, L cd is the distance from the center of the bilayer to the deep quencher, andL ds is the distance between the shallow and deep quenchers. For a detailed discussion and the derivation of these equations, see Refs. 18.Ren J. Lew S. Wang Z. London E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10213-10220Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar and 33.Ladokhin A.S. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 946-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar. Equation 2 was used in this study whenever a Trp residue was determined to be <5 Å from the center of the membrane by Equation 1. These equations have been demonstrated to accurately describe the behavior of single Trp transmembrane helices in model membrane systems (18.Ren J. Lew S. Wang Z. London E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10213-10220Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Although, in theory, any pair of quenchers can be used for the analysis, the quenching pair of C-5 and C-12 was chosen for our calculations for two important reasons. First, in the case of our rHDL particles, these two quenchers gave the largest difference in quenching efficiencies (Fig. 3). Where the data was available, we also calculated depth using the C-5/C-10 and the C-5/C-7 quencher pairs. While these gave similar mean values, the standard deviations among the values between samples were consistently 2–3-fold higher than with the C-5/C-12 quencher pairs. Second, Abrams and London (17.Abrams F.S. London E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10826-10831Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) have published detailed information on the quenching of 12-NBD phospholipids using the C-5/C-12 pair. The NBD quenching data allowed the calibration of our particular batches of spin-labeled lipid to estimate Trp depths as accurately as possible (see below). For the quenchers at positions 5 and 12, the relevant depth values were: L cs = 12.15 Å, L ds = 6.3 Å, andL cd = 5.85 Å. The C term is the mole fraction of spin-labeled lipids divided by the average area occupied by a lipid molecule, 70 Å2 (17.Abrams F.S. London E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10826-10831Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). For a fluorophore that is surrounded on all sides by quencher (as is the case for the transmembrane peptides used in this study), C was calculated using the mole fraction value of 0.15 (the fraction of label for all particles in this study). However, in the case of the rHDL particle, the Trp residue is on the edge of the bilayer and is only exposed to the lipid on one side. Since the diameter of a phospholipid molecule is small compared with the diameter of the rHDL disc, the Trp in a rHDL particle is expected to have a lipid exposure that is about 50% that of a free floating peptide. Thus, a mole fraction of 0.075 was used to calculate C for all of the rHDL particles in this study. The spin label content of the purchased spin-labeled phospholipids was measured as suggested by Abrams and London (17.Abrams F.S. London E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10826-10831Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). These authors have reportedF/F o values for the quenching of 12-NBD-PC in PBS at pH 7 in SUV in the presence of the DOXYL-5 and DOXYL-12 phospholipids present at 10 mol %. The spin label/phosphorus ratio for the particular batch of spin labels had been previously calibrated against known standards by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. As an ESR machine was not available for calibration in our work, we performed the same quenching experiments. We determined that our batch of lipids contained an average of 0.95 spin labels/mol of phosphorus. This factor was taken into account during the reconstitutions of the rHDL and SUV used in this study. To determine the orientation of apoA-I helices with respect to the lipid bilayer, we produced two single Trp mutants of proapoA-I, one containing a Trp at position 108 and the other containing a Trp at position 115. Both of these sites occur in the putative helical repeat 4 (as numbered by Roberts et al.(28.Roberts L.M. Ray M.J. Shih T.W. Hayden E. Reader M.M. Brouillette C.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7615-7624Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar)). This region was chosen because (a) it already contained a naturally occurring Trp at position 108 and (b) repeat 4 is punctuated on both ends with a Pro residue and is universally predicted to exist entirely as a α-helix in rHDL particles (29.Nolte R.T. Atkinson D. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 1221-1239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 30.Calabresi L. Meng Q.H. Castro G.R. Marcel Y.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6477-6484Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 31.Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. De Loof H. Brouillette C.G. Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid. Res. 1992; 33: 141-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both Trp residues at pos. 108 and 115 are predicted to be in the center of the hydrophobic face of the helix as one looks down the long axis of the repeat (Fig. 1) and likely interact with lipid. However, when one looks perpendicular to the long axis of the helix (from a side view, as in Fig.2), Trp-108 is near the center of the helix, roughly equidistant from the N- and C-terminal Pro residues that punctuate the repeat. Trp-115, however, is two helical turns C-terminal to Trp-108, about 12 Å closer to Pro-121. The hypothesized predictions for lipid quenching studies using these two mutants in nitroxide label-containing rHDL are shown in Fig. 2. If the helix is in the picket fence orientation, Trp-108 should be situated near the center of the membrane and Trp-115 should be substantially more shallow. If the helix is in the belt orientation, both Trp residues should exhibit similar depths and will be situated some distance up each leaflet in the bilayer. In our initial experiments, each of the two single Trp mutants were reconstituted with phospholipids containing quenchers at each of the five commercially available positions along the phospholipid acyl chain (C-5, -7, -10, -12, and -16). A sixth preparation contained POPC only. The first set of reconstitutions was performed at 100:1 (mole of PL:mole of proapoA-I). The reaction mixture produced two populations of rHDL particles of 160 and 98 Å in diameter that were easily separated by gel filtration. To obtain information about particles that contained only two molecules of proapoA-I per particle, a second set of reconstitutions was performed at a PL:proapoA-I molar ratio of 40:1. In this series, the particles were only made with quenchers at positions C-5 and C-12 for the parallax analysis (for cost reasons) resulting in two populations of 93 and 76Å in diameter. These were also isolated by gel filtration. The use of the Trp mutants in fluorescence studies depends on the assumption that the amino acid replacements do not perturb the structure and function of the WT proapoA-I. In previous work, we have characterized [email protected] in detail and determined that it was similar to WT using several indices of protein structure and function (15.Davidson W.S.

https://openalex.org/W2009167743,"We have investigated the age-dependent modifications in the expression of eight different subunits of the γ-aminobutyric acid, type A (GABAA) receptor (α1, α2, α3, α5, β2, β3, γ2S, and γ2L) and all four subunits of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylsoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) receptor (GluR1–4) in the hippocampus of 24-month-old rats. All aged hippocampi displayed a remarkable increase (aged/adult ratio, 3.53 ± 0.54) in the mRNA levels of the short version of the γ2 subunit in parallel with a similar increase in the γ2 subunit protein (aged/adult ratio, 2.90 ± 0.62). However, this increase was not observed in the mature receptor. On the other hand, the expression of the different α subunit mRNAs increased moderately with aging, displaying a heterogeneous pattern. The most frequent modification consisted in an increase in the expression of the α1 subunit mRNA (aged/adult ratio, 1.26 ± 0.18), in parallel with a similar increase on the α1 protein (aged/adult ratio, 1.27 ± 0.12) and in the α1 incorporated to the assembled GABAA receptor (tested by immunoprecipitation; aged/adult ratio, = 1.20 ± 0.10). However, in the same hippocampal samples, no major modifications were observed on the expression of the AMPA receptor subunits. As a whole, these results indicated the existence of an increased expression of the GABAA receptor subunits and a preservation of the AMPA receptor at the hippocampal formation. These modifications could reflect the existence of specific deficiencies (neuronal loss and/or deafferentiation) on the GABAergic system in the aged rats.

Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 13-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The GABAA1 and AMPA receptors (major fast inhibitory and excitatory receptor complexes, respectively) could be implicated in these alterations (2.Michaelis E.K. Prog. Neurobiol. 1998; 54: 369-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 3.Davies P. Anderton B. Kirsch J. Konnerth A. Nitsch R. Sheetz M. Prog. Neurobiol. 1998; 55: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Both neurotransmitter receptors are composed of a high number of subunits in a, probably, pentameric or tetrameric conformation. The GABAA receptors are formed by the combination of a total of 19 subunits grouped in eight families: α1–6, β1–3, γ1–3, δ, ρ1–3, ε, π, and θ (Ref. 5.Bonnert T.P. McKernan R.M. Farrar S. Le Bourdelles B. Heavens R.P. Hewson L. Rigby M.R. Sirinathsinghji D.J. Brown N. Wafford K.A. Whiting P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The AMPA-preferring ionotropic glutamate receptor is composed by four subunits (GluR1–4) displaying different splicing isoforms (for a review, see Ref. 6.Dingledine R. Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61PubMed Google Scholar). This high molecular heterogeneity can generate multiple receptor isotypes, displaying particular physiological and pharmacological properties. It is known that the sensitivity for benzodiazepines (anxiolytic/hypnotic drugs that interact to the GABAAreceptor) increase during aging in humans and in rodents (7.Greenblatt D.J. Shader R.I. Harmatz J.S. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1989; 29: 866-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Previous work from our group has demonstrated the existence of aging-associated modifications in both the pharmacological properties and the molecular composition of the GABAA receptors in rat hippocampus (8.Ruano D. Cano J. Machado A. Vitorica J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1991; 256: 902-908PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Ruano D. Benavides J. Machado A. Vitorica J. J.

Neuroscience. 1996; 74: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These changes could reflect a sensitization process of the GABAA receptor (see also Ref. 11.Griffith W.H. Murchison D.A. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2407-2416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the age-dependent modifications on the expression of the different subunits of the GABAA receptor are currently unknown. This lack of knowledge is probably due to both the high number of subunits expressed at the hippocampal formation and the heterogeneity of the aging process. On the other hand, the excitatory glutamate receptors, especially AMPA-preferring glutamate receptors, seem to be less vulnerable to normal aging, as revealed by the absence of modifications on its binding properties (12.Nicolle M.M. Bizon J.L. Gallagher M. Neuroscience. 1996; 74: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 13.Magnusson K.R. Cotman C.W. Neurobiol.

Aging. 1996; 17: 639-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, the hippocampal GABAergic system seems to be preferentially affected in the aged rats (Ref. 15.Shetty A.K. Turner D.A. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 394: 252-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar and references therein). Aiming at obtaining an extensive and global knowledge of the possible age-dependent alterations in the expression of both GABAA and AMPA receptors, we have quantified, using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, the expression of 18 different mRNAs implicated on both the GABAergic system and the AMPA receptor in each hippocampal sample. We are aware that aging also displays anatomical heterogeneity (10.Gutierrez A. Khan Z.U. Ruano D. Miralles C.P. Vitorica J. Deblas A.L. Neuroscience. 1996; 74: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 15.Shetty A.K. Turner D.A. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 394: 252-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 16.Gutierrez A. Khan Z.U. Miralles C.P. Deblas A.L. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 35: 91-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and with our approach, we cannot resolve these modifications. However, we have analyzed the expression of eight GABAA receptor subunits (α1, α2, α3, α5, β2, β3, γ2S, and γ2L, the most abundantly expressed subunits at the hippocampal formation) and all four AMPA-preferring glutamate receptor subunits (GluR1–4), including their flip and flop variants, together with both GAD isoenzymes in the same hippocampus from adults and 24-month-old rats. Furthermore, using the same samples, we have also quantified the relative abundance of two subunit proteins (α1 and γ2 subunits) of the GABAA receptor complex that consistently increased during aging. In all, we have obtained a significant amount of information about the age-dependent modifications of the expression of different subunits of the two major fast neurotransmitter receptors. Adult (3 months) and aged (24 months) Wistar rats were killed by decapitation, and the hippocampi were rapidly dissected and frozen in liquid N2. The hippocampi were stored at –80 °C until use. Total RNA and proteins were extracted using the TripureTM isolation reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) kit, according to the instructions of the manufacturer. This procedure allows the isolation of total RNA, DNA, and protein fractions from a single sample. The contaminating DNA in the RNA samples was removed by incubation with DNase and confirmed by PCR analysis of total RNA samples prior to RT. After isolation, the integrity of the RNA samples were assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The yield of total RNA was determined by measuring the absorbance (260/280 nm) of ethanol-precipitated aliquots of the samples. The recovery of RNA was similar for both young and old hippocampi (not shown). To analyze the protein fraction, the protein pellets obtained using the TripureTM isolation reagent, from adult and aged hippocampus, were resuspended in 1% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The total recovery and integrity of these fractions were determined as (17.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol.

RT was performed in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmdNTPs, 1 mm random hexamers, 50 units of ribonuclease inhibitor, and 100 units of AMV-RT (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in a final volume of 20 μl and 1 μg of total RNA as template. After RT, samples were treated with RNase, and free nucleotides were eliminated using GlassMAX spin cartridges (Life Technologies, Inc.). As control of the efficiency in the RT, samples from adult and aged hippocampi were reverse-transcribed as described above but in presence of 2 μm digoxigenin-dUTP, and the purified cDNA was dotted on Nylon membranes and developed (see below). The films were scanned and the adult and aged samples were compared. The results (aged/adult ratio, 1.10 ± 0.40, n = 11) demonstrated a similar RT efficiency in both ages. Competitive RT-PCR was performed basically as described (18.Devaud L.L. Smith F.D. Grayson D.R. Morrow A.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 861-868PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, aliquots of hippocampal cDNA (100 ng/tube) and known quantities of internal standards, corresponding to the α1, α2, α3, α5, β2, β3, γ2S, and γ2L GABAA receptor subunits, were mixed in different tubes with increasing amount of internal standards. Each internal standard consisted of the same sequence amplified in the native subunit, but modified by the inclusion of a BglII restriction site, cloned into pGEM-1 plasmids (kind gifts from Dr. Dennis R. Grayson) (19.Grayson D.R. Bovolin P. Santi M.R. Methods Neurosci. 1993; 12: 191-208Google Scholar). For each GABAA receptor subunit, the range of internal standard quantities was established in control experiments using adult hippocampus. For each subunit, the range was as follows: 10–1000 fg for α1, α3, α5, β2, and β3; 100–1000 fg for α2; and 10–10,000 fg for γ2 (S or L isoforms). The PCR was performed in a final volume of 50 μl, usingTaq polymerase, 2.5 units, in the buffer supplied by the manufacturer (Ecogen); 1.5, 2, or 3 mm MgCl2, for the α, β, or γ subunits, respectively, including 1 μm each 5′ (sense) and 3′ (antisense) of the respective primers pairs (20.Lambolez B. Ropert N. Perrais D. Rossier J. Hestrin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1797-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar); and 50 μm dNTPs with the addition of 2 μm digoxigenin-dUTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Internal standards and cDNA were heat-denatured for 5 min at 94 °C, and tubes were kept on ice until ready for PCR. The PCR was performed with 30 cycles consisting of 94 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 50 s, followed by a final elongation period of 5 min at 72 °C in a Techne Progene Thermal Cycler. The PCR products (5–10 μl) were digested overnight with 10 units of BglII and separated on a 1.7% agarose gel in 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA buffer. After electrophoresis, the PCR products were transferred onto a Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a vacuum blotting system, VacuGeneTM XL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 50 mbar of pressure. The nylon membranes were blocked, incubated with an anti-digoxigenine antibody conjugated with peroxidase (dilution, 1/20,000; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), washed with Tween 0.1% in phosphate-buffered saline, and processed for chemiluminescence detection using the ECL-plus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Films were developed and scanned with a laser densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, model 300 A). Bands for both native cDNA (uncut band) and internal standard (cut band) were analyzed, and the data are the ratio between internal standard and native cDNA (see Fig. 1). All subunits were determined in at least duplicate, and for each experiment, a minimum of one adult and one aged samples were processed and analyzed in parallel. Control experiments for the efficiency of the transference, second antibody dilution, and film exposure were performed. In all cases, we found a linear correlation between the amount of PCR products and the detected absorbance on the films (not shown). The same samples used for the PCR amplification of the GABAA receptor subunits, from adult and aged rat hippocampus, were amplified using primers common to GluR1–4 (sense primer, CCTTTGGCCTATGAGATCTGGATGTG; antisense primer, TCGTACCACCATTTGTTTTTCA) with 35 PCR cycles, as described (20.Lambolez B. Ropert N. Perrais D. Rossier J. Hestrin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1797-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), but including 2 μm digoxigenin-dUTP. The PCR products, 750 bp, (10 μl per subunit) were digested by BglI,BanII, Eco47III, or EcoRI restriction enzymes, which specifically cut the GluR1 (300 and 449 bp), GluR2 (478 and 271 bp), GluR3 (359 and 396 bp), or GluR4 (411 and 338) PCR fragments, respectively. The restriction products were separated on a 1.7% agarose gel and transferred to Hybond membranes, and the films were generated and processed as described above. Quantification was performed for each electrophoresis lane, corresponding to a subunit-specific digestion, by summing the absorbance values of cut and uncut bands and normalizing to 100%. Thus, the percentage of the cut bands corresponds to the proportion of GluR1–4 subunits present in the PCR-amplified product. The total amount of all four AMPA receptor subunits was estimated by quantifying the total, undigested PCR products. For comparative proposes, the results were normalized by the abundance of the β-actin (see below). Flip/flop proportion of the GluR1–4 subunits was quantified using the product of the first PCR (see above) as a template for a second PCR (in the presence of 2 μm digoxigenin-dUTP). Specific sense primers for either GluR1, -2, -3, or -4 and the common antisense primer was that used for the first amplification. The PCR products (632, 639, 628, and 630 bp, corresponding to GluR1, -2, -3 and -4, respectively (both flip and flop in all cases)) were then cut with subunit specific enzymes (BglI for GluR1 flip and GluR2 flop, andHpaI for GluR3 flop and GluR4 flop (20.Lambolez B.

Lino M. Tsuzuki K. Ozawa S. Neuron. 1994; 12: 383-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar)) and processed as described above. Both isoforms of the glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65 and GAD67) were amplified from the same cDNA samples as for GABAA, and AMPA receptors. For the detection of GAD65 and GAD67 mRNAs, the following set of specific primers were used, from 5′ to 3′: GAD65 sense, TCTTTTCTCCTGGTGGTGCC (position 713); GAD65 antisense, CCCCAAGCAGCATCCACAT (position 1085); GAD67 sense, TACGGGGTTCGCACAGGTC (position 713); GAD67 antisense, CCCCAAGCAGCATCCACAT (position 1159). The same antisense primer was used for the amplification of both GAD65 and GAD67. This primer had one mismatch with the sequence of the GAD67, as indicated by the underlined base (21.Bochet P. Audinat E. Lambolez B. Crepel F. Rossier J. Lino M. Tsuzuki K. Ozawa S. Neuron. 1994; 12: 383-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The PCR products were processed as described above. The results were normalized by the expression of a housekeeper gene, β-actin. The β-actin was amplified using the specific primer pairs, from 5′ to 3′: sense, CGGAACCGCTCATTGCC; antisense, ACCCACACTGTGCCCATCTA. PCR was performed in the presence of 2 μm digoxigenin-dUTP. In all cases, the GAD65, GAD67, AMPA, and β-actin were amplified, electrophoresed, and processed in parallel. In addition, samples for adult and aged rats were also processed and analyzed in parallel. For quantification, three different cDNA dilutions were used, and 20, 25, and 30 cycles of PCR were run in order to avoid the problem of band saturation. Hippocampal membranes from 3- and 24-month-old Wistar rats were prepared by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 ×g as described elsewhere (8, 22, 23 and ref. therein) in presence of protease inhibitors: 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmbenzamidine, 50 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor type II-S, and 50 μg/ml bacitracin. The GABAA receptor was solubilized at 1 mg of protein/ml, 4 °C for 60 min, with 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% (w/v) CHAPS, 140 mm NaCl, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing the same protease inhibitors as above. After centrifugation at 100.000 × g, for 60 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected. Previous work has demonstrated the absence of subunit redistribution using this solubilization conditions (24.Araujo F. Ruano D. Vitorica J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 347: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). When needed, the anti-α1 and anti-γ2 antibodies (24.Araujo F. Ruano D. Vitorica J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 347: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 25.Araujo F. Tan S. Ruano D. Schoemaker H. Benavides J. Vitorica J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27902-27911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) were purified through peptide affinity columns. The peptides were coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). One ml of the different antisera (diluted 1/5 in phosphate-buffered saline) were recirculated overnight at 4 °C in the corresponding column (1 ml). After washing with 150 ml phosphate-buffered saline, the antibodies were eluted with 50 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.3, and the fractions (0.5 ml) were neutralized by 1 m Tris, pH 11, pooled, and dialyzed against 1 liter of phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C. Prior to utilization, saturating amounts (not shown) of the different antibodies were adsorbed to 50 μl of a suspension of protein A-Sepharose (10% (w/v) in solubilization buffer; see also Refs. 24.Araujo F. Ruano D. Vitorica J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 347: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar and25.Araujo F. Tan S. Ruano D. Schoemaker H. Benavides J. Vitorica J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27902-27911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitations were done as described (24.Araujo F. Ruano D. Vitorica J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 347: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 25.Araujo F. Tan S. Ruano D. Schoemaker H. Benavides J. Vitorica J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27902-27911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitation was quantified by determining the binding activity of 10 nm [3H]flumazenil (total benzodiazepine receptors) in both pellets and the final supernatants. The binding assays were done essentially as described previously (23.Ruano D. Araujo F. Machado A. Deblas A.L. Vitorica J. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 25: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It is known that the γ2 subunit displays an anomalous electrophoretic behavior in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (26.Benke D. Honer M. Michel C. Mohler H. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 1413-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 27.Stephenson F.A. Duggan M.J. Pollard S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21160-21165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it is difficult to detect in Western blots (28.Pollard S. Thompson C.L. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21285-21290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, the γ2 subunit from adult and aged hippocampus was first immunopurified through anti-γ2 affinity columns (our anti-γ2 antibody was made against a peptide of the N-terminal domain of the protein, and thus, it recognizes both short and long isoforms). The anti-γ2 immunoaffinity columns were synthesized as described (25.Araujo F. Tan S. Ruano D. Schoemaker H. Benavides J. Vitorica J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27902-27911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Fab fragments of the purified anti-γ2 antibodies were used in order to avoid any possible interference with the IgG heavy chain (55 kDa). The Fab fragments were prepared using papain-agarose (Pierce) as recommended by the manufacturer. The Fab immunoaffinity columns were synthesized using CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For immunopurification of the γ2 subunits, the protein fractions (containing 1% of SDS, see above) were diluted 1/5 with 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and aliquots of 50, 100, and 200 μg of proteins were applied to 200 μl of affinity column. After overnight adsorption (at 4 °C), the columns were extensively washed and eluted with 2% SDS in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The eluted receptor was electrophoresed and processed for immunoblot (25.Araujo F. Tan S. Ruano D. Schoemaker H. Benavides J. Vitorica J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27902-27911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For each determination, one adult and one aged hippocampus were processed in parallel. Importantly, the immunopurification approach was quantitative, because after a first round of immunopurification, no immunoreaction product (M r 43,000 peptide) (24.Araujo F. Ruano D. Vitorica J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 347: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) was detected in a second round of anti-γ2 immunopurification (see Fig. 3 A). For the comparison between adult and aged rats, three different aliquots were immunopurified and analyzed in parallel. Immunoblots, protein determination, and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were done as described elsewhere (24.Araujo F. Ruano D. Vitorica J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 347: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 25.Araujo F. Tan S. Ruano D. Schoemaker H. Benavides J. Vitorica J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27902-27911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The statistical analysis of the data were performed using one-way ANOVA or multifactor ANOVA and the Tukey post hoc multiple comparisons test. The expression of different subunits of the GABAA receptor was quantified by competitive RT-PCR using cDNAs from hippocampus of 3-month-old (adult) and 24-month-old (aged) rats. Fig. 1 shows a representative experiment of the competitive RT-PCR analysis of the α5 subunit mRNA from one adult and two aged rats. This experiment illustrates the linearity of the competitive RT-PCR (in the range selected for each subunit of the GABAA receptor; see under “Materials and Methods”), the experimental variability of triplicate measurements, and also the differences between the adult and the different aged samples. Thus, using this approach, we have quantified the expression of eight subunits of the GABAAreceptor complex (α1, α2, α3, α5, γ2S, γ2L, β2, and β3 subunits; the major subunits expressed at the hippocampal formation) (29.Wisden W. Laurie D.J. Mohler H. Seeburg P.H. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1040-1062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Fritschy J.M. Mohler H. J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 359: 154-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar) in a total population of four adults and five aged rats. As shown, Fig. 2 A, in the adult and aged rats, the expression of the different GABAAreceptor subunits agrees with previous reports using in situhybridization (29.Wisden W. Laurie D.J. Mohler H. Seeburg P.H. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1040-1062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is interesting to note the low interindividual variation found in the four adults tested. The coefficients of variation for each subunit (calculated as SD/mean) were 0.13, 0.11, 0.26, 0.16, 0.39, 0.24, 0.27, and 0.22 for α1, α2, α3, α5, γ2 s, γ2L, β2, and β3, respectively (mean, 0.22). By comparing all subunits in both ages, we observed a significant increase in the aged population (multifactor ANOVA F (1,71) = 59.66,p = 0.00001) and also significant differences between subunits and ages (subunit × age, multifactor ANOVA F (7,71) = 55.36, p = 0.00001; Tukey p < 0.05). When the expression of the total mRNA levels for the different subunit families (i.e. α1 + α2 + α3 + α5, β2 + β3, and γ2S + L) was analyzed, a significant increase in the aged rats was observed for the α and γ2 subunits (TableI). The expression of the GABAA receptor from aged hippocampus showed an important high interindividual variability. The coefficients of variation, calculated as above, for the expression of the different subunits in the aged rats were 0.20, 0.12, 1.2, 0.26, 0.14, 0.28, 0.26, and 0.24 for α1, α 2, α3, α5, γ2 s, γ2L, β2, and β3, respectively (mean, 0.34). This high variability is likely due to the aging process and not an artifact because of the competitive RT-PCR (see Fig. 1). Thus, we also analyzed individually the percentage of variation (versus adult) in the expression of the α and γ subunits. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the expression of these GABAA receptor subunits showed a clear tendency to increase during aging. In fact, the expression of the γ2S subunit increased notably in the hippocampus from all five tested rats (see also Fig. 4, in which a new aged sample was analyzed) (ranging from 190 to 320% of the adult values; mean, 253.8 ± 53.9%; ANOVA F (1,7) = 69.33, p = 0.001; Tukey p < 0.01) with no modifications in the expression of the long splicing version of this subunit. Consequently, the S/L ratio (1.81 ± 0.7versus 6.3 ± 1.9 for adult and aged rats, respectively) also significantly increased in the aged hippocampi (F (1,7) = 21.9, p = 0.002; Tukey p< 0.05).Table IAge-dependent modifications in the total mRNA content of the different subunit families of the hippocampal GABAAreceptorAgeTotal mRNA (fg/0.1 μg cDNA)α subunitsβ subunitsγ2 subunits3 months2157 ± 1361310 ± 1583717 ± 91724 months2563 ± 107aANOVA F (1,7) = 24.94,p = 0.002; Tukey p < 0.05.1318 ± 2369284 ± 1237bANOVA F (1,7) = 55.7 p = 0.0001; Tukey p < 0.01.(+19.0 ± 5.1%)(+250 ± 48%)The total expression of the different subunit families was calculated as the sum of the mRNA content of the different subunits tested (e.g. α1 + α2 + α3 + α5; β2 + β3; γ2s + γ2L).

Open table in a new tab The total expression of the different subunit families was calculated as the sum of the mRNA content of the different subunits tested (e.g. α1 + α2 + α3 + α5; β2 + β3; γ2s + γ2L). The results are mean ± S.D. of four and five different experiments for adult and aged rats, respectively. On the other hand, the age-dependent modifications in the expression of the different α subunits were highly heterogeneous (see Fig. 2). The most common pattern of variation in the aged rats was an increase in the α1 subunit mRNA (four of five animals; ranging from 17 to 50%; mean, 32.5 ± 14.7%; significant difference from adult, ANOVA F (1,6) = 9.59, p = 0.02; Tukeyp < 0.05). It is noteworthy that the single aged hippocampus displaying no differences in the α1 level, rat 26, was also the only aged rat showing a notable increase in the expression of the α5 subunit (see Figs. 1 and 2; 61.1% over the adult value). It is also interesting that in most cases (rats 7, 10, and 16), the increment in the α1 subunit was also accompanied by an increase in other α subunit(s) (see Fig. 2 B), such as α2 (rats 10 and 16; 28 and 25% respectively) or α3 (rat 7; 700%). We next compared the expression of the proteins corresponding to α1 and γ2 subunits, using the protein fractions obtained from the same hippocampal samples as above (see under “Materials and Methods”). Fig. 3 C shows the immunoreaction product corresponding to the immunopurified γ2 subunit (43 kDa), which clearly increased in the aged samples (comparelanes 1–3 with 4–6). The differenc"

The importance of this hydrogen bond is obvious, in light of the enhanced nucleophilicity of GS− versus the protonated thiol. Several A-class GSTs contain a C-terminal segment that undergoes a ligand-dependent local folding reaction. Here, we demonstrate the effects of the Y9F substitution on binding affinity for glutathione conjugates and on rates of the order-disorder transition of the C terminus in rat GST A1-1. The equilibrium binding affinity of the glutathione conjugate, GS-NBD (NBD-Cl, 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole), was decreased from 4.09 μm to 0.641 μm upon substitution of Tyr-9 with Phe. This result was supported by isothermal titration calorimetry, with K d values of 1.51 μm and 0.391 μm for wild type and Y9F, respectively. The increase in binding affinity for the mutant is associated with dramatic decreases in rates for the C-terminal order-disorder transition, based on a stopped-flow kinetic analysis. The same effects were observed, qualitatively, for a second GSH conjugate, GS-ethacrynic acid.

In many cases, a protein-ligand interaction appears to drive a flexible segment to fold into a rigid, ligand-bound conformation (6.Arnold S. O'Brien R. Franken P. Strub M-P. Hoh F. Dumas C.

The concept of folding funnels, where folding progresses via multiple routes rather than a single pathway, can be likened to binding where a ligand drives an ensemble of local states to a single conformation. However, the detailed mechanism of any ligand-dependent, localized folding process remains elusive and is probably less well understood than global folding (12.Stayton P.S. Nature. 1999; 397: 20-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar).The glutathione S-transferase (GST)1 isoform A1-1 provides an outstanding opportunity to dissect the mechanism of a ligand-dependent local folding reaction. The GSTs are a family of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes that play a critical role in the detoxication of various endogenous and exogenous compounds. The mammalian cytosolic GSTs consist of seven classes based on sequence similarity and substrate selectivity: α (A), π (P), μ (M), θ (T), κ (K), ς (S), and ζ (Z) (13.Mannervik B. Ålin P.

The catalytic activity of GSTs is based on deprotonation of GSH to form the thiolate (GS−), which is a superior nucleophile compared with the protonated thiol. X-ray crystallographic structures and site-directed mutagenesis studies illustrate that each GST contains a conserved tyrosine or serine residue that contributes to thiolate formation through a hydrogen bond (OH····−SG) and reduces the pK a of bound GSH. Although mutation at this catalytic site dramatically reduces k cat orV max rates for 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene,K m values for the substrate and GSH are not significantly altered (18.Kong K.H.

For example, in the absence of a bound hydrophobic ligand, the 15 C-terminal residues of hGST A1-1 are invisible crystallographically (25.Cameron A. Sinning I. L'Hermite G. Olin B. Board P.G. Mannervik B. Jones A. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Although it is unclear whether the residues are completely disordered or lie in a delocalized helix, the C terminus will be referred to here as “disordered” in this unobservable state. In conjunction, the “folded” or “ordered” state refers to the observable helix when a GS-product conjugate is bound.Previously, contributions of the helix to catalysis, ligandin function, and ligand dissociation and binding in GST A1-1 have been determined (24.Allardyce C.S.

However, the detailed mechanism for, and the residues involved in, the ordering of the helix have not been elucidated. Hyperbaric experiments have illustrated that the ionization state of Tyr-9 is thermodynamically coupled to the dynamics of the C terminus (28.Atkins W.M. Dietze E.C. Ibarra C. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 873-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Presumably, then, the hydrogen bonding status of Tyr-9 should also be energetically linked to the dynamics of the C terminus. Therefore, we hypothesized that a hydrogen bond to the phenolic oxygen of Tyr-9 provides a mechanism for communication between the active site and the C terminus, perhaps through an on-face electrostatic interaction between Phe-220 and Tyr-9.Here, we demonstrate directly that the catalytic Tyr-9 of rGST A1-1 controls the ligand-dependent folding of the C terminus, presumably through stabilization of the transition state for this conformational change, as well as the rates of ligand binding and dissociation. These results illustrate the importance of a second-sphere, indirect interaction between a structural element (C terminus) and a remote protein-ligand hydrogen bond (OH····SGR). Moreover, they expand the role of the catalytic tyrosine in GST A1-1 beyond the previous paradigm, which has been limited to stabilization of the GS− thiolate and catalysis of the chemical conjugation step.RESULTSAs described, we hypothesized on the basis of high pressure experiments that the Tyr-9 hydrogen bond controls the dynamics of the C terminus (28.Atkins W.M. Dietze E.C. Ibarra C. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 873-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In turn, we would expect that loss of the hydrogen bond between Tyr-9 and a GS-product conjugate, as in the mutant Y9F, would alter binding affinity as well as rates of ligand binding and dissociation. Equilibrium dialysis was used to determine the binding affinity of WT and Y9F for the synthesized 7-glutathionyl-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (GS-NBD) product conjugate (Fig. 1). Concentrations of free and bound GS-NBD yielded K d values of 4.09 μm and 0.641 μm for WT and Y9F, respectively (Table I). The experimentally observed stoichiometry was 1.2 and 1.1 GS-NBD binding/subunit for WT and Y9F, respectively. As an additional, albeit, qualitative method of comparing the affinities of WT and Y9F GST A1-1 for GS-NBD, a gel filtration experiment was performed. In elution fractions containing an equivalent amount of protein (∼8 μm), the WT fraction did not contain any detectable GS-NBD, whereas 3.1 μm GS-NBD remained in the Y9F-containing fraction.Table IWTY9FK 1 (μm)51.910.7Amp20.04700.0339k 2(s−1)59.85.37Amp−20.05160.0350k −2(exp)(s−1)aDissociation rate constants determined directly from experimental stopped-flow data (Fig. 3).16.32.27k −2(calc)(s−1)bDissociation rate constants determined from they intercept of the k obs plots in Fig. 2.15.11.52K 20.2730.423K d(calc)(μm)cEquilibrium dissociation constant calculated from the pre-steady state kinetic constants, according to the equationK d(calc) = K 1 × (k −2/(k −2 + k 2)).11.23.18K d(Eq.

Open table in a new tab Because of the surprising nature of the equilibrium results, isothermal titration calorimetry was used to confirm the binding affinity of Y9F and WT for GS-NBD. Confirming the other measurements,K d values determined by isothermal titration calorimetry for WT and Y9F were 1.51 and 0.391 μm, respectively (Table I). Although removal of the hydrogen bond between Tyr-9 and the GS-NBD ligand might be expected to decrease binding affinity, these results clearly demonstrate that ligand binds more tightly in the absence of this hydrogen bond.Binding and Dissociation KineticsTo directly monitor the C-terminal dynamics of the ligand-bound complex, binding and dissociation rates were measured by stopped-flow fluorescence. A decrease in fluorescence intensity was observed on mixing 2 μm GST with 20–400 μm GS-NBD (Fig.2, top). The observed rate constant, k obs, was determined from the single exponential fit to the raw data (Equation 1), andk obs was plotted versus GS-NBD concentration, yielding a hyperbolic curve for both WT and Y9F (Fig. 2,bottom). The simplest mechanism that fulfills a hyperbolic plot is a two-step mechanism where GST and GS-NBD rapidly combine to form a precomplex, [GST·GS-NBD] (k 1), which slowly isomerizes to the final complex, [GST·GS-NBD]* × (k 2) (Equation 2) (38.Eigen M.

GST+GS­NBD ⇌k−1k1 [GST·GS­NBD]⇌k−2k2 [GST·GS­NBD]*Equation 2 In accordance with previous results with the glutathione-ethacrynic acid product conjugate (GS-EA), we propose that the initial step, k 1, corresponds to the docking of GS-NBD within the active site to yield [GST·GS-NBD], a complex that has a disordered C terminus. The second step,k 2, corresponds to the folding of the C-terminal helix to yield [GST·GS-NBD]*, the final equilibrium complex (29.Nieslanik B.S. Dabrowski M.J. Lyon R.P. Atkins W.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6971-6980Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Figure 2Representative data and analysis for the binding of 25 μm GS-NBD to 1 μm WT rGST A1-1 (left) or 1 μm Y9F (right).

Bottom, dependence of the observed rate constant (k obs) on GS-NBD concentration. A hyperbolic relationship was established betweenk obs and [GS-NBD] for both WT (left) and Y9F (right). The data fit best to a hyperbolic equation [k obs =k −2 + (k 2 × [GS-NBD])/([GS-NBD] + K1)], withR 2 values of 0.969 and 0.953, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)This two-step model is supported by stopped-flow studies with a C-terminal truncation mutant, Δ209–222. In binding experiments with GS-EA, a single, rapid rate was observed on ligand binding to Δ209–222. In contrast, in binding reactions with WT and GS-EA, both rapid and slow binding rates were observed (29.Nieslanik B.S. Dabrowski M.J. Lyon R.P. Atkins W.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6971-6980Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, from our previous studies with GS-EA, it is clear that the second kinetic phase reflects motion of the C terminus. Here, in binding experiments between Δ209–222 and GS-NBD, the kinetic trace was flat. However, the equilibrium fluorescence intensity of a solution of Δ209–222 is higher than that observed in a mixture containing the [Δ209- 222·GS-NBD] complex, suggestive that ligand docking occurs but is too rapid to detect in the stopped-flow experiments (data not shown). According to this two-step mechanism in which the first step is too fast to explicitly measure k 1 andk −1, the constants k 2,k −2, and K 1, whereK 1 is equal tok −1/k 1, are determined from the fit of the kobs plots to (Equation 3) (40.Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1985: 121-154Google Scholar). kobs=k−2(calc)+{(k2×[S])/([S]+K1)}Equation 3 Kinetic constants determined from Equation 3 are found in TableI.In addition to association rates, rates of dissociation were directly obtained from the rate of the increase in intrinsic protein fluorescence after the addition of glutathione sulfonic acid (GSO3−) to an equal volume of the [GST·GS-NBD] complex (Fig. 3). The binding of the trapping agent, GSO3−, caused no fluorescence change; therefore its binding is spectroscopically silent (29.Nieslanik B.S. Dabrowski M.J. Lyon R.P. Atkins W.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6971-6980Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Fluorescence data fit best to the single exponential equation (Equation 1), yielding the dissociation rate,k −2(exp), similar to that calculated from (Equation 3), k −2(calc) (Table I).Figure 3Kinetics of GS-NBD dissociation from 2 μm [GST·GS-NBD] complex for WT (top) and Y9F (bottom).Dissociation rates were determined directly from a fit to the single exponential decay Equation 1. R 2 values were 0.945 and 0.800 for WT and Y9F, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Several interesting results were obtained from the stopped-flow analysis. One informative difference between Y9F and WT is the change in the fluorescence intensity on binding and dissociation (Figs. 2 and3). In binding and dissociation experiments, the fluorescence intensity change in Y9F is about 70% that of WT, as determined by amplitude values (Table I). Although fluorescence intensity changes are difficult to predict, this result is most likely due to the greater fraction of the disordered C terminus for Y9F at equilibrium, 42%versus 27%, as calculated by the K 2ratio.In addition, and perhaps most striking, substitution at Tyr-9 markedly alters all binding and dissociation constants compared with WT. In the first step, docking (k 1), dissociation (k −1), or both steps are altered to reduce the equilibrium constant, K 1, 5-fold compared with WT. More interestingly, rates of ordering and disordering of the C terminus, k 2 and k −2, have been significantly reduced in Y9F, 11-fold and 7-fold, respectively. These results are the first to demonstrate the importance of the Tyr-9 to the localized folding of the C terminus and, therefore, to rates of ligand binding and dissociation in a GST.DISCUSSIONHere, we have used rGST A1-1 to study the ligand-induced, localized folding of a flexible, dynamic C terminus. Due to the presence of few specific van der Waals contacts between the C-terminal residues and the hydrophobic ligand in crystal structures, the basis for the ligand-driven transition to the crystallographically observable C terminus is not obvious (25.Cameron A. Sinning I. L'Hermite G. Olin B. Board P.G. Mannervik B. Jones A. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 26.Sinning I. Kleywegt G. Cowan S. Reinemer P. Dirr H. Huoer R. Gilliland G. Armstrong R.N. Ji X. Board P.G. Olin B. Mannervik B. Jones T. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 192-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Indeed, the ordering of the C terminus may be driven indirectly through second sphere interactions, as suggested by our hyperbaric results, which indicate a critical role for Tyr-9 (28.Atkins W.M. Dietze E.C. Ibarra C. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 873-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).Equilibrium binding experiments, including equilibrium dialysis, gel filtration, and isothermal titration calorimetry, indicate a significant difference in binding affinity for the GS-NBD product conjugate between Y9F and WT (Table I). The increased binding affinity in the Y9F enzyme was quite striking, as intuitively one would expect that removal of a hydrogen bond would decrease binding affinity. A similar effect was observed in equilibrium binding studies with Y9F hGST A1-1. Allardyce et al. (24.Allardyce C.S. McDonagh P.D. Lian L-Y. Wolf C.R. Roberts G.C.K. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 525-531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) recently found that Y9F hGST A1-1 binds the ligand, S-dinitrophenylglutathione, 20-fold more tightly than WT. ΔH° and ΔS° values also indicate a difference in the thermodynamics of binding to each enzyme. It is striking that the more favorable ΔH° in the Y9F variant comes at an entropic cost, perhaps due to decreased solvent displacement from the active site upon ordering of the C terminus. These thermodynamic results will be discussed in a forthcoming manuscript.Kinetic binding and dissociation experiments supported our previous observation that ligands bind to rGST A1-1 in a two-step sequence: a docking step, followed by a conformational transition of the C terminus from its disordered to ordered state (Equation 2) (29.Nieslanik B.S. Dabrowski M.J. Lyon R.P. Atkins W.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6971-6980Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Substitution at Tyr-9 alters the rate of both of these steps compared with WT (TableI). The reduction in the equilibrium constant,K 1, may be due to a decrease ink −1, an increase ink 1, or a combination of the two. Because the docking step is too fast to measure k −1 andk 1, we cannot determine how the mutation is affecting this kinetic step of the binding reaction from these studies.More interesting and relevant to our discussion here are the changes associated with k 2 andk −2, which correspond to the order-disorder transition of the C terminus, on substitution of Tyr-9 (Table I). These reductions in rate are not limited to the GS-NBD ligand, as similar results have been obtained with the GS-EA product conjugate. In reactions with GS-EA, the Y9F substitution reducedk −2(calc) by 6-fold, k 2by 8-fold, and K 1 by 4-fold. Thek −2(exp) could not be determined directly, presumably because GS-EA binds too tightly and is not displaced by the trapping agent, GSO3−. Surprisingly, in steady state reactions with hGST A1-1 and EA,k cat was unchanged upon substitution at Tyr-9, in contrast to our results, which suggest a decreasedk cat for a Y9F-catalyzed reaction, which is rate-limited by product release (24.Allardyce C.S. McDonagh P.D. Lian L-Y. Wolf C.R. Roberts G.C.K. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 525-531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The source of these differences is unknown.The changes in dissociation and binding rates may be due to stabilization of the complexed ground states, destabilization of the transition state, or a combination of the two. A free energy diagram, which accounts for the kinetic terms, provides a useful summary of our results (Fig. 4). The first step of the binding reaction is contained within the diagram for completeness, although we have no information of the actual k 1and k −1 rate constants and have determined only their relative ratios. For simplicity, we assumed that the equilibrium difference between WT and Y9F is entirely realized ink −1, so that k 1 is identical for WT and Y9F. On comparison of the ground state energies for the complexes with a disordered and ordered C terminus, [GST·GS-NBD]dis and [GST·GS-NBD]fold, the Y9F complexes are 0.9 and 0.6 kcal/mol more stable than the WT complexes, respectively. However, the transition state for the C-terminal isomerization is destabilized in the Y9F complex by 0.5 kcal/mol compared with WT, resulting in a 1–1.5 kcal/mol greater barrier to the C-terminal transition for the ordering (k 2) and disordering (k −2) of the C terminus.Figure 4Thermodynamic profile for the binding and dissociation reaction coordinate of GST and GS-NBD at 15 °C.The solid line denotes WT, and the dashed linedenotes Y9F.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)X-ray crystal structures give little insight into the mechanism by which the Tyr-9 residue structurally stabilizes the transition state for the order-disorder transition. Tyr-9 does lie in an aromatic cluster with Phe-10 and Phe-220, which compete for the space directly adjacent to Tyr-9 (25.Cameron A. Sinning I. L'Hermite G. Olin B. Board P.G. Mannervik B. Jones A. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 26.Sinning I. Kleywegt G. Cowan S. Reinemer P. Dirr H. Huoer R. Gilliland G. Armstrong R.N. Ji X. Board P.G. Olin B. Mannervik B. Jones T. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 192-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). It is interesting to speculate that changes in the hydrogen bond strength at Tyr-9 alter the electrostatic surface of its aromatic ring, thus altering the interaction between the electropositive edge of Phe-10 in the open state and the edge of Phe-220 in the folded state (Fig.5). This is based on documented changes in the electrostatic potential of the aromatic face of Tyr in different hydrogen bonding states (42.Gallivan J.P. Dougherty D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9459-9464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar, 43.Mecozzi S. West A.P. Dougherty D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10566-10571Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Although this is speculation, our results clearly demonstrate the importance of Tyr-9 to the ligand-induced folding of the C terminus, and they expand its role in rGST A1-1 catalysis. Apparently, the Tyr-9 residue facilitates the localized folding of the C terminus through stabilization of the transition state, thereby significantly affecting rates of ligand binding and dissociation. Because product release is rate-limiting, for a number of reactions catalyzed by the A-class GSTs, this additional role for Tyr-9 has significant functional importance, notwithstanding its role in the deprotonation of GSH.Figure 5Active-site structure of hGST A1-1 illustrating the position of Tyr-9, Phe-10, Phe-220, and residues 203–222, relative to one another in the apoenzyme (red) and GS-EA-bound enzyme (gray) (25.Cameron A.

Although the primary role of the CaSR is assumed to be the regulation of serum Ca2+ levels by parathyroid hormone and calcitonin, its wide distribution suggests the possibility that it subserves several and perhaps many additional functions. The CaSR was identified in a human insulinoma by RT-PCR (9.Kato M. Doi R. Imamura M. Furutani M. Hosotani R. Shimada Y.

This effect is used clinically in the selective intraarterial calcium injection test for the detection of small insulinomas (12.O'Shea D. Rohrer-Theurs A.W. Lynn J.A. Jackson J.E. Bloom S.R. J. Clin.

In view of these findings, we examined the potential significance of the CaSR in pancreatic β-cell function. To do this we employed the phenylalkylamine calcimimetic drug (R)-N-(3-phenylpropyl)-α-methyl-3-methoxybenzylamine hydrochloride (R-467). This compound is an agonist at the CaSR and is thought to act by an allosteric increase in the affinity of the receptor for Ca2+ and other interacting cations (15.Hammerland L.G. Garrett J.E. Hung B.C.P. Levithal C. Nemeth E.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 1083-1088PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Nemeth E.F. Steffey M.E. Hammerland L.G. Hung B.C. Van Wagenen B.C. DelMar E.G. Balandrin M.F. Proc.

Because R-467 has a novel mechanism of action, and because in islets it only stimulates insulin release in the presence of elevated glucose concentrations, there is the potential for development of new drugs for the treatment of diabetes which are unlikely to cause hypoglycemia. R-467 and its enantiomer S-467 were obtained from NPS Pharmaceuticals (Salt Lake City, UT) as was a polyclonal antibody (ADD), raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 214–235 of the hCaSR protein (courtesy of Drs. Allen Spiegel and Paul Goldsmith). Staurosporine and Ro-31-8220 were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Nitrendipine was from RBI. Diazoxide,N-methylglucamine, pertussis toxin and tolbutamide were from Sigma. Maitotoxin was obtained from Alexis Corp., San Diego, CA. C57BL/6 mice (22–25 g) and Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 g) were used in this study and had access to food and water throughout. After CO2asphyxiation, the pancreas was surgically removed and the islets isolated by collagenase digestion (18.Lacy P.E. Kostaniovsky M. Diabetes. 1967; 16: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (2472) Google Scholar). A Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (KRB) containing (in mm) 129 NaCl, 5 NaHCO3, 4.8 KCl, 1.2 KH2PO4, 1 CaCl2, 1.2 MgSO4, 10 HEPES at pH 7.4 and 0.1% bovine serum albumin was used for the insulin secretion studies with islets. A protocol slightly modified from that originally described (19.Kikuchi M. Blackard W.G. Renold A.E. Diabetes. 1974; 23: 550-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) was used. Briefly, 20 rodent islets were placed into 70-μl perifusion chambers. They were equilibrated by perifusion at 1 ml/min for 40–45 min with KRB and 2.8 mm glucose at 37 °C. This was followed by the test period and collection of samples for radioimmunoassay at 1-min intervals (still at a flow rate of 1 ml/min). The glucose concentration in the various experiments is specified in the legends, and the term basal glucose refers to a concentration of 2.8 mmglucose. βHC9 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose, 1 mm pyruvate, 2.5% fetal bovine serum, and 15% horse serum. The medium was supplemented with 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 100 units/ml penicillin. The cells were kept at 37 °C in a 95% air and 5% CO2 atmosphere. The buffer used for the measurement of insulin secretion, intracellular Ca2+ (fura-2) and membrane potential (bisoxonol) experiments was identical to the KRB used for the islet studies with the exception that gelatin was used instead of albumin for the bisoxonol experiments. Cells ranging from passage 25 to 35 were used for the experiments. Under static incubation conditions, βHC9 cells (20.Noda M. Komatsu M. Sharp G.W.G. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1766-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) were plated in 16-mm-diameter wells at a density of 0.4 × 106 and cultured for 5–8 days. In all static experiments, the cells were preincubated with KRB for 30 min at a basal glucose concentration of 0.1 mmol/liter. This was followed by a 30-min exposure to the test compounds. At the end of this test period, aliquots of the medium were removed and frozen at −20 °C until radioimmunoassay. N-Methylglucamine was substituted for Na+ in the KRB for the Na+-free studies. βHC9 cells, grown in 75-cm2 flasks, were trypsinized and resuspended in KRB (pH 7.4) containing 1 μm fura-2 acetoxymethylester and 0.25 mmsulfinpyrazone. The loading took place in a shaking water bath at 37 °C for 30 min. After three washes in KRB, the cells were resuspended in a final volume of 12 ml and then transferred into heated quartz cuvettes in a spectrofluorometer (Perkin-Elmer Cetus Instruments LS-5) under continuous stirring. Excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 340 and 510 nm, respectively (21.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Membrane potential was monitored fluorimetrically using the fluorescent dye bisoxonol (22.Wilson H.A. Chused T.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1985; 125: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). βHC9 cells were suspended in KRB with 100 nm bisoxonol at a concentration of 106 cells/ml. Gelatin (0.05%) was substituted for the bovine serum albumin to obviate interference with the assay. Three ml of the cell suspension was used for each cuvette and continuously stirred at 37 °C in the spectrofluorometer (Perkin-Elmer Cetus Instruments LS-5) until equilibrated. The excitation and emission wavelengths used were 530 and 580 nm, respectively. Test agents were introduced into the cuvettes when the emission signals were stable. For the preparation of whole cell lysates, cells were rinsed twice in ice-cold PBS, scraped off and transferred into Eppendorf tubes containing lysis buffer (in mm) 50 NaCl, 15.7 NaH2PO4, 1.47 KH2PO4, 2.68 KCl, 1 dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors (50 μm leupeptin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μm pepstatin A and 100 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonylfluoride hydrochloride (Pefabloc, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After a 20-min incubation in lysis buffer at 4 °C with shaking, cell debris was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was stored at −80 °C for subsequent Western blot analysis. Parathyroid and kidney cells were prepared in the same buffer after the tissue was cut into small pieces and disrupted using 20–30 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer. Crude plasma membranes were isolated from βHC9 and kidney medulla cells by homogenization in a hypotonic Tris buffer (20 mm, pH 7.4), containing 2 mm EDTA and 2 mm EGTA and the same protease inhibitors as above. After homogenization and cell debris sedimentation in a low speed spin, the supernatant was transferred to an ultracentrifuge and centrifuged for 1 h at 51,000 rpm at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was dissolved in Tris buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Protein content was determined by Bradford assay. Samples were separated by electrophoresis on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto an Immobilon-N membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membrane was blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin and then incubated with the monoclonal ADD antibody at a dilution of 1:32,000 for 1 h at room temperature. Following several washes in Tris-buffered saline plus Tween (0.1%), the membrane was incubated for another 1 h in peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a dilution of 1:5000 and, after repeated washing steps, the protein of interest was detected with an ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cyclic AMP was determined by means of the Biotrak cAMP enzyme immunoassay kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The whole cell current recording configuration of the patch clamp technique was used (23.Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15061) Google Scholar). Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillary tubes to a tip diameter of 2–3 μm using a List L/M-3P-A pipette puller. Pipette resistance was typically 2–3 megohms. The pipette solution contained (in mm) 140 KCl, 35 KOH, 10 HEPES, 11 EGTA, 1 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, and 2 tetraethylammonium chloride buffered to pH 7.3 (unless otherwise indicated). For experiments investigating currents in the absence of K+channel effects, the pipette solution contained (in mm) 95 CsCl, 7 MgCl2, and 5 HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH). The extracellular solution contained (in mm) 128.8 NaCl, 4.8 KCl, 1.2 KH2PO4, 1.2 MgSO4, 1 CaCl2, 5 NaHCO3, 10 HEPES, 2 glucose, 5 tetraethylammonium chloride, and 5 μm nitrendipine buffered to pH 7.4. For experiments requiring sodium-free buffer,N-methylglucamine was substituted for NaCl in the extracellular solution. For experiments employing high extracellular Ca2+, the extracellular solution contained (in mm) 90 CaCl2, 6 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 5 KHCO3, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. All solutions were filtered through a 0.2-μm sterile syringe filter prior to use. Recordings were obtained using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and passed through an internal low pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 1 KHz before being digitized at a sampling frequency of 10 KHz on a Gateway 2000 PC. PClamp6 (Fetchex) was used to analyze the data. All recordings were obtained at a holding potential of −60 mV at a temperature of 37 °C between 2 and 5 days after cell passage. Culture medium was removed from the 35-mm culture dish and extracellular solution added immediately prior to study. Studies were performed within 30 min of addition of extracellular solution. The current/voltage relationship of leak currents was determined by manually stepping the membrane potential to different levels. R-467 was then added over a 20-s period to a final concentration of 10 μm. A current/voltage relationship was then determined for the cell in the presence of R-467. Leak currents were then subtracted from the currents obtained in the presence of R-467, and the reversal potential calculated by linear regression of the current/voltage relationship of the currents corrected for leak. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was evaluated by using Student'st test analysis for paired or unpaired samples as appropriate. The effects of R-467 on insulin release from isolated mouse pancreatic islets are shown in Fig. 1. From the data shown in the lower part of the figure, it can be seen that 10 μm R-467 failed to elicit any response from the islets under basal conditions in the presence of 2.8 mm glucose. However, when insulin release was stimulated by a higher glucose concentration, a marked potentiation of the release rate was seen (upper traces). The submaximally effective concentration of 11.1 mm glucose induced a prompt first phase of secretion followed by a second phase, which was characterized by a low plateau of stimulated release. In the presence of R-467, the islets showed increased rates of insulin release over both the first and second phases of the response. The release rate potentiated by R-467 was 2.6-fold that of the 11.1 mmglucose-stimulated rate at the peak of the first phase, and 5–6-fold that of the second phase. R-467 had no effect on insulin secretion from Harlan Sprague-Dawley rat islets when tested under both basal and glucose-stimulated conditions (data not shown). To facilitate these studies on the mechanism of action of R-467, experiments were performed on the mouse-derived βHC-9 cell line (19.Kikuchi M. Blackard W.G. Renold A.E. Diabetes. 1974; 23: 550-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The effects of different concentrations of the enantiomers R-467 and S-467 were examined on insulin secretion from βHC9 cells under static incubation conditions. The results are presented in Fig.2. In the presence of 16.7 mmglucose, R-467 stimulated insulin secretion at concentrations from 1 to 30 μm. At 10 and 30 μm, the rate of glucose-stimulated insulin release was doubled. At 100 μm, R-467 failed to stimulate release or, in some experiments, decreased the rate of release (data not shown). Similar data were obtained when S-467 was examined over the same concentration range showing that there is no stereoselectivity in the responses (Fig.2). R-467 stimulated insulin secretion in the βHC9 cell at 0.1 mm glucose. Insulin release was 12.1 ± 0.7 pg/1000 cells/30 min at 0.1 mm glucose and 26.4 ± 1.5 pg/1000 cells/30 min in the presence of 10 μm R-467 (p < 0.02, n = 4). Because the calcium receptors in the parathyroid gland and the parafollicular C cells mediate their effects via heterotrimeric G proteins, the possibility of a link to Gi or Go(pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins) was tested. βHC9 cells were incubated for 24 h in the presence of 50 ng/ml pertussis toxin (PTX) and subsequently tested for their responses to 16.7 mm glucose and R-467. As can be seen from the results shown in Fig. 3, 16.7 mmglucose-stimulated insulin secretion was enhanced after PTX treatment, as anticipated from previous data (24.Komatsu M. McDermott A.M. Gillison S.L. Sharp G.W.G. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1857-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, R-467 stimulated insulin secretion to a similar extent, regardless of whether they had been treated with PTX. In positive control experiments, treatment with PTX blocked the effect of norepinephrine to inhibit release. Thus, Gi and Go proteins are not involved in the action of R-467. We next investigated the effect of R-467 on intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) using βHC9 cells and the fura-2 technique. At 1 μm R-467, the threshold concentration for the stimulation of insulin secretion, no increase in [Ca2+]i was detected. At concentrations that caused a marked stimulation of insulin secretion, between 3 and 30 μm, R-467 increased [Ca2+]i at all concentrations tested. Examples of the increase in [Ca2+]i caused by 3 and 10 μm R-467 are shown in Fig.4 (A and B). R-467 did not increase [Ca2+]i in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 4 C), nor did it increase [Ca2+]i in the presence of the voltage-dependent l-type Ca2+-channel blocker nitrendipine (Fig. 4 D). Thus, R-467 is increasing [Ca2+]iby activating, directly or indirectly, the l-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels in the β-cell. In order to activate voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, R-467 must either depolarize the cell or act as an l-type channel agonist as does the pharmacologic agent BayK 8644. Thus, the effect of R-467 on the membrane potential of βHC9 cells was monitored with the membrane potential-sensitive indicator bisoxonol. It was found that R-467 caused a prompt depolarization of the βHC9 cell, thus accounting for the activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and increased [Ca2+]i. In Fig.5 A is shown the depolarizing effect of 10 μm R-467. The next question was how does R-467 depolarize the cell? To answer this, the effect of R-467 on the membrane potential of βHC9 cells was examined using bisoxonol under several different conditions. The results of some of these experiments are shown in Fig. 5. It can be seen that R-467 depolarizes the cell (Fig. 5 A), even after hyperpolarization by a maximally effective concentration of diazoxide (Fig. 5 B), and also after depolarization by 500 μm tolbutamide, which is a maximally effective concentration for inhibition of the ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel (Fig. 5 C). Thus, R-467 is not depolarizing the cell by closing the KATPchannels. Depolarization was also observed in the presence of 100 μm triethylammonium (data not shown), so that the unlikely action to block voltage and Ca2+-activated K+ channels is ruled out. The possibility of a direct action on Ca2+ channels and increased Ca2+entry was also ruled out because R-467 depolarized in the absence of extracellular Ca2 and presence of EGTA (Fig.6 A). The next possibility to be tested was that R-467 might be activating a cation channel other than a Ca2+ channel, with a channel carrying Na+, the most prevalent extracellular cation, being the most likely candidate. Thus, membrane potential was monitored under conditions in which Na+ was absent from the extracellular medium and isosmotically replaced by N-methylglucamine. The results are shown in Fig. 6 B. In the absence of extracellular Na+, R-467 failed to depolarize the βHC9 cell. Thus, Na+ appears to be the charge-carrying source of the depolarization under normal conditions. As depolarization in the presence of Na+ was not affected by tetrodotoxin (Fig.6 C), the most likely explanation for these data is that R-467 activates a nonspecific cation channel that carries mostly Na+. This was confirmed by experiments with maitotoxin, a compound that is known to activate nonspecific cation channels in the β-cell (25.Leech C.A. Habener J.F. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 26.Leech C.A. Habener J.F. J. Biol.

Maitotoxin (1 nm) depolarized the cells and prevented any further depolarization by R-467 (Fig.7 A). In paired cells under control conditions, R-467 (10 μm) depolarized the βHC9 cells as expected.Figure 5The effect of R-467 on the membrane potential of βHC9 cells.

Additionally, it is known that these peptides act via their specific heptahelical receptors, the activation of Gs, and subsequent increase in cyclic AMP levels. Consequently, cyclic AMP was measured in the βHC9 cells in the absence and presence of R-467, and in the presence of forskolin as a positive control. The results are shown in TableI. In the presence of 0.1 mmglucose, 3, 10, and 30 μm R-467, concentrations that depolarize the βHC9 cell and stimulate insulin release, had no effect on the cellular cyclic AMP content. In contrast, 1 μmforskolin used as a positive control induced a large increase in cyclic AMP. Thus, activation of the nonspecific cation channel by R-467 is not due to elevated cyclic AMP levels.Table IThe lack of effect of R-467 on cyclic AMP levels in the βHC9 cell at concentrations (3–30 μm) that depolarize the cell and enhance insulin secretioncAMP contentS.E.fmol/well/3 minControl255 255 29+ R-467 (3 μm) 240 83+ R-467 (10 μm) 240 44+ R-467 (30 μm) 238 42+ Forskolin (1 μm)2767521The increase in cyclic AMP level caused by 1 μm forskolin is shown as a positive control. n = 4.

In additional studies on the mechanism of action, staurosporine and Ro-31-8220, two inhibitors of protein kinase C, had no effect on the stimulation of insulin release by R-467. Therefore, an action to depolarize the β-cell by activation of PKC, as has been noted previously in the RINm5F cell line (28.Yada T. Russo L.L. Sharp G.W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2455-2462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), appears to be unlikely. Further evidence corroborating the idea that R-467 depolarizes the cell, increases [Ca2+]i, and stimulates insulin secretion by activation of a nonspecific cation channel was obtained when the effect of R-467 on [Ca2+]i was examined in Na+-free medium. Under these conditions, in which R-467 failed to depolarize the cell, the compound had no effect on [Ca2+]i (data not shown). The possibility that R-467 could stimulate insulin release by a mechanism (or mechanisms) in addition to its ability to depolarize the cell was tested by seeking an effect of R-467 to enhance insulin secretion under conditions in which the cell was depolarized by 40 mm KCl. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig.8. βHC9 cells were stimulated by depolarization with 40 mm KCl in the presence of 150 μm diazoxide (to block any effects of glucose on the KATP channels) and in the presence of 0.1 and 16.7 mm glucose. Under these conditions, R-467 had no effect on insulin secretion. Thus, it is possible to conclude that R-467 has no action other than depolarization of the β-cell that could contribute to the stimulation of insulin secretion. Electrophysiological studies were performed to confirm the finding that R-467 activates a nonspecific cation channel. The resting membrane potential of βHC9 cells varied between −57 and −61 mV. Application of 10 μm R-467 induced an inward current in 81% of cells studied in extracellular buffer containing 128.8 mm NaCl (Fig. 9 A, n = 26). Preliminary experiments suggest that this current is eliminated when cells are perfused with Na+-free buffer after R-467 application. The mean peak current was 1.15 ± 0.25 nA (S.E.,n = 21).

All eight His → Ala mutants bind hemin stoichiometrically, proving that none of the histidines is essential for hemin-Hmu O formation. However, His<sup>20</sup> is crucial to Hmu O catalysis. Its absence by point mutation has inhibited the conversion of hemin to biliverdin. The ferric heme-H20A complex is pentacoordinate. Resonance Raman of the CO-bound ferrous heme-H20A corroborates this and reveals an Fe-C-O bending mode, δ(Fe-C-O), the first reported for a pentacoordinate CO-bound hemeprotein. The appearance of δ(Fe-C-O) in <i>C. diphtheriae</i> Hmu O H20A but not mammalian HO-1 mutant H25A indicates that the heme environment between the two heme oxygenases is different."
https://openalex.org/W2165401665,"Abstract Steroid receptors represent a class of transcription regulators that act in part by overcoming the often repressive nature of chromatin to modulate gene activity. The mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter is a useful model for studying transcriptional regulation by steroid hormone receptors in the context of chromatin. The chromatin architecture of the promoter prevents the assembly of basal transcription machinery and binding of ubiquitous transcription factors. However, in human breast carcinoma T47D cells lacking the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), but expressing the progesterone receptor (PR), nucleosome B (nuc B) assumes a constitutively hypersensitive chromatin structure. This correlation led us to test the hypothesis that the chromatin structure of nuc B was dependent on GR expression in T47D cells. To examine this possibility, we stably co-transfected the MMTV promoter and the GR into T47D cells that lacked both the GR and the PR. We found that in T47D cells that lack both the GR and the PR or express only the GR, nuc B assumes a constitutively “open” chromatin structure, which allows hormone independent access by restriction endonucleases and transcription factors. These results suggest that in GR+/pr− T47D cells, the MMTV chromatin structure permits GR transcriptional activation, independent of chromatin remodeling."

New Phytol. 1997; 136: 543-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In the light, electron flow through ferredoxin and ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase maintains Trx in its reduced state, in which vicinal active site sulfhydryls prevail. Reduced Trx can then reduce the regulatory disulfides of target enzymes via sulfhydryl-disulfide exchange. Such reduction activates susceptible biosynthetic enzymes but inactivates susceptible biodegradative enzymes, thereby minimizing the simultaneous functioning of opposing metabolic pathways (5.Buchanan B.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1980; 31: 341-374Crossref Google Scholar). Shortly after the discovery of the ferredoxin-thioredoxin pathway for enzyme regulation, two distinct chloroplastic thioredoxins (denoted Trxf and Trx m) were isolated and characterized (6.Wolosiuk R.A. Crawford N.A. Yee B.C. Buchanan B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1627-1632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological need for two thioredoxins appeared to be a consequence of their preferential selectivity among the array of target enzymes. For example, under the assay conditions described, Trxf was more effective in the activation of NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, sedoheptulose 1,7-bisphosphatase, and PRK, whereas Trx m displayed a preference for NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (3.Buchanan B.B.

Armed with this background, we initiated an effort to identify recognition and selectivity determinants of Trx f by utilization of site-directed mutagenesis. During the course of our earlier study (10.Geck M.K. Larimer F.W. Hartman F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24736-24740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that Trx f is kinetically superior to Trx m as an activator for both fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase. Because this unexpected finding contradicted the generally accepted explanation for the presence of two chloroplastic thioredoxins, we felt it only prudent to extend kinetic analyses to another redox-sensitive enzyme and accordingly have selected PRK. PRK catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation ofd-ribulose 5-phosphate to formd-ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate, the requisite acceptor of CO2 in photosynthetic carbon fixation. This chloroplast enzyme, a homodimer with a subunit molecular weight of ∼40,000 (11.Porter M.A. Milanez S. Stringer C.D. Hartman F.C. Arch. Bioch. Biophys. 1986; 245: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), is reversibly inactivated by formation of an intrasubunit disulfide between Cys16 and Cys55 (12.Porter M.A. Stringer C.D. Hartman F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 123-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Even though both of these regulatory cysteinyl residues are located in the ATP-binding domain of the active site, neither is crucial to activity. The free sulfhydryl of Cys55 is only moderately facilitative of catalysis, whereas that of Cys16 has no effect whatsoever on activity (13.Brandes H.K. Hartman F.C. Lu T.-Y. Larimer F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6490-6496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Total loss of kinase activity, which accompanies oxidation, reflects a combination of masking the sulfhydryl of Cys55 and introducing a conformational constraint as imposed by the disulfide (13.Brandes H.K.

These include Trx dependence of light activation of PRK in reconstituted systems (2.Wolosiuk R.A. Buchanan B.B. Arch. Biochem.

However, the relative kinetic efficiency of Trx f and Trx m in the activation of purified PRK has not been determined. Herein, we report such a comparison and also the effectiveness of several site-directed mutants of Trx f, designed to more closely resemble Trxm, as activators of PRK. Several of the mutant thioredoxins (K58E, ΔN74, N74D, Q75D, and ΔN77) were described in our earlier report with respect to their ability to activate NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (10.Geck M.K. Larimer F.W. Hartman F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24736-24740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Additionally, two newly engineered variants of Trx f are also examined: T105I and the double mutant V89I/T105I. The following materials were obtained from the sources indicated: DTNB, Fisher Scientific; DTT and buffers, Research Organics; and PRK assay reagents, bovine serum albumin, and BME, Sigma. Spinach Rubisco was purified according to a published protocol (21.Wishnick M. Lane M.D. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 23: 570-577Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Construction, expression, and purification of recombinant Trxf and many of the site-directed mutants thereof used in the present study have been described (10.Geck M.K. Larimer F.W. Hartman F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24736-24740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Two new site-directed mutants were generated using this previously published protocol and the following primers: pGGCATCAGAGTAATTCCTACTTTCAAGATT for V89I conversion and the aforementioned primer in conjunction with pGTGGGAGAAGTTATAGGGGCAAAATATGAT for V89I/T105I. These electrophoretically pure protein preparations (>5 mg/ml) were stored at −80 °C in 50 mm Bicine-NaOH (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm EDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mmDTT. Purified recombinant spinach Trx m was kindly provided by Professor Peter Schürmann of the Université de Neuchâtel in Switzerland. The sample, received in lyophilized form, was resuspended in 50 mm Bicine-NaOH (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm EDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mmDTT to a final concentration of ∼5 mg/ml, dialyzed overnight against the same buffer, and stored at −80 °C prior to use. During the course of the present study, authentic PRK isolated from spinach leaves (11.Porter M.A. Milanez S. Stringer C.D. Hartman F.C. Arch. Bioch. Biophys. 1986; 245: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 12.Porter M.A. Stringer C.D. Hartman F.C. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1998; 350: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) were both used. In all cases, the preparations were virtually homogenous and indistinguishable as judged by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. However, their specific activities were somewhat variable, ranging from 260 to 358 units/mg. Prior to DTNB-oxidative inactivation of PRK to prepare the substrate for the Trx activation studies (see below), the preparations of PRK (>20 mg/ml) were stored at −80 °C in 40 mmBicine-KOH (pH 8.0), 0.8 mm EDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm DTT. Typically, the inactive DTNB-oxidized samples regained 90–95% of their original activity upon incubation with 50 mm DTT for 15 min. Prior to oxidation of PRK, exogenous thiol was removed from the purified preparation by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 equilibrated with 40 mm Bicine-KOH (pH 8.0), 0.8 mm EDTA. Oxidation was then performed by treatment of PRK (3–10 mg/ml) with a 20% molar excess (relative to subunit concentration) of DTNB at 25 °C until PRK activity could no longer be detected (∼5 min). The DTNB reaction mixture was then exhaustively dialyzed against 50 mm Bicine-KOH (pH 8), 1 mmEDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol. Stock solutions of the oxidized kinase were stored at −80 °C at a concentration of approximately 5 mg/ml. Previous studies have demonstrated that the loss of kinase activity upon incubation with DTNB is concomitant with the formation of a single disulfide bond per subunit of PRK between Cys16 and Cys55, with no other modifications detected (12.Porter M.A. Stringer C.D. Hartman F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 123-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, DTNB-oxidized PRK can be regarded as comparable with the enzyme present in the darkened chloroplast. PRK (0.08 mg/ml, 2 μmsubunit) was activated at 25 °C by the indicated concentrations of DTT, BME, GSH, or Trx (in the presence of low molecular weight thiol) in buffered solutions (25 μl) of 40 mm Bicine-KOH (pH 8.0) and 0.8 mm EDTA. Periodically, 5-μl aliquots were withdrawn for the determination of kinase activity at 25 °C. Assay solutions (1 ml) consisted of 50 mm Bicine-KOH (pH 8.0), 40 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.3 mm NADH, 5 units of pyruvate kinase, 6 units of lactate dehydrogenase, 0.8 mm ribulose 5-phosphate. The latter was prepared by incubation of 150 mm ribose 5-phosphate and approximately 2 units of the phosphoriboisomerase at room temperature for 30 min in 1.3 ml of 50 mm Bicine-KOH (pH 8.0), 40 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2; 20 μl of this solution was used per 1-ml assay. The formation of NAD+ was followed spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. One unit of PRK activity corresponds to an absorbance change of 6.22/min. When activation rates are expressed as milliunits/min, the reflected amount of protein is 2.0 μg. Several considerations prompted the inclusion of a low molecular weight thiol in reaction mixtures for the examination of the activation of PRK by Trx. Because the redox potentials of PRK, Trx f, and Trxm are virtually identical (23.Hirasawa M. Schürmann P. Jacquot J.-P. Manieri W. Jacquot P. Keryer E. Hartman F.C. Knaff D.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5200-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), complete activation of oxidized PRK will not occur upon incubation with Trx. Furthermore, even with rather stringent precautions to mitigate oxidation, aqueous solutions of reduced Trx tend to accumulate some of the oxidized form, which will further impede activation of PRK. Finally, maintaining all of the Trx in its reduced state is necessary to achieve pseudo first-order kinetics of activation of PRK and thus accurate determination of those kinetic parameters being sought. Inclusion of an exogenous thiol in PRK-Trx reaction mixtures does, however, introduce an unavoidable complication because of the potential for PRK activation by the added thiol. PRK is known to undergo activation by DTT (2.Wolosiuk R.A. Buchanan B.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 189: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 15.Latzko E. Garnier R. Gibbs M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 39: 1140-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 18.Fischer K. Latzko E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 89: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), but the associated kinetics have not been thoroughly examined. Thus, prerequisite to analyses of Trx-dependent activation of PRK, the rate at which DTT activates PRK was quantified. The abilities of BME and GSH to activate PRK were also determined in an effort to identify a reagent that was unable to activate PRK but would nevertheless maintain Trx in its reduced state. At rather high concentrations, GSH (100 mm) and the nonphysiological reductants DTT (20 mm) and BME (50 mm) are all capable of fully activating PRK (Fig.1). The somewhat slower rates observed with the two monothiols are consistent with their lower reduction potentials relative to that of DTT (24.Szajewski R.P. Whitesides G.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 2011-2026Crossref Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 25.Gilbert H.F. Adv. Enzymol. 1990; 63: 69-172PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Lees W.J. Whitesides G.M. J. Org. Chem. 1993; 58: 642-647Crossref Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Lower concentrations of the thiols (e.g. 2 mm), despite ∼1000-fold molar excess over PRK, lead to only partial activation, presumably because of establishment of equilibrium. With DTT and BME, the initial rates of activation were directly proportional to the concentration of reductant (i.e. pseudo first-order kinetics); the calculated second-order rate constants (k 2nd) were 5.4m−1 min−1 for DTT and 0.7m−1 min−1 for BME. By contrast, activation of PRK by GSH, either alone or in the presence of a fixed concentration of DTT, exhibits saturation kinetics with respect to the concentration of GSH (Fig. 2). In the absence of DTT, k 2nd was 0.6m−1 min−1 with aV max of 20 milliunits/min and anS 0.5 of 24 mm. In the presence of 4 mm DTT, k 2nd was 2.9m−1 min−1 with aV max of 12 milliunits/min and anS 0.5 of 5 mm. The plot in Fig. 2, from which these latter values are derived, is corrected for the contribution of DTT to the activation.Figure 2Initial rates of PRK activation by GSH in the absence (●) and presence (○) of 4 mm DTT. Data were fit to the simplified Hill equation of v =V max[S] n /(K′ + [S] n), whereby n is the calculated value for the apparent number of binding sites. The activation data points shown with GSH in the presence of DTT have been corrected for the extent of activation brought about by 4 mm DTT alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because each of the thiols tested is able to activate the oxidized form of PRK, the enhancements of activation rates by Trx fagainst a background of DTT (0.5 mm) or BME (2 mm) were compared. As shown in Fig.3, very little differential activation by Trx occurs in the presence of BME, whereas dramatic stimulation of activation takes place in the presence of DTT. Apparently, the reduction potential of BME is insufficient to maintain all of the Trx in the reduced form. Likewise, Trx f provided little enhancement of PRK activation as induced by GSH (data not shown). Thus, subsequent activation kinetics of PRK by Trx were determined in the presence of 4 mm DTT to ensure that Trx remained fully reduced. To determine the dependence of activation rate on the concentration of Trx, molar ratios of [Trx]/[PRK] ≥ 5 were used so that [Trx]free would approximate [Trx]totaland activation kinetics would be pseudo-first-order. Estimation of initial rates of activation was based on data collected over the range of 0–30% of the full activation level having been achieved. This range represents the linear phase of the activation curves. The Trx-dependent rate of activation (i.e. the activation rate corrected for the basal rate because of DTT alone) did not vary significantly in the presence of 1–4 mm DTT, thereby verifying that Trx remained fully reduced throughout the course of PRK activation. Initial rates of activation, extracted from time courses and corrected for the contribution of DTT, are plotted as a function of Trxf or Trx m concentration in Fig.4. The Trx concentration dependence curves exhibit sigmoidicity, as typifies interactions of Trx with target proteins (10.Geck M.K. Larimer F.W. Hartman F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24736-24740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 27.Schürmann P. Maeda K. Tsugita A. Eur. J.

The plot shown for Trx fyields an S 0.5 of 17 μm and aV max of 7 milliunits/min. Trx m is modestly more efficient than Trx f as an activator of PRK because of its higher V max (11 milliunits/min) but virtually identical S 0.5 (15 μm). In another kinetic study with Trx f in which the activation mixture contained a 10-fold lower concentration of oxidized PRK (i.e., 0.2 μm subunit), very similar S 0.5 and V maxvalues were obtained (data not shown). Because of literature reports that implicate in vivocomplexation of PRK with various chloroplast proteins, includingd-ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (reviewed in Ref. 30.Romanova A.K. Pavlovets V.V. Russian J. Plant Physiol. 1997; 44: 230-238Google Scholar), the potential influence of this protein on the activation of PRK by Trx f and Trx m were determined. In a separate experiment, bovine serum albumin was used as a generic protein to substitute for the carboxylase. Neither the carboxylase (at 2-fold molar excesses relative to PRK subunits) nor bovine serum albumin (at 8-fold molar excess) significantly stimulates the activation of PRK by either thioredoxin (data not shown). The site-directed mutants of Trx f, designed to be more akin to Trx m, were also analyzed kinetically in the activation of PRK; in all cases the Trx concentration dependence curves were sigmoidal as with the wild-type proteins and qualitatively analogous to those illustrated for T105I and V89I/T105I in Fig.5. The derived kinetic parameters for all of the mutants are compiled in Table I. All of the mutants are somewhat impaired with respect to binding of PRK, as judged by their S 0.5 values, which range from 1.4- to 5-fold greater than that of wild-type Trx f. Except for K58E, the mutants display enhancedV max values. However, in the cases of N74D, ΔN74, ΔN77, and Q75D, the increased rates of reduction of PRK are counterbalanced by the weakened interactions with PRK, whereby the overall efficiencies of activation (i.e. V max/S 0.5 values) are virtually unchanged or decreased about 2-fold. Only with T105I and V89I/T105I are the efficiencies of activation increased.Table IActivation of PRK by thioredoxins at 25 °CThioredoxinS 0.5V maxV max/S 0.5μmmilliunits PRK/minmilliunits/min/μm × 100Wild-type Trx f17741Wild-type Trx m151173Trxf-K58E23417Trxf-ΔN74522038Trxf-N74D321032Trxf-Q75D921516Trxf-ΔN77471838Trxf-T105I664264Trxf-V89I/T105I473779Individual determinations of S 0.5 andV max are within 10% of the stated values.

The overarching goal of the present study was to compare the kinetic efficiencies of Trx f and Trx m as activators of oxidized PRK. If initial rate determinations are to be valid and reproducible, the Trx must be maintained in its fully reduced form, which can be achieved by the addition of an exogenous low molecular weight thiol to the Trx reaction mixtures. However, the incomplete and contradictory literature concerning activation of PRK by thiols compelled us to screen several to identify appropriate conditions for the Trx experiments. Of the three examined, only DTT met the criterion of clearly discernible Trx-dependent activation of PRK at a rate independent of the concentration of the added thiol. Despite counter literature reports (31.Wolosiuk R.A. Corley E. Crawford N. Buchanan B.B. FEBS Lett. 1985; 189: 212-216Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 32.Clasper S. Chelvarajan R. Easterby J.S. Powls R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1209: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), both BME and glutathione can also fully activate PRK; they do not, however, support Trx-dependent activation, presumably because of their weaker reduction potentials, which allow build-up of oxidized Trx, thereby driving the equilibrium in favor of oxidized PRK. We were prompted to examine the activation of PRK by GSH in some detail because of its high natural abundance in chloroplasts (4 mm) (33.Law M. Charles S. Halliwell B. Biochem. J. 1983; 210: 899-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar) and hence the obvious question of whether it might play some role in the regulation of PRK. The rate saturation kinetics relative to the concentration of GSH were unexpected. Reduction of the PRK disulfide by a monothiol entails two consecutive bimolecular reactions: formation of a proteinS-SG mixed disulfide followed by intermolecular displacement by GSH to form GSSG and the reduced protein. Irrespective of the relative rates of the two reactions, the overall rate of PRK activation should be directly proportional to the concentration of GSH. Our counterintuitive finding of rate saturation argues that GSH and PRK form a noncovalent complex prior to the initial sulfhydryl/disulfide exchange reaction. Although the apparent affinity of GSH for PRK is rather weak (S 0.5 = 24 mm), the activation V max (20 milliunits/min) is about 2-fold greater than the corresponding values for either Trx. In these experiments, the concentration of GSSG should increase stoichiometrically with PRK reduction. However, in chloroplasts, the action of NADP-dependent glutathione reductase maintains GSH predominantly in its reduced form. Thus, we also examined the reduction of PRK by GSH in the presence of a fixed concentration of 4 mm DTT. Under these conditions, theS 0.5 is decreased substantially to 5 mm, closely matching the concentration of GSH in chloroplasts. This decrease likely reflects relief of inhibition of PRK activation by GSSG. We attribute the apparent 2-fold drop inV max to competition between DTT and GSH in their interaction with PRK. This conclusion follows from the observation that the V max, uncorrected for the contribution of DTT alone, is about the same as the GSH-dependentV max determined in the absence of DTT. The kinetic parameters as determined for the activation of PRK by GSH are not incompatible with the latter influencing the PRK activity levels in chloroplasts; however, this possibility must be tempered by measurements that indicate little fluctuation in the in vivoconcentration of GSH or the [GSH]/[GSSG] molar ratio (33.Law M. Charles S. Halliwell B. Biochem. J. 1983; 210: 899-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). With respect to kinetic characterizations of the activation of PRK by Trx f and Trx m, our data clearly show that the two thioredoxins are quite similar in their effectiveness with modest superiority of Trx m being attributable to an ∼2-fold greater V max. In the initial study of target enzyme selectivity of chloroplasts thioredoxins at the time of their discovery, Trx f was judged to be more effective than Trxm in the activation of PRK (6.Wolosiuk R.A. Crawford N.A. Yee B.C. Buchanan B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1627-1632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This judgment was based on a 2.5-fold greater end point activity that was attained with a single concentration of Trx f in comparison to Trx m. Separate experiments, again at single concentrations of thioredoxins, actually showed only slightly faster rates of activation of PRK by Trxf than by Trx m. Thus, the perpetuation of the notion of clear-cut superiority of Trx f seems to have been based on undue focus on one data set to the exclusion of the other. We would also note that the use of impure preparations of thioredoxins and an unstable form of PRK complexed with NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in the prior investigation could have influenced the activation kinetics. Although our present study is the first to provide a detailed comparison of activation kinetics of PRK by Trx f and Trxm, activation kinetics with Trx f have been determined previously (34.Rault M. Gontero B. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 35.Gontero B. Mulliert G. Rault M. Giudici-Orticoni M.-T. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). An apparent dissociation constant of 0.8 μm was reported for the PRK-Trx f complex as calculated from the Trx concentration dependence of levels of activated PRK reached at equilibrium. However, the rates of PRK activation increased over the range from 1 to 10 μm (the highest concentration examined) Trx and thus appear consistent with ourS 0.5 of 17 μm. In our prior study (10.Geck M.K. Larimer F.W. Hartman F.C. J. Biol.

Our previous work has shown that long term treatment of mucus-secreting HT-29 cells with GalNAc-α-O-benzyl reversibly inhibits sialylation and causes the accumulation of apical glycoproteins in cytoplasmic vesicles. We have analyzed at the biochemical level the effects of GalNAc-α-O-benzyl on glycoprotein processing. Both apical and basolateral membrane glycoproteins were sialylated, but GalNAc-α-O-benzyl selectively inhibited the sialylation of apical glycoproteins. In addition, lysosomal α-glucosidase, which is partially targeted to the apical membrane, was abnormally processed leading to the accumulation of an immature molecular species. Several findings support the conclusion that accumulation of this protein occurs in a post-trans-Golgi network (TGN) compartment: 1) it is partially sialylated; 2) it does not occur when glycoprotein exit from the TGN is blocked at 20 °C; 3) upon Triton X-114 partition, it distributes to the aqueous phase, a characteristic that is acquired in a post-TGN compartment; and 4) its appearance is inhibited when cells are cultured in the presence of NH4Cl. The processing of cathepsin D was also found to be affected by GalNAc-α-O-benzyl treatment. In conclusion, GalNAc-α-O-benzyl selectively inhibits sialylation of apical glycoproteins and perturbs lysosomal enzyme processing; these effects occur in a post-TGN acidic compartment and are reminiscent of the alterations found in sialic acid storage diseases.

Epithelial cell lines that form a polarized monolayer provide usefulin vitro systems to examine the signals involved in targeting. A series of subpopulations derived from HT-29 colon cancer cells have been obtained that exhibit various types of differentiated features (17.Lesuffleur T. Barbat A. Dussaulx E. Zweibaum A.

Barbat A. Dussaulx E. Zweibaum A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6334-6343PubMed Google Scholar); the mucins produced by these cells contain mainly O-glycans with core 1 structure, in particular NeuAcα2,3-Galβ1–3GalNAc (19.Hennebicq-Reig S.

To examine the relevance of glycosylation in mucin biosynthesis and secretion in mucus-secreting HT-29 cells, we have previously used the sugar analogue GalNAc-α-O-benzyl (BG)1 (19.Hennebicq-Reig S.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1311-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). BG was initially reported to selectively inhibit O-glycosylation through its ability to compete with GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr for the β1–3galactosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis ofO-glycans (23.Kuan S.F. Byrd J.C. Basbaum C. Kim Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19271-19277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, short exposure (24 h) of mucus-secreting HT-29 cells to 5 mm BG resulted in a 13-fold decrease in the levels of mucin-associated sialic acid and an increase of T antigen, suggesting that the major step inhibited by treatment with this sugar analogue was sialylation rather than the transfer of Gal to GalNAc-α-O-Ser/Thr (20.Huet G. Kim I. de Bolós C. Lo-Guidice J.M. Moreau O. Hemon B. Richet C. Delannoy P. Real F.X. Degand P. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1275-1285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These effects were associated with the metabolism of GalNAc-α-O-benzyl to Galβ1–3GalNAc-α-O-benzyl, which is a potent competitor of the α2,3-sialyltransferase activity present in HT-29 cell extracts (20.Huet G. Kim I. de Bolós C. Lo-Guidice J.M. Moreau O. Hemon B. Richet C. Delannoy P. Real F.X. Degand P. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1275-1285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Delannoy P. Kim I. Emery N. de Bolós C. Verbert A. Degand P. Huet G. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To examine in more detail the effects of BG on mucin biosynthesis and secretion, mucus-secreting and undifferentiated HT-29 cells were cultured for 20 days in the presence of 2 mm BG; this was associated with a 6-fold increase in cell volume, an accumulation of small cytoplasmic vesicles containing electron-lucid material, a marked decrease in the sialylation of cellular glycoproteins, and a dramatic alteration in the subcellular distribution of apical glycoproteins (22.Huet G. Hennebicq-Reig S. de Bolós C. Ulloa F. Lesuffleur T. Barbat A. Carriere V. Kim I. Real F.X. Delannoy P. Zweibaum A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1311-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These effects were fully reversible upon withdrawal of the drug. BG appeared to selectively affect apical glycoproteins, such as MUC1, dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPP-IV), and carcinoembryonic antigen. The basolateral glycoprotein gp120 and non-glycosylated apical proteins, such as villin and ZO-1, did not accumulate in cytoplasmic vesicles as determined using immunofluorescence microscopy (22.Huet G. Hennebicq-Reig S. de Bolós C. Ulloa F. Lesuffleur T. Barbat A. Carriere V. Kim I. Real F.X. Delannoy P. Zweibaum A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1311-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition, immunoprecipitation and lectin-blotting experiments showed that, in control cells, apical glycoproteins express NeuAcα2,3-Gal-R reactive with the sialic acid-specific Maackia amurensis lectin (MAL); by contrast, apical glycoproteins immunoprecipitated from BG-treated cells display a decreased sialylation, a loss of reactivity with MAL, and an increased reactivity with peanut agglutinin (PNA), a lectin that binds Gal-R (22.Huet G. Hennebicq-Reig S. de Bolós C. Ulloa F. Lesuffleur T. Barbat A. Carriere V. Kim I. Real F.X. Delannoy P. Zweibaum A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1311-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). When BG is removed from the cultures, sialylation is recovered. We and others have proposed that the effects of BG may be due to the accumulation of BG-derived metabolites that inhibit α2,3 sialyltransferases (20.Huet G. Kim I. de Bolós C. Lo-Guidice J.M.

These results led to the analysis of the reactivity of sialic acid-reactive lectins with mucus-secreting HT-29 cells, and sialic acid appeared to be restricted to the apical membrane, as determined by confocal immunofluorescence. This finding, together with the effect of BG on apical but not basolateral glycoproteins, led us to propose a possible role for sialic acid in processes related to apical targeting (22.Huet G. Hennebicq-Reig S. de Bolós C. Ulloa F. Lesuffleur T. Barbat A. Carriere V. Kim I. Real F.X. Delannoy P. Zweibaum A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1311-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In this work we have aimed at analyzing in closer detail at the biochemical level the presence of sialic acid in apical and basolateral glycoproteins, as well as the effects of BG on the processing of apical, basolateral, and lysosomal glycoproteins in polarized mucus-secreting HT-29 cells. Several glycoproteins from each of these groups were selected in order to assess if similar changes take place in proteins having a common destination and to rule out that the observed effects reflect the particular behavior of a given protein. DPP-IV and aminopeptidase N (APN) are brush-border-associated enzymes expressed in the apical membrane of intestinal cells; integrins are heterodimeric glycoproteins destined to the basolateral membrane, where the gp525 glycoprotein also localizes; acid α-glucosidase (AAG) and cathepsin D are lysosomal enzymes that undergo proteolytic processing to generate a mature isoform. In this work, we present biochemical evidence that: 1) BG perturbs the intracellular processing of apical glycoproteins as well as lysosomal enzymes, but not of basolateral glycoproteins; 2) despite its selective effects on apical glycoproteins, both apical and basolateral glycoproteins are sialylated; and 3) altered processing of lysosomal enzymes occurs in a post-trans Golgi network (TGN) acidic compartment. The alterations found in HT-29 cells treated with BG are reminiscent of those present in cells from patients with sialic acid storage diseases (SASD). DMEM and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Glasgow, United Kingdom (UK)). All chemicals used were of the highest chemical grade and were purchased, unless otherwise indicated, from Sigma.

Cells were cultured as indicated above and used for metabolic labeling 10 days after seeding, unless otherwise indicated.

In the case of cells treated with the drug, the medium was supplemented with 2 mm BG. Cells were washed three times with PBS, lysed with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 1% Triton X-100, 62.5 mm EDTA, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin for 30 min at 4 °C, and lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. All immunoprecipitation steps were carried out at 4 °C. Supernatants were precleared with preimmune rabbit antiserum for 2 h and Protein A-Sepharose for 30 min (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). Antibodies were added to the precleared supernatants for 3–16 h in the presence of 0.2% SDS. When using mAbs, rabbit anti-mouse Ig (Dako) was added for 2 h. Immune complexes were isolated using Protein A-Sepharose A protein for 2 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.15M NaCl), three times with TNEN high salt buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS), and twice with PBS. Immunoprecipitates were resuspended in sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and revealed by fluorography. 14C-Labeled standards (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK) were used to estimate the molecular mass. For digestion with endoglycosidase H (endo H), immunoprecipitates were boiled for 5 min in 0.1 mphosphate buffer, pH 6.1, containing 1% SDS and 50 mmEDTA, diluted 10-fold in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.1 containing protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 100 μg/ml benzamidine HCl, 100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor), and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and divided in two aliquots, to one of which 2 milliunits of endo H (Genzyme, Boston, MA) was added. Samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped with sample buffer. For neuraminidase treatment, immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 20 mm acetate buffer pH 5, containing 5 mm CaCl2 and 20 milliunits of neuraminidase from Arthrobacter ureafaciens (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), incubated at 37 °C for 3 h, washed with 10 mm Tris/HCl, and resuspended in sample buffer. Triton X-114 phase separation was performed as described elsewhere (29.Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were solubilized in 1% Triton X-114, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were warmed at 30 °C; 5 min later, detergent and water phases were separated by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 1 min at room temperature. This procedure was repeated three times. Ultrastructural analysis of the distribution of AAG in HT-29 M6 and Caco-2 cells 21 days after seeding and in normal human colon was performed using procedures described in detail elsewhere (30.Egea G. Francı́ C. Gambús G. Lesuffleur T. Zweibaum A. Real F.X. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 819-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cell monolayers or tissues were fixed sequentially with 3% paraformaldehyde and 0.1–0.5% glutaraldehyde, rinsed, and embedded in Lowicryl K4M at −35 °C. Ultrathin sections were cut and placed on parlodion/carbon-coated nickel grids. Sections were floated on a droplet of PBS and incubated with rabbit anti-AAG antibodies for 2 h at 22 °C in a moist chamber. After two washes with PBS, sections were floated on a droplet of Protein A-gold (15 nm) for 1 h. After washing with PBS and distilled water, droplets were allowed to dry and were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Controls included the use of normal rabbit serum at the same dilution as the anti-AAG serum. We have previously shown that long term treatment of HT-29 M6 cells with 2 mm BG induces a dramatic accumulation of cytoplasmic vesicles containing apical glycoproteins. Among them are DPP-IV, carcinoembryonic antigen, and MUC1. By contrast, non-glycosylated apical proteins, such as villin or ZO-1, and the basolateral glycoprotein gp120 display a normal subcellular distribution (22.Huet G. Hennebicq-Reig S. de Bolós C. Ulloa F. Lesuffleur T. Barbat A. Carriere V. Kim I. Real F.X. Delannoy P. Zweibaum A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1311-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These changes are already detectable after culture of cells for 7 days in the presence of the drug (data not shown); this time point was selected for labeling because uptake of radiolabeled amino acids is higher under these conditions than at day 21 of culture. To examine the effects of BG at the biochemical level, HT-29 M6 cells were treated with the drug starting on day 3 after seeding until day 10, when metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation of marker apical and basolateral membrane glycoproteins were performed. After 1 h of pulse with [35S]Met/Cys and in the absence of a chase period, immunoprecipitates obtained using anti-DPP-IV antibodies showed two components: the higher mobility one, designated DPP-IVi and representing the immature protein, showed a similar apparent molecular mass (93 kDa) in control and BG-treated cells. By contrast, the component with a lower mobility, corresponding to mature DPP-IV, migrated differently in control and in BG-treated cells: its estimated molecular mass was 112 kDa in control untreated cells (DPP-IVc) and 107 kDa in BG-treated cells (DPP-IVbg). At all chase time points, only the slower migrating component, corresponding to mature DPP-IV, was detected and DPP-IVbg always showed a greater mobility than DPP-IVc from control cultures (Fig.1). The half-life of DPP-IV was similar in control and BG-treated cells (Fig. 1). Using anti-APN antibodies, the immunoprecipitated molecules showed a similar migration 1 h after chase; by contrast, after 3 h of chase and at all later time points, APN from BG-treated cells (APNbg) showed a slightly higher mobility than APN from control cells (APNc). Their estimated molecular masses were 123 and 128 kDa, respectively. Unlike these two apical glycoproteins, the electrophoretic mobility of three basolateral glycoproteins, gp525, β4 integrin, and α6 integrin was undistinguishable in control and BG-treated cells. BG did not affect the half-lives of these glycoproteins (Fig. 1). The same results were obtained when SDS-PAGE gels with variable composition (6–12%) were used in order to increase the resolution of the electrophoretic analysis. These results confirm and extend our previous findings (22.Huet G. Hennebicq-Reig S. de Bolós C. Ulloa F. Lesuffleur T. Barbat A. Carriere V. Kim I. Real F.X. Delannoy P. Zweibaum A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1311-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). BG has been shown to decrease the sialylation of glycoproteins in HT-29 cells, likely as a result of the ability of BG-derived metabolites to inhibit sialyltransferases such as ST3Gal I, the main sialyltransferase expressed in these cells (21.Delannoy P. Kim I. Emery N. de Bolós C. Verbert A. Degand P. Huet G. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 22.Huet G. Hennebicq-Reig S. de Bolós C. Ulloa F. Lesuffleur T. Barbat A. Carriere V. Kim I. Real F.X. Delannoy P. Zweibaum A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1311-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To determine if this effect might be responsible for the observed change in electrophoretic mobility of apical glycoproteins, we analyzed the sialylation of apical and basolateral glycoproteins in cells cultured in the absence or in the presence of BG by treating immunoprecipitated molecules with neuraminidase and analyzing their electrophoretic behavior. As shown in Fig. 2, the migration of DPP-IV from control and BG-treated cells increased after neuraminidase treatment and desialylated DPP-IV from both cultures showed the same mobility, indicating that BG reduces, but does not abolish, sialylation of DPP-IV and suggesting that it does not affect other glycosylation steps. The electrophoretic mobility of the basolateral glycoproteins gp525, β4 integrin, and α6 integrin increased upon neuraminidase treatment, indicating that they are sialylated. The observed shift and the mobility of the neuraminidase-treated molecules were undistinguishable in control and BG-treated cells. These findings indicate that basolateral glycoproteins are also sialylated and that differential sialylation of apical and basolateral glycoproteins does not account for the selective effects of BG on apical glycoproteins. To determine the extent of the effects of BG on glycoprotein traffic, we examined its ability to affect the endosomal-lysosomal pathway. AAG was chosen because: 1) a fraction of its precursor form has been shown to be targeted selectively to the apical membrane in Caco-2 colon cancer cells (31.Klumperman J. Fransen J.A. Boekestijn T.C. Oude Elferink R.P. Matter K. Hauri H.P. Tager J.M. Ginsel L.A. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 100: 339-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); 2) it allows the topological dissection of the effects of BG as, after glycosylation in the Golgi complex, it is processed by stepwise proteolytic cleavage in a post-trans Golgi network compartment (32.Oude Elferink R.P.J.

Real F.X. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). First, we examined whether AAG also has a selective apical membrane distribution in HT-29 M6 cells using immunocytochemical techniques. Confocal microscopy did not yield conclusive results due to low levels of fluorescence. Using immunoelectron microscopy, AAG was detected in lysosomes in HT-29 M6 cells (data not shown). Fig.3 A illustrates the detection of AAG in the apical membrane, in close association with microvilli (Fig. 3 A, arrows) and its absence from the basolateral membrane (Fig. 3 A, arrowheads). Similarly, AAG was detected in the apical membrane of Caco-2 cells and normal colonic epithelial cells. The precursor form of AAG was mainly secreted through the apical route. HT-29 M6 cells were cultured in Transwells and 21 days after seeding; when the monolayer was impermeable, cells were labeled with [35S]Met/Cys for 1 h. After 36 h of chase, AAG was immunoprecipitated from apical and basolateral medium; as shown in Fig. 3 (B andC), >80% of AAG was secreted to the apical compartment. AAG is synthesized as a polypeptide of 97 kDa that is glycosylated and phosphorylated, yielding a precursor form of 110 kDa that is subsequently proteolytically processed to an intermediate form of 95–100 kDa, and to mature forms of 70–76 kDa (33.Wisselaar H.A. Kroos M.A. Hermans M.M.P. van Beeumen J. Reuser A.J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2223-2231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In HT-29 M6 cells cultured in the absence of BG, only the precursor form is detected after a 1-h pulse and 3 h of chase. After 24 h of chase, the three forms of AAG are detected in control cells and the expected processing is observed thereafter (34.Franci C. Egea G. Arribas R. Reuser A.J. Real F.X. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) (Fig.4). By contrast, in the presence of BG, all de novo synthesized protein is partially processed to a 100-kDa speci"

We have investigated the transcriptional mechanisms responsible for this differential expression. Mapping of DNase I-hypersensitive sites throughout theFGF-3 gene and the region extending 15 kilobases upstream disclosed differences in the patterns obtained between tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic cells. Transient expression assays carried out with a reporter gene driven by FGF-3 promoter fragments of various lengths (0.143 to 11 kilobases) did not reproduce the differential regulation of the resident gene between the two cell types. The same constructs did exhibit a differential activity in stable transfectants, suggesting the involvement of a chromatin-based mechanism in this regulation. Under these conditions, even the 143-base pair minimal promoter fragment was able to drive the differential expression of the reporter gene. During the course of these analyses, several transcriptional modulatory elements (mainly activators) were identified in the FGF-3 upstream region and were found to colocalize with DNase I-hypersensitive sites.

Peters G. Nature. 1987; 326: 833Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). fgf-3 was originally identified as a proto-oncogene (at first designated int-2) transcriptionally activated by proviral integration in virally induced mouse mammary tumors (2.Dickson C. Smith R. Brookes S. Peters G. Cell. 1984; 37: 529-536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 3.Nusse R.

Although this complex spatial and temporal pattern of expression suggests a role in multiple developmental processes, mice homozygous for targeted disruption of fgf-3 only show defects in the development of the tail and inner ear (7.Mansour S.L. Goddard J.M. Capecchi M.R. Development. 1993; 117: 13-28PubMed Google Scholar). This is likely due to functional redundancy with several other members of the crowded FGF family, 19 of which have been identified to date (8.Nishimura T. Utsunomiya Y. Hoshikawa M. Ohuchi H. Itoh N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1444: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The kinship of the FGF-3 protein with other well studied FGFs and the expression patterns of fgf-3 in specific embryonic cell types indicate that this gene could play a role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and motility and be endowed with some inductive capacity (9.Dickson C. Deed R. Dixon M. Peters G. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1989; 1: 123-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 10.Goldfarb M. Deed R. MacAllan D. Walther W. Dickson C. Peters G. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 65-71PubMed Google Scholar). With the purpose of elucidating the complex transcriptional regulation of the murine fgf-3 gene, a detailed analysis of the control elements involved in promoter activity has been undertaken by Murakami et al. (11.Murakami A. Grinberg D. Thurlow J. Dickson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5351-5359Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 12.Murakami A. Thurlow J. Dickson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17242-17248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), using as a model system cells of the F9 embryonal carcinoma cell line, which express the gene only after they have been induced to differentiate by the addition of retinoic acid and dibutyryl cyclic AMP. The human FGF-3 gene has been cloned and sequenced (13.Casey G. Smith R. McGillivray D. Peters G. Dickson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 502-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 14.Brookes S. Smith R. Casey G. Dickson C. Peters G. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 429-436PubMed Google Scholar). Only two human cell lines have been reported to express theFGF-3 gene. Low levels of a major 1.7-kb FGF-3mRNA are detectable in the teratocarcinoma cell line Tera-2, only after induction of their differentiation with retinoic acid and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (14.Brookes S. Smith R. Casey G. Dickson C. Peters G. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 429-436PubMed Google Scholar). Constitutive accumulation of a heterogeneous population of FGF-3 transcripts (around 1.5 to 1.8 kb) was observed in tumorigenic clones of the human colon carcinoma cell line SW613-S (15.Galdemard C. Brison O. Lavialle C. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2331-2342PubMed Google Scholar). To our knowledge, up to date FGF-3 expression has not been described in any other human cell line. As a consequence of this situation, very few studies have addressed the question of the mechanisms involved in the transcriptional regulation of the humanFGF-3 gene. Analysis of the mRNA structure indicated that initiation of transcription occurs at four clustered major sites and several minor sites within a GC-rich promoter region (14.Brookes S. Smith R. Casey G. Dickson C. Peters G. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 429-436PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Galdemard C. Brison O. Lavialle C. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2331-2342PubMed Google Scholar). The human colon carcinoma cell line, SW613-S, consists of cells with either a high or a low level amplification of the c-MYCproto-oncogene that are tumorigenic or non-tumorigenic in nude mice, respectively (16.Modjtahedi N.

As mentioned above, the FGF-3 gene is constitutively expressed in cells from tumorigenic clones but is completely silent in those from non-tumorigenic clones. However,FGF-3 expression is induced in c-MYC-transfected cells from non-tumorigenic clones when they are grown in vivo, as tumors in nude mice (15.Galdemard C. Brison O. Lavialle C. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2331-2342PubMed Google Scholar). We are currently interested in studying the transcriptional mechanisms responsible for the differential expression of the FGF-3 gene between the tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic clones of the SW613-S cell line. We have described elsewhere the cloning and sequencing of the 11-kb region of genomic DNA located immediately upstream of the humanFGF-3 gene (see Ref. 20.Djenabi S. Brison O. Galdemard C. Lavialle C. DNA Seq. 1999; 10: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar; EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ data base accession number Y12377). We report here that regulatory elements involved in the transcriptional control of FGF-3 expression are located up to 10 kb upstream of the promoter, and we present a functional analysis of this region. The origins of the SW613-S human colon carcinoma cell line and cell culture conditions have been described previously (16.Modjtahedi N. Lavialle C. Poupon M.F. Landin R.M. Cassingena R. Monier R.

SW613-12A1 is a tumorigenic clone and SW613-B3 and -2G1 are non-tumorigenic clones derived from the SW613-S cell line; 2G1mycP2Tu1 is a cell line established from a tumor induced in a nude mouse by inoculation of 2G1 cells stably transfected with a human c-MYC expression vector (17.Lavialle C. Modjtahedi N. Cassingena R. Brison O. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 335-339PubMed Google Scholar). The EJ cell line, a kind gift of François Dautry (Institut de Recherche sur le Cancer, Villejuif, France), has been shown to be in fact the same as the T24 human bladder carcinoma cell line (21.O'Toole C.M. Povey S. Hepburn P. Franks L.M. Nature. 1983; 301: 429-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Nuclei were prepared essentially as described by Greenberg and Ziff (22.Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B. Nature. 1984; 311: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar). For each cell line, 10 Petri dishes (10 cm in diameter) were seeded at a density of 2 × 106 cells per dish in 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. After 2 days in culture, cells were refed with fresh medium. Twenty four hours later, cells (in log-phase growth) were scraped in their medium, pelleted at 500 × g for 5 min, washed twice with 20 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and centrifuged each time at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. All further procedures until DNase I digestion were carried out on ice or at 4 °C. The cell pellet (usually 1 × 108) was resuspended in 5 ml of TNM buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2), and 5 ml of TNM buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v) were immediately added dropwise while gently vortexing the cell suspension. The tubes were kept on ice for 5 min (lysis monitored by microscopy) and centrifuged at 500 ×g for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the nuclear pellet was washed once with 5 ml of TNM buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (v/v) and centrifuged at 500 × g. Washed nuclei were suspended in 2 ml of TNM buffer, and the suspension was divided into 6 aliquots of 290 μl. A stock solution of DNase I (Sigma catalog number D 4527), at 1 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, 50% glycerol, was calibrated on nuclei in a test experiment and stored at −20 °C. DNase I digestion was initiated by adding 10 μl of appropriately diluted enzyme solutions to give final concentrations of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 μg/ml. After 10 min of incubation at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped by transferring each mixture into a 15-ml polypropylene tube containing 2.7 ml of TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 400 mm NaCl, 2 mm Na2EDTA). Extraction of the DNA was then carried out as described below for whole cells. Extraction of the DNA was performed by the “salting out” procedure described by Miller et al. (23.Miller S.A. Dykes D.D. Polesky H.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (17902) Google Scholar), adapted to cultured cells. Cells from two to four 10-cm diameter Petri dishes (2–5 × 107) were harvested by scraping, pelleted at 500 × g for 5 min, resuspended in 10 ml of PBS, and transferred into a 15-ml polypropylene tube. After centrifugation and a second wash in 10 ml of PBS, the final cell pellet was suspended in 3 ml of TNE buffer. While stirred on a Vortex, each suspension of cells (or DNase I-treated nuclei; see above) was supplemented dropwise with 500 μl of proteinase K (1 mg/ml in TNE buffer), immediately followed by 200 μl of 10% (w/v) SDS. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, 1 ml of a saturated NaCl solution (∼ 6 m) was added, and the tube was shaken vigorously by hand for 15–20 s. The precipitate of SDS and residual proteins was pelleted at 3,000 rpm for 15 min, and the supernatant containing the DNA was transferred to another 15-ml polypropylene tube. Two volumes of ethanol were added and mixed by inverting the tube several times to precipitate the DNA. After washing with 5 ml of 70% ethanol and drying under vacuum, the DNA was redissolved in 2.8 ml of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm Na2EDTA), containing 50 μg of RNase A per ml and incubated at 37 °C for at least 6 h. The salt concentration was then adjusted to 400 mm by the addition of 0.25 ml of 5 m NaCl, and the proteinase K-SDS treatment and salting out procedure were repeated as described above up to the ethanol precipitation step. The DNA precipitate was then transferred into a 1.5-ml Eppendorf microtube containing 1 ml of 70% ethanol, pelleted, dried under vacuum, and redissolved in 100–200 μl of TE buffer. The concentration was determined from the absorbance at 260 nm and adjusted to 1 mg/ml. Genomic DNA was cut with appropriate restriction enzymes and electrophoresed (10 μg of DNA per 7-mm-wide lane) in 0.7% agarose. A mixture of 1 μg of “1-kb DNA ladder” and 500 ng of HindIII-digested λ DNA (both from Life Technologies, Inc.), preheated at 65 °C for 5 min, was run in parallel in the left-most lane as a size marker. Prior to transfer, a photograph of the gel stained with ethidium bromide was taken with a graduated ruler placed next to the marker lane to measure precisely the migration distance of each fragment. Depurination and denaturation of the DNA were achieved by successively treating the gel twice for 10 min with 0.25 n HCl and twice for 15 min with 0.5 n NaOH, 1.5 m NaCl. The DNA was then transferred by capillary onto a neutral nylon membrane (Hybond N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2–3 h, using the 0.5 nNaOH, 1.5 m NaCl solution. After a quick wash in 2× SSPE (1× SSPE is 0.18 m NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 2 mm EDTA), the membrane was air-dried, and the DNA was immobilized by UV irradiation. DNA fragments to be used as probes were excised from recombinant plasmids by digestion with the appropriate enzyme(s), gel-purified, and radiolabeled by the random priming method (Multiprime DNA labeling system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products) to a specific activity of 1–3 × 109 cpm/μg. The probes used were as follows: HX, a 1685-bp HindIII-XhoI fragment subcloned from the insert of recombinant phage λD3 (20.Djenabi S. Brison O. Galdemard C. Lavialle C. DNA Seq. 1999; 10: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar); SB, a 666-bpSacI-BamHI fragment also subcloned from the λD3 insert; SS6 and BK4, a 912-bp SacI and a 1024-bpBamHI-KpnI fragment, respectively, kindly provided by Gordon Peters and Clive Dickson (13.Casey G. Smith R. McGillivray D. Peters G. Dickson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 502-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar); 5′SK, a 489-bpSacI-KpnI fragment corresponding to the 5′ end of probe SS6 (see Fig. 2 for the position of all 5 probes). Hybridization was carried out as described previously (15.Galdemard C. Brison O. Lavialle C. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2331-2342PubMed Google Scholar). The membranes were then exposed to Kodak Biomax x-ray films, and the size of each radioactive band was determined with reference to the migration distance of the DNA marker fragments, previously measured as described above. The construction of plasmids pGCAT-C and pUSCAT-C, as well as that of the corresponding positive control plasmids, pSVGCAT-C and pUSSVCAT-C, containing the SV40 virus early promoter, have been reported (24.Frebourg T. Brison O. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 65: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 25.Gunther M. Frebourg T. Laithier M. Fossar N. Bouziane-Ouartini M. Lavialle C. Brison O. Mol. Cell.

Fragments containing FGF-3 intron 1 sequences were derived from the insert of a recombinant phage that encompasses the wholeFGF-3 gene (15.Galdemard C. Brison O. Lavialle C. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2331-2342PubMed Google Scholar). For the sake of simplicity, CAT constructs were called by the name of the promoter fragments that they contain, themselves designated by letters symbolizing the restriction sites at both ends, except for E2, E1, and E0. The E2 and E1 fragments were generated by polymerase chain reaction, whereas the E0 fragment was obtained by digestion with AvaII and NaeI; their boundaries are indicated in Fig. 3. The relative position of the promoter fragments present in each construct is shown below the maps of the FGF-3 locus in the diagrams presented in Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6 and9. All of the promoter fragments were inserted into pGCAT-C, except NcB, BB, SB, E2, E1, E0, ANc-SB, ANc(as)-SB, SB-AK, HX, HX(as), NcX, and NcX(as), that were inserted into pUSCAT-C. Plasmid pUSCAT-C was preferentially used over pGCAT-C whenever small promoter fragments driving low CAT expression levels were tested. Indeed, this vector yields lower background values (25.Gunther M. Frebourg T. Laithier M. Fossar N. Bouziane-Ouartini M. Lavialle C. Brison O. Mol. Cell.

The detailed protocol followed for the construction of each plasmid, as well as their map and full sequence, can be obtained directly from the authors. The construction of chimeric promoters containing activator elements from the SV40 virus early promoter (26.Zenke M. Grundstrom T. Matthes H. Wintzerith M. Schatz C. Wildeman A. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 387-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) upstream of the FGF-3 minimal promoter E0 were performed as follows: three different fragments were excised from the pUSSVCAT-C plasmid, (i) a 253-bpEcoRI-NcoI fragment containing the 72-bp enhancer repeat and the 6 GC boxes, (ii) a 158-bpEcoRI-SphI fragment containing only the 72-bp repeat, and (iii) a 91-bp SphI-NcoI fragment containing only the GC boxes; each fragment was blunt-ended with the T4 DNA polymerase and inserted into the unique SphI site (blunt-ended as well) of the E0 construct, immediately upstream of the E0 promoter fragment.Figure 6Transient expression assays disclose a promoter element located 6 kb upstream of the FGF-3gene. The map at the top corresponds to the same region as that presented in Fig. 4. Only the meaningfulNaeI, NcoI, and SacI sites are indicated. Selected fragments used in constructs designed to investigate the presence of a putative activator element between theHindIII and XhoI sites are depictedbelow the map together with the HB and SB fragments, already described in Fig. 4. The HindIII-XhoI (HX) fragment was inserted in both orientations (long arrows) in a CAT expression vector either upstream of the SN promoter fragment or alone. The subfragmentNcoI-XhoI (NcX) at the 5′ end of HX was also inserted alone in both orientations (short arrows). The histogram to the right shows the CAT activity assayed in extracts of 12A1 cells transiently transfected with these constructs. Activity levels are compared with those yielded by the SB and HB constructs and the pUSCAT-C control vector. CAT activity is expressed as described in the legend to Fig. 4, except that, due to the high activity levels of some of the constructs in 12A1 cells, the corresponding extracts were diluted accordingly before the assay and the values obtained were multiplied by the dilution factor.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Transient expression assays withFGF-3 promoter constructs containing various lengths of upstream sequences. The map at the topdepicts the 12-kb region at the 5′ end of the FGF-3 gene; the box at right represents the first exon, and the shaded area shows the beginning of the open reading frame for the FGF-3 protein. Restriction sites are abbreviated as in Fig. 2 and in addition: Nc, NcoI; N, NaeI; Sf, SfiI. Only the meaningfulNaeI, NcoI, and SacI sites are indicated. The BamHI site in parentheses to theleft corresponds to the cloning site of recombinant phage λD3 that was used to isolate promoter fragments (see “Experimental Procedures”; the position of this site coincides with that of theasterisk in Fig. 2). The restriction sites shown correspond to the ends of the promoter fragments (displayed as horizontal lines below the map) that drive the expression of the CAT gene in the various constructs tested. The 5′ and 3′ ends of the E0, E1, and E2 fragments are indicated on the sequence presented in Fig. 3. Thehistogram to the right shows the CAT activity assayed in extracts of 12A1 cells transiently transfected with the indicated constructs (gray bars). Only the BN, HB, KB, and BB constructs were assayed in B3 cells (dotted bars). Activity levels are compared with those yielded in both cell clones by the promoter-less vector pUSCAT-C (negative control) and by the strong SV40 early promoter-containing vector pUSSVCAT-C (positive control). Extracts of cells transfected with pUSSVCAT-C were diluted 100-fold before the assay. CAT activity is expressed as the percentage of conversion of chloramphenicol to its acetylated derivatives. Each value is the mean from at least two independent assays, each assay being carried out in triplicate for a given construct. Error barsindicate standard deviations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 9Stable transfection experiments withFGF-3 promoter constructs containing various lengths of upstream sequences. The map at the top is identical to that presented in Fig. 4, with the addition of a restriction site for EcoRV (Ev). Promoter fragments are represented as horizontal lines below the map. The histogram to the right shows the CAT activity assayed in extracts of 12A1 cells stably transfected with the same series of plasmids as that previously tested in transient expression assays (Fig. 4), plus the EvB construct. B3 cells were also transfected with the same plasmids, except the XB, SB2, and KB constructs. CAT activity is expressed as in Fig. 4. Each value is the mean from at least four independent pools of stably transfected cells. Error bars indicate standard deviations. The inset at thebottom left shows the CAT activity of the indicated subset of constructs on an expanded scale, to visualize the low activity levels barely distinguishable on the histogram atright. For the B3 transfectants, the CAT activity of all of the constructs tested, except BN, corresponds to background levels since a similar level (0.1–0.3%) was observed in pools of B3, as well as 12A1, cells stably transfected with promoter-less control vectors (not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Transient transfections were carried out using the calcium phosphate precipitation procedure described by Wigler et al. (27.Wigler M. Pellicer A. Silverstein S. Axel R. Cell. 1978; 14: 725-731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Cells, plated at a density of 3 × 106 per 10-cm dish the day before, were transfected with 20 μg of plasmid DNA. After a 24-h incubation with the DNA-calcium phosphate precipitate, the medium was changed and cells were harvested 48 h later. Stable transfectants were generated by the same transfection method, using the CAT expression vector to be tested (10 μg) together with 1 μg of pSVTKneoβ (conferring resistance to the neomycin derivative G418, supplied by Life Technologies, Inc.) (28.Nicolas J.F. Berg P. Silver L.M. Martin G.R. Strickland S. Cold Spring Harbor Conferences on Cell Proliferation: Teratocarcinoma Stem Cells. 10. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1983: 469-485Google Scholar). The procedure for the establishment of four independent pools of G418-resistant clones and harvesting of the cells from each pool for the preparation of whole cell extracts and genomic DNA has been described (29.Prochasson P. Gunther M. Laithier M. Fossar N. Lavialle C. Brison O. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 243-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). CAT assays and quantification of the results were carried out as previously reported (25.Gunther M. Frebourg T. Laithier M. Fossar N. Bouziane-Ouartini M. Lavialle C. Brison O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2490-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 29.Prochasson P. Gunther M. Laithier M. Fossar N. Lavialle C. Brison O. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 243-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Total cytoplasmic RNA was extracted according to a previously published procedure (16.Modjtahedi N. Lavialle C. Poupon M.F. Landin R.M. Cassingena R. Monier R. Brison O. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 4372-4379PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze the RNA of 12A1 cells stably transfected with the HX and BN constructs, two plasmids, pGHXC-PvPv1 and pGSNHC, respectively, were used as templates for the synthesis of antisense RNA probes. Plasmid pGHXC-PvPv1 was constructed by inserting, into the SmaI site of pGEM4, an 857-bp PvuII fragment excised from the HX construct and containing sequences from the FGF-3 upstream sequence (nucleotides 4835–5515; GenBankTM accession number Y12377) fused to 182 bp of the CAT gene 5′ region. In plasmid pGSNHC, a 570-bpSacI-PvuII fragment, excised from the SN construct and containing the FGF-3 promoterSacI-NaeI fragment (nucleotides 168–587; GenBankTM accession number X14445) fused to 150 bp of the CAT gene 5′ region, was inserted between the SacI andSmaI sites of pGEM4. Antisense RNA probes (specific activity 3 × 108 cpm/μg) were prepared by in vitro transcription of the plasmids pGHXC-PvPv1 and pGSNHC, linearized with NcoI or EcoRI, respectively, using phage T7 RNA polymerase (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), in the presence of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products). RNase protection assays were performed as described (30.Modjtahedi N. Haddada H. Lamonerie T. Lazar E. Lavialle C. Brison O. Int. J. Cancer. 1992; 52: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As a first approach to localize the sequences involved in the transcriptional regulation of theFGF-3 gene in cells of tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic clones from the SW613-S carcinoma cell line, we have mapped the DNase I-hypersensitive sites detectable in the chromatin of both cell types throughout the FGF-3 gene and the region extending 15 kb upstream. Nuclei prepared from cells of the tumorigenic clone SW613-12A1, the non-tumorigenic clone SW613-B3, or the EJ bladder carcinoma cell line were treated with increasing concentrations of DNase I. The EJ cell line was chosen as a negative control among a number of human tumor cell lines in which expression of theFGF-3 gene was never detected. Genomic DNA was then extracted, digested with various restriction enzymes, and analyzed by Southern blotting using small probes hybridizing close to one end of specific FGF-3 fragments. The seven combinations of enzymes and probes used in the different experiments are listed in TableI. These combinations were chosen to include overlaps so that all potential hypersensitive sites could be detected and to give redundancy allowing checks for internal consistency. An example of a Southern blot analysis is shown in Fig.1, and a compilation of the results depicted as a map is shown in Fig.2. Only a subset of very weak DNase I-hypersensitive sites were detected in the FGF-3 gene region of EJ cells in agreement with the fact that these cells do not express the gene. In contrast, numerous sites were found in the chromatin of both B3 and 12A1 cells (Fig. 2). This was unexpected in the case of B3 cells since we"
